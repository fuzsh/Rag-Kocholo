        "text": "THE twin‐engine Beech King Air, owned by the State of New York, lands‐ in thin slush at Albany County Airport, taxis to the Page Airways terminal and stops. A car pulls out of the parking lot immediately and drives to the plane to pick up a tall passenger traditionally stylish in gray fedora and tan camel's‐hair polo coat, who steps down from the plane with his wife. Others from the plane get into the car, but not the man and woman, who walk to the terminal, where another man waits with another car.\n\n“Everything all right?” the tall man asks.\n\n“All set. I think we'll make it on time.”\n\n“Plenty of time. We don't have to be there till 10.”\n\nThis center of vehicular attention is Perry Belmont Duryea Jr., 50 years old, Speaker of the New York State Assembly, the state's most influential Republican after Governor Rockefeller and a man mentioned almost every time his name appears in print as the possible successor to Rockefeller in 1974. With him, his wife, Betty. Waiting with cars for them and the others in their party: his chauffeur and his public‐relations man, Robert E. Spearman, an ex‐TV‐news executive. Destination: Skidmore College, 35 minutes away in Saratoga Springs, for a speech to an education conference. Skidmore: also the alma mater of Mrs. Duryea (class of ’44), who is along not to hear her husband give yet another speech, although will be a special one for her, but to visit her former art teacher.\n\nI T will be an ordinary day for the Speaker, a day begun at 6 A.M. in his home on the wintry beachfront of Montauk, a busy day of limited significance, a day in which no lightning would be forked, a day of two speeches, a day to enhance a public image, shape some law, make a little news.\n\nBob Spearman drives, with me in the front, the Duryeas riding in back. Had the Speaker heard that Earl Brydges, Republican majority leader of the Senate, had been hospitalized with the flu? No, says the surprised Speaker, he hadn't heard.\n\n“But Earl hasn't been well,” he adds. “He hasn't been well at all.”\n\nBrydges, 66, a well‐liked Niagara Falls Irishman who controls the Senate more by friendships than programs, has been a Senator since 1948 and his power is secure. But long ago it was clear he had reached his political apogee. He served 17 years before achieving power, first as minority, then majority leader. Perry Duryea made the climb quicker: elected Assemblyman in 1960, minority leader in 1966, Speaker in 1969. In three years as Speaker he has given the Assembly an image far more vivid than that of the Senate. Brydges's absence will only intensify the contrast.\n\nBob Spearman drives onto the Adirondack Northway and heads north, while the Speaker, half‐glasses on nose, studies crib cards for his speech. Betty Duryea recalls her Skidmore days amid Saratoga history, the old mansions, the track (where Skidmore girls could never go), the lore of Diamond Jim and Richard Canfield. She majored in art and has just made an esthetic contribution to the state: helping to choose 600 paintings that will eventually hang in the new legislative office building in Albany.\n\nSpearman turns off the Northway onto Saratoga's Union Avenue, the street of the race track and old elms, and of Yaddo, the Spencer Trask mansion, now an artists’ and writers’ retreat. “There it is,” Betty Duryea says, pointing to one of Yaddo's structures, barely visible through the trees. “We did our courting on the lawns, and in the old boathouse. Perry carved our initials.”\n\nThen Yaddo is gone and the Speaker is climbing the steps of Skidmore's new music building, to be greeted by the Chancellor of the State University, Skidmore's president and the State Education Commissioner. When his turn comes, the Speaker, wearing dark blue suit, black and gray rep tie, long‐collared white shirt, steps to the dais with crib cards. One hand in trouser pocket and the other free for gestures, he begins with a reference to the courtship of his wife in the early nineteen‐forties while he was at Colgate. Initials carved at Yaddo. Third upright post on the east side of the building.\n\nHe fiscalizes the courtship: “When four fellows came up with $14 apiece, the decision at 1:30 P.M. Friday was go … three‐hour trip by car from Colgate to Skidmore … 60‐cent spaghetti dinner at Fusco's … skiing, $3 for a party of eight … Sunday, two whisky sours at 35 cents a copy, six‐course steak dinner for $1.50 at the New Worden … And what would that cost today?”\n\nTuition rise at the State Univer sity? If that happens it must be accompanied by scholar — incentive programs for low — income families. Tuition rise at City University of New York as the Governor suggested? Not likely in an election year. Aid to private schools? The legislative mood is inclined to help. Building funds. Schools in trouble. Downturn. Close with a gag. The talking computer is asked by a skeptic: “Where is my father?”\n\n“Fishing on Saratoga Lake.”\n\n“It's a fake, my father is buried in Plattsburg.”\n\nAsk it again. O.K.: “Where's my mother's husband?”\n\nAnswer: “In an attractive Plattsburg graveyard … but your father is still fishing at Saratoga.”\n\nLaughter. Always leave ‘em laughing.\n\nThe speech will make news, for the Speaker, by predicting no CUNY tuition rise, has upstaged the Governor. The Associated Press will write yet another article on the strained Rockefeller‐Duryea relationship. Back in the car, as an old dorm comes into view, Betty Duryea remembers a famous night: Perry saying good night to her through the screen, and a crazy night watchman taking a shot at him.\n\nNostalgia. Aging.\n\nBetty Duryea says to her husband: “What a long, full circle, from those beer picnics on Yaddo's lawn. And to come back there 30 years later, td the podium.”\n\nThe past. Pride. The future.\n\nSINCE his entry into politics he has been called a man in a hurry. His success has been rapid and uninterrupted, but instead of a sharp image, he has created a blur few people can clearly assess, a composite of labels: fiscal watchdog, legislative reformer, heartless reactionary, courageous progressive, archenemy of New York City, ambitious opportunist, flaming moderate.\n\nA clear ideology is lacking. He has not defined the conservatism that most people associate him with, as has, say, New York's Senator James Buckley; and so the accusation of nondescript powermongering sticks to him.\n\nPolitical activists in New York City see him as one of the major Albany enemies maltreating the city. But some Manhattan legislators admit their constituents really know him only slightly better than they know Lieut. Gov. Malcolm Wilson. And they call him “Malcolm Who?” These legislators themselves are friendly to the Speaker and avoid knocking him personally, a bit of protocol about which a poetic insider remarked: “You have to expect that here. This is the peaceable kingdom, where the lion and the leopard sit down together and share the antelope.”\n\nLegislative reform is said by his boosters to be Duryea's main achievement—restructuring the Assembly to give it greater sophistication, power and autonomy, increasing its independence of the executive branch. Others see it as merely transient style, change written on the water. And Democrats see very little change at all. The spoils system prevails, Democratic bills and amendments get scant attention and usually fall victim to a G.O.P. party vote, and the new Assembly research staff, of which Duryea's people are so proud, does no work for Democratic Assemblymen.\n\n“People can think he's genuinely doing things in the areas of reform,” Democratic Assemblywoman Mary Ann Krupsak, a fiery upstate feminist said in an interview, “but he still uses it for the perpetuation of partisan politics. He's dangerous because he's slick. He knows all the angles on image‐building, on P.R. stuff; he looks attractive, and he'll do just enough to give people the suggestion that he's opening up the system, when the real guts, the hard‐core stuff that would really make the system work in a democratic way he's not touched at all.”\n\nSome high points of the Speaker's legislative career suggest the ideological blur which confuses people about his aims. He sponsored the Environmental Bill of Rights, now part of the State Constitution. He worked hard for the 18‐year‐old vote. He earned the Humanitarian Award from the New York Kidney Foundation for his legislation (since emulated by 30 states) creating the Kidney Disease Institute. He has perennially backed increased aid to education, his main interest. He cast the tie‐breaking vote that legalized abortion. But he also presides over a legislative body which seems consistently to punish the poor and near‐poor, all but repealing the pioneering Medicaid program, cutting welfare drastically (Duryea masterminded the legislation), decontrolling some New York City rents (only to see them recontrolled as inflationary by the Nixon freeze), and so on.\n\n“During the past three years,” Stanley Steingut, leader of the Assembly's Democratic minority, said in an interview, “we've seen the great influence of reactionary members in the Legislature. I don't like to be personally critical of the Speaker, but he must bear the responsibility for what this Legislature produced. I believe we've gone back 20 years.”\n\nONE thing is clear about the confusion the Speaker has generated: it reflects the contradictory concerns of his Suffolk County constituency. Suffolk has had the largest numerical population growth of any county in the state, and possibly the nation—up almost half a million since 1960 to 1.12 million. This year it will gain, because of population shift, three new Assembly seats, the same number New York City will lose.\n\nSuffolk is a traditionally Republican enclave (by al most two to one) at the far end of Long Island, a bedroom community for New York, a summer resort, heavily agricultural (potatoes and ducks), dominantly middle class, 50 per cent Catholic and probably the most conservative county on the New York City periphery. The hordes of ex‐New Yorkers who have come there to live (rule of thumb: 50,000 newcomers each year) bring with them city concerns and allegiances to the Democratic party. Many are willing to buy Republicanism if it will hold down taxes, provide good schools and fend off the crime, drugs, filth, traffic snarls, pollution and racial tension they fled the city to avoid.\n\nThe result is a new agenda that conforms to neither the xenophobic, antigovernment rural conservatism which was the prevailing Suffolk ideology not so long ago, nor to urban liberalism which was the perennial threat. Suffolk Republican leaders assess the hybrid agenda as moderate Republicanism; but there are too many right‐leaning concerns — restrictive zoning, fiscal austerity, sentiment against social programs—for it to carry a moderate label. (In 1971, the Suffolk G.O.P. barred their party candidates from accepting Conservative endorsement — because the Conservatives had grown too strong. Conservative resentment over this development could threaten Duryea's own political future.)\n\nSuburban Conservatism is a more apt description. It finds adherents in any area trying to homogenize the suburban squire and the urban refugee. And since one of the most visible political translations of the problem and prejudices of this odd lot is, at the moment, Perry Duryea, his gubernatorial wagon rolls and rolls and rolls.\n\nTHE speculation is that if Rockefeller serves until ’74, Duryea is a natural for the nomination. But an enduring rumor has the Governor, manager of the 1972 Nixon campaign in New York, ready to accept a Cabinet job or a flashy equivalent, should Nixon win and offer same. This would put Malcolm Wilson, more conservative by reputation than Duryea, in the Governor's chair for the unexpired part of the term, and a Duryea‐Wilson fight would be likely.\n\nDuryea downplays his candidacy and says he hasn't even discussed it with his wife. “Whatever happens will be decided in large part by factors beyond my control,” he said in an interview. “I couldn't even be an effective leader in the Assembly if the Republicans felt the only concern I really had was to further my personal career. A lot of people say, ‘You're stupid, you should start raising money.’ If I'm stupid, I'm stupid. I'm just not going to get into that kind of thing.”\n\nThe immediate focus is on keeping an Assembly majority this year, for a reversal of only five votes would sweep Duryea back into the politically fell void of minorityism. The Presidential election could affect the outcome. The memory is still vivid of ’64, when Lyndon Johnson's landslide carried away both Speaker Joseph F. Carlin and Senate Majority Leader Walter J. Mahoney, and gave the Democrats both houses for the first time since 1935. The Republicans regained the Senate in ’65, but it was four years before they took back the Assembly. When they did, it was with help from the new Conservative party—about a dozen and a half cross‐endorsements they were then glad to get.\n\nPerry Duryea came to power in this starboard‐tilting ship. Was it because he was a conservative in his heart? Emmet O'Brien, a Gannett newsman who has covered the Capitol for 27 years, looks askance at such questions about political animals: “I suppose he's closer to Nixon than Rockefeller or Kennedy, but all this is subject to change. Irving Ives came up here as a red hot conservative and, through upheavals, got leadership. He went to the U. S. Senate as a Republican liberal.”\n\nThe Albany Day: 4 P.M.\n\nIN the anteroom of the Speaker's office at the Capitol the crush is on. Just about everybody, except maybe the bored assistant secretary, who is selling chances on $200 glass elephant, is waiting to see Perry. Sitting beside Loretta Pelkey, Perry's principal secretary, Assemblyman Pete Biondo of Westchester hums a tarantellatempo tune while Loretta peruses a song sheet. Pete writes the annual Duryea musicale, a spoof of Assembly doings aimed at intensifying esprit de corps among the too‐often spiritless boys.\n\n“You like the song? You recognize it?” Pete asks.\n\n“It's nice,” Loretta says.\n\n“It's Italian,” Pete says, and he laughs fortissimo. Pete is very fond of his own musicales, even before they happen. Loretta smiles politely and goes back to work.\n\nThe crowd grows. Now four Assemblymen are waiting to see the Speaker, and Henry Mund, the short, baldish, exbottled‐gas executive who is Duryea's right‐hand man, looks at his watch. A meeting of the Speaker's staff is already 15 minutes overdue, and what is keeping him? Henry opens the door to Perry's inner sanctum to discover: no Perry.\n\n“He went out the other door,” Henry says, shrugging. “He's on the rostrum.”\n\nON the dark wooden rostrum which rises out of the well of the opulent Assembly chamber, where 79 Republicans and 71 Democratic Assemblymen (three members are women) transact business, Perry Duryea, gavel in hand, stands tall and lean, 6 foot 2, 195 pounds, a sartorially conservative paradigm for his staff, smiling his million‐dollar smile, even though he claims he's only a half‐millionaire, his silver hair giving him the image of a gray eminence and also a nickname: The Silver Fox.\n\nThis disciplined presence on this late winter afternoon, a month and a half into very slow session, moves to rostrum's edge to welcome Alaska's U. S. Senator, Democrat Mike Gravel, who has just been introduced from the floor, and is now being escorted to the rostrum steps by Stanley Steingut.\n\n“This guy,” Stanley is telling the Senator about Perry, “is quite a fisherman, you know.”\n\nGravel has no chance to make fishing talk. Perry says hello, then slams the gavel powerfully, perhaps therapeutically, certainly uninhibitedly and authoritatively, against the wooden block. (He occasionally breaks both gavel and block in this manual power display.) The lawmakers cough and haruumph into respectful silence.\n\n“I used to be a Speaker myself,” Senator Gravel says. “We had the same kind of pandemonium.” He says he also knew the value of brevity and so he hopes only that the great national problemtaxes—could be solved through Federal revenue‐sharing, and urges the New York Legislature and Congress to work together toward that.\n\nDuryea, a skeptic about Federal revenue‐sharing becoming a 1972 reality, has said in his Skidmore speech that the Governor's 1972–73 budget was “still $400‐million out of balance,” implying that to the extent that it counted on this amount in Federal revenue, the document was either inept or gullible. And as Senator Gravel moves down the rostrum's steps, the Speaker advises him, and the rest of his listeners, in a most ironic tone: “Senator, whenever you're prepared to send the revenue, we're prepared to receive.”\n\nLaughter. Always leave ‘em laughing.\n\nExit Perry, back to his office. And to the rostrum comes Republican Assemblyman Neil Kelleher, an extroverted and quick‐witted Irishman from Troy who has become known as the assistant speaker. Technically there is no such animal, but Kelleher earned the title because he's so often chosen, among others, as Perry's surrogate to mediate debate.\n\nBehind the Speaker's door, Duryea can follow floor debate via loudspeaker. An aide said that when he hears trouble he makes it to the rostrum in about three seconds.\n\nThe “assistant speaker” frees the Speaker for other legislative and political business. This is very unlike the style of the previous Speaker, Anthony J. Travia, who ruled from 1965 through 1968 and is now a Federal District Court Judge. Travia used the rostrum as an office as well as a Speaker's platform. Manhattan reform Democrat AI Blumenthal, the Assembly minority whip, recalled that Perry did start out in Travia style: “When he was first elected he never left the ros trum. It was as if when he went to the john somebody would take his chair. And Tony, he never left. He went beyond the control of nature. Tony never left the rostrum, period.”\n\nPerry himself says this about Travia's work habits: “He'd be on the rostrum all day, then take home 300 bills at night and sit with two people in his hotel room and work from 8 o'clock till 3 in the morning. As chairman of the Rules Committee he, along with those two aides, actually considered 3,000 bills a year and reported them to the floor. That's not the legislative process in my mind. That work should be done in the committees, with the people who represent the entire state making the decisions, rather than a very tight group. But saying that doesn't mean Tony wasn't a great and constructive force in his own way.”\n\nThe Albany Day: 4:30 P.M.\n\nTHE Speaker sits behind his large, orderly desk, half glasses again on the nose, looking over the agenda for the meeting while his highsalaried staff assembles—Al Roberts ($38,900), June Martin ($32,476, making her probably the highest paid woman in state government anywhere), Henry Mund ($27,030), Joe Bruno ($26,235), Bob Spearman ($25,096), Charlie Webb ($23,750 a session) and a latecomer, Philip J. Bisceglia, ex‐counsel to Joe Carlino and to Duryea when he was minority leader, the man who now controls the calendar and flow of bills ($32,875). The Speaker makes $41,000, of which $15,000 is his legislator's salary and $26,000 expenses.\n\nThe staff settles into tan leather chairs and sofas around the large, gold‐carpeted office, the walls of which reflect the Speaker's interests: a print of four lobstermen in a small boat, hauling a net out of calm waters; a map of the Bahamas, where he plays and also has a part‐interest in 100 acres; eight paintings of duck heads and ducks in flight, and, on the window sill, a carved woollen duck.\n\nHe begins the rundown of the meeting's agenda: a bistate commission on coastline control; a way to get home‐building money for the Poospatuck and Shinnecock Indians of Suffolk, now excluded from Federal mortgage money; child abuse, a package of five bills screened by Charlie Webb and bearing the Speaker's name. “I don't think we have any technical problems on the bills if they satisfy Charlie,” says the Speaker, “but shouldn't we touch base with the Judicial Conference? What we're doing is tampering with the courts…”\n\n“Narcotics … anything new?”\n\n“Not much, Perry,” Henry Mund says.\n\nWhat about a conference of Narcotics Guidance Councils? The council idea, originated in 1969 as an alternative, for parents of young addicts and preaddicts, to turning Junior over to the police, came from Mund and became Duryea legislation. Now 420 councils exist.\n\n“I'm a little leery of bringing that many people here,” the Speaker says. “Can't we send a letter out?”\n\nA letter will be sent.\n\nEnvironmental conservation? Congress may pull back $1.5‐million in matching funds for beach erosion since the Governor's budget didn't mention it. “The Environmental Commissioner,” the Speaker says, “claims he can scratch around and find a quarter of a million.”\n\nCourt reform? “Where are we, Charlie?” A package of bills in process … Program bills from the Governor? “Very light,” Phil Bisceglia says. “Only what was in the message … “ No‐fault insurance?\n\n“One thing we have to watch here,” the Speaker says. “Johnny McCarthy (Assembly Insurance Committee chairman) went to investigate the Massachusetts plan, which is not so great as reports in the press indicate.”\n\n“They saved on one end,” Bisceglia says, “but collision went up 38 per cent.”\n\nSo maybe there shouldn't be a no‐fault bill yet?\n\n“If we only saved 10 per cent it'd be something,” the Speaker says, “plus the cutback on the court calendar that would result. It's a step forward. I'm firmly convinced we have to take one step in New York this year. We're still piggybacking on Massachusetts. And I don't want to see the Senate's bill come to this house at the end of the session with no Assembly input.”\n\nTHE Speaker's concern that Assembly “input”—easily the must overworked word in the Duryea camp—be fin all major legislation, be it original bills or amendments, has earned him the designation of autocrat: cool, organized, efficient, ubiquitous administrator, legislator and taskmaster. His ability to stay abreast of it all, touch what he wants to touch, is ascribed to a prodigious memory, a talent for quick comprehension and instant decision.\n\nBut such control is a progression from quite another Perry Duryea, the fledgling Speaker whom Al Blumenthal remembers watching from the other side of the aisle in 1969: “He was very uptight, very thin‐skinned. If you challenged his rule he got very sore. His face would turn red and he'd rule me out of order and end up trying to punish our side.”\n\nWillful Duryea politicking goes back to Perry's greatgrandfather, Charles Duryea, a Queens Democratic Assemblyman in 1864. Beaten by seven votes in a re‐election bid, he traveled to Albany anyway for the 1865 session, sat at his old desk and wouldn't leave the chamber. Seven sergeants‐at‐arms carried out him, and his desk, and that was that for greatgranddad.\n\nPerry's Brooklyn‐born father settled in Montauk after World War I and eventually bought into a fishing business. He won a State Senate seat in 1942 and later was Gov. Thomas E. Dewey's Conservation Commissioner.\n\nPerry Jr., after graduating from Colgate with a BA. in economics in 1942, joined the Navy and became a lieutenant commander flying PB2‐Y transports. He married Elizabeth Ann Weed of Bronxville in 1944 and fathered two children: Perry 3d, like father Colgate grad, is about to enter Columbia Business School, and Lynn, 25, like mother an art major, is now finishing master's at N.Y.U.\n\nIn 1946 Perry took over the family seafood business, emphasizing lobsters. During Assembly sessions, he attends it largely by proxy and on weekends. In the summer, he usually gives it more attention. This year, however, after Assembly adjournment at the end of April or early in May, he will also be a heavy campaigner, since all Assemblymen are up for crucial reelection. But the business hardly suffers from the political distractions. Perry B. Duryea and Son, Inc., is one of the East Coast's largest lobster distributors, with an annual volume of 1.5 million pounds at $1.75\n\nHE debuted in politics at the town level in East Hampton, prospered by leading the move to oust Suffolk's G.O.P. leadership in the late nineteen‐fifties during avast political scandal. He campaigned for the Assembly in 1959, using car and plane, and won. The plane (he now has twin‐engine Piper Aztec) let him live in remote Suffolk and still commute swiftly to Albany. It also streamlined his image and advanced his career. Carlino named him Assembly campaign chairman and from 1964 to 1968 he flew back and forth across the state to aid sagging campaigns.\n\nLegislative reform, a hohum issue at best, gained prominence in the ’68 campaign and when Duryea took over as Speaker in ’69 he gave it priority. He cut back the 38 standing committees (most of them irrelevant under Travia) to 21, put them to work year‐round and established the research staff to help them.\n\nA reverse reform was Duryea's removal of the electronic voting machine Travia had installed in 1967 for $250,000. Travia used it only once; Duryea also tried it, but both found it an enemy. Duryea's reason for removal was cost and slowness, but what the machine really meant, said Al Blumenthal, “was the end of guys staying for the roll call and the first part of Monday's calendar, then taking off and, for the rest of the week, being marked present and voting.”\n\nThe reform that worked better than anyone anticipated, and that ushered in The Era of the Auditor, was the restructuring of the Ways and Means Committee to wage fiscal war on the Governor. A special commission advised Ways and Means it should review revenues as well as expenditures in the Governor's budget. And so when the 1971–72 budget of $8.45‐billion arrived, Ways and Means was ready with both revenue and expenditure analysts, and what they turned up sent Al Roberts, director of the budget‐probing, scurrying to Duryea.\n\n“We told him,” Roberts says, “that the Governor's revenue estimates could not possibly be met.” Roberts found the government's growth rate far exceeding revenue growth. “That was when,” Roberts recalls, “having been with him five years, I thought I was watching the Speaker indicate a course of action totally at odds with the request of the Governor.”\n\nTo say the least.\n\nWays and Means reattacked the budget—with a meat ax, the Governor said—and on March 4 recommended cuts that eventually came in at $756‐million, axing almost everything: Medicaid, welfare, school aid, mental hygiene, health. Rockefeller unleashed some Cabinet members to retaliate, but only the Mental Hygiene Commissioner, Dr. Alan D. Miller, drew blood. He wrote every legislator that if $49‐million was cut from his department as planned, “many patients could not receive needed treatment, many would be poorly cared for, some would die.”\n\n“Apparently,” Dr. Miller said with adverbial innocence during an interview, “those last three words were political dynamite.”\n\nPress, public and Perry Duryea thought so. “The Legislature has its prerogatives,” the Speaker says in not entirely tranquil recollection of that fight, “and if people want to confront us they have to recognize they may be getting into open war.”\n\nDuryea called Miller, “mad as hell,” Miller recalls. “'Who did I think I was doing a thing like that?’ He said there'd been problems in my department and that the Legislature was going to look into them.” One source claims Duryea was so angry he told Miller he'd see to it that his department got nothing.\n\nA special new Assembly subcommittee was formed and promptly turned Mental Hygiene inside out with hearings. Cuts of $35‐million (not $49‐million) were made, generating vast layoffs. Public protests and the media focused on mental hospitals, the horrible example being Willowbrook State School for the Retarded on Staten Island. Duryea, in a total turnaround, recently told a newsman that he urged Ways and Means to reorder priorities this year and find an additional $10‐million to $20‐million for Mental Hygiene.\n\nSLASHES in the current budget were forestalled in January when Democratic votes were needed to pass the Governor's $407‐million tax package. In return for their votes, Democrats demanded that spending for education and social programs not fall below given levels. The Governor and Earl Brydges agreed, but Perry Duryea only went along to a degree. The tax program went through, however.\n\nAl Blumenthal admits to being confused by the Speaker's role in the tax negotiations. “He allowed his party to divide and refused to take sides. I'm not sure where that leaves him as a leader.” And on the budget cuts Blumenthal adds: “I don't know whether he led that or merely allowed the cuts to occur. In the first three years he developed himself as a strong leader, but in terms of where he is taking his troops, no direction ever became clear to me.”\n\nWhat is certain is that Duryea approved initially of the cuts, and then a deadlock developed between upstate conservative Republicans who wanted even further cuts, and downstate suburban moderate Republicans who resisted. Without compromising too much with the Democrats, Duryea persuaded, arm‐twisted and traded‐off with all his Republican colleagues until he'd patched 76 votes together to pass the modified budget.\n\n“R EMEMBER,” one of Perry's friends says, “he grew up in Montauk, a cold, remote place.” People thought of him that way: aloof, independent. His speeches were said to lack warmth and humor. He was deficient, one writer said, in bonhomie. But his peers see him, then as now, as “a man's man” and “a swashbuckling type”—Hemingway stuff—a warm, witty companion on the hunt, the sail, the voyage aboard his converted lobster boat, a sailor who harpoons sharks, a pilot who flies friends to Maryland for a shoot, a hunter who sits for five hours in a duck blind when the temperature is 5 below.\n\nThe closer you get to Montauk the more Suffolk County looks like New England, street in Bennington sometimes, or maybe Stockbridge. A lot like Cape Cod, including the shingles, but with more space. You come to what seems like the thinning out of a settled area and then a Cadillac dealer looms up. One night club advertises music by the Baggy Knees Live Band, and the Red Onion offers “Banjos, Banjos, Ban jos.” Real estate is the business to be in, signs everywhere, prices of land rising as the mob pushes east. Zoning is one acre minimum in some eastern Suffolk towns, but it's only holding at one‐third of an acre in others.\n\nPrivilege. Privacy. Trouble. Going east to Montauk the world, in winter, truly does thin down. Soon you are riding along the desolate Old Montauk Highway, the beach right there alongside you, rich with beautiful Japanese black pine, planted years ago to hold off erosion. You pass an inn where in summer you can rent a cottage for two for $50 a day and then, a few houses up the road, the mailbox says Spindrift. This is the Duryea house.\n\nIt is ranch‐style, designed by Betty Duryea, built on an acre of land nine years ago at a cost of $50,000, but worth much more now. It sits on the crest of a sandy hill that slopes down to the beach. Beyond the snow‐covered dunes and the dead brown beach grass, easy breakers roll up strips of foam to match the snow on the beach, and a solitary white gull stands at thee water's edge, a ready‐made symbol for the Speaker, who flies into Montauk from Albany sometimes, just for the day, just to be alone on that beach.\n\nThis gregarious solitary enters his living room in gray flannel trousers, open‐collared shirt, blue cardigan, brown loafers, just back from work at the lobster office, seven minutes away. Have a drink? Sure. But he drinks Fresca, staying trim. And then in this elegant but by no means opulent room, with more ducks and ducks’ heads on the walls (Nyroca Ferina) and collection or glass elephants and a black cocker spaniel recently coifed (Blackie), he proves to be a soft‐spoken, open and likable man.\n\nThere follows a rambling conversation—interrupted by a lobster dinner cooked by Betty Duryea, succulent, modified Newburg without eggs or cream. The talk immediately clarifies small curlicue in the blur and reinforces what he'd said about the governorship. But it goes beyond that, suggesting that restlessness may be the element that explains Perry Duryea as a man for whom lateral questing is survival: one place, one thing, one thought unrelieved, deadens the life of the day.\n\nA friend has said he couldn't picture Perry Duryea outside politics, but that is because the high promise of the mo ment suits the Speaker's need. But let a Democratic upset toss him back ‘Into the minority, or let Rockefeller abdicate and Malcolm win the primary, leaving the once upwardbound lobsterman only the long wait for ’78, and watch him then, as the rows of desks in the great Albany chamber turn into just another assembly line, be psychologically on the way to elsewhere before the news hits the papers.\n\n“The curve goes off at one point,” he says, meaning anywhere and in anything. “When boredom sets in?” “Exactly.”\n\nThe Albany Day: 7:30 P.M.\n\nTHE cocktail hour of the last day of the convention of the Federation of Women's Republican Clubs of New York State rings with not‐quite‐liberated lines: “Today 53 per cent of the voters are women … the temper of the time is that they should have significant patronage … we're out of the dungeons, not dumb broads anymore … Perry Duryea? He still wears white shirts. Nobody tells him what's happening. If he'd jump on the women's patronage bandwagon he'd do well.”\n\nIt is dinner time. Mrs. Betty Duryea looks around the crowded room for her husband, finds him. “There's Pooh Bear,” she says. When the band plays “Marching Along Together,” they walk with the other distinguished guests to the head table.\n\nPeace slogans and Nixon and Rockefeller posters curl up on the walls as a parade of speakers knock John Lindsay and equate Nixon with Lincoln. The speeches are selfadulatory, flackish, patronizing to women. Perry folds and unfolds his hands, reading his crib cards. (“No matter how bored you are,” a friend of Perry's says, “he's more bored.”) The dullness drives bunches of diners out of the hall.\n\nAt 9:50 Perry is introduced. He retells the courtship story he told at Skidmore. He praises the two State Assemblywomen who are present, Constance Cooke, a Republican from Ithaca and Rosemary Gunning, Republi in‐Conservative from Queens. They've been a great addi??? and I hope you send a ??? more to us.” (The Assem??? third woman, Democrat ary Ann Krupsak, is a lib??? female who has ac??? Perry of inhibiting the establishment of a joint legislative conference on women's rights.)\n\nNobody can say Perry Durea's speeches lack warmth ??? humor.\n\n“Remember the old saws?” asks. “Republicans read e financial pages, Democrats put them in the bottom their bird cages. Democrats by banned books, Republiins form censorship committies and read them as a group. Republicans keep their shades ???, though there's little reason why they should. Democrats don't, but they ought to. Men court Democratic girls although they want to marry Republican girls, because they want to have a little fun first. Republicans sleep in twin‐bed rooms, and that's why there's more Democrats.”"
