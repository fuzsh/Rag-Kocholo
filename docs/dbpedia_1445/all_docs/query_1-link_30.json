Your hard work, determination, and family's and friends' support have been instrumental in guiding you through a rigorous program of study at SUNY Geneseo.\n\nLike those who have supported you, we take great pride in your accomplishments. You are joining a long line of distinguished Geneseo alumni stretching back more than 150 years to the college's founding.\n\nYou are graduating from one of the finest public liberal arts colleges in the country. During the last few years, you have come to know that Geneseo is more than a location, a public honors college, and a village. It's a community—of scholars and citizens, faculty and students, family and friends—united by a shared purpose: the education of tomorrow's teachers and doctors, musicians and managers, scientists and sociologists, who will become the molders and shapers of the future on the national and international stage.\n\nWhile pursuing your academic dreams, you have shown the strength, intelligence, and talent for which Geneseo students are known. From the outstanding achievements on the field of competition through SUNYAC and NCAA Division III athletic events to the caliber of research presentations and performances in the annual GREAT Day celebrations, your class has much to be proud of.\n\nAs you receive your diploma, you will join thousands of alumni who demonstrate vividly the value of a liberal arts education from Geneseo and why our graduates are in high demand in business, education, government, the fine arts, and science here and around the world.\n\nNo matter where your journey takes you, I hope you will return regularly to Geneseo—in spirit or in person—for an alumni reunion or simply to stroll across campus and visit Emmeline perched on the fountain in the heart of the Village. You are now a permanent member of the extended Geneseo family, a welcoming community of resourceful and talented individuals making a difference in their communities who are eager to help you reach your dreams.\n\nWe cannot wait to hear about all you will do, the lives you will touch, and the mountains you will move. Congratulations on your outstanding achievement. Please keep in touch.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDenise A. Battles, President\n\nCommencement Speaker\n\nImage\n\nAndrea Holland '01\n\nAndrea Holland '01 has more than 20 years of experience as an executive coach, leader, and speaker.

Wilcox\n\nBrooke A. Witherow\n\nSenior Orators\n\nThe Senior Oration is an important opportunity for seniors to share reflections on the Geneseo experience with the graduating class. “Student-to-student communication represents what the graduates take with them into the world and demonstrates the results of the excellent teaching and learning that distinguish a Geneseo education,” says President Denise A. Battles.\n\nMembers of the Class of 2024 were invited to compete for the honor of Senior Orator in a multi-stage process.\n\nFrom this year's excellent entries, Katlin McNeil '24 will speak at the morning ceremony. She is graduating with a double major in history and English and a minor in medieval studies. Aman Manghi '24 will speak at the afternoon ceremony. He is pursuing a double major in economics and finance.\n\nSpecial Awards\n\nThe Richard Roark Award was first presented in May 1970, less than two months after Roark, a professor of anthropology at Geneseo, was presumed drowned off the Island of Guadeloupe in the French West Indies. The endowed award is given to a graduating senior whose excellence in scholarship and community service emulates Roark's. The recipient will receive a stipend to purchase books and will have their name inscribed on a plaque in the Robert MacVittie College Union.\n\nThe President's Cup is given annually to a graduating senior who exemplifies superior service and dedication to the Student Association through involvement in and leadership of the association and its funded organizations. Students receiving this award must have at least a 2.7 grade point average. Recipients are selected by the newly elected executive committee, and the award is presented by the incoming Student Association president at the Commencement Rehearsal.\n\nAcademic Attire\n\nAcademic attire generally consists of cap, gown, and hood worn on formal occasions at institutions of higher learning. This attire reflects the ecclesiastical garb of the medieval period when scholars were nearly all members of the clergy.\n\nThe bachelor's gown is worn closed, distinguished by its long, pointed sleeves; the master's gown is designed to be worn open and has long sleeves with an arc cut in front and square base in the back. The doctoral gown is worn open or closed and has velvet panels down the front and three velvet bars on the round, full sleeve.\n\nA distinguishing feature of academic attire is the hood. Its size, shape, and color designate the degree earned and the college or university. Bachelor's hoods are rarely used, but they are similar in design to master's hoods and are three feet long. The master's hood measures three and a half feet. The doctoral hood is rounder and four feet long. Hoods are lined with the official colors of the institution conferring the degree, such as blue and gold for the State University of New York. The binding around the hood is velvet and the color indicates the major field of study.\n\nCaps are normally black and the most common is the four-pointed mortarboard, but tams are also worn. Tassels are worn over the left front quarter after the degree has been conferred. Tassels were historically black although doctoral degree holders may wear a shorter gold tassel.\n\nThe Mace\n\nThe faculty and staff procession is led by the Grand Marshal, who carries the Geneseo mace. The mace dates to medieval times and is a symbol of authority. Geneseo's mace is carried only at the New Student Convocation and Commencement.\n\nThe mace and a companion medallion were designed and created by Professor Willard Peterson in 1971 in response to a commission by a committee of students and alumni chaired by Robert Redden. Peterson's design for the Geneseo mace fashions New York State cherry wood into the handle and the traditional spikes. The ornamentation features a blue lapis lazuli gemstone (found in the US only in New York State) and honors the Geneseo blue. The sunburst surrounding the stone alternates twelve gold and silver shafts, reflecting the light of learning.\n\nThe mace was a gift to the College by the Alpha Clionian Corporation. The medallion, worn by the president as a seal of office, was given by the Class of 1969.\n\nA new lanyard for the medallion was designed and created by Professor Patrice Case in 2016. A cabinet to house both was designed and constructed by Professor Paul Hepler and presented to the College by the Alumni Association.\n\nIt stands in the Tower Room of Doty Hall, where the mace and medallion are permanently displayed.\n\nCandidates for Degree, Bachelor of Arts\n\n+ Teaching Certificate\n\n++ Dual Major\n\nCandidates for Degree, Bachelor of Professional Studies\n\nMusical Theatre\n\nSophia E.

After each ceremony, shuttles will make stops near the College Union Plaza in addition to the parking areas.\n\nBarnes and Noble Bookstore\n\nLooking to grab some last-minute Geneseo swag? The bookstore, located in the MacVittie College Union, will be open 8 a.m.–5 p.m. today.\n\nEmergency Evacuation\n\nIn the unlikely event the arena needs to be evacuated, we ask each person to exit via the closest exit located in each corner of the arena.\n\nGeneseo staff will then assist by directing you to the nearest point of shelter.\n\nAlma Mater\n\nLyrics\n\nShine the sun down on her halls of wisdom\n\nwhere memories linger\n\nand our thoughts remain\n\nSing her praises out across the valley\n\nthat echoes our refrain\n\nGeneseo, Geneseo,\n\nsend us on our way\n\nGeneseo, Geneseo,\n\nwith our life's work we'll repay\n\nMusic and lyrics by Ray Agnew"
