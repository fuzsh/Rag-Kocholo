It shows how employers have come to monopolize that freedom for themselves, and why workers experience speech control instead of speech freedom.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nAmericans are divided on any number of fundamental questions, but a recent poll shows broad support for free speech: “Seventy-one percent of Americans think that people should be able to say what they want without state or government censorship” (Gray 2016). But many U.S. workers are not really free to speak their minds, and it’s not the government censoring them but their bosses, even when the workers are off duty and even when they are outside of work. This paper discusses the reasons for—and limits of—employer control over employees’ expression.\n\nIn 49 U.S. states—every one except Montana—the default setting for private-sector, nonunion employment is “at-will,” which is often described as employment from which employees can be fired for a bad reason, an arbitrary reason, or no reason at all. One employment law casebook describes the at-will rule like this: “the employer [is] free to impose any conditions of employment, to discharge an employee at any time for any reason, and to effect the discharge in virtually any manner” (Rothstein, Liebman, and Yuracko 2015). The philosopher Elizabeth Anderson has emphasized the consequences of employers’ freedom under the at-will rule, characterizing private-sector employment as a form of “private government,” and a dictatorial one at that. Anderson rightly emphasizes that employers often have the power to fire employees because of their out-of-work speech and other off-duty activities—a reality of which many employees are unaware. Of course, private employers are not the same as government—Anderson points out that government can often impose much harsher penalties than employers can. Likewise, while workers often face practical barriers to changing jobs, it is still generally easier to change jobs than to immigrate to a new country. At the same time, “private governments impose a far more minute, exacting, and sweeping regulation of employees than democratic states do in any domain outside of prisons and the military” (Anderson 2017, 63). In other words, employers’ freedom to fire employees for bad or arbitrary reasons is in essence a freedom to control employees’ behavior in significant ways, even when they are off the clock.\n\nThe at-will default is nominally evenhanded, in the sense that employees are also free to quit their jobs for any reason, at any time, and in any manner. But, as other papers in the Unequal Power initiative show, workers operate under a host of constraints that limit their practical ability to quit. A weak social safety net, uncertainty about how easy it will be to find another job, and family obligations that prevent someone from moving for work can all leave employees stuck working for controlling or abusive employers—and the next employer might be just as bad (Edwards 2022). The rarity of full employment makes quitting and switching jobs problematic, especially for Blacks and workers lacking a college credential (Mishel 2022). And even when wages are cut workers do not quit to the extent that economic theory posits, indicating that employer power is pervasive (Naidu and Carr 2022).\n\nEmployees’ dependence on their employers for life’s necessities, coupled with the at-will default, means that employers can often exercise vast authority over their employees’ lives, including their speech and association. Consider the following examples:\n\nUnionized workers were compelled to choose between attending a Trump rally, using a day of paid time off, or staying home without pay; workers who chose to attend were apparently cautioned not to do or say anything that could be “viewed as resistance” (Allyn 2019). Of course, these choices might have been even tougher if the workers had not been protected by a union contract; in 2012, a group of nonunion mineworkers said they were ordered to “give up a day’s pay” in order to attend a Mitt Romney campaign event (Bradford 2017).\n\nWorkers have been fired for expressing support for the political candidates not supported by their bosses. For example, a worker reported that she was fired because she had a Kerry-Edwards bumper sticker; her boss was a Bush supporter (Noah 2004). Juli Briskman, the marketing analyst who in 2017 communicated her disdain for Trump administration policies by flipping off a presidential motorcade, was fired, reportedly for violating a “company policy banning obscene content on social media” (Cassens Weiss 2018). Briskman sued, but her case was dismissed because Virginia, like nearly all states, is an at-will jurisdiction.\n\nWorkers may also face pressure from their bosses to donate to or vote for a particular candidate. Mitt Romney famously encouraged this practice, telling business owners to “make it very clear to your employees what you believe is in the best interest of your enterprise and therefore their job and their future in the upcoming elections.” He noted that there was “nothing illegal about you talking to your employees about what you believe is best for the business, because I think that will figure into their election decision, their voting decision, and of course doing that with your family and your kids as well” (Phelan 2012). In fact, one in four private-sector employees said in a 2015 survey that they received political messages or requests from their bosses (Hertel-Fernandez 2018).\n\nA worker was required to take part in Bible study during working hours and was told he would be fired if he refused. This was likely illegal, but the worker, who had served time in prison, was “fearful that he wouldn’t be able to find other work,” so he “stuck with the weekly, hourlong Bible study sessions for six months” (Green 2018).\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, workers lost their jobs for raising questions about whether their workplaces were putting them (or members of the public) in danger (see, e.g., Stone 2020; Scheiber and Rosenthal 2020), and others were prohibited from revealing their own positive COVID diagnoses to their coworkers (Eidelson 2020).\n\nOn the other hand, there is some expression for which employers cannot legally fire their employees. For example, employers cannot fire employees for reporting discrimination to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or for discussing their respective salaries in the workplace breakroom; retaliating against employees in these situations would violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the National Labor Relations Act, respectively. These examples reflect how the at-will default has been modified by federal, state, or local laws that protect from employer retaliation certain kinds of worker expression. Employees and employers can also modify the at-will default by contract, a reality reflected in most collective bargaining agreements—though only a small minority of American workers are covered by them.\n\nThese exceptions mean that whether an employer is constrained from firing an employee because of something the employee has said turns on three main questions. The first is whether the employee is protected by an individual contract or a collective bargaining agreement that overrides that at-will default, and instead sets out specific conditions that must exist before a worker can be disciplined or fired. The second is whether there is a legal rule that protects the employee by creating an exception to the at-will default and, if so, whether there is an enforcement mechanism that is available to the employee as a practical matter. And the third is whether individual workers have market leverage—for example, is the employee too difficult to replace, or will the employee’s coworkers go on strike?\n\nToo often, employees will find that none of the answers to these questions works in their favor. Others will not even know which questions to ask and will instead simply decide to remain quiet, fearing that if they say something that angers the boss, they might lose their jobs. This course represents potentially a loss to workers themselves, as well as to their larger workplace and political communities (Eidelson 2020). Some of these larger losses are easy to recognize: workers who fear employer retaliation might not speak out about harassment they are experiencing; they might not learn that they have a shared workplace complaint that they could jointly raise with their boss; they might not blow the whistle about dangerous or illegal company practices; and they might not speak up about an idea that would make the workplace run more efficiently. Other harms can be harder to see; for example, Cynthia Estlund has persuasively argued that “the workplace is the location where people come together for purposive, cooperative activity and where they gain or lose much of their sense of community and of self-worth” (Estlund 1995, 108). That insight highlights the moral and political dimensions of workers’ freedom of speech.\n\nA meaningful freedom of speech for workers could come from two places. First, workers could have enough individual or collective power to secure their employers’ commitments to discipline or fire workers only for good reasons—that is, only when the worker has meaningfully harmed the employer or the employee’s coworkers. And, as the next section of this paper discusses, some U.S. workers have done just that through unionization and collective bargaining, or even through individual negotiations. But the vast majority of workers do not have contractual protections and instead have to rely on a second pathway to freedom of speech: a combination of whatever power they can muster in the moment, their employers’ sense of propriety, and—importantly—a patchwork of legal rules that prohibit employers from taking action against employees in certain circumstances. The bulk of this paper is taken up with explaining some of these rules and illustrating why they do not add up to meaningful free speech for workers. That is, employers are often able to suppress their employees’ speech on and off the job in the private sector and, to a lesser extent, the public sector.\n\nThis paper begins by discussing workers who often do have meaningful protections against employment consequences for their speech, either because of contractual commitments or because they live in one of a small number of U.S. jurisdictions that have reversed the at-will presumption. Then, it turns to legal rules that take certain worker statuses and activities out of the at-will arena. It begins with the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which undergirds both unionized and nonunionized workers’ collective power by protecting private-sector employees’ “concerted activity,” including speech related to working conditions—though with significant limitations. Among those limits: the law protects only “concerted” activity involving multiple employees; it applies only to topics with a sufficient nexus to the workplace; and workers can lose protection if they pursue collective action outside approved pathways. In addition, the NLRA imposes few constraints on employers, who are free to require employees to listen to a near-constant barrage of anti-union messages as long as those messages do not rise to the level of coercion.\n\nNext, the paper turns to particular topics that can place employees at heightened risk of employer retaliation, such as employee speech about their own working conditions, the employer’s misdeeds, or the employee’s religious, social, or political views and beliefs. Importantly, there exist legal protections that cover employees’ speech on these topics, though, as the paper discusses, these protections are full of holes. For example, a long list of statutes provides at least some protection for employee whistleblowing—provided employees tell the right audience about what they have discovered. Likewise, workplace protections such as those found in anti-discrimination law are typically coupled with protections against employer retaliation, though these protections also have limitations that can be counterintuitive.\n\nThis report focuses on types of employee speech that can have considerable social value in addition to reflecting employees’ own autonomy interests; often, that social value is reflected in the fact that Congress, state legislatures, or other government bodies have established at least a degree of protection from the harshness of the at-will default when workers engage in these types of speech. Conversely, this report does not discuss some other types of worker speech over which employers often exert significant control. For example, employees’ job duties often involve speech—for example, a fast-food restaurant might require its cashiers to attempt to upsell customers to a larger size meal. Additionally, some worker speech harms others; for example, harassing speech, which can trigger employer liability under some circumstances. But even when liability is not on the table, employees may sometimes find their coworkers’ speech to be upsetting or annoying, and employers may be called upon to mediate these disputes. This paper touches only briefly on these issues.\n\nSome readers might be surprised that a report about workers’ freedom to speak without facing employment consequences has not yet mentioned the First Amendment. Because the First Amendment constrains only government, not private individuals or entities, the First Amendment is not implicated when a private employer fires employees for their speech. However, the paper does close with two observations about First Amendment law as it relates to worker speech. First, public employees have limited First Amendment protections against being fired by their government employers when they speak as citizens, though these protections rarely cover public employees’ speech about their working conditions. Second, private employers can invoke the First Amendment when the government regulates their speech, which means there is a risk that courts will strike down government regulation of employer speech even when the regulation is intended to promote employee freedom. For example, if Congress amended the NLRA to require employers to remain neutral about the possibility of employee unionization, courts might then conclude that the change violates employers’ First Amendment rights, even though it would also promote employees’ speech and association.\n\nFor at-will employees, the threat of employment consequences for their speech is considerably greater than the threat of government censorship. There exists a list of legal rules intended to constrain employers, but a combination of employer-friendly exceptions and the difficulties of enforcing rights means that employers retain extensive practical ability to punish workers for speech of which employers disapprove. Freedoms that many Americans hold dear thus stop at the boss’s door.\n\nII. Reversing the at-will default\n\nWhat do the examples in the introduction to this report have in common? They each involve speech: an employer either pressured its employees to express or suppress certain views, or punished an employee after the fact because of something the employee said. But at a higher level of abstraction, we might say that these examples each reflect the “bad reason” prong of the standard at-will formulation. These employees either were fired for a bad reason, or they were told to comply with a capricious or unjust workplace rule on pain of being fired (for a bad reason). Put this way, employer control over employee speech is one manifestation of employers’ control over workers generally.\n\nIf employer control over employee speech is a symptom, and the at-will rule is the diagnosis, then the cure would be to change the at-will default to one in which workers can be disciplined or fired only for “just cause.” Or, as Cynthia Estlund put it, “[d]ue process, in the form of a ‘just cause’ requirement for discharge and a fair hearing, would both bolster the existing protections of highly valued employee speech and, incidentally, generate some protection for less exalted forms of speech that simply do not justify the extreme sanction of discharge” (Estlund 1995, 104; see also Estlund 1996).\n\nWhat counts as just cause can be malleable, but two commentators described the concept like this: “Just cause…embodies the idea that the employee is entitled to continued employment, provided he attends work regularly, obeys work rules, performs at some reasonable level of quality and quantity, and refrains from interfering with his employer’s business by his activities on or off the job” (Abrams and Nolan 1985, 594). This standard does not equate to absolute protection for workers’ speech and association, but it does mean that workers cannot be disciplined or fired simply because they have expressed an opinion with which their boss disagrees. Instead, the employer will have to demonstrate that the employee has actually harmed the employers’ legitimate interests.\n\nFor a relatively small number of private-sector workers in American workplaces, this concept is already a reality: they are covered by a contract that contains just-cause protections, or they work in one of the small number of U.S. jurisdictions that have legislatively changed the at-will default. This section briefly describes contractual and statutory just-cause protections. It offers several reasons that they can be a useful and durable source of employment protection for employees, especially when coupled with enforcement mechanisms that mean workers do not have to rely on expensive and uncertain litigation or individual arbitration to enforce their rights. This discussion will also provide a backdrop for the next section, which turns to legal protections that limit the extent to which employers can fire or discipline employees for specific categories of expression.\n\nA. Contractual just-cause protections and employee speech\n\nSome private-sector workers benefit from contractual protection against termination for arbitrary or bad reasons. Tenured college professors fall into this category, as do workers who have negotiated employment contracts that list specific grounds on which the employer can terminate the contract. But these are the exception rather than the norm; there is no requirement that an employment relationship be memorialized in a written contract, and most U.S. employees work without one. Other employees may benefit from “implied” contracts, which are created when the employer makes a unilateral promise regarding the employment relationship, but, again, these are relatively rare, especially because employers can draft employment documents to avoid making any contractual incursions on at-will employment. Finally some employees—though only about 6% of private-sector workers—are covered by collective bargaining agreements, which are the main focus of this section (BLS 2022).\n\nCollective bargaining agreements commonly overturn the presumption of at-will employment by including just-cause protections from termination. These provisions can vary in their language but are often quite straightforward. For example, the United Auto Workers’ collective bargaining agreement with Ford Motor Company states simply that Ford “retains the sole right to discipline and discharge employees for cause, provided that in the exercise of this right it will not act wrongfully or unjustly or in violation of the terms of this Agreement” (UAW and Ford Motor Company 2019, 17). Further, collective bargaining agreements may require progressive discipline for lesser infractions and require that disciplinary infractions be wiped from an employee’s slate after a period of time. And they typically include procedural protections; for example, most collective bargaining agreements include a grievance process that a union or employee can use to challenge discipline imposed without justification, and labor law requires employers to allow unionized employees to have a union representative present during interviews that may lead to discipline.\n\nTwo features make collectively bargained just-cause provisions especially meaningful. First, the employer typically has the burden to show that it had just cause. Second, primary responsibility for enforcing a collective-bargaining agreement rests with the union, rather than individual employees. Unions, unlike individual employee plaintiffs, then become repeat players with enforcement expertise developed over time. Moreover, they are usually considerably better resourced than individual employees, perhaps even employing an attorney who does nothing but handle grievances arising under the union’s collective bargaining agreements. Thus, whereas employers often violate statutory labor and employment law with impunity because of barriers to effective enforcement, the enforcement of just-cause collective bargaining agreements can and should be routine.\n\nB. Statutory good-cause protections\n\nA small number of U.S. jurisdictions have overturned the at-will presumption by statute. Montana is the only state to do so; in addition, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands have passed similar laws, as has New York City with respect to fast-food workers and Philadelphia with respect to parking attendants. While these laws are similar in that they restrict employers from terminating employees without a good reason, there are some important enforcement-related differences that bear on their effectiveness. This section briefly compares the Montana statute to the New York City one.\n\nMontana’s law requires that private-sector employers have “good cause” to fire employees, with good cause defined as “any reasonable job-related grounds for an employee’s dismissal based on” the employees’ “failure to satisfactorily perform job duties”; “disruption of the employer’s operation”; “material or repeated violation of an express provision of the employer’s written policies”; or “other legitimate business reasons.” The law is enforced by employees through litigation in state courts or in arbitration, and employees can recover damages, subject to some important limits.\n\nNew York City’s law prohibits fast-food employers from firing workers without just cause, which the statue defines as “the fast food employee’s failure to satisfactorily perform job duties or misconduct that is demonstrably and materially harmful to the fast food employer’s legitimate business interests.” Additionally, the law mimics many collective bargaining agreements by requiring employers to follow a written progressive discipline policy in non-“egregious” cases. Other provisions make it harder for employers to evade the law by, for example, using layoffs or hours reductions to disguise decisions to terminate without good cause. And, as to enforcement, “any person, including any organization, alleging a violation” may file a lawsuit or demand a specialized arbitration process, and the city’s law department can also undertake enforcement proceedings against repeat violators.\n\nRequiring that employers have good cause to terminate or discipline an employee can be a significant source of protection for workers. But not all good-cause provisions are created equal: as the preceding paragraphs describe, Montana’s law is weaker than New York City’s on substance, and it is also harder to enforce. In other words, New York City’s law comes closer to replicating the protections that usually come with effective union representation, which means it has the potential to do more than the Montana law to deter employers from treating employees arbitrarily or with bad cause.\n\nThe at-will default is a central reason that employers can fire workers because of their speech, even when that speech does not harm production. Contractual or statutory just-cause protections can be an effective way to get to the root of the problem, especially when their enforcement mechanism is well-designed.\n\nIII. Legal protections for (some categories of) worker speech\n\nAnother approach to protecting valuable speech by workers is for legislatures to enact (or state courts to recognize in their decisions) protections for specific categories of worker speech. For example, labor law protects workers’ rights to join together to speak out about labor conditions; employment discrimination law protects workers who oppose discrimination at work; and whistleblower laws protect workers who report corporate wrongdoing to the authorities. Where these statutes apply, employers may not leverage their economic power over employees to demand silence. However, as discussed below, there are pitfalls to this approach: these statutory protections can apply in unpredictable ways, and, even where they apply, enforcement can be difficult or ineffective.\n\nThis section is organized around several types of worker speech that have (or at least may have) social value but that many employers would like to suppress. The discussion that follows is not intended to be a comprehensive treatise on legal protections for employees but instead to illustrate two general ideas: first, that there exists tremendous variation in the extent to which law protects workers’ speech; and second, that even within protected categories of worker speech, it is easy for workers to fall through the cracks, losing statutory protection and reverting to the at-will default.\n\nThe section begins with a fairly detailed discussion of the NLRA and its protection for workers’ collective action, before moving on to other topics. The extended discussion of the NLRA is partially illustrative—an example of how even broadly drafted statutory protections can leave workers to navigate a confusing array of exceptions and qualifications. It is also intended to give readers a more complete sense of how the landmark federal statute that is aimed at increasing workers’ bargaining power functions to protect (or not) workers’ speech about their working conditions.\n\nA. Workers’ rights to criticize their working conditions and organize for improvements in those conditions\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has been disruptive for everyone, essential frontline service workers have had to cope with especially dangerous and challenging conditions, risking their health to ensure that essential services continued. While some employers moved quickly to make their workplaces safer, others took a more lackadaisical approach. Especially in the latter scenario, workers often responded by demanding that their employers do more to keep them safe and also to recognize the burdens of work during the pandemic by increasing pay, improving sick leave, and more.\n\nBut employers sometimes responded to these requests by firing the “troublemakers.” For example, when Ben Bonnema and one of his coworkers became concerned about ventilation and unmasked customers at the Trader Joe’s where they worked, they wrote a letter to the company’s chief executive officer (CEO) requesting specific improvements; Bonnema’s boss then fired him with a written termination notice that invoked Bonnema’s “at-will” status and claimed Bonnema’s suggestions were “not in line with company values” (Shammas and Knowles 2021).\n\nBonnema’s situation is not unique. Though particulars differ from case to case, it is distressingly common for employees who work together to try to improve their pay or other working conditions to be fired, disciplined, or reprimanded. In these scenarios, the employer’s response serves a double purpose: getting rid of a squeaky wheel, and sending a message to other employees about the costs of expressing discontent.\n\nBonnema’s situation had a happy ending: after he tweeted about being fired, a labor lawyer offered to help. Soon after, Trader Joe’s agreed to reinstate Bonnema and take other remedial steps. This remedy was available because the National Labor Relations Act guarantees workers, even nonunion workers, the right to act together to improve their wages and working conditions—exactly what Bonnema and his coworker did when they wrote to the CEO.\n\nThis section focuses on the NLRA and discusses statutory limits to the at-will rule that apply when private-sector workers try to improve their working conditions. However, there are also significant limitations to the NLRA’s protection, and workers are vulnerable to discipline or discharge when they act outside the boundaries of that protection.\n\nOne caveat: in discussing the boundaries of the NLRA protection for workers’ speech and association, this section tells only part of the story. Courts have also undermined the NLRA’s protection for workers’ collective action by limiting the remedies available when employers violate the NLRA, authorizing employers to counter employees’ collective action with solidarity-destroying tactics, and more.\n\n1. Collective voice at work: The NLRA and its limits\n\nThe National Labor Relations Act is one of the most important protections for private-sector employees’ speech. The 1935 statute declares that “inequality of bargaining power between employees who do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract” burdens the economy, including by “depressing wage rates and the purchasing power of wage earners in industry.” The NLRA’s solution—employee organizing and collective bargaining—is rooted in employees’ abilities to communicate about their working conditions with each other, their employers, and the public. Thus, § 7 of the NLRA states that employees have the right to engage in “concerted activities” for “mutual aid or protection,” and § 8(a)(1) of the act makes it illegal for employers to “interfere with, restrain, or coerce” employees who are exercising their § 7 rights. Importantly, this provision applies to both union and nonunion employees, making the NLRA an important source of protection for covered employees’ organizing to improve their own working conditions.\n\nAt the same time, the NLRA’s limitations are many and varied. The statutory language is limited to employees’ “concerted activities for…mutual aid or protection,” meaning that workers’ speech can fall through the cracks if it is not collective, if it is targeted at a concern that is not workplace-related, or if it is not action-oriented. And courts interpreting the NLRA have sided with employer interests on some critically important questions, blunting the statute’s potential to level the playing field between employers and employees. Taken together, these limitations also make it virtually impossible for workers to rely on their intuitions about when or how the NLRA might protect them.\n\na. The ‘connectedness’ requirement\n\nIn general, the NLRA protects only “concerted activity,” that is, activity that involves at least two employees. This might look like Ben Bonnema and his coworker sending their letter, a strike or picket line, a petition expressing dissatisfaction with a new company policy, or two employees revealing their salaries to one another, perhaps because they suspect the employer is systematically underpaying workers of color. But an employee’s individual workplace advocacy usually will not qualify as collective action, though there are some exceptions.\n\nSurprisingly, some conversations between multiple employees also do not qualify as concerted if the board feels the employees were merely “griping.” This caveat might seem unimportant, but low-stakes workplace social interactions can set the stage for other forms of collective action. As Michael Oswalt put it, workers generally need to develop relationships and build trust before they will pursue collective action: “the subtle shift from ‘I hate this,’ to ‘We hate this’ [could] prompt a worker to think about starting a petition drive before barging into a supervisor’s office alone” (Oswalt 2017, 1002). And an employer who disciplines a worker for griping unmistakably sends a message about workplace control; it would take considerable bravery for a worker to engage in protective concerted activity after seeing a coworker fired for griping.\n\nb. The ‘for mutual aid or protection’ requirement\n\nThe NLRA’s second requirement focuses on employees’ goals, asking whether employees are trying to “improve terms and conditions of employment or otherwise improve their lot as employees.” Many topics obviously qualify—for example, collective action that relates to pay, workplace safety, or employer discrimination all meet this requirement.\n\nPolitical issues that relate to working conditions are also in bounds: in the foundational decision Eastex v. NLRB, the Supreme Court agreed that the NLRA protected distribution of a union newsletter that urged workers to oppose a “right-to-work” amendment to the Texas Constitution, highlighted President Nixon’s recent veto of a minimum wage increase, and generally encouraged workers to “defeat our enemies and elect our friends” at the ballot box. The court deferred to the NLRB’s assessment that these political initiatives could have indirect effects on working conditions, writing that “[t]he Board was entitled to note the widely recognized impact that a rise in the minimum wage may have on the level of negotiated wages generally,” as well as that a constitutionally enshrined right-to-work law would be harder to change than a statutory one.\n\nThis relatively broad approach to defining “mutual aid” means that employees’ collective action related to political topics can be protected by the NLRA as long as there is a tie between the topic and working conditions. Immigration law is a salient example, as illustrated by “Day Without Immigrants” protests that took place in 2006 and 2017. These protests were intended to highlight the importance of immigrant workers to the functioning of the U.S. economy; workers from all over the country missed work to participate, some with their employers’ permission and some without.\n\nFollowing each protest, the NLRB’s general counsel (GC) analyzed whether employers had violated the NLRA when they fired workers for missing work to join the protests. (The board’s GC is its chief prosecutor; a GC’s views are important in part because they guide what cases the office will take and what arguments the GC’s office will make. However, the GC’s views do not bind the board or the public.) Importantly, both GCs (a Republican-appointed GC analyzing the 2006 protests and a Democratic GC analyzing those in 2017) agreed that workers’ advocacy on immigration policy did fall within the scope of the mutual aid or protection clause. But they disagreed about whether employers were nonetheless free to enforce their attendance rules when workers missed work to attend the protests. The first analysis (conducted by the Republican GC) concluded that employers could enforce their attendance rules because the demonstrations were not strikes over an issue that the employer could remedy. The second memo (issued by the Democratic GC) reached the opposite conclusion. Thus, while at least some forms of collective action related to immigration are protected by the NLRA, there is risk that that this protection will not extend to all tactics.\n\nWhile Eastex is relatively broad, some issues of great importance to workers can nonetheless fall outside the NLRA’s bounds. For example, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that workers who were members of an “outside” political advocacy group were not protected by the NLRA when they distributed the group’s literature at work, even though the group’s goals—ending mandatory workplace drug testing—related to a disputed issue at the workplace in question. And in another case, the NLRB decided that employees were not protected when they advocated for the employee stock option plan to acquire a majority share in the employer’s parent company, writing that the proposal did “not advance employees’ interests as employees but rather advances employees’ interests as entrepreneurs, owners, and managers.” This distinction between managerial interests and working conditions may also arise in a case against Google, which involves two worker-organizers who were fired after circulating a petition regarding the company’s potential collaboration with the U.S. Customs and Border Control agency. The case was pending as of this writing; it seems likely that the board will have to resolve whether the NLRA protects advocacy aimed at influencing an organization’s direction or choice of clients.\n\n2. Concerted activity that loses NLRA protection\n\nThe discussion in the previous section illustrates how the NLRA provides meaningful-but-limited protection for workers’ collective action related to working conditions. But workers can lose NLRA protection if they choose the wrong place, the wrong time, or the wrong manner in which to express themselves. In particular, courts interpreting the NLRA have allowed employers to insist on loyalty, decorum, and productivity, reflecting what James Atelson has described as “deeply held judicial feelings about the contractual or status obligations of employees as well as the rights of property” (Atelson 1983, 5).\n\nBecause of these limitations, employees often have no recourse if they are fired for collective action that falls into any of the following categories:\n\nThe message is deemed “disloyal, reckless, or maliciously untrue”\n\nThe message is expressed using “opprobrious” language\n\nThe employees use materials belonging to the employer, possibly even including the employer’s computer or email system, to express their message\n\nAn employee solicits another employee to sign a union card during “working time”\n\nEmployees picket in order to seek support from a “secondary” employer, that is, a company that does business with the workers’ employer.\n\nThis section briefly discusses these limitations, each of which can impede workers from effectively building solidarity with each other or with potential allies, such as consumers of the products the workers create. Despite the NLRA’s stated protections, there remain many situations in which courts defer to employer authority, allowing workers to be disciplined for their speech.\n\na. Disloyalty\n\nThe disloyalty doctrine comes from a case known as Jefferson Standard, which arose out of a breakdown in collective bargaining negotiations between the union representing a group of technicians and their employer, a television and radio broadcaster. The employees picketed (but did not strike) for about six weeks, and then began to circulate a new handbill, which the Supreme Court later characterized as a “vitriolic attack.” It read:\n\nIs Charlotte A Second-Class City?\n\nYou might think so from the kind of Television programs being presented by the Jefferson Standard Broadcasting Co. over WBTV. Have you seen one of their television programs lately? Did you know that all the programs presented over WBTV are on film and may be from one day to five years old. There are no local programs presented by WBTV. You cannot receive the local baseball games, football games or other local events because WBTV does not have the proper equipment to make these pickups. Cities like New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington receive such programs nightly.\n\nWhy doesn’t the Jefferson Standard Broadcasting Company purchase the needed equipment to bring you the same type of programs enjoyed by other leading American cities? Could it be that they consider Charlotte a second-class community and only entitled to the pictures now being presented to them?\n\nWBT Technicians\n\nThe company fired 10 technicians because of this handbill. In the letter of termination, the employer did not contest the handbill’s factual statements; instead, it took the view that “[c]ertainly we are not required by law or common sense to keep you in our employment and pay you a substantial salary while you thus do your best to tear down and bankrupt our business.”\n\nThe NLRB acknowledged that the technicians’ statements in the handbill either were true or at least were not known to be false. But the board nonetheless decided that the technicians lost NLRA protection because their conduct was “indefensible,” analogizing to union tactics such as sit-down strikes, sabotage, and strike-related violence. The Supreme Court agreed, writing that the “company’s letter shows that it interpreted the handbill as a demonstration of such detrimental disloyalty as to provide ‘cause’ for its refusal to continue in its employ the perpetrators of the attack. We agree.”\n\nThere is much to criticize about the court’s reasoning, but the bottom line is that the Jefferson Standard rule continues to leave workers engaged in collective action vulnerable to discipline or termination by their employers. The recent case Miklin Enterprises, Inc. v. NLRB shows how. The case began when a group of employees placed posters on “community bulletin boards” in the employer’s restaurants. These posters showed two identical pictures of Jimmy Johns sandwiches, indicating that one was made by a healthy worker and the other by a sick worker. The text at the bottom of the poster read:\n\nCAN’T TELL THE DIFFERENCE? THAT’S TOO BAD BECAUSE JIMMY JOHN’S WORKERS DON’T GET PAID SICK DAYS. SHOOT, WE CAN’T EVEN CALL IN SICK. WE HOPE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM IS READY BECAUSE YOU’RE ABOUT TO TAKE THE SANDWICH TEST.\n\nFollowing that and other speech along similar lines, the company then fired six employees who, as the Eighth Circuit put it, “coordinated the attack,” and issued warnings to three others.\n\nWhile the NLRB concluded that the workers had engaged in protected concerted activity because they did not have a “malicious motive,” the Eighth Circuit disagreed. In an en banc ruling—that is, a decision issued by the full Eighth Circuit rather than a panel of three judges—the court concluded that employee speech was “disloyal” if it “indefensibly disparaged the quality of the employer’s product or services,” characterizing the workers’ health-related statements as “equivalent of a nuclear bomb.”\n\nThis rule can get in the way of the kinds of worker-consumer coalitions that can be critical to workers achieving their goals. An important way to generate community support is to show how working conditions affect consumers’ experiences in a business. This was the gist of the Jimmy Johns campaign—that making it difficult or impossible for workers to take time off work when they were sick was bad for workers and consumers alike. Yet this kind of argument will often focus on the product or service that the workers make or provide, meaning that workers will run the risk that decisionmakers will ultimately find the criticism was “disloyal”—causing them to lose NLRA protection and allowing them to be fired.\n\nb. Opprobrious speech\n\nCollective action sometimes takes the form of a spontaneous, outraged response to something the employer has just said or done. But with emotions running high, employees might use profane or insulting language, in which case an employer might insist that it has a right to terminate the employee for breaching workplace civility rules. As with disloyalty, there is not a bright-line definition of what counts as opprobrious—there is no list of words that are out of bounds. Instead, until recently, the NLRB addressed these cases by focusing on the setting and the circumstances of employee speech. However, in 2020, the Trump NLRB announced a new approach that is more deferential to employers regardless of setting, permitting them to prioritize workplace civility over employees’ concerted activity. This case, known as General Motors, will likely be reversed by the Biden board. Still, it is worth further discussion for two reasons: first, it reflects the instability of even relatively well-established legal protections for employee speech; and second, it illustrates how employers can weaponize workplace civility rules when they create upsetting situations and then punish workers for becoming upset.\n\nUp until 2020, the NLRB used rules developed in three different contexts: picket-line speech, speech on social media, and workplace conversations with management. The particulars differed, but these cases generally recognized both that fraught workplace situations can lead to heightened emotions and intemperate comments, and also that managers cannot always be trusted to act in good faith—for example, an employer looking to fire a strike organizer might feign offense at language usually tolerated in the particular workplace. Under this approach, employees would generally lose the protection of the NLRA only if their speech crossed the line from heated to threatening or abusive.\n\nHowever, the Trump board’s General Motors decision replaced these three separate approaches with a test that is considerably less protective of employee speech and more deferential to employer concerns. The case involved three suspensions of an employee, Robinson, who also served as a union committeeperson. (There were some disputes about the underlying events that led to these suspensions; this discussion relies on the board’s statement of those events.) In the first incident, Robinson swore at a manager during a dispute about whether the manager had gone back on an agreement to pay overtime to a group of employees participating in a training. In the second, a manager told Robinson that he was speaking too loudly during a meeting about subcontracting out work; Robinson reportedly responded by saying “’Yes, Master, Your Master Anthony,’ ‘Yes, sir, Master Anthony,’ ‘Is that what you want me to do, Master Anthony?,’ and also stated that the supervisor wanted him ‘to be a good Black man.’” In the third incident, Robinson said he would “mess [a manager] up” during a disagreement that arose in a meeting about shift and staffing changes, and later in the meeting played loud music that the NLRB described as “profane, racially charged, and sexually offensive.”\n\nRather than analyzing the circumstances surrounding each exchange, the NLRB asked whether Robinson was fired because his employer objected to his profanity or instead because of his union affiliation or workplace advocacy. The reasoning in support of this change relied in part on “tension” between labor and anti-discrimination law; the problem, according to the board, was that the board’s existing rules tied employers’ hands, preventing them from responding to speech that could ultimately result in a hostile workplace. But the General Motors rule goes beyond racist or sexist harassment, conflating harassment with uncivil speech and using the specter of anti-discrimination law to empower employers to police employees’ legitimate grievances that are expressed using rude, profane, or obnoxious language.\n\nConsider Robinson’s second suspension, which the company said was imposed because of Robinson’s response to a manager’s comment that Robinson should lower his voice. First, the context was apparently fraught. Robinson testified that management was proposing to subcontract work while also stonewalling Robinson’s requests for information about the subcontractors’ costs and “work hours and shifts for the bargaining unit employees.” And, to be sure, Robinson’s response to the request that he lower his voice was sarcastic—perhaps he thought the supervisor was “tone policing,” or perhaps he thought the supervisor would not have been so concerned about the volume of a white employee’s voice. Despite this, the NLRB used the phrases “racially offensive” and “racially charged” to characterize Robinson’s comments, obscuring the likelihood that Robinson was disciplined in part because he used sarcasm to indicate that he thought he was being treated poorly because of his race.\n\nThis chain of events reflects how deference to employers can disproportionately harm workers of color, notwithstanding the General Motors board’s stated concern for hostile work environments. First, workers of color are more likely that white workers to be subjected to bad treatment (including racist treatment) by their bosses, resulting in more occasions where an employee might (understandably) respond to a situation in anger. Second, managers are more likely to misperceive workers of color to be behaving aggressively as compared to white workers, and they may then impose discipline based on this misperception. And even managers who believe themselves to be enforcing civility rules in an even-handed manner may be acting on implicit biases. Thus, while workplace civility rules are sometimes justified based on workers’ rights to be free of abusive or harassing treatment while at work, they can also be weaponized against workers who are trying to respond to upsetting situations.\n\nc. Collective action in the ‘wrong’ time or place\n\nIn addition to the substantive limitations on protected concerted activity, there are also limits on where and when that activity may occur. These limits fall into two general categories. The first category concerns employees who are trying to organize inside their own workplace: workers may engage in protected concerted activity during breaks and other downtime, but employers can also insist that “working time is for work.” The second category concerns workers who engage in collective action on the premises of a company that does not employ them, including labor organizers who work for unions, as well as “fissured” employees,” i.e., those who are not technically employed at the place where they spend their work days because of subcontracting and other contractual relationships. Both sets of rules reflect assumptions that prioritize employers’ property and managerial interests, leaving holes in the NLRA’s protections for worker speech.\n\ni. Space and time limitations on organizing at work\n\nIt only makes sense for workplace organizing to take place at work. This organizing might take the shape of conversations between coworkers; handing out union cards and other written material; or wearing union buttons or T-shirts. The NLRA protects all of these activities—but with limitations. The rules consist primarily of a set of default presumptions that govern different types of activity. Under these defaults, workers can wear union T-shirts or insignia at any time; they can solicit their coworkers’ support for unionization and have other § 7-protected conversations only during nonwork time; and they can distribute union cards or other literature only during nonwork time and in nonwork areas of the workplace. But employers may impose more restrictive rules if they can prove “special circumstances” justifying them.\n\nEmployers have even more freedom to control how workers use supplies that the employer owns. For example, employees generally have no right to use the office photocopier to produce flyers about an upcoming union rally, nor may they appropriate space on the office bulletin board to post one of these flyers. This rule might seem intuitive as applied to scarce or expensive supplies, but the board has also applied it to computers, servers, and even employees’ work-issued email addresses. (This is another issue on which the board has oscillated, with the Obama board holding that employees who had access to their employer’s email system had a presumptive right to use that system for concerted activity during nonwork time, only to be reversed by the Trump board in 2019. )\n\nThere is a caveat that pertains to the solicitation and distribution presumptions as well as to the rule that employers can restrict the use of their own equipment: employers may not discriminate against union speech. At a minimum, this means that while an employer may broadly insist that “working time is for work,” it may not (for example) allow workers to express anti-union viewpoints while simultaneously prohibiting pro-union viewpoints. But the board has historically taken this nondiscrimination rule further, to reach employers who ban any union-related communication while allowing similar expression on other topics. Note, though, that even this broader nondiscrimination rule did not require parity between employers and employees: an employer that barred its employees from talking about unionization or any other cause over company email could still send its own anti-union message via email.\n\nThese space-and-time limitations have only become more significant during the coronavirus pandemic. For example, when the Trump board held that employees’ use of their work email addresses was not protected by § 7, it suggested that in-person communication would be “adequate” to allow workers to communicate with each other about their working conditions. That assumption was already flawed for workers who did not routinely share space with their coworkers; now, those consequences are multiplied because so many more employees work from home. Moreover, even workers who go into the office may find that in-person communication has become more difficult, especially where employers have closed breakrooms or changed schedules because of social-distancing concerns. Despite the NLRA’s broadly drafted protection for concerted activity, these employees may find themselves with few workable methods of communicating with each other about their working conditions.\n\nii. Workplace fissuring and NLRA protections for workers’ speech\n\nThe rules discussed in the previous subsection apply to workers whose collective action takes place on their own employers’ premises. But many people spend their working time at job sites with which they do not have an employment relationship. For example, consider janitors who clean a downtown building each night: the building’s management may employ the janitors directly, or it may have contracted for their services. If the latter is true, then another company formally employs the janitors and bears responsibility for paying wages and complying with employment law. “Fissured” arrangements like this one can contribute to worsening working conditions while also limiting employees’ recourse to NLRA-protected collective action to improve their situations.\n\nWhether subcontracted employees have the same § 7 rights at their worksite as do traditional employees is another issue where the board has oscillated: the Obama board answered this question “yes”; the Trump board said the opposite, allowing property owners to exclude off-duty subcontracted employees from their worksite. The latter approach means that a property owner may bar subcontracted employees from coming to the worksite when they are not scheduled to work, effectively preventing them from talking to their coworkers on other shifts about working conditions.\n\nFurther, workers can be left unprotected when their collective action under § 8(b) of the NLRA counts as “secondary”—that is, picket lines or strikes aimed at influencing an entity other than the employer with whom there is a labor dispute. § 8(b) is mainly about restrictions on unions, but whereas unions that violate these provisions can face injunctions and money damages, participating workers can also lose the NLRA’s protection. Precisely what counts as prohibited secondary activity is beyond the scope of this paper, but it is worth noting that this prohibition can leave subcontracted employees with less protection than their peers in traditional employment relationships. For example, if hotel cleaners who technically work for a subcontractor become irate about harassment and low pay, they may want to picket in front of the hotel where they work, but if they run afoul of the byzantine secondary activity rules they could be fired without recourse. In contrast, housekeepers who are employed directly by the hotel would be on firmer footing. In other words, an employer’s decisions about how to structure its workforces have a direct bearing on workers’ rights to organize for better treatment.\n\nThe NLRA is a significant exception to the at-will default; it was intended to level the playing field between workers and employers by protecting workers’ ability to band together to demand better working conditions. But, as this section has discussed, there are significant gaps in the NLRA’s coverage, and employers can sometimes override the NLRA’s protections if employee speech is deemed too disruptive of employer interests. Thus, while of the various statutes discussed in this section the NLRA provides the most comprehensive protection for worker speech, it does not undo the effects of the at-will default: workers are still often vulnerable to employer domination when they advocate for better treatment from their employers.\n\nB. Workers’ rights to report employer wrongdoing\n\nOne significant category of worker speech that employers might wish to suppress concerns the employer’s own wrongdoing. This wrongdoing might involve customers or regulators, as when a company suppresses information that its products might make people sick or that it is using dubious accounting practices to hide financial losses from investors. It could also involve employees’ complaints that the employer’s treatment of them is illegal—for example, that the workplace is unsafe, or that the employer has discriminated based on an employee’s race or gender, or that the employer has failed to pay required overtime.\n\nThe three subsections that follow discuss two main topics. The first two concern legal protections for employee whistleblowers and statutory anti-retaliation provisions that protect workers when they complain about their employer’s unlawful treatment of them or their coworkers. (This is not intended to suggest that these are the only legal protections that employees could invoke in these circumstances; for example, the NLRA will often protect workers who band together to report their employers’ unlawful treatment of them, and some state courts will treat retaliatory terminations of whistleblowers as wrongful discharges in violation of public policy.) The third subsection turns to employers’ ability to contract for employees’ future silence through nondisclosure agreements (NDAs). These agreements are an important reason that legal protections for some types of employee speech may not be enough to encourage employees to speak up. Even though NDAs are sometimes unenforceable—including when they purport to override nonwaivable rights to report corporate misconduct to relevant authorities—employees who believe their NDAs to be enforceable will be reluctant to breach them.\n\n1. Whistleblower protections\n\nThere are dozens of whistleblower laws that apply to different kinds of employer conduct in different jurisdictions. These statutes usually protect employees under specifically defined circumstances, such as when they have reported a certain variety of corporate wrongdoing to the right audience, such as a government regulator. For example, the federal financial-fraud law known as Sarbanes-Oxley protects employees who provide information about suspected violations to law enforcement, members of Congress, or their own supervisors, as well as employees who participate in enforcement proceedings. Of course, Sarbanes-Oxley was drafted to guard against financial misdeeds, not to promote broader employee voice. Similarly, while state and federal law contains numerous anti-retaliation provisions—the Occupational Safety and Health Administration alone enforces 25 such provisions, which are found in statutes ranging from the Affordable Care Act to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to the Taxpayer First Act —it would be a mistake to think of them as mechanisms for general worker empowerment.\n\nStill, whistleblower protections are useful where they apply, and their scope of application can be broad or narrow. For example, consider New Jersey’s whistleblower statute, the Conscientious Employee Protection Act. The specifics of the law are less important than a sense of its breadth: it reaches employer retaliation against employees who report a wide range of problematic or illegal practices by their employers to a list of listeners that includes the employee’s supervisor, the government, entities that contract with the employer, shareholders, and so on. In contrast, New York’s whistleblower statute was, until 2021, comparatively narrow; it covered only employees who reported violations of New York labor and employment law, substantial public health threats, and a few other specific categories of information. (New York recently amended its statutes to closely track the New Jersey statute.)\n\nWhistleblowing is a category of speech where it is easy to see the connection between the employee’s interest and the public interest. However, whistleblower protections are inconsistent across jurisdictions and can turn on the subject of the report and the audience who receives it, making it hard for employees who are not advised by an attorney to know when they are on solid ground.\n\n2. Anti-retaliation protections for employees who oppose workplace discrimination\n\nSuppose an employee believes the employer has discriminated against a coworker based on that person’s race or gender. The employee might take action, for example, by filing a charge with the EEOC or a similar state agency. Alternatively, an employee might try to solve the problem internally, perhaps taking an employer up on its promise of an “open door policy.” What happens if the employer’s response is to retaliate?\n\nIf the employee takes action together with at least one coworker, then the NLRA likely protects them both. But employees who act without help from coworkers might still find protection. Anti-discrimination laws generally prohibit employers from retaliating against employees who report potential violations, either to the employer or an enforcement agency. Indeed, many federal, state, and local statutes intended to set baseline working conditions also prohibit employer retaliation against employees who report violations; the Fair Labor Standards Act, the NLRA, the Occupational Health and Safety Act, and their various state analogues are just a few examples. It would be impossible to canvas the various rules that apply to retaliation claims under all of these statutes; instead, this section uses Title VII as an example to illustrate how, even when they are backed by anti-retaliation protections, workers can still fall through the cracks.\n\nTitle VII prohibits employers from retaliating “because [an employee] has opposed any practice” that violates Title VII’s nondiscrimination provisions or “because [an employee] has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing” under Title VII. The first clause is referred to as the “opposition clause” and the second as the “participation clause.” (Near-identical provisions are found in the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. )\n\nThe participation clause protects employees who take part in EEOC proceedings (or those of a parallel state agency), including by filing a charge of discrimination or providing witness testimony. This protection is robust; the statute’s model of agency enforcement works only if employees are willing to come forward, and Congress and the courts have taken the view that when employees do come forward they should be protected (see Green 2014, 766). For example, the protection applies even if the agency ultimately decides not to take action based on a charge of discrimination.\n\nBut the opposition clause does not offer the same broad protection; instead, courts have interpreted the clause to cover only “reasonable” opposition. “Reasonableness” encompasses two important limitations: that the opposition be expressed in a reasonable manner, and that the complaining employee could reasonably believe the employer had violated Title VII.\n\nWith regard to the first limitation, many courts have held that employers may discipline or fire workers who express their opposition to workplace discrimination in a disruptive or insubordinate fashion, as well as those who merely “gripe” about discrimination; these cases have clear parallels to the Trump NLRB’s approach to protected concerted activity in General Motors—though perhaps with even more troubling effects on workers with marginalized identities. As Susan Carle points out, this rule gives employers an incentive to act badly, because they have “higher chances of prevailing in discrimination suits when their conduct is so infuriating that it causes employees to lose their temper” (Carle 2016, 186).\n\nAs to the second limitation, Title VII’s opposition clause protects employees only when they oppose employer conduct that they reasonably and in good faith believe violates Title VII. In evaluating whether an employee could reasonably believe that the employer’s conduct violates Title VII, courts assume that a “reasonable person” is aware of the vagaries of federal case law. In other words, it is not enough for an employee to have a genuine belief that an employer has discriminated in some fashion, because Title VII does not cover every incident of discrimination. The statute also fails to protect employees from retaliation when they advocate for their employers to do more than just refrain from violating Title VII: an employee who advocates for a workplace affirmative action policy or anti-bias training, for example, would not be protected from retaliation under the opposition clause (see Smith 2003, 555–56).\n\nTo see how the reasonableness requirement plays out, consider the Supreme Court’s decision in Clark County School District v. Breeden. The case arose out of a meeting between Shirley Breeden, her (male) supervisor, and another (male) employee, to review job applicants’ psychological evaluations. One evaluation revealed that an applicant had made a harassing remark to a coworker: “I hear making love to you is like making love to the Grand Canyon.” Breeden’s supervisor “read the comment aloud,” looked at Breeden, and said, “I don’t know what that means.” “The other employee then said, ‘Well, I’ll tell you later,’ and both men chuckled.” Breeden complained about this exchange to two school district assistant superintendents, after which she alleged she was punished by having her job duties revised and being transferred to a different job location.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the district had not violated Title VII even if it did retaliate against Breeden for her complaint. It concluded that Breeden could not have reasonably believed that her coworkers’ discussion of the “Grand Canyon” remark violated Title VII, because Title VII prohibits only harassment that is so “severe or pervasive” that it “alter[s] the conditions of employment and create[s] an abusive working environment.” The exchange that prompted Breeden’s complaint, the court continued, was “at worst an ‘isolated inciden[t]’ that cannot remotely be considered ‘extremely serious,’ as our cases require.”\n\nIn other words, it did not matter whether Breeden genuinely believed the conduct violated Title VII, whether she genuinely felt harassed because of the exchange, or whether the exchange that prompted her complaint was recognizable as harassment as that concept is colloquially understood. But most nonlawyers have little grasp of the vagaries of Title VII; they are more likely to have a very general sense of what that statute prohibits, gleaned from sources such as general news stories, representations in popular media, and the employer itself—and none of these sources is likely to provide detailed or accurate information about topics such as what conduct does and does not rise to the level of sexual harassment. In fact, one study of sexual harassment training materials that are supplied by employers to employees found that these materials “tend to suggest that relatively trivial slights could give rise to harassment-related liability” (Tippett 2018, 481)—precisely the type of belief that the Breeden court characterized as unreasonable, leaving the employee unprotected from employer retaliation.\n\nAnti-retaliation provisions are an important source of protections for workers who invoke their rights under Title VII and other employment statutes. However, these protections are not absolute: workers who expect to be protected will sometimes find that they are not, either because they expressed themselves in a heated manner or because they opposed conduct that they saw as discriminatory but that was not actually covered by anti-discrimination law.\n\n3. When may employers buy employees’ silence?\n\nMuch of this paper discusses statutory responses to employer power, that is, legal limits intended to prevent employers from exercising their leverage over employees in ways that harm the employees or society. But employers also contract for employee silence in advance, in the form of nondisclosure agreements. NDAs have legitimate uses, such as protecting company trade secrets, but their reach often extends far beyond this type of information, sometimes purporting to restrict employees from revealing anything learned in the course of their employment. These broad NDAs reflect employees’ unequal bargaining power but they can also perpetuate it in at least two ways: by making it harder for employees to criticize their current or former employers, and by limiting employees’ abilities to get new jobs in their fields (see Lobel 2018).\n\nNondisclosure agreements (and their close relatives, nondisparagement agreements) came to widespread public attention in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which is synonymous with disclosures of sexual assault and harassment by powerful—and often serial—offenders. By using a combination of industry influence and payoffs, numerous abusive bosses and their enablers were able to buy current and former employees’ silence, shielding sexual harassers and abusers from exposure and allowing them to go on to harm others. For example, consider Zelda Perkins, a former assistant of film producer Harvey Weinstein. Perkins signed a nondisclosure agreement when she left her job in 1998; she later explained that she had been harassed by Weinstein for years but quit after a colleague said Weinstein had sexually assaulted her (Garrahan 2017). In exchange for 125,000 pounds and other provisions aimed at preventing Weinstein from harming others, Perkins agreed to a very restrictive set of terms—remarkably, she was not even allowed to keep a copy of the agreement itself; nonetheless, Perkins broke the agreement in light of rape allegations made against Weinstein in 2017, but even then she feared “crushing legal and financial repercussions” (Perman 2018).\n\nThe NDA that Perkins signed was negotiated as she was leaving her job, and she was represented by counsel—but Perkins still felt acutely the imbalance between her power and Weinstein’s, later saying that she felt her credibility would be “destroy[ed]” if she rejected the agreement and reported Weinstein (Garrahan 2017). Other NDAs are imposed at the beginning of an employment relationship, before employees even know what information they might learn or whether or why they might want to disclose it. These agreements are often imposed as a condition of employment, and they can be drafted in exceedingly broad language. For example, one recent California case involved nondisclosure and nondisparagement agreements that collectively committed employees to keep confidential virtually all information about their work, including “information disclosed by the Company to Employee and information developed or learned by Employee during the course of employment with Company,” as well as “all information of which the unauthorized disclosure could be detrimental to the interests of the Company.” Signing these agreements, which were recently challenged in court, resulting in a settlement, was a mandatory condition of employment for all employees. Of course, when faced with the choice of signing or going elsewhere for work, many employees will simply sign without seeking legal advice or attempting to negotiate.\n\nNDAs are not always enforceable. For example, an ex-employee alleged to have violated an NDA might later argue successfully that the agreement was signed under duress or that its enforcement would violate public policy. Further, agreements as broad as the one in the previous paragraph may violate state or federal law, either on their face or in specific applications. For example, whistleblower protections can override NDAs, and one court enjoined an NDA that purported to bar an employee from participating in an EEOC investigation. California courts have also treated very broad nondisclosure agreements as attempts to skirt legal limits on the use of noncompete agreements—the idea being that an NDA that makes it impossible for employees to bring their general knowledge and skills to a new employer will prevent an employee from landing a new job in the same field. And nondisclosure and nondisparagement agreements can violate the National Labor Relations Act, especially when they bar employees from criticizing their employer or disclosing information about their wages and working conditions either to each other or to “outsiders,” such as reporters. Finally, several states have responded to #MeToo disclosures by passing new laws limiting in various ways the use of nondisclosure agreements as they apply to allegations of sexual assault or harassment (see Spooner 2020, 355-63; Johnson 2019, discussing eight state statutes limiting the use of nondisclosure agreements in the context of harassment or assault). These laws cover not just NDAs that are imposed at the beginning of an employment relationship but also settlement or severance agreements like the one Perkins signed; other state laws take a similar approach to settlement agreements that conceal “public hazards.”\n\nOf course, even unenforceable NDAs can have effects on the employees who sign them. The legal reality that a given NDA is unenforceable may make little practical difference to employees who fear the repercussions if they break their word. Employees (and their potential future employers) may fear being sued by their previous employer, and employees may also fear repercussions from future employers. Thus, employees may have little power to resist agreeing to an NDA, and even an unenforceable NDA can be enough to silence employees.\n\nC. Workers’ social media, political, and religious speech\n\nWhat happens when workers disagree with the boss (or with each other) about sensitive topics, including politics and religion? Workplace conflicts over these issues can raise thorny problems, especially if one employee holds views that another finds hurtful or dehumanizing. But, as the introduction to this paper discusses, employers sometimes coerce employees’ political or religious speech in contexts that have nothing to do with maintaining workplace harmony; in these situations, the employer simply wishes to control employees’ views and beliefs for its own purposes. As the next two subsections discuss, there are some exceptions to the at-will rule that are sometimes relevant to these situations—but employees are often left unprotected.\n\n1. Political expression\n\nSeveral states protect employees from discrimination based on specific political activities such as voting or affiliating with a political party. Some of these statutes are of relatively recent vintage, but others date either to the 1700s or to Reconstruction, when they were passed in recognition of the likelihood that employers would use their control over workers’ livelihood to coerce their votes against anti-slavery Republicans. New York’s law is representative of many of these statutes in that it is limited to a specific set of activities—running for office, campaigning, or fundraising for a candidate, party, or political advocacy group —and New York courts have dismissed cases involving employees who were fired for other types of political expression.\n\nA few other states, however, have statutory protections for “political activities” or “political opinions” more generally. California is one example; its labor code prohibits employers from threatening to fire employees in order to try to “coerce or influence” the employee into “adopting or following any particular course or line of political action or political activity.” Like many of the other state statutes discussed in this section, this law has not resulted in many reported decisions interpreting its meaning, but a 1979 decision by the California Supreme Court concluded that, in addition to partisan political activity, the statute covered political views and civil rights advocacy, including the plaintiffs’ participation in the gay liberation movement. Additionally, two states—New Jersey and Oregon—prohibit employers from compelling employees’ participation in meetings held for the purpose of allowing the employer to communicate its views about “religious or political matters.”\n\nIn addition to laws specifically protecting employees from retaliation based on their political activity, a handful of states including California, Colorado, and North Dakota have broader protections for employees’ out-of-work “lawful activities” that could encompass politics. (New York has a more limited protection for off-duty “recreational activities.”) But even in those states, employees’ real-world protection is limited because of a combination of statutory exceptions and narrow interpretations by courts. For example, courts have narrowed nearly out of existence California’s law protecting employees’ off-duty activities.\n\nAs with the NLRA and Title VII’s retaliation provision, courts may read an implied duty of loyalty into lawful activities statutes. Consider Colorado’s statue, which provides a damages remedy for employees who are fired for “engaging in any lawful activity off the premises of the employer during nonworking hours,” unless a statutory exception applies. Statutory exceptions include employment decisions that “relate . . . to a bona fide occupational requirement,” or that are “reasonably and rationally related to the employment activities and responsibilities of a particular employee or a particular group of employees,” or that are “necessary to avoid a conflict of interest with any responsibilities to the employer or the appearance of such a conflict of interest.” Echoing the Jefferson Standard decision from the NLRA context, courts have read these statutory exceptions to permit employers to fire employees whose lawful off-duty activities are “disloyal.” For example, a district court upheld an employer’s decision to terminate a baggage handler with 26 years of service because he published a letter to the editor that criticized his employer for replacing full-time employees with hourly contract workers. Writing a letter was plainly “lawful off-duty activity,” but the court went on to read an “implied duty of loyalty” into the statute, limiting its reach to off-duty activities that were “personally distasteful” to the employer but “legal and unrelated to an employee’s job duties.” Then the court concluded that the employee breached the duty of loyalty when he went straight to the public without first “attempt[ing] to solve his grievance through Delta’s grievance system.” Of course, in the context of a business decision affecting tens of thousands of Delta employees, making an individual internal complaint is obviously futile, and so no aggrieved employee would be likely to take that step.\n\nFinally, there is the possibility that narrow, judge-made exceptions to the at-will rule will apply when employees are fired for their political speech. One of these exceptions, the tort of “wrongful discharge in violation of public policy,” reflects that “certain discharges that contravene well-established norms of public policy harm not only the specific employee but also third parties and society as a whole.” That means that employees can file a civil lawsuit when they are fired for a reason that is not just bad or arbitrary but also violates an established public policy. Given that description, one might envision broad protections for employee speech premised, for example, on the democratic ideal that each member of the polity should share equal footing to participate in public discourse on matters of shared concern.\n\nThe most well-known decision that reflects this sort of speech-protective approach to the wrongful discharge tort is Novosel v. Nationwide Insurance Co. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that he was fired from his job as a district claims manager because he refused to participate in his employer’s lobbying the Pennsylvania legislature to reform no-fault insurance law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed that the plaintiff stated a claim for wrongful discharge in light of “the importance of the political and associational freedoms of the federal and state Constitutions.”\n\nHowever, the Novosel decision has been criticized, and it reflects at best a minority approach. The main problem is that courts in wrongful termination cases generally require employees to point to “well-established” public policy, and most require a high level of specificity—for example, that the employee was discharged for refusing to violate a law or regulation or for invoking rights under a workers’ compensation program. But a list of courts have held that the First Amendment is not sufficient to demonstrate that there is a well-established public policy against political coercion by private-sector employers, because the First Amendment constrains only government actors. Edmondson v. Shearer Lumber Products reflects the dominant approach; there, the Supreme Court of Idaho upheld the termination of a 22-year employee because he opposed a political initiative spearheaded by the employer’s owner.\n\nFreedom of political belief is at the core of the idea of freedom of speech. But when private-sector employees face political coercion, they can fall back on legal protections only to a limited extent. Statutory protections, where they exist, tend to focus on protecting employees from retaliation in connection with their own political activity—voting or running for office. These statutes generally do not speak to what is likely a more common scenario, in which employers simply push their own political views, and employees say nothing because they fear being fired if they express disagreement.\n\n2. Religious expression at work\n\nConflicts over religious expression at work can arise both when religious employers try to impose their faiths on employees and when religious employees bring their faith to work in ways that offend their bosses or coworkers. For example, employees hired to work for a secular employer might be dismayed to be asked to participate in the boss’s Bible-study group. Conversely, a religious employee might want to take breaks at set times in order to pray or might want to put a religious message like “have a blessed day” into an email signature or keep an anti-abortion message in a designated workspace. Unsurprisingly, law has something to say about the extent to which employers can regulate religious expression at work. These rules seek to balance employers’ and employees’ interests—although the balance struck weighs heavily in favor of employers, especially when the issue involves accommodating an employee’s religious practice.\n\nEmployers’ legal obligations surrounding their own or their employees’ religious speech vary with the employer’s own mission and character. For example, an employer with a religious mission, like a church or a religious school, has a large amount of leeway to require employees to adhere to a set of religious views. Religious institutions have constitutionally protected “independence…in matters of ‘faith and doctrine,’” including “internal management decisions that are essential to the institution’s central mission.” Importantly, this independence reaches “the selection of the individuals who play certain key roles” —that is, who will be hired to convey a religious message and who will be fired from such a role. This principle has resulted in a kind of supercharged at-will doctrine that applies to employees who qualify as “ministerial.” Ministerial employees generally cannot invoke the protections of anti-discrimination law, probably are not covered by the NLRA, and may be precluded from relying on other statutory employment protections as well. And even nonministerial employees who work for religious institutions can lawfully be required by their employers to remain a member in good standing of the employers’ faith—a rule that can effectively turn adherence to a religion’s rules for personal comportment into job requirements.\n\nConversely, public employers are constrained by both the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause; they cannot require employees to participate in religious programs or to belong to a particular faith, nor can they discriminate against employees because of their religious exercise. However, public employers also must guard against employee religious expression that would give the impression that the government itself prefers some religious views over others. For example, a public employer cannot permit its librarians or groundskeepers to create public displays that give the impression of a religious endorsement, nor may it allow an employee addressing the public to use the opportunity to proselytize.\n\nFor both public- and private-sector employers that have a secular mission, statutory law modifies the at-will default in two important ways. First, these employers may not discriminate based on religion or allow harassment of employees based on whether, where, or how they worship on their own time. Second, they must accommodate employees’ religious beliefs or practices, at least where doing so will not impose an undue hardship. A reasonable accommodation might involve an employer partially waiving a uniform requirement so that an employee can wear a religious head covering, allowing the employee to take breaks at set times to pray, or changing an employee’s work schedule to allow attendance at religious services. However, the catch is that employers can refuse to provide such accommodations if they would impose more than a “de minimis” cost.\n\nThe reasonable accommodation requirement relates to employees’ bargaining power in several ways. First, it bars an employer from dismissing a request for a religious accommodation out of hand, which means that even employees who lack any form of individual bargaining power are supposed to be able to secure an employer’s agreement to no- or low-cost religious accommodations.\n\nSecond, an employee’s request for a religious accommodation might lead to a form of workplace bargaining. The EEOC and some courts have concluded that, when faced with an employee request for a religious accommodation, an employer must embark on an “interactive process”—a back-and-forth dialogue to determine whether there exists an accommodation that would meet the employee’s religious exercise needs without unduly burdening the employer. But, as Professor Shirley Lin has described in an analogous context, power imbalances between employers and employees can easily lead to a failure to accommodate, either because the employee does not ask for the accommodation in the first place or because the employer steamrolls the employee in the interactive process.\n\nThird, other employees may also be interested in the outcome of an accommodations process, including because they might be asked to bear some or all of the costs of the accommodation. For example, an employer might respond to an employee’s request to not be scheduled to work on the sabbath by requiring another employee to work every Saturday. Or an employee’s desire to display religious materials might be accommodated even though the display upsets a coworker. But the accommodation requirement does not require employees to take into account the views of the burden-bearing employees; whether they do anyway can depend on a host of factors including whether the prospective accommodation would conflict with a collective bargaining agreement, the employer’s own views about the desirability of the accommodation, the likelihood that either employee will quit, and so on. In other words, whether an employer agrees to an employee’s request for a religious accommodation depends to an extent on the scope of legal protections—but can also depend on the employee’s (and maybe coworkers’) bargaining power.\n\n3. Employee speech on social media\n\nAs discussed briefly above, the NLRA reaches concerted activity that takes place over social media. This means that if two employees interact on social media about their working conditions (or even if one employee posts a workplace concern that is intended to be an overture to coworkers), the NLRA may protect them against employer retaliation. But in addition, several states prohibit employers from demanding access to an applicant’s or employee’s social media posting. These statutes are privacy protections rather than speech protections; they do not prohibit employers from acting on an employee’s social media content that they see because of the employee’s own privacy settings or because other employees show the employer their colleague’s posting. However, they prohibit employers from requesting an employee’s or applicant’s social media username or password, implicitly providing some protection for workers’ expression, at least for workers who have privacy protections in place on their accounts. In addition, some states also bar employers from requiring employees to promote the company on social media or to add the employer to a social media contact list.\n\nD. A note on the First Amendment and public employees\n\nThis paper focuses mainly on private-sector workers who cannot rely on the Constitution’s free speech guarantee. But what about public-sector workers? First, the good news: public employees are covered by many of the statues discussed above, such as the anti-retaliation provisions of Title VII and various whistleblower protections. Further, many public employees are covered by some version of just-cause, rather than at-will, employment. Just over one-third of public employees are covered by a union contract, and others may enjoy similar tenure or civil-service protections. These substantive protections are also backed up by constitutionally required procedural protections; public employees who have a reasonable expectation of continued employment are entitled to notice and an opportunity to respond before they can be fired, plus a more formal post-termination hearing. (These procedural protections do not apply to at-will public employees.)\n\nThe bad news is that public employees often cannot rely on the First Amendment to protect them against employment consequences levied in connection with on-the-job speech. Like private-sector employers, public-sector employers may want to control their at-will employees’ speech for reasons that range from plausible to capricious. One might expect that courts would engage in closer scrutiny of public-sector employers, but they often do not. Instead, the Supreme Court has concluded that “government has significantly greater leeway in its dealings with citizen employees than it does when it brings its sovereign power to bear on citizens at large.”\n\nPublic-sector employers may exercise near-total control over how their employees do their jobs without violating the Constitution. This is true even when an employee’s job involves expression and even when the employer has previously delegated to the employee some degree of discretion to shape the message. Courts reach similar results when employees, speaking outside of their employment capacity, express views on matters that are not of “public concern.” Moreover, the court usually does not view public employees’ own working conditions as a matter of public concern, unless those working conditions touch directly on the provision of public service.\n\nPublic-sector employees receive somewhat more First Amendment protection when they speak as citizens—at least when their speech involves a matter of public concern. In that event, the court balances the public employer’s First Amendment interests against the public employer’s need for “orderly . . . administration.” Though the burden of proof is on the employer, this standard is very deferential to the government as compared to how courts approach other kinds of First Amendment cases. Moreover, the court defines “disruption” broadly, allowing public employers to rely on predicted (not actual) disruption and treating even such nonevents as having to respond to a lawsuit as “disruptions.” Thus, even when the First Amendment applies to a public employee’s speech, courts will still often defer to public employers’ assertions that their reactions were justified by disruption.\n\nThis framework applies to public employees’ speech generally, but there are also two special contexts that are treated differently. First, the court has held in a series of cases that political patronage is mostly unconstitutional: as long as a job does not involve policymaking, public employers may not require membership in a political party or support for a particular candidate or incumbent as a condition of employment. Conversely, the court has upheld restrictions on public employees’ political campaigning established by the Hatch Act and similar state laws. In these cases, the court has deferred to legislative judgments that public employees’ overt support for a particular political party or candidate might undermine public faith in government.\n\nThese two lines of cases are related to each other inasmuch as Congress passed the Hatch Act in part to prevent political coercion in the form of pressure exerted on public employees by their supervisors or coworkers to campaign on behalf of a particular candidate or party. But their mechanisms are quite different: whereas the political patronage cases constrain employers, the Hatch Act constrains employees. It also reflects a big difference between public and private employees: the state and local statutes discussed above—patchy and incomplete as they are—often protect private-sector employees’ rights to engage in some of the same activities that the Hatch Act forbids for public employees.\n\nIV. How the Constitution can undermine legal protections for employees\n\nThis report mainly focuses on the limited extent to which law protects workers from speech coercion by their employers. But there is also another angle to consider: employers’ arguments that certain workplace regulations designed to protect employees unconstitutionally infringe employers’ own constitutional rights. These arguments have gained traction in recent decades, and our increasingly conservative federal judiciary has proven receptive to them. Thus, there is a real risk that the Constitution itself will become an effective tool to undermine statutory protections for workers’ speech.\n\nFor example, suppose Congress were to try to increase unionization, which would in turn likely increase the number of workers covered by just-cause provisions in collective bargaining agreements. Suppose further that Congress went about this by increasing unions’ access to employees while they are at work and by barring employers from making some of the borderline-threatening statements that are currently permitted. Both changes can be understood as speech- and association-enhancing; the first would give employees more information about unions, and the second would allow employees to make their choice in a less-constrained environment. However, a conservative federal judiciary might strike down both changes, the first as an uncompensated taking of employer property and the second as a violation of the employer’s First Amendment rights.\n\nTo see how employers’ constitutional litigation could undermine workers’ rights, it helps to have a grasp of the basic structure of a First Amendment claim. Recall that the rights contained in the Bill of Rights are protections against government intrusions, and not private intrusions. (This is also why private-sector employees cannot bring successful First Amendment claims against their employers.) But when employers are regulated by the government, they can argue that those regulations unconstitutionally infringe their liberty; likewise, public-sector employees can bring constitutional claims because their employer is the government.\n\nIt is not inevitable that the Constitution will undo worker-protective legislation, but our cu"
