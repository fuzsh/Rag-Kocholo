Ample Parking-OW 9-4010-11 N.Y., FRIDAY, MARCH 8, 1968 Talks Lag On Copper Settlement By NEIL GILBRIDE AP Labor Writer WASHINGTON (AP) Negotiations .\n\ncalled effort by the settle White the in to nation's 238-day copper strike reportedly are getting nowhere. Sources say another nudge from President Johnson may be in the offing. The unwieldy talks, involving more than 100 negotiators and spread through a dozen or more rooms in the Executive Office Building, just steps from the White House, are bogged down in procedural details and renewed hostility over wage offers, these sources said. Despite a news blackout imposed by Secretary Labor W. Willard Wirtz, one insider said, \"There's a feeling Johnson is going to have to get both parties back together.\" White House press secretary George Christian said Johnson hasn't seen the negotiators since first calling them to the White House last Monday .\n\nThen he warned that the strike was threatening the U.S. foreigntrade position, prosperity at home and supplies for the Vietnam war. Christian's only report on the negotiations Thursday was that talks were continuing between the 26 striking unions and the 4 copper firms-Kennecott, Anaconda, Phelps Dodge and American Smelting and Refining. But informed sources said company negotiators were irritated at what they felt were vague and excessive union wage demands, and that one union representative was threatening to walk out unless he got a meaningful counter-offer from one of the companies. Cooke (Continued from Page One) until he was made episcopal vicar for Manhattan and as \"super secretary\" to the late cardinal thereafter, it was said .\n\nBishop Cooke was described by his secretary, Msgr. Eugene Clark, as a man particularly concerned with and active in affairs having to do with the poor and race relations. As episcopal vicar for Manhattan and the Bronx, the secretary added, the bishop was \"particularly involved with urban affairs.\" Msgr. Clark said. Bishop Cooke had entered the chapel in the archbishop's residence behind St .\n\nPatrick's Cathedral to celebrate a Mass shortly after the word of his selection was made public. \"I think he's feeling his res. ponsibilities very heavily at this moment,\" the secretary said. Bishop Cooke was born in the Pelham Bay section of The Bronx on March 1, 1921. His parents are dead .\n\nHe was graduated from Cathedral Preparatory, High School here Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers before going to Catholic University in Washington to take a degree in sociology. He was ordained to the priesthood on Dec. 1, 1945, and was assigned to St. Athanasius parish in The Bronx, where he served until March of 1947. At that time the young priest was transferred to St .\n\nAgatha's Home in suburban Nanuet. In September of the same year, he returned to Catholic University for graduate work, after which he was assigned to the staff of Caholic Charities here. During that assignment, Bishop Cooke worked with the Catholic Youth Organization, and assisted at the parish of St. Jude in Manhattan. From 1949 to 1956, Bishop Cooke was an instructor at Fordham University's School of Social Service .\n\nMeanwhile, he was named procurator of St. Joseph's Seminary in January, 1954, and stayed in that post until January, 1957, when he became secretary to Cardinal Spellman. In August, 1957, Pope Pius XII raised him to the rank of Papal Chamberlain with the title of Very Reverend Monsignor.

The scholarship winners, chosen in a nationwide competition involving 35,000 students from public and private schools, will receive awards from $250 to $1,500 annually for four years, depending on need. Asked how she feels about the award, Alice says: \"I'm honored naturally as a student and especially as a Negro student -because you're never sure of yourself. When people give you an honor like that, it's a booster to your self-confidence.\" However, she says she was \"a little bit disappointed\" that not more deserving Negroes from her area had been selected .\n\nHer mother is a school secretary and her father a telephone comtechnician. sounds kind of zany to pany, say that Negroes really are achieving,\" she says.

Nixon first meet head-to-head in a primary battle for the Republican presidential nomination. Rockefeller, who refused Thursday to rule out a race in ROCKY'S READY Gov .\n\nlie and the party compelled Nelson Rockefeller speaks him to run. The New York at news conference in New York yesterday when he said he would enter the race for the Republican presidential nomination if the \"degree and extent of a call\" from the pub- the Oregon primary, must himself provide the answer. He has two weeks to decide whether to leave his name on the ballot. The New York governor appeared to move closer to active candidacy Thursday when he said he had no \"present intention\" of entering the Oregon race but added: \"I do not make a definitive statement ruling it out.\" \"I said I was ready, willing to serve a call,\" he declared. He said later his decision depended on whether there was a \"genuine demand or draft or whatever you call it.\" Rockefeller's followers in Oregon already have gathered more than 3,000 signatures on petitions to put his name on the primary ballot .\n\nOnly 1,000 names are required. Only last week, Rockefeller had said he would file a disclaimer before the March 22 deadline to keep his name off the Oregon ballot. The primary is May 28. Oregon law requires an affidavit that says \"without qualification that he is not now and does not intend to become a candidate for said offices at the forthcoming presidential election.\" Both Nixon and Rockefeller have been successful in vious Oregon champaigns. Nixon won the primary in 1960 and carried the state 3-2 against John F .\n\nKennedy in the general election of 1960. But Rockefeller won the 1964 primary by a wide margin from a field that included Nixon and Barry Goldwater, using the slogan \"he cared enough to come.\" Two polls published Thursday show Nixon and Rockefeller even. One. listed Rockefeller with 39.7 per cent of the vote and Nixon with 38.7 cent. The other gave Rockefeller 40 per cent and Nixon 37.00 After Rockefeller's statement) Thursday a spokesman at the Oregon Draft Rockefeller Committee headquarters said, \"This really give us more confidence, all the more reason to continue doing what we're doing.\" The Oregon secretary of state, Clay Myers, will announce next Monday at 5 p.m .\n\nwho will be on the ballot because their \"candidacy is generally advocated or recognized in national news media throughout the United States. ifications, at no change in cost, on the general construction contract for Traphagen, involving the types of windows to be used in the school.

Future Hinges On Rockefeller Wilson Treads Political Tightrope By CHARLES R .\n\nHOLCOMB Gannett News Service ALBANY Many political careers in this most political of towns are riding on the coattails of a Rockefeller push for the Presidency. Lt. Gov. Malcolm Wilson, for example, probably stands to gain more than anyone here if Rockefeller captures the Republican nomination and goes on to become President. For in that event, Wilson would automatically become governor and could run in 1970 as an incumbent, a powerful advantage .\n\nBut if Rockefeller fails to get the nomination, or wins the nomination but loses the election to President Johnson, Wilson could be worse off than he is now. The reason: With the GOP's strongest vote Sen. Jacob K. Javits, seeking reelection, and President Johnson's popularity in a state of decline, the Republicans chances of picking up the six seats they need to recapture the Assembly are at least fair. Prospects would be even better if Gov .\n\nRockefeller were heading the ticket. Republican control of the Assembly would propel the openly ambitious minority leader, Perry B. Duryea Jr. of Montauk, into the speaker's chair and vastly improve his chances of successfully challenging Wilson for the GOP gubernatorial nomination in 1970, assuming Wilson were not already governor. But there are of uncertainties here .\n\nFor one thing, few men have gone from high legislative office to the governor's mansion Alfred E. Smith was the last Assembly speaker to do so, a half century ago, and he was sheriff of New York County in between. For another thing, Malcolm Wilson is a hard-working organization man and has very strong support among party regulars in every corner of the state. The biggest question involves New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay, who has often butted heads with Rockefeller and who must be rated as a Major gubernatorial contender in 1970, regardless of whether he is reelected mayor in 1969 .\n\nWorking against Lindsay, however, is the tradition that the mayoralty of York City leads to no higher office. For the Republicans to regein the Assembly they lost in the Johnson landslide of 1964 would be a disaster Democratic party in the state, and to two Democrats in particular Assembly Majority Leader Moses M. Weinstein, Queens County leader, and Assemblyman Stanley Steingut, Brooklyn leader. Steingut, who lost out to fellow Brooklynite Anthony J. Travia in the leadership fight of 1965, hopes to become speaker (as was his father) if Travia, as is expected, get a federal judgeship .\n\nSupporting LBJ Bobby Standing Firm On Not Entering Race WASHINGTON (AP) Close associates say Sen. Robert F. Kennedy is standing pat on his decision not to enter the race for the Democratic presidential nomination this year. The New York Democrat's position was represented as un- Staff Photo by Ron Frehm RE-ELECTED president of of Mount Vernon, Timothy J. Hotel in White Plains .\n\nOther Rochelle, C.

The Groun also adonted a iscolution calling for the appointment of more changed from the stance he as: sumed in recent public state, ments-that he would support President Johnson for re-eleition if the chief executive were renominated. Kennedy has been under pressure from some advisers to contest Johnson this year or face the possible loss four years from now of support from youthful Democrats and independents attracted by his criticism of Vietnam war policies. It can be said on the highest authority that Sen .\n\nEdward My Kennedy, is continuing to counsel his brother against making himself available this year. The controlling thinking in the Kennedy camp is that he can afford to wait until 1972, sources said. If developments warrant and he gets re-elected to the Senate in 1970, the belief is he then will have a strong chance to win the Democratic nomination. There apparently is no chance Kennedy will help Sen. Eugene J .\n\nMcCarthy, in opposing Johnson in the primaries, despite the Minnesota senator's default collection of Massachusetts' 72 convention votes. This developed when Johnson ruled out the entry of his name or that of a stand-in in the April 30 primary in that state. Edward Kennedy said he intends to remain on the delegation, even though it would pledged by state law to vote McCarthy on the first ballot at the Chicago convention in gust.
