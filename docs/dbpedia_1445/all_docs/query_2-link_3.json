        "text": "ALBANY, Feb. 26 — Perry B. Duryea Jr., in the winter of his discontent, wears his status as the front‐running Republican candidate for Governor next year gingerly, almost diffidently. He and his party are still reeling from the loss of two more Assembly seats in last November's elections, which shrank the Republicans’ Watergate‐decimated minority even further, to 60 out of the charnbees 150 seats.\n\nAlbany Notes\n\nThe pace of the legislative session Is so slow, and the debate over even major items like the Governor's budget so tepid, that the Assembly has scarcely provided a visible platform for Mr. Duryea, its minority leader and former Speaker.\n\nSo he Is moving quietly around the state, looking for evidence that a race for Governor makes sense, wondering whether, at the age of 55, after 16 years in the Assembly, lie should not just retire to his family lobster business and to his house high on a bluff overlooking the Atlantic Ocean at Montauk, L.I.\n\nMany people In politics assume that Mr. Duryea, whose gubernatorial ambitions were blocked in 1973 by an indictment on an election‐law charge that was later dismissed, is committed to making the race. But his closest advisers insist that this is not the case.\n\n“We're not going to do it just for the sake of getting clobbered,” one of them said the other day. “We know that Perry is not well known around the state and that people think of him as some kind of arch conservative EastEnd fishmonger. So first we have to see if we can change that.”\n\nSoul‐Searching Is Prompted\n\nMr. Duryea's personal goal coincides precisely with the desire—some might say urgent need—of the Assembly Republicans as a whole to bolster their statewide appeal. According to several members, the November losses prompted some painful soul‐searching, and the conclusion that the Republicans had not only been outfoxed by the opposition, which used sophisticated polling and media techniques, but had hurt themselves with an image as the ones who always voted “no.” The remedy, they decided, was to try to be a con structive opposition, not just an opposition.\n\nTo that end, Mr. Duryea is sponsoring 14 sessions he calls “budget listen‐ins’ around the state, presided over by local Republican Assemblymen, to solicit constituents’ ideas about the Carey budget.\n\nMr. Duryea himself is speaking to such groups as the City Club in Manhattan, whera he said yesterday that the Governor's proposed tax cuts were largely illusory and would not do anything to help the poor.\n\nMeanwhile, as the Albany session drones on, the former Speaker often’ appears restless and distracted.\n\n“It's just no fun being in the minority, especially once you've known power.” one of his senior members said, staring out across the Assembly chamber and shaking his head.\n\n•\n\nIs there a speechwriter‐in‐exile group forming at, of all places, The New York Daily News? Robert W. Laird, Governor Carey's first press secretary, who left the press office by mutual agreement last spring to become a deputy state commerce commissioner, is joining the newspaper's editorial board next month. Tom Rieke, a Carey speechwriter who left the administration amid some unhappiness last year, is also Daily News editorial writer.\n\nIn another departure, Frank A. Well resigned as chairman of the State Board of Equalization and Assessment to become an assistant under secretary of commerce in the Carter Administration.\n\n•\n\nThe Senate earlier this month voted to confirm a noncontroversial Carey appointee, William Kroeger, as vice chairman of the Workmen's Compensation Board. Senator Edwyn E. Mason, Republican of Hobart, known as one of the chamber's most dogmatic conservatives, voted no, prompting the following exchange between him and fellow Republican, Joseph R. Pisani of New Rochelle:\n\n“Why did you vote no?” Senator Pisani asked.\n\n“Because he has a beard,” Mr. Mason replied.\n\n“Well, Ulysses S. Grant had a beard,” said Senator Pisani, who sported one a few years ago.\n\n“But he was a great general,” came the reply.\n\n•\n\nAlthough Stanley Steingut, the Assembly Speaker, apparently prevailed in the long wrangle with the Senate over when to hold the primary this year he paid for the victory with what could prove to be a long‐term loss of political leverage.\n\nMidway through the month‐long stalemate, the Speaker attempted to strengthen his negotiating position by passing his version of the primarylune, with a mayoral runoff—and sending the bill over to the Senate. But despite the 30‐seat margin by which the Democrats control the Assembly, Mr. Steingut, blocked by a coalition of black and Puerto Rican legislators, along with a few whites, could not find the Democratic votes needed to pass the bill.\n\nThe setback was only temporary, since once the Senate agreed to the bill last Tuesday he was able to get 30 votes from Republican Assemblymen. But the lesson was not lost on anyone here who witnessed it. Seventysix votes are needed to pass a bill in the Assembly. The Democrats have 90 members‐14 of them members of the newly cohesive Black and Puerto Rican Caucus.\n\nThe point is not that the caucus nlans to oppose the leadership often—“We're professionals, and we'll take it issue by issue,” their chairman, Albert Vann of Brooklyn, said this week—but that Mr. Steingut's ostensibly overwhelming majority has been shown to be, on closer examination, rather tenuous. That is not the best of all positions to he in at the start of budget negotiations."
