        "text": "A VIEW FROM ALBANY Assembly Worm May Turn -And the GOP Knows It By Jim Klurfeld Newsday Albany Bureau Chief Albany--It was just before the debate on legislative reform that Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea Jr. (R-Montauk) and Minority Leader Stanley Steingut (D-Brooklyn) found themselves alone in the same elevator. Duryea had heard the debate many times before and knew that among the Democratic proposals to be made by Steingut would be one to eliminate the all-powerful Rules Committee. That is the committee that can determine the fate of any bill by controlling the scheduling .\n\nIt gives the speaker, who is automatically chairman of the Rules Committee, almost dictatorial power. As they rode in the elevator, Duryea turned to the minority leader and said, \"Stanley, when you become speaker next year, you're not really going to do away with the Rules Committee, are you?\" It was a question Duryea asked with a smile, and the reply--that Steingut would indeed eliminate the committeewas delivered in the same spirit. But behind the good fellowship is a fact that Duryea, Steingut and nearly all legislators recognize this session: There is a distinct possibility that the Democrats will be in the majority here next year. And that recognition already has had its effect on the tone of this legislative session. It already has led to an almost unprecedented concession by the Republicans to give the Democrats an equal number of mailings to their constituents .\n\nFunds for the mailings are controlled by the majority through the speaker. In the past, the Democrats had been limited to one mailing a year while Republicans have made as many as four districtwide said that. I didn't. We're finally mailings and seven or eight selected going to get some cooperation and I'm newsletters.

And this time he was successful. \"That's a very good idea,\" Clarence Asked if he thought the prospect of Lane (R-Windham), the Republican someday being in the minority motivated chairman, said to the Democrats. \"When the Republicans, Steingut said, \"You you take over next year, you can do it.\" Left and Right Play the Rating Game By Alan Eysen Newsday Nassau Political Editor Is I .\n\nWilliam Bianchi, the Democratic assemblyfrom Bellport, a conservative or a liberal? Acman cording to the way he is rated by the state Conservative Party and the state New Democratic Coalition, he could be both in about equal amounts. The ratings also make State Sen. Leon E. Giuffreda (R-Centereach) appear to be the most conservative of the Long Island senators, though an aide was quick to say that Giuffreda \"feels he is a middle-ofthe -roader.\" Honors for scoring highest on the Conservative Party chart and lowest on the NDC's among the 20 Nassau-Suffolk assemblymen went to Assemblymen John C. Cochrane (R-Brightwaters) and William L .\n\nBurns (R-Amityville). Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea Jr. (R-Montauk) was not rated because he rarely votes on bills. Those scoring highest with the coalition were State Sen .\n\nKaren Burstein (D-Woodmere) and Assemblyman Irwin Landes (D-Great Neck). They also registered the lowest scores on the Conservative rating. Ms. Burstein commented: \"It's probably not Bianchi, a freshman legislator, was delighted with his relatively high scores on each rating. \"Well, that's great,\" he said .\n\nThen he added, after a moment's hesitation, \"I hope I'm all right in the middle.\" Assemblyman John S. Thorp (D-Rockville Centre), whose scores were almost as balanced as Bianchi's, said that this reflects a middle of the road approach to voting. Both the Conservative Party and the New Democratic Coalition used the same technique for evaluating the legislators. Each organization took 20 bills that went before the lawmakers, last year and 00m- 3 Stanley Steingut I. William Bianchi Perry B .\n\nDuryea Jr. pared the individual legislator's vote on them with the organization's position on each. If a legislator voted completely in accord with the organization, he would receive a score of 100 per cent. But in only five instances did the Conservatives and the coalition choose the same bills. Assemblyman Arthur J .\n\nKremer (D-Long Beach), whose scores were closer than most in the two ratings, criticized the procedure. \"I think, basically, ratings by political organizations are somewhat questionable, because they will pick issues that do not necessarily reflect your political philosophy,\" he said. He and other legislators said that the selection of bills set an arbitrary standard. The Giuffreda aide noted that the senator got high ratings from the New York Civil Liberties Union several years ago. Cochrane and several other lawmakers said their voting records represented the point of view of their constituents .\n\nHe added that these ratings could have an impaot as ammunition during a campaign.
