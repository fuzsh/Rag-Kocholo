Stanley Steingut, former speaker of the state Assembly, died early today at New York University Medical Center following a long illness. He was 69.

Steingut, a Brooklyn Democrat, was speaker from 1975 until 1978, minority leader from 1969 until his election as speaker and Democratic Party chairman in Kings County from 1960 until 1968.

John Marino, chairman of the state Democratic Party, called Steingut "one of the state's greatest Democrats. He dedicated his entire life to building our party and improving the lives of all New Yorkers."

Steingut was elected speaker 40 years to the day after the election of his father, Irwin, to the same post. As a boy, Stanley grew up in New York politics, and often told of swimming with Franklin D. Roosevelt at the governor's mansion in Albany as well as the White House.

He was defeated for the Democratic nomination for his Flatbush seat in 1978, ending his 26-year career in the Assembly. Steingut ran on the Liberal Party line in the general election, but was defeated by Murray Weinstein, the man who defeated him in the primary.

Although he was widely thought to wield vast power, Steingut disliked his image as a political boss, preferring the term "leader."

He also tried to be careful what he said to reporters. The legendary disclaimer -- "No comment, but that's off the record" -- has been attributed to him.

Born in Brooklyn on May 20, 1920, Steingut was a graduate of Union College and St. John's University Law School. In 1952, he was elected to his father's Assembly seat after Irwin Steingut's death. Together, they represented the district for six decades.
