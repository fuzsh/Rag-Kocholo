        "text": "Peggy Olson is back on the market. But if you pick her up, she comes with the free gift of Scientology.\n\nI had no idea Elisabeth Moss was a Scientologist. It doesn’t affect how I view her on “Mad Men,” but it’s just … surprising.\n\nCheck out this list of other celebrity Scientologists. Some I knew, some I did not. (Jason Lee? Juliette Lewis? Erika Christensen?)\n\nAnyway, Fred Armisen plays Obama (and not very well) on “Saturday Night Live.” I prefer him as the ditzy court stenographer and Joy Behar of “The View.”\n\nFred and Elisabeth were only married 10 months. SNL boy was previously married to an English singer named Sally Timms.\n\nAccording to Life & Style (and picked up by other more worthy outlets), “Fred and Elisabeth separated in May. Fred is currently in Portland, Ore. on the set of his new series Portlandia. Elisabeth is in LA focusing on her career and spending quiet time with friends.”\n\nI’m sad. I liked them.\n\nThe Emmys are only a couple of weeks away — Sunday, August 29 on NBC — and Elisabeth is nominated as Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for playing Peggy on Season 2 of “Mad Men.” Who is she going to go to the awards with? (I still hope her fellow nominee Christina Hendricks wins for playing Joan.)\n\nAlso sad news: Patricia Arquette and Thomas Jane are reportedly divorcing.\n\nAlso, Patti Stanger of “Millionaire Matchmaker” has called off her wedding to her boyfriend of more than six years because, as she described it, he wants her to be something that she can’t be. (Emotionally stable?) Apparently she wants kids now (and she’s 49 so that sounds fair) and he doesn’t.\n\nGood news: Neil Patrick Harris is going to be a daddy of twins. I bet he’ll be a cool father.\n\nAlso good, but not new news: Jane Lynch is going to host SNL sometime in October. Can’t wait to see who else they have lined up for the new season. You think Jon Hamm will be back for a third time? Sergio! Let’s do this thing.\n\nAlso good October news: “In Treatment” will return to HBO for a third season this October. I love this show and you can check out my list of top 15 TV shows to find out why.\n\nBy Gina Carbone\n\ngina_carbone@comcast.net\n\nThis is what I wanted to happen:\n\n“Hurt Locker” wins best pic and best director for my hero Kathryn Bigelow. (Which would make her the second woman to win this award, after Barbra Streisand for “Yentl.” It’s time for Babs to be dethroned, no?)\n\nJeff Bridges (“Crazy Heart”) or Jeremy Renner (“Hurt Locker”) for Best Actor in a motion picture drama.\n\n“Mad Men” gets anything and everything it’s nominated for, including Jon Hamm for Best Actor TV drama and January Jones for Best Actress TV drama.\n\nChristoph Waltz for best supporting actor for “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“The Weary Kind” from “Crazy Heart” for best original song.\n\nAnd I want host Ricky Gervais to do something shocking to make everyone in the audience uncomfortable.\n\nBut as the sun now stands, Julianna Margulies won over January Jones (and Anna Paquin of “True Blood”), which upsets me, although Julianna looked GORGEOUS.\n\nMichael C. Hall won over Jon Hamm and Hugh Laurie and I have to say, that head wrap is a good look for him. Not happy about why he has to wear it, but at least his cancer is in remission. He is quite the cutie and we need him (and “Dexter”) around for a long time.\n\n“The Weary Kind” did win best song, but T Bone Burnett couldn’t find my new crush, Ryan Bingham. Was he in the “loo,” like Toni Collette was, way back when?\n\nAnd everyone who won said they worked with the best people in the world and they have the best jobs in the world and it made me want to take their awards away. If you have the best job in the world, that should be reward enough.\n\nIn this lousy economy with countries falling apart, you don’t deserve major gift bags and free liquor at the table and fancy dresses and jewelry AND the best jobs in the world. Pick one.\n\nClick here for all of the nominees, and more about Ricky Gervais’ plan for the show.\n\nNow let’s get to the arrival pics. These are all AP photos. Sorry, in advance, for any weird formatting issues."
