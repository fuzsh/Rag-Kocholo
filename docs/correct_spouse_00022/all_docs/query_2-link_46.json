        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfessions Director , Producer , Screenwriter more\n\nNationality American\n\nBirth October 19, 1977 (Montreal, Quebec – Canada)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nSon of Canadian director and producer Ivan Reitman ( Ghostbusters ), Jason Reitman was introduced to the world of cinema from his youth. After his studies, he directed numerous short films, including one that he co-wrote in 2004 with his wife, the writer Michelle Lee. In addition to small advertising films, in 2006 the young artist began directing his first feature film, Thank you for smoking . This satirical comedy, inspired by the book by Christopher Buckley , features Aaron Eckhart as a communications professional working in the tobacco lobby. The film achieved a certain success, which promoted the notoriety of the young filmmaker.\n\nBut it was especially in 2008, with Juno , that Jason Reitman’s talent was confirmed. In addition to winning the Oscar for best screenplay, the film revealed the young actress Ellen Page . In 2009, Jason Reitman toured with George Clooney and directed In the Air , which achieved significant critical success in the United States. We find Jason Reitman in 2010 alongside filmmakers from all backgrounds in the collective project New York, I Love You . Two years later Young Adult was released in theaters , a dramatic comedy starring an excellent Charlize Theron in the role of a superficial and narcissistic woman who questions herself.\n\nWith Last Days of Summer released in 2014, Jason Reitman took a more dramatic tone and told the story of an escaped inmate ( Josh Brolin ) forcing a woman ( Kate Winslet ) and her son to hide him in their home. He then focuses on the professional and relational difficulties to which men, women and children are subject , in a very original and ambitious essay, featuring the rising Hollywood star Ansel Elgort . After directing six episodes of the comedy series Casual , the Montreal native reunited with Charlize Theron for Tully , a comedy-drama in which the actress plays an exhausted mother of three whose daily life changes with the arrival of a young nanny ( Mackenzie Davis ).\n\nJason Reitman returns with the political biopic The Front Runner (2019), carried by Hugh Jackman in the skin of the young senator Gary Hart whose rise is stopped by an extra-marital affair. The filmmaker then takes up the torch from his father with Ghostbusters: The Legacy (2021), a direct sequel to the second part which takes place around thirty years after the latter."
