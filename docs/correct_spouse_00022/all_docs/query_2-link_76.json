Then he stops and asks her if she minds going over a sexual consent form. She has no objections, but asks if he minds if her lawyer looks it over. Soon, over each of their shoulders, their lawyers are in full negotiation.",

        "text": "Just before Jason Reitman burst onto the scene with Thank You For Smoking, he delivered this 6-minute gem of a short film. The acting from the two young leads is shoddy at best, but the writing is so consistently funny that it actually makes them better as the film progresses.\n\nIt's a really simple concept that was executed with fierce wit. Before engaging in sexual acts toward the end of their successful blind date, both the girl and boy bring contracts, and their subconscious-created-attorneys, into the mix to negotiate exactly how far they will go and to which base they will cross at such an early stage in their relationship. Reitman's dialogue crackles with many hilarious moments for such a short running time, and the man and woman who play the lawyers are flawless in their delivery.\n\nAll in all, this is a nearly perfect short film. I loved every second.\n\nI was worried it was just going to be a dumb, ignorant short saying that consent has become so complicated in the 21st century (when actually it's clearer than ever: ask for consent, go with the yes or no answer you receive). I feel it still is about that, but the writing is remarkably clever, and I can respect that."
