        "text": "Ryan Murphy’s upcoming Hulu legal drama All’s Fair has lost one of its big stars: Halle Berry is exiting the series, just a week after her casting was announced, a source confirms to TVLine. Our sister site Variety first reported the news, adding that Berry dropped out “due to a scheduling conflict.”\n\nGlenn Close and Kim Kardashian remain in the cast, with both set to serve as executive producers. As previously reported, the Hulu series — touted as “a high-end, glossy and sexy adult procedural” — is eyeing a late 2024 production start date for an early 2025 launch. Kardashian will take on the role of Los Angeles’ most successful divorce lawyer working at an all-female law firm. (No details on Close’s role have yet been released.)\n\nMore from TVLine\n\nTell Me Lies Season 2 Gets September Premiere Date on Hulu - First Look at Tom Ellis and More New Cast Members\n\nDance Moms Reboot Introduces Abby Lee Miller's Replacement in Extended Trailer - Watch\n\nTVLine Items: Colin Firth Joins Young Sherlock, Morning Show Adds Aaron Pierre and More\n\nMurphy will write, direct and executive-produce as part of his overall deal with Disney. Additional writers/EPs include Jon Robin Baitz (Bothers & Sisters, FEUD: Capote Vs. The Swans), Joe Baken (American Horror Stories), Jamie Pachino (So Help Me Todd, Chicago P.D.), Laura Greene and Richard Levine (Masters of Sex, Nip/Tuck). Kris Jenner also executive-produces.\n\nKardashian most recently starred as a cutthroat publicist in FX’s American Horror Story: Delicate, which premiered Part 2 on Wednesday, April 3. Her performance was well received by critics and fans alike despite mixed responses to her initial casting.\n\nClose’s TV credits include The Shield, Damages, The New Look, Tehran and The Simpsons (as Mona Simpson).\n\nBerry, meanwhile, starred in the Steven Spielberg-produced sci-fi series Extant. She also appeared on The Bernie Mac Show, Frasier, Martin, Knots Landing, A Different World and They Came from Outer Space, and voiced an episode of The Simpsons.\n\nHow are you feeling about this latest casting news?
