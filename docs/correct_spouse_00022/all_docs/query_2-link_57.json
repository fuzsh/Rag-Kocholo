        "text": "Leslie Jones is speaking out after production of a new Ghostbusters film has been confirmed and will exclude the four actresses featured in the 2016 remake.\n\nJason Reitman, son of original Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman and the co-writer and director of the next version, will skip over the most recent film starring Jones, Melissa McCarthy, Kristin Wiig and Kate McKinnon, continuing the franchise from the original story, according to EW.\n\n“I’ve always thought of myself as the first Ghostbusters fan, when I was a 6-year-old visiting the set. I wanted to make a movie for all the other fans,” Reitman says. “This is the next chapter in the original franchise. It is not a reboot. What happened in the '80s happened in the '80s, and this is set in the present day.”\n\nJones took to Twitter to share her disappointment about the decision, and she wasn't shy about revealing her point of view.\n\n\"So insulting. Like f*ck us,\" Jones wrote. \"We [don't] count. It’s like something trump would do. (Trump voice) \"Gonna redo ghostbusteeeeers, better with men, will be huge. Those women ain’t ghostbusteeeeers” ugh so annoying. Such a d*ck move. And I don’t give f*ck I’m saying something!!\""
