Student films include: ‘Freak Film’, and ‘Orientation’ which was distributed in Canada by 20th Century Fox as a short opening for a ‘Dustin Hoffman’ vehicle.

During the trial, the men who went on to form Northern Lights Entertainment were offered $175,000 by MGM to make a feature to be called ‘Foxy Ladies’. They were the first Canadians convicted under Canada’s decency laws, despite widespread critical acclaim and support from the arts community. They were fined $300.00 and put on a year’s probation. * Father of ‘Jason Reitman’ , ‘Catherine Reitman’ and ‘Caroline Reitman’ . * Worked on films in Canada with ‘David Cronenberg’ . * Likes to put his children: ‘Caroline Reitman’ , ‘Catherine Reitman’ and ‘Jason Reitman’ in his movies. * Graduated from McMaster University, Hamilton, Ont.
