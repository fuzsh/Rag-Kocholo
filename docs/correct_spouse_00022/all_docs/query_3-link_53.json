        "text": "Meatpacking condo once home to Glenn Beck, Jason Reitman, and Trey Parker lists for $5M\n\nBy Annie Doge\n\nDon't worry, this interesting trio of notables didn't live in this Meatpacking District condo at the same time. \"South Park\" co-creator Trey Parker lived in the loft-style, three-bedroom spread at the Porter House during the initial run of his Tony-winning Broadway show \"Book of Mormon,\" according to the Post, who also note that Academy Award-winning director Jason Batemen, best known for \"Juno\" and \"Up in the Air,\" as well as uber-conservative political commentator Glenn Beck have called this apartment home. And it's currently on the market for $4.9 million or as a $13,900/month rental.\n\nSee the rest\n\nAcademy Award-Nominated Director Jason Reitman Sells His Classy Chelsea Home for $3M\n\nBy Annie Doge\n\nThe fate of Jason Reitman's Chelsea pad is no longer up in the air. After just 32 days on the market, the director/producer/screenwriter, best known for the beloved indie flick \"Juno,\" as well as well as the aforementioned pun starring George Clooney, has sold for $3.05 million. As noted by the Observer, the 1,600-square-foot space at 434 West 20th Street was purchased by Reitman with his then-wife Michelle Lee back in 2011 for $2.15 million, with the pair said to be drawn in by the home's prewar detailing and its location just across from the New York Seminary's gorgeous gardens.\n\nMore photos inside the beautiful apartment"
