Now the Canadian-born director may be feeling more…Up in the Air, shall we saw, when it comes to the home.\n\nNo word yet on what the director’s next move will be, but the co-op’s new owners, Licia and Kenneth Zegar, must have found the apartment more than satisfactory, as they purchased the three-bedroom, 2.5-bath pad for $3.05 million just around a month after it was first put on the market."
