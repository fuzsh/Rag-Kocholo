        "text": "While maybe not be the best film ever, there is a lot of love from fans for last year’s “Ghostbusters: Afterlife.” The film seemed to be the prime example of a legacy sequel with nods to the original and emotional beats that tug on those nostalgic heartstrings. Can you recapture that sort of feeling again? Well, if Sony is able to do it, the studio will have to rely on a new director in the “Ghostbusters” franchise to make it happen.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Ghostbusters: Afterlife’ Director Jason Reitman & Co-Writer Gil Kenan Discuss Next Franchise Film\n\nAccording to Deadline, Jason Reitman has stepped away from the directing duties of the upcoming “Ghostbusters” sequel. In his place, Gil Kenan has joined to take over. Even though he’s not directing the new film, Reitman is still aboard the production, sticking around as writer-producer alongside co-writers Jason Blumenfeld and the aforementioned Kenan. A plot for the sequel has yet to be revealed.\n\n“It’s an absolute honor to pick up the proton pack and step behind the camera for the next chapter of the Spengler family saga,” said Kenan. “I just wish I could go back to 1984 and tell the kid in the sixth row of the Mann Valley West that one day he was going to get to direct a ‘Ghostbusters’ film.”\n\nREAD MORE: Jason Reitman Developing A ‘Ghostbusters’ Animated Series\n\nReitman added, “A few years ago, my father handed me the keys to Ecto-1, and together we made ‘Ghostbusters: Afterlife.’ Words will never express how grateful I am to have made a film with my father by my side. It’s now time to hand those keys to my creative partner and fellow Ghostbuster Gil Kenan, a brilliant director who will keep the Spengler spirit alive. I can only hope to provide him the same producorial care and support that my father showed me.”\n\nKenan is no stranger to family-friendly films. He’s probably best known for his Oscar-nominated animated film, “Monster House.” He also directed features such as “City of Ember” and most recently, “A Boy Called Christmas.” Even with his previous success, it’s clear that the “Ghostbusters” sequel is going to be the biggest production of his career to date.\n\nProduction is expected to begin in early 2023 for the “Ghostbusters” sequel. And it better happen soon, as the film is hoping to debut in theaters in December 2023."
