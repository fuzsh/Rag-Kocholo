        "text": "For $7.9M, this sprawling four-bedroom Chelsea condo is a modern city mansion in a landmarked building\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nOn Manhattan's west side, the landmarked Cass Gilbert building at 130 West 30th Street is a classic Chelsea address. Asking $7,850,000, this 21st-century condo spans 4,000 square feet, offering the kind of space you'd expect in a country mansion, surrounded by iconic New York City views. There's an abundance of outdoor space in the form of two sweeping terraces, so you can even include your garden dreams in your modern city estate.\n\ntake the tour\n\nChelsea’s most expensive listing is this $40M penthouse at The Cortland\n\nBy Aaron Ginsburg\n\nA penthouse atop a new condo building in Chelsea is hitting the market this week for $39,500,000, marking the neighborhood's most expensive property currently on the market. Designed in collaboration between Robert A.M. Stern Architects and Olson Kundig, The Cortland at 522 West 22nd Street is a 25-story tower with waterfront views and 144 luxury residences. Penthouse 25 measures over 5,760 square feet and includes two outdoor terraces with 360-degree views. If it sells for the asking price, the home would become one of Chelsea's priciest deals.\n\ntake a look\n\nFor $2.95M, this parlor floor Chelsea co-op has brownstone charm and a private terrace\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nIn the heart of Chelsea's historic district on a tree-lined brownstone street, this just-right-sized two-bedroom co-op at 347 West 22nd Street offers the best of townhouse charm. With 12-foot ceilings and the elegant proportions often found on the parlor floor of a brownstone, this carefully renovated home, asking $2,950,000, offers a wood-burning fireplace and a private terrace overlooking the tranquil back garden, along with room for a bedroom, office, or guest room, and plenty of open entertaining and living space.\n\nchelsea townhouse co-op tour, this way\n\nBehind this $9.9M Chelsea townhouse, a secret path leads to a backyard carriage house\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nIf you love the idea of an 1848 brick townhouse restored to its original glory, with a back garden, a roof terrace, and a pretty carriage house down a hidden \"horse walk,\" the middle of Manhattan might not be the first place you'd look. This three-unit townhouse at 331 West 20th Street, asking $9,900,000, is like having a private country estate right in the heart of Chelsea. The 25-foot-wide, five-story Greek Revival home is large enough to contain three large private units. A two-story rear carriage house is an unexpected surprise.\n\ntownhouse and carriage house tour, this way\n\nEthan Hawke’s former Chelsea townhouse lists for $5.98M\n\nBy Aaron Ginsburg\n\nA four-story Chelsea townhouse once owned by actor Ethan Hawke has hit the market for $5,980,000. Located at 353 West 21st Street in the Chelsea Historic District, the six-bedroom, four-and-a-half bathroom residence measures 21 feet wide and features a spacious full-floor primary suite on the top level, an outdoor terrace, and a backyard and garden with a self-irrigation system. Hawke purchased the home in 2005 for $3,000,000 and lived there until 2013 when he sold it for $5,867,000.\n\nfind out more\n\nThis $12.5M Chelsea carriage house has a garage, three outdoor spaces, and a two-bedroom flat\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nSpring will soon be in the air, and warmer weather brings dreams of al fresco dining and backyard entertaining for fortunate city dwellers with patios, decks, and private gardens. This four-story carriage house at 313 West 20th Street has three separate outdoor spaces–and a spacious garage, right in the heart of Chelsea. Asking $12,500,000, the historic home, built circa 1900, is a 25-foot-wide Manhattan mansion–with the option of a top floor apartment for rental income.\n\ntake the carriage house tour\n\nNYC real estate developer arrested in $86M+ fraud scheme\n\nBy Aaron Ginsburg\n\nThe former executive of a luxury New York City development firm has been arrested for his connection to an $86 million fraud scheme. Nir Meir, the former managing director of HFZ Capital, was taken into custody on Monday along with other high-ranking industry officials, for stealing money from investors, subcontractors, and the city of New York, according to the indictment. Prosecutors claim Meir, who managed the firm's largest projects, specifically The XI (now One High Line), directed more than $253 million of the project's funding to LLCs controlled by HFZ despite being legally required to use the money for the development.\n\nget the details"
