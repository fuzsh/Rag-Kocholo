        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, July 16 — American comedian-singer Jack Black's band, Tenacious D are in hot water with Trump supporters.\n\nFollowing an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump over the weekend, Black celebrated his bandmate Kyle Gass's birthday during a concert in Sydney, igniting controversy.\n\nAs Black and the audience sang “Happy Birthday” to Gass, who turned 64, Black invited him to “make a wish.”\n\nA man in a large robot costume then approached with a candle-covered birthday cake, according to ew.com.\n\nJust before blowing out the candles, Gass joked, “Don't miss Trump next time,” eliciting laughter from both the audience and Black.\n\nAs news of the Tenacious D incident spread on social media, Trump supporters quickly rallied to defend the former president against the comedy-rock band.\n\nOne user said, “Jack Black, you're breaking my heart here. Unbelievable.” Another asked for someone to “arrest him immediately.”\n\nAnother commenter said: “It’s going to be hard to ever watch School of Rock again,” referencing the 2003 film starring Black (though Gass does not appear in it)."
