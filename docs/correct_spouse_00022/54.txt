With his new Hulu comedy series “Casual” getting rave reviews, Jason Reitman has clearly had the sting of divorce diminished and has found a new creative outlet. And with it, the director of “Up in the Air” and “Juno” can take a new direction in his living arrangements, too. The director has just sold the townhouse co-op he bought in 2011 with his now ex-wife Michele Lee.

The 3-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom abode at 434 West 20th in West Chelsea sold for $3.051 million — just a shade over the $2.95 million list price. The residence overlooks an historic seminary and boasts 11-foot ceilings and a wood-burning fireplace. The Reitmans paid $2.1 million four years ago, but have since split.

With no previous experience in television directing, Reitman found a perfect vehicle in “Casual,” which explores dating and family. The streaming sitcom features a divorcee and her teenage daughter who move in with her single brother. So you can either keep perusing pix of Reitman’s old NYC home, or explore the unconventionally good sitcom.
