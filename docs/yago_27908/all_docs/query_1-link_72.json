        "text": "Few people can say they attended Queen Elizabeth's wedding to Prince Philip. Even fewer can claim they were one of her bridesmaids. Princess Alexandra, the Honourable Lady Ogilvy, had such an honor, among countless other privileges obtained as the Queen's first cousin and a member of the British royal family.\n\nAt the time of her birth, she was 6th in the line of succession to the British throne. She's now 57th in line. Here, we take a look at the Princess's extraordinary life.\n\nPrince Richard, Duke of Gloucester and Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester, with Princess Alexandra during Trooping the Colour in 2022.\n\nAlexandra was the first British princess to attend normal school.\n\nPrincess Alexandra, whose full name is Alexandra Helen Elizabeth Olga Christabel, was born on Christmas Day in 1936. Her father was Prince George, Duke of Kent, the fourth son of King George V and Queen Mary; Alexandra's father was brothers with Queen Elizabeth II's father, King George VI. At the time of her birth, Princess Alexandra was sixth in line to the British throne, but now she is 57th in the line of succession.\n\nThe Princess is also royal on her mother's side, with ties to Greece, Denmark, and Russia. Her mother was Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, a daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia.\n\nThe Princess’s mother, Marina, Duchess of Kent, with her three children, Prince Edward, Princess Alexandra, and, in his mother’s lap, Prince Michael, in 1943.\n\nAlexandra is the second child and only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Kent. Her older brother, Prince Edward, became the new Duke of Kent when, in 1942, their father died tragically in a wartime flying accident. The siblings also have a younger brother, Prince Michael of Kent.\n\nAt age 11, rather than being homeschooled, Alexandra became the first British princess to attend regular school. The Princess went to Heathfield School, a boarding school near Ascot. She later studied in Paris.\n\nHer husband also came from nobility.\n\nIn 1963, Princess Alexandra married Angus Ogilvy, the second son of the Earl of Airlie. The pair had a lavish wedding at Westminster Abbey, attended by the Queen and Prince Philip, Prince Charles, the Queen Mother, and Princess Margaret. A young Princess Anne was Princess Alexandra's chief bridesmaid.\n\nPrincess Alexandra and Angus Ogilvy were photographed in Westminster Abbey on their 1963 wedding day.\n\nThe couple had two children, James, born in 1964, and Marina, born in 1966, though neither currently carries out official royal duties. In 2004, Sir Angus Ogilvy passed away after a long illness.\n\nAlexandra is especially involved in healthcare and the medical system.\n\nThe Princess is patron or president of more than 100 organizations, with many pertaining to healthcare and helping those affected by physical or mental illness. Alexandra is currently Joint-President of Cancer Research UK with her cousin, the Duke of Gloucester and Deputy President of the British Red Cross Society. She has also served as patron of various organizations including the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, the Alzheimer's Society, the Mental Health Foundation, hospitals and hospices, and charities related to aiding the blind.\n\nShe is also a patron of the arts.\n\nPrincess Alexandra in 2022.\n\nThe Princess is clearly a fan of both the arts and sciences. She is particularly fond of classical music and opera. You can spot her attending many society events, galas, and performances around the world in order to show her support. She also acts as patron of the Chopin Society, the English National Opera, and the London Philharmonic Choir.\n\nPer the royal family's website, \"She is patron or president of over 100 organisations which reflect her wide-ranging interests, from the arts to health care. She also supports The Queen in her duties as Head of State, attending ceremonial occasions alongside other members of the Royal Family.\"\n\nPrincess Alexandra chatted with Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge at the annual Remembrance Sunday Service in 2017.\n\nAlexandra often acted as the Queen's stand-in.\n\nThroughout Queen Elizabeth's reign, the Princess often represented her at events both in the UK and around the world. She also attended national ceremonies alongside the Queen, like Trooping the Colour and some state dinners.\n\nThe Princess has traveled far and wide representing the Crown. Over the years, her trips have included official visits to Thailand and Brunei, Rome, Gibraltar, Norway, the United Arab Emirates and the USA and Canada.\n\nIn 2016, the Queen hosted a celebration in honor of Princess Alexandra’s 80th birthday, as well as her patronages. The pair is pictured here entering the Buckingham Palace event.\n\nFollowing the Queen's death in September 2022, Princess Alexandra mourned alongside the rest of the royal family at a number of ceremonial events, including the state funeral of the late monarch.\n\nShe's one of only a few royals to have attended the coronations of both Queen Elizabeth and King Charles.\n\nHere she is at the ceremony in 1953, and again in 2023.\n\nRead more here:"
