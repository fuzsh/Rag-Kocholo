        "text": "This is an idea I've been thinking about for a little while but haven't really done an outline for yet: Alexandra married the future Tsar Alexander III and Dagmar married the future King Edward VII. I think their ages work alright together with Alexandra being only a year older than Alexander, though Edward being six years older than Dagmar would mean they would marry later.\n\nThe first changes I imagined were, of course, their children. There would be no Nicholas II of Russia (therefore his wife Alexandra would almost definitely not become empress) nor George V of the United Kingdom (though the British monarch was pretty much ceremonial by then). Their ATL counterparts might have wildly different personalities and relationships, for example, with Kaiser Wilhelm II, which would prevent or at least change WW1?\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts or ideas?\n\n(Btw this is my first thread so be kind lmao!)\n\nThis is an idea I've been thinking about for a little while but haven't really done an outline for yet: Alexandra married the future Tsar Alexander III and Dagmar married the future King Edward VII.

If you've done some research, you should write a TL of how you think it would go!\n\nThe question is whether Dagmar was more political active, because she was queen in a country where she could get away with it.\n\nWith a mother in law like Victoria? Doubt it. In Russia Dagmar was the leading lady from the moment of her marriage. True, Maria Alexandrovna was still around at first but she was never really much of a part of court/political life anyways.\n\nWith a mother in law like Victoria? Doubt it.

True, Maria Alexandrovna was still around at first but she was never really much of a part of court/political life anyways.\n\nDammar may or may not be politically active in Denmark but as an empress of Russia she did not play any political role. Even the social role was minimized because AIII cut a number of the court events to a minimum and lived rather secluded life when in Gatchina. She got visibly involved in the Russian politics only as a dowager empress.\n\nThink Dagmar - who was more politically active than Alexandra was IIRC - might run into some interesting opposition in London.\n\nAlthough considering how OVERBEARING BOTH were as mothers, I suspect their sons will end up not dissimilar to OTL.\n\nI definitely agree with them both being overbearing. Alexandra seemed slightly more domineering? So I suppose OTL Nicholas II (I’m guessing he’d have the same name) might have an even more submissive personality\n\nAlso: assuming that Dagmar somehow gets Bertie (which...seems unlikely to say the least) then she would definitely be called Mary in her marital country. Her baptismal first name was Marie (which was the origin of her nickname Minnie) and there's no way that the UK is going to have a Queen Dagmar.\n\nYeah, I know that Dagmar and Bertie marrying is a bit of a leap considering she was quite younger and Victoria wanted Bertie married quickly but I think it isn’t entirely impossible! And I think Mary would definitely be chosen as her British name thanks\n\nYeah, I know that Dagmar and Bertie marrying is a bit of a leap considering she was quite younger and Victoria wanted Bertie married quickly but I think it isn’t entirely impossible! And I think Mary would definitely be chosen as her British name thanks\n\nThe sisters were close enough in character and in minds that they would likely have just switched roles. I agree that the idea of Bertie marrying Dagmar is a little further fetched as Victoria and her husband Albert when he was alive, were anxious to marry him off as soon as possible. He likely would have been matched with a German princess instead of waiting for Dagmar to mature. Alexandra being older however, may have been originally matched with the Tsareavitch Nicholas, (Alexanders III's older bother) as he was originally engaged to Dagmar. How might that have changed Russian History? He may have married sooner instead of dying due to complications of a riding accident, leaving his younger brother to marry Dagmar. Let's say he dies anyway. An earlier marriage to Alexandra before he dies may have produced an heir that would succeed Alexander II. Then a child Tsar inherits the throne with a regency combined likely with his Uncle, Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich, and his mother Dowager Tsarevna Alexandra.\n\nAnd how about this? Dagmar who now is not married to Bertie, marries Alexander anyway. Now the Danish sisters are together again in Russia.\n\nThe sisters were close enough in character and in minds that they would likely have just switched roles.

Though I see the logic in your idea\n\nWith a mother in law like Victoria? Doubt it. In Russia Dagmar was the leading lady from the moment of her marriage. True, Maria Alexandrovna was still around at first but she was never really much of a part of court/political life anyways.\n\nBut her role, at least as long as AIII was alive, was almost purely domestic (including the court ceremonies). NII was the first emperor with a wife playing an active role in governing the state. The remote second was PI - his second wife was marginally involved but never in a role involving a serious responsibility or decision making.\n\nSo it would not seriously matter whom a strong-willed person like AIII would matter.\n\n(sorry for such a late reply, completely forgot about this!!)\n\nDo you think Christian IX and Queen Louise would be willing to 'waste' Dagmar's marriage to another Russian rather than having her marriage secure an alliance with another country? Though I see the logic in your idea\n\nPretty likely they will go on board with that without the English match available and with a need to better consolidate the russian alliance."
