        "text": "Documentary (2010) as part of the Deaf History series. The monarchy has been endlessly recorded in history, but not many people know that at the beginning of the 20th Century, Britain had a Deaf queen. Reporter Camilla Arnold tells us about the life of Queen Alexandra, who was born in Denmark in 1844. When she was 16, she was chosen to be the wife of Albert, Prince of Wales and became the daughter-in-law of Queen Victoria. It is believed that Alexandra taught the Queen to fingerspell, and she made a point of supporting Deaf arts, buying work from Deaf artists and sculptors."
