        "text": "One hundred years ago on Friday, on December 1 1923, Queen Alexandra turned 79. She was nearing the end of her life, a life which had bridged the Victorian, Edwardian and Georgian periods. On her birthday Tatler looks back at the life of a Queen who was vastly popular in her time, well known as a fashion icon, a devoted wife, Queen and philanthropist.\n\nOn 1 December last week, Alexandra’s birthday in 1923, Stanley Baldwin was prime minister and Virginia Woolf was living in Mayfair, battling with the manuscript that would become Mrs. Dalloway. The nation was still healing the wounds of war; London’s streets were a-throng with the newly popular passenger buses, some horse drawn vehicles and early motorcars; beneath the streets of the city, the first tube lines in the world were trundling away. Queen Alexandra was Queen mother to George V, the King who guided the country through WWI. But Alexandra had come into the royal family sixty years earlier, when she married Edward VII in 1863. At that time, Alexandra was just 18 and Edward 21.\n\nAlexandra was born in Denmark in remarkably modest surroundings – unaware of the grandeur that would later fill her life as a queen and empress at the height of the British Empire. She was born in the Yellow Palace, a quaint townhouse adjacent to the Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen. Her family were a distant cadent branch of the Danish royal House of Oldenburg, which had declined into relative insignificance by this time. Her father’s income was a modest trickle from an army commission and their house was a rent-free grace and favour property.\n\nIn 1848, King Christian of Denmark died, sparking a succession crisis which ended with major European powers calling a conference in London. An agreement was reached which made Alexandra’s father, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, heir to Frederick’s throne in all his dominions. Although the family’s status had risen, their income hardly changed. Alexandra shared a draughty attic room with her sister Dagmar, made her own clothes and waited a table along with her sisters. They were often visited by the famous writer, Hans Christian Andersen, who would tell them bed-time stories; they learned English and were taught to swim by the renowned pioneer of women’s swimming, Nancy Edberg.\n\nRead More\n\nHow London fell for Fabergé: inside the V&A's latest exhibition\n\nThe Bolsheviks exiled him, but Carl Fabergé was beloved by British royalty and high society\n\nQueen Alexandra’s family certainly had an artistic bent. Dagmar married the future Tsar Alexander in 1866 and moved to Moscow, where she became an important collector of Carl Faberge’s eggs – often sending them to her sister. Queen Alexandra herself was an enthusiastic amateur photographer, learning how to use a hand-held camera, she enjoyed creating photographs of family albums and painting them with watercolour decoration.\n\nAs Princess of Wales, Alexandra became well known as a trendsetter, popularising the choker necklace, which became a particular symbol of her fashion reign. She was also known as a smoker in a period where it was unconventional for women to smoke. Often seen with a cigarette holder, she set an enduring trend which became a symbol of high-society elegance. It is said that Alexandra’s impact on fashion was so profound that society women even copied her limping gait after an illness left her with a stiff leg. This came to be known as the ‘Alexandra limp’.\n\nHaving married so young, Alexandra and Edward had a relatively successful marriage – though Edward indulged in a number of affairs, the matter was handled with stoicism by Alexandra. They had six children, with five surviving. Their eldest son, Prince Albert Victor died in 1892 of a influenza, contracted during a pandemic. This was a blow which brutally saddened Alexandra. She kept his room and possessions exactly as he had left them – as a shrine to her deceased son. The nation, too, was shocked, with shops shuttered and mourning clothes worn in the streets. Albert Victor’s tutor, James Kenneth Stephen, refused all food from the day of his death and died 20 days later. Albert’s father, Edward, wrote to Queen Victoria, ‘glady would I have given my life for his’. At this moment, Prince George took Albert’s place in the line of succession — eventually succeeding in 1910.\n\nIn 1910, while Alexandra was visiting her brother in Corfu. She received the news that Edward was dying and arrived only a day before he passed, administering oxygen from a gas cylinder to help him breathe. Alexandra was also intensely devoted to her sister Dagmar. When Dagmar was widowed by the death of Alexander III, Alexandra travelled to Russia and slept, prayed and stayed by her sister’s side until Alexander’s burial two weeks later. During her husband’s reign, Alexandra was deeply involved in charitable work. She rarely enjoyed much hard power but was committed to various causes, including hospitals and the welfare of soldiers. During WWI she became involved in nursing efforts and founded the Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps.\n\nIn her later years as Queen mother, Alexandra enjoyed a close relationship with her son, George V, supporting him through a number of difficult periods as King. In her later years she was known for wearing elaborate veils and heavy makeup. Her hearing began to fail and her memory and speech became impaired. She died in late November 1925 at Sandringham."
