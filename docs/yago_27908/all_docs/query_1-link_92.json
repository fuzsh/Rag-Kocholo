        "text": "Princess Alexandra of Denmark was, from the outset, a highly anticipated match for Queen Victoria’s eldest son and heir, Edward VII. Known as Bertie, Edward VII was renowned for his high jinks and philandering as a bachelor. For most, his early reputation is connected to his father’s death. Visiting his son Bertie at Cambridge to confront him over rumours of an affair with sex worker Nellie Clifden, Prince Albert and his son went for a walk in the rain. His father was dead not three weeks later, casting a shadow of blame over Bertie that Queen Victoria was never fully able to shrug off. To restore peace to the mother and son union, a bride was sought across the houses of European Royalty and Princess Alexandra, daughter of Danish King Christian IX, was produced. Despite her royal background, Alix had lived a humble girlhood, sharing an attic room with her sister Dagmar long into her teens. As she approached England by boat in 1863, saluted by poet laureate Alfred Tennyson, her life was irrevocably changed.\n\nLike the Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Alix’s legacy is often defined through dress. In a world emerging from the strictures of Victoriana, Alix understood the power and the perils but equally, the potential, of the public gaze. Her famous pragmatism with regard to her husband’s ongoing affairs was often expressed through her choice of clothes: white evening wear throughout the 1870s and neat tailoring in contrast with her husband’s expanding waistline. One need only think of Kate’s equal subtlety in her choice of British and high street designers to see how sartorial choices shape and clothe future Queens in the public imagination. Much imitated in her lifetime, Princess Alix’s high necklines and chokers became iconic styles in the Edwardian era, each imitation proof of the soft power royal women wield, forerunners of the Breton top and jeans look Kate has inspired.\n\nIn motherhood, Princess Alix carved out a new and informal picture of maternity, one that paved the way for the images of the Cambridge children today. Famously armed with her Kodak box Brownie camera, Alix took pictures of her five children in their Sandringham home, cementing the association between royal childhood and the landscapes and beaches of Norfolk as famously captured in the Cambridges’ anniversary video. Standing on the other side of the lens, Princess Alix produced a collection of photographs for charity in 1908, offering images of her Royal tours and charity work in place of her own. Kate, too, has shown with her informal photographs of her children and her collection of Holocaust survivors’ images her ability to direct her own gaze towards the public creating a pictorial dialogue as few royals are able.\n\nPhotographed at the end of her life, Princess Alix stares out at the camera, knowingly, perhaps trustingly. Unlike her descendants whose relationship with the lens would be increasingly complicated, hers was an era in which image and influence had not yet become quarrelsome companions. In her footsteps, the Duchess of Cambridge treads, a photographer princess for our time.\n\nSubscribe now for a trial offer of 3 issues for £1 plus free digital editions and home delivery.\n\nMore from Tatler"
