        "text": "Alexandra of Denmark was the queen consort of King Edward VII and beloved by the British public.\n\nNot only was she beautiful and intelligent, she was also a fashion icon — everything she wore became a new trend, and even when she developed a limp, her walk was also copied by many who wished to be just like her.\n\nBorn in 1844 in Denmark, Alexandra and her five siblings belonged to a small royal house, known as the House of Oldenburg. The renowned Danish author Hans Christian Andersen was friends with Alexandra's parents, and he'd often come to the palace to read his stories to the children.\n\nREAD MORE: The true stories of Queen Victoria's four sons\n\nThe family were clearly property-rich but cash poor; once the kids were old enough to hold a job they were sent to work, something very few royals are ever forced to do.\n\nAlexandra took on work as a waitress and shared a bedroom in the family's attic with her sister Dagmar. Working as a waitress and not having enough money to buy new clothes, Alexandra made her own — one step closer to living out her destiny as an international fashion icon. But her life was soon to change beyond her wildest dreams.\n\nFollowing a political crisis of succession in Denmark in 1852, Alexandra's father Christian IX was suddenly next in line for the throne. This meant Alexandra and her sisters were thrown into the national spotlight, and they began to attract several wealthy suitors.\n\nAt the same time, Britain's Queen Victoria was searching for a wife for her son Albert Edward, the future King Edward VII. It was suggested to her that 16-year-old Alexandra would be a good match.\n\nA meeting was arranged between Albert and Alexandra in Germany, and so began their incredibly rocky relationship. (Albert's nickname in certain circles was \"Dirty Bertie.\")\n\nEdward VII proposed to Alexandra 18 months after meeting her and she was immediately welcomed by the British public. She wasn't used to being in the spotlight, so she insisted the royal wedding was small, taking place at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle on March 10, 1863.\n\nAlexandra became an instant fashion icon when she posed for widely-circulated photographs in her wedding dress, wearing a pearl necklace and three diamond bracelets. The train for her wedding dress, made of silk and satin, was so long that eight ladies were needed to carry it down the aisle.\n\nAlexandra's new mother-in-law made it clear she wasn't exactly a fan of Alexandra, partly because she didn't approve of her loyalty to Denmark. Meanwhile, Alexandra's father became Danish King Christian IX in 1863, and her brother George accepted the throne of Greece as George I. Her sister, Dagmar, was married to the Russian Tsarevich.\n\nIN PHOTOS: The most beautiful historic royal wedding dresses\n\nFrom the beginning, Alexandra and Bertie were not exactly aligned — she was a devout Christian who took her marriage vows very seriously, but her husband refused to give up his playboy antics and insisted on keeping multiple mistresses. Some historians believe he had around 55 mistresses, and Alexandra knew about them all.\n\nAlexandra loved hunting, riding, ice skating and dancing. She also loved being a mother to her six children. All her babies were born premature, however, some historians believe she lied about how far along she was in each pregnancy so her domineering mother-in-law would miss their births.\n\nAnother passion of Alexandra's was photography. She taught herself to use a hand-held camera and created several albums of family photographs. She painted many of them with watercolours, and in 1908 a selection of her photographs was published to raise money for charity.\n\nAll the royals with hidden artistic talents\n\nWhen she was pregnant with her third child, Alexandra suffered from rheumatic fever. While she recovered and delivered a health child, she was left with a permanent disfiguration — a limp.\n\nHer limp became a fashion trend, known as the \"Alexandra limp\", and apparently some socialites of the day actually pretended to have a limp as well. She also started the trend of wearing chokers and dresses with high necklines; something she originally used to hide a scar on her neck.\n\nDuring the marriage, Albert Edward continued his relationships with his mistresses, including actress Lillie Langtry, Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick; humanitarian Agnes Keyser, American Jennie Jerome — the future mother of Winston Churchill — and socialite Alice Keppel.\n\nREAD MORE: Victoria and Albert: The royal love story that defined a queen's reign\n\nWhile Alexandra knew about her husband's extra-marital relationships, she once told a friend, \"He loved me the most.\" (She gave permission for Alice Keppel to visit Albert on his deathbed, but quickly asked her to leave when she became somewhat dramatic.)\n\nAlexandra never had an easy time with her pregnancies and birth. Her sixth child, a boy, only survived for a day. Her health deteriorated with each pregnancy, and she began to lose her hearing due to a hereditary illness. This meant she spent more time with her children and pets, and less time socialising.\n\nIn the aftermath of her son's death, Queen Victoria insisted she have a very public display of mourning. The British press described this as \"sickening mummery\", even though it hadn't been Alexandra's decision to grieve publicly.\n\nEventually the Queen praised Alexandra's tireless work for charities, saying, \"She opens bazaars, attends concerts, visits hospitals in my place… she not only never complains, but endeavours to prove that she has enjoyed what to another would be a tiresome duty.\"\n\nIt wasn't long before tragedy struck again. Alexandra's eldest son Prince Albert was engaged to Princess Mary of Teck, but shortly before the wedding Albert fell ill with influenza, dying just before his 28th birthday. It was devastating for Alexandra and she was never to get over losing him, once saying, \"I have buried my angel and with him my happiness.\"\n\nIn 1901, Queen Victoria died, which meant Alexandra was well and truly back in the spotlight as her husband ascended the throne and she became queen consort.\n\nIn 1910, she made history as the first queen consort to visit the British House of Commons during a debate. As she attended the Ladies' Gallery, Alexandra listened to members of Parliament debate the Parliament Bill which would remove the right of the House of Lords to veto legislation; a bill that Alexandra opposed.\n\nShortly afterwards, as Alexandra visited her brother, King George I of Greece in Corfu, she had word from her family that the King had suffered a heart attack. She arrived in London on May 5, 1910, to be with her husband, but he died the following day.\n\nREAD MORE: How Queen Mary's reputation as a royal 'kleptomaniac' began\n\nAlexandra was heard to say that following her husband's death, she had been turned into stone, \"unable to cry, unable to grasp the meaning of it all.\" Her son George became the new King and Alexandra moved from Buckingham Palace to Marlborough House.\n\nIn the last few years of her life, Alexandra's health declined and she died from a heart attack at Sandringham House in Norfolk, shortly before her 81st birthday on November 20, 1925.\n\nIt was an incredible \"rags to riches\" story; from minor Danish royalty and waitress to queen consort, a life marked by tragedy as well as much love and adventure.\n\nAlexandra was buried beside her husband at the very place they were wed — St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here."
