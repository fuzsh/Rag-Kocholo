Daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and his consort, Louise of Hesse-Kassel; older sister of Empress Maria Fyodorovna of Russia and Crown Princess Thyra of Hanover. Took the title of Princess of Wales upon her marriage in 1863, becoming Queen consort in 1901. A devoted mother to her six children, including Queen Maud of Norway. Was an arbiter of fashion, setting trends that style-conscious women faithfully copied. Extremely popular with the British public; held strong anti-German views even before World War I, but failed to influence foreign policy.
