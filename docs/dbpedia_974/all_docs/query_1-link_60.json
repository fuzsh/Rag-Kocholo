        "text": "Cooperstown, NY (August 4, 2024) - The Cooperstown Summer Music Festival is set to knock it out of the park with a musical doubleheader featuring acclaimed percussionist, composer, and teaching artist Justin Jay Hines on Friday, August 16, 2024. Both events in this free, family-friendly twin bill are open to the public, with registration required.\n\nHines, a veteran performer and teaching artist with the New York Philharmonic and other all-star ensembles, will bring his major league talent to Cooperstown for a day of interactive music-making.\n\nThe first event kicks off at 10:30 AM with \"Buckets of Fun!\" at Origins Cafe, a garden and eatery in Cooperstown dedicated to “serving the well-being of soil, people and planet.” Participants aged 7 and up will craft percussion tools from natural materials and learn funky hip-hop rhythms on garden buckets, which will be provided. The workshop culminates in a group bucket drumming performance that's sure to be a hit.\n\nFor the second event of the day, Hines will present \"Rhythm 'Round the World\" at 3:00 pm at The Farmers' Museum. This signature workshop explores the global history of percussion through stories, solos, and demonstrations. Attendees will first create their own instruments using recycled materials and create a percussion soundtrack for Native American storytelling.\n\n\"We're excited to have Justin pitch this doubleheader in Cooperstown,\" said Linda Chesis, Artistic Director of the Cooperstown Chamber Music Festival. \"These workshops offer a fantastic opportunity for families to engage with music in a hands-on, creative way.\"\n\nBoth events are appropriate for ages 7 and up. Adults are welcome to participate. All materials will be provided for the morning session. For the afternoon event, attendees are encouraged to bring metal, plastic, and cardboard recyclable items to create instruments.\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST\n\nJustin Jay Hines is a highly accomplished percussionist who has performed with the New York Philharmonic, The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and numerous other prestigious ensembles. A dedicated educator, he has served as a Lead New York Philharmonic Teaching Artist since 1997 and will make his 6th appearance hosting the New York Philharmonic's Young People's Concert \"The Future is Innovation\" in February 2025.\n\nEVENT DETAILS:\n\nFamily Music Fest with Percussionist Justin Jay Hines\n\nFriday, August 16, 10:30 AM\n\nOrigins Cafe\n\n558 Beaver Meadow Road, Cooperstown, NY 13326\n\nFriday, August 16, 3:00 PM\n\nThe Farmers’ Museum\n\n5775 NY-80 Cooperstown, NY 13326\n\nTICKET INFORMATION:\n\nTo register for this can't-miss doubleheader, visit cooperstownmusicfest.org or leave a message at 877-666-7421.
