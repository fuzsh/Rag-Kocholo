        "text": "1902\n\nTwenty-six Catholic families petitioned Archbishop James E. Quigley for their own parish. The archbishop granted permission to the Reverend John Linden, pastor of St. Mary’s Church in Des Plaines, to organize a mission parish in Arlington Heights.\n\n1905\n\nSt. James Church was completed in November.\n\n1926\n\nSt. James School opened in September.\n\n1935\n\nSt. James had 195 parish families. The population of Arlington Heights was 5,000.\n\n1952\n\nFirst services were held in the new church.\n\n1964\n\nThe Building Program initiated a funding campaign to raise funds for what was then the convent, now known as the St. James School building. See the historical artifact reporting on the program.\n\n1981\n\nSt. James launched Theology-on-Tap, which became the premier catechesis and evangelization program for young adult Catholics in the United States.\n\n1990\n\nSt. James launched a Public Action to Deliver Shelter (PADS) site to serve the homeless in the area.\n\n2000\n\nIn January, St. James launched its “Millennium Campaign” to raise funds for a new worship space, meeting and activity area, as well as to unite the elementary and junior high schools.\n\n2009\n\nIn April, St. James dedicated a new St. James School and Formation Center, which consolidated the elementary and junior high school programs.\n\n2019\n\nThe renovated worship space opens.\n\nWelcome to St. James! With great joy I welcome you and your family to this wonderful parish. St. James is a warm and welcoming community of over 2,500 active families. I invite you to join us for mass where you will experience the vitality and faith of this place.\n\nOur mission is to be disciples of Christ and make disciples of Christ. Our vision is that each member of our community encounters the fire of God’s love; then with hearts burning brightly, shares that love with others.\n\nI look forward to meeting you at one of our masses or parish events. Please pray for me as I remember you and your family at daily mass.\n\nYour Servant in Christ,\n\nFr. Edward Pelrine"
