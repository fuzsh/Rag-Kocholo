        "text": "It takes a village! Our children are valued members of our community of faith, and we want to make sure they feel welcomed and encouraged to make friends old and young. There’s no better time to be had in NYC on a Friday evening than right here at St. James’!\n\nMovies, bingo, Casino night, Lego building, and service projects…fun for the whole family! We are continuing our service projects by Reaching Out to Our Neighbors. Each Family Friday we will do fun service projects, like make 150-200 desserts or assemble toiletry kits for our meal program guests, or make cards for our Pastoral Visitors to take to our home bound and hospitalized parishioners. Join us on October 20, November 10, and December 8 for these fabulous nights of helping others!\n\nThere are a few ways you and your family can help our homeless neighbors and those struggling with food insecurity:\n\nSign up to bake or donate desserts to our meals served on Tuesday mornings and Friday evenings.\n\nDonate travel-sized toiletries, and/or help us assemble toiletry kits at the new Samaritan’s Closet, a free clothing resource for those who need it\n\nPlease contact Calvin Bushman to learn more, or to get involved in these or other helping ministries. Service is part of how we put our faith into action—if your family has a longing or an idea for a new way we might care for our neighbors, our community or our world, please reach out!"
