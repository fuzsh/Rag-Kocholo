        "text": "DeJarnette’s Tavern | Halifax County, Virginia | c. 1780s\n\nThe oldest building in Halifax County, Virginia, DeJarnette’s Tavern stands along a rural road- empty, out of use, and overlooked by countless passersby who wouldn’t give it another thought. But a history nerd like me would immediately turn around to learn more about a place like this, and I’m glad I did because the story here is a fascinating one. Contained within these walls are almost 250 years of history, woven with a healthy mix of facts and local lore that surround it, and for good reason.\n\nA lot of events have transpired in the 240+ years since it was built and a revolution, a rebellion, and a civil war are all part of the story. It’s also the story of one family, the DeJarnettes, who owned it continuously for most of that time over six generations. But the story here isn’t just theirs because this building wasn’t just one of the Dejarnette Family homes. It was also a tavern and inn that was open to travelers on the stagecoach road who needed room and board. These boarders came from all over and many of them were part of a new wave of settlers making their way to North Carolina and around Southside Virginia, traveling down the major thoroughfare that ran outside the tavern.\n\nWith so many different visitors over the years, it’s no wonder that this place comes with a long list of racy legends and I think you’ll find out, as I did, that the history of this place provides a fascinating chronicle of early America.\n\nJean ‘The Immigrant’ DeJarnette\n\nThe DeJarnette name first appeared in passenger logs in 1699 when Jean DeJarnette (DeJarnat) arrived in Virginia. Jean was born in 1680 (or 1690) in La Rochelle, France and just 5 years later, the Edict of Nantes, which protected Protestants in France, was revoked. Along with many other Huguenot families, the DeJarnettes fled to England and from there, secured passage to the New World, arriving in America in 1699 or 1700.\n\nIn 1700, Jean DeJarnette married Mary Watkins Mumford and they made their first home in Manakin Town, Virginia- a settlement south of the James River near Richmond that was established for Huguenot immigrants. In 1705, Jean ‘The Immigrant’ DeJarnette was naturalized and the family moved to Halifax County, Virginia, where they purchased land along Hickey’s Road. It was here that he and Mary raised their children. Their grandson, Daniel DeJarnette (1768-1831), was the primary owner of the tavern and his family is the focus of this article.\n\nHickey’s Road\n\nIn the Colonial Era, few wagon roads connected Richmond to the outlying areas, so in 1749, an early road was laid out by court order which came to be called Hickey’s Road– named for John Hickey, an early settler and merchant. This road extended from Staunton River to the Mayo Settlement and measured just over one hundred miles in length. This was the first route with clearance high enough for wagons, bringing new access to settlement in the region and thus, Hickey’s Road played an important role in settling Southside Virginia. Over the following years, traffic grew tremendously with families who were pushing into the Virginia frontier and further south into North Carolina and resources were needed to support them on the frontier.\n\nJohn Hickey established a tavern and store at one end of the road where these settlers could stop to refresh, get food, and purchase supplies before forging southward to North Carolina. After Hickey’s Tavern, travelers would’ve been on their own for supplies so it was an important and well-known stop on this settlement route during the era. In 1756, George Washington traveled Hickey’s road and visited John Hickey’s tavern where he stayed while inspecting the forts of the area. Washington’s expenses from his overnight stay at Hickey’s Ordinary amounted to 21 shillings and 3 pence.\n\nCaptain James Pemberton DeJarnette\n\nThe DeJarnette Family settled in this area along Hickey’s Road and saw an opportunity to capitalize on the traffic from travelers. This tavern came to be associated with Capt. James Pemberton DeJarnette and his sons, Thomas and Daniel. Capt. DeJarnette (1750-1826) was the grandson of Jean ‘The Immigrant’ DeJarnette. Although the tavern might be even older, we know that the DeJarnette Family opened a tavern here on Hickey’s Road as early as 1782, and much like Hickey’s Tavern, DeJarnette’s Tavern offered accommodations, food, and supplies for travelers on Hickey’s Road. Overnight boarders were offered modest accommodations downstairs on hay mattresses while there was room for the family to live upstairs.\n\nOne local legend is that soldiers mustered here for the Revolutionary War but proof of this has never been found. However, we can confirm that Capt. James Pemberton DeJarnette fought in the Revolutionary War, from 1774-1777, so it is very possible that revolutionary activity might’ve occurred here, given that it was owned by a Revolutionary patriot, its proximity to a major travel route, and it being a public tavern.\n\nBest known for his service in the revolutionary army and his 3 term appointment as the High Sherriff of Halifax County (from 1774-1777), Capt. James Pemberton DeJarnette is usually credited with having built the tavern, although some records say it was built by his son, Thomas. But Capt. DeJarnette had extensive wealth and land holdings in this area, with many grand plantation homes so it is unlikely that he ever lived in the tavern, although it is thought that his sons did at different times.\n\nDeJarnette’s Tavern: Architectural Notes\n\nThe Colonial-era tavern was constructed of wood on a stone foundation and is a one-and-one-half-story structure, sheltered under an unusually deep gable roof.\n\nThe structure is two rooms deep with an original stone chimney. Both floors have 3 large rooms, with the tavern space on the first floor where travelers would eat and sleep. The originally enclosed stair is almost completely intact.\n\nThere is an exterior entrance near the rear corner of the west side of the foundation opening into a low rear cellar room that has rubble stone walls.\n\nYou can read the full architectural assessment from the National Register of Historic Places here.\n\nWhat Was it Like at the Tavern Back Then?\n\nA place like this would’ve been a welcome sight to weary travelers who were in need of rest, food, supplies, and repairs for their wagons, but locals relied on this outpost too, bringing a lively cross-section of people through these doors. The DeJarnettes were also slaveholders- some who worked in the fields and their plantation homes, as well as other enslaved people who worked here at the tavern to serve guests of the inn. Travelers and locals alike were able to have a meal at the tavern and locals were afforded a house account so they could create a running ‘tab’ they would pay off periodically.\n\nThe tavern grew quite a reputation and over time, came to attract a certain type of crowd who were known to be a ‘rough and tumble’ bunch that enjoyed sports like horse racing and cockfighting. These kinds of matches, as well as duels and card games, were commonplace at taverns like DeJarnette’s, and legend says there was a horse racing circuit nearby.\n\nThomas and Daniel duel for the tavern\n\nGambling was common in taverns like this one so it won’t come as a surprise that one of the many legends that float around about this tavern involved a bet that put the tavern up as the prize. The story goes that Daniel and Thomas DeJarnette, brothers and sons of Capt. James DeJarnette, were engaged in a duel (possibly an arm-wrestling match) at the tavern one evening and that Daniel bested his older brother. Hanging in the balance was ownership of the tavern, and when Daniel beat his older brother in the fight, Thomas was forced to cede the property. According to court records from 1782, ownership was transferred from Thomas to Daniel following the duel. This record from 1782 was the first official appearance of the tavern in county records and from this point forward, the building has been most commonly associated with Daniel DeJarnette.\n\nDaniel DeJarnette (1768-1831)\n\nDaniel DeJarnette, son of a Revolutionary War captain and grandson of a Huguenot who fled France. is the DeJarnette for which this tavern became known. Daniel acquired the property from his brother in the early 19th century, following their duel. During Daniel’s ownership, he utilized it as both a stagecoach station and a gathering and resting place for locals and travelers alike. The traffic along the road continued to grow due to the tremendous number of families migrating south. Daniel was successful as a tavern owner and according to the 1800 census, Daniel declared to the census taker that he enslaved 11 people. This would play an important part in the story of the tavern that came in 1802.\n\nThe Easter Uprising of 1802\n\nIn the Spring of 1802, a group of rebels who were enslaved on local plantations banded together to revolt and DeJarnette’s Tavern was intended to be the meeting place for the revolt. The history books would come to call this The Easter Uprising of 1802 and according to the story, a man named Sancho instigated a slave uprising to take place on Good Friday, 1802. Sancho was enslaved by Daniel DeJarnette but worked on loan to various plantations which required regular absence from his home plantation. His travel to local plantations gave him access to many other enslaved people and together they shared ideas and ambitions of freedom that were dangerous. Sancho was regularly on the move between plantations and his mobility helped him in gathering a small group of dedicated followers who would join him in revolt.\n\nTogether, they had plans to demand freedom, the right to earnings, and equitable distribution of property. These were extremely dangerous thoughts for that time, as they must have known and would later pay dearly for them.\n\nWhen their day came to make their demands, supporters of the uprising left their plantations and one member of the group, an enslaved man named Abram, was caught. Abram was forced to supply information about his co-conspirators which led to their capture.\n\nBoth the Easter Uprising and another related rebellion, known as Gabriel’s Rebellion, are regularly mentioned together because of their proximity and similar goals. These uprisings gained national attention, however, no freedoms would be granted to either group. President Jefferson issued advice on the situation, directing the local court to punish the conspirators by sending them to Africa as indentured servants, rather than executing them. However, his advice was ignored when group members, Sancho, Absalom, Frank, and Martin were sentenced to death, despite that there had been no deaths or injuries in their rebellion. After their sentencing, Abram was also sentenced to death after the others testified against him and the five men were hung nearby on May 15, 1802. The only woman who was involved in the uprising, a woman named Phoebe, was returned to her enslaver instead of being hung.\n\nAlong with Gabriel’s Rebellion of 1800, Sanchos 1802 Easter Uprising led Virginia legislators to clamp down more tightly on slaves’ activities and abilities to move around on loan placements. They also limited activities, movement, and right to work for free blacks.\n\nHowever, it seems that the uprising, led by a man enslaved by Daniel DeJarnette, did little to affect Daniel’s position on slavery because, in 1820, he reported that the number of people he enslaved had grown to 41."
