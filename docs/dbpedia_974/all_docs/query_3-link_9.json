        "text": "St. James Mustard Seed, our local outreach program supporting the needs of the community in Madison and Northern Chenango Counties, shares in the Church’s mission of witnessing the Christian message of hope and serving those in need.\n\nThe Mustard Seed Store, located on Route 80 in Georgetown, NY, includes clothing, shoes, small household goods and books for all ages, also incorporating an emergency food pantry to service those in immediate need.\n\nWe work closely with Community Action Partnership of Madison county to help with monetary assistance when the need arises.\n\nOur outreach coordinator, Veronica Huftalen (Ron), is available to meet individually with clients to help them assess, evaluate, and meet their needs.\n\nThe Mustard Seed is the primary sponsor of the St. James Thanksgiving and Christmas basket programs along with our annual Christmas Giving Tree. These programs are for those families who utilize our food pantry.\n\nThibeau, Haiti, is in the Nord Province about a 30-minute drive on mainly dirt roads from the city of Cap Haitian. A rural village, Thibeau has seen its residents’ lives changed for the better with a parish twin program. The partnership began twelve years ago with the building of a church and rectory, St. Ives, and eventually St. Joseph’s School for the children of Thibeau and the nearby village of Dubre.\n\nLike most of rural Haiti, Thibeau and its surrounding villages lack safe water, electricity, plumbing, and access to education. Life for the rural poor is very difficult. Haiti Committee members have seen first hand what life is like in Haiti on St. James’s annual mission trips to Thibeau.\n\nIn an impoverished country like Haiti with an unemployment rate of 80%, education is the most effective way to enable communities to help themselves. To break the cycle of poverty and dependence, education has been a central concern for the Haiti Committee at St. James.\n\nFunding for St. Joseph’s not only provides an education for 100 children in grades K-6, but also a daily meal for its students, many of whom would not eat otherwise. Due to the generosity of St. James Church parishioners, St. Joseph’s continues to grow and thrive.\n\nScholarships are also provided for students to attend post-secondary schools and further their education.\n\nThrough the Sisters of St. Joseph Nursing Scholarship, Judette Sampson of Thibeau is attending the University of Notre Dame in Cap Haitian. Judette is in her final year of study to become a Registered Nurse.\n\nThe Haiti Committee holds three annual events to raise funds and awareness for the needs at St. Ives parish and St. Joseph’s school. September kicks off the Annual Appeal.\n\nPresentations are made during masses and tables are set up to answer questions and receive donations. $260 provides yearly tuition, books and a uniform for a St. Joseph’s student, but any amount helps this worthy cause.\n\nTheir goal is to raise $40,000 this year.\n\nAnother big event is the Annual Haiti Yard Sale held in July. Tons of hard work and effort goes into collecting donations, sorting items and running the sale.\n\nThe Haiti Committee also hosts a pasta dinner in January. Here community members gather to enjoy an Italian dinner in the church hall. Money raised at all of these events goes to help support St. Ives and St. Joseph’s school.\n\nAny interest in joining this rewarding committee? We welcome new members! We meet at 10AM on the first Sunday of each month in the St. James church library."
