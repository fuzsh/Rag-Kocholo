It was founded in Dublin, Ireland, as a Roman Catholic Marian Movement by layman Frank Duff.

His idea was to help Catholic laypeople fulfill their baptismal promises and be able to live their dedication to the Church in an organized structure, supported by fraternity and prayer.\n\nThe Legion was first only open to women, the first men apart from Duff himself joined it in 1929. The legionaries first started out by visiting hospitals, but they were soon active among the most destitute, notably among Dublin prostitutes. Frank Duff subsequently laid down the system of the Legion in the Handbook of the Legion of Mary in 1928.\n\nThe Legion of Mary soon spread from Ireland to other countries and continents. At first, the Legion often met with mistrust due to its dedication to lay apostolate which was unusual for the time. Only after Pope Pius XI expressed praise for the Legion in 1931 did distrust fade.\n\nMost prominent for spreading the Legion was the Irish legionary Edel Mary Quinn for her activities in Africa during the 1930s and 1940s. Her dedication to the mission of the Legion even in the face of her ill health due to tuberculosis brought her great admiration in and outside of the Legion. A beatification process is currently underway for her and for Frank Duff\n\nSt. Vincent De Paul Society is seeking new members/volunteers (men and women) in order that we may re-open our neighborhood food pantry in Fall 2021.\n\nPlease contact Jack Hochard at 816-262-1667 or Tim Gach at 816-205-1959.\n\nServicing the South Side of Saint Joseph, Saint James District\n\nThe Society of St. Vincent de Paul offers tangible assistance to those in need on a person-to-person basis. It is this personalized involvement that makes the work of the Society unique. This aid may take the form of intervention, consultation, or often through direct dollar or in-kind service. An essential precept of the Society's work is to provide help while conscientiously maintaining the confidentiality and dignity of those who are served.\n\nWe at St. James Parish participate by serving individuals in our district who have a need for food assistance. Help is dependent upon the size of the family. Thanksgiving and Christmas baskets are also available.\n\n“Extend mercy towards others, so that there can be no one in need whom you meet without helping.

Ushers have taken the lower place, like Martha, so that others can be more fully attentive to the power and majesty of the Sacrifice of the Mass.\n\nUshers also play a special role in greeting strangers and providing hospitality to guests, parents, and the elderly. They serve an indispensable function to the community. Therefore, they too must be of good standing within the Church, duly trained, and otherwise qualified to serve in this way.\n\nIf interested in serving at the altar, please fill out the contact form below."
