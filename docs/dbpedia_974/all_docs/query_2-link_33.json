        "text": "The Philadelphia Register of Historic Places is an inventory of properties that have been designated as historic by the Philadelphia Historical Commission. Today, all properties go through a nomination process before being added to the register.\n\nThe register is split into three documents that include:\n\nProperties with OPA-compliant addresses. These properties have official addresses that are recognized by the Office of Property Assessment (OPA), such as 237â€“49 Arch Street.\n\nProperties without official addresses, such as the Valley Green Inn. These properties instead use approximate addresses.\n\nPublic interiors, objects, structures, and sites. For example, the Grand Court of the Wanamaker Building interior."
