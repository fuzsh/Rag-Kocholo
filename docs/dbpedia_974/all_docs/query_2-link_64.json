        "text": "Shreveport, LA\n\n1874\n\nDate Founded: 1863\n\nIn November 1863, twelve free black members of First Church left that congregation and started meeting outside the city limits on Hart’s Island Road.\n\nThey soon formed a society and met in private homes. They were led by Rev. T.G. Montgomery and Rev. River Landry. They met in the home of Mrs. Mariah Boyd on June 8, 1866. Rev. R.K. Diossy called the church Boyd’s Chapel.\n\nIn 1867, three lots were purchased on Lake Street for $250. The church was renamed St. James in April and Rev. John Boyd was appointed as pastor.\n\nIn 1874, a new structure was built on Lake Street under the leadership of Rev. S.F.H. Morant. After the church was burned down in 1898, it was rebuilt the following year under the leadership of Rev. James O. Brown.\n\nRev. J.C. Calvin was appointed in 1948 and assigned the task of relocating the church. Six lots on the 1600 block of Garden Street were purchased the following year, but there was resistance from nearby white land owners. In 1951, the church bought the Central Christian Church on 850 Hope Street for $75,000. The Day Care Center began that same year.\n\nThe church parsonage at 945 Lewis Place was purchased in1962 under the leadership of Rev. John L. King."
