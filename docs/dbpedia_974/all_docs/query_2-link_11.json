In addition, the church has received the following accolades and acknowledgements: Historic Ithaca Restoration Award, NYS Historical Landmark, National Register of Historic Places, and the Preservation League of NYS Historic Religious Properties Awards. St. James is believed to have been an Underground Railroad Station for slaves fleeing bondage and seeking a new life in the North. Historical figures such as Harriet Tubman, and Frederick Douglass visited St. James often. Alpha Phi Alpha, Cornell's first black fraternity, was born in, and held its first public meeting at St. James in 1906. Hours: Mon-Sat. 9am-5pm or by appointment.",
