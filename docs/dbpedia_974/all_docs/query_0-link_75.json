        "text": "James Fry (1821-1903) is credited as the donor of the historic stained glass windows in the chancel of St Peters Anglican Church in Ballarat.\n\nThe windows were made by the Ferguson & Urie stained glass company of North Melbourne in 1877 at the time when extensions and renovations were being made to St Peter’s. Amongst these improvements was the addition of a new chancel complete with the stained glass windows. James Fry donated £500 towards the chancel and windows on the provision that the church raise the additional funds for a parsonage and a new organ and chamber. [1]\n\nThe Ballarat Star, Vic, Wednesday 20th June 1877, page 3.\n\n“ADDITIONS TO ST. PETERS CHURCH.\n\nWe mentioned recently that some extensive improvements were being made at ST. Peter’s Church, and the approaching completion of the works warrants their being noticed. The church as it stands at present has in use a nave, and on the western side a transept, the original design being for another transept on the east, and an apse at the rear. As regards the apse, Mr Oakden (of Terry and Oakden), Melbourne, altered the design when he was drawing the plans for the western transept, and a chancel was projected instead of the apse. The requirements of the church have now necessitated this plan being carried out, and the work will soon be completed. Messrs James and Creber are superintending the work, and Messrs Llewellyn and Roberts are the contractors. The chancel is built of bluestone, to correspond with body of the church, and the inside measurements are:- Width, 18 feet; depth, 12 feet 6 inches; height of side walls, 20 feet 6 inches. The chancel window is a fine specimen of the stonemason’s art, the tracery being done in Waurn Ponds freestone. Stained glass is now being prepared in Melbourne to fill the window. There will be a small window on each side of the chancel, and a door on the east leads to the vestry. From the floor of the church there will be a step upwards before the chancel arch, and two others within it leading to the altar. An organ chamber is also being built, which will form part of the future eastern transept. The amount of Messrs Llewellyn and Roberts’ contract is about £480, but this amount will be considerably augmented before all the work is done in fitting up the chancel, &c. Mr Fincham, of Melbourne, is building the organ, whose largest pipe will be 16 feet, and the cost of the organ, we understand, will be about £500, so that it will be seen that the church authorities have launched into an expenditure of over £1000, towards which sum, as we mentioned a short time since, Mr. James Fry has contributed the handsome donation of £500. It is expected that all the new works will be finished, and the organ erected, in a little over a month’s time from the present.”\n\nIn early August 1877 the three light stained glass window had arrived from the workshops of the renowned Melbourne stained glass firm of Ferguson & Urie and was erected in the chancel. The Church of England Messenger published a very detailed description of the window:\n\nThe Church of England Messenger and Ecclesiastical Gazette for the Diocese of Melbourne and Ballarat, Vic, Thursday 9th August 1877, page 14.\n\n“The stained-glass window for the chancel of St. Peter’s Church has arrived in Ballaarat, and was placed in position. It is a very good specimen of Messrs. Ferguson and Urie’s art, and it is a matter of congratulation that such excellent workmanship can be produced in the colony. The window is divided into three lights, surmounted by tracery pierced with trefoils. These trefoils are filled with richly-coloured glass, bearing upon a starry background the three emblems of faith, hope, and charity; the heart with the sacred monogram, the cross with the crown of thorns, the anchor with the dove and olive branch. The subject of the central light is the “Ecce Homo.” The side lights, having reference to the pious and charitable lives of the ladies in whose memory the chancel was erected. are illustrations of Mark XIV, 8 (“She hath done what she could’) and Matthew XXV. 40 (“Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me”). In the central light the Saviour stands forth a solemn and mournful figure. Pilate and a Roman soldier occupying the background. Underneath there is a panel with a small but exceedingly well-drawn picture of Christ’s charge to Peter – “Feed my Sheep.” In the apex of the window is the emblem of the Holy Spirit, the dove, descending with rays of light. The right hand picture of Mary wiping the Saviour’s feet with her hair is remarkable for the beauty of the Saviour’s countenance and the grace of His gesture. In the light upon the left-hand side a female figure is casting a garment around an aged man and a child at her feet. The background of both of these pictures is of a similar character – a low wall decorated with scroll-work, overtopped with trees and flowers, the sky space being filled in with ruby glass in irregular lead-work. Underneath are the old church emblems – the Agnus Dei and the Pelican; and above are the Alpha and Omega. The side window, which can be seen only upon entering the chancel, is the more special memorial window, having the upper part a scroll with the text – “Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord;” and at the bottom, a panel with the memorial inscription. The quarries of which the rest of the window is composed are ornamented with fleurs-de-lys, and the effect of the whole is highly satisfactory. The organ has been inspected on behalf of the church authorities, and is pronounced a first-class instrument. No time will now be lost in erecting it in the church.”\n\nThe new chancel of St Peter’s was consecrated on Sunday 12th August 1877 [2]\n\nWhilst there were significant descriptions of the three light chancel window in the tabloids, there was only a minor mention of the smaller single light memorial window erected in the liturgical south wall.\n\n“…The side window, which can be seen only upon entering the chancel, is the more special memorial window, having the upper part a scroll with the text – “Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord;” and at the bottom, a panel with the memorial inscription…”[3]\n\nThe memorial text on the lower panel of the window provides the historic clues about the donor, James Fry, and his generosity to the church and the dates of death of his first two wives, Mary & Williamina.. As stated in 1877, unless you are standing in the chancel of St Peter’s you would not know the window was there. The Gothic design is recognisable as the work of Ferguson & Urie which includes a central scrolling ribbon design containing a piece of scripture from the King James Bible, Revelations Chapter 14, verse 13;\n\n“WRITE BLESSED ARE THE DEAD WHICH DIE IN THE LORD”\n\nUnfortunately, the memorial text at the bottom of the window no longer has back lighting from outside so it can only be read when artificially illuminated from behind. I managed to do that via the simple trick of utilising the smart-phone flashlight function and dangling it down the back of the vent which was sufficient to highlight the text enough to be read. There are many unfortunate paint splatters on the window and the fact that the memorial text cannot be read at all unless illuminated from behind gives the impression that it probably hasn’t been seen or known for many years. Probably not known for longer than I have been alive!\n\n“THIS CHANCEL WAS ERECTED BY\n\nJAMES FRY\n\nTO THE GLORY OF GOD\n\nAND IN AFFECTIONATE REMEMBRANCE OF\n\nMARY FRY, DIED MAY 14th 1863 &\n\nWILLIAMINA FRY DIED APRIL 13th 1876”\n\nJames Fry (1821-1903) was a native of Somersetshire in England and he can be credited as a colonial pioneer of Victoria’s grain growing and flour milling in western districts of Victoria.\n\nHis official biography[4] records that he came to Australia with his wife Mary in 1854 aboard the ‘Brilliant’ but there is no record of their names on the passenger list.\n\nAfter successfully pioneering as a grain grower in the Wimmera region in the late 1850’s, he began his own flour milling operations and entered in partnership with Thomas Creed in the Ascot Flour Mills north of Ballarat. In May of 1857 they dissolved their partnership[5] by mutual consent and James became the sole owner. The mill was known for many years as “Fry’s Ascot Mills” and he expanded it in 1860 by erecting a massive five storey bluestone building to the designs of Ballarat architect Henry Richards Caselli.[6]\n\nIn 1857 the first family tragedy struck when his infant daughter, Mary Grimstead Fry, died on the 2nd of July. James obtained a family grave site at the Miners Rest ‘Dowling Forrest’ cemetery, 10km North West of Ballarat, where his daughter was interred. An imposing monument was later erected on the site which would provide an historic record of the family’s tragedies and history.\n\nBy the early 1860’s James’s milling empire was expanding. In September 1864 he purchased a flour mill at Ballarat opposite Lake Wendouree from “Hassell & Monckton” for £4500 [7]. He expanded the business further via leasing or purchasing mills all over the western districts at Ararat, Donald, St. Arnaud, Horsham, Nhill, Kaniva, Dimboola, and Natimuk[8]. His favoured estate, Sutton Park, at Newlyn near the Ascot mill remained a central hub to all his operations.\n\nFry’s prize winning ‘Ascot Mills’ flour was exhibited at the International Exhibition in London of 1862[9] and by the 1880’s it became a household staple throughout the colony known as Fry’s “Five Stars Flour”.\n\nOn the 14th May 1863 his first wife Mary, nee Gear[10], died at his Sutton Park estate near the Ascot Mills. She was only 45 years old and was interred in the family vault at Miners Rest with their infant daughter Mary Grimstead.\n\nBeing a widower was not a part of James’s future plans and he wasted little time in finding a new companion. On the 21st April 1864, at Brompton Cottage in Brighton, Victoria, he married Williamina Smith (nee Hay), the widow of Mungo Park Smith, Engineer and city surveyor of Melbourne[11].\n\nJames’s generosity was not just confined to the church. In October 1864 he and Williamina hosted a luncheon for his employees and their families. About 60 people were transported to Lake Burrumbeet in four decorated wagons where the best part of the day was taken up by games and; “At noon, a sumptuous dinner was spread and was partaken of with the best of appetites.” Wine and Spirits were supplied in generous quantities and later in the day, as heavy rain set in, the whole party returned to the Ascot mill where singing and dancing continued to a late hour[12]. This was undoubtedly one of the many occasions that James displayed his generosity towards his employees. Some of them would later join him as partners in his milling operations for many years.\n\nOn the 12th of July 1869 a tragic accident occurred at the Wendouree flour mill. On the Monday at about 7:30am a massive 36ft long boiler exploded at the mill. The sound of the explosion could be heard over three miles away and a huge plume of steam and debris could be seen in the air above the mill for many miles around. James’s nephew, Albert Hill, who was acting superintendent at the time, was unfortunately standing next to the boiler when it exploded. Albert was killed instantly. His mangled near naked and disembowelled body was blown more than one hundred yards away and landed in the Swamp on the other side of Wendouree Parade.\n\n“…The clothing was torn into shreds, while the skull was completely smashed in. Both legs were broken, and besides several other terrible wounds, the body was almost disembowelled…”\n\nWhen his body was recovered it was taken to Fry’s residence near the mill. Williamina was so traumatised by the horrific scene that she became seriously ill.[13] The inquest on Albert’s body was held the following day at the Wendouree Parade Hotel, where, coincidentally, some small portions of brick had been thrown a few hundred yards from the explosion and had landed in the bar. Albert’s funeral was held on the 14th and he was interred with James’s first wife Mary and their infant daughter Mary Grimstead at the Miners Rest Cemetery.\n\n“The procession started from Mrs Fry’s residence, Wendouree-parade, and consisted of about thirty well-filled mourning coaches, buggies, &c, and several horsemen.”[14]\n\nJames’s second wife, Williamina died at his Sutton Park estate on the 13th April 1876. Coincidentally she was also only 45 years of age. Williamina was interred with James’s first wife and his nephew Albert at Miners Rest. Whether by coincidence or design, some scriptural text from Revelations 14:13 which appears on their memorial stained glass window at St Peter’s in Ballarat is from the same chapter and verse as that on their monument at Miners Rest:\n\n“Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord: even you saith the Spirit that they may rest from their labours.” Rev. XIV:13″\n\nIn June of 1877, the year following Williamina’s death, James Fry donated £500 to St Peter’s Church for the construction of a new chancel and the stained glass windows. Shortly after this he departed Victoria aboard the ‘Northumberland’ for London[15]. James had been back to the old country a number of times before but this venture would secure his third wife.\n\nAt St. Mary’s, Stoke Newington, London, on the 27th December 1877 he married Louisa Anne Coles[16], the widow of Edward Coles. James and Louisa returned to Melbourne aboard the ‘Chimborazo’[17] in March the following year and she would be his companion for the next twenty three years.\n\nOn the 8th November 1901 Louisa died at Sutton Park aged 75. James had now outlived three wives. Louisa was interred at the Mount Prospect cemetery north of Ballarat and a marble casket type grave-stone was erected over the grave. After more than a century most of the lead letters in the inscription have gone and it’s now almost unreadable:\n\n“In Memory Of, LOUISA ANN, Who for 23 years was the faithful and beloved wife of, JAMES FRY of Sutton Park, who died November 8th 1901, aged 75 years. Beloved by all who knew her.”\n\nJames was now in his early eighties and had not taken an active interest in the flour milling operations since he floated the company on the stock exchange in 1884. He devoted his time to agricultural pursuits at his estate near Newlyn. On Friday the 14th August 1903 James died there at the age of 82 and was buried with his third wife Louisa at Mount Prospect.\n\nThe Ballarat Star, Vic, Monday 17th August 1903, page 1.\n\n“DEATH OF MR. JAMES FRY.\n\nOne of the earliest pioneers of the grain trade in Victoria, Mr James Fry, died on Friday at Sutton Park, Newlyn, at the advanced age of 82. Deceased was a native of Somersetshire, and came to the colony in 1854 in the ship Brilliant, settling first at Geelong with his wife and family, where he purchased a property. After various experiences on the Ballarat goldfields, in 1856 he purchased a property at Ascot, and shortly after secured a flour mill near Geelong, which he removed to that point, as the Talbot shire was fast becoming the centre of a large agricultural district. Beginning in a small way, he built up a very extensive business among the various mining townships, and erected plant and machinery at that time considered to be as complete an establishment as then existed in Australia. In 1865 he purchased a mill near Lake Wendouree, Ballarat, from Messrs Hassell and Monkton, and went there to reside. In 1868 he acquired a freehold property in the Wimmera, situated between Glenorchy and Banyena. He was the first to grow wheat to any extent on the Wimmera Plains, and demonstrate that it could be cultivated there at a profit. From Ballarat, as his centre, he followed up the settlement of the selectors on the land, first around Ararat, and then on to Stawell, having business relations with both places. When growers commenced to select on an extensive scale in the Wimmera, he opened at Horsham, in anticipation of the railway line being continued from Stawell to that centre, and intimately to the border, and as the movement spread, extended his operations till they gradually embraced all the centres in that far-reaching territory. In addition to the large grain business, Mr Fry erected, brought or leased flour mills at Ballarat, Ararat, Donald, St. Arnaud, Horsham, Nhill, Kaniva, Dimboola, and Natimuk. In 1884 the grain and milling business having reached large dimensions, with its head office in Melbourne, and branches in all the leading grain growing districts of the Wimmera and other parts of the colony, he decided to float it into a limited company, which was successfully accomplished, and shortly afterwards retired from the active management, devoting most of his time thenceforth to grazing and agricultural pursuits.\n\nAt St. Peter’s Church yesterday, notice was taken of the death of Mr Fry. Mr Fry gave the land on which St. Peter’s Vicarage stands; the chancel, with a stained glass window; the tower and the bells, to St. Peter’s Church. The flag was flown at half-mast throughout the day, and muffled peals were rang on the bells. Before the service in the morning, the rev. Dr Pritchard alluded to the sad event. He reminded the congregation of all the late Mr Fry’s generous gifts, and said that he was a regular and frequent worshipper at ST. Peter’s when resident in the parish. Such a good example of generous help to the house of God should cause his name to be ever held in honored remembrance at St. Peter’s and they should pray that others might emulate such generous deeds. At the evening service similar reference was made, and special music was sung at the offertory. Mr L. Richardson played Mendelssohn’s Funeral March at the close of service.”\n\nOn the opposite side of the gravestone to Louisa’s memorial words are his;\n\n“IN LOVING REMEMBRANCE OF JAMES FRY, WHO DIED ON AUG 14th 1903, AT SUTTON PARK NEWLYN, AGED 82 YEARS AND 6ms. I HAVE GIVEN YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT YE SHOULD DO AS I HAVE DONE TO YOU. 1 JOHN 13-15”\n\nJames Fry’s total estate was valued at £128,400 and it was distributed to many family members in Australia and England. It included provisions for his daughter, step daughters, step granddaughters, the Ballarat Church of England, and his surviving son, James Rood Fry.\n\nThe Sutton Park Estate was left to his son James but by 1918 it was under control of the government for soldier settlement purposes.[18]\n\nToday, on a lonely dirt intersection amongst the farmland at Newlyn, you will find the original gates that once framed the entrance to Sutton Park. They now form part of an historic memorial of the district and nearby a stone cairn holds a plaque showing how the estate was divided for soldier settlement.\n\nThe gravesites at Miners rest and Mount Prospect, some of the old crumbling mill buildings around the district, the old gates to Sutton Park, and the stained glass windows at St Peter’s Church in Ballarat are the last physical reminders of a Colonial Pioneer and his family who shaped the western district of Victoria.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[1] The Ballarat Star, Vic, Monday 11th June 1877, page 3\n\n[2] The Ballarat Star, Vic, Monday 13th August 1877, page 3.\n\n[3] The Church of England Messenger and Ecclesiastical Gazette for the Diocese of Melbourne and Ballarat, Vic, Thursday 9th August 1877, page 14.\n\n[4] Australian Dictionary of Biography: Fry, James (1821-1903)\n\n[5] The Star, Ballarat, Vic, Tuesday 26th May 1857, page 4.\n\n[6] The Star, Ballarat, Vic, Tuesday 14th August 1860, page 4.\n\n[7] The Star, Ballarat, Vic, Friday 30th September 1864, page 2.\n\n[8] The Ballarat Star, Vic, Monday 17th August 1903, page 1.\n\n[9] Victorian Govt Gazette, Tuesday 14th April 1863, page 842.\n\n[10] Daughter of John Gear (or Gean) and Jane Grimstead.\n\n[11] The Age, Melbourne, Vic, Monday 25th April 1864, page 4.\n\n[12] The Star, Ballarat, Vic, Saturday 29th October 1864, page 2.\n\n[13] The Ballarat Star, Vic, Tuesday 13th July 1869, page 2.\n\n[14] The Age, Melbourne, Vic, Friday 16th July 1869, page 4.\n\n[15] Geelong Advertiser, Vic, Tuesday 19th June 1877, page 9.\n\n[16] The Bath Chronicle, Somerset, England, Thursday 10th Jan 1878, page 5.\n\n[17] The Argus, Melbourne, Vic, Monday 11th March 1878, page 5.\n\n[18] The Age, Melbourne, Vic, Saturday 24th October 1903, page 11.\n\nShort link to this page: http://wp.me/p28nLD-2Mv\n\nThis is a new research article based on new information.\n\nThe old article can be seen at: http://wp.me/p28nLD-Uv\n\n© Copyright\n\nThirty kilometres north of Melbourne and eleven kilometres east of Sunbury is the township of Bulla which derives its name from the aboriginal word ‘Bulla-Bulla’ and means ‘two round low hills’ or ‘the two breasts.’[1] Most Victorians today probably know the name Bulla for its famous “Bulla Ice cream,” made by the Bulla Dairy Company since 1910.\n\nIn late 1842, Royal Navy Officer William Pomeroy Greene arrived in the Bulla area with his wife Anne and their seven children and a portable pre-fabricated house they brought out from England. They settled at ‘Woodlands,’ which is a few kilometres east of the town of Bulla and just north of the Tullamarine airport runway. The “Woodlands Historic Park” and restored homestead is now administered by Parks Victoria and is open to the public. It’s also home of the “Living Legends” which is the International Home of Rest for Champion Horses.\n\nAnne Greene (nee Griffith) donated the land for St Mary’s Anglican Church at Bulla and in the presence of Bishop Charles Perry she laid its foundation stone on Friday 23rd July 1858.[2] The church was consecrated on the 2nd September 1864[3] at which time the new chancel was added and the liturgical east tripartite stained glass window by the North Melbourne firm Ferguson & Urie had been installed. This window was the gift of Anne’s sister in-law, Jane Catherine Griffith, the wife of her late brother Charles James Griffith.\n\nSt Mary’s Church was originally located on the corner of Oaklands and Bulla Roads, a few kilometres east of the town of Bulla and a short distance south of Woodlands, but more than a century later the church was in the path of the expanding Tullamarine airport runway. The introduction of the Jumbo jets, 24 hour airport operations, and the extensions to the runway was deemed a significant structural threat to the church and so it had to be moved.\n\nOn the 22nd January 1971 the final wedding ceremony was held in St Mary’s before it was dismantled and moved to its present site in the township of Bulla[4]. The church was reopened in its new location on the 24th November 1974 and was consecrated by Rev. Frank Woods in the presence of the Governor of Victoria, Sir Henry Arthur Winneke.\n\nSt Mary’s is no longer used for religious services and has been returned to the control of the Anglican Diocese property management. Its unknown what the future holds for the old church or what will become of the historic stained glass windows.\n\nPhotos taken: 17th April 2015.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n[show image library]\n\nThe stained glass window is an easily recognised work by the Ferguson & Urie company. The apex of the centre light depicts the descending Dove. The centre contains a crimson floriated cross with an azure blue background containing passion flowers and vine leaves. A scrolling ribbon which flows around the cross contains the words: “I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVETH Job 19-25.” The scene in the bottom third of the window depicts the three Mary’s at the empty tomb with an angel proclaiming, as written in the text below the scene, “HE IS NOT HERE”. At the very base of this window is the dedicatory text: “Presented by Mrs Charles Griffith 1864.” The flanking side lights contain identical Gothic floral designs with diamond quarries filled with the Fleur-de-lys pattern. The centre design of these lights is the monogram “I.H.S.” in blue on a crimson background and incorporates the crown of majesty.\n\nAnne Greene (nee Griffith 1795-1865).\n\nAnne Greene laid the foundation stone of St Mary’s at Bulla in 1858 on land that she had donated for the church. Anne was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1795, the daughter of Richard Griffith and Mary Hussey Burgh. She married former Royal Navy Officer William Pomeroy Greene (c.1797-1845) in Ireland on the 31st March 1826. For the sake of William’s health they emigrated to Australia and arrived at Port Phillip aboard the barque Sarah on the 5th December 1842 accompanied by their seven children and a prefabricated portable house which would be erected at “Woodlands” near Sunbury. William died at Woodlands on the 5th March 1845.\n\nAnne was the sister of Sir Richard Griffith (1784-1878) and Charles James Griffith (1808-1863). Anne died aged 69, on the 13th March 1865 at ‘d’Estaville,’ the residence of Sir William Stawell, at Barry Street Kew, Victoria.\n\nCharles James Griffith (1808-1863):\n\nJane Catherine Griffith (nee Magee), the wife of Charles James Griffith, was the donor of the Ferguson & Urie stained glass window for the new chancel of St Mary’s Anglican Church at Bulla in 1864[5].\n\nHer husband Charles was born in Millicent, Kildare, Ireland, in 1808, the sixth son of Richard Griffith and Mary Hussey Burgh and was educated in the legal profession at Trinity College Dublin and was admitted to the Irish bar circa 1831. On arrival in Australia in 1840 he settled at ‘Glenmore’ near Bacchus Marsh as a sheep farmer and never practiced in the legal profession in the colony. On a return visit to Ireland in the 1840’s he married Jane Catherine Magee in Dublin on the 16th December 1846. On their return to Australia he began his political career after nominations by Charles La Trobe in the early 1850’s. In 1854 Bishop Charles Perry appointed him Chancellor of the Melbourne Diocese and until the time of his death he was an active member of the Acclimatisation Society[6].\n\nCharles Griffith died at his home ‘Tempe,’ Dandenong Road Prahran, on the 31st July 1863 aged 55[7]. They had no children.\n\nAt 11 o’clock on the 4th August 1863 his funeral service moved from St James’s Old Cathedral[8] to his place of interment at the Melbourne General Cemetery. The portion of the Griffith and Greene family headstone at the Melbourne General Cemetery that contains his epitaph reads:\n\n“Sacred to the memory of Charles James GRIFFITH Esq who departed this life on 31 Jul 1863 age 56 years. This headstone is erected by Jane C. GRIFFITH as a tribute of love and affection to her beloved husband for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. Thess. iv. IHS.” [9]\n\nHis will, dated 2nd Dec 1861, provided modest sums to his wife Jane and other family members as well as a sizeable sum to Bishop Perry for the Church of England;\n\n“…To the Bishop of Melbourne for the time being, one thousand pounds to be applied according to his discretion to the general purposes of the Church of England in the diocese of Melbourne…”[10]\n\nSignificant tabloid transcriptions:\n\nThe Argus, Melbourne, Vic, Wednesday 28th July 1858, page 5.\n\n“CHURCH OF ENGLAND, BULLA BULLA.- The foundation-stone of the new Episcopal church at Bulla Bulla was laid by Mrs. Greene (the donor of the land which the building is to be erected) on Friday last. Bishop Perry presided at the ceremony. The Church is to have a nave, transept, and chancel, in the early English period of architecture, with a tower and spire at the north-west angle, which will form the principal entrance to the building. The portions at present in course of erection are the nave, tower, and spire, and the whole is being executed in blue stone procured in the neighborhood, and carted to the site free of charge by the settlers in the district.”\n\nThe Argus, Melbourne, Vic, Monday 3rd August 1863, page 5.\n\n“We regret to have to announce the death of Mr. C. J. Griffiths [sic], a gentleman who for many years past has taken an active part in the public affairs of the colony, and has also been connected with it in various official capacities. Mr. Griffiths had been ailing for a considerable period, and within the last ten days his complaint, which his medical advisers, Dr. Pugh and Mr. Rudall, decided to be aneurism, assumed a formidable aspect. The death took place at Mr. Griffith’s residence, Dandenong-road, on Friday evening last.”\n\nThe Argus, Melbourne, Vic, Tuesday 4th August 1863, page 5.\n\n“MR. C. J. GRIFFITH.\n\nYesterday, we recorded the death of Mr. Charles James Griffith. The removal – sudden and unlooked for – of one of the first settlers of the colony, a gentleman who, privately, was widely known and highly esteemed, and whose public career was neither brief nor unimportant, demands more than passing notice.\n\nMr. Griffith was the sixth son of Richard Griffith , Esq., M.P., of Millicent, Kildare, by Mary, daughter of Lord Chief Baron Hussey Burgh. He was born August, 1808; graduated as M.A. at Trinity College, Dublin; and was called to the bar about 1831. In 1840, Mr. Griffith arrived at Port Philip, and settled at Glenmore, near Bacchus Marsh as a sheep farmer. On the separation of the colony of Victoria from New South Wales, Mr. Griffith was appointed by the Superintendent (Mr. La Trobe) one of the nominee members of the Legislative Council, and afterwards he was elected to Parliament by the constituency of Dundas and Follet. In 1853 he was appointed President of the Board of Commissioners of Water Supply and Sewerage. Under his presidency the board, in the face of continued violent opposition and adverse criticism, carried out the Yan Yean scheme; but after surmounting all the difficulties of the undertaking, Mr. Griffith resigned his office. The ministry of the day conceived they had a right to command the votes of all members of Parliament who were connected with the public service, and Mr. Griffith declined to sacrifice his independence. Upon the new Constitution coming into operation, Mr. Griffith’s friends decided to propose him for the Speakership of the Legislative Assembly. The present Speaker was also nominated, and succeeded in securing the votes of a majority of the House. Continued private and public exertions weakening Mr. Griffith’s health, he paid a visit to Europe, in 1858 and did not return to Victoria until April, 1862. Lately he was a candidate for the seat in the Legislative Council for North-Western Province to which Mr. Jenner was elected, and at the time of his decease he held the appointments of Chairman of the Board of Education and Commissioner under the Real Property Act. Mr. Griffith always took a prominent part in the affairs of the Church of England. From the time of its creation, he filled the office of chancellor of the diocese, and he was an active member of the Church Assembly from the period of the formation of that body. Mr Griffith married in the colony [sic], and leaves a widow without family. Although his health has been declining for some time past, it is but the other day that he was engaged in the active discharge of his duties, and until less than a week of his decease, the fatal termination of the attack which confined him to his chamber was not anticipated.”\n\nThe Age, Vic, Wednesday 5th August 1863, page 5.\n\n“The Council of the Acclimatisation Society met yesterday, as usual, and the following resolution was unanimously passed:- “The council of the Acclimatisation Society hereby express their deep regret at the death of C. J. Griffith, Esq., their highly valued colleague, and unanimously resolve that the council do now adjourn, in order thereby to testify their respect for the memory of the departed gentleman; and further, that the minute be entered on the records of the council.” The council adjourned accordingly.”\n\nBendigo Advertiser, Vic, Thursday 6th August 1863, page 3.\n\n“MELBOURNE NEWS.\n\n(Herald.)\n\nThe funerals of two old and highly respected colonists took place on Tuesday, and both were numerously attended. The funeral of the late Mr. C. J. Griffith, Chancellor of the Diocese, took place in the morning. A special service was performed at St. James’s Cathedral, at eleven o’clock, at which the very Rev the Dean of Melbourne officiated, assisted by the Rev S. L. Chase, and the Rev M. H. Becher, incumbent. The Rev C. T. Perks, and the Rev D. Seddon, were also present. The coffin was then borne to the hearse, the following gentlemen acting as pall-bearers:- Sir W. F. Stawell, the hon W. H. Mitchell, M.L.C.; Captain McMahon, M.L.A; hon T. T. A’Beckett, M.L.C; and Sir Redmond Barry. The cortege consisted of four mourning coaches, and about twenty private carriages, including his Excellency the Governor’s, which was closed. The funeral was attended by a large number of the members of both houses of Parliament, and many gentlemen with whom the deceased had been so long associated, and by them held in high esteem. The procession proceeded from the Cathedral along Collins and Swanston streets to the new cemetery, were [sic] the last rites were performed by the Dean.”\n\nPortland Guardian, Vic, Monday 10th August 1863, page 3.\n\n“THE LATE C. J. GRIFFITH, ESQ.\n\n(From the “Herald” of 4th inst.)\n\nMr. Charles James Griffith, who expired suddenly, on Saturday last from aneurism of the aorta, was a very old colonist. He was a member of the bar, but never practiced his profession in the colony, but was principally engaged in pastoral pursuits; and at the time of his death held, in conjunction with Mr. Molesworth Greene, one of the largest stations in the country. Mr. Griffith has also taken a very active part in public affairs. He was a nominee member of the old Legislative Council, and took a prominent part in debates. When the new Parliament was called into existence Mr. Griffith was chosen as the representative of Dundas and Follet; and on the 21st of Nov., 1856, was nominated for the office of speaker, in opposition to Sir Francis Murphy, who was elected. At that time Mr. Griffith occupied the position of President of the Board of Sewerage and Water Supply, and he continued to fulfil the duties appertaining to the office until the completion of the Yan Yean works. Mr. Griffiths supported the Haines administration, and manifested a great interest in the various questions which came before the House in that session, including the Electoral Bill, the Land Bill, and the bill for the formation of a trunk line of railway. Mr. Griffith long held the appointment of chancellor of the diocese of Melbourne, and was for some time a Member of the Council of the University. About three years since, he visited England, and returned about nine months ago. On the composition of the new Education Board, Mr. Griffith was chosen as one of the members as representing the Church of England interest. On March last he unsuccessfully contested the South-Western Province with Mr. Jenner. Mr. Griffith has, at all times exhibited a warm interest in the cause of Education, and in all matters appertaining to the church of which he was a member. In 1845, he published a short work giving a history of the colony; and while he held the office of President of water supply, he wrote a pamphlet in answer to the many quibbles and objections that were raised at the time in reference to the scheme. Mr. Griffith was highly respected by all classes of colonists. He was connected, by marriage, with the families of Sir W. F. Stawell, the Dean of Melbourne, and Mr. R. F. Greene.\n\nThe Argus says the deceased Mr. Griffith was the sixth son of Richard Griffith, Esq., M.P. of Millicent, Kildare, by Mary, daughter of Lord Chief Baron Hussey Burgh. He was born August, 1808; graduated as M.A. at Trinity College, Dublin; and was called to the bar abut 1831.”\n\nThe Argus, Melbourne, Tuesday 14th March 1865, page 4.\n\n“GREENE.- On the 13th inst., at D’Eastaville, Anne Greene, widow of the late William Pomeroy Greene, Esq., R.N., of Woodlands.”\n\nThe Argus, Melbourne, Vic, Saturday 22 July 1939, page 9.\n\n“OLD ANGLICAN CHURCH.\n\nBulla Anniversary\n\nSt Mary’s Church of England, Bulla, a link with the pioneers, will celebrate its 81st anniversary at a special service at 3 p.m. on Sunday, July 30. The anniversary service is invariably the occasion for a reunion among families and descendants of families who have been associated with the church. Before the church was erected services were held in the barn at Woodlands, then the property of the late Mr. Rawdon Greene. The church was founded by Mrs. Greene and was built on land which was formerly part of the Woodlands Estate, the foundation-stone being laid on Friday, July 23, 1858, by Bishop Perry. The church was officially licensed on September 2, 1864, when the beautiful east window was presented by the late Mr. Charles Griffiths [sic]. In 1922 a complete set of memorial windows for the nave of the church was given by the prominent families.\n\nExcepting the floor, the church is in excellent condition. Since the Rev. A. G. Mee has been in charge of the parish of Broadmeadows funds have been raised for repairs to the church. The preacher on July 30 will be the Rev. C. Hedly Raymond, vicar of St. Thomas’s, Essendon, and Rural Dean of Melbourne North. The choir of St. Paul’s Church, Ascotvale, will assist.”\n\nExternal Links:\n\nhttp://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/search/nattrust_result_detail/65967\n\nMy thanks to Diedre from the Melbourne Anglican Diocese for arranging access and for her valuable time and patience.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[1] Sunbury News, Vic, Saturday 4th July 1910, page 2.\n\n[2] The Argus, Melbourne, Vic, Wednesday 28th July 1858, page 5.\n\n[3] The Argus, Melbourne, Vic, Saturday 22 July 1939, page 9.\n\n[4] The Canberra Times, Friday 22nd January 1971, page 3.\n\n[5] The Argus, Melbourne, Vic, Saturday 22 July 1939, page 9.\n\n[6] The Age, Vic, Wednesday 5th August 1863, page 5.\n\n[7] The Argus, Melbourne, Vic, Monday 3rd August 1863, page 4.\n\n[8] The Argus, Melbourne, Vic, Tuesday 4th August 1863, page 8.\n\n[9] Melbourne General Cemetery [CofE, Compartment O, grave 93]\n\n[10] Public Records Office, Vic, Probate file 4/448\n\n© Copyright\n\nThe ongoing research to find extant Ferguson & Urie stained glass has revealed many of their works of art in remote locations, sometimes thousands of kilometres from the company’s workshops in North Melbourne.\n\nThe latest discovery is in the tiny township of Porangahau on the South East coast of New Zealand’s North Island. The Anglican church of St Michael and All Angels in Porangahau is now the sixth location in New Zealand found to contain an historic Ferguson & Urie stained glass window. This window is the only one known to have been created by the company as a memorial to a soldier who died in an armed conflict in the Antipodes.\n\nPhotos: From St Michaels, Porangahau, NZ, Janice Ball, New Zealand 11th March 2014.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n[See all attached files]\n\nThe idea for a memorial stained glass window in St Michael’s was conceived as early as 1878 when the Porangahau congregation began to raise subscriptions to build the church.\n\nOn the 22nd of July 1878 it was reported that a local land owner by the name of John Davis Canning had presented £125 towards the cost of a stained glass window to be erected in memory of his brother, Davis Canning, who fell in action at Ruatikuri during the Maori Wars on the 8th August 1868[1].\n\nTwo years later, in September 1880, a tabloid correspondent described the progress of the church construction and of the stained glass window they wrote:\n\n“…The effect, seen when sunlight falls on it, is grand, and the chiaroscuro well defined – in fact the whole would do credit to a large old world cathedral, and is, I believe, not equaled in this colony. It is grand – more cannot be said…”[2]\n\nSt Michael’s was consecrated on Friday 11th February 1881 by the Bishop of Waiapu and the following Tuesday the Hawke’s Bay Herald described the three light stained glass window in great detail. The Ferguson & Urie stained glass company of Melbourne were explicitly mentioned as the firm who made it;\n\n“…One great feature, internally is a large stained-glass east window, containing three lights and tracery. The subjects are the baptism of our Lord, the Crucifixion, and the Resurrection. The draperies about the figures are of the richest quality of antique glass the colors being so arranged as to blend harmoniously, while all crude or harsh coloring is avoided. The background is light grisailler work, so subdued as to make the subjects stand out prominently. On the lower panels and in the tracery are suitable emblems and monograms. The general effect is exceedingly rich and handsome. Beneath it is a brass plate bearing the following inscription:- “This window is erected by the family, in memory of Davis Canning, gent., who fell in action at Ruatikuri, 8th August, 1868 whilst leading the advanced guard,” The window is from the firm of Ferguson and Urie, Melbourne…” [3]\n\nThe precise description of the window given in 1881 matches that of the east window in St Michael’s today. The photographs taken by Janice on the 11th March 2014 leave absolutely no doubt that it is the work of Ferguson & Urie, but there is a strange anomaly with this window that appears to have gone undetected for possibly fifty years or more!\n\nBeneath each of the biblical scenes is a reference to a chapter and verse from St Mark in the King James Bible which would aptly describe the event depicted above but the chapter and verse beneath the first two are under the wrong windows!\n\nThe reference under each window is currently shown as;\n\n“Mark c.15 v.25” – (“And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.”) This reference is located under the first window on the left which depicts Jesus being Baptised by John in the River Jordan. Below this is the Lamb of God or ‘Agnus Dei,’\n\n“Mark c.1 v.9” – (“And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptised of John in Jordan”). This reference is located under the centre window depicting Christ being crucified. Below this is the Pelican in the act of self-sacrifice feeding its own blood to her young.\n\n“Mark c.16 v.6” – (“And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him”). This reference is, correctly, located under the right window depicting Christ emerging from the tomb in the Resurrection. Below this is the phoenix rising.\n\nLogically, the reference “Mark c.15 v.25” should be under the centre window depicting the Crucifixion and “Mark c.1 c.9” should be under the first window depicting the Baptism.\n\nOn the 27th Feb 2014, descendant Davis Canning wrote:\n\n“It [the window] was completely redone (removed, repaired, releaded and reinstalled, rededicated etc) in the early 1960’s I think and was in good condition even then. I was responsible for the complete restoration of the church in 1998 and the east window was in such good condition it did not need any work done on it. I think it is still sound and has an exterior cage over it so it is not damaged by bird strike…”\n\nThe 1960’s restoration would seem to be the most likely point in time that the pieces of the window with the bible verses were re-installed in the wrong order. It could be argued as to whether the lower scenes depicting the Lamb and Pelican are also under the wrong scenes, meaning that possibly the entire lower sections of the window have been swapped.\n\nIt’s not known whether there had been any other restoration work done on the window prior to the 1960s, but most historical stained glass windows usually require some significant conservation work every fifty years or so depending on their level of exposure to the weather.\n\nThere have probably been many events in the last 130 years that could have decided the fate of this historical window. Its most recent miraculous escape from disaster occurred in December 2011 when a fire broke out in the church and destroyed the altar. Fortunately, the fire was contained to the altar space only and there was no reported damage to the window[4].\n\nEvery step of the research draws you deeper into the history of the window. It’s not just a remarkable piece of work by the Ferguson & Urie stained glass company, it has a story to tell of its own, apart from the biblical one, such as who was it dedicated to and who was the donor? There is also the remarkable coincidental link to another memorial stained glass window to the Canning brothers on the other side of the world which I’ll explain further on.\n\nJohn Davis Canning (1822-1883)\n\nJohn Davis Canning (1822-1883) was the donor of the stained glass window at St Michael’s in Porangahau.\n\nHe was born at Ogbourne, St Andrews, Wiltshire, in 1822 and arrived at Port Cooper (Lyttelton), New Zealand aboard the “Cornwall” on the 10th December 1851with another brother, Charles[5]. He later proceeded to Hawke’s Bay circa 1852 where he took up “Oakburne” located between Waipukurau and Porangahau.\n\nOn the 1st of July 1863, he was commissioned to the rank of Ensign in the New Zealand militia[6] and on the 4th of May, the following year was promoted to Lieutenant[7].\n\nThe years 1868 and 1869 were tumultuous times for John Davis Canning. In November 1867 his mother Elizabeth (nee Tanner) died aged 74 at Weyhill near Andover[8] and in August 1868, at the height of the Maori wars, his younger brother Davis rode off to join Colonel Whitmore’s troops in the hunt for the Hauhaus and was killed at Ruakaturi on the 8th August 1868.\n\nJust over two weeks after the death of his brother he married Elspeth McQueen (1837-1920) at Mangatarata farmstead in the central Hawke’s Bay area.[9]\n\nBetween 1869 and 1872 John and Elspeth had three children but Elspeth became ill and was invalided back to Wiltshire for the benefit of her health. In 1881 John began to make arrangements for his return to England to visit Elspeth and in mid-February of 1881, he placed advertisements in the newspapers to sell a number of his short horn cattle, draught horses, and Cotswold rams at public auction[10]. By late March he was temporarily residing at the Hawke’s Bay Club in Napier and on the 28th of March he advertised that was looking for a suitable house in Napier for short-term lease;\n\n“WANTED, in eligible situation, with a good view and a desirable situation on the hills, a Commodious House (furnished), with good garden and grounds, for a period of at least three months. Apply, stating particulars, to John Davis Canning, Hawke’s Bay Club, Napier. 28th March, 1881”[11]\n\nOn the 24th of October 1881 he resigned his commission as a Justice of the Peace[12] and shortly after returned to England. His health declined over the following two years and he died at Marlborough on the 20th September 1883 aged 61. [13]\n\n“News has been received by cable of the death of Mr John Davis Canning at Marlborough, England, on Thursday last. Mr Canning was one of our earliest settlers arriving about 1855 [sic]. At one time he was in partnership with Mr John Harding in the Mount Vernon run, and on dissolving the partnership Mr Canning for some time occupied part of Mr Tiffen’s Homewood run, subsequently removing to Wallingford, where he acquired a considerable tract of native land. There he resided until he left for England, about two years ago. Mr Canning was an excellent judge of stock, and his importations, especially of shorthorns and horses, did much to improve the stock of Hawke’s Bay.”[14]\n\nJohn was buried in the Ogbourne, St Andrew’s Churchyard in Wiltshire. His gravestone still exists and although the memorial text is fading with time it still can be read;\n\n“John Davis CANNING, Who died Sept 20th 1883, Aged 61 years.”\n\nIn 1884 his sister Elizabeth commissioned a stained glass window to be erected in St. Andrew’s in Memory of her brothers John and Davis. Legend has it that the window in St Michael’s at Porangahau was a copy of the window in St Andrew’s in Wiltshire:\n\n“The east window at St Michael and All Angels Anglican Church in Porangahau was given by the family in his memory and is a copy of the window in the church at Ogbourne, St Andrews…”[15]\n\nUnfortunately, this legendary tale is not true. The stained glass window at St. Andrews in Wiltshire was erected three years after the window at St Michael’s at Porangahau in New Zealand and it doesn’t follow the same biblical theme, or resemble the figurative work in any way whatsoever.\n\nThe memorial text on a brass plaque at the foot of the Canning memorial window at St Andrew’s church in Wiltshire reads;\n\n“TO THE GLORY OF GOD AND IN LOVING MEMORY OF JOHN DAVIS CANNING WHO DIED SEPT 20th 1883 AGED 61, ALSO DAVIS CANNING WHO DIED AUGUST 8th 1868 AGED 39. THIS WINDOW IS DEDICATED BY THEIR SISTER, ELIZABETH MARY MOORE, A.D. 1884.”\n\nThe upper half of the window at St Andrew’s depicts four women representing “Fortitudo” (Fortitude), “Temperantia” (Temperance), “Justitia” (Justice), and “Sapientia” (Wisdom).\n\nThe scenes in the lower half of the window depict what I believe are four of the acts from the Corporal Works of Mercy. On the other side of the world, the Ferguson & Urie window at Porangahau in New Zealand depicts Baptism, Crucifixion, and Resurrection.\n\nJohn’s wife Elspeth eventually made a full recovery in England and in the early 1890s returned to New Zealand where she resided at Napier in good health into her advanced years[16].\n\nElspeth died in New Zealand in 1920 at the age of 86[17].\n\nDavis Canning (1829-1868)[18]\n\nThe Ferguson & Urie stained glass window in St Michael’s is a memorial to Davis Canning, the younger brother of John Davis Canning.\n\nWhen Davis actually arrived in New Zealand is not known, but can reasonably be assumed to be 1852 or later. His brothers John and Charles arrived aboard the “Cornwall” from England in December 1851 but Davis was not listed as a passenger on the same ship with them.\n\nDavis resided at “Oakburne” near Porangahau with his brother John. At the age of 39 he was described as a “young man full of adventure.”[19] It was probably inevitable that this adventurous spirit would lead him to joining the militia. Sometime in late September or early August 1868 he rode off and joined Colonel Whitmore’s government forces to fight against the Hauhaus led by the Maori rebel “Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Tūruki.”\n\nOn the 8th August 1868, during a battle at Ruakituri, Davis Canning and a Captain Oswald Carr were shot dead[20];\n\n“…On the 8th the force was well up the gorge-like valley of the Ruakituri, and the advance-guard led by Mr. Davis Canning, a gallant settler from Hawke’s Bay, was hot on the trail of the Hauhaus, who were heard shooting pigeons in the distance. Early in the afternoon Captain Carr (Hawke’s Bay), who had been an officer in the Royal Artillery, reconnoitered through the bush along the river-bank, and reported that the Hauhaus were halted a short distance up the river. The swift and ice-cold river was forded several times and the European and Maori force advanced to the attack. Captain (afterwards Colonel) Herrick with part of the force moved on to take the Hauhaus in flank and reverse, and when his men were in position Whitmore directed the advance-guard to push forward. It was soon driven back, leaving both Canning and Carr dead on the field. The former was shot dead while gallantly leading the men…”[21]\n\nTen years later, in July 1878, his older brother John Davis Canning subscribed the amount of £125 towards a stained glass window to be erected in memory of his brother in the yet to be erected St Michael’s Church at Porangahau[22]. In September of the same year the Hawke’s Bay Herald reported something similar but with a differing cost for the window;\n\n“…J. D. Canning, Esq., of Oakbourne, has given a superb stained glass window of the value of £150…”[23]\n\nSt Michael’s was consecrated by the Bishop of Waiapu in 1881 and the Ferguson & Urie stained glass window to the memory of Davis Canning still exists to this day.\n\nBeneath the window is a brass plaque inscribed:\n\n“This window is erected by the family, in memory of Davis Canning, gent., who fell in action at Ruakituri, 8th August, 1868 whilst leading the advanced guard.”\n\nAnother memorial to Davis appears at Ruakituri Cemetery Reserve near Wairoa. A brass plaque is mounted on a rock cairn in memory of Davis Canning[24] and Canning family lore has it that this plaque went missing after a flood in the late 1800’s and was missing for over a century until being found in the 1980’s-90’s in a creek bed two miles away.\n\nThe plaque has the wording:\n\n“IN MEMORY OF DAVIS CANNING, KILLED IN ACTION 8th AUGUST 1868”.\n\n“NE CEDE MALIS SED CONTRA”[25]\n\n(Latin: “Yield not to misfortunes, but advance all the more boldly against them”)\n\nSignificant historical newspaper transcriptions:\n\nHawke’s Bay Herald, NZ, Vol 12, Issue 969, 15 August 1868, page 3.\n\n“IMPORTANT FROM THE FRONT. SEVERE ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN FORCES UNDER COL. WHITMORE AND EX PRISONERS…\n\n…We deeply regret to add that among the killed were Capt. Carr of Petane and Mr. Davis Canning, two esteemed settlers of this province…”\n\nStar, NZ, Issue 97, 4th September 1868, page 3.\n\n“…The advance guard, comprising several of the armed constabulary, and led by Captain Carr and Mr. Canning, advanced to the front of the enemy’s lines and were on the eve of carrying the position when the hau-haus poured in a hot fire, which forced them to take cover. The action then commenced hot on both sides; and in another attempt to charge the position, Mr Canning and Captain Carr lost their lives…”\n\nHawke’s Bay Herald, NZ, Vol XXI, Issue 5133, Monday 22nd July 1878, page 2\n\n“Our Porangahau correspondent writes: – The need of a church has long been felt and numerous gentlemen having promised subscription to the amount of £365, it is hoped that the good work will speedily be accomplished. It is proposed that the sum of £600 be collected for the above purpose, exclusive of the sum of £125 presented by J. D. Canning, Esq., of Oakbourne, for a stained glass window, in memory of his brother, the late Mr Davis Canning. A series of concerts are to be given for the purpose of raising funds to furnish the sum required. The following gentlemen have already subscribed:- J. Nairn, £100; George hunter, £50; J. D. Ormond, £50; Rev S. Williams, £50; A. St. Hill, £10; J. White, £50; T. Spencer, £5; Trust Fund, £50.

As I understand, it was presented by Mr John D. Canning, of Oakbourne, in memory that gentleman’s late brother, Mr Davis Canning, and as a work of art it does great credit tothe artist, and as much to the selector of the design. It is in the mediaeval style, Gothic, with teinte brilliante of the Rennaissance. The effect, seen when sunlight falls on it, is grand, and the chiaroscuro well defined – in fact the whole would do credit to a large old world cathedral, and is, I believe, not equalled in this colony. It is grand – more cannot be said.\n\nAlthough the church is by no means finished, yet, as far as the work has gone, it is a great credit to the contractor, Mr Holt, of Napier, and also to his foreman of works, Mr. Wm. Smith, for, though I am no judge of builder’s work, I profess to distinguish between conscientious, well finished, straight forward labor, and work done in a slovenly style – and the former is the case with the church. As far as it is finished the work is solid, and, what is more, the acoustic properties promise to be good. To sum up, the work, when finished, will be, and ought to be, a credit to so small a place as Porangahau.”\n\nHawke’s Bay Herald, Vol XXI, Issue 5906, 15th February 1881, page 3.\n\n“CONSECRATION OF PORANGHAU CHURCH.\n\nOn Friday last the new church at Porangahau was consecrated by the Right Rev. the Bishop of Waiapu. The design of the building is striking. It consists of a nave, chancel, tower with spire, and a commodious vestry. It is seated for 100 persons, but there is space for additional seating accommodation when required. One great feature, internally is a large stained-glass east window, containing three lights and tracery. The subjects are the baptism of our Lord, the Crucifixion, and the Resurection. The draperies about the figures are of the richest quality of antique glass the colors being so arranged as to blend harmoniously, while all crude or harsh coloring is avoided. The background is light grisailler work, so subdued as to make the subjects stand out prominently. On the lower panels, and in the tracery are suitable emblems and monograms. The general effect is exceedingly rich and handsome. Beneath it is a brass plate bearing the following inscription:- “This window is erected by the family, in memory of Davis Canning, gent., who fell in action at Ruatikuri, 8th August, 1868 whilst leading the advanced guard,” The window is from the firm of Ferguson and Urie, Melbourne. The services on Friday were three in number, those in the morning and evening being attended by the European settlers, that in the afternoon by the Porangahau natives. The Bishop preached in the morning, and the Rev. De Berdt Hovel in the evening. The Revs’ S. Williams, J. Shearman, and F.E.T. Simcox (the incumbent of the parish) were also present and took part in the ceremonies. The offertories amounted to £31. The church, which is dedicated to St. Michael, was designed by Mr B. W. Mountfort, of Christchurch, the contractor for the work being Mr Robert Holt, and the builder Mr W. Smith, of this town. The building reflects great credit on all concerned in its arection, [sic] and is by far the prettiest ecclesiastical edifice to be seen in the country districts of Hawke’s Bay. The furniture is exceedingly good of its kind, the silver fount [sic]having been given by Mr. J. Nairn, of Pourerere, and the embroidered chancel mat by Mr C. A. M. Hirtzel. The site upon which the church stands was presented by Mrs T. Crosse, of Mangamari.”\n\nDominion, NZ, Vol 4, Issue 1031, 21st January 1911, page 16.\n\n“Oakburne,” the residence of Mr. Davis Canning, is one of the prettiest homesteads on the road between Waipukurau and Porangahau. It lies a few miles past Wallingford, and on an eminence which admits of a splendid view of the surrounding country. At the back of the residence is a fine plantation of pine trees, while farther down is a big orchard of six hundred trees, some of which are over forty years old. The name of Canning is inseparably linked with the agricultural and pastoral history of Hawke’s Bay. Mr. John Davis Canning, father of Mr. Davis Canning, was one of the early stock-breeders in the district when there were few such, and it is he who gave a lead in the system of using nothing but the best stock. He was one of the exhibitors at the first agricultural and pastoral show held at Havelock North, and he specialised not only on Short-horn cattle and sheep, but also in horses, pigs, sporting dogs, and fowls. A man of very broad and enlightened views, and with an earnest sympathy, which endeared him to all who had the good fortune of his acquaintance, John Davis Canning is described by contemporaries as one of the finest types of the pioneer settlers who built their homes out in the wilderness. In his early days he was a colleague of the late John Harding, of Mount Vernon, and was employed by that equally strenuous pioneer some time in the fifties. Mr. Canning came to New Zealand in 1851, in the good ship Cornwall, and he took up “Oakburne,” about half a century ago, and held big Native leasehold sections, which aggregated 40,000 acres. He was married in 1868 to a daughter of Mr. McQueen, of Inverness. A bereavement clouded the happy memories of his first years of married life at “Oakburne,” It was in 1867 or 1868 and the Maori troubles were blazing in their insurrectionary outbursts. Davis Canning, who resided at “Oakburne” with his brother, was a young man full of adventure. He was smitten with the fever, and one evening rode away with a captain’s commission, through to Napier and on to Poverty Bay, where he was shot dead with Captain Carr at Ruakaturi. It appears that both he and Captain Carr were the victims of their own rashness, and in these days of militarism and threatened war it is interesting to record in what a simple manner two lives were thrown away.\n\nMr. John Davis Canning.\n\nIt is interesting to record some further particulars of Mr. John Davis Canning. He was born at “Ogbourne,” St Andrew, Marlborough, Wiltshire, England, in the year 1822, and was the son of the late M. Davis Canning. The Cannings of “Ogbourne” and of “Oakbourne,” in Hawke’s Bay, are a branch of an old English family of which Lord Canning, a former Viceroy of India, was a member. Mr. John Davis Canning was educated in his native place. He landed first at Lyttelton, and then came up to Hawke’s Bay, where he afterwards selected the present fine property. He introduced the Cotswold variety of sheep, and spent lavish sums of money on good stock. Amongst his horse importations was the draught stallion Dugdale, said to be the finest of his class. In 1883 Mr. Canning went to England to see his wife, who had been invalided there, but the trip resulted in his death. It is satisfactory to record in the face of this severe bereavement that Mrs. Canning regained her health some eight years later, that she returned to New Zealand, and that she now resides in Napier, in very good health.\n\nMr. Davis Canning.\n\nMr. Davis Canning, the present owner of “Oakburne,” was borne there, but was educated at the Marlborough Grammar School and at Clifton College, where formerly, by the way, Mr. James Allan, M.P., received some of his first instruction. Mr. Canning went to Clifton College in 1885, and left in 1891. He was an enthusiastic out-door sportsman, and got his cap both for football and cricket, and still takes a keen interest in those pastimes. After leaving England he resided for a time at Hastings, “Oakburne” having been leased, but when the lease expired he returned to his home, and took up the study of farming and agricultural matters with the same keen interest which was evidenced in such a marked degree by his father…”\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nMy thanks to:\n\nMy cousins Janice and Cleeve Ball for following up on the clues in New Zealand and undertaking the long trip to Porangahau to meet the Canning descendants and photograph the window.\n\nTo Davis Canning for the email correspondence and additional clues on the Canning family history in the Hawke’s Bay New Zealand.\n\nTo Duncan & Mandy Ball in England for the correspondence and photos from Ogbourne, St Andrew’s, Wiltshire.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[1] Hawke’s Bay Herald, Vol XXI, Issue 5133, Monday 22nd July 1878, page 2.\n\n[2] Hawkes Bay Herald, Vol XXI, Issue 5792, 13th September 1880, page 3.\n\n[3] Hawke’s Bay Herald, Vol XXI, Issue 5906, 15th February 1881, page 3.\n\n[4] Hawke’s Bay Today, NZ, On-line edition, Saturday 24th December 2011.\n\n[5] Lyttelton Times, NZ, Vol 1, Issue 49, 13th December 1851, page 5.\n\n[6] Hawke’s Bay Herald, NZ, 27th Jul 1863, page 1.\n\n[7] Hawke’s Bay Herald, NZ, Vol 7, Issue 494, 28th May 1864, page 4.\n\n[8] Nelson Evening Mail, Volume III, Issue 27, 1 Feb 1868, page 2.\n\n[9] Evening Post, NZ, Vol IV, Issue 175, 5th September 1868, page 2.\n\n[10] Daily Telegraph, Issue 3009, 16th February 1881, page 3.\n\n[11] Hawke’s Bay Herald, Vol XXI, Issue 5933, 29th March 1881, page 1.\n\n[12] Daily Telegraph, Issue 3219, 24th October 1881, page 2.\n\n[13] Daily Telegraph, Issue 3804, 20th September 1883, page 2.\n\n[14] Hawke’s Bay Herald, Vol XXI, Issue 6662, 25th September 1883, page 2.\n\n[15] Matatoa: Fathers & Sons, Hilary Pederson, Te Hanganui Partnership 2011.\n\n[16] Dominion, NZ, Vol 4, Issue 1031, 21st January 1911, page 16.\n\n[17] NZ BDM record 1920/5550.\n\n[18] Date of birth 11th July 1829: From Canning family bible.

The windows depict the Old Testament characters Moses and St James Major and has the memorial text at the base:\n\n“TO THE GLORY OF GOD AND IN MEMORY OF JAMES GOODALL FRANCIS DIED 1884”\n\nThe Church of England Messenger and Ecclesiastical Gazette for the Diocese of Melbourne and Ballarat, Vic, Thursday 5th February 1885, page 3.\n\n“THE pretty little church of St. Mary’s, Sunbury, has recently been enriched by a memorial window, and a brass eagle, to the memory of the late Hon. J. G. Francis. The window is the gift of the parishioners, and is the work of Messrs. Ferguson and Urie, and has been pronounced by competent judges to be a most creditable specimen of the stainer’s art. It is composed of two lights, each containing three-quarter figures of Moses and St. James Major. Mr. Francis’ Christian name suggested the latter, and that of Moses is obviously significant of the upright and fearless politician. The lectern is from the celebrated firm of Jones and Willis, and is of solid brass. The modelling of the eagle is extremely natural. The pedestal bears the inscription – “To the glory of God, and in memory of James Goodall Francis, who died 23rd January, 1884. Presented to St. Mary’s Church by his widow.” It is simple and handsome, and has been greatly admired by the many visitors to Sunbury during the Christmas season. A correspondent writes to us- “our departed friend is missed more and more. His ready counsel, his large heart, and open purse made him both useful and popular. He was always accessible to “all sorts and conditions of men.” He was most regular in his attendance at divine service. He gave the local clergyman a generous and unfailing support. In the parish and in the vestry he was to the fore in every good work.\n\n…take him for all in all,\n\n(We) shall not look upon his like again.”\n\nPhotos taken 6th February 2011.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n[View all images]\n\nJames Goodall Francis (1835-1884)\n\nJames Goodall Francis was born in London in 1819 and emigrated to Van Diemen’s Land (Tasmania) at age 15 circa 1835. He became a partner in a Campbell Town store and later joined the mercantile firm of Boys & Pointer in Hobart which he later brought and continued in partnership with Duncan Macpherson.\n\nIn 1847 he suffered an extensive head injury at the hands of a burglar named Peter Kenny[1] who was convicted and hung[2] for the offence in the same year. The injury caused Francis to suffer intermittently for the rest of his life. Three years after the hanging of Kenny it was found that he was wrongly convicted and executed after another man had confessed to the crime on his death bed[3].\n\nIn 1853 Francis moved to Melbourne and in 1855 was elected a director of the Bank of New South Wales. In 1856 he was elected as vice-president of the Chamber of Commerce and president in 1857. He also maintained financial interests in the Australian Sugar Company and Tasmanian Insurance Company.\n\nIn 1859 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly and continued an extensive political and business career. On three occasions he was considered for a Knighthood but consistently declined the honour[4].\n\nHis private interests as a vintner allowed him to establish a vineyard at Sunbury in 1863 where he no doubt became close friends with Sir William Clarke of “Rupertswood”.\n\nIn 1872 he was elected the 9th Premier of Victoria and held that position until 1874 when ill health, attributed to his assault in 1847, forced his retirement[5].\n\nJames Goodall Francis died at his home “Warringa” at Queenscliff on the 25th of January 1884 aged 65[6] and was buried in the Melbourne General Cemetery. He was survived by his wife Mary Grant (nee Ogilvie 1824-1887)[7] and fifteen children and he left a sizeable estate valued at over £178,000[8].\n\nHis significant pink granite memorial at the Melbourne General reads:\n\n“Sacred to the Memory of James Goodall Francis born 9th January 1819, died 25th January 1884.\n\nAlso his wife, Mary Grant Francis born 6th June 1824, died 18th May 1887.\n\nWhat doth the Lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God? Micah 6:8″\n\nThe memorial stained glass window was erected in the liturgical west wall above the entrance to St Mary’s Anglican Church at Sunbury. The same church also has another Ferguson & Urie stained glass erected as the principal east window behind the chancel to the memory of Sir William Clarke’s daughter Agnes Petrea Josephine Clarke who died as an infant in early 1879.\n\nColonial Times, Hobart, TAS, Friday 5th March 1847, page 3.\n\n“Peter Kenny was capitally charged with a burglary in the house of Mr. James Goodall Francis, on the night of the 11th Feb., and with cutting and wounding Mr. Francis on the left side of the head…”\n\nLaunceston Examiner, TAS, Wednesday 24th March 1847, page 4.\n\nHOBART TOWN.- Peter Kenny, convicted of the burglary and desperate attempt at murder in the house of Mr. James Goodall Francis, in this city, and William Bennett, convicted of Murdering a fellow prisoner at Port Arthur, have suffered the extreme penalty of the law…”\n\nThe Cornwall Chronicle, Launceston, TAS, Monday 26th June 1876, page 2.\n\n“… We well recollect one poor fellow of the name of Peter Kenny, who was hung in 1847, on the evidence of the now Hon.

G. FRANCIS\n\nIt is our painful duty to announce the death of the Hon. J. G. Francis, M.L.A., which occurred yesterday at Queenscliff, at half past 6 o’clock p.m. The event was not unexpected. Mr. Francis had been gradually failing for weeks, if not months past. He had a very trying illness in March and April. His physical sufferings passed away with the surgical operations he had then to undergo, but his system, which had been strained more than once by illness, received a shock which deprived him of much of his former mental power, and nearly all his physical activity. His wife and family were henceforth always with him, and their presence could rarely be dispensed with. About six weeks ago, by the advice of Mr. Fitzgerald, one of his regular medical attendants, Mr. Francis removed from East Melbourne to Queenscliff. His case, before then, was known by Mr. Fitzgerald to be hopeless, but it was not considered necessary to acquaint the family with the fact. On Wednesday, Mr Fitzgerald was summoned to Queenscliff. He found Mr. Francis paralysed all down the left side, and insensible, Mr. Fitzgerald, before returning to town on Thursday, told Mrs. Francis that all would be over in a few hours, but his patient lingered until the third day. The news of Mr. Francis’s death reached Melbourne between 7 and 8 o’clock yesterday evening. Its immediate cause was the paralytic seizure and disease of the vessels of the brain, as well as nervous prostration from previous overwork. Mr Francis suffered for years from abscesses and other internal complaints. These ailments were cured each time they appeared, but their tendency was to leave the nervous system weaker than before. Arrangements have been made for conveying the body of the deceased gentleman to Melbourne by special train this evening. It is the wish of the family that the funeral, the time for which has not been fixed, should be strictly private…”\n\nThe Argus, Melbourne, Vic, Monday 28th January 1884, page 5.\n\n“The remains of the late Mr. James Goodall Francis were brought from Queenscliff to Melbourne by special train on Saturday evening, and afterwards conveyed to Albert-street, East Melbourne, where the deceased for many years resided. Yesterday afternoon the funeral took place, and, in accordance with the wishes of the family, it was made as private as possible. Had a public ceremony been consented to, the remains of the late statesman would have been followed to the grave by thousands of his fellow citizens. It was, no doubt, more agreeable to the family and the mourning friends of the deceased that there should be an absence of display and popular feeling. Although no public notice was given, a considerable number of gentlemen attended the funeral, and Albert-street, in the neighbourhood of the house, was crowded with spectators. A body of mounted and foot police, under the command of Inspector Pewtreas, took charge of the approaches to the house and regulated the street traffic. They were sent by the authorities more as a mark of respect to the memory of Mr. Francis – a former Premier of Victoria – than for the purpose of preserving order, which was maintained almost without their help. The procession left Albert-street at about half-past 3 o’clock, and its line of march was along Victoria-street and Madeline-street to the cemetery gates. It was about a quarter of a mile in Length, and consisted mainly of private carriages. The burial service at the grave was conducted by the Rev. H. H. P. Handfield, of St. Peter’s Church, East Melbourne, assisted by the Rev. T. H. Goodwin, the cemetery chaplain. His Honour Mr. Justice Higinbotham; Sir William J. Clarke, M.L.C.; the Hon. James Stewart Johnston; the Hon Walter Madden, M.L.A.; the Hon David Moore, Mr. Herbert J. Henty, Mr. William H. Miller, of the Bank of Victoria, and Dr. Shields, were the gentlemen requested to act as pall-bearers. Amongst others present were the Hon. Duncan Gillies, Minister of Railways; the Hon. Alfred Deakin, Minister of Public Works; the Hon. Charles Young’ Sir Charles MacMahon, a former Speaker of the Legislative Assembly; the Hon. H. J. Wrixon; Mr. Zox, M.L.A; Mr. F. T. Derham, M.L.A.; Mr. Charles Smith, mayor of Melbourne and M.L.A. for Richmond (the first constituency represented by Mr. Francis in the Legislative Assembly); Mr. E. G. Fitzgibbon, town clerk; Dr. Youl, Mr. Alfred Wyatt, P.M.; Councillor Wilks, Mr. James England, and Mr. J. G. Burtt. The Premier, Mr. Service, who left for Sorrento on Friday, could not attend, but sent his carriage, which was occupied by Mr. Thomas, secretary to the Premier. Mr. Berry, the Chief Secretary, was also absent from town, having gone to Geelong, and Mr. Kerferd, the Attorney-General, was not sufficiently well to be present. The Bank of New South Wales, of which Mr. Francis was a director, and the Victorian Sugar Company, with which he was long connected, were both represented in the group of gentlemen who collected round the grave while the service for the dead was read. The body, enclosed in an oak coffin, covered with wreaths of flowers, was deposited in the family vault.\n\nWhen the funeral procession, following the remains of the late Mr. J. G. Francis, entered the general Cemetery yesterday, the paths were overrun by a miscellaneous crowd of persons – chiefly boys and girls – whose curiosity to see what was about to be done caused pain and annoyance to gentlemen who, in mournful silence, were endeavouring to pay due respect to the memory of the dead. The line of march was broken at almost every step by the thoughtless intruders, who thrust themselves into front places, or pressed in from the edge of the path. On the hearse being stopped it was surrounded, and the staff of attendants provided by Mr. Daley, who conducted the funeral arrangements, were hampered by the uninvited crowd, whilst the pall-bearers would with difficulty get to their places. There was further crowding round the grave. What rendered the intrusion of strangers the more conspicuous was the fact most of the girls were dressed in glaring colours, in vexing contrast with the black costumes of the mourners. If the board of trustees who have the management of the cemetery, or some other body, could provide attendants, when necessary, to make it easy for the public to observe the ordinary rules of decorum, they would earn the gratitude of all who have occasion to follow friends or relatives to their last resting-place. The special body of police present yesterday had quite enough to do to control the traffic at the gates. Within the grounds there appeared to be no means of keeping line along the main walk.”\n\nRelated posts:\n\n1880: St Mary’s Anglican Church, Sunbury, Victoria. (The east triple light window to the memory of Agnes Petrea Josephine Clarke)\n\nFootnotes:\n\n-37.579492 144.728898\n\nIn late November 1872 a magnificent three-light stained-glass window was unveiled in St John’s Anglican Church at Raymond Terrace in New South Wales.\n\n“…It is due to the firm of Messrs Furgusson [sic], Urie, and Lyon, of Melbourne, to say that the window is regarded as a beautiful specimen of Australian art, which will favourably compare with works of a similar character executed in England…” [1].\n\nThe window was crafted by the North Melbourne stained-glass firm ‘Ferguson, Urie, and Lyon’ for £80 and was erected in the chancel in memory of the district pioneer and geologist William Keene.\n\nPhotos were taken October 2013 and have been kindly contributed by Michaela Sorensen. The historic photo of the chancel and window was taken by the Rector of St John’s, the Rev Norman Alfred Pullin (1913-1983), during his incumbency of St John’s circa 1949-52 [2].\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSt John’s Anglican Church is located at Raymond Terrace, 167km North of Sydney and 26km North of Newcastle in New South Wales.\n\nThe church was built on land formerly owned by the Cafferay[3] family and was constructed of locally quarried stone to the designs of architect Edmund Blacket for £1500. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Newcastle, William Tyrell, on Thursday the 25th September 1862[4] and the first incumbent was the Rev John Roe Blomfield.\n\nAfter the death of William Keene in 1872 it was resolved that a memorial stained-glass window should be erected to his memory in St John’s. One of the lead organisers of the creation of the window was Henry Bayes Cotton (1820-1906)[5], a well-known and respected manager of the National Bank of New South Wales at nearby Newcastle.\n\nThe craftsmanship of the window was entrusted to the Ferguson, Urie and Lyon[6] Stained-glass Company of North Melbourne in Victoria. The biblical theme represented in the window being, in the centre light, the Nativity, Crucifixion and the Resurrection. The flanking side lights had the inscription beneath each figure being, ‘Teach the Ignorant,’ and ‘Help the Helpless.’\n\nThe window was erected in the chancel of St John’s and was unveiled in late November 1872. The ‘Maitland Mercury’ of the 3rd December 1872 provided a detailed description of the historic window;\n\n“…Commencing at the foot of the light, there is the scene of our Saviour’s birth. In the centre of the light is represented the Crucifixion, and this is again surmounted by the Resurrection. These subjects are all taken from the old masters, and are beautifully executed. The intermediate spaces are occupied with chaste and varied medallions, and the sacred monograms, I.H.S. In the right side light there is an admirably designed and well finished group, representing a venerable teacher engaged in instructing those around him; the countenances of this group are peculiarly pleasing. In the left side light is likewise a corresponding group, consisting of a benevolent person, and a female figure of benign aspect, engaged in receiving orphan children…”\n\n“…The inscription at the base of the memorial is, “To the Glory of God, and in memory of William Keene, 1872”[7]\n\nJust over a century later the chancel of St John’s had to be demolished and the window, now more than a century old, was considered to be in a fragile condition and was subsequently removed and stored in the rectory of St John’s. The repairs to the sanctuary and extensions to the chapel and vestry were completed in 1975 [8] and, later, at the instigation of William Keene’s great granddaughter, Annette Keene Holloway, funds were raised from family members and parishioners of St John’s to repair and re-erect the windows. Because there was no longer a position in the chancel for the windows to be re-erected in their original configuration, they were refashioned into five single lights and re-installed along the south wall of the nave.\n\n“A stained glass window depicting the nativity, Life and Crucifiction [sic] was erected in St. John’s Church in memory of Great Grandfather William Keene. Later I heard it had been removed and the opening cemented up. I wrote to the Rev. Sores and he replied that the window had been in bad repair and in danger of being broken. Raymond Terrace was a poor parish without the money to restore the damage so the windows were stored in the Rectory. I wrote to my cousins who sent money. Other parishioners did too and the windows were re-installed on the side wall of the church where they can still be admired as a link with early colonial days.”[9]\n\nMr Don Denham, Parish Secretary of St Johns, Raymond Terrace, provides further insight as to the time line of the historical windows:\n\n“In the late 1960’s the original sanctuary/ chancel of the church was demolished and in the 1970’s a new sanctuary/ chancel and side chapel were constructed of modern design. In the new construction there was no east window to house the windows and so they were placed in the five small lancet windows of the southern side of the nave”.\n\n“… the complete east window fitted perfectly into the nave windows and the completed affect is quite pleasing…”\n\n“…The windows have been recently restored and we are planning the rededication service for 20 October this year”.[10]\n\nThe most recent conservation work on the windows was carried out in 2011 by Ron Jensen, of Heritage Stained Glass at New Lambton in New South Wales. Only two of the five windows required attention, being the one at the south west corner titled “Teach the ignorant” and the centre window of the five titled “Death” which depicts the Crucifixion.\n\nThe five individual windows, from left to right along the south wall are;\n\n“Help the Helpless”, “Birth” (Nativity), “Death” (Crucifixion), “Resurrection” and “Teach the Ignorant.”\n\nEach of the reconstructed windows retains the original 1872 Ferguson & Urie figurative stained glass work depicting the five biblical scenes. Each scene has two of the original decorative quatrefoils below it. These quatrefoils are of varying colours with gothic floral designs of yellow and white flowers in the centre, surrounded by a stylized depiction of the passion flower with the stamen in each of the four lobes.\n\nThe background quarries of glass surrounding the figurative scenes and quatrefoils are no-longer original and are now of varying sized rectangular and diamond shapes in soft pastel colours. The monogram described as containing the letters “I.H.S” originally appeared between the nativity and Crucifixion scenes in the centre light of the window but this no longer exists. The memorial inscription at the base of the window now has the year ‘1872’ in the far left light which in its original configuration appeared immediately after William Keene’s name (“To the Glory of God, and in memory of William Keene, 1872”).\n\nThere are many cases of our historic stained-glass artefacts that no longer exist after more than a century and a half. Some of the historic churches have met their demise by fire, demolition, or have been sold to private enterprise over the last 150 years and in many cases their original artefacts and stained-glass windows have been lost. St John’s church at Raymond Terrace represents a rare example of the dedication of the parishioners and Keene family descendants to save the historic windows so they still have a reminder of their pioneer heritage.\n\nIn September 2012 St John’s celebrated its 150 year anniversary and the re-dedication of the Keene memorial stained-glass windows will occur at St John’s on the 20th October 2013.\n\nWilliam Keene (1798 – 1872)\n\nWilliam Keene was born at Bath, in Somersetshire, England, c.1798. His English ancestry associates him with ‘The Bath Journal’ of London, founded in 1742. The tabloid was later known as ‘Keene’s Bath Journal’ circa 1822 which remained in the Keene family until c.1916 before being absorbed by the ‘Bath Herald’.\n\nWilliam Keene initially trained in the medical profession but his interests in geology were his passion and he changed his career to become a geologist and mining and civil engineer. Circa 1822 he left for France where he gained a prestigious appointment with the French government;\n\n“…in connection with some salt mines in the Pyrenees. His services, highly esteemed by that government, brought him an order and a pecuniary grant…“[11]\n\nKeene later became a ‘Fellow of the Geological Society’ in London[12] which entitled him to the prestigious post nominal of ‘F.G.S’. On the 13th August 1822 William was married to Sarah Charles Evans (1804-1867) at the British Embassy Chapel in Paris[13] by the Chaplain Edward Forster. The Keene’s had a long association with France where many of their children were born. During their time in France William gained a passion for the French style of wine making which would become an interest for the rest of his life. At the beginning of the French Revolution in 1848 they returned to England[14].\n\nCirca 1852 William migrated to Australia with his family and on the 12th December 1854 he was appointed as Government Examiner of Coal Fields in New South Wales[15] and in 1856 promoted to Government Geologist[16]. His geological interests allowed him to amass a significant collection of mineral specimens and fossils which he displayed in 1858[17] and in August 1859 the collection was on public display at the military barracks in Newcastle[18].\n\nIn 1861 William Keene’s extraordinary collection of geological specimens was singled out for particular attention at the Sydney Industrial and Art Exhibition;\n\n“To the collection of Mr. W. Keene, Government examiner of coal fields and mines, it is desirable to invite particular attention. It is on the north side of the upper gallery, and consists of some valuable specimens from our gold, copper, lead, iron, and coal fields, and some remarkable fossils, the whole having been collected by himself, and chiefly in the counties of Hunter and Argyle…”[19]\n\nOver a twenty year period William Keene wrote several papers on the subject of fossils and authored a significant number of Government reports on Colonial mineral wealth and mining.\n\nWilliam Keene was a staunch supporter of the Church of England and in his position as the first acting Registrar of St John’s he read the petition for the consecration of the church, which he had the honour to perform shortly after 11am on Thursday the 25th September 1862[20].\n\nWilliam Keene was a member of the Newcastle Church Diocese, Local School Board, and Founder and Treasurer of the Clergy Widows and Orphan’s Fund[21]. He was elected President of the Newcastle School of Arts in 1869[22] and he laid the foundation stone of that school on the 8th April 1870[23].\n\nAside from his geological interests he was renowned in the Hunter River area as a viticulturist and vintner, who passionately advocated the French style of vine-growing in the district. He was also an active member of the Hunter River Vineyard Association, of which he was president in 1865-66[24], and also a member of the Agricultural Association[25]. His experience in this field often saw him called upon to act as a wine-judge at the regional exhibitions[26].\n\nWilliam Keene died at his home, ‘Kingsmead House’, in Raymond Terrace on the 2nd February 1872[27] and was buried in the Raymond Terrace Cemetery. His wife Sarah predeceased him on the 2nd of July 1867[28].\n\nHenry Bayes Cotton (1820-1906)\n\nHenry Bayes Cotton is recognised as one of the principal promoters in having the Keen memorial window erected in St John’s in 1872.\n\n“…It cannot fail to give great pleasure to H. B. Cotton, Esq., of Newcastle, who has taken a large amount of trouble and interest in accomplishing the work; and the friends of the deceased must be greatly gratified and comforted when they gaze upon this tribute of respect and affection to their departed relative…”[29]\n\nHenry Bayes Cotton arrived in the Colony circa 1839 and was appointed as the first manager of the Bank of New South Wales at Geelong circa 1854 and in 1863-64, appointed as first manager of the Newcastle branch[30] in New South Wales where he remained until his retirement in early 1888.[31] Although retired he maintained an interest in financial affairs and in 1893 he was appointed a director of the New South Wales ‘de Piété Deposit and Investment Company.’[32]\n\nLike William Keene, he was a staunch supporter of the Church of England and was also for many years a lay reader and active member of the Synod[33].\n\nThe association or friendship between Keene and Cotton is not specifically known but it is reasonable to assume that they knew each other well as Cotton was also involved in the establishment of the Newcastle School of Arts[34] with William Keene, who had laid the foundation stone of that school in 1862 and both were parishioners of St John’s at Raymond Terrace with Cotton actively involved in the choir of St. John’s.\n\nHenry Bayes Cotton left Newcastle and retired to the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill where he died aged 86 at his residence ‘Fig Tree’ on the 15th January 1906[35]. His wife Rachel predeceased him, 18th April 1903, aged 78[36].\n\nThe Maitland Mercury & Hunter River Advertiser, NSW, Tuesday 3rd December 1872, page 3.\n\n“MEMORIAL STAINED GLASS WINDOW IN ST. JOHN’S CHURCH, RAYMOND TERRACE, TO THE LATE WILLIAM KEENE, ESQ.- This window was placed in St. John’s Church, Raymond Terrace, Raymond Terrace, last week, and as it is the admiration of all who have viewed it, a short description may be interesting to your readers, whilst it is due to those kind friends who contributed towards the window. It may be as well to state in the first place, that the Church of St. John is a Gothic edifice, pleasantly situated on a spot which affords a view of the Hunter River and of the rich alluvial farms spreading for miles on the opposite side; the churchyard is neatly kept, having been tastefully laid out and planted with choice evergreen trees about six years ago. The east window of the church consists of three lancet lights; the central light is eleven feet high, being admirably adapted for the style and subjects which have been chosen. Commencing at the foot of the light, there is the scene of our Saviour’s birth. In the centre of the light is represented the Crucifixion, and this is again surmounted by the Resurrection. These subjects are all taken from the old masters, and are beautifully executed. The intermediate spaces are occupied with chaste and varied medallions, and the sacred monograms, I.H.S. In the right side light there is an admirably designed and well finished group, representing a venerable teacher engaged in instructing those around him; the countenances of this group are peculiarly pleasing. In the left side light is likewise a corresponding group, consisting of a benevolent person, and a female figure of benign aspect, engaged in receiving orphan children. It is scarcely necessary to say that these subjects are intended to perpetuate the memory of the offices which the deceased gentleman so long and faithfully filled in the Church of the Diocese, as a member of the Local School Board, and Founder and Treasurer of the Clergy Widows’ and Orphans’ Fund. The inscription under these subjects respectively is, ‘Teach the Ignorant,’ ‘Help the Helpless.’ The window adds much to the beauty of the chancel and the church generally. It cannot fail to give great pleasure to H. B. Cotton, Esq., of Newcastle, who has taken a large amount of trouble and interest in accomplishing the work; and the friends of the deceased must be greatly gratified and comforted when they gaze upon this tribute of respect and affection to their departed relative. It is due to the firm of Messrs Furgusson [sic], Urie, and Lyon, of Melbourne, to say that the window is regarded as a beautiful specimen of Australian art, which will favourably compare with works of a similar character executed in England. The cost of the window, with transmission and erection, has been £80. The inscription at the base of the memorial is, “To the Glory of God, and in memory of William Keene, 1872,” –Newcastle Pilot, Nov. 30.”\n\nA comprehensive eleven page document of all the significant historical newspaper transcriptions can be viewed here Raymond_Terrace_St John’s_Transcriptions This document is well worth reading as it gives a more in depth perspective to the history and has much more detail than I have attempted to sumarise in the above article.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nThanks to Don Denham, Jock Keene and Carolyn Wulff, for their much appreciated correspondence and contributions to this article and to Michaela Sorensen for the current photos of the stained glass windows.\n\nFoot notes:\n\n[2] Historic photograph contributed with thanks to Rev Pullin’s daughter, Carolyn Wulff (email 28th Sept 2013)\n\n[6] Stained Glass artist John Lamb Lyon (1835-1916) was and employee of the firm from 1862 and a partner from 1866 to 1873.\n\n[8] newcastleanglican.org, Mission Statement, St John’s, Raymond Terrace, parish profile, page 3.

The window depicts the Nativity, Crucifixion and Resurrection and was erected in the later half of October 1869.\n\nPhotos taken between: 19th Sept 2010 and 28th Sept 2013.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n[View larger images]\n\nConstruction of the first Anglican Church in Ballarat, known as Christ Church, commenced in 1854 in Lydiard Street, a year before Ballarat was proclaimed a Municipality and in the same year as the infamous Eureka Rebellion. The first stage of the church was completed by contractors Backhouse[1] and Reynolds in 1857 at a cost of more than £2000.[2]\n\nIn a mere ten years the congregation had outgrown the church and the plans were to enlarge it by the addition of transepts. On the 20th August 1867 the building committee of Christ Church accepted the tender of Mr Jonathon Coulson for the construction of the north and south transepts for £1655 to the plans prepared by architect Edward James.[3] The construction of these extensions began a month later.[4]\n\nAs part of the extensions and the beautification of the church was the idea of placing a locally made stained glass window in the chancel and on the 19th October 1867 it was reported;\n\n“We are informed that the stained window for the chancel at Christ Church is to be the gift of Mr. E. A. Wynne[5]. Messrs Urie and Ferguson, of Melbourne, will most likely supply the glass. The subject for the window has not yet, however, been determined on.”[6]\n\nEdward Agar Wynne (1823-1898).\n\nEdward Agar Wynne, was a mining pioneer in the Ballarat region. He was Chairman of Directors of the Scottish and Cornish Gold Mining Company[7], a founder and director of the Ballarat Gas Company (established in 1858), and one of the first shareholders in the Black Hill mine, of which he still held 1200 shares in at the time of his death[8]. He took a leading role in the laying out of Ballarat’s botanic gardens as well as being a member of the Acclimatisation Society[9].\n\nHe married Sarah Maria Palmer in London in c.1849 and migrated to Australia with his family c.1851-54.\n\nIn the mid 1870’s he had decided to leave Ballarat and move to the Melbourne suburb of Balaclava and his substantial home on the shores of Lake Wendouree was subsequently purchased by the ‘Loreto Sisters’ for use as part of their newly formed Convent in 1875[10].\n\nHis wife Sarah died on the 15th February 1882 at their home ‘View Hill,’ Balaclava[11], and in 1884, at the age of 60, he married 26 year old Rebecca Israel Samuel[12].\n\nEdward died at his home ‘Montacute,’ Grey Street St Kilda, on the 9th December 1898 aged 75[13]. He was buried at the St Kilda Cemetery with his first wife Sarah and two of their children[14]. One of his sons from his first marriage, Agar Wynne (1850-1934), became a prominent Victorian politician.\n\nEdward would not end up being the benefactor of the window and the enthusiasm for its creation lost momentum. It would be a further two years before the window would actually be created and more than a year after the 1867-68 extensions of Christ Church were completed.\n\nBy April 1868 the extensions to Christ Church were nearing completion and the local tabloid, ‘The Ballarat Star’ reported;\n\n“The alterations at Christ Church are now nearly finished. Both transepts have been erected, and the northern one has been occupied already. The south one requires some completing touches, and the chancel is also unfinished, the window not yet being glazed. We believe the organ is to be erected in the southern transept. It seems a pity the chancel could not have been deepened and widened, so as to have made it serve as for a cathedral choir, and thus have provided room there for the singers, instead of taking space for the choir out of the too small area of the church, even with its transepts added.” [15]\n\nThe 6th of May 1868 heralded the re-opening of Christ Church and a series of celebrations were organised for the dedication of the new transepts and chancel. The services were conducted by Archdeacon Stretch[16] at the morning services and the Rev Handfield [17] at the afternoon services. The decorations in the church at this point indicate"
