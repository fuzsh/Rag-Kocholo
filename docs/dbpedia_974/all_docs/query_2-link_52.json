        "text": "Michigan had 19 historic sites added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2023\n\nNearly 2,000 sites in the state have been included on the list since 1966\n\nThe State Historic Preservation Office will work to preserve those sites\n\nA book store, a park and even a furniture building are among 19 places in Michigan newly listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2023.\n\nThe Michigan Economic Development Corp. shared this week the sites that made the National Register of Historic Places, an official list of places, buildings, and even objects in the U.S. recognized by their historical significance and considered worthy of preservation.\n\nIn Michigan, the State Historic Preservation Office partners with developers and property owners to protect historical and archaeological sites.\n\n“These 19 historic properties listed in 2023 help to tell a more complete history at the local, state, and national levels,” said Ryan Schumaker, state historic preservation officer in a press statement. “Listing in the National Register not only provides a way to celebrate this important history, it also provides opportunities for economic investment in these properties and communities.”\n\nThe 19 historical sites added in 2023 include:\n\nCity Property AlpenaHerman and Hattie Besser HouseBenton HarborEden Springs ParkBuchananClark Equipment Company ComplexDetroitFrances Harper InnDetroitSamuel D.

The property should also be able to convey its historical significance."
