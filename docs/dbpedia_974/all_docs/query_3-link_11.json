Having been to the West and the East of England they are now venturing to the heights of the North, singing at three Evensongs at Ripon Cathedral, another Evensong at Selby Abbey and at a very special unique service of Compline within the beautiful ruins of Fountains Abbey.\n\nSpiritual Life\n\nSt James’s is a place to explore, reflect, pray, and support all who are in need. We are a Church of England parish in the Anglican Communion. This is a place for everyone who’s wondering about life’s big questions and striving for a better world.\n\nEarth & social justice\n\nWe try to put our faith into action by educating ourselves and speaking out on issues of injustice, especially concerning refugees, asylum, earth and racial justice, and LGBTQ+ issues."
