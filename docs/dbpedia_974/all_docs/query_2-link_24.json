The form collects information regarding the brief history of the building, known changes to the building, and exterior and interior photographs of the resource.\n\nHistoric Resource Record (HRR) Form\n\nIf after review of the HRR the SHPO staff believes the property may be eligible for the National Register, the second step is to conduct additional historical research on a property.\n\nHelpful Resources for Research\n\nNPS Bulletin 29: Researching a Historic Property\n\nResearching Your Historic Property, City of Portland\n\nThe Oregon Encyclopedia\n\nHow to Research your House's History, National Trust for Historic Preservation Blog\n\nConsult with your local public library and local historical society!\n\nPrepare the National Register Nomination\n\nAfter submitting a HRR and additional research, it is time to prepare a National Register nomination.\n\nA National Register nomination is a federal document with specific technical requirements. SHPO staff can assist preparers as needed with nomination forms, but SHPO staff does not complete nominations for preparers.\n\nSteps to begin:\n\nPhotograph the property\n\nFor more information on photograph standards see the National Register Photo Policy.\n\nComplete the Nomination form\n\nSee Preparing a National Register Nomination in Oregon for detailed information on this.\n\nSubmit a complete nomination\n\nSee the next section on \"Nomination Submission Deadlines & Process\" for the next steps.\n\n​Deadlines For Submission\n\nEvery National Register nomination is reviewed by the State Advisory Committee on Historic Preservation (SACHP). The SACHP meets 3 times a year. To be considered at one of their hearings, a complete nomination must be submitted by one of the following draft deadlines.\n\nDraft Deadlines for consideration at the SACHP MeetingSACHP Meeting MonthsMarch 1stJune July 1stOctoberNovember 1stFebruary\n\nPlease email complete nominations along with copies of the digital photographs to ORSHPO.NationalRegisterProgram@oprd.oregon.gov by one of these draft deadlines.

If in need of an alternative submission format, please email that request to the address above.\n\nNomination Process\n\nSee the National Register Process in Oregon flow chart for a brief overview of the process in listing a property to the National Register.\n\n​To see if a property in Oregon is in the National Register of Historic Places, visit the Historic Sites Database.\n\nProperties can also be locally designated and might be subject to local restrictions. Be sure to check your local government for local landmark designations that may exist. A good place to start is with your local planning office."
