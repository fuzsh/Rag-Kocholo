Last entry for sightseeing is usually at 4pm with sightseeing ending 30 minutes after the last entry time. However, opening and closing times can change, so we recommend you visit our calendar to check the day you will be attending.\n\nIt's free to worship at the Cathedral, but sightseeing is ticketed. The cost of entry is £25 per adult and £10 per child, with discounts for families, groups and concessions. Some free tickets are also available. Visit our page on ticket types and prices for more information.\n\nThe Cathedral has a wealth of measures in place to ensure your safety, including 24/7 security camera coverage and regular patrols, trained security staff stationed across the site, thorough entry checks, and a close relationship with local police.\n\nBags above the maximum permitted dimensions of 45cm x 30cm x 25cm including handles, wheels and pockets cannot be brought into the Cathedral. There is no cloakroom facility so please do not bring larger items with you."
