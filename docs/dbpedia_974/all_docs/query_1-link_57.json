Holy Family will begin its inaugural season in the Atlantic East in spring 2025.\n\nWomen’s collegiate flag football showcases seven players on a football field that is 40 yards in width by 80 yards in length. Each team moves offensively by running or passing a football, while the defense tries to “tackle” by pulling flags on the belt of the ball carrier.\n\nThe sport will make its Olympic debut at Los Angeles 2028.\n\nAnne Prisco, president of Holy Family University, said, “Women’s flag football at HFU represents our commitment to expanding athletic opportunities for our students. This new sport not only enhances the diversity of our athletic programs but also strengthens our connection to the surrounding community. It fosters inclusivity and provides a platform for young women to excel both on and off the field. We are excited about the positive impact this will have on our students and the broader community.”\n\nThe Tigers will join Centenary, Immaculata, Marymount, Neumann and Eastern University.\n\n“I would like to thank Dr. Prisco and the Atlantic East for their efforts in helping bring women’s flag football to HFU,” said Athletic Director Tim Hamill. “Flag football is an emerging sport that will play an important role in the continued growth of women’s athletics, and I am proud our department will be a part of that progression.”"
