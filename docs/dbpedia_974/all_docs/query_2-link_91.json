        "text": "St. James Anglican Church (Dundas, Ont.) fonds. -- 1838-1968. -- 2.3 m of textual records.\n\nRev. William McMurray was appointed rector to both Dundas and Ancaster in 1838. Until 1843 the Dundas congregation worshipped in what was called \"The Free Church\". The congregation decided to erect its own building which opened on Hatt Street for services in December 1843. Dundas became a separate charge in 1895. During World War I, a munitions factory was built next to the church. The decision was taken to sell the church and move to a different location. The foundation stone of the new building on Melville Street was laid by the Bishop of Niagara in July 1925. This church was destroyed by fire in January 1978. A third church was built which opened for services in April 1980. For a more complete history see Centenary of St. James Anglican Church and Fountain Come Forth: The Anglican Church and the Valley Town of Dundas.\n\nFonds consists of parish registers containing statistical records, services, Vestry, Women's Auxiliary and Building Committee minutes and financial records. Several of the registers remain in the custody of the Rector at St. James and have not been microfilmed. The part of the fonds now housed at McMaster University has been microfilmed on 6 reels, numbered 1-4, 181-182."
