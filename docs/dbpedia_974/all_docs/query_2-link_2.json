The building is not only early, but generally recognized as one of the real architectural beauties in a category of small eighteenth century parish churches. St. James’ Church is a small, compact, rectangular one-story structure with stucco covered brick walls, and a slate jerkinhead roof. The round arched windows of the church are protected by exterior wooden shutters and framed by plaster architraves adorned with cherub’s heads. The corners of the building are marked by large quoins, and a small stucco cornice adorns the eaves line. The vestry was incorporated in 1778, and it is said that the presence of the royal coat of arms over the pulpit saved the church from destruction in 1779-1780 when British troops moved through South Carolina during the American Revolution. Services were discontinued during the latter part of the war, and the Church of England was disestablished. The revival of the Episcopal Church in South Carolina took place gradually from 1795-1817. Listed in the National Register April 15, 1970. Designated a National Historic Landmark April 15, 1970.\n\nPeriod of Significance:\n\n1708;1713 – 1719;18th century\n\nLevel of Significance:\n\nNational\n\nArea of Significance:\n\nArchitecture\n\nNational Register Determination:\n\nNational Historic Landmark\n\nDate of Certification:\n\nApril 15 1970\n\nRelated places\n\nGoose Creek\n\nBerkeley County"
