        "text": "BANKS RETIRES AS MINISTER OF BRUCEFIELD COMMUNITY UNITED CHURCH\n\nSTORY AND PHOTOS BY WILHELMINA LAURIE\n\nOn Saturday, July 27, Brucefield Community United Church was the setting for a retirement social for Rev. Randy Banks who had served many congregations across Canada and in Huron County during his forty-one years in ministry.\n\nBanks has served in Brucefield Community United for the past nine years, which included helping the congregation weather the ravages of COVID-19 and embracing technology and live-streaming services in order to bridge the gap and support the community. As the church has come out of the pandemic Banks’ positive support and pastoral care, as well as leadership in advising other struggling congregations, have been a boon to the religious communities around us.\n\nHe began his faith formation at his home church in Mount Vernon, ON, close to the town of Burford, beginning his first day of Sunday School there in 1960. His involvement in the church through his teen years helped him establish his call to the ministry.\n\nBanks studied at Emmanuel College, working first as a Student Intern for two years in Omineca Pastoral Charge, which included First Memorial United Church, Vanderhoof, Fort Fraser First United Church, and Fraser Lake, B. C.\n\nFrom October 1982 to June 1983, back in Ontario, Banks acted as a student supply minister at Cathcart United Church. He graduated from Emmanuel College in Mary 1983 and was ordained a minister in June of that year.\n\nHis first pastoral charge was for four years in Alberta in the fledgling Grande Cache United Church. The mining town was out in the middle of nowhere with parishioners with no roots or ties in the area who had come from many other places to work in the mines. His job was to unite this new congregation. One of the inspirational features of working in this area was the surrounding nature and the awe-inspiring mountains nearby. In 1987 Banks moved to MacGregor United Church in Manitoba where he stayed five years.\n\nAfter nine years in the West, it was time to come home to Ontario. He came to the Walton/Bluevale Pastoral Charge in 1992 and remained its minister until 1996. He still has contacts in the area from his time in ministry, and the sign from Duff’s Church with his name on it has pride of place at the Huron County Museum.\n\nIn 1996, and for four years thereafter, he assumed the posting at another joint charge which included Castleton United Church, and St. Andrew’s United Church in Grafton, located near Cobourg and Lake Erie. His next assignment from 2000 to 2002 was in the two-point Freelton/Strabane Pastoral Charge close to Flamborough. All of these were rural ministries.\n\nIn January 2003, Banks was called to serve at the little rural Grace United Church in Roseville, for one third of his time, and at the urban Olivet United Church in Kitchener, for two thirds of his time. These provided two rather different experiences, but over time, both churches found themselves in difficulty with declining and aging populations. He guided both churches at the same time through the process of closing their doors in 2015. Sadly, that same year, he also participated in the closing ceremonies of his former Duff’s Church in Walton.\n\nIn the meantime, he had been called to Brucefield Community United Church – a congregation still feeling its way two years after the amalgamation of Brucefield, Kippen, Varna and Goshen United churches. Banks and his wife Karen Mercurio moved into the manse on Nov. 1, 2015 and he has remained at this church for the past nine years.\n\nGuests from Brucefield as well as many of his previous congregations came from near and far to attend the Retirement Social held in his honor on Saturday, July 27. Special music for the reception was provided by “Pure Grace” “Tongue Drum” and “Cohesive” Harp groups. Piper Glenn McGregor piped the retiring minister as well as the attendees into the church for a program which included a skit by the Brucefield Players, music from the choir and a presentation of gifts. He was then piped back to the hall for the remainder of the reception. He performed his last Sunday service on Sunday, July 28 but was still visiting the elderly during his last few days. Banks worked steadfastly to the last day before retirement, performing a celebration of life on Wednesday.\n\nRandy Banks will be remembered for seeing the congregation of Brucefield Community United Church, as well as Londesborough and Auburn, through some difficult times. He will be remembered for his insights, for his dry and satirical wit, for his love of drama and for his incorporation of skits and plays into services. Christmas in July, live nativities, outdoor services and carol sings were also memorable events in the past few years. He was always ready to lend a helping hand with fundraisers, barbecues, dinners, and concerts. He supported church efforts to adopt Syrian newcomers to the area, and to feed the hungry through the Canadian Foodgrains Bank. His contributions to the spiritual life of the area and to the Brucefield Community United Church community will be missed."
