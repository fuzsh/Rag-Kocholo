It is the root of all our action in the world for ‘in quietness and confidence is our strength’ (Isaiah 30.15). We learn that it is not so much that we contemplate God but that God contemplates us and all creation with unimaginable love and grace.\n\nClick here for more resources about prayer, the Eucharist, and personal stories from our community of people’s diverse journeys of faith.\n\nAdventure\n\nThe spiritual life is rooted in the great adventure of love. It’s an open-hearted way of living, always willing to cross boundaries, break down barriers, forge creative relationships regardless of identity, background, experience or faith.\n\nAs Ruth said to Naomi, we say to Christ: ‘Where you go, I will go. Where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God’. (cf Ruth 1.16-17)\n\nClick here to find out more about ways to get involved in the life and activities of our church.\n\nKindness\n\nChrist repeated the ‘Golden Rule’ common to many religions that we are asked to ‘do to others as you would have them do to you’ (Matthew 7.12). Kindness is at the root of this way of life.\n\nHuman beings are often much more fragile, full of rage or regret, full of worry or doubt, than we let on.\n\nAnd so in a world where we can be anything on any given day, we want to try to be kind."
