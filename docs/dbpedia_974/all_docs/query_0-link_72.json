October 11–17, 2020 — George Washington Paused Here Greenwich, Connecticut“George Washington Slept Here” is an East Coast local history cliché—and not always accurate.

Regional Editor Michael Herrick of Southbury, Connecticut, filed this entry in 2010. October 4–10, 2020 — Battle of Lepanto Kotor, MontenegroThis battle occurred this week way back in 1571 and we have a marker for it.

Contributing Editor and global trekker Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California, filed this entry in 2018. September 27–October 3, 2020 — Chief Joseph’s Surrender Chinook, Montana“...

September 13–19, 2020 — Betty and Barney Hill Incident Lincoln, New HampshireUSA’s first offi­cially reported UFO alien abduction occurred right here on this rural road this week in 1961 and we have an official state historical marker to prove it.

Sinnott of Chelmsford, Massachusetts, filed this entry. September 6–12, 2020 — Death of Innocence Derry-Londonderry, Northern Ireland, United KingdomThis week in 1971 fourteen year old An­net­te McGavi­gan became the 100th civilian ca­su­alty of The Troubles, the violent ethnic conflict in Northern Ireland that raged for three decades near the end of the 20th century.

But its nativist spirit was rekindled a number of times over the years including as the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. Contributing Correspondent Karl Stelly of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, filed this entry in 2009. July 26–August 1, 2020 — First “REA” Substation in Carroll County Carrollton, GeorgiaElectric light was common­place in cities beginning in the 1880s.

June 21–27, 2020 — Stand Watie’s Surrender Fort Towson, OklahomaThe Civil War did not end when Lee sur­ren­de­red at Appomattox in April, or even when Jefferson Davis was captured in May.

June 14–20, 2020 — The Griffith Disaster, 1850 Willowick, OhioThis week in 1850 “the passengers were all in their berths when the alarm of fire was given, about three o’clock in the morning. The day had just begun to dawn, and the shore was in sight. At first very little alarm was felt on board, as the boat was rapidly approaching the shore, to which her head had been directed. But alas ! the prospect of speedy deliverance soon vanished, and every heart was chilled with terror when the steamer, while yet half a mile from land, struck on a sand-bar and became immovable.” June 7–13, 2020 — State Seal Stolen Guthrie, OklahomaIn order to complete the move of the capitol to Oklahoma City, the state seal had to be smuggled out of this courthouse this week in 1910.

May 24–30, 2020 — Jackson-Dickinson Duel Adairville, KentuckyDid you know that the 7th pre­si­dent of the United States fought a duel this week in 1806? He lived, Dickinson died.

This cutoff (shortcut) to the California Trail had been described by a guide-book writer who had never traveled it as “the most direct route” to California. Yet it was 125 miles longer and included no water for 80 miles across salt flats of the Great Salt Lake. The late Contributing Editor Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas, filed this entry in 2013. May 10–16, 2020 — Worth Bagley Stone Twentynine Palms, CaliforniaBagley's killer, after he was released from prison, repen­tant, erected a hand-carved stone marker that read “Here is where Worth Bagley bit the dust at the hand of W.

Contributing Editor Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California, filed this entry in 2019. May 3–9, 2020 — Bloomers Cut Auburn, CaliforniaThere are a lot of “eighth wonders of the world” out there and this particular one on the Central Pacific Rail­road’s portion of the first transcontinental railroad went into service this week in 1865.

This marker, way off the beaten path, was found and filed in 2016 by Contributing Correspondent James King of San Miguel, California. April 26–May 2, 2020 — The Rolling Stones in the Shoals in 1969 Florence, AlabamaTheir first world-wide number 1 album was released this week in 1971 and three of the album’s cuts were recorded here in 1969: “Brown Sugar,” “Wild Horses,” and “You got to Move.” Contributing Correspondent Sandra Hughes of Killen, Alabama, filed this entry in 2014.

Regional Editor Bernard Fisher of Mecha­nics­ville, Virginia, filed this entry in 2010.

There were no antibiotics to tackle secondary infections or hospital ventilators to help you breathe; no vaccine to prevent it. Gauze masks were prescribed. Afterwards, history quickly forgot it if historical markers are any indication. While we have a number of markers that mention this pandemic, this is the only one I found that discusses it exclusively. Contributing Editor Mike Wintermantel of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, found it in 2014. March 29–April 4, 2020 — First Electric Power Pole Los Angeles, CaliforniaImagine your life without elec­tri­ci­ty. In this city the govern­ment still holds the mo­no­po­ly to distribute it after planting its first pole here this week in 1916. The De­part­ment of Water and Power commemorated an unsightly but necessary piece of “street furniture” with this plaque in 1952. Contributing Correspondent Craig Baker of Sylmar, California, came across it just last year. March 22–28, 2020 — John Burroughs Highland Falls, New YorkSerene, I fold my hands and wait,\n\nNor care for wind, nor tide, nor sea;\n\nI rave no more ’gainst time or fate,\n\nFor, lo! my own shall come to me.\n\nThis poet and naturalist, who died this week in 1921, wrote “Waiting” here in 1862.

March 8–14, 2020 — Huntleyville Nolan WV, KentuckyIt was deep in the mountains of eastern Kentucky on a misty autumn morning, looking for the Moses Stepp official state marker—it about “colorful” 120 year old frontiersman—that I stumbled across this unofficial marker about a small community that in 1965 named itself after NBC’s mid-century newsman Chet Huntley, and then passed the hat to erect this marker in 1974 when he died. March 1–7, 2020 — The Dred Scott Decision Frederick, MarylandThis infamous Supreme Court decision was handed down this week in 1857. Cha­rac­te­rized as one of many legal efforts to protect and reinforce the practice of slavery in America, it was another precursor to Civil War five years later. This 2009 marker summarizes the decision, what happened to the enslaved Scotts, and the decision's nullification by the 14th Amendment nine years later. Contributing correspondent Allen C. Browne of Silver Spring, Maryland, filed this entry in 2015 and documented the marker's removal from the courthouse in 2017. February 23–29, 2020 — A Place of Invention Baltimore, MarylandHow about a laugh this week! This plaque-on-a-plinth qualifies for inclusion into our database according to our rules: it is permanent, outdoors, and speaks of history. We don't pass judgement on what is written, instead we let the facts be explained or refuted lower down on the page. And while we are on the subject: No, George Washington did not wear wooden teeth—they were in fact made of ivory, gold and lead as shown here. One of our first editors, Christopher Busta-Peck now of Shaker Heights, Ohio, filed this entry in 2008 when he lived in Baltimore. February 16–22, 2020 — Tom Mix & Tony, Jr. Florence, ArizonaThis is a marker about a re­co­ver­ed stolen em­bel­lish­ment of a silent film star’s horse—Tony the Wonder Horse—who was a movie star his own right. The marker to which this metal silhouette was originally attached is 18 miles down the road at the spot where Tom Mix died—in a sports car crash—and was recovered this week 1994. Contributing Editor Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona, filed this entry in 2010. February 9–15, 2020 — Take Her Down Selma, AlabamaThis tablet tells the story of Submarine Commander Howard Gilmore, who this week in 1943 in the Southwest Pacific, under heavy fire from an enemy gunboat, remained on deck while ordering his men below.

February 2–8, 2020 — Holly Grove “Bull Moose Special” Hansford, West VirginiaThe Coal Wars were flaring up again in 1912 when striking miners marched to the state capitol to read their declaration of war. This week in 1913 this armor-plated train built by the C&O Railway—complete with Gatling guns mounted on the baggage car—fired more than 100 rounds over this tent village of displaced miners and through the frame house of strike organizer Cesco Estep, killing him. A week later armed miners attacked the company store in nearby Mucklow, killing two. Martial law was imposed again, the U.S. Army deployed, and military tribunals meted summary justice.
