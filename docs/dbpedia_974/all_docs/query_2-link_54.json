        "text": "11306 Old Georgetown Road\n\nCity Directories and History: Constructed in 1768 in the Georgian style. Also known as: The Brick Church at Wambaw\n\nSt. James’ Church, erected in 1768, is an excellent example of the effort made in the last third of the 18th century to give South Carolina’s small\n\nGeorgian brick crossroad churches, with typical rectangular plans, a more sophisticated exterior design. The building and its interiors, including a revised seating plan, appear to be original. The exterior includes architectural features not found in earlier brick country churches built on similar rectangular plans. The hipped-roof Georgian body of St. James’ is preceded, both front and rear, by classic pedimented porticoes, each three bays wide.\n\nThe eight brick columns have molded bases and capitals, and the shafts, built up in perfect circles, display both diminution and entasis. The main entrance is located in the center of the long south elevation and there is a side door in the center of the west end. Originally there may have also been a center door in the long north side, at the point now occupied by the brick vestry room. The doors and windows are topped by fanlights and brick round arches, a Palladian window is situated in the center of the east end. Listed in the National Register April 15, 1970; Designated a National Historic Landmark April 15, 1970. (The building measures 58 – 37 feet)\n\nView the complete text of the nomination form for this National Register property.

It was also referred to as French Santee in contrast to English Santee in the St. Stephen’s area. (Information from: Names in South Carolina by C.H. Neuffer, Published by the S.C.
