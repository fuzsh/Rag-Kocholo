        "text": "It is the whole community, the Body of Christ united with its Head, that celebrates. \"Liturgical services are not private functions but are celebrations of the Church which is 'the sacrament of unity,' namely, the holy people united. We are our best as Church when we gather to do what they Lord has asked us to do in his memory. Namely to celebrate the Eucharist. Do this in memory of me.\n\nWe know from the teachings of the Second Vatican Council that the Eucharist is the 'source and summit of the Christian life' in that the Eucharist is the culmination of God's saving actions in Jesus Christ and of our worship and union with Him who leads us to the Father in the power of the Holy Spirit. As the source and summit of the Christian life, the Eucharist is so to speak a two-way street. The Eucharist leads us as our starting point out into the world of daily life and it takes us back home to the Eucharist after our sojourn in the world. The obligation to attend Mass on Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation seeks to codified this centrality of the Eucharist in our Catholic lives.\n\nWe therefore are called to full, conscious, and active participation. No longer a passive experience being in the sacramental presence of the Lord calls to action. Each is called to be engaged in the “parts” of the liturgy that are proper to them. All should not only have a sense of knowing what they are doing, but seek to take it to heart, to embody, what is said in the prayers, sung in the music and done in the sacraments. We consider how we are called to be disciples of Christ. We actively participate in each part of the liturgy in the hopes of growing in the discipleship Christ calls each person to within the liturg\n\nCertain members are called by God, in and through the Church, to a special service of the community. These servants are chosen and consecrated by the sacrament of Holy Orders, by which the Holy Spirit enables them to act in the person of Christ the head, for the service of all the members of the Church. For the purpose of assisting the work of the common priesthood of the faithful, other particular ministries also exist, their functions are determined by the bishops, in accord with liturgical traditions and pastoral needs. Servers, readers, commentators, and members of the choir also exercise a genuine liturgical function.\n\nIn the celebration of the sacraments it is thus the whole assembly that is leitourgos, each according to his function, but in the \"unity of the Spirit\" who acts in all. \"In liturgical celebrations each person, minister or lay person, who has an office to perform, should carry out all and only those parts which pertain to his office by the nature of the rite and the norms of the liturgy.\" (Catechism of the Catholic Church #1140-1144)\n\nDo you feel a call to serve? Do you wish to participate in any of our Liturgical Ministries to adore, worship and serve God? Be it the Liturgy of the Word, or the Liturgy of the Eucharist, or even many of our behind the scenes ministries, we could use your help.

If you are interested in any of these ministries please contact the parish office (732-741-0500)."
