        "text": "\"Taking a leak is not a luxury, it is a basic human necessity\" A hugely important piece from The Big Issue, addressing the significant impact public toilet closures are having on the physical and emotional wellbeing of people across this country. The British Toilet Association estimates nearly 60% of public loos have been lost since 2010, mostly a result of slashed council budgets. \"Yinka barely steps outside because she is afraid she will urinate herself. On the rare occasion she leaves the house, she starves and dehydrates herself the night before. She is isolated. And she blames a public toilets crisis across the UK\". Research, commissioned by bladder care company Jude shows: -67% have deliberately dehydrated themselves as a result of no toilet access -41% of people have had health issues such as bladder & kidney problems -60% of women & more than half of people surveyed feel stressed, worried, anxious or panic-ridden when they cannot find a public toilet -37% have hesitated on or cancelled going out to cope with a failure of public toilet provision Maddeningly, this is far too easy to cover up thanks to the complex issues associated with needing the toilet â€“ an invisible issue steeped in shame and embarrassment. Added to which, neither government nor local councils have any legal obligation to provide basic public toilet facilities. Quite something when you consider: a) using the toilet is a basic human right b) you can be fined for urinating in public c) businesses are legally obliged to provide toilet facilities for employees (righty so) If we hope to get this issue seen and responded to, we must keep telling the stories of the very real impact public toilet closures are having on the health and quality of life for a significant proportion of people across the country. It's been a privilege to work with Jude and their brilliant and inspiring founder, Peony Li, on this hugely important piece of work. https://lnkd.in/eT97F6Rw"
