        "text": "Who remembers the rock group called, Toto?\n\nToday on Day’s to remember, we celebrate Jeff Porcaro’s birthday who was born on April 1st 1954 and was an American drummer, songwriter, and producer best known for his work with the rock band Toto.\n\nPorcaro was born in Hartford, Connecticut, the eldest son of Los Angeles session percussionist Joe Porcaro and his wife, Eileen.\n\nPorcaro was raised in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles and attended Ulysses S. Grant High School.\n\nPorcaro began playing drums at the age of seven. Lessons came from his father Joe Porcaro, followed by further studies with Bob Zimmitti and Richie Lepore.\n\nWhen he was seventeen, Porcaro got his first professional gig playing in Sonny and Cher’s touring band.\n\nHe toured with Boz Scaggs before co-founding Toto with his brother Steve and childhood friends Steve Lukather and David Paich. Jeff Porcaro is renowned among drummers for the drum pattern he used on the Grammy Award winning Toto song “Rosanna”, from the album Toto IV.\n\nOne of my favorite songs from the group called Toto is the song called, “Spiritual Man.”\n\nIf you never heard that song before I encourage you to hear it below from today’s YouTube video clip below, shared by user name (miracleuix2006), as we celebrate Jeff Porcaro’s birthday from Toto.\n\nBesides his work with Toto, he was also a highly sought after session musician. He collaborated with many of the biggest names in music, including Boz Scaggs, Paul McCartney, Dire Straits, Donald Fagen, Steely Dan, Rickie Lee Jones, Michael Jackson, Al Jarreau, George Benson, Joe Walsh, Joe Cocker, Stan Getz, Sérgio Mendes, Lee Ritenour, Christopher Cross, James Newton-Howard, Jim Messina, Barbra Streisand, Donna Summer, Diana Ross, Eric Carmen, Eric Clapton, Miles Davis, Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, Larry Carlton, Michael McDonald, Seals & Crofts, and David Gilmour.\n\nPorcaro died on August 5, 1992 at the age of 38. The rock star fell ill after spraying insecticide in the yard of his Hidden Hills home and died that evening at Humana Hospital-West Hills.\n\nAccording to one Los Angeles Times report, The Los Angeles County Coroner’s office listed the cause of death to be a heart attack from atherosclerosis induced by cocaine use, not from an allergic reaction to the pesticides as presumed immediately after his death and stated by Toto in the band’s official history.\n\nThe official cause of death reported by the coroner has long been the subject of intense debate, with Porcaro’s family, friends, and Toto bandmates claiming that while he did occasionally use cocaine, he was by no means a heavy drug user nor was he an addict.\n\nMost of the people who knew him state that the coroner’s report is wrong, and that he died of a combination of undiagnosed heart disease and organophosphate poisoning caused by the insecticide he was spraying on the day he died.\n\nWhat great talent Jeff Porcaro was, and legacy of music he left for us to enjoy, as we celebrate his birthday on April 1st."
