        "text": "It’s a weird title, but I seriously need to know. After reading further you might want to know too. I will always take an opportunity to brag on James Newton Howard. I’ve always enjoyed his film scores, and his work on Raya doesn’t disappoint. Howard has an amazing ability to tell a story that you can remember upon hearing the music, even when you aren’t watching the film in front of you. One thing I noticed is how he tells the story of Raya and Namaari even in music. I know that many people don’t think there is any kind of relationship between the women other than a platonic one. However it is interesting to note the musicality of their relationship, as well as in relationship to James Newton Howard’s other works. I believe when comparing with common themes in other examples of Howard’s work, it can be seen that there is greater emphasis on Raya and Namaari beyond that of friendship.\n\nI would like to point out for those that don’t know, that Kelly Marie Tran personally ships the two characters so she had that in mind while voicing Raya. It made me wonder if Howard did the same thing.\n\nThe third track on the album is titled, “Young Raya and Namaari.” They do not have any other tracks on the album with a title that refers to them together. Other scenes where they have heavy interaction are focused on the plot of the film, such as “Fleeing from Tail,” “Spine Showdown,” “The Meeting,” “The Druun Close In,” and “Return.” None of these other tracks contain their name in the title. Why is that? Well in “Young Raya and Namaari,” we see the two characters meet, and see the forming of their friendship as they bond. This track could easily have been named something related to the different chiefs meeting, Instead, this focuses specifically on Raya and Namaari, and their relationship to one another. There is a little information expose, but it is strictly from the perspective of the two girls. The audience learns a little more about the world of Kumandra, but nothing specific to the plot moving forward happens. This is reserved for the track titled, “Betrayed.” This is where the friendship is essentially over for the girls. Why create a separate track if the music still relates to the girls? Because at that point it’s about plot and not the relationship. So what does it mean that Raya and Namaari have a track dedicated specifically to them?\n\nMany composers will create a musical piece specifically for a romantic pairing, and will name it after the two characters. Klaus Badelt does this with, “Will and Elizabeth” in Pirates of the Caribbean the Curse of the Black Pearl, and John Williams does this with “Anakin and Padme” in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. This is something that can be seen in other works of James Newton Howard as well. I looked at movies that contained romantic relationships, whether they were central to the plot or considered a subplot. In the Disney film’s Dinosaur and Atlantis: The Lost Empire, there are tracks titled “Aladar & Neera” and “Milo Meets Kida” respectively. These relationships would be considered subplots to their films, however Howard makes the point of giving them a track titled in respect to the characters relationships, both ending in romance. In The Hunger Games films, romance is considered a subplot to the main events of the story. It is even a narrative that starts in The Hunger Games and carries all the way through to Mockingjay Part 2, however Howard never gives a title track to Katniss or Peeta that emphasizes their relationship. There are tracks such as “Searching for Peeta” and “Healing Katniss,” but they don’t refer to the characters relationship. Another example is the 2003 film Peter Pan. While there is a touch of childhood romance that is often associated with Peter and Wendy, there is nothing to dictate that in the track listing of the original score, and the film does not end in romance either as they are children. One film where romance is not a subplot, but is central to the plot is the 2011 film, Water for Elephants. For this film score, Howard named a track “Jacob Sees Marlena.” This does describe what is happening in the plot of the film, but it is also a pivotal moment because it’s the start of the romance that drives the film.\n\nWhile this is not proof of a romantic relationship, it does show that Raya and Namaari’s relationship is an important driving factor to the film. In comparison to other works of Howards, it is interesting that he would choose to do it for some relationships and not others. In The Hunger Games and Peter Pan, while those relationships do help to drive the plot they are not the main focus of the issues that the characters face. For Katniss, it’s the games themselves and the dystopian world they live in, and for Wendy, it’s leaving adolescence behind and growing into an adult. When looking at the examples of Dinosaur, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, and Water for Elephants, you have main characters that no longer fit into their world and find home in their new world and new romantic partner. By the end of their respective films: Aladar finds the new nesting grounds and Neera, Milo finds Atlantis and Kida, and Jacob finds the circus and Marlena. It can be argued that Raya and the Last Dragon follows this trend, with Raya finding New Kumandra and Namaari.\n\nAt this point, only track title relation to film plot has been analyzed. To take it further, I would like to get into the actual sound and composition of the songs in Raya. Get your music streaming ready for the next portion.\n\nThe first motif that I noticed from their suite can be heard while the characters are children, and again when they meet with the gem pieces. In “Young Raya and Namaari,” at :31 the motif that can be heard can also be heard again at :54 in “The Meeting.” The notes that are the exact same all play when the characters either see the gem stone or Sisu together. The seconds that precede these timestamps aren’t the exact same, but they are very similar and have some of the same notes. Specifically from :00 — :20 of “Young Raya and Namaari” and :29-:48 of “The Meeting.” It’s interesting that this motif is repeated here because it mirrors Raya and Namaari’s first meeting, where they are both unsure about the other. It makes sense to hear it again here in contrast to their other meetings. When they meet in Talon, and Spine it is as adversaries. When they meet outside of Fang they are both unsure about each other, but seem to be open to possibility much like the first time they met.\n\nThe second motif I noticed while listening to “Return.” Part of their motif is incredibly similar to the motif used for Sisu. In fact, it is the Sisu motif only slowed down, and played with different instruments. This specific part of the Rayamaari suite can be heard at :41 of “Young Raya and Namaari” and 3:58 and 4:23 of “Return.” At the first timestamp it is only Raya and Sisu, but by the second timestamp Namaari has entered the scene. The music changes to a warmer and richer tone, which is an interesting way to show change in the character. It differs from the first time we hear it when they are children versus at the end when they are young adults. Having this motif play again at the very end is a great way to mirror the start of Raya and Namaari’s friendship as they bonded over Sisu.\n\nWith “Young Raya and Namaari” we don’t hear a repeat of any motifs after 1:22. Which is a shame, because from 1:22–2:09 is so great. It’s only about forty seconds, but it’s one of my favorite moments from the soundtrack (other than “The Graveyard.” Best track in my opinion.) There is such a tenderness and curiosity to the sound. If we were ever graced with a sequel, I would love to hear more of that backing Raya and Namaari’s interactions.\n\nWhile none of this proves that there is an intended romance between Raya and Namaari, it doesn’t prove that their only friends either. Even Howard Shore, didn’t give Sam and Frodo a dedicated track to their friendship in any of the three Lord of the Rings films. Obi-Wan and Anakin, didn’t get a friendship track either except for when it was ended in Revenge of the Sith. Not even the friendship of Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes were lucky enough to get a track on any of the MCU soundtracks. To have a track named after “character A” and “character B” tends to follow the pattern that the two are linked, more romantically than platonically. It’s easy to see their story as just gals being pals. However if you look at it outside of heteronormativity, it follows two classic tropes. Meeting while they are young — the Puppy Love trope, reuniting years later — The Old Flame trope, and a fan favorite The Enemies to Lovers trope. Had one of these characters been male and followed the exact same storyline, it would be obvious that they were a potential romantic pairing. Add in a soundtrack with a song dedicated especially to them, and it’s incredibly obvious. Do these girls have a lot of trust issues to work on? Absolutely, but I’d love to see a healthy relationship from these two in a sequel. James Newton Howard, I don’t know if you’re an undercover shipper, but I thank you for the glorious music you create."
