        "text": "Joe Porcaro (1930-2020) Emil Richards (1932-2019)\n\nThe benefit of my years as a manufacturers representative was the ability to see and hear great musicians at the NAMM winter show in Los Angeles. I could also sample different instruments, sticks and cymbals.\n\nAlways looking for the perfect cymbal sound, I discovered the drumsticks made by Joe Porcaro. I used these sticks for many years and became friends with Joe and his wife Eileen.\n\nThe first time I met and spoke to Joe was on the floor during a PAS event. I was walking the show when he approached, casually walking around. I introduced myself to him, said, I’d been using his sticks. He was very friendly.\n\nI had recently recorded my CD, Zulu Time. I gave him a copy. He looked at it and said, Oh! you’re a Bebop player. I didn’t really think much about that, at the time. I guess I was, considering the tunes were composed by Monk, Miles Davis, Mingus and others.\n\nFrom that first meeting, I became friends with Joe, bought his sticks over the telephone. He was great to hand pick them and ship them to me at a reduced price.\n\nI saw him and his wife again, another year, another PAS show. Somehow, he had heard about my involvement with the AFM, American Federation of Musicians. Maybe I’ll speak about that another time.\n\nJoe was a great player and educator. He’s the father of Toto drummer, Jeff Porcaro. With drummer-educator Ralph Humphrey, they founded the Los Angeles Music Academy.\n\nAs a friend of percussionist Emil Richards, they performed on hundreds of film scores and recordings.\n\nJoe recorded film music by composers: James Newton Howard, John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, James Horner and Danny Elfman. If it’s a major film with drums and percussion, it was Joe and Emil.\n\nJoe and Emil performed jazz gigs around Los Angeles. I heard their group at NAMM. Joe was also a left-handed drummer. He was a Paiste endorser and made his own sticks, called Diamond Tip. His cymbal stick sound was very clean and articulate. That’s what I loved about his sticks. I still have a few special Diamond Tips, I use for special occasions.\n\nEmil Richards (1932-2019)\n\nI heard Emil Richards play with his jazz group at NAMM. The band included Joe Porcaro on drumset. Richards began playing xylophone at the age of six. In 1954, he moved to New York City. He was a member of the George Shearing group before moving to Los Angeles.\n\nIn those early days, Emil Richards was involved with composer, inventor Harry Partch. I did not know that, until recently. He is also credited on the historic, Harry Partch 1969 recording, The World of Harry Partch and Delusion of Fury.\n\nIn an earlier feature, I wrote about my friend, percussionist, actor, dancer Bo Wagner. Bo plays the marimba solo on the tune, Afternoon Delight, by Starbuck. Bo was a student of Emil Richards in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1962, Richards was part of a worldwide tour with Frank Sinatra. This was the beginning of his collection of ethnic percussion instruments.\n\nEmil Richards’ life as a recording studio percussionist is amazing. There are a few Youtube videos that capture his genius.\n\nA couple novel sessions include playing bongos on the Mission Impossible television theme and finger snaps for The Addams Family theme.\n\nEmil Richards’ discography is an unbelievable, eclectic list of artist. A few include: The Doors, Frank Zappa, Steely Dan, Peggy Lee, Mongo Santamaria, Phil Spector, Marvin Gaye, Bobby Darin, The Beach Boys.\n\nJoe Porcaro and Emil Richards were pioneers. (Possibly, the last musician-percussionist to achieve that kind of professional music success as studio recording musicians)"
