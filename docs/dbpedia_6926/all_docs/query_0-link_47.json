        "text": "Missin’ Toto? Good news! The Dogz of Oz World Tour will begin this Feb 2022! And soon we will be having again this so-called “Last Song Syndrome (LSS)” (where people tend to sing the last song we heard lol). So, everybody sing … “I hear the drums echoing tonight…” Wait, and who plays that drums at night?!!! Hush, I guess your good neighbor is not alright with it 😉 … But seriously, have you ever wonder who played the drums with Toto especially after the passing of Jeff Porcaro? Well, let’s check them out here, from members, to fill ins, and to the session and touring drummers!\n\nOoops, but wait, before we continue, here’s a little fun fact with the song Africa, Jeff and Joe Porcaro have made some percussion loops on marimba and bottle caps to recreate the sounds that Jeff heard at the New York World’s Fair in 1964 by the African pavilion drummers. By the way, Joe Porcaro is a well-known American jazz drummer and percussionist, and of course, without him, there will be no Jeff the drummer, Mike the bassist, and Steve the keyboardist of the legendary band, Toto.\n\nNow let’s meet the Toto’s drummers!\n\nThe Members\n\nOk, ready? Let’s start with the original, the main man, Jeff Porcaro, without him, there will be no Toto. To the one and only personal choice of the band when Jeff left for good and started to rock the heaven away, the brilliant Simon Phillips. And to another talented drummer who replaced Simon when he left the band to concentrate on his solo career, Keith Carlock.\n\nJeff Porcaro (The Original, 1977 – 1992)\n\nTo do the kick-start on Toto’s drummers, here’s none other than the “Man with the golden feel”, Jeff Porcaro!\n\nMade more famous for his drumming on the Grammy Award winning song, Rosanna called the Half-Time Shuffle Groove, which was inspired from the “Purdie Shuffle” by Bernard Purdie and added with some artistic and creativity from John Bonham’s groove in the song “Fool In The Rain” by the Led Zeppelin.\n\nJeffrey Thomas Porcaro, the eldest son of the famous American jazz drummer and percussionist, and of an Italian descent Joe Porcaro and wife Eileen, was born on 1 April 1954. At the age of seven, Porcaro started playing drums, and his first lessons were from his father, Joe. He took further studies with Richie Lepore and Bob Zimmitti.\n\nPorcaro became part of the touring band of the American pop and entertainment duo, Sonny & Cher (the husband and wife, Sonny Bono and Cher) at his very young age of seventeen. This was considered as his first professional gig. During those times, his drum heroes were Jim Keltner (According to Howard Sounes, Bob Dylan’s biographer, he was “the leading session drummer in America”), and Jim Gordon (the drummer of Eric Clapton’s blues rock band in the 1970s, Derek and the Dominos, and was also a famous session drummer in the late 1960’s and 1970s).\n\nHe was so talented that he already played on hundreds of albums during his twenties. Started with Steely Dan, then toured with Boz Scaggs, and then co-founded the we all know now as a very famous band, Toto.\n\nAside from being the drummer of the band Toto, he was also a very in-demand session musician. He collaborated with many of the prominent names in the music industry, including George Benson, Eric Clapton, Joe Cocker, Christopher Cross, Dire Straits, David Gilmour, Steely Dan, Elton John, Paul McCartney, Bee Gees, Pink Floyd, Diana Ross, Boz Scaggs, Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, Joe Walsh, and a lot more!\n\nHere are Jeff Porcaro’s Discography with Toto:\n\nToto (1978)\n\nHydra (1979)\n\nTurn Back (1981)\n\nToto IV (1982)\n\nIsolation (1984)\n\nDune [original soundtrack] (1984)\n\nOlympic Games 1984 (soundtrack) [original soundtrack] (1984)\n\nFahrenheit (1986)\n\nThe Seventh One (1988)\n\nPast to Present 1977 – 1990 (1990)\n\nKingdom of Desire (1992, released posthumously and dedicated to Jeff’s memory)\n\nToto XX (1998)\n\nGreatest Hits Live…and More (DVD with behind the scenes footage and interviews)\n\nOld Is New (2018, posthumous appearance)\n\nAnd with the other artists???

In the 1995 album of Michael Jackson, HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I, he made a dedication in the liner notes for Porcaro.\n\nBut all good things, comes to an end. On 5 August 1992, at the age of 38, Porcaro died after falling ill due to the insecticide he sprayed. According to a coroner, it was determined heart attack as a consequence of occlusive coronary artery disease that is caused by atherosclerosis that is associated from the use of cocaine. But according to Los Angeles County Coroner spokesman, with some doctors who treated Porcaro, the heart attack was caused by an allergic reaction due to the inhaled pesticide that he sprayed. And also, according to his bandmate Steve Lukather, Porcaro has a smoking habit and he had also been suffering with a long-standing heart condition which both contributed to his death.\n\n“Our love doesn’t end here; it lives forever, on the Wings of Time.”, These were written on his epitaph from the lyrics of Wings of Time from their album Kingdom of Desire.\n\nSimon Phillips (1992 – 2008, 2010-2014)\n\nNext in line is another amazing drummer, so without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, here’s Simon Phillips!\n\nThe technically brilliant, self-taught composer, song writer, record producer, and of course jazz, pop, and rock drummer Simon Phillips was born on 6 February 1957. He was just twelve years of age when he started to play professionally with the dixieland or the traditional jazz band led by his father for 4 years. After his father died, he started to play pop and rock. He then found a work as a session musician for the cast members of the musical Jesus Christ Superstar. In the 1970s and 1980s, he worked with different rock bands. In 1981, he formed a duo called Ph.D but split up in 1983. He also recorded his debut album with the band Protocol in 1989.\n\nJeff Porcaro liked his drumming style, that is why he was the only choice by Toto when Porcaro passed away. He officially joined the band after the Kingdom of Desire tour. He was with Toto from 1992 – 2008, and from February 2010 – January 2014. Simon’s last show with the band was in 2013, and left the following year to concentrate on his solo career. Simon Phillips is still on fire until now, in fact, just this 4 February 2022, he released the album Protocol V.\n\nYou can check the album here: www.simon-phillips.com/music/protocol-v.\n\nSince we all know how very in-demand he was starting from the 1970s up to now, here are only some of his Discography:\n\nAs the leader:\n\nProtocol (Food for Thought, 1988)\n\nSimon Phillips (Manhattan, 1992)\n\nForce Majeure with Ray Russell, Anthony Jackson, Tony Roberts (B&W, 1993)\n\nSymbiosis (Lipstick, 1995)\n\nAnother Lifetime (Lipstick, 1997)\n\nOut of the Blue (Victor, 1999)\n\nVantage Point with Jeff Babko (Jazzline, 2000)\n\nProtocol II with Andy Timmons, Steve Weingart, Ernest Tibbs (Phantom, 2013)\n\nProtocol III with Andy Timmons, Steve Weingart, Ernest Tibbs (In-akustik, 2015)\n\nProtocol 4 with Greg Howe, Dennis Hamm, Ernest Tibbs (Phantom, 2017)\n\nAs sideman:\n\nWith Duncan Browne\n\nThe Wild Places (1978)\n\nStreets Of Fire (1979)\n\nWith Asia\n\nAqua (1992)\n\nAura (2001)\n\nWith DarWin\n\nDarWin 2: A Frozen War (2020)\n\nWith Derek Sherinian\n\nInertia (Inside Out, 2001)\n\nBlack Utopia (J.S.H.P., 2003)\n\nMythology (Inside Out, 2004)\n\nBlood of the Snake (Inside Out, 2006)\n\nOceana (Music Theories, 2011)\n\nThe Phoenix (Inside Out, 2020)\n\nWith Gary Moore\n\nBack on the Streets (1978)\n\nAfter the War (1989)\n\nWith Gordon Giltrap\n\nVisionary (The Electric Record Company, catalogue no.
