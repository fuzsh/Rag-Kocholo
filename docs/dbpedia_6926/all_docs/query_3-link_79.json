        "text": "WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS HEAVY PLOT SPOILERS!\n\nSix years after “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2”, which was said to be the final entry in the world-famous Harry Potter series, author J. K. Rowling’s Wizarding World once again sees the light of cinema screens all around the world, much to the delight of the ever-growing fanbase.\n\nFocusing on the adventures of zoologist Newt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne, in 1920’s New York community of witches and wizards, the story takes place seventy years before the events in the Potter series. With director David Yates returning to helm the franchise, speculations emerged if he would reunite with his fellow collaborators on the Potter movies, namely Nicholas Hooper and French Academy Award darling Alexandre Desplat. However, veteran composer James Newton Howard, who always seemed to have a soft spot for large-scale fantasy epics, was ultimately chosen to continue the series’s rich musical legacy. Following in the giant footsteps of John Williams, his intention was to minimalize any references to previous scores but instead focus on creating a new musical world while still staying true to the Potter spirit.\n\nUnlike Howard Shore’s multi-layered Middle-Earth scores, Howard’s thematic writing in here has more in common with illustrating certain moods amd feelings rather than representing specific characters; the motifs and themes the composer establishes and develops throughout the entire score are not nearly as clear-defined as in other composers’ works. Despite this surely causing some confusion among casual listeners, it allows the composer to fully explore the magical world J. K. Rowling has created with her first-ever screenplay even into its smallest detail and to reflect Newt Scamander’s chase after his magical creatures music-wise. Once you have started to concentrate on the music, you will surely appreciate the thematic depth and magnitude of wonderful little motifs with which Howard graces his score.\n\nApart from the returning “Hedwig’s Theme” which only makes two cameo appearances on album (there’s a third one featured in the movie’s Erumpent scene), there’s enough new material to be found in here: One overarching theme for the franchise, the “Fantastic Beasts theme” is introduced very early on and plays over the movie’s opening credits. Unfortunately, its simplistic nature slightly diminishes its powerful effect. The mesmerizing “Wizarding World theme”, first played in the subsequent “There Are Witches Among Us”, further explored in a special concert arrangement, “A Man and His Beasts”, is quite an improvement; it adds a layer of otherworldly wondrousness the previous theme misses – interestingly, Howard originally decided to give this a shot over the opening credits, but, after holding response with director David Yates, ultimately decided to make some late changes. Luckily, this turns out as the only misfire: From the Charlie-Chaplinesque Newt theme over the energetic, brassy “Newt the Hero” theme that brings up memories of Howard’s own “Waterworld” to the heartbreaking “Healing/Friendship theme” that appears very late on in “A Close Friend” and the jazzy, lively material written for the likable no-maj Jacob Kowalski, Howard is firing on all cylinders. Add some minor motifs for the Thunderbird, the American wizard Credence and a love theme for Kowlaski and Queenie and you have a solid thematic basis.\n\nThe album opener “Main Titles – Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” introduces a slightly altered version of John Williams’s famous “Hewig’s Theme” – surely an admission to the masses due to its enormous popularity, but fortunately, Howard keeps these references at an absolute minimum and immediately takes over with his own ideas as both the orchestra and the choir are exploding into a rousing performance of the overarching “Fantastic Beasts theme” that, further enhanced by heavy percussion and subtle electronics, not only accompanies the movie’s antagonist Gellert Grindelwald’s first-ever appearance but simultaneously plays during the news reel reporting about his terrorist attacks. As the setting changes, the score’s tone changes as well: For the first time, the viewer gets to see Newt Scamander, carefully calming down his beasts on a ship to New York, expectantly looking forward to enter the American metropolis. Filled with an optimistic esprit, the playful A phrase of his theme emerges, just before the soaring B Phrase, highlighted by a charming string performance, musically visualizing the young wizard’s first view on New York, takes command. The lovely A Phrase ends the cue on a playful yet reflective note.\n\nThe subsequent “There Are Witches Among Us/The Bank/The Niffler” sees Newt wandering through his new home, studying the place and the people living there. In front of a bank, he encounters Mary Lou Barebone, a non-magical woman who heads the New Salem Philanthropic Society, which claims that witches and wizards are a danger for every US citizen and, therefore, must be eliminated. As she addresses her threatful words to the listening audience, an Elfmanesque children’s choir, underpinned by celesta, harp and chimes creating an atmosphere of mystery and magic, echoes the Wizarding World theme. However, that does not last very long as one of Newt’s beast, the kleptomanic Niffler, escapes from his owner’s case. His comedic motif, first heard at 1:40, elegantly combines comedic woodwind writing with electronic percussion, playfully illustrating the chaos-causing chase through the bank where Newt meets the courteous but by the current events confused no-maj Jacob Kowalski. Midway through the hectic situation, an occamy slips out of one of the eggs Newt carries with him – Howard quite fittingly graces this moment with a celesta cameo appearance of John Williams’s “Hedwig’s Theme”, the second and last time on album he will include references to his predecessor’s original material. Alternating between the playful Niffler motif and Kowalski’s buoyantly jazzy theme, the cue ends with Newt being arrested by MACUSA auror Tina Goldstein after accidentally having swapped suitcases with Kowalski.\n\nDespite its short length, “Tina Takes Newt In/MACUSA Headquarters” shows how to perfectly capture the spirit and anatomy of a scene by using previously introduced thematic material: Quirky choir, fluid string writing and light woodwind performances form a playful variation of the “Wizarding World” theme accompanying Tina and Newt on their way to the Magical Congress of the United States of America. Noble brass and dynamic cello lines join in and, as the protagonists finally enter the building, culminate in a sweeping gala statement of Howard’s theme in a full orchestra-and-choir-performance before leading over into some jazz writing to highlighten the 1920 setting.\n\nThe subsequent “Pie or Strudel/Escaping Queenie and Tina’s Place” once again builds upon the “Wizarding World” theme, this time presented in a more playful variation but soon pushed aside by other themes appearing during the first encounter between the film’s main character quartet in the Goldstein sisters’ apartment. Interwoven in Howard’s woodwind-heavy underscoring is the first glimpse of the “Newt the Hero” theme on which the composer expands later on as well as another statement of Kowalski’s theme which – together with a brief hint of their love theme – musically illustrates the soon-developing romantic attraction to the mind-reading witch Queenie, Tina’s sister.\n\nHoward ultimately leaves the lighthearted atmosphere and introduces the listener to the film’s subplot, bringing some darkness to the music, that centers around the witch-and-wizard-hating Mary Lou Barebone: Subtle electronics and menacing percussion dominate the soundscape in “Credence Hands Out Leaflets” before the ominous Obscurus motif makes its fist appearence.\n\nNext up is the 9-minute “Inside the Case”, a JNH masterclass in how to write lengthy orchestral cues for film by both concentrating on thematic work and simultaneously maintaining a strong musical narrative. Within the cue’s running time, accompanying Newt taking Kowalski inside his magically expanded case and introducing him to the wide variety of fantastic beasts he keeps inside, the composer successfully manages to tie a multitude of themes and motifs together that, in this combination, is nothing short but outstanding. Opening with a rousing brass fanfare – the Thunderbird’s theme – Howard carefully guides the orchestra through a cheerful-serene woodwind performance of Newt theme’s A phrase, followed by a jubilant statement of the soaring B phrase and numerous thematic ideas that are going to follow: Kowalski’s theme is given several appearances to show his fascination and excitement for the magical creatures Howard graces with little motifs. At 6:44, the tone changes with the warm orchestral sound shifting to some tragic string writing, presenting the Obscurus’s motif for the first time as discovered by the curious Kowalski. A tender piano melody, underpinned by soft strings, ends the cue on a reflective note, reminding Kowalski and the listener that the peaceful togetherness of all the magical beasts would not be possible in the real world where creatures like these are constantly hunted by wizards and witches.\n\n“Gnarlak Negotiations” features some dirty jazz before the main quartet continues to find Newt’s last missing beasts in the action-packed “The Demiguise and the Occamy” – watch out for brilliant over-the-top Statement of Newt’s heroic theme. The subsequent “A Close Friend” creates a tender atmosphere as Newt fondly remembers his school friendship with Leta Lestrange during a short conversation with Queenie: Soft strings and a lovely choir introduce the “Healing/Friendship theme” on which Howard expands later on. “The Obscurus / Rooftop Chase” opens the grand finale and finally brings the Obscurus motif to full power before “He’s Listening To You Tina” provides a moment of bittersweet tragedy as Tina tries to calm down the aggressive Obscurus – which turns out as Credence – but cannot stop the arriving Aurors from attacking and destroying it.\n\nThe 12-minute “Relieve Him of His Wand / Newt Releases the Thunderbird / Jacob’s Farewell” underscores the film’s huge finale: Swirling strings and brass accompany the film’s biggest plottwist before carrying over to Newt’s theme. A spectacular, longing performance of the “Healing theme” emerges from the orchestra as Newt finally releases his Thunderbird, helping the American aurors to erase all New Yorkers’ recent memories of the destruction as MACUSA wizards repair the destruction. Jacob Kowalski’s memories are erased by the rain as well: Soft strings, augmented by cool piano tunes accompany the heartbreaking farewell from the newly found friend. At 11:06, Kowalski’s theme takes over – as if the whole adventure had never happened.\n\nA tender piano performance of the “Healing/Friendship theme” opens “Newt Says Goodbye to Tina/Jacob’s Bakery” as Newt departs for Europe, but, in the same breath, promises to return and visit Tina when his book is finished. Warm strings, enhanced by heavenly children’s choir, accompany the fragile moment of bittersweetness between the two main characters, both unsure of their feelings for each other. As Newt enters the ship for Europe and Tina slowly walks away, rising strings, underpinned by dancing woodwinds, illustrate their farewell for now. One last time, the setting changes to Kowalski who, with a case of silver Occamy eggshells anonymously given to him by Newt, has finally fulfilled his dream of founding a bakery. Muted trumpets, piano and walking bass return for a final statement of “Kowalski’s Rag” until Jacob, being merged in his work, looks up and sees Queenie, who has just entered the shop, innocently smiling at him. A lovely little rendition of their love theme, performed by dancing woodwinds, closes the scene and leads directly over to the movie’s end credits with the conclusive “End Titles – Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them” once again summarizing some of the score’s most important main themes. Opening with a swashbuckling brass fanfare we have not heard from Howard since “Waterworld”, a rousing performance of the “Newt the Hero” theme carries over. Searching string lines finally culminate into a sweeping major statement of Newt theme’s B phrase before Howard reprises the A phrase and ends the cue in a quite unusual manner with a minor chord of the string section, carefully foreshadowing that something is still to come and that our heroes’ adventures have just begun.\n\nMeanwhile, there is still some music to be found on the score’s 2-disc deluxe edition featuring around 20 minutes of additional score. While it is mostly build up of rather uninteresting suspense cues, there are still some hidden gems to be found. In particular, this concerns two concert suites the composers offers in here: The 8-minute “A Man and His Beasts” intelligently expands on the “Wizarding World theme”, opening with a magical choir performance, leading into massive orchestra-and-choir-statement and ending in a jaunty jazz arrangement, that undergoes multiple variations within the cue. Of equally particular note is “End Titles Pt.2 – Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them”, once again centering around the “Wizarding World theme” as well. Another suite comes with the conclusive “Kowalski’s Rag” that unsurprisingly builds on Kowalski’s themes and wonderfully shows the character’s development over the curse of the film: Following several performances of his major theme is his secondary theme, associated with his newly opened bakery, which then fades into a playful rendition of the love theme Howard has written for Queenie and him.\n\nBesides that, both the cues “Billywig” and “The Demiguise and the Lollipop” feature further statements of the “Fantastic Beasts theme”, accentuating the danger of the escaped creatures, while the trio of “Soup and Leaflets”, “I’m Not Your Ma” and “Newt Talks to Credence”, mostly atmospheric suspense writing, offers another insight into the composer’s thematic material for the character of Credence and, therefore, not only concentrates on his own mysterious theme but also on the Obscurus’s one.\n\nFollowing in John Williams’s gigantic footsteps is by no means an easy task. Coming up with something as memorable as what Williams would have written is probably the greatest challenge a film composer nowadays can face, especially when it comes to such a popular series as J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter franchise. Taking all that into account, the result with which composer James Newton Howard came up with is nothing short but outstanding: The fantasy veteran delivers a sweepingly symphonic score that features a multitude of memorable themes, all of them assembled into a coherent musical narrative, graced by colorful orchestrations and intelligent thematic interplay that beautifully showcases the composer’s ability to safely guide both the viewer and the listener through America’s wizarding world.\n\nRating: ****1/2\n\nMusic composed by James Newton Howard.
