        "text": "By far they are my favorite; however somehow I must convince generations of music lovers to believe what I believe; or love what I love. TOTO is a great and worthy band for the HOF!! There are dozens of other truly fantastic bands out there, that deserve to join. TOTO will make it, I know! God BlessE\n\nPosted by Thomas L. Holmes on Wednesday, 04/10/2013 @ 23:30pm\n\nWhy is there so much hate in these tread! If you don't like it, write it once not 10 times. I am for Toto's introduction, but RRHOF has not so much integrity by introducting Public Enemy. I mean why this Hall of Fame even has stil in its name Rock and Roll- I know that most of you here won't admit (and I don't mind for it) that Toto is rock band, but at least it would be more logic choice than Public Enemy.\n\nPosted by Billy B. Gilbert on Friday, 04/12/2013 @ 17:07pm\n\nA while back I read in a guitar magazine (I don't remember the name of it anymore) of musicians interviewing musicians. Eddie Van Halen and Steve Lukather were talking with each other and Eddie stated that Steve could play circles around him. Steve could play any style in any band. His discography speaks for him. Eddie stated that Steve could take his place in the band Van Halen and no one would know. I also remember reading a while back that Steve Porcaro played around with his synthesizers and created the digital sound, which influenced the keyboard Yamaha DX7 which was a huge hit. I am sure there are many more influences of Toto in the music industry than any one person knows. Musicians respect them. Simon Philips, one of the great drummers stated that when he was asked to become a member of Toto, he was honored. I say, vote 'em in!!\n\nPosted by Rick on Tuesday, 01/14/2014 @ 01:54am\n\nOF COURSE Toto should be inducted into the Rock Hall. They are more than deserving to be included. The members of Toto have been on more albums as session players than any other band in music history! That's a lot of influence in that alone. But Toto is a musicians band. They are beyond talented. And their music has a lot of heart and soul in it and if the haters took a moment to really listen - they would hear it. And their live performances brings their thunderous power to life. No one can leave a Toto show and not declare Luke a guitar god! Toto IV alone warrants their entry. But they are so much more. And, they are a working band who are still hard at it with a new album in the works for 2015.\n\nPosted by Steely Bear on Friday, 05/30/2014 @ 03:02am\n\nI just saw Toto in concert last week and they are as incredible as the day they released their first album. One must look at what Toto's contribution is all about...not just the records they released as a band, but the thousands (yes thousands) of other artist's records that Toto musicians played on (and/or help write)...and some of those bands are probably considered HOF caliber. Toto (often pronounced \"total\") has been a major fabric in pop music since the 70's, and it would be a huge disservice to the R&R music industry to not recognize such artists. They are a collaboration of the total package in music talent.\n\nPosted by Leo on Friday, 08/22/2014 @ 13:44pm\n\nThey're in the Musicians Hall of Fame. They swept the Grammys in 1982. If you do a search on Discogs for any of the core members of the group, you'll get pages and pages of references. True musicians will tell you that guys like Lukather and Jeff Porcaro are people that should be emulated throughout the ages. I knew a drummer who worked for months to master Porcaro's Rosanna Shuffle. When they lost a key member, they always replaced that person with someone of equal or better talent. David Hungate out? Mike Porcaro in. Bobby Kimball out? Joseph Williams in. (With Fergie Frederickson in-between.) Jeff Porcaro suddenly dies? Here comes Simon Phillips (who is frickin' amazing). And when Mike Porcaro gets ALS, they sub in guys like Leland Sklar and Nathan East, who are among the best bass players of all-time. Over the years, they've plugged in people like Warren Ham, Greg Phillinganes, Shannon Forrest, Keith Carlock and Shem von Schroeck when they needed a key player. The list of people who have jammed, toured and recorded with Toto is like their own personal musicians hall of fame.\n\nBottom line - do they deserve to get in? Hell, yeah, they do. But will they? As long as it's Jan the Wiener's personality contest, no, they won't. Eventually, they'll probably just be the best band never inducted into the hall. And knowing what I know about the guys who are still alive, they really won't be that broken up over it. Jan the Wiener may get some satisfaction out of keeping them out, but they'll have the satisfaction of knowing that for 40 years, they recorded a lot of kick-ass tunes and played in front of very appreciative, sold-out crowds around the world. I'm just glad I got to be in a few of those audiences.\n\nPosted by Capnpen on Wednesday, 09/16/2020 @ 17:05pm\n\nI'm trying to calmly communicate my thoughts on Toto's shot at getting into the RRHF. So, here goes. Growing up, my taste in music was really diverse. Had the same visions of playing in a band that most had in the late 60's. Then I went to my first arena concert; Alice Cooper! I was floored. Sat dead center, row 20! That was it, I'm starting up a band! I then saw the Doobie Brothers and the Moody Blues live and became obsessed. I've played in bands for over 35 years and come to truly respect talent. What it takes to sound and perform. How to write charts and transpose. Never had much success at it but had a shit load of fun performing. I ramble on because during the pandemic I had time to listen to a lot of music. My favorites and deep tracks. I also watched a number of \"live\" concerts and I was stunned when I watched Toto live 2013. They not only reproduced the studio sound but performed them with even more feel/emotion! They performed to a tee... without question they should be in the RRHF!!! Sorry for rambling, but the more I listen and watch that concert the more I'd like to see this band get the respect they've earned. From their studio contributions to the industry and their live performances, they need to be inducted just to see them on stage delivering the goods while they still can!\n\nPosted by John Hackett on Friday, 07/15/2022 @ 13:17pm\n\nMany have talked about the thousands of albums that the Toto members have played on. Well how about the amount of great artist and musicians that have taken time out of their lives to be a part of a Toto album; that's a tribute onto itself.\n\nI don't know what type of politics plays into snubbing Toto, although it's very shameful.\n\nIn each and every year, Toto members have been a part of at least one of the R&R HOF inductees music for the past three decades.\n\nHere's the list of Toto's guest artist:\n\nLenny Castro\n\nCheryl Lynn\n\nJim Horn\n\nJames Pankow\n\nJerry Hey\n\nGary Grant\n\nJames Newton Howard\n\nTimothy B. Schmit\n\nTom Kelly\n\nChuck Findley\n\nRichard Page\n\nSteve George\n\nLarry Williams\n\nDavid Sanborn\n\nBill Reichenbach Jr.\n\nDon Henley\n\nPatti Austin\n\nJon Anderson\n\nBill Payne\n\nAndy Narell\n\nGary Herbig\n\nBobby Womack\n\nJohn Fogerty\n\nClint Black\n\nMichael Boddicker\n\nBrandon Fields\n\nWalt Fowler\n\nJames Ingram\n\nDavey Johnstone\n\nNigel Olsson\n\nVinnie Colaiuta\n\nTom Scott\n\nMichael McDonald\n\nMiles Davis\n\nDavid Lindlay\n\nLinda Ronstadt\n\nIan Anderson\n\nJason Scheff\n\nand the London Symphony Orchestra\n\nPosted by Evil on Monday, 11/21/2022 @ 18:11pm"
