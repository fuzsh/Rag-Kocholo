        "text": "Umm. no. Its not just based on sales... its based on the huge impact it had on the United States and even the world. On society, on culture, on race relations..\n\nAs a 11/12 year old white kid at the time of Thriller's release I can tell you that Michael Jackson (and the Cosby show subsequently) did more to foster a color blind attitude to people than just about anything else. I think we take that attitude for granted these days but it was not always so. And for about a year or two during Thriller's reign Michael Jackson was IT.\n\nThriller did not sell 30 million copies in the US because people bought it even though it was crap.. its a masterpiece, partly, because of the great musicians, including Porcaro and of course Quincy Jones, that helped Michael Jackson create it.\n\nYou can't compare the seminal moment that was Thriller to anything else. A complete quality product from beginning to end including of course the John Landis video.\n\nI did not vote since many great albums were left out:\n\nSeals & Crofts - Unborn Child (1974)\n\nTommy Bolin - Teaser (1975) - tracks 1, 2, 3, 5\n\nSteely Dan - Pretzel Logic (1974), Gaucho (1980)\n\nBoz Scaggs - Down Two Then Left (1977), Middle Man (1980), Other Roads (1988)\n\nHall & Oates - Beauty on a Back Street (1977)\n\nLarry Carlton - Room 335 Album (1978)\n\nWarren Zevon - Excitable Boy (1978) - \"Nighttime in the Switching Yard\"\n\nColin Blunstone - Never Even Thought (1978)\n\nLowell George - Thanks, I'll Eat It Here (1979)\n\nPink Floyd - The Wall - \"Mother\"\n\nBee Gees - Living Eyes (1981)\n\nGreg Lake - Greg Lake (1981)\n\nMichael Jackson - Dangerous (1991) - \"Beat It\", \"Human Nature\", \"The Girl is Mine\", \"The Lady in my Life\", \"Heal the World\"\n\nElton John - Jump Up!\n\nDon Henley - I Can't Stand Still (1982)\n\nChristopher Cross - Another Page (1983)\n\nJames Newton Howard - \"James Newton Howard and Friends\" (1983)\n\nMichael McDonald - If That's What It Takes (1982) - No Lookin' Back (1985) - \"Take It To Heart\" (1990)\n\nEric Clapton - Behind the Sun (1985) - Forever Man\n\nJon Anderson - In the City of Angels (1988)\n\nClair Marlo - Let It Go (1989)\n\nMadonna - Like a Prayer (1989)\n\nTwenty Mondays - The Twist Inside (1990)\n\nMichael Bolton - Time, Love & Tenderness (1991)\n\nCher - Love Hurts (1991)\n\nDire Straits - On Every Street (1991)\n\nBruce Springsteen - Human Touch (1992)\n\nChristopher Cross - Rendezvous (1992)\n\n10cc - ...Meanwhile (1992)\n\nTHIS\n\nAnd im a HUGE Steely Dan fan. I own all of their albums. Thriller was a landmark, it wasn't some passing fad like Vanilla Ice or Milli Vanilli. It was acclaimed because it was a benchmark of music. You have the legendary Quincy Jones, MJ: one of the greatest artist in his absolute prime who was singing like his head was about to explode and the greatest collection of writers and studio musicians ever assembled. Eddie Van Halen, Louis Johnson, Toto, Greg Philliganes, Janet Jackson, Michael Boddicker, Macca!!\n\nPerhaps the OP should have worded his question a bit differently, like \"Your favorite album Jeff Procaro was associated with\", because, otherwise, there's just no point in doing the poll. There is no debate on \"Thriller\" being the \"greatest\" in terms of sales and popularity. Period."
