        "text": "Earlier today, the Harry Potter Film Twitter directed us to the Fantastic Beasts Youtube channel to watch the ‘fantastic’ composer of Fantastic Beasts throw out a few bars from the soundtrack of the film.\n\nHe will perform with the Czech National Symphony Orchestra at Karlovy Film Festival on 30th June 2017. He will be honoured with a well deserved Crystal Globe for Outstanding Contribution to World Cinema.\n\nIn Howard’s vlog, he describes putting together a suite (an ordered set of orchestral pieces) for the honour of being a guest at the festival, where he will premiere the suite. He’s basically sticking together his favourite tunes from the film, and it’s a privilege to watch such a brilliant artist at work. He samples a few tracks in the video on his trusty keyboard and explains his thoughts on them – it’s beautiful! Watch the video below:\n\nLeaky had the opportunity to interview Howard at the London premiere of the first Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, where he described the difference in style of composure between the Potter films and J.K. Rowling’s new venture. He explained the importance of 1920s music to his style, the characters and – of course – the plot. See more in our live streamed interviews from the (blue) carpet below:"
