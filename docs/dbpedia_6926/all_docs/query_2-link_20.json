It both movedand appealed me and the pictures just wouldn't leave my head. I tried to imagine how I'd feel about if I was there and what I'd do\".\n\nJeff Porcaro about Africa.\n\n\"A white boy is trying to write a song on Africa, but since he'd never been there. he can only tell what he's seen on TV or remembers in the past. Geographically it doesn't make sence ... the Kilimanjaro isn't near the river named in the song\".\n\nAlthough Africa is one of TOTO's biggest hits ever, it almost didn't get it to the album. TOTO had worked with the song for a very long time and was so tired on it that they almost skipped the song when compiling the album.\n\nLiner notes to the song on TOTO XX (1977 - 1997).\n\n\"The reason why cuts 11, 12 and 13 are included with this other material is that we wanted to offer something special from our recent trip to South Africa. This was the first time we had played there so we decided to create something new of something old. Thus we added \"Baba Mnumzane\" to the fornt of \"Africa\" as an intro with a traditional 7-piece South African choir. To augment that Simon recruited 5 local percussionists and rehearsed the day of the show, some newly written parts for them to play. At this point there were 18 musicians on stage bringing them and us together for a memorable event that we felt we should include here\".\n\nAfter You've Gone\n\nTaken from the album: Mindfields (1999).\n\nWritten by: Steve Lukather & Phil Soussan.\n\nLead vocals: Steve Lukather.\n\nBacking vocals: Steve Lukather, Phil Soussan, Mark Hudson & Timothy B.

He explains: \"I wrote the progression and groove one night in the summer of 1987. It wasn't really any kind of inspired or conscious effort, it just came out. My brother Joseph came home from a sesion for 'The Seventh One' and told me he thought the song would be something good for the record. That was funny to me because the original working title on the sequencer disk was 'Something Good'. He took a cassette to the studio the next day and played it for Jeffrey Porcaro, who loved it and said: 'We've got to have this thing'. I then finished the music with Joseph. David Paich and Joseph wrote most of the lyrics\".\n\nBaba Mnumzane\n\nTaken from the album: TOTO XX 1977 - 1997 (1998).\n\nWritten by: traditional, L. Mkhize & M.

I saw Luke play it in high school with Landau and Steve P. They nailed it just like Denny and Skunk. We used a few subsitutions on the ending chords. Donald and Walter will probably give it a 6. (Toto99.com, 2002).\n\nSteve Lukather about Bodhisattva:\n\n\"When we were in high school, we were basically a Steely Dan tribute band. It was me and Landau on guitar, Carlos Vega on drums, Steve Porcaro on keyboards. Jeff Porcaro was the drummer in Steely Dan at the time and so we were obsessed With learning the whole of the Katy lied album before it came out, and Bodhisattva ended up opening our set. It's also a bit of a tribute to Jeff as well - it's 10 years since he died. Steely were really important to us as kids. They were what we wanted to be like. They were very melodic and they had some great guitar solos. We reharmonised some of the chords so it's not an exact copy, but it's enough of a nod to Jeff Baxter and Denny Dias... those guys are my friends.\" (Steve Lukather, Guitarist - March 2003)\n\nBurn Down The Mission\n\nTaken from the album: Through The Looking Glass (2002).\n\nWritten by: Elton John & Bernie Taupin.\n\nOriginal performers: Elton John.\n\nLead vocals: Bobby Kimball.\n\nBacking vocals: Steve Lukather, Bobby Kimball, Davey Johnstone & Nigel Ollson.\n\nKeyboards & Piano: David Paich.\n\nGuitars: Steve Lukather.\n\nBass: Mike Porcaro.\n\nDrums: Simon Phillips.\n\nSynth programming: Steve Porcaro.\n\nCongas, Tambourine: Lenny Castro.\n\nBeing a true Elton disciple David first performed this at his highschool graduation (all boys Catholic prep).

Bobby chose this song and really does justice to it (boy it'shard to improve on any of these damn tunes!) (Toto99.com, 2002)\n\nSteve Lukather about Burn Down The Mission:\n\n\"This wasn 't on our list, but Kimball sat down at the piano one day and started doing it. And it was amazing. We all went, We've gotta cut that now! And we did and it was a blast. That one pays more of a nod to the original than a lot of the other songs.

She's got a really eclectic collection and I said to her that I'd love to do a Bob Marley track and she said, What about Could you be loved? So we went in and did it and then Paich said he'd like to stick a rap section in there. Now, I just can't relate to rap music. Okay, it's a great groove and all that, but I can't get into it. Anyway, he got this Jamaican guy, Tippa Irie, to come in and do this rap while I was away with Simon in our Mahavishnu band. It's kinda stepping over the edge for us but, who knows, we might even get a couple of plays on the radio because of it.

I started playing this riff and I just couldn't stop playing it. I played it for days, and I started singing, \"Hold the line, love isn't always on time.\" It was a phrase that just came into my head. . . . it was a blessing. (The words) came to me in the night, and then I went to the verse. I wrote it in 2 hours. Sometimes songs come quickly like that, and sometimes I spend 2 years trying to finish a song\".\n\nJeff Porcaro about Hold The Line (2):\n\n\"That was me trying to play like Sly Stone's original drummer, Greg Errico, who played drums on \"Hot Fun In The Summertime.\" The hi-hat is doing triplets, the snare drum is playing 2 and 4 backbeats, and the bass drum is on 1 and the & of 2. That 8th note on the second beat is an 8th-note triplet feel, pushed. When we did the tune, I said, \"Gee, this is going to be a heavy four-on-the-floor rocker, but we want a Sly groove.\" The triplet groove of the tune was David's writing. It was taking the Sly groove and meshing it with a harder rock caveman approach\". (Modern Drummer 1988).\n\nSteve Lukather about Hold The Line:\n\n\"I flipped the first time I heard myself on the radio. My mom called me up and said, \"Turn on KLOS.\" It was the song \"Hold the Line,\" and I started running around the house in my underwear, screaming, \"I'm on the radio!\" My wife was cracking up. It was just a thrill\". (Guitar Player magazine, April 1984).\n\nBobby Kimball about Hold The Line:\n\n\"I was asleep, I had my alarm clock set for noon because we were gonna do something in the studio, some promo and when the alarm came on there was the radio and \"Hold The Line\" was playing. And my room was totally black and I was looking for the telephone and I called Paich and I heard him scream, he was living over there with his girlfriend and he was screaming around and falling over trying to get to the radio\". (TOTO99, 2002).\n\nSteve Lukather about Hold The Line (2):\n\n\"I remember one of you guys called me.

Bobby Kimball is from New Orleans and the first time we jammed it was when we were doing a show down there. Paich, just for a joke really, started playing it in the soundcheck and Kimball started singing. Now that wasn't the arrangement that ended up on the record, but it gave us the idea to do the song. I said, Why don't we take the Dave Gilmour approach to it? So then we changed the chords around and our version came out sounding a little bit psychedelic. Dave Gilmour is one of those few guitarists whose name typifies an actual style of playing. I've copped a lot of stuff off Dave and he's a friend.\" (Guitarist - March 2003).\n\nHow Does It Feel\n\nTaken from the album: Isolation (1984).\n\nWritten by: Steve Lukather.\n\nLead vocals: Steve Lukather.\n\nBacking vocals: Tom Kelly & Richard Page.\n\nGuitars: Steve Lukather.\n\nKeyboards: David Paich.\n\nDrums & Percussion: Jeff Porcaro.\n\nBass: Mike Porcaro.\n\nKeyboards: Steve Porcaro.\n\nOrchestral arrangements: James Newton Howard & David Paich.\n\nConductedby: Marty Paich & James Newton Howard.\n\nPerformed by: The London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nProduced by TOTO.\n\nMixed by Greg Ladanyi & TOTO.\n\nEngineerd by Greg Ladanyi, Tom Knox, Shep Lonsdale & Niko Bolas.\n\nAssistent Engineers: Richard Bosworth, Duane Seykora, Tom Fletcher, Bill Jackson, Terry Christian, Peggy McCreary, Stuart Furusho, David Schober, Brian Malouf, Ann Calnan & Franz Pusch.\n\nStrings Engineerd by John Kurlander at Abbey Road Studios, London, England.\n\nAdditional Recording at Sunset Sound, Bill Schnee Studio & Can Am Recorders.\n\nMastered at The Mastering Lab by Doug Sax.\n\nDirection Production Coordinator: Ivy Skoff.\n\nHow Does It Feel was in 1984 released as the third single from the album Isolation after Stranger In Town & Holyanna.\n\nSingle - A6043 (UK version) + Columbia 38-04844 (USA version) - How Does It Feel / Mr. Friendly (1984).\n\nIt is also included on the compilation albums: A Rock and Roll Band (July 1990), Africa (April 2003) & The Essential (2004).\n\nHow Many Times\n\nTaken from the album: Kingdom Of Desire (1992).\n\nWritten by: TOTO.\n\nLead vocals: Steve Lukather.\n\nBacking vocals: Richard Page & Steven George.\n\nBass: Mike Porcaro.\n\nGuitars: Steve Lukather.\n\nKeyboards: David Paich.\n\nDrums & Percussion: Jeff Porcaro.\n\nRecorded by Greg Ladanyi at Skywalker Studios, San Rafael, California, February 25, 1991.\n\nProduced by TOTO.\n\nMixed by Bob Clearmountain at A&M Studios and Record Plant Studios.\n\nEngineerd by Greg Ladanyi, Niko Bolas , Jess Sutcliffe & John Jessel.\n\nIt is also on the singles 2 Hearts and The Other Side from the album Kingdom Of Desire.\n\nCD single - Columbia 658947 1 - 2 Hearts / How Many Times (1992).\n\nCD maxi-single - Columbia 658947 2 - 2 Hearts / How Many Times / Never Enough (1992).\n\nCD single - Columbia 659040 1 - The Other Side / How Many Times (1992).\n\nHydra\n\nTaken from the album: Hydra (1979).\n\nWritten by: David Paich, Steve Porcaro, Jeffrey Porcaro, Steve Lukather, Bobby Kimball & David Hungate.\n\nLead vocals: David Paich.\n\nBass: David Hungate.\n\nGuitars: Steve Lukather.\n\nKeyboards: David Paich.\n\nDrums & Percussion: Jeffrey Porcaro.\n\nKeyboards: Steve Porcaro.\n\nHydra is also on the singles 99 and All Us Boys from the second album Hydra.\n\nSingle - CBS 8132 (Dutch version) / Columbia 1-11173 (USA version) - 99 / Hydra (1980).\n\nSingle - ??? - All Us Boys / Hydra (1980).\n\nThis is the first song in which all TOTO members participated in the songwriting, and only song in which David Hungate participate in the songwriting.\n\nDuring the production of the video Steve Porcaro - who played the lead role - was injured on a fall.\n\nTogether with the new version of the operating sysytem Microsoft Windows NT 5.0 a concept called Windows NT \"Hydra\" (!) is included, which makes it possible to run 32-bits Windows application on all network systems.\n\nA live version of Hydra recorded during the Kingdom Of Desire Worldtour in 1992 is on the live album Absolutely Live (1993).\n\nI Can't Get Next To You\n\nTaken from the album: Through The Looking Glass (2002)\n\nWriters: Barret Strong & Norman Whitfield.\n\nOriginal performers: Al Green.\n\nArranged by: David Paich, Steve Lukather, Michael Porcaro, Bobby Kimball & Simon Phillips.\n\nLead vocals: Bobby Kimball.\n\nBacking vocals: James Ingram & TOTO.\n\nKeyboards: David Paich.\n\nGuitars: Steve Lukather.\n\nBass: Mike Porcaro.\n\nDrums & Tambourine: Simon Phillips.\n\nAd Libs: James Ingram.\n\nTenor Sax: Brandon Fields.\n\nTrumpet: Walt Fowler.\n\nA live version of I Can't get Next To You recorded during the 25th Anniversary Worldtour in 2003 is on the live album and dvd Live In Amsterdam (2003).\n\n\"When Al Green's Greatest Hits came out, his version of the old Temp's record killed us.

That's the reason why the other bandmembers has tried to remove it before the release of the album Kingdom Of Desire after Jeff's death. Unfortunately something went wrong and the song is included in some of the versions of the album.\n\nFrom the album Kingdom Of Desire are 3 different versions:\n\n1. without Kick Down The Walls.\n\n2. with Kick Down The Walls.\n\n3. with Kick Down The Walls & Little Wing (live in Paris in October 1990).\n\nSteve Lukather about Kick Down The Walls and working together Danny Kortchmar writing and producing the song:\n\n\"I've known Danny for a long time. He always said to me \"why are you doing something that you don't want to do?\". One day, Jeff came to the rest of the band saying \"this is a song we must do!\" and he made us listen to \"kick down the walls\". The original version was more rough, but we made it into our own version. The song is interesting in the sense that it was written about the streets of L.A., and it was written even before the L.A. riot. My house is on the hill, so I remember \"overseeing\" the fire and the riot from high above.....\"\n\n\"for this song, Danny himself came to us and said he wanted to produce it, so we had him produce the song. That's why it sounds different from the rest of the album. For me, it's a song that I like the least...but that's a secret to danny (laughs)\".\n\nKingdom Of Desire\n\nTaken from the album: Kingdom Of Desire (1992).\n\nWritten by: Danny Kortchmar.\n\nLead vocals: Steve Lukather.\n\nBacking vocals: Jenny Douglas-McRae, Jacky McGhee, Philip Ingram, Arnold McCuller, Kevin Dorsey, Alex Brown & Phil Perry.\n\nBass: Mike Porcaro.\n\nGuitars: Steve Lukather.\n\nKeyboards: David Paich.\n\nDrums & Percussion: Jeff Porcaro.\n\nRecorded by Niko Bolas at Schnee Studio, North Hollywood, California, May 1, 1991.\n\nProduced by TOTO.\n\nMixed by Bob Clearmountain at A&M Studios and Record Plant Studios.\n\nEngineerd by Greg Ladanyi, Niko Bolas , Jess Sutcliffe & John Jessel.\n\nIt is the title track of the album Kingdom Of Desire.\n\nTogether with Kick Down The Walls is Kingdom Of Desire the only song from TOTO in which no bandmember has participated in the songwriting.

In 1989 TOTO tried to re-unit with Bobby Kimball again for the recording of some new songs for the greatest hits album Past To Present. They recorded only one song with him, because there were still personel problems playing at that time. Goin' Home didn't appear on the album Past To Present and it had to wait 8 years on a shelf before it was released on the album TOTO XX 1977 - 1997.\n\nLiner notes to the song on TOTO XX 1977 - 1997.\n\n\"This song was nixed after JP's \"Spiral Staircase\" comment.

Part of the reason I don't think I had so many songs on Toto records is because I always felt like I had to sing my songs. Lukather was too Lukather and Paich was Paich, and the lead singer had too many chops.\n\nBut with Joseph, I had a guy who could sing \"Lea!\" I had done a vocal on \"Lea\" and it was excruciating, painful! I was in the studio and it was a nightmare. But I finally did it, and we were gonna put it on the record. Then Joseph came in the band and I had him listen to the way I did the song and I said, \"Okay now, you try it.\" He went in there and he nailed it for me. I was so thankful that we finally had a lead singer who could sing my songs\".\n\nLeto's Theme\n\nTaken from the albums: Original Soundtrack Recording Dune (1984) & Original Motion Picture Score Dune (1997).\n\nWritten by: TOTO.\n\nInstrumental song from soundtrack Dune.\n\nKeyboards: David Paich.\n\nDrums & Percussion: Jeff Porcaro.\n\nKeyboards: Steve Porcaro.\n\nElectric Bass, Accoustic Bass & Percussion: Mike Porcaro.\n\nGuitars: Steve Lukather.\n\nPercussion: Joe Porcaro, Emil Richards & Robert Zimmitti (as additional muscians).\n\nLion\n\nTaken from the album: Isolation (1984).\n\nWritten by: David Paich & Bobby Kimball.\n\nLead vocals: Fergie Frederiksen.\n\nGuitars: Steve Lukather.\n\nKeyboards: David Paich.\n\nDrums & Percussion: Jeff Porcaro.\n\nBass: Mike Porcaro.\n\nKeyboards: Steve Porcaro.\n\nProduced by TOTO.\n\nMixed by Greg Ladanyi & TOTO.\n\nEngineerd by Greg Ladanyi, Tom Knox, Shep Lonsdale & Niko Bolas.\n\nAssistent Engineers: Richard Bosworth, Duane Seykora, Tom Fletcher, Bill Jackson, Terry Christian, Peggy McCreary, Stuart Furusho, David Schober, Brian Malouf, Ann Calnan & Franz Pusch.\n\nStrings Engineerd by John Kurlander at Abbey Road Studios, London, England.\n\nAdditional Recording at Sunset Sound, Bill Schnee Studio & Can Am Recorders.\n\nMastered at The Mastering Lab by Doug Sax.\n\nDirection Production Coordinator: Ivy Skoff.\n\nLion is the last song in which Bobby Kimball has participated in the songwriting before he left TOTO.\n\nWhen you listen to Lion you can hear a weird sound, just before the second verse begins at 1:20. There are many explainations for this weird sound: is it a backward message (\"huntress\" or \"satan\") or just a simple sound effect. When Fergie Frederiksen was asked about this he denied that the song had a backward message in it.\n\nLion is also included on the compilation album A Rock and Roll Band (July 1990).\n\nLittle Wing\n\nTaken from the album: Kingdom Of Desire (Japanese version) (1992).\n\nWritten by: Jimi Hendrix.\n\nOriginal performer: Jimi Hendrix.\n\nLead vocals: Steve Lukather.\n\nDrums: Jeff Porcaro.\n\nGuitar: Steve Lukather.\n\nKeyboards: David Paich.\n\nBass: Mike Porcaro.\n\nPercussion: Chris Trujillo.\n\nLittle Wing is a bonustrack on Japanese version of the album Kingdom Of Desire.\n\nIt is live recorded in October 1990 in Paris.

Stevie Wonder (very large!) It was a sizeable challenge to attempt but we cut it early in the game. Luke's nin-like intro gave it the urgency it deserved. We recruited Ellis Hall for some step outs. This is dedicated to the FDNY and all New York.\" (Toto99.com, 2002)\n\nSteve Lukather about Living For The City:\n\n\"I used to live, eat and sleep Stevie Wonder. He's played live with us too! We were playing at the Budokan in Japan and I was playing this solo and all of a sudden the crowd goes apeshit and I'm thinking, Wow man, I'm tearing this place up! Then I look behind me and there's Stevie, who's just walked on. He was amazing. I listen to all his stuff, but especially Innervisions and Talking book. For our tribute to Stevie we decided to do it a bit differently, by featuring the guitar instead of the Fender Rhodes. We actually called him and asked if he'd like to play on it, but unfortunately he was out of town.\" (Steve Lukather, Guitarist - March 2003)\n\nLorraine\n\nTaken from the album: Hydra (1979).\n\nWritten by: David Paich.\n\nLead vocals: Steve Lukather.\n\nBass: David Hungate.\n\nGuitars: Steve Lukather.\n\nKeyboards: David Paich.\n\nDrums & Percussion: Jeffrey Porcaro.\n\nKeyboards: Steve Porcaro.\n\nDavid Paich wrote this song as a dedication to his wife Lorraine.\n\nLorraine is also included on the compilation album A Rock and Roll Band (July 1990).\n\nLove Has The Power\n\nTaken from the album: Past To Present 1977 - 1990 (1990).\n\nWritten by: Jean-Michel Byron & John Capek.\n\nLead vocals: Jean-Michel Byron.\n\nDrums & Percussion: Jeff Porcaro.\n\nKeyboards: David Paich.\n\nGuitars: Steve Lukather.\n\nBass: Michael Porcaro.\n\nChoir: Susan Boyd, Alfie Silas, Alex Brown, Lynn Davis, Carmen Twillie, Maxime Waters, Debbie Hall, Phyllis St. James, John Bahler, Gene Morford, Kevin Dorsey, Willie Green, Phillip Ingram, Oren Waters, Luther Waters & Darryl Phinnessee.\n\nRecorded & mixed by James Guthrie, assisted by Michael Reiter & Ken Allardyce at Bearsville Studios, Bearsville, New York (1990) & Schnee Studio, North Hollywood, California (1990).\n\nProduced by James Guthrie & TOTO.\n\nLove Has The Power is together with Can You Hear What I'm Saying dedicated to Dr. Nelson Mandela and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. May your legacy live forever and may we fulfill \"the Dream\".\n\nLove Has The Power is released as the first single from the album Past To Present 1977 - 1990, and it reached to # 22 in The Netherlands.\n\nCD single - CBS 656066 3 - Love Has The Power / The Seventh One / Can You Hear What I'm Saying (1990).\n\nLove Has The Power is also on the compilation album Greatest Hits ... and More (December 2002).\n\nLove Is A Man's World\n\nTaken from the album: TOTO XX 1977 - 1997 (1998).\n\nWritten by: David Paich.\n\nLead vocals: David Paich.\n\nDisco backing vocals: Bobby Kimball.\n\nDrums & Percussion: Jeff Porcaro.\n\nMoog bass, Piano & Synths: David Paich.\n\nGuitar: Steve Lukather.\n\nSequencer & Programming: Steve Porcaro.\n\nSynth programming: Michael Boddicker.\n\nRecorded & mixed by Tom Knox at Daclen and Studio 55 in 1977.\n\nLiner notes to the song on TOTO XX 1977 - 1997.\n\n\"The next two songs (Miss Sun & Love Is A Man's World) here are our original demos to get our record deal.
