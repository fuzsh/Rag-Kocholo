        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfessions Composer , Singer , Composer of the original score more\n\nNationality American\n\nBirth June 9, 1951 (Los Angeles, California – United States)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nInspired by his grandmother, a violinist with the Pittsburgh Symphony in the 1930s and 1940s, James Howard (he took the name James Newton Howard during the 1970s to distinguish himself from his namesake, also a musician) introduced to music at a very young age, particularly the piano. He continued on this path during his studies, and graduated from the Music Academy of the West and the University of Southern California School of Music . At the beginning of the 1970s, however, he moved away from classical and symphonic music towards a career in rock and pop. He thus became keyboardist for the group Mama Lion, then collaborated, among others, with Neil Diamond , Ringo Starr , Diana Ross , Barbra Streisand , Eric Clapton , Ringo Starr , Rod Stewart , and the groups China and Toto. In 1975 he also became one of Elton John ‘s regular musicians , with whom he worked on seven albums and several tours until 1986.\n\nAfter a first experience in 1983 as keyboard on the score of The Fourth Dimension by Jerry Goldsmith , James Newton Howard converted to film music. In 1985, he signed his first composition with the soundtrack for the comedy Head Office . He then multiplied the BOFs until 1990, without however imposing his “paw”, notably signing the music for Eight million ways to die and Nobody’s fool , carried by his wife (from 1986 to 1987) Rosanna Arquette . In 1990, James Newton Howard was entrusted with the soundtrack for Pretty Woman , which earned him a BMI Film Music Award and revealed his talents as a composer. On The Forbidden Experience (1991) , he then crossed paths with Joel Schumacher , who became one of his favorite directors and with whom he collaborated on The Choice to Love (always with Julia Roberts ), and Free Fall .\n\nThroughout the 90s, the musician, recognized for his work on the keyboard and strings and his ability to offer ever more varied compositions, established other great collaborations, notably with Michael Hoffman (Some girls , Promised Land , Le Don du King , One Beautiful Day , The Emperors Club ), Irwin Winkler ( The Black List ,Night’s Law ), Andrew Davis ( Operation Twilight , The Fugitive , Perfect Murder ), Lawrence Kasdan ( Grand Canyon , Wyatt Earp , French Kiss , Mumford , Dreamcatcher ), Kevin Costner ( Waterworld , Wyatt Earp , Postman ), PJ Hogan ( My Best Friend’s Wedding , Suspicious Love , Peter Pan ), Ivan Reitman ( President for a Day , Junior , Father’s Day ), Disney ( Dinosaur , Atlantis , Treasure Planet ) and Barbra Streisand who gave him his first Oscar nomination with The Prince of Tides . James Newton Howard’s most successful collaboration, however, did not see the light of day until 1999, when M. Night Shyamalan entrusted him with the responsibility of orchestrating his Sixth Sense . This will be followed by Unbreakable (2000), Signes (2003), The Village (2004) and The Water Maiden (2006).\n\nJames Newton Howard also works for the small screen and, in addition to a few TV films, signs the credits for the series Urgences , La Sentinelle and Gideon’s Crossing (winning an Emmy Award)."
