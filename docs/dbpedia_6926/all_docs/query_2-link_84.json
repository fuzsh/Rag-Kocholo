        "text": "Tag: Toto\n\nFahrenheit is the sixth studio album by Toto, released August 22, 1986. It was their first album to feature Joseph Williams on lead vocals. Former lead singer Fergie Frederiksen was fired due to problems with his ability in the studio. However, he sings backing vocals on the song “Could This Be Love”. It was also the last Toto album until Toto XIV in 2015 to feature keyboardist Steve Porcaro as a permanent member, as he left after the Fahrenheit tour. The album failed to go gold until 1994, but featured two top forty singles in “I’ll Be Over You” (#11, #13 Can.) and “Without Your Love” (#38, #77 Can.). “I’ll Be Over You” featured Michael McDonald on backing vocals, who also made an appearance in the song’s music video.

On June 15, 2024, it was announced that Dennis Atlas was the new 2nd keyboardist for their upcoming tours, replacing keyboardist and vocalist Steve Maggiora.\n\nSteve Lukather – guitar, lead and backing vocals, bass guitar (1977–2008, 2010–2019, 2020–present)\n\nDavid Paich – keyboards, lead and backing vocals (1977–2008, 2010–2019, 2020–present; inactive from touring with occasional special appearances 2005–2008, 2018–2019, 2020–present)\n\nJoseph Williams – lead and backing vocals, additional keyboards (1986–1988, 2010–2019, 2020–present)\n\nWarren Ham – saxophone, harmonica, flute, backing and occasional lead vocals, percussion (1986–1988, 2017–2019, 2020–present)\n\nGreg Phillinganes – keyboards, backing and occasional lead vocals (2003-2005, 2024–present; official member 2005-2008; sub-2022)\n\nShannon Forrest – drums, percussion (2014-2019, 2024–present)\n\nJohn Pierce – bass (2020–present)\n\nDennis Atlas – keyboards, backing vocals (2024–present)\n\nToto IV is the fourth studio album by American pop and rock band Toto released on April 8, 1982 by Columbia Records.\n\nThe lead single, “Rosanna”, peaked at number 2 for five weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, while the album’s third single, “Africa”, topping the Hot 100 chart, became the group’s first and only number 1 hit. Both songs were hits in the UK as well, reaching number 12 and 3, respectively. The fourth single, “I Won’t Hold You Back”, also peaked within the top ten on the Hot 100, at number 10, but atop the Billboard Adult Contemporary charts for three weeks. It also went into the top 40 in the UK. With the success of “Africa”, the album climbed back into the top 10 in early 1983 on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nToto IV received six Grammy Awards in 1983 including Album of the Year, Producer of the Year for the band, and Record of the Year for “Rosanna”. It reached number four on the Billboard 200 album charts in the United States, shortly after its release. It also reached the top ten in other countries, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Japan. It was also the last Toto album to feature their original bassist David Hungate until his return in 2014 (with the release of their 2015 album Toto XIV) when he replaced by Mike Porcaro after the band’s recording of the album, and also the final album to feature original lead vocalist Bobby Kimball until his comeback in 1998 (with the release of the 1999 album Mindfields).\n\n1. “Rosanna” 5:31\n\n2. “Make Believe” 3:43\n\n3. “I Won’t Hold You Back” 4:53\n\n4. “Good for You” 3:17\n\n5. “It’s a Feeling” 3:05\n\n6. “Afraid of Love” 3:52\n\n7. “Lovers in the Night” 4:25\n\n8. “We Made It” 3:56\n\n9. “Waiting for Your Love” 4:12\n\n10. “Africa” 4:55\n\nBobby Kimball – lead vocals (tracks 1, 2, 4, 8-10), backing vocals (tracks 1, 2, 4, 6-10)\n\nSteve Lukather – guitars, lead vocals (tracks 1, 3, 6), backing vocals (tracks 1-4, 6-10), piano (track 4)\n\nDavid Paich – keyboards, lead vocals (tracks 7, 10), backing vocals (tracks 1, 2, 5-10), orchestral arrangements (tracks 3, 5-7), horn arrangements (track 1)\n\nSteve Porcaro – keyboards, lead vocals (track 5)\n\nDavid Hungate – bass guitar\n\nJeff Porcaro – drums, percussion\n\nLenny Castro – congas and percussion (tracks 1, 4, 5, 7, 10)\n\nRalph Dyck – synthesizer (track 7)\n\nGary Grant – trumpet (track 1)\n\nJerry Hey – trumpet and horn arrangements (track 1)\n\nJim Horn – saxophone (tracks 1, 7), recorders (track 10)\n\nJames Newton Howard – orchestral arrangements and conductor (tracks 3, 5-7)\n\nTom Kelly – backing vocals (tracks 1, 2)\n\nRoger Linn – synthesizer programming (track 4)\n\nThe Martyn Ford Orchestra – strings (tracks 3, 5-7)\n\nMarty Paich – orchestral arrangements (track 3)\n\nJimmy Pankow – trombone (track 1)\n\nJoe Porcaro – percussion (tracks 5, 10), xylophone (track 6), tympani (track 7), marimba (track 10)\n\nMike Porcaro – cello (tracks 3, 8)\n\nTimothy B.

Although it yielded the band’s first top-ten hit in Japan and steady sales in that country, the album was a commercial disappointment elsewhere, failing to produce any charting singles and selling approximately 900,000 copies worldwide.\n\nLukather said in 2013 that it was the band’s “fuck you record”. He further said:\n\n“We wanted to prove we were an arena rock band. It’s probably the weirdest record we’ve done, certainly sonically, but we were really proud of it when it came out. It didn’t really catch on — over the years, it’s sold, and now it’s kind of a cult favorite with fans, but at the time it was kind of a stiff. And then we panicked — we never even went on the road for that one. The record company was like, “Okay, guys. We let you do what you want to do. Are you gonna give us a hit record? Because if you don’t, we’re gonna drop you.”\n\n“Gift with a Golden Gun” 4:00\n\n“English Eyes” 6:11\n\n“Live for Today” 4:00\n\n“A Million Miles Away” 4:26\n\n“Goodbye Elenore” 4:52\n\n“I Think I Could Stand You Forever” 5:25\n\n“Turn Back” 3:58\n\n“If It’s the Last Night” 4:28\n\nBobby Kimball – lead vocals (tracks 1, 2, 4, 5, 7), backing vocals\n\nSteve Lukather – guitars, lead vocals (tracks 3, 5, 6, 8), backing vocals\n\nDavid Paich – keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals\n\nSteve Porcaro – keyboards, electronics\n\nDavid Hungate – bass guitar, acoustic guitar on “I Think I Could Stand You Forever”\n\nJeff Porcaro – drums, percussion\n\nJoe Porcaro – additional percussion on “If It’s the Last Night”\n\nToto is the debut studio album by American rock band Toto. It was released in )ctober 1978 and includes the hit singles “Hold the Line”, “I’ll Supply the Love” and “Georgy Porgy”, all three of which made it into the Top 50 in the USA. “Hold the Line” spent six weeks in the Top 10, and reached Number 14 in the UK as well. Although not initially very well received by critics, the band quickly gained a following, and the album gained a reputation for its characteristic sound, mixing soft pop with both synth- and hard-rock elements.
