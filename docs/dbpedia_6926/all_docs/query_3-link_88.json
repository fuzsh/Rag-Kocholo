        "text": "Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald was composed by Grammy and Emmy Award winner and multiple Oscar nominee James Newton Howard (Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them, The Hunger Games franchise). In addition to the film’s score, the soundtrack will treat fans to three solo piano cues not heard in the film: Dumbledore’s Theme (Solo Piano), Fantastic Beasts Theme (Solo Piano) and Leta’s Theme (Solo Piano). To work on Fantastic Beasts is a wonderful musical opportunity, describes composer James Newton Howard. The movie is delightful, substantial, and complex; and (Director David Yates) focuses very seriously on the music and is a truly passionate and enthusiastic collaborator.\n\nThe album was released digitally on November 9, a week before the film’s release. It was released on CD on November 30 2018 and on vinyl January 25 2019.\n\nListen to the soundtrack with Amazon Prime Music's 30-day Free Trial (affiliate link)\n\nAudio CD\n\nThe audio CD of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald was released on November 30 2018 by Sony Music Classical."
