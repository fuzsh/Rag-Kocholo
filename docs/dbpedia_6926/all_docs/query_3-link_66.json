It reached a peak position of number 11, and remained in the chart for 10 weeks.\n\n‘Lady Love Me (One More Time)’ was recorded at Music Grinder Studio, Los Angeles; with additional recording at United Western in Hollywood, the Hit Factory and Record Plant in New York. The main recordings for the subsequent album ‘In Your Eyes’ were undertaken at Atlantic Studios, New York.\n\nIn the UK, the single received extensive radio play in May 1983 lifting the single to the edge of the top 10. The album sold well off the back of the single’s success."
