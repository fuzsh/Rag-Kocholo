        "text": "This question bothers me: is it really true James Newton Howard played the synthesizer outro on this rare B-side? The credits for this song on To Be Continued. . . fail to mention him, hence why I ask.\n\nI know it has to be JNH because I can hear those distinctive Yamaha CS-80 brass tones a la \"Little Jeannie.\" Both songs were initially recorded in France in August 1979. JNH was still a member of Elton's band at the time.\n\nHowever, according to the same liner notes, two members of Toto contributed to this: Steve \"Luke\" Lukather on guitar and David Paich on organ. Paich has been known to play a CS-80 on some Toto songs, so rumors abound that could also be him doing the synth solo on \"The Retreat.\"\n\nI wonder if we could somehow find out via JNH himself about this?\n\n~Ben\n\nActually, it goes back farther than that the \"21 At 33\" sessions. James Newton Howard was a part of that.\n\nAs beautiful a song as \"The Retreat\" is, it does not belong on the \"Too Low For Zero\" remaster.\n\nThanks for making that clear to me! I have always thought this amazing song was from the ''Jump Up'' sessions. Now I'm not so sure it's Paich anymore. Hope someone can help out.\n\nThat may be because in the U.K. it was the B-side to \"Princess\" which was recorded during the Jump Up! sessions. We had \"The Retreat\" as a B-side as well, on the \"I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues\" single.\n\n\"The Retreat\" was intended to be released on The Fox album in 1981. About a third of the songs on that album were leftover from the 21 at 33 sessions.\n\n~Ben"
