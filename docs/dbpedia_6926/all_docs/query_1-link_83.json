        "text": "One of my first \"mockups\" was from Waterworld, which I programmed on a keyboard with 4 or 5 tracks to do so.\n\nI'm currently doing a mockup / fragment from Signs (The Hand of Fate, Part 1), which is one of my favourite in the JNH repertoire!\n\nI would think that would be a good mock up to do because that cue is comprised of a lot of short arts. I'm reading that book on SIGNS that I posted a link to earlier and the degree with which the author gets into the process of the orchestration and what Pete Anthony and Brad Dechter did transcribing Howard's MIDI mock-ups is really fascinating. Like how Anthony took the short wind figure in Hand of Fate Pt2 from a group patch and spread that figure around the solo winds to create this effect of being surrounded by that wind figure. Neat! It's a worthwhile read.\n\nOT- I also have Korngold's Aventures of Robin Hood and Danny Elfman's Batman from the same series. I highly recommend these for musicians as they are deeply analytical though I'd say the Batman one seems to spend most of its time trying to legitimize Elfman's compositional abilities... weird... I mean the guy had help for sure but all film composers do. And it bears his stylistic stamp and frankly I don't care who wrote what... it's a great score. period. Sorry, back to our regularly scheduled program...\n\nI would think that would be a good mock up to do because that cue is comprised of a lot of short arts.

It's a worthwhile read.\n\nYeah, that constant stream of pulsing instruments (short arts!) is beautiful. There's at least two harps, a piano, woodwinds coming and going and a couple of violins with plenty of double stops going all over the place, and later on strings join in on the fun. It'll be an interesting excerise to make them work together in context; horn clusters and other, long and sustained stuff and segments with big, brassy stabs.\n\nI need to check that book out!"
