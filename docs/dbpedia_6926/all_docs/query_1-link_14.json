        "text": "Today’s the day! I couldn’t be more excited to share my new album “Night After Night,” available on CD, vinyl, and streaming. This album is a revisiting of my years-long collaboration with @mnight, which resulted in some of my most treasured scores. Thank you to the team at @sonyclassical, and to the amazing Jean-Yves Thibaudet, Hilary Hahn, and Maya Beiser for their contributions. Out now!\n\nI am thrilled to share the first single from my upcoming album, “Night After Night: Music from the Movies of M. Night Shyamalan”! The album is a celebration of my many years of collaboration with Night. It will be available on October 20. For the album, I created eight suites that include new and original material. I was lucky enough to work with the pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet, and to reunite with the brilliant violinist Hilary Hahn, who returned to perform her contributions to my score for The Village. Check out Hilary’s work on “Morning,” the first single, via the link in my bio, and pre-order the album now."
