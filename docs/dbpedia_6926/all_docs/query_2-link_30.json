        "text": "Joe Porcaro (April 29, 1930—July 6, 2020) was an iconic American jazz drummer and percussionist who recorded and/or performed with various marque artists such as Natalie Cole, Don Ellis, Stan Getz, Freddie Hubbard, Gladys Knight, Madonna, The Monkees, Gerry Mulligan, Pink Floyd, Howard Roberts, Frank Sinatra, Nancy Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan. “Mr. P” also performed on more than 1,000 television and movie scores which included working with James Newton Howard, John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, James Horner, Danny Elfman, John Frizzell, as well as his own son (Steve Porcaro), just to name a few. With educator and drummer Ralph Humphrey, Joe was also one of the founders of the Los Angeles Music Academy (LAMA) in Pasadena, California (now called the Los Angeles College Of Music). Mr. Porcaro was also the patriarch of the famous Porcaro family which included his sons Jeff (1954-1992), Mike (1955-2015), as well as Steve Porcaro, the only surviving member of that iconic clan. All three sons were members of the legendary band Toto at one point with Steve being the only current member. Joe Porcaro in fact appeared on many Toto albums accompanying and performing alongside his son, the legendary Jeff Porcaro."
