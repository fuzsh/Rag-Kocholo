        "text": "Catching Fire is the audience's first time experiencing a complete score for The Hunger Games. Whether it was due time restraints or budget, Catching Fire is the score that THG aspired to be. Francis Lawrence aka Savior of Fandoms gives The Hunger Games a vision that will carry it and dedicated fans to the end of the story. We didn't know it at the time, but Francis set up the building blocks of a cohesive vision for Panem. JNH also scored Water for Elephants, so the fact that Francis and JNH work well together is likely. James Newton Howard took the core themes from the first film, reworked them, and melded them into the new themes seamlessly.\n\nKatniss\n\nCatching Fire's marketing had Native American references in them, which makes sense given the use of the Native American flute in this track. The beginning of this song I have referred to as the “District 12” theme. It's the use of flute heard here and a few other spots for the next two films. In CF, it is always being used in or around District 12. In Mockingjay Part 1, it is used for an establishing wilderness shot of District 13.\n\nI Had to Do That\n\nThis track may not seem to be one of the bigger tracks, but it's the first time we hear the theme which is probably repeated the most. I initially referred to this theme as “Katniss Ooh” (clever, right?). In fact, this is without a doubt the most important theme in the whole score collection. These “oohs” don't really show up until really important events, and it is always associated with Katniss. This, as you will see later, will be appropriately named The Mockingjay theme.\n\nJust Friends\n\nHere is the full Katniss and Peeta theme. It is heard here for the first time as it was meant to be heard, full of violins and a few other instruments. When I first saw Catching Fire, I didn't even notice this was a recall to “The Cave”. It wasn't until I did research for our site's annual score analysis that I figured it out, it was that much of a difference. Now, I adore this theme and am extremely excited to see how they will use it in Part 2.\n\nThe Tour\n\nThe beginning of this track is exactly like “Rue's Farewell”. It's when Katniss makes her speech about Rue. This scene has made me cry the hardest so far of the films. Katniss talks about remembering Rue: seeing her in the flowers that grow in the meadow, in Mockingjay song, in her sister Prim – LOOK CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE?!\n\nA Quarter Quell\n\nWhen the Quarter Quell is announced, score from “The Train” starts playing. It's a beautiful track, but it's laced with negative tones. In this version, it ends with an even more sinister tone marking the announcement of what the Quarter Quell entails. There's also some symbolism is choosing “The Train” for this event because as soon as the Quarter Quell is announced, Katniss is mentally on the train to The Capitol already.\n\nKatniss is Chosen\n\nThe Mockingjay theme comes around again for this important event – Katniss getting reaped. All of Panem is catching fire (see what I did there) and District 12 is in quiet outrage. As the Everdeen family leads everyone in a three finger salute, the score swells to a triumphant, emotional, and undying theme. The notes in that section are the very same as those “Katniss Oohs”. In this form, it becomes the major theme of the films representing the events that lead Katniss towards finally deciding to become The Mockingjay.\n\nI Need You\n\nFor the last Katniss and Peeta scene, JNH brings back the feels with “The Cave”. Audiences know it's the last real conversation they have for a long time, and it does not disappoint. The combination of Francis Lawrence's direction and James Newton Howard's beautiful composition makes this theme stick in audience's minds, so I really hope we get a recall in Mockingjay Part 2 at some point.\n\nArena Crumbles\n\nKatniss comes to and the arena is beginning to fall apart. The Mockingjay Oohs begin and the theme slowly builds until the final moment when she is being airlifted out of the arena. When the song reaches the peak of crescendo, its a huge symbol for Katniss becoming The Mockingjay. Quite literally the position Katniss is in when she's being airlifted is that of a bird in flight during the climax of the film, which is reflected in the score. Watching this scene is the reason I categorize this as the Mockingjay theme. As you'll see soon, its used a few times in Part 1 and most likely will be used at least a few times in Part 2.\n\nGood Morning Sweetheart\n\n“Entering the Capitol” gets recalled here when Katniss eventually wakes up in District 13. She feels sadness, helplessness, and then at last – anger. Using a track used to portray the foreignness of The Capitol, Katniss now sets her eyes on The Capitol with much different intentions.\n\nMOCKINGJAY PART 1\n\nThe beginning of the end.\n\nKatniss' Visit to District 12\n\nThe above title is not a track, but just a blanket title for the whole beginning of the film. Katniss visits her home and it's a terrible scene. The themes used in this section are District 12 and the Mockingjay theme. When researching for this overview of THG scores, it wasn't until seeing Mockingjay Part 1 that I concluded how JNH was using this theme. At first it started as a subtle theme for Katniss, but as the films have progressed it's gotten bigger and bigger and more symbolic.\n\nKatniss and Gale Hunt\n\nThis isn't on the track listing, but I want to point out that JNH put “Healing Katniss” in the MJ Part 1 score very briefly. Fittingly it's when Katniss and Gale hunts, which is immensely therapeutic for Katniss. I doubt that this theme will show up a third time, but it was nice to see an older piece show up in Part 1.\n\nThe Hanging Tree\n\nIf you're reading this, I'm pretty damn sure you know exactly what this song is. There was a lot of hype around it, yet fans knew little about it before seeing Part 1. The Hanging Tree fused the talents of James Newton Howard and The Lumineers and out of it came nothing but perfection in my eyes. People may disagree with me, but “The Hanging Tree” is as beautifully as it is haunting. It's a very catchy tune and mostly acapella, so it's a great song to sing by yourself. Eh? What weirdo does that?\n\nIn the books, Katniss uses The Hanging Tree to compare her relationship with Peeta and Gale. The movie, however, makes it all about Panem's rising rebel movement. Francis really hit the ball out of the park on this concept, and I am counting on it showing up again in Part 2.\n\nVictory\n\nJNH brings back some elements from “The Cave” when Katniss sees Peeta for the first time. Way to rip out our hearts, James Newton Howard! This occurs a few scenes before the piece “Victory” begins. As the film segues into what will be Mockingjay Part 2, Coin makes a speech as Katniss seeks out Peeta in the hospital. On the first viewing, I did not notice all these little score references sprinkled throughout Mockingjay Part 1. However, this next part was instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with The Hunger Games score. “Victory” goes once again into “Entering the Capitol” similarly used in Catching Fire. But as Katniss slowly approaches where Peeta is being kept, an old theme creeps in. JNH, you sneaky bastard! “Searching for Peeta”, something we've not heard for two films, shows up and closes out Part 1. Just as Katniss was tracking Peeta in the arena, she seeks him out in the hospital. I call that a zinger, if you ask me.\n\nNOVEMBER 20, 2015\n\nThere's more to come in Mockingjay Part 2! The scores for these films have finally reached a point where there's a library full of themes that can be recalled, and I can hardly wait to see what JNH has in store for Part 2. James Newton Howard has cultivated the perfect score for this franchise, and I am thankful we have had the same composer for all the films. It helps a lot with cohesion and it's allowed JNH to really develop his beautiful themes.\n\nThese are just the core themes that reappear throughout the films. Every film is full of beautiful pieces, and I encourage you to listen to them if you haven't already. You never know what themes JNH might throw in for Mockingjay Part 2. Looking back on all that James Newton Howard has scored for The Hunger Games films, we are so lucky to have had his talents for all the films and provided such amazing color with his music.
