        "text": "BRAND NEW - STILL SEALED - RECORDED LIVE DIRECT TO DISC - A SONIC MASTERPIECE!\n\nCatalog # LAB 23\n\nIf you were an audiophile in the early eighties, this LP needs no introduction. Long regarded as a sonic masterpiece, this collection of 9 tracks was recorded DIRECT TO DISC in Culver City. Featuring James Newton Howard along with half the members of Toto (David Paich, Steve Porcaro, Jeff Porcaro - plus Joe Porcaro) this is Jazz Fusion at it's finest. And the Direct To Disc recording technique produced an LP that rivals most anything recorded today.\n\nThis LP has never been opened and was very well cared for. I am anal about my LP gradings - and the only reason I don't call the cover mint is that it has a tiny 3/4\" portion at the top cover seam that is less than perfect. Any one else would consider this MINT all the way.\n\nCURRENTLY A BRAND NEW COPY OF THIS LP IS GOING FOR $179 ON AMAZON.\n\nI'm just getting back into vinyl, and the money I make from selling some of my collection will go right back into more vinyl purchases!"
