OCLC lists 14 copies worldwide. âJoel [1826-1890], who was born in Birnbaum, Poznan province, was the son of the local rabbi. He studied classics and philosophy at Berlin and obtained a doctorate at Halle. In Berlin he came under the influence of Leopold Zunz and M. Sachs. Joining the staff of the Juedisch-Theologisches Seminar in Breslau on its foundation in 1854, he taught classical languages, religious philosophy, and homiletics there. In 1864 he was appointed rabbi of the Breslau community, succeeding A. Geiger. At the rabbinical assemblies of Kassel and Leipzig, he defended moderation in Reform against Geiger's radicalism and stressed the need for preserving the Jewish character of synagogue worship and respect for the historical past. Joel's scholarly importance lies mainly in the field of religious philosophy. He wrote on Ibn Gabirol, Maimonides, Crescas, and Levi b. Gershom, investigating their Greek and Arabic sources, and their influence, in turn, on Christian scholasticism and Spinoza. â (EJ, 2007) Crescas (or Cresques, c. 1340âwinter 1410â11), was a \"Catalonian rabbi, philosopher, and statesman. Crescas was born into an old Barcelonan family of rabbis and merchants. He studied Talmud and philosophy there under Rabbi Nissim b. Reuben Gerondi (c. 1310â1376) and together with Nissim's other outstanding disciple, Rabbi Isaac b. Sheshet (1326â1408). In the 1360s, he served as one of the ne'emanim or 'secretaries' of the Jewish community. By the 1370s, he was recognized as an authority on talmudic law, was requested by King Peter IV of Aragon to adjudicate certain cases concerning Jews, and received legal queries from Jews throughout the Kingdom of Aragon and abroad. He wrote poetry, and in 1370 participated in a competition between the Hebrew poets of Barcelona and those of Gerona. With the accession in 1387 of King John I and Queen Violante, he became a familiar of the royal household. In 1389 he moved to Saragossa, seat of the main royal court, and served there as rabbi. In 1390 he was empowered by the throne as judge of all the Jews of the Kingdom of Aragon. During the anti-Jewish riots of 1391, he worked together with the king and queen to protect the Jewish communities of the kingdom, but with only partial success: hundreds of Jewish communities in Valencia, Majorca, and Catalonia were destroyed, thousands of Jews killed, and more than 100,000 were converted to Christianity; but the Jewish communities in Aragon and Roussillon were saved. Despite Crescas' efforts to have his family protected, his only son was murdered in Barcelona. Crescas prepared a Hebrew chronicle of the massacres addressed to the Jews of Avignon, dated October 19, 1391 (trans. in Fritz Kobler, Letters of the Jews through the Ages, London 1952, pp. 272â75)...In the wake of 1391, Crescas, supported by the king and queen, devoted himself to the reconstruction of the devastated Jewish communities of the Kingdom of Aragon. He also secured passage for thousands of Conversos on ships sailing for places outside Christendom, like North Africa or the Land of Israel, where they could legally return to Judaism. He made efforts to reform the system of communal representation in Saragossa, and in 1396 framed regulations (no longer extant) for the community, which strengthened the powers of its administrators\" (Warren Zev Harvey in EJ, 2007).Ex library, good+ condition.

At Harvard University he earned a bachelor's degree in 1952, a master's in 1953, and a doctorate in 1956. He became a faculty member at Harvard in 1956 as professor of Hebrew literature and philosophy, and chairman of the Department of Near Eastern Languages from 1965.

Well liked by the Jews of Prague, Eybeschuetz was a dayyan in that city, and was rabbi first of Metz and then of the \"Three Communities\" (Altona, Hamburg and Wandsbek) . His tenure as a leader was not without trouble; the Shabbateans caused him no end of difficulty.

OCLC lists 2 copies worldwide (Univ of Florida, Reconstructionist Rabbinical College) . Landau (1789-1875) was a ârabbi, author, hasidic zaddik of Poland, talmudic scholar and ascetic. His family name was originally Dobrzinsky but when he married the daughter of Dan Landau, the parnas of Polock (Polotsk) , who supported him for many years, he changed it to Landau. Abraham's mentor in Hasidism was R. Fishel of Strykow. He was an admirer of Simhah Bunim of Przysucha whom he twice visited. In 1819 Abraham was appointed rabbi of Ciechanow, where he officiated until his death. Although invited to serve as rabbi in Lodz, Lublin, and Polock he refused to leave the smaller community. From 1866 he was acknowledged as a zaddik by the Hasidim in Ciechanow, but continued to follow the Ashkenazi rite contrary to usual hasidic practice. He never followed the custom of receiving \"petitions\" or money from his followers. Abraham frequently took part in consultations over public matters of Jewish interest. In general adopting a stand of extreme conservatism, he strongly opposed the order of the Russian authorities that Jews should modify their dress. â (Alfassi, EJ) Marbles edges.

From 1990 he was also a fellow of the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem. In 1999 he was awarded the Israel Prize in Jewish thought...Idel expanded Scholem's distinction between \"theosophical\" and \"ecstatic\" forms of Kabbalah into a phenomenological distinction between two main kinds of Kabbalah. At the same time he stressed the theurgical practice attendant on theosophical discourse. In his book on Hasidism, Idel developed a \"panoramic\" account of the history of Kabbalah as the interplay of three models: theosophical, ecstatic, and magical. These models transformed the previous \"monochromatic\" picture of Kabbalah into a more complex view of tensions between schools and combinations between models, as evidenced in Idel's book on Messianism... Besides his broader contributions, Idel's writing includes many historical discoveries, such as the scope and influence of the writings of Ecstatic Kabbalist R. Abraham Abulafia, the uniqueness of the Italian kabbalists, as well as identification and dating of dozens of texts. â (EJ, 2007) Ex library, otherwise very good condition.

Epstein (1878-1952) was born in Brest-Litovsk and Vienna and Berne. In 1925 he became a professor at the then-new Hebrew University. \"He formulated the basis for a new approach to talmudic studies in which he trained generations of scholars. Early in his career Epstein devoted studies to books of the Bible and the Elephantine papyri, but the major portion of his life's work was dedicated to rabbinical literature, particularly to the Mishnah text. In the field of geonic literature, Epstein edited the geonic commentary to the sixth order of the Mishnah , the introduction to which had studies on the she'iltot of R. Aha Gaon. His contribution to the modern study of rabbinical literature was of far-reaching importance. Epstein's essays and reviews appeared in many learned periodicals, and he was cofounder and coeditor of the quarterly Devir (1923â24) , and edited the first 23 volumes of the quarterly Tarbiz (1930â52) . He was an active member of the Vaad ha-Lashon and presided over several of its committees. \" (staff, EJ) Backstrip missing, covers edgeworn, front cover detached, text clean, good condition.
