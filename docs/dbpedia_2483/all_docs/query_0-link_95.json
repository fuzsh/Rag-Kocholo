        "text": "A detailed look at Jewish life in Poland based on interviews with a broad range of Polish Jewish leaders. It highlights the &#39;multiplier effect&#39; of Jewish heritage programming, and explores the impact of the post-communist Jewish revival on Polish society as a whole. Part of a four-paper series looking at Jewish life in east-central Europe since the collapse of communism, the authors of the Poland report testify to the rebirth of a small community that has a disproportionate impact on world Jewry, not least because of the importance of Polish Jewish history and heritage. The research was conducted by local experts working in partnership with JPR, and was funded by the Rothschild Foundation (Hanadiv) Europe. A Polish language version is also available.\n\nStudents in independent Poland’s public schools attended two hours of religious instruction weekly. This article explores the role of Jewish religious instruction in the public schools and how new government requirements affected children and the development of the Jewish community. Efforts to insure that Jewish children grew up in the Jewish tradition were certainly not limited to the public schools, but it is in the public schools that we can see most clearly the conflict between the religious faith of a national minority and public institutions, which were meant to support that faith but, in the eyes of many Jewish observers, often failed to do so.\n\nAbstract: The tradition of Jewish studies in Poland has been drastically interrupted by the Second World War and the Holocaust. In the immediate postwar period the process of re-establishing research on Jewish history and heritage was undertaken by the Jewish Historical Commissions and later Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw. More examples of the individual and group initiatives can be traced only in the 1970s and 1980s. The real happened in the late 1980s with Kraków as one of the first and main centers of revitalized Jewish studies in Poland. The first postwar academic institution in Krakow specializing in Jewish studies – Research Center for Jewish History and Culture in Poland – was established already in 1986 in the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. More than a decade later, in 2000, it was transformed into the first Poland’s Department of Jewish Studies (Katedra Judaistyki) – now the Institute of Jewish Studies. Nowadays there are more similar programs and institutions – at the universities in Warsaw, Wrocław and Lublin (UMCS). Also other academic centers tend to have at least individual scholars, programs, classes or projects focusing on widely understood “Jewish topics.” Jewish studies in Poland, along with the revival of Jewish culture, reflect the contemporary Polish attitude to the Jewish heritage, and their scale and intensity remains unique in the European context. The growing interest in Jewish studies in Poland can be seen as a sign of respect for the role of Jewish Poles in the country’s history, and as an attempt to recreate the missing Jewish part of Poland through research, education and commemoration, accompanied by slow but promising revival of Jewish life in Poland.\n\nThe paper describes the wide range of educational establishments in Krakow, reflecting the diverse nature of the city's Jewish community. Despite the hostility which the community faced, in relation to education the community often had an active working relationship with the state sector, and many Jewish pupils attended non Jewish schools. The Jewish community itself was not uniform and neither, therefore were the educational establishments which served it. Furthermore, the education of Jewish pupils changed over time as the community responded to outside forces such as secularisation, Polish nationalism, Zionism and anti Semitism.\n\nThe religious life of east European Jews has naturally featured more than once on the pages of Polin. In particular, the main section of volume 11 (1998) consisted of eleven articles devoted to ‘aspects and experiences of religion’, while volume 15 (2002) contained fifteen articles dealing with ‘Jewish religious life, 1500-1900’. What these volumes presented, and even more so what they left out, reflected the state of scholarship on the subject more than two decades ago, while at the same time pointing at the direction in which it was heading. To demonstrate this, let us consider some basic facts and..."
