        "text": "Michael (Mike) Bauer, age 62, of De Pere, was called home to be with his Lord and Savior while in Jerusalem on May 31, 2016.\n\nMike was born on April 28, 1954 to Gerald and Dolores (Graf) Bauer. He first attended grade school at SS. Peter and Paul in Institute and then high school in Oneida, WI at Sacred Heart Seminary. After attending St. Norbert College, he graduated with bachelor’s degrees in Music and Psychology, and later received his master’s degree in social work from UW-Milwaukee. Mike dedicated his life to serving the needs of others, which he did first as a music teacher at Abbot Pennings High School and then as a social worker for the Green Bay Crisis Center, Jefferson Elementary School, Fort Howard Elementary School (where he started the family resource center) and Green Bay West High School. Mike finished his career at St. Norbert College as a social worker. He was a dedicated member of St. Norbert College Parish at Old St. Joseph Church.\n\nA lover of all things music, Mike was an incredibly talented flute player and singer. He was a member of both the Dudley Birder Chorale at St. Norbert College and the Old St. Joseph Parish Choir, and was involved in St. Norbert College Music Theatre. He loved to take rides in his shiny red convertible and compose music for his friends and loved ones; but most of all, was dedicated to his family. He was always there in times of need, warming hearts and putting a smile on your face. He was a true humanist, and a model Christian.\n\nSurvivors include his children: Christopher (Alexa) Bauer of Milwaukee and Katherine Bauer of De Pere; mother Dolores Bauer of Sturgeon Bay; brothers: Joseph (Terry), Anthony, Thomas (Melanie), Theodore (Sarah) and all their families; his significant other Marilyn Peters; uncles: Darrel (Sheila) Graf and Lee Graf; God-children: Brady Bauer and Mary Kate Bauer.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his father Gerald Bauer; grandparents: Theodore (Theresa) Bauer and Werner (Martha) Graf; sister-in-law Faye and nephew Danny; his favorite aunt Mary Kay Graf and many other aunts and uncles.\n\nFamily and friends may visit at St. Norbert College Parish at Old St. Joseph Church, 100 Grant Street, De Pere, on Sunday, June 12, from 3-7pm, where a parish prayer service will conclude the evening.\n\nVisitation will continue on Monday, at the church, from 9:00am until 10:45am. Mass of Resurrection will be celebrated at 11:00am Monday with Fr. Jay Fostner officiating and Deacon Gary Vanness assisting.\n\nCotter Funeral Home and Crematory of De Pere is assisting the family. Online condolences at www.cotterfuneralhome.com.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, a memorial fund is being established for the West Family Fund (make checks payable to “West High School” and send to: West High School, attn: Jim Kampa, 966 Shawano Avenue, Green Bay, WI 54303)."
