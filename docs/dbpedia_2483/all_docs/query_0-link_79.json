A-T carriers were reported to be moderately cancer-prone. A wide variety of A-T mutations, most of which are unique to single families, were identified in various ethnic groups, precluding carrier screening with mutation-specific assays. However, a single mutation was observed in 32/33 defective ATM alleles in Jewish A-T families of North African origin, coming from various regions of Morocco and Tunisia. This mutation, 103C-->T, results in a stop codon at position 35 of the ATM protein. In keeping with the nature of this mutation, various antibodies directed against the ATM protein failed to defect this protein in patient cells. A rapid carrier detection assay detected this mutation in three out of 488 ATM alleles of Jewish Moroccan or Tunisian origin. This founder effect provides a unique opportunity for population-based screening for A-T carriers in a large Jewish community.\n\nJews in America: Contributions to America, Relationship to Homeland, Integration into American Life, Retention of Ethnicity in America.

Whether inherent in the population or an artifact of marker choice, determining aspects of a population's genetic history as potential sources of substructure can aid in design of future genetic studies. Jewish populations, among which association studies are often conducted, have a known history of migrations. As a necessary step in understanding population structure to conduct valid association studies of health behaviors among Israeli Jews, we investigated genetic signatures of this history and quantified substructure to facilitate future investigations of these phenotypes in this population. Using 32 autosomal STR markers and the program STRUCTURE, we differentiated between Ashkenazi (AJ, N = 135) and non-Ashkenazi (NAJ, N = 226) Jewish populations in the form of Northern and Southern geographic genetic components (AJ north 73%, south 23%, NAJ north 33%, south 60%). The ability to detect substructure within these closely related populations using a small STR panel was contingent on including additional samples representing major continental populations in the analyses. Although clustering programs such as STRUCTURE are designed to assign proportions of ancestry to individuals without reference population information, when Jewish samples were analyzed in the absence of proxy parental populations, substructure within Jews was not detected. Generally, for samples with a given grandparental country of birth, STRUCTURE assignment values to Northern, Southern, African and Asian clusters agreed with mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosomal data from previous studies as well as historical records of migration and intermarriage.\n\nIdentification of population substructure among Jews using STR markers and dependence on reference populations included\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Detecting population substructure is a critical issue for association studies of health behaviors and other traits.

However, there has been no accurate characterization of the proportion of mixture, or of its date. We analyze genome-wide polymorphism data from about 40 West Eurasian groups to show that almost all Southern Europeans have inherited 1%â3% African ancestry with an average mixture date of around 55 generations ago, consistent with North African gene flow at the end of the Roman Empire and subsequent Arab migrations. Levantine groups harbor 4%â15% African ancestry with an average mixture date of about 32 generations ago, consistent with close political, economic, and cultural links with Egypt in the late middle ages. We also detect 3%â5% sub-Saharan African ancestry in all eight of the diverse Jewish populations that we analyzed. For the Jewish admixture, we obtain an average estimated date of about 72 generations. This may reflect descent of these groups from a common ancestral population that already had some African ancestry prior to the Jewish Diasporas.

Gisbert; Brion, Maria; Carracedo, Angel; Lavinha, JoÃ£o; MartÃ­nez-Jarreta, BegoÃ±a; Quintana-Murci, Lluis; Picornell, AntÃ²nia; Ramon, Misericordia; Skorecki, Karl; Behar, Doron M.; Calafell, Francesc; Jobling, Mark A.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nMost studies of European genetic diversity have focused on large-scale variation and interpretations based on events in prehistory, but migrations and invasions in historical times could also have had profound effects on the genetic landscape. The Iberian Peninsula provides a suitable region for examination of the demographic impact of such recent events, because its complex recent history has involved the long-term residence of two very different populations with distinct geographical origins and their own particular cultural and religious characteristicsâNorth African Muslims and Sephardic Jews. To address this issue, we analyzed Y chromosome haplotypes, which provide the necessary phylogeographic resolution, in 1140 males from the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands. Admixture analysis based on binary and Y-STR haplotypes indicates a high mean proportion of ancestry from North African (10.6%) and Sephardic Jewish (19.8%) sources. Despite alternative possible sources for lineages ascribed a Sephardic Jewish origin, these proportions attest to a high level of religious conversion (whether voluntary or enforced), driven by historical episodes of social and religious intolerance, that ultimately led to the integration of descendants. In agreement with the historical record, analysis of haplotype sharing and diversity within specific haplogroups suggests that the Sephardic Jewish component is the more ancient. The geographical distribution of North African ancestry in the peninsula does not reflect the initial colonization and subsequent withdrawal and is likely to result from later enforced population movementâmore marked in some regions than in othersâplus the effects of genetic drift.

In other words, it is our intention to inquire into the reasons, sometimes historical and social, sometimes cultural and religious - or all of these at the same time - which have led and maybe still lead - such vast numbers of Jews to embark upon a course of study in medicine. Reasons which might be closely linked with their traditional perception of the figure of the father, of the rabbi, maybe even of God.\n\nMolecular anthropology meets genetic medicine to treat blindness in the North African Jewish population: human gene therapy initiated in Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nBanin, Eyal; Bandah-Rozenfeld, Dikla; Obolensky, Alexey; Cideciyan, Artur V; Aleman, Tomas S; Marks-Ohana, Devora; Sela, Malka; Boye, Sanford; Sumaroka, Alexander; Roman, Alejandro J; Schwartz, Sharon B; Hauswirth, William W; Jacobson, Samuel G; Hemo, Itzhak; Sharon, Dror\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe history of the North African Jewish community is ancient and complicated with a number of immigration waves and persecutions dramatically affecting its population size. A decade-long process in Israel of clinical-molecular screening of North African Jews with incurable autosomal recessive blindness led to the identification of a homozygous splicing mutation (c.95-2Aâ>âT; IVS2-2Aâ>âT) in RPE65, the gene encoding the isomerase that catalyzes a key step in the retinoid-visual cycle, in patients from 10 unrelated families. A total of 33 patients (four now deceased) had the severe childhood blindness known as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), making it the most common cause of retinal degeneration in this population. Haplotype analysis in seven of the patients revealed a shared homozygous region, indicating a population-specific founder mutation. The age of the RPE65 founder mutation was estimated to have emerged 100-230 (mean, 153) generations ago, suggesting it originated before the establishment of the Jewish community in North Africa. Individuals with this RPE65 mutation were characterized with retinal studies to determine if they were candidates for gene replacement, the recent and only therapy to date for this otherwise incurable blindness. The step from molecular anthropological studies to application of genetic medicine was then taken, and a representative of this patient subgroup was treated with subretinal rAAV2-RPE65 gene therapy. An increase in vision was present in the treated area as early as 15 days after the intervention. This process of genetically analyzing affected isolated populations as a screen for gene-based therapy suggests a new paradigm for disease diagnosis and treatment.\n\nGenomic Ancestry of North Africans Supports Back-to-Africa Migrations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGravel, Simon; Wang, Wei; Brisbin, Abra; Byrnes, Jake K.; Fadhlaoui-Zid, Karima; Zalloua, Pierre A.; Moreno-Estrada, Andres; Bertranpetit, Jaume; Bustamante, Carlos D.; Comas, David\n\n2012-01-01\n\nNorth African populations are distinct from sub-Saharan Africans based on cultural, linguistic, and phenotypic attributes; however, the time and the extent of genetic divergence between populations north and south of the Sahara remain poorly understood. Here, we interrogate the multilayered history of North Africa by characterizing the effect of hypothesized migrations from the Near East, Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa on current genetic diversity. We present dense, genome-wide SNP genotyping array data (730,000 sites) from seven North African populations, spanning from Egypt to Morocco, and one Spanish population. We identify a gradient of likely autochthonous Maghrebi ancestry that increases from east to west across northern Africa; this ancestry is likely derived from âback-to-Africaâ gene flow more than 12,000 years ago (ya), prior to the Holocene. The indigenous North African ancestry is more frequent in populations with historical Berber ethnicity. In most North African populations we also see substantial shared ancestry with the Near East, and to a lesser extent sub-Saharan Africa and Europe. To estimate the time of migration from sub-Saharan populations into North Africa, we implement a maximum likelihood dating method based on the distribution of migrant tracts. In order to first identify migrant tracts, we assign local ancestry to haplotypes using a novel, principal component-based analysis of three ancestral populations. We estimate that a migration of western African origin into Morocco began about 40 generations ago (approximately 1,200 ya); a migration of individuals with Nilotic ancestry into Egypt occurred about 25 generations ago (approximately 750 ya). Our genomic data reveal an extraordinarily complex history of migrations, involving at least five ancestral populations, into North Africa.

The overall incidence of the disease is about 1:100,000 life births in the USA; however, it is unusually frequent among North African Jews in Israel (prevalence 1:5,400, carrier prevalence 1:35). All North African Jewish GSD III patients examined have both liver and muscle involvement. While all patients showed the characteristic features related to the liver enzyme deficiency, the peripheral muscular impairment varied from minimal to severe, with neuromuscular involvement. A single mutation in the AGL gene, the deletion of T at position 4,455 (4,455delT) in homozygous form, was found in this patient population. The mutation 4,455delT results in the change of 17 amino acids at the carboxy terminus of the AGL protein (1,486-1,502) and truncation of the last 30 amino acids of the normal AGL 1,532 amino acids. The mutation appears to be ethnic specific as it was not seen in 18 patients of different ethnic origins. This is the first report of a mutation in the AGL gene affecting a considerable number of GSD III patients in a defined population.\n\nNorth African savanna fires and atmospheric carbon dioxide\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nIacobellis, Sam F.; Frouin, Robert; Razafimpanilo, Herisoa; Somerville, Richard C. J.; Piper, Stephen C.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe effect of north African savanna fires on atmospheric CO2 is investigated using a tracer transport model. The model uses winds from operational numerical weather prediction analyses and provides CO2 concentrations as a function of space and time. After a spin-up period of several years, biomass-burning sources are added, and model experiments are run for an additional year, utilizing various estimates of CO2 sources. The various model experiments show that biomass burning in the north African savannas significantly affects CO2 concentrations in South America. The effect is more pronounced during the period from January through March, when biomass burning in South America is almost nonexistent. During this period, atmospheric CO2 concentrations in parts of South America typically may increase by 0.5 to 0.75 ppm at 970 mbar, the average pressure of the lowest model layer. These figures are above the probable uncertainty level, as model runs with biomass-burning sources estimated from independent studies using distinct data sets and techniques indicate. From May through September, when severe biomass burning occurs in South America, the effect of north African savanna fires over South America has become generally small at 970 mbar, but north of the equator it may be of the same magnitude or larger than the effect of South American fires. The CO2 concentration increase in the extreme northern and southern portions of South America, however, is mostly due to southern African fires, whose effect may be 2-3 times larger than the effect of South American fires at 970 mbar. Even in the central part of the continent, where local biomass-burning emissions are maximum, southern African fires contribute to at least 15% of the CO2 concentration increase at 970 mbar.

We present genomic data from seven 15,000-year-old modern humans, attributed to the Iberomaurusian culture, from Morocco. We find a genetic affinity with early Holocene Near Easterners, best represented by Levantine Natufians, suggesting a pre-agricultural connection between Africa and the Near East. We do not find evidence for gene flow from Paleolithic Europeans to Late Pleistocene North Africans. The Taforalt individuals derive one-third of their ancestry from sub-Saharan Africans, best approximated by a mixture of genetic components preserved in present-day West and East Africans. Thus, we provide direct evidence for genetic interactions between modern humans across Africa and Eurasia in the Pleistocene.

Yet, the current understanding of oceanic versus terrestrial drivers of North African droughts/pluvials is largely model-based, with vast disagreement among models. In order to identify the observed drivers of North African climate and develop a benchmark for model evaluations, the multivariate Generalized Equilibrium Feedback Assessment (GEFA) is applied to observations, remotely sensed data, and reanalysis products. The identified primary oceanic drivers of North African rainfall variability are the Atlantic, tropical Indian, and tropical Pacific Oceans and Mediterranean Sea. During the summer monsoon, positive tropical eastern Atlantic sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies are associated with a southward shift of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, enhanced ocean evaporation, and greater precipitable water across coastal West Africa, leading to increased West African monsoon (WAM) rainfall and decreased Sahel rainfall. During the short rains, positive SST anomalies in the western tropical Indian Ocean and negative anomalies in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean support greater easterly oceanic flow, evaporation over the western ocean, and moisture advection to East Africa, thereby enhancing rainfall. The sign, magnitude, and timing of observed vegetation forcing on rainfall vary across North Africa. The positive feedback of leaf area index (LAI) on rainfall is greatest during DJF for the Horn of Africa, while it peaks in autumn and is weakest during the summer monsoon for the Sahel. Across the WAM region, a positive LAI anomaly supports an earlier monsoon onset, increased rainfall during the pre-monsoon, and decreased rainfall during the wet season. Through unique mechanisms, positive LAI anomalies favor enhanced transpiration, precipitable water, and rainfall across the Sahel and Horn of Africa, and increased roughness, ascent, and rainfall across the WAM region\n\nThe Wandering Jew\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWoolf, Michael\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis essay examines the interaction between the myth of the Wandering Jew, diaspora history and the notion of cosmopolitanism.

The investigation of the genetic relationship among three Jewish communities revealed that Kurdish and Sephardic Jews were indistinguishable from one another, whereas both differed slightly, yet significantly, from Ashkenazi Jews. The differences among Ashkenazim may be a result of low-level gene flow from European populations and/or genetic drift during isolation. Admixture between Kurdish Jews and their former Muslim host population in Kurdistan appeared to be negligible. In comparison with data available from other relevant populations in the region, Jews were found to be more closely related to groups in the north of the Fertile Crescent (Kurds, Turks, and Armenians) than to their Arab neighbors. The two haplogroups Eu 9 and Eu 10 constitute a major part of the Y chromosome pool in the analyzed sample. Our data suggest that Eu 9 originated in the northern part, and Eu 10 in the southern part of the Fertile Crescent. Genetic dating yielded estimates of the expansion of both haplogroups that cover the Neolithic period in the region. Palestinian Arabs and Bedouin differed from the other Middle Eastern populations studied here, mainly in specific high-frequency Eu 10 haplotypes not found in the non-Arab groups. These chromosomes might have been introduced through migrations from the Arabian Peninsula during the last two millennia. The present study contributes to the elucidation of the complex demographic history that shaped the present-day genetic landscape in the region.

Evidence for both prolonged humid periods and monsoon failures have been identified throughout the late Pleistocene and early Holocene epochs. In particular, drought conditions in West Africa have occurred during periods of reduced North Atlantic thermohaline circulation, such as the Younger Dryas cold event. Here, we use an ocean-atmosphere general circulation model to examine the link between oceanographic changes in the North Atlantic Ocean and changes in the strength of the African monsoon. Our simulations show that when North Atlantic thermohaline circulation is substantially weakened, the flow of the subsurface North Brazil Current reverses. This leads to decreased upper tropical ocean stratification and warmer sea surface temperatures in the equatorial South Atlantic Ocean, and consequently reduces African summer monsoonal winds and rainfall over West Africa. This mechanism is in agreement with reconstructions of past climate. We therefore suggest that the interaction between thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean and wind-driven currents in the tropical Atlantic Ocean contributes to the rapidity of African monsoon transitions during abrupt climate change events.\n\nFacial image of Biblical Jews from Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nKobyliansky, E; Balueva, T; Veselovskaya, E; Arensburg, B\n\n2008-06-01\n\nThe present report deals with reconstructing the facial shapes of ancient inhabitants of Israel based on their cranial remains. The skulls of a male from the Hellenistic period and a female from the Roman period have been reconstructed. They were restored using the most recently developed programs in anthropological facial reconstruction, especially that of the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Balueva & Veselovskaya 2004). The basic craniometrical measurements of the two skulls were measured according to Martin & Saller (1957) and compared to the data from three ancient populations of Israel described by Arensburg et al. (1980): that of the Hellenistic period dating from 332 to 37 B.C., that of the Roman period, from 37 B.C. to 324 C.E., and that of the Byzantine period that continued until the Arab conquest in 640 C.E. Most of this osteological material was excavated in the Jordan River and the Dead Sea areas. A sample from the XVIIth century Jews from Prague (Matiegka 1926) was also used for osteometrical comparisons. The present study will characterize not only the osteological morphology of the material, but also the facial appearance of ancient inhabitants of Israel. From an anthropometric point of view, the two skulls studied here definitely belong to the same sample from the Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine populations of Israel as well as from Jews from Prague. Based on its facial reconstruction, the male skull may belong to the large Mediterranean group that inhabited this area from historic to modern times. The female skull also exhibits all the Mediterranean features but, in addition, probably some equatorial (African) mixture manifested by the shape of the reconstructed nose and the facial prognatism.\n\nNo evidence from genome-wide data of a Khazar origin for the Ashkenazi Jews.\n\nPubMed\n\nBehar, Doron M; Metspalu, Mait; Baran, Yael; Kopelman, Naama M; Yunusbayev, Bayazit; Gladstein, Ariella; Tzur, Shay; Sahakyan, Hovhannes; Bahmanimehr, Ardeshir; Yepiskoposyan, Levon; Tambets, Kristina; Khusnutdinova, Elza K; Kushniarevich, Alena; Balanovsky, Oleg; Balanovsky, Elena; Kovacevic, Lejla; Marjanovic, Damir; Mihailov, Evelin; Kouvatsi, Anastasia; Triantaphyllidis, Costas; King, Roy J; Semino, Ornella; Torroni, Antonio; Hammer, Michael F; Metspalu, Ene; Skorecki, Karl; Rosset, Saharon; Halperin, Eran; Villems, Richard; Rosenberg, Noah A\n\n2013-12-01\n\nstandard techniques for the analysis of population-genetic structure, we found that Ashkenazi Jews share the greatest genetic ancestry with other Jewish populations and, among non-Jewish populations, with groups from Europe and the Middle East. No particular similarity of Ashkenazi Jews to populations from the Caucasus is evident, particularly populations that most closely represent the Khazar region. Thus, analysis of Ashkenazi Jews together with a large sample from the region of the Khazar Khaganate corroborates the earlier results that Ashkenazi Jews derive their ancestry primarily from populations of the Middle East and Europe, that they possess considerable shared ancestry with other Jewish populations, and that there is no indication of a significant genetic contribution either from within or from north of the Caucasus region.

Randomly administered an eight-question survey to African Americans age 15-74 living in Halifax County North Carolina. Ninety-five out of 116 eligible participants completed the survey (82% response rate). Most (67%) of the participants reported having two or more major risk factors for Type II diabetes (diabetes mellitus). More than half (51.6%) of the participants were obese. Most (96.8%) of the participants reported having been tested for diabetes at some point in their lives (10% testedpositive, only 8.4% of the remaining 9o% reported ever having a second test). Diabetes mellitus is a very prevalentproblem among the African American population of Halifax County North Carolina. Our study underscores the fact that patients are not systematically screened and followed-up for diabetes melitus. More healthcare and commnity programs need to be adapted to fight this serious public health problem.\n\nGenetic portrait of Jewish populations based on three sets of X-chromosome markers: Indels, Alu insertions and STRs.\n\nPubMed\n\nFerragut, J F; Bentayebi, K; Pereira, R; Castro, J A; Amorim, A; Ramon, C; Picornell, A\n\n2017-11-01\n\nPopulation genetic data for 53 X-chromosome markers (32 X-indels, 9 X-Alu insertions and 12 X-STRs) are reported for five populations with Jewish ancestry (Sephardim, North African Jews, Middle Eastern Jews, Ashkenazim, and Chuetas) and Majorca, as the host population of Chuetas. Genetic distances between these populations demonstrated significant differences, except between Sephardic and North African Jews, with the Chuetas as the most differentiated group, in accordance with the particular demographic history of this population. X-chromosome analysis and a comparison with autosomal data suggest a generally sex-biased demographic history in Jewish populations. Asymmetry was found between female and male effective population sizes both in the admixture processes between Jewish communities, and between them and their respective non-Jewish host populations. Results further show that these X-linked markers are highly informative for forensic purposes, and highlight the need for specific databases for differentiated Jewish populations.

In Grade 6, boys of both ethnic groups reported higher levels of gender typicality and felt pressure for gender conformity than girls. European French girls and boys and North African French girls reported decreasing gender typicality from Grade 6 to Grade 9, whereas North African French boys did not change. Felt pressure decreased among girls, did not change in European French boys, and increased in North African French boys. Ethnic and gender differences in gender identity development are discussed.

In a 2001 book, The popes against the Jews , I demonstrated that in fact the church played a major role in leading Catholics throughout Europe to view Jews as an existential threat. Yet defenders of the church position continue to deny the historical evidence and to launch ferocious ad hominem attacks against scholars who have researched the subject. The anti-Semitism promulgated by the church can be seen as part of the long battle it waged against modernity, with which the Jews were identified.\n\nHuman Alu insertion polymorphisms in North African populations.\n\nPubMed\n\nCherni, Loth; Frigi, Sabeh; Ennafaa, Hajer; Mtiraoui, Nabil; Mahjoub, Touhami; Benammar-Elgaaied, Amel\n\n2011-10-01\n\nSeveral features make Alu insertions a powerful tool used in population genetic studies: the polymorphic nature of many Alu insertions, the stability of an Alu insertion event and, furthermore, the ancestral state of an Alu insertion is known to be the absence of the Alu element at a particular locus and the presence of an Alu insertion at the site that forward mutational change. This study analyses seven Alu insertion polymorphisms in a sample of 297 individuals from the autochthonous population of Tunisia (Thala, Smar, Zarzis, and Bou Salem) and Libya with the aim of studying their genetic structure with respect to the populations of North Africa, Western, Eastern and Central Europe. The comparative analyses carried out using the MDS and AMOVA methods reveal the existence of spatial heterogeneity, and identify four population groups. Study populations (Libya, Smar, Zarzis, and Bou Salem) are closest to North African populations whereas Thala is isolated and is closest to Western European populations. In conclusion, Results of the present study support the important role that migratory movements have played in the North African gene pool, at least since the Neolithic period.\n\nLemba origins revisited: tracing the ancestry of Y chromosomes in South African and Zimbabwean Lemba.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoodyall, Himla\n\n2013-10-11\n\nPrevious historical, anthropological and genetic data provided overwhelming support for the Semitic origins of the Lemba, a Bantu-speaking people in southern Africa. To revisit the question concerning genetic affinities between the Lemba and Jews. Y-chromosome variation was examined in two Lemba groups: one from South Africa (SA) and, for the first time, a group from Zimbabwe (Remba), to re-evaluate the previously reported Jewish link. A sample of 261 males (76 Lemba, 54 Remba, 43 Venda and 88 SA Jews) was initially analysed for 16 bi-allelic and 6 short tandem repeats (STRs) that resulted in the resolution of 102 STR haplotypes distributed across 13 haplogroups. The non-African component in the Lemba and Remba was estimated to be 73.7% and 79.6%, respectively. In addition, a subset of 91 individuals (35 Lemba, 24 Remba, 32 SA Jews) with haplogroup J were resolved further using 6 additional bi-allelic markers and 12 STRs to screen for the extended Cohen modal haplotype (CMH). Although 24 individuals (10 Lemba and 14 SA Jews) were identified as having the original CMH (six STRs), only one SA Jew harboured the extended CMH.CONCLUSIONS. While it was not possible to trace unequivocally the origins of the non-African Y chromosomes in the Lemba and Remba, this study does not support the earlier claims of their Jewish genetic heritage.\n\nMendelian diseases among Roman Jews: implications for the origins of disease alleles.\n\nPubMed\n\nOddoux, C; Guillen-Navarro, E; Ditivoli, C; Dicave, E; Cilio, M R; Clayton, C M; Nelson, H; Sarafoglou, K; McCain, N; Peretz, H; Seligsohn, U; Luzzatto, L; Nafa, K; Nardi, M; Karpatkin, M; Aksentijevich, I; Kastner, D; Axelrod, F; Ostrer, H\n\n1999-12-01\n\nThe Roman Jewish community has been historically continuous in Rome since pre-Christian times and may have been progenitor to the Ashkenazi Jewish community. Despite a history of endogamy over the past 2000 yr, the historical record suggests that there was admixture with Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews during the Middle Ages. To determine whether Roman and Ashkenazi Jews shared common signature mutations, we tested a group of 107 Roman Jews, representing 176 haploid sets of chromosomes. No mutations were found for Bloom syndrome, BRCA1, BRCA2, Canavan disease, Fanconi anemia complementation group C, or Tay-Sachs disease. Two unrelated individuals were positive for the 3849 + 10C->T cystic fibrosis mutation; one carried the N370S Gaucher disease mutation, and one carried the connexin 26 167delT mutation. Each of these was shown to be associated with the same haplotype of tightly linked microsatellite markers as that found among Ashkenazi Jews. In addition, 14 individuals had mutations in the familial Mediterranean fever gene and three unrelated individuals carried the factor XI type III mutation previously observed exclusively among Ashkenazi Jews. These findings suggest that the Gaucher, connexin 26, and familial Mediterranean fever mutations are over 2000 yr old, that the cystic fibrosis 3849 + 10kb C->T and factor XI type III mutations had a common origin in Ashkenazi and Roman Jews, and that other mutations prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews are of more recent origin.\n\nTrends in the incidence of type 1 diabetes among Jews and Arabs in Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nBlumenfeld, Orit; Dichtiar, Rita; Shohat, Tamy\n\n2014-09-01\n\nTo assess the trends in the incidence of type 1 diabetes between 1997 and 2010 among 0-17-yr-old Israeli Jews and Arabs compared with global trends. Data on children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes reported by pediatric endocrinologists from 19 medical centers to the Israel Center for Disease Control, as part of the National Diabetes Register. During 1997-2010, 2857 Jews and 757 Arabs were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. The average age-adjusted incidence among Jews was higher than Arabs [12.2 per 100 000, 95% confidence interval (CI) 10.5-14.2 and 8.9 per 100 000, 95% CI 7.5-10.7, p = 0.0001, respectively], however, the annual percent change was higher for Arabs compared with Jews (4.0 vs. 3.6%, p = 0.005, respectively). The mean age at diagnosis was similar for Jews and Arabs (9.6 Â± 4.4 vs. 9.9 Â± 4.4 yr, p = 0.08), and it remained stable during 1997-2010 in both ethnic groups (p = 0.6). In both Jews and Arabs the highest annual percent change was observed in younger children. It was 4.9% for children aged 5-9 yr and 10.7% for children aged 0-4 yr, respectively. There were no differences in the frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) between Jews (39.9%) and Arabs (41.3%), (p = 0.5). Type 1 diabetes incidence of Jews and Arabs in Israel is increasing. The incidence is higher in Jews than in Arabs; however, the annual percent change is higher in Arabs than in Jews. In both Ethnic groups the incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing especially among young children. Â© 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In North Africa, the number of cancer patients is alarming. Also shocking is that a huge number of cancer patients only have access to traditional medicines due to several factors, e.g., economic difficulties. In fact, medicinal plants are widely used for the treatment of several pathologies, including cancer. Truthfully, herbalists and botanists in North African countries prescribe several plants for cancer treatment. Despite the popularity and the potential of medicinal plants for the treatment of cancer, scientific evidence on their anticancer effects are still scarce for most of the described plants. Objective: Bearing in mind the lack of comprehensive and systematic studies, the aim of this review is to give an overview of studies, namely ethnobotanical surveys and experimental evidence of anticancer effects regarding medicinal plants used in North Africa for cancer therapy. Method: The research was conducted on several popular search engines including PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science. The research focused primarily on English written papers published between the years 2000 and 2016. Results: This review on plants traditionally used by herbalists in North Africa highlights that Morocco and Algeria are the countries with most surveys on the use of medicinal plants in folk medicine.

In all countries, human development in general and life expectancy, literacy and per capita income in particular have increased. However, improvement was not equally shared between groups of different milieu, regions or level of income. Social inequalities and health inequity have persisted or even worsened. Data are generally scarce and few studies were devoted to this topic in North Africa as a region. In this paper, we carry out a comparative study on the achievements of these countries, not only in terms of human development and its components but also in terms of inequalities' reduction and health equity. This study is based on data available for comparison between North African countries. The main data sources are provided by reports released by the World Health Organisation (WHO), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, surveys such as Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and finally recent papers published on equity in different countries of the region. There is no doubt that education, health and human development in general have improved in North Africa during the last decades. Improvement was, however, uneven and unequally enjoyed by different socioeconomic groups. Indeed, each country included in this study shows large urban-rural disparities, discrepancies between advantaged and disadvantaged regions and cities; and unacceptable differences between rich and poor. Health inequity is particularly seen through access to health services and infant mortality. During the last decades, North African decision makers have endeavoured to improve social and economic conditions of their populations. Globally, health, education and living standard in general have substantially improved in average.

Why are Jews so creative? Some have claimed, they are genetically more intelligent as determined by IQ tests. Whereas there is an intelligence threshold people must reach before being highly creative after this threshold is reached there is no strong relationship between creativity and intelligence. Creative innovation is heavily dependent upon disengagement and divergent thinking as well as subsequent convergent thinking and productivity. The mean by which a personâs brain functions is dependent upon both nature (genetically determined) and nature (learned). In regard to nature, from their earliest age many Jewish children are encouraged to question as well as taught that disobedience in the pursuit of truth and justice is not only justified but is also desirable. Thus, disobedience in this regard is not the cultivation of insolence, but rather gives rise to disengagement and divergent thinking, the critical elements of creativity.Training can also alter the brain, and the Jewish people success in creativity may not be related to their genetically determined IQ, but rather the learned propensity to earnestly question and seek better alternatives.\n\nEngaging in psychotherapy with the Orthodox Jew: a critical review.\n\nPubMed\n\nMargolese, H C\n\n1998-01-01\n\nA critical overview of the current knowledge of engaging in psychotherapy with a cultural minority, Orthodox Jews, is provided. The various forms of psychotherapy that have been utilized to engage Orthodox Jews in meaningful psychotherapeutic encounters are discussed. Psychodynamic, cognitive, behavioral, couple, family, and group therapies have all been employed with success. The first key in working with cultural minorities, including Orthodox Jews, is patience. Patience is required to allow a therapeutic alliance to develop in which the therapist, the outsider, can be trusted. When patients are reluctant to accept the treatment proposed, patience is necessary to give them the time required to verify the treatment with someone they trust, often their rabbi in the case of the Orthodox Jew. Patience is also valuable when patients request a change in the frame of therapy, such as the use of a chaperon or leaving the door slightly ajar if being treated by a member of the opposite sex. The second key in working with this or any other cultural minority is flexibility. Flexibility is required, to chose treatment modalities that best fit with the patient's beliefs, to respect the patient's beliefs no matter the extent they deviate from the therapist's own, and finally, to be critical of oneself when examining transference and countertransference reactions.\n\nIntroducing the Algerian Mitochondrial DNA and Y-Chromosome Profiles into the North African Landscape\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBekada, Asmahan; Fregel, Rosa; Cabrera, Vicente M.; Larruga, JosÃ© M.; Pestano, JosÃ©; Benhamamouch, Soraya; GonzÃ¡lez, Ana M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nNorth Africa is considered a distinct geographic and ethnic entity within Africa. Although modern humans originated in this Continent, studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosome genealogical markers provide evidence that the North African gene pool has been shaped by the back-migration of several Eurasian lineages in Paleolithic and Neolithic times. More recent influences from sub-Saharan Africa and Mediterranean Europe are also evident. The presence of East-West and North-South haplogroup frequency gradients strongly reinforces the genetic complexity of this region. However, this genetic scenario is beset with a notable gap, which is the lack of consistent information for Algeria, the largest country in the Maghreb. To fill this gap, we analyzed a sample of 240 unrelated subjects from a northwest Algeria cosmopolitan population using mtDNA sequences and Y-chromosome biallelic polymorphisms, focusing on the fine dissection of haplogroups E and R, which are the most prevalent in North Africa and Europe respectively. The Eurasian component in Algeria reached 80% for mtDNA and 90% for Y-chromosome. However, within them, the North African genetic component for mtDNA (U6 and M1; 20%) is significantly smaller than the paternal (E-M81 and E-V65; 70%). The unexpected presence of the European-derived Y-chromosome lineages R-M412, R-S116, R-U152 and R-M529 in Algeria and the rest of the Maghreb could be the counterparts of the mtDNA H1, H3 and V subgroups, pointing to direct maritime contacts between the European and North African sides of the western Mediterranean. Female influx of sub-Saharan Africans into Algeria (20%) is also significantly greater than the male (10%). In spite of these sexual asymmetries, the Algerian uniparental profiles faithfully correlate between each other and with the geography.

A cross-sectional National Health Interview Survey was carried out in Israel based on a random sample of telephone numbers as part of the EUROHIS project (WHO European Health Interview Survey 2003-2004). A random telephone survey included 9,352 interviews. Questions included use of health care services, health status, and socioeconomic variables. After adjusting for sex, age, income, education, marital status, and self-reported chronic diseases, Arabs more often reported visiting a family physician (odds ratio [OR]=1.56, 95 percent confidence interval [CI]=1.35-1.81) and less often reported visiting a specialist (OR=0.73, 95 percent CI=0.60-0.89) compared with Jews. In addition, the odds ratio for hospitalization was similar among Arabs and Jews (OR=1.16, 95 percent CI=0.97-1.38). SES was associated with utilization of health care services only in the Jewish population. A different pattern of utilization of health care services was observed in Arabs and Jews. This was not explained by differences in socioeconomic levels.

Studies revealed meaningful cultural differences in attachment orientations, but few included Arab samples. to fill this gap, we compared attachment orientations of Jews and Arabs in Israel using valid measures. Israeli participants (292 Arabs and 206 Jews) described their attachment figures and completed the Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire which measures anxious and avoidant attachment orientations in Arabic and Hebrew, respectively. Israeli Arabs reported higher attachment anxiety than Israeli Jews, but no difference was found in avoidance. Both groups reported that attachment figures were similar in gender and relationship type, and included romantic partners, relatives and friends. Findings should be considered cautiously due to sampling limitations. the results complement previous cross-cultural findings and Arabs-Jews differences in relationship-related norms/values. Higher attachment-anxiety scores observed among Israeli Arabs may be considered culturally normative with implications for the development of culturally competent interventions.\n\nAdult-onset diabetes among Arabs and Jews in Israel: a population-based study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKalter-Leibovici, O; Chetrit, A; Lubin, F; Atamna, A; Alpert, G; Ziv, A; Abu-Saad, K; Murad, H; Eilat-Adar, S; Goldbourt, U\n\n2012-06-01\n\nTo study the age at presentation and factors associated with adult-onset diabetes (â¥ 20 years) among Arabs and Jews in Israel. Participants (n = 1100) were randomly selected from the urban population of the Hadera District in Israel. The study sample was stratified into equal groups according to sex, ethnicity (Arabs and Jews) and age. Information on age at diabetes presentation, family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes, socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics was obtained through personal interviews. Self reports of diabetes were compared with medical records and were found reliable (Îº = 0.87). The risk for diabetes was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Factors associated with diabetes in both ethnic groups were studied using Cox proportional hazard model. The prevalence of adult-onset diabetes was 21% among Arabs and 12% among Jews. Arab participants were younger than Jews at diabetes presentation. By the age of 57 years, 25% of Arabs had diagnosed diabetes; the corresponding age among Jews was 68 years, a difference of 11 years (P < 0.001). The greater risk for diabetes among Arabs was independent of lifestyle factors, family history of diabetes and, among women, history of gestational diabetes; adjusted hazard ratio 1.70; 95% confidence interval 1.19-2.43. Arabs in Israel are at greater risk for adult-onset diabetes than Jews and are younger at diabetes presentation. Culturally sensitive interventions aimed at maintaining normal body weight and active lifestyle should be targeted at this population. Possible genetic factors and gene-environmental interactions underlying the high risk for diabetes among Arabs should be investigated. Â© 2011 The Authors.

In the nineteenth century the view that the Jew was especially prone to developing mental illnesses became an accepted part of medical discourse. Jewish doctors, too, believed this and had to evolve a means of dealing with their own potential madness.\n\nReligion as culture: religious individualism and collectivism among american catholics, jews, and protestants.\n\nPubMed\n\nCohen, Adam B; Hill, Peter C\n\n2007-08-01\n\nWe propose the theory that religious cultures vary in individualistic and collectivistic aspects of religiousness and spirituality. Study 1 showed that religion for Jews is about community and biological descent but about personal beliefs for Protestants. Intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity were intercorrelated and endorsed differently by Jews, Catholics, and Protestants in a pattern that supports the theory that intrinsic religiosity relates to personal religion, whereas extrinsic religiosity stresses community and ritual (Studies 2 and 3). Important life experiences were likely to be social for Jews but focused on God for Protestants, with Catholics in between (Study 4). We conclude with three perspectives in understanding the complex relationships between religion and culture.\n\nSoaring on the wings of the wind: Freud, Jews and Judaism.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaplan, Robert\n\n2009-08-01\n\nThis paper looks at Freud's Jewish identity in the context of the Jewish experience in Eastern and Central Europe after 1800, using his family history and significant figures in his life as illustration. Sigmund Freud's life as a Jew is deeply paradoxical, if not enigmatic. He mixed almost exclusively with Jews while living all his life in an anti-Semitic environment. Yet he eschewed Jewish ritual, referred to himself as a godless Jew and sought to make his movement acceptable to gentiles. At the end of his life, dismayed by the rising forces of nationalism, he accepted that he was in his heart a Jew \"in spite of all efforts to be unprejudiced and impartial\". The 18th century Haskalla (Jewish Enlightenment) was a form of rebellion against conformity and a means of escape from shtetl life. In this intense, entirely inward means of intellectual escape and revolt against authority, strongly tinged with sexual morality, we see the same tensions that were to manifest in the publication by a middle-aged Viennese neurologist of a truly revolutionary book to herald the new 20th century: The Interpretation of Dreams. Freud's life and work needs to be understood in the context of fin-de-siecle Vienna. Mitteleuropa, the cultural renaissance of Central Europe, resulted from the emancipation and urbanization of the burgeoning Jewish middle class, who adopted to the cosmopolitan environment more successfully than any other group. In this there is an extreme paradox: the Jewish success in Vienna was a tragedy of success. Freud, despite a deliberate attempt to play down his Jewish origins to deflect anti-Semitic attacks, is the most representative Jew of his time and his thinking and work represents the finest manifestation of the Litvak mentality.\n\nSelf-Reported Type 2 Diabetes and Diabetes-Related Eye Disease in Jews and Arabs in Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nZucker, Inbar; Arditi-Babchuk, Hadar; Enav, Teena; Shohat, Tamar\n\n2016-12-01\n\nPrevalence rates of diabetes and its complications may be higher in minorities. We assessed these rates in Jews and Arabs living in Israel. Data were pooled from the first and second Israeli national health interview surveys. 9625 Jews and 2401 Arabs participated in the analysis. The age adjusted rate of self-reported diabetes was 10.7Â % among Arabs and 5.7Â % among Jews [odds ratio (OR) 2.14, 95Â % confidence interval 1.77-2.60]. After adjustment for risk factors the OR decreased to 1.28 (95Â % CI 1.04-1.59). The rate of self-reported diabetes-related eye disease was 37.6Â % among Arabs with diabetes and 18.3Â % among Jews (OR 2.69, 95Â % CI 1.84-3.93). After adjustment the odds among Arabs were still double that of Jews (OR 2.26, 95Â % CI 1.44-3.56). Self-reported type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related eye disease were higher among Arabs. Multi-disciplinary and cultural sensitive approach is required in order to improve diabetes care among the Arab population.\n\nNovel Mutations Causing C5 Deficiency in Three North-African Families.\n\nPubMed\n\nColobran, Roger; Franco-Jarava, Clara; MartÃ­n-Nalda, Andrea; Baena, Neus; Gabau, Elisabeth; Padilla, NatÃ lia; de la Cruz, Xavier; Pujol-Borrell, Ricardo; Comas, David; Soler-PalacÃ­n, Pere; HernÃ¡ndez-GonzÃ¡lez, Manuel\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe complement system plays a central role in defense to encapsulated bacteria through opsonization and membrane attack complex (MAC) dependent lysis. The three activation pathways (classical, lectin, and alternative) converge in the cleavage of C5, which initiates MAC formation and target lysis. C5 deficiency is associated to recurrent infections by Neisseria spp. In the present study, complement deficiency was suspected in three families of North-African origin after one episode of invasive meningitis due to a non-groupable and two uncommon Meningococcal serotypes (E29, Y). Activity of alternative and classical pathways of complement were markedly reduced and the measurement of terminal complement components revealed total C5 absence. C5 gene analysis revealed two novel mutations as causative of the deficiency: Family A propositus carried a homozygous deletion of two adenines in the exon 21 of C5 gene, resulting in a frameshift and a truncated protein (c.2607_2608del/p.Ser870ProfsX3 mutation). Families B and C probands carried the same homozygous deletion of three consecutive nucleotides (CAA) in exon 9 of the C5 gene, leading to the deletion of asparagine 320 (c.960_962del/p.Asn320del mutation). Family studies confirmed an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Although sharing the same geographical origin, families B and C were unrelated. This prompted us to investigate this mutation prevalence in a cohort of 768 North-African healthy individuals. We identified one heterozygous carrier of the p.Asn320del mutation (allelic frequencyâ=â0.065Â %), indicating that this mutation is present at low frequency in North-African population.\n\nComparison of African and North American velvet ant mimicry complexes: Another example of Africa as the 'odd man out'.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilson, Joseph S; Pan, Aaron D; Limb, Erica S; Williams, Kevin A\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAfrica has the most tropical and subtropical land of any continent, yet has relatively low species richness in several taxa. This depauperate nature of the African tropical fauna and flora has led some to call Africa the \"odd man out.\" One exception to this pattern is velvet ants (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae), wingless wasps that are known for MÃ¼llerian mimicry. While North American velvet ants form one of the world's largest mimicry complexes, mimicry in African species has not been investigated. Here we ask do African velvet ant MÃ¼llerian mimicry rings exist, and how do they compare to the North American complex. We then explore what factors might contribute to the differences in mimetic diversity between continents. To investigate this we compared the color patterns of 304 African velvet ant taxa using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). We then investigated distributions of each distinct mimicry ring. Finally, we compared lizard diversity and ecoregion diversity on the two continents. We found that African female velvet ants form four MÃ¼llerian rings, which is half the number of North American rings. This lower mimetic diversity could be related to the relatively lower diversity of insectivorous lizard species or to the lower number of distinct ecoregions in Africa compared to North America.\n\nTrading secrets: Jews and the early modern quest for clandestine knowledge.\n\nPubMed\n\nJÃ¼tte, Daniel\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThis essay explores the significance and function of secrecy and secret sciences in Jewish-Christian relations and in Jewish culture in the early modern period. It shows how the trade in clandestine knowledge and the practice of secret sciences became a complex, sometimes hazardous space for contact between Jews and Christians. By examining this trade, the essay clarifies the role of secrecy in the early modern marketplace of knowledge. The attribution of secretiveness to Jews was a widespread topos in early modern European thought. However, relatively little is known about the implications of such beliefs in science or in daily life. The essay pays special attention to the fact that trade in secret knowledge frequently offered Jews a path to the center of power, especially at court. Furthermore, it becomes clear that the practice of secret sciences, the trade in clandestine knowledge, and a mercantile agenda were often inextricably interwoven. Special attention is paid to the Italian-Jewish alchemist, engineer, and entrepreneur Abramo Colorni (ca. 1544-1599), whose career illustrates the opportunities provided by the marketplace of secrets at that time. Much scholarly (and less scholarly) attention has been devoted to whether and what Jews \"contributed\" to what is commonly called the \"Scientific Revolution.\" This essay argues that the question is misdirected and that, instead, we should pay more attention to the distinctive opportunities offered by the early modern economy of secrecy.\n\nWealthier Jews, taller Gentiles: inequality of income and physical stature in fin-de-siÃ¨cle Hungary.\n\nPubMed\n\nBolgÃ¡r, DÃ¡niel\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe stereotype of rich Jews versus poor Gentiles does not apply to fin-de-siÃ¨cle Hungary. Although the average income of Jews was higher than that of Gentiles, the distribution of income among Jews was extremely unequal, far more so than among Christians. Jews were over-represented at the poor end as well as at the rich end of the income spectrum. In four high schools studied the average height of Jewish students was approximately 1cm below that of Gentiles. This height-income discrepancy goes far to explain the divergence in income distribution between the members of the two faiths. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Although high diabetes prevalence is documented in Israeli Arabs, information from cohort studies is scant. This is a population study, based on information derived between 2007-2011, from the electronic database of the largest health fund in Israel, among Arabs and Jews. Prevalence, 4-year-incidence and diabetes hazard ratios [HRs], adjusted for sex and the metabolic-syndrome [MetS]-components, were determined in 3 age groups (<50 years, 50-59 years, and â¥60 years). The study cohort included 17,044 Arabs (males: 49%, age: 39.4Â±17.3) and 16,012 Jews (males: 50%, age: 40.5 Â±17.6). The overall age and sex-adjusted diabetes prevalence rates were much higher among Arabs 18.4% (95%CI: 17.6-19.1); and 10.3% (95%CI: 9.7-10.9) among Jews. Arab females had higher prevalence rates 20.0% (95%CI: 19-21) than Arab males 16.7% (95%CI: 15.7-17.8). Annual incidence rates were also significantly higher among Arabs 2.9% (95%CI: 2.7-3.1) than among Jews 1.7% (95%CI: 1.6-1.8). This held true across all age and sex subgroups. Adjustment for body mass index [BMI] attenuated HR estimates associated with Arab ethnicity across all age subgroups, mainly in the <50yrs age group from HR 2.04 (95%CI: 1.74-2.40) to 1.64 (95%CI: 1.40-1.92). BMI at incident diabetes among females was higher in Arabs than Jews. Males, however, did not differ by ethnicity. Arabs, mainly female, have high incidence and prevalence of diabetes. This excess risk is only partially explained by the high prevalence of obesity. Effective culturally-congruent diabetes prevention and treatment and an effective engagement partnership with the Arab community are of paramount need.\n\nAgentive Role of Government in African Education: North Nyanza, 1890-1920\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nOmwami, Edith Mukudi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis paper examines the agentive role of the colonial administration in accessing formal education for Africans in North Nyanza, Kenya from 1890 to 1920.

This malignant tumor poses a serious public health problem in many countries, especially in Southeast Asia and North Africa where the recorded incidence are highest. During the past decade, a growing number of studies were undertaken to define the molecular basis of NPC. However, the analysis of several clinical and biological parameters of North African and Southeast Asian NPCs has shown notable differences, suggesting that they could result from a distinct combination of etiological factors. One intriguing characteristic of North African NPC, concerns its bimodal age distribution with a secondary peak of incidence in the range of 15-25 years, not observed in Asian NPC. In this juvenile form of NPC, immuno-histochemistry assay has shown that the two key proteins controlling the apoptotic-survival balance p53 and Bcl-2 are less frequently expressed whereas the transmembrane tyrosine-kinase receptor c-kit and the main EBV oncoprotein LMP1 were more abundant. In addition, the EBV serological alterations are less informative for the diagnosis of the juvenile compared to the adult form. In addition, most North African NPCs contain EBV strains with genetic polymorphisms distinct from those described in the Southeast Asia series (predominance of F, D, H1-H2, XhoI+ and f, C, H, XhoI- respectively). In contrast, studies relating on tumor chromosomal alterations or aberrant promoter methylation result in data very similar to those obtained from the Southeast Asia series, supporting the concept of a common molecular basis for all NPC regardless of patient geographic origin.\n\nPortuguese crypto-Jews: the genetic heritage of a complex history\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNogueiro, InÃªs; Teixeira, JoÃ£o C.; Amorim, AntÃ³nio; GusmÃ£o, Leonor; Alvarez, Luis\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe first documents mentioning Jewish people in Iberia are from the Visigothic period. It was also in this period that the first documented anti-Judaic persecution took place. Other episodes of persecution would happen again and again during the long troubled history of the Jewish people in Iberia and culminated with the Decrees of Expulsion and the establishment of the Inquisition: some Jews converted to Catholicism while others resisted and were forcedly baptized, becoming the first Iberian Crypto-Jews. In the 18th century the official discrimination and persecution carried out by the Inquisition ended and several Jewish communities emerged in Portugal. From a populational genetics point of view, the worldwide Diaspora of contemporary Jewish communities has been intensely studied.

The prevalent view claims Yiddish has a German origin, whereas the opposing view posits a Slavic origin with strong Iranian and weak Turkic substrata. One of the major difficulties in deciding between these hypotheses is the unknown geographical origin of Yiddish speaking Ashkenazic Jews (AJs). An analysis of 393 Ashkenazic, Iranian, and mountain Jews and over 600 non-Jewish genomes demonstrated that Greeks, Romans, Iranians, and Turks exhibit the highest genetic similarity with AJs. The Geographic Population Structure analysis localized most AJs along major primeval trade routes in northeastern Turkey adjacent to primeval villages with names that may be derived from âAshkenaz.â Iranian and mountain Jews were localized along trade routes on the Turkeyâs eastern border. Loss of maternal haplogroups was evident in non-Yiddish speaking AJs. Our results suggest that AJs originated from a Slavo-Iranian confederation, which the Jews call âAshkenazicâ (i.e., âScythianâ), though these Jews probably spoke Persian and/or Ossete. This is compatible with linguistic evidence suggesting that Yiddish is a Slavic language created by Irano-Turko-Slavic Jewish merchants along the Silk Roads as a cryptic trade language, spoken only by its originators to gain an advantage in trade. Later, in the 9th century, Yiddish underwent relexification by adopting a new vocabulary that consists of a minority of German and Hebrew and a majority of newly coined Germanoid and Hebroid elements that replaced most of the original Eastern Slavic and Sorbian vocabularies, while keeping the original grammars intact.

This study included 82 North Africans, aged 18-64 years. Perceived discrimination was measured at both group level (PGD) and personal level (PPD). The physical health indicator was blood pressure. The mental health indicator was self-reported psychological distress. Multiple regression analyses showed that higher levels of PGD predicted higher blood pressure. PPD was not related to blood pressure. PPD was positively related to psychological distress among women, but not among men. PPD and PGD are associated with physical and mental health indicators in different ways among North African women and men in France.

This steppe underwent significant degradation in the eighties. The combination of severe droughts, the most important of the century, with a peak between 1982-1987 and 2000-2005 and an exponential increase in livestock had a catastrophic impact on pastoral resources. The \"alfa\" (Stipa tenacissima), an emblematic species of these arid lands, what was called \"sea to alfa\" is now disappearing. Vegetation cover, which was more than 30% before 1980, is now less than 15%. Concerning the phytomasse, the aboveground dry matter production which exceeds 1ton ha-1 in 1980, is now less than 480 kg.ha-1. At the same time, the agricultural areas in the steppe area, previously marginal, are steadily increasing and reaching several million hectares. This cereal production takes place to the detriment of natural ranges with very low yields (less than 5 quintals per hectare). In response to this deterioration, the North African governments, from the seventies defined different strategies to manage and restore the ecosystems. These ones, based on a socio-economic approach were in summary: (1) To increase pastoral and agricultural production; (2) to reduce livestock; (3) to combine the first two. Several options were considered. The main ones were planting, collecting water for livestock and agriculture and finally installing exclosures. Agro-forestry plantations were carried out with different species, particularly the genus Atriplex, Medicago and Opuntia. Small hydraulic entities were also built to increase the planted area. The exclosures were established on millions of acres. We discuss the relevance and success rate of these works. The economics and biological impacts (biodiversity, production) are assessed. As a result, the government's strategies are not coherent and sometimes seem at odds with the objectives of combating desertification.

Although high diabetes prevalence is documented in Israeli Arabs, information from cohort studies is scant. Methods This is a population study, based on information derived between 2007â2011, from the electronic database of the largest health fund in Israel, among Arabs and Jews. Prevalence, 4-year-incidence and diabetes hazard ratios [HRs], adjusted for sex and the metabolic-syndrome [MetS]-components, were determined in 3 age groups (<50 years, 50â59 years, and â¥60 years). Results The study cohort included 17,044 Arabs (males: 49%, age: 39.4Â±17.3) and 16,012 Jews (males: 50%, age: 40.5 Â±17.6). The overall age and sex-adjusted diabetes prevalence rates were much higher among Arabs 18.4% (95%CI: 17.6â19.1); and 10.3% (95%CI: 9.7â10.9) among Jews. Arab females had higher prevalence rates 20.0% (95%CI: 19â21) than Arab males 16.7% (95%CI: 15.7â17.8). Annual incidence rates were also significantly higher among Arabs 2.9% (95%CI: 2.7â3.1) than among Jews 1.7% (95%CI: 1.6â1.8). This held true across all age and sex subgroups. Adjustment for body mass index [BMI] attenuated HR estimates associated with Arab ethnicity across all age subgroups, mainly in the <50yrs age group from HR 2.04 (95%CI: 1.74â2.40) to 1.64 (95%CI: 1.40â1.92). BMI at incident diabetes among females was higher in Arabs than Jews. Males, however, did not differ by ethnicity. Conclusion Arabs, mainly female, have high incidence and prevalence of diabetes. This excess risk is only partially explained by the high prevalence of obesity. Effective culturally-congruent diabetes prevention and treatment and an effective engagement partnership with the Arab community are of paramount need.

Such fluvial supply is suggested to come from paleodrainage networks that were reactivated by intensified monsoon precipitation during the AHP. The supply is characterized by high Mg/Al and smectite contents, and has been accompanied by considerable freshwater influx, as indicated by the enhanced grain size and lighter foraminiferal Î´18O. The clay-mineral assemblages in our core and in nearby cores correspond with a provenance from the Libyan-Tunisian margin, mainly via the paleo-river Irharhar. The inferred fluvial discharge is strongest during the late-AHP (â¼8-5.5 ka), coinciding with reported enhanced fluvial dynamics and wettest conditions over western Libya and Tunisia/Algeria. This period is not only synchronous with the largest extension of open-water bodies in North Africa and lowest Saharan dust inputs, but also consistent with precipitation records of the "
