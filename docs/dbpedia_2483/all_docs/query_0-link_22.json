        "text": "to have anymore rabbis in Vilna as a gesture of respect for the greatness of the dead. So from then on the head dayyan became rabbi-like in status, earning the most special place in the synagogue during holy days. While the poor Jews, amongst them wandering Jews, beggars, etc. would come to the synagogue to take part in the prayers, my grandfather who could have gone to the best seat would join the poor so they would not feel themselves inferior.\n\nSymbolic to his personality was the way he died: for many, many years, day after day he would sit in his narrow room with the door closed, studying when finally it affected him and he became sick with pneumonia. The doctor suggested he should take a vacation in Crimea, but he refused to listen to him. Many days he was very stubborn about not going, explaining that the long voyage to Crimea, which he would have to ride on a train for days, would take time from his Talmud studies. And what kind of life would he have if he were denied the studies of the Torah?\n\nFinally he couldnt take the begging of his wife and other family members and he went on his way. When the train arrived in Crimea, they found my grandfather lifeless. We never knew whether he died when arrived there or during the travels.\n\nI only met my maternal grandfather in the last years of his life when I stayed with him for a few weeks in Vilna on the way to Germany. In any case it is very clear to me that I inherited my intellectual base from him.\n\nFrom my paternal grandfathers side, where I grew up and where I was educated in the first years of my life, I received other gifts that were no less important. My paternal grandfather was not an intellectual type but a very practical man. He had many children, most of them girls. The days when I was there they were not yet married so they took a large part in my education. I was the only grandson who lived at the house and this fact stood in direct correlation to the amount of spoiledness that I received. All the memories that I have from those days have not even a hint of unpleasantness and I believe that the tranquility and harmony of the first years of my life gave me the self-confidence that I was blessed with. That, more than any part of my personality, has aided me in my political activities later on.\n\nAlready in my early childhood there were signs of my mature personality. I clearly remember many tricks that I pulled that might have been an _expression of my need to lead, and my need to organize and take charge of things. Those early deeds that I used my friends to help me carry out, many times today seem to me to not have been in the best taste. But I remember that then I used to make them a little less sharp since I would always take all responsibility on myself without a moment of hesitation, in all the things my friends and I would do. To be truthful, I must admit that in most cases it didnt take a lot of bravery or self-sacrifice, as the grandson of a person who was the only doctor in town and for many years was the head of the Jewish community there. Already I received special treatment.\n\nI remember one Saturday when I created a huge mess in the synagogue when I entered the synagogue riding my big St. Bernard dog. It was huge and very scary although truly he had a very good nature. But the people praying must have thought it to be a horrible, wild dog who was coming to tear them apart. In the womens quarters above, a few women fainted and some of the men ran outside screaming. But all this pandemonium didnt make my dog change his stoic essence. He kept walking slowly and self-assuredly through the synagogue until we reached my grandfathers seat in the first row. However, even that deed, which was absolutely blasphemous and so shocking that people talked about it for many years, I survived without much punishment.\n\nIn town my reputation was of a boy who appeared older than his age. For some health reasons I missed many days of cheder studies, but this did not affect my education since I was very quick and clever. It was enough for me to have private lessons of an hour or two to catch up to my friends who studied eight to ten hours a day. So the basic Jewish education I received mostly from my grandfather and a few tutors, amongst them the rabbi of the town [ed: Rabbi Perlman Margolis]. This rabbi later on went to Eretz Israel and when I had my bar mitzvah he sent me a letter from there where he described an episode from my days in the cheder of Vishnevo. This episode is descriptive not only of the way I thought but also it is a perfect example of Talmudic thinking. As my former teacher wrote in his letter, while he was discussing with the class the dream of Yakov where there was a passage saying that the angels of god (this was when I was 4) go up and down, I could not in my logic let myself accept such a sentence and I argued that the angels of God are in heaven so how can they go up before they go down? They must first go down and only then go up. The rabbi said that this question bothered him for years and he investigated this passage in all the different sources hoping to find reasonable answers since illogic has no place in the logical Torah.\n\nTypical of religious people he could not accept the idea that it was just a phrase that people might say casually, without any real thought. Up and down. It was symbolic of a nation that for hundreds of years had been raised on the Talmudic analytical, logical basis in which no coincidences could occur.\n\nWithout getting into a deep psychological study, its very clear for me today when I look back that all the signs of my character were already taking roots in me in those days would become extremely important in helping me decide what paths to take. When I think of it, everything I achieved was done without cries or yells, but through careful persuasion instead. As a child, for example, I received special permission that let me stay with the older people until late night hours. For many months, later on, I would argue against what I saw as the punishment that I had to go early to my bed. I grew up with adults and I loved listening to their conversations at evening time, and I hated, as all children do, to go to sleep hours before the adults. All the scenes that I created at that point didnt change that rule, and at the end I realized that there was a more useful way to work this out. As a child who was traditionally educated, my duty was to do a kryatchma when I was going to bed. So I used this rule, saying that I would not pray this prayer before I felt a true need to sleep. This stubbornness brought my wished results, and from then on they let me stay until I was ready to say the prayer. This experience made it clear to me that what I couldnt do with fighting and stubbornness I achieved with a little bit of politics. This incident also made me richer with another bit of knowledge: religious thoughts cannot be forced upon you, and even more important, that prayer only has meaning if it is said with free will.\n\nI was very lucky that my very first years, when the soul is still open to receive impressions from the environment, unlike other times in the life, passed in a house filled with pleasantness and warmth, surrounded by good natured and generous people. When I think today about my grandfathers house I cannot decide who had the best nature among all the family members. All of them, my grandfather, grandmother, my aunts who took care of me with serenity and devotion, and never-ending pleasantness seemed to me to be true angels. I am very sure that the lack of suspicion and the need to help people, two character traits that were strong in me when I became an adult, were rooted in those first years. The feeling of confidence and safety that is so rooted in me might somehow be connected to the fact that my family then already thought that I would do great deeds in my life. They even asked the rabbi of the town to put special care in my education and development.\n\nAfter I left my dear ones to join my parents in Germany I never saw them again. The First World War and the Revolution in Russia brought separation to many families. All my family members died before I could meet them again. Still, their memory is deeply rooted in my heart and my soul and I am very thankful for all that they gave me. Those dear people created the soil where I could take root and receive happiness and warmth and safety no matter what the future would bring. I am absolutely sure if my parents had taken me to Germany as soon as they had left I would lack this treasure that only life in a shtetl could bring. And once again I will emphasize that the spiritual climate of the Lithuanian shtetl Vishnevo was a very important element of establishing my character..... I will post the entire article in Vishnevo stories.\n\n.\n\n- Tuesday, May 06, 2003 at 19:13:12 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n.....Byelorussia's Jewish population numbered almost 1.1 million on the eve of the German invasion. In fact, many of Byelorussia's largest cities - Minsk, Vitebsk, Mogilev, Gomel, Bobruisk, Orsha - had Jewish majorities. The invading Germans began the murder of Byelorussian Jews soon after their arrival. Jews who were not killed during the initial operations were forced to move into ghettos. These ghettos were systematically liquidated from the fall of 1941 to the fall of 1943. German authorities a lso accused the Jews of being the driving force behind the Soviet partisan movement, whose members began to operate in growing numbers behind German lines in the spring of 1942. For example, Wilhelm Kube, the Commissar General for White Ruthenia, equated Jews with partisans in the same report in which he proudly told his superiors about the murder of 55,000 Byelorussian Jews during a ten-week period in the spring and summer of 1942. (3) Most Nazi crimes in Byelorussia, particularly the murder of Byelorussian Jewry, were committed by mobile forces. Units belonging to two of Heydrich's Einsatzgruppen - A and B - were operating in Byelorussia. They received assistance from regular German police battalions and Waffen-SS units. To be sure, some of the Einsatzgruppen headquarters became stationary at the end of 1941 for the purpose of establishing an SS/police structure in the occupied Soviet Union. Yet, the occupiers' killing opera tions never really lost their mobile character throughout the occupation owing to the expanse of the areas to which these forces were assigned. After the war, members of the Einsatzgruppen were the subjects of several trials, most notably that of Otto Oh lendorf and 20 other officers before a U.S. military tribunal from July 1947 to April 1948. (4) Beginning in 1950 West German courts also tried Einsatzgruppen men. (5) In addit ion to the courts, historians also began to investigate the Einsatzgruppen and publish their findings. (6)\n\nWhile the history of the Einsatzgruppen is by now well-documented, the same cannot be said for most of the indigenous units who assisted the Germans in the murder of Soviet Jews and gentiles. Some - like the Arjas Commando, the Kaminsky Brigade an d the SS unit \"Druzhina\" - have attained great notoriety. However, historians have paid little attention to the large numbers of lesser-known indigenous \"security\" forces without which the Germans would have encountered greater difficulty in liquidating entire ghettos and staging massive murder and pillage operations disguised as anti-partisan actions. The Germans established two types of local units: the Schutzmannschaft and the Ordnungsdienst. The forme r generally operated in areas under civilian administration and fell within the SS/police command structure; the latter was established in army and army group rear areas and placed under the authority of local and district military commanders. Historians have only recently begun to study the Schutzmannschaften and the Ordnungsdienst. (7) .....

Six million Jews were killed in the Nazi Holocaust. Poland's pre-war Jewish community of 3.5 million was reduced to 300,000.\n\nOrganizers of the march, which was part of Holocaust Remembrance Day, said there were fewer marchers than in recent years due to security concerns over the recent war in Iraq.\n\nThe event also marked the 60th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, which has become a symbol of Jewish resistance against rule by Nazi Germany. On April 19, 1943, Jewish fighters launched a desperate last stand against German occupying forces to resist looming deportations to death camps. They held off the Nazis for several weeks with homemade explosives. Also marching was Norman Frejman, 72, who as a child survived the Warsaw Ghetto, deportation to the Majdanek death camp and slave labor in Germany. \"God wanted me to survive: All my family perished either in the Warsaw Ghetto or in the camps. I am getting old, so I had to come here to see it once again. This is hallowed ground, because the ashes of Jews are scattered here,\" he said.\n\n\"I also wanted to attend the 60th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. This is very near to me,\" said Frejman, who left for the United States after the war and lives in Florida.\n\nHolocaust Remembrance Day is marked on a different day each year because it is linked to the 27th day of the Hebrew month of Nisan, when the uprising began. In Israel, sirens brought the country to a standstill for a two-minute silence and flags were at half-mast for the memorial.\n\n.\n\n- Tuesday, April 29, 2003 at 09:00:28 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://www.thejewishexchange.com/images/holidays/yomhashoah/sixmillion.html?source=tea Jewish Exchange Holocaust Presentation\n\n(IsraelNN.com) The Jewish Exchange offers Internet viewers a Holocaust Day presentation, a time for reflection\n\nclick here for the Holocaust Presentation\n\n- Tuesday, April 29, 2003 at 08:17:02 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWisznevo/Vishnevo was part of Poland between 1921 and 1939;\n\nPoland emerged as a bourgeois republic under the influence of the great revolutionary movement which swept the whole of Eastern and Central Europe in the years 1917-19. Although the reborn state did not solve the basic economic and social questions, its legislation granted equal rights to all citizens irrespective of nationality and religious convictions. This was guaranteed by its constitution adopted by the Sejm in March 1921 . Thus were abolished the legal norms inherited from the partitioning powers, which gave different legal status to various groups of society. However some questions as laid down in the constitution lent themselves to various interpretations. In 1931 the Sejm passed a law which abrogated expressis verbis all regulations which were discriminatory on grounds of religion, nationality and race. In this respect independent Poland fulfilled the people's hopes. The matter was different in the field of economic relations. In the inter-war period Poland found herself in an extremely difficult situation. Leaving aside the fluctuations of economic development experienced by all capitalist countries (a particularly deep drop in production, employment and incomes was noted in the first half of the 1930's), the average increase in the number of places of work was far behind the population growth. Overpopulation of the countryside became more acute, which in turn brought about the shrinking of the internal market and the resultant impoverishment of petty tradesmen and craftsmen. Unemployment in towns took on catastrophic dimensions. In these circumstances, especially in the 1930's, the pauperization of those strata which earned their living from small shops increased. Economists spoke of the overcrowding of trade and crafts. According to the 1931 census of the nearly 32 million Polish citizens, 10 per cent (or some three million) were Jews. Of this figure 42 per cent worked in industry, mining and crafts and 36 per cent in trade and kindred branches. Other occupations played a lesser role in the Jews, occupational structure. In some branches of the economy Jews constituted a majority. This concerned above all the retail trade where 71 per cent of all tradesmen were Jewish. In the clothing and leather industry this percentage was almost 50. Typical Jewish occupations were tailoring and shoemaking. However in the conditions of massive unemployment, in spite of the over abundance of certain specialties in crafts, they had no chance of finding employment. At the same time there was a growth in the number of merchants and craftsmen of other nationalities. In the countryside, the expanding cooperative movement became a serious rival to the private merchants. It would be wrong to assume that the concentration of Jews in certain branches of the economy and their pauperization were the result of a deliberate policy on the part of the state. It is true that the administration was unfavorably disposed towards employing other than Polish nationals in state enterprises, especially those of military importance (for example railways and armaments factories) and therefore removed Jews from these establishments. However, the direct reason for anti-Jewish discrimination has to be sought in the past, in the relations which had been formed in the period of the partitions. The overcoming of the traditional occupational and social structure of the Jewish community could be accomplished only by the acceleration of the economic development of the country as a whole and also by the creation of conditions favoring the acquiring of new trades which had not been popular among the Jewish community. This problem was also perceived by some Jewish organizations which undertook actions aimed at training young people in various specialties. This was done most often by the Zionist organizations which in connection with their Palestinian plans attempted to prepare groups of settlers having definite trades. However the scope of this action was very modest indeed since it depended on winning financial means as well as those willing to go to Palestine. Similar undertakings could not be carried out on a mass scale without appropriate assistance from the state in a situation where the government found it difficult to acquire sufficient financial resources for the most urgent needs. What is more, even if money had been available, the specialists trained in this way would not have been able to find employment anyway.\n\nThe same objective reasons made it impossible to overcome the concentration of Jewish laborers in small enterprises and workshops, while it should be borne in mind that over 70 per cent of the Jewish urban proletariat were employed in such small establishments.\n\nThis adverse situation was also affected by some traditional customs and religion. Since Jews observed Sabbath, it was difficult to employ in one enterprise both Jewish and Christian workers without disorganizing the rhythm of production. Even Jewish entrepreneurs unwillingly employed a Jewish labor force. Of course not all of them were Orthodox Jews and not all of them refused to work on Saturdays. However those who wanted to work on Saturdays were treated with suspicion by their employers who feared lest they belonged to a socialist or communist organization and one day might organize the factory work force in struggle for their interests. In smaller establishments, in which the owner himself took part in both the production process and management, work on Saturdays was suspended. The Jewish question in inter-war Poland was above all a social problem. Without solving the problems which were common to all working people, there was no chance of changing the lot of the Polish Jews. And the capitalist system provided no prospect of a radical overcoming of backwardness and increasing the number of jobs, despite efforts on the part of the state undertaken in particular in the second half of the 1930's.\n\nThus emigration continued. There are no exhaustive data on this subject. However, it is known that between 1927 and 1938 nearly 200,000 Polish Jews left Poland, of which number 74,000 went to Palestine, 34,000 to Argentina and 28,000 to the United States. The largest waves of emigration were recorded in the 1920's. Following the great slump, after 1929, those countries which up till then accepted immigrants, introduced new, ever more severe restrictions on immigration. This concerned, among other countries, the United States. For this reason in the 1930's overseas emigration limited in scope while the number of those going to Palestine increased. According to the most reliable calculations, between 1919 and 1942 almost 140,000 Polish Jews went to Palestine, that is, some 42 per cent of the total number of immigrants accepted by that country; the largest intensification of Palestine-bound emigration took place in the years 1933-36 when the number of emigrants amounted to 75,000.\n\nIn the difficult economic situation and the changes in legal and political status of Jews after Poland had regained her independence, various programs of activity were formed. The traditional program of the Agudat Israel, which boiled down to the observance of religious prescriptions, loyalty towards the state and the expectation of the Kingdom of God, could not suffice. Although the position of this party among the petite bourgeoisie was maintained by the authority of the zaddikim (a particularly important role in the leadership of the Agudat Israel was played by the famous zaddik of Gora Kalwaria who was however criticized by many), its attempts at consolidating a specific kind of ideological ghetto (the isolation of the Jews from the goyim) resulted in a gradual decrease of its influence. Step by step the party moved towards the acceptance of the prospect of building a Jewish state in Palestine.\n\nOn the other hand, the influence of the workers' parties continued to be strong. The most important role was still played by the Bund, some concepts of which were close to those of the radical left wing, though its members represented a whole variety of views. The Bund differed from the program put forward by the communists in that it demanded cultural and national autonomy for national minorities, especially for the Jews, and perceived the necessity of organizing the whole of the Jewish proletariat in one, separate national party. Many Bund leaders saw the need for dictatorship by the proletariat (the Bund program adopted in 1930 mentioned the possibility of such dictatorship). The party was decidedly opposed to the conservatives and discarded religion. It accused the Agudat Israel of defending the interests of the propertied classes to the detriment of the needs of the masses. The most outstanding leaders of the Bund were Victor Alter (1890-1941), Henryk Erlich (1882- 1941) and Samuel Zygelbojm (1895-1943).\n\nThe Bund, like the illegal Communist Party of Poland to which many Jews also belonged and the Polish Socialist Party, saw the only chance of solving the Jewish question in Poland in building a socialist society without man's exploitation by man. It sought its allies among workers of all nationalities living in Poland. It opposed all concepts of emigration since it perceived the impracticability of the idea of organizing emigration of a several million strong nation. The socialist leaders considered the Palestinian campaign to be an element weakening the forces of the proletariat fighting for a change in social relations and as a solution which at best could constitute a chance for only few.\n\nA radical social program was also voiced by the left wing of the Po'alei Zion which saw prospects for the Jews in a socialist revolution and in introducing cultural and national autonomy. For the future, it accepted the idea of building a socialist Jewish state in Palestine and therefore it supported the Palestinian campaigns. Its leading members were Antoni Budhsbaum, Szachna Sagan and Jozef Witkin-Zerubavel (1876-1912). A much smaller following was enjoyed by the right wing of the Po'alei Zion which concentrated above all on Palestinian works, that is all activity aimed at forming. a future Jewish state, including education of qualified farmers, workers and soldiers.\n\nAll the workers, organizations, irrespective of the differences that separated them, cooperated in many important issues. They undertook a common struggle against campaigns organized by the right wing of the National Democratic Party. In Warsaw they even formed an underground organization the task of which was to put up armed resistance to the nationalist militants. Both Jews and Poles connected with the workers, movement took part in its work. http://members.core.com/~mikerose/history2.htm\n\nClick for the rest\n\n- Sunday, April 27, 2003 at 16:02:42 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSlownik Geograficzny Entry\n\nOszmiana powiat OSZMIANA PROVINCE (Powiat)- Lying within Wilno gubernia, it borders with Lida province on the west, on the northwest with Wilno, on the northeast with Swiecian province, to the east with Wilia province as well as Minsk gubernia, which borders it for equal distances on the southeast and east. The province contains 2,727 square miles (another count has it at 2,696 square miles) of which there are 1,742,800 acres in total; 69,550 acres (4%) in settlements, 490,460 arable acres (28.1%), 153,650 acres of (grazable) moors (8.8%), 194,400 acres pasturage and meadow (11.2%), 727,300 acres of forests (41.7%), and 107,400 acres barrens or water bodies (6.2%). In 1859, 385,290 acres belonged to the government (22.1%), 5,087 acres to towns (.3%), 6,720 acres to Orthodox and Catholic churches (.4%), with the remaining 1,345,500 acres in private hands (77.2%). In the northern part of the province, the topography is elevated and hilly, occasioned by the [ed.-- morainal] hill chain Awratyn. The highest locations are found near the villages Topiszki (1175 feet above sea level), Lojce (1049'), Donkni (766'), Widnopol estate (729' asl.) and the town of Jewie (610' asl.). The southern part in the Berezina river basin is lowlands, marshes and covered in forest. The central part consists of evenly rolling hills. Soils in the northern part are clayey or sandy; in the south marshy and humic. Bog-iron mines are found in the marshy lowlands, with especially rich deposits in the vicinity of Naliboki and Wisznew where deposits contain up to 50% iron. Oszmiana province, having the highest topography in the entire gubernia near Wilno, is very poorly endowed with lakes with none very large. Some of the most important are: Dub, Dubina, Kroman, and Reczuny, \"The Swamp\", as well as many small ones in the southern part of the province contributing to the notable Purwilski Marsh, out of which flows the Purvil river in turn contributing to the Olszanka River. The Wilia River flows from this same area to the northwestern border, and is the largest in Oszmiana province. The Nieman River flows along the southwestern border, fed by the Berezina, the Olszanka, the Wolozyn, and Isloch, Usze, and the Sutle tributaries. Towards the western border, the Zyzma flows into the Gawia which itself originates from the Klewa River (the Gawia emptying into the Nieman). In 1880, there were 162,285 inhabitants in the province [ed.-- unclear if the statistics include the town of Oszmiana which had special privileges], broken down as follows: 5,749 gentry, 287 clergy of all faiths, 69 honorary [ed.- major or titled?] landowners, 22,827 townspeople, 128,011 peasants, 5,084 military men, 220 foreigners, and 38 of uncertain status. By religion, there were 50,440 Orthodox, 891 Roskolnikovs (Old Believers), 99,020 Catholics, 162 Evangelicals (Protestants), 11,131 Jews, and 641 Moslems. In 1859 there were 128,666 inhabitants in the province (60,515 men and 63,547 women), counting 27,394 White Russian Orthodox, 20,650 Catholic Poles, 62,571 Catholic Lithuanians, and 2,527 Lithuanian Orthodox. In 1871, 142,688 inhabitants; in 1875, 152,261; and in 1878, 156,218. According to 1858 tax receipts, there were 15,425 horses [ed.--registered breeding horses?], 38,873 horned cattle, 18,911 common sheep, 8,974 specialty sheep, 7,980 plow or work horses, and 20,636 pigs, which comes to .19 animals per acre. The population is a mixture of Lithuanians and White Russians. The predominant language of the inhabitants is changing from Polish to White Russian, with additionally incorporated Lithuanian expressions. The most recent province administration consists of four (state) police districts: Zuprany, Smorgon, Dziewieniszki, and Wolozyn. There are 2 peacetime (civil) courts for peasant legal affairs at Oszmiana and Poloczany; 4 districts for performance of military obligations in Oszmiana, Smorgon, Subotniki, and Wolozyn; 3 District Inquiry Courts, with bureau offices in Oszmiana, (G)Holszany, and Smorgon, namely the 4th-tier District Circuit of Lida for 8 gminas, and three district review boards at Smorgon for the rest of the gminas. The province is further composed of 23 gminas: Polany, Soly, Holszany, Grauzyszki, Kucewicze (1st police district); Smorgon, Bienica, Krewo, Poloczany and Horodzki (2nd police district); Dziewieniszki, Subotniki, Lipniszki, Siedliszcze, Iwie, Lugomowicze, Traby, Juratiszki (3rd police district); and Wolozyn, Wiszniew, Naliboki, Derewno, and Bakszty (4th police district). Those gminas are broken down into 142 rural districts (sheriffs domains), 1,353 villages and other residential units, and 12,340 huts or cabins. The following are identified towns within the province: (1st police district) Slobodka, Zuprany, Soly, Holszany, Oszmiana Murowana, Boruny and Grauzyszki; (2nd police district) Zaskiewicze, Bienica, Smorgon, and Krewo; (3rd police district) Subotniki, Lipniszki, Konwaliszki, Gieranony, Hermaniszki, Dziewieniszki, Trobiele, Iwie, Mikolajow, Dudy, Lazduny, Traby, Surwiliszki, and Juratishki; (4th police district) Wolozyn, Wiszniew, Slowiensk, Zabrzez, Derewno, and Naliboki. The chief occupations of the inhabitants are mainly agriculture and lumbering with transportation down the Berezina. Industrial fabrication is poorly represented. Of the industrial facilities, the one notable exception is the iron foundry of Prince Witgenstein in Naliboki [ed.- Kletistche, destroyed in World War II], manufacturing various forged and cast iron products with an annual revenue of 44,025 rubles. Other factories worth mentioning: a pottery factory at Krewo, and wool products made at Holszany (belts, stockings, and socks).\n\nRegarding churches: Oszmiana province is divided into the two Orthodox deaconates of Oszmiana and Wolozyn, the first of which contains 14 parishes: Oszmiana, Smorgon (two-- the Transfiguration of Christ and St. Michael), Bienica, Krewo (two: Holy Trinity and St. Alexander Nevsky) Zalesie, Losk, Holszany, Traby, Cycyn, Juratiski, Sutkowo, and Michalowszczyzna.

In all there are 65,110 parishioners in the Wiszniew deaconate. Formerly, there were also parish churches in Losku, Wolozyn, and Horodzilowie.\n\nConcerning central communications linkages in the northern part of the province, there is the Lipawa [ed.- today Lith. Klaipeda]-Roniny rail line with stations at Soly, Smorgon, and Zalesie. Postal roads take one from Soly station through Oszmiana and Holszany to Subotniki; from Holszany station to Wolozyn; from the town of Smorgon to Wojstom station (in Swiecian province), as well as from Smorgon to the town of Krewo. Postal stations are at Oszmiana, Smorgon, Subotniki, Soly, Wolozyn, Holszany, Iwie, and Krewo. The Oszmiana provincial coat-of-arms, confirmed in the Ukaze of June 9, 1845, exhibits an escutcheon divided into two fields, on the higher the symbol of Wilno gubernia represented by a Lithuanian blazon on a black field, and in the lower a bear on a blue field.\n\nThe provincial Marshals of Oszmiana before the Partitions were (in alphabetical order): Ludwig Jacob Chominski, h.

I worked there baking bread for the Germans and from there I was transferred to the army camp in Podberze. Together with me all the time there was another Vishnevan girl by the name of Chana Podversky, the daughter of Itza-Lebl Podversky. The usual procedure was that every Sunday we would go home and the German commandant treated us almost like a father. He had six daughters and he always emphasized that fact and loved to converse with us. Most of the times when we would go home he would drive us in his car so he could take some food supplies for my family. At more than one occasion he entered our home and saw with his own eyes the suffering of my parents. With tears in their eyes they begged him to save me and my sister Raisel. He promised he would do whatever he could. On that awful Sunday he also took us as usual to our house and as we neared the gate of the ghetto, we saw thousands of Christians gathering around one of the homes. We also saw a dark haze and smoke reaching up to the skies, and there were screams. At first we thought it was some Christian person who had died, and my friend and I whispered to each other, \"They deserve it\" or something like this. But when we came closer to the ghetto gate, a Christian woman stopped the car and screamed as loud as she could, \"In the name of God, get out of here. In town they are slaughtering everyone.\"\n\nThe commandant and the soldier said to us, \"Immediately get out of the car and run to your work place. We will go inside the gate and see what is happening there.\" When they returned they told us that when they arrived there the SS people who were surrounding the town forced them to take part in the annihilation and the killing of all the Jews of the town. And that was not all; they ordered them to bring us there, and if they didnt the commandant would be punished. The soldier who was with him the entire day witnessing the torture told us what he saw with tears in his eyes. From all the awful sights he saw he now was vomiting and had diarrhea the entire day. The commandant immediately told us he would not give us up no matter what. He suggested that for this night we sleep there but early in the morning we must run to one of the Christians that we knew and he would keep in touch with us. We did as he told us and we reached the Christian man and hid in his house for a few days but when things became more dangerous since the SS troops looked for us everywhere including where we worked, and in the sheds, and in the place we were hiding. It was a miracle they didnt find us. So he transferred us to a Polish womans house where we hid for 6 weeks. At the end the Christian man made a communication between us and the Jews from Kerve who would go to work in Bogdonova. Since now the Jews of Vishnevo were annihilated and a few others went to the forest. So now they were replaced in Bogdonova.\n\nNow he told us that at one time when they returned from work to Kerve, they should take us with them. The person who drove them was a Jew named Shlomo Horwitz, a native of Kerve, who now lives in Farvitkin (1970). Shlomo Horwitz did as he was told and let us go in the car and we arrived in the ghetto of Kerve. I must emphasize that the situation in the ghetto of Kerve was different from that of most of the neighboring towns ghetto. Their commandant truly defended them and he lived in the ghetto. He knew everything that was done and everything they planned to do. They didnt hide anything from him, and he took care of all the people who wanted to annihilate them. Whenever the people above him asked him to annihilate the Jews, he said he needed his Jews because that they still hadnt finished building the roads or the airport that he planned to build near the town. And as others told, the Sunday when the Jews of Vishnevo were annihilated, he was with all his Jews who worked in Bogdonova and Vishnevo, and he was witness to the massacre of the Jews of Vishnevo. He succeeded in saving the lives of his Jews from the SS, claiming that they were very needed workers.\n\nAs soon as he found out about us, and he found out about us immediately since he lived with the Jews in the ghetto, he called us and told us about the destruction of the Jews of our town, and all that he saw with his own eyes. \"You were left alone and orphaned. You must do everything to stay alive so you can tell the future generations to what they did to the Jews of Vishnevo.\" He also told us, while deeply sighing, as if it was his own terrible tragedy, \"I am also an orphan and have been one since I was a little child, with no mother and father, alone in the world. It was only because I had such a strong desire and stubbornness to survive no matter what, that I am alive today.\"\n\nHe knew that people didnt want us in the ghetto, so he ended the conversation by saying, \"I will defend you and find you some shelter.\" He gave us some food supplies and said that we should come to him if we had any trouble. As I said before the fate of the Jews of Kerve was very different from the others, and they did not experience tragedy at that point. But finally, when most of the jobs were done, many were spread out to different working camps. Most went to the camp in Zazmir. At one point we were also sent by the Judenrat of Kerve to this camp instead of two local Jewish guys whose turn it was to be sent. Here there were thousands of people, remnants of ghettoes from Oshmina, Svir, Kerve, and other towns that were destroyed or were waiting to be destroyed. They were busy with paving roads, so Nachamka and I also worked on paving roads. We were barefoot and starving with torn clothes and we worked at this hard labor until we became sick with typhus, which was spreading throughout the camp. After two weeks of very high fever we knew that we would survive and our fever finally broke. Slowly we felt better and again we were sent to work. - Thursday, April 24, 2003 at 10:59:22 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNear the grave of our brothers Noah Podbersky As soon as we returned from the forest as the war concluded we stood somberly by the brotherly tomb that coated the bones of our dear ones and our hearts anguished as if mountains of sorrow were pressing upon them. Echoes of the lament of the tormented and the throes of the demised, our beloved who were snatched to be slaughtered and plowed in your earth, reverberate for generations to come, Vishnevo.\n\nThe blood of our sisters and brothers is howling to us from your land. \"Vow\" shout beloved people and shudder the nations of the world, reiterate and incessantly disclose, hence the mother earth will never forget the deeds of the executioners (hangmen), that the world will never forget what was done us. Will they recall? Will the world retain it? Do the ones who are provided on this day a knife in their grasp bethink this in their heart? Vishnevo, one of thousands of Jewish shtetls that the foe, may his name be erased from all memory, pulled out from its roots, the enemy that shattered you on its way to conquer the world. Here on this narrow footpath, Kerve Street, whose name is emblematic of its essence, the concourse of blood. The Nazis pushed and shoved the next of kin of our kindred while they were bewildered, numbed and almost deceased. They took their last steps holding hands and saying, \"Shma Israel.\" Hero Israel, Adonai is our God, Adonai is One.\n\nAnd here, at the edge of Kerve Street across from you, near the wall of the unfinished building, the wild brutes who feigned to be mankind, put their victims, rows behind rows with their faces to the bulwark, they commanded the beloved to crawl on their knees and here they shot their necks, one after the other and discarded them in the fire. Numerous of them jolting between life and death, and another yet alive. Its a summer day and the world is radiant all around us an the sun is shining and the flowers all shimmering, encompassing us in multitudes of colors, and my heart is dwelling on the ice cap.\n\nThe Nazis torment terminated. We too took certain revenge. But who can meliorate from the torment that the remnants experienced? The vestiges that lost everything that they cherished. Who will heal their wounds? The laceration of the ones who walk solitary in the environ with everlasting anguish in their hearts? A grief that nevermore assuaged with heavy hearts we departed the ossuary and forever said goodbye to our dear ones. How long will this grave linger in its plot? A year? Two years? And then this land would be plowed and all things would be as if it never arise. Hush, my heart. Alive\n\n.\n\n- Thursday, April 24, 2003 at 10:52:01 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen World War II begun in 1939, I was not living in my birthplace, Vishnevo. I resided at the house of my aunt Grunia nee Lubchensky Svirsky, who lived in Svir. Already in 1933 my father transferred me to Svir. My mother was very sick. She became paralyzed. My father wanted to be near her in the hospital in Vilna. She was taken there by my father so she could receive treatment from the finest specialists. My parents decided that to leave me in Vishnevo with just hired help was a bad idea since I was only 4 years old, so they determined that the most suitable place for me would be with my aunt Sonia, a very gracious and loving woman. When I was exactly five years old, on June 28, 1933, my beloved mother passed away. From then on my aunt took a more permanent custody of me. I lived with my aunt, uncle and a cousin of mine by the name of Zelda. Zelda also became orphaned from her mother and also resided in my aunt Grunias house.\n\n1941 I was only 13 years old when the Nazis entered Svir in 1941. In one year I found myself at the mercy of the hand of cruel fate. I became separated from my relatives, in a world filled with the anguish of the days of the Holocaust. I still hadnt experienced much of life and already the main question that I was focused on was \"What will my fate be? Will I find a way out of this trap?\" Constantly, when I stood at Deaths door, I whispered a prayer to my mother in her grave asking her to protect her youngest child from the bitter, brutal environment that encompassed me, from the storm that constantly whispered \"eradication\" to me. The day that Chaim Avramson came to me to write this chapter, the images of days of the Holocaust kept flowing in my head and my eyes became red from the tears. I let my eyes tear without stopping, reasoning that maybe it would bring me some redemption. When there were no more tears and my eyes dried, shivers came to my body, and an electric shock rushed through my limbs when I recalled that era.\n\nI will start my story from the day my cousin Zelda was sent to the labor camp in Zazmir. The Nazis ordered the Judenrat in Svir to send them a hundred Jewish youths to the camp in Zazmir. The Judenrat gave them a list, and amongst the list was the name of Zelda. My uncle and aunt had arranged for a hiding place for Zelda as soon as the Nazis entered Svir. She was hiding in the house of a Christian acquaintance that agreed to take care of her in exchange for a huge amount of merchandise that my aunt and uncle gave him from a store they owned. When Zelda didnt show up in the designated place, the Judenrat threatened my Uncle Zelig Svirsky who was already imprisoned at that point, that he would be sent to Zazmir instead of Zelda. Grunia, who was very confused, decided to bring Zelda back from her hiding place. Zelda went out of the house to the place where all the people who were sent to the work camp were gathering, and when the door was shut behind her, we all stood by the window, watching her go away. All of a sudden, my aunt Grunia started sobbing uncontrollably. \"What did I do by my own hand? I gave her to the killers!\" Then she fell fainting to the ground.\n\nWeeks passed but the Jewish people of the ghettoes were still naïve and hopeful that nothing bad would happen to them, although there were many signs that showed elimination was coming soon. During nights, many of us couldnt sleep, with all asking, \"What will tomorrow bring?\" The young people, the ones who still had some energy and who still had a very strong survival instinct, kept looking for ways to be saved. The situation in the ghetto in Svir was morbid, the prospect of escape was very slim. The ghetto was a tightly shut cage. In spite of the danger, a few were able to arrange for hiding places in the villages around the town. I remember the fall of 1942. One day, when it started getting dark and the ghetto was completely silent, I sat with my uncle Zelig by the lighted oil lamp. I recall how greatly I wished on that awful day to feel his hand petting me and to see his warm _expression when he looked at me. My aunt Grunia was very busy preparing bags. She filled them with food supplies for us to take when at a moments notice we would need to escape. We knew that the most perilous times would arrive. In front of us there was a Torah book. I remember that my uncle kept turning the pages until he reached a passage and he started reading it aloud. \"And your life will be hanging across from you and you will be fearful day and night and you will not believe that you will survive. In the morning you will say, `Who will give me evening? and in the evening you will say `Who will give me morning? And your heart will be fearful from what your eyes will see.\"\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/vishnevo/v_pages/vstories_rasia.html - Thursday, April 24, 2003 at 10:47:31 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSamuel A.

His father was a teacher. Among Unterman's ancestors we find Rabbi Yom Tov Lipman Heller (1579 - 1654), author of the Mishnah commentary Tosefot Yom Tov, and Rabbi Shaul Wahl Katzenellenbogen (1540 - 1616). About him the legend tells that he was elected King of Poland for one day.\n\nAlready in a young age Unterman was known as the \"Illui of Brisk\". In 1898 he was invited to become one of the founding students of Yeshiva Anaf Etz Chaim in Maltsch. For some time he also studied at the Mir Yeshiva, but later returned to Maltsch.\n\nAfter his marriage Unterman continued his studies at the Kollel of the Volozhin Yeshiva where he was ordained. During his studies in Volozhin he opened a Yeshiva in the neighbouring town of Vishnevo. This yeshiva was very successful - even the Hafetz Chaim sent one of his nephews to study there. Unterman developed laryngitis which ended his regular teaching career. He chose the rabbinate. He was appointed rabbi in Mohilna near Minsk. Later he moved to Amstibova.\n\nIn 1923 Unterman was chosen to be rabbi of Liverpool. He immediately learned fluent English and quickly became acclimated to his position. He worked with the youth of the community and united all the Jewish congregations of Liverpool under one umbrella organization. He strengthened the local yeshiva and brought students from Germany and other countries. He also established a Talmud Torah academy in Liverpool.\n\nDuring the air raids of World War II Unterman refused to abandon his post. But he paid regular visits to the members of his congregation which were dispersed among various villages and to Jewish internees of camps for foreigners. Unterman established a home for refugee children outside of Liverpool. In 1946 Unterman was elected Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv-Yafo. As in Liverpool Unterman strengthened Torah institutions and public services like rabbinical courts. He served as a member of the Chief Rabbinate Council. In 1956 he was appointed Chief Rabbi of the State of Israel. He took full advantage of his position and advocated various issues, especially for the understanding between the religious and the secular population.\n\n.\n\n- Friday, April 11, 2003 at 19:44:29 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLea Dodman Country Of Birth Poland\n\nCity Of Birth Vishnevo\n\nDate Of Birth 1/1/1923\n\nHolocaust Period\n\nFramework Of Combat Partisans Country of Combat Lithuania\n\nArea of Combat Rudniki Forest\n\nUnit Battalion Za Pobiedu\n\n.\n\n- Friday, April 11, 2003 at 05:22:41 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI went to my mom's and grabbed a few photos of my grandfather Harry Sigman, naturalized Herman Sigman, born Chaim Benymin Zigman in Vishnevo in 1897 to Shaje Zigman and Lena Scher.

The political circumstances in Poland seemed very volatile. The papers were full of ignominious announcements about the anticipation for the second world war. Poland seemed to be the main territory to be concerned, but we still hoped that everything would pass peacefully and the town as the rest of Poland would continue with its survival. The youth movements Hashomer Hatzair, Poalei-Zion, the League for the Working Eretz Israel, Hachalutz Aoved, Beitar, and others, all were brimming with activities and abundant with energy of youth. The Hebrew school Tarbut with its 8 grades, had 200 students. When the kids graduated, some of them went to Vilna to continue their studies either in high school or schools for teachers, schools for accountants, or mercantile or technical schools. When they returned, they became the intelligentsia of the town and later on, naturally they became the primary recruiting base for Soviet officials (fix).\n\nIn contrast there was also the more traditional Agouda. At the head stood Rabbi Weinstein with a few well-to-do homeowners who were strongly opposed to Zionism. Amongst the people were Moshe Shimshelevicz, Leib son of Kopl, and others. They tirelessly (though with little success) worked against Zionist activities in town. At one point they decided to change the essence of the Tarbut school from a school witch all subjects were instructed in Hebrew only into a old fashion religious school of the Agouda. The Rabbi viciously attacked Tarbut during synagogue meetings but his influence was not strong and the Zionist activities continued. I would like to point out that as soon as the Russians came, Rabbi Weinstein left the town and was successful in crossing the border to Lithuania and from there he was successful in reaching Israel and today he lives in Jerusalem.\n\nAnyway, back to August, 1939. In the midst of our routine disputes between the different ideologies, the war was announced and the Nazis marched towards the border of Poland. The atmosphere became full of anxiety, the morning after the announcement, we already saw the first refugees from Warsaw and Lodz and there were rumors that the Germans were coming near us. From the refugees we promptly heard that the Nazis were terrorizing the Jews as soon as they arrived at Jewish towns and all the Jews in Vishnevo became very fearful. Just at that point we found out about the agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany. The Soviet Union would annex our area we were told. We knew immediately what would happen to the Zionist movement under the USSR. We knew we would not be able to get to Eretz Israel, but we also knew that our lives would not be taken from us. So, no wonder when the rumors came true and the first tanks of the Soviet Union arrived, the entire town came to greet them with flowers in their hands, and everyone was very excited. At the center of the market, a stage was built and the representative of the Jews, Yakov Hirsch Alishkevitch, gathered by a few local Christians, made excited speeches. At the end of Yakovs speech, he said, Long live the Soviet Union! And all of a sudden we were part of the National Socialist Republic of White Russia.......to be continued\n\n.\n\n- Wednesday, March 26, 2003 at 12:55:12 (PST)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/kurenets/k_pix/szyszko/31103_4_b.gif\n\ni would like to thank Nathan Sziszko for a picture he sent me from vishnevo in the 1920s or 1930s.\n\nplease look at the pictures and let me know if you recognize people\n\n- Monday, March 24, 2003 at 16:05:12 (PST)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Mrs. Eilat Levitan,\n\nI found your site on the Internet.

I am ready to offer my services for the realization of plans and wishes of people who are united by mutual interests presented on your site. First of all let me introduce myself. My name is Yuri Dorn. Im the President of the Union of Religious Jewish Congregations of Belarus. This organization comprises more than 13 000 Jews from 19 Belarusian towns. About 12 years ago I started to research Jewish heritage which has preserved until today on the territory of Belarus. I have visited more than 70 towns and stetls where Jews lived earlier. I have gathered the collection of pictures. I also managed to gather a number of memories of local citizens about Jewish life before the Holocaust. During my visits I noted every time that actually Jewish cemeteries, synagogues and places related to the Holocaust came to desolation. It is difficult to realize that Jewish Heritage of Belarus is fading away. However, lately people who are interested in the search of their roots and forefathers memory preservation have begun to visit our country in increasing frequency. Our organization does what one can to help these people in their work during their being in Belarus. We have a wide experience in the field of mutual work on the Jewish cemeteries and Holocaust places restoration.\n\nIn connection with this I would like to apply with your help to everybody who is interested in work in Belarus with the proposal of cooperation. We hope that with mutual efforts we will be able to restore and to preserve our forefathers memory!\n\nSincerely,\n\n(Mr) Yuri Dorn iro@open.by President of URJC of Belarus\n\n.\n\n- Monday, March 24, 2003 at 10:07:53 (PST)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMarch 19, 2003 Shalom Eilat, War is coming tomorrow!\n\nHow did they debate \"WAR\" in Volozhin 89 years ago?\n\nPlease read : The strategy specialists' are debating the results of the oncoming war.\n\nVolozhin during the First World War\n\nBy Reuven Rogovin\n\nTranslated from VYB p. 343, by M. Porat\n\nIt's a pleasure to read Reuven's stories. His memory was phenomenal. His humor was the quintessential Yiddish humor of the Litvak Shtetl's. One could sense in every sentence his great love for his neighbors. Reuven was born in Volozhin in 1905. He recognized the danger that the Jews would be facing under German invasion and was one of the very few Volozhiners who escaped to Russia before the Nazis entered the Shtetl. He survived the war, together with his wife and children in Russia. Part of the time he served as an officer in the Red Army. He left the USSR and made aliya through Poland in 1958. He contributed a great deal to the Volozhin Yizkor Book describing the Shtetl's every day life.\n\nReuven, God bless his soul, passed away in Israel in 1972.\n\nThe strategy specialists' are debating the results of the oncoming war. Page 343\n\nWhen the Austro Hungarian crown prince was killed in Sarajevo, a group of Volozhin Balebatim sat inside the Klayzl-Syngogue discussing the future events. Among them were Fayve der Shnayder (tailor), Oyzer der Raznostshik (mailman), Meyer Peshe Yentes, Naftoli der Eynbinder (book binder). They came to the conclusion that the war would not reach our shtetl and therefore the Volozhin inhabitants should be relaxed.\n\n Russia is mighty and huge. She is entitled to behave as per the Tsar's desire. Russia might lead the war against the Germans in Siberia, against the Avstraks (Austrians) in Caucasus and if so would be her desire she could fight against all her enemies in the large steppes of the Ukraine or in the deserts of Mandjuria. All depends on decisions that would be made by the High Command of the Tsar's army\n\nSuch was the conclusion of Oyzer der Raznostshik, Volozhins most competent \"Strategist\". Nahumke Telzer, the Yeshiva man, who during the debate was reading a book, lifted his head abruptly and said:\n\nRabeyssay (my masters), Please let me tell you a true story.\n\nThe audience became attentive and Reb Nahumke initiate his tale:\n\nA Jew, a very poor tenant farmer had six very ugly and loathsome daughters. Due to their homeliness it was impossible to find bridegrooms for them. One day a shadkhn (Matchmaker) arrived in the lessee's home with exiting news. I have an excellent party for your eldest (Who was the ugliest) daughter, but I cannot reveal the bridegroom's name fearing very much your anger. The Jew swore on his Peysses and beard that nothing evil would happen to the shadkhn after the name was told. The shadkhn became courageous and exposed the secret: The suggested bridegroom is none other but the sole son of count Tishkevith, the Volozhin region's very rich land and forests owner. The lessee became very angry hearing to whom his daughter was indicated to be a bride. It could never be. He said, I would never let my daughter convert to Christianity. The shadkhn left the lessee's house empty handed. But the proposed Shiduch began to settle in the lessee's head. His wife too was insisting, maybe its worth accepting the proposition. We would become rich; it's not a joke to have a count as our daughter's father-in-law. It would greatly improve and probably totally alter our financial status. The lessee called the shadkhn and told him:\n\nAfter experiencing difficult internal conflicts I decided to give my daughter as a wife to the son of the count.\n\nBeautiful, answered the shadkhn, now we have to get to the next step, your agreement alone is not enough, now we should obtain the count's and his son's agreement. And the moral of this story is, continued Reb Nokhemke, You claim that as per her desire Russia would be able to lead the fights in Ukraine, in Mandjuria or wherever she would choose, but did you already obtain Germany's and Austria's approval? Are you sure that they would agree to lead the battles in those places, precisely?\n\n.\n\n- Wednesday, March 19, 2003 at 16:00:52 (PST)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies (IAJGS) is\n\npleased to announce its first Genealogical Cruise, a unique opportunity to\n\ncombine a terrific Jewish genealogy learning experience with a memorable\n\ncruise.

We have read the books, seen the pictures, and more important, we have heard the stories at home from eye witnesses about the horrors that were perpetrated here to our families.\n\nWe have come here to our own personal valley of death, to Dolhinov, so that you could show us for the first time, and maybe the last, those same places that we grew up hearing about throughout our childhood and from which we imbibed the true value of Zionism that we have all acquired, that same value that motivated and drove us to achieve excellence in various units in the army whether as ordinary soldiers, fighters or as commanders.\n\nDespite the fact that we are all past the age of army service, this journey is meant to add fuel to the flame that burns within each one of us in order to preserve it and pass on the torch to the next generation, so that they will be able to understand the meaning of our lives especially in Eretz Jisrael, with all the difficulties we face.\n\nI want to thank my uncle Shlomke Shamgar for the hair-raising stories he told while we stood at the mass graves, of the direct and indirect responsibility of the local population as to what happened here. I fully identify with him.\n\nIn a few days time we will take off in a white plane with blue stripes painted on its body and the star of David on its tail, flown by an Israeli pilot, and, when its wheels are withdrawn from this cursed land, whose rivers are flowing with the blood of our dear ones, we will feel, at least some of us, a certain satisfaction at leaving behind us the murderers and their offspring, steeped in their own miserable lives. And we will return to the only place on earth which is our real home.\n\nI cannot conclude these words without thanking Leon Rubin and whoever helped him for voluntarily taking upon himself the organization of this difficult and complicated project, the climax of which was our visit to Dolhinov. Thanks go to him for his willingness to help, his skilled organization and manner, and especially for his amiable, likeable personality which made this trip exceed all expectations.\n\nThank you.\n\nGideon Radushkovitz (Translated from Hebrew) - Thursday, March 13, 2003 at 17:27:36 (PST)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn a message dated 3/6/03 9:28:12 AM Pacific Standard Time, Nathan writes:\n\nSZYSZKO is SHISHKO.

Porat, February 11th, 2003 I, Meltser Dovid-Leyzer was born in Volozhin in 1923. Meltser Shimen Itskhok son of Zvi of Vishnevo was my father; Sore Sheyne nee Rabinovitsh was my mother.\n\nI was studying in the Volozhin Hebrew Tarbut School and in the Polish Primary Povshekhna until 1939. From 1939 until 1941, during the Soviet rule, I completed my studies in the Russian School.\n\nThe Germans occupied Volozhin on June 1941. All Jewish inhabitants were transferred into the Ghetto a month later. 200 Jews were gathered on the towns Sport Stadium and executed by shooting In October 1941. It was the first mass slaughter in Volozhin. The second massacre occurred near the ancient Graveyard on May 10, 1942, where 2000 Jews were murdered. The last mass slughter, the third one took place in the Volozhinka streambed in August 1942. Our family; my parents, brother and sister and I were driven away from the ghetto by the Germans and their assistants; local Policemen. We were taken into the black smith building that was erected during the time of the Soviet rule. The building was located on the Dubinski Street (now Sovietskaya) .\n\nThe Aktion took place during the second Pogrom, They put us in groups of eighty people each and transfered us group by group to the killing field.\n\nthe killings were conducted near the Jewish Graveyard The Jews were executed by shooting.\n\nMy father told me...\n\n\"Run, my son, perhaps you'll be the sole to survive of our family\".\n\nI put myself on his shoulders, removed some tiles from the roof and run away.\n\nOne other person was able to jumped and run away after me, It was Ele Mlot. I spent some days in forest, than returned to the Volozhin Ghetto where I was hiding in a nook.\n\nI found out that my parents, my sister and brother were executed on May 10, 1942. I run back into forest after the third slaughter, than I was able to transfer to the shtetl Krevo, where a ghetto still existed. From Krevo I went to Smorgon where from they transferred us to Lithuania and imprisoned in the Zhensistoria concentration camp. A group of us they brought into Vilnius in December 1942, where we were ordered to build a commercial rail station. Once in the evening, returning from work, I run away into a near by forest. I wandered there some days until I met with Russian Partisans. I joined the Bagration group of the Voroshilov Brigade. I was with the partisans until the liberation of Belarus and Lithuania. After liberation I joined the Red Army. The Victory day I met in Magdenburgh, Germany. I was released from the army and returned to Volozhin in December 1945 and went to work. I married Sofiya (Sonia) Milikovski, daughter of Leyzer Itskhok and Hana born Berman from Horodok\n\nOur marriege took place in Volozhin in 1947. Our daughter Hasia was born in 1950. She was ill and passed away at age 31 to our great grievance in the year 1981.\n\nOur son Shimon was born in Volozhin on 1954. We made Aliya to Israel, the entire family, my wife, my son Shimon, his wife Polina, his children Asia and Yakov and me where now we live.\n\nI will post the letter in Volozhin stories\n\nsome of the tree;\n\nZvi MELTZER (grandfathjer of Shimon Peres)\n\nBorn: Abt 1865, Volozhin, Vilna, Poland\n\nPERISHED: 22 Oct 1942, Vishnevo, Vilna, Russia\n\nSpouse: ELTE Children:\n\nShimon Isaac MELTZER Born: Abt 1895, Volozhin, Vilna, Russia.

Since early time Sula and Perkla rivers were main roads for Rubezhevichi habitants.During Russian principality, vodka trade was under state hard control and became less popular among Jewish businessmen. But Russian authorities did a lot to develop the region because of military and fiscal reasons mostly. First of all, old communications were reconstructed there:road from Rubezhevichi to Nesvizh;road Rubezhevichi - Ivenets;road Rubezhevichi - Koydanov.In XIX, because of development of the AllRussian Market, new types of communications appeared there: post office (1840s);road Rubezhevichi - Negoreloye station [a station of Moscow - Brest railroad (1871)]; Each Sunday big market took place. From the 2nd half of XIX century big annual fairs were held on May 9, June 29, August 15, September 8, December 6. Main goods: a) timber and timber goods;b) grain;c) fish;d) flax.After the construction of the Moscow - Brest railroad the shtetle became to decay and lost its former significance.

He has also prepared a historical sketch about his family, but it did not touch on anyone I knew about.\n\nI strikes me that if we can gather a \"critical mass\" of people interested in the town, the first step should be to translate the book into English.\n\nYou will find some scattered historical info if you check on JewishGen. Anatoly Charny has prepared a historical summary. I'll look up some of my links and send them on.\n\nI hope we can work together-- it has been challenging because so few people seem interested in Rubezhevichi.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any information.
