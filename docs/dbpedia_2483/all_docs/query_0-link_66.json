This dissertation explores the political and social debates within Jewish communities in \nBessarabia and Transnistria between 1918 and 1940. During this period, the region was divided \nby the Romanian occupation of Bessarabia and the establishment of a border along the Dniester \nRiver between Romania and the Soviet Union. Jewish communities on both sides of the border \nfaced modernizing states promoting exclusion, discrimination, and assimilationist policies. \nDespite state efforts, contacts between Jews across the border remained significant. The desire of \nsecular Jewish leaders to modernize their communities reached across ideological divides, but \nultimately faced challenges in both Romanian and Soviet contexts.",
