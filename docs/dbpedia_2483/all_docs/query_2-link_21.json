        "text": "I did not know him to well though I knew him from being friends with Ashlyn but Whenever I came over he was so welcoming towards me and always made funny jokes to make everyone laugh. He always made my stays very memorable and fun. At me and ashlyns first sleepover he went sledding with us and went down all the hills we were to afraid to go on. Last year for Halloween he carved melons with us. Even through his difficult times he was still so kind to me and made jokes whenever I would see him. He was an amazing guy and I’m so sorry for his family. I’m glad he had a lot of people who loved him very much as he passed, he will be missed a lot.\n\nI will miss Mike so much. I’ll miss his naturally positive and loveable personality.\n\nI met Mike through my husband only a few short years ago, but I adored our fast friendship with him and his lovely wife. Mike was so authentic which made others in his presence feel comfortable and accepted. He was also a great conversationalist and someone you could talk to with ease. He asked the most thoughtful questions, and truly wanted to know you. Only a few minutes into meeting him it felt like we were old friends.\n\nIll never forget his sense of humour. I can’t think of a single visit with him and Meara where he didn’t have have us all laughing.\n\nMike, you will be terribly missed.\n\nI feel so grateful to have known you and had the time we did with you.\n\nMy deepest sympathy to all of Mike’s Family❤️\n\nI was very sad to hear of Mike’s illness and far too fast passing. Mike and I crossed paths many times in Calgary, starting when he just arrived from Manitoba as I had done only a year before. We connected right away being both from the U of M. We went out on separate career paths but we’re fortunate to reconnect at Dialog recently for several years. I remember the last time seeing Mike at Bass Pro Shops, getting ready for the annual fishing trip on the houseboat. He was pumped about going out. Above all I considered Mike a friend and colleague, and my sincere condolences to his family.\n\nI had heard so many wonderful stories about Mike while he and Meara were dating and then I got to meet him one beautiful summer day on a patio. He was smiling the whole time, and we had some great laughs and I remember thinking what a wonderful person. He is so friendly, easy to talk to and smile whole time. Every time after that when I saw him, he was always smiling and engaging. He has an incredible spirit, and I am grateful that I was able to know him.\n\nI am saddened to hear about Mikey, I was a coworker and friend of Mikey’s, I got to know him, as his mentor when he first started in the Mechanial Engineering Consulting world, he soon showed his abilities and soon became my boss. He was personable and always made you feel like you mattered. We spent many years working together, but always found time to do other activities together, such as golfing, darts, poker, hockey, running(see story ant the end) and even elastic wars in the office. I mention the elastic wars because Mike had a knack of letting the elastic band go and hitting himself in the eye, more than once, we couldn’t stop laughing. There were hail storms while golfing, I was driving therefore I turned the cart so I wouldn’t get hit but Mike, sitting beside me, took the hail and laughed while getting pummeled, our foursome couldn’t stop laughing (maybe a few beers aided in finding it funny). He was always a good sport about everything. I knew he would go running at lunch, so I told him I would run with him, thinking i was in reasonable shape, well, not 5 min. Into our run, I told him to go on, I’ll meet him back the office. Needless to say, he loved to run, and was very good at it. I am honored to have called him a friend, gone to soon never forgotten.\n\nMike was one of a kind!! He had such a strength about him with a willingness to listen and be there for others.\n\nHe always could see the positive even in things that were tough.\n\nThere are so many memories with Mike, but the ones that stand out the most are the many years of pumpkin carvings with the girls and Meara. The awesome dance moves and singing to kids songs. The sledding in Canmore park where Mike would launch off of jumps and land on his tail bone but would let out the biggest laughs and do it over and over again.\n\nThe gentleness and love that Mike had for the ones around was so precious and will never be forgotten.\n\nMissing you Mike!\n\nWe were so fortunate to meet Mike, as our daughter Ashley was best friends with Meara. We met for the first time at the Intralakes campground in Kananaskis. He and Meara were camping with friends and Mike immediately invited us to their site to join them. We ended up being involved in their shenanigans for the rest of the weekend. Our favourite memory of Mike is on the gravel bar on the Kananaskis River at Eau Claire campground. He played with Ashley’s dog for hours, like a kid, running through the river, throwing sticks and rocks, while Beau barked happily. It was then that Mike decided he had to have his own dog. He finally managed to convince Meara into getting Kal. Mike was a genuinely nice human being. We will always keep him in our hearts ❤️ We send our sincere condolences to his family and friends but know that Mike’s spirit will always be with us."
