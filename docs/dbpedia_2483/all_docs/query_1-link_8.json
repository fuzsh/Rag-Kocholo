        "text": "The congregation was formed following the evacuation of Aria College from Southsea, Portsmouth, to Tweed House, 100 St Cross Road, Winchester, in September 1939. The College advertised that it would \"continue to provide boys with a Public School education with sound religious training and strictly Orthodox Jewish Home life\" in Winchester.\n\nIn September 1939 the principal of the college, Rabbi Hyman Klein, requested any Jews in Winchester or the immediate neighbourhood to get in touch with him so that services for the High Holidays could be arranged.(iii) Services were held at Aria College from at least 1940(iv) and Aria College remained at Tweed House until at least 1944(v). From 1942, Danemark House at 2 Hyde Street, the home of Rev. M.L. and Mrs. Gordon from Southampton (see below), also hosted communal and cultural activities as well as religious services.(vi)"
