        "text": "“..Those who have not lived through .. experience will never know ..those who have will never tell ..not really ..not completely.” Elie Wiesel.\n\nI cannot even begin to comprehend what those like Elie Wiesel went through, and through our communication, I declined to ask him that question. For me, the depth of support necessary for me to broaden out the breadth of search for understanding is in my commitment in Always to Remember, Never to Forget. This search for me is more necessary for 6,000,000 very good reasons, all of whom are Jewish. It occurred to me, as I came away from each of the 6 Death Camps that Hitler had erected in Poland, that I had felt something strange, unknown, even spiritual, a belonging of sorts. By my last visit, I had not wished to return to Poland, for varying reasons, least of all the exhausting impact each visit had upon me.\n\n“..We travelled by train in 3rd. class passenger coaches ..arrived early in ..morning at another camp ..Belsen. ..We had never heard this name before and had no idea what it was like. ..as soon as we marched into ..camp ..we could see that it was even larger than Westerbork ..and much worse. ..barbed wire ..guard towers ..electrified fences ..SS ..with bloodhounds ..machine guns ..searchlights. ..a real concentration camp.” Paul Oppenheimer.\n\nBut! I had fulfilled my promise to a Jewish Survivor who had simply suggested I visit, the Death Camp he had left, Belsen. I was disinclined to even suggest that I had seriously focused the need to present only 6 Camps, which exemplified the criteria set aside for the systematic, mechanised and industrial Slaughter each Death Camp was designed for. The ramifications for me have been immense, while attempting to hold true to this clear understanding. It then emerged that many Polish Survivor’s, communicated their strongly held belief that Poland, and the gentile Poles hated them. I could never accept in such sweeping terms, such generalisations that would condemn more people than necessary to the accusation of a hatred for their fellow man.\n\n“..Bitterness ..pain fill ..Children’s recollections of those poles who hunted them ..betrayed them ..handed them to ..common enemy ..of cruelties perpetrated by other children ..of every human ignominy. ..there are few such testimonies ..reason ..simple ..painful ..children ..are not here to record their stories.” Maria Hochberg-Marianska.\n\nIn that, I could not in all honesty, accept that all Poles hated the Jews even when it was apparent many Polish Jewish Survivors felt this so profoundly, and expressed it coherently. I decided to go back to Poland to visit those Museum’s and their Curator’s to see for myself if such a profound bias, bigotry and hatred as antisemitism is, would the government of the day within Poland allow for the unvarnished truth to be on display within such institutions as were dependent upon Polish government sponsorship, and even tolerance. It was of little consequence to the Polish Jewish Survivor that I was helped to get to Sobibor by a Polish Lady, a Lady who proved a great person. Also! I was assisted on my return from Belzec by another Polish Lady who proved equally a generous soul. Even though these were just two Polish People who sought to afford me assistance, and proved their human traits, this could not answer for what the Survivor truly held a belief in.\n\n“..I didn’t want to go back to Poland. Poles were killing a lot of Jews who returned to claim property ..homes ..other possessions. My Parents were dead. There was nothing to go back to.” Bianca Lerner.\n\nBianca’s Father had been Murdered in a Ghetto while her Mother was transported away from her and was Gassed within Treblinka, and quite literally, there was nothing to go back to. Nothing was left of Family, really. Nothing was to be allowed to be reclaimed from those who stole from the destroyed Jews, of their former Neighbours. Matched to what I was learning however, there were occasions where Poles either were being obstructive, once misdirecting me toward Treblinka, or were completely ignorant of the role they played within the Polish infrastructure of travel. On another occasion a coach driver, who left me stranded on the wrong side of Belzec, when his Coach clearly passed the front gates to this Death Camp, left me with a long trek through knee high snow and minus 18 degrees of cold. But all things considered, the Poles I spoke to and with proved friendly and listened to me about my work. Most of these Poles knew of the depth of Polish wrongs, which their government were seeking to set aside, and the level of anti-Jewish feeling that had permeated their Country, before, during and even after Hitler’s forces had relinquished their hold upon their Polish territory.\n\n“..attitude of ..non Jewish population ..almost all Poles ..was hateful. They rejoiced at our misfortune ..enriched themselves with Jewish property.” Betzalel Papial.\n\nThe demand to hold tightly to what had not belonged to them, and deprive more than 3,000,000 Polish Jews a right to what should be passed down, leaves an indelible stain upon the morality and ethical well being of the state and its People. Bias, even antisemitic bigotry, could not dissuade many from this next generation away from the truth that hatred is so pervasive, it infects as it infests the well being of entire nations. I have found from certainty from what Elie Wiesel declares, and that while not all victims were Jews, All Jews Were Victims. For myself, I would add to that to ensure, and that remains a given in my search within my research, that while not all Poles are guilty, Not All Poles Are Innocent. Also, and we need not just insinuate our accusation to know of the persistence of the Polish Pogroms against Polish Jewry. It is unedifying to attempt to defend the indefensible. My journey began with 4 year old Tovah ‘Tokele’ Olshak, Murdered in Sokoly by gentile poles on February 17th. 1945, along with 6 other Jewish Survivors murdered by locals, Tokele, is included in these shameful murders.\n\n“..When ..Poles saw how ..soldiers were victimising us they piled on ..too. ..a German guard was marching me ..some other men to ..nail factory. ..a Polish boy ran up ..stabbed me in ..hand.” William Schiff.\n\nRemember, this is even after the Reich’s killers had left and this situation for Polish Jewry was repeated all too often too followed on July 4th. 1946 when 42 of Kielce’s Surviving Jews were murdered by local Poles. Can this be considered post Holocaust, and not allowing for them to join with the more than 18,042 of their fellow Jews of Kielce who were murdered. In total, and so as to satiate the same Hitler hatred, these Jews of Kielce are as the other Jews of Kielce, Murdered within the same framework as Hitler demanded. I always bear this in mind when we think we know what we must need to know in relating facts to the integrity of those People we apply them to! In this, and while we cannot be certain that only 6,000,000 Jews were consumed, we can be practically be certain that such is their number, lost, concealed within the detail of such an account, human beings perpetrated the worst crimes ever contemplated upon an innocent People, purely because of their Jewish heritage. That all said, we must acknowledge that far in excess of that number of 6,000,000 Slaughtered Jews is a more highly probable prospect. We deny this very fact at a cost to loss, and to all of those who have been consumed, particularly as we search for that rightful need for learning, the integrity of their truth binds us to them more certainly.\n\n“..I was trying very hard to obtain statistical material about ..Jews ..found out that at ..beginning of ..War there had been about 15,000,000 Jews in ..whole world. ..6,000,000 Jews ..murdered ..meant a proportion of 40%.” SS Sturmbannfuhrer Dr. Wilhelm Hoettl.\n\nClearly, while we know that, on Sunday December 7th. 1941 Chelmno opens its murderous operations, and some of Kolo’s Jews were first to be extinguished, they are murdered and are dead here. So on December 8th. 1941, when what remained of these 700 Kolo Jews, who were eventually gassed at Chelmno, this was all accomplished alongside 2,300 of their fellow Jews, also brought to the doors of the Schloss and murdered. This equates to more than 3,000 Jews Murdered on just that day alone. On subsequent days, like December 10th. 1941, we are also aware that 1,757 Jews of Turek were Murdered at Chelmno. On January 16th. 1942, and with the first resettlement of 10,000 Jews from Lodz brought to Chelmno for resettlement there, what now begins is the resettlement of all of Lodz Jews and those Jews from the areas surrounding this Polish City, and the Villages and Shtetl’s once vibrant with Polish Jewry.\n\n“..Germans seized ..Vilna ..80,000 Jews lived there. ..Sonderkommando was set up at 12 Vilenskaia Street ..under ..Schweineberg and Martin Weiss. ..broke into ..Jewish houses ..dragged away ..men ..herded them into certain buildings near ..village of Panarai about eight kilometres from Vilna. ..hardly one returned.” Abram Gerzevitch Sutzkever.\n\nWhen we arrive at an historic milestone in The Holocaust narrative, on January 20th. 1942, and The Wannsee Conference is convened, The Final Solution had already extinguished the lives of vast numbers of Jews. We simply travel back to September 29th. and 30th. 1941, and to 33,771 Jews of Kiev who are no more, to add implicitly to the terms of The Holocaust. Here too, we can be certain Hitler has already been fully appraised of The Final Solution of more than 1,000,000 Slaughtered Jews at the hands of der Einsatzgruppe. With that certainty, and with Chelmno feasting upon the Jews from the surrounding areas, that consumption rose to the tune of more than 300 Slaughtered Jews every hour, we can calculate a summary that rethinks what we are supposed to know. With this, we surely must mean that some 120,000 Polish Jews having already been gassed here at Chelmno, are additional to what Hitler’s conference was convened to complete.\n\n“..When this black hell broke down on a bend ..they ran away on all fours ..yellow like smoked.” Tadeusz Wojtczak.\n\nSuch testimony as can be verified, by those like Tadeusz Wojtczak concerning Chelmno, must be recognised for the pertinence. The inefficiency of many statements, regarding both the numerical atrocity, and their human implications, must ensure the stricter adherence to dates, which do not allow for all atrocity perpetrated against the Jews of Europe, must be corrected. When all of these killings, in the Black Gassing Vans of Chelmno, are added to the more voracious approach of the Einsatz aktion killing squads spreading out across the length and breadth of Eastern Europe, and the Baltic States, we can be both certain the starting point to The Holocaust is even prior to these, and even before The Wannsee Conference is allowed to stake a claim on its hold over the commencement of the Catastrophe for European Jewry.\n\n“..At ..beginning of May 1942 SS Oberfuhrer Brack from ..Fuhrer’s chancellery suddenly came to Lublin. With Globocnik he discussed resuming ..extermination of ..Jews. Globocnik said he had too few people to carry out this programme. Brack stated that ..euthanasia programme had stopped and that ..people from T4 would from now on be detailed to him on a regular basis so that ..decisions taken at ..Wannsee conference could be implemented. As it appeared that it would not be possible for ..Einsatzgruppe to clear individual areas of Jews and ..people in ..large Ghettos of Warsaw and Lemberg by shooting them ..decision had been taken to set up 2 further extermination camps which would be ready by August 1st. 1942 ..Treblinka and Sobibor. ..large scale ‘Vernichtungsaktion’ extermination programme ..due to start on August 1st. 1942.” SS Untersturmfuhrer Josef Oberhauser.\n\nWhen all assaults and destruction of the Jewish People, and I would include any Jew Murdered as a consequence of Hitler’s rabid hatred, even back to 1932, when these are all added together, we reach a far more formative figure than the World seemingly will allow for. With 11,293,300 Jews still be be progressed through the annihilation machinery, as the Wannsee Conference would suggest, all too many different assessments of how many Jews are present for Hitler to target are raised, and they ar in error of the facts. When we then arrive at how many Jews of Europe were still actually available to Hitler for The Final Solution at the beginning of 1942, and remained to be resettled after the auspices of Wannsee had consigned them, how many Jews are to be annihilated on top of those already consumed within the hatred.\n\n“..groups from other towns converged in Budapest and joined forces . From among themselves they selected typically Aryan looking men who equipped themselves with false papers and ..joined .. Hungarian SS. These spies were then able to warn of impending persecution and raids.” Bruno Bettelheim.\n\nWhen the tide had fully turned then, and Hitler’s 1,000 year Reich was to be consigned to History, but one Jewish Community remained intact, virtuall, Hungarian Jewry. When we look to what the World failed to achieve, and they could so easily have bombed the transports capability to deliver Hungarian Jewry to Birkenau, we recognise the futility in suggesting reasons other than apathy and indifference plagued the World. Then, as we are left with the impression of what humanity is capable of in the form of Count Folke Bernadotte, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, the Country of Denmark, Varian Fry, Carl Lutz, Oscar Schindler, Chiune Sugihara, Raoul Wallenberg and Nicholas Winton, the grief over 6,000,000 Slaughtered Jews grows exponentially. While these are barely a few names of those who shame this World for its inactivity in saving just one more Jew from the Slaughter, if but 6 million individuals had but saved ONE Jew each, how many of those 6,000,000 Individual Jews would not be our loss.\n\n“..wicked flee when no one pursues but ..righteous are bold as a lion.” Proverbs 28:1\n\nI have learned from a past steeped in my catholic upbringing, and from learning how best to behave, and by virtue of that very fact, how not to misbehave. I hold not a single belief system. I do not adhere to any other credentials but what is moral and ethical. I know my failings. I know I have had to come through those to become what I consider, considerate. In her letter to Pope Pius XI, Edith Stein pleaded her case for saving the Jewish People from what she recognised was both immoral and unchristian. Her words fell upon deaf ears and the silence of the catholic church, while Catholics acted individually, is telling. Even as a collective in a Monastery or Convent suggests that such a mere depreciation of humanity’s values have proved an unethical response. To such an immense Catastrophe as The Holocaust has become, the church’s silence does not act in response to any christ like demand.\n\n“..As a child of ..Jewish people who ..by ..grace of God ..for ..past 11 years has also been a child of ..Catholic Church ..I dare to speak to ..Father of Christianity about that which oppresses 1,000,000’s of Germans. For weeks we have seen deeds perpetrated in Germany which mock any sense of justice and humanity ..not to mention love of neighbour. For years ..leaders of National Socialism have been preaching hatred of ..Jews. But ..responsibility must fall ..after all ..on those who brought them to this point and it also falls on those who keep silent in ..face of such happenings. Everything that happened and continues to happen on a daily basis originates with a government that calls itself ‘Christian.’ For weeks not only Jews but also 1,000’s of faithful Catholics in Germany ..and ..I believe ..all over ..world ..have been waiting and hoping for ..Church of Christ to raise its voice to put a stop to this abuse of Christ’s name.” Edith Stein.\n\nSo please forgive what may seem flippant in my commentary upon belief and their systems, and in response to some, I summarised my own refusal to belief as such. What did conversion achieve for any Jew, least of all Edith Stein. Edit Stein pleaded with the then pope, pius xi, to at least intervene or issue a command to save the Jews. Edith Stein was Murdered, none the less, as a Jew but was still given a sainthood so as to reclaim her. Edith Stein was identified as a Jew but was an abandoned Jew by the church she professed to belong to. Her Murder remains confronting to a complicit church whose failure in The Final Solution, led an ever-increasing number of Jews to resolve for Hitler, The Jewish Question.\n\n“..How abysmally asleep is a conscience when it must be aroused to be told there is something morally wrong about pressing candy upon a little boy to induce him to enter a gas chamber of death.” Michael Musmanno.\n\nEven without the inducement of candy, without the sliver of hope which a slice of Bread can seduce, Jewish Children and Jewish Adults were force fed the Mobile and Static Gas Chambers at Belzec, Birkenau, Chelmno, Majdanek, Sobibor and Treblinka. Here, in both versions of the gassing apparatus, whether static or mobile gassing facilities, the Jewish People were forced to cling to the last ounce of oxygen they could. With sheer brutality at times, and without any sense conscience at all times, moral efficacies were sidelined in favour of the destruction of the Jewish People, no matter how it was achieved. While Poland looked on at such close quarters, and as the World stood by in a chosen isolation, so ended the lives of countless 1,000,000’s of Jewish People, 6,000,000 of which has become the representative number.\n\n“.. It was perfectly clear to me that this order spelled death to 1,000,000 s of people. I said to Eichmann ..God grant that our enemies never have ..opportunity of doing ..same to ..German people ..Eichmann told me not to be sentimental ..it was an order of ..Fuhrer’s and would have to be carried out.” SS Hauptsturmfuhrer Dieter Wisliceny.\n\nAnd this is the point of bargaining we reach with the Survivor, in asking them to accept their loss is but a number we cannot be certain of. We also ask them politely, and for our benefit, a demand that these Jews hear all too constantly, so as to tell us more of what terrors the horror of what they have been forced to live through can inform us. In essence, such was that life of existence, it was a death the Jewish Survivor emerged from so that a morsel of what they clearly knows and haunts them, should and must testify for us. These Jews, whose very Survival marks them as extraordinary human beings, does not always work in their favour. While they already cannot forget what we insist they remind us of, and the tragedy that befell their People stalks them, we allow for the horror to be ever present, without respite, even though their minds ability will not let go of their trauma. We, on the other hand, are always insisting there is more for us to know, and the truth is there is much more that we are set to become the witnesses to.\n\n“..Those masses who were brought here from all over occupied Europe and were not annihilated upon arrival ..found themselves in a universe parallel to ours today ..with its scientists and laborers ..believers and non-believers ..theoreticians and artists ..poets and merchants ..rich and poor ..ignorant and learned ..speaking all languages and practicing all trades. In this place one witnessed an antinomian ingathering of ..exiled. Death in gas chambers replaced Redemption.” Elie Wiesel.\n\nAs you stand outside the Death Camps, or alongside these places of extinction, what the Jews encountered, those who entered these spaces, where intentionally they were met with what could not be endured, we seek their return to such memories. For those outside, who witnessed the very terms to what was the extermination they could not hide from, they remained passive, even unconcerned as these being Slaughtered were just Jews. For that reason of bias, bigotry or sheer hatred alone, each of the 6 Death Camps in Poland places a marker where conscience and concern was abandoned. In one place in particular, I stood on a ground were more than 1,100,000 Jews alone were consumed, and as I pointed out to a Survivor I had just become acquainted with, there still Was Smoke Over Birkenau. This though was from the forest of leaves and the detritus of Autumn, merely being set alight. But it was a pointer, a poignant moment which added to the disbelief that so much could have happened to so many Jews in such a small place of confinement. In comparison to such numbers as these, one cannot begin to imagine the relative size of any City which could be required to detain them all.\n\n“ ..For a variety of reasons ..women s situation was a good deal worse than that of ..men ..physical endurance ..coupled with work more arduous and degrading ..agonies of disrupted families ..and ..haunting presence of ..crematoria ..located right in ..middle of ..women s camp ..inescapable ..undeniable ..ungodly smoke rising ..to contaminate every day ..every night ..every moment of respite or illusion ..every dream and timorous hope.” Primo Levi.\n\nAny human concern that was supposed to be Worldwide was abrogated to such silence as reached all of Polish Jewry. When the wider European Jewish Family was so comprehensively, loudly and more fully extinguished, this was not achieved in silence, it was not conducted in a vacuum. The ramparts where once 1,000,000’s of Jews stood, where emptiness filled the line which awaited ever more Jews, and with gasses or smoke billowing from the backs of Vans or tall towers, or from open pits, the congesting of the surrounding air billowed with the scent of Jewish decay. From the rotting corpses of discarded Jewish life, thrown so recklessly into pits to decompose the memory of what they suffered, no sense of outrage from Polish communities. However, quick was their response so as to exploit such savagery as these grave robbers of Poland became invested in tainting further the despoiled history of Poland.\n\n“..1941 ..At 6:00 in ..morning ..awoken from a deep sleep. Report for an execution. Fine ..so I’ll just play executioner and then gravedigger ..why not? 23 had to be shot ..amongst them 2 women. ..We had to find a suitable spot to shoot and bury them. After a few minutes we found a place. ..death candidates assembled with shovels to dig their own graves. Two of them were weeping. ..others certainly have incredible courage. ..Strange ..I am completely unmoved. No pity ..nothing. That’s ..way it is and then it’s all over. ..Valuables ..watches ..money ..put into a pile. ..2 women are lined up at one end of ..grave ready to be shot first. ..As ..women walked to ..grave they were completely composed. They turned around. Six of us had to shoot them. ..job ..assigned thus ..three at ..heart ..three at ..head. I took ..heart. ..shots were fired and ..brains whizzed through ..air. Two in ..head is too much. They almost tear it off. ..a few bodies ..rearranged with a pickaxe. ..I came back dog tired.” SS Hauptscharfuhrer Felix Landau.\n\nThe Child in The Holocaust.\n\n“..If this Book should contain just 1,500,000 words ..it would never come close enough to ..form of our detestation to register for ..Jewish Children’s loss.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nThis then is my latest Book on The Holocaust theme, and has been screaming out at me ever since I was introduced to Tovah Olshak.\n\nFor Tokele, this 4 year old Jewish Girl, whose life was so treacherously cut short, has cornered my attention for so long, it feels that I personally know her, and seemingly very well. To our utter shame, we People who acclaim our humanity, when Survival had all but been secured for this Child, amongst the Survivors of Sokoly, Tovah suffered from that same hatred Hitler witnessed from within Poland. For the grave loss that is these 1,500,000 Jewish Children, who are just like Tovah, their lives too were forfeit to Hitler’s rancid and febrile nature. Hitler’s mind was so warped by such a hatred, he would even abandon even those most ardent of his follower’s who were to suffer for doing so much he had demanded of them.\n\n“..Children are not ..People of tomorrow ..but people today. They are entitled to be taken seriously. They have a right to be treated by adults with tenderness and respect ..as equals. They should be allowed to grow into whoever they were meant to be. ..unknown person inside each of them is ..Hope for ..Future.” Januscz Korczak.\n\nSadly, there was this persistent argument that was sought to distance the murderous act from the Jewish Children, but the slaughter itself all about the Jewish Child, and for whom we know:\n\n“..rest of ..women ..children ..old people ..700 of them ..taken to ..wooden barn. ..forced inside. ..Nazis opened gasoline cans ..spread gas all around ..barn ..and set it on fire. Flames soon gutted ..entire structure.” Yehuda Adelman.\n\nThey Should have been saved,\n\n“..After my Mother was Murdered ..I was deported together with my Father to Transnistria. We have spent many weeks on a penal trek of sorts. For days we have been slogging along roads deep in mud ..a lengthy convoy surrounded by Romanian and Ukrainian soldiers who flog and shoot at us. Father holds my hand tight ..my feet no longer touch ..ground. ..sound of ..water slices at my legs and my hips. It’s dark all around ..apart from Father’s hand I don’t feel a thing. Truth to tell ..I don’t feel his hand either ..since my hand is already partly numb. If I move just a little I’ll surely drown. Even Father won’t be able to pull me out. Lots of Children have already drowned this way. I fall asleep ..still clutching his hand. But not for long. While the sky is still dark ..soldiers light up ..convoy with sniping and gunfire. Father holds my hand and tugs me. ..mud is deep and I can’t feel ..bottom. I’m still half asleep and tremendously afraid. It hurts. I call out. Father hears my call and answers at once.” Aharon Appelfeld.\n\nThey Could have been saved, and\n\n“..first victims were ..Jewish Children ..and I shall never forget ..harrowing scenes and ..blood curdling incidents when ..ss men ..cruelly attacked Children. ..Even today ..cries ..shrieking of those Children are clear in my mind.” Adolf Berman.\n\nThe Final Solution ensured that they Would not be saved.\n\n“..pure myth ..Jews ..merely passive. ..Jews fought back ..to a degree no other community anywhere ..would have been capable of. ..they fought against hunger ..starvation ..disease ..a deadly Nazi economic blockade. They fought against murderers and ..traitors within their own ranks ..and ..were utterly alone in their fight. ..forsaken by God and ..man ..surrounded by hatred or indifference. ..there was much heroism ..little beauty ..much toil ..suffering ..no glamour. We fought back on every front ..biological ..economic ..propaganda ..cultural ..with every weapon ..possessed. In ..end ..ruse ..deception ..cunning beyond anything ..world had ever ..seen ..accomplished what hunger ..disease ..terror ..treachery ..could not. What defeated us ..Jewry’s unconquerable optimism ..eternal faith in ..goodness of man ..even a German ..a Nazi ..could never have ..renounced ..own humanity as to murder women ..’children’ coldly ..systematically. ..when we finally took up arms ..we inscribed in ..book of history epic of ..Ghetto Uprising.” Michal Berg.\n\nThere is this continuing myth, that such were the protestations of the nazis and the nazi killers also, that the Jewish Children would be spared such as their Parents were delivered onto. Eventually though, the veil of such hypocrisy slipped and all of this, a mere proposition which such hatred, as was cancerous within Hitler’s very being, would not allow for any Jew, Young, Small, Tiny or a Babe in Arms, to survive. True, many Nazis and their collaborators balked at the thought of killing Children. But the very idea that the Jewish Child should not be treated as all Jews were to be discarded and with disdain, certainly with disregard and with total contempt, this was merely a feigned illusion of supposed human behaviour. Its inhumane outlet was to see both Parents, other Adults and all the Children crammed together and assailed and then murdered.\n\n“.. Korczak’s Children did not romp ..on ..manicured lawns ..but languished in ..dark slums of Warsaw. He set up orphanages ..lived his life among Children in real life ..not just in imagination ..for he saw them as ..salvation of ..world.” Betty Jean Lifton.\n\nAll of which was etched into such a killer mindset, that all of this was to be easily dismissed by the perpetrators in favour of the total Slaughter of even the smallest Jewish Child . No Jew would ever escape both Hitler’s attention from their certain isolation, and inevitably their complete evisceration and destruction was guaranteed. This reality for the awakening Jews to such a prospect could not fail to see every effort Hitler’s legions made was including the mass murder of 1,500,000 of their Jewish Children. It has become all too evident, and recognised widely, that for so many Hitler apologists, the Jewish Child was to be somehow spared, if but initially. For these miscreants then, who continually sought to remove the Jewish Children of all of Europe from Hitler’s Worldview, it is as distasteful as it is completely untrue.\n\n“..How calm was this Woman ..perhaps just a lit­tle younger than me in ..middle of unparalleled uproar and ..general anxiety in ..hospital. When it became clear ..heads would leave ..hospital ..Dr. Rotstein did not hesitate and took everything under her control. ..Children walked by themselves ..with only some of them being carried away in arms. Adult patients were usually transported on stretchers. This was horrible ..incomparably more horrible than a procession of healthy people walking towards their demise.” Dr. Henryk Makower.\n\nIt is evident that with Hitler’s Weltanschauung, he saw both a wide expanse of territory for his own realm and a broadening of his erstwhile goal. This multi layered effort, a Lebensraum that would run alongside The Final Solution, was to ensure all lands would become totally devoid of all and any Jewish presence. This most certainly did not preclude the Jewish Children from being considered an otherwise threatned body. So let me remind them, those with blinkered souls, biased and bigoted ideas and blinded minds, their defence of anything Hitler envisaged is savagely wrong. The very fact is certain, and that no Jew could be left alive who could, should and even would avenge what was done to the Jewish Hopes and Dreams of the Jewish People living freely amongst the nations and peoples of Europe they had previously adopted.\n\n“..I was in Auschwitz. 1,000’s were killed there. ..a law and had to be done ..SS camp leader Schwartzhuber said at ..instructional session. ..They said there must be gassings. ..necessary to exterminate ..Jews. When we asked ..women ..children too. ..everything Hitler did was law.” SS Rottenfuhrer Stefan Baretzki.\n\nIt is a tragic reality that for all Jews, who were finally removed from the reality of civilised existence, and with their lineage and persistence wholly destroyed, there was no alternative view. Escape had never truly been an open door and as the noose tightened around them within Europe, the World was engaged in a spectacle that saw the birth of what Genocide fully came to mean. Even for those history seekers who measure this with the Madagaskar Plan, must see there was futility in Hitler even suggesting such an attempt. To move more than 11,000,000 or 12,000,000 Jewish People to this malaria infested island could never have been logistically managed while a Hitlerite Worldview was being anticipated. While the Jewish Family’s were set upon a path then, with their total life force being wasted on the whim of a lunatic, the Jews of Europe were summoned by law and decree, and they simply complied. Even as a killing operation was presented to them, which levied its extreme brutality upon every Jew, we see no variance in the vicious and vile treatment for any Jew, even despite their youthful age.\n\n“..Perhaps I will be invited to participate in building a new order in ..world ..or in Poland.” Januscz Korczak.\n\nEveryone of the Jews under attack, now lay beyond the bounds of a humanity being discarded, and the integrity of the entire Jewish Community was to be laid to waste. Sadly too, and for all of those just like Januscz, he was not allowed to live long enough to even see a World order, let alone a Poland that would invite those like him to remain or return, because he and they were Jews. Here though, while the Jewish Child would face the full force of what Hitler demanded for all of the Jews of Europe, any World order was being decapitated. I would take you back for an instant, and into the space of a few square kilometres that are The Warsaw Ghetto. Here, there were crammed, crushed, and essentially forcefully dying Jews, who were Jews who somehow thrived on all of this carnage with competing aims. For some of these, and like all the Jews ever to have existed, Family was a major focus that could be maintained right up to the gates of the Death Camps or even alongside the ridges of those Killing Sites reserved for them all. Despite having been immersed in such scenery as has been presented to us, it is impossible ever to come to terms with what these Jews and their Children became a witness to, and a testimony they could never bring forth.\n\n“..Dr. Rotstein received called number of life and could attempt to rescue herself. Instead ..she voluntarily entered ..wagon with her patients considering it her duty to do so.” Dr. Adolf Polisiuk.\n\nHere too, and not solely within this the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto, but in every single containment space registered as the Ghettos within Poland, there were many Jews who doggedly catered for many 1,000,000’s of their fellow Jews. For each Jew, who was isolated from the reality of their former existence, they fell back into the depths of a squalor they had not envisaged. But here in the Polish capitol, there was the largest congregation of Polish Jewry that was to be incarcerated. Here, as throughout Jewish existence, it was an essential concern as to how best to nurture and to protect the Child, and their Children. Now, more and more Jewish Children were placed in the care of those Elders, and Pedagogues like Januscz who would be charged with their protection. For the survival of any of these Jewish Children, we have much to be thankful for, with more than 5,000 years of Jewish dependence upon Family, and those values which bonded them so closely to each other. Sadly too, this had as its counter point, the very fact that the complete evisceration of the Jewish People, as Community from so many places, would be total and complete for all too many established Jewish enclaves throughout Eastern Europe especially.\n\n“..Part of ..trolleys and rails originated from ..sawmill that bordered ..Sobibor camp. Additional trolleys and rails arrived by train from Trawniki. ..locomotive of this train came later ..about two months after ..trolley was in operation. At ..beginning horses pulled ..trolleys. ..trolley was ..to transport ..sick ..handicapped Jews from ..arriving trains to Camp lll. ..these people ..handicapped and sick children ..particularly infants ..taken to ..Lazarett ..were shot by those serving in Camp lll. ..known ..Lazarett was used ..for ..extermination of ..people.” SS Oberscharfuhrer Hermann Erich Bauer.\n\nAs Jewish Parents died, or were killed, as more and more Jews headed toward the ramparts for resettlement transports, many of their Children were left behind and filled the streets. It seemed necessary to heap more and more anguish upon the Jewish People by separating their Family line, though every effort was made to ensure the wholesale slaughter of all within the Family unit would ensure no legacy would be left behind. Even then, and after the Jewish Children’s Homes could literally take no more, and the Judenrate had no space left to allocate to them, the beseeching cries of beleaguered, starving and traumatized Jewish Children, rendered the air of this, and all other Ghettos with pleas, protestations and tears voluminous with the ravages of hunger and the mounting pain anguish of not knowing what was approaching but what was seemingly a disaster awaiting them around every corner. There was the hue of such an immense desperation, and which would only be fully quelled within the Gas Chambers of places like Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor and Birkenau. This was certainly true for the many 100’s of 1,000’s of those Jews being gradually removed away from the Warsaw Ghetto enroute toward Malkinia. For these Jews in the main, who took everything of value with them, and most especially for the Parents, it was to be their Children who would be alongside them and consigned to an eternity together.\n\n“..We shot women as if they had been cattle. ..a large quarry where 10,000 men ..women ..children were shot. They were still lying in ..quarry. We drove out on purpose to see it. It was ..most bestial thing I ever saw.” Lieutenant General Fritz von Broich.\n\nHere, like Januscz Korczak or Dr. Halina Rotstein, and I have no wish to exclude anyone from this roster of human compassion, we recognise all that civilisation presents is being eroded and then erased. For all of those Jews who did not allow for their charges to be abandoned, it is for us to reassure the world that not only should they be remembered, they should be recounted as the best of us. Indeed, for those Jews especially, who entered the wagons together with those they were charged to care for, and from the many places just like Warsaw’s Umschlagplatz, for these now enroute to Treblinka, or from the many places earmarked for the embarkation of Jews toward the Death Camps and the East, their heroism is exemplified. We sit in awe at what a human being can achieve knowing we too have an obligation to this past, so as to ensure their lesson is well taught, it is learned, and we must learn from it. It has never been enough for me to become a witness to what we allowed to happen to 6,000,000 Jews, and especially to all those 6,000,000 Jews who were Slaughtered, but we must assess the entire loss as it matters to us as it confronts our own humanity.\n\n“..Each person carries an entire world within himself ..and everything exists twice: once ..way it is ..other ..way he perceives it with his own eyes and feelings.” Januscz Korczak.\n\n“..Each individual was a world in himself ..unique in his aspirations ..feelings ..hopes ..his past obliterated ..his future cut off at ..roots. Each and every one deserves his place in posterity ..just as he deserves a grave and a tombstone of his own. ..book mentions only a few and we pray that this book will serve as a communal monument for those who have been inadvertently passed over without mention.” Avraham Levite.\n\nMemory is always important to that vibrancy in any History which links us to the past we seek to earn from. Everything I write is personal to me and matters more than 6,000,000 Jewish lives ever proved to matter to the World! As a writer on The Holocaust, I have been enabled to process my own grief, through recognising the immensity of a grief I have yet to comprehend. In a World that proved so intolerable for 6,000,000 Jews who were removed from it. Also, and I’ve learned this from the sense of that very loss I have encountered time and time again, that to learn of the Jewish suffering is in part to own their loss. For me, and so as to add further to such an incomprehensible atrocity, I do not choose to write on that part of my own past which has so impacted me, personally. So I am here exclusively, to remember these 6,000,000 Jews and in particular within the pages of my work, words and Books.\n\n“..In my opinion ..Jewish People were neglected by ..first requirement of their heritage ..their Religion ..and betrayed by ..racial intolerance and human indifference within Man.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nMy latest Book couldn’t be more important to me as it relates such devastating a loss that rendered 1,500,000 of the Jewish Children superfluous to our own humanity. While there are others of my own Family to remind me of our combined loss, I am mindful of the deeper penetration of loss that reaches the Jews of this World. For these Jews, and more consequentially for Their Children written about here, who now is left to remember them. True! As a Jewish collective, the Jews remember there was once a great more Jewish People in the World and for whose grief we must share. The Jews of today must require from us to share with those who see in The Holocaust all that must matter to humanity. As a State too, Israel recalls the burden of that huge and immeasurable loss that has not weighted as heavily upon a world as it should have done.\n\n“..Someone who was not there could never really grasp how unreal ..situation was.” Benjamin Berell Ferencz.\n\nIn a World which oversaw the dark shadow of such expressed hatred as has consumed these Jews, newer expression of our remorse is sought. For much that I acclaim, there are parts of my very being carefully written into each page of the words in all and any of these books, works and their effort. It is through each and every Book I have written that I truly consider that they are my works for the loss of the 6,000,000 Jews who were so cruelly taken. For that very reason, we are morally obliged to remember them all with more than a vague recollection of whay they were so lethally destroyed. I have detailed within each of my works what I consider is a sincere effort to deliver what I feel 6,000,000 Slaughtered Jews have long deserved, apolgy in memory. That they are deprived of all that becomes necessary, in much of their memory that is forever lost to us, we must dig ever more deeply for the barest traces of who they are and what they must have left to us.\n\n“..There are some works you have to return to ..to reprise ..essential necessity of what has been written and what requires an evidenced gain from a futures proof. For me ..to even to attempt to appreciate ..calm dignity of those who Survived ..I aim to ensure nothing I have said has caused such offence as to be somewhat spoiled in my effort.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nFor me, there is also an anger, and though this has to be somewhat subdued, as it must and should not detract from that essential in remembering them all through their bitter strucggles with the rancid nature angered with hatred. What I aim to achieve, and what remains hidden beneath that more important effort, is in always allowing my effort to further add to their memory. This also sees in my own inner conflict a very grave need to know the why’s and the wherefores of how and why all of this was allowed to happen. While I attempt to barely conceal the rage, I am certain as I allow a prominent grief to inflict its loss upon me, upon more of us, I will not read other works without that sense of despair converting others thoughts into my own words. This all then adds to ensure that those destroyed Jews have a reminder for the future that is not removed from us entirely.\n\n“..I built a physical site for visitors ..which tells and presents ..history of The Holocaust. I expanded ..education and research of ..subject and laid ..foundations for making ..place a world center for commemorating ..memory of The Holocaust and its heritage. ..Despite years of lack of diplomatic relations with ..countries of ..Communist bloc in Eastern Europe ..I have been able to establish working relations with archives in these countries and obtain 100’s of 1,000’s of documents relating to The Holocaust there.” Dr. Yitzhak Arad.\n\nMy major effort has always been, as I have researched, and as I have trawled so many other works, that intricate search is for more of what is still missing. There is still within me the hope that I can find even one more name that would be otherwise stay lost or be forgotten. So as to be added to what we may already know, to ensure some of what might yet be forgotten, this is a demand I place upon myself in my search that fills my World with images I cannot, not own. I have thought long and hard about this effort in my first Book’s title, and as I explored the Testimony and recognised there was approaching this Fading Memory in the Holocaust. I was talking to a Survivor at the beginning of my journey and recognised in his words, ‘We are fast approaching our own passing’, and knew we owed more to their importance and than just the recognition and urgent testimony to that fading memory they were facing.\n\n“..my own first Book should have been forming merely ..initial chapter in ..delivery of my continuing and accusing narrative to ..Catastrophe.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nWe are all too soon losing even more access to all of those Survivor’s we will never know, and even from all of those who knew them, there is this urgency to recall some if any of the lessons they left to us. What is certain too, and in any of my books, is the fact that they contain my words and they cannot be distorted. Nor can they be edited away from their intention to record the digust humanity must still show for what 6,000,000 Jews were forced to deal with. Not one iota of my effort for these Jewish People can be removed from an emphasis I have truly placed upon my own efforts for them. The words I have truthfully written into The Holocaust pages will remain forever to posterity as they were always intended. The words I will continue to write will then remain in truth as a catalyst to the integrity which history fully demands.\n\n“..pure myth ..Jews ..merely passive. ..Jews fought back ..to a degree no other community anywhere ..would have been capable of. ..they fought against hunger ..starvation ..disease ..a deadly Nazi economic blockade. They fought against murderers and ..traitors ..and ..were utterly alone in their fight. ..forsaken by God and ..man ..surrounded by hatred or indifference. ..there was much heroism ..little beauty ..much toil ..suffering ..no glamour. We fought back on every front ..biological ..economic ..propaganda ..cultural ..with every weapon ..possessed. In ..end ..ruse ..deception ..cunning beyond anything ..world had ever ..seen ..accomplished what hunger ..disease ..terror ..treachery ..could not. What defeated us ..Jewry’s unconquerable optimism ..eternal faith in ..goodness of man ..even a German ..a Nazi ..could never have ..renounced ..own humanity as to murder women ..’children’ coldly ..systematically. ..when we finally took up arms ..we inscribed in ..book of history epic of ..Ghetto Uprising.” Michal Berg.\n\nIndeed, and nor can the intention of my works be lessened by others whose accusations rouse the neglect they infect all of history with. I understand the tenure and tenor of their often times vitriolic protestations of works solely dedicated to the Jewish loss. However, I do not deny the weight of a global loss, nor do I stand aside from those who might seek to distort even that. And for some, that effort I am deeply assigned to see’s so many to this day who are somehow fed by that same hatred which consigned the Jews toward oblivion. All of this mounts to my growing demand for those I accuse to bear witness to all truth which is neither tainted by denial nor distorted by bias or hatred. In fact, there is no room for such hatred as its invalid status has proven. The hatred has not yet been fully consumed destroying these Jews of Europe as it still flourishes amongst people and nations who seek to continually gain.\n\n“..The Holocaust ..which ..World should clearly recognise is ..most unique ..unparalleled and unprecedented assault upon any People ..and that this World has ever known ..was waged on a People because they are a Jewish People.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nTragically, genocide’s continue that have learned the wrong lessons of what 6,000,000 Jews could not survive. I have no personal axe to grind, other than in conducting myself with concern for all that humanity has lost. It quite amazes me that some, in a search for their own distortion, will accuse the very truth I bring to my own words. For some the truth is unnecessary so they accuse my words of being somehow contrived or in some way contrary to all that truthful intention must deliver. In particular, for those words I have given over to those Books I have already delivered, they stand in all honesty as a truth to a witnessed testimony to all of those who afforded us their vacant space for us to fill with words. My own accusations not withstanding, my words then are aimed first and foremost at those who are the culprits, the perpetrators and the participators in all that was achieved.\n\n“..circumstances of my present life ..impossibility of reaching a large library ..loss of my own books have made me dependent upon notes and ..memory. Both ..supplementary reading and..research demanded by ..very laws of ..craft ..have been denied me.” Marc Bloch.\n\nFor those, who stood along the wings of the gravest tragedy ever to be inflicted upon a group of People, and purely because they were a Jewish People, I add to the library of grief. For those who did nothing to prevent what was done, those of nations or corrupted states, they too are terminally damnable. It was always my essential, that for the 6,000,000 Slaughtered Jews of The Holocaust I would raise my voice. That this is understood, realised and repeatedly conveyed forms the essential my words hope to deliver. I understand fully, that at times I am too easy to distract, more particularly when corresponding on media or internet platforms. In assuming those who ask the questions, that they suggest they are searching for exactly what I seek, the correct answers I deliver are not always what they want from my work.\n\n“..I thought I had learned of what I needed to know ..so as to write this 1st. Book which would be on ..A Child of The Holocaust ..it should be based clearly on what I knew ..World knew.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nAs I give the exact same truthful answers, and they are always truthfully delivered and are never untruthful, I will not sway from what matters. However, once the questions have been asked, and as I find myself responding to what does not matter to my search, let alone to these Jews I speak of and for, the Jewish Child required more and more of the time I would need to deliver for them. I know all too well that there are efforts to detract from what is my aim, to make 6,000,000 works or words possible to add to a missing evidence for 6,000,000 ritually Slaughtered Jews. These Jewish People, taken too liberally from all existence, have us as an accused for such a shameful indifference that is yet to be measured more fully. While it became evident that it was not yet possible for me to write on other than The Holocaust as a whole, the idea for that first book on the Child of The Holocaust would have to wait.\n\n“..first victims were ..Jewish Children ..and I shall never forget ..harrowing scenes and ..blood curdling incidents when ..ss men ..cruelly attacked Children. ..Even today ..cries ..shrieking of those Children are clear in my mind.” Adolf Berman.\n\nWhat I had earlier sought was only ever to deliver what is within me to write and that position remains a delivery upon the factual truth that is its very integrity. As I was first given the image of the 4 year old Tovah ‘Tokele’ Olshak, which presented itself to me in my search for a literary output, how could I then pass by and not relay my concerns through those exact same words I would use for her, and not for her own community of these 6,000,000 Jews. In that deep tragedy for Tovah, who was never allowed to live so as to thrive, my emerging words on her behalf will now have to suffice for her loss to all she might have been. So I set out to research all that could be learned, and I realised much of what has been done in our name is as intolerable of humanity and intolerant of Tovah as indifference of the 6,000,000 has allowed for.\n\n“..fact too is ..testimony of my actual 1st. Book ..2nd. ..3rd. ..4th. Books for those Jews who stood as Jews and were separated out ..incarcerated and destroyed for that very certainty.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nWhen I was first introduced to the Survivor, who we are fast running out of, and as their first hand evidence will fade and disappear, we will lose ever more of the truth we seek. This too is the basis of my first book on the Testimony and Fading Memory in The Holocaust I realised was being lost. It was an undertaking then for me to ensure that what I presented was accurate, factually true and holding with the very testimony each and every Survivor would recognise. Tragically too, and running concurrent with the faded distance between then and now, there is an ever present intention by too many, to distance us from the entire truth. Fuller memory is essential, and in each of my books there is no opportunity for any forgetfulness in this search. Words make lines in paragraphs which add to chapters of meaning and that meaning has consistently resigned itself to the fact that not much is being learned from the words to teach.\n\n“..That there has been and is being considered in Hitler’s headquarters a plan to exterminate all Jews from Germany and German controlled areas in Europe after they have been concentrated in ..East. ..numbers involved is said to be between 3,500,000 and 4,000,000 and ..object to permanently settle ..Jewish Question in Europe.” Dr. Gerhart Riegner.\n\nOf course, there are the doubters, the deniers and the distorters who do not buy what it is I have to say. Nor in fact do they read my works and all the while they are criticising them continually. For 6,000,000 reasons, those who are thus critical without understanding the truth I deliver, they must first recognise what truth ensures. In not one of my books can distortion present itself and my works are not to be altered and they cannot be altered nor corrected for obvious reasons. The debt owed to 6,000,000 Slaughtered Jews is the fixed notice which presents the reader with nothing other than that very certainty. I am sure I have often stated, and while I have presented many of the facts that are known to History, I have installed a resilience in the memory for 6,000,000 Jews that has me written across it.\n\n“..The Holocaust strands of atrocity which was exacted in front of them ..there is an accusation which is not fully measured by ..sheer weight of loss of these 6,000,000 annihilated Jews of Europe.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nI have much to gain from my writing and it is with an understanding of what matters in all life and what must be accomplished to secure for all of that life which must matter. With this my second book, der Einsatzgruppe and The Destruction of European Jewry, this book emerged from some of the detail in my first book. Everyone who has studied the full tenets of The Holocaust knows full well its leading term is The Final Solution. However, all too conveniently we allow for all too many, who are ignoring that very fact, that this was Hitler’s resolve for The Jewish Question and his will to do so as completely as he could. Also, and the reason for this second book is in the emergence of that one single and murderous goal which was the single minded and determined effort of his tawdry existence.\n\n“..Up to 3,000 bodies were burned at a time. About 70,000 corpses were dug up. ..gas vans brought more corpses.” Senya Borisovich Berland.\n\nWhat Hitler conducted within the field of expansionism, his Weltanschauung, was clearly identifiable so that The Holocaust would more fully come into being. It is to be recognised also that this was a murderous rampage raged by specially focused killing groups, which were in aktionen well ahead of the creation of the Death Camp system. All too frequently though, and by the endorsement of some and the suggestion of others, these mass murders have become somewhat subjugated to the meaning given over to a more static effort. For the Jews in the Death Camps, we look to this premise of separation as it is suggested, to recognise details in The Holocaust. Though we must accept, and so as to allow for any untruthful suggestion that The Final Solution had not long commenced, even when Chelmno came into operation.\n\n“..To hurt a fellow human being ..to have ..capacity to inflict pain upon another person is a terrible indictment which we have inflicted upon mankind.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nIn the mean time, paper’s were filed and memos criss crossed the Reich filling Hitler and hundred’s of the higher echelons of his administration and military, with what was being achieved against the Jewish People. It is still true that other’s fell, who were killed and were murdered but these were outside the remit I seek to recognise as The Jewish Question. As the Wehrmacht drove deeper into neutral territories, nations betrayed their own Jewish Community and in no way ameliorated the treatment meted out to those not on der Einsatzgruppe’s kill list. Also, and there are still many who seek to signal, that with the gradual emergence of the Death Camp system, along with what Hitler’s Einsatz legions were achieving, that this too was a starting date for the overall atrocity that is The Holocaust.\n\n“..I am awake to ..prospect that was denied ..Jews of The Holocaust to find sanctuary ..find allies or at least ..weapons necessary to fight ..common evil of Hitler’s Reich.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nRegrettably, with the emergence of the Chelmno Death Camp, this would exclude in excess of 1,000,000 already Destroyed Jews from the tentacles of the annihilation intended for them. In such a case, this would be excluding those numbers from being included in the overall assessment that is the overall tragedy that became The Holocaust, particularly prior to The Wannsee Conference. With this lack of an incremental appreciation of the course of these events, is it not fair to be true, and even as Chelmno was now in operation gassing Kolo’s Jews, can we ever be irresponsible enough not to include such losses. Also, added to this burgeoning assessment is the huge losses of those Jews of the Ghetto, who had been assigned to death through starvation, assault and brutal murder. Each of these converging aktionen, adding always to the overall assessment still to be made, and even after that fact, we must ensure the inclusion of all Jews Slaughtered as a result of Hitler’s rabid hatred, are equally recorded.\n\n“..I also needed to inform those Jews who Survived ..that a non-Jew would spend ..time to inform ..accuse and research well what intolerable atrocity’s these 6,000,000 People faced ..simply for being Jews.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nAn evidence which saw more than these 1,000,000 already executed Jews, in both Chelmno and by der Einsatzgruppe, all added to the emergence of Hitler’s resolve and the escalating terms of The Final Solution of The Jewish Question. All other c onsiderations must add more deliberately to what becomes entered into this realm of The Holocaust period. The proposal, that with the conducting of The Wannsee Conference, this signalled the commencement of The Holocaust itself. However, this failed suggestion is incorrectly broached, and is a complete smoke screen to divert attention away from those Jews already being murdered, killed and allowed to die and by whom. This I suggest will only detract from the fuller truth which Slaughtered ever more Jews prior to such contentions, as themed at Wannsee, and even by der Einsatz operations. For me, this series of distractions is intentional, as I feel the presenting of this conference as the commencement date for The Final Solution, excludes ever more Jews from the terms of Hitler’s slaughter. This obfuscation, is also the premise by which too many seek to remove the very terms of The Final Solution away from Hitler’s Worldview.\n\n“..after all these years ..Jewish Children would be clearly identified as from amongst ..1,500,000 Murdered Jewish Children of ..6,000,000 Jewish People ..who are The Holocaust.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nThis aim of world domination, Hitler’s Weltanschauung, which began with Hitler’s deliberate enactment of World War II, beginning on September 1st. 1939, ensured that Lebensraum, the necessary room to assail 3,650,000 Polish Jews became fully available to him. Initially, Poland was to prove the testing ground for this annihilation of Polish Jews, and eventually this would completely resolve, for the remainder of European Jewry, that this plan too would eventually follow them into extermination. There is always this confusing demand shrouding some elaborate search for a start date to Hitler’s plan for the Jewish People. Personally, and I feel all of this is presented to disguise the fact that the massing of Murder toward the Jews of Europe was always in preparation, even prior to those initial steps with a gained power in 1932. That being the case however, and definitely since the Polish Invasion, perhaps more than 1,000,000 Jews are already brutally Murdered and Slaughtered even before World War II was fully in motion, in competing for that Worldview.\n\n“..I do know that ..intention was to ensure NO Jew ..Male ..Female ..Child ..Infant or Baby would Survive ..tenets of die Endlosung der Judenfrage ..as Hitler had ordained them.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nThis murderous effort against the Jews is all in accordance with Hitler’s parallel attempt in the World of war. This has all been linked by Hitler’s warped view of a World he demanded would be fully subjugated to his will. Then, and with a hatred for the Jews that would see both Jewish and World views as consequences to be crushed under foot of his design. With the formative Einsatz entering the field in 1939, The Final Solution of The Jewish Question was never to be limited to role to be played by the Death Camp System. The Wannsee Conference itself recognised this combined effort of mass destruction, and of its own role in adminsitering toward it. The Conference itself represents nothing other than the inveigling of all areas of the Reich in the full knowledge of what The Final Solution intended for all of European Jewry. In 1939, 1941 or even 1942 alone, and with each of their corresponding dates, these alone cannot stand over The Holocaust as a de facto identification of the earliest role for Hitler’s resolve for the Jewish Question.\n\n“..Perhaps I ought to go away from this Town which I loved above all else ..but which had become a tomb of all my memories ..from this country ..only one I knew ..which had turned into a vast cemetery inhabited by 1,000,000’s of unavenged ghosts.” Janina Dawidowicz.\n\nIt is somewhat obvious that there is a contention in this, a seeming intention to then deny ever more Jews a space within the atrocity designated specifically for them. I recognise what those who intrude into World History appear all too keen to augment with obfuscation and confusion. Those who seek a distancing from ever more guilt cannot be allowed to deny the presence of the Jews who are resident within its troubling detail. But let us assure History, we will not forget what 3,000 mass Murderers of der Einsatzgruppe achieved, let alone the 10’s of 1,000’s who were the willing tools of the Camp system and the million’s of others whose pliability ensure 6,000,000 Jewish losses. But not just these, all of those with any ability that sponsored and promoted with the logistical assistance of the entire Reich, an assault upon the Jewish People which resulted in the carnage of a civilisation brought to its knees.\n\n“..I want my work to have validity ..and I do not simply want to communicate ..condemnation ..of all that was done against ..Jewish People ..but I roundly condemn all those who perpetrated these crimes ..without us learning from ..process.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nWe must include, alongside the bureaucracy of the Reich, the Wehrmacht, Waffen SS, Police Units and those locals in fullest collaboration, all of these who colluded in a combined killing force. Such force alone was totalling of over 90,000 or 100,000 personnel in all, who were detailed to commit the shootings, and killings, on the ground. So that my work does not stand alone as a connector between the rise of Hitler and the Destruction of over 6,000,000 Jewish People, I consider my accusation well. That said, it became clear, and from the midst of my 2nd. Book that there appeared an atrocity, within the fullest terms of The Holocaust itself, which stands out. From the depths of these deviant and apparent horrors, we venture toward the ravine that sits outside the Ukrainian City of Kiev. To my mind, the line toward destruction of 33,771 Kievan Jews marching towards their destruction is fixed firmly into my consciousness.\n\n“..On 7th. October.1941. In agreement with ..city military command ..all ..Jews of Kiev were ordered to appear at a certain place on Monday ..29 September ..by 6 o’clock. This order was publicized by posters all over ..town by members of ..newly organized Ukrainian militia. At ..same time ..oral information was passed that all ..Jews of Kiev would be moved to another place. In cooperations with ..HQ of EGC and 2 Kommandos of ..police regiment South ..Sonderkommando 4a executed 33,771 Jews on September 29 and 30.” Operational Situation Report.\n\nThat is what necessitated the essential need for me in the writing of my 3rd. Book, on Babi Yar-A Jewish Catastrophe. Such is the devastation that was evidenced here, with every affront to human decency and compassion delivered, a learning curve had become understood. In this singular atrocity, we are at once brought to the forefront of what other measures are sought for the overall horror soon to be inflicted upon the remainder of Jewish People and not just here in Kiev, or the Ukraine or the wider Russian Front, but throughout the whole of Europe. The sheer capacity to destroy an acknowledged 33,771 Jews of Kiev, and over a 2 day period, from September 29th. to September 30th. 1941, is the single most and concerted atrocity ever perpetrated during entirety of The Holocaust period. In its enactment alone, one man stands out as a mass murderer, and on such an industrial scale, that Paul Blobel is recorded as such and his role too is pivotal in leading and orchestrating the final effort to destroy what Jews there were that stood before him.\n\n“..memory of what happened to 6,000,000 Jews ..1,500,000 of whom are Jewish Children ..has to resonate with purpose for everyone so as to ensure their loss is not forever in vain.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nAlso, and toward the ending days of The Holocaust itself, as the realisation that Hitler’s Worldview would be shorter lived than his projected 1,000 year Reich, Blobel would return to seek to erase the evidences of what was a supposedly an idealistic undertaking. In that failed yet eventual endeavour of destroying every single Jew in Europe, the detailed assessment remains an atrocity that is beyond compare. Even though Blobel’s effort is etched into the destructive capacity of 33,771 Jews here at Babi Yar, and worse still, when we are at pains to consider what 6,000,000 Slaughtered Jewish lives must mean for all of humanity, we are confounded. There is a combined loss to civilisation too which has been gruesomely assigned to it, and that can never be measured by the human appreciation of what the societal norms must bring to civilisation.\n\n“..From as early as 1933 ..with a view being gained to administer ..enemies of ..Reich ..and ..in 1935 ..Belsen came into view.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nOf course, and once the need then arrived, including here at Babi-Yar, and that the very effort to cover up the disgraceful deeds of a despicable crime were progressed, we unravel the criminality of such murderous deeds. When there then came the need to completely eviscerate all traces and evidences of what The Final Solution was, the subject Blobel arrived on the scene to disinter and cremate many 1,000,000’s of Jews from Killing Sites, and including the Death Camps. What is particularly specific here at Babi-Yar though is what Hitler was enabled to conceive of and would fully realise could be achieved. Given Hitler’s realm, and his oversight of The Final Solution of The Jewish Question, it is astonishing at all that any of European Jewry finally managed to escape his hate filled intention. We surely owe credit to thsoe Jewish Survivors who not only managed to Survive, but they were clear in the need to deliver to all of History what can be achieved if hatred for our fellow man is not fully checked.\n\n“..Belzec was born out of Kozielsk Hill and Hitler’s desperation to rid Europe of its Jews. This place was to be Hitler’s Endlosung.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nMy 4th. Book is somewhat of an enigma, even to me as I had earlier sketched the outline of a book that was to be my fourth and sought out the advices of some in the arena of The Holocaust. The responses were mixed, though in earnest, and some even suggested I choose other routes. I looked deeply at what Elie Wiesel had remarked and put this work, an effort I had been engaged in for a couple of years on hold. It was only during my visits to The Death Camps, and Belzec in particular, that this eventual book appeared to me. When I finally sat down, especially after visiting Auschwitz and even Birkenau, and while there was a distaste for the promotion of both these Killing Centres as somewhat of a tourist attraction, I was confronted by Belzec as the forgotten sibling in the wilderness of the Death Camp apparel. Belzec alone, one of the smallest of these Death Camps by size, produced an astonishing destructive rate against Galician Jewry, and the wider European Jews, that its mention cannot be ever consigned to a mere footnote.\n\n“..construction of ..6 Death Camps in Poland ..Belzec ..Birkenau ..Chelmno ..Majdanek ..Sobibor and Treblinka ..we recognise their spaces in ..fuller analysis of annihilation process.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nAlongside this concern, and while there was this ongoing debate raging in Poland, and concerning Poland’s position within The Holocaust, and with regard to these Death Camp’s in Poland, I sought to measure the Jewish loss and deliver it back to Hitler’s ownership. The established system of all 6 Death Camps, and with their very placement upon Polish soil, has irked the Polish consciousness toward a fundamental denial of what was achieved upon Polish soil. For all of these exacting reasons, my 4th. Book was conceived and full ownership to Hitler’s demand places Belzec, and with rightful ownership to Hitler himself. Belzec shines an illuminating light so as to try and pierce the greater darkness that is recognised in such an organised, mechanised and industrial scale operation toward Jewish annihilation. All too many distortions has sought to deny, doubt and even evacuate Hitler’s presence within The Holocaust, let alone The Death Camp system. While it is patently obvious, that Hitler was the director of his own calamity, the Death Camp system does not register Hitler alongside them, until now.\n\n“..destructive demand was on ..insistence of a decree we recognise is The Final Solution of The Jewish Question. As this played out across ..length and breadth of Continental Europe ..6,000,000 Jews were laid to waste.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nHitler apparently, the dictator of all he surveyed it seemed was to remain but except that he would not appear to directing 6,000,000 Jews toward their eventual extermination. This was all very convenient, and in promoting the greatest mass murderer in all of history as an absentee, we were being forged toward a rehabilitation of Hitler’s position as the formative evil doer of all time. Then, and after my visit to Belzec, I was certain I had found a further recourse to serve the proper memory for even more Jews consigned to such inglorious places. I cannot forget here also, that the danger I was placed in, 40 minutes walking through 2 foot of snow, in minus 18 degrees, was a poignant reminder of the footsteps I was following in. I thought then of the Children being swallowed up, neck high by the Snow, and before being engulfed by the gas fumes awaiting them, that The Jewish Children in The Holocaust required my effort.\n\n“..It is clear here that I speak highly of anyone who stands so much taller in ..midst of ..Catastrophe even when that personage is an SS ..as Kurt Gerstein was. In that assessment I have written of his position in my Book on Hitler’s Belzec.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nBelzec too consumed a part of me, and as I met its gates, this was as a ritual reminded me, and that I was somewhat relieved by a welcome knowledge that I would still walk back out of there. Tragically though, I knew that all too many Jews who had entered those gates, Their Children too, would never emerge again from such a space. Eventually then, and after piecing together my deep sense of their loss, the idea of marrying Hitler’s ownership of all he commanded to demand, and a near forgotten space steeped in the blood of 884,700 Jews and even more, this 4th. Book was brought forward. The evidence of the overall atrocity is unequivocal, and with it there is such an immense sense of loss, that there is a quite debilitating effort in recollecting the scale of the horror here. Nothing prepared me for what I met with at Belzec, and the huge sense of loss that is emotionally charged as it ust be, convinced me to find the words to add to the Jewish loss here.\n\n“..Gerstein was a witness to and subsequently advanced to ..World what he knew of The Death Camp system ..particularly at Belzec and Treblinka.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nHere too, and what we must recognise in Hitler, and with his go forth and deliver motif, of what was a demand, Belzec is to paraphrase Hitler’s intention for the Jewish People, and all of this must be acknowledged. Then upon a World stage, Hitler required the industrialised processes of the extermination effort, to fully exact his total hatred for the Jewish People. All of these Hitler demands were driven on after 1939 and at Chelmno and then after with a more methodised, static and even standardised format in all the other 5 Death Camps. Hitler, it must be remembered, placed this effort against the duty he should have had for the German and Austrian people he sought to speak for. Toward the end of this organised and ritual slaughter, Hitler would waste the lives of countless other’s in achieving his ultimate aim in slaughterig as many Jews as was physically possible. Along with an escalated intensity for mass murder, in the form of places like Birkenau, Majdanek, Sobibor and Treblinka, the capacity too at the little killing space that is Belzec was erected, and all of these spaced added a greater record of the gassing of the Jewish People, and from within Poland.\n\n“..My permanent motto stands for ..Jews of The Holocaust and for very good reason ..I ensure Always to Remember ..Never to Forget.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nWhile we begin to recognise today that at Auschwitz and even Birkenau, both these Camps now appear as somewhat vulgar reception centres for human visitor traffic. We see however, and in Belzec in particular, and even in all those other 4 Death Camps, an almost forgotten aspect of the slaughter that must never be minimised. We cannot become all too busy with certain aspects of The Holocaust so as to not know what had transpired elsewhere. Here at Belzec, for whose responsibility Hitler must be registered to it, these annihilation centres cannot become a forgotten arena in the dark gloom that surrounds the Death Camp system. After my visit to Belzec, I sought to return the entire killing apparatus for Jewish Destruction, and its rightful ownership, to the febrile mind of its original creator, Adolf Hitler. While the ink has not dried upon the legislation Hitler delivered to those who became his willing accomplices, no need of any written decree can excuriate Hitler from the midst of this huge undertaking.\n\n“..We shall regain our health only by eliminating ..Jews.” Adolf Hitler.\n\nIt was apparent too, that here at Belzec, History sought to diminish an ever larger presence for those Jews that were slaughtered there. Evidence and Testimony stand to deliver 1,300,000 Jews or as many as 1,500,000 Jews to the gates of Belzec. However, this accounting though speculated down, and whereas I have delivered my own assessment at 884,700 Jews slaughtered at Belzec, it still remains an under stated assessment we will never guarantee. The final accounting, which still records an evidential loss to humanity of 1,500,000 Jews, must not be discounted. The compassion for the value of loss then, cannot be expressed more accurately, and while loosening the hold we retain for those Jews we cannot account for, we must fully retain the local evidences and immediate testimonies that differ heavily from our own. All too easily, we set aside these specific accounts so as to submit to History what is a lessening account for the overall catastrophe that is to be charged against us.\n\n“..while exclusivity exists in ..realm of The Holocaust ..by which all Jews were Victims ..it is clear that not all victims of ..War Hitler waged were Jewish. However ..The Holocaust was an exclusive effort ..and detailing as such for solely detailing Jews for their confinement within its grasp.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nAs the media seldom works for other than what profits an agenda, my books, as with any Book written with a wished for integrity that is always searching for the fuller truth, my work must uphold its legitimacy. I make no comparison here, whatsoever. What I have sought to learn of, and what I have learned, cannot know in any remote sense of any knowledge, what exactly those like Rudolf Reder knew, intimately. What I have sought to deliver however, always looking back, are as many of the factual truths to have emerged from such a space as is Belzec. The Holocaust owes to History what it is we must learn from in order to not repeat what we must learn from. However, and in order to restore some balance to the commercialism swilling around Auschwitz, it is essential that Belzec, as with Chelmno, Majdanek, Sobibor and Treblinka are recognised equally as spaces of such devastation towards those Jews, ad many other’s deposited there. For Jews like Rudolf Reder and Chaim Hirszman, who are recognised as only 2 of 3 Jews who Survived Belzec, we owe it to them to record what they have left behind to remind us of all that has been left behind.\n\n“..criminal German monster spread lush vegitation over ..Jewish grave of 1,000,000 at Belzec.” Rudolf Reder.\n\nWith the evidence that the Rabbi of Blazowa also survived, and this is clearly identified, his position does not afford us any further testimony for corroboration. It is extremely important though to recognise, that we do not allow anyone to ever exempt Hitler from the horror which is Hitler’s Belzec. With that all still resonating clearly in my mind, I was presented with an impression of what all of that means, and it is a shocking reality that so many Jews can be denied so much, and be afforded so little consideration in simply remembering them. While it is true that great strides have been made in recognising the enormous debt humanity owes to these 6,000,000 Jews, at places such as the gates to Hitler’s Belzec, let us not forget that there are at least 884,700 Jewish People who are confined here. The weight of words necessary therefore, to even attempt to clarify the depth of loss, will never be quantified in the words sought out to add o their memory.\n\n“..negative aspects of ..frustrating effort for all of History ..which persuaded me to focus my intention where it belonged on The Holocaust and with 6,000,000 Jews whose extinguished voice called out for a chance to speak.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nHere then, and as I move on, and in the image I placed on this my 5th. Book, and as it features heavily on the discourse of The Holocaust, the Jewish Children are brought to mind. I again set forth my accusation for a memory that has clearly interrupted the lives of those most innocent and in need of protection, Children. The image I sought for this, of a small group of Jewish Children, is both harrowing and aware of what they could never expect in their tiny lives. But, for The Child in The Holocaust, who are clearly removed from the fabric of life, the word imagery is disguised by the colour of their blood which synthesises our responsibility toward them. What is almost obscured by the words the image must present, are not lost to those of us who seek to recall what no Child should ever experience. The loss of that hope they have invested in Older humans, who were placed before them to safeguard their futures. In the context of these words, Jewish Children were force fed into an apparatus of sheer destruction we can never excuse, nor forget. I am mindful too of those many Jewish Survivors who will choose not to forgive, but for me, We cannot ever forgive what was done to other’s, and here within these words, are the memory for these 1,500,000 Jewish Children specifically.\n\n“..If this Book should contain just 1,500,000 words ..it would never come close enough to ..form of our detestation to register for ..Jewish Children’s loss.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\nHere too I have used words that are no longer mine as they belong more appropriately to these 1,500,000 Jewish Children, lost from us and taken before they had decided to go. As my words are etched, they have sought to add to what was done to all 6,000,000 Jews of Europe, not allowed to object to their own annihilation. Here, and by a devastation that was always intended for the Jews of Europe, and eventually, World Jewry, I bring to bear my own lasting image of what remained of my two Sister’s, as they were borne away from us. This was of their tiny White Coffins as they were placed in a hearse, and such was this respect that was not made available to these Jewish Children. I am mindful too that there were once 1,500,000 Jewish Children, placed in Cattle Wagons, Gassing Vans or just deposited in Gas Chambers from which there was no release. These Children, nestled as they were alongside a supposed civilised society that was sworn to protect them, abandoned them, degraded them and suffocated them from existence. And of them, these destroyed Jewish Children, exterminated for being Jews, much of their entire Family line expired alongside them. So the cover to this Book, is a stark White, and this is a reflection of innocent lives lost that were once Jewish Children as these Children themselves depict.\n\n“..There is a picture which emerges still ..and it is with ..Jewish People as ..concerted effort for Hitler’s abject hatred for ..Jews. With their systematic Slaughter ..which was Hitler’s focus since he first sought to articulate his enmity for ..Jewish People ..words could not conceal ..deeply held conviction of this hatred.” Patrick Dempsey.\n\n“..Open your eyes ..visitor ..and gather your inner strength ..what you will see here may put your mental sanity and moral quest in peril. You will see here all that cannot be seen anywhere else ..infinite ability of tormentors and also their victims’ endless agony.” Elie Wiesel.\n\nIn terms of what The Holocaust must mean, and in certainty that those Jews who were the intended victims of this, we must educate the World into accepting that equality is the common goal for all people. This right of passage through this life is the only role to be expected for All People to enjoy and hold onto. For that reason, gaining control over the narrative of what secures for Jewish Memory the very facts of what The Final Solution was meant for, is important. What was perpetrated against and ensured for 6,000,000 of the Jewish People, was The Jewish Question as it became answered in its ferocity. It is both factually correct and binding to the narrative that is truthfully told, that we neither adjust to some alternative assessment nor lose sight of the very fact that the Jews of Europe were chosen for elimination. And unless we shed the bonds that the usurpation of Jewish loss, that some would seek for us to shelve, we will be tied to such distortion, and we will be perpetually bound by an historical disregard that is a corrupted history. We remain the slaves of those demands placed upon us, which must further the truth beyond the prejudice and bias of those who wish to circumvent all honesty. That what was perpetrated, and given all that was allowed to be ensured against 6,000,000 Jews of Europe, we must guard this fact as its integrity demands.\n\n“..God of Auschwitz ..know that I must Remember Auschwitz. ..I must remind you of it. God of Treblinka ..let ..sound of that name make me ..and you ..tremble now and always. God of Belzec ..let me ..and you ..weep for ..victims of Belzec.” Elie Wiesel.\n\nThere are those who supposedly uphold some covenant with a god like entity, and so fundamentally, as to allow for the poorest to die from want and starvation, or the Jews from a form of indifference that is both callous and immoral. We must allow that to be a lesson, with all sense of moral probity affixed, and an ethical surety recognising within a humanity that is sacrosanct, these principles were disregarded when it came to the Jews of Europe in their historic moments of greatest need. As appallingly as this detail of humanity’s greater need is reflected, it is not true when it should have been delivered to 6,000,000 Slaughtered Jews. Subsequently, and for and to those Jewish Survivor’s who sought to inform us of so much, in the lessons of toleration we have learned little. For the sheer brutality exhibited throughout the period we seem content to live with, we do not salvage much of human dignity from the betrayal of human compassion. Basically, in acknowledging what has been taken from the Jews, and even after their Slaughter, we see that there are still the gluttonous wealthy, who consistently gorge themselves upon the riches they have deprived these Jews of. It is essential that all facts must fit all truth’s, and this must not be given over to some facet of any governmental or political agenda seeking to hide, shieled or even deny these facts. It is essential today for us to allow the Jewish People, particularly those who survived all that was thrown at them, to repossess all that they had previously owned and was taken from them, and their People.\n\n“..How could human beings first imagine then commit such inhuman actions against other human beings. Is it that here it was human to be inhuman.” Elie Wiesel.\n\nFor such need, as it is moral and equitable, the surviving Jew must be made capable of securing what had been divested of them. It is inhuman not to do so, and if that ethical response is to ensure the Jewish People secure the lands, businesses, property’s, goods and personal items stolen from their slaughtered community’s, then their vanquished voice will and must be heard. If there is to be a fairer distribution of what the World has detained, in any wealth not belonging to the Jewish losses, then progress can be made in making amends to those Survivor’s, for what was taken from those 6,000,000 Jewish lives taken. That certainty can only be secured for all of those Jews whose memory is not only fading, but it is being lost in the clamour to deny them ever having existed. In order to protect the looting from the Jewish People, which occurred as a consequence of The Final Solution, fuller restitution must be made. If the stolen resources of the Jewish World are to belong to the Jewish People of the World, greater significance must be given to what protects that right. Any morality that dissipates, as it is likely to from theft, and the deceit with which any Surviving Jew who seeks to re-own what has been taken from them, is bound by such efficacy, that even whole faith systems have been built upon.\n\n“..In this place of ultimate malediction ..human condition entered its ultimate metamorphosis ..with ..enemy inventing new ways of torment ..torture and murder ..unprecedented in recorded history.” Elie Wiesel.\n\nIn such space in time, and we have now come to a fork in the road, one which leads in an criminal way toward ever more riches for the very few, we lose sight of the recognition owed to what we allowed to happen to 6,000,000 Jews. For a fairer acceptance of what is owed, and most certainly what is and was owned by 6,000,000 Slaughtered Jews, it is a Justice so far denied them. Then, if we accept all moral responsibility, we will see fewer Jewish Survivor’s leaving this World behind them, as destitute as 6,000,000 Jewish Lives have been marked. The other less likely road we cannot afford to travel, will not see change in what has been taken from these Jews. For any people who profess any moral compass in this World, and in order to deliver back to those whose ownership has been denied, we cannot move forward anchored to such crimes as the past has secured and positively anchored us to. The wealth, peace and tranquillity in the World cannot be denied to the masses of these Jews, only to be owned by the few who deny them the lasting rights which Hitler too would have denied them.\n\n“..Selections ..hunger ..humiliation ..crematoria ..in this place evil attained ..dimension of damned divinity ..its killers came from prestigious institutions and families whereas their victims were Sons and Daughters of an ancient People ..only one of Antiquity that survived Antiquity.” Elie Wiesel.\n\nWe must cease stop and decline, from within Society, any such acclaim for what civilisation seems to represent as a Justice for all while it cannot be gained by all, and for all. Within the framework of what the Nuremberg Trials focused our attention upon, Justice is neither fully addressed nor is it correctly achieved. While the military might, and industrial capacity of Hitler’s Reich was set aside for the destruction of in excess of 12,000,000 Jews, Hitler’s legions were ensuring anything and everything of worth was to be detained and brought back to the Reich. I do not need to enter into what remains of the plunder of Europe, what became the rape of Europa, but I am certain that 6,000,000 Slaughtered Jews have delivered a bank roll worthy of any gangster or mobster has ever perceived. For half of that number of these 6,000,000 Jews of Europe alone, and even more, this is The Holocaust from within Poland, of 3,000,000 Slaughtered Polish Jews and it seems the Slaughter was not quite enough. The Poland after the loss of 3,000,000 of Polish Jewry was quick to ensure the Jewish People could not simply come back, and from near extinction, to reclaim all that Poland wished to hold onto and for which Poland still languishes upon.\n\n“..Those masses who were brought here from all over occupied Europe and were not annihilated upon arrival ..found themselves in a universe parallel to ours today ..with its scientists and laborers ..believers and non-believers ..theoreticians and artists ..poets and merchants ..rich and poor ..ignorant and learned ..speaking all languages and practicing all trades. In this place one witnessed an antinomian ingathering of ..exiled. Death in gas chambers replaced Redemption.” Elie Wiesel.\n\nFor that which has enriched any national state, and for Poland itself, it has feasted upon much of what a further 1,500,000 of those Jews who were expelled from all over the Continent deposited into Polish soil and hands. These ill gotten gains, which have filtered through to a Polish state, and which it keeps in perpetuity, is bereft of any morality. Apology now becomes a benign word, so as to deny further rights to what was once Polish Jewish owned and can no longer be Polish Jewish claimed. For close on 4,500,000 Jews then, sent to be detained and decapitated in burial sites, Death Camps and Ghettos within Poland, what is the worth to be taken from such grievous acts of inhumanity, immorality and unethical delivery. From Elie I have gained a certain perspective which had been summarily grounded in what I assumed all religious belief engendered. I have since afforded only those words in any of these of my own Books, an offer to our great loss, that accuses many for which, 6,000,000 memories are being denied.\n\n“..Open your heart ..visitor. And your mind. And your soul. As you walk through ..exhibition ..SHOAH and are enveloped by ..sights and sounds of ..past ..hear ..voices of ..victims ..see ..drawings of ..Children ..touch ..names of ..murdered. Be this place’s messenger. Take with you a message that only ..dead can still give ..living ..that of remembrance.” Elie Wiesel.\n\nI am a visitor here though, and not as other than a human being speaking out against what we humans did to other humans simply because they were Jews and for what we continually fail to achieve in their name. I have no wish to deposit merely a few scant words which do not accurately identify the World’s shame for what it allowed to breech all of civilisation’s need. I have taken fully on board all that The Holocaust terms means, and while I fully appreciate the crisis those who might see in the Shoah a more representative image of what the Jewish loss means, The Holocaust is for me, my own resolve. As it was mentioned, and intended for assessing the steps leading from the Final Solution and what it sought to resolve, it is a most valuable term by which we commemorate such losses as history can barely comprehend. I am still one of this place’s messenger’s too, still seeking to add an ongoing memorial existence to any and all Jewish life. For me, in remembering all that has been taken from these 6,000,000 Jews, we owe way more than we can practically say. For these Jewish People, no longer allowed to persist, but who are a living memory as long as we all chose to recall them, we give further and future meaning to an expression of their loss.\n\n“..We should never think that it is finished. With imagination ..with passion ..with fervour ..begin again. It’s up to you now ..that my past does not become your future”. Elie Wiesel.\n\nFor me then, and in order to abstain from the unreal effort to remove any trace of the Jews from what catapulted them into eternity, I persist with linking them all through the ramifications of The Holocaust. With direction, The Final Solution became a measure of what The Holocaust defines in The Jewish Question, and this surely does not only belong to a past we must never forget. There are of course the untruths still being told, and we must ensure that the veracity within the fact is sought out, so as to remove these blemishes to the very integrity which has consumed 6,000,000 Jewish People. I have written to some of the great Writers of our time, and given that I have chosen to write on The Holocaust, which delivered 6,000,000 Jews to an annihilation of humanity, it is not a coincidence that these Writer’s are both Jews and the Survivor’s of what was intended for them as Jews, and within Hitler’s role for The Final Solution of The Jewish Question.\n\n“..Now everyone got into ..act. Novelists made free use of it in their work ..scholars used it to prove their theories ..politicians to win votes. In so doing they cheapened The Holocaust ..they drained it of its substance.” Elie Wiesel.\n\nEven in the language which expressed it most profoundly, die Endlosung der Judenfrage, this is an undeniable affront to that vastness of humanity. As the Jewish People were assailed, broken and brutally tossed aside in favour of this The Greatest Hatred, I do not relent upon the term The Holocaust gives to them. For that which has been measured, and over 2,000 years, to somehow climax it reach toward The Holocaust, I stall at giving way to what The Holocaust has always meant since its term came into use. It has been my essential, borrowing where I can from those who brought forth their message from what was always meant to detin them, and I lend all that ?I have to say, and have been saying for more than 30 years now, The Holocaust is the Uniquely, Unprecedented and Unequalled Slaughter of any People, and this, merely because these were The Jewish People. In my research I remember writing to Elie Wiesel, after I remembered reading this, from October 31st. 1975, and asked him if my effort was in keeping with what he considered the substance of The Holocaust. The article was when Elie delivered a master class on what must be appropriate, and most certainly what remains inappropriate in the jurisdiction of The Holocaust.\n\nElie Wiesel – For Some Measure of Humility.\n\n“..One generation later, it can still be said and must now be affirmed: There is no such thing as a literature of The Holocaust, nor can there be. The very expression is a contradiction in terms. Auschwitz negates any form of literature, as it defies all systems, all doctrines; to confine it to a philosophy is to minimize it, to distort it. Ask a survivor, any one of them, and he will bear me out. Those who have not lived through the experience will never know; those who have will never tell; not really, not completely. Here you will find books to be of little help; paltry commentaries, they merely serve as guides. Between the memories of a survivor and their portrayal in words, even his own, there exists an unbridgeable gulf. The past belongs to the dead and the survivor does not recognize himself in the images and ideas which presumably depict him.\n\nA novel about Auschwitz is not a novel, or else it is not about Auschwitz.\n\nThe very attempt to write such a novel is blasphemy, as is any attempt to explain or justify, for any explanation is a form of justification. Here ignorance borders on falsehood and deceit. This you must know, if you haven’t understood it yet: Auschwitz means death, total, absolute death of man and of all people, of language and imagination, of time and of the spirit. Its mystery is doomed to remain intact. The survivor knows. He and no one else. And so he is obsessed by guilt and helplessness. Bearing true witness: a painful and fearful task. For the fact that he has survived commands him to bear witness. But how can he speak up without committing treason against himself and others? A dialectical trap from which there is no escape: the true witness must be silent.\n\nEven if he succeeded in speaking the unspeakable, he would not be understood. And yet, in the beginning, in a world still in ruins, he forced himself to come forth, and at least partially to lift the veil, not in an attempt to free himself of the past, but rather out of loyalty to it. In his eyes, forgetting meant that the enemy had won. The executioner always kills twice, the second time to cover all traces and evidence of his crime. To forget is to become his accomplice. One had to testify, in order that there be no forgetting. A painful and thankless task, causing fear and remorse. The words which the witness strung together, the images he summoned up seemed all too pale compared with their substance.\n\nThe essence defied expression, resisted utterance, remained unspoken, on the other side; there was more intensity, more weight, more truth in what he left unsaid. The panic in the eyes of the old people, the whispers of children turned old in the face of death, the silent, solemn march of the victims as though drawn to the flames and to the night; the selections, the mass graves, those who said Kaddish for their own death and for the living: he couldn’t describe it and yet he had to. A special language and vocabulary should have been invented to say what no human being had ever said"
