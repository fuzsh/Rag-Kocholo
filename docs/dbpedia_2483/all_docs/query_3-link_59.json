        "text": "I am deeply saddened to hear of the passing of my longtime friend and former Lambda Legal board member, Michael Bauer.\n\nMichael served on the board of Lambda Legal and was instrumental in the opening and establishment of Lambda Legal’s Midwest Regional Office in Chicago. Without him, there might have never been a Lambda Legal office in the Midwest. Because of his tireless support and hard work, we were able to open our doors in Chicago in 1993.\n\nMichael helped build the base of support that we needed to get off the ground in Chicago and establish Lambda as the national organization that it is today.\n\nMichael was so supportive, in big ways and small. He believed in Lambda Legal and our mission and was never shy to make big requests for support on our behalf. He was a kind man and helped in any way that he could. He would welcome me into his home when Lambda couldn’t even cover the expense of a hotel room. I am thankful to him for everything that he has done for Lambda Legal, and for me, and I will miss him immensely.\n\nOn behalf of Lambda Legal, I want to extend our deepest sympathy to his husband, Roger, and their many friends and family for this tremendous loss."
