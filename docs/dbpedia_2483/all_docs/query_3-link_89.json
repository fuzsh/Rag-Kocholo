        "text": "Finally: just a few days to go until summer holidays! I am very much looking forward to three weeks just with my family. I hope that many of you also have the opportunity to relax and recharge. At Mercedes-Benz AG, the recent months have been intense. However, I am convinced that we are on the right track: We continue to actively pursue the transformation of our industry. This is only possible because of our fantastic colleagues who have been working hard all year. We wanted to say THANK YOU! This week, we handed out free ice cream to our employees. And they liked it: a most welcome refreshment especially during these hot days. #MercedesBenz #MO #Team #ThankYou #SummerHolidays\n\nA-M-G: Three letters that spell driving performance unlike anything else in the industry … Mercedes-AMG has a very distinct racing DNA, proven again and again on and off the racetrack. That’s what customers love and expect from AMG. When AMG goes all-electric, this DNA must translate to a new era and drivetrain. Does it drive like an AMG? Does it sound like an AMG? Does it have the feel of an AMG? We’ve asked these questions over and over again. And the answer is: Yes, absolutely! We’re well aware that it’s a very precious gift we’re handling here, but we are going to prove it’s possible to transfer the AMG DNA to all-electric – and some aspects will even improve dramatically and take driving performance to a whole new level. The foundation will be our entirely new AMG.EA platform, on which we’re developing new performance cars from scratch. With its monolithic sculptural design, radical proportions and its aerodynamic teardrop form, the new Vision AMG shows how a true AMG model could look like in the all-electric future. The technology in the #VisionAMG contributes to the spectacular design in many ways. The heart of the Vision AMG is its innovative Axial Flux Motor developed by Mercedes-Benz' wholly owned subsidiary YASA. With its compact and lightweight design it delivers substantially more power than conventional electric motors.\n\nMay I introduce you to 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗔𝗿𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗿𝗲 and our new pinnacle of sophisticated luxury? Inspired by haute couture, #MercedesMaybach is expanding its model portfolio with an exclusive and #limited special edition: the close-to-production Concept Mercedes-Maybach Haute Voiture. It combines the aesthetics and craftsmanship typical of the Mercedes-Maybach brand with unusual, fashion-inspired colour and material combinations. Similar to the principle of the limited high-fashion collection, this concept stands for a new era of exclusivity. The model will be brought to market in early 2023 in a strictly limited edition. We introduced it today at our Design Essentials event in Nice, France. Gorden Wagener, Chief Design Officer Mercedes-Benz AG, and his team showed exciting new products and visions of the future - both physical and digital. Together with Daniel Lescow, our new Head of Mercedes-Maybach, they will work hard to realize our claim to leadership in the high-end segment. Concept Mercedes-Maybach Haute Voiture is the combination of consummate craftsmanship, high-quality materials and extraordinary details creating a new level of #exclusivity. My personal favorite: in the profile selection menu of the MBUX infotainment system, the driver is greeted with a magnolia blossom and sparkling particles. You can create your own Haute Voiture profile picture from twelve different #avatars! The avatars are adorned with fine accessories and are elegantly dressed, for example in a dinner jacket, tailcoat or evening gown. Pretty impressive, huh? #LeadInElectric #LeadInCarSoftware #FutureOfMobility #Desire #SensualPurity #UnexpectedMoments\n\nMy hypothesis: #software and #luxury are the perfect team. Let me explain why: Not only does software ensure greater safety in the vehicle - leaving more room for driving comfort - it also further enhances other important parts of the driving experience: Let's think, for example, of individualization and personalization in the car - \"creating\" a vehicle that fits me exactly. Here, too, software is a decisive lever. Above all, the point is that, in addition to driving pleasure, time should not be neglected: More time for the things that really matter - thanks to automation, intelligent and perfect connectivity. More time is luxury, no question about it. That being said, mobility should motivate and inspire us, not frustrate us or cost us time. And my hypothesis is not pure theory: Our software strategy at Mercedes-Benz AG is inevitably linked to our luxury aspirations. By the way: I also talked about this topic with the Stuttgarter Zeitung some time ago (German and paid only). The interview is available here: https://lnkd.in/g6eFFt5e\n\nAt Mercedes-Benz we were honoured to work together with Virgil Abloh on a few outstanding projects. One was the truly out-of-the-box show car Project MAYBACH. A little bit closer to home is the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class Edition “MAYBACH by Virgil Abloh”. This special edition series is limited to 150 units, comes with exclusive logos and a signature two-tone design­ inside and out. Plus, there’s a wearable limited edition capsule collection designed by Virgil Abloh together with Off-White that’s just dropped. We can only imagine what else this creative mind had in store. [Mercedes-Maybach S 680 | WLTP: Kraftstoffverbrauch kombiniert: 14,3 -13,4 l/100 km; CO2-Emissionen kombiniert: 326-304 g/km | mb4.me/DAT-Leitfaden]\n\nToday, we achieved another milestone on our way to become leading in electric drive and vehicle software: We have opened our new Electric Software Hub, a software integration factory at our Sindelfingen site. ⚡🔌💻 To me, this is not just another building at our Sindelfingen site, but a complete shift of paradigm in line with our transformation. In this Hub, we are especially creating an ideal environment for networking, flexibility and creativity by offering ➡ cross functional working conditions under one roof with numerous software, hardware, system integration and testing functions at one place ➡ an open room concept, free choice of workplaces and various rest areas indoors and outdoors ➡ full innovation power for around 1,100 colleagues working in the new building With our new Electric Software Hub we are not only bringing together two key strategic topics for the future of our company but also strengthen our Sindelfingen plant as the central development and qualification hub for Mercedes-Benz. 💪 Markus Schäfer Magnus Östberg #LeadInSoftware #LeadinElectric #Technology #Transformation #Innovation #FutureOfMobility"
