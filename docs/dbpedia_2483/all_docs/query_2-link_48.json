We may place a website for a funeral home or a family email for contact instead; contact us with any questions regarding this matter.\n\nObituary Process:\n\nOnce your submission is completed, we will fax or email a proof for review prior to publication in the newspaper. This proof includes price and days the notice is scheduled to appear.\n\nPlease review the proof carefully. We must be notified of errors or changes before the notice appears in the Pioneer Press based on each day’s deadlines.\n\nAfter publication, we will not be responsible for errors that may occur after final proofing.\n\nOnline:\n\nAll obituaries appear on TwinCities.com with a permanent online guestbook presence. If you wish to have the online presence removed, you can contact us to remove the guestbook online. Changes to an online obituary can be handled through the obituary desk. Call us with further questions.\n\nPayment Procedure:\n\nPre-payment is required for all obituary notices prior to publication by the deadline specified below in our deadline schedule. Please call 651-228-5263 with your payment information after you have received the proof and approved its contents.\n\nCredit Card: Payment accepted by phone only due to PCI (Payment Card Industry) regulations\n\nEFT: Check by phone. Please provide your routing number and account number.\n\nCash: Accepted at our FRONT COUNTER Monday – Friday from 8:00AM – 3:30PM\n\nRates:\n\nThe minimum charge is $162 for the first 10 lines.\n\nEvery line after the first 10 is $12.20.\n\nIf the ad is under 10 lines it will be charged the minimum rate of $162.\n\nOn a second run date, the lines are $8.20 per line, starting w/ the first line.\n\nFor example: if first run date was 20 lines the cost would be $164.\n\nEach photo published is $125 per day.\n\nFor example: 2 photos in the paper on 2 days would be 4 photo charges at $500.\n\nDeadlines:\n\nPlease follow deadline times to ensure your obituary is published on the day requested.\n\nHours\n\nDeadline (no exceptions)\n\nAd\n\nPhotos\n\nMEMORIAM (NON-OBITUARY) REQUEST\n\nUnlike an obituary, Memoriam submissions are remembrances of a loved one who has passed.
