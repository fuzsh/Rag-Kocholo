        "text": "From one Regina George to another. Rachel McAdams, who led the hit movie “Mean Girls” in 2004 as the main bully, appeared on the Jan. 20 episode of “Saturday Night Live” to introduce musical guest Reneé Rapp. In the 2024 musical remake of the movie, Rapp portrays Regina.\n\nThe introduction, met with very loud applause, was followed by Rapp’s performance of “Not My Fault.” She wrote the song for the film and was joined on stage by Megan Thee Stallion. In the sketch following the performance, McAdams returned, portraying Natalie Partman, an actor who struggled to land any roles because she looked too much like Rachel McAdams.\n\nMcAdams (the real one) hasn’t been part of any of the recent “Mean Girls” events, making her surprise appearance all the more exciting. The original film also starred Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert, and the three recently reunited for a Walmart commercial. Additionally, Lohan appeared at the New York City premiere of the remake and made a cameo.\n\nWhile both Tina Fey (who wrote both the original and new movie) and Tim Meadows reprised their roles in the remake, McAdams did not.\n\n“Tina and I sort of dabbled with a few ideas, but it was tough to make it all work in the end,” she told Variety last month. “I was really down for whatever she wanted to do. I think the direction it went in will be fantastic and I cannot wait to see it.”\n\nShe also did not appear in the commercial with the rest of her costars, revealing that she turned it down.\n\n“I don’t know; I guess I wasn’t that excited about doing a commercial if I’m being totally honest. A movie sounded awesome, but I’ve never done commercials, and it just didn’t feel like my bag,” she said. “Also, I didn’t know that everyone was doing it. I would, of course, always love to be part of a ‘Mean Girls’ reunion and hang with my plastics, but yeah, I found that out later.”"
