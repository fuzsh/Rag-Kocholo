        "text": "Renée Rapp‘s Saturday Night Live debut was full of surprises.\n\nThe 24-year-old singer and actress, who reprises her Broadway role as Regina George in the new box office-topping Mean Girls movie musical, showed off her powerful pipes and threw in some unexpected moments while appearing as musical guest during the iconic sketch comedy show’s first episode of 2024 on Jan. 20.\n\nWith an introduction from SNL host and Saltburn star Jacob Elordi, Rapp opened with a memorable delivery of “Snow Angel,” the title track from her 2023 debut album, which peaked at No. 44 on the Billboard 200. Sporting a white corset with a matching blazer and dress, she opened the musical number by impressively singing while lying flat on her back. She eventually rose up and finished the powerful track with the aid of a full backing band.\n\nLater in the show, Rapp returned with a surprise intro from Rachel McAdams, who played Regina George in the original Mean Girls from 2004. The singer then launched into an upbeat performance of “Not My Fault,” her collaboration with Megan Thee Stallion, which appears on the soundtrack of the new Mean Girls movie musical adaptation. Halfway through, the superstar rapper made a cameo from a large-sized pink cake in the middle of the stage.\n\nEarlier in the week, Rapp was announced as a performer at this year’s Coachella, billed just under headliners Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator and Doja Cat.\n\nElordi’s SNL hosting gig, meanwhile, follows his starring turns in Sofia Coppola’s Priscilla and Emerald Fennell’s Saltburn, which recently earned him a pair of BAFTA Film Award nods for best actor in a supporting role and rising star.\n\nNext up, Justin Timberlake will make his SNL return on Jan. 27. He’ll be the musical guest for the fifth time as a solo artist. Dakota Johnson will be returning to host that evening for a second time."
