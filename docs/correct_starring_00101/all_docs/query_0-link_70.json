        "text": "Rachel McAdams is giving the 411 on why she did not appear in the viral Black Friday Walmart ad that reunited most of her “Mean Girls” co-stars almost 20 years after the iconic 2004 film debuted.\n\nThe “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret” actress told Variety that a commercial wasn’t her “bag.” She also was unaware that her former co-stars were appearing in the campaign. Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert were back as the Plastics, with each characters’ storyline leading back to North Shore High as a direct sequel to the movie.\n\n“I don’t know, I guess I wasn’t that excited about doing a commercial if I’m being totally honest,” McAdams said. “A movie sounded awesome, but I’ve never done commercials, and it just didn’t feel like my bag.”\n\nMcAdams continued, “Also…I didn’t know that everyone was doing it. I would, of course, always love to be part of a ‘Mean Girls’ reunion and hang with my Plastics, but yeah, I found that out later.”\n\nThe film adaptation of the Broadway musical “Mean Girls” will be released in January 2024, with Renee Rapp playing Regina George and Anjourice Rice as Cady Heron, the characters McAdams and Lohan respectively originated onscreen. “Mean Girls” writer Tina Fey will be reprising her role as math teacher Ms. Norbury. According to McAdams, she was approached by Fey to appear in the movie.\n\n“Tina and I sort of dabbled with a few ideas, but it was tough to make it all work in the end,” McAdams said. “I was really down for whatever she wanted to do. I think the direction it went in will be fantastic and I cannot wait to see it.”\n\nMcAdams’ former co-star Seyfried said in February 2023 that all four of the Plastics were “100 percent” into possible cameos for the “Mean Girls” movie musical, but had not yet seen a script."
