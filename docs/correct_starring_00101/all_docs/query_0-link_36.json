        "text": "While open to reprising her iconic role, Rachel McAdams ultimately did not join the upcoming Mean Girls musical film adaptation. The actress told Variety she discussed possibilities with writer Tina Fey but it \"was tough to make it all work.\"\n\n\"Tina [Fey] and I sort of dabbled with a few ideas, but it was tough to make it all work in the end,\" said The Notebook star.\n\nMcAdams played ruthless queen bee Regina George in the beloved 2004 comedy and supported Fey in whatever direction the new movie took. She's confident in its success despite her absence.\n\nThe 45-year-old \"was really down for whatever\" Fey \"wanted to do. I think the direction it went in will be fantastic, and I cannot wait to see it,\" she added.\n\nThe actress also explained passing on the recent Walmart commercial reuniting her former Plastics co-stars Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert. McAdams told Variety commercials simply weren't her style.\n\n“I guess I wasn’t that excited about doing a commercial, if I’m being totally honest,” she told the outlet. “I’ve never done commercials, and it just didn’t feel like my bag.”\n\nShe added she wasn't aware everyone else had signed on. \"I would, of course, always love to be part of a Mean Girls reunion,\" McAdams said.\n\nThe nostalgic commercial debuted in November, featuring the characters as adults with Cady counseling, Gretchen stage-mothering and Karen reporting weather. Rajiv Surendra and Daniel Franzese also came back."
