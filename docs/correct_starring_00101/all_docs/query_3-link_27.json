        "text": "The would-be big trailer drop last Friday morning was for Southpaw, the Antoine Fuqua-directed boxing drama. The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a down-on-his-luck boxer who must dig deep to get his career back on track and reclaim custody of his young daughter. Late-July release date aside, the Weinstein Company release feels like a would-be Oscar bait biopic almost to the point of self-parody. If you saw the trailer, you probably noticed Rachel McAdams as the \"girl\" in the picture. Actually, that's not entirely accurate, as she gets killed in the first third of the trailer, which in turn sends Gyllenhaal into a downward spiral. There was a moment ten years ago when she seemed primed to be the next big female movie star. But now she gets \"fridged\" in male-centric melodramas and gets to be \"the girl cop\" in True Detective season 2, which is quickly becoming something of a career rehab home for former movie stars and would-be movie stars who never quite made the sell. I have written so very much about the lack of female-led multiplex releases over the last decade or so, and I have long believed would-be \"It Girl\" McAdams to be among its primary victims. You can't be the next great movie star when Hollywood isn't making movies for you to star in.\n\nThe situation isn't all that different from Jason Statham, who became a B-movie action god in an era when there were few A-level action movies to aspire to. Rachel McAdams had the bad luck to spring to stardom just as the so-called female-centric studio release was becoming something of an endangered species. She of course came to fame in 2004 and 2005 with a flurry of high profile vehicles. She was, in 2004, a defining villain in Mean Girls and the co-lead in the generational romantic drama classic The Notebook. She had three major roles in 2005, including the heroic lead in Wes Craven's Red Eye, a supporting role in the Sarah Jessica Parker-led ensemble The Family Stone, and the \"prize to be won\" romantic interest in New Line Cinema/ Time Warner Inc.'s Owen Wilson/Vince Vaughn comedy smash The Wedding Crashers. Take one guess which role would come to define the next decade of would-be stardom? She took a break from acting for a couple years and returned in two low-budget independent films. Married Life was a martial fidelity drama starring Pierce Brosnan, Chris Cooper, Patricia Clarkson, and McAdams as the would-be temptress. The Lucky Ones ( Lions Gate Entertainment ) was an underrated and little-seen drama co-starring Tim Robbins and Michael Pena about three Iraq war vets adjusting to life after service.\n\nShe returned to so-called mainstream movies in 2009 and it is at this point the pattern began to emerge. By 2008/2009 we were seeing a real lack of not just female-centric films but movies that required more than one role for a woman matching McAdams's respective gender and/or age. She is a young blogger journalist in the (terrific) Russell Crowe/Ben Affleck/Helen Mirren/Robin Wright thriller State of Play (Universal) who exists mostly to be schooled on the purity of old-school journalism. She was \"the girl\" in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes for Warner Bros. She reprised that role in a glorified cameo for Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, because the film didn't have room for two major female roles and Noomi Rapace took that slot this time. She was the co-lead in The Time Traveler's Wife in 2009 (even though for all intents-and-purposes it is Eric Bana's story) and she co-starred as a memory-impaired young spouse alongside Channing Tatum in The Vow. She did have a genuine lead vehicle in 2010, starring as an ambitious morning show producer trying to work with Harrison Ford's cantankerous news vet in Morning Glory.\n\nAnd aside from Brian DePalma's blink-and-you-miss it 2013 erotic indie drama with Noomi Rapace entitled Passion, that's it for lead roles or even arguably co-starring roles for Ms. McAdams. She played the girl-to-be-discarded in Woody Allen's Midnight In Paris and one of Ben Affleck's handful of would-be love interests Terrence Malick's To the Wonder. She played \"the girl\" in the father/son time-travel drama About Time, and was basically the only woman in an otherwise male-centric ensemble in A Most Wanted Man, which was notable for being Philip Seymour Hoffman's final starring role. Her output for 2015 involves being the one woman in a sea of dudes (Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Liev Schreiber, Stanley Tucci, John Slattery, and Billy Crudup) in the \"Boston Globe investigates Catholic Church sex scandals\" drama Spotlight, being the married former lover of star Bradley Cooper as he also \"bonds\" with Emma Stone in Cameron Crowe's Aloha for Sony, and the aforementioned \"gets accidentally shot so Jake Gyllenhaal can have a sad\" role in Southpaw. Oh, and she's also in the cast of True Detective season 2 as the lone female cop in a cast that includes Vince Vaughn, Colin Farrell, and Taylor Kitsch.\n\nThe vast majority of McAdams's mainstream roles in her post-stardom career have been \"the girl\" in an otherwise male-dominated cast. That is arguably because that was becoming even more of the so-called status-quo right as she was becoming a would-be movie star. Her relative lack of mainstream starring vehicles is mostly due to the fact that so few female-centric star vehicles get made in Hollywood anymore. There are few female-centric films that get made in Hollywood, especially the kind of somewhat melodramatic dramas or thrillers that used to give someone like Ashley Judd a career. The kind of mainstream films, be they romantic comedies, family melodramas, and everything in-between, that once starred Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock are all-but-extinct in modern Hollywood. The Hollywood of the 1990's had room for Meg Ryan vehicles, Sandra Bullock vehicles, and Julia Roberts vehicles with room to spare. They were romantic comedies like French Kiss, family melodramas like Something to Talk About, or even supernatural comedies like Practical Magic. Those films don't get made anymore, to the point where now even something like a female-driven romantic comedy like Amy Schumer's Trainwreck is considered a \"big deal.\" One you age out of the young-adult literary adaptations and/or the newest live-action adaptation of a Walt Disney animated feature, you're basically stuck playing \"the girl.\" And just as importantly, the male-centric films that do get made usually have room for just one or two major female roles in the cast.\n\nNot to pick on Spotlight, but six talented male actors all get meaty roles in that upcoming production, but there was only room for one actress. Hollywood movies like The Fighter have room for both Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale but room for only one Amy Adams. The Judge has room for Robert Downey Jr., Robert Duvall, Billy Bob Thornton, Vincent D'Onofrio, and but no roles for women save \"love interest\" (Vera Farmiga) and \"love interest's hot daughter\" (Leighton Meester). The Imitation Game has fourteen male roles listed on the IMDB front page but room enough in its narrative for only one actress (Keira Knightley) in anything resembling a major role. Rachel McAdams may-well have had a varied and busy mainstream Hollywood career if she had come of age in a time when films like Working Girl or Postcards from the Edge weren't considered a statistical impossibility.\n\nI have no idea if Rachel McAdams cares about the choices she has been offered and the choices she has accepted, and her best work may yet still be in front of her (I'm certainly hopeful for Cameron Crowe's Aloha). Frankly I am using her career as a springboard for a broader discussion with no desire to cast her unwillingly as a victim of systematic inequity. But I cannot help but wonder how she feels about getting her start ten years ago playing the girlfriend to second-banana Bradley Cooper only to be, ten years later, still playing his (potential) love interest while he is one of the biggest movie stars around and she has no real mainstream star vehicles to choose from. One cannot help but think of Kristen Scott Thomas, who played the age-appropriate love interest to Ralph Fiennes in The English Patient in 1996 but in 2013 played the mother of Ralph Fiennes's love interest in The Invisible Woman. The would-be tragedy of Rachel McAdams, once the most promising actress of her generation doomed mostly to playing girlfriends and token females in male-centric ensembles, is indicative of how our gender equity in mainstream Hollywood has gotten worse rather than better."
