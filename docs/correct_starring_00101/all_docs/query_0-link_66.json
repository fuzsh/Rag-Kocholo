        "text": "Rachel McAdams was noticeably missing from the Walmart commercial that reunited Mean Girls cast members Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert back in October. Now we know why.\n\nDuring a recent interview with Variety, McAdams revealed that she passed on the commercial without knowing that her fellow castmates had signed on, leaving her without a reason to commit. “I don’t know; I guess I wasn’t that excited about doing a commercial if I’m being totally honest,” the 45-year-old actor said. “A movie sounded awesome, but I’ve never done commercials, and it just didn’t feel like my bag.”\n\nShe continued, “Also…I didn’t know that everyone was doing it. I would, of course, always love to be part of a Mean Girls reunion and hang with my plastics, but yeah, I found that out later.”\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWhile it would have been amazing to see the whole group together, it's hard to imagine Regina George repping Walmart. Remember her reaction to being told to shop for a spring fling dress at Sears? As one fan tweeted, “That’s actually so Regina of her now that I’m think[ing] about it.”\n\nThis wasn't the only Mean Girls–related project McAdams could have been a part of. In the same interview, she revealed that she and Tina Fey “sort of dabbled\" with a few cameo ideas for the Mean Girls musical movie, though it sounds like it didn't pan out. “It was tough to make it all work in the end,” McAdams said. “I was really down for whatever she wanted to do. I think the direction it went in will be fantastic and I cannot wait to see it.”\n\nBefore you lose hope of seeing Rachel McAdams reprise her most iconic role—excluding, perhaps, The Notebook—remember that she told Variety “a movie sounded awesome.” This isn't the first time she expressed interest in returning for Mean Girls 2 (the so-called sequel from 2011 doesn't count).\n\n“It would be fun to play Regina George later in her life and see where life took her,” McAdams said in April 2020 during the Heroes of Health: COVID-19 Stream-a-thon.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nTime to start manifesting. In the meantime, the Mean Girls musical will hit theaters on January 12, 2024. Get in losers—we're going to the movies."
