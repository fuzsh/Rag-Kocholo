        "text": "Rachel McAdams has done pretty well for herself in Hollywood so far, don't you think? In just under 15 years, she's managed to star in over 30 films and TV shows and her star status is only going up. It's for good reason, of course, that McAdams has succeeded. She's got a natural charm and ability that makes her well-suited for pretty much any role, so of course everyone loves to watch her on screen. And while I'm pretty much more excited than anyone I know to watch her in Season 2 of True Detective later this month, I'm also pretty attached to a lot of her older projects and find myself rewatching them on a semi-regular basis.\n\nIf you, too, are a Rachel McAdams fan — or maybe even just a fan of her movies — then you probably have certain ones that speak to you more than others. That makes sense. She's done a little bit of everything, so regardless of your personality, there's probably a McAdams movie that's right up your alley. And, because pop culture is a Very Serious Thing, you probably didn't realize that your fav McAdams movie says a lot about you as a person. This isn't conjecture, either — it's science. So buckle up and prepare to delve deep into your unconscious mind.\n\nAbout Time\n\nYou like to forget about the constraints of everyday life and let yourself be immersed in worlds other than the one we inhabit on a daily basis. You're a practical person, but you secretly harbor a love for romance and adventure. You value family above all else and are moved by anything that makes this connection a priority.\n\nThe Notebook\n\nThere's nothing secret about your love of romance. It's unabashed. You want all the grand gestures, and you live to be swept off your feet. You believe that true love conquers all and nothing can keep people apart if they're meant to be together. You refuse to take no for an answer when it comes to matters of the heart, even when maybe you should.\n\nThe Family Stone\n\nYou love Christmas. Like, to the point where you'll watch holiday movies all year round just to remind you of your favorite time of year. You also enjoy family dramas because you relate to it all too much. You might have a bunch of weirdos in your clan, but you wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nMean Girls\n\nYou're a lover of the classics, and you consider yourself \"old school\" because the original is always better, right? You've got a biting sense of humor and likely knew girls like Regina in high school (or you were like her yourself). You're pretty nostalgic and love things that rekindle your memories of your younger years.\n\nMidnight In Paris\n\nYou're artsy and avant garde, and you know a lot about cinema. You're likely a big Woody Allen fan and believe no other directors have come close to achieving what he has behind the camera. You're well-read and a bit dreamy and often have to ground yourself in the real world.\n\nSherlock Holmes\n\nYou love action and mystery, especially when combined. You've read all the original Sherlock stories by Arthur Conan Doyle and while you've expressed your dissatisfaction at the movies being nothing like the books, you still love the movies because they're fun and have a lot of heart, just like the books they're based on.\n\nThe Time-Traveler's Wife\n\nYou probably first saw this when you were going through a bad breakup and it made you cry your eyes out. Now, whenever you're feeling down in the dumps for no reason, you pop in the DVD again and let yourself have a quiet sob. You feel things deeply, especially when it comes to love, and you also love the fantasy aspect.\n\nThe Hot Chick\n\nYou like to laugh, especially at stupid jokes. You watch movies to take your mind off of the humdrum of everyday life and are drawn to things that can crack you up without much effort. You don't take life too seriously and you're not stuck up, which are two great qualities to have."
