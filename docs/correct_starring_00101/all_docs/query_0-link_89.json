        "text": "Now, that musical is being turned back into a movie, which is filming currently and is set to star Angourie Rice, Reneé Rapp, Bebe Wood and Avantika Vandanapu as the four leads.\n\nWhile Fey and Tim Meadows are reprising their roles as Ms Norbury and Principal Duvall respectively, this means there are currently no public plans to include appearances from original stars such as Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams – and according to McAdams, that is likely to remain the case.\n\nSpeaking with Bustle, McAdams said: \"I don’t see a way to shoehorn us in. If Tina [Fey] can figure it out, I’m there, for sure.\"\n\nMore like this\n\nGiven McAdams's apparent enthusiasm for the project, it seems as though fans can't rule out a cameo just yet, but also shouldn't necessarily get their hopes up.\n\nRead more:\n\nElijah Wood \"surprised\" more Lord of the Rings films are being made\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy creator James Gunn teases future DC and Marvel crossover\n\nMean Girls was one of McAdams' searliest film roles, before she starred in projects such as The Notebook, Wedding Crashers and The Time Traveller's Wife.\n\nShe was most recently seen in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness reprising her MCU role as Christine Palmer, while she is also starring in upcoming comedy-drama film Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.\n\nBack in 2016, Lohan revealed that she had written a script for a direct sequel to Mean Girls, but said that whether it gets produced is \"not in my hands\".\n\nShe said: \"I know that Tina Fey, and Lorne Michaels and all of Paramount, everyone's very busy. But I will keep forcing it and pushing it on them until we do it.\"\n\nVisit our Film hub for the latest news and features.
