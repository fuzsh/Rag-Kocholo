        "text": "Rachel McAdams is revealing why she turned down the chance to play Regina George again. In an interview with Variety, the actress discussed her decision to opt out of a commercial in which Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert all reprised their Mean Girls roles.\n\n\"I don't know; I guess I wasn't that excited about doing a commercial if I'm being totally honest. A movie sounded awesome, but I've never done commercials, and it just didn't feel like my bag,\" McAdams said. \"Also... I didn't know that everyone was doing it. I would, of course, always love to be part of a Mean Girls reunion and hang with my Plastics, but yeah, I found that out later.\"\n\nAs for the reason she won't be back for the upcoming Mean Girls movie musical, McAdams said, \"Tina [Fey] and I sort of dabbled with a few ideas, but it was tough to make it all work in the end. I was really down for whatever she wanted to do. I think the direction it went in will be fantastic and I cannot wait to see it.\"\n\nAfter the Mean Girls-themed commercial aired, ET spoke to Chabert about portraying Gretchen Wieners once again.\n\n\"It was so much fun to step back into Gretchen's shoes and to be with Lindsay and Amanda and spend the whole day together,\" she said. \"Just like a full-circle moment, again, of all of it. We're all moms now and nearly 20 years have passed. We had so much fun being together again.\"\n\nAhead of the 20-year anniversary of the film's release, Chabert said that she thinks a \"sequel would be amazing,\" but that she is just glad they got to do the commercial together if nothing more comes of it, adding, \"I'm so thankful that we had that experience and got a chance to do that.\""
