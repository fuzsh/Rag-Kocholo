        "text": "Rachel McAdams has revealed why she did not appear as Regina George in the Mean Girls-inspired commercial by Walmart.\n\nIt would have been so fetch if McAdams had reunited with her castmates, alas it was not meant to be.\n\nLast month, Mean Girls fans got their first glimpse of the cast all together since the original movie was released in 2004 when Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert reprised their roles from the cult comedy in a new Black Friday ad for Walmart.\n\nMuch speculation swirled as to why the self-appointed Queen of the Plastics was not present.\n\n“I don’t know; I guess I wasn’t that excited about doing a commercial if I’m being totally honest,” McAdams has finally revealed to Variety.\n\nShe continued: “A movie sounded awesome, but I’ve never done commercials, and it just didn’t feel like my bag.\n\n“Also…I didn’t know that everyone was doing it. I would, of course, always love to be part of a Mean Girls reunion and hang with my plastics, but yeah, I found that out later.”\n\nMean Girls fans do not have long to wait for Mean Girls: The Musical, a new movie adaptation of the Broadway hit.\n\nThe new musical will see Reneé Rapp reprise her Broadway role as Regina George.\n\nThe cast also features Angourie Rice as Cady Heron, Jaquel Spivey as Damian Leigh and Auli’i Cravalho as Janis Ian.\n\nMcAdams also confirmed that she will also not be appearing in the musical movie: “Tina and I sort of dabbled with a few ideas, but it was tough to make it all work in the end.”\n\nShe added: “I was really down for whatever she wanted to do. I think the direction it went in will be fantastic and I cannot wait to see it.”\n\nFingers crossed this means that an Mean Girls sequel starring the original cast might be in the works.\n\nWatch the full trailer of the Mean Girls (2024) here or below."
