        "text": "“Mean Girls” fans were seeing double on “Saturday Night Live” this weekend.\n\nRachel McAdams, who starred in the 2004 cult classic as Regina George, made a surprise appearance at 30 Rock over the weekend to introduce musical guest Reneé Rapp.\n\nThe “Snow Angel” singer made her big screen debut in the 2024 musical version of “Mean Girls,” taking on McAdams’ original starring role as the leader of the Plastics.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen, once again, Renee Rapp,” McAdams said on “SNL,” as the studio audience cheered enthusiastically at the shock cameo.\n\nThe “Notebook” actress, 45, stunned in a red Generation Love pantsuit with a purple turtleneck, styling her highlighted tresses in loose waves.\n\nRapp, 24, was then joined on stage by another surprise guest — Megan Thee Stallion — for a performance of their hit song, “Not My Fault.”\n\nElsewhere in the show, McAdams returned for a sketch in which she portrayed “Natalie Partman,” an actor who was struggling to find work because she looked too much like McAdams.\n\nShe also posed for a snap with Rapp and the “WAP” rapper, 28, as the trio pointed their fingers at each other, mimicking an infamous “Spider-Man” meme.\n\n“Cause huhhh 🥹 all the Reginas in one room 🤭💖 #snl,” Megan Thee Stallion captioned the photo, which she posted to Instagram Saturday night.\n\nMcAdams’ appearance was particularly exciting for fans because she hasn’t been involved in any of the recent “Mean Girls” events.\n\nWhile Lindsay Lohan stepped out at the New York City premiere of the musical remake, and even had a cameo in the film, she also appeared in a Walmart commercial alongside several other stars of the original film.\n\nThe “About Time” actress was noticeably absent from the Black Friday ad last fall, which starred fellow Plastics Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert.\n\n“Rachel McAdams didn’t want to do it,” an insider told Page Six at the time.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nShe later spoke out about her decision to turn down the commercial.\n\n“I don’t know; I guess I wasn’t that excited about doing a commercial if I’m being totally honest,” she told Variety.\n\n“I’ve never done commercials,” she went on, “and it just didn’t feel like my bag.”\n\nMcAdams went on to explain that she wasn’t aware her former “Mean Girls” co-stars would be included in the commercial.\n\n“I would, of course, always love to be part of a ‘Mean Girls’ reunion and hang with my Plastics, but yeah, I found that out later,” she said."
