Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.\n\n2004 Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Supporting Role in a Dramatic Series Slings and Arrows (episode: \"A Mirror up to Nature\") Won [2]"
