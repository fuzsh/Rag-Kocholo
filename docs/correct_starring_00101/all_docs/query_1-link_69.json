        "text": "How many Regina Georges does it take to host Saturday Night Live? The limit does not exist.\n\nReneé Rapp brought out two surprises for the audience last night: Rachel McAdams, the original mean girl herself, and “the Black Regina George,” Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nRapp made her debut as the musical guest on the late-night comedy show on January 20 with host Jacob Elordi. Ahead of her second performance to wrap up the show, McAdams introduced Rapp before the singer performed her new song, “Not My Fault.” The single is from the movie musical remake of Mean Girls, which stars Rapp as Regina George. So it was only fitting that McAdams, who originated the role in the 2004 film, show her support.\n\nRapp then had another surprise for the audience and brought out Megan Thee Stallion to rap her verse on the Mean Girls-themed song. The two musicians collaborated on the hit, which dropped ahead of the film's release earlier this month.\n\nMegan posted a photo on Instagram of herself, Rapp, and McAdams recreating the viral Spider-Man meme where the three are pointing at each other. She captioned the photo, “all the Reginas in one room.”\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nRachel McAdams has kept a low profile during the recent Mean Girls premieres and press tours, unlike her former co-stars from the 2004 movie, including Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert. Lohan, who played Cady in the original movie, attended the remake's premiere, along with Daniel Franzese, Rajiv Surendra, and Tina Fey, of course.\n\nLohan, Seyfried, and Chabert reprised their roles as Cady, Karen, and Gretchen, respectively, for a Walmart commercial that aired at the end of 2023, with McAdams noticeably absent. When asked why McAdams didn't partake in the commercial, the actor said she “wasn't that excited about doing a commercial.”\n\n“A movie sounded awesome, but I’ve never done commercials, and it just didn’t feel like my bag,” McAdams told Variety. ”Also…I didn’t know that everyone was doing it. I would, of course, always love to be part of a ‘Mean Girls’ reunion and hang with my plastics, but yeah, I found that out later.\"\n\nEven if she wasn't able to reunite with her OG plastics, at least fans got to see the new Regina George with the original.\n\nReneé Rapp made her mark on SNL alongside Jacob Elordi, who hosted the show for the first time. Rapp made a funny promo ahead of Saturday's show with cast member Bowen Yang, spoofing the Elordi-starring film Saltburn. Rapp and Yang are shown dancing to the 2002 hit “Murder on the Dancefloor” by Sophie Ellis-Bextor. The song has become a viral sensation ever since THAT infamous final scene of the movie (IYKYK). Elordi was shown clapping slowly in the SNL promo, seemingly approving of the gag.\n\nWatch Reneé Rapp's performance here:"
