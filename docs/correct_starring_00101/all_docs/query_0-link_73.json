        "text": "The Queen of Queen Bee’s herself, Regina George (that is, Rachel McAdams), did not appear in the Mean Girls reunion, and now we’ve learned why. If you’re wondering, What reunion? you’re not alone. While the cast did technically reunite for the first time since the 2004 hit comedy, the context was far from fetch.\n\nTo put it bluntly: the Mean Girls “reunion” was a Walmart commercial promoting Black Friday deals.\n\nCulture, unfiltered\n\nTwice a week, our newsletter will bring you the pulse of queer culture, from the tastemakers to the groundbreakers.\n\nLindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, Lacey Chabert along with mathlete Rajiv Surendra and the “too-gay-to-function” Daniel Franzese all reprised their roles for the ad. But McAdams was conspicuously absent.\n\nTo hear McAdams tell it (in an interview with Variety), she was just as baffled by the Walmart pitch as anyone. “I don’t know; I guess I wasn’t that excited about doing a commercial if I’m being totally honest,” she said. “A movie sounded awesome, but I’ve never done commercials, and it just didn’t feel like my bag.”\n\nAs if that wasn’t bad enough, McAdams was also left out of the loop on the reunion aspect. “I didn’t know that everyone was doing it,” she explained. “I would, of course, always love to be part of a ‘Mean Girls’ reunion and hang with my plastics, but yeah, I found that out later.”\n\nWell, there’s always the upcoming Mean Girls musical movie, right? Apparently, no.\n\nThe film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical is coming to theaters on January 19, with Reneé Rapp starring as Regina George (reprising her role from the stage). While Mean Girls (2024) seems ripe for a cast reunion worthy of the original movie, McAdams won’t be appearing there either.\n\n“Tina [Fey] and I sort of dabbled with a few ideas [for a cameo], but it was tough to make it all work in the end,” McAdams said. “I was really down for whatever she wanted to do. I think the direction it went in will be fantastic and I cannot wait to see it.”\n\nSome things are better left in the past. These days, McAdams has most recently starred in the film adaptation of Judy Blume’s coming-of-age classic Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret.\n\nDon't forget to share:"
