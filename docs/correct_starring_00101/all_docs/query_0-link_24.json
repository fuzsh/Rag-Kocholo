        "text": "Fourteen years ago Rachel McAdams was carried onscreen and introduced as the Queen Bee of North Shore High School, and she hasn't really left our lives—or the movies or TV shows we watch—since. Just months after starring in Mean Girls, she appeared next to Ryan Gosling in The Notebook. And since she's been a part of giant blockbusters like Spotlight, she's found a place in the world of Marvel movie alongside hit series True Detective. But there's a secret to her success, and that's Regina George.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, McAdams reflected on some of her past roles and how she's been able to play such a wide range of characters, from the romantic Nicholas Sparks lead to her upcoming role in Game Night, in which she plays one half of a very competitive couple whose board game plans turn into a wild night of crime.\n\nWhen McAdams was asked about taking on the new comedy role, she said that doing comedy still \"really intimidates\" her. But one of the films that the star is best known for is the still-incredible Mean Girls, in which she played queen bee Regina. When she was asked if she ever went a day without thinking about her infamous character, she laughed and said, \"Does Regina George haunt me every day? She does have that quality.\"\n\nShe continued, \"No, I have to thank Regina George for giving me some longevity. I’m forever grateful to Tina Fey [the Mean Girls screenwriter] and Mark Waters [the director].\"\n\nAfter all, the role might just have launched her career. \"I remember when I read it, I called my agent right away and said, 'I will play any part in this, please, please, please,'\" McAdams said. \"I was at the beginning of my career, and it was a lofty thing out there, that I really, really, really wanted to do.\"\n\nRegina also seems to have set the tone for McAdams' career to date—and we're more than happy to thank her for that. \"I’m always looking for larger-than-life characters, which is probably why I like playing villains,\" McAdams added. \"They get away with so much.\"\n\nRegina George might not have gotten totally away with her North Shore reign, but if she's the reason for McAdams' incredible career…well, we suppose we can forgive her. She's right about one thing, though: Fetch never did happen."
