        "text": "About Perfect\n\nSome movies are magical isn’t it? Just the way it happens. Especially these not so great movies, which is not widely recommended. The way they give a pleasant surprise rather than that shocking sweeping of the feet emotion is so sweet. Just like hearing an old song after a long time in a radio when you least expect it, making us wonder how sweet life is. ‘About Time’ was one such movie which was like that, lying in my HDD for a really long time and me avoiding it just for the title because of my aversion to Sci-Fi’s, but boy, how well did it turn out to be.\n\n‘About Time’ has everything to like about. Just the way it starts with Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) introducing his family. How lovely they’re. Not a single person overdoing what’s more than necessary. It has a lovely English countryside setting. Cornwall to be precise. Which looks like a dream itself. Much like how Corsica works in ‘Tamasha’. However, the thing here is instead of the setting being a cocky English one, it’s nice and laidback, they don’t show that they’re English every now and then. It is not a period flick or a movie like ‘Trainspotting’ or a ‘Kes’ where the culture plays an important factor. Here in the movie, they live in Cornwall, that’s that, nothing more, nothing less. Otherwise, who wouldn’t remove an underwear for a bed and breakfast honeymoon in Scotland, I’d remove it even in the middle of the road for it.\n\nThe movie is a romantic one first and Sci fi next, much unlike what we expect from the title. That’s the privilege of not knowing anything about the movie and being sure that only the best movies stay in HDD because it’s your friends who recommended it. After a short intro where we get to know of Tim’s family, we know the gift he has. However, the time travel is as simple as his dad, James (Bill Nighy) explains. Just close your fist, go to a dark place and go to a place you wishes, only in the past that is. Much like how Harry Potter tries to go to Diagon Alley. Time quickly gets hold of it. Now, comes the best part. What does his father go back in time and do. Read Dickens, time and again! Now, that’s something so romantic that even Woody Allen couldn’t think of. So naturally, when Tim says he’d be after money, his dad effortlessly shoos him off. With that we get to know that it’s not going to be some lifesaving bullshit like other Sci-Fi’s, it’s not an edge of seat thriller because what he goes after is nothing fancy, just plain old love. And, that’s what got me hooked to the movie.\n\nThen comes the biggest moment of the film. It’s completely personal, may be it wouldn’t have been this impactful if I had not watched, ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’, that too in theatres. Margot Robbie. One word. Sexy. ‘About Time’ had me at that moment. That brief moment where she stays in Cornwall would be enough to use all the powers of time travel to go back do her back repeatedly, you see the fumble of Tim when she says that, I totally get it. Just the name of her, sends chills down the spine. Naturally, it was so disappointing when he/us gets to know something is never meant to happen. Even when she appears second time, first as gay, then straight, then may be naughtily bi, it was an icing on cake. If you are Mary (Rachel McAdams) and if your guy rejects a hot thing like Charlotte (Margot Robbie), don’t even think twice about marrying him. That’s like the most difficult thing a specimen in manhood can do.\n\nAnother sweet thing about the movie is the ladies, or anyone who’s powerless or without their knowledge on time travel. Both the Mary’s especially. They don’t get any hint or try to know about it. They’re happily normal. Only Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) knows about it through her brother. What I thought would be a recipe for disaster, wasn’t after all. She keeps her secret too. Therefore, you see, at no point of time, does the film become edge of seat.\n\nFinally, the film celebrates the unscientific part of movie too. And, how they actually use their powers to have tea, play ping pong and flick stones in the sea. And, not try to invent some funny drug or meet Nixon. The post marriage rain sequence was one of the best optimistic scenes I’ve ever seen in a movie. It could have been a perfect recipe for disaster but the way they adore it, I felt ashamed. I thought how horrible I’d have felt thinking about it, if such a thing had happened with me.\n\nIt is easier to say to take every new day as something amazing but this film actually makes us feel so. After Tim incorporates his father’s second suggestion and goes back to first, there is a sense of fulfilment, which, not many films could give.\n\nA slightly overcooked romantic tale\n\nAll these chick lits have a certain bit of charm. Nicholas Sparks has mastered the art of it. No matter how much you criticize it, once you start off with it, you can’t help but complete the book. That’s the power of page turners. You only finish it and criticize but not throw it away in the middle. Mostly these thrown away books would be James Joyce or Marquez ones. As much as its great its impossible to get your attention to it. At least personally it has always been this way.\n\nIts as such not a generation spanning romance but it’s something which you tend to like it, just like sitting in a good old French café on a Paris summer. Have I been to Paris? No. But you get the feel right. ‘The Notebook’ is one such movie. It would be a great movie to watch out on a date, cuddling in the couch, but you’d to have certain bit of unawareness to like it. It doesn’t entirely make you forget that you’re not watching a great movie.\n\nBut generally, for all these romcoms translated from the book, they lose the essence once on screen. ‘P. S. I Love You’ is a terrific terrible example of how it got lost in translation. What was a young and bubbly book, was given an experienced feel and the end product felt like a rotten piece of work. That too figures in lot of romance lists. I wonder how people could compare a ‘Sleepless in Seattle’ with ‘P.S. I Love you’. The latter is a disaster when compared to the former.\n\nWatching it now, knowing what a great actor Ryan Gosling is, we could appreciate his acting in ‘The Notebook’ to a much higher level. Back in those days when he used to do only such roles, he was easily tagged as just another good-looking kid. Nowadays even his romantic films garner more respect. Such has become his legacy. Rachel McAdams too does her part well but I’m not really a fan of her so couldn’t like as much everyone does.\n\nTogether Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allison (Rachel McAdams) make a great young and stupid couple. Similarly, James Garner and Gena Rowlands too make a decent old Noah and Allison. I liked James Garner the best among the lot. He gave me a certain Jack Nicholson kind of feel and was so sincere in his acting. Most of his scenes would have made girls go ‘aww’ as well as made boys not cringe. So that’s a success.\n\nThe story happens entirely in flashback and spans generations. It happens in a couple of houses so there isn’t much scope for detailing and its not a film to knit pick on detailing too. It’s just about the feel, which mostly works. This movie would have been lot dearer to Americans because the storytelling very much thrives on their culture. Like how they both fall in love, how Ellie could rightfully get angry on her mother for not giving her the letters. It’s a scene we couldn’t even think in Indian context where its projected as a right for parents to protect the children, especially a girl, before marriage. So, the feel was just irritating. Even the latest ‘Barfi’ scene taken out from this movie too feels better than what happens in ‘The Notebook’ because guilt is what parents make kids undergo here, not independence.\n\nIn spite of all of it, the movie reasonably works like a TV movie but towards the end there was too much drama going here and there. It would have better if the movie had ended a good ten minutes prior where Ellie forgets. It was further diluted post that, with forced happiness. To a point that it felt exhausted."
