        "text": "The cast of \"Mean Girls\" are still so fetch.\n\nWhen the movie came out in 2004, it became an instant cult classic. Decades later, the movie continues to find new audiences and is a touchstone for what life was like in the early 2000s.\n\nThe film was so popular, it inspired a Broadway musical, which has now been adapted into a movie. The new interpretation of the classic movie, which came out on Friday, features 13 songs, a whole new cast, including Renee Rapp, Angourie Rice and Jon Hamm, and the return of cast members Tina Fey and Tim Meadows.\n\nIn honor of the musical adaptation hitting theaters this week, here is what the original movie's cast has been up to in the past two decades.\n\nRACHEL MCADAMS STOLE THE SHOW AS REGINA GEORGE IN ‘MEAN GIRLS,’ BUT THESE ACTRESSES AUDITIONED, TOO\n\nLindsay Lohan\n\nLindsay Lohan was already a bonafide star, having starred in \"The Parent Trap,\" \"Life-Size\" and \"Freaky Friday,\" before she portrayed Cady Heron, the out-of-place new girl at school, in \"Mean Girls.\"\n\nShe continued to act steadily in the next few years, appearing in \"Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,\" \"Herbie: Fully Loaded,\" \"Just My Luck,\" \"Georgia Rule\" and \"Bobby,\" which earned her a SAG Award nomination. It was around this time that she earned a reputation for being difficult to work with on set.\n\nIn May 2007, she was arrested for the first time for a DUI, possession of cocaine and for a hit-and-run, getting arrested for a second time two months later for the same charges. She was then sentenced to 36 months of probation, an 18 month-long alcohol education program, 10 days of community service, court-ordered rehab and one day in jail.\n\nOver the next few years, she was in and out of court after continuously failing to comply with the conditions of her probation, and for additional felony grand theft charges. Her legal troubles came to an end in 2015, when probation stemming from her 2007 car accident concluded after she completed community service.\n\nAmid her legal struggles, Lohan launched her own fashion line, 6126, released a reality show, titled \"Lindsay,\" and made her stage debut in a West End revival of David Mamet’s \"Speed-the-Plow.\" She also acted on screen sporadically, appearing in \"Ugly Betty,\" \"Labor Pains\" and \"Glee.\"\n\nShe made her big return to acting in \"Liz & Dick\" and \"The Canyons,\" but neither were big hits. In 2019, she participated in a reality show called \"Lindsay Lohan's Beach Club,\" which followed her running her own club in Greece, but it was canceled after one season. Most recently, she starred in the Hallmark movie, \"Falling for Christmas.\"\n\nLohan married Bader Shammas in April 2022. They welcomed their first child, a son, in July 2023, in Dubai, where she has lived since 2014.\n\nRachel McAdams\n\nRachel McAdams was a relatively new actress when she landed the role of resident mean girl, Regina George, in \"Mean Girls.\" Her portrayal of Regina, and her next role in \"The Notebook,\" cemented her status in Hollywood.\n\nShe continued to dominate Hollywood over the next few years, starring in \"Wedding Crashers,\" \"Red Eye\" and \"The Family Stone,\" before taking a short break. After a four-year break, she came back with \"State of Play,\" \"The Time Traveler's Wife,\" \"Sherlock Holmes\" and its sequel, \"Midnight In Paris\" and \"The Vow.\"\n\n\"I didn't make a conscious decision to leave necessarily, but I did kind of make a decision to pause,\" she told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in May 2023. \"I didn't think I was dealing so well with my life changing so quickly, and being so much in the public eye. I was struggling with that a little bit, with the exposure. It did allow me to find myself, center myself, and know I could live without it if I had to.\"\n\nJUDY BLUME’S ‘ARE YOU THERE GOD? IT’S ME, MARGARET’ GETS MOVIE ADAPTATION STARRING RACHEL MCADAMS, KATHY BATES\n\nThe actress went on to star in \"About Time,\" \"Aloha,\" \"Spotlight,\" which earned her an Academy Award nomination and SAG Award win, \"True Detective,\" \"Doctor Strange,\" and its sequel, \"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga\" and most recently, \"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.\"\n\nMcAdams has a son and daughter with her partner Jamie Linden, who she has been dating since 2016.\n\nAmanda Seyfried\n\nBefore landing her breakout role as Karen Smith in \"Mean Girls,\" Amanda Seyfried got her start on soap operas \"As the World Turns\" and \"All My Children.\" After her breakthrough, Seyfried had a recurring role in \"Veronica Mars\" and a starring role in \"Big Love,\" from 2006 to 2011.\n\nIn that time, she cemented her status in Hollywood through the movies \"Mamma Mia,\" \"Jennifer's Body,\" \"Dear John,\" \"Letters to Juliet\" and \"Red Riding Hood.\" She then showed off her singing voice in the 2012 Oscar nominated film adaptation of \"Les Miserables,\" later starring in \"A Million Ways to Die in the West,\" \"Ted 2,\" \"Pan\" and \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.\"\n\nNext, she starred in \"The Art of Racing in the Rain\" and \"Mank,\" which earned her an Academy Award nomination, later starring in \"A Mouthful of Air\" and \"The Dropout,\" which earned her an Emmy Award and Golden Globe win. Most recently, she starred in \"The Crowded Room\" and \"Seven Veils.\"\n\nSeyfried married Thomas Sadoski in 2017, and they have two children, Nina and Thomas.\n\nLacey Chabert\n\nLacey Chabert had been acting since she was a child and was known for her role in \"Party of Five,\" before starring as Gretchen Wieners in \"Mean Girls.\"\n\nIn addition to acting on screen, Chabert is also a prolific voice actor, voicing characters in \"The Wild Thornberrys,\" \"Bratz,\" \"The Spectacular Spider-Man,\" \"Robot Chicken,\" \"Kulipari,\" \"Transformers: Rescue Bots,\" \"Shimmer and Shine,\" \"Young Justice,\" \"Harriet the Spy\" and in many video games.\n\nIn 2010, Chabert starred in her first Hallmark movie, \"Elevator Girl,\" going on to star in over 30 movies for the network.
