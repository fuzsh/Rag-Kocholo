        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nRachel McAdams turns 44 on November 17.\n\nInsider ranked every single movie she's appeared in using Rotten Tomatoes' critics' reviews.\n\nHer best-reviewed movie, \"Spotlight,\" also gained her an Oscar nomination.\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time by visiting our Preferences page or by clicking \"unsubscribe\" at the bottom of the email.\n\nMcAdams' lowest-rated movie is 2015's \"Aloha.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 20%\n\n\"Aloha,\" written and directed by Cameron Crowe, follows a former US Air Force officer, played by Bradley Cooper, as he returns to Hawaii to oversee the launch of a new weapons satellite. McAdams plays the ex-girlfriend of Cooper's character, who is now married to another Air Force pilot, played by John Krasinski.\n\n\"It's not bad so much as alien, like a romantic comedy made by someone who's researched human behavior but had very few brushes with it in person,\" wrote Buzzfeed's Alison Willmore.\n\nIn \"The Hot Chick,\" McAdams plays the titular hot chick.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 21%\n\nMcAdams and Rob Schneider co-star in this broad body-switch comedy, as Jessica (McAdams), a stereotypical cheerleader, and Clive (Schneider), a small-time criminal, switch bodies by each wearing a cursed earring that Jessica stole. Typical hijinks ensue, they both evolve as people, and they switch back.\n\n\"I didn't expect a masterpiece, but it's basic Rob Schneider at his worst,\" wrote Cinema Crazed's Felix Vasquez Jr.\n\nIn the German film \"Every Thing Will Be Fine,\" McAdams plays Sara, the main character's girlfriend.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 28%\n\nMcAdams plays Sara, the girlfriend of James Franco's character Tomas Elden, a novelist who doesn't want to commit to marriage and kids — after he accidentally kills a child, his life begins to spiral out of control.\n\n\"'Every Thing Will Be Fine' is downright strange. Some of the visual choices really feel like conscious decisions to do something interesting with the format, but the strain is palpable and the subject matter is handled embarrassingly,\" wrote Cinema Scope's Adam Cook.\n\n\"The Vow\" attempted to recreate the magic of \"The Notebook\" and \"Dear John\" with little success.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 31%\n\nMcAdams and Channing Tatum star as Paige and Leo Collins, a very happily married couple — that is, until Paige is involved in a horrible car accident and loses all memories of her husband. Paige's quest to regain her memories and understand her life is interwoven with memories of the beginning of their love story. It's all very cheesy.\n\n\"The two stars look dewy and glossy and unexceptional, bound together less by chemistry than by the ministrations of a hard-working costume designer,\" wrote Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly.\n\nMcAdams plays Christine in Brian de Palma's erotic thriller \"Passion.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 33%\n\nChristine, a successful advertising executive living in Germany, has a troubled relationship with her protégé Isabelle (Noomi Rapace). As the tension grows, Christine turns up dead, and Isabelle is forced to try and prove her innocence.\n\n\"Filled with dumb plot twists, schemes and hammy performances from Rachel McAdams and Noomi Rapace, 'Passion' is De Palma gleefully making a mess and daring the audience to keep watching,\" Way Too Indie's CJ Prince wrote.\n\nIn \"The Lucky Ones,\" McAdams plays a US Army soldier named Colee.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 37%\n\nWhen three soldiers, Colee (McAdams), Fred (Tim Robbins), and T.K. (Michael Peña) are stranded at JFK Airport while on 30-day leave, the three strangers decide to rent a van to drive out west, as each has their own task to complete. Predictably, they bond.\n\n\"As they hit the road, the scenes play out like TV sitcom vignettes with little holding the centre together. We find out details about the characters lives, but never feel we know them,\" wrote Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star.\n\n\"The Time Traveler's Wife\" is the lesser of the time-travel romances that McAdams stars in.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 38%\n\nBased on the 2003 best-selling novel of the same name, McAdams plays Clare, the titular time traveler's wife. Her husband, Henry (Eric Bana), is born with a rare condition that makes him spontaneously travel through time. The film follows their love story, complicated by all the time travel.\n\n\"Buy the book,\" Richard Roeper simply stated.\n\nMcAdams plays the secondary love interest (again) in Terrence Malick's \"To the Wonder.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 47%\n\nAfter Neil (Ben Affleck) has an emotional break-up with Marina (Olga Kurylenko), he reconnects with his childhood friend Jane (McAdams). However, the real love story is between Neil and Marina, and Jane is left broken-hearted by Neil's inability to commit.\n\n\"Love is a many-splendored thing, except when it isn't in 'To the Wonder,' a wispy romantic movie about the death of a romance,\" wrote the Orange County Register's Michael Sragow.\n\nIn \"The Family Stone,\" a Christmas family rom-com, McAdams plays Amy, the youngest Stone who doesn't hold anything back.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 52%\n\nWhen the eldest Stone, Everett (Dermot Mulroney), brings home his girlfriend Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) for Christmas, clashing personalities, holiday stress, and two sibling love interest switches cause tension. McAdams plays Amy, the youngest Stone sibling, who refuses to sugarcoat her opinion of Meredith.\n\n\"Some will find it touching, some will be too weary of the plot contrivances and the smug Stone family to care,\" Moira MacDonald of the Seattle Times wrote.\n\nMcAdams and Ryan Gosling star in the romantic classic \"The Notebook.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 53%\n\nAn older man, played by James Garner, tells his friend in a nursing home the love story of Noah (Gosling) and Allie (McAdams), who overcome class differences, stolen letters, another man, and a World War to create a life for themselves. It's based on the Nicholas Sparks novel of the same name.\n\nLeslie Felperin of the Times wrote, \"A honey-dipped love story with a surprisingly tart aftertaste, 'The Notebook' is a better-than-you'd-expect adaptation of Nicholas Sparks's bestselling novel of the same name.\"\n\nIn \"Married Life,\" McAdams plays a war widow, Kay Nesbitt.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 54%\n\n\"Married Life\" follows Richard, played by Pierce Brosnan, who convinces his friend Harry, played by Chris Cooper, to stop cheating on his wife with Kay — but only so Richard and Kay can start their own relationship. Harry, however, is determined to be with Kay, and rather than divorce his wife, he decides to poison her.\n\n\"This darkly comic dramatic thriller, which is set just after World War II, is more than merely watchable. It's very smart and is old-fashioned in several respects,\" wrote the Deseret News' Jeff Vice.\n\nMcAdams returned to the rom-com space with \"Morning Glory.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 55%\n\nMcAdams plays Becky, a TV producer who gets called in to save \"Daybreak,\" a failing morning news show. She calls in legendary journalist Mike Pomeroy, played by a very curmudgeonly Harrison Ford, to co-host. While juggling the two hosts' personalities, she also falls in love with Patrick Wilson's Adam Bennett, a fellow producer.\n\nTim Robey of the Daily Telegraph wrote, \"'Morning Glory' stays firmly on the launchpad, doing increasingly desperate run-ups, but collapsing in a gawky heap whenever it tries to take off.\"\n\nMcAdams briefly reprised her role as Irene Adler in \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 59%\n\nRobert Downey Jr., Jude Law, and McAdams all return for the 2011 \"Sherlock Holmes\" sequel, but McAdams' appearance is just a cameo before she's seemingly murdered by legendary \"Sherlock\" nemesis Moriarty. The rest of the film is a battle between Holmes and Moriarty.\n\n\"It's complete trash and makes a mockery of Holmes's vaunted deductive reasoning,\" wrote Bruce Diones of the New Yorker.\n\nIn \"Southpaw,\" McAdams plays Maureen, the wife of the main character.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 60%\n\nJake Gyllenhaal plays Billy, a successful boxer, who is married to Maureen (McAdams). After Billy takes a few too many hard hits, Maureen begs him to quit, however Billy refuses — this inadvertently leads to Maureen getting shot by one of Billy's rivals. The movie then follows Billy's spiral into addiction and eventual triumph.\n\n\"The modicum of pleasure delivered by 'Southpaw' arrives thanks to its cast, who struggle bravely and energetically with the hopelessly bland text and the invisible, impersonal direction,\" wrote the New Yorker's Richard Brody.\n\nMcAdams and Will Ferrell co-star as the Icelandic Eurovision contestants in Netflix's \"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 63%\n\nFerrell and McAdams play Lars Erickssong and Sigrit Ericksdóttir, long-time best friends who compete in Eurovision, the European singing competition, as underdogs who are only Iceland's entrants because all the other contestants died in a boat explosion — yes, we promise, it's a comedy.
