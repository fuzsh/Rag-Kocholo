        "text": "Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a successful, confident surgeon in New York City. When a devastating car accident injures his hands, his career is put on hold. Christine Palmer (McAdams) is an emergency surgeon who plays a significant role in his life. She and Stephen dated previously, broke up, and remained friends after the end of their relationship. Following his accident, Christine helps him recover and sticks by his side as he relentlessly tries to find alternative treatments to save his hands. Through his healing, Stephen discovers alternate dimensions and magical powers, which can help to defeat Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), who is on a spree of evil.\n\n\"Get in, loser, we're going shopping\" might just be one of the most recited movie quotes of all time, and it was said by none other than McAdams in the 2004 comedy \"Mean Girls.\" Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) is a new student at North Shore High School and struggles to fit in among the large student body that is divided by cliques. She connects with school outcasts Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and Damian Leigh (Daniel Franzese), who warn her of the school's elite clique, the Plastics, consisting of leader Regina George (McAdams), Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert), and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried).\n\nWhen Cady develops a crush on Regina's ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels, she hatches a plan with Janis and Damian to infiltrate the Plastics, ruin Regina's queen-bee reputation, and win over Aaron.\n\nIn \"Mean Girls,\" McAdams is perfectly snobby and posh, making her role one that is constantly revisited nearly 20 years later.\n\nWhen it comes to romantic movies, \"The Notebook\" is arguably the blueprint. Based on the acclaimed bestselling novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks, the film follows a captivating love story that withstands trials and hardships across many years.\n\nIn the present day, an elderly man named Duke (James Garner) agrees to read a love story to a woman in their nursing home. Meanwhile, back in 1940, Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) meets 17-year-old Allie Hamilton at a carnival and falls for her right away. Noah comes from a humble background and works as a mill worker while Allie comes from a rich family. The two spend their summer together and fall in love, against the wishes of Allie's family, whose protestations ultimately break them up. The movie follows how Allie and Noah reconnect years later as they try to rekindle their love story, and by the end, a mind-blowing connection between the 1940s couple and Duke is revealed.\n\nIn the creative screen adaptation of the beloved character by author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, \"Sherlock Holmes\" delivers a refreshing, humorous take on the classic mystery stories. Detective Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his partner Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) are put to work to stop a string of murders by Lord Henry Blackwood. During this time, Holmes is approached by Irene Adler (McAdams), a former rival, to help solve a missing-person case. In the film, Holmes and Adler have a playful, romantic dynamic that ultimately helps them work together and fight new criminal cases in London.\n\nSimilar to many other films McAdams starred in throughout the 2000s, \"Wedding Crashers\" is a romantic comedy that highlights her ability to take on any kind of role. The film centers around friends John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn), who are divorce mediators by day and womanizers by night. The pair routinely crash weddings to hook up with beautiful women at the ceremonies. When the two infiltrate the wedding on US Secretary of the Treasury William Cleary's (Christopher Walken) eldest daughter, John and Jeremy find themselves breaking their own shallow sex rules and actually falling in love with the women they meet. The only problem? John is in love with Claire Cleary (McAdams), who is engaged to be married. Now, the two have to conceal their past to land their dream girls.\n\nMcAdams shines in the lighthearted comedy \"Morning Glory\" alongside a star-studded cast that includes Diane Keaton, Harrison Ford, and Jeff Goldblum. Becky Fuller (McAdams) has dreamed of being a big-time television producer all her life and works relentlessly to be taken seriously by her peers and superiors. After she is fired from her job, she is taken on as a producer on the national morning show \"DayBreak,\" which is suffering with declining viewership.
