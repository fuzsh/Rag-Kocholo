        "text": "\"Ladies and gentlemen, once again, Renee Rapp!\" she announced to cheers from the audience as she gestured over to the stage.\n\nRapp then performed \"Not My Fault,\" which appears on the soundtrack of the \"Mean Girls\" remake. Megan Thee Stallion, who is featured on the song, joined her onstage in a second surprise cameo.\n\nAt the end of the episode, both McAdams and Rapp joined host Jacob Elordi onstage as he said his goodbyes to the audience and could be seen blowing kisses to each other.\n\nAfter the show, Megan â€” who raps in \"Not My Fault\" that she is the \"Black Regina George\" â€” shared to her Instagram a fun behind-the-scenes photo of herself, McAdams, and Rapp recreating the famous Spider-Man pointing at Spider-Man meme.\n\n\"Cause huhhh ðŸ¥¹ all the Reginas in one room ðŸ¤­ðŸ’– #snl\" Megan captioned the post.\n\nWhile other members of the OG \"Mean Girls\" cast, such as Lindsay Lohan and Amanda Seyfried, have thrown their support behind the new Gen-Z-centered reboot, McAdams's appearance alongside her Regina George successor has come as a bit of a surprise.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated star declined the offer to appear in a Walmart's Black Friday commercial with her fellow \"Mean Girls\" plastics in 2023, telling Variety: \"I guess I wasn't that excited about doing a commercial if I'm being totally honest.\"\n\nIn the same interview, she shared that while she \"dabbled' in a few ideas with writer Tina Fey, unlike Lohan, she ultimately chose not to make a cameo in the film.\n\nIt may have been Rapp herself who caught McAdams' attention in the end. The \"Sex Lives of College Girls\" actor appeared on \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" last week and was asked if she had any notes for McAdams after taking over the role.\n\n\"Any notes for her?\" Rapp asked before suggesting: \"Date me?\"\n\nAs the studio audience applauded Rapp's answer, Colbert told her: \"She might be watching, you never know!\""
