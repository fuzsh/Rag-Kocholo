        "text": "June 25 marks 20 years since the release of \"The Notebook,\" starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams.\n\nDespite initial tensions, Gosling and McAdams' chemistry contributed to the film's success, and they eventually dated.\n\nHere's a look back on their relationship.\n\nIn June 2004, we were not only given a big-screen adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' best-selling novel \"The Notebook\" but also one of the steamiest celebrity couples of the aughts: Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams.\n\n\"The Notebook\" was the breakout hit for both then-rising stars. The film chronicles the relationship between Noah (Gosling) and Allie (McAdams) from the 1940s through the present day, as the now elderly Noah (James Garner) retells Allie (Gena Rowlands) their love story, as she suffers from dementia.\n\nThough its release in theaters was initially soft, by the end of its run, the movie earned over $118 million worldwide on a $29 million budget. It's now considered one of the best romantic movies of the last two decades.\n\nA major reason for that is the chemistry between Gosling and McAdams, which started with the two hating each other on set and concluded with them dating for a few years after filming wrapped.\n\nThe two stars' love was on full display while promoting \"The Notebook,\" most notably with their famous kiss onstage at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards.\n\nIn honor of the 20-year anniversary of the film's release in theaters, here are the best photos of Gosling and McAdams promoting \"The Notebook.\"\n\nRachel McAdams starred in the 2002 Rob Schneider comedy \"The Hot Chick\" and \"Mean Girls\" in early 2004 before \"The Notebook,\" which marked her first major lead role.\n\nRyan Gosling starred in the Denzel Washington football movie \"Remember the Titans,\" the Sandra Bullock thriller \"Murder by Numbers,\" and the indie movie \"The Believer\" before \"The Notebook.\"\n\nIt definitely wasn't love at first sight for Gosling and McAdams. In fact, director Nick Cassavetes said the two got into a screaming match once while filming.\n\nCassavetes revealed Gosling had also asked him to replace McAdams.\n\nBut by the time filming ended, a love between the two had sparked.\n\nIn 2005, Gosling and McAdams gave us one of the most memorable moments in MTV Movie Awards history when they reenacted their streamy kiss from \"The Notebook.\"\n\nThey were accepting the award for — you guessed it — best kiss.\n\nThe two had fun with \"The Kiss\" moment at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards a few months later.\n\nWhile accepting the award for best chemistry, McAdams locked lips with presenter Ryan Reynolds.\n\n\"I think I got the wrong Ryan,\" McAdams said once she got on the mic.\n\nGosling and McAdams broke up in 2007.\n\nBut it's not all bad: Gosling has been in a relationship with Eva Mendes since 2011, and McAdams has been dating screenwriter Jamie Linden since 2016."
