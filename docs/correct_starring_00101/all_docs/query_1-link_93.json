        "text": "Twenty years — that's right, two decades — later, the that secured Millennial folly into cinematic history has undergone a radical Gen Z makeover.\n\nIts core, however, has remained untouched by time, creative vision and even that pesky (I feel like a Boomer writing this) \"woke\" culture and social cognizance that has killed many a comedy before it. After all, plastic is forever, and The Plastics are back to judge, control and manipulate fresh meat like they never left the early aughts. It's a fable as old as high school itself, cemented by human fallacy and teenage idiocracy.\n\nIn other words, a tale as old as time, biyotch, and timeless to boot.\n\nWith a book by SNL legend Tina Fey, who also wrote the original film, music by her husband Jeff Richmond and lyrics by Nell Benjamin, the musical adaptation premiered in 2017 to mixed reviews from critics, though it was generally well accepted by audiences. With enough momentum and relevancy to propel yet another property into the canon, the film adaptation of the musical premieres this week. With a more accessible ticket price than its Broadway counterpart, will reach new audiences, perhaps some too young to remember the raucous surprise and quotable popularity of its source material, thereby introducing a new generation eager to wear pink on Wednesdays or spontaneously yell, \"You go, Glen Coco!\"\n\nWhat is that didn't-age-well quote about high school girls? We may all get older, but they stay the same age. In this case, the film's cast (who were likely still in diapers in 2004), feel like they are actually in high school here in 2024. Though most flirt with the legal drinking age, their vibe leans far closer to late adolescence than in the previous iteration. Notoriously, the OG Regina George, played by actress Rachel McAdams, who was 26 when she filled the Queen Bee stilettos, and while she conveyed Regina's conniving, controlling and calculating reign with memorable zing, there is something new Regina does differently.\n\nReneé Rapp, who played the part on Broadway and who has become somewhat of a Gen Z icon following her role in and bourgeoning music career, makes a terrifying and intimidating Regina George acquisition. Gone are most of the mini-skirts (thank goodness) and tragic fashion choices from early in the millennium, replaced with the new look of not trying too hard.\n\nNo, Rapp's brand of cool girl chic is something much more dangerous than Juicy sweatpants and push-up bras. Her peacocking of choice is pure confidence. She need only give a pointed look or chilly gaze, and viewers might find themselves turning inward, talking themselves off the ledge of imagined ridicule. It's like Rapp, with a downplayed snap of her manicured finger, can break the fourth wall and transport us back to the horrors of high school insecurity.\n\nWith what seems like fewer lines of dialogue, not including the catchy musical number she sings throughout the film that mainly entails reminding audiences of who she is (\"My name is Regina George\"), Rapp doesn't need to be loud when she can simply be untouchable.\n\nIn case you've been living under a rock, \"Mean Girls\" tells the story of Cady Heron (Angourie Rice, a role originally played by 00s It Girl Lindsay Lohan), a sheltered teen who has been living in Kenya with her mom until she's uprooted and returned to suburban Illinois for the traditional high school experience. She immediately clicks with the outcast duo of Janis (Auli'i Cravalho, whose voice many parents may recognize from ) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), but she's drawn like a fly into a spider's web to the \"cool\" girls' table. \"The Plastics,\" as they are known through the halls, consist of Gretchen Wieners (Bebe Wood), Karen Shetty (Avantika) and their overlord, Regina George. Cady quickly finds the cute boy in school, Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), and she falls hard for him.\n\nEvery main player in this \"Mean Girls\" is flawlessly cast. Avantika's Karen is even more witless than Amanda Seyfried's take; she sips a Perrier through her nose and gives a hilarious solo during the Halloween party. Wood's Gretchen Wieners carries the essence of her predecessor, played by Lacey Chabert, and Cravalho's Janis gives some of the film's best musical moments, rival only to Rapp's mammoth screen presence and singing voice. And Rice, a veteran screen actress, who has an impressive IMDb list already, brings a demure, believably innocent side to Cady and handily carries the film's heart and soul in her performance.\n\nRegina used to date Aaron, and Cady's sudden interest in him forces Regina to reclaim the boy as her own. Reverting to her knowledge of African predators, Cady concocts a plan to hunt her new frenemy and dethrone her from the top of the high school food chain. In the process, Cady loses herself to the artificial and toxic hunt for acceptance and popularity.\n\nWith a handful of returning characters — Fey reprises her role as math teacher Ms. Norbury and Tim Meadows as the frustrated principal — \"Mean Girls\" makes fetch happen again. The music is artfully woven through the film, integrated in a way that feels fresh and organic. There is a smattering of new witty jokes, but the iconic one-liners have remained intact. (\"On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.\"; \"So you admit it. You think you're really pretty.\"; \"That's why her hair is so big.\")\n\nThe thing about this adaptation is that the story hasn't been altered even one inch. There aren't glaring omissions or daring new additions. Cady's journey sticks to the path laid by its source material down to the fake teeth of the bloody bride Halloween costume.\n\n\"Mean Girls\" is as you remember, but heightened, updated and, dare I say it, darker. Some fans of the original will likely poo-poo this iteration with cries of unoriginality, but it was a suicide mission from the outset. The first film was a near-perfect comedy that still holds a generation later. If you open your heart to a second child, there is certainly enough room to love this new addition to the plastic collection.\n\n\"Mean Girls\" is in theaters now."
