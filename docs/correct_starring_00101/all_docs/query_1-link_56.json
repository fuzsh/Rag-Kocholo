        "text": "The start of 2024 brought a new rendition of \"Mean Girls\" to the big screen, 20 years after the original film was released. After the original movie was released in 2004, based off the self-help book, \"Queen Bees and Wannabes,\" it took many years for the plot to emerge once again, this time as a musical. The musical first hit the stage in Washington, D.C., in 2017 before opening on Broadway the following year.\n\nThe 2024 rendition of the classic film is based off the musical. The musical follows the original movie's plot quite closely, so the main storyline of the 2024 film shares many similarities to the original, with a musical twist.\n\nBeing that the two movies follow the same story, there wasn't a lot of room for the original actors to join the cast, but there were a couple that returned to their beloved roles. The 2024 film brings plenty of fresh new faces to the story, with many of the young cast members at the beginning of their careers in Hollywood.\n\n‘MEAN GIRLS’ TURNS 20: LINDSAY LOHAN, RACHEL MCADAMS THEN AND NOW\n\nTake a look at the main cast of \"Mean Girls\" from 2004 and 2024.\n\nRegina George\n\n2004: Rachel McAdams\n\nRachel McAdams emerged as the Queen of the Plastics in the original \"Mean Girls\" film. This was a breakthrough role for McAdams, who would go on to create a long and successful career for herself in Hollywood.\n\nThe same year \"Mean Girls\" was released, McAdams was part of another movie with a completely opposite mood: \"The Notebook\" with Ryan Gosling.\n\n2024: Reneé Rapp\n\nReneé Rapp may be new to playing George on-screen, but the character is no stranger to her.\n\nRapp played George on Broadway from 2019 to 2020. As for her movie roles, the new film is her biggest to date. One other show she is known for is \"The Sex Lives of College Girls.\"\n\nRACHEL MCADAMS STOLE THE SHOW AS REGINA GEORGE IN ‘MEAN GIRLS,’ BUT THESE ACTRESSES AUDITIONED, TOO\n\nPrior to \"Mean Girls,\" Rapp was known more for her music than her acting. After playing George on Broadway, she released her first EP, \"Everything To Everyone,\" in 2022 and her first full-length album, \"Snow Angel,\" in 2023.\n\nCady Heron\n\n2004: Lindsay Lohan\n\nLindsay Lohan played the awkward, geeky new girl from Africa in the original \"Mean Girls\" movie.\n\nLohan was part of multiple wildly successful remakes that really put her on the map leading up to this classic film. She played both twin sisters in \"The Parent Trap\" in 1998, a remake of the 1961 film. She did many TV movies for Disney, including the hit \"Freaky Friday\" in 2003, based on the original 1976 film.\n\nHot off \"Freaky Friday,\" Lohan was in \"Mean Girls,\" a movie directed by Mark Waters, with whom she also worked on the successful Disney film.\n\n2024: Angourie Rice\n\nAustralian actress Angourie Rice plays Cady Heron in the 2024 remake. Before taking on this leading role, Rice played Betty, the short-term girlfriend of Ned in \"Spider-Man: Far From Home.\"\n\nKaren Smith\n\n2004: Amanda Seyfried\n\n\"Mean Girls\" served as a breakthrough role for young Amanda Seyfried who went on to find a lot of success in movies and television shows across genres after playing Karen Smith.\n\nAMANDA SEYFRIED WAS 'REALLY GROSSED OUT' BY THE MALE REACTION TO HER WEATHER GIRL SCENE IN 'MEAN GIRLS'\n\nAfter playing Smith, Seyfried went on to take roles in many musical movies, like \"Mamma Mia!\" in 2008 and its 2018 sequel, as well as \"Les Misérables,\" in which she played Cosette, in 2012. Seyfried also starred in the romantic drama \"Dear John\" in 2010, \"Mank\" in 2020 and the show \"The Crowded Room\" in 2023.\n\n2024: Avantika Vandanapu\n\nAvantika Vandanapu is Smith in the new \"Mean Girls\" movie. Vandanapu is the star and executive producer of \"A Crown of Wishes\" series that she sold to Disney+, according to her website.\n\nHer breakout role was in the 2022 Disney Channel movie \"Spin.\"\n\nGretchen Wieners\n\n2004: Lacey Chabert\n\nIn 2004, Gretchen Wieners was played by Lacey Chabert. Gretchen, a loyal friend to George (for most of the movie anyway), played a young Cosette in \"Les Misérables\" on Broadway for two years.\n\nHer debut on the big screen was in \"Lost and Space\" in 1998.\n\nTHE SCIENCE BEHIND WHY ‘MEAN GIRLS’ ARE OFTEN SO POPULAR EVEN AS ADULTS\n\n2024: Bebe Wood\n\nBebe Wood is Gretchen Wieners in the 2024 movie. She has done a lot of TV work over the years, like in \"The Real O'Neals,\" \"The New Normal\" and \"Love, Victor.\"\n\nHer movie experience has been minimal so far, with three movie credits to her name, including the 2024 musical movie.\n\nAaron Samuels\n\n2004: Jonathan Bennett\n\nAaron Samuels, the old boyfriend of George's and new boyfriend of Heron's, was first played by Jonathan Bennett in 2004.\n\nBeyond his role in \"Mean Girls,\" Bennett is known for being in \"Cheaper by the Dozen 2\" and the television show \"Awkward.\"\n\nAt the end of January 2024, Bennett begins his debut run on Broadway in \"Spamalot.\"\n\n2024: Christopher Briney\n\nChristopher Briney jumped from one heartthrob to another with his newest role.\n\nLINDSAY LOHAN JOINS ‘MEAN GIRLS’ CAST AT THE MUSICAL FILM'S PREMIERE IN NEW YORK\n\nBriney doesn't have a lot of acting credit to his name yet, but he grew a large fan base after playing Conrad Fisher in the show \"The Summer I Turned Pretty.\"\n\nJanis\n\n2004: Lizzy Caplan\n\nCharacters Janis and Damian are a favored duo in the \"Mean Girls\" franchise. Janis first emerged in 2004 with Lizzy Caplan taking on the role. \"Mean Girls\" is one of Caplan's most notable roles, but she can also be found in movies like \"Cloverfield,\" \"Hot Tub Time Machine\" and \"The Night Before.\"\n\n2024: Auli'i Cravalho\n\nYou may recognize the voice of Janis' character in the 2024 film as the actress Auli'i Cravalho, who was also the voice of animated character Moana in 2016.\n\nDamian\n\n2004: Daniel Franzese\n\nDamian, the character behind the quotable line, \"She doesn't even go here,\" was first spoken by Daniel Franzese when he played the role in 2004.\n\nAnother movie Franzese is known for is \"Bully,\" which came before \"Mean Girls\" in 2001.\n\n2024: Jaquel Spivey\n\nJaquel Spivey marked his first movie with \"Mean Girls\" in 2024. Before this, he was on Broadway where he performed in \"A Strange Loop\" in 2022.\n\nCady's Mom\n\n2004: Ana Gasteyer\n\nAlthough both \"Mean Girls\" movies mainly revolve around teenagers, there are a few appearances from mothers.\n\nGeorge's mom was first played by Ana Gasteyer in 2004. Gasteyer was mainly known for her work on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\n2024: Jenna Fischer\n\nJenna Fischer steps into the role in 2024. Fischer has been in many projects over the years, with her most popular role as Pam Beesly in \"The Office.\"\n\nLINDSAY LOHAN'S HOLLYWOOD COMEBACK: A LOOK BACK AT HER TROUBLED LIFE IN THE SPOTLIGHT\n\nRegina's mom\n\n2004: Amy Poehler\n\nGeorge's mom, the self-proclaimed \"cool mom,\" was first played by Amy Poehler. Poehler, known for movies and television shows like \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"Saturday Night Live,\" \"Baby Mama\" and \"Inside Out,\" has been friends and co-workers with \"Mean Girls\" writer and star Tina Fey for many years.\n\n2024: Busy Philipps\n\nBusy Philipps is the one cheering her daughter and friends on during the school talent show in the 2024 movie.\n\nPhilipps has lots of comedy work under her belt in movies like \"White Chicks\" and \"He's Just Not That Into You.\"\n\nMs. Norbury\n\n2004 and 2024: Tina Fey\n\nAs the writer of both movies, it comes as no surprise that Tina Fey is a part of both films. In the classic and the remake, she plays high school teacher Ms. Nobury.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFey is known for her work in comedy shows like \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"30 Rock,\" a show of her creation.\n\nPrincipal Duvall\n\n2004 and 2024: Tim Meadows\n\nTim Meadows, another \"Saturday Night Live\" star, went back to his role as North Shore principal for the 2024 film.\n\nFey and Meadows fit into the cast of the new movie more easily than the younger actors of the original film, as they were both in adult-aged roles in 2004."
