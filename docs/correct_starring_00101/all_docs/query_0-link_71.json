        "text": "Regina George had better things to do.\n\nRachel McAdams revealed in a new interview why she didn’t reprise her “Mean Girls” role when much of the rest of the film’s cast reunited for a recent Walmart advertisement.\n\n“I don’t know; I guess I wasn’t that excited about doing a commercial if I’m being totally honest,” McAdams, 45, told Variety while speaking about her recent film “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret” on Wednesday.\n\n”A movie sounded awesome, but I’ve never done commercials, and it just didn’t feel like my bag,” the Oscar nominee continued.\n\n“Also … I didn’t know that everyone was doing it. I would, of course, always love to be a part of a ‘Mean Girls’ reunion and hang with my plastics, but yeah, I found that out later.”\n\nThe ad, which was released last month ahead of Black Friday, stars Lindsay Lohan as North Shore High’s new guidance counselor alongside former co-stars Lacey Chabert, Amanda Seyfried, Daniel Franzese and Rajiv Surendra.\n\n“Some things never change. On Wednesdays we wear pink, but now we shop Walmart Black Friday deals,” Lohan says as Cady Heron while Gretchen Weiners (Chabert) pulls up in a sports car filled with Walmart bags.\n\nWalmart’s clever marketing ploy also revisited several of the film’s iconic moments, from Karen Smith’s (Seyfried) weather report claiming that “there is a 30% chance it is already Wednesday,” to the famous “Jingle Bell Rock” routine.\n\nAn insider previously told Page Six that McAdams simply “didn’t want to do it” at the time.\n\n“They were all offered it. But the three of them loved being together for their reunion,” the insider continued. “They had a great time talking about being moms, and it was definitely a loss not having Rachel there.”\n\nAccording to the source, there was no animosity between the quartet.\n\nDespite passing on the ad, McAdams was close to making a cameo in the upcoming “Mean Girls” musical film.\n\n“Tina [Fey] and I sort of dabbled with a few ideas, but it was tough to make it all work in the end,” McAdams explained to Variety. “I was really down for whatever she wanted to do. I think the direction it went in will be fantastic and I cannot wait to see it.”\n\nThe film, which is based on the Broadway musical, stars Reneé Rapp as Regina George, Angourie Rice as Cady Heron, Bebe Wood as Gretchen Wieners, Avantika as Karen Shetty and Christopher Briney as Aaron Samuels.\n\nFey, who wrote the screenplay for the original film, is also slated to reprise her role as Ms. Norbury. Fellow “Saturday Night Live” alum Tim Meadows will return as Principal Duval too.\n\nThe film is slated to hit theaters in January 2024."
