        "text": "Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams recreated the classic phone scene fromMean Girls when they got together for a virtual reunion earlier this month.\n\nThe recreation, which Lohan has only just shared on Instagram, shows the actors reprising their roles as Cady Heron and Regina George, to re-enact their phone call about the North Shore High Spring Fling.\n\nIn the video, McAdams and Lohan can be seen virtually acting out the scene from their homes, spliced with footage of the original call. It also features appearances from the other Plastics, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried.\n\nFans loved the reunion, with one commenting: “This is the best thing to come out of 2020.”\n\n“We want a sequel with the original cast!” added another."
