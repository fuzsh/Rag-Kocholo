        "text": "Last month, some of the original Mean Girls cast reunited for a Walmart commercial. Lindsay Lohan, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried all reprised their original roles. So did Daniel Franzese (Damian) and Rajiv Surendra (Kevin G). Missy Elliott also makes an appearance as a gym teacher coaching teens on Black Friday deals. It’s pretty damn stupid.\n\nBut where, oh where, was Rachel McAdams’ Regina George? In a new interview with Variety, 45-year-old Rachel explains why she turned Walmart down:\n\n“I don’t know; I guess I wasn’t that excited about doing a commercial if I’m being totally honest. A movie sounded awesome, but I’ve never done commercials, and it just didn’t feel like my bag.”\n\nBut it wasn’t just her total disinterest in ads. Rachel also wasn’t aware the other Mean Girls actors were involved:\n\n“Also… I didn’t know that everyone was doing it. I would, of course, always love to be part of a ‘Mean Girls’ reunion and hang with my plastics, but yeah, I found that out later.”\n\nAfter Rachel’s revelations made headlines, actor Jonathan Bennett, aka Aaron Samuels, told E! News that he wasn’t in the Black Friday ad cuz he “was filming” and “couldn’t do it.” Um, thanks for the info, Jonathan. Here’s the commercial:\n\nRachel also tells Variety she won’t be making a cameo as Regina in the upcoming Mean Girls movie-musical, but, at one point, it was a very real possibility:\n\n“Tina and I sort of dabbled with a few ideas, but it was tough to make it all work in the end,” she says. “I was really down for whatever she wanted to do. I think the direction it went in will be fantastic and I cannot wait to see it.”\n\nIn other Rachel-Mean Girls “news”, I was scrolling on TikTok last night when I came across a video about Rachel’s Mean Girls wig. Apparently, she didn’t want to bleach her hair to play Regina George, so hairstylists hooked her up with a $10,000 wig."
