        "text": "The Premise: A 1940s summer romance fades when star-crossed lovers Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (McAdams) are torn apart by her disapproving family. Seven years later, a rain-soaked reunion rekindles the flame between them. On the cusp of marrying another man, Allie must choose between her new love or her first love.\n\nHow She Steals The Show: 2004 was McAdams's breakthrough year. On the pink-colored heels of her supporting role in Mean Girls, McAdams shined as the romantic lead in The Notebook, capturing hearts with her poignant portrayal of Allie. Her chemistry with Gosling is unmatched - earning the pair an MTV Movie Award for best kiss - and her emotive performance is applauded for its beauty and clarity, cementing her place alongside romantic drama royalty.\n\nLasting Impact: The Notebook is a quintessential chick flick. A frequent top-tier contender on best romantic movie lists - and revered as the most successful film adaptation of Nicholas Sparks's sentimental romance novels - this timeless tear-jerker is as enduring as Noah and Allie's love.\n\nThe Premise: Former homeschooler Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) enters the trenches of high school, navigating cutthroat social cliques and territorial teens. When she unwittingly joins the school's popular girl group, The Plastics, she gets plenty of lessons she didn't sign up for.\n\nHow She Steals The Show: McAdams is the ultimate mean girl, playing The Plastics' reigning queen bee, Regina George. Blazing in blond-haired, b*tchy glory, she's almost unrecognizable in contrast with her heartfelt portrayal of Allie in The Notebook - which was released the same year. Her catty quips and devious deeds may render Regina a villain, but the comedic charm McAdams brings to the character makes it hard to hate her.\n\nLasting Impact: Mean Girls is essentially Clueless for the 21st century. With quotable one-liners and Y2K fashion eye candy, the timeless teen comedy has endured the decades, inspiring a Gen Z revival in 2024. Unfortunately, McAdams didn't reprise her role in the 2024 version of Mean Girls, which may explain why it's not as fetch as the original.\n\nThe Premise: Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) is a young hopeless romantic with the ability to time-travel. Using his special gift, he steals the heart of the rapturous and beautiful Mary (Rachel McAdams). However, playing with time is like playing with fire, and the pages of their perfect love story are ultimately burned away. Traveling back in time over and over again, Tim alters the details of his past to save his future with Mary.\n\nHow She Steals The Show: McAdams's performance, according to RogerEbert.com reviewer Susan Wloszczyna, is \"infectiously fetching‚Äù in this romantic time-travel fantasy. She lights up the screen with a sweet, girl-next-door aura that pairs well with the Hugh Grant-coded charm of her romantic counterpart, Gleeson.\n\nLasting Impact: With an 82% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, About Time has aged well. Sparking comparisons to Groundhog Day, the decade-old fantastical tale is revered as an underrated classic in the time-traveling genre.\n\nThe Premise: After a near-fatal car wreck, newlywed Paige (McAdams) suffers significant memory loss, rendering her husband Leo (Channing Tatum) unrecognizable to her. Determined to return to marital bliss, Leo tries to capture her heart all over again.\n\nHow She Steals The Show: More heart-wrenching than heartwarming, The Vow finds McAdams in a role that challenges her to maintain her character's likability even when she's acting cold. As Paige struggles to recall memories of her husband, her frustration causes her to lash out at him multiple times. Despite her unsavory behavior, McAdams's nuanced portrayal of Paige keeps the audience rooting for her.\n\nLasting Impact: Fitting for a film about memory loss, The Vow was largely forgotten until a Netflix resurrection cast it back in the spotlight 12 years later. Released during Valentine's Day weekend in 2012, the romantic drama made a grand entrance at the box office in the No. 1 spot, but received tepid reviews in comparison with the two stars' previous romantic opuses, The Notebook (McAdams) and Dear John (Tatum).\n\nThe Premise: In The Time Traveler's Wife - based on Audrey Niffenegger's novel of the same name - Henry (Eric Bana) is a librarian with a rare genetic disorder that causes him to time-travel involuntarily. His wife Clare (McAdams) is troubled by his frequent vanishing acts, finding herself in a lonely marriage where every moment is fleeting.\n\nHow She Steals The Show: In the first of three films in which she unintentionally plays a time-traveler's love interest, McAdams is heart-achingly lovely as Clare. Measuring her performance against the book's underwritten character, one IMDb reviewer wrote that McAdams's luminous portrayal of Clare displays her ‚Äúunusual ability to make her characters feel real against all odds.‚Äù\n\nLasting Impact: An arguably underappreciated film, The Time Traveler's Wife is no stranger to being criticized for the absurdity of its plot. A 2022 effort to turn the story into an HBO series was met with similar distaste and critiques of aging poorly.\n\nThe Premise: In Wes Craven's turbulent thriller, Lisa Reisert (McAdams) is kidnapped aboard an overnight flight by a dashing, menacing stranger, Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy), attempting to entangle her in a villainous plot to assassinate the head of Homeland Security.\n\nHow She Steals The Show: In a departure from her typical romantic leads, McAdams gives a grounded performance as a woman navigating a dangerous situation. Following her top billings in The Notebook and Mean Girls, Roger Ebert hailed her as a rising star who brought ‚Äúmore presence and credibility\" to her role than expected.\n\nLasting Impact: It may not be one of the first films that comes to mind when recounting horror legend Wes Craven's works, but this stylish psychological thriller holds its own. Regarded as ‚Äúcriminally overlooked,‚Äù Red Eye is a gem in McAdams's early acting career."
