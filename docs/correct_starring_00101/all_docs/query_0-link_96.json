        "text": "Getty Images\n\nLast month, Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert brought back their “Mean Girls” characters in a Black Friday commercial for Walmart.\n\nOne noticeable character was missing… Regina George, played by Rachel McAdams.\n\nLindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried & Lacey Chabert’s Fetch ‘Mean Girls’ Reunion for Walmart!\n\nView Story\n\nRachel is explaining why she wasn’t part of the commercial, telling Variety, “I guess I wasn’t that excited about doing a commercial if I’m being totally honest. I’ve never done commercials, and it just didn’t feel like my bag.”\n\nMcAdams added, “I didn’t know that everyone was doing it. I would, of course, always love to be part of a ‘Mean Girls’ reunion and hang with my Plastics, but yeah, I found that out later.”\n\nRachel also shared her thoughts on the “Mean Girls” reboot, in which Reneé Rapp is starring as Regina.\n\nMcAdams won’t be part of the new film, explaining, “Tina and I sort of dabbled with a few ideas, but it was tough to make it all work in the end.”\n\n“I was really down for whatever she wanted to do,” Rachel emphasized. “I think the direction it went in will be fantastic and I cannot wait to see it.”"
