        "text": "Two decades after the original film’s release, Mean Girls is back in cinemas – albeit with a few tweaks.\n\nMost notably of these differences is the fact that the new Mean Girls movie is a musical (based on the hit Broadway musical of the same name), but it’s also been given a series of changes to make it more fitting with the present day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s also got a whole new cast, led by Angourie Rice and Renée Rapp, although a few familiar faces from the original have also put in appearances.\n\nAnd if any of the new actors gave you a sense of déjà vu, here’s our guide to where you’ve seen the stars of Mean Girls 2024 before…\n\nAngourie Rice as Cady Heron\n\nAustralian star Angourie Rice takes the lead in this new version of Mean Girls, inheriting the role of Cady Heron which was first made famous by Lindsay Lohan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile most of us probably know Angourie best from her role as Kate Winslet’s on-screen daughter in the hit drama Mare Of Easttown, she also plays Betty Brant in Marvel’s latest Spider-Man movies.\n\nShe’s also appeared in the Black Mirror episode Rachel, Jack And Ashley Too (yes, the one with Miley Cyrus in the purple wig) and acted in the comedies Senior Year and Honor Society.\n\nRenée Rapp plays Regina George\n\nRenée Rapp is returning to the role of Regina George, which she previously played on Broadway.\n\nAside from her work in Mean Girls, Renée is probably most well-known as a singer rather than an actor, with her debut album Snow Angel peaking at number seven in the UK last year.\n\nShe’s also played a leading role in the Mindy Kaling comedy The Sex Lives Of College Girls, opposite Amrit Kaur and Pauline Chalamet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBebe Wood Gretchen Wieners\n\nMean Girls is far from Bebe Wood’s first time at the teen comedy rodeo.\n\nBefore landing the role of Gretchen Wieners, she appeared in Ryan Murphy’s family sitcom The New Normal as a child actor, and later played one of the main characters in Disney+’s Love Victor.\n\nShe also first crossed paths with Tina Fey at the age of just 11, when she appeared in an episode of the sitcom 30 Rock.\n\nAvantika as Karen Shetty\n\nAt just 18 years old, Avantika already has a string of impressive credits to her name, including Indian films like Manamantha, Rarandoi Veduka Chudham and Balakrishnudu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney fans might recognise Avantika from the Disney Channel Original Movie Spin, which she took the lead in, and later lent her voice to Mira, Royal Detective and the Gina Rodriguez sitcom Diary Of A Future President.\n\nShe also had a minor role in the Netflix comedy Senior Year, which her future Mean Girls co-star Angourie Rice also had a minor role in.\n\nAuliʻi Cravalho as Janis ’Imi’ike\n\nYou might not recognise Auliʻi Cravalho’s face, but you’ve definitely heard her voice – as she’s both Moana’s singing and speaking voice in the hit Disney movie. She later played another Disney princess in the concert version of The Little Mermaid, which co-starred Queen Latifah, Shaggy and John Stamos.\n\nHer other live-action credits include the Netflix drama All Together Now and the TV adaptation of the hit novel The Power, which debuted on Amazon Prime last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJaquel Spivey as Damian\n\nAlready a big name within the world of musical theatre, Jaquel Spivey plate the role of Usher in the Broadway play A Strange Loop, earning him his first Tony and Grammy nominations in 2022.\n\nMean Girls marks his first on-screen credit.\n\nChristopher Briney as Aaron Samuels\n\nChristopher Briney’s breakthrough moment came when he played Conrad Fisher in the coming-of-age series The Summer I Turned Pretty.\n\nHe’s also appeared in the film Dalíland, based on the life of surrealist artist Savlador Dalí.\n\nBusy Philipps as Mrs George\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegina George’s mum was a small-but-iconic role for Amy Poehler in the original Mean Girls film, and this time around she’s played by Busy Philipps.\n\nAfter her early appearances in Dawson’s Creek and Freaks And Geeks (sadly, no, not all of her on-screen credits rhyme), Busy landed a role opposite Courteney Cox in her biggest post-Friends show, Cougar Town, which earned Busy a Critics’ Choice Award nomination.\n\nYou may have also seen her in the films White Chicks, He’s Just Not That Into You or I Feel Pretty, her short-lived talk show Busy Tonight or, more recently, the musical sitcom Girls5eva.\n\nJenna Fischer as Mrs Heron\n\nYou may remember Jenna from her roles in comedies like Hall Pass, Blades Of Glory or Walk Hard… but let’s be honest, it’s more likely you’ve seen her in The Office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenna played Pam Beesly in all nine seasons of the much-loved US sitcom, and currently hosts the sitcom Office Ladies with her co-star Angela Kinsey, in which they share their memories of making each episode.\n\nJon Hamm as Coach Carr\n\nJon Hamm won an Emmy, two Golden Globes and a Critics’ Choice Awards for his leading performance as Don Draper in the TV show Mad Men.\n\nSince then, you may have seen him in The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Bridesmaids, Top Gun: Maverick or the most recent season of The Morning Show, in which he played a media mogul, who has some parallels with current X owner Elon Musk.\n\nAshley Park as Madame Park\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Mean Girls movie marks a full-circle moment for Ashley Parks, as she previously originated the role of Gretchen Wieners on Broadway, earning her a Tony nomination.\n\nHer on-screen work includes the film Joy Ride, the murder-mystery comedy Only Murders In The Building and the award-winning Netflix miniseries Beef.\n\nTina Fey as Miss Norbury\n\nAs well as playing Miss Norbury in both versions of Mean Girls, Tina also wrote the films – as well as the Broadway musical.\n\nAs well as being a former Saturday Night Live cast member, Tina is probably best known for her leading role as Liz Lemon in 30 Rock, though she’s also appeared in the films Muppets Most Wanted, Wine Country, Soul and A Haunting In Venice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou may have spotted her in Only Murders In The Building or Girls 5eva (which she executive produced and also made a cameo in as Dolly Parton).\n\nTim Meadows as Principal Duvall\n\nLike Tina, Tim Meadows is one of the only actors from the original Mean Girls film to reprise his role in the new musical version (he also played Principal Duvall in the oft-forgotten sequel Mean Girls 2, but the less said about that, the better).\n\nOutside of Mean Girls, he was a long-running cast member on SNL, played a recurring role in the TV sitcom The Goldbergs and acted in films like Walk Hard, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, Trainwreck and Dream Scenario.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLindsay Lohan as Mathletics moderator\n\nAfter a series of Disney roles, it was Mean Girls that put Lindsay on the map, followed by appearances in films like Bobby, Georgia Rule and The Holiday, which saw her making a small cameo as herself.\n\nLindsay was a dominant tabloid presence in the late 2000s, and her personal struggles are well-documented.\n\nIn recent years, though, she’s begun an acting comeback, which began with the Netflix rom-com Falling For Christmas in 2022. It was later revealed she’d signed a three-film deal with the streaming giant, with another of her projects due later this year.\n\nAdvertisement"
