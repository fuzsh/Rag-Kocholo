        "text": "Rachel McAdams is at it again! Rachel McAdams is starring in yet another romantic film that will be playing everywhere in the US on this Friday, Nov. 8. This movie is called “About Time” and is a love story between Tim and Mary, who is played by McAdams. I have to say, like the rest of McAdam’s romantic films, it looks absolutely adorable. This isn’t a normal love story because, as usual, McAdams can’t just fall in love easily. Tim, Mary’s love interest in the movie travels through time and uses his ability to do so to manipulate situations concerning love in his favor. I do not want to give away any more of the plot because I do not want to ruin the movie for myself or you guys, but I’m sure that Tim and Mary are going to take us on an adventure.\n\nRachel McAdams has a special talent for romantic films, and that is why she touches everyone’s heart in the roles that she plays. In every romantic movie that she stars in she makes the audience fall in love with her character. She is one of my favorite actresses and I don’t believe romantic films would be the same without her. Every character that she plays in movies I get personally involved in and I think that quality is what has led her to fame. Rachel McAdams has a long successful history with romantic films and I hope that she keeps them coming.\n\nI know that the first time I saw Rachel McAdams was in her starring role in the infamous comedy “Mean Girls” that came out in 2004. Although this movie wasn’t exactly the great romance of the century, almost 10 years later it is still extremely famous and known by almost everyone. There is even a “Mean Girls Appreciation Day.” I know that every time I watch it with my friends I laugh like it just came out. “Mean Girls” is one of those movies that everyone can relate to because it is about high school cliques and trying to fit in. Rachel McAdams plays Regina George who is a “mean girl” and the most popular girl in school. According to USA Today, McAdams had “comic flair” which they found outstanding. Although “Mean Girls” doesn’t have a beautiful or tragic love story, I think that it put McAdams on the track to stardom.\n\nHer next film goes to show that Mean Girls launched her career into something spectacular. McAdam’s next film has touched the hearts of millions of teenage girls, and once again almost 10 years later is still extremely famous and loved by its fans. “The Notebook” might just go down in history as one of the greatest love stories of all time. I mean who doesn’t love Allie and Noah and their tumultuous love story? The Notebook made millions of viewers grab a box of tissues and bawl their eyes out (or maybe that was just me…) Watching the movie over and over again with different people has shown me that even guys get sucked into the epic romance. In every scene of the movie, the viewers are captured by the pair and the obvious attraction they have for each other. The Chicago Tribune declared her “a real discovery” who “infuses young Allie with that radiant, breathlessly winning ingÃ©nue grace and charm that breaks hearts.” They couldn’t have gotten that statement any more accurately. The scene where McAdams’s character finally passes away is the most heartbreaking scene in the entire movie. Everyone has such an emotional connection with Allie, so it is sad to see her pass away. “The Notebook” just might be what Rachel McAdams is remembered for when she herself is old and grey.\n\nOne of McAdam’s more recent tragic love stories is her film with Channing Tatum which came out in 2012. It is called “The Vow.” In this love story, McAdams plays Paige and Channing Tatum stars as her husband. Sounds like the dream role, right? Well it all goes downhill pretty much right away because McAdams and her co-star husband are in a car accident that leaves Paige with no memory. Paige does not know that Leo (her husband) is her husband. This is the ultimate tragedy, not remembering that someone who looks like Channing Tatum has been married to you for years. Although it takes the entire movie, and even in the final seconds the audience isn’t totally sure Leo and Paige will be reunited, the last scene leaves us with hope that they will rekindle their relationship.\n\nRachel McAdams has had a very successful career starring in all sorts of romance movies, and it is clear that she has a special talent for them. From “The Notebook” to “About Time,” McAdams has been touching our hearts for over a decade and I believe that she will continue to do so.\n\nKeeley Gould is a second-year student majoring in English and minoring in journalism.
