        "text": "A trailer and first-look photos have been released for Rachel McAdams' new film, Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.\n\nBased on Judy Blume's 1970 novel of the same name, the comedy-drama follows 11-year-old Margaret (Fortson) as she's uprooted from her life in New York City and moves to the suburbs of New Jersey, all while going through the tumultuous throes of adolescence.\n\nDoctor Strange star McAdams plays Margaret's mother Barbara, who is also adapting to life outside of the big city, while Kathy Bates takes on the role of Margaret's adoring grandmother Sylvia.\n\nThe trailer teases the emotional journey that all three generations of the family go on.\n\nThe stills also provide fans with a first look at Good Time and Uncut Gems filmmaker Benny Safdie, who stars as Margaret's father Simon.\n\nPreviously speaking about her role in the film, McAdams told The Hollywood Reporter: 'She's [Barbara] got a more supporting part in the book, and it's a little bit more developed in the script.\n\n'I felt like Kelly [Fremon Craig, the director] drew a mother that was on a parallel journey with her daughter and trying to be a mum, but also be a person.'\n\nThe actor continued: '[She] is a very supportive mother but also wants to give her child a sense of independence and autonomy and let her go through the wonders of life herself and not cloud those too much with her own ideas of how you should and should not be.'\n\nAre You There God? It's Me, Margaret premieres in cinemas on April 28.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
