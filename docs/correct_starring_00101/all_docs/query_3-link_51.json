        "text": "Rachel McAdams doesn’t even go here.\n\nThe actress, who played Regina George in the film “Mean Girls,” was noticeably absent from a new Walmart commercial, which featured several of her co-stars from the 2004 teen comedy.\n\nHowever, there’s no bad blood between McAdams and her castmates Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert, who all appeared in the Black Friday ad, we’re told.\n\n“Rachel McAdams didn’t want to do it,” an insider told Page Six after the commercial dropped Wednesday.\n\n“They were all offered it. But the three of them loved being together for their reunion.”\n\nThe source added, “They had a great time talking about being moms, and it was definitely a loss not having Rachel there.”\n\nLohan, 37, welcomed son Luai with husband Bader Shammas in July, while Seyfried, also 37, shares Nina, 6, and Thomas, 3, with husband Thomas Sadoski. Chabert, 41, is a mom to daughter Julia, 7, with husband David Nehdar.\n\nThe TV spot, which also stars Daniel Franzese and Rajiv Surendra, comes nine years after the iconic teen flick hit cinemas.\n\n“Some things never change. On Wednesdays we wear pink, but now we shop Walmart Black Friday deals,” Lohan is heard saying in a voiceover, spoofing the film’s original dialogue.\n\nThe ad also revisits some of the movie’s most iconic scenes, including the girls’ “Jingle Bell Rock” performance — where they wore sexy Santa costumes — and Seyfried’s character Karen Smith’s air-headed weather report.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThis isn’t the first time McAdams, 44, has shied away from the spotlight.\n\nThe “Notebook” actress once took a two-year hiatus from acting so she wouldn’t lose her sanity.\n\n“I felt guilty for not capitalizing on the opportunity that I was being given because I knew I was in such a lucky spot,” the actress told Bustle in April of her decision to take a break from the industry at the height of her career.\n\n“But I also knew it wasn’t quite jiving with my personality and what I needed to stay sane.”\n\nMcAdams also revealed in the interview that she passed up major roles such as “The Devil Wears Prada,” “Casino Royale,” “Mission: Impossible III,” “Iron Man” and “Get Smart” while on her break from Hollywood.\n\n“You don’t go to theater school to learn about how to deal with [fame]. There’s no book on how to navigate that,” she explained.\n\n“There were definitely some anxious moments of wondering if I was just throwing it all away, and why was I doing that?” she confessed.\n\n“It’s taken years to understand what I intuitively was doing.”"
