        "text": "Rachel McAdams has claimed that she would love to return to the role of Regina George from the hit 2004 film Mean Girls.\n\nAppearing on Canada’s Heroes of Health: Covid-19 Stream-a-thon, the actor said: “It would be fun to play Regina George later in her life and see where life took her.”\n\nAnd McAdams isn’t the only one: co-star Lindsay Lohan has also recently expressed an interest in doing a follow-up to the beloved teen comedy.\n\n“I kind of wanted to come back with like a Mean Girls 2,” said Lohan on Lights Out with David Spade. “With the same cast, and work with Tina and the whole crew again and [director] Mark Waters.’\n\n“That was really what I wanted, I was really excited to do that... That’s all in their hands really. That would definitely be an exciting thing.”\n\nAlthough there has technically already been a sequel to Mean Girls - the TV movie Mean Girls 2, which came out in 2011 and did not feature the original stars – fans of the original have long been desperate for a full cinematic continuation of the story."
