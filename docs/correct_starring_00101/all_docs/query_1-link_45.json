        "text": "That’s so not fetch!\n\nActresses Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert all agreed to return for the new “Mean Girls” movie — but talks have stalled over Paramount’s “disrespectful” money offer, Page Six is told.\n\nThe stars of the original 2004 classic have remained friends throughout the years and were willing to return for the new film, which is bringing the Broadway musical version of “Mean Girls” to streamer Paramount +.\n\n“Paramount Pictures doesn’t want to pay the girls what they are worth,” said a highly placed production source. “All four girls were willing to come back, but Paramount has not been respectful of what they are worth.”\n\nWe’re told that McAdams, 44, who played queen bee Regina George, was initially offered a larger part to play than the other three, but the deal has not been signed off.\n\n“As of now, the negotiations are stalled.” said the source.\n\nTina Fey, who wrote both the movie and musical, is reprising her role as math teacher Ms. Norbury. She reportedly has a seven-figure deal for her acting role — she’s also writing and producing the movie — while Lohan & Co. were said to be offered a “fraction” of that.\n\nPage Six has reached out to Paramount Pictures, as well as reps Lohan, Seyfried, Chabert and McAdams, for comment. A rep for Fey declined to comment.\n\nLohan, 36, has recently made a return to Hollywood, with the top-rated Netflix holiday movie, “Falling For Christmas”, while Seyfried recently scooped a Golden Globe and an Emmy for her role as disgraced tech CEO Elizabeth Holmes in the Hulu miniseries “The Dropout.” She’s also up for a SAG award this weekend for the role.\n\nChabert, meanwhile, has been dubbed the Queen of Hallmark for her frequent movie roles on the channel, and McAdams has appeared in a string of box office hits and, most recently, in “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” alongside Benedict Cumberbatch.\n\nThe foursome would not play their original characters, nor is it known what parts they would play, but another Hollywood insider said: “Whether they appear in a cameo appearance or they have six pages of script, it doesn’t matter — [the money offered] is disrespectful.”\n\nLast week, Fey, 52, told Seth Meyers that both she and Tim Meadows, who played Principal Duvall in the original movie, were returning.\n\n“I do want to give you credit, you and Tim had parts in the original film that you couldn’t age out of,” Meyers said on Thursday night’s show.\n\n“Teachers work forever,” Fey joked.\n\nReneé Rapp from HBO Max show “The Sex Lives of College Girls” is cast as Regina George on screen after already playing the preening blonde on Broadway, while Angourie Rice takes over from Lohan as Cady Heron. The role of Janis Ian, Cady’s best friend, will be played by Auliʻi Cravalho of “Moana” fame, while Jaquel Spivey will play Damien. Chris Briney, from the Amazon Prime hit “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” co-stars as Cady’s boyfriend, Aaron Samuels.\n\nFey told Meyers that production will begin on March 6."
