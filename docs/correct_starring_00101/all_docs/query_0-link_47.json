        "text": "Despite being absent from last fall's Walmart ad, a source tells PEOPLE that McAdams \"would be interested in talking about a sequel\" to 'Mean Girls'\n\nAre Cady and Regina revisiting their Plastics roots?\n\nA source tells PEOPLE that both Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams — who played Cady Heron and Regina George, respectively, in the original Mean Girls — would be open to making a sequel to the 2004 teen comedy, which was written by Tina Fey and directed by Mark Waters.\n\nThe film source says Lohan, 37, “wants to do another [Mean Girls] and has a good relationship with her former cast members,” which also include Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert. “They are her friends and have been. Another film would be great for her and for audiences who loved the original.\"\n\nAs for McAdams, 45, the source tells PEOPLE the recent Tony nominee \"would likely do a Mean Girls sequel if everything presented to her made sense,\" despite her not participating in the reunion with Lohan, Seyfried, 38, and Chabert, 41, for a Walmart ad last fall.\n\n“She has no regrets about not doing a Walmart commercial, which is a different thing,\" the souce adds of McAdams. \"She is super busy, but likes her former cast members and would be interested in talking about a sequel if it becomes a reality.”\n\nReps for Lohan and McAdams did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's requests for comment.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.\n\nRelated: Inside Lindsay Lohan's Life as a Mom, Wife and Netflix Star 20 Years After Mean Girls\n\nMuch of the original Mean Girls cast has opened up about a potential sequel over the years. In December 2022, Lohan and Seyfried reunited during a chat for Interview magazine, in which they discussed the prospects of another movie.\n\n\"A Mean Girls 2 is never going to happen, is it?\" said Seyfried, adding later, \"Listen, we're all part of each other's worlds whether we like it or not, and it is really nice to be in contact as adults.\"\n\n\"Yeah, everyone's still the same,\" Lohan agreed. \"It's fun to have certain memories that we can't share with anyone else.\"\n\nMcAdams starred as queen bee Regina, with Seyfried and Chabert as the Plastics, the group of popular girls in school who are eventually infiltrated and taken down by Lohan’s new kid Cady — but not before she loses herself in the fast pace of high-school politics.\n\n“It would be fun to play Regina George later in her life and see where life took her!” McAdams replied after she was asked about a sequel to Mean Girls during a Heroes of Health: COVID-19 livestream back in April 2020, according to Yahoo Entertainment.\n\nRelated: Rachel McAdams 'Wanted' to Participate in New Mean Girls Film but 'It Was Tough': 'Cannot Wait to See It'\n\nLohan previously revisited the Mean Girls universe as Cady in a buzzy Walmart commercial last November, alongside the original film’s fellow cast members Seyfried, Chabert, Rajiv Surendra and Daniel Franzese.\n\nMean Girls has amassed a huge following since its premiere two decades ago, though has never had an official theatrical sequel (a 2011 follow-up premiered on ABC Family with an entirely new cast save for Tim Meadows, who reprised his role as Principal Duvall).\n\nAsked at the New York City premiere of the Mean Girls movie musical — in which Lohan makes a surprise cameo as the Mathletes competition moderator — about a possible Mean Girls 2, Franzese, 45, told PEOPLE that the original cast “are all down” to do more.\n\n“You got to tell the boss lady over there,” he said during the January event, referring to Fey, 53. “I'm sure [she's] heard it a million times, but she's the gatekeeper, so we're all waiting.”\n\nMean Girls (2004) is available to stream on Paramount+ and Apple TV+.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
