        "text": "This work deals with the didactical use of geometrical-mechanical artefacts to acquire tangent concept in vygotskian perspective. We adopt Rabardel’s theory on instrumental approach to distinguish artefacts and instruments specially to evince the history-to-education ontogenesis-phylogenesis process. From this point of view we trace a historical-epistemological pathway for the tangent up to set an ad hoc didactical counterpart. Specifically in this paper we deepen the kinematical properties of the tangent (introducing the XVII century so called tractional motion) designing a laboratorial didactic pathway for 12th grade students with the use of a particular geometrical-mechanical artefact for mediating tangent meaning: the Tangentograph. The paper could be an interesting contribution on the study of the problems related to the tangent meaning and its properties. It can be a first step to the definition of an educational pathway related to the same mathematical content by the use of the tractional instruments that concretely manage it and thus could help the student to explore the tangent meaning.\n\nIn La Géométrie, Descartes proposed a “balance” between geometric constructions and symbolic manipulation with the introduction of suitable ideal machines. In particular, Cartesian tools were polynomial algebra (analysis) and a class of diagrammatic constructions (synthesis). This setting provided a classification of curves, according to which only the algebraic ones were considered “purely geometrical.” This limit was overcome with a general method by Newton and Leibniz introducing the infinity in the analytical part, whereas the synthetic perspective gradually lost importance with respect to the analytical one — geometry became a mean of visualization, no longer of construction. Descartes’s foundational approach (analysis without infinitary objects and synthesis with diagrammatic constructions) has, however, been extended beyond algebraic limits, albeit in two different periods. In the late 17th century, the synthetic aspect was extended by “tractional motion” (construction of transcendental curves with idealized machines). In the first half of the 20th century, the analytical part was extended by “differential algebra,” now a branch of computer algebra. This thesis seeks to prove that it is possible to obtain a new balance between these synthetic and analytical extensions of Cartesian tools for a class of transcendental problems. In other words, there is a possibility of a new convergence of machines, algebra, and geometry that gives scope for a foundation of (a part of) infinitesimal calculus without the conceptual need of infinity. The peculiarity of this work lies in the attention to the constructive role of geometry as idealization of machines for foundational purposes. This approach, after the “de-geometrization” of mathematics, is far removed from the mainstream discussions of mathematics, especially regarding foundations. However, though forgotten these days, the problem of defining appropriate canons of construction was very important in the early modern era, and had a lot of influence on the definition of mathematical objects and methods. According to the definition of Bos [2001], these are “exactness problems” for geometry. Such problems about exactness involve philosophical and psychological interpretations, which is why they are usually considered external to mathematics. However, even though lacking any final answer, I propose in conclusion a very primitive algorithmic approach to such problems, which I hope to explore further in future research. From a cognitive perspective, this approach to calculus does not require infinity and, thanks to idealized machines, can be set with suitable “grounding metaphors” (according to the terminology of Lakoff and Nuñez [2000]). This concreteness can have useful fallouts for math education, thanks to the use of both physical and digital artifacts (this part will be treated only marginally).\n\nKlerić uses a new instrument, called tractoriograph, for the construction of \"impossible\" mathematical problems. The major part of these constructions is based on the “circular tractrix”, that is the tractrix of a circle traced with the condition that the length or the tractoriograph is equal to the radius of the circle. A spectacular property of this curve is that, if it is joined to a ruler and a compass, it allows the rectification of any arc of the circle. From that, it is easy to construct the number π, to rectify and to square the circle, and to inscribe in it a regular polygon with any number of sides. Incidentally, by using the tractrix of a straight line, Klerić proves that the number e is also constructible with his tractoriograph."
