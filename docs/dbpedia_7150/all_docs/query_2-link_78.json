        "text": "In 1748 was published in Milan the Instituzioni analitiche, a textbook on calculus that brought Maria Gaetana Agnesi (1718–1799) fame and prestige throughout Europe. By this time she had affirmed her identity as a woman and a scholar – one of the most important personality in mathematics during the Enlightenment Italy – and had settled on her religious vocation. This research using printed texts and letters, but also manuscripts and documents from the Fondo Agnesi conserved in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan and other collections. In the Age of Enlightenment Maria Gaetana Agnesi strove to find an alternative to the essentially matrimonial and maternal image of women and sought to construct for herself an identity of intellectual autonomy in the spiritual sphere. Through philosophical research and scientific enquiry, Agnesi champions a new and revolutionary approach: the right to take responsibility for one’s own time, as against the idea that a woman was strictly functional to the interests and aims of others.\n\nAn n o I V, n n. 1-2 , 2 0 1 7 P h i l o s o p h y a n d Ma t h e ma t i c s a t t h e T u r n o f t h e 1 8 t h Ce n t u r y : Ne w P e r s p e c t i v e s P h i l o s o p h i e e t ma t h é ma t i q u e s a u t o u r n a n t d u X VI I I P h i l o s o p h i e e t ma t h é ma t i q u e s a u t o u r n a n t d u X VI I I e s i è c l e : p e r s p e c t i v e s n o u v e l l e s A c u r a d i Ma r c o S t o r n i e An d r e a S t r a z z o n i I S S N 2 2 8 4-1 1 8 0 DIRETTORE Stefano Caroti (Università degli Studi di Parma) EDITOR\n\nIn this paper, I analyse the works of Maria Gaetana Agnesi, an Italian mathematician of the eighteenth century. I specifically focus on the themes of proto-feminism, equality, and educational rights as persistent threads of her philosophical and scientific production. I emphasise her continuous efforts to highlight the place of women in the history of philosophy, presenting three chief texts in which these efforts are expressed. In her first work, the Academic oration, in which it is demonstrated that the studies of the liberal arts by the female sex are by no means inappropriate, I show how she articulates a rhetoric defence of women's educational rights. In her second work, the Philosophical Propositions, I highlight how she combines Cartesian metaphysics and philosophy of mind to justify women's belonging to the history of philosophy. In analysing her final masterpiece, the Analytical Institutions, I interpret the dedication to the Austrian empress Maria Theresa as a proto-feminist text, vindicating the leading role of women in history and society."
