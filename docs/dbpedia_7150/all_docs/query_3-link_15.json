        "text": "1 January A CALENDAR OF MATHEMATICAL DATES V. Frederick Rickey Department <strong>of</strong> Mathematical Sciences United States Military Academy <strong>West</strong> <strong>Point</strong>, NY 10996-1786 USA Email: fred-rickey @ usma.edu JANUARY 4713 B.C. This is Julian day 1 and begins at noon Greenwich or Universal Time (U.T.). It provides a convenient way to keep track <strong>of</strong> the number <strong>of</strong> days between events. Noon, January 1, 1984, begins Julian Day 2,445,336. For the use <strong>of</strong> the Chinese remainder theorem in determining this date, see American Journal <strong>of</strong> Physics, 49(1981), 658–661. 46 B.C. The first day <strong>of</strong> the first year <strong>of</strong> the Julian <strong>calendar</strong>. It remained in effect until October 4, 1582. The previous year, “the last year <strong>of</strong> confusion,” was the longest year on record—it contained 445 days. [Encyclopedia Brittanica, 13th edition, vol. 4, p. 990] 1618 La Salle’s expedition reached the present site <strong>of</strong> Peoria, Illinois, birthplace <strong>of</strong> the author <strong>of</strong> this <strong>calendar</strong>. 1800 Cauchy’s father was elected Secretary <strong>of</strong> the Senate in France. The young Cauchy used a corner <strong>of</strong> his father’s <strong>of</strong>fice in Luxembourg Palace for his own desk. LaGrange and Laplace frequently stopped in on business and so took an interest in the boys <strong>mathematical</strong> talent. One day, in the presence <strong>of</strong> numerous dignitaries, Lagrange pointed to the young Cauchy and said “You see that little young man? Well! He will supplant all <strong>of</strong> us in so far as we are mathematicians.” [E. T. Bell, Men <strong>of</strong> Mathematics, p. 274] 1801 Giuseppe Piazzi (1746–1826) discovered the first asteroid, Ceres, but lost it in the sun 41 days later, after only a few observations. Using his new technique <strong>of</strong> least squares, Gauss correctly predicted where it could be found. This made Gauss a celebrity. [DSB 5, 300 and 10, 591–592; Buhler, Gauss, pp. 40–45] 1806 France adopts the Gregorian <strong>calendar</strong> for the second time. See October 5, 1793. 192? G. H. Hardy sent the following New Year’s wishes on a postcard to a friend: (1) Prove the Riemann hypothesis. (2) make 211 not out in the fourth innings <strong>of</strong> the last test match at the Oval. (3) find an argument for the nonexistence <strong>of</strong> God which shall convince the general public. (4) be the first man to the top <strong>of</strong> Mt. Everst. (5) be proclaimed the first president <strong>of</strong> the U.S.S.R. <strong>of</strong> Great Britain and Germany. (6) murder Mussolini. [DSB 6, 114] 1938 Hungary issued a stamp portraying Pope Sylvester II, Archbishop <strong>of</strong> Astrik. [Scott #511] 1962 The standard meter is redefined as “the length <strong>of</strong> 1,656,763.83 wave lengths <strong>of</strong> a certain type <strong>of</strong> orange colored radiation given <strong>of</strong>f in a vacuum by the atom <strong>of</strong> krypton 86.” [Martin Gardner, Relativity for the Million (1962), p 5]. 1999 How would you write the Roman numeral for the antepenultimate year <strong>of</strong> the twentieth century? Should we write it purely additively as MDCCCCLXXXXVIIII or should we use the subtractive principle and write MXMXCIX. Or do you prefer the mimimal solution MIM? This question stumped Marilyn vos Savant, who is listed in the Guinness Book <strong>of</strong> World Records under “Highest IQ.” [Prade Magazine, 5 November 1989, p. 2] 2001 The first day <strong>of</strong> the 21st century. This is the answer to a good trivia question; 2000 is the last year <strong>of</strong> the 20th century and is a leap year. c○ Copyright V.
