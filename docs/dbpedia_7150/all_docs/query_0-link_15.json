To these ends, each volume will have its own theme and title and will be planned by one or more members of the Advisory Board in consultation with the editor. Although the volumes have specific themes, the series itself will not be limited to one or even to a few particular areas. Its subjects include any of the sciences, ranging from biology through physics, all aspects of technology, broadly construed, as well as historically-engaged philosophy of science or technology.

The conference was part of the “Five Centuries of the Life of the University of Valencia” (Cinc Segles) celebrations, and from the outset we had the generous support of the “Patronato” (Foundation) overseeing the events. In recent decades, as a result of a renewed attention to the institutional, political, social, and cultural context of scientiﬁc activity, we have witnessed a reappraisal of the role of the universities in the construction and development of early modern science. In essence, the following conclusions have been reached: (1) the attitudes regarding scientiﬁc progress or novelty differed from country to country and follow different trajectories in the course of the early modern period; (2) institutions of higher learning were the main centers of education for most scientists; (3) although the universities were sometimes slow to assimilate new scientiﬁc knowledge, when they did so it helped not only to remove the suspicion that the new science was intellectually subversive but also to make science a respectable and even prestigious activity; (4) the universities gave the scientiﬁc movement considerable material support in the form of research facilities such as anatomical theaters, botanical gardens, and expensive instruments; (5) the universities provided professional employment and a means of support to many scientists; and (6) although the relations among the universities and the academies or scientiﬁc societies were sometimes antagonistic, the two types of institutions often worked together in harmony, performing complementary rather than competing functions; moreover, individuals moved from one institution to another, as did knowledge, methods, and scientiﬁc practices. The objectives of the conference were: (1) to examine and assess the current state of the problem; (2) to provide new data, methods, and perspectives on it; and (3) to compare historical approaches carried out in various countries—especially in the Iberian world, an area that is rarely considered in studies of the subject. The articles presented here cover the entire early modern period, from the 15th to the 18th centuries. The majority of the papers concentrate on one of the three great periods that historians of science generally recognize—the Renaissance, the Scientiﬁc Revolution, and the Age of Enlightenment—although two studies, both devoted to Italy, cover all three periods. At the same time, the study of the university as an institution permits the examination of elements contributing to the question of continuity and change in early modern science.\n\n1 M.

Printed in the Netherlands.\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe contributions are distinguished by their geo-cultural and geo-political diversity; however, those relating to the Iberian world (Spain, Portugal, and the Viceroyalty of New Granada in colonial America) clearly predominate. Other countries represented in the volume include Italy, Switzerland, Poland, England, and France. Papers dedicated to Holland and Mexico were presented at the conference but are not included in the volume. Concerning the themes studied in the essays, one group takes up activities connected with the scientiﬁc disciplines taken as a whole, including teaching and research, while another group examines particular disciplines such as mathematics and its applications, natural philosophy, botany, medicine, and astronomy. The importance of the Renaissance universities, particularly in areas such as Italy and Germany, is a well-established fact. The articles dealing with this period included here also conﬁrm the importance of the universities within an area less well known, Iberia, and bring new precision and information relating to the Italian and Polish universities. The study by Jos´e Chab´as emphasizes the importance of the University of Salamanca as a principal center of astronomical activity in the Iberian peninsula in the 15th century. Chab´as also underscores the collaboration between Jews and Christians and the contacts between the academic and non-academic worlds, a subject exempliﬁed in the life and work of the outstanding Salamancan astronomer Abraham Zacuto. The late Luis Garc´ıa Ballester, utilizing recently discovered manuscript documentation as well as printed sources, was able to reconstruct the teaching of medicine at Salamanca during this period. His contribution emphasizes that at Salamanca there existed a movement that approached Galenism in a manner similar to prominent European faculties of medicine such as Paris, Montpellier, and various Italian centers. More famous than Salamanca was the University of Cracow, which in the second half of the 15th century arose as “an international center for the study of astronomy”, in the words of Birkenmaier. Examining the teaching activities and the diffusion of the works of Martinus Rex and Giuseppe Bianchini, Grazina Rosinska contributes new information about the renovation of the teaching of mathematics applied to astronomy at Krakow and elsewhere. Since Bianchini (who was the ﬁrst western mathematician to use purely decimal tables of trigonometric functions) was not a university professor, by studying the diffusion of his writings, Rosinska is able to provide a notable example of the reciprocal inﬂuence among the university and extrauniversity sites. Returning to the Iberian world, thirty new university centers were created in the 16th century, some of which, such as Valencia and Alcal´a, rivaled Salamanca. Valencia’s faculty of medicine became the most important in 16th-century Spain. Jos´e Maria L´opez Pi˜nero shows that Valencia’s faculty incorporated the principal novelties in the teaching of medicine that were introduced into Europe: the study of anatomy according to the methods introduced by Vesalius, the teaching of botany applied to medicine with an associated botanical garden, and the teaching of surgery. Moreover, the clinical observations and environmentalist-oriented public health studies were put\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\ninto the foreground, while a chair of ‘secret remedies’ with a Paracelsian orientation was created, although it lasted for only one academic term. In the same period, the universities of Valencia and Alcal´a introduced chairs of mathematics, as Salamanca had already done in the 15th century, thereby considerably expanding the repertory of subjects. At the same time, the content of teaching was reformed and renewed, on the one hand by the introduction of lessons on the practical applications of mathematics to geography, cartography, topography, nautical science, and artillery, and on the other hand by the introduction of new mathematical techniques and discussions of cosmological questions (including those relating to the heliocentric theory, to the nature of the nova of 1572 and to comets). All of these are evident in the activities of the outstanding mathematician and humanist Jer´onimo Mu˜noz and his disciples, who are the subjects of V´ıctor Navarro’s article. Cosmography and navigation had great importance in the Iberian world. The teaching of mathematics oriented to these subjects is the main characteristic of the Portuguese case, here studied by Henrique Leitao and Luis Miguel Carolino. These authors emphasize the role of Jesuit teaching in the “Aula de Esfera” (Chamber of the Sphere) of the College of San Antonio in Lisbon, which was oriented to the training of cosmographers and navigators, whose professor proceeded from the Collegio Romano and other European centers. The practical orientation of mathematics created a divorce of mathematics from natural philosophy. Nevertheless, the teaching of philosophy was far from closed to new scientiﬁc ideas. Its professors attempted to integrate non-Aristotelian ideas, such as those of Tycho concerning the celestial localization of comets, into the Aristotelian framework. The attempt to assimilate astronomical and cosmological novelties into traditional systems is well represented in the work of Jacques de Chevreul, a University of Paris professor between the 1620s and the 1640s. Roger Ariew analyzes de Chevreul’s treatise on the sphere and shows how he used the new astronomical observations of Galileo and other authors. Nevertheless, in the most controversial astronomical– cosmological issues, such as the incorruptibility of the heavens and the question of the lunar surface, de Chevruel resorted to a probabilistic language in order to avoid publicly favoring any particular interpretation. In countries such as Switzerland, the university was the main center of scientiﬁc activity in the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries. Founded in 1477 and encouraged by successive monarchs, by 1620 the University of Uppsala became a major seat of learning. The teaching of the mathematical disciplines was advanced by virtue of its practical applications and by the necessities of civic life. Maija Kallinen describes the activities of the most relevant ﬁgure of the period, the physician Olof Rudbeck, a true polymath, who counted among his various activities the teaching of mixed mathematics. Kallinen emphasizes that Rudbeck’s semi-private lessons are striking examples of how semi-ofﬁcial activities could, within limitations, signiﬁcantly complement more ofﬁcial forms of instruction. In Italy as well, where some of the ﬁrst European universities were created, scientiﬁc activity in the early modern period was strongly linked to this institution. As Luigi Pepe and Maria Teresa Borgato demonstrate, this would explain both the successes of science in Italy and its limitations. The\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nworks of these two authors cover the entire period for the Italian case. Pepe discusses the weaknesses of the Italian academies, their complementary character in relation to the universities and the interactions and conﬂicts among them during this period. He dedicates one part of his paper to the Napoleonic reforms, which inaugurated a new epoch for the Italian universities as a consequence of the intense geopolitical changes that took place on the Italian peninsula. Borgato, focusing on mathematics, studies the links between mathematical research and the university, pointing out how in the 18th century the revival of mathematical research in Italy took place essentially within the university environment. The impact of the Scientiﬁc Revolution and the profound social transformations of the period had repercussions in the European universities. Indeed, the last decades of the 17th century and the ﬁrst decades of the 18th century might be classiﬁed as a period of crisis and reform in the university: Crisis as the traditional university confronted new philosophical and scientiﬁc currents, and reform as it adapted to the new currents. This process occurred in a paradigmatic manner in countries such as Spain, which had scarcely participated in the philosophical and scientiﬁc changes of the 17th century. As Jos´e Luis Peset points out, in the second half of the 18th century, a series of reforms took place in Spain with the support of the monarchy. New texts were introduced (in large part editions and translations of foreign works) and, in accordance with the ideas of the epoch, the teaching of science was oriented toward practical applications. A large number laboratories, cabinets for experimental demonstration, botanical gardens, natural history collections, and astronomical observatories were either created or expanded in the peninsular universities. In the case of the University of Valencia, the various curricula culminated in the so-called Blasco Plan, which created chairs of chemistry and botany. The study of various reports and plans relative to the teaching of botany has enabled Cristina Sendra to analyze the position of particular professors in relation to these educational reforms. The professors who are the subjects of Sendra’s article debated whether or not botany might be taught in the university courses on medicine as well as what should be considered to be the science of botany. The ideas oulined by the authors of these reports included the recognition of botany as a discipline with its own methods and patterns of work, separate from the medical profession. While it is clear that the Bourbons patronized the university reforms in Spain, Agust´ın Nieto and Antonio Roca demonstrate that Catalu˜na was a special case in point. As a consequence of the War of Spanish Succession, the new dynasty that came to power in Spain suppressed all of the Catalonian universities and created a new one at Cervera. In this university, certain Jesuit professors attempted to introduce elements of the new physics in the philosophy chairs. At the same time, the absence of a university was replaced by the emergence of alternative institutions, principally in Barcelona, such as the Academia Militar de Matem´aticas, the Real Colegio de Cirug´ıa, the Academia M´edico-Pr´actica, the Real Academia de Ciencias Naturales y Artes, and the Colegio de Cordelles. In addition, the technical schools of the Junta de Comercio were established to educate craftsmen and early industrial workers.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nThe Barcelona Junta created a workable system of higher education that lasted for decades. The Barcelona network of schools had explicit utilitarian objectives and most of their syllabuses were based on contemporary European scientiﬁc and technological developments. The university reforms sponsored by the Spanish Bourbons were also extended to the universities of the Viceroyalty of New Granada and to those of the Audiencia of Caracas. Luis Carlos Arboleda and Diana Soto investigate these reforms, focusing in particular on the teaching of physics and Newtonian cosmology. The Copernican and Newtonian theories began to circulate in these countries in relation to activities such as the geodesic expeditions, the establishment of borders, and the construction of fortiﬁcations. In teaching these subjects, the Jesuits typically adopted an eclectic style, considering cosmological theories as useful hypotheses. In the second half of the century, various professors introduced the systematic teaching of the new physics, although not without polemics and difﬁculties. Arboleda and Soto consider these teachings to be manifestations of the institutionalization of enlightened ideas in the university classrooms, which were not completed in the colonial era. The Creole elite attempted to assimilate the new scientiﬁc currents, integrating them into their own socio-political and cultural project. One of the most dynamic centers of Enlightenment thinking, as is well known, was Scotland. The Scottish universities participated in and contributed to Enlightenment thought in signiﬁcant ways. In his contribution to this volume, Paul Wood explores the reasons why the study of natural knowledge ﬂourished in the Scottish universities during this period. Wood’s paper focuses on issues relating to the role that the universities played in improving the ethos that fostered science, the impact of the ideal of “politeness” on the transformation of the Scottish university curricula in the 18th century, the ways in which the related notion of the “gentleman” shaped the teaching of mathematics and natural sciences, the interplay between religion and natural knowledge, the speciﬁc institutional features of the Scottish universities that affected the cultivation and transmission of natural knowledge and the signiﬁcant part played by the universities in the creation of the public sphere. One of Wood’s main conclusions is that in Scotland public culture was to a considerable extent an offshoot of academe. Piero del Negro and Ugo Baldini deal, respectively, with the universities of Padua and Rome. In his study, Del Negro revises the historiography concerning the politics guided by the Reformatiori dello Studio di Padova. Many indicators suggest that the 18th century was an age of progress for the University of Padua. If formal enrollment decreased, the number of “real” students grew. New institutions for scientiﬁc research were created, including physics laboratories, a natural history museum, an astronomical observatory, a school of obstetrics, medical, and surgical clinics in the hospital and a chair of architecture. In addition, many new courses were added. Also at Padua, as in other European universities, what characterized the Enlightenment reform was its utilitarian inspiration, the belief that scientiﬁc knowledge could be exploited for the beneﬁt of society as a whole.\n\n6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe reforms of the Enlightenment also reached the University of Rome “La Sapienza”, although the changes were not as extensive or effective as in other Italian universities. At least until the 1780s the distance between the Sapienza and the other universities increased. Ugo Baldini offers one of the ﬁrst comprehensive studies of this university’s activities in relation to science. In addition to describing the reforms, he analyzes the limited degree of their application in the teaching of different disciplines: philosophy; mathematics, medicine, physiology, anatomy, chemistry, botany and natural history. Around 1780, the practice of science in Rome approached the level that for decades had already been reached in the Universities of Padua, Pavia, Tur´ın, Bologna, and Pisa. This development did not occur in opposition to or independently of the intentions of the Papal government. Rather, it took place thanks to initiatives emanating at least partly from the Papacy. Thus it is not an exaggeration to characterize this as a period of “Papal reform” in science. The case of the Roman Sapienza is similar to the other Italian universities, whose role in the cultural history of cities like Naples, Messina, Catania, or Palermo is underestimated, evaluated too generally, or subjected to biased judgments. The study of the subject matter taught in the universities, as well as the methods and teaching instruments used, requires that special attention be given to textbooks and to the processes by which they were created. These are the themes that concern Antonio Garc´ıa Belmar and Jose Bertomeu S´anchez, who underscore the need to revise the idea that teaching was merely the transmission of knowledge. They insist that communication is one of the practices by which scientiﬁc knowledge is constructed. To illustrate this thesis, Garc´ıa Belmar and Bertomeu S´anchez examine the characteristics of chemistry textbooks elaborated in Spain and France in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, as well as the conditions of their production, evolution, and change. Their study emphasizes the creative labor of the authors of teaching manuals in spite the multiple institutional, academic, political, and economic conditions that they had to confront. In summary, a long-road lies ahead to reach an adequate and well-founded understanding of the universities in the scientiﬁc culture of the early modern era. Nevertheless, we think that this collection of studies, besides contributing new data, raises new questions and suggests new lines of investigation, conﬁrming the demand for a reevaluation of the role of the universities to which we referred at the outset. We wish to express our gratitude to the following institutions for making the conference possible: the Patronat “Cinc Segles” of the University of Valencia, the Valencian Government (Generalitat Valenciana), the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation (Agencia Espa˜nola de Cooperaci´on Internacional), the Diputaci´o de Val`encia, the Catalan Society for the History of Science and Technology and the Instituto de Historia de la Ciencia y Documentaci´on “L´opez Pi˜nero”. We also wish to thank the members of the Organizing Committee, whose work was essential in preparing the conference: Vicente L. Salavert, Jes´us I. Catal´a, Tayra Lanuza and Mavi Corell. We are also grateful to the members of the Scientiﬁc Committee: Ugo\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nBaldini, Luis Garc´ıa Ballester, Luigi Pepe, Jos´e Luis Peset, and Jos´e Mar´ıa L´opez Pi˜nero.

Those who subsequently chose to specialize in astronomy, particularly at universities such as Cracow, which had a chair in the subject from the beginning of the 15th century, were gratiﬁed with supplementary portion of mathematics included into the lectures on astronomy.1 It was the case of the lectures on the Canones tabularum or on the composition of astronomical instruments or else on various Theoricae planetarum. In addition, there existed special treatises on “mathematics for astronomy” or special commentaries on the commonly used “ordinary” textbooks on mathematics. All these types of mathematical texts devoted to the training of astronomers will be referred to in what follows. The period we are interested in is limited to some 60 years, between the early 40s of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th century. It was as early as the ﬁrst half of the 15th century that the algebra was introduced in an exposition of mathematical astronomy (the case of Bianchini’s Flores Almagesti) and arithmetic of decimal fractions was invented for use in astronomical computations. From that period come the tables of decimal trigonometric functions developed subsequently in Regiomontanus’, Copernicus’, and Rheticus’ works. Our considerations are focused, therefore, on the achievement of mathematicians whose activity began in the ﬁrst half of the 15th century: Giovanni Bianchini of Ferrara (ca. 1400–1470) and Martinus Rex ˙ of Zurawica (or of Premislia, ca. 1420–1453). While Bianchini is the author of the modern form of trigonometric tables, Martinus Rex, professor of mathematics and astronomy, ﬁrst at Cracow university and then at universities in Prague and Bologna, created scientiﬁc milieus prepared to accept Bianchini’s accomplishments. (Although Peurbach and Regiomontanus were their partial contemporaries, it should be noted that in 1440 Peurbach was 17 and Regiomontanus only 4). Bianchini, a brilliant autodidact, spent almost all his adult life in Ferrara as an administrator of the estate of the d’Este family.2 His treatises, however, written in Latin and ﬁlled with references to Euclid and Ptolemy, were intended as university textbooks in mathematics and astronomy. Bianchini’s scientiﬁc writings come from around 9 M. Feingold and V. Navarro-Brot´ons (eds.), Universities and Science in the Early Modern Period, 9–28. C 2006 Springer. Printed in the Netherlands.\n\n10\n\n´ GRAZYNA ROSINSKA\n\n1440–1460, and according to research on the 15th century astronomical manuscripts preserved in various collections, were known during his author life all over Europe.3 Martinus Rex, not as creative as Bianchini, studied at Cracow probably from 1438. His most important work, the Summa super tabulas, written in 1444, certainly inﬂuenced the teaching of mathematics at Cracow University in the second half of the 15th century.4 The aim of our study is the presentation of some arithmetical aspects of 15th century trigonometry that were relevant, as it seems, to the evolution of the concept of number that originated in the early 40s of the 15th century and continued into the 16th and 17th centuries, hand in hand with the development of early modern physics. Therefore, after presenting Martinus Rex’ and Giovanni Bianchini’s expositions of trigonometry, and the transmission of their achievement to the second half of the 15th century, this study will continue with a view of the mathematics taught at universities at the end of the century (Copernicus enrolled at Cracow university in 1491) and it will conclude with Copernicus’ trigonometric tables, preserved in the so-called Uppsala codex and in De revolutionibus. Among the “ancient problems” that were still present in 15th century expositions of “mathematics for astronomy”, we shall consider the inadequacy of the Pythagorean concept of number for the (quantitative) description of reality. In Antiquity as well as in the Middle Ages, the term number itself referred only to the whole, positive numbers and thus it did not correspond to the requirements of mathematical astronomy, among other applications, working as a rule with incommensurable quantities. I am speaking here of the concept of number as adopted in “scientiﬁc arithmetic”, based on Boethius’ De institutione arithmetica, and present in the university textbooks. In “vulgar arithmetic”, logistika, it was admitted the use of what could now be called the “na¨ıve concept of real number”, sufﬁciently large to include irrationals and numerical expressions of negative quantities, and thus adequate to perform all arithmetical operations. As it results from Bianchini’s Flores Almagesti, the 15th century “mathematics for astronomers” used overtly “real numbers” as well as methods of calculation borrowed directly from the scuole d’abbaco. Two treatises open the Flores Almagesti, the Arithmetica, and the Algebra. The Arithmetica teaches astronomers, among others, the method of “composition”, known in the mercantil arithmetic as inﬁlzamento (inﬁlzare) and then the four operations with negative numbers, together with the rule of signes; furthermore, it gives the principle of the extension of the decimal positional system of numbers to decimal positional fractions.5 The Algebra assumes the doctrines exposed in the Arithmetica. Both treatises, written in medieval Latin and accompanied with “geometrical proofs” constructed with reference to Euclid, certainly contributed to the mathematical training of 15th century astronomers, Peurbach and Regiomontanus included.6 In Cracow, Bianchini’s mathematical (trigonometric) and astronomical tables were systematically copied, rearranged, and adapted to Cracow meridian, to begin with Martinus Rex’ students and to ﬁnish with Copernicus, and with his younger colleagues in Cracow.7\n\n“MATHEMATICS FOR ASTRONOMY” AT UNIVERSITIES IN COPERNICUS’ TIME\n\n11\n\nIn the ﬁrst half of the 15th century, the formal difﬁculties with the “mathematics for astronomers” were sometimes consciously ignored or avoided—apparently—by the lecturers on astronomy. Such is the case of Martinus who believes that the difﬁculties can be circumvented thanks to a special interpretation of the relations between matter and number, and considers the trigonometric functions of tangent and cotangent (umbra recta and umbra extensa) as ratios of numbers rather than as lines—or as lines that express the ratios of numbers. As for Bianchini, he changes the concept of a trigonometric function using “numbers”, decimal positional fractions, for its expression.\n\nRENAISSANCE “MATHEMATICS FOR ASTRONOMY” Renaissance “mathematics for astronomy” has not yet been systematically studied, though valuable studies have been published aiming, for instance, at establishing Paolo Toscanelli’s and above all Regiomontanus’ contribution to mathematics.8 Generally speaking, “mathematics for astronomers” is characterized by: a. The use of fractiones physicae: sexagesimal positional fractions, which had met the needs of astronomy since Babylonian times. b. Arithmetical operations with large numbers. Special arithmetical techniques were invented to deal with large numbers. c. The developed theory of proportions applied to plane and spherical trigonometry, and approximations of incommensurables to numbers (fractions). d. Particular interest in the development of tables of sine, versed sine, and “umbrae” (tangent and cotangent). All these characteristics had been present in mathematical astronomy since Ptolemy’s times. Renaissance mathematics (for astronomy) was enriched in the course of time by developments in the Muslim East that had begun in the ninth century, and in the Latin West, particularly during the 14th century, in Paris. In the 15th century, a speciﬁc enrichment of “mathematics for astronomy” came from the scuole d’abbaco ﬂourishing in Italy. The dimensions of the achievement of the “abbacists” have become evident thanks to research conducted by historians of mathematics in the last decades of the 20th century. Practical mathematics has been studied especially by Italian scholars, including Gino Arrighi,9 Rafaella Franci, and Laura Toti-Rigatelli.10 Subsequently, Jacques Sessiano11 and Warren Van Egmond12 have revealed new dimensions of the late medieval and the early renaissance practical mathematics. Finally, efforts have been made to illustrate the impact of mathematics from the scuole d’abbaco upon the achievement of 16th century mathematicians, Bombelli included.13 In my own work on the 15th century “mathematics taught at universities to future astronomers”, I seek to present a new concept of number emerging from the treatises on mathematics composed by Giovanni Bianchini. Bianchini extended the concept of number to negative numbers and to irrationals. Then, he introduced decimal positional\n\n12\n\n´ GRAZYNA ROSINSKA\n\nfractions applying them to astronomical computations, and particularly to approximation of irrationals to numbers. Finally, he used the unit segment for the geometrical expression of arithmetical operations with irrationals.14 The concept of number, used by Bianchini’s predecessors, resulted of accumulative principle applied to its construction. Nicomachus’ of Geraza, second century, deﬁnition of number runs as follows, according to d’Ooge translation: Number is a limited multitude or a combination of units . . . and Boethius in sixth century writes following Nicomachus’ deﬁnition: Numerus est cumulatio unitatum. . . .15 The same idea persists in deﬁnitions of number present in the university textbooks used in 15th century: Numerus est multitudo ex unitatibus profusa . . . and unitas non est numerus sed principium numeri.16 In contrast with the earlier tradition, Bianchini considers the unity as a number, and not as a “principle of numbers, itself not being a number”. Moreover, the way of explaining certain arithmetical operations conﬁrms that he bases the concept of number on a multiplicative principle rather that on the cumulative one, and considers “number” as a ratio of a quantity to its unit. This idea permits him to use the inverse of number in the operation of division and perform division by means of multiplication by the inverse of the divisor: Quando integri dividuntur per fractiones, multiplicentur integri secundum proportionem unitatis ad illasmet fractiones divisoris. Quando fractiones dividuntur per integra, multiplicentur fractiones secundum proportionem unitatis ad numerum divisorem.17 All these issues, the irrationals and negative values considered as numbers, the decimal positional fractions, and the multiplicative principle underlying the concept of number, are present in Bianchini’s mathematical and astronomical writings, beginning with his Arithmetica, which I am inclined to date to about 1440, and his Compositio instrumenti, dated to 1442.18 In what follows, Martinus’ lecture on trigonometry, delivered at Cracow university in 1444 and included into his Summa super tabulas, will be presented, and then Bianchini’s Canones super tabulas sinuum and his Compositio instrumenti will be considered, together with his Arithmetica and his decimal trigonometric tables. In 1444 Martinus was probably unaware of the fact that at about the same time, in Italy, Bianchini had composed decimal trigonometric tables, ﬁrst for R = 60 × 10n , and some years later for R = 10n . There is no evidence that Martinus and Bianchini met, though they could have done so during Martinus’ professorship in Bologna in the years 1447–1449. As for the philosophical attitudes of Martinus and Bianchini toward the relation between magnitude and number, and between number and matter, underlying trigonometry as applied to astronomy, it was Martinus who posed in his lecture the problem of the correspondence (or rather of the lack of correspondence) between number and Nature; more exactly between mathematics and nature of matter. The approach to the solution of this problem would be made by Giovanni Bianchini. It should be emphasized, however, that Bianchini considers the problem of the correspondence between number and magnitude (matter) on a methodological rather than philosophical level. He is concerned with the formal correctness (or rather the lack of correctness that he\n\n“MATHEMATICS FOR ASTRONOMY” AT UNIVERSITIES IN COPERNICUS’ TIME\n\n13\n\nﬁnds in the works by his contemporaries) of the numerical expression of the ratios between two heterogeneous entities: arcs (measured in degrees) and lines in a circle.\n\nMARTINUS REX’ EXPOSITION OF TRIGONOMETRY Martinus, who was trained at Cracow University in the years 1438 (or 1440)–1445, thought of himself as a heir to a tradition of trigonometric tables going back to Ptolemy, and further developed in the 14th century by the moderns (moderni ), among whom he mentions by name only John of Lineris. Among textbooks on mathematics used in Cracow at the time of Martinus’ studies were Sacrobosco’s Algorismi (Algorismus de integris and Algorismus de minutiis), the Tractatus de proportionibus of Jordanus Nemorarius, and the Geometria speculativa of Thomas Bradwardine. It is through the Geometria speculativa that students come in touch with Archimedes’ De mensura circuli and through the De curvis superﬁciebus (attributed by Martinus to Geber) with Archimedes’ De sphera et cylindro.19 It is very possible that Richard of Wallingford’s Quadripartitum was also known. The basic arithmetic of sexagesimal fractions was taught in Cracow using treatises like the common algorismi minutiarum or a short treatise that begins Circulus obliquus qui signifer nuncupatur, with explication of the eight [!] arithmetical operations: Sunt autem octo species huius negocii scilicet: reduccio, addicio, subtraccio, duplacio, multiplicacio, divisio et radicum extractio, tam in numeris cubicis quam quadratis.20 In addition, treatises by contemporary Cracow lecturers on mathematics were used, for instance the commentary to Algorismus minutiarum, written in 1430 by Sandivogius of Czechlo.21 Martinus himself was the author, apart from the Summa super tabulas, of mathematical treatises such as an Algorismus minutiarum and a Geometria practica.22 Martinus on the mathematical origins of astronomy and on the relation: numerus—materia (natura materiae) Martinus’ Summa, addressed ﬁrst to Cracow students, but then, taught most probably also in Prague, touches on virtually all questions dealing with astronomy, including geometry of a sphere, the composition of trigonometric and astronomical tables, and the construction of some of the astronomical instruments, together with rules the use of them in some simple observations, then the introduction to astronomical tables (the Alphonsine and the de Lineris tables) and above all, the basics of “mathematics for astronomy”. In fact, at the beginning of the Summa Martinus declares: “Summa tamen hec nonnisi ex mathematica consideracione ortum habet.” [This Summa takes its origins exclusively from mathematical considerations] (250r).23 This radical statement in favor of the mathematical origins of the Summa (and thus of astronomy?) is motivated by the fundamental relation that exists, according to Martinus’ philosophical views, between “materia” (or “natura” or else “natura materiae”) and mathematics. The link between these aspects of the reality is so deep that it permits us to construct astronomy on a mathematical basis, even when number (mathematical speculations involving number) cannot describe matter (the nature of\n\n14\n\n´ GRAZYNA ROSINSKA\n\nmatter) exactly. The fragment that points to the limitation of mathematics with respect to matter runs as follows: [Thabulae astronomicae] calculate sunt per speculaciones mathematicas, que speculaciones mathematice quandoque alio modo capiunt materiam quam habet se in sui natura. [The astronomical tables] are calculated by means of mathematical speculations, and these speculations sometimes grasp matter differently from [the way] the matter is in its own nature]. (275v) Thus, even if mathematics is able to grasp matter, the mathematical (geometrical or numerical) expression may not always correspond exactly to the nature of matter. It seems that the text can be interpreted in two ways: either that there is an occasional lack of correspondence of the mathematical models to celestial reality, caused by the distortion of this reality by mathematics, or that in Nature there is “something” that still remains inaccessible through mathematical formulae. In the second case, it is a question of the incompleteness of mathematical models with respect to the nature of matter, rather than of the falsehood of these models. If the second reading (incompleteness) is correct, it may be concluded that Martinus is offering here the philosophical foundations of astronomy considered as a scientia mixta. The context of Martinus’ statement shows that the “mixture” concerns at least two elements that make up astronomy, namely the observations and the numbers (mathematical speculations) that express the results of observations, presented in the geometrical (kinemtaical) models and in the astronomical tables. It has to be noted, however, that the idea of the inherence of number in the Nature, that permits the “mathematical speculations” about the Nature, is completed by the idea of the transcendence of the Nature with regard to number (and to these “speculations”). Incidentally, the same relation between Nature and number (mathematical speculations), but considered from another point of view, seems to be sometimes indicated by the term mathematica practica—practical mathematics—used in 15th century taxonomies of knowledge. “Practical mathematics” would be understood here not in the sense of “mathematics that serves for practical purposes” but rather “mathematics that has to be veriﬁed through practice” or “mathematics that has to be justiﬁed by the experience of Nature”. And, consequently, the “mathematical models” of the reality that underlie astronomical previsions, from which not only coherence but also correspondence to the Nature is required. “Commensurability” or “Incommensurability”? The expression of irrational relations by “numbers”: minutiae physicae Problems with the mathematical description of matter (the celestial spheres) begin with the exposition of the measurement of the circle. The geometry of the circle obliges Martinus to deal with incommensurate magnitudes. Normally, the discussion of the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter should appear here together with a discussion of the expression by numbers of the ratios between the incommensurable magnitudes. Martinus, however, tries to avoid the problem of incommensurability of magnitudes rather than address it, conscious, as it seems, of its difﬁculty. In fact,\n\n“MATHEMATICS FOR ASTRONOMY” AT UNIVERSITIES IN COPERNICUS’ TIME\n\n15\n\nhe uses the term commensuratio “commensuration” instead of “incommensuration”, when speaking of the ratio of the circumference of the circle to its diameter: Commensuratio circumferencie et diametri. Habita . . . commensuracione dyametri ad circumferenciam . . . ” [Commensuration of circumference and diameter . . . Having commensuration of the diameter to circumference . . . ] (275v). Also, he gives the numerical value of π as 22/7, citing Archimedes but in fact at 1 10 < π < 3 . Martinus convariance with Archimedes’ approximation which is 3 71 7 siders only the second value and treats it as a fraction, at least he does so at the beginning of the lecture: Si enim nota est dyameter et circumferencia nota erit, et econtra. Demonstrat enim Geber [!] “De curvis superﬁciebus” sicut se habet 22 ad 7 sic se habet circumferencia ad dyametrum circuli, ut patet ad sensum, per circinum probando. [If a diameter is known, the circumference will also be known and vice versa. Geber [!] in De curvis superﬁciebus proves that the ratio of a circumference to its diameter is like that of 22 to 7. This is apparent to sense, when [the question] is checked using compass] (276r). Is this a simple lack of precision or a deliberate procedure? Is it possible that Martinus, having in mind the approximations of the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, considers the problem of incommensurable quantities as solved by means of further approximations of irrationals to fractions? Or it is rather that he continues to consider the rough value of π = 22/7 as correct? Rursum, si quis haberet circumferenciam et vellet habere dyametrum multiplicet circumferenciam per 7 et productum dividat per 22. Et quociens est dyameter. Verbi gracia sit circumferencia 44. Multiplicetur per 7 et veniunt 308, que dividantur per 22 et proveniunt 14 dyameter. Et per istum modum poterint commensurari omnes circumferencie suis dyametris et econtra. [Thus, if one knows a circumference [of a circle] and would like to know its diameter, multiply the circumference by 7 and divide the result by 22. Let be circumference equal to 44. Multiplied by 7 results in 308, which divided by 22 results in a diameter of 14. And in this way all circumferences may be commensurated to their diameters and vice versa] (276r). When Martinus transposes plain trigonometry into the reality of the celestial sphere and tries to express the length of the diameter in degrees, the question of a number or of a ratio of incommensurable numbers—“inherent” in matter returns: . . . Sed cum totum celum dividitur in 360 gradus, si igitur vis habere dyametrum in gradibus celi, multiplica circumferenciam per 7 et divide per 22. Multiplicando vero per 7 veniunt 2520 et dividendo per 22 veniunt 114 et remanent 12 vicesimesecunde que signiﬁcant minuta unius gradus. Quod patet: semper sit 60 primus numerus et operando secundum regulas 12 vicesimesecunde fere 32 minuta faciunt. [But, since the heavens are divided into 360 degrees, thus if\n\n16\n\n´ GRAZYNA ROSINSKA\n\nyou want to know the diameter in the degrees of heavens, multiply the circumference by 7 and divide by 22. Through the multiplication by 7 you will receive 2520, which divided by 22 will give 114 and 12 twentytwo seconds which mean minutes of a degree. So it is clear: let 60 always be the ﬁrst number and, following the rules, 12 twentytwo seconds will be [equal to] about 32 minutes]. (284v) Two points are to be noted in Martinus’ text: ﬁrst, the return of the problem of incommensurability of the circumference of a circle and its diameter and, expressed— this time—by a rough approximation to minutes (. . . fere 32 minuta faciunt) and second, the expression of a straight line (diameter) in degrees. Both of them were commonly accepted by mathematicians of that period, with the exception of Bianchini who will try to abandon the old tradition, and to introduce in his concept of trigonometric functions the unitary radius of a circle. In that way, he always expresses the π by number in his trigonometric tables, and gives the values of trigonometric functions in decimal positional fractions. Trigonometric functions and the knowledge of Nature Let us come back to Cracow and to consider the section of Martinus’ Summa devoted to the construction of the table of sines. It opens with the statement: . . . Cognicio sinuum est causa cognicionis motuum in orbibus celstibus non solum tabulas de Lineris cernentibus, verum et Alfoncji, et instrumentorum astronomicalium, videlicet albeonis et similium. Ex speculacione enim sinuum et veri motus sunt computati. Nam noscenti sinus et cordas faciliter adveniet corrigere equaciones tabularum, supposita solum ecentricitate alicuius planete in ordine ad totum semidiametrum. [The knowledge of sines is the cause of the knowledge of movements of the celestial spheres. And this concerns not only the tables [of the movements of the heavenly bodies] of Lineris, but also of Alphonsus, and it [concerns equally] astronomical instruments, the Albion and the like. For the true movements [of planets] are also calculated through the computations of sines. To those who know sines and chords, it is easier to correct the equations [given in] the tables, knowing only the eccentricity of a planet related to the whole semidiameter]. (286v). Et tota veritas thabularum in cognicione sinuum et cordarum pendet. Et non solum in his que supercelestia sunt, sed et in geometricis. [And the whole truths of tables depends on the knowledge of sines and chords. And not only in supra-celestial things, but also in geometry] (284v).24 Subsequently, Martinus refers to the 14th century table of sines, based on the Ptholemean table of chords: Semidiameter autem qualibet in 60 partes dividitur, quare dyameter in 120, ex quorum cognicione in cognicionem sinuum devenitur; ex sinibus autem in cognicionem thabularum verorum motuum planetarum et revolucionis\n\n“MATHEMATICS FOR ASTRONOMY” AT UNIVERSITIES IN COPERNICUS’ TIME\n\n17\n\nﬁrmamenti. [Each semidiameter is divided into 60 parts, thus the diameter in 120. From this knowledge one proceeds to the knowledge of sines; and from sines into the knowledge of the tables of the true movement of planets and of the revolutions of the ﬁrmament.] (286v) The status of sines and of the umbrae (tangent and cotangent): are they lines or ratios? In his geometrical introduction to trigonometry, Martinus refers to the Pythagorean theorem and then considers sines and chords as lines: Et hec linea quandoque sortitur nomen sinus, quandoque nomen corde. Ex quibus sinibus et cordis omnes thabule [sunt] composite . . . [And to that line sometimes is attributed the name sine and sometimes chord. And of these sines and chords are composed all tables . . . ] (284v) As for the character of these lines, Martinus expresses an opinion that sines and chords, as considered on the celestial sphere, do not exist as a reality but are the result of the imagination of mathematicians (linee imaginarie). Apart from the concept of sines as lines, real or imaginary, in Martinus’ lecture there is also a deﬁnition of the astronomical functions conceived as ratios and as proportions: [. . .] Quibus sic stantibus ad quantitatem corde et sinus i.e. proporcionem cum quolibet arcu, secundum quam proporcionem omnes thabule de veris motibus sunt composite, taliter accede. [. . . All considered, proceed in this way to obtain the quantity of chords and sines i.e. to [their] proportion to each arc. According to this proportion all tables of the true movement (of the celestial bodies) have been composed.] (285r) The concept of proportionality, expressed through the numerical values, is even more stressed when the composition of the tables of umbrae is considered. According to the Muslim tradition, going back to the ninth century, the umbra recta and umbra versa result from the ratio of sines to cosines and vice versa. Since, obviously, Martinus does not use the term “cosine”, he recommends using the table of sines for the composition of the tables of umbrae (recta and versa) taking for the composition of the table of tangents: tg α = sine α/sine (90 − α), for an α = 1◦ , 2◦ , 3◦ etc. His table is composed for the length of gnomon equal 12 parts. Componitur autem thabula in hunc modum: [. . .] capias sinum rectum correspondentem uni [sic] gradui ex presenti thabula et reduc usque in secunda. Deinde capias sinum rectum eciam in thabula presenti, positum contra 89 gradus . . . [Proceed in this way in the composition of the table: [. . .] you will take the sine that corresponds to one degree from the present table and reduce it to seconds. Then take the sine, from the same table, disposed against 89 degrees . . . ] (286v–287r)\n\n18\n\n´ GRAZYNA ROSINSKA\n\nThus, when Martinus uses the concept of “proportion” for tabulating tangents (umbra recta) he is no longer thinking of proportionality between lines or between lines and arcs but of proportionality of numerical expressions (in degrees, minutes, etc. reduced to seconds) of sines to cosines.\n\nGIOVANNI BIANCHINI’S EXPOSITION OF TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS. THE SINE CONSIDERED AS A LINE AND AS A RATIO EXPRESSED BY NUMBER: A DECIMAL FRACTION The ﬁrst step: trigonometric tables computed for R = 60 × 10 n Bianchini, in contrast to Martinus Rex who acknowledges the contribution of the 14th century mathematicians to trigonometry, refers himself directly to Ptolemy. He does it simply to demonstrate that any progress, in the matter of trigonometric tables since Ptolemy’s times, is due to his own inventions. These inventions, it seems, result from Bianchini’s research into the proper numerical expression of the ratios of magnitudes. Furthermore, Bianchini was particularly concerned by the fundamental inconsistency, inherent, according to him, in earlier trigonometrical tables and resulting from the fact that the ratios of “heterogeneous magnitudes”, such as “arcs” and “lines”, were tabulated in them. Moreover, he perceived it as incoherent that sines, being lines, should be expressed by degrees, since this was the unit of measure of angles and arcs. This inconsistency, according to Bianchini, is resolved by the use of numbers of a special status, namely by decimal fractions, suited to express all the ratios of all magnitudes, even of the heterogeneous ones. Bianchini’s Declaratio tabularum compositarum per Johannem Blanchinum de sinu et arcu (cap. 1) begins as follows: Primo notandum est quod [. . .] Ptholomeus et alii posteriores operati sunt per tabulas de sinibus seu de cordis medietatis [arcus] compositis per gradus et minuta cum suis fractionibus sexagenariis, que in operationibus multiplicandi et dividendi, seu in radicibus extrahendis, oportet omnia reducere ad minores fractiones; que [operationes] certe tediose et laboriose sunt et de facili per operantes comittitur error—nec videtur consonare quando arcus, cuius quantitas per gradus et minuta denominatur, quod corde ipsius, ex lineis rectis composite, per gradus et minuta determinantur. Ex quibus proposui in tabulis meis sinus per numeros componere, presupponendo dyametrum circuli 120, prout Ptholomeus proposuit, sed sibi addendo tres fractiones ad invicem decenarias. Erit ergo totus dyameter 120 000 et per consequens semidyameter 60 000. [First, it is to be noted [. . .] that Ptolemy and other later [authors] have operated using tables of sines or of chords of half the arc, composed with degrees and minutes and their sexagesimal fractions. In multiplications, divisions and extractions of roots it was necessary to reduce everything to the smallest fractions. Certainly, these operations are tedious and laborious and an error is easily committed. [Moreover] it does not seem consistent when chords, being straight lines, are denoted\n\n“MATHEMATICS FOR ASTRONOMY” AT UNIVERSITIES IN COPERNICUS’ TIME\n\n19\n\nwith degrees and minutes [which are proper to express] the quantity of an arc.] Therefore, I have proposed in my tables to compose sines by numbers. I posit the diameter to be 120, according to Ptolemy, but I add to it three fractions that are decimals of one another. Thus, the whole diameter will be 120 000, and consequently the semidiameter 60 000.] (ms BJ 556, f.11va–11vb).25 Since almost all values of trigonometrical functions express ratios between incommensurable magnitudes, it is not surprising that Bianchini’s (“naive”) concept of a real number appears in the trigonometrical part of his work.26 The “modern tool” is used for the purpose, namely, of decimal positional fractions. The advantages of Bianchini’s tables manifest themselves in the application of them for astronomical computations. In chapter 3 of the Canones mentioned above the rule of multiplication of sines is given: Quando contingeret multiplicare sinus per sinum, generaliter productum fractionum semper in fractionibus augetur. Resecande sunt quatuor ﬁgure ultime ad dextram, quia sunt fractiones fractionum. [. . .] In reliquis autem remanentibus, ut supra dictum est, tres ex ipsis ad dexteram sunt fractiones millenarie graduum, et si alie supersunt ad sinistram sunt gradus integri seu partes ex 120 partibus totius dyametri. [When it occurs to multiply sine by sine, [since] generally the product of fractions always augments in fractions, the four last numerals [digits] on the right are to be cut off [from the product] because they are fractions of fractions. But of those that remain, as was said above, three of those at the right are millenary fractions of degrees, and if others remain to the left, they are whole degrees, or parts of the 120 parts of the total diameter]. This procedure, involving degrees combined together with decimal fractions, is also presented in Book III of the Flores Almagesti where, as Bianchini states: [. . .] per 12 capitula potissime per ﬁguras geometricas et regulas arismetrice [sic] declaravi omnes [11ra] cordas seu sinus subtensos [ . . . ] super quibus composui tabulas ad propositum, per numeros discretos et continuos. [. . . I have vigorously declared in 12 chapters all that concerns chords and sines, by means of diagrams and rules of arithmetic, [. . .] and I have constructed tables for that purpose, with discrete and continuous numbers.] The “discrete numbers” are obviously degrees, the relics of Ptolemean tables still persisting in Bianchini’s. However, “continuous numbers” are Bianchini’s own invention; they are, according to his own terminology “fractions as reciprocally decimal”. Manuscript sources show that very soon after this, Bianchini makes a further step toward the arithmetization of trigonometric tables: he abandons the remnants of sexagesimal calculus and compiles purely decimal tables of tangents (calculated for R = 103 ) and of cosecants (R = 104 ). Both are included in the set of the Tabulae magistrales:\n\n20\n\n´ GRAZYNA ROSINSKA\n\n1. Tangents: Tabula magistralis quarta. Numerus divisionis sinus primi cuiuslibet gradus quarti circuli per sinum eius secundum. [Magistral table number four. The quotient of the division of the prime sine of each degree of the quarter of a circle by its second sine] (BJ 556, 52r–52v).27 2. Cosecants: This table (untitled, BJ 556, 53r–53v) gives values calculated for R = 104 . Bianchini refers to this table in the Additiones Canonum primi mobilis.28 All Bianchini’s trigonometric tables are calculated for intervals of 10 min. The process of the extension of the decimal number system to decimal positional fractions Bianchini was the ﬁrst mathematician in the West to use purely decimal tables of trigonometric functions. It most probably occurred not later than in early 40s, since a complete exposition of the arithmetic of decimal positional fractions was ready as early as 1442 (the year of the dedication to Leonello d’Este of the treatise “Compositio instrumenti”). (A little earlier similar tables drawn up by Al-Kashi (died 1429), had appeared in the East.) In 1467, more than 20 years after Bianchini’s tables, Regiomontanus produced his decimal table of tangents calculated for R = 105 and intervals of 1◦ , and then his decimal tables of sine/cosine for R = 107 and 1 s intervals. Bianchini’s idea of decimal positional fractions evolved. In the Arithmetica, where the principle of the potential extension of the decimal positional number system from integrals to fractions is given, Bianchini considers decimal fractions in Simon Stevin’s way. For him, as for Stevin, “decimal fractions” are integrals.29 He gives a precise deﬁnition of such a “decimal fraction” when he declares: [. . .] omnis ﬁgura ﬁrmata in ordine numerorum denotat fractionem decenariam loci ﬁgurae immediate sequentis ad sinistram, ut puta 342. Dico quod 2 denotat duo decimi unius decenae, et 4 sunt 4 decimi unius centenarii etc. [. . . each ﬁgure, ﬁxed in the order of numbers, denotes a decimal fraction of the ﬁgure that follows it immediately on its left. For example, [in the number] 342, I say that 2 denotes two tenths of a ten, and 4 are 4 tenths of a hundred etc.]30 But, subsequently, Bianchini goes further than Stevin will go a 100 years later. The next step is found in the Compositio instrumenti. This treatise, dedicated to Leonello d’Este, of which the manuscript copy is preserved in Modena, was recently published by Paolo Garuti.31 It is devoted to the construction and use of a surveying instrument called “biffa”. In his description of the scaling of this instrument, Bianchini uses fractions of the tenth progress. Then, he explains the four arithmetical operations with decimal positional fractions, as applicable to the numerical solutions of the typical surveying problems (based on the similarity of triangles and the use of the Pythagoras theorem). Obviously, the complete doctrine of decimal positional fractions, exposed in the treatise on surveying, is meant by Bianchini as generally applicable to the solution of computational problems. We learn from the Compositio instrumenti of two ways\n\n“MATHEMATICS FOR ASTRONOMY” AT UNIVERSITIES IN COPERNICUS’ TIME\n\n21\n\nof writing down decimal fractions. The ﬁrst occurs when readings are taken from the decimal scale of the instrument. Here, the number is presented in the metrological structure, accompanied by the units of measure. Bianchini writes: “pedes 0 untie 7 minuta 4 et secunda 6.” The same quantity, however, expressed in seconds, functions as a number, a decimal positional fraction, in the following notation: .746. secunde (understood as 0.746 pedes).32 The number—decimal fraction—liberated from the units of measure, will be used subsequently in arithmetical operations. The points that are seen at the beginning and at the end of number mark its fractional nature. The ﬁrst point signals the “zero” of integrals. A clear distinction of the fractional part of the number from its integral part, using the decimal point, conﬁrms that Bianchini is really dealing with decimal fractions in the Compositio instrumenti. Moreover, it is to be noted that in the multiplication and division of fractions by fractions, Bianchini places the decimal point in the product or in the quotient using the formulae: 10m × 10n = 10m+n and 10m :10n = 10m−n .33\n\nMATHEMATICS AT CRACOW UNIVERSITY AT THE END OF THE 15TH CENTURY: JOHANNES GLOGOVIENSIS, LECTURER ON MATHEMATICS IN CRACOW AND IN VIENNA AND THE LEGACY OF BIANCHINI AND REGIOMONTANUS. THE REAPPEARANCE OF THE MEDIEVAL ARITHMETIC The time of Copernicus’ university studies in Cracow, the last decade of the 15th century, is particularly interesting because of the reception of earlier contributions, made by Bianchini and Regiomontanus, to mathematical astronomy. From the 60s on, the new generation of astronomical tables was used in Cracow: ﬁrst, Bianchini’s monumental Tabulae primi mobilis accompanied by the Tabulae magistrales, and then Regiomontanus’ Tabulae directionum with the table of tangents—Tabula fecunda. But in the same period, the interest in mathematical and astronomical tables was not balanced by an interest in arithmetic. The teaching of “mathematics for astronomy”, both in Cracow and in Vienna, was at that time still at the level of 13th century elementary arithmetic. This is true in the case of two eminent professors, Albertus de Brudzewo, professor in Cracow in the 80s and Johannes de Glogovia (Glogoviensis), professor at the end of the 15th and 16th centuries in Cracow and in Vienna.34 The mathematical (arithmetical) introduction into Brudzewski’s Commentary on Peurbach’s Theorice nove planetarum teaches the basics of computation with sexagesimal fractions. As for Glogoviensis, he comments, in Cracow and in Vienna, on Sacrobosco’s Algorismi as well as the Algorismus novus de integris composed by Georg Peurbach in Sacrobosco’s tradition. In all these textbooks, number is deﬁned according to Boetian tradition as composed of units (numerus est cumulatio unitatum . . .) and several pages are devoted to the explanation of the geometrical nature of numbers: Ponenda autem est hec divisio numerorum: alius linealis, alius superﬁcialis, alius quadratus, alius cubicus sive solidus sive corporalis. [The following division of\n\n22\n\n´ GRAZYNA ROSINSKA\n\nnumbers is to be posited: line-number, which is different from a superﬁcialnumber, and a square number, and a cube or solid or corporeal number].35 The codex BJ 1840, written by Johannes Glogoviensis and owned ﬁrst by him then by Michael de Wratislavia, is a good example. It contains the following treatises and lectures intended to train astronomers (in Cracow and in Vienna): Algorismus novus de integris, Algorismus de minutiis vulgaribus, Algorismus de minutiis physicalibus, De regula proportionum sive aliter Regula Mercatorum dicta, Opus Algorismi iocundissimi, Algorismus novus de integris mgri Georgii Peurbachii, and Canon multiplicacionis. They are followed by Glogoviensis’ commentary on Sacrobosco’s Omnia que a primeva . . . , the Vienna lecture by Glogoviensis also based on Sacrobosco, ﬁnally the Enigmata: Si vis scire quot dudum habeat aliquis in bursa . . . , and the Tabula algoristica de numeris quadratis, cubicis et eorum radicibus.36 In the ofﬁcial lectures on mathematics there is not a trace of Bianchini’s Arithmetica with the exposition of the principle of decimal fractions, nor of his Algebra, both works meant to provide students with mathematical tools for astronomical computations.\n\nGIOVANNI BIANCHINI’S PATTERNS OF COPERNICUS’ TRIGONOMETRIC TABLES Of the four tables of trigonometric functions linked with the name of Copernicus— because they were calculated by him, or only copied by him, or else attributed to him by historians for a time37 —two are pertinent to our studies: the table of sines for R = 105 and 10’ intervals and the table of secants for R = 104 and 1◦ intervals. Both exist in autograph. The ﬁrst one is incorporated in the De revolutionibus, Book I, chapter 12. Several questions about it remain unsolved (such as the origins of Copernicus’ numerical errors, and the differences between the errors in the holograph and the ﬁrst two editions, etc.). As for the question of the model followed by Copernicus, it still remained unanswered in 1974, when the English version of the De revolutionibus was published with Edward Rosen’s Commentary.38 By the end of the 70s, I pointed out the possibility of the inﬂuence on Copernicus of Bianchini’s tables of decimal trigonometric functions, then recently discovered (ﬁrst published in 1981). In fact, the arrangement of Copernicus’ table corresponds to that of almost all Bianchini’s mathematical and astronomical tables, the intervals of 10 s included. The second of Copernicus’ decimal trigonometric tables, the table of secants composed for R = 104 and 1◦ intervals, was inscribed by Copernicus between the columns of Regiomontanus’ printed Tabula fecunda, the table of tangents, calculated on the same base, R = 104 . In fact, Copernicus used the skeleton of Regiomontanus’ table, inscribing numerical values, computed by himself, in front of degrees running from 1 to 90 in Regiomontanus’ table, as can be seen in numerous editions of the table and its facsimile reproductions.39 Here, the question of the possible inspiration of Copernicus concerns not so much the decimal base of the table and the 1◦ intervals, (Copernicus, when inscribing the data, follows simply the pattern of Regiomontanus’\n\n“MATHEMATICS FOR ASTRONOMY” AT UNIVERSITIES IN COPERNICUS’ TIME\n\n23\n\ntable), but rather the introduction of a trigonometrical function other than sine, cosine, and tangent. In the absence of textual evidence, I would not like to suggest that Copernicus’ idea of calculating a table of secants was inspired by Bianchini’s decimal table of cosecants. But, as I pointed out above, the Cracow astronomers did have at their disposal the set of Bianchini’s Tabulae magistrales, the table of cosecants included, as early as the 60s of the 15th century.\n\n15TH CENTURY MATHEMATICS AND THE HISTORY OF EARLY MODERN SCIENCE The ﬁrst (successful) attempts at the extension of the concept of number, to include negative values and incommensurable ones, are commonly attributed to 16th century mathematicians: Stifel accepted negative and irrational numbers, Bombelli was seen by historians (E. Bortolotti) as the forerunner of Descartes in the use of a “unit segment” for the geometrical expression of number, and Stevin as the inventor of the decimal positional fractions. Some of these ideas and techniques of computation, however, were expounded about a 100 years earlier by Bianchini in treatises intended by their author to help in the university teaching of “mathematics for astronomy”. Not all these inventions were adopted by astronomers in the course of the 15th century. The idea of the table of sines calculated on the pattern 60 × 10n was almost immediately followed by Peurbach. By the time of Regiomontanus’ stay in Venice, in the early 1460s, Bianchini’s Flores Almagesti, as well as his Tabulae primi mobilis (together with the Tabulae magistrales, including the decimal tables of tangent and cosecant), was circulating in Italy. As for the shape of the trigonometric tables of Copernicus, it seems to me that the legacy of Bianchini, known in Cracow since the second half of the 15th century, permits us to see in Copernicus’ achievement the reminiscence of Bianchini’s tables of decimal trigonometric functions. The evolution of the concept of number that occurred in the 15th century scientiﬁc milieus, from Boethius’ version of the Pythagorean idea of number toward the “justiﬁed” use of a (naive) concept of real number, in fact was motivated by the requirements of the university teaching of astronomy. It is not surprising, therefore, that the extension of the concept of number to negative values—a consequence of the use of algebra in astronomical computations—and to irrationals approximated to decimal fractions, was ﬁrst accomplished within the framework of “mathematics for astronomy”. Within the same framework initiated the evolution of the concept of trigonometric functions, from the lines—sides of a right triangle—toward the ratios of numbers in a circle with a unitary radius. Though the tables of decimal trigonometric functions contributed to the simpliﬁcation of computations, they have been not invented, according to Bianchini, for only practical purposes: Bianchini was concerned with the problem of the proper expression of the ratio between “heterogeneous” magnitudes, arcs, and lines in a circle. According to him, numbers, the decimal positional fractions, were the right solution to the problem. Among the consequences of the introduction of the decimal base to the trigonometric tables will be the simpliﬁcation of the formula for the circumference of a circle from 2πr to 2π , with the numerical\n\n24\n\n´ GRAZYNA ROSINSKA\n\nvalue of π approximated to a decimal fraction. The next step will consist in the expression of trigonometric functions by means of π. We are here at the origins of the concept of circular trigonometric functions, developed further in the 17th century mathematics.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS Studies on the 15th century astronomical sources preserved in Italy were possible thanks to the University of Harvard Center for Italian Renaissance Studies, Villa I Tatti, Florence, and the Centro Studie Incontri Europei P.

The document of the foundation (a copy from 1472) is still preserved in the Archives of the Jagellonian University, ms. 44, f. 45r. Professor “Stobnerianus” was responsible for mathematical and astronomical formation of students of the quadrivium, particularly for their knowledge of astronomical tables and their skills in predicting eclipses of the Sun and Moon: “ . . . collegiatus domini Stobneri duos actus faciat. Pro uno legat in mathematica hoc ordine, videlicet Euclidem, perspectivam, arismetricam et musicam et Theoricam planetarum, demum Tabulas Alphoncii, premisso Algorismo minuciarum. [. . .] Pro secundo actu practicet et publicet notoria [. . .] eclipses, almanach et minuciones [sanguinis] pro honore Universitatis”. Cf. ms. in the Archiwum Uniwersytetu Jagiello´nskiego, nr. 68, p. 18.

All students wishing to attend any of the last three, the “higher faculties”, had to go ﬁrst through the Arts Faculty, which was thus considered as a preparation period for higher education. Broadly speaking, the Arts Faculty was in charge of teaching the classical disciplines of the trivium and quadrivium. The three branches of the trivium were the verbal disciplines (artes sermonicales) of grammar, rhetoric, and logic, whereas the quadrivium was composed of the four mathematical disciplines: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. However, this classiﬁcation of the liberal arts varied with time and from place to place. The fact remains that teaching of liberal arts, and particularly that of astronomy, was strongly conditioned by its role as a way to get to the higher faculties. Therefore, it is not surprising that astronomy was seen by most students as a tool for other disciplines, medicine in the ﬁrst place, but not as a discipline in itself. Note also that the level of astronomy required for the purposes of medical astrology did not meet a high standard, and any basic astronomy would sufﬁce. This is what astronomical textbooks indicate as well. The most widely used textbook in this discipline during the late Middle Ages was a very simple treatise written in the 13th century by an Englishman called John of Holywood, better known as Sacrobosco. This book, entitled De sphera, survives in hundreds of manuscripts, which are found in libraries throughout Europe, thus giving an indication of its popularity among university students.2 Sacrobosco’s treatise, as well as similar less-diffused works, did not pay much attention to the motions of the planets. But this was a subject that by Sacrobosco’s time had reached a very sophisticated level, mainly due to the compilation of astronomical tables in Muslim Spain. Then, in order to explain the foundations of planetary motions and as a complement to Sacrobosco’s Sphere, another type of textbook appeared with the generic name of Theoricae planetarum.3 Different versions of the Theoricae planetarum are also found in many miscellaneous codices, but the number of copies of all the versions together is much smaller than the number of copies of Sacrobosco’s Sphere. Needless to say, these textbooks were based on Ptolemy’s astronomy, as presented mainly in his Almagest. This book lay behind the curriculum although it was rarely used in the university.4 This is conﬁrmed by the few copies of the Almagest preserved 29 M. Feingold and V. Navarro-Brot´ons (eds.), Universities and Science in the Early Modern Period, 29–36. C 2006 Springer. Printed in the Netherlands.\n\n30\n\n´ JOSE´ CHABAS\n\nin Latin manuscripts, despite the fact that Ptolemy’s treatise was known in Latin since it was ﬁrst translated from Arabic into Latin in Toledo by Gerard of Cremona in 1157. So, for a long time astronomical activity continued to develop mainly outside the academic world, as was obviously the case before the founding of universities. Now, it is difﬁcult to establish how academic astronomy shifted from an auxiliary discipline to a discipline in itself, and when and why separate chairs in astronomy were created. We know that the Jagiellonian University of Cracow inaugurated a chair in the early 15th century. We also know that John of Gmunden, beginning in about 1420, was the incumbent of the chair of astronomy at the University of Vienna.5 As for Spain, we have no information of that sort until about 1460. This seems to be the date the ﬁrst chair of astronomy was created at the University of Salamanca. It is worthwhile noting that it was called “cathedra astrologia”, for “astrologia” was the term most commonly used to designate mathematical astronomy, and it included those parts of astronomy not related to predictions or prognostications. The ﬁrst person to hold a chair of astronomy at the University of Salamanca, and most likely in any Spanish university, was Nicholaus Polonius.6 As his name suggests, he probably came from Poland. Not much is known about him, but he is mentioned for the ﬁrst time in the Libro de Claustros of the University of Salamanca for 1464–1474: on 22 March 1464 the vice-rector, Diego de Castro, comments on the decision to ﬁll the chair of astrology after a long absence of Nicholaus Polonius: per recessum et longam abscenciam vene[rabi]lis viri Nicholai polonij eiusdem cathedre ultimi cathedratici. As will be argued later, there is evidence that Polonius was in Salamanca no later than 1460. On the other hand, we do not know the reasons why he left his chair. As a matter of fact, there are many other important questions for which we do not have adequate answers: Why was it decided to create a chair of astrology/astronomy at the University of Salamanca? What were the social needs for it? Why a foreigner? What brought Polonius to Salamanca in the ﬁrst place? Was not there any local astronomer available? In his Diccionario Hispano-Latino (Salamanca ca. 1495), the humanist and grammarian Elio Antonio de Nebrija (1444–1522) wrote a dedication “Al mui magniﬁco e assi ilustre se˜nor Don Juan de estuniga maestre dela cauelleria de alcantara dela orden del cister”. In this text he mentions some of his professors at the University of Salamanca: “I dexando agora los a˜nos de mi ni˜nez passados en mi tierra debaxo de bachilleres e maestros de gramatica e logica: dexando aquellos cinco a˜nos que en Salamanca oi en las mathematicas a Apolonio: en la ﬁlosoﬁa natural a Pascual de aranda en la moral a Pedro de osma maestros cada uno en su arte mui se˜nalado . . .” (f. a.ij.va) The “Apolonio” mentioned by Nebrija has to be Nicholaus Polonius; there was no other professor of “mathematics” by that name. On the other hand, the 5 years spent by Nebrija at the University of Salamanca cover the period 1455–1460, just before\n\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA AND THE RENAISSANCE OF ASTRONOMY\n\n31\n\nhis 10-year sojourn in Bologna. Thus, Nicholaus Polonius had to be present at the University no later than 1460. What we deﬁnitely know about Polonius is that while in Salamanca he composed a set of "
