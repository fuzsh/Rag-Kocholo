        "text": "It is my great pleasure to inform you that our article entitled \"Extended State-Dependent Differential Riccati Equation (ESDDRE) Controller Design for a Chemical Plug-Flow Reactor via Time-Delay Partial Differential Equation\" has been published in \"Iranian Journal of Science and Technology, Transactions of Electrical Engineering\". This paper offers a nonlinear controller for a non-isothermal PFR governed by time-delay first-order partial differential equation (PDE). Due to, an Extended state-dependent differential Riccati equation (ESDDRE) of the PFR system, a sub-optimal nonlinear controller is suggested. At the first step, an Extended pseudo-linearization (EPL) presentation of the PFR with State-dependent coefficients (SDC) is designed. All of the time-delay terms in this representation are situated in the input vectors as well as the system matrices. Then, a control signal regard on the ESDDRE controller is generated by introducing a Hamiltonian equation and performance index according to the PDE systems. Moreover, the asymptotic stability regarded on ESDDRE controller is guaranteed by applying a suitable Lyapunov theory. Simulation results verify the efficiency of the recommended ESDDRE controller method for two EPL form presentations with different time delays. #optimalcontrol #SDRE #PDE #Riccati\n\n𝐊𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠: 𝐓𝐮𝐛𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 👉 A tubular reactor is a type of #chemicalreactor that consists of a cylindrical tube in which chemical reactions take place. This design is commonly used in various #industrialprocesses where continuous flow and efficient conversion of reactants into products are crucial. 👉#Tubularreactors are particularly suitable for reactions that require a longer residence time, and they offer advantages such as uniform temperature distribution and enhanced heat transfer. 👉 In a tubular reactor, reactants are continuously fed into one end of the tube, and the products are collected at the other end. The reactants flow through the tube, undergoing chemical transformations as they move along its length. The #reactionkinetics and the reactor's geometry determine the residence time, which is the duration the reactants spend inside the reactor. 👉 Chemical reactions occurring in tubular reactors vary widely and can include #synthesisreactions, #polymerization, and #catalyticprocesses. The design is versatile and can be adapted to different reaction conditions, making it suitable for both exothermic and endothermic reactions. Additionally, the tubular reactor allows for precise control over reaction parameters, contributing to better selectivity and yield. 👉 Despite their advantages, tubular reactors also pose challenges, such as potential issues related to scaling up and maintaining consistent temperature profiles. Proper engineering and design considerations are crucial to address these challenges and optimize the performance of tubular reactors in #industrialapplications.

The concept of non-ideality in the vapor phase plays a crucial role in this context, diverging from the simplistic assumptions of ideal gas behavior to embrace the complexities of real-world phenomena. Ideal gas laws, while providing a foundational understanding, often fall short in accurately predicting the behavior of gases under high pressure or low temperature conditions, where molecular interactions cannot be ignored. Non-ideality in the vapor phase acknowledges these interactions, incorporating factors such as volume exclusion and intermolecular forces, which become increasingly significant in dense gases or when the system pressure exceeds a certain threshold. This blog post explains how the volume of vapor decreases when pressure increases, especially when the system's pressure goes above 5 atmospheres because the molecules interact more. For calculations involving the balance between vapor and liquid phases (vapor-liquid equilibrium, or VLE), it's important to consider that both the vapor and liquid phases may not behave ideally. An equation of state can help with calculations for fractionating columns, which separate components based on differences in boiling points. The ideal equation for VLE states that the total pressure multiplied by the vapor phase mole fraction equals the vapor pressure multiplied by the liquid phase mole fraction. However, to account for non-ideal behavior, two additional parameters are introduced: Gamma (γ) for the liquid phase non-ideality and Phi (Φ) for the vapor phase non-ideality. The modified equation becomes P * Y * Φ = VP * X * γ , indicating how these parameters are used to account for the non-ideal behavior in both phases. The exploration of non-ideality in vapor and liquid phases underscores the complexity of real-world chemical processes and the limitations of ideal models. By integrating the non-ideal behavior of both phases into VLE calculations, engineers and scientists can achieve more precise and reliable predictions, essential for the efficient design and optimization of separation processes. The addition of Gamma and Phi parameters to the VLE equation represents a pivotal step towards embracing the intricacies of phase behavior, ensuring that theoretical models more closely mirror actual conditions. This knowledge not only enriches our understanding of thermodynamic principles but also enhances the practical capabilities of chemical engineering applications. #chemicalengineering #thermodynamics #VaporPhase #IdealGasLaw #STEM #innovation #techtalk #futuretech #sustainability #Scienceeveryday #engineeringlife #industrialengineering\n\nUnderstanding Heat Transfer: Conduction, Convection, and Applications Heat transfer is a fundamental concept in various fields, including engineering, physics, and chemistry.

However, inefficient removal of the generated heat due to the exothermic reaction can seriously influence reactor performance. Hence, quantifying and understanding the heat transfer phenomena in this reactor is essential to enhance the performance of the reactor and consequently the chemical process. To achieve a better quantification and understanding of the heat transport in this reactor, an advanced heat transfer technique has been used in this study to quantify the impact of the presence of the cooling tubes on the local heat transfer coefficient under different operating conditions for this reactor. It has been found that the local heat transfer coefficient in the fluidized bed reactor equipped with a bundle of vertical tubes increases significantly as superficial gas velocity increases at the wall region, while different behavior was noticed at the center of the reactor. Moreover, the results show that the local heat transfer significantly decreases at the reactor's core region for all studied superficial gas velocities. Furthermore, the new tube arrangement offers a uniform local heat transfer profile for all studied operating conditions. The obtained new high-quality experimental data for the local heat transfer coefficient in a fluidized bed reactor equipped with a bundle of tubes can be used for validation CFD simulations or mathematical models, facilitating the design, scale up, and operation of this reactor. Highlights: • An experimental investigation was carried out in mimicked Fischer-Tropsch fluidized bed reactor with vertical heat exchanging tubes. • An advanced heat transfer technique was used to quantify the heat transfer coefficient locally and instantaneously. • The impact of vertical heat exchanging tubes on the local heat transfer coefficient was investigated. • The findings of this study would further improve the knowledge of the impact of vertical heat exchanging tubes on heat transfer in gas-solid fluidized bed reactor.
