To characterize motor imagery (MI) tasks for brain–computer interface (BCI) implementation is an easy and cost-effective tool. The MI task is represented by a short-time trial of multichannel EEG. In this paper, the signal of each channel of raw EEG is decomposed into a finite set of narrowband signals using a Fourier-transformation-based bandpass filter. Rhythmic components of EEG are represented by each of the narrowband signals that characterize the brain activities related to MI tasks. The subband signals are arranged to extend the dimension of the EEG trial in the spatial domain. The spatial features are extracted from the set of extended trials using a common spatial pattern (CSP). An optimum number of features are employed to classify the motor imagery tasks using an artificial neural network. An integrated approach with full-band and narrowband signals is implemented to derive discriminative features for MI classification. In addition, the subject-dependent parameter optimization scheme enhances the performance of the proposed method. The performance evaluation of the proposed method is obtained using two publicly available benchmark datasets (Dataset I and Dataset II). The experimental results in terms of classification accuracy (93.88% with Dataset I and 91.55% with Dataset II) show that it performs better than the recently developed algorithms. The enhanced MI classification accuracy is very much applicable in BCI implementation.

The modeling of the production of these products is important because they affect the energy balance of petroleum refinery and the associated emissions of greenhouse gases. For the first time, such a model is proposed and it is a continuation of the investigations of refinery process modelling by GNs. The model contains 17 transitions, 55 places, and 47 types of tokens, and considers the orders of fuel gas for the refinery power station, refinery process furnaces, LPG, liquid propylene, and 6 grades of polypropylene. This model is intended to be used as a more detailed lower-level GN model in a higher-level GN model that facilitates and optimizes the process of decision making in the petroleum refining industry.

By employing conformable descriptions of fractional derivatives within the CCE framework, our method ensures enhanced accuracy and robustness when dealing with fractional order equations. To validate our approach’s applicability and effectiveness, we conduct a comprehensive set of numerical examples and assess stability using the Fourier method. The proposed technique demonstrates unconditional stability within specific parameter ranges, ensuring reliable performance across diverse scenarios. The convergence order analysis reveals its efficiency in handling complex mathematical models. Graphical comparisons with analytical solutions substantiate the accuracy and efficacy of our approach, establishing it as a powerful tool for solving nonlinear time-fractional differential equations. We further demonstrate its broad applicability by testing it on the Burgers–Fisher equations and comparing it with existing approaches, highlighting its superiority in biology, ecology, physics, and other fields. Moreover, meticulous evaluations of accuracy and efficiency using (L2 and L∞) norm errors reinforce its robustness and suitability for real-world applications. In conclusion, this paper presents a novel numerical technique for nonlinear time fractional differential equations, with the CCE and NPS methods’ unique combination driving its effectiveness and broad applicability in computational mathematics, scientific research, and engineering endeavors.

To manage such a large number of applications, efficient computing techniques using fog nodes will be required. A major challenge in such IoT networks is to manage the resource allocation of fog computing nodes considering security and system efficiency. A secure selection of fog nodes will be needed for forwarding the tasks without interception by the eavesdropper and minimizing the task delay. However, challenges such as the secure selection of fog nodes for forwarding the tasks without interception by the eavesdropper and minimizing the task delay are critical in IoT-based fog computing. In this paper, an efficient technique is proposed that solves the formulated problem of allocation of the tasks to the fog node resources using a stable matching algorithm. The proposed technique develops preference profiles for both IoT and fog nodes based on factors such as delay and secrecy rate. Finally, Gale–Shapley matching is used for task offloading. Detailed simulation results show that the performance of the proposed technique is significantly higher than the recent techniques in the literature.

With natural exponents, the quasi-exponentiated normal distributions coincide with the distributions of the corresponding powers of normal random variables with zero mean. Their representability as scale mixtures of normal and exponential distributions is proved. The mixing distributions are written out in the closed form. Two approaches to the construction of asymmetric quasi-exponentiated normal distributions are described. A limit theorem is proved for sums of a random number of independent random variables in which the asymmetric quasi-exponentiated normal distribution is the limit law.

Assuming that the thin heterogeneous layer is made up of microstructures that are uniformly distributed inside, we obtain in the limit an upscaled model in the lower space dimension. We also prove a corrector-type result very useful in numerical computations. In view of the thin structure of the domain, we appeal to a concept of two-scale convergence adapted to thin heterogeneous media to achieve our goal.

Edges can be used to determine the size, orientation, and properties of the object of interest within an image. There are different techniques employed for edge detection, one of them being phase congruency, a recently developed but still relatively unknown technique due to its mathematical and computational complexity compared to more popular methods. Additionally, it requires the adjustment of a greater number of parameters than traditional techniques. Recently, a unique formulation was proposed for the mathematical description of phase congruency, leading to a better understanding of the technique. This formulation consists of three factors, including a quantification function, which, depending on its characteristics, allows for improved edge detection. However, a detailed study of the characteristics had not been conducted. Therefore, this article proposes the development of a generalized function for quantifying phase congruency, based on the family of functions that, according to a previous study, yielded the best results in edge detection.

Addressing the challenge of numerous and complex ADRC parameters, optimization algorithms are employed for parameter tuning. This paper draws on the group mechanism of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm and innovatively introduces population search into the Beetle Antennae Search (BAS) algorithm. The refined algorithm is then applied to tune the ADRC parameters, reducing complexity and human intervention while enhancing intelligence and efficiency. The advanced optimization algorithm exhibits an exceptional global optimization capacity, convergence speed, and stability. Ultimately, flight simulation and experimental results suggest that the optimized ADRC controller demonstrates superior control and antidisturbance capabilities.

The patient’s weakened neurological system damages the tissues of the foot’s skin, which results in amputation. This study aims to validate and deploy a deep learning-based system for the automatic classification of abrasion foot sores (AFS) and ischemic diabetic foot sores (DFS). We proposed a novel model combining convolutional neural network (CNN) capabilities with Vgg-19. The proposed method utilized two benchmark datasets to classify AFS and DFS from the patient’s foot. A data augmentation technique was used to enhance the accuracy of the training. Moreover, image segmentation was performed using UNet++. We tested and evaluated the proposed model’s classification performance against two well-known pre-trained classifiers, Inceptionv3 and MobileNet. The proposed model classified AFS and ischemia DFS images with an accuracy of 99.05%, precision of 98.99%, recall of 99.01%, MCC of 0.9801, and f1 score of 99.04%. Furthermore, the results of statistical evaluations using ANOVA and Friedman tests revealed that the proposed model exhibited a remarkable performance. The proposed model achieved an excellent performance that assist medical professionals in identifying foot ulcers.

A soft computing stochastic-based Bayesian regularization neural network approach (BRNNA) is provided to investigate the numerical accomplishments of the MFLMM. The nonlinear system is classified into two dynamics, whereas the correctness of the BRNNA is observed through the comparison of results. Furthermore, the reducible performance of the absolute error improves the exactitude of the computational BRNNA. Twenty neurons have been chosen, along with the data statics of training 74% and 13%, for both authorization and testing. The consistency of the designed BRNNA is demonstrated using the correlation/regression, error histograms, and transition of state values in order to solve the MFLMM.

The averaged model of the dc-dc power converter is derived, based on which a robust control law is developed using a simplified sliding-mode control technique. The existence and stability conditions are introduced to select proper controller gains that ensure fast output voltage convergence towards reference voltage. A detailed design procedure is provided to realize the control scheme using low-cost discrete components. The proposed control method handles large disturbances, accommodates the non-minimum phase property, and maintains regulated output voltage during step-up and step-down operation modes. The control system also maintains constant switching frequency, improves the transient response, and eliminates the steady-state error at the output voltage. A MATLAB/SIMULINK model is developed to simulate the closed-loop dc-dc Zeta converter in continuous conduction mode and investigate the tracking and regulation performance. The simulation results confirm the robustness and stability of the nonlinear controlled power converter under abrupt line and load variations.

Current research on CJRMs is mainly under static loading, which cannot meet the actual needs of engineering. This paper adopts the finite element method (FEM) to carry out numerical simulation tests on irregular CJRMs with different dip angles under different dynamic stress wave loadings. The dynamic failure modes of irregular CJRMs and the influence law of related stress wave parameters are obtained. The results show that when the column dip angle α is 0°, the tensile-compressive-shear failure occurs in the CJRMs; when α is 30°, the CJRMs undergo tensile failure and a small amount of compressive shear failure, and an obvious crack-free area appears in the middle of the rock mass; when α is 60°, tensile failure is dominant and compressive shear failure is minimal and no crack area disappears; and when α is 90°, the rock mass undergoes complete tensile failure. In addition, in terms of the change law of stress wave parameters, the increase in peak amplitude will increase the number of cracks, promote the development of cracks, and increase the proportion of compression-shear failure units for low-angle rock mass. The changes in the loading and decay rate only affect the degree of crack development in the CJRMs, but do not increase the number of cracks. Meanwhile, the simulation results show that the crack expansion velocity of the CJRMs increases with the increase in dip angle, and the CJRMs with dip angle α = 60° are the most vulnerable to failure. The influence of the loading and decay rate on the rock mass failure is different with the change in dip angle. The results of the study provide references for related rock engineering.

To test the homogeneity of the model, the empirical likelihood ratio test (ELRT) has been shown to be valid. In this paper, we conduct a parametric test procedure. We transform the hypothesis of homogeneity to one on the equality of mean parameters of the exponential family of distributions. Then, we propose a modified Wald test and give its asymptotic power. We further apply it to the semicontinuous case when there is an excess of zeros in the sample. The simulation studies show that the new test controls the type-I error better than ELRT while retaining competitive power. Benefiting from the simple closed form of the test statistic, the computational cost is small. We also use a real data example to illustrate the effectiveness of our test.

The variational integrator is proved to be unconditionally linearly stable using the von Neumann method. A priori error bound for the scheme is given from the Sobolev inequality and the discrete conservation laws. Subsequently, the variational integrator is derived to converge at O(Δx2+Δt2) in the discrete L2 norm using the energy method. The numerical experimental results match our theoretical derivation.

The main model can be transferred to a partial-integro differential equation (PIDE) with a weakly singular kernel. The spatial direction is approximated by a fourth-order difference scheme. Also, the temporal derivative is discretized via a second-order numerical procedure. First, the spatial derivatives are approximated by a fourth-order operator to compute the second-order derivatives. This process produces a system of differential equations related to the time variable. Then, the Crank–Nicolson idea is utilized to achieve a full-discrete scheme. The kernel of the integral term is discretized by using the Lagrange polynomials to overcome its singularity. Subsequently, we prove the convergence and stability of the new difference scheme by utilizing the Rayleigh–Ritz theorem. Finally, some numerical examples in one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases are presented to verify the theoretical results.

Preprocessing and dimensionality reduction are the two most commonly used data-processing methods and are very important for single-cell clustering. However, we found that different preprocessing and dimensionality reduction methods have very different effects on single-cell clustering. In addition, there seems to be no specific combination of preprocessing and dimensionality reduction methods that is applicable to all datasets. In this study, we developed a new algorithm for improving single-cell clustering results, called SCM. It first automatically searched for an optimal combination that corresponds to the best cell type clustering of a given dataset. It then defined a flexible cell-to-cell distance measure with data specificity for cell-type clustering. Experiments on ten benchmark datasets showed that SCM performed better than almost all the other seven popular clustering algorithms. For example, the average ARI improvement of SCM over the second best method SC3 even reached 29.31% on the ten datasets, which demonstrated its great potential in revealing cellular heterogeneity, identifying cell types, depicting cell functional states, inferring cellular dynamics, and other related research areas.

In this paper, we study the two fundamental concepts: inverses and determinants of general n×n block matrices. In the first part, the inverses of 2×2 block matrices are given, where one of the blocks is a non-singular matrix, a result which can be generalised to a block matrix of any size, by splitting it into four blocks. The second part focuses on the determinants, which is covered in two different methods. In the first approach, we revise a formula for the determinant of a block matrix A, with blocks elements of R; a commutative subring of Mn×n(F). The determinants of tensor products of two matrices are also given in this part. In the second method for computing the determinant, we give the general formula, which would work for any block matrix, regardless of the ring or the field under consideration. The individual formulas for determinants of 2×2 and 3×3 block matrices are also produced here.

However, when the impact of exogenous variables becomes notably pronounced, an alternative approach is warranted. Spatial Expansion, coupled with the Casetti model approach, serves as an extension of the SAR model, accommodating the influence of these exogenous variables. This modeling technique finds application in the realm of rainfall prediction, where exogenous factors, such as air temperature, humidity, solar irradiation, wind speed, and surface pressure, play pivotal roles. Consequently, this research aimed to combine the SAR and Spatial Expansion models through the Casetti model approach, leading to the creation of the Spatial Autoregressive Exogenous (SAR-X) model. The SAR-X was employed to forecast the rainfall patterns in the West Java region, utilizing data obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (NASA POWER) dataset. The practical execution of this research capitalized on the computational capabilities of the RStudio software version 2022.12.0. Within the framework of this investigation, a comprehensive and integrated RStudio script, seamlessly incorporated into the RShiny web application, was developed so that it is easy to use.

In today’s big data age, while the predict-then-optimize framework has become a standard method for tackling uncertain optimization challenges using machine learning tools, many prediction models overlook data intricacies such as outliers and heteroskedasticity. These oversights can degrade decision-making quality. To enhance predictive accuracy and consequent decision-making quality, we introduce a data transformation technique into the predict-then-optimize framework. Our approach transforms target values in linear regression, decision tree, and random forest models using a power function, aiming to boost their predictive prowess and, in turn, drive better decisions. Empirical validation on several datasets reveals marked improvements in decision tree and random forest models. In contrast, the benefits of linear regression are nuanced. Thus, while data transformation can bolster the predict-then-optimize framework, its efficacy is model-dependent. This research underscores the potential of tailoring transformation techniques for specific models to foster reliable and robust decision-making under uncertainty.

In this study, the stability behavior of inhomogeneous nanocomposite cylindrical shells (INH-NCCSs), under combined axial compression and hydrostatic pressure in the thermal environment, is investigated by means of the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT). The nanocomposite material is modeled as homogeneous and heterogeneous and is based on a carbon nanotube (CNT)-reinforced polymer with the linear variation of the mechanical properties throughout the thickness. In the heterogeneous case, the mechanical properties are modeled as the linear function of the thickness coordinate. The basic equations are derived as partial differential equations and solved in a closed form, using the Galerkin procedure, to determine the critical combined loads for the selected structure in thermal environments. To test the reliability of the proposed formulation, comparisons with the results obtained by finite element and numerical methods in the literature are accompanied by a systematic study aimed at testing the sensitivity of the design response to the loading parameters, CNT models, and thermal environment.

The installation of LED in-ground traffic lights is one strategy that has proven to be quite effective in preventing numerous traffic accidents, notably pedestrian accidents. The traffic signal helps reduce accidents for pedestrians, but there is a drawback in that such installations may lead to cognitive errors, such as the driver making a mistaken start or stop. Therefore, it is crucial to validate cognitive errors in advance of the widespread adoption of LED in-ground traffic signals. To this end, in this study, we (i) built an experimental environment that can be employed for various traffic tests using digital twins and virtual simulators; (ii) designed test scenarios and measurement plans for validation to conduct a validation test, and (iii) demonstrated cognitive errors through data from various experiments. As a result, it was proven that there is a possibility that the LED in-ground traffic lights may cause cognitive errors for drivers, and the causes of this were analyzed. In the future, this framework can be used to demonstrate various transportation problems and can contribute to improving the quality of public safety.

The xFoFs estimate 35 anthropometric features of human faces with normal expressions and frontalized poses. Using these xFoFs, we have developed a method to objectively measure facial impressions, compiling a dataset of approximately 4896 facial images to validate our method. The ranking of xFoFs among the face image dataset guides an objective and quantitative estimation of facial impressions. To further corroborate our study, we conducted two user studies: an examination of the first and strongest impression perception and a validation of the consistency of multiple important impression perceptions. Our work significantly contributes to the field of facial recognition and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) by providing an effective solution for integrating xFoFs with existing facial recognition models.

Spherical-shell waves are obtained, which are associated to the primary P and S seismic waves. It is shown that these waves produce secondary waves with sources on the plane surface of a half-space, which have the form of abrupt walls with a long tail, propagating in the interior and on the surface of the half-space. These secondary waves are associated to the seismic mainshock. The results, previously reported, are re-derived using Fourier transformations and specific regularization procedures.

Our methodology incorporates horseshoe, Laplace, and factor-based shrinkage priors to construct Bayesian estimators for CAPM, accounting for the presence of measurement errors. Through the use of simulated data, we illustrate the potential of our approach in mitigating the bias arising from errors-in-variables. Importantly, the conventional two-stage least squares estimation of the CAPM beta is shown to experience bias escalation as the number of instruments increases. In contrast, our approach effectively counters this bias, particularly in scenarios with a substantial number of instruments. In an empirical application using real-world data, our proposed methodology generates subtly distinct estimated CAPM beta values compared with both the ordinary least squares and the two-stage least squares approaches. This disparity in estimations carries notable economic implications. Furthermore, when applied to average cross-sectional asset returns, our approach significantly enhances the explanatory power of the CAPM framework.

However, observed richness often underestimates the true richness due to resource limitations, particularly in a small-sized sample or highly heterogeneous assemblage. To estimate the number of different species (species richness) present across several different sites (communities), researchers often use a combined collection of data (an integrated dataset). This dataset is created by collecting samples from each site individually and independently. However, the pooled sample of integrated data is no longer a random sample from the entire area, and the use of different sampling schemes results in different collected data formats. Consequently, employing a single sampling distribution to model the pooled sample becomes unfeasible, rendering existing richness estimators inadequate. This study provides a theoretical explanation for the applicability of Chao’s lower bound estimator in assessing species richness across multiple sites based on the pooled sample. Additionally, a new non-parametric estimator is introduced, which adjusts the bias of Chao’s lower bound estimator by leveraging the Good–Turing frequency formula. This proposed estimator only utilizes the richness of singletons, doubletons, and tripletons in the pooled sample to estimate undetected richness. Simulated datasets across various models are employed to demonstrate the statistical performance of the estimator, showcasing its ability to reduce the bias of observed richness and provide accurate 95% confidence intervals. Real datasets are also utilized to illustrate the practical application of the proposed approach.

Several MCDM methods have been introduced. However, real-world problems often involve uncertain and ambiguous decision-maker inputs. Therefore, fuzzy MCDM methods have emerged to handle this problem using fuzzy logic. Most recently, the method based on the removal effects of criteria using the geometric mean (MEREC-G) and ranking the alternatives based on the trace to median index (RATMI) were introduced. However, to date, there is no fuzzy extension of the two novel methods. This study introduces a new hybrid fuzzy MCDM approach combining fuzzy MEREC-G and fuzzy RATMI. The fuzzy MEREC-G can accept linguistic input terms from multiple decision-makers and generates consistent fuzzy weights. The fuzzy RATMI can rank alternatives according to their fuzzy performance scores on each criterion. The study provides the algorithms of both fuzzy MEREC-G and fuzzy RATMI and demonstrates their application in adopted real-world problems. Correlation and scenario analyses were performed to check the new approach’s validity and sensitivity. The new approach demonstrates high accuracy and consistency and is sufficiently sensitive to changes in the criteria weights, yet not too sensitive to produce inconsistent rankings.
