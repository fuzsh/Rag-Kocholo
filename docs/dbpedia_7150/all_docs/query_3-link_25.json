The age in question historians call the Enlightenment,1 and the invention was the electric or voltaic battery, the earliest examples of which were built toward the end of 1799. The present book revolves around wideranging questions like the one just raised, and it seeks the answers in a detailed study of the cultures of science and technology in late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century Europe. Many of the threads linking the Enlightenment tradition to the science of electricity are already well known. “The Enlightenment liked to play with electricity,” it has been noted by a leading historian in the field,2 and a figure like Benjamin Franklin was represented already by his contemporaries as embodying an alliance between the science of electricity and “enlightened” political endeavors.3 The present book focuses on the specific threads linking the battery to Enlightenment culture on one hand, and to later industrial societies on the other. The book argues that a key factor in the process that led to the battery was the cultural, technological, and social ferment that, around 1800, inspired a mixed population of natural philosophers, physicists, physicians, instrument makers, and amateurs interested in electricity, belonging to different cultural traditions and scattered over several European countries. The book further argues that the role of the inventor in that process was, to an important extent, one of interpreting and mediating between the different agendas pursued within that mixed population. By emphasizing the diversity of the cultures involved in the process that led to the battery—and the unintended consequences attached to diversity—the book outlines a picture of late Enlightenment science and technology that goes beyond the interpretive framework provided by the traditional conflicting views held by the supporters or critics of the Enlightenment and their present-day descendants.4 The book argues that the diversity of the cultures and goals involved in the pursuit of science and technology around 1800 was just as important as the discipline propounded by some of the followers of the Enlightenment as a key factor in the scientific enterprise. The book also argues that the unintended consequences of diversity (and thus the difficulty of orienting and predicting scientific and technological change) character-\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nized the earlier, no less than the later, stages of the age of electricity. As in other fields of comparatively free human endeavor, too in scientific and technological pursuits both diversity and unintended consequences seem to be at work, in spite of the efforts of the advocates of a normative view of science, rationality, and social order, or the understandable denunciations leveled by those critics of the Enlightenment tradition who fear the power of elites won over to the notion of useful knowledge. The book’s narrative follows three main lines. The first is biographical: it is the story of Alessandro Volta, a leading figure in the history of the science of electricity during the late Enlightenment, and the inventor of the battery. His personal, scientific, and social endeavors are dealt with, offering a glimpse of what it meant to be a “natural philosopher” (the old phrase for scientist) and an inventor of electrical instruments (mostly useless, by our early-twenty-first-century standards) in late-eighteenth-century Europe. Insofar as it is a biography, this is a biography in context. Volta’s work and instruments are appraised both as products of specialist endeavor and in connection with the reforms of the educational system and the public administration then under way in several European countries. Volta, whom historiography has singled out as a key figure in the transition of the science of electricity from amateur to professional enterprise, was also a well-known figure in the Republic of Letters, to which enlightened “philosophers” felt they belonged. We thus explore Volta’s network of acquaintances and his frequent travels, during which he felt as much at home in London, Paris, Geneva, Berlin, Go¨ ttingen, or Vienna, where he would perform his electrical experiments, as in Milan, Pavia, or Como, in Lombardy (then part of the Austrian empire), where he was born. The second line the book follows is an inquiry into some long-term features of the culture of science and technology as they developed in the early age of electricity. This entails a reassessment of the legacies of the Enlightenment based on a field of historical evidence—placed at the intersection between cultures, natural philosophies, and machines—that has received comparatively little attention by the interpreters of the Enlightenment tradition so far. Seen from a long-term perspective, the case of Volta and the battery can be regarded as a paradigmatic episode in the economy of invention enforced by Enlightenment ideas and practices: a case study of some of the consequences brought about by Enlightenment values and notions, which resulted in the introduction of the nineteenth-century figure of the “scientist” and the partial eclipse of the “natural philosopher.”\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nThe third line of inquiry to be pursued is epistemological and anthropological. It is an investigation into the material culture of science and technology exemplified in Volta’s machines. It describes their early, “private” development, as well as their public career, using the rich documentation offered by Volta’s laboratory notes and by the negotiations he undertook to obtain recognition via a varied network of expert and amateur electricians, patrons, and reward-dispensing colleagues scattered in several countries. As an epistemological and anthropological study, an approach has been adopted that goes beyond the opposition between realism and constructivism that has nurtured protracted scholarly controversies over the past decade.5 Throughout the book it will be assumed that scientific and technological objects are both real and historical: real in the sense of pragmatic realism;6 historical in the sense that scientific and technological knowledge and practices are in any case embedded in human culture, as constructivists emphasize.7 Moving to a review of the detailed contents of the book, chapter 1 examines what was distinctive in Volta’s personal, social, and cultural endeavors. His career from amateur to expert, to professor and public servant, is outlined, as are some of the features of his emotional life, his attitude toward religion, and his scientific work. Chapter 2 is a study of the Italian scientific community from 1770–1795, based on a survey of seventy-four natural philosophers active south of the Alps. The aims of the institutional reforms being carried out in the Italian peninsula in the second half of the eighteenth century, and their constraints, are assessed through the testimony of insiders and foreigners. Chapters 3 and 4 review Volta’s contributions to the science of electricity in the 1770s and 1780s. His day-to-day work is reconstructed from a wealth of surviving manuscript notes. His qualities as an investigator are presented as stemming from an adjustment between his ambition to be regarded as a natural philosopher and the more modest role of inventor that some of his colleagues were inclined to assign him. In chapter 4 a detailed discussion of Volta’s techniques, and his reactions to Coulomb’s celebrated memoirs on electricity, is used to outline both the peculiar traits of the “quantifying spirit” Volta subscribed to and the plurality of the strategies that late-eighteenth-century physicists adopted in their pursuit of a quantitative science of electricity. Chapter 5 describes the cosmopolitan network of contacts that Volta developed in his dual role of expert in search of recognition and public servant involved in the imitation-competition game that several governments of Enlightenment Europe played in their well-advertised support of fashionable science. The chapter shows how closely Volta’s assessment of scientific merit, and his choice of foreign experts and\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nscientific institutions from which to expect reward, linked up with his perception of their broad cultural and political leanings. Chapter 6 is a fine-grained study of Volta’s path to the battery. It begins with a detailed discussion of Volta’s reactions to Galvani’s experimental results and interpretations of “animal electricity” in the 1790s. It continues with a description of the sophisticated measuring techniques that Volta developed while engaged in the hunt for “weak” electricity generated by the controversy over galvanism. The chapter concludes with a circumstantial reconstruction, based on Volta’s laboratory notes, of the cognitive and manipulative steps, and expert negotiations, that led Volta to conceive and build the battery in 1799, and announce it to the Royal Society of London in the spring of 1800. This took only a few months once Volta had read a paper by William Nicholson suggesting a method for “imitating the electric fish” (the torpedo) by means of an electrical and mechanical apparatus based on one of Volta’s own earlier machines. The circumstance that the battery (later depicted as a momentous turning point in the history of physics) was the outcome of a program that included the goal of “imitating the electric fish” is used as a cautionary tale against the sort of history of science that prevailed when the disciplinary boundaries imposed by twentieth-century developments oriented the work of historians. A comparative study of the early reception of the voltaic battery in five European countries is developed in chapter 7. It is an essay on how scientific instruments and their interpretations travel across cultural frontiers. It shows how easily simple machines like the voltaic battery could be replicated, and how—easy replication notwithstanding—they could be adopted within widely different research programs, occasionally far removed from the interests and goals pursued by the inventor. The easy replication of the voltaic battery, and its appropriation within different cultural contexts, are discussed as evidence that a revision is needed in the way historians and sociologists have dealt with the issue of replication in scientific practice, and with the role of local cultures and expert knowledge in the production and diffusion of scientific instruments. The revision recommended combines the realist notion that the voltaic batteries built throughout Europe in the early nineteenth century were basically the same apparatus, with the constructivist notion that indeed any expert electrician in Europe could bend the battery to his or her own particular intellectual and social needs. The early reception of the voltaic battery shows that consensus on how the battery worked, and on its implications for natural philosophy, was conspicuously lacking in both expert and amateur circles around Europe in the first few years after the introduction of the new\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\ninstrument. Despite this, experts, amateurs, and even heads of state like general Bonaparte—often informed of Volta’s achievement merely through the daily press—showed themselves able and willing to celebrate the merits of Volta’s contribution to expert knowledge before Europe’s cultivated elites. The mechanisms that regulate the assessment and celebration of scientific and technological achievement among lay audiences are the subject of chapter 8. It explores the ways in which, in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Italy, Volta became a sort of national hero. The chapter shows that some long-established rituals, used to celebrate achievement in general, were easily—and superficially—adapted during the “age of progress” to celebrate scientists and the new technologies. The chapter also shows how, within these celebrating mechanisms, the cultural, social, and political needs of the celebrating people were often imposed on the celebrated hero. The conclusions (chapter 9) offer an overview of the economy of invention emerging from the present study, and its implications for an assessment of the legacies of the Enlightenment. The chapter provides an analysis of the system of values and utilitarian concerns that prepared the shift from the classical and Enlightenment figure of the natural philosopher to the nineteenth-century (and present-day) figure of the scientist. It also shows that, within the broad framework provided by Enlightenment notions like “useful knowledge” and “the quantifying spirit,” several different cultural and research traditions shaped the endeavors of physicists like Volta. Accordingly, the conclusions advocate an interpretation of the history of science and technology that reintroduces those elements of diversity and contingency that the critics of the Enlightenment, and some of its supporters, have removed from their narratives in response to their respective agendas. The supporters of the Enlightenment tradition (to be found more often among scientists, engineers, and philosophers of science) have often been led to remove diversity, and contingency because they wanted to impose a normative conception of science and technology, and their proclaimed rationality. The critics of the Enlightenment (to be found more often among historians and sociologists), on the other hand, have claimed that that same normative view was typical of the Enlightenment in order to expose more easily what they regard as the cynical use, by interested elites, of the prestige of science and technology to enforce an authoritarian view of science, rationality, and social order.\n\n6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe present book argues that neither party has done proper justice to the wealth, diversity, and unpredictability of the intellectual, technological, and social ferment that, under the banner of the vague but compelling Enlightenment notions of useful knowledge and the quantifying spirit, led to the age of electricity, and to our industrial societies.\n\n■\n\n■\n\nt C H A P T E R\n\nO N E\n\nThe Making of a Natural Philosopher F R O M A M AT E U R , T O E X P E R T, T O P U B L I C S E RVA N T\n\nThe present chapter is devoted to a biographical sketch of Alessandro\n\nVolta, a leading figure in the history of the science of electricity during the late Enlightenment and the inventor of the electric battery, focusing on his formative years. Our goal is to pursue the different threads that combined in making up Volta’s personality as an experimental natural philosopher, committed to the ideals of the Enlightenment and involved—as a professor and a public servant—in the reform of the public administration carried out by the enlightened governments of Austrian Lombardy from the 1760s to the 1780s. More information of biographical and contextual interest will be found in the following chapters, especially in chapters 4, 5, and 7. Here we attempt what is both the major challenge and reward of a biographical approach—the search for what was distinctive in the personal, social, and cultural traits that made up Volta’s personality.1 Volta indeed shared several traits in common with the men historian Franco Venturi has depicted in his fascinating, collective portrait of “The Reformers” in Austrian Lombardy in the age of the Enlightenment.2 A cadet from the lesser nobility having no direct control over the mediocre rents he relied on, Volta had been educated for a while by the Jesuits and was soon to become a self-trained adept of Enlightenment philosophy and ideology. With this background and the family connections that offered him aristocratic patronage in Milan and Vienna, he easily qualified to join the expanding ranks of educational experts created by the reform initiatives of Maria Theresa and Joseph II. The first in his family to live on state appointment rather than on private or Church rents, he was throughout his life a committed, motivated professor and public servant. He clearly perceived the fulfillment of his duties as going some way to promote the ideals of the “more enlightened age” to which he felt he belonged. Consistent with\n\n8\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nthis self-ascribed role, he managed to ensure that his latent, unorthodox views on religion, philosophy, and society—views linked to the radical side of Enlightenment culture—did not come to the surface and disrupt his career. Respect for traditional religious, political, and social values thus characterized Volta’s public figure throughout his life, purportedly making of him a typical representative of the moderates among the intellectuals of the age of the Enlightenment. This public image of Volta prevailed among his contemporaries as well as biographers,3 and seemed perfectly in keeping with his chosen field of expertise: the apparently innocuous science of electricity, typically indifferent to the hot religious and political issues debated by the radical philosophes. Though these traits of Volta’s public image were and remain real, the new material on Volta’s education, private life, and career that I have dug out of the archives in his home-town paints a new picture of him, shedding light on other, no less important aspects of his personality and work. The new picture invites a better understanding of what was distinctive of Volta, both as a person and a natural philosopher. These distinctive features, seldom touched upon by previous biographers and discussed in this chapter, can be summed up under three headings. One is the extent of the interior conflict going on beneath the surface of Volta’s smooth, carefully administered public career. As we shall see, the conflict derived from a tension between Volta’s willingness to conform to the social and religious traditions of his group and age, and his inclination to try—in his own private life and experience—the new values and habits proclaimed by the secularized philosophies of the Enlightenment. The conflict between tradition and innovation present in Volta’s own private life invites reflection on the amount of strain the otherwise optimistic goals of moderate Enlightenment carried with them in the people who joined in their realization. The tension between tradition and innovation in Volta’s private life also offers new insights into his scientific personality. It will help us understand what we will describe in the following chapters as his attitude of a “reluctant theorist,” a none-too-convinced adept of the instrumentalist bent of lateeighteenth-century physics. A second, distinctive trait of Volta’s personality, the material discussed in this chapter will help bring out, is the close relationship between his role as an ambitious public servant and his vocation for natural philosophy. This relationship seems to have been fostered, above all, by the entrepreneurial spirit with which Volta pursued his career, both as a scientist and a public servant. For this entrepreneurial spirit—which brought him to develop his contacts and initiatives on a\n\nM A K I N G O F A N AT U R A L P H I L O S O P H E R\n\n9\n\nEuropean scale, as we shall see in chapter 5—he was indebted to the most dynamic among his acquaintances in the aristocratic, merchant, and banking circles of Lombardy. By offering new insights into Volta’s emotional life, finally, this chapter provides grounds for understanding what was perhaps the most distinctive of Volta’s features as an investigator: the exceptional, conceptual, and manipulative skills that he displayed as an inventor of new machines, a brilliant performer of electrical experiments, and a successful lecturer in natural philosophy. As will be pointed out in the following pages, only by uncovering Volta’s rich emotional life can we fully appreciate the traits that made him an extraordinary “virtuoso” in the theory and practice of electricity; an investigator who engaged in his pursuits body and soul, and combined the thrust of the natural philosopher with qualities that remind us of the musicians and skilled artisans of the late eighteenth century with whom he liked to mix in his intense social life.\n\nThe Town Alessandro Volta was twenty-four and had just published his first, ambitious essay “on the attractive force of the electric fire,” when Joseph II, associated with his mother Maria Theresa in the ruling of the Austrian empire including Lombardy, visited the Italian domains.4 It was in June 1769, and the future emperor was shown around Como and its lake, Volta’s birthplace, by the owners of the largest wool factory in town. A report prepared for the occasion5 took pride in stating that the small town of Como (fig. 1.1), situated a few miles from the Swiss and Piedmontese borders, two dozen miles from Milan (the state capital), and counting about 14,000 inhabitants, had 155 silk looms, 25 looms producing wool cloth and serge, 11 producing cotton cloth, 2 producing stockings. The list also mentioned 30 silk mills, 4 dye works, 3 factories producing hats, 4 producing soap, one producing glass, another producing wax, 3 leather tanneries, and 2 printing works. The people employed in factories amounted to 2,570, plus 56 masters. According to a contemporary observer, a survey extended to the entire district of Como—to include the many valleys around the town in easy contact with the rich Lombard plain to the south and with central Europe to the north—reinforced the image of a dynamic region, participating in the modernizing efforts of Maria Theresa and Joseph II.6 The silk factories in particular, traditionally the strong engine of Como’s economy, continued to prosper in the second half of the eighteenth century despite a few ups and downs. The number of silk looms active in and\n\n1.1. Como, ca. 1730.

Though relatively weak in the mountains near Como, agriculture, by far the major source of income in eighteenth-century Lombardy, had been given an impulse by the introduction of a new register of landed property, decreed by Maria Theresa and completed in 1760.8 Reports of the kind prepared in 1769 were clearly intended to please the imperial visitor—who was indeed impressed by Como’s industrious inhabitants—and to kindle municipal pride. Certainly, they depicted only one side to Como’s reality. For example, the family who had the honor of showing the emperor around, the Guaitas, had not yet been given the privilege by their fellow citizens of sitting in the local assembly, still firmly controlled by the nobility to which the Volta family belonged instead. However, a Marta Guaita, married to a local nobleman and public servant, would later become Volta’s mother-inlaw. Members of the Guaita family were merchants in Amsterdam and Brussels, and, as we shall see, were occasionally instrumental in transmitting Volta’s publications to Priestley in England and van Marum in the Netherlands. Because of the aristocratic ties, Volta’s own family connections abroad were more likely to be found around the court of Vienna. The town council of Como, where the Voltas traditionally held a seat, was made up of forty members drawn from the nobility. Since some families had more than one representative on the council (occasionally even five), about two dozen families ran the public affairs of Como. They exercised their power as they had for centuries, effectively resisting the efforts made by successive foreign rulers (the Spanish in the seventeenth century, the Austrians in the next) to curtail their influence.9 Despite the habit of occasionally admitting to the nobility people who had distinguished themselves in the accumulation of wealth (often acquired through commerce) over several generations, the main source of income of the Lombard nobility in the eighteenth century was still land and property revenues. Lifestyle was molded by the rentier habits together with a few other factors. One of these was the involvement of members of the nobility in the system of magistracies, relatively autonomous from the central power, through which the local administration was run. The system occasionally engendered within the nobility a sense of commitment to public service that we shall find well exemplified in Alessandro Volta. Another salient trait of Lombard\n\n12\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nnobility was the way the nobles frequently entered the church or its religious orders. The church was a major social, economic, and cultural factor in Como’s life, the influence of which was only slowly being eroded during Volta’s lifetime by the secularizing measures introduced by Maria Theresa and, above all, by Joseph II from 1780 to 1790. A catalogue (drawn up in 1767) of the clergy living under special rules (clero regolare) listed 25 monasteries and male religious institutions within the district of Como, involving 330 people.10 Gian Domenico Volta, a Dominican and one of Alessandro Volta’s four siblings who entered the church, figured in the catalogue as the person in charge of the church’s inquisition in the region. The 1767 list did not include the common (secolare) clergy, to which two other brothers of Alessandro’s, Luigi and Giovanni, belonged, nor did it include nunneries and other female religious institutions, to which one of the three sisters of Volta’s belonged. Including the common clergy and female institutions, the figures of people serving the church in Como more than doubled the number mentioned in the 1767 catalogue. The chief characteristics of Lombard nobility—its rentier habits, its occasional commitment to public administration through the old system of magistracies, and its frequent service in the church—were all present in Alessandro Volta’s family and helped shape his early life and education.\n\nThe Family Little is known of Volta’s father, Filippo, other than two facts. First, before marrying in 1733, he had joined the Society of Jesus for eleven years,11 and second, after marrying, he was prodigal and, when he died, left his wife and seven surviving children not particularly well off.12 Evidence of Filippo’s prodigality, and a glimpse into the habits of Volta’s family, are offered by the menus which have survived of two sumptuous dinners Filippo organized for his acquaintances in Como on two subsequent weeks during Carnival 1750.13 Alessandro was at that time not yet five. As biographers concur, he did not inherit his father’s lavishness, but he certainly inherited a liking for feasts, especially Carnival celebrations, which was to last well into his adult life. Volta’s father died when Alessandro was still a child, certainly before June 1756.14 After that Alessandro—together with his mother and two sisters, Marianna and Chiara—lived with an uncle (also named Alessandro Volta), who was archdeacon of the Como cathedral. Not much is known of this uncle whom Alessandro, sixteen, depicted as a stepfather.15 The uncle was still alive in 1770, when his canonry was\n\nM A K I N G O F A N AT U R A L P H I L O S O P H E R\n\n13\n\nrecorded as having a rent of 962.6 lire, about 230 lire less than what his nephew would earn four years later as newly appointed state supervisor to the schools of Como.16 Neither the name nor the figure of the father ever emerge in Volta’s extant recollections and correspondence, except on one occasion, when he mentions a small pension left to him by Filippo.17 Volta’s mother, Maddalena Inzaghi, apparently had a similar, indecisive presence in Alessandro’s life. She was from a noble family, members of which lived in Graz.18 Testimonials of past traveling habits of members of the Inzaghi family were passed on to young Volta. As he fondly remembered later in his life—when he himself embarked on frequent European tours—he had spent many evenings as a child by the fireplace listening to an old “father Inzaghi” telling stories of his traveling adventures.19 Though of noble origin, Volta’s mother was not herself rich. After her husband died, she brought up the children acting as a mere mediator in the administration of riches that her sons had inherited from a wealthy relative in 1756. Her seemingly subordinate role is conveyed by a few surviving letters in which she applied to the will executor, in the name of her sons, for more money (and cheese) for approaching festivities.20 Two other episodes suggest that she did not play a major role in Volta’s emotional life. One was the attempt (a failure as it turned out) to enroll Volta, sixteen, in the Jesuit order—an episode (of which more below) she does not seem to have exercised a decisive influence. The other episode reflects, rather, a degree of indifference on the part of her son. Alessandro was just back in Milan after his big European tour of 1781–82, when he learnt that his mother was ill and her life in danger. Instead of rushing the few miles from Milan to Como, he stayed in Milan looking after his affairs there and waiting for further news from home. His mother died a few days later, without seeing her son again.21 The weaker the role played on young Volta by the parents, the stronger were the affective and interest ties linking the “Volta brothers,” as several documents preserved in the notarial archives of Como call them. The phrase referred especially to Luigi and Alessandro who, as beneficiaries (since they were fifteen and eleven, respectively) of the deed of trust from which most of the family’s revenues derived, were the pivots around which the family revolved. Indeed, for a while, till the summer of 1756, Alessandro had enjoyed the privilege of being the appointed, universal heir of the richest of the relatives, uncle Nicolo` Stampa, who had probably chosen Alessandro because he was his youngest male great-nephew.22 On 13 July 1756, however, for reasons that are far from clear, the uncle changed his will and appointed Luigi instead, leaving Alessandro and his male descendants as substitutes in\n\n14\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\ncase Luigi died without issue.23 From the mid-1760s, when Luigi was ordained a priest, the role of Alessandro as the only remaining propagator of the Voltas and, in the end, sole heir to their possessions must have been apparent to young Alessandro himself and relatives. Yet, until he married at forty-nine and secured from his elder brother Luigi—on marrying—half of the rents stemming from the Stampa heritage,24 Alessandro occupied a subordinate position in family affairs, a fact which often affected his decisions as documented by several episodes reported below.\n\nLifestyle The inheritance of the Volta brothers allowed them to enjoy the rents and leisure offered by some nine different houses and small estates scattered across the provinces of Como and Milan,25 plus the old family house in Como and, very likely, a number of minor properties in town. While these properties taken together did not place the Voltas beyond the rank of the lesser nobility, they did allow them to enjoy or, at any rate, imitate as closely as possible the lifestyle of Lombard nobility. The Voltas spent a long part of the year, from springtime to November, touring the family properties, each of which had its own special attraction depending on the season. The hottest months were spent in Gravedona, a spot by the lake north of Como. Campora was preferred with the coming of autumn when walking and hunting in the woods and mountains nearby was rewarding. As winter approached, Lazzate, a populous village on the plain near Milan, offered better opportunities for leisure. Despite the many estates and the touring habits, daily life in the family was unpretentious. Otium was the keynote and habits were affected by the large number of priests in and around the family. Volta often recalled later how family life was spent amid masses, card games, and glasses of wine. In the only surviving letter to his mother, written from Aix-la-Chappelle in November 1781, Alessandro depicted the family life at home in the following terms: By the time you receive this letter, my brothers will be perhaps in Gravedona, the holidays in Campora being over. You’ve probably had the usual company of priests; so I am sure that, to pass the rainy days, a good deal of time must have been spent at mass, tarots, breviaries and glasses of wine.26\n\nA degree of impatience with the closeted family routine emerges in Volta’s correspondence from time to time, and from childhood he displayed a determination to break with that routine. His early literary\n\nM A K I N G O F A N AT U R A L P H I L O S O P H E R\n\n15\n\nambitions, as we shall see, expressed his desire to imitate the habits of the upper nobility and to adopt the cultural models of the cosmopolitan Republic of Letters. Similar impatience with the narrowness of the family milieu was revealed in his early scientific efforts, which led him to approach the leading authorities of the day in the field of electricity when he was not yet eighteen, and still imperfectly trained. The eagerness he displayed as an adult in cultivating the rich and powerful probably had its roots in that same drive. As we shall see, in Volta ambition mingled with restlessness and a tendency to lean toward unorthodox views and behavior. His formal adhesion to Catholicism throughout his life cohabited with a partial, deep-seated predilection for unorthodox views. Also, his determination—in the end repressed—to make what was regarded as an unconventional marriage revealed his potential inclination to break with conventions. However, in keeping with one of his personality traits that we shall become acquainted with, he never allowed his impatience with sheltered family life and orthodox views to spill over into contempt, much less revolt. Apparently, the urge to imitate different cultural models and the determination not to break with his own roots were both embedded in the education he received.\n\nEducation Apart from a few recorded episodes, direct evidence of Volta’s education is scanty. From surviving correspondence we know for certain that, at fifteen, he attended as a boarder the Jesuit College of Como.27 It is also known that in the following year he moved, still as a boarder, to one of the three seminaries in town.28 Apparently, no records of the students at these institutions during the 1750s and 1760s have been preserved: the information on this part of Volta’s education is therefore indirect. Volta’s early education must have been imparted at home. This was common at the time. Volta himself, in his later role as superintendent to the public schools in Como, suggested that this habit should be tolerated if not encouraged by the state. He himself, as a father, would devote considerable energy in personally seeing to the education of his children. Young Volta, living as he did in the house of an uncle who is said to have studied either law or medicine, and who enjoyed the none-too-busy life of a canon in Como’s cathedral, may have received some basic education from that uncle, who was fifty-nine when he was ten. Where needed, additional instruction was probably provided by some of the many priests with whom the family was in touch.\n\n16\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nIndeed, before the reforms carried out by Maria Theresa and Joseph II after 1765 paved the way for the introduction of lay teachers appointed by the state, elementary education in Lombardy was overwhelmingly the preserve of priests. Priests made up the great majority of teachers running the small elementary schools scattered in and around the towns, supported by funds coming from the wills of donors who had left part of their wealth to the church for just such a purpose.29 The quality of the teaching in these schools was decidedly uneven. Learning to read and write first in Latin and then in Italian was their basic goal, a goal that was not always achieved. Teaching to count was often the business of different schools, which taught the arithmetic needed by merchants, and which, according to a later survey commissioned by the state, were found to be of good quality.30 In the light of the comparatively good level of instruction available to Volta at home, and the uneven quality of elementary instruction offered by the schools in Como, it was probably a good thing for Volta to have had his early education in the family until he entered the local Jesuit College. A biographer who had access to family documents now apparently lost, writes that Volta entered Como’s Jesuit College in 1758 to attend the “rhetoric” classes, and subsequently, in 1760, the “philosophy” course which other extant evidence shows he actually attended.31 Como’s Jesuit College, established in 1561, was a relatively small institution. When Volta completed his first “philosophy” year in July 1761, the staff running the college comprised ten people. The institution was devoted to education only, which meant teaching “in genere Pueros, et in specie Logicam seu Philosophiam, quod prestat addita etiam titulo charitatis Theologia Morali, et Speculativa.”32 In the Jesuit curriculum typical of the eighteenth century, “rhetoric” was a third-year course, following those devoted to “grammar” and “humanity,” and based on the teaching of (mainly Latin) oratoria and poetry. In the same context, “philosophy” meant a two- to three-year course for students between sixteen and nineteen, followed by a theology course. The philosophy course included, in addition to classical Aristotelian philosophy, a substantial amount of natural philosophy and physics in the modern sense. The larger Jesuit colleges had a special professor in physics.33 When no such professor existed, the philosophy professor took charge, as was the case at the college in Como where the philosophy professor was a certain Girolamo Bonesi.34 For reasons connected to what appeared for a time to be Volta’s inclination to join the Society of Jesus, a special relationship developed between the philosophy professor and young Alessandro. No detailed evidence survives of how Volta was taught philosophy in college. We know for certain only that during the summer holidays\n\nM A K I N G O F A N AT U R A L P H I L O S O P H E R\n\n17\n\nof 1761 Bonesi passed on to Volta some manuscript lectures on “animastics,” that is, psychology, to be copied. Volta must have taken a deep interest in the subject if a friend of his was right in recalling, several years later, that Volta at sixteen had his own special view on a controversial issue: he believed that animals too had a soul, conceived of as a true spiritual substance.35 The issue was much debated at the time. Volta’s stance was unorthodox enough to scandalize his more conventional friend. This same friend many years later (when Volta had gained celebrity) attributed to young Volta the authorship of eleven (lost) manuscript notebooks on the same topic, which he had donated to his friend.36 The notebooks might well have been a copy with comments of the lecture notes Bonesi had given Volta; or they might indeed have been more than that if we accept the friend’s story that Volta, years later—during the French revolutionary era—searched for his friend in vain to get them back. Animastics was usually taught during the second year of the philosophy course. In the first year—the one attended by Volta in 1760–61— the typical curriculum provided for the teaching of “Logic and Introduction to Physics.” This meant “the first and second books of Aristotle’s De interpretatione, mostly in summary; first notions of science: its divisions, abstractions, theories, practices; the diverse methods of proceeding in physics and mathematics.”37 In the absence of more direct evidence of the kind of teaching the College of Como provided in these fields, additional evidence can be evinced from the books kept in the college library. The library shows that, despite the provincial setting, the Jesuit College in Como had a respectable tradition in the teaching of physics. A catalogue drawn up in 1774 (at the request of a committee that Volta was a member of, after the Society of Jesus had been suppressed) shows that the college had accumulated, since its foundation, a number of interesting classics of science for its library.38 These included Lucretius’s De rerum natura and seventeenth-century authors like Galileo, Descartes, Borelli, Cavalieri, Riccioli, and Cabeo. Eighteenth-century textbooks included Musschenbroek, Nollet, and Gravesande. Recent works by Boscovich, Frisi, and Jacopo Riccati were also in their possession. A treatise on electricity by Giambatista Beccaria, whom young Volta chose as mentor in his early scientific correspondence, was held, in two copies, in the college library. This latter also held a set of the proceedings of the Turin Academy of Sciences, which included recent, first-rate papers on mathematics and physics. There is no way of ascertaining how much or how little of the books kept in the college library were available to the average philosophy student. Their presence, however, suggests that some of\n\n18\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nthe college professors took a real interest in the teaching of science as part of the philosophy course. By the summer of 1761 Volta, sixteen, had acquired a nonephemeral interest in philosophy. When his family mooted the possibility of taking him from the Jesuit College to enroll him in the law courses provided by the local Collegio de’ Dottori—a college intended for members of the aristocracy aspiring to the magistracies—he put up resistance, inclined as he was to continue philosophy instead.39 In the summer of 1761 Volta’s predilection for simple toy tools is also documented. When relatives found in his pockets a penitence chain the Jesuit philosophy professor had secretly given him to test his religious calling, the chain was easily taken for one of the iron tools young Volta was often seen playing with.40 Since the chain was a common sort of device for electrical experiments of the time, it is tempting to speculate that Volta was experimenting on electricity already in 1761. However, there is no need to speculate too much on the date of his early interest in the subject; in a couple of years he startled contemporaries by directly addressing two of the leading authorities on electricity, Nollet and Beccaria. In the autumn of 1761 Volta was taken from the Jesuit College to avoid what relatives viewed as a conspiracy by the philosophy professor to make him join the Society of Jesus. As mentioned, young Volta had a hand in deciding his own future: he was not sent to study law, as relatives and especially uncle Alessandro wished, but to an institution offering a curriculum not too dissimilar from the one taught by the Jesuits. This was a seminary—we do not know for certain whether that of Santa Caterina or another called Seminary Benzi, run by the common clergy—hosting also boarders who did not intend to pursue a career in the church. As in the case of the Jesuit College, no record of Volta’s presence as a student in one of the two seminaries has survived. We know that the seminary of Santa Caterina in the 1760s had teachers of grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, and dogmatics.41 As regards the teaching of philosophy and science, the books kept in the library of the seminary of Santa Caterina suggest that teaching levels in the seminaries were inferior to those of the Jesuits. Philosophy was represented almost exclusively by compendia, and science was hardly represented at all, apart from ten books on practical medicine.42 Volta, however, may have benefited in those years from resources of another library to which he very likely had access, and which—as a superintendent to the schools in Como—he commended a few years later: the library of the Collegio de’ Dottori. Though devoted mainly to the teaching of civil and canon law, this college also kept in its library books of scien-\n\nM A K I N G O F A N AT U R A L P H I L O S O P H E R\n\n19\n\ntific interest, including the collection of the Commentarii of the Bologna Academy of Sciences.43 In sustaining Volta’s interest in natural philosophy during these years, an informal network of acquaintances and friends must have been no less influential than the formal curriculum Volta was pursuing as a student. Among Volta’s acquaintances, Giulio Cesare Gattoni played a particularly important role. Gattoni—the friend who did not share Volta’s belief that animals too had a soul—had also been trained by the Jesuits and stayed on at the college when Volta left, eventually becoming a canon. Slightly older than Volta, a generous, eclectic and somewhat extravagant character, Gattoni took an interest in every curious topic he came across, including electricity, all of which he shared with his friend. The major achievements of Gattoni were the setting up of the first lightning rod in Como in 1768, and a collection of natural and antiquarian objects that earned him some renown.44 Gattoni was not the only one of Volta’s early acquaintances having a penchant for natural philosophy. Throughout Volta’s biography one comes across several amateur philosophers among the array of aristocrats, canons, and intellectuals he knew in and around Como. Among such amateurs an interest for natural philosophy merged with an often stronger interest in literature, especially poetry, an interest nurtured by the persistent tradition of Arcadian groups of poets. For a long while Volta too paid homage to that tradition: it is no coincidence that the first document we have of Volta’s views on natural philosophy is a poetical composition, written in Latin. The tone of the composition, however, places it at a considerable distance from the lyric mood of Arcadia, and close to the scientific and technological spirit of the Enlightenment.\n\n“A More Enlightened Age” Volta’s first known literary composition, part in prose and the rest in 492 verses, bears no title or date.45 It is usually ascribed to the early 1760s, perhaps between 1762 and 1764, when Volta—about eighteen— also started up his scientific correspondence. The composition is inspired by classical models like Virgil, and especially by Lucretius’s De rerum natura, from which several verses are taken almost verbatim. The genre is that of the didactic poem—the earliest form of science popularization—conceived in the light of a motto from Torquato Tasso: “truth dispensed in soft verses has persuaded through allurement even the most reluctant.”46 Another likely inducement that led Volta to tackle scientific issues in verse was a statement by Francesco Algarotti,\n\n20\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nin his well-known dialogues on Newton’s Opticks, to the effect that the exact sciences could hardly be treated in verse.47 The challenge to prove the successful Algarotti wrong on this point must have stimulated the ambition of young Volta. The topics treated in Volta’s composition were “the newest discoveries of recent philosophers.” To young Volta, contemporary natural philosophers appeared as the heralds of a new, enlightened age. The notion of a “clarior,” “sapientior aetas” recurs time and again in the poem, coupled with the notion that the new age is exploding “blind superstition” and the “people’s deliria” of old times.48 The intellectual and moral ingredients of the new philosophy exalted by Volta were in fact a combination of classical Lucretian and Enlightenment ideals. The most revered of human gifts were “acumen of reason” (rationis acumen) and “understanding” (ingenium), but also “virtue” (virtus) and “fortune” (fortuna). The secular theme of “fortune” was linked to Volta’s other remark, that creativity itself, as displayed in the achievements of the new philosophy, was not a divine gift.49 The main goal pursued throughout the poem was to offer rational explanations for phenomena usually regarded as wonderful and frightening, such as gunpowder, fulminating gold, fireworks, and willo’-the-wisp. The conceptual framework adopted was that of corpuscularism, to which the notion of an “attractive force” was added in phrases suggesting that the author’s commitment to the notion was lukewarm. All the phenomena dealt with were explained basically in terms of atoms and void, by arguing that bodies contained different amounts of “elementa ignis” (elements of fire) depending on their different textures. The particles of fire contained in bodies were deemed to account for the explosions and other reactions typical of the phenomena described.50 Rational explanations and theories, in any case, were not the only themes pursued by Volta in his juvenile poem. He clearly liked the actual procedures required to carry out the experiments. The vividness of his descriptions leaves no doubt that he tried some of the experiments himself, especially those of a chemical nature, and those carried out with the air pump. He must also have observed the uses of gunpowder in mines, probably in the quarries on the mountains near Como. The art of blowing glass, in the glassworks in town or in and around Milan, must also have been known to him.51 Indeed, the useful arts had pride of place in the poem, another homage young Volta paid to the enlightened age he was proud to belong to. The “philosophers” Volta cited explicitly had all dealt at some time with electricity—von Guericke, Gray, Dufay, Musschenbroek, Nollet, Franklin, Delor, Dalibard, and Beccaria. However, in the poem he\n\nM A K I N G O F A N AT U R A L P H I L O S O P H E R\n\n21\n\ntouched upon electricity only to remark that the topic was so important that he planned to devote another, special poem to it.52 Of this other composition nothing else is known. In the extant poem, however, Volta ascribed to the science of electricity a key role in his portrait of the age of reason. He maintained that, by showing that lightning was an electrical phenomenon, not caused by sulphur or by element of fire as Lucretius and many others had believed since antiquity, modern philosophers had demonstrated their superior understanding. The science of electricity, Franklin’s special achievements, and the recurrent theme of “a more enlightened age” were all knit together in the rhetoric of the following verses: Fire often ignites itself in fat matters even without any spark being brought to them, and the luminous globes of the flames develop spontaneously: not otherwise the ancients and many among recent authors deemed when teaching that burning meteors derive from a sulphurous disposition. Lightning too was believed to have such an origin; yet wrongly so, because since a more enlightened age has shone, and new arts have been disclosed to the geniuses of our times, how transformed the face of Sophia has turned out from then!53\n\nIf Franklin had rebutted Lucretius on the cause of lightning, young Volta clearly saw Franklin’s electrical explanation of lightning as yet another step in the Lucretian fight for freeing humanity from superstition. Classical natural philosophy and the spirit of the Enlightenment merged in the secularized mind of the former pupil of the Jesuits who was turning natural philosopher.\n\nLiterary Interests Volta’s literary interests were not confined to scientific, didactic verse. As he wrote in 1768 to the Swiss poet Salomon Gessner, one of his early foreign correspondents, he was “fond of everything poetic.”54 Among Italian poets Volta especially enjoyed Tasso, Chiabrera, Frugoni, Metastasio, and Parini. Among foreign poets he admired John Milton, whose Paradise Lost he first read in French translation; Edward Young, whose Night Thoughts he would strongly recommend when superintendent at the schools in Como; and Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. Volta also liked Gessner’s poetry, and especially his epic poem The Death of Abel.55 If scientific prose and epic poetry were one favorite, oratory, classical and modern, was another. Among classical authors Cicero was the most beloved and unreservedly commended. Among contemporaries, Volta\n\n22\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nhad particular regard for Francesco Algarotti and Giovanni Battista Roberti, a Jesuit and polymath. Tragedy also appealed to Volta. Together with French scientific prose, French tragic authors such as Racine and Corneille encouraged young Volta to learn French. Volta’s life in Como was also conducive to a lighter genre of literature. Several of Volta’s extant poetical compositions were of an occasional nature: their ambition did not go beyond the celebration of a wedding, or a ceremony for a woman becoming a nun.56 Volta enjoyed writing poetry throughout his life. To celebrate De Saussure’s climbing of Mount Blanc in 1787, he wrote a 199-verse composition.57 It conveyed effectively (though in unconvincing poetic style) Volta’s view of science: the achievements of contemporary natural philosophy, as he saw them, were indissolubly part of culture, just as poetry was. Indeed, he regarded recent natural philosophy as the greatest contribution his age could make to the universalistic culture he had assimilated through classic and modern literature. The growing ambition of contemporary natural philosophy was perceived within Volta’s circle of friends, including those who were mainly interested in literature. Count Giovio, a lifelong friend of Volta’s, paid homage to the new figure of the natural philosopher (“the physicists”) in the following terms: We will not renounce being physicists either, even if there are no barometers or thermometers clanging round our necks. We will not completely forget those special words, like granite, limestone, . . . and we too will build the world as we please, [by evoking] . . . memories of Moses, phials of inflammable air, electric bursts, and the modern airs.58\n\nTogether with an amount of jealousy on the part of the “letterato” toward the successful physicist, Giovio’s homage revealed that in Volta’s circle of friends natural philosophy was fashionable: any decent “letterato” felt he had to be conversant with its concepts, vocabulary, and rituals.\n\nViews on Religion and Secularization Volta’s upbringing and family life exposed him to religion in all its forms, affecting his sensibility, formal practice, and his philosophical and theological thinking. The orthodox part of his religious education probably culminated with the reading of Imitatio Christi, the classic devotional book attributed to Thomas a` Kempis, which the Jesuit philosophy professor lent him during the summer of 1761.59 Volta enjoyed the book. For a while, the professor hoped that he had won his young\n\nM A K I N G O F A N AT U R A L P H I L O S O P H E R\n\n23\n\npupil over to the Jesuits, and the Voltas feared that the boy was set to join the Society of Jesus.60 The fears of the relatives were partly caused by the vicissitudes the Jesuits underwent after their recent expulsion from several European states. Other fears must have risen in the family from concerns about the destiny of the riches they enjoyed as a result of the 1756 deed of trust, should even Alessandro fail to marry and leave male descendants as the deed required. To these mundane concerns, others of a philosophical nature accrued in the mind of young Alessandro himself. Some unorthodox views sprang from his reflection on the very philosophy he had been taught at the Jesuit College. The part of the philosophy course devoted to animastics, as previously mentioned, led young Volta to believe that animals too had a soul. As for physics, the orthodox Aristotelian philosophy to which he had been exposed did not prevent him from adopting a thoroughly Democritean worldview, documented by the poem discussed above. Nor was this adhesion to a materialistic philosophy a short-lived, juvenile departure from orthodoxy: Volta subscribed to a similar brand of philosophy well into his thirties. In 1777, while crossing the Alps on his first trip abroad, he reflected upon the theories of the earth put forward by Buffon and other naturalists.61 In his report Volta repeatedly mentioned the “extreme old age of our planet,” the “unending long series of centuries, hardly conceivable to the mind,” necessary for the Alps to have attained their present, grandiosely ruined shapes. As for the factors involved in the making and transforming of mountains, Volta referred both to successive, violent, natural events or “convulsions,” and to slow, gradual changes over time. Volcanic phenomena, earthquakes, and natural elements were all he had recourse to in his simple geology.62 He made no mention of the flood, nor of events reminiscent of the Bible. A similar worldview is sketched out in a juvenile fragment, written by Volta in French, containing reflections on a prima facie theological topic: the resurrection of bodies. The fragment, conceived as a letter to an unnamed “Rev[erend] Pe`re,” purports to explore the views expressed on resurrection by Charles Bonnet and Leibniz, and claims to accept an explanation closer to the Revelation than Bonnet’s.63 Here Volta indeed adopted a chronology compatible with the Bible, which he had not mentioned in his report of the 1777 trip across the Alps. In fact, in the undated fragment he outlined a Stahlian theory of the perennial cycle of life, a theory, he said, he had conceived well before reading Bonnet.64 In the fragment Volta assumes, with Buffon, that living matter cannot originate from inanimate matter. He further assumes with Stahl that\n\n24\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nhuman beings, like animals and vegetables, ultimately derive the matter they are made of and their means of subsistence from other human beings, as well as from animals and plants. As Volta puts it, the same living matter or substance is “common to a tree and an animal,” it moves from “living machine” to “living machine,” it gets dispersed and is united again in thousands of different shapes. Being the same basic substance, it has the appearances of everything that grows, vegetates, and embellishes this globe. The same measure of matter is “at once tulip, eagle, apple, caterpillar, dog, man!” Having posited this, Volta then asked himself what initial amount of living substance was needed to account for all the living beings (vegetables, animals, and humans) “from the first days since the Creation” until the end of the world. Would an original layer of vegetable matter, a hundred feet deep and covering the earth, suffice to account for the “milliard human bodies” involved? It would be able to, Volta argued, if one admitted—as he was inclined to—that the same amount of matter had contributed to the subsequent making of numberless different bodies. There was a difficulty with humans, however, since revelation required that each human being is resurrected from his or her own special body. To solve the dilemma Volta introduced what he regarded as an argument taken from, or compatible with, Leibniz’s philosophy. Unfortunately, because the fragment ends abruptly we do not have Volta’s detailed argument.65 Whatever the conclusions he might have drawn, it is clear that Volta, in the 1760s and 1770s, was well versed in the mid-eighteenth-century literature circulated by the philosophes. He was eager especially to submit religious issues to the tests provided by recent speculations on the earth’s history, nature’s equilibrium, and the endless number of forms inanimate and living beings have assumed in the course of time. If a connecting thread can be found in the fragmented evidence available, one might say that Volta, in the 1770s, continued in the same Lucretian mood documented in the poem he composed in the early 1760s. But how did all this fit in with Volta’s own commitment to the Catholic religion in which he had grown up? A guarded wariness in disclosing his personal attitude toward religion remained a constant preoccupation with Volta throughout his life. The only extant, public reference to his early departure from Christianity and adhesion to the “materialistic philosophies” of the eighteenth century is the report of a conversation he had late in his life, sometime between 1814 and 1820, with a younger friend. The piece was published only after Volta’s death, in 1834. The report took the form of a poetical composition, simulating a dialogue with Volta.66 During the conversation both the interviewer (the friend, Silvio Pellico) and the interviewed (Volta) displayed eagerness to denounce their own earlier\n\nM A K I N G O F A N AT U R A L P H I L O S O P H E R\n\n25\n\ndisbelief. The “interview”—considering the peculiar circumstances— confirms that Volta adhered to the secularized views of the philosophes during an earlier part of his adult life. Despite the formal homage Volta always paid to Catholic religious practice, rumors about his unorthodox views occasionally circulated during his lifetime. Not surprisingly, suspicion spread during the troubled French revolutionary and Napoleonic periods, Volta’s extremely cautious public demeanor notwithstanding. The need to dispel such suspicion befell him soon after the restoration of Austrian power in Lombardy in 1815. The episode is documented by a declaration Volta wrote on his own religious views in that same year.67 The declaration, apparently, had been requested by a canon, Giacomo Ciceri, some time before January 1815. The timing of the request speaks for itself: the era of French influence in the affairs of Lombardy had then come to an end, and it was common practice to scrutinize the conduct of public figures from the past regime. What is more, a few months earlier the restored Austrian authorities had nominated Volta head of the Philosophy Faculty at the University of Pavia, in spite of the well-known rewards he had obtained from Napoleon. The envy of some colleagues may well have stimulated Canon Ciceri’s curiosity about Volta’s religious views. It does not come as a surprise, given the circumstances, that the 1815 declaration affirms the orthodoxy of its author. Writing the declaration, however, was a troublesome process, as the revisions in the minutes display. After second thoughts, Volta added a sentence mentioning not only his sins (as any Christian would), but also his “disorders,” which may allude both to the philosophical doubts confessed in the interview with Pellico, and to the many love affairs which marked the first, unwed half of Volta’s life. In any case, the most likely source of the suspicions surrounding Volta’s views on religion was neither his adhesion to secularized natural philosophy nor his private life but, rather, the stance he took in the 1780s and 1790s on the controversial issue of the relationship between church and state—a stance some judged to be too favorable to the state to be inspired by genuine Catholic belief. As a professor at the University of Pavia from 1778, Volta became acquainted with several leading figures of Italian Jansenism active in the university, who supported an evangelical reawakening within the church. Volta’s correspondence testifies that, during the last two decades of the century, he was on friendly terms with Pietro Tamburini and Giuseppe Zola, professors of moral theology and church history in Pavia, whose Jansenist inclinations were well known both in Italy and abroad.68 Their teachings, and their presence in the leading educational\n\n26\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\ncenter of Austrian Lombardy, were in keeping with the policy of Joseph II of asserting the right of the state to regulate all religious matters affecting public administration and life. Because of a similar policy, in the years immediately preceding the French Revolution, Jansenist theologians enjoyed the support of Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany. That Volta subscribed to a secularized view of the relationship between church and state is documented by many statements in his correspondence, especially in the letters written to his brother, archdeacon Luigi, in the wake of the 1790 oath imposed on the clergy by the National Assembly in France.69 A further testimony to Volta’s stance is offered by his friend Gattoni, who reports having had heated discussions on the topic with Volta in those same years. The contrast led to a temporary suspension of their friendship. Gattoni, a conservative Catholic, attributed Volta’s secularized view of the rights of the state vis-a`-vis the church to the influence of his Jansenist acquaintances in Pavia.70 On that same ground, a generally accurate biographer has credited Volta with adhesion—albeit temporary and mild—to the theological tenets of Jansenism.71 That rumors of Volta’s leanings toward Jansenism continued to circulate in Como seems to be confirmed by a sentence in Volta’s 1815 declaration on religion where Volta found it appropriate to assert that, while believing in the importance of grace for salvation, he also believed in the role of “good actions,” as if explicitly rejecting the Jansenist notion that divine grace alone can save humans.72 Apart from the rumors, however, there is no direct evidence of Volta’s adhesion to the strict theological principles of Jansenism. If we are to believe a perceptive contemporary observer, Marsilio Landriani, the speculations on Volta’s Jansenism were of a limited circulation. Writing to Volta from Vienna in May 1800, Landriani declared that Volta was not regarded as a Jansenist there unlike many other professors in Pavia.73 What has been surmised as Volta’s Jansenist inclinations would probably be better explained by two facts, only partly related to Jansenism. One was his already mentioned support for the policy of restraint over the power of the church adopted in Austrian Lombardy and in certain Catholic countries at the time. He found this policy consistent with his own ideal of an efficient and independent public administration. The second fact was Volta’s deep admiration for the civic and intellectual achievements of Protestant countries, several of which he toured on different occasions, and to which—having lived most of his life a few miles from the Swiss border—he felt intellectually and geographically close. The reports he wrote of his journeys (on which more in chapter 5) bear abundant evidence of his admiration for Protestant countries. He regarded them as more populous and more active\n\n27\n\nM A K I N G O F A N AT U R A L P H I L O S O P H E R 74\n\nin commerce and intellectual pursuits than Catholic countries. In line with a trait in his personality we shall come across often, Volta found it relatively easy to reconcile his support of the state against the church, and his admiration for non-Catholic countries with a formal, occasionally sceptical, but substantive commitment to the Catholic religion of his family and country. The most spontaneous expression of Volta’s religiosity is probably the one contained in a letter written when he was forty-five. The letter was addressed to his brother, the archdeacon, during the bitter conflicts Volta had with his family over his intention (later renounced) to make an unconventional marriage. To his brother—who urged him to think again—Volta replied that “a dejected mind and an upset heart” are hardly compatible with acceptance of the maxims of Christianity, while an unconventional marriage dictated by genuine sentiment could be. In order to perceive and pursue “the great, eternal truths” of religion, Volta argued, humans must reflect upon them “with a calm mind and a peaceful heart.”75 These words offer perhaps the best portrait of the tolerant, benign religiosity—the basic ingredients of which were an implicit appeal to natural law and a blend of classical stoicism and indulgent Christianity—to which Volta subscribed throughout his life. Apparently, he found this religiosity compatible with several tenets of the secularized philosophies of the Enlightenment, to which he also subscribed.\n\nFrom Amateur, to Expert, to Public Servant Volta’s poetical composition of the early 1760s bears witness to the early development of the natural philosopher. As shown, the premises for that development came partly from the teaching Volta had received at the Jesuit College, partly from his self-taught training in the classical, especially Lucretian, tradition, and they were further stimulated by a reading of seventeenth-century authors, who had convinced him of corpuscularism as an overall worldview. A further, decisive impulse came from his reading of a handful of classics from eighteenth-century physics, notably Newton, Musschenbroek, Dufay, Nollet, Franklin, and Beccaria. In an age and society where an amateur interest in natural philosophy was fashionable—just as literature and music had been for centuries—Volta’s early amateur interest in natural philosophy does not require a special explanation. What does require explanation is his decision to get in touch with the experts in the field, a decision that was taken in 1763.\n\n28\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThe letters that Volta, barely eighteen, sent to Nollet and Beccaria in 1763 have not been preserved, but their very existence and a few surviving excerpts are significant on several counts.76 The letter to Beccaria, for sure, was more than an aperc¸u: Volta called it “a bulky scribbling-pad.”77 From later allusions, both letters must have contained an ambitious, attractionist theory encompassing all electrical phenomena explained by analogy with the phenomena of magnetism. The amount of daring implicit in addressing leading figures such as Nollet and Beccaria—without credentials of any kind or, apparently, any personal connections—may well be explained by certain traits in young Volta’s personality, which he himself described in a later letter to Beccaria. These traits were—in the self-deprecating terms he used to win Beccaria’s sympathy—“fickleness” and an inclination toward “whimsical” and “childish reasoning.”78 More is needed, however, to explain how the eighteen-year-old Volta was already constructing his own system for the entire science of electricity and trying to obtain recognition as an expert. Why—having been educated in a tradition of amateur philosophers and living in a world of amateurs—did Volta want to become an expert? And why did he choose physics as his special field of expertise? As an ambitious cadet from the lesser nobility, who had eschewed the possibility of entering the church and had no direct control over the income he lived on, young Volta was clearly in need of cultural and social recognition. To be known as a natural philosopher—not just as one of the many “letterati” the Italian provinces were overflowing with—gave him a well-defined, little-contested role in Como, and one which would eventually earn him renown beyond the confines of the provincial setting and lesser nobility which stifled him. Literature and poetry also satisfied, to some extent, similar goals of cultural and social recognition, and indeed young Volta tried them too. Yet, the kind of rational, secularized worldview the new physics offered was a more complete expression of the ideology of a “more enlightened age” to which young Volta adhered. Electricity, on the other hand, unlike discussions over the soul of animals or the age of the earth, allowed no room for controversy over religious issues, in which Volta knew how to indulge, but he was also learning to eschew. After several attempts at establishing a regular scientific correspondence frustrated by Beccaria (who in one case delayed his answer for about one year), in 1765 Volta finally obtained almost regular answers to the letters he kept sending to the dean of Italian electricians, twentynine years older than himself. By the end of 1766 the notoriously difficult Beccaria had decided to afford the young Volta a degree of cautious esteem and sent him offprints of a paper of his published in the\n\nM A K I N G O F A N AT U R A L P H I L O S O P H E R 79\n\n29\n\nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. By June 1767 Volta felt daring enough to close his latest letter to Beccaria with a sentence stating that the letter did not, after all, require an answer.80 In September of the same year Nollet—who had answered politely though skeptically to Volta’s earlier letters—wrote again and sent Volta a little book as a present.81 In 1768 Volta wrote again to both Nollet and Beccaria, illustrating his views on how electrical repulsion could be explained in terms of attraction. By that time Volta must have been working on the treatise in Latin that he published on 18 April 1769 in Como, under the form of a letter addressed to Beccaria entitled De vi attractiva ignis electrici (On the attractive force of the electric fire).82 The content of Volta’s first publication and the mixed reviews it received are discussed in chapter 3. Suffice it to say here that the dedication to Beccaria did not make the reception of Volta’s opera prima any easier. This fact, and the plans under way for relaunching the University of Pavia, reoriented Volta’s ambitions. He dedicated his next publication in 1771, still on electricity, to naturalist Lazzaro Spallanzani.83 Spallanzani—himself not an expert in electricity—had been recently appointed to the chair of natural history at Pavia. By choosing Spallanzani as his new patron, young Volta had shifted his target from a foreign (Piedmontese) scholar like Beccaria, and an authority in his own field, to a national patron from outside his field. The shift was connected with Volta’s new ambition to become not just an expert but a professor too. In that same year, 1771, Volta learnt that the support of political patrons was no less important than the esteem of senior scholars in order to join the system of public education being established in Lombardy under Austrian rule. It was yet another scholar, Paolo Frisi—an engineer and astronomer engaged in state committees carrying out the reforms endorsed by Maria Theresa and Joseph II—who first pointed out to young Volta what kind of patrons he would need if he was to obtain public office.84 As a consequence, in the summer of 1771, Volta turned to the secretary of the Italian Department in Vienna, Joseph Sperges, and to Carlo di Firmian, Austria’s plenipotentiary minister in Milan.85 Frisi himself took it upon himself to approach, on behalf of Volta, Gian Rinaldo Carli, who had presided over the Supremo Consiglio di Economia—a key organ of the reforming policy in Milan—in previous years. Carli, like Boscovich and Frisi, was a former natural philosopher turned public servant: until 1765 he had taught astronomy at the University of Padua. Later, while presiding over the above mentioned committee, he had studied a plan for the reform of the University of Pavia in the fields of philosophy, mathematics, and physics.\n\n30\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThus, around 1770 Volta begun to consider the prospect of joining a second generation of experts in astronomy, physics, and mathematics—after the generation of scholars like Boscovich, Carli, and Frisi— seeking employment in the reformed Austrian administration of Lombardy. When Volta entered the scene, opportunities were slowly opening up, and physics was benefiting from the situation. Outlining a reform of the University of Pavia circa 1770, Frisi, while paying homage to the tradition that still regarded physics as a topic intended for the medical curriculum, cautiously suggested that there might be two, rather than one, chairs in the field: one for “general physics,” another for “experimental physics.”86 Considering that the plan foresaw twenty-two chairs for the whole range of disciplines taught in the university (including the faculties of law, medicine, theology, and mathematics), prospects seemed promising for physicists. The other Lombard center for higher learning, the Scuole Palatine in the Brera Palace in Milan, was also living with the feeling, occasionally the reality, of expansion. In the Palace of Brera, including also the Sant’Alessandro Schools, it was possible to learn logic, metaphysics, physics, theology, ethics, geometry, and astronomy at university level, though no university degrees were awarded. From 1764 the construction of a new astronomical observatory was begun in Brera under the supervision of Boscovich for the Jesuits who ran the Scuole Palatine until the suppression of the Society in 1773. Frisi thought that, for the time being, science teaching should be left to develop in Pavia, while Milan would continue to have its chair of mathematics. But he let it be understood that, once the go-ahead for expansion in Pavia had been secured from the government, plans were afoot for the expansion of science teaching in Milan as well.87 Frisi warned, however, that expansion continued to be threatened by the low number of students enrolling in institutions of higher education, especially Pavia. Measures aimed at making a university degree compulsory for certain professions were seen as a prerequisite necessary for ensuring that expansion was rooted on firm ground. The policy of expanding science teaching was, apparently, a measure encouraged from above—that is, by the government and its experts—rather than a development brought about by an increased need for public higher education felt in Lombard society at large. Competition for the few openings in new teaching positions, in any case, was high, and chances of success only slim. Volta, having decided to become an expert and a professor and/or a public servant, experienced the difficulty thoroughly. The procedures for the recruitment of new professors were being debated in Lombardy around 1770. In his plan Frisi mentioned publications and “inventions” as the credentials to be considered. Volta com-\n\nM A K I N G O F A N AT U R A L P H I L O S O P H E R\n\n31\n\nplied: his second publication mentioned the construction of a new apparatus (an all-wood electrostatic machine) already in the title. He still lacked the right patron, however. His competitor for the physics chair in Pavia, Carlo Barletti—a good electrician, ten years older than Volta—had got the message first. Barletti had dedicated his 1771 publication to Carlo di Firmian.88 In October Sperges, from Vienna, told Volta that Barletti (not mentioned) had secured the support of Firmian for the chair in Pavia. Barletti was duly appointed in 1772.89 Sperges explained to Volta that Firmian was the patron to whom to apply in the future if he wanted to carry on his pursuit of the “useful sciences.” His plan for a chair in Pavia temporarily frustrated, Volta went on cultivating his circle of international correspondents, which from March 1772 included Joseph Priestley.90 Besides electricity, which was no longer Priestley’s chief interest, fixed air was the frequent subject of their correspondence. Volta also kept close ties with Spallanzani in Pavia, performing a few experiments suggested by him in 1773 on the fertilization of insects and the regeneration of salamanders.91 Volta does not seem to have taken a great interest in such experiments, however, and he is unlikely to have seriously considered forsaking electricity for natural history. However, he was not being encouraged to continue work on electricity either. Sometime before April 1774 Beccaria— after a temporary appeasement—had invited Volta to maintain an “everlasting silence” on the subject of electricity.92 By 1774, when prospects for a job in the public education system at last materialized—the pace of educational reform having been boosted by the suppression of the Society of Jesus the year before—Volta had learned how to channel his ambitions. This time he applied direct to the plenipotentiary minister and asked (in fact, as the custom of the day demanded, he “supplicated”) for “a Lectureship in Physics, Metaphysics, or indeed, best of all, . . . the role of superintendent to public education [tutti gli studj] in [the] Town [of Como].”93 The credentials he submitted were the two Latin publications on electricity, and a plan (in manuscript form) for the establishment of “public schools in Como,” in which he himself suggested that there should be a superintendent.94 In October 1774 he learned from the Royal Delegate in Como, Lodovico Peregrini, that Firmian had granted him the role of superintendent he had planned.95 One of the first committees Volta joined in his new capacity was given the task of restructuring the library of the Jesuit College—now state property—where his interest in natural philosophy had first developed thirteen years before.96 After 1774 the routine job of supervising teachers and watching over the students’ work and discipline did not absorb Volta’s talents entirely. He saw himself, in fact, as a reformer of public education, in-\n\n32\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nspired by principles carefully drawn from Enlightenment ideals.97 The key words contained in the first brief report he submitted as superintendent to Firmian in December 1774 were “innovation,” “reform,” “advancement of the sciences,” “a happier culture.”98 Volta’s detailed proposals for a new plan of education were submitted to Firmian in March 1775, in reply to the minister’s request for a list of “things deserving reform.”99 The surviving plan does not include, unfortunately, the part dealing with natural philosophy; still, it illustrates some important innovations that Volta thought fit to introduce in the traditional curriculum offered by primary and secondary schools. Volta, for example, argued that the time given over to arithmetic— a useful art, he stressed—should be increased, while the teaching of the Italian language should precede in order and importance that of Latin, to which schools still gave priority. The teaching of a foreign language, and more precisely French—at the time the language of the nobility, the merchants, and of science throughout Europe—should also be introduced. The suggested innovations were in line with the Enlightenment values Volta had been cultivating from his early student years. Volta’s plan of education impressed Firmian. In May 1775 he decided that all teachers in Como, if they wished to retain their job, had to pass a special exam, Volta alone being exempted.100 In those same months Volta made a new substantive addition to his credentials as natural philosopher: he built his first widely known and successful electrical machine, the electrophorus, which he described in a brilliant paper for the recently established journal of Milanese philosophers.101 The electrophorus also impressed Firmian. In a letter to Volta he described the machine as a “superb and extremely useful discovery, doing honor to your Country, and to all of Italy, Mother of the Sciences and the Arts.”102 On the first of November 1775 Volta was appointed— without exam—to the chair of experimental physics introduced on the occasion in the schools of Como, while at the same time retaining his previous job as superintendent. The new chair carried with it a yearly stipend of 800 lire, which was added to the 1,200 lire Volta earned in his previous capacity.103 The story told in this section can be summed up briefly. When Volta first focused on natural philosophy in his search for cultural expression and identity, he was following his own individual choice, but within the range of options contemplated by the Jesuits’ system of education, further sustained by a fashionable trend within culture at large. When, about twenty-four years old and already an expert in natural philoso-\n\nM A K I N G O F A N AT U R A L P H I L O S O P H E R\n\n33\n\nphy, he joined the cadets from the lesser nobility and bourgeoisie seeking a job in the slowly expanding staff of the “enlightened” state administration, he was following in the tracks of an earlier generation of natural philosophers active in Lombardy and Piedmont, including scholars like Beccaria, Boscovich, Frisi, Carli, and Barletti. The personal development Volta underwent passing from amateur natural philosopher, to expert, to public servant, was inspired, and in turn sustained, by the efforts of the Austrian administration of Lombardy to establish a new, state system of education in which the natural philosophers had an important place. Volta, in any case, had both the culture and personal ambition to allow him to play an active role in the shaping of the new, public figure of the expert in natural philosophy that was then in the making. In this he invested qualities and traits that stemmed also from his intense emotional life.\n\nEmotional Life In his Jesuit teachers’ plans, the education young Volta had received in matters concerning body, love, and sex was strict. While still hoping to attract the sixteen-year-old Volta to the Society of Jesus, his philosophy professor had instructed the boy to avoid wasting time in “bodily pastimes” that were common during the long vacations at the villas the Volta family went in for, and which were deemed dangerous for the spiritual health of the boy.104 Advice on women was also severe. The recommendation given to Volta at sixteen was to avoid exchanging glances with women and to immediately turn away and lower his eyes should it happen.105 Whatever the immediate results of the recommendation, the long lasting effects fell well short of the Jesuit teacher’s expectations. Alessandro’s behavior as an adult was in keeping with the joyous lifestyle adopted by Lombard nobility in those days.
