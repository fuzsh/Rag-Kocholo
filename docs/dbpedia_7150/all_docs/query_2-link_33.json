        "text": "First edition, the Riccati family copy, of this beautiful book, Finé's masterpiece of illustrated book production. One of the handsomest scientific books of the period, this work is especially remarkable for the fact that the author designed its illustrations himself. Although Finé had published a few works before 1532, and edited others, “it was only with the publication of the Protomathesis that he revealed himself as the inventor of a new kind of scientific book” (Pantin, p. 289). The first two parts of the Protomathesis deal with arithmetic and geometry, the third with cosmography, and the fourth with gnomonics. The part on cosmography provides a valuable account of the state of astronomy in the decade immediately preceding the Copernican revolution. A great variety of astronomical instruments are shown along with tables used in calculation (several of the instruments are shown with their composite pieces separated so that an instrument could be made from them, and in some copies of this book – but not this one! – the pieces have been cut out). “The Protomathesis is Oronce Finé’s magnum opus, a work published shortly after his appointment as Lecteur royal en mathématiques, in order to set out his contribution (present and future) for the advancement of mathematics in France. As the first holder of a newly created and highly prestigious position, Oronce Finé (1494-1555) had worked towards a twofold end. He had wished to demonstrate his own mastery in the different fields of mathematics, and to expound his views on the discipline, as well as his teaching program. Thus, his Protomathesis – a collection of four textbooks – resembled a monumental epitome. Its content was relatively original and, above all, it adopted a new style in illustration and typographical design. No French mathematician had ever published such an ambitious work before. Moreover, the different elements of the book would become more or less the basis of the main part of Finé’s abundant subsequent publications. For example, the third part, Cosmographia, served as a prototype for the many De mundi sphaera that Finé was later to publish: on the occasion of each new release, he introduced changes, but the original model was still recognizable. For all these reasons, the Protomathesis played an important role in establishing what can be called a Parisian tradition of mathematical textbooks” (ibid., p. 287).\n\nProvenance: Jacopo Francesco Riccati (1676-1754), Venetian mathematician after whom the ‘Riccati equation’ is named (bookplate on pastedown and title verso); likely by descent to his son Vincenzo (1707-75), Jesuit mathematician who introduced hyperbolic functions and contributed to the theory of differential equations, and thus to:) – Collegio di San Francesco Saverio in Bologna (inscription on title, where Vincenzo Riccati taught for 30 years).\n\nThe Protomathesis (a Latin transcription of a Greek word meaning ‘first instruction’) begins with De arithmetica practica. Finé takes up, both in the dedicatory letter to François I and in the first section of the Arithmetica, the question of the utility of mathematics, and asks: “What would exist without mathematics? Without numbers we would have no music, no geometry, no philosophy, and no laws. Mathematics is thus not only useful, it is necessary” (Marr, p. 174). Thus, the Arithmetica served as a necessary introduction to the rest of the work. Its four books deal respectively with integers, common fractions, sexagesimal fractions, and proportion. Finé “considered the theory of proportion a crucial aspect of the mathematics of nature … It is notable that some major seventeenth century figures, such as Galileo and Kepler, thought in the same way, even after the appearance of Viète’s symbolic algebra and Fermat’s and Descartes’s mathematics” (ibid., p. 175). Finé did not treat algebra in the Protomathesis; its introduction into French university instruction was left to Finé’s three famous pupils, Jacques Peletier du Mans, Petrus Ramus and Pierre Forcadel.\n\nThe second work in the volume, De geometria, “starts with an introduction dealing with the definition and the principles of geometry, that is with the theoretical basis of the subject. Book 1 contains definitions of figures (points, lines, surfaces, angles), general properties and axioms. It also deals with sinuses, chords and arcs (including a table). Book 2, which is properly practical, addresses the art of measuring lines, surfaces and bodies according to Euclid, before going on to elucidate the method of building a geometrical square or quadrant. The remaining chapters explain how to measure distances using the quadrant, staffs, Jacob’s staff, and the geometrical square; how to measure surfaces (triangles, parallelograms, figures with multiple angles such as the pentagon or hexagon, and circles); how to demonstrate (according to the method of Archimedes) the relation between the circumference and the diameter of the circle; how to square the circle; and finally how to measure solid bodies (columns, pyramids, spheres, dodecahedrons, etc., the rhomb or ‘almond’ [that is, barrels]” (ibid., p. 57).\n\nFiné’s ‘proof’ that the circle can be squared was, of course, incorrect – the circle cannot be ‘squared’ in the sense Finé intended, although this was not proved until the nineteenth century. Finé was certainly not alone among sixteenth-century (and later) mathematicians in his attempt to square the circle, but the errors in his attempt in the Protomathesis led to a series of attacks, first by the Portuguese mathematician Pedro Nunes, then by the Frenchman Jean Borel, the Italian Niccolò Tartaglia, and the Dutchman Adrian van Roomen. “Oronce Finé was no stranger to polemics. On the contrary, harsh criticism and the attacks of adversaries seem to have been frequent during his life. It is known that he was in prison for some time in 1523-1525 [probably for practising judicial astrology] and that his adversaries were legion. His motto ‘virtus virescit vulnus’ (courage [or virtue] grows stronger from a wound) testifies to the constant attacks he suffered and to his determination not to succumb to critiques” (ibid., p. 156). Indeed, the attacks on his ‘circle squaring’ seem not to have affected Finé very much – in 1544 he published a whole book on the subject, Quadratura circuli.\n\nBook 2, Liber de geometria practica, is undoubtedly the most important and original part of De geometria. “Practical geometry played an important role in the history of Renaissance culture, for it connected intellectual knowledge to numerous fields of practice, which all engaged in their own way with artisanal practices of the day: painting, architecture, fortification, topography, shipbuilding, carpentry, stonecutting, etc. … Practical geometry was essential for Finé’s work on cartography (which, by the end of the 1520s, had made him famous), cosmography, mirrors, and dialling, and played a crucial part in the lessons he delivered in his capacity as Royal Lecturer … Oronce Finé’s works on practical geometry are especially relevant for the cultural history of Europe in the Renaissance because they tied together different traditions from the past and offered to the renewed audience of the sixteenth century the basis, both theoretical and practical, of a new knowledge ready for application … it is significant that a manuscript written in England, probably at the end of the sixteenth century, provides a translation of the Protomathesis and of the De rebus mathematicis (1556) … The anonymous author (possibly connected to Gresham College if we consider his practical mathematical interests) was not, however, the first Englishman to have read Finé’s geometries. Thomas Digges clearly had access to Finé’s work on the geometrical square, since some pages of his Pantometria (1571) plagiarize the French mathematician. Examples such as these testify to the continued currency of Finé’s practical geometries into the late sixteenth century” (ibid., pp. 52-63).\n\nThe term ‘cosmography’ was used in the sixteenth century to refer both to the study of the heavens and that of terrestrial geography; Finé’s De cosmographia is devoted almost entirely to the former. “Finé signalled this clearly by giving his Cosmographia the alternative title of De sphaera mundi. That name connected the third part of the Protomathesis with the long tradition of works on spherical astronomy of which Sacrobosco’s De sphaera is the best-known example … In Finé’s Sphaera mundi, fully four-fifths of the text were devoted to [spherical astronomy] rather than to the surface of the earth. Thus, while the first book treated the general structure of the universe, the second introduced the divisions of the celestial sphere, the third covered the rising and setting of the stars, and the fourth dealt with solar astronomy and gnomonics; it was not until the fifth book that [Finé] provided the promised geography and hydrography. The subtitle in the 1555 edition gives a fair idea of this fifth chapter’s contents: ‘wherein is treated geographical, chorographical, hydrographical foundations, that is parallels, climata, longitudes and latitudes of places, and the travel distances of these, plus the exact delineation of charts, both particular and universal. But everything prior to that was basic astronomy …\n\n“Finé’s Sphaera mundi was not, however, exclusively mathematical … Like other astronomical treatises, [it] introduced natural philosophical considerations at the outset, when discussing the structure of the universe, and the principles of celestial motion, but also the idea of celestial causation. Thus, in Book 1, Chapter 1, Finé introduced the distinction between the elemental region of the cosmos, liable to generation and corruption, and the celestial region, entirely free of change, and stressed the importance of the relationship between them. The elements, he indicated, combined in various proportions to provide the material cause of inferior things, but the ‘celestial machine’ constituted the formal and specific cause; thus, sublunary things took nourishment from the elements, but life from the heavens … In the chapter of Book 1 devoted to the number and order of the celestial orbs, Finé supplied a table of the celestial bodies listing, in addition to their names and symbols, the complexion of each (hot or cold, moist or dry), whether they were considered benevolent or maleficent, and with which of the seven metals they were supposed to correspond. And in the chapter of Book 2 concerned with the signs of the zodiac, he explained the names of these with reference to the qualities shared by the sun in the sign and the creature or thing after which it was named, providing thereby an account of seasonal change” (ibid., pp. 121-123).\n\nFiné’s Sphaera mundi was “known and studied, both at home and abroad. At home, André Thevet appropriated elements of Finé’s pious defence of cosmography for his own Cosmographie universelle (Paris, 1575). Outside of France, Finé’s text was owned by such Scandinavian and German notables as Tycho Brahe, Johann Scheubel, Landgrave Wilhelm IV of Hessen-Kassel, and Elector August of Saxony (the latter two both in the form of the Protomathesis) … In England, it was possessed by several men of property, and by scholars at Cambridge University, and was certainly read and referred to by Robert Recorde” (ibid., p. 135).\n\n“Given Finé’s interest in instruments, and his statements about the need to properly ground practical mathematics in theoretical understanding, it is perhaps no surprise that the fourth book of the Protomathesis, titled De solaribus horologiis et quadrantibus libri quatuor, includes descriptions of how to make and use a variety of sundials. Finé explains that since there is an increasing number of types of dial, it seems to him to be important to clarify and improve on the existing sources and to add some of his own discoveries. He states that sundials reflect the motions and structures of the heavens through the movement of a shadow or a plumbline, referring the reader back to chapter 9 of the previous part of the Protomathesis (De cosmographia), where he had discussed the seasons.\n\n“De solaribus horologiis is divided into four books, the first of which covers the making and common uses of sundials, including those indicating the time by thread, stylus, or other means. The second book covers other types of dials, including the ring dial, cylinder dial, and universal dials that can be used at any latitude, which are all based on ‘the course of the sun, or other astronomical foundations.’ Added to these is a hydraulic clock that Finé himself claims to have developed. The third and fourth books describe the construction and use of an astrolabe quadrant. Among the dials described and illustrated in the second book is a ship-shaped dial” (ibid., pp. 84-85).\n\nThe water-clock, or clepsydra, emerged “following the rediscovery of the writings of the Greek mechanicians of Hellenistic Antiquity and in particular of Hero … The extant texts of Hero do not include a description of a water-clock, but the numerous ways of manipulating water by siphons that he describes provided both craftsmen and scholars with a starting point for the conception and realisation of new and various models. One such was that developed by Oronce Finé. At the end of the treatise on sundials which makes up the fourth part of his Protomathesis, he added a short text entitled: ‘To make a water-clock showing equal hours devised with marvellous art by the author.’ The text, in a summary translation, [begins] as follows. ‘Before closing, allow me to add the description and explanation of a water-clock that I recently devised. For even if several investigators of not despicable things have explained various hydraulic machines, up to now no one has described what we have found, [a machine] which shows equal hours by the flow of water’” (ibid., pp. 192-194).\n\n“Looking closely at the ordering of material in De solaribus horologiis, we see that significant changes were made by Finé to his source material, so that the book brought some geometrical order to the enormous variety of sundials available. Unlike the medieval compilations, Finé’s book has a linking rationale, and proceeds from simple geometrical principles to more advanced instruments, in line with his aim to give practical mathematics a solid theoretical foundation” (ibid., p. 89). “Parts of the book were reworked and translated, appearing in works on sundials published across Europe. In France, Claude de Boissiere published a work which summarized material from De solaribus horologiis. In Italy, Niccolò Tartaglia praised Finé’s instruments in his Nova scientia (Venice, 1537), and the Italian translation of the Protomathesis, published in Venice in 1587, influenced Giovanni Paolo Gallucci’s Della fabrica et uso di diversi stromenti, published in 1587. Scholars in England (including Robert Recorde and John Dee) acknowledged Finé as an expert on dialling … For Clavius it is clear that Finé’s De solaribus horologiis was an important source” (ibid., pp. 97-98).\n\nThe Protomathesis is a richly illustrated work. Many drawings indicate instruments and techniques of measure and representation. Several full-page illustrations, often methaphorical or allegorical, open various sections of the book. The first pages of each chapter are decorated with sophisticated initials and decorative bands. Finé himself appears in many of these illustrations, sometimes shown as a portrait, sometimes depicted full-length, sometimes suggested graphically by the initials of his name. For example, the third book, on cosmography, opens with an image that represents him next to Urania, the muse of astronomy, a book in one hand and a surveying instrument in the other; this illustration is an adaptation of the cut of Ptolemy and the author in Regiomontanus’ Epytoma in Almagestum Ptolomei (Venice, 1496). Moreover, the first page of the fourth section contains two mentions of his person: in the initial letter is his face; in the middle of the band there is a celestial sphere suspended by two rings in which are found his initials.\n\n“This masterpiece was so monumental that two years were needed for its completion. Part II (Geometria), Part III (Cosmographia) and Part IV (De solaribus horologis) have their own title pages bearing respectively the dates 1530, 1530 and 1531, and the royal privilege is dated June 1532. Some peculiarities of the volume show that the printing process was complicated, but it is certain that, from the beginning, the author had intended to publish the collection as a whole, and never considered releasing its parts separately. Although each of these parts occupies an independent set of gatherings, foliation and register are continuous throughout the volume” (Pantin, p. 289).\n\n“The Protomathesis was certainly an influential book … and the copies now present in public libraries show the importance of its diffusion, especially in Italy and in England” (ibid., p. 305). It was reprinted at Paris in 1542, translated into Italian in 1587, and the individual parts were issued separately in many editions, including: the De arithmetica practica at Paris in 1535, 1542, 1544 & 1555; the De geometria at Strasbourg in 1544 & 1556 and Venice in 1587; the De cosmographia (De mundi sphaera) at Paris in 1542, 1551, 1553 & 1555; and the De solaribus horologiis at Paris in 1560.\n\n“Finé was a quintessential polymath, equally at home in the workshop as in the study. Not only did he make and sell his own instruments, he also designed maps, prepared the illustrations for his many books, and worked as an editor and overseer in Paris’s bustling printing houses … The teacher of Petrus Ramus, Jacques Peletier and Pierre Forcadel, Finé educated an entire generation of French mathematicians, who went on to prepare the ground for the work of canonical figures such as Descartes and Viète … Finé should properly be regarded as one of the progenitors of the French renaissance of mathematics …\n\n“Born to a respected Dauphinois family in 1494, Finé’s background played a major part in shaping his career. His father, François, was a physician and student of astronomy who published a treatise on the equatorium in the year of Oronce Finé’s birth. Finé’s uncles, Pierre and Antoine, were painters, and have been described as ‘serious students of perspective and astronomy.’ Thus, from an early age Finé was exposed to mathematics, art and the world of the book – in fact, Pierre and Antoine’s only surviving work is an illuminated book of hours, which perhaps helps to explain Finé’s celebrated skills as a book illustrator” (ibid., pp. 2-6). François Finé died when Oronce was still a child and his estate passed to the eldest son, obliging Oronce to move to Paris, where he arrived ca. 1510. “There he studied grammar and philosophy, and was awarded the Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1522. However, he seems also to have pursued mathematical studies, indeed it is generally agreed that he was a junior member of Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples’s intellectual circle … Lefèvre’s circle was particularly eager to harness the new medium of print in order to advance scholarship, so it is unsurprising that Finé’s earliest employment was in Parisian print shops” (ibid., p. 6).\n\nAfter Finé’s term of imprisonment, a period of intense activity followed. He produced editions of works by leading mathematical authors, and published treatises on instruments and planetary theory, as well as his first map. “In 1530 he composed a letter in verse, the Epistre exhortative, dedicated to François I, which urged the king to add a chair of mathematics to the recently founded Collège Royal [now the Collège de France]. Finé’s suggestion bore fruit, for in 1531 he was named the first Royal Lecturer in Mathematics, a position he held until his death” (ibid., p. 8).\n\nAdams F-477; Brun 206; Mortimer, French 225 (“His work as a designer is closely related to his major fields of mathematics, astronomy, and geography, and his contribution to book production is particularly interesting in extending beyond the illustration to the ornamentation of scientific texts”); Hoover 312; Houzeau & Lancaster 2380; Lalande, p. 50 (“on trouve les cadrans plans horizontaux, verticaux, équinoxiaux; les cadrans sur les cylindres, les anneaux et les quarts-de-cercle; les hémisphères concaves et convexes; le cadran rectiligne universel des hauteurs; les heures italiques; l’instrument pour trouver l’heure par les étoiles, l’anneau astronomique; un instrument propre à tracer les cadrans; c’est un cercle équinoxial traversé d’un axe, et un fil qu'on tend sur les heures”); Smith, Rara Arithmetica, pp. 160-161; Stillwell, Science 838.
