        "text": "It's All-Star Week on Hustler Casino Live, and the star of the first show was the show's co-owner, Ryan Feldman, whose massive win was so unlikely it surprised even the announcer.\n\nThe first of two All-Star Games took place on livestream Wednesday night, and a second one is scheduled for Friday night, a game that will feature Alan Keating and potentially Tom Dwan as a late entry.\n\nDwan also competed in the first game, and left Hustler Casino in Los Angeles $87,725 in the red. Poker vlogger Mariano, a Hustler Casino Live regular, was the biggest loser in the game down $167,725. Three players won small amounts, while most of the chips on the table went over to Feldman's stack.\n\nCatching Some Cards\n\nHustler Casino Live launched in 2021, and Feldman entered the All-Star Game down over $720,000 lifetime across 23 sessions on the livestream he built, according to TrackingPoker.com. He put a dent into that deficit Wednesday night.\n\nLuck was on Feldman's side in multiple massive pots. The first hand of note began with Mariano raising to $1,000 from the hijack with A♥6♠ before getting three-bet to $2,500 from the Hustler Casino Live co-owner on the button with A♣Q♥. Dwan, in the small blind with K♣6♣, made it $11,000.\n\nFeldman was the only caller and saw a flop of 7♦6♥9♥. Both players checked to the board-pairing 9♠ turn card. This time, Dwan bet his pair, making a $6,300 wager. The in-position player then raised it up to $18,000 with nothing but ace-high, but his opponent made the call.\n\nWhen the Q♣ appeared on the river, it completed a nine-outer for the ace-queen. Dwan checked, and then had a tough decision to make facing a $22,000 bet. The poker legend and former Full Tilt Poker pro was unable to make the fold, and lost a $104,000 pot.\n\nThe Biggest Pot of the Night\n\nLuck had arrived for Feldman in the above hand against \"durrrr.\" But that wasn't nearly as big as the pot the Hustler Casino Live boss would scoop later in the six-hour stream against another player.\n\nThe straddled pot began with Feldman raising it to $600 from the cutoff with 9♣9♠, and then calling a three-bet to $3,000 from Britney, who had A♥A♣ in the small blind, her fourth time getting pocket aces during the session.\n\nBritney liked the 4♣3♠6♥ as her opponent had an inferior over pair. She confidently bet $4,000 and received a call from a player drawing to a two-outer, which came through when the 9♥ appeared on the turn. The script had flipped as the player holding pocket rockets was drawing to a two-outer.\n\nThe turn card didn't seem like a scare card, so Britney bet again, this time for $10,000. Feldman came back with a small raise to $22,000, before snap-calling an all in jam to $77,300. They agreed to run the river twice, and neither river card was an ace. Feldman scooped a $169,000 pot. Hustler Casino Live commentator Kyle \"RaverPoker\" Ravreby had some fun clowning on Feldman after the hand.\n\n\"Everyone's in shock, I'm in shock,\" Ravreby joked about Feldman winning big. \"Earlier, I had the video team create a montage of all the times Ryan's lost. We kind of clowned on him. Well, karma has proven us wrong. He said, 'no, I'm a winner, I'm gonna show you guys.' Alright, if that's what it takes for Ryan to win, we should just make a video of all his lowlights every time he's going to play on the show.\"\n\nPerhaps Ravreby needling his boss was the motivation Feldman needed as he won $199,025 during the All-Star Game stream, cutting out about a quarter of his lifetime deficit on Hustler Casino Live."
