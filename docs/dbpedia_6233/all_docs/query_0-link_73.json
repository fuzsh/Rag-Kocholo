        "text": "With this movie, director Stanley Kubrick redefined the limits of filmmaking and cemented his legacy as one of the most revolutionary and influential directors of all time. Originally released in 70mm Cinerama roadshow format following the film's world premiere on April 2, 1968, at the Uptown Theater in Washington, DC, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY ignited the imaginations of critics and audiences alike, and its impact continues to resonate to this day. Kubrick's dazzling, Academy Award®–winning achievement is a compelling drama of man vs. machine, a stunning meld of music and motion. Kubrick (who co-wrote the screenplay with sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke) first visits man's prehistoric ape-ancestry past, then leaps millennia into colonized space and ultimately whisks astronaut David Bowman (Keir Dullea) into uncharted territory, perhaps even into immortality. \"Open the pod bay doors, HAL.\" Let an awesome journey unlike any other begin. DIR/SCR/PROD Stanley Kubrick; SCR Arthur C. Clarke, from his story \"The Sentinel.\" UK/U.S., 1968, color, 142 min. plus one 15-min. intermission. RATED G\n\nAFI Member passes accepted.\n\nAbout \"Kubrick: An Odyssey\"\n\nThe enigmatic and elusive creator of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, THE SHINING and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE has not been treated to a full-length biography in over 20 years. \"Kubrick: An Odyssey\" fills that gap. Robert P. Kolker and Nathan Abrams' definitive book (published February 2024 by Pegasus Books) is based on access to the latest research, especially Stanley Kubrick's archive at the University of the Arts, London, as well as other private papers plus new interviews with family members and those who worked with him. It presents the most in-depth portrait yet of the groundbreaking director, offering comprehensive and in-depth coverage of Kubrick's personal, private, public and working life. \"Kubrick: An Odyssey\" investigates not only the making of his films but also about those he wanted (but failed) to make like BURNING SECRET, NAPOLEON, ARYAN PAPERS and A.I. Revealingly, this immersive biography punctures the controversial myths about the reclusive filmmaker who created some of the most important works of art of the 20th century.\n\nAbout Robert P. Kolker\n\nRobert P. Kolker, Professor Emeritus at the University of Maryland, taught cinema studies for almost 50 years. He is the author of \"A Cinema of Loneliness\" and \"The Extraordinary Image: Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and the Reimagining of Cinema\"; editor of \"Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey: New Essays\" and \"The Oxford Handbook of Film and Media Studies\"; and co-author of \"Eyes Wide Shut: Stanley Kubrick and the Making of His Final Film.\"\n\nAs a rookie cop, LAPD detective Erin Bell (Nicole Kidman) was placed undercover with a gang in the California desert with tragic results. When the gang leader (Toby Kebbell) re-emerges 17 years later, Bell must work her way back through the remaining members and into her own history with them to finally reckon with the demons that destroyed her past. A moral and existential odyssey, DESTROYER features one of Kidman's most startling roles, not just because of the transformative makeup that replaces her glamorous, blonde-haired visage with a pallid, battered veneer but because you'd never expect her to play such a grim, morally decayed cop. She embodies a scarred soul who's been to hell and back and does so through the easily missed aspects of her performance: a gait weighed by years of abuse, her eyes brimming with visceral hatred. You may not like who Kidman is playing, but there's no doubt you'll be captivated by her performance in this dark, gritty thriller.

In his striking narrative feature debut, Sean Wang (Oscar®-nominated for his short doc NǍI NAI & WÀI PÓ) takes us on a kinetic ride through the ups and downs of adolescence, mining personal experience to share a joyful, funny and deeply affecting ode to first-generation teenagers navigating the beauty and pain of cultural heritage in a sea of conformity. Wang confidently steers us through the freewheeling early days of social media, when AIM emoticons and MySpace rankings carry the weight of heartbreak and friendships forged and broken. Both a moving love letter to immigrant parents and a playful examination of our uncertain paths to adulthood, DÌDI reminds us that growing up and growing into better versions of ourselves are often one and the same.

Amiably taken in by the town's residents, she quickly finds herself at their mercy as their duplicitous nature comes to light and she is asked to repay their kindness in turn. A polarizing film, DOGVILLE presents the Dogme 95 aesthetic that director Lars von Trier co-founded but with a Brechtian bent: its staging is a minimalist set whose spartan design focuses our attention on the nuanced performances from a stacked cast that also includes John Hurt, Lauren Bacall, Paul Bettany, Chloë Sevigny, Stellan Skarsgård, Ben Gazzara, James Caan, Patricia Clarkson and Udo Kier. The first in the director's yet unfinished USA – LAND OF OPPORTUNITIES trilogy, DOGVILLE is a challenging yet profoundly significant work from an uncompromising artist.

Now, Japan's only hope lies in the three Guardian Monsters — Mothra, King Ghidorah and Baragon — who unite to battle Godzilla and save the country from total annihilation. This 2001 outing for the King of the Monsters ignored the continuity of the previous films and instead served as a direct sequel to the 1954 original. Popularly known as GMK, it featured new designs for all four kaiju depicted on-screen, none more striking than Godzilla itself with shocking all-white eyes. A box-office hit, GIANT MONSTERS ALL-OUT ATTACK was directed by Shûsuke Kaneko, known for his work on the competing monster franchise GAMERA, and is a favorite of director Takashi Yamazaki, who was inspired by the film when writing the screenplay for GODZILLA MINUS ONE.

But that's not the only threat to the world: a colony of Precambrian crustaceans, mutated by the Oxygen Destroyer from the 1954 film, emerge from the depths and merge into the demonic, flying behemoth Destoroyah. Naturally, the two come to blows, though it seems whichever creature wins, humanity loses. Featuring two of the long-running series' most unique and beloved creature designs, GODZILLA VS.

After being tasked with organizing a 25th-anniversary college reunion, Harry is engulfed by the memories of his youth and the passion he shared with lively co-worker Marvin Myles (Hedy Lamarr) and begins to rue the sterile and joyless path he chose over the woman who made him feel alive. Attempting to preserve the strictly first-person viewpoint novel used in John P.

She doesn't approve of Pauline's choice (Jack Black) or much else, for that matter. The sisters bring out the worst in each other and their deep-rooted resentments come to a head over the fraught wedding weekend in Baumbach's comedy of familial discomfort, elevated by Kidman and Leigh’s intrepid performances.

BAXTER'S BEAUTIES OF 1933 (in gorgeous living color, naturally) follows the fortunes of childless Broadway producer Spats Baxter (George C.
