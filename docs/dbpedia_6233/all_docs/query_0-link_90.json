        "text": "The Christmastime and post-holiday movie season isn't typically the strongest time of the year for movies, yet the 2014-2015 winter releases would beg to differ. Front-loaded with big blockbusters like The Hobbit and Into the Woods and ending with franchises like The Divergent Series: Insurgent and Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension, the winter season also has some intriguing meat hanging in the middle, like Jupiter Ascending, Kingsman: The Secret Service, and Fifty Shades of Grey. As always, we're ready to break down the coming season's notable movies for you, starting with the pre-Christmas weekend releases.\n\nAnnie\n\nRelease Date: December 19 (US), December 26 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe perennial musical hero, little orphan Annie, is making her way back to the big screen this winter courtesy of Easy A director Will Gluck. This time starring Jamie Foxx, Cameron Diaz, Rose Byrne and the adorable Quvenzhane Wallis, Annie once again tells the tale of a young orphan that sparks a charming relationship with a rich business man. Though updated for the modern era (technologically-savvy penthouses!), it seems Annie will nonetheless keep the classic musical numbers largely intact.\n\nThe Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\n\nRelease Date: December 19 (US), December 12 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe final entry into Peter Jackson’s Middle-earth saga that began 13 years ago, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies brings the attack of Smaug to the forefront. Most certainly a bittersweet conclusion considering it’s the last time we’ll see Gandalf, Bilbo, and the rest on the big screen, The Battle of the Five Armies is sure to hold no shortage of stunning battles and thrilling action set-pieces that will rival anything seen previously in Jackson’s sprawling adventures.\n\nNight at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\n\nRelease Date: December 19 (US), December 19 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nLarry Daley and the rest of the museum gang are back at it in the latest Night at the Museum adventure, once again directed by Shawn Levy. Ben Stiller returns to traverse the globe in an effort to save the magic that brings his friends to life from running out. Secret of the Tomb reunites Stiller with Owen Wilson, Steve Coogan, Dick Van Dyke, and the late Robin Williams, while adding Rebel Wilson, Ben Kingsley, and more to the impressive cast.\n\nThe Gambler\n\nRelease Date: December 19 (US), May 1 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes director Rupert Wyatt directs this new thriller from the writer of The Departed, William Monahan, itself a remake of the 1974 James Caan classic. The Gambler stars Mark Wahlberg as a college professor/gambler that falls into trouble when he gets on the bad side of a loan shark. In case that wasn’t enough trouble, Wahlberg’s Jim Bennett also manages to rope a student of his into the madness. The Gambler co-stars Jessica Lange, Brie Larson, and John Goodman.\n\nThe Interview\n\nRelease Date: UPDATED: Sony opened the film in limited theatrical release and streaming Dec. 25.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe delayed comedy (and possible genesis for the Sony hacks?) from Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen finally hits on Christmas Day, which finds TV personality Dave Skylark (James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rapaport (Rogen) sent into North Korea to interview the elusive Kim Jong-un. The catch? The CIA recruits them to use their access to assassinate the dictator. As we might expect, antics and laughs ensue. The Interview co-stars Lizzy Caplan, Timothy Simons, Reese Alexander, and Randall Park as Kim Jong-un.\n\nInto the Woods\n\nRelease Date: December 25 (US), January 9 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nA fantasy musical the likes of which is rarely seen these days, Into the Woods takes all manners of classic fairy tales as its inspiration. Starring Meryl Streep as an evil witch collecting artifacts from said fairy tales, Into the Woods is directed by Marshall (Chicago, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides), written by James Lapine, and features music by the incomparable Stephen Sondheim. Rounding out the cast is Anna Kendrick as Cinderella, Chris Pine as Cinderella’s Prince, Mackenzie Mauzy as Rapunzel, Lilla Crawford as Red Riding Hood, and Johnny Depp as The Wolf.\n\nUnbroken\n\nRelease Date: December 25 (US), December 26 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nDirected by Angelina Jolie, Unbroken tells the harrowing true story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic athlete who would up as a prisoner of war during World War II, enduring trauma after being captured by the Japenese forces. Jack O’Connell tars as Zamperini with Jai Courtney, Garrett Hedlund, and Domhall Gleeson rounding out the supporting cast.\n\nAmerican Sniper\n\nRelease Date: December 25 (US), January 16 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nClint Eastwood’s latest (following up his decidedly lighter fare Jersey Boys) is the intense depiction of Chris Kyle, widely regarded as the most lethal sniper in Navy S.E.A.L. history. With over 150 kills, Bradley Cooper explores Kyle’s military career as recounted in his book of the same name, adapted for the screen by Jason Hall. American Sniper co-stars Sienna Miller as Kyle’s wife.\n\nBig Eyes\n\nRelease Date: December 25 (US), December 26 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nTim Burton’s greatest film, arguably, is the wacky biopic of director Ed Wood. Because of this, Big Eyes is easily the most exciting new film to come from Burton in quite some time, cataloging the life and career of Margaret Keane, a painter whose work rose to prominence in the 1950s under her husband’s name, and the legal troubles that followed. Big Eyes stars Amy Adams as Margaret Keane and Christoph Waltz as Walter Keane, and features supporting players Krysten Ritter, Jason Schwartzman, and Terence Stamp.\n\nSelma\n\nRelease Date: December 25 (US), February 6 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThere’s perhaps no better a time for a movie about the civil rights marches of Selma, Alabama to come about.

Chandor, A Most Violent Year follows the tale of immigrant Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) as he struggles to protect his business and family in the midst of New York City’s turbulent and unbelievably violent 1981. A Most Violent Year co-stars Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo, and Albert Brooks.\n\nThe Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death\n\nRelease Date: January 2 (US), January 1 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nSet some 40 years after the events of the first film, The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death returns to the terrifying Eel Marsh House. Instead of Daniel Radcliffe, this time around the victims are a group of children that are fleeing from the bombings of London during the madness of World War II. Taking cover in the Eel Marsh House, they are horrified to find that what lurks inside is far worse than man-made weapons. The Woman in Black 2 stars Helen McCrory, Jeremy Irvine, and Phoebe Fox.\n\nTak3n\n\nRelease Date: January 9 (US), January 8 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nOnce again, ex-operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is on the hunt for those that wronged his family. This time around, Mills is targeted as the perpetrator of a vicious killing that he had nothing to do with. To protect himself and his family, he has no choice but to clear his name and take down the people that are framing him. Taken 3 co-stars Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, Dougray Scott, and Forest Whitaker.\n\nBlackhat\n\nRelease Date: January 16 (US), February 20 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nA new crime thriller from Michael Mann is certainly an exciting way to kick off the New Year, and that seems to be exactly what Blackhat is going to deliver. Blackhat stars Chris Hemsworth as Nicholas Hathaway, a convicted hacker serving time in prison, who is released in order to help the authorities catch a dangerous cyber terrorist that’s running amok. Mann has crafted a globe-trotting adventure that is sure to play on all of our current fears. It co-stars Viola Davis and William Mapother.\n\nPaddington\n\nRelease Date: January 16 (US), November 28, 2014 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nMichael Bond’s beloved series of children’s books, Paddington Bear, finally gets a big screen adaptation in an adventure that looks equal parts charming, hilarious, and heartfelt. Directed by Paul King (The Mighty Boosh), Paddington stars Ben Whishaw as the titular loveable bear that’s surrounded by a stunning cast, including Nicole Kidman, Peter Capaldi, Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, and Imelda Staunton. Though it’s already released in the UK, US audiences will have to wait until just after Christmas to join in on Paddington’s adventure.\n\nThe Wedding Ringer\n\nRelease Date: January 16 (US), February 20 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThis Jeremy Garelick-directed romantic comedy finds a young groom fearing his in-laws so much that he turns to a for-hire best man to help play wingman. Think of it as a post-relationship Hitch, with Kevin Hart serving as the best man in question. The Wedding Ringer co-stars Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, Alan Ritchson, Olivia Thirlby, Nicky Whelan, Cloris Leachman, and Mimi Rogers.\n\nEscobar: Paradise Lost\n\nRelease Date: January 16 (US), TBD (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nWhat would you do if you went on vacation and fell in love with the girl of your dreams, only to discover that her uncle is the most notorious drug lord in the world. That’s the basic premise of Escobar: Paradise Lost; Josh Hutcherson is a kid surfing in Colombia who meets his dream girl and learns she’s the niece of the one and only Pablo Escobar (played by Benicio Del Toro).\n\nThe Boy Next Door\n\nRelease Date: January 23 (US), February 27 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nIt’s a classic tale: Girl meets boy. Girl loves boy. Boy has a terrible, terrible secret. That’s the basic premise of this new Jennifer Lopez vehicle directed by Rob Cohen (The Fast and the Furious, Alex Cross); J-Lo is a divorcee that falls for the new man that moves next door to her, only to discover that he’s got a dark past. The Boy Next Door co-stars Ryan Guzman as the titular boy next door.\n\nMortdecai\n\nRelease Date: January 23 (US and UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nJohnny Depp takes on yet another eccentric role to kick off 2015, this time as the lead character in David Koepp’s Mortdecai, a film adaptation of Kyril Bonfiglioli’s novel Don’t Point That Thing at Me. Mortdecai is an oddball art dealer on the hunt for a stolen painting with links to a Nazi fortune. Alongside Depp is an all-star cast that includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Ewan McGregor, Jeff Goldblum, and Olivia Munn.\n\nBlack Sea\n\nRelease Date: January 23 (US), December 5, 2014 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe new thriller from Kevin Macdonald (State of Play, The Last King of Scotland), Black Sea stars Jude Law as a submarine captain that accepts a dangerous job searching the depths of the ocean for a sunken sub that is allegedly full of gold. Black Sea co-stars Scoot McNairy, Jodie Whittaker, and Ben Mendelsohn.\n\nStrange Magic\n\nRelease Date: January 23 (US), February 11 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nA surprising new Lucasfilm production from the mind of Star Wars creator George Lucas, Strange Magic is an animated fairy tale that depicts the first meeting of imps, goblins, and fairies, and the conflict that follows as a result of culture shock.

That’s the general conceit of director Dean Israelite’s new found-footage sci-fi thriller, Project Almanac. It seems the kids in the film have the same basic ideas most of us would – going back in time to win the lottery, for instance – but of course things soon go awry. The more they change in the past, the more terrifying the future becomes. Also, there's no way the title isn't a reference to Back to the Future Part II, right?\n\nJupiter Ascending\n\nRelease Date: February 6 (US and UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe Wachowski’s latest science-fiction opus finally hits in early 2015, starring Mila Kunis as the titular Jupiter Jones, heir to the throne, and Channing Tatum as Caine, a man that finds himself protecting her. Jupiter Ascending displays all the hallmarks of The Wachowski’s visual flair and imaginative world-building, but most importantly, it looks remarkably ambitious. In addition to Kunis and Tatum, Jupiter Ascending also boasts Sean Bean, James D’Arcy, and Terry Gilliam in its cast.\n\nSeventh Son\n\nRelease Date: February 6 (US), March 27 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nJulianne Moore and Jeff Bridges anchor Sergey Bodrov’s Seventh Son, a family fantasy film about Thomas Ward (Ben Barnes), a young man training to fight spirits is forced to have a trial by fire when an evil witch escapes her prison and wreaks havoc.

SpongeBob and friends continue to impress as the most enduring animated characters since The Simpsons.\n\nFifty Shades of Grey\n\nRelease Date: February 13 (US and UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nWhat better way to spend Valentine’s Day than with the fan-fiction-turned-best-seller Fifty Shades of Grey, the erotic drama that’s taken the world by storm? Brought to the big screen by Sam Taylor-Johnson, E.L.

Jackson, and Mark Hamill.\n\nHot Tub Time Machine 2\n\nRelease Date: February 20 (US and UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nJohn Cusack is out, Adam Scott is in for this sequel to the bizarre and hilarious 2010 comedy. This time around, Lou (Rob Corddry) is the victim of an assassination, and so Jacob (Clark Duke) and Nick (Craig Robinson) fire up the jets of the time machine to go back in time to save him. Loaded with cameos and supporting cast that includes the likes of Thomas Lennon, Chevy Chase, Jason Jones, and Gilliam Jacobs, Hot Tub Time Machine is sure to be another whacked-out adventure.\n\nMcFarland, USA\n\nRelease Date: February 20 (US and UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe latest feel-good Disney sports drama, McFarland, USA stars Kevin Costner as a cross-country running coach in a small west coast town who leads a group of young athletes to glory. By all accounts it sounds like a familiar story, but with Whale Rider director Niko Caro at the helm, surely it will transform into something beyond typical. McFarland, USA co-stars Maria Bello.\n\nFocus\n\nRelease Date: February 27 (US and UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nBefore they join the DC Universe’s Suicide Squad as Deadshot and Harley Quinn, respectively, Will Smith and Margot Robbie will play would-be lovers in Focus, a romantic crime dramedy about a con man that falls in love with a new prospect he’s taken under his wing to show the ropes of grifting.\n\nThe Lazarus Effect\n\nRelease Date: February 27 (US), February 20 (UK)\n\nThere’s admittedly not much information available about The Lazarus Effect other than its cast and basic premise, which might be for the best if it’s as interesting as it sounds: the film focuses on a band of med students that find a way to bring deceased patients back from the dead. Perhaps the less we know going into the movie, the better. The movie stars Evan Peters, Olivia Wilde, Mark Duplass, and Donald Glover.\n\nMaps to the Stars\n\nRelease Date: February 27 (US), September 26, 2014 (UK) David Cronenberg’s latest opus is an investigation into a Hollywood dynasty; a look into the messed up lives of the Hollywood elite. Packed with talent like Julianne Moore, John Cusack, Mia Wasikowska, and Olivia Williams, Cronenberg’s first film since Cosmopolis is going to be a sight to see, particularly with a subject matter that the filmmaker no doubt feels is close to his heart.\n\nChappie\n\nRelease Date: March 6 (US and UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe latest film from District 9 director Neill Blomkamp, Chappie is a new take on the human/robot relationship. Sharlto Coplley stars – in a motion capture performance -- as Chappie, a new kind of robot that is kidnapped by gangsters and raised in a dysfunctional family. Chappie can learn and feel, and if District 9 is any indictation, Blomkamp is sure to take viewers on one heck of an emotional journey. Chappie co-stars Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver.\n\nThe Coup\n\nRelease Date: March 6 (US and UK)\n\nWhile on a fancy vacation to a southeast Asian getaway, Jack (Owen Wilson) and Annie (Lake Bell) get caught up in a military coup, where foreign visitors are being executed. Desperate for help, they befriend another visitor, one that happens to be a government operative of some kind, and who happens to be played by former 007, Pierce Brosnan. The Coup is directed by As Above, So Below helmer John Erick Dowdle.\n\nUnfinished Business\n\nRelease Date: March 6 (US and UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nDespite his upcoming starring role in HBO’s True Detective Season 2, Vince Vaughn hasn’t quite left the screwball sex comedy behind for good. In Unfinished Business, he stars as a small business owner that heads to Europe to close a life-changing deal, along with his associates, Tom Wilkinson and Dave Franco. However, things go awry and and the gang undergoes a series of mishaps that they would’ve been better off avoiding. Unfinished Business also includes Sienna Miller, James Marsden, Nick Frost, and June Diane Raphael.\n\nThe Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\n\nRelease Date: March 6 (US), February 27 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nJohn Madden’s (Shakespeare in Love) new film is a sequel to its 2011 original. This time around, hotel owner Sonny (Dev Patel) is looking to expand his successful business into a second location and dealing with all of the new predicaments that come along with it, all the while preparing for his coming marriage to the love of his life. Returning are Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy, and Judi Dench, along with series newcomer Richard Gere.\n\nCinderella\n\nRelease Date: March 13 (US), March 27 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThor director Kenneth Branagh returns to the realm of fantasy for Disney’s new live-action adaptation of this classic fairy tale. While 2014’s Maleficent gave the Sleeping Beauty mythos a fresh new twist, Cinderella looks to be more or less the animated classic brought to life. Starring Lily James as Cinderella, Cate Blanchett as her wicked stepmother, Helena Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother, and Richard Madden as Prince Charming, the Cinderella story is sure to capture plenty of hearts yet again when it hits in March.\n\nIn the Heart of the Sea\n\nRelease Date: March 13 (US and UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nDirected by Ron Howard, In the Heart of the Sea is based on Nathaniel Philbrick’s 2000 book about the loss of a ship called Essex in the Pacific Ocean in 1820, a Whaleship that was sunk when it came under attack by a sperm whale. This event would also be an inspiration for Herman Mellville when he wrote Moby-Dick, published in 1851. In the Heart of the Sea reunites Howard with Chris Hemsworth, and also stars Cillian Murphy, Ben Whishaw, and Brendan Gleeson.\n\nParanormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension\n\nRelease Date: March 13 (US and UK)\n\nThere’s next to nothing known about the latest Paranormal Activity film, other than it was delayed from October 2013 to October 2014, and then again until March 2015. It will presumably feature a family that moves into a new home and is subsequently terrorized by a presence in the house. It’s also likely that The Ghost Dimension will bring series thread Katie Featherston back into the fold. Give its title, however, perhaps we can expect a journey into the realm of the undead, a la Insidious.\n\nThe Divergent Series: Insurgent\n\nRelease Date: March 20 (US), March 18 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe hit Divergent series continues in 2015 with Insurgent, the latest chapter that catches up with Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) as she struggles to fight for the ones she loves in the face of war between the various factions that surround her. Forced to choose sides, Tris will have to face her own demons and test loyalties in a way she could never have imagined. Insurgent co-stars Jai Courtney, Theo James, Maggie Q, Naomi Watts, and Kate Winslet.\n\nThe Gunman\n\nRelease Date: March 20 (US), February 20 (UK)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe acclaimed director of Taken, Pierre Morel, is back with another action thriller, this one starring Sean Penn, Idris Elba, Ray Winstone, and Javier Bardem. Penn is a former international spy that’s left to protect himself from the organization he once worked for, who are now out to get him in a big way."
