        "text": "1\n\nSo,\n\nwhat are you gonna do for me?\n\nWe're going to be straight\n\nthat I've had it.\n\nWhat do you say to the fact that...\n\nI'm gonna die?\n\nI'm going to miss you.\n\nF*** that.\n\nI won't know about that.\n\nI need to know\n\nwhat you're worth\n\nwhen I leave you nothing.\n\nWho wants the world at their feet?\n\nIt's confusing, isn't it?\n\nI'll do the best I can.\n\nYou can go knowing that, okay?\n\nYou're me now...\n\nIf you'll have it.\n\n$10,000?\n\nPlayer wins.\n\n$20,000?\n\nPlayer wins.\n\n$40,000?\n\nPlayer wins.\n\nAgain.\n\nAgain!\n\nDouble it. Make it $80,000.\n\nCome on. Mister Lee can cover\n\na lot more than that, buddy.\n\nYou must be new. Double it!\n\n$80,000.\n\nI hope you paid your rent, homes.\n\nI don't pay rent, homes.\n\nWhat's up, man? You got a problem?\n\nIssue of some kind?\n\nYeah, I don't like your f***ing hat.\n\nYou know, I think you kinda\n\nwanted me to have an issue,\n\nso I thought of that one.\n\nI'll see you outside, my friend.\n\nOh, we all got to go\n\noutside sometime, brother.\n\nThis place is just a dream.\n\nYou a gambler?\n\nNot like you.\n\nYou want to f*** around\n\nor you want to cut cards\n\nfor my last $500?\n\nI'll put 10 grand against your $500.\n\nI haven't got 10 grand.\n\nThat's an unequal bet.\n\nIt's a unequal general situation.\n\nWell, f*** it. Get a deck.\n\nThat's funny, no?\n\nI thought you wanted my business card.\n\nCongratulations.\n\nI know you.\n\nI think you're the kind of guy\n\nthat likes to lose.\n\nLife's a losing proposition, right?\n\nYou might as well get it over with.\n\n- Need a stake?\n\n- You like staking losers?\n\nI know how you guys stake people.\n\nThen you know everything.\n\nYour luck is no good tonight.\n\nOh, that depends,\n\nif you give me another $10,000 credit.\n\nYou came in with $10,000 in cash.\n\nYou didn't give it to me.\n\nWell, I mean, this is\n\na gambling establishment.\n\nHave I ever not paid you?\n\nEventually a debt gets too big to pay.\n\nYou owe me $240,000\n\nand I want it in seven days.\n\nHe took it, man.\n\nStake me 50 grand.\n\nAt 20 points.\n\nGive him 50 grand.\n\nYou make sure my man\n\nover here has your digits and so forth.\n\nI feel better about your hat.\n\nThis motherf***er.\n\nThere's 40. I'm going to\n\nkeep back 10, okay?\n\nYou know, you can take the whole 50\n\nagainst my vig,\n\nbut this is a gambling establishment.\n\nI came to play.\n\nJust one blue $10,000 marker, please.\n\nNo, no.\n\nDon't look at anyone.\n\nYou look at me. Just do it.\n\nAnother satisfied customer.\n\nLet's play the two.\n\n$20,000?\n\nHe doesn't want you to look at him.\n\nJust keep dealing the cards.\n\n$40,000.\n\nI'm good.\n\nTake it.\n\nPlayer wins.\n\nDon't look at him. There's no limit.\n\nHe wants to f*** or fight,\n\nand I'm not interested in either.\n\nSo, please, just deal the cards.\n\n- It's for your protection.\n\n- For my protection?\n\nF*** my protection.\n\nYou don't come here\n\nfor f***ing protection from yourself.\n\nYou come for the f***ing opposite.\n\nAnd here I am.\n\nSo, please, deal the cards.\n\nThank you.\n\n$80,000.\n\nPlayer wins.\n\nNo more bets.\n\nYou got me feeling lucky.\n\nI'm putting everything on black.\n\nRed's been coming up all night.\n\nYou want me to pay you now?\n\nIs that what you want me to do?\n\n- No.\n\n- Why not?\n\nMaybe I enjoy watching the show.\n\nWhat about ripping me off outside\n\nif I win?\n\nNot in that business, brother.\n\nEverything on black.\n\nNo more bets.\n\nNineteen, red.\n\nFloat me some spending money.\n\nThat's at 20 points, too.\n\nFirst public notice that was\n\never made of Shakespeare\n\nwas from a Grub Street writer,\n\nRobert Greene,\n\nwho called him an \"upstart crow\n\n\"beautified with our feathers,\"\n\nin the book...\n\nIn the book,\n\nunder that title on the board.\n\nIs the beautified feathers thing because\n\nGreene knew that Shakespeare\n\nwas the Earl of Oxford?\n\nAbsolutely...\n\nNot.\n\nNot even close!\n\nI...\n\nThe Earl of Oxford\n\npublished poetry, okay?\n\nAnd it wasn't any good.\n\nI mean, had Oxford been\n\nable to get a play put on,\n\nhe'd have broken a leg to do it.\n\nI mean, can you think\n\nof any human being\n\nthat would, for any reason,\n\nnot put his name on Hamlet?\n\nThe Oxfordian thing.\n\nThe anti-Stratfordian thing.\n\nWhat pisses people off\n\nabout Shakespeare...\n\nWhat lies behind every controversy\n\nabout Shakespeare\n\nis rage.\n\nRage over the nature\n\nand unequal distribution of talent.\n\nThe rage that genius appears\n\nwhere it appears\n\nfor no material reason at all.\n\nDesiring a thing\n\ncannot make you have it.\n\nNow, the trouble with writing,\n\nif I may bring it up here\n\nin the English Department...\n\n...is we all do a little of it\n\nfrom time to time, writing.\n\nAnd some of us start to think,\n\ndelusionally,\n\nmaybe with a little time,\n\na little peace, a little money in the bank,\n\nand you get that room of your own,\n\nyou think, \"Well, sh*t,\n\n\"I might be a writer, too.\"\n\nI mean, we accept genius in sports\n\nas something we cannot do.\n\nBut it's no more likely that\n\nyou could be a writer that\n\nyou could be what?\n\nAn Olympic pole-vaulter?\n\nBecause what you have to be\n\nbefore you try to be a pole-vaulter...\n\nHello! Is a pole-vaulter, no?\n\n- Yeah!\n\n- You are one.\n\n- A pole-vaulter?\n\n- A novelist.\n\nNo, I am not. For me to be a novelist,\n\nI would have to make a deal with myself,\n\nthat it was okay being\n\na mediocrity in a profession\n\nthat died commercially\n\nin the last century.\n\nAll right, people do that.\n\nI am not one of them.\n\nIf you take away nothing else\n\nfrom my class,\n\nfrom this experience, let it be this...\n\nIf you're not a genius,\n\ndon't bother, all right?\n\nThe world needs plenty of electricians,\n\nand a lot of them are happy.\n\nI'll be f***ed if I'll be a mid-list\n\nnovelist getting good reviews\n\nfrom the people I give good reviews to.\n\nLet's have a look at Dexter. Dexter!\n\nAn ordinary-looking young man\n\nwith a what?\n\nSize 40 jacket, regular features,\n\nand decent dentition,\n\nis the second-ranked\n\ncollegiate tennis player\n\nin the United States of America.\n\nHow did that come about, Dexter?\n\nYou come from a tennis family?\n\nWell, I mean,\n\nI started playing\n\nfive years ago in high school\n\n'cause the tennis guys\n\nhave the best weed.\n\nAfter you started tennis, how long was it\n\nbefore you were better than everybody?\n\nBefore I was better than everybody,\n\nor before I knew it?\n\nWhat happened when you noticed\n\nyou were naturally\n\nbetter than everybody?\n\nI...\n\nI got interested in the game.\n\nThat is an IQ break point,\n\nbrother. Right there!\n\nDo you remember Machiavelli?\n\nThat would have been in September.\n\nMan.\n\nI can remember September.\n\nAll right.\n\nIs it the game, brother, or the money?\n\nVirtu or fama? Fame or virtue?\n\nWhat are you after?\n\nDon't go modest on me.\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nBoth.\n\nYou got ambitious, yeah?\n\nI realised, as I learned about the game,\n\nthat I was in reach of...\n\nIn reach of...\n\nIn reach of...\n\nHighest level?\n\nHighest level, yeah.\n\nHighest level.\n\nBut it's still a gamble, isn't it?\n\nLook, I'm a literature teacher.\n\nI can't write well enough to bother,\n\nor I just don't bother, whichever.\n\nWhichever it is, there'll be\n\nno apotheosis around here.\n\nThere'll be no \"Vae, puto, deus fio!\"\n\naround here.\n\nThat's what Emperor Vespasian\n\nsaid on his deathbed,"
