        "text": "All dates subject to change.\n\nNovember\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\nINTERSTELLAR One minute Matthew McConaughey is driving through the cornfields, worrying about dust storms and famine. The next he’s in outer space with fellow astronauts (Anne Hathaway among them), searching for a new planet where humans can relocate. The trick is that a new wormhole has been discovered, and they can travel a lot farther a lot faster. The cast also includes Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, Ellen Burstyn, John Lithgow, Bill Irwin, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley and Topher Grace. From Christopher Nolan, whose last directorial project was “The Dark Knight Rises.”\n\nNATIONAL GALLERY Over the last half-century or so, Frederick Wiseman has made documentaries about schools, sports arenas, social problems, ballet and Central Park. Now he turns his attention to the National Gallery in London; its masterworks, among them Rembrandts, Vermeers and Caravaggios; and the people who know the art best.\n\nFRIDAY\n\nACTRESS When a woman pushing 40 decides to return to her acting career, relationships suffer and drama ensues; Brandy Burre, the woman going through all of this in real life, plays herself. A documentary directed by Robert Greene."
