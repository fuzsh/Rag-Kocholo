        "text": "Voted and ranked by our community of movie enthusiasts, we present to you the top quotes from the thrilling movie - The Gambler. This 2014 masterpiece directed by Rupert Wyatt follows the story of Jim Bennett, a literature professor with a gambling addiction that leads him down a dangerous path. But what makes this movie so captivating is not just its gripping storyline but also its unforgettable dialogue.\n\nFrom Mark Wahlberg's intense delivery to John Goodman's effortless charm, every line in this film hits hard and leaves an impact long after the credits roll. Whether it's Bennett's nihilistic worldview or Frank's philosophical musings on life, each quote offers a glimpse into the complex psyche of these characters.\n\nBut what sets The Gambler apart from other crime dramas is how it explores themes like addiction, redemption, and human nature through its sharp writing. Every word feels deliberate and purposeful, making for some truly memorable moments that will stick with you for years to come.\n\nSo without further ado, here are the top quotes from The Gambler as voted by our community. Each quote captures the essence of this brilliant film in its own unique way.\n\n1\n\nAn Inappropriate Relationship\n\nAmy Phillips: “If I have to fool you into an inappropriate relationship to get you out of your job, I’m ready to go.”\n\nJim Bennett: “So am I.”\n\n…\n\nJim Bennett: “A real love, a real thing to do everyday and I just rather die if I don’t get it. Did I just say that out loud?”\n\nAmy is relentless in pursuing Jim and he eventually gives in. But it doesn’t take long after they fall in love before her safety is in jeopardy due to his mistakes.\n\nShould this be higher or lower?\n\n2\n\nIf You Don't Have the Magic, Don't Bother\n\nJim Bennett: “If you take away nothing else from my class, let it be this. If you don’t have the magic, don’t bother. Desiring a thing cannot make you have it.”\n\nIn addition to being a gambler, Jim is also a literature professor. Occasionally, though, his two worlds intersect like in this scene when he advises his students based on his gambling career.\n\nShould this be higher or lower?\n\n3\n\nBecause I've Seen You in Your Other Life?\n\nAmy Phillips: “I want to go to a restaurant.”\n\nJim Bennett: “I need you to leave.”\n\nAmy Phillips: “Because I’ve seen you in your other life?”\n\nJim is approached by Amy, a student of his who also saw him gambling. She wants a relationship with him but he resists.\n\nShould this be higher or lower?\n\n4\n\nLet's Deal With This as Gentlemen\n\nFrank: “You owe money to places you shouldn’t. Why do you want door number three?”\n\nJim Bennett: “Because it’s the only way I’ll get out… Let’s just deal with this as gentlemen who understand each other, please.”\n\nFrank: “No! I need for us to treat each other like we’re not gentlemen and that we’re very very stupid.”\n\nFrank doesn’t quite understand or agree with the direction Jim is taking to try to get himself out of a bind. When Jim tries to smooth things over, Frank brings him back to reality and lays out how this conversation will go down.\n\nShould this be higher or lower?\n\n5\n\nWhat's Wrong With You?\n\nFrank: “Birth, education, intelligence, talent, looks, I’ve seen you be half a million dollars up.”\n\nJim Bennett: “I’ve been up two-and-a-half million dollars.”\n\nFrank: “What’s wrong with you? You got brain damage?”\n\nFrank gives Jim some tough love. He’s been making poor decisions and getting into trouble, almost as if he has something wrong with his head.\n\nShould this be higher or lower?\n\n6\n\nNothing's Okay\n\nRoberta: “My family has been with this bank since my father in law started it.”\n\nBank Official: “Are you a relation?”\n\nRoberta: “This is my son.”\n\nJim Bennett: “Either you can’t see the uncanny resemblance or you’re implying she’s under duress.”\n\nRoberta: “Now what I want is $260,000 in cash.”\n\nBank Official: “Is everything okay?”\n\nRoberta: “When someone needs that amount of money in cash, nothing’s okay.”\n\nRoberta and son Jim head to the bank to withdraw money. When questioned about the withdrawal, Roberta notes that no one asks for that much cash when everything is okay. Indeed, things for Jim are not good.\n\nShould this be higher or lower?"
