        "text": "The Gambler, directed by Rupert Wyatt and starring Mark Wahlberg is a film that centreâ€™s on the troubles Jim Bennet.\n\nBennett, played by Wahlberg is a man whose continued self destructive behaviour, especially at the most unexpected times, makes it clear to the audience early on, that here is an individual in the midst of a very serious existential crisis.\n\nItâ€™s apparent that Bennet has pain, but youâ€™ll have to use your imagination for a much deeper explanation than the familial issues hinted at more than twice.\n\nThis isnâ€™t the type of movie that plays easy. Some may even accuse Wyattâ€™s film of being somewhat uneven. True or not, the audience is definitely never left comfortable.\n\nEither the viewer is quite rightly concerned for Bennettâ€™s safety and the safety of those he cares about or theyâ€™re worried as to why he really doesnâ€™t seem to care much about the consequences of his seemingly reckless actions.\n\nThe best thing about The Gambler for me, besides the individual performances (John Goodman being a particular highlight), is the dialogue. An element most would have had a taster of in the very well executed promotional trailer a few months earlier.\n\nMy exposure to Mark Wahlbergâ€™s work has been largely focused on his comedic roles, so this was an overdue and welcome difference.\n\nHappy The Gambler ðŸ™‚\n\nG"
