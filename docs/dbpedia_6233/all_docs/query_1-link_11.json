Always a risk-taker, Bennett bets it all when he borrows from a gangster and offers his own life as collateral. Staying one step ahead, he pits his creditor against the operator of an illicit gambling ring while garnering the attention of Frank, a paternalistic loan shark. As his relationship with a student deepens, Bennett must risk everything for a second chance.",

        "text": "the movie is largely a chore until near the end when John Goodman comes out of nowhere looking like Baron Harkonnen & makes an absolute meal out of his five mins of screen time. Its not enough to recommend the full movie, but the scene itself is worth pulling up on youtube.\n\nThis movie’s saving grace is that it understands that every member of organized crime is really just some guy who wants to talk at you while you’re forced to sit in silence and drink the most disgusting rum & coke you’ve ever had in your life\n\nI pretty much hated this film.\n\nReasons why:\n\n* I like Mark Wahlberg as an actor, but he has a limited range. This character WAS NOT in that range. Here he is a freaking novelist turned college English professor. NO. No, no, no, no, no. No. It might be his least believable character since THE HAPPENING. When he was trying to deliver his badass lines in the film all I could see was Dirk DIggler performing the terrible script with his limited acting abilities from the movie-within-a-movie in BOOGIE NIGHTS.\n\n* This script is atrocious! Nearly every line was flat and just idiotic. None of the motivations made any sense, none of the character actions were anything that any real…\n\nFocusing more on the unshakable drive to place one more bet than the crushing melancholy of loss, Rupert Wyatt's \"The Gambler\" gives a new shine to the age-old tale of ill-fated bettors. Starring Mark Wahlberg as a literature professor with a gaming problem, the film provides sharp drama and engaging characters.\n\nFollowing Wahlberg's addict as he builds up tremendous debt to feed his habit, \"The Gambler\" treats its audience to both minor character study and plot-driven drama. Colliding with characters that help and hinder him, the gambler sees his life unravel as his debtors begin to squeeze his very existence.\n\nWyatt assembles a drama that is sleek and potent enough to lead to something occasionally gripping. Wahlberg creates a character…\n\nFirst of all I understand that a 4.5 rating for this movie is fairly unique so let me explain myself. I would like to agree that the writing and directing can seem a little disorganized through this movie. A few instances throughout the first time watching this I wasn't able to keep up. Inappropriate relationship with his student, family woes, gambling issues with multiple groups of people, specific students he connects with, former author, and current professor at what seems to be a pretty good school in..... wait where was this filmed? (Couldn't resist looking it up, it's mostly in LA and partially Las Vegas). There's so much to focus on, but at the same time, this film is named…\n\nNot a single, solitary, itty bitty piece of me wants to spend two hours watching a pompous rat bleed out every positive moment in his miserable little life, and that's what I just did.\n\nMark Wahlberg has some talent. I've enjoyed several of his films in the past, most notably The Departed, The Fighter, and The Other Guys were all vastly enjoyable. For every good movie he's had, he seems to sign on to like 3 more horrendous scripts. Although his acting is great in this...\n\nThe behavior his character exhibits is exhausting. I knew a fella very much like him, and we have since parted ways for what are about to very obvious reasons: it's incomparable how self destructive…"
