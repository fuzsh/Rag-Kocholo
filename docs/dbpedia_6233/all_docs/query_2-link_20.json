        "text": "During the early ’90s, while he was flashing his abs and modeling underwear as Marky Mark, few could have suspected that beneath Mark Wahlberg’s b-boy cap lurked the soul of a thespian. Now, that’s no longer the case — with dozens of roles and a pair of Academy Award nominations to his credit, Wahlberg has compiled an impressive filmography since making his big-screen debut in Danny DeVito’s 1994 comedy Renaissance Man. Since then, he’s branched out quite a bit, showing a flair for drama (Boogie Nights), comedy (Ted), and blockbuster action (Shooter, the Transformers franchise) along the way. It’s never a bad time to look back on Mr. Wahlberg’s career — and with that in mind, we’ve rounded up all of his major roles, sorting the bunch by Tomatometer. Where do your favorites rank? Read on to find out.\n\n#43\n\nMax Payne (2008) 16%\n\n#43\n\nAdjusted Score: 21215%\n\nCritics Consensus: While it boasts some stylish action, Max Payne suffers severely from an illogical plot and overdirection.\n\nSynopsis: After the murders of his family and his partner, maverick cop Max (Mark Wahlberg) becomes hell-bent on revenge. Teamed with... [More]\n\nDirected By: John Moore\n\n#42\n\nTransformers: The Last Knight (2017) 16%\n\n#42\n\nAdjusted Score: 30051%\n\nCritics Consensus: Cacophonous, thinly plotted, and boasting state-of-the-art special effects, The Last Knight is pretty much what you'd expect from the fifth installment of the Transformers franchise.\n\nSynopsis: Humans are at war with the Transformers, and Optimus Prime is gone. The key to saving the future lies buried... [More]\n\nDirected By: Michael Bay\n\n#41\n\nRenaissance Man (1994) 12%\n\n#41\n\nAdjusted Score: 13082%\n\nCritics Consensus: Renaissance Man tries to simultaneously be a literary comedy, an inspirational drama, and a star vehicle that caters to Danny DeVito's strengths, but proves to be a master of none.\n\nSynopsis: After getting canned from his advertising job, down-and-out divorcé Bill Rago (Danny DeVito) gets a gig teaching English at a... [More]\n\nDirected By: Penny Marshall\n\n#40\n\nThe Happening (2008) 18%\n\n#40\n\nAdjusted Score: 25422%\n\nCritics Consensus: The Happening begins with promise, but unfortunately descends into an incoherent and unconvincing trifle.\n\nSynopsis: An apocalyptic threat to humanity arrives out of the clear blue sky with a series of violent, inexplicable deaths spreading... [More]\n\nDirected By: M. Night Shyamalan\n\n#39\n\nTransformers: Age of Extinction (2014) 18%\n\n#39\n\nAdjusted Score: 28046%\n\nCritics Consensus: With the fourth installment in Michael Bay's blockbuster Transformers franchise, nothing is in disguise: Fans of loud, effects-driven action will find satisfaction, and all others need not apply.\n\nSynopsis: After an epic battle, a great city lies in ruins, but the Earth itself is saved. As humanity begins to... [More]\n\nDirected By: Michael Bay\n\n#38\n\nMile 22 (2018) 23%\n\n#38\n\nAdjusted Score: 33423%\n\nCritics Consensus: Mile 22 lets the bullets fly -- and not much else -- in a thrill-deficient action thriller whose title proves sadly fitting for a film that feels close to a marathon endurance test.\n\nSynopsis: CIA operative James Silva leads a small but lethal paramilitary team on an urgent and dangerous mission. They must transport... [More]\n\nDirected By: Peter Berg\n\n#37\n\nDaddy's Home 2 (2017) 21%\n\n#37\n\nAdjusted Score: 27560%\n\nCritics Consensus: A formulaic comedy that's unlikely to spread much yuletide merriment, Daddy's Home 2 can only muster a few stray yuks from its talented cast.\n\nSynopsis: Father and stepfather Dusty and Brad join forces to make Christmastime perfect for the children. Their newfound partnership soon gets... [More]\n\nDirected By: Sean Anders\n\n#36\n\nBroken City (2013) 27%\n\n#36\n\nAdjusted Score: 33748%\n\nCritics Consensus: Broken City's thinly sketched, formulaic script offers meager rewards for all but the least demanding noir aficionados.\n\nSynopsis: Former cop Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) sees a chance at redemption for past sins when New York City's Mayor Nicolas... [More]\n\nDirected By: Allen Hughes\n\n#35\n\nMojave (2015) 32%\n\n#35\n\nAdjusted Score: 34814%\n\nCritics Consensus: Mojave has no shortage of talent on either side of the camera; unfortunately, it amounts to little more than a frustrating missed opportunity.\n\nSynopsis: A down-and-out artist (Garrett Hedlund) has a dangerous and shocking encounter with an evil drifter (Oscar Isaac) in the desert,...
