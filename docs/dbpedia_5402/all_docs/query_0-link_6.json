        "text": "All library branches will be closed Monday, Sept. 2, for Labor Day. We will resume regular operating hours on Tuesday, Sept. 3. Book drops will remain open during this closure and our virtual services such as e-books, databases, and downloadables are available 24/7.\n\nThe Hastings Branch Library is closed for approximately one month to relocate to the W.E. Harris Community Center, located at 400 E. Harris St., on Tuesday, Sept. 3. This move is a necessary step in the planned construction of a new community center and library, which St. Johns County anticipates opening in Fall 2025. For more information about this closure please visit the Hastings closure page on our website.\n\nBeginning the afternoon of Thursday, Aug. 29, the Main Branch Library will be undergoing some maintenance that will have minimal impact to service through the end of business on Friday, Aug. 30. During this time, there will be no access to public computers and printing. Additionally, entry into the Childrenâ€™s Department may be temporarily restricted. Patrons will be able to check in and out materials, pick up holds, browse the adult collections, or read and study in the adult sitting areas."
