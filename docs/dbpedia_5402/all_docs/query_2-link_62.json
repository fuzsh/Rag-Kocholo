So, let’s explore the telegraph and learn how it helped shape communication technologies used today.\n\n\"I love the blend of Richmond history along with science education experiences. They go above and beyond to switch up their offerings and discussions so we learn something every time we visit. The exhibits are very interactive for the kids, too. The programs – Rat Basketball, planetarium shows and more – are great.\"\n\nThis is by far the best science center I have ever been to. The kids had so much fun playing around and learning. I would have to say one of my favorite parts were playing air hockey with a robot, probably the neatest thing I've ever done. I would love to go back. We traveled two hours to get here and it was well worth the trip.\n\nThis should be the model for museums everywhere. So interactive and leaves you wanting more. I brought my 2 year old and now I want to go back by myself to play, lol! My husband can’t stop talking about the pendulum. I want MORE cowbell!! I really don’t have the words to say how much I can’t wait to go back. You should go."
