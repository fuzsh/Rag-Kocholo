        "text": "About Neptune\n\nDark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant major planet orbiting our Sun.\n\nMore than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is not visible to the naked eye. The planet’s blue color comes from methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red wavelengths of light, but allows blue ones to be reflected back into space – very much like its neighbor, Uranus. Neptune was the first planet located using math. German astronomer Johann Galle was the first to observe the planet in 1846. The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea.\n\nGet the Facts\n\nNeptune by the Numbers\n\nHow big is Neptune? How far is it from the Sun?\n\nUse this tool to compare Neptune to Earth, and other planets.\n\nRead More\n\nNeptune Exploration\n\nGalileo recorded Neptune as a fixed star during observations with his small telescope in 1612 and 1613.\n\nMore than 200 years later, the ice giant became the first planet located through mathematical predictions rather than through observations of the sky. In 1989, NASA's Voyager 2 became the first-and only-spacecraft to study Neptune up close.\n\nRead More\n\nNeptune Moons\n\nNeptune has 16 known moons.\n\nEnglish merchant and astronomer William Lassell discovered the first and largest of Neptune's moon – Triton – on Oct. 10, 1846, just 17 days after a Berlin observatory discovered Neptune. We don't know if Lassell had a celebratory beverage after he discovered Triton, but beer helped make the finding possible. Lassell was one of 19th century England's grand amateur astronomers. He used the fortune he made in the brewery business to finance his telescopes.\n\nExplore Neptune's Moons"
