        "text": "You may be looking for the Star Trek zine, Farthest Star.\n\nZine Title: Beyond the Farthest Star Publisher: Nova Press & Orion Press, later agented/distributed through Bill Hupe Editor(s): Randall Landers & Linda McInnis, L. Marcusky, Linda P. Baker, Peg Kennedy & Bill Hupe Date(s): 1985-1995 Series?: Medium: print Size: Genre: gen and het Fandom: Star Trek: TNG, Star Trek: TOS Language: English External Links: Click here for related articles on Fanlore.\n\nBeyond the Farthest Star is a gen and adult het anthology. Issues #1-4 were edited and published by Orion Press and later issues were published by Peg Kennedy and Bill Hupe.\n\nFrom the first issue: \"This fanzine is oriented toward adult, heterosexual Star Trek fiction, and as such, may not be sold to minors. This publication is not intended to violate community standards or good taste.\"\n\nTitle Change\n\nA title change makes this zine tricky!\n\nIt continued for two issues as Supernova and then reverted to its original title:\n\nThe first four issues are available as reprints from us... Issues 5 and 6 were published by Elizabeth Burnham/Nova Press and are available from under her title of Supernova 5-6, to avoid confusion with us when 'Beyond the Farthest Star' reverted back to us. Make sense? It does avoid having two zines with the same title available from two people at once, especially as Elizabeth has continued her series, and is at least at issue 8 by now.[1]\n\nContent Change: No More F/F\n\nThe editorial in the fourth issue addresses sexual content, labeling, and double-standards:\n\nFinally, when I told Randy about not having an idea for this editorial, he said, \"I do. Answer Laurie Haynes' letter.\" Well, since the subject she brought up was one about which there has been an ongoing dialogue among Orion Press editors and publishers, it seemed like a good idea. First, Laurie's letter:\n\n\"I quite recently picked up BEYOND THE FARTHEST STAR #2 and #3. I enjoyed them, although there wasn't enough Kirk for my tastes. I agree with Linda McInnis in wanting a story that has more than just explicit sex — the sex should be PART of the story, not all of the story. If this is a heterosexual zine, why the woman/woman stuff?. . . [Your consultants]... need to look up the definition of the word \"homosexual\". Woman/woman is just as much homosexuality... as K/S. Also, just as some heterosexual men find woman/woman a turn on, some heterosexual women find K/S a turn on. Can't understand it, but each to their own.\"\n\nI had asked the same questions about female/female contact, not because I object to the story — I can't, I wrote it — but because I object to the description \"heterosexual\" for BTFS if we're going to run \"/\" material. I wanted to drop the label, but no one else wants to get rid of it, and frankly, I can't think of an acceptable alternative myself.\n\nAlso, I strongly object to the idea that \"female/female sex is more acceptable than male/male sex and not really considered outside the realm of heterosexuality by most people\", which is an explanation I've received from more than one acquaintance. I agree that opinion is held by many, but it smacks too much of a double standard for this feminist. And for her publishers, too.\n\nDouble standard and sexism aside, the problem is primarily one of labeling and meeting the expectations of our readers. If we're saying we're a thing, then we have to be that. So, Laurie and readers, BTFS will no longer run stories involving \"/\" material or any kind, including female/female.\n\nHowever, for those of you out there who'd still like to see \"/\" material, we're offering a solution. If we have enough author interest, we're going to publish a strictly / zine in 1991. As before, if there's a particular couple you'd like to see but you're not a writer, just drop me a line. I'll get one of our many prolific authors on it. And if you are a writer, my mailbox is waiting. No K/S please, not because we dislike K/S or object to it, but simply because there're plenty of good zines for that out there already. We just and to be different.\n\nGeneral Reactions and Reviews\n\nI would like to recommend the following two adult zines: BEY0ND THE FARTHEST STAR #1 and #2. I find them to be very well written—stories are well done, not just reasons to get our favorite characters into bed. And since there are no \"/\" stories, I feel more comfortable reading these zines, because, even though I may be wrong, I have a hard time believing any of the well-known ENTERPRISE crewmembers engage in \"/\" behavior. I know a lot of people like these types of stories, and that is fine with me, I am simply happy to find a well-written adult fanzine which deals with male-female relationships which I find much more believable! I would recommend these two zines to anyone who feels the way I do! [2]\n\nIssue 1\n\nBeyond the Farthest Star 1 was published in May 1985 and is 67 pages long. Randall Landers and Linda McInnis (L. Marcusky?) were the editors.\n\nThe art is by Rick Endres, Pat Kilner, and Gennie Summers.\n\nFrom the editorial by Landers:\n\nPorno? Me?!\n\nSo why did I do it? Why did I decide to print an adult-oriented Star Trek fanzine? Because I'm nuts. Ask anybody that knows me! Ask Tim, Linda, Christina or anyone else! Ask anybody that's ever heard of me! They'll tell you. I'm absolutely bonkers, nuts, crazy, fucked in the head, insane, weirdsville...but that's entirely irrelevant...not to mention besides the point.\n\nI'm printing BEYOND THE FARTHEST STAR for several reasons. One: It's an experiment. All of you are guinea pigs, from the contributors to the readers. I want to know (this is \"Two\", if you're keeping track!) if a male and female can work together to produce erotica acceptible [sic] to both sexes. I want to know if a hetero-sexual, adult Trekzine can sell as well as an action-adventure zine. I'm seeing if we can attract new readers to my ORION PRESS and its publications. I'm doing it on a dare. I'm doing it for the hell of it. Let's just say, \"No comment.'\n\nSo, I went ahead and did it. I printed this thing. With lots of sex scenes, nudity, rough language, and everything! But is it pornographic? (I'm sure our beloved critics will be calling this the Hustler of Star Trek fanzines!) But I hope it's not porn. I want it as erotic as possible. But not pornographic.\n\nDid you know there was a major staff discussion on \"How far should we go\"? Hot only in reference to the story content, but the artwork as well. We reviewed many adult ST zines and came to the conclusions that we could print any story scenes. But we decided we couldn't go as far as \"XXX\" on the artwork. Why not? I'm not sure. There were many zines which did have \"XXX\" artwork, but all of them were K/S. So we opted for X-rated artwork. Hard-core, I supposed, by some people's standards, but we opted not to print the, to employ the vernacular, \"cum shots\". There are some \"insertion shots\", and if you find them upsetting and undesirable in future issues, please write and let me know, and we'll purge them suckers.\n\nI had a lot of fear and trepidation about publishing this zine, and I want to make it perfectly clear that I am willing to alter the contents somewhat, if public outcries warrant it. It's our first attempt, so please forgive us if we unintentionally offend you.\n\nFrom the editorial by Linda:\n\nRandy called me out of the blue and asked me to do this editorial even though I have no story in this issue. For me, this is a particularly timely 'zine. The current edition of Ms magazine poses an intriguing question on its front cover: \"Is one woman's sexuality another woman's pornography?\" No doubt about it, it's a volatile subject. Because how do we define pornography? Randy states in the beginning that he hopes the zine comes across as erotic, rather than pornographic. I've got to disagree with him. At least on the erotic part, as the zine is not erotic. For me, explicit is not equal to erotic—quite the opposite, in fact. Witness, the current hit movie starring Harrison Ford, is one of the most erotic films I've seen in a long time. And except for one scene of a bare chested woman bathing after a long day's work, there are no \"flesh\" scenes. Yet the whole film was charged with a sexuality that most \"sexfilms\" never even approach.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't know if I would label this 'zine completely porno, either. There's a spirit of fun and tongue-in-cheek attitude that seems to be lacking in a lot of hard-core porn. To me, hard core stuff is really vicious, designed to hurt and brutalize. And I don't get that feeling from BTFS.\n\nSo where do we go from here? If we get two letters stating a great deal of offense and none supporting us, do we stop? Even if we sell 50 or 100 issues? Often people who are dissatisfied usually make more noise than those who are content, even though their numbers may be the same. If it sells like crazy, do we stop all the other phases of Orion Press and go 100% X-rated? The questions and implications are infinite, and we can only progress by a process of trial and error. Many women decry pornography because they believe it degrades women, makes them into objects instead of people. Is this issue of BTFS aiding that degradation? As you can see from the table of contents, both men and women were involved in its production, and certainly no one was forced to participate if they felt offended. We sent out a very clear age statement and content description to Datazine and Universal Translator, so if you bought this, you knew what you would get, and no one forced you to send in your money.\n\nI certainly would not compare BTFS with Playboy, Penthouse, or Hustler, but the point is this: once a group defines \"pornography\" per se, and begins to limit publication of that type of material, then it will become all too easy to include more & more literature under that heading and stop its publication. Censorship we don't need. If you don't like it, don't support it, work on changing attitudes rather than hiding the problem behind forbidden doors. The forbidden is attractive to many, and the more you tell someone \"don't\", the more they may want to \"do.\"\n\nBTFS is not a grand statement in favor of the First Amendment. But, we are lucky we live in a place where we can put out a zine like this. We, at Orion Press, are Trekkin' in many ways. Above all, we try to remember I.D.I.C. Thanks for listening!\n\nSummaries below from the Zinedex:\n\nBeyond, editorial by Randall Landers (2)\n\nReputation by Randal; Landers and Linda Marcusky (On shore leave on Argelius, first Kirk, and then Scotty and McCoy are captured by slavers intent on turning them into mindless sexually enhanced \"sexoids\" - but not before they've entertained themselves with their new toys. The slavers bemoan their discovery that while Kirk's technique might be up to his reputation, his equipment definitely is not - and they make some corrections (to Uhura's later delight).

It has art by Linda P. Baker, Mark Cantrell, Julie Cesari, Rick Endres, Gennie Summers, and Marie Williams.\n\nThis zine was nominated for a Fan Q as Best Star Trek Fanzine.\n\nFrom the first editorial by Linda:\n\nHello and welcome to BEYOND THE FARTHEST STAR #2! The overwhelming response we've gotten and are still getting) to BTFS#1 sold us on the idea of doing a second issue....\n\nWhat's in store for you this trip to BEYOND? Veil, I've tried to give you a blend of things. We've got some humor and craziness, as well as some more serious sexy stuff, but I think all of it will give you a little rush.\n\nWe're lucky to have several new contributors for this issue, and our first story is by one of them, a good friend of mine, Don Vaughan. Don's a wild a crazy guy from Greenacres (the place to be), Florida, and he Joins us with the story, \"Power Failure,\" which, given the nature of this 'zine, is pretty self-explanatory.\n\nDon joins us again In the last story of this issue, along with his wife, Han, and his cronies Jerry Shaw, Pat Repper, Mark Cantrell, and Sean Broderick. They've combined their talents and their drunkenness to produce \"The Adventures of Lacy Bottoms.\" This is not technically a Star Trek story, but it's got enough twists and turns (not to mention bumps and grinds) to keep you in stitches. Enjoy this one!\n\nYours truly decided she couldn't follow the comedy act set by Vaughan and company, so she went for the more serious side of things. \"Southern Comfort\" is a McCoy story, so all the Bones fans out there, here's one for you!\n\n\"All That Glitters\" comes from another of our new authors. Linda is from Mobile, Alabama, and works for one of the newspapers there. She's given us a gem of a Spock/Christine story, an erotic fantasy that I found very effective. I hope Linda will contribute to us again.\n\nRemember Maltz? The Klingon that \"did not deserve to live\"? Does anybody know what happened to him? Well, Rick Endres has one theory, and it's one that Maltz may not be too unhappy with, in spite of being a political prisoner!! Read on and find out what I mean.\n\nArtwork this issue is by Julie Cesari (who provided a poem as well), Rick Endres, Linda Baker, and Mark Cantrell, who also appeared in \"Lacy Bottoms.\" Hmm, that last sentence didn't come out exactly the way I meant it to. Sorry, Mark, you know what I mean. Mark's a cartoonist who's done work for Starlog magazine, and writes for his own comic book, Space Ark. Thanks for your help! Oh, there are also some \"fillos\" by Gennie Summers....\n\nThat's the zine, folks. I hope you enjoy it, and whether you do or don't, I really want to hear from you. Your opinions are important to us -- let us hear you!. Okay, enough of a sermon, it's time fro some good, dirty fun BEYOND....\n\nThe second editorial by Linda:\n\nSo now you've come to the end of BEYOND THE FARTHEST STAR 2. Maybe there are still a few questions remaining. Like, why do a second issue of an X-rated zine when ORION is a pretty straightforward action/adventure publication? And, will we do more X-rated issues?\n\nThe reason that I specifically wanted to edit this issue was that I was not entirely happy with BTFS 1. I felt the stories were too \"mechanical.\" And, at the risk of sounding sexist (sorry. Randy), I wanted to see if the finished product would be different with a woman at the helm instead of a man.\n\nI believe it is. I wanted to see if we could be explicit and erotic; explicit, funny and erotic; or just plain erotic; as opposed to \"porno\" or simply explicit. I believe we were.\n\nI wanted to know if we could still have a good story, along with the erotic parts, with believable characters, that readers could sympathize with, both in bed and out. I believe we did.\n\nOf course, with one issue of BTFS under our belts (or below them, as it were!), I was lucky enough to have some guidelines, both for what I wanted and what I didn't want. My thanks to Randy, Linda, Rick and other \"trailblazers\" in BTFS 1.\n\nIn a number of stories, I looked for what I find erotic as a woman. Quite honestly, it's difficult for me to escape that viewpoint completely! But I like to laugh, too, and sex is often less than decorous, so I wanted something funny or every farcical. I think an the whole, there's a nice mix here.\n\nNow, I send out the perennial editor's plea: let us know! As of this writing, it looks like BTFS will be an annual publication for ORION PRODUCTIONS, and that I will be handling future issues. If you have a suggestion — send it on!\n\nFinally, regarding this genre as a whole, there are those who would label us \"immoral,\" \"dangerous,\" \"depraved\" and other, less flattering things for \"sinking to the depths\" of BTFS, I think our back cover sums up any feelings I have on that.\n\nLike it or not, love, lust and sex are prime subjects of interest in the Human species. So, if we're going to be tempted by such literature anyway, my humble opinion is, it might as well be good!\n\nThanks for reading, thanks for your LoCs, and thanks for your support.

It contains a mixture of ST and ST:TNG stories.\n\nThe art is by Linda P. Baker, Mark Cantrell, Julie Cesari, and Jay Harmon.\n\nAccording to Media Monitor, issue #3 includes some F/F.\n\nFrom IDIC #1:\n\nThis zine continues the excellent tradition of strictly heterosexual Trek stories, both Next Gen and Original Trek, including Worf's fantasy of a threesome with Tasha Yar, a Chapel/Uhura/Spock story, and 'Pleasing Dreams and Slumbers Light' by Linda Baker in which all the Next Generation characters lay each other in their own personal dreams.\n\nFrom the first editorial:\n\nWell, you did it. You told us you liked it and you wanted more. BEYOND THE FARTHEST STAR #2 was more popular than I ever thought it would be. So much so that it garnered a Fan Q nomination. As I type this, Space Trek is in progress, so I don't know who will win, but let me tell you, being nominated is an honor. Thank you, all who voted.\n\nIssue number 3 is a hot little number if I say so myself! Back when #2 was in the bag, I decided to try for a \"theme\" issue the next time, and the theme I chose was fantasy/dream sequence. Apparently, that hit a nerve, because stories started rolling in. I'll give you a quick rundown and then let you loose.\n\nOur lead story is Next Generation, written by Linda Baker, who gave us \"All That Glitters\" lastish. \"And Pleasing Dreams, And Slumbers Light\" is a poignant, touching story, in addition to being incredibly erotic. This one will really get you started.\n\nAnn Zewen had a feeling of \"Deja Vu\" in her story, and, speaking for myself, I could handle that fantasy quite easily...\n\nWe have a new author with us in this issue. Chris Dickenson is from Missouri and it's not called the \"Show Me\" state for nothing. She showed a side of our favorite chief engineer that's never been seen before. I guarantee you'11 like this one.\n\nWhat's the Mirror Spock really like? Linda Baker has a good idea.\n\nRead on. Don Vaughan returns in this issue with a gem of a Worf story for those of you wondering why the Federation formed an alliance with the Klingons, well, it was quite simple really. . .\n\nLinda Baker returns twice more with \"On Things to Come,\" and \"The Big Diversion.\" In the first, a dream is about to come true for Spock, and in the second, a Next Generation story based on \"The Big Goodbye,\" Picard gets more than he bargained for in 1941.\n\nRandy Landers has our favorite helmsman teaching martial arts and a few other things in 'The Lesson.\" Are Vulcans Peeping Toms? And while Sulu is having fun, Ann Zewen has Chekov trying to get out of an uncomfortable predicament in \"Enthralled,\" with pleasant results, I might add.\n\n\"Muffle Me Night, A While\" is a line from Romeo and Juliet that has intrigued me for a long time. Thinking about Saavik and her obsession with her performance on the Kobyashi Maru test gave me an idea about how she might have passed the 'night after her ordeal.\n\nArt this issue is by Linda Baker, Julie Cesari, and Jay Harmon. For those interested, Jay will have prints of several of his Trek portraits available at WorldCon -- you might want to look for them. Mark Cantrell, of Lacy Bottoms fame, is back with two more great cartoons, and we have a new typist, Audrey Vest. She bravely muddled through my typos and handwritten hieroglyphics to put out clean copies of everything. Thanks a million, Audrey!\n\nIssue Number 3 is fully twice the size of Number 2. I hope you enjoy reading the stories as much as I did, and if you do or don't, let us know why. We got at least one new author that way this issue -- so who knows? Next time it could be you! It's time, go BEYOND — and enjoy!\n\nFrom the second editorial:\n\nI love going to science fiction and Star Trek conventions. I enjoy the panel discussions, thrill at seeing the guests, always welcome a stay in a nice hotel, and especially, look forward to the dealer's room where I can find good deals on fanzines that I've wanted, and not have to pay postage.\n\nWell, no more. The last few cons I've been to have been real disappointments, at least as far as the dealer's rooms went. First and foremost, 'zines were at a minimum, and what few there were looked to be the remnants of someone's collection that the dealer was simply trying to get rid of.\n\nBut the worst part was the price. I am not a rich person. Hell, if I didn't have the good fortune to have wonderful parents who let me live with them, I'd probably be on welfare. So, when I do get to a con, it's a treat — something I've probably saved my money for for six months or more. At the last con I went to (I won't mention names, but I imagine the situation has been repeated all over the country), I saw a copy of Orion 24, a 'zine that I had a story in, selling for $25.00. While 24 is a large issue, it is not an out-of-print 'zine. In fact it can easily be ordered from our publisher at almost half the price that the dealer was asking, and that includes postage! So much for saving money.\n\nOne of the big things that has kept me in fandom for so long has been a sense of honesty and idealism that I found in most fans that I've met or corresponded with. I hope that this 'zine gouging trend is not a sign that these traits are becoming \"unfashionable.\" It is true that many fans will buy anything that has the words \"Star Trek\" on it, and that is sad, for in their zeal to own everything Trek-ish, people are getting ripped off.\n\nI do fanzines because it's something I love to do. I don't make any money off of it at all. In fact, this morning I had to go and make 130 copies and buy postage enough to mail them twice. It took the better part of $25.00. Believe me, I do not spend $25.00 easily, so I must love this crazy hobby. I guess what I'm trying to tell you, readers, is watch out. Practice that old caveat emptor, and beware. Check around on prices. You do at the grocery store, do the same in the dealer's room. Ask for a catalog, if possible. Get the address of the editor and send a SASE, and most of all, let the groups who plan the conventions know that you know you're being ripped off. They control who gets tables in the dealer's rooms. They can exercise their authority and see that fans get what they ought to have — fair pricing and a good selection of Trek memorabilia. Be a smart consumer, and if you think the price is too high, or the item shoddy — tell someone. Don't be a sheep!\n\nWell, that's my soapbox for this issue. I welcome any and all comments, friendly or otherwise. As always, I send out my call for LoC's. If we get enough, we may have a lettered at the beginning of #4. Just tell us what you want, and we'11 try to give it to you. Can you ask for anything more? I think not! Be good.\n\nEditorial (2)\n\nAnd Pleasing Dreams and Slumbers Light by Linda P.

Baker\n\nReactions and Reviews: Issue 3\n\n[zine]: Beyond the Farthest Star 3 was the best yet, and Beyond the Farthest Star 2 was a hard act to beat, (pun intended) Let's see, where to start? \"And Pleasing Dreams and Slumbers Light\" by Linda P. Baker was a delightful, rambling tale with enough combinations to satisfy everyone. I particularly liked the scene with Picard and Tasha. That's one use of the horseshoe I'm sure the Starfleet engineers never anticipated! The shower scene between Beverly/Jack which turns into Beverly/Wtl! was very well done. Never having been a fan of Riker, he was probably the last male character that I'd fantasize about, but Linda made him sound so good, I was tempted to order out for \"Number One, hold the uniform!\" That game they were playing on the holo-deck, now that's a.creative use of leisure time! I loved Tasha stalking the men, and thought her choice of Worf for a partner was so right. Kllngon sex may be dangerous for a Human female, but I'm with Tasha, some things are worth the risk!\n\n\"DeJaVu\" by Ann Zewen...My, my! Now that's the kind of sandwich I can get into! \"Bones is already awake, indeed!\" I just roared over that line. Wonderful idea, Ann.\n\n\"Mirror Dreams\" by Linda P. Baker was surprisingly good. My complaint is that she stopped just when it was getting good...\n\nI didn't care much for \"Diary Consequences\", by Don Vaughan, maybe because I couldn't picture Worf writing chatty letters to Mom and Dad. Oh well, Infinite Diversity!\n\n\"On Things To Come\", by Linda P. Baker, poor Spock! Exactly what did he have Golden add to her emergency survival kit at the last minute, a french tickler and a yem-ylegh? How about some Stokallne to keep his strength up? Now, that story gives new meaning to the words \"landing party\". Emphasis on the party! I*m betting Christine and Uhura tinkered with his computer. I wouldn't put anything past those two. \"Permission to join the landing party, Sir? Please!\"\n\nRandy Landers took us back to the Cooper in \"The Lesson\", giving Xon yet another glimpse of Human behavior. I loved the young Vulcan's matter-of-factness, and Sulu...ah, Sulu. He can take my helm control any day!\n\n\"Enthralled\", by Ann Zewen, didn't enthrall me. I like my Chekov with a dash of experience, and although there was nothing technically wrong with Ann's story, it just didn't trip my trigger. I did enjoy the scene with Sulu, though. \"Don't call me tiny,\" has new meaning for me now.\n\nI had mixed emotions about Linda P. Baker's \"The Big Diversion\". I had a difficult time reconciling Picard and Crusher's arousal with the historian bleeding to death in the next room. Crusher's character always scored high In believability with me, because I could sense her devotion to her profession. I'm a nurse, and I know I would have a hard time getting passionate with a patient of mine dying just a few yards away. The last thing on Crusher's or Picard's minds right then would have been sex. They're both too dedicated to their official duties. However, Linda's detail and grasp of the characters beyond that initial faulty premise was so tantalizing, I lost my Indignation rather quickly. She captured their thought processes so believably, and Picard is so Picard! The twist of Beverly and Tasha watching was inspired!\n\n\"Muffle Me Night, Awhile\" was far and away my favorite story of the zine. Linda Mclnnis' Razak was marvelous! Saavik's unwilling arousal, the use of Spock, and the pall of sadism and violence were so perfect for Saavik's dream! The lines between Razak and Spock, \"Pain is a thing of the mind,\" and \"Death is a thing of the body,\" really rang true to me! How Vulcan, how Klingon, how arousing! Its so hard to put Spock in a situation where he willingly has sex, and so often authors twist his character to suit the story. Linda McInnis found a believable way to force him, a way Saavik would dream up with her violent past, and the results were chilling and erotic. Linda, you have been and always shall be, my favorite role model for depravity.\n\nLinda Baker's and Julie Cesari's illos were fantastic! So appropriate for the stories and so beautifully conceived. Linda's iilo of Spock...groan! Talk about masculine distractions!\n\nWhew! What a great read! Anyone have a cigarette? [3]\n\n[zine]: I wanted to let you know my feelings about Beyond the Farthest Star 3. As a whole I thought that the zine succeeded as an erotic adventure. My main complaint concerns the art which for the most part was mediocre to poor. I feel that no art is preferable to poor art but my attitude is colored by the fact I read this zine in a public place and had to be prepared to cover the artwork every time a page was turned.\n\nGive Linda Baker any bribe necessary to keep her writing. My favorite story in BTFS 3 was hers, \"The Big Diversion\", which balanced sexual tension and story atmosphere to make a wonderful \"what if\" tale. \"And Pleasing Dreams and Slumbers Light\" was a delightfully busy story with everyone getting into the act. Many of the scenes were deliciously creative; the hair and head fetishes, the holodeck contest, and Data's dream. The characterizations were kept true by the use of dreams for the sexual activity.\n\n\"Mirror Dreams\" might shock some but I thought it was an intriguing Idea. I just wish that the end of the story hadn't made it clear that they were involved as a substitute for the \"real\" thing.\n\n\"Deja Vu\" was ruined for me by the loss of the correction page so that I am missing a crucial page of the story. This story also involved a dream interlude but centered on Kirk, Uhura, and McCoy who did the obvious, (ho hum) Scotty got action in another dream sequence in \"The Tie That Binds\" which hints the story In its title (good for him).\n\n\"Diary Consequences\" was cute.\n\n\"The Lesson\" was a trifle mechanical for my tastes as was \"On Things To Come\" which depended on shock effect.\n\nI had difficulty in making myself read \"Enthralled\" as the subject of Chekov bored me.\n\n\"Muffle Me Night, Awhile\" by Linda Mac bothered me a little in that elements of masochism seemed central to the story. I understand that in a dream anything goes but I was bothered at the way Saavik was responding the Klingon. Psychologically, I know that those elements made it possible for Saavik to enjoy her sexuality without guilt as \"she was forced\". I know I am taking the whole subject too seriously, this zine is meant to be erotic and fun to read, which it definitely is. Good luck on future endeavors.[4]\n\n[zine]: Here goes the reputation. This is an X-rated zine devoted to both Trek Classic and TNG. This is a zine that will carbonate your hormones. This is a FUN zine. The theme chosen for this issue was fantasy/dream sequences. \"And Pleasing Dreams and Slumbers Light,\" a bittersweet story by Linda P. Baker, describes how the TNG bridge crew is individually affected by an alien gift of goodwill. What I especially liked is that if you deleted the explicit sensuality from the story, you would still end up with a terrific story with a purpose. Very tender and real. \"Deja Vu\" is a classic Trek story telling how ol' Tomcat Kirk, Uhura and McCoy pass a cold night on an alien planet. (Hint: they do not play backgammon). Chris Dickenson, in \"The Tie that Binds\" combines near electrocution and Scotty for Lt. Teresa Stone. It's just a little girl talk for Uhura and Christine in \"Mirror Dream\". Without a doubt the funniest story is \"Diary Consequences\" in which Don Vaughn brings you up close and personal with Worf, who has one wiid imagination. There ire also stories involving Spock, Xon, Sulu, Chekov and Saavik ~ yes, everyone gets....a chance to....shine. It's all pretty lighthearted, but NOT for the feint of heart (or those on blood pressure medication). There's lots of art, the majority of which is well done. But I promise you, you will NEVER look at Patrick Stewart the same way after you read this zine. 121 pp, Age Statement DEFINITELY required.[5]\n\nIssue 4\n\nBeyond the Farthest Star 4 published in December 1989 and contains 120 pages. It is a mixture of ST and ST:TNG stories. Art by Linda P. Baker, Barbara Caldwell, Mark Cantrell, Rick Endres, Kimberley Junius, Susan Leinback, T.J. MacAlan, Jeanne Matthews, Christine Myers, and Jay Harmon.\n\nThe editor was Linda P. Baker.\n\nRights to these and subsequent issues of Beyond the Farthest Star were transferred to Nova Press and Bill Hupe Publications.[6]\n\nFrom an ad in IDIC #9: \"Kirk returns home with a terrible hangover and a new piece of jewelry; Klingon stuff, and lots of terrific artwork, including a fantastic Worf cover that won an award at Worldcon in New Orleans.\"\n\nFrom the first editorial:\n\nWelcome to BTFS #4 and settle down with a Saurian brandy for a wonderfully depraved read. Hopefully, no one can quibble with the variety available in this Issue. From seven authors, we have a total of fourteen stories, covering several characters and several perversions. Just the way I like 'em!\n\nFirst is an author with whom BTFS readers should be familiar, Ann Zewen. She kicks off our travel down the road of lust with \"The Ring,\" which should please all you Kirk fans out there, and WARNING!—be careful what kind of souvenirs you buy on shore leave. She rounds out her contributions with \"The Beach,\" a Kirk/Rand story, and \"Calisthenics,\" in which she and Kalar delve more deeply into Worf's holodeck program. Chris Dickenson, with six submissions, now holds the title of \"Contributor With the Most Stories In One Issue.\" (Should give you some idea of where Chris* mind has been for the last few months.) She starts off with \"Special Duty,\" starring our favorite doctor and nurse in a sequel to Ann's \"The Ring.\" Not far behind is \"As It Was Before,\" my personal favorite—please, other contributors, don't be insulted; I admit to prejudice—as it's a sequel (but stands alone) to my \"All That Glitters\" from issue #2. Pulaski fans, and even non-fans, will find a reasonable explanation for the doctor's dislike of machines in \"Non Sequitur\", and Kirk fans will enjoy learning a \"Pharoah's Desire.\" \"A Slight Delay\" came from a comment Chris made about Randy wanting her to do a turbolift scene for another story. Don't think this is quite what he had in mind, but...you'll love it! And last from Chris, but not least, Is another favorite,—okay, I confess, all fourteen stories are my favorite—\"A Willin' Soul.\" In the planning stages, Chris couldn't quite figure how to get Spock, McCoy, and Chapel together, but as you'll discover, she managed quite well. Is that six? Whew! Don Vaughan and Mark Cantrell, two perverted and lunatic guys from the sunshine state, play game show hosts to Kirk and Spock with \"The Game Of Life,\" and Mark illuminates their vision with a wonderful cartoon. Rick Endres has a perfect evening for Klaa and Vixis aboard the Enterprise with \"The Bonding\" and even shows us what he had in mind. Kimberley Junius, not new to Orion Press, but new to BTFS, shows her usual lyrical mastery of the English language with two bitter-sweet stories. In \"Vulcanoid Strong,\" David Marcus and Saavik find each other on Genesis, and Beverly Crusher and Jean-Luc Picard comfort each other after the death of Tasha Yar In \"After the Evil.** Next Gen fans are going to demand more from our new author, T.J. MacAlan. In \"Swashbuckler,\" Jean-Luc Picard finds a solution to Beverly Crusher's pique at not being the only guest to his Dixon Hill fantasy. For this one, he doesn't need a historian! Three authors illoed their own stories this issue, Rick Endres, Kimberley Junius, and Mark Cantrell. I didn't have time for writing this time, but managed to squeeze in a couple of illos. We welcome four authors new to these pages, Barbara Caldwell, Jeanne Matthews, T.J. MacAlan, and Jay Harmon. For those interested, Jay has prints for sale of the Worf back cover, and also of Spock, Kirk, and Khan. His Worf and Khan won ribbons at WorldCon 1988.\n\nEnough introducing. Sit back, relax, and ENGAGE! And tell me what you think of the stories. I want to know, the authors want to know, and I need the material for LipLOC, the letter column introduced this issue. Thanks to Mark Cantrell for the name, and Mark, I still want that logo!\n\nFrom the second editorial:\n\nHope you enjoyed reading #4 as much as I enjoyed editing it. Either way, please let me know what you think. Besides being just plain fun, LOCs are important, both for .the growth of the zine and for the growth of the authors. Without feedback, how are we going to grow and learn? How can we print what the readers want? So, if you don't like what you see, or if you don't see what you like, let me know.\n\nI'd especially like to hear from those of you who don't write but still have a story or plot or even just a coupling idea. With the talented writers available, surely one of them would be willing to put pen to that story you've always wanted to read. One of our LOCer's, [Camilla M], objected to the art work in issue #3. I had the pleasure of meeting Cami recently, and she elaborated on her letter. Seems she was trying to read #3 while traveling via airplane and with the explicitness of the art, turning the pages was an adventure in itself! Opinions, please. Would you, the reader, prefer a ^coffee table safe' zine, or do you prefer the explicit art? (Personally, I like the explicit stuff, but that's because as one friend aptly observed, \"You must like to draw peniaes.\" I like looking at 'em, too!)\n\nFinally, when I told Randy about not having an idea for this editorial, he said, \"I do. Answer Laurie Haynes* letter.\" Well, since the subject she brought up was one about which there has been an ongoing dialogue among Orion Press editors and publishers, it seemed like a good idea.
