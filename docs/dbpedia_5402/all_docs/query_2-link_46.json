        "text": "100% Love Guarantee\n\nYou will LOVE your art, or we will take it back — “60-Day Money Back” & “Free Return Shipping”. The only kind of love that can be guaranteed.\n\nLifetime Warranty\n\n“Is this new?” That is what you are going to hear for the next 50 years. Your yellows will stay as yellow as the first day you hung your art. If not, we will replace it.\n\nHandcrafted Quality\n\nEvery item is made-to-order and assembled in-house by our team, using only premium materials...cuz we're a little obsessed about art.\n\nMade in The USA\n\nAll of our products are handcrafted — printed, stretched, stapled, and framed — at iCanvas, in Illinois. Lincoln would be proud.\n\nCanvas Print Product Features\n\nGallery Wrapped Canvas\n\nAll of our artwork comes gallery wrapped. The image is stretched around the sides and stapled to the back of the wooden frame. Your piece of art will be ready to hang, and will include an easy-to-use hanging kit.\n\nCanvas Stretcher Bar Keys\n\nThe use of canvas stretcher bar keys is essential for preserving the visual appeal of canvas artwork, as they allow for the adjustment of canvas tension, which in turn guarantees a surface that is free of wrinkles. Stretcher keys are the preferred canvas stretching method by art professionals around the world as well as ours.\n\nFRAME OPTIONS\n\nBlack & white matte frames have a sleek lacquer finish and are versatile enough to pair with almost any piece of art. Mottled gold & silver frames are hard wood with a textured metallic finish. Silver pairs well with cool colors and dark backgrounds, while gold pairs particularly well with classic art, traditional décor, and warmer colors. Dark wood can look great with rustic, farmhouse, nature and photography prints.\n\nFramed Canvas Framing Options\n\nGallery Wrapped Canvas\n\nAll of our artwork comes gallery wrapped. The image is stretched around the sides and stapled to the back of the wooden frame. Your piece of art will be ready to hang, and will include an easy-to-use hanging kit.\n\nFloating Frame\n\nA little “armor for your art” that won‘t obscure the canvas. Your canvas print is gallery wrapped and mounted to a 2\" thick, elegant, black hard wood frame. The art is inset, leaving a 3/8\" space between the art and frame, creating the illusion that your art is “floating.”\n\nFRAME OPTIONS\n\nBlack & white matte frames have a sleek lacquer finish and are versatile enough to pair with almost any piece of art. Mottled gold & silver frames are hard wood with a textured metallic finish. Silver pairs well with cool colors and dark backgrounds, while gold pairs particularly well with classic art, traditional décor, and warmer colors.
