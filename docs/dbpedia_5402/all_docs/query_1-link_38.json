        "text": "Star light, star bright, how far you look tonight.\n\nAstronomers announced on Wednesday the discovery of the farthest and earliest star ever seen, a dot of light that shone 12.9 billion years ago, or just 900 million years after the Big Bang that gave birth to the universe.\n\nThat means the light from the star traveled 12.9 billion light-years to reach Earth.\n\nThe finding was part of efforts using the Hubble Space Telescope to search for some of the universe’s farthest and earliest galaxies. By a lucky coincidence, the astronomers were able to discern a single star system within one of those galaxies.\n\n“It was an unexpected surprise to find something so small,” said Brian Welch, a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who is an author of a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature that describes the discovery."
