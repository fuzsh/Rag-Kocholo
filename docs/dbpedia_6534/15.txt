Chengdu is the capital of southwestern China’s Sichuan province. Chengdu has a population of 16.5 million and a history that dates to at least the 4th century BC.

After World War 2, Chengdu was briefly the home of the Nationalist Republican Government until it withdrew to Taipei. Under the PRC, Chengdu has become a major manufacturing and defense industry hub. It is also ranked as one of the world’s 30 top cities by scientific research output. More than 300 of the Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu.

Chengdu is one of the prototypes for China’s new urban planning model: the “Great City.” This is a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass transit hub where any location in the city is within a 15-minute walk. This plan is intended to provide an affordable high-quality lifestyle for all residents.

The majority population in Chengdu is Han Chinese, but 54 ethnic minorities are living here as well. They comprise roughly 18% of the residents. Buddhism is the primary religion, with Confucianism also practiced. There is very little Christian influence.
