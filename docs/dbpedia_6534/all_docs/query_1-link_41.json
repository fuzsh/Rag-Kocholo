        "text": "Chengdu is a transportation-intensive city. It is circled by four ring roads, with highways connecting Chengdu to the important population center of Chongqing, about 200 miles away. Four major railroads run through the city. Chengdu’s Shuanglui International Airport, which handled more than 42 million passengers in 2015, is China’s fourth-busiest airport. Logistics and distribution companies make use of industrial properties and warehouses situated near key transportation junctions.\n\nChengdu’s rapidly growing economy is increasingly driven by services, including higher education and research and development. Chengdu is also a center for business process outsourcing. Local demand for logistics and distribution space is fueled by consumption and national and international trade. Chengdu’s increasingly confident consumer class frequent the city’s many malls and shopping outlets.\n\nPrologis has available warehouses for lease in Chengdu and operates various industrial properties throughout the Chengdu area."
