        "text": "CHENGDU 2022\n\nChengdu, the home to giant pandas, has a 4500-year history and is known as the ‘Land of Abundance’. It has been China’s top new first-tier city for six consecutive years and the ‘happiest city in China’ for 13 years in a row. It has a resident population of over 21 million people, an urbanisation rate of more than 79%, and has the nation’s seventh-highest GDP. Chengdu has made a major decision to ‘further strengthen agile and scientific governance of a mega city by constructing a smart city’ in response to its rapid growth of the city’s population, vehicles, goods, and other city factors. Guided by the principle of putting people first, Chengdu plans to ‘take advantage of smart governance to build a modern Park City demonstration zone that practices new development concepts and strives for a new path for the transformation and development of megacities’, and greatly enhanced people’s sense of benefit, happiness, and security through delicacy management of public security, management, and services. The city built an integrated city operation management system that covers 45 municipal departments, 23 districts and counties, and 261 towns, enabled a ‘8+N’ smart application scenarios, and significant promoted the efficiency of government services. Chengdu’s promotion of “management via a single website” assists city operations: our ‘Tianfu Citizen Cloud’ app offers 805 all-lifecycle services and has served 13.04 million people online; the ‘Tianfu Rong Yi Ban’ app allows citizens to complete 90% of application-type government services fully online and 100% with a single offline experience; and the ‘Rong Yi Xiang’ app has collected data from around 3.58 million enterprises and released approximately 900 enterprise-friendly policies. Chengdu promotes ‘one-click response’ to people’s demands, and it has dealt with 11 million calls and letters from the public with a resolving rate and a satisfaction rate of over 90%. The idea of ‘when people call, I will respond’ is fully realised.At present, a new picture of building a modern megacity governance system is unfolding in Chengdu, the Park City at the foot of snow mountains, where people’s needs are taken care of, where delicacy governance makes the city better, and where lean governance unveils the beauty of the city.\n\nMain Congress Live"
