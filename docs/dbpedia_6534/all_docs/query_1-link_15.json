        "text": "Meet Chengdu\n\nChengdu is the capital of China’s Sichuan Province and is one of the three most-populous cities in the Western area of the country. Located in central Sichuan, Chengdu has an urban population of more than 16 million and is a hub for railways and telecommunications for southwestern China. Chengdu and Phoenix established a sister city relationship in 1987.\n\nChengdu is among the oldest cities in the world. Archeological evidence indicates Chengdu was inhabited more than four thousand years ago, in the 10th century BC. During this time period, the town was home to an ancient bronze-wielding culture, which later become known as the Shu. Now, Chengdu is known as the Panda Capital. It home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, a non-profit and world-renowned panda breeding center with more than 100 pandas.\n\nChengdu International Sister Cities Sculptures Creation Program:\n\nPlease email completed reply form to Qing at: qingzhang0717@sina.com.\n\nSculptures Creation Program Reply Form.\n\nMore information:\n\nInvitation Letter from Chengdu\n\nChengdu International Sister Cities Sculpture Works\n\nA Brief Introduction to Chengdu\n\nLearn more about Chengdu:\n\nTo visit the Chengdu city website, click here.\n\nTo see a map of Chengdu, click here.\n\nLearn some Mandarin:\n\nhttp://www.chinese-tools.com/learn/chinese (online – free)\n\nhttp://www.learn4good.com/great_schools/mandarin_chinese_classes.htm\n\nNews\n\n2021 Phoenix Chinese Week’s Virtual Culture and Cuisine Festival\n\nCelebrate Lunar New Year 4719, the year of the Ox from the comfort and safety of your home.
