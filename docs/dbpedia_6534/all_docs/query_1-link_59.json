Compared with 2010, Chengdu's permanent population increased by 5.82 million. The proportion of the city's population in Sichuan province also rose to 25.02 percent from 18.8 percent in 2010.\n\nAccording to the Chengdu Bureau Statistics, since the national population census was launched in 1953, Chengdu's permanent population has been on the rise. The city's attraction and gathering effects are also increasing, with optimized urban spatial structure, and a better business and employment environment.\n\nIn addition, Xi'an city in Shaanxi province, saw its population increase by 4.49 million or 52.97 percent over the past 10 years.
