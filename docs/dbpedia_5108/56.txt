Radiola has been a staple of everyday life in France since 1922. We built up our values throughout this period of French history. The Radiola brand was born from state-of-the-art technology that brought progress and culture to all homes. It has been constantly evolving over time, and years of development led to it making comfort accessible to all with product ranges covering sound, image and appliances. Today, Radiola is undergoing a new renaissance via its brand-new ingenious product range with cutting designs.

Our goal? To make day-to-day life easier for all by offering beautiful products with original designs containing the best of current technology.

« I’ve had my RADIOLA (130 l -RT 6014) freezer since... May 1987, if you can believe it! 34 years... quite a shock when I checked the receipt! Faithful and fit as ever, this freezer does everything I need to store my frozen food. I can still easily change thesettings, and its lights are still bright! »
