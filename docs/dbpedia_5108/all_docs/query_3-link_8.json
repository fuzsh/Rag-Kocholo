        "text": "PDF version\n\nReference: 2020-25, 2020-374 and 2020-374-1\n\nOttawa, 7 December 2022\n\nPublic record: 1011-NOC2020-0374\n\nRevised Commercial Radio Policy\n\nSummary\n\nThe Commission has completed its review of the Commercial Radio Policy to ensure the ongoing relevance and effectiveness of the regulatory tools governing commercial radio. The updates adopted by the Commission will allow the regulatory framework to continue to serve the needs and interests of Canadians while also supporting Canadian artists and alleviating some of the regulatory burden on broadcasters.\n\nAt the time of the issuance of this regulatory policy, a new legislation with substantial changes to the Broadcasting Act (the Act) is awaiting approval by Parliament. The revised Act would provide new tools to address some of the structural issues affecting conventional radio stations, especially as they compete directly for listeners with streaming services. Accordingly, the elements of this regulatory policy are meant to work both under the current Act and in the environment of a new Act, and future proceedings that are being announced as part of this regulatory policy are meant to work seamlessly in either legislative environment.\n\nKey changes to assist broadcasters include added flexibility to the Common Ownership Policy, modifications to the system for identifying Canadian musical selections, and the elimination of the hits policy in bilingual markets. In addition, some changes are focused on supporting creators and Canadians, such as ensuring that Canadian and French-language vocal music quotas can no longer be circumvented through montages, and through the Commission’s intention to launch a follow-up proceeding to explore a contribution system for Canadian content development (CCD) that is more adapted to the evolution of commercial radio and ensures funding is directed towards diverse initiatives.\n\nFurther, given the importance of broadcasting musical selections from emerging artists as a means of ensuring the discoverability of those artists, sustaining a vibrant Canadian musical industry, and providing listeners with the variety they seek, the Commission finds that it must encourage the broadcast of emerging artists’ music on commercial radio stations, and that it must gather more information on the situation facing these artists as soon as possible. Accordingly, the Commission expects commercial radio stations that are not already required by condition of licence to broadcast music by emerging artists to devote, in each broadcast week, at least 5% of their musical selections to selections from Canadian emerging artists. Further, it expects licensees of those stations to report annually on how they have met that expectation.\n\nIn regard to Indigenous Peoples, the Commission considers it has a key role to play in ensuring increased support for, and presence of Indigenous content and voices within mainstream radio broadcasting. Accordingly, the Commission expects commercial radio broadcasters to include Indigenous music in their playlists and to report annually on the amount of Indigenous content aired throughout the broadcast year. Additionally, the Commission intends to gather information on different funds and initiatives that help support, promote and ensure the sustainability of the Indigenous broadcasting content sector through the launch of a follow-up proceeding to explore the CCD contribution system.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commission continues the co-development of a new Indigenous broadcasting policy with Indigenous Peoples in Canada. Some of the outcomes from that process may have an impact on all broadcasting sectors of Canada, including commercial radio stations.\n\nA complete list of the Commission’s determinations is set out in the appendix to this document.\n\nBackground\n\nThe framework and most of the different policies comprised in the Commercial Radio Policy of 2006 were put in place in an audio landscape that has since changed considerably. The review of the commercial radio policy comes at a time when radio is in a transition period. A significant portion of the radio industry is struggling, but radio remains very important for entertaining, informing, discovering new artists and ensuring that local voices are heard, affording a proximity that as of yet has no real alternative.\n\nThis review was launched in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and soon after the Government of Canada announced its intention to review the Broadcasting Act (the Act), but before all the tools are in place to allow for a truly different approach to regulation.\n\nIn Broadcasting Notice of Proceeding 2020-25, the Commission announced the process it planned to follow and identified possible issues to be covered by its commercial radio policyFootnote 1 review. Phase 1 of this review, a conversation with Canadians through public opinion research, concluded in January 2021 with the release of the final report: Attitudes and opinions towards commercial radio in Canada.\n\nIn Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2020-374, the Commission initiated Phase 2 of the review of the commercial radio policy framework. As indicated in that notice, the main objective of the proceeding was to assess the relevance and effectiveness of the regulatory tools governing commercial radio and to update the regulatory framework to best serve the needs and interests of Canadians. If necessary, some tools could be removed, changed or added to obtain the following results in an optimal and balanced manner:\n\nfor Canadian listeners: provide diverse, relevant and quality programming that serves their needs and interests;\n\nfor Canadian artists: ensure that they (music and spoken word) are best supported by broadcasters in a balanced manner for the creation, presentation and discoverability of Canadian content; and\n\nfor broadcasters: establish a flexible regulatory framework that enables both English- and French-language radio to remain competitive with digital audio services, and to take full advantage of digital technologies for current radio services.\n\nThe Commission also stated in Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2020-374 that comments would be collected during this phase, and that the next phase (or phases) could include additional questions directed at some or all parties or use other appropriate means within the Commission’s powers and jurisdiction to ensure the efficient completion of the public record.\n\nThe deadline to receive interventions for Phase 2 was originally 1 February 2021. However, following a joint procedural request from various associations representing the music industryFootnote 2, it was extended to 29 March 2021. The extension was announced in Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2020-374-1.\n\nInterventions\n\nThe Commission received 218 interventions, 158 of which were submitted by individuals and 60 by various companies, organizations and interest groups.\n\nIssues\n\nAfter examining the record for this proceeding in light of applicable regulations and policies, the Commission has considered and addressed the following issues:\n\nthe Common Ownership Policy;\n\nlocal management agreements and local sales agreements;\n\nCanadian content development contributions; and\n\nprogramming.\n\nWith respect to programming, the Commission has considered the following issues:\n\nthe Canadian musical selections;\n\ncontent categories and subcategories;\n\nCanadian content requirements for content category 2 (Popular Music) musical selections;\n\nCanadian content requirements for content category 3 (Special Interest Music) musical selections;\n\nthe definition of French-language musical selection;\n\nFrench-language vocal music (FVM) quotas;\n\nthe definitions of broadcast week and peak listening period;\n\nthe policy on emerging artists;\n\nthe policy on hits in bilingual markets;\n\nmontages; and\n\nlocal programming.\n\nIn addition, the Commission has considered issues regarding the relationship between a revised policy for commercial radio and the co-development of a new Indigenous broadcasting policy with Indigenous Peoples of Canada, as well as issues regarding diversity, including diversity in ownership, programming and contributions, data collection and engagement.\n\nThe Commission has also addressed issues relating to HD Radio, reports and monitoring.\n\nThe Common Ownership Policy\n\nThe Common Ownership Policy (COP) for radio was established as part of the Commercial Radio Policy in Public Notice 1998-41 and was later reviewed and confirmed in Broadcasting Public Notice 2008-4. Further guidelines on the COP were set out in Broadcasting Information Bulletin 2010-341, including guidelines around exceptions to the COP.\n\nAs set out in Broadcasting Information Bulletin 2010-341, the COP has several objectives including the following two:\n\nto ensure a plurality of ownership within the private commercial element of radio broadcasting, so that Canadians have access to a variety of editorial voices within the radio component of the broadcasting system; and\n\nto maintain a balance of competition between radio broadcasters in any particular market.\n\nThe COP states that in a market with fewer than eight commercial radio stations operating in a given language, a person may be permitted to own or control as many as three stations operating in that language, with a maximum of two stations within one frequency band. It also states that in a market with eight commercial radio stations or more operating in a given language, a person may be permitted to own or control as many as two AM and two FM stations in that language.\n\nCurrently, the COP applies when broadcasters file applications to:\n\nlaunch a new station in a given market, including when AM stations wish to convert to the FM band;\n\nchange in the ownership or effective control of a station; and\n\namend the technical parameters of a station that would increase the coverage areas of existing stations, since the new contours might increase the presence of a broadcaster in adjacent markets. This applies to any case of overlap, even if approval of an application entailing a minor overlap would not significantly affect the diversity of voices and the balance of competition in a market.\n\nIn Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2020-374, the Commission sought comments on the continued appropriateness of the size and contours of a market, as defined in the COP. It also sought comments on, amongst other matters, the appropriateness of the established ownership limits, as well as the circumstances under which the Commission could make an exception to its COP.\n\nHow markets are defined\n\nThe COP prohibits broadcasters from operating more than a certain number of stations in a specific market. The concept of “market” is defined in the Radio Regulations, 1986 (the Regulations) and takes into account whether the service is provided by an AM or an FM station.\n\nFor AM stations, the market is defined as the AM daytime 15 mV/m contour or the central area as defined by Numeris, whichever is smaller.\n\nFor FM stations, the market is defined as the 3 mV/m contour or the central area as defined by Numeris, whichever is smaller.\n\nPosition of parties\n\nIn its intervention, Rogers Media Inc. (Rogers) submitted that the Commission should remove the contour criteria, and instead rely solely on the Numeris definition of a market.Footnote 3 It added that the Commission already refers to this definition in the Regulations and that these well-established parameters should be used given that they directly correlate to a commercial revenue opportunity and, as such, the competitive composition of the market. Rogers stated that the definition should be clear, simple, and consistently applied to be effective. It added that where there is no Numeris market definition, as may be the case in some very small markets, the market definition should be based on Statistics Canada’s market definition.\n\nThe Canadian Association of Broadcasters (CAB) stated that it is no longer valid to assume that rebroadcasting transmitters affect the diversity of programming and the competitive balance in a market. It proposed that the Commission abandon the use of the 3 mV/m or 15 mV/m contours as an indication of market presence in favour of a true market indicator, namely the Numeris definition of markets.\n\nThe Association des radiodiffuseurs communautaires du QuÃ©bec, the Alliance des radios communautaires du Canada and the National Campus and Community Radio Association (hereafter the Associations) expressed their concern about the CAB’s proposal to no longer include rebroadcasting transmitters as part of the COP assessment. They argued that it could affect the competitive balance of a market.\n\nCommission’s analysis\n\nBoth Rogers and the CAB requested that the market be defined solely by the Numeris definition instead of the current definition of market set out in the Regulations. Currently, the contour is most often used to establish the station’s market, as it is usually smaller than the areas as defined by Numeris.\n\nThe Commission notes that central markets determined by Numeris definitions are limited to established urban areas that offer substantial marketing opportunities that attract paying customers based on validated data such as reach and tuning for stations. These urban areas only constitute a percentage of the total Numeris areas, which already excludes much of the northern part of the country.\n\nThe Commission further notes that using only the Numeris definition of a market could cause further confusion between the physical and marketing reach of a station, as a market defined by Numeris cannot always be fully covered by a transmitter’s signal. A market could vary depending on history and population changes, which could result in redrawn boundaries (by Statistics Canada, Numeris, or others), hence the reason why the primary contour is based on the actual signal reach rather than the initial notion of a market upon application.\n\nMoreover, Numeris is a third-party organization that can unilaterally amend its market areas, either by changing area boundaries and/or definitions, which could have a significant impact on the Commission’s decisions.\n\nIn contrast, the use of the definitions based on the 3 mV/m or the 15 mV/m contours can be consistently applied by the Commission as they are based on fixed technical parameters, thus enabling the use of common boundaries and standard data used by the industry and regulatory bodies, in addition to offering greater predictability to licensees.\n\nThe use of the primary contour is also consistent with other policies whereby the Commission has considered the primary contour as the market area where solicitation of advertising is permitted.\n\nIn addition, the constraints arising from frequency availability and interference remain, and therefore, a contour impact assessment must be conducted. As such, any changes in the market definition would not alleviate complications to the assessment or the implementation of the COP and of the Diversity of Voices (DOV) Policy, set out in Broadcasting Public Notice 2008-4. Therefore, defining the concept of a market solely based on the Numeris definition would not help to resolve any current issues and could create confusion regarding the marketable reach of a station.\n\nIn this regard, the Commission considers that Rogers’s request for a clear, simple and consistently applied definition would be more easily fulfilled by retaining only the contour definition of the market.\n\nIn regard to the CAB’s statement regarding the impact of rebroadcasting transmitters, the Commission is of the view that these transmitters can affect the competitive balance in a market. Rebroadcasting transmitters allow licensees to derive revenues from a market (even in the absence of local programming) by increasing the overall reach/listenership of a station, thus making it more attractive to national advertisers. Therefore, the Commission considers that rebroadcasting transmitters should continue to be part of the licensee’s market.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission finds that the current definition of market remains appropriate as it is clear, predictable, flexible and alleviates most potential problems.\n\nCommon ownership limits\n\nPosition of parties\n\nThe Public Interest Advocacy Centre (PIAC), the Forum for Research and Policy in Communications (FRPC) and Music Canada (an association comprised of Sony Music Entertainment Inc., Universal Music Canada Inc. and Warner Music Canada Co.) were against potentially higher levels of consolidation. Amongst the arguments presented, they stated that relaxing the COP would reduce Canadians’ access to news produced with different perspectives and advertisers’ access to different ownership groups. In addition, it was noted that consolidation could lead to an increase in national news, to the detriment of local news. These interveners also stated that increased ownership concentration would reduce the diversity of voices available in the radio sector and would exacerbate other current problems such as restricted playlists for specific formats. On this matter, the Association QuÃ©bÃ©coise de l’industrie du disque, du spectacle et de la vidÃ©o (ADISQ) argued that the programming offered by independent broadcasters was more diversified than the programming offered by large broadcasters.\n\nMost broadcasters, the CAB and the Ontario Association of Broadcasters (OAB) favoured relaxing the COP. Several models were proposed to allow for ownership of a greater number of stations in a given market, depending on the number of stations being present in the market. They submitted that since radio is increasingly competing with large international online conglomerates, and as radio revenues are decreasing, allowing a degree of increased local ownership could result in greater viability for radio stations. Otherwise, given that broadcasters have already cut non-programming expenses, they could be forced to cut programming expenses to ensure their survival. In their view, allowing further consolidation would benefit Canadians as radio stations would have more resources available for on-air programming.\n\nIn addition, several broadcasters stated that consolidation generally leads to greater format and music diversity, as one operator generally has a disincentive to compete with itself on one format, and an incentive to segment the market into different formats.\n\nSome interveners cautioned that the Commission will need to ensure that any consolidation results in a net benefit for society, particularly in smaller markets. Therefore, they proposed that firm requirements be introduced to ensure incremental increases in local programming (such as local news), the broadcast of musical selections from emerging artists, and programming in different formats.\n\nSome interveners, including some broadcasters, indicated that special consideration should be given to small independent undertakings when considering the COP. Specifically, they stated that allowing those broadcasters to own more stations than large broadcasters in a given market could have a positive impact on the financial health of smaller broadcasters as well as on their ability to compete with large broadcasters. Other intervenors proposed different sets of COP limits for smaller broadcasters to allow them to better compete. Some parties also stressed the differences between the language markets and indicated that different solutions may be required for French and bilingual markets.\n\nFinally, with respect to AM stations, some interveners indicated that ownership flexibility would allow vulnerable AM stations, including those operating in news/talk formats, to find a new home on the FM band, without prejudicing the existing content and music diversity of FM radio. However, one intervener noted that allowing AM conversions could lead to hardship for the remaining AM stations and further erode their listenership and revenues.\n\nCommission’s analysis\n\nThe public record indicates that many parties would be amenable to some form of relaxation of the COP limits. However, neither parties in favour of relaxing the COP limits, nor parties in favour of maintaining the current limits, provided conclusive evidence to substantiate their viewpoints.\n\nIn the Commission’s view, some relaxation would not be inconsistent with the objectives of the DOV Policy. Specifically, ever since the DOV Policy was published in 2008, Canadians have shifted the way they consume media and access a variety of new editorial voices and programming content. Further, the media landscape has changed. Indeed, the Commission acknowledges the contributions that other forms of media, such as campus, community, ethnic and Indigenous radio stations, make to the diversity of voices. In addition, with the increasing popularity of digital media, Canadians are able to better seek out content they desire, including the editorial voices and musical selections they wish to hear.\n\nBroadcasters in favour of more consolidation have consistently argued that consolidation allows for synergies to be found within one geographical market. For example, consolidated stations are better able to offer advertising packages targeting the demographics required by advertisers. In addition, economies of scale can be found around administration, sales, programming and news, which help to reduce costs and enhance profitability while increasing the quality of programming. This would help the radio industry compete with other forms of media and face pressure from international competitors for audience attention.\n\nThe Commission acknowledges that consolidation is likely to help improve the financial health of radio stations, which, in turn, will improve the resiliency and competitiveness of the overall radio industry.\n\nHowever, even if consumers now have access to more programming and news than at the time the COP was created, as a result of the growing presence of digital media, consolidation could still negatively impact consumers as it could lead to a decrease in diversity of voices related to both news and programming, and could make it more difficult for smaller independent broadcasters to compete.\n\nWhile broadcasters argued that consolidation allows them to be in a better position to invest in local programming, including news, the Commission is of the view that, absent other regulatory measures, there are no guarantees that they will make these additional investments. In this regard, the Commission notes that, based on its analysis of available information, expenses related to news are more related to a broadcaster’s business model than to the number of stations it operates.\n\nAs such, any changes made to the COP limits should be implemented gradually and carefully, so that the Commission has adequate opportunity to assess the impacts on the broadcasting system.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission finds it appropriate to amend the COP as follows:\n\nfor markets with eight commercial radio stations or more operating in a given language, a person may be permitted to own or control as many as four stations, with a maximum of three stations within one frequency band (FM or AM) in that language; and\n\nfor markets with fewer than eight commercial radio stations operating in a given language, a person may be permitted to own or control as many as three stations operating in that language, with no limits on frequency band.\n\nAdditionally, the Commission recognizes that the specific circumstances of particular markets or licensees may warrant exceptions to the general COP rules. Accordingly, the Commission will continue to assess requests for exceptions to its policies on a case-by-case basis. As such, the Commission may grant an exception to the COP where it finds that an exception is in the public interest, such as when the exception provides for clear benefits to Canadians and the broadcasting system. Amongst potential proposals to improve the broadcasting system, the Commission may consider an exception to the COP when applicants propose additional benefits to the broadcasting system such as:\n\ntangible benefits that are higher than the minimum outlined in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy 2014-459;\n\nadditional Canadian content development (CCD) contributions to be imposed by condition of licence;\n\nadditional commitments to local programming (particularly local and regional news) to be imposed by condition of licence; and\n\nadditional initiatives supporting artists from Canada’s racialized communities to be imposed by condition of licence.\n\nThe Commission may also consider granting exceptions for small or independent players where such exceptions would allow them to better compete with larger players.\n\nSimplification of process\n\nPosition of parties\n\nIn its intervention, the CAB submitted that in a single operator market of three stations or less, an existing incumbent operator should be entitled to apply for an additional station or stations, up to the maximum of four stations set out in the COP, without triggering a call for applications.\n\nThe CAB added that the market capacity test should be amended to draw a distinction between the capacities of a market to sustain a new incumbent-owned station versus that of a new entrant, with priority given to granting new licences to incumbents.\n\nSome parties also stated that a simplified administrative process should be put in place to ensure timely decisions when applications for a modification in ownership or control are filed.\n\nCommission’s analysis\n\nIn regard to the CAB’s request, the Commission notes that an exception to the call for applications process already exists for proposals by the sole commercial operator in a market to improve service to the market, either through an AM to FM conversion or when applying for a new station. Furthermore, the Commission often considers the capacity of a market to sustain a new incumbent-owned service as opposed to a new entrant when assessing an application. However, while amending the market capacity test to give priority to incumbent operators may increase the viability of the market or of the incumbent proposed service, it may also go against the DOV Policy objectives.\n\nThe Commission acknowledges that timeliness is important for ownership transactions. However, the Commission notes that it implemented an administrative process for certain transfers of shares on an expedited basis in Broadcasting Information Bulletin 2008-8-2. In addition, it published service objectives in Broadcasting and Telecom Information Bulletin 2011-222 that result in ownership decisions (changes in effective control, share transfers or the acquisition of assets) being published much faster than other applications that may or may not require a public process.\n\nThe Commission further notes that modifying the current process would involve more than just commercial radio stations, which are the focus of the present proceeding.\n\nGiven the potential implications resulting from a change to this approach and the limited amount of evidence tendered as part of this proceeding, the Commission considers that the present proceeding is not the appropriate forum for considering amendments to the approval process for ownership transactions.\n\nLocal management agreements and local sales agreements\n\nLocal management agreements (LMA) and local sale agreements (LSA) are formal or informal arrangements, contracts, understandings or agreements between two or more licensees and relating to at least two radio stations in the same market and adjacent markets. While a LMA allows a licensee to perform one or numerous functions associated with the management of another station in a market (or in an adjacent market), a LSA generally relates to the station’s advertising sales. They are both means for the licensees to benefit from synergies by decreasing costs, allowing them to share resources and advertising costs and revenues in a market. As such, they can offer an alternative business model that provides flexibility and creates opportunities for synergies.\n\nPursuant to section 11.1 of the Regulations, licensees of commercial radio stations serving the same market who wish to enter into a LMA, or any other similar business arrangement, whether formal or informal, must first apply for Commission approval. LMAs will be authorized by conditions of licence only where clearly warranted by circumstances.\n\nIn Broadcasting Public Notice 2005-10 (the 2005 LMA-LSA Policy), the Commission indicated the elements to be examined in considering applications for authority to enter into LMAs, as follows:\n\nthe profitability of the stations involved;\n\nthe number of stations owned by the parties in the market concerned;\n\nthe potential impact on competitors;\n\nthe potential impact on new entry;\n\nthe possible reduction in the diversity of editorial voices and in the overall diversity and quality of programming; and\n\nthe potential impact on the ability of radio stations to better compete with other media.\n\nIn the 2005 LMA-LSA Policy, the Commission concluded that LSAs fell within the definition of a LMA as not only is the local sales function an aspect of the operations of a radio station, but there is also likely to be a direct relationship between local sales and programming. As such, licensees wishing to enter into a LSA were also required to apply for Commission approval to do so.\n\nCAB’s Part 1 application seeking relief for broadcasters\n\nOn 13 July 2020, the CAB filed a Part 1 application requesting that the Commission grant immediate regulatory relief to Canadian broadcasters by reason of the COVID-19 pandemic. Amongst its proposals, the CAB proposed suspending, as of 31 July 2020, the pre-approval requirement of LMAs for radio stations for a minimum period of 18 months. This would permit two differently-owned radio stations in a given market to be co-managed by one entity and allow for the co-sale of advertising between those stations and entities without requiring the Commission’s prior approval.\n\nIn Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2020-336, the call for comments on the CAB’s application, the Commission expressed the view that it would be more appropriate to address any issues relating to the modification of the Commission’s current approach to LMAs in the context of the Commercial Radio Policy review proceeding. Accordingly, the CAB reiterated its request regarding LMAs in its intervention filed as part of the present proceeding.\n\nPosition of parties\n\nIn its intervention, the CAB indicated that permitting greater flexibility in the use of these arrangements would serve the public interest. The CAB argued that, particularly for stand-alone stations or smaller operators, such agreements could act as practical and immediate alternatives to cuts, sales or closures. It stated that more flexible LMA and LSA policies would provide additional opportunities to achieve local operational efficiencies.\n\nSpecifically, the CAB requested that the Commission eliminate regulations that necessitate prior approval for broadcasters wishing to enter into LSAs, as competing broadcasters in the same local market can already hire the same sales agents. The CAB also requested that the Commission eliminate pre-approval requirements for LMAs that are consistent with its proposed COP. The CAB noted that pre-approval requirements could remain for LMAs that are in excess of those limits.\n\nSome parties opposed the CAB’s proposed changes. The FRPC submitted that the CAB’s proposal would lead to an unacceptable reduction in the diversity of news and competition as it would lead to the effective reduction in the number of individual broadcasters. The Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique (SCFP) submitted that not requiring the Commission’s prior approval of such agreements would deprive the Commission of important information on the state of the commercial market.\n\nThe Associations also opposed the CAB’s proposed changes, arguing that such changes could lead to widespread use of LSAs in small markets, which could in turn put local campus and community stations relying heavily on local advertising at a competitive disadvantage. The Associations also noted that because LSAs might negatively impact community and campus radio stations by allowing local commercial radio stations to scale up their advertising efforts, the Commission should continue to evaluate these agreements on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe PIAC submitted that LMAs and LSAs are by nature a form of “cartelization” and that they are unnecessary.\n\nCommission’s analysis regarding LMAs\n\nSince LMAs can involve several aspects of a station’s operation, the Commission is of the view that prior approval should remain as a requirement to ensure that LMAs do not lead, even inadvertently, to a change in effective control of the stations involved in the agreement, and to ensure that the LMA truly serves the public interest.\n\nHowever, the Commission is also of the view that LMAs can provide for increased flexibility to broadcasters to outsource some of their operations to a third party without impacting their ability to control their own undertaking(s), and can allow them to benefit from certain operational synergies to help maintain profitability in an industry that is showing gradual decline. On this matter, the Commission notes that the public interest might be better served in terms of diversity of voices by LMAs than by additional acquisitions.\n\nFurthermore, in certain circumstances, LMAs can allow broadcasters to focus on their core mandate, which is to provide quality programming, without having to deal with matters such as soliciting advertising, accounting and technical maintenance. Accordingly, the Commission is of the view that the stringent criteria used in the 2005 LMA-LSA Policy to approve LMAs could be amended.\n\nThe Commission considers that most of the existing safeguards it has established around LMAs are enough to alleviate the risks and potential negative impacts on incumbent radio stations in a given market.\n\nNonetheless, the Commission is of the view that the restriction allowing the use of LMAs only by unprofitable stations should be removed in order to allow increased flexibility for broadcasters to better react to economic fluctuations and shifting market dynamics. The Commission would, however, still retain the ability to review the proposed LMAs to ensure that policy objectives relative to the diversity of voices are met, while the industry would be given the flexibility to consider opportunities to find synergies, limit the costs of their operations and benefit from economies of scale.\n\nGiven the Commission’s more open approach towards LMAs, the Commission considers it appropriate to provide parties with guidance on the types of LMAs that it is likely to approve. In particular, the Commission is of the view that parties to a LMA must be prohibited from obtaining any exclusivity on advertising by any means. For example, parties to a LMA cannot offer a discount on advertising to advertisers if they agree not to acquire advertising on competing radio stations.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission finds that the definition of a LMA is still appropriate and that it will consider allowing entrance into LMAs beyond unprofitable stations, if they satisfy the following criteria:\n\nthe number of stations collectively owned by the parties in the market complies with the threshold set in the COP;\n\nthe effective control of each undertaking remains exercised by their respective licensees;\n\neach licensee maintains distinct and separate programming and news services;\n\neach licensee remains responsible for the management of their distinct services, including the program director and the news director, as well as any other related staff assigned to programming and/or news activities; and\n\nthe LMA includes a provision that prohibits parties of the LMA acquiring exclusivity on advertising.\n\nThe Commission is also prepared to consider approving LMAs that do not meet these criteria. However, in such cases, the onus would be on the applicant to clearly demonstrate that its proposal would nevertheless serve the public interest.\n\nCommission’s analysis regarding LSAs\n\nIn the 2005 LMA-LSA policy, the Commission determined that LSAs were LMAs because sales were an aspect of the operations and because it was considered that a direct relationship between local sales and programming was likely.\n\nRegarding the relationship between programming and advertising, the Commission considers that other parties of the LSA would not allow for one party to lower unilaterally its investments in programming as it would likely decrease the total advertising received by the parties to the LSA. Similarly, each radio station should have an interest in maintaining its competitive position relative to other stations in the market, including those that are part of the LSA, as each radio station’s share of the advertising revenues will likely be based upon its own audience share. Indeed, a decline in audience share will have a negative impact on a licensee’s future advertising revenues and on whether the LSA is renewed or cancelled.\n\nAccordingly, the Commission is of the view that broadcasters will remain encouraged to invest in their programming to maintain the audience share of their stations, regardless of whether or not they are party to a LSA.\n\nHowever, to ensure that the implementation of LSAs is not made to the detriment of other broadcasters in a given market, the Commission finds that the impact of LSAs on the competitive balance of a market cannot be overlooked. Without safeguards, LSAs could make it increasingly difficult for new companies to thrive and could drive existing radio stations out of the market, negatively impacting the diversity of voices.\n\nAccordingly, the Commission is prepared to consider that LSAs meeting certain criteria do not fall under the definition of LMAs and that approval will not be automatically required for such LSAs.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission determines that LSAs will no longer be considered LMAs if they meet the following criteria:\n\nthe LSA does not involve a number of stations that is above the number of stations allowed in the COP;\n\nthere is confirmation that LSAs are set for a limited period of time, as a locked-in agreement would impact the effective control of the radio stations;\n\nthe ownership of all assets must remain with each licensee;\n\nseparate, distinct news and other programming services and management must be maintained;\n\neach licensee must retain responsibility for the news and other programming staff employed by its undertaking(s); and\n\nthe LSA includes a provision that prohibits parties of the LSA from acquiring exclusivity on advertising.\n\nThe Commission notes that allowing entry into certain LSAs could increase the advertising revenues earned by broadcasters by reducing competition amongst broadcasters within the local radio market, which could strengthen their ability to compete with other forms of media. In addition to having a positive impact on total revenues, LSAs could also create synergies in the marketing and sales functions that would reduce the expenses of broadcasters.\n\nThe Commission expects parties entering into LSAs that comply with the above-mentioned criteria to notify and file their agreement with the Commission 30 days prior to the execution of the agreement. This will enable the Commission to monitor how such agreements are being used by the industry and will ensure that the proposed LSA is in compliance with the criteria set out above, that such agreements are limited to sales, and that programming decisions remain controlled by the licensee. The Commission notes that LSAs which do not meet the above-noted criteria will still be considered to be LMAs and will still require pre-approval.\n\nWith the above safeguards, the Commission is of the view that it may be able to collect evidence on how this additional flexibility would be used and the impact of this flexibility on the industry and on the diversity of voices in a market. This evidence could be used in a future regulatory review.\n\nCCD contributions\n\nAs set out in paragraph 3(1)(e) of the Act, each element of the Canadian broadcasting system shall contribute in an appropriate manner to the creation and presentation of Canadian programming.\n\nOne of the ways radio stations contribute to this objective of the Act is through CCD contributions to support the development and promotion of musical and spoken word content for broadcast.\n\nCCD contributions are made in three primary ways: basic contributions, over-and-above contributionsFootnote 4 and tangible benefits.\n\nIn Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2020-374, the Commission sought comments on whether future CCD contributions would be sufficient to ensure that commercial radio and CCD funding continue to fulfill the Act’s policy objectives, on the formulas for calculating contributions, and on the current allocation formulas.\n\nBasic contribution levels\n\nPursuant to subsection 15(2) of the Regulations, a licensee operating a commercial station or ethnic station shall, if the licensee’s total revenues are more than $1.25 million, contribute annually to eligible initiatives $1,000 plus 0.5% of those revenues that are in excess of $1.25 million.\n\nPosition of parties\n\nSeveral parties submitted that basic CCD contributions should stay at current levels. Some interveners stated that altering the way CCD contributions are calculated could result in licensees being required to increase the CCD expenditures to maintain current contribution levels.\n\nSome interveners, including the CAB and Starboard Communications Ltd. (Starboard), submitted that the formulas for calculating CCD contributions should be modified to provide relief for broadcasters. Starboard added that modifications to the formulas to maintain or increase the current level of funding would cripple, if not eliminate, some smaller, private broadcasters.\n\nAdditionally, Leclerc Communications inc. (Leclerc) stated that should changes be required to the formula for calculating basic CCD contributions, such changes should not impose an additional burden on smaller broadcasters. In its view, any adjustments should take into account the number of stations operated by the licensee or its total revenues so that broadcasters who benefit the most from consolidation are the ones that will see increases in basic CCD contributions. One of the suggestions made by Leclerc is to increase the contribution rate of large broadcasters to 0.75% above the $1.25 million threshold.\n\nMany interveners argued that the future of music production financing lies with amending the Act to include online services.\n\nIn its intervention, the MinistÃ¨re de la culture et des communications du QuÃ©bec (MCC) submitted that a reduction in the total value of CCD contributions would have serious consequences on Canadian and QuÃ©bÃ©cois musical productions, which have faced challenges over the last few years. It argued that maintaining the current levels of available CCD funding should be a priority and that the current CCD requirements should be maintained to ensure the continued reach of Canadian content.\n\nThe Associations stated that current funding levels will not be sufficient and that if CCD funding is reduced over time, some or many campus and community radio stations will be in jeopardy. It added that Canadian broadcasters with multiple stations with more than $1.25 million in annual revenues should pay more than 0.5% of their annual revenues.\n\nADISQ proposed that the share of annual basic CCD contributions be revised in a more equitable manner by taking into account the revenues of the broadcasters. Specifically, it submitted that contributions should be based on revenues as a whole, not just the revenues after the $1.25 million threshold of each station. It also proposed a group-based approach whereby the contribution requirement would be calculated based on the ownership group’s revenues.\n\nFor its part, the Community Radio Fund of Canada (CRFC) submitted that if contributions continue to decline as forecasted, it will have to reduce the funds distributed to stations within the coming years, which would erode the capacity for community and campus radio stations to continue to function and vastly undermine the objectives set out in the Act. It proposed that licensed stations earning more than $1.25 million be required to contribute at least 1% of their annual revenues.\n\nCommission’s analysis\n\nCCD contributions are expected to decrease in the coming years due to the decline in revenues of the commercial radio market, a marked slowdown in new stations being licensed, and the unpredictability of tangible benefits stemming from ownership transactions. Since basic contributions are based on a percentage of the previous broadcast year’s annual revenues, those contributions would decrease at a consistent rate, reflecting the decreasing revenues of commercial radio stations. For their part, over-and-above contributions and tangible benefits will likely decrease significantly because of the decrease in new radio stations and in ownership transactions.\n\nMany interveners suggested that the Commission look to online players if it is seeking ways to increase contribution levels. In this regard, the Commission notes that the current proceeding only concerns commercial radio stations. The Commission also notes that while proposed legislative amendments may change the Act’s approach to online players, such changes have not been adopted by Parliament at the time this decision was rendered by the Commission. As such, the inclusion of online services into the CCD regime will be more appropriately addressed in a different proceeding if Parliament were to adopt the proposed changes, rather than as part of the present proceeding. However, while the future in this regard is still uncertain, the Commission is of the view that the approach taken towards CCD should be one that is readily adaptable to future changes.\n\nFew interveners were able to provide an answer as to how much money should flow into the CCD contribution system. However, some interveners, such as the CRFC and the MCC, submitted that decreasing CCD contribution levels would vastly undermine the fulfillment of the objectives set out in the Act.\n\nThe Commission considers that any new approach to CCD contributions should continue to provide some relief to smaller broadcasters and be equitable among all broadcasters. The chosen approach should also help offset the projected decrease in overall CCD contributions (basic and over-and-above contributions, and tangible benefits).\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission intends to initiate a follow-up proceeding to seek comments on modifying the approach to basic CCD contributions by calculating basic CCD payments based on the annual radio revenues of the ownership groups rather than on a station-by-station basis. As a preliminary view, the Commission considers that ownership groups should fall under one of three levels:\n\ngroups with revenues below $10 million would not be required to pay CCD contributions;\n\ngroups with annual revenues of $10 to $50 million would be required to allocate 0.5% of their annual revenues to CCD contributions; and\n\ngroups with annual revenues over $50 million would be required to allocate 1% of their annual revenues to CCD contributions.\n\nDepending on the outcome of the follow-up proceeding, the Commission may make amendments to the Regulations to implement any changes to the basic CCD contribution system.\n\nDiscretionary initiatives\n\nIn Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2020-374, the Commission sought comments on whether it should remove the option to allocate a portion of the contributions to discretionary initiatives, whether it should require broadcasters to spend discretionary CCD contributions in a specific region or geographic area, and whether the eligibility criteria for discretionary initiatives are still relevant. The Commission also sought comments on the possibility of requiring broadcasters to submit an annual report on their discretionary CCD spending.\n\nPosition of parties\n\nMany parties were opposed to the removal of the option to allocate a portion of CCD contributions to discretionary initiatives.\n\nThe OAB stated that proposals to eliminate or reduce discretionary initiatives would result in the loss of a variety of highly effective local programs. It added that local events provide a focus around which local artists can rally.\n\nIn the CRFC’s view, there are certain instances where discretionary funds have been used improperly and have not serve the objective of the Act, such as for marketing or promotional purposes. It argued, however, that despite these failings, there is still room for contributions to discretionary initiatives and that this aspect of CCD contributions should remain in its entirety because the intended use of those funds is still critical to fulfilling the mandate of the Commission and of the Canadian broadcasting system as a whole.\n\nSirius XM Canada Inc. (Sirius) stated that it has consistently demonstrated that the funding it devotes to discretionary initiatives has considerable value. It further argued that its discretionary CCD expenditures have proven to be far more effective and considerably more impactful for Canadian musical and spoken word talent than merely contributing to one of the designated funds.\n\nIn regard to the addition of a requirement that discretionary CCD contributions for individual stations be spent in a specific region or geographical area, most parties who provided a response to this question were opposed.\n\nIn regard to the possibility of requiring broadcasters to submit an annual report on their discretionary CCD spending, several parties argued that this would create an additional administrative burden.\n\nIn a joint intervention, the Canadian Independent Music Association, Advance â Â Canada’s Black Music Business Collective (Advance), Canadian Council of Music Industry Associations (including Alberta Music, Cultural Industries Ontario North, Manitoba Music, Music BC, Music Nova Scotia, Music NWT, Music PEI, Music Yukon, Music NB, MusicNL, MusicOntario, SaskMusic), Indigenous Music Alliance (IMA), Music Managers Forum Canada, Music Publishers Canada and the Songwriters Association of Canada (hereafter CIMA) stated their support of an annual report on discretionary CCD spending. For its part, Radio 1540 Limited (Radio 1540) suggested that the annual report include the number of third-language music and spoken word artists supported.\n\nCommission’s analysis\n\nMost parties indicated that they saw value in the ability to direct CCD funds to initiatives other than the required funds. In the Commission’s view, contributions to discretionary initiatives do provide value at the local level and allow flexibility to broadcasters to target initiatives that are of interest to a specific community.\n\nIn regard to imposing geographic restrictions, the Commission considers that this would create additional administrative burden. Furthermore, the proposed approach outlined above whereby basic CCD contributions would be based on the revenues at the ultimate owner level would complicate such restrictions further as some ownership groups have stations throughout Canada.\n\nIn regard to reporting on discretionary CCD spending, broadcasters have a responsibility to ensure that their contributions to discretionary initiatives meet the eligibility criteria and thus serve to fulfill the policy objectives of the Act. Currently, as part of their annual returns, licensees file proof of payment as well as proof of the eligibility of the initiative receiving a CCD contribution.\n\nThe process of verification of discretionary spending takes time and effort for both the industry and the Commission. Requiring broadcasters to file additional details as part of existing reports or a new report on their discretionary contributions, such as that proposed in Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2020-374, would add to the administrative burden for the parties involved. However, in light of the proposed approach for basic CCD contributions, such reporting would be less onerous for owners of multiple stations as they would likely only have to file a single report.\n\nWhile the additional details would provide insight into how discretionary funding contributes to the Canadian broadcasting system, the possible inconsistencies in the data provided would likely not allow for any meaningful comparison or analysis of the information submitted across broadcasters. Furthermore, minimizing any inconsistencies would require clear and easy to understand definitions and guidance for each data point that would be collected.\n\nThe Commission also notes that additional reporting may have the unintended consequences of broadcasters opting out completely or significantly reducing their discretionary spending because the reporting is too onerous.\n\nTherefore, the Commission considers that any new reporting requirement should balance the insight to be gained from the reports and the administrative burden that would be placed on all stakeholders by imposing such a requirement.\n\nIn light of the above, as part of the above-noted follow-up proceeding on CCD contributions, the Commission intends to seek comments on the appropriate level of information that broadcasters should provide in regard to the discretionary portion of their CCD contributions.\n\nEligibility criteria for CCD contributions\n\nThe Commission set out the eligibility criteria for CCD funding in Broadcasting Public Notice 2006-158 (the 2006 Commercial Radio Policy). In addition to FACTOR and Musicaction, the Commission considers that the following parties and initiatives are eligible for CCD funding: Â\n\nNational, provincial, and territorial music industry associations.Â\n\nSchools and education institutions that are accredited by provincial authorities. Such contributions must specifically benefit students of music and journalism, including scholarships and the purchase of musical instruments.\n\nInitiatives, including talent contests, for the production and promotion of local music and local music artists, particularly emerging artists.\n\nIndependent parties dedicated to producing new spoken word content that would otherwise not be produced for broadcast.\n\nAudio content initiatives that would further advance the fulfilment of specific objectives of the Canadian broadcasting system as outlined in the Act such as a community radio fund, Indigenous radio, and other specialized audio broadcasting services dedicated to serving the particular needs and interests of children, Indigenous Peoples, and persons with disabilities.\n\nThe eligibility criteria are based on the following guiding principles:\n\nCCD funds must be used to support, develop or promote Canadian musical or spoken word talent, including journalists;\n\nall CCD contributions must entail direct, out-of-pocket expenditures; and\n\nall expenditures must be directed to projects that go well above and beyond promotional activities and regular programming costs.\n\nThe policy is intended to be flexible so that licensees can contribute to a wide variety of initiatives, and to ensure that contributions have the best possible impact on Canadian musical and spoken word artists.\n\nPosition of parties\n\nIn its intervention, the CAB stated that the Commission should establish clearer criteria on eligibility and put in place a staff pre-clearance mechanism.\n\nAlternatively, Rogers indicated that the eligibility criteria set out in the 2006 Commercial Radio Policy are unnecessarily restrictive. Rogers added that it became apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic that the list of eligible initiatives is heavily focused on live events and performances.\n\nThe CRFC stated that more needs to be done through CCD contributions to support community radio stations. It proposed that community radio broadcasters be specifically included as eligible recipients. It also suggested that organizations that support Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour (BIPOC) musicians and broadcasters be included as eligible recipients.\n\nThe IMA and Advance stated that a large portion of the current activities eligible for discretionary CCD contributions do not effectively serve the purpose of developing and promoting diverse Canadian content. Specifically, the IMA stated that commercial radio stations should be mandated to spend a portion of their contributions directly on Indigenous events, presentations and artists through new allocations to existing music industry organizations like FACTOR and Musicaction, as well as through support of the National Indigenous Music Organization (NIMO).Â\n\nIn addition, First Peoples Radio (FPR) stated that Indigenous broadcasting is poorly funded and that the commercial radio sector has a role to play in supporting Indigenous voices. In its view, the Commission should use its regulatory authority to require that a portion of the mandatory CCD contributions made by commercial radio broadcasters are targeted specifically to the support of Indigenous broadcasting.\n\nAccording to Starboard, if the Commission decides that a portion of CCD contributions should be directed to Indigenous artists, FACTOR has ample reserves to accommodate such a request from within its existing resources.\n\nCIMA and Music Canada proposed that eligibility for federally-funded programs be expanded to include the Unison Benevolent Fund, which in their view plays a critical role in providing emergency financial relief and mental health counselling to artists, crews, technicians and other individuals across the country working in the music sector who are facing immediate crises.\n\nCommission’s analysis\n\nIn regard to the CAB’s request for clearer criteria and a staff pre-clearance mechanism for eligibility criteria, the Commission considers that the above-noted guiding principles continue to be a good foundation for the eligibility criteria. Furthermore, the Commission will continue to provide detailed eligibility guidelines as well as examples on the Commission’s Canadian Content Development Contributions and Eligible Initiatives web page, which provides a substantive description and list of discretionary initiatives that qualify as CCD expenditures.\n\nWith respect to the CRFC’s proposal, while community stations already benefit from the funding they may receive from the CRFC through its receipt of CCD contributions under the basic annual contribution mechanism or through mandatory tangible benefits triggered by ownership transactions, some broadcasters may wish to direct some of their discretionary contribution amounts to specific community stations for the purpose of developing and promoting Canadian musical and spoken word content for broadcasters, as is currently permitted for Indigenous radio stations. As such, the Commission considers it appropriate to indicate that community radio stations are eligible recipients of contributions. The Commission is also adding the CRFC by name, when it was previously eligible under the more generic descriptor of “a community radio fund.”\n\nIn regard to the proposal to add the NIMO to the list of eligible parties and initiatives, the Commission notes that little is known about the NIMO, a nascent organization, whether in regard to its structure, its activities or how it is supported financially. The Commission considers that more information is required before it can be added to the list. However, some of the NIMO’s activities may be eligible under the more general criteria of the eligibility list.\n\nIn addition, the Commission is of the view that, while the Unison Benevolent Fund may provide critical and valued support to music artists in times of need, the basic guidelines for initiatives eligible for CCD funding state that payments for career development must focus on the enhancement of talent. Contributions must not be directed to support costs such as those related to housing, transportation, or food. The Commission considers that eligible initiatives should continue to meet those basic guidelines.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission adds community stations to the list of eligible recipients of discretionary CCD contributions and amends the eligibility criteria to include audio-content initiatives by community radio stations and racialized people, as follows:\n\nAudio-content initiatives advancing the specific objectives of the Canadian broadcasting system as outlined in the Broadcasting Act, such as those created by community or Indigenous radio stations and other specialized audio-broadcasting services dedicated to meeting the particular needs and interests of children, Indigenous Peoples, people with disabilities, and racialized people.\n\nThe Commission will also request more information from the NIMO to determine whether it is eligible to receive discretionary CCD contributions as part of the above-noted follow-up proceeding on CCD contributions.\n\nAllocation of basic CCD contributions\n\nCurrently, as set out in subsection 15(5) of the Regulations, basic CCD contributions must be allocated as follows:\n\nat least 15% to the CRFC;\n\nat least 45% to FACTOR or Musicaction, or, if the licensee is licensed to operate an ethnic station or spoken word station, to any eligible initiative that supports the creation of ethnic programs or programming from Content Category 1; and\n\nthe remaining 40% to an eligible initiative of the licensee’s choosing.\n\nIn Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2020-374, the Commission sought comments on the way contributions are allocated to funds.\n\nPosition of parties\n\nIn its intervention, ADISQ proposed that 15% of basic CCD allocation go to the CRFC, 70% to FACTOR/Radio Starmaker Fund or to Musicaction/Fonds RadioStar, and 15% to eligible initiatives of the licensee’s choosing. Specifically, ADISQ proposed that a centralized fund disburse the 70% to be allocated to FACTOR/Radio Starmaker Fund and Musicaction/Fonds Radiostar. Within each language market, the two recipients would agree on a percentage to go to each.\n\nThe IMA suggested that an additional 15% in CCD contributions be added to the current FACTOR and Musicaction allocation for the benefit of Indigenous artists and the Indigenous-owned music industry through the work of those existing music industry bodies.\n\nThe CRFC proposed that 45% of basic annual contributions go to FACTOR or Musicaction, 40% to the CRFC and 15% to an initiative of the licensee’s choice.\n\nIn addition, some interveners suggested setting up new funds. Within these proposals, the CAB and the OAB suggested setting up a commercial radio news fund and the IMA and Advance jointly proposed redistributing the percentages and adding a fund to support the development of female, Indigenous and racialized artists.\n\nCommission’s analysis\n\nIn its intervention, ADISQ proposed that a centralized fund disburse the portion of CCD contributions that is allocated to FACTOR/Radio Starmaker Fund and Musicaction/Fonds RadioStar. While ADISQ did not specify who would be responsible for the centralized fund, the Commission considers that the four funds would benefit from the predictability of a set allocation formula, which would assist them with their short-, medium- and long-term planning.\n\nCurrently, Radio Starmaker Fund and Fonds RadioStar only receive CCD contributions stemming from ownership transactions through tangible benefits. While they do receive half of the contributions following each ownership transaction, and have, over the past few years, been the main recipients of CCD contributions, the unpredictability of the contributions stemming from ownership transactions is likely to have a negative impact on the two funds. In light of this unpredictability, the Commission considers that it would be appropriate to allocate some of the basic CCD contributions to the two funds, which would provide more stability in the funding they receive.\n\nWhile various interveners suggested a rebalancing of the percentages of CCD contributions going to the funds and eligible initiatives, some interveners also suggested reducing the percentage allocated to discretionary initiatives, allocating a percentage to new funds, and creating new funds. In this regard, the Commission notes that it can direct broadcasters to allocate CCD contributions to certain purposes and can also encourage the establishment of a fund to support those purposes. However, the Commission itself cannot create a fund.\n\nIn regard to the IMA and Advance’s proposed fund to support the development of female, Indigenous and racialized artists, the Commission acknowledges that additional support for the development of artists who represent equity-deserving communities of Canada is warranted. The Commission notes that some funds and eligible initiatives already allocate CCD funding to initiatives supporting Indigenous artists and Canadian diversity. While a fund such as that proposed by IMA and Advance would serve to fulfill objectives of the Act relating to diversity, it is unclear whether a separate fund is the best approach or whether the Commission should instead encourage or require that an increased portion of the contributions that broadcasters pay to already established funds and initiatives be directed toward supporting Indigenous artists and Canadian diversity. Moreover, such a fund, if it is deemed to be appropriate, should support Canadian diversity more broadly and not just focus on the three communities identified by the IMA and Advance.\n\nIn addition, the Commission is of the view that the commercial radio news fund proposed by the CAB and the OAB would run counter to one of the guiding principles for determining the eligibility of initiatives, namely that all expenditures must be directed to initiatives that go well above and beyond promotional activities and regular programming costs.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission intends to consider the following preliminary allocation formula for basic CCD contributions at the above-noted follow-up proceeding on CCD contributions:\n\nat least 15% to the CRFC;\n\nat least 15% to a new national fund to support Indigenous artists and Canadian diversity, Footnote 5 should such a fund be created (in the absence of such a fund, the Commission would expect that a portion of CCD contributions directly support Indigenous artists and Canadian diversity through eligible CCD initiatives);\n\nat least 25% to FACTOR or Musicaction (to be further allocated at 60% and 40% between the two funds, respectively);\n\nat least 25% to Radio Starmaker Fund or Fonds RadioStar (to be further allocated at 60% and 40% between the two funds, respectively); and\n\nthe remaining 20% to eligible initiatives.\n\nTangible benefits\n\nThe Commission does not solicit competing applications for changes to the ownership or effective control of broadcasting undertakings. As such, the burden is on the applicant to show that the application is the best possible proposal and that approval of the application is in the public interest, consistent with the overall objectives of the Act.\n\nOne of the ways to ensure that the public interest is served is for applicants to propose financial contributions, known as tangible benefits, proportional to the size and nature of the transaction, with the goal of engendering measurable improvements to the communities served by the broadcasting undertaking subject to a change in ownership or control, as well as to the Canadian broadcasting system as a whole.\n\nIn Broadcasting Regulatory Policy 2014-459, the Commission maintained its approach to radio ownership transactions, including the tangible benefits allocation levels to the various funds. Currently, tangible benefits must generally represent at least 6% of the value of the transaction and be allocated as follows:\n\n3% to the Radio Starmaker Fund or Fonds RadioStar;\n\n1.5% to FACTOR or Musicaction;\n\n1% to any eligible CCD initiative at the discretion of the purchaser; and\n\n0.5% to the CRFC.\n\nIn the past, tangible benefits typically accounted for the largest portion of total CCD contributions. However, since there are no guarantees of radio ownership transactions occurring, this type of financial support is unpredictable.\n\nPosition of parties\n\nSome parties called for the elimination of tangible benefits. Stingray Radio (Stingray) argued that the current approach may have been fair in a closed market system, but that radio now competes with services that are global in nature and have significantly greater access to capital. It further argued that any reduction in funding could be more than made up through levies on foreign online streaming services.\n\nSirius noted that given the Commission’s recognition that the commercial radio market is in decline and its assumption that radio revenues will continue to decrease, there is no policy rationale that could support an increase in the tangible benefits contribution.\n\nSome parties proposed a reduction of tangible benefits. In their interventions, both the CAB and Starboard proposed that the existing rate be reduced from 6% to 3%.\n\nFor its part, the CRFC stated that the minimum 6% allocation for tangible benefits should remain at that level, but that the 3% allocation for the Radio Starmaker Fund and Fonds RadioStar needs to be reviewed. It added that since this fund is operated solely by the CAB, commercial broadcasters are paying themselves to support a handful of already established Canadian musicians.\n\nFurthermore, the CRFC indicated that it would like to see an increased amount of support directed to community radio so as to ensure greater support for a wider range of Canadian artists and content creators. It proposed altering the formula to allocate 2% to the Radio Starmaker Fund or Fonds RadioStar and 1.5% to the CRFC.\n\nADISQ proposed that a specific percentage be allocated to the English- and French-language market funds, rather than leaving it to the discretion of the purchaser, which is currently the approach. Specifically, ADISQ proposed that the 3% of the value of the transaction to be allocated to the Radio Starmaker Fund or Fonds RadioStar and the 1.5% of the value of the transaction to be allocated to FACTOR or Musicaction be distributed at follows:\n\n3% of the value of the transaction to be allocated to the Radio Starmaker Fund and to Fonds RadioStar, with 60% of that sum to be directed to the former and 40% to the latter; and\n\n1.5% of the value of the transaction to be allocated to FACTOR and to Musicaction, with 60% of that sum to be directed to the former and 40% to the latter.\n\nPerth FM Radio Inc. (Perth FM) noted that the bulk of the tangible benefit designated for music and artist development programs are allocated in larger centres. It added that a greater share of these funds could be directed to benefit the city/town served by the licensee’s commercial radio undertaking by funding broadcast/journalism student internships at the local station, staff development and training, as well as expansion of the station’s local news capabilities.\n\nCommission’s analysis\n\nMost interveners were not in favour of an increase in the percentage (equivalent to a minimum of 6% of the value of the transaction) that must be directed to tangible benefits in an ownership transaction with some proposing that it be decreased to 3% or eliminating it entirely.\n\nDue to the unpredictability of the number and size of radio ownership transactions, CCD contributions stemming from such transactions cannot be counted on as a stable source of funding for the funds and eligible initiatives.\n\nHowever, it is still in the public interest to require that purchasers make financial contributions to CCD since the Commission does not solicit competing applications for changes to the ownership or effective control of broadcasting undertakings. Therefore, the Commission is of the view that tangible benefits should not be eliminated.\n\nIn regard to ADISQ’s proposal to allocate a specific percentage to English- and French-language market funds, the Commission notes that in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy 2014-459, it stated that this is already happening without Commission’s intervention. However, the situation has changed since 2014, with greater unpredictability regarding the number and size of ownership transactions within each linguistic market. The Commission is of the view that all funds would benefit from a more predictable and constant allocation between Radio Starmaker Fund and Fonds RadioStar and between FACTOR and Musicaction.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission finds that the current tangible benefits formula (i.e., a minimum of 6% of the value of the transaction) should be maintained. The Commission also finds that the current allocation for tangible benefits should be maintained, but specifies that of the 3% previously allocated to the Radio Starmaker Fund or Fonds RadioStar, 60% must now be directed to Radio Starmaker Fund and 40% to Fonds RadioStar, and of the 1.5% previously allocated to FACTOR or Musicaction, 60% must now be directed to FACTOR and 40% be directed to Musicaction.\n\nAs it has in the past, the Commission may choose to exercise its discretion and depart from this policy where it is of the view that the public interest would be furthered by granting an exception, based on the record before it at the time.\n\nCanadian musical selections\n\nThe Regulations define a musical selection as any live or recorded music of one minute or more in duration that is broadcast uninterrupted. Under subsection 2.2(2) of the Regulations, in order for a vocal musical selection to be considered Canadian, it must generally meet at least two of the following conditions:\n\nthe music is or the lyrics are performed principally by a Canadian;Footnote 6\n\nthe music is composed entirely by a Canadian;\n\nthe lyrics are written entirely by a Canadian; and\n\nthe musical selection consists of a live performance that is recorded wholly in Canada, or performed wholly in and broadcast live in Canada.\n\nThis is generally known as the MAPL system: Music, Artist, Performance and Lyrics. There are also special cases in which a musical selection can be considered Canadian, for instance, instrumental or musical compositions and selections that qualified as Canadian under previous regulations.\n\nThe main objective of this system is to enable Canadian artists, lyricists and composers to be discovered more easily by Canadian audiences and to strengthen the Canadian music industry, including the creative and production components.\n\nIn Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2020-374, the Commission sought comments on the definition of a Canadian musical selection and the application criteria. Furthermore, the Commission set out questions relating to the traceability and discoverability of Canadian artists, lyricists and composers for the industry and audiences.\n\nPosition of parties\n\nMost parties supported maintaining the current system since it has proven itself over the years. However, some parties stated that certain criteria needed to be updated as the online era has enabled the development of new audio production techniques that are substantively different from those of the analog era, when the Commission’s definitions were created.\n\nSpecifically, some parties proposed changes to the “Performance” criterion since physical location is no longer relevant, as well as to the “Music” and “Lyrics” criteria to allow them to be met if the composer(s) and artist(s) are primarily Canadian.\n\nMusic Canada proposed a six-point system wherein musical selections would be considered Canadian if they obtain three out of six points. Within that proposed system, three points could be allocated to music and lyrics, two points for artist and one point for key production components being either performed in Canada or by Canadians.\n\nIn its intervention, CIMA stated that the system no longer adequately reflects the realities of composing and recording music given that most songs are written by many co-writers and the recording can just as easily be done on a laptop as opposed to in a traditional recording studio. CIMA proposed a 16-point system that includes diversity criteria, in which a musical selection must obtain six points to qualify.\n\nThe IMA supported this proposition and stated that a point for Indigenous content should be included, but that the Indigenous music industry must be given the authority to define what is Indigenous in any amended system.\n\nThe Association des professionnels de l’Ã©dition musicale (APEM), supported by SOCAN, proposed to transpose the definition developed by MÃ©taMusique for Quebec content for Canadian content. Therefore, a musical selection would be Canadian if:\n\ntwo elements out of three are Canadian on an artistic level: writer (lyrics), composer (music) and primary artist; and\n\ntwo elements out of three are Canadian on the industrial level: initial producer, editor, and record label.\n\nThe APEM also noted that it wants the Commission to be more proactive in collecting data from broadcasters and sharing this information to ensure compliance with its regulations. It further stated that the definition of Canadian content should be compatible with certification using metadata.\n\nCommission’s analysis\n\nThe primary issues raised by interveners relating to the identification of Canadian musical selections relate to amendments to criteria and the points system, and access to a reliable open database, including metadata on musical selections, to make it easier to identify Canadian musical selections.\n\nThe current criteria for “Music” and “Lyrics” are met only if the music is composed, or the lyrics are written entirely by a Canadian. However, those are often collaborative efforts, and, in an increasingly connected world, it is not uncommon for artists from different countries to be involved. The FACTOR and Musicaction funds, as organizations associated with the Department of Canadian Heritage, already reflect this reality by considering writers and composers together and requiring that at least 50% of participants in the creation of a selection be Canadian.\n\nTherefore, the Commission is of the view that allowing the “Music” and “Lyrics” criteria to be satisfied if a musical selection is primarily composed or written by Canadians could better reflect current creative processes while still promoting and supporting Canadian artists.Â\n\nThe “Performance” criterion also led to numerous interventions from the music industry. Currently, this criterion directly concerns the geographic location where the musical selection is recorded, and is often problematic. The Commission notes that this criterion is by far the one least met, often due to lack of information, and rarely a deciding factor in obtaining Canadian certification status.\n\nSince the “Performance” criterion is only subject to self-assessment rather than established through standards or stricter systems such as those related to revenue collection or copyright regimes, it is very difficult to verify or identify, and evidence to make the determination is often incomplete.\n\nIn general, interveners proposed amending this criterion to move the emphasis from the recording location to the nationality of the producer of the musical selection.\n\nHowever, there is no universally accepted definition of producer. While the Commission could set a definition, the Commission notes that there was insufficient evidence to that effect on the public record. Further, the information that could be useful in identifying a producer is not currently attached to musical selections. As such, it would still be necessary to rely on self-identification by the contributors of a given musical selection or on broadcasters to manually add it to the selection.\n\nTherefore, the Commission considers that this modification would not resolve the problems with the criterion, as it would remain administratively burdensome to determine for the industry, inaccurate and difficult to verify, and would continue to be often incomplete or missed. Consequently, the Commission is of the view that changing the criterion so that it refers to the nationality of the producer instead of the production location will not facilitate the identification of Canadian musical selections.\n\nThe Commission is currently developing a digital monitoring system and an open database to simplify and automatize the process of identifying musical selections. This system relies on probative data that can be verified and anchored in existing metadata that are internationally standardized, such as the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC), the International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI) and the International Standard Musical Work Code (ISWC), codes that can be used to confirm the accuracy of the information for any musical selection. Such accuracy is essential to ensure the database is of high quality and that new selections can eventually be added to it automatically. Once it is made public, this database will greatly facilitate identification of Canadian musical selections and mitigate the risks of non-compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nRecognizing that the current “Performance” criterion is causing confusion, is often left out, or is placing an administrative burden on the industry, the Commission has tested various modifications to it to see if it could be improved and made compatible with the forthcoming database. Having found no satisfactory alternative, the Commission considers that this criterion should be removed from the process of identifying Canadian musical selections. The Commission acknowledges that this removal could impact some selections, but considers that it would be offset by the added flexibility granted to other criteria noted above.\n\nFurthermore, the Commission notes that removing one criterion from the system would have a direct impact on the points system since the proposed model would be comprised of three elements instead of four.\n\nMany interveners proposed a system based on more than four points, to include a certain number of criteria for Indigenous artists and artists from diversity groups. However, the Commission considers that the objectives of improving the representation of Indigenous artists and artists from diversity groups would be better met by incorporating other elements in the regulatory framework that are specifically designed to reach those objectives.\n\nSome interveners also suggested giving more importance to the “Artist,” either by considering that any selections performed by a Canadian would be deemed Canadian or by awarding two points to the selection, which would yield the same result.\n\nWhile the performers are the most visible, easily recognizable and identifiable contributors for audiences, the system is intended to support a variety of Canadian artists involved in the creation of musical selections. Therefore, the Commission considers that granting Canadian status to any selection that includes a Canadian performer may fail to support the contribution of other artists (i.e., songwriters and composers) to the creation of the musical selection, in addition to presenting the risk of reducing the diversity in the selections broadcast.\n\nAs such, the Commission is of the view that the adoption of a three-point system in which a musical selection must obtain at least two points to be considered Canadian would be the best option. The Commission considers that this approach will foster greater inclusion and acknowledge Canadian songwriters in the act of music creation, even in the context of collaborations, without unduly prioritizing the performers who are capable of having careers abroad and who no longer depend on airtime for the majority of their revenue.\n\nThe Commission acknowledges that, in specific cases, it would be impossible for a selection to be awarded the two required points. The Commission therefore proposes to allow exceptions where only a single point would be necessary for the selection to be considered Canadian. This would apply to all solely instrumental, classical, traditional jazz, world or traditional music repertoire.\n\nThe Commission notes that, as the conditions for a musical selection to be considered a Canadian selection are set out in the Regulations, it cannot change them without the Regulations being amended.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission intends to launch a proceeding seeking comments on proposed amendments to the Regulations whereby a musical selection would be considered Canadian if it meets at least two of the three following conditions:\n\nthe music is, or the lyrics are, performed principally by a Canadian;Â\n\nthe music is composed principally (at least 50%) by a Canadian; or\n\nthe lyrics are written principally (at least 50%) by a Canadian.\n\nThe Commission also notes that, as part of that proceeding, it would be open to considering alternatives to the “Performance” criterion were they beneficial to the industry, easily implementable though existing standardized metadata within the digital monitoring system and database.\n\nThe Commission also intends to seek comments on proposed amendments to the Regulations to maintain the status of Canadian musical selections that have been considered Canadian under the current MAPL system, as well as to apply the new criteria and points to all existing and new musical selections going forward. This would mitigate any negative impact on existing musical selections created by any future amendments to the Regulations while promoting flexibility and diversity when identifying Canadian selections.\n\nContent categories and subcategories\n\nContent categories and subcategories are used by the Commission and radio licensees for the purpose of classifying musical selections, defining station formats and calculating Canadian content.\n\nThe Commission has traditionally considered content categories and subcategories to be an important tool for identifying and encouraging musical variety in the broadcasting system as a whole. The content categories and subcategories for radio are set out in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy 2010-819 and are referenced in the Regulations.\n\nThe two music content categories for commercial radio stations are content category 2 (Popular Music) and content category 3 (Special Interest Music).\n\nContent category 2 includes pop, rock and dance, country and country-oriented, acoustic, and easy listening genres. All musical selections listed in the charts such as Adult Contemporary (AC), Hot AC, Pop Adult, Album-Oriented Rock (AOR), Contemporary Hit Radio (CHR), Alternative, Modern, Adult Alternative, Active Rock, Dance, R&B, Urban, and Techno, compiled and published by music trade publications, belong to content subcategory 21: Pop, rock and dance, and are included here. This category is subject to a 35% Canadian content quota during each broadcast week and during peak hours.\n\nContent category 3 includes musical selections from the concert, folk and folk-oriented, world beat and international, jazz and blues, non-classic religious and experimental genres. Licensees of commercial radio stations are not required to broadcast Special Interest Music unless they are subject to a specific condition of licence to this effect. Content category 3 is subject to a 10% Canadian content quota, while content subcategory 31: Concert is subject to a 25% Canadian content quota, and content subcategory 34: Jazz and blues, a 20% Canadian content quota.\n\nIn Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2020-374, the Commission sought comments on whether content quotas were still appropriate, whether the availability of recordings in specialty genres (i.e. content category 3) was still limited, whether some genres should be protected, and what the impact would be should content categories be eliminated.\n\nThe Commission also sought comments on a proposal stemming from the review of the regulatory framework for FVM applicable to the French-language commercial radio sector (the FVM proceeding), which was initiated by Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2015-318,Footnote 7 to move elements from content subcategory 21: Pop, rock and dance (specifically urban, hip hop and rap music) and content subcategory 22: Country and country-oriented to content category 3.\n\nPosition of parties\n\nIn its intervention, the CAB opposed moving elements from content subcategories 21 and 22 to content category 3. Instead, it proposed eliminating content category 3 requirements for non-specialty, mainstream commercial radio stations.\n\nThe CAB also proposed that the Commission update the 5% relief on broadcast requirements for Oldies formatsFootnote 8 by setting the benchmark year to 2001 for English-language licensees and 2010 for French-language licensees.\n\nFor its part, Leclerc supported moving elements of subcategories 21 and 22 to content category 3 and also requested flexibility in regard to the management of musical catalogues for content category 3 musical selections by not moving them to content category 2 when they are listed on charts.Â\n\nFurthermore, Leclerc proposed a number of changes to the administrative tools and procedures made available to broadcasters by the Commission. These procedural changes would allow popular music stations to change to specialty music formats simply by notifying the Commission, which would expedite decisions on specialty stations. Moreover, the Commission would make chart publications available to broadcasters.\n\nThe Associations supported maintaining the Commission’s approach to categorizing musical selections. They considered that the approach remains useful for the commercial radio sector and that its elimination could reduce funding to specialty musical artists. They noted that improved tagging, metadata and searchable artist catalogues, including a catalogue for the music of Indigenous artists, could help broadcasters to find a greater diversity of artists.\n\nIn addition, the Associations stated that moving subcategories 21 and 22 to content category 3 could negatively impact Canadian artists in these genres. Instead, they proposed moving soul and doo wop, rhythm & blues from the fifties and sixties, pre-1965 rock & roll, rockabilly, neo-rockabilly, surf and neo-surf, progressive rock, reggae, dancehall, ska and rocksteady, and funk from content category 2 to content category 3 due to the lack of Canadian selections available in these genres. Moreover, the Associations proposed moving spiritual music to content subcategory 35: Non-classic religious, and to change the wording so that it refers to music of all religious faiths.\n\nStarboard supported maintaining the current approach to musical selections and genres, stating that eliminating these categories could lead to stations migrating to more mainstream formats, which would be detrimental to musical variety in the market.\n\nCommission’s analysis\n\nThe Commission notes that the majority of interveners agreed that the categorization of musical genres remains a necessary tool for broadcasters and is an important tool for the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission considers that it should continue to categorize musical selections.\n\nContent subcategory 35: Non-classic religious\n\nThe Commission notes that the definition of content subcategory 35 may be perceived as restrictive and should be broadened to more clearly represent the diverse spiritual and religious identities of Canadians.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission amends the definition of content subcategory 35: Non-classic religious as follows:\n\nContent Subcategory 35: Non-classic religious\n\nThis refers to spiritual and religious music of all faiths.\n\nThe Commission considers that this amendment will make the definition more inclusive and will provide more flexibility to broadcasters that are subject to a condition of licence for this content subcategory by allowing them to add more variety to their programming and better represent the diversity of Canadian society today.\n\nMoving elements from content subcategories 21: Pop, rock and dance and 22: Country and country-oriented to content category 3 (Special Interest Music)\n\nThe lower Canadian content requirement for content category 3 musical selections compared to content category 2 was set because of the more limited availability of Canadian recordings in specialty genres.\n\nTherefore, moving urban, hip hop and rap, country and country-oriented to content category 3 may have the effect of reducing discoverability and funding to Canadian artists of these genres since there will be less of an obligation for radio stations to broadcast Canadian music in these styles. Furthermore, the Commission has found no indication that there was a lack of availability of Canadian selections in these very popular genres.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission finds that it would be appropriate for urban, hip hop and rap, country and country-oriented music to remain in their current subcategories.\n\nContent category 2 (Popular Music) and content subcategory 21: Pop, rock and dance\n\nThe Commission notes that interveners emphasized the onerous administrative burden associated with determining how content category 2 musical selections are categorized for compliance purposes.\n\nSpecifically, the way that content subcategory 21 is currently defined means that any musical selection from content category 3 can be moved to content category 2 if it begins to receive more airplay and moves higher in the charts.\n\nIn the Commission’s view, revising content subcategory 21 would facilitate the provision of the diverse programming content that serves the needs and interests of Canadians.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission amends the definition of content subcategory 21: Pop, rock and dance to eliminate the reference to charts, as follows:\n\nThis refers to music from the entire pop, rock and dance music spectrum. Examples include all types of rock music, including soft rock, hard rock, classic rock, heavy metal, modern rock, alternative rock, jazz rock, folk rock, and blues rock. It also includes pop, rock & roll, rhythm & blues from the fifties and sixties, soul, dance, techno, rap, hip hop, urban, and contemporary rhythm & blues.\n\nThis amendment will allow for musical selections that chart to continue to be playable by specialty radio stations, enhancing their competitive position without reducing programming diversity. Furthermore, the amendment will ensure that artists and their designated representatives retain artistic ownership over the identification of a musical selection’s genre.\n\nBroadcasting Regulatory Policy 2022-333, also issued today, which outlines the changes noted above pertaining to content subcategory 35: Non-classic religious and content subcategory 21: Pop, rock and dance, replaces Broadcasting Regulatory Policy 2010-819. Furthermore, the Commission intends to launch a proceeding to propose amendments to the Regulations to change the reference to Broadcasting Regulatory Policy 2010-819 to refer to Broadcasting Regulatory Policy 2022-333.\n\nProcess for a station to change to a specialty station format\n\nAs set out in Public Notice 1995-60, radio stations operating in the specialty FM format specialize in the broadcast of, for example, ethnic programming, news or talk programming, traditional or special interest music programming, or a combination of different kinds of special programming. The Commission considers that a separate format for specialty radio stations is, among other things, a useful tool for increasing the variety of programming available to listeners.\n\nIn its intervention, Leclerc proposed permitting popular music radio stations to become specialty radio music stations by way of notifying the Commission 30 days prior to the change in programming format.\n\nThe Commission is of the view that a change to a radio station’s format is a significant request. As such, the Commission considers that simply notifying the Commission of such a change would not ensure that important features of the licensing process, such as market impacts, programming diversity and the individual circumstances of a radio station would be adequately addressed.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission finds that a licensee wishing to change its station’s format to that of a specialty radio station should continue to be required to file a Part 1 application under the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Rules of Practice and Procedure requesting that its conditions of licence be amended.\n\nCanadian content requirements for content category 2 (Popular Music)\n\nAs set out in section 2.2 of the Regulations, radio stations holding commercial licences must, in a broadcast week, devote at least 35% of their musical selections from content category 2 (Popular Music) to Canadian selections broadcast in their entirety.\n\nA broadcast week is defined as seven consecutive broadcast days, beginning on Sunday. A broadcast day begins at 6:00 a.m. and ends at midnight the same day. To ensure that Canadian musical selections are not relegated to off-peak hours, subsection 2.2(9) of the Regulations requires that at least 35% of the Popular Music broadcast between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., Monday to Friday, be Canadian.Â\n\nIn Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2020-374, the Commission sought comments on the impact of Canadian content quotas on Canadian broadcasters, artists and audiences.\n\nPosition of parties\n\nMost interveners submitted that Canadian content requirements on commercial radio stations have had a significant and positive impact on the discoverability of Canadian music and have contributed to the development of an independent music industry in Canada.\n\nThe CAB indicated that, in the current environment marked by increased consumer choices and changing music listening habits, stringent Canadian content requirements are negatively affecting radio broadcasters’ viability and do not represent consumer demand. It further stated that a shift is needed, whereby the number one priority going forward should be to maintain the viability of private radio, including its role as a local news and information medium.\n\nSpecifically, the CAB proposed that Canadian content requirements for Popular Music be reduced to 25%, a level which it stated would still be 2.5 times higher than the market share of Canadian music on streaming platforms. In addition, the CAB recommended an emerging artist credit so that every spin of an emerging artist would count as 1.5 spins against Popular Music requirements.\n\nThe OAB stated that financial incentives could be introduced to help achieve content levels higher than the CAB’s proposed 25%.\n\nOn the other hand, parties from the music sector viewed Canadian content requirements for Popular Music as a key mechanism to ensure the visibility of Canadian artists and the remuneration of songwriters and music publishers. Most interveners from the music sector suggested that the Commission maintain the current Canadian content requirement at 35% for Popular Music, and that further requirements be introduced to support greater diversity in the Canadian musical selections broadcast by commercial radio stations.\n\nSpecifically, the CIMA stated that, in addition to maintaining Canadian content requirements for Popular Music at 35%, the Commission should address the over-representation of well-known Canadian artists in the current musical selections heard on commercial radio either by mandating that a certain portion of the quota be dedicated to emerging artists or by creating a maximum cap for the portion of the quota that can be"
