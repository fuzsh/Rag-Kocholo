        "text": "On Saturday 26th November 2022, the Advisory and Action panel of MeCCSA's Radio Studies Network is holding a one-day Conference, marking the centenary of the BBC. The event is being hosted by our colleagues at the University of Bedfordshire - Luton Campus. We have two delightful (and guaranteed to be insightful) keynote speakers arranged, so far:\n\nProfessor David Hendy - Writer, broadcaster and Professor Emeritus of Media and Cultural History at the University of Sussex, and Dr. Gurvinder Aujla-Sidhu - Associate Professor Journalism, University of Derby.\n\nThis is the Call for Papers, which we circulate to academics, but practitioners and independent researchers are also welcome to submit their proposals to participate and present their work/ideas for 15 minutes each, as part of the day's activities.\n\nThis year, 2022, marks the 100th anniversary of the BBC. Regular domestic broadcasts commenced on 14 November 1922 using the then-new technology of wireless radio. The organisation became the British Broadcasting Corporation, with a Royal Charter and funded by a listener licence fee in January 1927. Today’s corporation is not only larger, but more diverse and under great pressure to demonstrate public value in the digital era. The BBC has, at times, found itself respected and revered but also resented or disliked. Nonetheless, BBC radio remains a significant force in ‘entertaining, informing and educating’ populations both within the UK and globally. It maintains a consummate reputation for legitimacy, accuracy, and impartiality despite political pressures. Over the past 100 years, BBC radio has also shown considerable resilience throughout technological and cultural developments such as the roll out of television and commercial radio sectors, and the multiplicity of audio platforms now available to audiences.\n\nThis one-day conference, presented by the MeCCSA Radio Studies Network, will celebrate but also critically consider both radio as a medium and this British institution, bringing together researchers and practitioners to explore key themes regarding BBC Radio’s contribution to society:\n\n· The trajectories and possible developments that legislation, technologies and cultural and sociological changes might bring.\n\n· How radio is adapting to co-exist with other technologies rather than being usurped by them.\n\nThe event will feature keynote speakers, panel presentations, and networking opportunities. Following the conference, there will be the opportunity for submission to a peer-reviewed symposium edition of the Journal of Radio and Audio Media, November 2023.\n\nThe MeCCSA Radio Studies Network invites proposals for 15-minute presentations from academics, independent researchers, archivists, postgraduate students, and broadcast professionals and practitioners. We are open to critical perspectives and encourage comparative case studies too, in addition to any papers with a more celebratory tone. We are happy to receive proposed panels comprising no more than 4 papers each but reserve the right to organise these as we think best.\n\nProposals are invited that focus on, but are not limited to, the following key themes:\n\n● Perspectives on BBC Radio as a public service broadcaster\n\n● The ongoing cultural relevance of radio in terms of reporting on, shaping and reflecting our society\n\n● The reach, value, and impact of BBC Radio news\n\n● BBC Local Radio, digital services, BBC Sounds\n\n● The role of BBC World Service Radio and BBC services overseas\n\n● Broadcaster and audience diversity and inclusivity\n\n● BBC Radio’s engagement with community broadcasters\n\n● The role of BBC Radio in the representation of minority and under-represented communities\n\n● BBC Radio and its relationship with its audience(s)\n\n● BBC and the public sphere\n\n● Digital technologies and the changing nature of audiences and their influence on BBC Radio\n\n● BBC School Radio, Bite Size, Academy - appealing to new audiences, children, youth and young adults\n\n● The development and impact of new radio production and broadcast practices, skills and technologies\n\n● Policies and potential; the extent to which BBC Radio achieves its aims\n\n● The importance of creating, curating and keeping accessible archives\n\n● BBC Radio’s financial future\n\n● BBC Radio as a training ground for broadcasters and centre of excellence\n\nSubmitting a proposal\n\nPlease use the following format for proposals:\n\n● Name, affiliation, and email\n\n● Title of paper or presentation\n\n● 250-word abstract\n\n● 100-word biography\n\n● Send proposals as a Word doc by email to: radiostudiesnetwork@gmail.com\n\n● Deadline for proposals: midnight, Monday 13th June 2022\n\nConfirmation of conference papers/panels accepted will be emailed by 18th July 2022"
