        "text": "By David Bart\n\nIn response to an inquiry made to the Radio Club of America, I have researched the origin of the word “radio” and share the following with our members… The word radio, as currently and most often used, is a synonym for a form of “electromagnetic radiation”. It first came into use before Heinrich Hertz’s proof of the existence of radio waves. After the discovery of Hertzian waves, it would take almost 20 years for the term “radio” to be universally adopted.\n\nSPARKS AND IDEAS\n\nThe concept of electrical discharge and detection dates back at least to the 1780s, with George Adams’ discovery of sparks discharging between conductors in Leyden jars and Luigi Galvani’s famous experiments with frog legs. By the mid-19th century, Joseph Henry, Samuel Varley, Thomas Edison, David Hughes, George Gabriel Stokes and others were all interested in electromagnetic induction and the propagation of electrical sparks and possible applications. James Clerk Maxwell published his famous theoretical basis for the propagation of electromagnetic waves in his 1871 paper to the Royal Society, “A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field”. No shortage of famous researchers and inventors, and their supporters, would start to use the word “radio”; and many have debated who discovered various aspects of radio first, making claims about the use of “waves” to transmit and receive energy. Indeed, Jagadish Chandra Bose, Eduard Branly, Oliver Lodge, Guglielmo Marconi, Alexander Stepanovich Popov, and Nikola Tesla are just a few (in alphabetic order). But what about the actual word “radio”? Where does it first show up?\n\nEARLIEST USES\n\nThe word “radio” is derived from the Latin word “radius”, meaning “spoke of a wheel, beam of light, ray”. It was first applied to communications in 1881 when at the suggestion of French scientist Ernest Mercadier, Alexander Graham Bell adopted “radiophone” (meaning “radiated sound”) as an alternate name for his photophone optical transmission system. However, this invention would not be widely adopted. Following Heinrich Hertz’s discovery of the existence of radio waves in 1886, a variety of terms were initially used for this radiation, including “Hertzian waves”, “electric waves”, and “ether waves”. The first practical radio communications systems, developed by Guglielmo Marconi in 1894 - 1895, transmitted telegraph signals by radio waves, so radio communication was first called “wireless telegraphy”. Up until about 1910, the term “wireless telegraphy” also included a variety of other experimental systems for transmitting telegraph signals without wires, including electrostatic induction, electromagnetic induction and aquatic and earth conduction, so there was a need for a more precise term referring exclusively to electromagnetic radiation. By this time, the idea of “radio” as distinct from “wireless” was taking hold, and various new organizations were forming around “radio” as a new field of study.\n\n(L-R) Heinrich Hertz, Eduard Branly, Ernest Jules Pierre Mercadier, Alexander Graham Bell. (Courtesy Wikipedia)\n\nOriginally, “radio” was a general prefix meaning “radiant” or “radiation” — hence “radio-activity” for the alpha, beta, and gamma rays emitted by decaying atoms. In Europe, some of the persons investigating Hertz’s discovery began to employ the “radio-” prefix to describe the new phenomenon. For example, in 1890, Edouard Branly, writing in his native French, called his coherer-receiver a “radio-conducteur”. This usage spread to other languages. Thus, a December 29, 1897 Electrical Review report on “Hertzian Telegraphy in France” noted that “Mr. Branly... calls these receivers ‘radioconducting tubes’.” Other compound usages soon followed. A letter in the January 21, 1898 issue of The Electrician (London) suggested that the term “radio-telegraphy” might be preferable to “wireless telegraphy”, and the October 24, 1902 issue included an article titled “The Radio-telegraphic Expedition of the H.I.M.S. ‘Carlo Alberto’”, while “The Wireless Telegraph Conference”, in the November 20, 1903 issue of the same magazine, included numerous references to “radiotelegrams”, “radiograms”, “radiographic stations” and “radio-telegraphy”. A report about Belgian marine applications in the November 19, 1904 Electrical Review noted that “radio-telegraphy has entered into the domain of current practice”. The 1906 Berlin Radiotelegraphic Convention helped spread use of this new term to the United States, and the November 10, 1906 issue of Electrical Review reported this conference had dealt with “the growing use of wireless telegraphy -- or rather, radio-telegraphy -- as we suppose we should say now, since this new designation was adopted by the conference”. There was some skepticism about the change. In the preface to the 1910 edition of his book Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony, William Maver, Jr. wrote: “This author is aware that the authorized designation of wireless telegraphy and telephony is radio-telegraphy and radio-telephony, but for present has adhered to the earlier appellations.” Eventually, compound terms such as “radio-telegraphy” and “radio-telephony” were shortened to just “radio”, with perhaps the first example in English being the British Post Office’s December 30, 1904 “Post Office Circular”, which included instructions for transmitting telegrams that specified that “The word ‘Radio’... is sent in the Service Instructions”. This practice was adopted internationally two years later in 1906 by the Berlin Radiotelegraphic Convention, which specified that “Radiotelegrams shall show in the preamble that the service is ‘radio’.”\n\n(L) Front cover of the program produced for the dinner given by the Submarine Telegraph Companies at the International Telegraph Conference of 1903, and (R) front page of the Radiotelegraph Convention produced at the International Radiotelegraph Conference of 1906 in Berlin. (Courtesy ITU) One of the first persons to popularize this new term in the United States was Lee DeForest. In early 1907, he incorporated the DeForest Radio Telephone Company, and in a letter about the need for government oversight published in the June 22, 1907 Electrical World, he warned that “Radio chaos will certainly be the result until such stringent regulation is enforced.” But it was the Navy that did the most to publicize the new word in the U.S., which added “(Radio)” to the title of the 1913 edition of its Manual of Wireless Telegraphy (Radio) for the Use of Naval Electricians by LCDR S. S. Robison. This well-known resource had been in publication since 1906. The Navy also published its Naval Radio Service Handbook of Regulations in 1913, describing message handling procedures, commercial practices, and other subjects.\n\nONLINE ETYMOLOGY DICTIONARY\n\nThe Online Etymology Dictionary notes: • radio (n.)…”wireless transmission of voice signals with radio waves,” 1907, abstracted or shortened from earlier combinations such as radio-receiver (1903), radiophone “instrument for the production of sound by radiant energy” (1881), radio-telegraphy “means of sending telegraph messages by radio rather than by wire” (1898), from radio- as a combining form of Latin radius “beam” (see radius). Use for “radio receiver” is attested by 1913; sense of “sound broadcasting as a medium” also is from 1913. • radio (v.)…”transmit by radio,” 1916, from radio (n.). Related: Radioed; radioing. An earlier verb in the same sense was Marconi (1908), from the name of Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi (1874-1937), pioneer of wireless telegraphy.\n\nJanuary 2, 1909 Minutes of the first meeting of the Junior Wireless Club, later renamed as the Radio Club of America (Secretary Book).\n\nOctober 21, 1911 Minutes where the Junior Wireless Club renamed itself as the Radio Club of America (Secretary Book).\n\nFrederick Lewis Allen described the onrush of the word in Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the 1920s, published in 1931. “In the winter of 1921-22, radio came with a rush. Soon everybody was talking, not about wireless telephony, but about radio. A San Francisco paper described the discovery that millions were making: ‘There is radio music in the air, every night, everywhere. Anybody can hear it at home on a receiving set, which any boy can put up in an hour.’ In February, President Harding had an outfit installed in his study, and the Dixmoor Golf Club announced that it would install a ‘telephone’ to enable golfers to hear church services.” The Reading Eagle, in Reading, Pennsylvania, stated in March 16, 1924, “It is not a dream, but a probability that the radio will demolish blocs, cut the strings of red tape, actuate the voice ‘back home,’ dismantle politics and entrench the nation’s executive in a position of power unlike that within the grasp of any executive in the world’s history.” As early as July 1921, the New York Times was calling it wireless telephony, and wireless remained widespread until World War II, when military preference for the word “radio” firmly established it as the word. The word “radio” was used as an adjective by at least 1912, “by radio transmission;” meaning “controlled by radio”. It continues as the proper name of a particular radio station or service, “radio station or service from ___” since at least 1920, as in a radio shack as a small outbuilding housing radio equipment. Thus, “radio” came to be.\n\nRCA AND “RADIO”\n\nThe Radio Club of America was founded in 1909 as the Junior Aero Club, and was immediately reconceived as the Junior Wireless Club, Ltd.; co-founded by a group of teenaged boys who were fascinated by wireless, the inventor E. Lillian Todd, and some of their parents. The new Junior Wireless Club operated separately from its predecessor, The Junior Aero Club. In 1911, the Junior Wireless Club changed its name to the Radio Club of America (RCA). RCA is the world’s oldest radio communications society, or club. By 1912, two other organizations, The Society of Wireless Telegraph Engineers (SWTE) and The Wireless Institute (TWI), had also formed, and merged, to create the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) as a professional association dedicated to the new fields of wireless telegraphy and radio. Two years later in 1914, the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) was established to promote the interests of the growing number of amateur radio operators. Today, the IRE’s legacy continues in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), following IRE’s 1962 merger with the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). From Hertz to Ham Radio to iPhones, the most interesting thing to me is that the public has lost touch and does not realize it is using “radio” in its everyday lives. Radio is now a disconnected topic. Younger people (under age 50) have gone “digital”, and they no longer seem to realize that their cell phones are, in fact, radio transmitters and radio receivers. It is up to us to remind them of the celebrated history of radio and to reinvigorate their interest in the ongoing technology that is serving everyone so well in the radio spectrum.\n\nSOURCES\n\nD.

Matthieu Dugal, from the SRC/CBC radio show Moteur de recherche, hosted a panel discussion at ÉTS on the future of telecommunications. The panel was also broadcasted live on the radio and internet from a special event station XWA-1 as part of a graduation project aimed at replicating the technical feat achieved by the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada 100 years ago.\n\nCOMMEMORATIVE EVENT\n\nDenis Couillard from Ultra Communications (formerly known as the Canadian Marconi Company) and Ghyslain Gagnon from ÉTS Montreal coordinated activities. Parks Canada canceled their participation, including a guest appearance from a government minister, the night before the event due to rapidly rising COVID-Omicron cases across Canada in the first weeks of December. ÉTS, Ultra and their other partners regrouped that same night and went forward with the event. The group wanted to recognize completion of the student project that started two years earlier, and wanted to allow engineers and radio-enthusiasts to commemorate the December 1919 broadcast programs of XWA. Event activities were located just a few hundred feet from the actual site of the Marconi station’s December 1919 regular test broadcasts.\n\nSpecial event temporary exhibit featuring posters and radio artifacts (operational vintage AM receivers from 1930s to 1970s and a military grade RF diplexer).

In late 2019, Ultra and ÉTS initiated the student project together with Carleton University and support from Communications Research Center Canada (CRC), Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), La Société Radio-Canada (SRC i.e. the French language CBC). The ambitious project, which celebrated the 100th anniversary of radio broadcasting in Canada, mobilized six teams of senior engineering students over two years to design, build,\n\nA 1918 Gramophone supplied by Musée des Ondes Emile Berliner played 1918-20 records to provide ambiance and also music for the XWA-1 RF and IP broadcast.

December 17, 2021 marked the completion of this unique project; which showed how resourceful, highly motivated students could undertake and successfully complete a very demanding engineering project, despite severe interruptions, obstructions and constraints imposed by the COVID crisis. Several ÉTS and Ultra engineers and technicians directly supported this effort which culminated in the radio and IP broadcast of the project on XWA-1, an AM1350 station conceived and built by students. The XWA-1 station 5m high antenna was installed on the main ÉTS building roof, and the broadcast was received by the vintage AM receivers on-site and distributed live to a larger audience via the Internet streaming system set-up by the students for the event.\n\nTHE COMMEMORATION\n\nOn December 17, 2021, in commemoration of the December 1919 first, regular, radio broadcast, test programs of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada’s XWA experimental station, a special event station XWA-1 broadcasted music from a 1918 gramophone and held a discussion panel moderated by Matthieu Dugal, a well know SRC/CBC radio host. The well attended Panel was entitled “Telecommunications of the Future” and included the Ultra Director of Solutions Development Denis Couillard, SPARK Systems founder and ÉTS Professor Frédéric Nabki, and ÉTS Professor and National Research Chair Annie Levasseur. Other participants to the celebration included François Gagnon (Director General of ÉTS), Ghyslain Gagnon (Dean of Research at ÉTS), Alain Cohen (President of Ultra Communications), Keith Blanchet (Vice-President Sales & Marketing at Ultra), an Ultra company field technician who had supported the students, and many professors, students, and radio enthusiasts. The event was hosted at ÉTS and included an exhibition of radio technology history and innovations that Ultra and ÉTS had jointly created. The activities were a success and provided everyone a chance to network afterward at a wine and cheese gathering courtesy of the sponsor Musée des Ondes Emile Berliner, a local Montreal Museum dedicated to the protection and interpretation of audio and radio waves heritage.\n\nIEEE MILESTONE\n\nThe IEEE has since approved the installation of an IEEE Milestone Plaque, proposed by Ghyslain Gagnon and Denis Couillard. The Milestone process involves a proposal application, research and compilation of supporting documentation, and working with experts to prove and support the merits of the achievement, which are ultimately reviewed and approved by the IEEE board of directors. David Bart on the IEEE History Committee served as the IEEE History Committee Milestone Advocate. Dr. Marc Raboy, Beaverbrook Professor Emeritus in Ethics, Media and Communications Department of Art History and Communication Studies McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada was one of the experts. James Kreuzer, the Librarian and Assistant Curator from the Antique Wireless Association, served as the second expert. Both David Bart and Jim Kreuzer are long time members of the Radio Club of America, and they enjoyed this opportunity to support Canadian recognition of Marconi’s achievements. Parks Canada intends to install the plaque later in 2022. The plaque will read: Milestone: Emergence of Radio Broadcasting with Experimental Station XWA, 1919 Location: Montreal, Canada Citation: By December 1919, from this site, licensed experimental station XWA (later named CFCF) was broadcasting regular programs of recorded music and news, helping to establish commercial radio. On 20 May 1920, XWA broadcast a live radio event, reaching an audience assembled in Ottawa, 170 km away. The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada used a 500W YC-3 military transmitter and adapted wireless telephony technology for this achievement.

The early pioneering years are not always well documented, and some achievements were accomplished in similar timeframes in Europe and North America. Montreal and its XWA experimental station played a significant role in defining the new path for radio and creating a new industry. Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada licensed its XWA experimental station at the end of 1914, carryingout radiophone transmission tests as early as March 1919. XWA established regular broadcasting test programming on weeknights in December 1919, broadcasting news, weather, recorded music and live music performances with a 500W transmitter for its Montreal audience. XWA transitioned to permanent programing with a 100 miles range “national” Montreal-Ottawa broadcasting event that captured the Canadian public imagination on May 20, 1920. The pioneering work of MWTCC and XWA engineers led to the establishment of a significant number of commercial French- and English-language radio stations in May 1922 that brought live music, sports, theatre plays, social discussion, and political debates into homes, significantly changing how Canadians consumed information and entertainment. As the industry continued to expand in the 1930s, these commercial stations provided the initial infrastructure for national radio and formed the basis for the public broadcasting system in Canada. Unlike many other commercial stations of the era, XWA conducted various tests and transmissions during World War I since it was granted an experimental station license in late 1914 to help provide technical support and wireless operator training to the Canadian Army and Navy. Owned and operated by the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada (MWTCC), XWA was first located at the company’s Rodney Street factory in Montreal, before relocating in 1918 to the upper floor of the company’s new factory on William Street (Griffintown). XWA experimented with radiophones and explored new commercial applications of the technology as early as March 1919, months before the end of the war (June 28, 1919) and before the formal Canadian government restrictions to nonmilitary use of the airwaves were lifted (April 15, 1919). Starting in spring 1919, XWA engineers conducted numerous AM voice transmission tests over water and land in the Montreal area. Local radio amateurs and ships in the vicinity participated with the tests. Test broadcasts in fall 1919 on a more powerful 500W transmitter including gramophone recordings received an enthusiastic public response that convinced MWTCC that commercial broadcasting might be a viable business opportunity. In fall 1919, the company sets-up its new Scientific Experimenter, Ltd. branch at 33, McGill College Avenue to manage the sales and promotion of its radios and radio components to the general public, thus facilitating the acquisition of radio broadcast receivers by amateurs. Regular audio broadcasting test programs started on December 1, with XWA broadcasting news, weather forecast, recorded music and even live music performances on Monday and Saturday afternoons and on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday nights. By January 1920, the original idea of using broadcasting as a means to significantly increase sales of radio apparatus took hold, and MWTCC managing director A.J. Morse eventually decided to gamble on this opportunity. On May 20, 1920, under the technical leadership of MWTCC Chief Engineer J.O.G. Cann, a national broadcasting event was organized between XWA Montreal and the Royal Canadian Society assembled in Ottawa and supported by the Canadian Naval Service. That night, a series of speeches, music recordings and live music performances were broadcast over more than 160km (100 miles) in both directions. This grand Montreal-Ottawa two-way broadcasting demonstration took place almost one month before the celebrated June 15, 1920 broadcast by the Marconi Chelmsford Works radio station in England. MWTCC’s earliest production of commercial receivers emerged around this time, with MWTCC’s Model C designed at the William Street factory that same year (1920) and offered for sales to the general public in 1921 and 1922. It consisted of three separate boxes, a passive tuner, a detector and a 2-tube amplifier. When complete with tubes, amplifier, antenna and batteries, the Model C was offered at 195 $CAN which at the time represented more than half the price of a new Ford Model-T car. Montreal-based Northern Electric Canada also offered a regenerative radio receiver kit (“Coupled Circuit Tuner with Tuned Feedback”) for amateurs in 1921.\n\nCLOSING\n\nThe work by the MWTCC and XWA engineers between March 1919 and May 1920 led the way to establishing many commercial stations and to the subsequent emergence of the public broadcasting system in Canada.\n\nMarconi Experimental Radio Station XWA, Montreal, during its famous Montreal-Ottawa broadcast on May 20, 1920.

CFCF is considered Canada’s first commercial radio station, and one of the first radio stations in the world. The station left the air 90 years later, on January 29, 2010. We look forward to the installation of the IEEE Milestone later in 2022, and hope to see everyone at another live event to celebrate these achievements.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\n\nProfessor Ghyslain Gagnon obtained a bachelor’s degree (B.
