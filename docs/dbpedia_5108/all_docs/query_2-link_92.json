        "text": "Our history\n\nOur History\n\nThe seed for Farm Radio International was planted nearly 50 years ago in rural Zambia when a man named George Atkins had a simple, but really good idea.\n\nIt was 1975 and George, a Canadian farm radio broadcaster, was out in the Zambian countryside with his African colleagues as part of a workshop he was running. As they travelled around interviewing farmers, George asked them about the radio shows they had created recently.\n\nWhen a broadcaster from Sierra Leone said that his latest broadcast was about maintaining spark plugs on tractors, George was surprised. The conversation that followed went something like this:\n\n“But how many farmers have tractors in Sierra Leone?” George asked.\n\n“Oh, about one in eighty thousand.”\n\n“And how big is your audience?”\n\n“Huge ... 800,000.”\n\n“Then,” George asked, “You’re actually talking to only ten farmers? Don’t you think it would be better to talk about oxen than tractors?”\n\nGeorge quickly came to learn that farmer programs across Africa were usually not aligned with the needs of their listeners.\n\nWhy? There simply wasn’t widely accessible information about farming techniques that could help small-scale farmers. Most of the information available had to do with the large-scale, mechanized farming of developed countries.\n\nHis idea was simple: find low-cost and no-cost ways to help some of the world’s most vulnerable people — small-scale farmers — and share them via the world’s most accessible communication device: radio.\n\nDetermined to get his idea off the ground, George took a sabbatical from the CBC to travel the world in search of ideas to help small-scale farmers and new contacts in the world of rural radio broadcasting.\n\nWhen he returned to Canada, he established the Developing Countries Farm Radio Network and worked on producing radio resources to send overseas.\n\nOn May 1, 1979, he and his family mailed the first package of scripts and tapes to 34 broadcasters in 26 countries.\n\nThat, of course, was just the beginning. Since then, the organization now known as Farm Radio International has sent more than 100 script packages, and our network includes more than 1,300 radio stations in 38 countries with a distinct focus on sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n1979\n\nThe Developing Countries Farm Radio Network (DCFRN) is founded and the first script package is sent out.\n\n1984\n\nWe secure our first project funded by CIDA (now Global Affairs Canada), allowing us to expand our script-sharing services and create a library of resources on sustainable agriculture to mail to partner broadcasters in the Global South.\n\n1986\n\nDCFRN becomes a registered charity in Canada.\n\n1991\n\nThe George Atkins Communication Award is established to recognize excellence in rural radio broadcasting.\n\n2003\n\nWe decide to narrow the focus of our work to where we know we can make the biggest impact: sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n2005\n\nWe enter into a strategic partnership with WUSC and move our office from Toronto to Ottawa.\n\n2007\n\nWe begin the African Farm Radio Research Initiative (AFRRI), a 42-month project to assess the effectiveness of farm radio in improving the food security of farming families. The project is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n2007\n\nWe start Farm Radio Weekly (now Barza Wire), an online news service sharing stories and resources about rural communities in Africa, which broadcasters can use to enhance their programs.\n\n2008\n\nWe change our name from DCFRN to Farm Radio International / Radios Rurales Internationales to reflect the bilingual nature of our work.\n\n2009\n\nWe complete the first round of Participatory Radio Campaigns, which reached an estimated 40 million listeners in 5 countries.\n\n2010\n\nFarm Radio Trust is established as an independent strategic partner in Malawi.\n\n2013\n\nWe run a reality radio show in Mali to encourage young people to take up farming. Learn more about the FarmQuest project. The concept was one of the winners of the Rockefeller Foundation 2012 Innovation Challenges Competition.\n\n2014\n\nWe open “The Hangar,” a radio and ICT innovation lab at our office in Arusha, Tanzania.\n\n2014-15\n\nWe develop Uliza Interactive, a suite of services that combines radio, mobile phones and interactive voice response systems to enable listeners to communicate and exchange information with their radio station quickly, easily and free of charge.\n\n2015\n\nOur work on youth mental health is the focus of a three-part documentary film by Omar Dabaghi-Pacheco of the CBC called Mental Health on Air.\n\n2015\n\nWe develop our “Her Voice on Air” approach to amplify the voices of women listeners and overcome some of the barriers that women face to calling in to radio programs. This initiative marks an increasing focus on gender equality in our work, and we will later use a similar approach in our \"Scaling Her Voice on Air\" project to promote gender equality among farming families.\n\n2016\n\nWe use radio and mobile phones to gather input from nearly 4,000 Tanzanians for the Government of Canada’s International Assistance Review. We will later refine this approach as On Air Dialogues and use it to bring rural Africans’ perspectives on key issues to global policy events like the United Nations Food Systems Summit.\n\n2018\n\nWe host a workshop in Ghana to develop a new sustainable radio program format, called the Green Leaf Radio Magazine. This format features seven segments tailored to meet the needs of farmers, including one for sponsor advertisements to generate revenue for the station. We will go on to use this unique format in projects developing e-extension systems in Ghana and Uganda.\n\n2019\n\nThe Liz Hughes Award for Her Farm Radio is established to recognize radio programs that address gender equality and amplify the voices of rural women.\n\n2020\n\nOur 1,000th radio partner joins our network.\n\n2020-21\n\nWe quickly adapt our work to support broadcasters and their communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, using distance methods and the unique reach of radio. Our COVID-19 response project earns us a WSIS Prize for Media. We also run projects supporting economic recovery from the pandemic and promoting COVID-19 prevention and vaccine confidence.\n\n2022\n\nWe launch our “On-Air for Gender-Inclusive Nature-based Solutions” project, which deepens our involvement in climate work. This five-year project uses high-impact radio programs to share stories of rural communities working with nature to adapt to climate change and support other communities in doing the same.\n\n2022\n\nWe launch our statement of values to reflect our commitment to communication justice — when the human right to seek, receive and impart information and express ideas and opinions is equitably available to all regardless of frontiers or barriers.\n\n2023\n\nWe conduct research with the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) to test the use of automatic speech recognition to transcribe Luganda-language voice recordings from listeners. Learn more.\n\n2023-24\n\nFor the first time, the radio programs broadcast through our projects reach more than 100 million potential listeners.\n\nOur Founder\n\nGeorge Stuart Atkins\n\n1917-2009\n\n“I have to pinch myself when I think of the people who are helped by this service that is available to them by just turning on their radio.”\n\nGeorge grew up on his family’s farm near Oakville, Ontario. After graduating from Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph and doing post-graduate studies in Wisconsin and Colorado, he went on to be a farmer himself.\n\nFarming was George’s first career. His second was in radio. He began doing farm-related broadcasts while still farming full time. In 1955, he gave up farming to work for the CBC.\n\nOver the next 20 years, he became a fixture on the National Farm Radio Forum, various farm radio programs, and on television.\n\nIn 1979, George founded what would later be known as Farm Radio International. Little did he know that this organization would go on to improve the lives of tens of millions of the world’s most vulnerable people.\n\nFor his work serving small-scale farmers around the world, George was honoured as a member of the Order of Canada in 1989. While George left us in 2009, his legacy is alive and well. And the world is better for it.\n\nThe George Atkins Communications Award\n\nCanada’s Farm Radio Forum\n\nThe story of Farm Radio International goes back even further, to the early 1940s.\n\nIn 1941, the newly established Canadian Broadcasting Corporation started a weekly rural listening group project called the Farm Radio Forum. For more than 20 years, farmers gathered across the country to listen to and discuss agricultural programs. The Forum also included a regional report-back system that collected farmers’ feedback, ideas, and experiences for future broadcasts and to share with relevant government bodies.\n\nThe Canadian farm radio experience went on to influence agricultural broadcasting elsewhere in the world — and not only through our work. A UNESCO report on the Farm Radio Forum encouraged India, Ghana, and France to adopt it in their programming. After all, good ideas have a way of spreading."
