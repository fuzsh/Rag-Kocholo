        "text": "Hey oberosle,\n\nThanks for posting in the Community.\n\nSorry to hear that you're experiencing this. Could you tell us what's the exact response you're getting after saying the command you usually use? Also, does it happen when you try to ask for other radio station?\n\nLet's try first to set your primary language to French and see if this would fix the issue:\n\nOn your mobile device, open the Google Home app .\n\nTap Settings Google Assistant Manage all Assistant settings.\n\nTap Languages Choose languages for speaking to your Assistant Add a language.\n\nChoose from the list of available languages.\n\nLet me know if this works for you.\n\nBest,\n\nPrincess\n\nHi oberosle,\n\nAwesome — glad to hear that you were able to find a workaround. Thanks for sharing your resolution in the Community! You may also check if you’ve set English and French as your Google Assistant language by following the steps Princess has provided. Let me know if you have other questions and concerns, otherwise; I will be locking this thread after 24 hours.\n\nBest,\n\nAlex"
