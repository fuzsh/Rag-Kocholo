        "meta_description": "The BBC radio feature, originally influenced by the documentary film movement, combined music and sound with speech that at first was scripted, later recorded on location, along with ‘actuality’. This paper will ask ‘whose speech?’ A memorandum from BBC Director General, John Reith, in 1924, had insisted that “only those who have a claim to be heard above their fellows on any particular subject… should be put on the programme”. Nevertheless, from the 1930s onwards, there was a continuing effort on the part of more politically-minded producers to extend the range of voices heard on the air. The BBC’s North Region, where it was easier to escape Reith’s centralising control, led the way. Pioneering initiatives used the cumbersome recording apparatus of the time to reach into people’s homes and work-places to capture working class voices. After WW2 this example was followed in other regions, until, belatedly in the late 1950s, the BBC began to accept the use of portable recording. By this time a Europe-wide culture of radio feature-making had developed, influenced by the French exploration of musique concrète and the flourishing German Hörspiel, and fostered by the Prix Italia and the International Features Workshop. British features producers contributed to this movement and won some success with highly-crafted, aesthetically innovative features. The paper concludes by examining examples of the voices heard in BBC radio features in the last decade of the 20th century.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n“In some stations I see periodically men down to speak whose status, either professionally or socially, and whose qualifications to speak, seem doubtful. It should be an honour in every sense of the word for a man to speak from any broadcasting station, and only those who have a claim to be heard above their fellows on any particular subject in their locality should be put on the programme.” (Memo from Director-General John Reith to Station Directors, 3 March 1924. Cited in Briggs 1961: 256)\n\n“Radio could be the most wonderful communication system imaginable…could be, that is, if it were capable not only of transmitting, but of receiving, of making the listener hear but also speak, not of isolating him but connecting him.” (Brecht 1930)\n\nNorthern dissidence\n\n5 Bridson, pp. 52-53.\n\nIt seemed to me that since its inception, broadcasting by the BBC had been the exclusive concern of ‘us’, and listening the lucky privilege of ‘them’. That the man in the street should have anything vital to contribute to broadcasting was an idea slow to gain acceptance. That he should actually use broadcasting to express his own opinion in his own unvarnished words, was regarded as almost the end of all good social order.\n\nWho spoke in the 1930s?\n\n11 Wilfred Pickles, Between You and Me, (London, Werner Laurie, 1949), p. 94.\n\nhad most of the qualities the BBC looked for: he was steady, correct, just a voice without emotion, and his announcements were precisely right in every detail, cold and without feeling\n\n8The BBC was a decidedly male and middle-class institution. Tom Burns, in his study of the BBC, wrote of this period\n\n13 Tom Burns, The BBC: Public Institution and Private World, (London, Macmillan, 1977) p. 42.\n\nThe BBC was developed under Reith into a kind of domestic diplomatic service, representing the British – or what he saw as the best of the British – to the British. BBC culture, like BBC standard English, was not peculiar to itself but an intellectual ambience composed out of the values, standards and beliefs of the professional middle class, especially that part educated at Oxford and Cambridge. Sports, popular music and entertainment which appealed to the lower classes were included in large measure in the programmes, but the manner in which they were purveyed, the context and the presentation, remained indomitably upper middle class\n\n9Even so, a number of producers in the Talks and Features departments, holding decidedly left-wing views, were committed to finding, as Scannell and Cardiff sum up,\n\n14 Scannell & Cardiff , pp.176-177.\n\nmethods of presenting ordinary people, their experience and points of view …. part of a trend…to shift the relationship between communicators and audiences away from distanced, authoritarian patterns towards more relaxed, informal and interactive styles of communication.\n\n10At this time, radio features programmes commonly used shorthand to take down what was said at interviews. An edited version was produced as a script for delivery live in the studio, either by actors or by the interviewees themselves. In the latter case the effectiveness of their contribution was inevitably reduced both by their inexperience of reading in such a situation and the requirement to ‘perform’ themselves. London-based control over what could be said, as well as the difficulty of working with the ponderous technology then available, led to an impressive collaboration between producers, writers, composers, actors, musicians and the technical staff responsible for creating ‘sound effects’. Music, much of it specially composed, played its part in the development of the genre, as did poets like Louis MacNeice and Dylan Thomas, writing features that often lifted the narration to a declamatory level. And it was this British version of the radio feature that delivered morale-boosting programmes during the war on the national network, the Home Service.\n\nAfter the war\n\n12From 1945, Features producers were given their own separate department, headed by Laurence Gilliam. In this period, Gilliam presided over a number of notable programmes - Dylan Thomas’s Under Milk Wood was only one of those which won recognition with an award in the early years of the Prix Italia, started in 1949. At this time, diversity in the range of recorded opinion was not foremost in Gilliam’s idea of the genre.\n\n17 Laurence Gilliam, B.B.C. Features, (London, Evans Bros, 1950), p.10.\n\nThe significance of the feature programme is … that it is the form of statement that broadcasting has evolved for itself, as distinct from those other forms which it has borrowed or adapted from other arts or methods of publication. It is pure radio, a new instrument for the creative writer and producer.\n\n20 Peter Leonhard Braun, ‘International Features Conference – the Genesis’, https://ifc2.wordpress.com (...)\n\nWe learned how to write using acoustic sequences rather than language. We started to forget the typewriter, using the new tools of documentary production instead. We wrote with the microphone, the tape recorder, the scissors and the sound mixer.\n\n14The BBC radio feature ploughed its own furrow. It had won respect and awards in European competition with its grandiose, dramatic panoramas, but it did not fully embrace the new trend. It was in the radio play that the BBC first used musique concrète - for Beckett’s All That Fall in 1957. This was the first project undertaken by the BBC’s Radiophonic workshop which went on to support the surrealism in plays by Samuel Beckett and British dramatists Giles Cooper and Tom Stoppard.\n\n15Donald McWhinnie’s production of All That Fall was the first of a number of plays in this new style (for which, he acknowledged, Pierre Schaeffer was the “guiding light”), describing it as\n\n21 Donald McWhinnie, The Art of Radio, (London, Faber & Faber, 1959), p.87.\n\nAn inextricable conception of word and special sound and an exploratory flight into a new territory of sound. The words were designed to evoke, and be reinforced by, new sounds, sounds never heard before, and to be themselves subjected to technical processes which would achieve emotional effects (with the human voice as a basis) quite different from anything the actor can do on his own.\n\nRecorded voices\n\n28 ibid. p.194, emphasis in original.\n\nthe finished product …. is far from raw; these are poems, full of technique, aesthetic judgments and formed decisions and selection, self-consciously developed towards an ultimate cultural and emotional effect…works that are ultimately crafted celebrations.\n\n22As we have seen it was a fruitful time for the radio play. In the same Department, a handful of features producers were exploring a way to dramatize human experience reached through listening to, and recording, the voices of ‘ordinary’ people. A number of forces were at work in effecting this trend. Working class culture had been celebrated in the widely-read Uses of Literacy by Richard Hoggart (1957); more widely-viewed, working class voices were the staple of popular TV soaps like Coronation Street, and in shows like Rediffusion’s Ready Steady Go, presented by Liverpool-born Cathy McGowan, brought in straight from the company’s typing pool to present the show. The folk movement on which The Radio Ballads had drawn for its inspiration had now began to use portable recording to rescue the memories and performances of older singers and story tellers; the pirate Radio Caroline, first heard in April 1964 had, with other North Sea pirates, brought an American informality of presentation style that appealed to young listeners bored with the BBC. When the Labour government closed down the pirates this young audience was appeased by the creation, in 1967, of the pop channel BBC Radio 1. The same year, older listeners were able to hear their own regional accents in the first wave of BBC local radio stations whose mainstay was the phone-in. 1969 saw the publication of Broadcasting in the Seventies which outlined plans for a changed shape of networks, including Radio 4, the renamed Home Service. Hendy, in his definitive study of the new network, summarises its\n\n31 ibid. p.245.\n\nfurther step along the road to a less elite and more demotic style of broadcasting. If ordinary people’s opinion was still treated warily, their experiences and their feelings were now central to the broadcasting mission. As the BBC’s Assistant DG put it, producers were now simply “less inclined to take pundits at face value”. ‘Ordinary’ people- ‘real’ people – were in favour. Programmes were after authenticity.\n\nInternational influence\n\n33 Plowright, interview with author, 2013.\n\nFor me, the experience of going to the IFC…[was the realisation] that what Europe was saying about British BBC features was quite true… that we were very conservative. We had a presenter, and cut away interviews, and a little bit of sound, but not much. I think we learned a great deal from these conferences – I certainly did.\n\n35 Plowright, interview with author, 2013. Emphasis added.\n\nAt the same time, I think there was something very good about the BBC tradition. It’s always rooted in what people actually say. I felt quite a lot often with European features - and actually also the Australian - it seemed to be an auteur piece, the producer having fun, but not really moving you, and I do think…if you don’t touch the listener, and you don’t care yourself and it’s just a game, fun as that can be, and there’s room for it, as there is in music, then I don’t think you’ve really made a programme that will stand time. And I think the BBC brought a sort of grittiness to the oyster – to the pearl of European IFC tradition.\n\n25The use of people’s words and the emotions they invoke – the points italicised above – are, for Hendy,\n\n36 David Hendy, Life on Air: a History of Radio Four, (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 380.\n\nthe signatures of his [Plowright’s] oeuvre: closely observed portraits gently lobbed in the listeners direction in the hope of starting a few ripples of emotion and thought\n\n26Hendy describes Piers Plowright and his colleague, John Theocharis, a few years into their assignment to the Drama Department,\n\n37 ibid. p. 224.\n\nworrying away at the blurred boundary between drama and documentary…with a whole succession of more intimate location recordings where people’s voices, people’s stories and the little things in people’s lives all predominated…Radio was discovering that…no matter how little ‘ordinary’ people knew of high politics or great literature, each every one of them was undoubtedly the leading expert of his or her own life.\n\n27With features producers Peter Everett, Piers Plowright, Matt Thompson and others,\n\n38 ibid. p. 381, citing Matt Thompson.\n\nthe temptation to add layer upon layer of sound was often eschewed for programmes “as transparent as a glass of tap water”\n\n28On hearing this comment read to him, Plowright was prompted to recall the first time he realised the value of letting people speak.\n\n39 Plowright, interview with author, 2013.\n\nWell, that’s very nice. I think it happened to me almost accidentally. And I can remember the programme which was called Nobody Stays in This House Long [11 June 1983] which won an Italia Prize to my amazement because it was a very simple programme. This was two old people living in a house, and it simply began as that – an interview with two old people living in a house… And out of this I realised I hadn’t made a programme about people in a house, I’d made a programme about time, history, loss, change – social change, but all within a half hour piece in which two people spoke and took us round this ancient house.\n\nSo all these metaphors that came rolling out from ordinary life was what I thought was powerful and I don’t think you needed to do a great deal of elaborate [explanation] – I used to mock the French because – they’ve done lovely things - but there was always this rather intense voice in the front philosophising, not letting you get through to the people who you were hearing.\n\nManagerial shackles\n\n29How did Plowright and his contemporaries choose who would speak? We have seen that, in Hendy’s words, “ ‘ordinary’ people- ‘real’ people – were in favour”, but the extent to which producer’s choice was based on their own judgement began to be reined in by administrative change, ironically by a system known as ‘Producer Choice’, introduced in the mid-1990s. Reflecting in 2013 on his 1983 programme, Plowright said\n\n40 Ibid.\n\nIn those days – and this is something that has changed - you could simply swan off with a microphone and possibly an Outside Broadcast engineer and do what you like. I hadn’t even proposed this idea, I don’t think…The change for the bad, I think, in terms of commissioning is that you have to go through so many gates to get to the heavenly kingdom, to get a result\n\nConclusion\n\n32By the mid-1990s. the radio feature had found a style which reflected the more informal discursive exchanges to be found in everyday life. A combination of speech and actuality subtly conveyed authenticity, with stories carrying the messages individual producers wished to make. But at the highest levels of management, the interpretation of the social zeitgeist had to be balanced with the need not to incur criticism from government, which controlled the level of the BBC’s income – the licence fee – reviewed at intervals usually of five years. A particularly ruthless reform was carried out between 1993 and 2000 by John Birt, whose mission as Director-General was to save the BBC from privatization by the Conservative government. Managerial systems were introduced that relied on internal competition (‘Producer Choice’) and outsourcing, and, through market research, also on a calculation of audience needs that dominated policy. Individual producers had to launch their proposals through a complex series of filters, uncertain as to who finally was making the decision about their ideas. It was as if the ‘claim to be heard’ had shifted from the potential contributors to the producers themselves, having to repeatedly justify their creative choices according to managerial criteria, their claim ultimately handicapped by self-censorship.\n\n33Over the past quarter of a century, a range of social media has become available on the internet, now the vehicle for myriad voices. These days there is no lack of space to voice opinion, but does it provide ‘connection’ in the Brechtian sense? We have seen that the BBC’s search for the voices of ordinary people has had its limitations. Today, it is perhaps more important than ever to investigate who the ordinary person is understood as being, and who decides whose voice matters."
