        "meta_description": "The habit of government control engendered by the Great War ensured the emergence of a public broadcasting corporation over a set of private initiatives: but, even so, this required the exceptional drive and sense of mission of John Reith. The latter’s character is still credited, by many, with leading the BBC’s quest for the Holy Grail of broadcasting – media impartiality: yet the Earl of Crawford felt, in 1925, that Reith had a “swelled head”. The imprint of the latter on the BBC’s character and aims – balance and neutrality – seems rather to embody another fundamental principle: that of “unified control,” a paternalistic, central authority which determined what the BBC was, and what it was for… This article discusses the nature and impact of such an approach on the organisation, staffing and programming at the BBC from its beginnings to the eve of the Second World War. Ethical, even priggish, definitions of “entertainment” could collide with modernist flights of imagination, and yet the two complemented each other in a superior vision of what could be offered to audiences: both at home and throughout the empire. In respect of the latter in particular, however, was the BBC not already in denial of the gathering pace of international change, and working with an already outmoded view of Britain’s capacity to control it?",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Controller\n\n13 HC, Hansard, 6 July 1936, col. 975.\n\nhe has some defects of his qualities. I expressed them in a note in the report. I think that he tends to be dictatorial and a little impatient of criticism. Like many men of his great ability, he rather likes to be surrounded by “yes” men. I think that he tends to rule a little by fear.\n\nA Beveridge for the Soul?\n\n17Reith, the arch-traditionalist, could no longer accommodate as Director of a BBC department such an unconventional figure. True, Matheson wished her broadcast material to be uplifting. But her purpose was clearly at odds with that of the man in charge. Reforming the listener’s taste in the direction of greater individual formal awareness and appreciation was not the reform of public taste that Reith preferred – i.e. national moral consolidation rather than personal aesthetic education. Matheson was a potential rebel at the heart of the structure which Reith had so painstakingly engineered, and threatened to undermine the national energy of which he saw himself as custodian. Tinkering in the elitist, modernist margins was a distraction: it was the national good which had to be preserved and encouraged over and above any intellectual coterie of doubtful morals. Dignity, community and respectability, these were not modern: Reith’s fabled impartiality meant protecting these values against all attempts at subversion, against any barbarian breach of the perimeter of his moral civitas. One of the clearest expositions of his position was included in a detailed memorandum of information which Reith provided for the Crawford Committee, and deserves to be quoted in full here. Broadcasting, said the memorandum:\n\nhad emerged from the first flush of scientific wonder. It had to be accepted as part of the permanent and essential machinery of civilisation. People were now turning to a more prosaic but more fruitful consideration of its potentialities as an instrument of social good. The BBC had founded a tradition of public service and of devotion to the highest interest of community and nation. There was to hand a mighty instrument to instruct and fashion public opinion; to banish ignorance and misery; to contribute richly and in many ways to the sum total of human wellbeing. The present concern of those to whom the stewardship had, by accident, been committed was that those basic ideals should be sealed and safeguarded, so that broadcasting might play its destined part.\n\n18Reith’s mission statement, in tones which sound almost Gladstonian in their reforming zeal, prefigures in its breath of vision, its sense of rhetorical urgency and its hopes for national improvement, the work of that other Liberal reformer, Beveridge, who so took to heart the national good. Beveridge, arguably, was concerned above all with the national body, Reith with the nation’s opinions and its well-being, its mind and soul. The BBC is on a mission to civilise, and is thus, he believes, fulfilling a destiny.\n\nMission unattainable\n\n20Reith’s conviction that he was better placed than the politicians to administer/govern was nowhere more apparent than in respect of colonial and imperial affairs, which – he felt – were being allowed to run to ruin, and in respect of the insufficiently exploited capacity of broadcasting, in his view, to help stop this rot."
