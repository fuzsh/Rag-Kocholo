        "text": "Meryl Streep, narrator in Rufus Wainwright’s Dream Requiem\n\nThe three-time Oscar winner and nine-time Golden Globe winner will perform in Rufus Wainwright’s new work in Paris on Friday 14th June. The premiere takes place at 20:00 at the Auditorium de Radio France with the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, the Maîtrise de Radio France and the Choeur de Radio France, conducted by the orchestra’s music director Mikko Franck. Streep will read Lord Byron’s poem ‘Darkness’, written in July 1816.\n\nIntroducing the Dream Requiem, Rufus Wainwright writes: “The music speaks of death, but I wanted it to be inspiring and full of hope at the same time. The work combines two soundworlds: The Latin Requiem text is sung by a large mixed choir, children's choir and soprano soloist while the Byron text ‘Darkness’, which describes an environmental catastrophe, is spoken by a narrator. Dream Requiem was conceived during the COVID-19 pandemic and is also about the people we have lost during that crisis, for the loss of human connection that we all experienced.\n\n\"Like probably the rest of the world, I have admired Meryl Streep ever since I saw the first movie with her. I have had the pleasure of getting to know her personally over the last few years and apart from being the most incredible actress, she is also one of the most warm-hearted human beings I know. To have her be part of the world creation of the Dream Requiem is an honour beyond anything I could have hoped for. Thank you, Meryl, for trusting me and giving your incomparable voice, heart and spirit to this piece.\"\n\nRufus Wainwright’s Dream Requiem: an ode to humanity receives its world premiere on 14th June 2024 at the Auditorium de Radio France in Paris\n\nDream Requiem stems from two creative and musical ideas which matured in parallel in Rufus Wainwright’s mind and which were brought together in 2020 by two events of dramatic consequence: the COVID-19 pandemic and the California wildfires.\n\nMeryl Streep - biography\n\nFor almost 45 years, Meryl Streep has continued to bring a varied and vivid array of characters to life in a career that has cut its own unique path from the theater through film and television. Educated in the New Jersey public school system through high school, Ms. Streep graduated cum laude from Vassar College and received her MFA with Honors from Yale University. She began her professional life on the New York stage, where she quickly established her signature versatility and verve as an actor. Within three years of graduation, she made her Broadway debut, won an Emmy for Holocaust and received her first Oscar nomination for The Deer Hunter.\n\nShe has since won three Academy Awards, and in 2018, in a record that is unsurpassed, she earned her 21st Academy Award nomination for her role as Katharine Graham in The Post.\n\nShe was most recently featured in season three of Hulu’s hit series Only Murders in the Building. Just before that, she starred in the first episode of the television series Extrapolations, an eight-part series exploring the human stories circling the effects of climate change in the near future on Apple TV+. She was also recently seen in Adam McKay’s Don’t Look Up for Netflix, Ryan Murphy’s film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical The Prom for Netflix, and Steven Soderbergh’s Let Them All Talk for HBO Max.\n\nShe also served as producer on the documentary film Sell/Buy/Date. Ms. Streep has pursued her interest in the environment through her work with Mothers and Others, a consumer advocacy group that she co-founded in 1989 under the aegis of NRDC. M&O worked for ten years to promote sustainable agriculture, establish new pesticide regulations, and ensure the availability of organic and sustainably grown local foods. Over the years since then she has supported the work of many and varied non-profit organizations in the areas of the environment /climate change, human rights and social justice, including The Climate Emergency Fund, NRDC, Women for Women International, Equality Now, The Women's History Museum, the Committee to Protect Journalists, Donor Direct Action, Partners in Health, Kageno, and the Innocence Project.\n\nShe is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and has been accorded a Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et Lettres by the French Government. She has been awarded an Honorary César by the French Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma, and an Honorary Golden Bear by the Berlin International Film Festival. She has received the TIFF Tribute Acting Award from the Toronto International Film Festival, the Chaplin Award from the Film Society of Lincoln Center, The Donostia Award from The San Sebastian Film Festival, and a Career Tribute from the Gotham Awards, all for her extensive body of work. She received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute in 2008, and the 2010 National Medal of Arts from President Obama. In 2011, Ms. Streep received a Kennedy Center Honor, and in 2014 the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She holds honorary degrees from CCNY, Dartmouth, Harvard, Indiana University, Lafayette, Middlebury, Princeton, U of New Hampshire, Yale, and the Barnard Medal.\n\nShe and Don Gummer are the parents of a son and three daughters, and proud grandparents of five children under four years of age!\n\nRufus Wainwright - biography"
