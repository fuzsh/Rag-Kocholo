inspiration for Adolf Hitler and Francisco Franco, it is fair to say that at this point in time it was not clear what a significant part Benito Mussolini would play in the history of the world. At the beginning of 1922, no one could have predicted that by November of the same year, he would be granted dictatorial powers by the Italian parliament, even if this was supposed to be temporary.\n\nThe March on Rome was undoubtedly one of the most significant moments of the twentieth century. The gathering of approximately 30,000 blackshirts succeeded in forcing Prime Minister Luigi Facta to resign and inserting a fascist government.\n\nThe Creation of the USSR\n\nThe Cold War would come to define the latter half of the twentieth century, but this could not have been predicted when the USSR was formed during the final months of 1922.\n\nDespite suffering his third stroke in this year, Vladimir Lenin still managed to deliver his famous “political testament”, and his decision to appoint Joseph Stalin as General Secretary of the Russian Communist Party would become a key moment in the history of the world.\n\nBack to the top ↑"
