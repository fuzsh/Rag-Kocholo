        "text": "We are delighted to confirm that the 2024 EBU New Radio Day will be hosted by Radio France in Paris.\n\nNew Radio Day has established itself as an inspiring and highly productive meeting point for all those interested in innovation in radio and audio. The 2024 edition will look at recent projects exploring smart ways to use AI in radio production and audio content creation, explore what works and what doesn’t for our own listening apps, and consider the latest developments on the all-important topic of in-car radio.\n\nThanks to the unconference format, which we’re adopting for the third year running, you can put your most important topics on the agenda. Complemented by a set of inspiring keynote presentations on the opening afternoon, our unconference will allow you to dive into a full day of highly interactive and engaging discussions and brainstorms. Join us!\n\nTo take part in the pre-event brainstorming around potential topics for discussion have a look at our wiki page (Members only).\n\nThe event will start early afternoon on 16 October afternoon and will end at 6pm CEST on 17 October. As you know, it’s very important that all participants stay until the end of the day, for the closing circle. Therefore, please make sure you reserve a full day for the unconference on 17 October and take your flight tickets accordingly.\n\nFor those of you who would like to attend the Paris Motor Show, taking place from 14 to 20 October 2024, you might be interested to stay even longer in Paris. We are exploring the possibility to secure tickets for EBU members. We will get back to you with additional information in due time.\n\nYou can find hotel recommendations in the document section below. Practical information and preparation details for the event will be shared shortly."
