You can watch our games on RDS or TSN and you can listen to the games on the radio on 98.5FM or TSN 690.\n\nRDS is the exclusive French-language broadcast partner of the CFL, including all Montreal Alouettes games. The broadcast team composed of David Arsenault, Pierre Vercheval, Matthieu Proulx, Bruno Heppell, Didier Orméjuste and Danny Desriveaux will bring you all the action all season long.\n\nChristian Leduc : Producer\n\nMatthieu PROULX\n\nAnalyst\n\nA native of Gatineau, Matthieu Proulx played his university football from 2001 to 2004 at the University of Laval, where he won the Vanier Cup twice. In 2005, the Montreal Alouettes made Matthieu their first-round draft pick. The Alouettes safety won the Grey Cup with the team in 2009 and 2010. In 2011, at the age of 29, he hung his cleats. Since 2011, he has been a CFL and NFL analyst for RDS.\n\nPierre VERCHEVAL\n\nAnalyst\n\nPierre Vercheval was born in Belgium and grew up in Quebec City. He is the first Quebecker in history to have played in 200 regular season games in the Canadian Football League and the first Quebecker to have participated in a National Football League training camp (1988, with the New England Patriots). In 1987, he was drafted by the Edmonton Eskimos and was selected as a division All-Star seven times and a CFL All-Star six times. His four Grey Cup appearances, his two Grey Cup victories with the Toronto Argonauts, and his time as a premier lineman with the Alouettes led to him becoming the first francophone to be inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. In 2002, Pierre joined RDS as a CFL and NFL analyst. Pierre is also a member of the Quebec Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nDidier ORMÉJUSTE\n\nReporter\n\nMontreal native Didier Orméjuste was drafted by the Edmonton Eskimos (CFL) before joining RDS in 2003.

Named to the Eastern All-Star Team by his peers in 2001 and 2002, he was an important cog in the Alouettes’ Grey Cup victory in 2002. Officially retired from the CFL in 2005, he has been working in the media as a football analyst for nearly 10 years.\n\nDavid ARSENAULT\n\nPlay-by-play\n\nBorn in Montreal, David Arsenault grew up in Repentigny.

He has worked six Super Bowls and provided play-by-play for university football games over several seasons. After spending 15 years covering the Alouettes, he began working on the Hockey 360 television show, entirely devoted to hockey, from 2010 to 2013. Starting in the fall of 2013, David returned to covering Alouettes football and the NFL.\n\nDanny DESRIVEAUX\n\nAnalyst\n\nDanny Desriveaux is a former Canadian Football League player for the Montreal Alouettes and Toronto Argonauts.

During his career in the Canadian Football League, Marc-Olivier was heavily involved with the Players’ Association, having acted as a player representative for several years, in addition to serving on various committees. At the end of his playing career, he joined the RSS law firm and became a partner in the Insurance Law Group.\n\nThe Montreal Alouettes games can be heard in french on 98.5 fm in Montreal an on various COGECO network radio stations.\n\nJean ST-ONGE\n\nPlay-by-play\n\nIn addition to having an impressive resume as a broadcaster and covering professional and university football, Jean St-Onge also covered the daily activities of the Montreal Canadiens, the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, Euro 96 and Montreal Expos and Toronto Blue Jays baseball.
