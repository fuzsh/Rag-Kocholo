Known by pejorative names such as \"Chicken Band\", \"Children's Band\" and several others. Short-range license free (or simple license requirement) two-way radio service for personal or business purposes in the 25-30 MHz (25000-30000 kHz) range that makes up the shortest wavelength portions of the HF band. For local communications, it tends to behave more like a short-range VHF / UHF Radio service. De facto standard frequency allocation based on 40 channel American CB band 26.965-27.405 MHz. In radio hobbyist circles, the CB band and adjacent frequencies are often referred to as \"11 meters\".\n\nCB is one of the most commonly used two-way and land mobile radio services worldwide, although for handheld walkie-talkie purposes it has mostly been depreciated in favor of VHF/UHF services such as FRS/GMRS and MURS. CB is still heavily used by trucking companies, hunting clubs, farmers, Jeep and 4x4 off road clubs, militias and self-defense security groups (for mobile and base purposes), logging companies, tow truck operators, fishing fleets, doomsday preppers, for local and/or unlicensed paging or data link/telemetry systems, and low power to medium power R/C (radio control, remote control) purpose, etc. and as an inexpensive short-range alternative to licensed services such as the licensed Business Radio Services.\n\nMany ham radio operators look down on CB with absolute disdain, while others view it as a useful tool...or at the very least, a source of entertainment.\n\nCB (and the 11-meter freeband frequencies above and below CB) are making a resurgence as one of many communications methods used by so-called \"preppers\" and survivalists, in addition to amateur radio and VHF/UHF services such as FRS, GMRS, VHF marine, etc.\n\nA large radio subculture relating to illegally modifying CB equipment, using so-called \"export radios\" or \"10 meter radios\" or modifying amateur radio equipment to access \"freeband\" frequencies, transmit higher than legal power levels, and or make DX contacts, exists worldwide. A large market for \"export radios\" (often sold under the guise of being 10 meter amateur radios) exists. CB is an old service, with its roots dating back to the 1950s and its spiritual roots dating back to the Second World War.\n\nCB radio calling frequencies AM FM SSB digital modes 25-28 MHz 25-30 MHz allocations 27MHz calling frequencies DX channels guide to CB radio frequencies channels 11 meter band legal users allocations freeband frequencies here.\n\nCB is the oldest, and most commonly known in popular culture, two-way radio service. Many folks uneducated in the ways of radio simply refer to all radios, walkie-talkies, handheld radios, HTs, scanners, two-way radios, marine band radios, etc. as \"CBs\"\n\nSee here for 27 MHz CB radio channel plans, bands, etc. See here for 11 meter band 25-30 MHz band frequency allocations, legal users and illegal users.\n\nCB FAQs - Frequently Asked Questions About CB Radio\n\n-Do truckers still use CB radios? Yes, they most certainly do. CB is still extremely popular in the trucking industry, as well as the broader construction industry, logging, LTL truck deliveries and other transportation service oriented industries. Many truckers keep their radios turned down or off when highway conditions are good. These same drivers, however, turn their radios on when conditions deteriorate, for traffic reports, during weather emergencies or for other reasons. State agencies, including highway assistance agencies and DOT continue to outfit vehicles with CB radios to communicate with trucks, flag cars, chase cars and motorists. Motorist assistance or safety service patrol trucks are often outfitted with CBs tuned to channel 19 AM - 27.185 MHz - to listen to trucker CB radio chatter and improve situational awareness. Incident management vehicles are also equipped with CBs for the same reason.\n\n-Is it legal to use FM on CB radio? Yes, FM mode is legal to use on the CB radio service in the United States. FM mode is legal in most countries worldwide. AM mode is considered the “standard” mode for CB radio in the U.S.A.. This means that all CB radios must, at the very least, have AM mode capability. This ensures backward compatibility and allows all CB radios to talk to all other CB radios (using the standard AM mode). In the United States, AM, FM and SSB (USB and LSB) modes are all legal on the 11 meter 27 MHz CB radio channels. See Part 95 Subpart D FCC rules - 47 CFR § 95.971 CBRS emission types.\n\n-Are 23 channel CB radios illegal? No, they are not illegal. 23 channel CB radios are still legal to use in the United States.\n\n-Is CB HF? sometimes phrased as \"is CB a HF?\" or \"is CB an HF?\" - yes, CB falls within the definition of high frequency (HF) (3 to 30 MHz or 3000 to 30000 kHz). However, because CB uses the frequency band in the upper portion of the HF band (20-30 MHz), it sometimes behaves like HF and sometimes behaves more like VHF, depending on the propagation conditions.\n\n-Is CB 11 meters? Yes, the term 11 meters, the 11m band, the 11 meter band, 11-m band, the 27 MHz band are all used to refer to the range of frequencies that CB radio services operate in. 11 meters is generally understood to mean 26-28 MHz, but often the term is used to refer to the US CB allocation specifically (26.965 MHz to 27.405 MHz). Or, it may be used to refer to the frequency range between the 12 meter amateur radio band or ham radio band (24.89 MHz to 24.99 MHz) and the 10 meter amateur radio band or 10m ham radio band (28 MHz to 29.7 MHz) - so the space between 12 meters and 10 meters is 25-28 MHz. In fact, many radios that operate in the 10 meter band are also capable of operating in the 26-28 MHz band (11 meters, the freeband frequencies, the legal CB channels and some are capable of operating on 12m, 11m and 10m - the Ranger RCI-2950 and RCI-2970 series of radios are a good example of this, as are radios like the Superstar 158EDX (24.265 MHz to 29.665 MHz).\n\nRadios that cover the 11m band and the 10m band are considerably more common as Chinese radios such as the AnyTone Smart, AnyTone AT5555, AnyTone AT6666 and numerous others including the AnyTone Ares II (Radioditty QT50), Anysecu CB-40M AR-925 and many others. The de facto standard \"export radio\" frequency coverage bands include 25.615 MHz - 28.305 MHz, 25.615 MHz - 30.105 MHz, 25.165 MHz to 28.755 MHz and 26.065 MHz to 28.755 MHz. The 25.615 to 30.105 MHz coverage is becoming more common than the 6-band or \"240 channel\" 25.615-28.305 coverage.\n\n-What are the freeband CB radio frequencies? - See the freeband 10 meter CB radio channel frequency chart below, see also: the 11 meter frequencies page.\n\nOrigins and Historical Babble - Second World War\n\nThe origins of CB can be traced further back, to World War II. Both the US and Germany developed mobile two-way radios for use in tanks, trucks and other vehicles that used similar frequency ranges, power output levels, and the familiar 9 foot long 1/4 wave \"whip\" antenna associated with CB. These frequencies the 20.0 MHz - 27.9 MHz and 27.0 MHz - 38.9 MHz ranges (SCR-508 and SCR-608 tank and artillery radios) and the 27.2 MHz - 33.3 MHz range (Germany, standard 10W.S.c Panzer radio transmitter - see also 10W. S.c. H. - same radio with different frequency range - 23.0 MHz - 24.95 MHz with 50 kHz channel steps).\n\nThe complete 10 WSc German UKW \"ultra short wave\", another way of saying \"VHF\" was known as the Fu 5 or FuG 5. US Army documentation indicates a transmitter power output of 6.5 watts on normal mode and 10 watts maximum output on high power mode. Maximum power setting / high power was obtained by pressing red push-button switch marked \"Oberstrich\" (power increase). High power was only to be used when tuning the whip antenna or in emergencies. It is not known if transmitter power measurements are RMS readings, dead carrier power mode or PEP or peak mode.\n\nAn improved version, known as the 20 W.S.c was also available. It covered the same 27.2 MHz to 33.3 MHz range with 50 kHz steps but provided 20 watts transmit power compared to the 6.5 watt/10 watt transmit power of the 10 W.S.c. A variant known as the 20 W.S.d. covered 42.100 MHz to 47.800 MHz but was otherwise identical. The 42.1 - 47.8 MHz version of the transceiver was intended for close air support communications and was a counterpart to German aircraft radios that covered the same, or similar VHF 40 MHz VHF frequency range. Note, some sources indicate the coverage for these radios was 27.0 MHz - 33.3 MHz or 27.2 MHz - 33.4 MHz. The vast majority of German vehicles equipped with high-HF/low-VHF equipment used the 27.200 MHz to 33.300 MHz range and/or the 40 MHz range for tactical radio communications. The higher frequencies were also used for Close Air Support (CAS) as well as air-to-air communications and were subject to extensive jamming in the later stages of the war.\n\nThe American counterparts (SCR-508 family, i.e. SCR-510, SCR-608, SCR-610) provided wider frequency coverage, higher power output and use of FM which significantly reduced impulse noise interference found in vehicles and resulted in increased range. The SCR-508 tank radio was rated at 25 watts (communication range of 7 miles or 11 km) and the SCR-608 artillery radio was rated at 35 watts (communication range of 15 miles or 24 km). The American radios provided crystal control and channeling at 100 kHz steps (26.400 MHz, 26.500 MHz, 26.600 MHz, etc). The US military also produced lower-powered versions of FM radios that covered the same 20.0-27.9 MHz coverage, designed for mobile command (tank) purposes, general tactical radios in jeeps, trucks, for landing craft communications and as datalink radios for portable instrument landing systems. Other radios in the same family covered the higher 27 MHz - 38.9 MHz frequency range but were otherwise the same radio. These lower power radios (power output in the 5-15 watt range) provided CB-like communications capability and operated on the same frequency ranges as the tank radio sets and artillery radio sets.\n\nGerman AM equipment operated at 50 kHz channel steps (27.200 MHz, 27.250 MHz, 27.300 MHz, 27.350 MHz, 27.400 MHz, 27.450 MHz...up To 33.300 MHz. Radio displays indicated every every 100 kHz with a mark halfway between to show the 50 kHz channel in-between. Frequency readout was provided in a x100 kHz notation - so 27.500 MHz (27500 kHz) would appear as 275 on the display, 29.700 MHz would appear as 297 on the display, etc. \"Split\" channels in between were indicated by a line halfway between the 100 kHz steps, so 27.850 MHz would appear as a line halfway between channel 278 (27.800 MHz) and channel 279) (27.900 MHz).\n\nThe US Army also embraced the concept of using channel numbers in place of frequencies. For example, 27500 kHz (27.500 MHz) would be referred to as \"channel 275\". American military equipment provided for 10 crystals to be installed at once and selected \"on-the-fly\" to allow for frequency agility. Many radio installations included one transmitter and two receivers, to allow a tank commander to listen to two radio nets and transmit on one.\n\nAlthough the FM systems provided significant improvement over noise and interference, the development and widespread fielding of these systems (both AM and FM voice systems) during WWII proved successful. The success of these higher-frequency (above 20 MHz) radio systems for land mobile communications paved the way for the adoption of (what were then considered) higher frequencies for mobile radio.\n\nOrigins and Historical Babble - 1950s, 23 Channel CB Radio and Beyond\n\nThe CB service as we know it today started in the United States in the 1950s as a licensed service in the 26.965-27.255 MHz band (23 channels). When the service was created, the original 26.96 - 27.26 MHz band was taken from the 11 meter amateur radio band in 1947 Because of this, CB and its adjacent frequencies are often referred to as \"11 meters\". CB was expanded in 1977 to 40 channels. It is this 40 channel plan that became the \"standard\" CB plan that most countries have since adopted.\n\nOn September 11th, 1958, the old 11 meter amateur band was re-allocated by the FCC to the Citizen's Band Radio Service (CB Radio) as \"Class D\" CB service using FCC verbiage. The legislation called for 27 channels between 26.96 MHz and 27.26 MHz with 10 kHz channel spacing, including the five R/C channels spaced 50 kHz apart. The FCC moved the channel centers +5 kHz from the band edge and 26.965 MHz, CB channel 1, was born. Overlaying the 50 kHz R/C channel spacing provided the original 23 channels. Channel 23 was/is 27.255 MHz, while 27.235 and 27.245 remained allocated for business purposes, and while 27.255 MHz/CH 23 became the 5th R/C channel it retained its role in high power paging and continues to do so to this day. It is because of this historical quirk that the CB channels 23, 24 and 25 appear to be out of sequence. Before CB radio was expanded from 23 channels to 40 channels, the \"hidden\" channels 27.235 MHz and 27.245 MHz were often designated 22A and 22B. CB users often modified radios to access these two additional channels in the blank space between CB channel 22 and 23 (many 23 channel CB radios really did have a blank space between those two channels).\n\nThe original 23 channel service also specified which channels should be used for intra station communications (or communications between stations operating under the same license) and inter-station communications (or communications between stations operating under different licenses).\n\nOfficially, channels 1 through 8 and 15 through 22 were reserved for \"intrastation\" communications among units under the same license, while the other channels (9 through 14 and 23) could be used for \"interstation\" calls to other licenses.\n\nChannel 11 became the calling channel (see below) and remains so to this day. Another result of this requirement was the development of a \"town channel\" or \"home channel\". This still exists today. Rural areas will usually have one or two channels that the locals use as their home channel or \"hangout channel\". Originally, this practice served two purposes. It kept the calling channel clear and prevented non-locals from easily figuring out where all the CB activity was. This practice can be found throughout the United States and probably a world into the 21st century.\n\nCB Channel Frequency Old Designated Use (Mostly Defunct) Channel 1 26.965 MHz Stations operating under the same license - “intrastation” Channel 2 26.975 MHz Stations operating under the same license - “intrastation” Channel 3 26.985 MHz Stations operating under the same license - “intrastation” Channel 4 27.005 MHz Stations operating under the same license - “intrastation” Channel 5 27.015 MHz Stations operating under the same license - “intrastation” Channel 6 27.025 MHz Stations operating under the same license - “intrastation” Channel 7 27.035 MHz Stations operating under the same license - “intrastation” Channel 8 27.055 MHz Stations operating under the same license - “intrastation” Channel 9 27.065 MHz Emergency channel Channel 10 27.075 MHz Original road/truck channel, moved to ch. 19 when CB was still 23 channels and required a license Channel 11 27.085 MHz Calling channel Channel 12 27.105 MHz Channel 13 27.115 MHz Channel 14 27.125 MHz Channel 15 27.135 MHz Stations operating under the same license - “intrastation” Channel 16 27.155 MHz Stations operating under the same license - “intrastation” Channel 17 27.165 MHz Stations operating under the same license - “intrastation” Channel 18 27.175 MHz Stations operating under the same license - “intrastation” Channel 19 27.185 MHz Trucker channel or road channel Channel 20 27.205 MHz Stations operating under the same license - “intrastation” Channel 21 27.215 MHz Stations operating under the same license - “intrastation” Channel 22 27.225 MHz Stations operating under the same license - “intrastation” Channel 23 27.255 MHz Stations operating under different licenses - “interstation” - shared with pagers/high power data\n\nChannel 11 was designated the official AM calling channel, channel 16 the official SSB calling channel (LSB mode), channel 9 was designated the emergency channel and channel 10 was designated the road/trucking/highway information and motorist assistance channel. The highway channel was quickly changed from 10 to 19.\n\nWhen the service was expanded to 40 channels in 1977, 27.235 MHz was added as channel 24 and 27.245 MHz was added as 25. By sheer coincidence (or maybe not), channel 27.265 MHz was added as channel 26 all the way up to 27.405 MHz being channel 40. Thus, from channels 26-40, the first two digits after the decimal in MHz frequency notation are the same as the channel number.\n\nCB is a HF (generally 26-28 MHz) short-range radio service designed for personal or business use by the general public. Although CB occupies the upper portion of HF, it is intended as a short-range service. 27 MHz generally provides VHF low band-like local propagation characteristics during periods of low sunspot numbers and a lack of sporadic-E propagation. During band openings, however, skip propagation is quite common on CB frequencies, and DXing at modest power levels can be realized.\n\nCB Frequencies, freebanding and freeband \"channeling\"\n\nCB is generally license free worldwide, although frequency allocations, modes and power limits vary from country to country. However, these limits are often ignored and enforcement is extremely lax. Use of \"10-meter\" or \"export\" radios is common. These radios offer the user the option of 40 channels plus a band switch, the band switch going up or down 450 kHz (0.450 MHz, or 45 channels). Common export radio frequency coverage includes 25.615-28.305 MHz (standard 6-band export plan), 25.165 MHz - 28.755 MHz (Galaxy DX radios 8-band plan), 25.615 MHz - 30.105 MHz (\"RU\" or \"export\" plan, often included in European radios and Chinese 10 meter rigs such as the Anytone AT-5555 and its various clones), and 24.265 MHz - 29.655 MHz (12 meter/10 meter coverage radios such as the Superstar SS-158EDX and its various clones). Others include 24.715 MHz - 30.105 MHz (new Chinese export CB radio coverage for 12 meter band, 10 meter band and 11 meter band full coverage, also appearing on modern [2019-2020]President export radios as the export/12m-10m coverage option), 25.165 MHz - 30.105 MHz, 25.615 MHz - 30.555 MHz, 26.000 MHz - 32.000 MHz (RCI-2950 and RCI-2970 series radios) and the \"three band\" or \"uppers and lowers\" coverage of 26.515 MHz - 27.855 MHz (see discussion regarding \"hunting radios\" above). Most exports at least have access to the high band of 27.415 MHz to 27.855 MHz and the low band of 26.515 MHz to 26.955 MHz, so the majority of out-of-band communications take place between roughly 26.5 MHz and 27.9 MHz. In Latin America, the lower frequencies in the 25 MHz and 26 MHz bands are popular for taxi cab companies, trucking companies, delivery services etc. During serious band openings you can often hear signals every 10 kHz from 25.615 MHz all the way up to 26.965 MHz (CB channel 1).\n\nMany countries follow the US 40-channel plan, with most of Europe allowing for use of FM on these frequencies in addition to AM. SSB is legal in some parts of the world, in others only AM/FM or even just FM are allowed. The US CB frequency plan has been standardized Europe-wise as the \"CEPT\" band (or \"mid band\") in FM mode. Some countries (Germany, Czech Republic, Russia, the UK, New Zealand, etc) have additional channels authorized in addition to the standard 26.965-27.405 MHz US FCC/CEPT \"mid band\" allocation. Other countries (for example, South Africa, Japan) have entirely different allocations and/or use only a portion of the US FCC/CEPT mid band channel plan. See charts below for CB channel plans.\n\nFreebanding - What is free band CB radio?\n\nFreebanding generally means operating on frequencies above or below the legal CB band in your country. What may be a legal CB frequency in one country may not be legal in another. For example, a trucker operating on CB channel 19 wishes to find a clear frequency to talk to another driver without all the interference found on 27.185 MHz. So he (and the person he's talking to) switch their radios \"down one band\" (-450 kHz or -0.450 MHz) from 27.185 MHz to 26.735 MHz. The radio's channel display still says \"19\" but the bandswitch has been moved down one. Often export radios will have 3, 6, 8 or even 12 bands. Freebanding does have some general \"gentlemen's agreements\" in place. For example, AM operators usually stick to the lower frequencies below CB channel 1 (26.965 MHz), with activity centered around 26.915 MHz (channel 36 down one band), 26.885 MHz, (channel 33 down one band) and other frequencies relatively close to the legal CB band. There are practical reasons for this, the primary one being antenna performance decreases the further away one gets in frequency from the antenna's resonant frequency.\n\nSSB operators usually operate above CB channel 40 (27.405 MHz) and often use 5 kHz steps instead of the standard 10 kHz steps. This means that in addition to 27.425 MHz, 27.435 MHz, 27.445 MHz, 27.455 MHz, etc, the \"0 raster\" frequencies are used as well (i.e. 27.420 MHz, 27.430 MHz, 27.450 MHz, 27.460 MHz, 27.490 MHz, etc). English-speaking stations will often stick with LSB mode, due to the gentlemen's agreement of using LSB for CB communications (see also: 27.385 LSB or channel 38 LSB) but there are several exceptions - the primary one being 27.555 MHz USB - the freeband calling frequency. In Europe, SSB activity is also found on the 26 MHz frequencies between 26.2 and 26.5 MHz (calling frequency 26.285 MHz USB), often as a method of escaping the heavy activity on the upper frequencies and FM signals on the three \"main\" European CB bands (see CB bands in the sections below).\n\nIn the Americas, 26.225 MHz USB, 26.235 MHz USB and 26.555 MHz LSB are commonly used by Spanish-speaking stations for SSB calling. 27.455 MHz USB is also used (think of it as the Latin American version of 27.555 USB). There are dozens of other frequencies, both above and below the CB band, which are used and/or claimed by various groups, users, radio clubs, etc.\n\nWith some common sense, freebanding allows the extremely large number of users of the 11 meter band to find clear frequencies for long distance communication with minimal interference issues. It is against the law (technically) but enforcement is basically nonexistent. See the list of frequencies and bands commonly associated with freebanding CB or the 11 meter band below.\n\nFreeband 11 Meter Frequencies and Bands\n\nFurther information may be found on the pages for freeband CB 11 meter frequencies, including specific 11m freeband calling frequencies and 11 meter beacon frequencies and freeband 11 meter bands 24-30 MHz.\n\nBy its very nature, the 11 meter band, the freeband, 11 meter free band, outbanding, operating out of band, the 11 meter band, 11 meters, whatever you want to call it, is dynamic. Therefore, no list, including this one, can ever be complete. Many of the frequencies listed below are the result of \"gentleman's agreements\" and there are plenty of exceptions. One of the things that attracts radio operators to working DX on 11 meters / the CB bands is the more laid back atmosphere of 11 meters compared to amateur radio.\n\nMost freeband operators use AM mode below CB channel 1 - the lower bands and SSB above CB channel 40 - the higher bands. There are several exceptions to this \"gentleman's rule\" however.\n\nWhile some export radios - sold as 10 meter radios - often cover frequencies above and below the 25.615-28.305 MHz range, that is the de facto \"standard\" export band alphanumeric plan. Generally the CB band is band \"D\" or the \"mid band\". On 120-channel radios, coverage is generally limited to 26.515-27.855 MHz or 26.065-27.405 MHz, depending on the model. Modern Chinese export radios cover 25.615-30.105 MHz to include all of the 10 meter band and frequencies above it.\n\n25.615-26.055 MHz - Band A - often used by taxi cabs and trucking companies (AM mode in the Americas, AM or FM elsewhere)\n\n25.835 MHz AM - CB channel 19 \"down three bands\" - truckers are often heard here\n\n26.065-26.505 MHz - Band B - often used by taxi cabs, trucking companies and hunting clubs\n\n26.225 MHz USB - Latin American SSB activity\n\n26.285 MHz USB - 26 MHz international calling frequency (commonly used in Europe)\n\n26.285 MHz AM - CB channel 19 \"down two bands\" - truckers are often heard here\n\n26.305 MHz AM - truckers, often heard in North America during band openings\n\n26.385 MHz AM - truckers, taxis, etc.\n\n26.405 MHz AM - another commonly active frequency\n\n26.500 MHz LSB - Caribbean activity noted (also in USB mode - see 27.515 MHz LSB, 27.500 MHz USB and 27.500 MHz LSB)\n\n26.515-26.955 MHz - Band C - \"low band\" or \"lowers\" all sorts of users, AM in the Americas, AM, FM and SSB elsewhere\n\n26.515 MHz AM - active in southern USA\n\n26.555 MHz LSB - very active in Mexico and Central/South America (and Caribbean)\n\n26.565 MHz FM - Begin German 80 channel CB band to 27.405 MHz (FM only up to 26.955 MHz)\n\n26.585 MHz AM - Mexican trucker channel, often very busy\n\n26.605 MHz AM - alternate to 26.585 MHz (see also, 26.575 MHz, 26.595 MHz)\n\n26.705 MHz AM - Puerto Rico, Florida and other Caribbean AM stations, often extremely powerful\n\n26.715 MHz AM - alternate to 26.705 MHz\n\n26.725 MHz AM - alternate to 26.705 MHz and 26.715 MHz\n\n26.735 MHz AM - CB channel 19 \"down one band\" - truckers are often heard here (see also 27.635 MHz)\n\n26.755 MHz AM - Often active in southern USA + every 10 kHz to 26.955 MHz|\n\n26.805 MHz FM - 26 MHz FM calling frequency - 11 meter freeband FM calling channel 26.805 FM\n\n26.885 MHz AM - alternate to 26.915 MHz, others\n\n26.905 MHz AM - alternate to 26.915 MHz, others\n\n26.915 MHz AM - Big radios USA \"915\" channel 36 down one band, AM DX channel\n\n26.965-27.405 MHz - Band D - legal CB band - \"mid band\", \"FCC band\" or \"CEPT\" band\n\n27.415-27.855 MHz - Band E - \"high band\" or \"uppers\", mixture of SSB, AM and FM (FM rarely used in North or South America)\n\n27.410 MHz LSB - Often used for SSB in the USA, can suffer from interference or QRM from AM stations on 27.405 MHz (CB channel 40)\n\n27.415 MHz LSB - US calling/working frequencies (channels +5 kHz, 27.420 MHz, 27.425 MHz, 27.430 MHz, and so on, usually in LSB mode)\n\n27.455 MHz USB - Latin American calling frequency (see also 26.555 MHz LSB) - Spanish language\n\n27.505 MHz LSB - \"Channel 50\" - US freebanders\n\n27.515 MHz LSB - Jamaica and Caribbean calling/DX frequency \"The Knight Patrol\"\n\n27.555 MHz USB - international 11 meter DX calling frequency\n\n27.60125 MHz FM - begin UK FM 27/81 CB allocation, 10 kHz steps to 27.99125 MHz\n\n27.635 MHz USB - digital modes found here in Europe (ROS, PSK31), see also 27.235 MHz and 27.245 MHz\n\n27.635 MHz AM - CB channel 19 \"up one band\" - truckers are often heard here (see also 26.735 MHz, 28.085 MHz, 25.835 MHz, 26.285 MHz, etc)\n\n27.665 MHz USB - Spanish language common frequencies + 5 kHz USB/LSB to 27.705 MHz or higher\n\n27.700 MHz USB - international 11 meter SSTV frequency\n\n27.735 MHz USB - international 11 meter SSTV frequency (alternate, also digital SSTV)\n\n27.775 MHz AM - sometimes AM signals are heard on this frequency and higher during band openings, often taxi dispatchers, etc\n\n27.855 MHz AM - High band channel 40 - popular with trucking companies and taxi cabs\n\n27.855-28.305 MHz - Band F - up to 27.995 MHz (channel 11A) popular with taxicabs and truckers, although truckers are often heard above 28.000 MHz it is strongly advised that freebanders stay below 28 MHz\n\nLegal Users of 25-30 MHz Spectrum\n\nAside from legal CB allocations and freebanding (or outbanding), there are several legal licensed services allocated to this interesting chunk of spectrum. This includes paging services, government, military, HF marine and FM land mobile. The following allocations are for the United States only - there will be significant differences in other regions and other countries.\n\nPlease see the 25-30 MHz users page here on the 11 meter page. Federal government and military NTIA allocations for the 25-30 MHz band on the 11m page.\n\nCB Channel Plans\n\nThe so-called \"A channels\" are also heavily used, especially when a band opening makes finding a clear frequency difficult. The A channels are assigned to R/C and telemetry purposes in most countries (the USA included). These six frequencies fall under a different section of Part 95 of the FCC rules. 27.255 MHz (CB Channel 23) is also one of the R/C channels, but it is shared with CB.\n\nUS \"FCC\" \"CEPT\" or \"mid band\" CB Frequencies\n\nYes, truckers (and lots of other people) still use CB radio. These are the de facto standard CB channel frequencies. Depending on where you're located they're the American CB radio channels, 27 MHz CB channels, the mid band channels, the CEPT channels or the European/EU channels.\n\nCB Channel Frequency Remarks Channel 1 26.965 MHz Channel 2 26.975 MHz Channel 3 26.985 MHz AmRRON CH3 Project Prepper and militia frequency (also FRS/MURS channel 3 - every 15 minutes for 3 minutes the 3-3-3 communication rule) Channel 4 27.005 MHz 4x4 and off-roader common channel, Latin American trucker channel, secondary militia frequency Channel 5 27.015 MHz Channel 6 27.025 MHz \"The Superbowl\" - High powered stations often use this as their home channel or calling channel Channel 7 27.035 MHz Channel 8 27.055 MHz Australian “recommended” road / trucker channel Channel 9 27.065 MHz Originally the CB emergency channel, now used as a calling channel in Latin America (you'll have better luck on channel 19 in an emergency) Channel 10 27.075 MHz Channel 11 27.085 MHz Calling channel - AM mode Channel 12 27.105 MHz Channel 13 27.115 MHz Channel 14 27.125 MHz Crystal controlled handheld CBs often included channel 14 as their only channel Channel 15 27.135 MHz Channel 16 27.155 MHz 4x4 and off-roader common channel (4x4 = 16) in AM mode, also SSB calling Channel 16 LSB Channel 17 27.165 MHz Trucker/road channel (only in some areas - secondary to channel 19 or 27.185 MHz) Channel 18 27.175 MHz Channel 19 27.185 MHz Trucker channel or road channel, center frequency of the 26.965-27.405 MHz CB band Channel 20 27.205 MHz Channel 21 27.215 MHz Channel 22 27.225 MHz Channel 23 27.255 MHz Shared with high power data link, R/C systems and CB radio 11m beacons Channel 24 27.235 MHz Channel 25 27.245 MHz Channel 26 27.265 MHz Calling channel - supplementary to channel 11 Channel 27 27.275 MHz USA FM CB Calling Channel - USA FM CB Working Channel FM CB DX Channel Channel 28 27.285 MHz Calling channel - supplementary to channel 11 Channel 29 27.295 MHz Trucker FM CB Channel in USA - the \"Trucker's FM Channel\" or Channel 29 FM 27.295 FM Channel 30 27.305 MHz Channel 31 27.315 MHz Calling channel (FM mode) in Europe, USA FM CB calling channel (see also: 27.275 MHz and 27.295 MHz / FM CB Channel 27 and 29) Channel 32 27.325 MHz Channel 33 27.335 MHz Channel 34 27.345 MHz Channel 35 27.355 MHz Australian SSB calling frequency, 27.355 LSB, also see 27.385 LSB Channel 36 27.365 MHz Militia Survivalist Patriot 11m CB SSB USB mode - CB CH 36 USB Channel 37 27.375 MHz Secondary or backup SSB calling/working channel LSB mode (secondary to 27.385 MHz LSB), militia/patriot 27.375 USB Channel 38 27.385 MHz SSB calling channel, LSB mode (27.385 LSB) Channel 39 27.395 MHz Secondary or backup SSB calling/working channel LSB mode (secondary to 27.385 MHz LSB) Channel 40 27.405 MHz\n\nAM, FM and SSB Modulation in the United States. US FCC CB Radio Service (CBRS) regulations require all CB radios to have AM mode capability as the standard mode. In other words, all CB radios operate in AM mode by default. This ensures backward compatibility between all 27 MHz CB radios. Identical rules and regulations in Canada, where it is officially called the General Radio Service (specialized trucking companies in some parts of Canada also use the VHF Resource Road frequencies (LADD channels) in addition to standard 27 MHz CB radio equipment).\n\nSSB and/or FM are optional in the United States. If the radio is equipped with SSB capability, it must at least be able to use the upper side band. SSB CB equipment is capable of LSB and USB. FCC rules allow 4 watt AM carrier power, 4 watt FM power and 12 watt PEP SSB power.\n\nBandwidth limits are 8 kHz for AM mode (8K00A3E), 8 kHz for FM (8K00F3E), and 4 kHz for SSB. SSB with carrier (4K00H3E), SSB with reduced carrier (4K00R3E), and true SSB without carrier (4K00J3E) are allowed. Use of selective calling systems, including tone-based selective calling such as DTMF, ANI, etc. as well as CTCSS tone squelch (PL) and DCS coded squelch (DPL) are permitted.\n\nIn many European countries, FM is the standard mode and is available throughout Europe. In the Americas, Australia and a few other places, AM mode is the standard mode.\n\nCEPT European CE EU standardization permits 4 watt carrier power on AM, 4 watt power on FM and 12 watt power (PEP) on SSB. Maximum deviation in FM mode as defined in ETSI EN 300 433 as a maximum deviation from carrier frequency of 2 kHz. This translates to 8 kHz bandwidth or 8K00F3E emission. Transmitter power in AM and SSB modes is specifically measured with no modulation present.\n\n(ECC/DEC/(11)03) Amended 17 June 2016 - on the harmonised use of frequencies for Citizens’ Band (CB) radio equipment\n\nUK CB \"27/81\" Frequencies\n\nFM (Frequency Modulation) only.

Many vessels are equipped with dedicated HF-SSB equipment, a stand-alone 27MHz marine radio, and VHF marine equipment, with the 27 MHz gear being used for backup or supplementary purposes. It is due to favorable propagation characteristics over open water that low power 26-30 MHz marine systems remain popular.

Mid band (FCC, US, CEPT) CB band -635 kHz or -0.635 MHz. This was done to make it easier for CB radio manufacturers to convert 27 MHz CB radios to the 26 MHz NZ CB band by simply changing the PLL reference crystal and making minor adjustments to the receiver and transmitter components if required. Many modern multi-country CB radios cover 25.615 MHz to 30.105 MHz and include the 26.330 MHz to 26.770 MHz NZ CB band as one of the many available bands.\n\nNZ 26 MHz CB skips the 5 \"A\" channels, in this case they are 26.36 MHz, 26.41 MHz, 26.46 MHz, 26.51 MHz and 26.56 MHz.\n\nNew Zealand is close enough to Asia that interference from fishing fleet radio chatter, fishnet buoys, radio buoys, etc. can be a significant problem. 26330 kHz - 26770 kHz, 26965 kHz - 27405 kHz.\n\nNew Zealand previously had a 14 channel allocation in the same 26MHz band 26.425 MHz to 26.75 MHz, using 25 kHz spacing.

The original Polish CB allocation was the same as the EU standard/American CB band plan - 5 kHz. For example, Channel 19 is 27.180 MHz instead of 27.185 MHz. Channel 20 is 27.200 MHz instead of 27.205 MHz. The channel plan is otherwise exactly the same. FM was originally only allowed, with AM and FM now allowed. These frequencies are still heavily used in Eastern Europe, Russia and Ukraine (see information below on the Russian band plans). There are indications that the -5 kHz channels are even used for the “hidden” A channels - 26.990 MHz for 26.995 MHz, 27.040 MHz for 27.045 MHz, 27.090 MHz for 27.095 MHz, 27.140 MHz for 27.145 MHz and 27.190 MHz for 27.195 MHz.\n\nThese channels are often referred to as the \"zeros\" by European CBers. Poland now uses both the regular EU or CEPT \"mid band 40\" FCC American CB plan and the band plan below.

In most multi-norm radios, this is the \"export mode\" or \"RU\" mode. Some radios allow for more channels, starting at 25.615 MHz/25.610 MHz or 26.065 MHz/26.060 MHz Unlike most countries, Russia has 5 kHz channel steps. Frequency coverage is 26.510 MHz to 27.860 MHz (26.515 MHz to 27.855 MHz or 27.865 MHz) Like most other countries, 24-30 MHz is filled with CB and CB-like traffic. Russian taxi cab dispatchers are heard all over Europe in 12 meters through 10 meters during band openings. Even with 240 legally available channels, Russian CB activity is often heard in the lower 26 MHz band, the 25 MHz band and within the 10 meter amateur band.\n\nAM and FM modulation. SSB used on some frequencies but not allowed. Channels are referred using an alphanumeric designation that provides the band, channel number, and \"raster\" (last digit of frequency, 5 or 0) plus the mode. Most radios used in Russia use the band letter + channel number format to display channels, and/or include a frequency display due to the complexity of the system. The \"E\" channels are more commonly used in Russia compared to the older-generation \"R\" channels (original Russian/Polish/Eastern European CB channel plan).\n\nCommon band designations:\n\nB band: 26.515-26.955 MHz (E raster) 26.510-26.950 MHz (R raster) 40 channels 5 kHz offset + 40 channels 0 kHz offset (C band in the West, low channels)\n\nC band: 26.965-27.405 MHz (E raster) 26.960-27.400 MHz (R raster) 40 channels 5 kHz offset + 40 channels 0 kHz offset (D band in the West - CB band, mid band or EURO CEPT band)\n\nD band: 27.415-27.855 MHz (E raster) 27.410-27.850 MHz (R raster) 40 channels 5 kHz offset + 40 channels 0 kHz offset (E band in the West, high channels)\n\n+ channel number + mode (AM or FM, often written as \"A\" or \"F\")\n\nFor example,\n\n26.670 MHz FM is designated B14R or B14RF/B14R FM (band B, channel 14, R raster/channeling or the \"zeros\", FM mode)\n\n27.185 MHz AM is designated C19E or C19EA/B19E AM (band C, channel 19, E raster/channeling or the \"fives\", AM mode)\n\nMany CB radios used in Russia include a frequency display as the use of multiple channel raster plans can be confusing. Since FM is by far the more commonly used mode for local communications, the mode portion of the alphanumeric channel name is often omitted.\n\nModern CB radios sold in Europe and Asia often include \"RU\" mode as a country setting. More often than not, this opens up the radio to 25.615 MHz to 30.105 MHz in 5/10 kHz steps AM/FM mode. Russia suffers from heavy interference on the 10 meter amateur radio band due to the high number of radios operating above and below the legal CB frequencies and nil enforcement on the behalf of Russian authorities. Therefore, the \"Russia CB band\" can be difficult to pin down as far as the actual frequencies, some sources now simply state \"25 to 30 MHz\"\n\nNote: Compared to the table below, most export radios sold in the Americas and Western Europe have the CB band as Band D, not Band C. Therefore Channels B01-B40 would be C01-C40, channels C01-C40 would be channels D01-D40 and so on and so forth.\n\nAs of the late 2010s/early 2020s, Russia appears to be moving towards standardization with Western Europe with the alphanumeric channels. CB radios designed for the Russian market now include a \"15D\" button and a -5 kHz button. The Channel 15D button either switches to 27.135 MHz or 27.585 MHz (\"standard\" Russian band shown as 26.960 MHz - 27.860 MHz, which fits with the -5 kHz switch + 10 kHz switch capability, turning the CB band into a de facto 5 kHz steps land mobile band). See Optim Satellite CB radio, Nanfone CB-689, Thunderpole T-3000, etc.\n\nLike many other countries, CB radio in Russia shares the 11 meter band for telemetry. paging systems (using POCSAG, etc.), datalinks and other non-voice purposes. Frequencies like 26.945 MHz, 26.950 MHz, 26.955 MHz and 26.960 MHz will often have data bursts on them, especially in larger cities - this is similar to the FCC Part 95 RCRS services in the United States and elsewhere on 27.255 MHz, etc.\n\nRussian CB radio channel usage:\n\n27.060 MHz FM - Secondary rescue / emergency channel (unrestricted use) 27.060 FM - C9RF (D9RF)\n\n27.065 MHz FM - Official rescue service calling channel 27.065 FM - C9EF (D9EF) -\n\n27.135 MHz AM - Road channel / car calling channel (slowly being replaced by 27.135 MHz FM) - C15EA (D15EA)\n\n27.135 MHz FM - Road channel and trucker channel - C15EF (D15EF)\n\n27.185 MHz AM - Information channel and trucker road channel AM mode C19EA (D19EA)\n\n27.185 MHz FM - Information channel and trucker road channel FM mode C19EF (D19EF)\n\n27.190 MHz FM - Long range calling DX channel (also used in SSB mode)\n\n27.200 MHz FM - Long range calling DX channel - C20RF (D20RF)\n\n27.270 MHz AM - Radio hobbyist channel AM mode - C27RA (D27RA)\n\n27.315 MHz FM - FM calling channel European grid - C31EF (D31EF)\n\n27.635 MHz FM - Information and traffic channel (some areas only) D19EF (E19EF) - previously used for traffic information broadcasts in St. Petersburg only (service discontinued in 2014)\n\nRecommended Calling Channels - Main Channels:\n\n27.065 MHz FM - C9EF - Emergency channel\n\n27.135 MHz AM - C15EA - Truck drivers, highway channel, considered the Russian version of CB Channel 19\n\n27.185 MHz AM - C19EA - Information channel, secondary to 27.135 MHz - note: AM and FM are both used\n\n27.185 MHz FM - C19EF - Information channel\n\n27.190 MHz USB - \"Hidden\" channel, used for SSB DXing (among others, see also; 27.140 MHz, etc.)\n\n27.200 MHz FM - C20RF / 20R / 20P - FM calling channel for Russian speaking stations (echo repeaters on this frequency as well)\n\n27.270 MHz AM - C27RA / 20R / 20P - AM calling channel, QRP (low power) channel\n\nBelarus CB Radio\n\n26.960 MHz to 27.860 MHz or 26.965 MHz to 27.855 MHz (some sources say 27.865 MHz).

Each country is usually referred to by a 2-character \"norm\" In addition, two Europe-wide standard bands (one with 4w FM only, the other 4w AM/FM) are available, often referred to as \"CEPT\" \"EU\" or \"EC\", \"Euro\" bands.\n\nCE - Europe Harmonized FM - 26.965 MHz - 27.405 MHz - 40 channels - FM - 4W - European standard band, CE or \"CEPT\"\n\nEU - Europe Harmonized AM/FM or AM/FM/SSB - 26.965 MHz - 27.405 MHz - 40 channels - AM/FM/SSB 4W AM carrier + 4W FM + -12W SSB PEP European standard AM/FM/SSB band\n\nF - France - 26.965 MHz - 27.405 MHz - 40 channels - AM/FM - 1W AM carrier + 4W FM\n\nUK - UK \"27/81\" CB Band - 27.60125 MHz - 27.99125 MHz - 40 channels - FM - 4W - UK FM CB 27/81 allocation - UK has 80 available channels - UK + EU\n\nUE - UK Full 80 Channels - EU 40 channels + UK FM 40 channels (80 channels), some radios require the user to switch between the two bands\n\ndE or DE - Germany - 26.565 MHz - 27.405 MHz - 80 channels, channels 1-40 are AM/FM 4W/4W, same as CE band, channels 41-80 are FM only (4W) 26.565-26.955\n\nI - Italy - 26.965 MHz - 27.405 MHz - 40 channels - AM/FM - 4W AM carrier + 4W FM - same European standard AM/FM band\n\nI2 - Italy 2 - 26.875 MHz - 27.405 MHz - 34 channels - AM/FM 4W/4W or 40 regular EU channels\n\nPL - Poland - 26.960 MHz - 27.400 MHz - 40 channels - AM/FM 4W/4W (regular 40 channels -5 kHz)\n\nIN - India - 26.965 MHz - 27.275 MHz - 27 channels - AM/FM 4W/4W\n\nExport Radio / \"10 Meter Radio\" CB Channel Frequency Plan 11 Meter Freeband Channels\n\nStandard 6 band export radio plan. All plans follow the CB plan with 40 channels + 5 A channels (+10 kHz switch) or alpha channels. To go up or down a band add or subtract 450 kHz (0.450 MHz). For example, to go from channel 19 on the CB band (or D band, or mid band) \"down one band\" to the C band or low band, do 27.185 MHz (CB channel 19) - .450 MHz to get 26.735 MHz. This is why having a frequency display or frequency counter can be very helpful. At very least, a printed out \"roadmap\" or channel plan (available on various sites in PDF format) will help.\n\n6 band export radio frequency plan A-B-C-D-E-F 25.615 MHz to 28.305 MHz. This six-band plan is the de facto standard plan and is used by the Superstar 3900 family of radios as well as numerous clones produced by Ranger and other companies (Connex 3300, General Lee, Super Jopix 2000, Mirage MX-36 and dozens of others). Note that some radios may use the low/mid/high band designation for C/D/E and bands (low band being band C - 26.515 MHz to 26.955 MHz, mid being the CB band/D band 26.965 MHz to 27.405 MHz and high being band E - 27.415 MHz to 27.855 MHz). Several radios including the Connex Deer Hunter specifically cover the lower frequencies for hunters, and the bandswitch shows either A-B-C-D or B-C-D to reflect the 25.615 MHz to 27.405 MHz coverage or 26.065 MHz to 27.405 MHz coverage, respectively.\n\nThe related Superstar 120, Superstar 121, President Grant DX, Superstar GR, etc. style radios (120 channel radios, radios with a LOW/MID/HIGH band selector, this includes radios like the Galaxy DX 86V with the C-D-E band switch), plus CB rigs with 120 channel modifications, frequency expansion mods or \"channel kits\" (including the popular Cobra 29 family of radios, Galaxy DX 919, Galaxy DX 929, Galaxy DX 939, Galaxy DX 949, Galaxy DX 959 / DX 959B, Galaxy DX 979, Texas Ranger rigs, etc.) use the same form factor with either LOW-MID-HIGH band switch or C-D-E covering 26.515 MHz to 27.855 MHz. Radios such as the Galaxy DX 86V use the C-D-E band labeling plan to match 6-band export 10 meter radio band names.\n\nModified CB radios with additional channels may or may not follow the alphanumeric band + channel designation system, depending on the particular modification and radio in question. Many modern modification kits or extra channel expansion kits aim to track the same channel plan to provide for interoperability between modified 40 channel CB radios and 10 meter radios that have been converted to the 11 meter band. Not all legal 40 channel CB radios are capable of operating outside of the legal band but many are, and a thriving market for channel expansion kits and modifications continues to exist for those who wish to use \"traditional\" type CB radios and still have access to additional channels/frequencies. Because of this, and antenna considerations, the most active 11 meter frequencies tend to be the low channels (26.515 MHz to 26.955 MHz) and the high channels (27.415 MHz to 27.855 MHz) - with the frequencies closest to the legal 40 CB channels generally being more popular (again due to antenna tuning considerations). Some radios follow an older 26.525 MHz to 27.845 MHz coverage plan vs. 26.515 MHz to 27.855 MHz.\n\nMost out of band CB activity occurs within the limits of these 6 bands, that is, 25.615 MHz to 28.305 MHz. Operating above 28 MHz is strongly discouraged, but does occur.\n\nFor radios with wider frequency coverage, the lowest band will generally be Band A. On the 8 band Galaxy radios, coverage is 25.165 MHz to 28.755 MHz (A-B-C-D band selector plus a high band and low band switch). 12 band radios use the A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L naming convention, or A-B-C-D-E-F band selector plus a high band and a low band selector. These radios generally cover 24.265 MHz to 29.655 MHz. The newer generation Chinese radios cover 25.615 MHz to 30.105 MHz out of the box (10 bands) or 24.715 MHz to 30.105 MHz out of the box (12 bands). Other radios do away with the band switch and simply allow VFO frequency selection from 26-32 MHz or within the 25.610 - 30.110 MHz or 25.615 - 30.105 MHz coverage band. Modern equipment and older style Ranger/RCI type radios include a +10 kHz switch. Modern equipment may also include a +5 kHz or -5 kHz switch to access the in between channels (for example, to switch between 27.185 MHz and 27.180 MHz for channel 19).\n\nNote: operating on frequencies between 28.0 MHz and 29.7 MHz is a really bad idea. Yes, there is that chunk of spectrum from 29.705 MHz to 30.105 MHz available in many radios. However use of frequencies 30.005 MHz, 30.015 MHz, 30.025 MHz, 30.035 MHz, 30.045 MHz, 30.055 MHz, 30.065 MHz, 30.075 MHz, 30.085 MHz, 30.095 MHz, 30.105 MHz and 30.115 MHz is also strongly discouraged. The 29.710 MHz to 29.790 MHz portion is still used by business radio systems as of 2021. The 29.800 MHz to 30.550 MHz spectrum is allocated to military and government users and the military actually does use the 30.000 MHz to 30.550 MHz portion.\n\n99% of radios will be operating on the Standard Band Plan (the \"fives\"). Remember that the +10 kHz switch moves you up +10 kHz, regardless. So radios advertised as \"25.615 MHz to 28.305 MHz\" can actually go to 28.315 MHz (usually), 25.615 MHz to 30.105 MHz means 30.115 MHz (usually).\n\nBand A Channel Standard Band Plan Frequency

All three of these frequencies interfere with the fishery radio services in Japan.\n\nCB Channel Frequency Channel 1 26.968 MHz Channel 2 26.976 MHz Channel 3 27.040 MHz Channel 4 27.080 MHz Channel 5 27.088 MHz Channel 6 27.112 MHz Channel 7 27.120 MHz Channel 8 27.144 MHz\n\nFrequency Range (kHz) Service Allocation 26760-26944 kHz 1W DSB Fishery Radio Service 26968-26976 kHz Japanese CB channels 1-2 27016 kHz 1W DSB Fishery Radio Service 27040-27144 kHz Japanese CB channels 3-8 and 2 RC channels 27152 kHz Third RC Channel 27.152 MHz 27310.5-27470.5 kHz 25W SSB Fishery Radio Service 27524-27988 kHz 1W DSB Fishery Radio Service\n\nJapanese 27MHz Double Side Band DSB Marine Fishery Radio\n\n1W-DSB FISHERY RADIO SERVICE JAPAN\n\n26.760 MHz - 27.988 MHz 26760 kHz to 27988 kHz. Frequency band also includes the 8-channel Japanese AM CB band, the 25 watt SSB fishery radio service (see below) and the 26/27 MHz RC frequencies (being phased out in Japan).\n\nSee also: VHF low band 40 MHz (35-40 MHz) 5W DSB Fishery Radio Service\n\nThe 1W DSB Fishery Radio Service has 1 watt maximum carrier power for AM voice and permits use of digital modes - A2D modulation, 6K00A2D / 8K00A2D emissions in addition to A3E AM voice, including integrated position reporting and GPS linked radio nets for communications with and monitoring of large fishing fleets. These frequencies are often overlaid with standard 10 kHz step \"marine CB\" channeling. See 0.5 watt Japanese CB frequencies above. Not designated channel numbers per Japanese law, referred to by frequency. Radios display frequency and often feature selective calling features.\n\nSimilar services exist in other Asian countries, with varying frequency allocations. Radios sold in China and Taiwan covering 26.475 MHz - 27.275 MHz DSB fishery radio, 26.475 MHz - 27.270 MHz DSB fishery radio (this appears to be used in China as well, see also the 27.500 MHz to 39.475 MHz FM fishery radio allocation), 25.550 MHz - 30.495 MHz, 25.555 MHz - 30.500 MHz, others covering 26.065 MHz - 28.755 MHz, 24.265 MHz - 29.655 MHz, the de facto standard export 25.615 MHz - 30.105 MHz or other obvious \"overlays\" from the standard CB channels. See also, the Chinese 27.500 MHz - 39.500 MHz allocation (27.5 MHz - 39.475 MHz on some radios). Radios for the 1 watt DSB Fishery Radio Service are still sold as of 2017, despite issues the widespread proliferation of cheaper \"export\", \"10 meter\" and \"marine CB\" equipment. Ranger Communications (RCI) sells \"Marine CB\" equipment that covers 26.065-28.755 MHz out of the box. The 10 meter band is often plagued by fishery radio interference because of this. Not only does the 10 meter ham (amateur radio) band have numerous intruders because of fishery radio users but legit users also suffer inference from CB stations and other fishery radio band plans that operate in the same 25-30 MHz region.\n\nCB Channel Frequency Channel 26760 26.760 MHz Channel 26768 26.768 MHz Channel 26776 26.776 MHz Channel 26824 26.824 MHz Channel 26840 26.840 MHz Channel 26848 26.848 MHz Channel 26856 26.856 MHz Channel 26864 26.864 MHz Channel 26872 26.872 MHz Channel 26880 26.880 MHz Channel 26888 26.888 MHz Channel 26896 26.896 MHz Channel 26912 26.912 MHz Channel 26920 26.920 MHz Channel 26928 26.928 MHz Channel 26936 26.936 MHz Channel 26944 26.944 MHz Channel 27016 27.016 MHz Channel 27524 27.524 MHz Channel 27532 27.532 MHz Channel 27540 27.540 MHz Channel 27548 27.548 MHz Channel 27556 27.556 MHz Channel 27572 27.572 MHz Channel 27580 27.580 MHz Channel 27628 27.628 MHz Channel 27636 27.636 MHz Channel 27644 27.644 MHz Channel 27652 27.652 MHz Channel 27660 27.660 MHz Channel 27668 27.668 MHz Channel 27676 27.676 MHz Channel 27724 27.724 MHz Channel 27732 27.732 MHz Channel 27740 27.740 MHz Channel 27748 27.748 MHz Channel 27756 27.756 MHz Channel 27764 27.764 MHz Channel 27772 27.772 MHz Channel 27780 27.780 MHz Channel 27828 27.828 MHz Channel 27836 27.836 MHz Channel 27852 27.852 MHz Channel 27860 27.860 MHz Channel 27884 27.884 MHz Channel 27892 27.892 MHz Channel 27908 27.908 MHz Channel 27916 27.916 MHz Channel 27932 27.932 MHz Channel 27940 27.940 MHz Channel 27956 27.956 MHz Channel 27964 27.964 MHz Channel 27980 27.980 MHz Channel 27988 27.988 MHz\n\nJapanese 27MHz Single Side Band SSB Marine Fishery Radio\n\nIn addition to the 26 / 27 MHz double side band 1W-DSB (1 watt AM) fishery radio service available in Japan, a higher power SSB service exists in the same frequency band. J3E emission, 25 watt power limit (per Japanese regulation). Like the 1W DSB 27MHz marine service, many of these frequencies overlap with the traditional CB bands in use outside of Japan.

HF/VHF system covering 27.5 MHz to 39.475 MHz in 25 kHz steps (FM mode). 25 watt power output. Apparently used with GPS and other position-indicating data links for fishing fleets (FSK) in a similar manner to the AM (DSB) and SSB based systems used in Japan, South Korea and other places. Crosses the boundary between HF and VHF at 30 MHz. Used in conjunction with standard MF/HF SSB marine and VHF marine systems. Advertised as a \"dedicated fisheries radio\" or \"FM fishing boat fishery radiotelephone\" \"480 channel fishing fleet fishery wireless FM radiotelephone\" \"HF FM fishery radio\" and numerous variants system with FM voice and FSK datalink capabilities (25 watt transmitters with high gain antennas tuned for 27.5 - 39.5 MHz or 27.500 MHz - 39.475 MHz.\n\nUnlike the Japanese 27 MHz fisheries radio systems (which uses direct frequencies as to reference the channels), this system uses a channelized system with integer channel numbering. Straight channel numbering sequence (channel 1 - 27.500 MHz, channel 2 - 27.525 MHz, channel 3 - 27.550 MHz, channel 3 - 27.575 MHz, channel 5 - 27.600 MHz, etc. through to 39.425 MHz (channel 477) , 39.450 MHz (channel 478) and 39.475 MHz as channel 480) for a total of 480 channels.\n\nRadios appear to come with channels 221 - 32.875 MHz FM, channel 231 - 33.100 MHz FM, channel 236 - 33.225 MHz FM, and channel 238 - 33.275 MHz FM as \"dual watch\" channels (likely for calling purposes).\n\nRadios sold in China for this band appear to have selective calling and automatic location transmission capabilities in addition to regular FM voice. Emission listed as 16K0F3E and 16K0G3E on the FT-801 \"Fisheries Dedicated Radio\" with \"dual transmission mode\" 300 baud rate ASK, 1200 baud rate MSK. Radios also come with voice scrambler (likely voice inversion) capability. Other radios sold in China for this band are called \"Fishing Radio Telephone\" and offer similar features, including an array of selective calling, group calling, automatic distress transmission, automatic location reporting to fixed shore stations and scanning functions. Frequency coverage is the same 27.5 MHz to 39.5 MHz with 20 watts output power (IC-988C FM Transceiver).\n\nOther radios sold for this same frequency band are sold with \"1000 channel mode\" or \"960 channel mode\" which reduces channel spacing from 25 kHz to 12.5 kHz. Channel numbering is not confirmed, but frequency range (27.5 MHz to 39.5 MHz) is identical. Fishing fleet transmissions have been heard on frequencies that fit the 12.5 kHz step channeling - including 29.7375 MHz, 29.8875 MHz, 31.2375 MHz, 32.1125 MHz, 32.1875 MHz, 32.3625 MHz, and others. The fishing fleets using the \"export mode\" appear to not be Chinese. These radios are used throughout Asia, not just Chinese fishing fleets.\n\nThe FT-801 Dedicated Fisheries Radio - Shishi Feitong Communication Equipment Co., Ltd. includes the following capabilities:\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\n27.500 MHz FM - 39.475 MHz FM transmit and receive frequency range\n\n25 kHz channel spacing\n\n480 channels\n\nFM modulation - 16K0F3E / 16K0G3E emission\n\n25 watt transmit power (greater than or equal to 25w across entire frequency range)\n\nFM deviation less than 5 kHz - 4 kHz deviation\n\n500 kHz - 9999 kHz AM receiver (AM broa"
