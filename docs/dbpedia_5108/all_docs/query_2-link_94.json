        "text": "Reissued with obsolete COVID-19 page links removed.\n\nExercise increased caution in France due to terrorism and civil unrest.\n\nCountry Summary: Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in France. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.\n\nIncidents such as pickpocketing and phone snatchings occur frequently and can happen anywhere, especially in crowded areas such as airports, train stations, subway and train cars, and near tourist attractions.\n\nPeaceful demonstrations and strikes in Paris and other cities throughout France occur regularly and can disrupt transportation. On rare occasions, demonstrations have included violence and property damage and police have responded with water cannons and tear gas.\n\nRead the country information page for additional information on travel to France.\n\nIf you decide to travel to France:\n\nBe aware of your surroundings when traveling to tourist locations and large crowded public venues.\n\nAvoid demonstrations and areas with significant police activity.\n\nFollow the instructions of local authorities including movement restrictions related to any ongoing police action.\n\nFind a safe location and shelter in place if unable to leave the vicinity of a demonstration.\n\nMonitor local media for breaking events and adjust your plans based on new information.\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nFollow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nReview the Country Security Report for France.\n\nVisit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel.\n\nPrepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the Traveler’s Checklist.\n\nVisit the Embassy of France website for the most current visa and entry requirement information.\n\nThe Government of France does not recognize the 12-page U.S. emergency passport, issued by U.S. embassies and consulates overseas, as a valid travel document for visa-free entry into France. If traveling on this emergency passport, you may be refused boarding and/or entry by immigration officials and/or held at the airport until a return flight to the U.S. is available. Direct transit through France for another destination accepting an emergency passport may be permitted. You should check entry requirements of any other country of destination to make sure the emergency passport is accepted for entry.\n\nYou may enter the Schengen area, including France, for up to 90 days for tourist and business purposes without a visa.\n\nImmigration officers may also request you show sufficient funds for your intended stay and a return airline ticket.\n\nIf you are traveling to France or Monaco for reasons other than business or tourism, such as employment (including diplomatic or official travel), study, or internship, you must obtain the appropriate French or Monegasque (Monaco) visa for that purpose before you leave the United States. You should be aware that it is nearly impossible to obtain or change visa status while in France.\n\nAll minors (under age 18) traveling without a parent or legal guardian and who are residents in France must have the written consent of at least one parent or legal guardian to leave France. The minor must travel with his or her own I.D., a copy of the parent/guardian’s I.D., and form number 15646*01, executed by the parent/guardian and available here.\n\nIf you are transiting through France to South Africa, there are special requirements for minors. See Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements for South Africa for additional information.\n\nContact the French Embassy in Washington at 4101 Reservoir Road NW, Washington, DC 20007, tel. (202) 944 6000, or one of the French Consulates General in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York, or San Francisco for the most current visa information.\n\nSpecial Note: Overseas departments and territories of France (i.e. those not located in Europe) are not included in the Schengen Agreement. Please see Country Specific Information on French Guiana, French Polynesia, and the French West Indies for entry and exit requirements. For other departments and territories, visit the Embassy of France website for the most current visa and entry requirement information for those areas.\n\nMonaco: For further information on entry requirements to Monaco, travelers may contact the Embassy of the Principality of Monaco, 888 17th Street NW, Suite 500, Washington D.C. 20006, Tel: (202) 234-1530, Email: info@monacodc.org; or the Consulate General of Monaco, 565 Fifth Avenue – 23rd floor, New York, NY 10017, Tel: (212) 286-0500, Email: info@monaco-consulate.com.\n\nTraveling Through Europe: If you are planning to visit or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement.\n\nYour passport should be valid for at least three months beyond the period of stay if you plan on transiting a Schengen country. Please review our U.S. Travelers in Europe page. We recommend that your passport have at least six months’ validity remaining.\n\nYou will need sufficient proof of funds and a return plane ticket.\n\nFor additional information about visas for the Schengen area, see the Schengen Visa page.\n\nHIV/AIDS Restrictions: The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of France.\n\nFind information about dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction and customs regulations on our websites.\n\nTerrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\n\nHigh-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)\n\nHotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists\n\nPlaces of worship\n\nSchools\n\nParks\n\nShopping malls and markets\n\nPublic transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)\n\nFor more information, see our Terrorism page.\n\nFrench authorities have spoken publicly about the heightened threat conditions for terrorist attacks in Europe.\n\nA counterterrorism law enacted in 2017 allows the government to prevent the circulation of individuals and to create zones of protection and security.\n\nThe French government has temporarily reestablished border controls at its borders with its Schengen neighbors and movement may be restricted in some areas. Border controls with the United Kingdom, including the Channel Tunnel crossing, have also been reestablished following Brexit.\n\nThe Government of France routinely conducts security and crisis management drills involving deployment of security forces, emergency services, and police to high profile areas that may be near popular tourist sites. U.S. citizens should be aware of the possibility of drills and should heed instructions of local authorities should they encounter them.\n\nFrench police and military routinely patrol public spaces. You should expect security inspections (to include purses, bags, and backpacks) at the entrance to large public venues and businesses.\n\nWhen traveling or living in France, you should:\n\nBe aware of your local security situation and take appropriate steps to bolster your personal security.\n\nMonitor media and local information sources like France24, Radio France International, The Local, and the Paris Travel Information webpage and factor updated information into personal travel plans and activities.\n\nAddress specific safety concerns to French law enforcement authorities who have responsibility for the safety and security of all residents and visitors to France.\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nCrime: The majority of crimes directed against foreign visitors, including U.S. citizens, involve pick-pocketing (passports, phones, cash, credit cards), vehicle and residential break-ins, bicycle theft, and other forms of theft.\n\nVisitors to congested and popular tourist areas (e.g., museums, monuments, train stations, airports, and subways) should be particularly attentive to their surroundings. Rental cars are frequently targeted for break-ins when visitors exit their vehicles and leave valuables behind.\n\nCrimes of opportunity are more likely to involve violence on the street late at night or when the victim resists.\n\nExercise extra caution when out alone at night and/or consider traveling out at night with trusted companions.\n\nWhile the incidence of sexual assault is statistically low, attacks do occur.\n\nBe aware of “date-rape” drugs, which are present in France. The Embassy has assisted multiple victims who appear to have been targeted using these drugs.\n\nBe cautious in bars and clubs where alcohol is served, and do not leave your drink unattended or accept a drink from strangers, as they may have slipped drugs into the drink.\n\nThere are high incidences of “smash and grab” robberies in economically depressed areas or on highly traveled thoroughfares such as roads to and from the airport. Thieves on foot or motorcycle will approach a vehicle that is stopped in traffic, smash a window, reach into the vehicle to grab a purse or other valuable item, and then flee. Keep doors locked and valuables out of sight.\n\nSee our travel tips for Women Travelers.\n\nDemonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.\n\nDemonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.\n\nPast demonstrations have turned violent.\n\nCheck local media for updates and traffic advisories.\n\nStrikes can interfere with travel plans and increase expenses of traveling to France.\n\nDemonstration organizers must obtain prior police approval, and police routinely oversee participants. In case of violence or property damage, French authorities may use chemical agents and water cannons to disperse crowds.\n\nAlerts issued regarding demonstrations are posted on the U.S. Mission’s website.\n\nInternational Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.\n\nVictims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112 (the European emergency number which has some English-speaking staff) or 17 from a landline or cell phone and contact the U.S. Embassy Paris at +(33)(1) 43-12-22-22. French authorities do not generally speak English and communication may be difficult. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\n\nSee our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nWe can:\n\nhelp you find appropriate medical care\n\nassist you in reporting a crime to the police\n\ncontact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nprovide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion\n\nprovide a list of local attorneys\n\nprovide information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.\n\nprovide the Paris Police Prefecture pamphlet in English\n\nprovide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution\n\nhelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home\n\nreplace a stolen or lost passport.\n\nprovide you with information regarding victims’ assistance groups in France\n\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\n\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. French authorities will not routinely notify the Embassy unless you request them to do so. See our webpage for further information.\n\nPenalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in France are severe.\n\nConvicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.\n\nIn France and Monaco, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol could land you immediately in jail.\n\nFlying Drones: The use of drones and drone footage in France is highly regulated. It is against the law in France to operate drones over public spaces (including museums, parks, streets) in urban areas and near airports, military bases, prisons, nuclear plants, and large gatherings such as outdoor concerts and parades. The privacy of individuals captured in drone footage is paramount. Violators can be arrested and subject to fines of up to 75,000 euros and/or one-year imprisonment. Review the information sheet provided by the French government concerning hobbyist drone flights.\n\nYou should contact the Embassy of France or one of France's consulates in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements. Please see our Customs Information.\n\nThere are strict regulations concerning temporary importation or exportation from France of items such as firearms, antiquities, medications, business equipment, merchandise samples, and other items.\n\nFrench Foreign Legion: U.S. citizens interested in joining the French Foreign Legion (FFL) should be aware that the cognitive and physical tests for acceptance are extremely challenging.\n\nEnsure you have access to sufficient funds to return home should your candidature be refused.\n\nSuccessful candidates report that the FFL provides a new identity and retains their U.S. passport during a long probation period. Lack of access to your passport can complicate routine or emergency travel.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports\n\nHuman Rights Report – see country reports\n\nHajj Fact Sheet for Travelers\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTI Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTQI+ events in France.\n\nSee our LGBTQI+ travel information page and section 6 of the Department of State's Human Rights report for further details.\n\nTravelers with Disabilities: The law in France prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation and general infrastructure.\n\nVisitors to France should expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation (subway, specifically), lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Getting around French cities can be challenging for those with mobility issues. Many sidewalks are narrow and uneven, and cobblestone streets make access difficult, though major tourist sites generally have better facilities.\n\nAlthough the Paris Metro is a very efficient method for traveling throughout central Paris, most stations are not readily accessible for people with disabilities. However, many Parisian buses and tramways are equipped with lowering platforms for travelers with limited-mobility, or sight- or hearing-disabled. Taxis are also a good mode of transportation.\n\nThe English-language Paris Visitors Bureau and Explore France websites contains additional information specifically designed for travelers with special mobility needs. For further information, e-mail U.S. Embassy Paris, U.S. Consulate General Marseille, or U.S. Consulate General Strasbourg.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers.\n\nDial 15 to connect to emergency medical services or dial 112 to reach an operator.\n\nAmbulance services are widely available, though English is not widely spoken.\n\nMedical care is comparable to that found in the United States.\n\nExcept for emergency services, you may be required to pay for service prior to receiving treatment in France. Be sure to obtain a “Feuille de Soins” for later reimbursement from your health care provider.\n\nYou may be refused routine care under local law if you lack the ability to pay.\n\nForeigners with terminal illnesses may be denied treatment if treatment is available in their home country.\n\nWe do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Hospital bills are not itemized.\n\nMedical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\n\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\n\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the government of France to ensure the medication is legal in France.\n\nVaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFurther health information:\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nAir Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\n\nRoad Conditions and Safety: Roads are generally comparable to those in the United States, but traffic engineering and driving habits pose special dangers.\n\nLane markings and sign placements may not be clear. Drivers should be prepared to make last-minute maneuvers.\n\nRight-of-way rules differ from those in the United States. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, drivers entering intersections from the right have priority over those on the left, even when entering relatively large boulevards from small side streets.\n\nBicycles, motorcycles, scooters, and electric skateboards are prevalent on streets, crosswalks and sometimes sidewalks. They have legal priority and often do not respect traffic signals.\n\nOn major highways, there are service stations at least every 25 miles. Service stations are not as common on secondary roads in France as they are in the United States.\n\nHighway toll stations may not accept U.S. credit cards. For non-residents, the simplest way to pay is with cash euros at the toll lane marked for that purpose. Do not attempt to use a credit card if it is the only one you have in your possession in case the machine does not return your card.\n\nTraffic Laws: While French cities actively encourage bicycle rentals through widely available city-sponsored systems, you should be cautious, especially in a busy and unfamiliar urban environment. Helmets are neither required nor readily available near rental stations. If you plan to ride a bicycle in France, you should bring your own helmet. Though bicycles, scooters and electric skateboards must follow local traffic laws, or risk fines, they often do not do so and can pose a danger to drivers and pedestrians. Many paths are clearly marked for this form of transportation in larger cities.\n\nPedestrian accidents occur when a pedestrian steps out into the street, often when a car or motorcycle is making a turn through a pedestrian crosswalk. Pedestrians should be cautious and aware of traffic even when they have a green walking signal since this is no guarantee against aggressive drivers. Do not assume cars will stop for pedestrians in a crosswalk.\n\nPublic Transportation: Paris has an extensive and efficient public transportation system. The interconnecting system of buses, subways, and commuter rails is comparable to or better than that found in major U.S. cities. Similar transportation systems are found in all major French cities.\n\nIf you use any of France’s public transportation services, take particular care to retain your used or “validated” ticket until you exit the bus, subway, or train station completely, as it may be checked or required for exit. Children over four years of age must have a ticket.\n\nInspectors conduct intermittent, random checks and passengers who fail to present the correct validated ticket are subject to stiff and immediate fines. Failing to sign and date or enclose photo (when required) on a tourist pass (Paris Visite) makes the pass invalid and the holder subject to a fine.\n\nInspectors may show no interest in explanations and no sympathy for an honest mistake. Failure to cooperate with inspectors may result in arrest.\n\nBetween cities, France has extensive rail service, which is safe and reliable. High-speed rail connects the major cities in France. Many cities are also served by frequent air service. Traveling by train is safer than driving.\n\nSee our road safety page for more information. Visit the website of the French National Tourist Office for specific information on French driver's permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, and mandatory insurance. See Embassy of France’s driving in France webpage for information on using U.S. driver’s licenses in France.\n\nAviation Safety Oversight: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of France’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of France’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the FAA’s safety assessment page.\n\nMaritime Travel: Mariners planning travel to France should also check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts. Information may also be posted to the U.S. Coast Guard homeport website, and the NGA broadcast warnings website (select “broadcast warnings.”)"
