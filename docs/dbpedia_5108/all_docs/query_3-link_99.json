        "text": "NPR is in Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics. For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nLE BOURGET, France — If you hold the world record in the fastest Olympic sport you can technically call yourself the fastest-ever Olympian, right?\n\nIf so, that title belongs to Team USA speed climber Sam Watson.\n\nBut that doesn’t necessarily mean you win the medal race.\n\nIt was Veddriq Leonardo of Indonesia who scaled the climbing wall and slapped the buzzer the quickest to win gold in the men’s sport climbing speed event final Thursday in Le Bourget, northeast of Paris.\n\nHis time was 4.75 seconds (.01 slower than Watson’s brand-new world record), besting China’s Peng Wu, who took silver after posting 4.77 seconds.\n\nLeonardo is the first person to win Indonesia an Olympic gold medal in a sport outside of badminton — and a first for the nation at the Paris Games.\n\n“I feel so amazing, grateful for the competition today,” he said. “I made my dream come true.\"\n\nIt was an upset to Watson, who set a couple world records this week.\n\nAfter clinching third, he said: “Obviously I wanted the gold, I wanted to be on the top of the podium, but a couple of millimeters went wrong on my second race and that’s just how it is sometimes. Congratulations to Wu and Leonardo — I’m very excited for the future of speed climbing.”\n\nEarlier this year, the 18-year-old from Texas set a new world record of 4.79 at the World Cup in China. Then, on Tuesday at the Paris Olympics, Leonardo matched his 4.79 mark. Moments later, in the elimination heats, Watson went even faster — by .04 seconds — to set a world record of 4.75 seconds.\n\nIn the semifinal, though, he lost to Chinese climber Peng Wu, 4.93-4.85. The loss fueled him: In the bronze medal race, Watson set another world record of 4.74 seconds.\n\nIn sport climbing — a newish addition to the Olympics — two sets of medals are given out: one for the lead and bouldering event and one for the speed event, a change from sport climbing’s inaugural Olympics at the Tokyo Games in 2021, when one medal was awarded for the trifecta.\n\nThe decision to combine all disciplines into a single medal event was a controversial one, especially to climbers who don’t view speed as “real” rock climbing because they say it requires less technique and creativity.\n\nIn lead, climbers try to get as far up a higher wall as possible. Bouldering is about problem solving shorter, technical routes.\n\nSpeed climbing is about who can \"Spider-man\" climb to the top of the wall the fastest, but — more importantly — it’s about beating the other climber in the two-person race up the 15-meter-high wall (49.2 feet)."
