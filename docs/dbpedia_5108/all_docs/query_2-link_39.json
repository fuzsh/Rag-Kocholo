        "text": "Ales Fevzer\n\nAthletics 8/8/2024 8:33:00 PM\n\nBlue Devils in the Paris Olympics Recap - Aug. 8\n\nPARIS - The Blue Devils continued competition at the 2024 Olympics on Thursday with action in women's golf, wrestling and men's basketball. Here is a recap from action on Aug. 8 in France.\n\nBoutier Remains in Top-10 Through 36 Holes in Women's Golf\n\nComing off a 7-under, 65, in the opening round, former Duke women's golf standout Celine Boutier signed for a 76 on Thursday, but still remains tied for sixth overall on the individual leaderboard at the Le Golf National in Paris.\n\nBoutier, a 2016 Blue Devil graduate, couldn't get her birdies to drop like day one as she had only two in the second round. Playing in her home country of France, Boutier heads into the third round only five strokes off the lead with 36 holes remaining.\n\nIn her first Olympic appearance with Slovenia, 2020 Duke graduate Ana Belac posted an even-par, 72, to move up to a tie for 41st with a 5-over, 149. After a pair of bogeys over her first four holes, Belac settled down and played her final 14 holes at 2-under-par to finish even par. She posted birdies on No. 6, No. 7 and No. 14.\n\nLeona Maguire, a 2018 Duke graduate from Ireland, turned in a 79 on Thursday and is tied for 57th with two days remaining. She has been limited to only three birdies over her first two days.\n\nTune in Friday morning on Golf Channel for third round coverage.\n\nRamos Makes Olympic Debut with Puerto Rico\n\nDuke wrestling assistant coach Ethan Ramos made his Olympic debut Thursday with his home country of Puerto Rico in the men's freeestyle 86kg bracket. Ramos went up against Dauren Kurugliev of Greece and dropped an 11-0 decision. With the loss, he does not advance.\n\nUnited States Advance to Gold Medal Game\n\nThe American men's basketball team stormed back from a double-digit halftime deficit to defeat Serbia, 95-91, in the semifinal on Thursday afternoon. The United States outscored the Serbian squad, 32-15, in the final quarter to secure the comeback victory and advance to the gold medal game.\n\nFormer Blue Devil Jayson Tatum did not play in the contest. The U.S. match up with host nation France in the final, which is set for Saturday, Aug. 10. Tipoff between the two teams is scheduled for 3:30 p.m., ET, and fans can watch live on NBC or stream via Peacock."
