        "text": "Introduction\n\n1In an October 1934 article in the BBC’s educational journal The Listener, Scottish writer and activist Naomi Mitchison reviewed the latest set of pamphlets for the BBC’s ‘Broadcasts to Schools’. The review positioned the BBC’s radio lessons for schools as a technological milestone in teaching, introducing a third element into the classroom space that had previously been limited to the linear, teacher-pupil relationship. Mitchison described how the broadcaster must connect as much with the ‘ordinary, flesh-and-blood teacher, who is standing by’, as with the room full of pupils listening to the lesson on the radio. Herself an historical novelist, Mitchison awarded special praise to the BBC’s series of History broadcasts by Rhoda and Eileen Power. They were regarded as being particularly successful in cultivating this new, triangular pedagogical relationship:\n\n1 Naomi Mitchison, ‘Teaching the Teachers’, The Listener, 10 October 1934, p. 615.\n\nAnd then World History with Eileen Power, and British History with Rhoda Power – and any parent or teacher knows that the two Powers have a way with history: it just comes alive in their hands. One looks forward particularly to the dramatic interludes.\n\n2In 1934 BBC broadcasting for schools was thriving, having begun only a decade earlier when the British state education system was itself undergoing considerable reform and expansion. This article considers the relationship between BBC radio and mass secondary education in Britain through the life of the innovative schools History broadcaster Rhoda Dolores Le Poer Power (1890-1957). I argue that during the mid-twentieth century the BBC was closely aligned with mainstream educational thinking, and that its broadcasting structures and practices largely reproduced the stratification of social knowledge seen in Britain’s evolving secondary school system between the 1920s and the 1950s. Through the work of Rhoda Power, the article also shows how the BBC created unique spaces for women to participate in and lead educational thinking, at a time when their influence within elite education in universities was diminishing.\n\n4This article now proceeds in three parts. It first outlines how the BBC initially developed its offering for school audiences in the 1920s and 1930s, and how this related to broader educational structures and agendas in Britain during this period. The second section of the article introduces the History broadcaster Rhoda Power, doyenne of BBC schools broadcasting between the 1920s and 1950s. Her experiences in travel and ethnographic observation are used to explain the development of her quasi-anthropological pedagogical philosophy, which was hugely influential on BBC broadcasting for schools in the period up to the 1960s. The final, third section explores how this philosophy was put into practice in History lessons for schools on the radio. It also examines the evolution of the BBC’s mid-century educational project during and after the Second World War, as Britain’s mass education system expanded as part of the post-1945 welfare state.\n\nBBC education and the development of broadcasting for schools, 1924-39\n\nRhoda Power, time travel, and ‘oral vision’\n\n42 'Rhoda Power: Letters from America: Letter 3', 10 April 1947: GCA, GCPP Power, R 2/3.\n\n…we began to witness a scene so reminiscent of the middle ages, that I could almost have believed myself back in medieval Europe watching the craft gilds celebrating Corpus Christi Day. Every detail of the scene was reenacted by these Indians.\n\nHistory broadcasting and the BBC’s mid-century educational project\n\n31British secondary education was fully reorganised after the Second World War. Through the engine of the post-1945 welfare state, many of the stratifying trends that the BBC had been tracking in its programme offerings during the 1930s were fully realised. The 1944 Education Act (the Butler Act) mandated that all English and Welsh LEAs had to provide a variety of secondary educational provision and abolished fees in the grammar schools. Most (although not all) LEAs responded by implementing a tripartite or bipartite system and used the ‘eleven-plus’ examination to allocate pupils aged 11-15 into either academic grammar schools, non-academic secondary modern schools, or vocational technical schools. Schools broadcasting subtly adapted and responded to this new system in light of the BBC’s new structures. Programmes for less academic pupils, most likely those attending secondary modern schools, aired on the Home Service, whilst more advanced programming was offered for older, grammar school pupils on the Third Programme."
