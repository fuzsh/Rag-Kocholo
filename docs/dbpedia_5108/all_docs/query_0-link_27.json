        "text": "Radio Waves\n\nLike water waves, radio waves also radiate away from a point of origin. When radio waves are generated, they spread out from the transmitting point in all directions at the speed of light-about 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second. When the waves encounter a receiving antenna, they cause electrons in the antenna to surge back and forth, just as the water waves cause objects on the water to bob up and down. The electron surges are converted by circuits in a radio or television receiver into light or sound reproducing the transmitted audio or video signal.\n\nAlthough radio waves can be bent like water waves, they are not shaped like water waves. To illustrate, water waves spread in circles over a flat surface, whereas radio waves, when sent in the simplest form, are like a set of expanding domes. These waves spring up around the transmitting antenna and spread out through space one inside another. For most radio broadcasting heard in homes, some energy travels through the ground, accompanying the waves above the surface. The ground energy serves principally to keep the air waves following the curvature of the Earth. Radio engineers can also send waves in beams or other desired shapes for special purposes.\n\nNo particles of water, air, or any other substance can carry radio signals. A radio wave is a special combination of electric and magnetic forces. These forces can be seen at work with commonplace objects. A magnet spreads energy through space to pick up iron filings, tacks, and other light bits of iron. Rubbing a comb with wool gives it an electric charge. This charge reaches across space and attracts or picks up bits of paper. A radio wave is made of these same electric and magnetic forces, but it is sent from an antenna (or signal radiator), often with enough power to travel a long distance through space and penetrate solid structures.\n\nIn empty space, or any vacuum, radio waves spread at the same speed as light. The speed through air is almost the same. A transmitted wave will travel 186,000 miles in just one second.\n\nTo create radio waves a transmitter must send pulses at an extremely fast rate—from many thousands to millions of cycles a second. (A single wave is called a cycle. Frequencies are stated in cycles a second, or hertz. Thus, a frequency of one kilocycle a second, or one kilohertz (kHz), is 1,000 waves a second. One megacycle a second, or one megahertz (MHz), is one million waves a second.) The frequency of the wave does not alter the speed of travel.\n\nThere is a very important relationship between frequency and wavelength. Suppose a transmitter broadcasts at a frequency of 750,000 waves a second (750 kHz). After one second the wave sent at the start will be 186,000 miles away; and the transmitter will have sent a total of 750,000 waves. Therefore, the length of each wave is 186,000 miles divided by 750,000, or about one quarter mile. If another transmitter sends at a frequency of 1,100,000 waves a second (1.1 MHz), each wave will be about one sixth of a mile long.\n\nWaves of different lengths can cross or even travel along the same lines without mixing (just as water waves of different lengths also remain separate as they cross each other). Thus, many stations can operate in the same region without interference if their frequencies are different. Government licensing of transmitters insures that each will be given exclusive use of a separate, specific frequency for a given region. In broadcasting, listeners receive the station they want by tuning their receivers to that station’s frequency.\n\nThe frequencies that can be used for radio services of any kind are called radio frequencies (as opposed to the many other frequencies that present technology cannot use). A train of waves used for transmitting on a particular frequency is called a carrier wave. Thus a carrier wave actually contains billions of single waves which cannot be seen, heard, or felt.\n\nThe sounds a person hears in a radio broadcast are actually vibrations or waves in the air. The lowest frequency (vibrations a second) that can be heard is about 15. Middle A on a piano has the frequency 440 (see music). The highest tones that humans can hear—the high overtones that give quality to musical tones—range up to about 15,000. These sound vibration rates are called audio frequencies. But audio frequencies are much too low to create satisfactory carrier waves for broadcasting. To broadcast speech or music the sound vibrations must be “loaded” onto a carrier wave for transmission to receivers. This can be done by first converting the sound vibrations into vibrations in an electric current, as in a telephone. For radio the conversion is made inside a microphone. This varying current is then used to shape, or modulate, the carrier wave.\n\nRadio frequency and wavelength ranges type frequency range wavelength range extremely low frequency (ELF) 30–300 hertz 10,000–1,000 kilometers (6,214–621 miles) voice frequency (VF) 300 hertz–3 kilohertz 1,000–100 kilometers (621–62 miles) very low frequency (VLF) 3–30 kilohertz 100–10 kilometers (62–6 miles) low frequency (LF) 30–300 kilohertz 10–1 kilometers (6–0.6 miles) medium frequency (MF) 300 kilohertz–3 megahertz 1 kilometer–100 meters (0.6 mile–328 feet) high frequency (HF) 3–30 megahertz 100–10 meters (328–33 feet) very high frequency (VHF) 30–300 megahertz 10–1 meters (33–3 feet) ultra high frequency (UHF) 300–3,000 megahertz 1 meter–10 centimeters (3 feet–4 inches) super high frequency (SHF) 3,000 megahertz–30 gigahertz 10–1 centimeters (4–0.4 inches) extremely high frequency (EHF) 30–300 gigahertz 1–0.1 centimeter (0.4–0.04 inch)\n\nGround, direct, and sky waves\n\nRadio waves can travel through the atmosphere or a vacuum. Like light waves, radio waves travel in straight lines. Some of the transmitted waves travel along the ground and follow the curvature of the Earth. Others travel up through the atmosphere and are refracted, or bent, back to Earth by the layer of ionized gases called the ionosphere. These three paths (direct, ground, and sky waves) allow radio signals to propagate or spread over a large area. With ground waves and especially sky waves, radio signals can reach beyond the horizon.\n\nThe ground waves follow the curved surface of the Earth. They provide most of the energy that reaches receivers, up to the limit they can travel-from 50 to 100 miles (80 to 160 kilometers), depending upon the design and power of the transmitter, the frequency, and the transmitting characteristics of the soil. Salt water is 5,000 times better than dry earth for transmitting ground waves. Hence signals can travel great distances at sea.\n\nA sky wave radiates outward and upward to the ionosphere in the upper atmosphere. As a result of the sun’s radiation, the ionosphere contains many ionized (electrified) particles. These react to low-frequency waves by reflecting them back to the Earth. This provides reception beyond the distance reached by the ground wave. Between the two receptions there may be a skip area, or dead zone, where the station cannot be heard. The sky wave from a very powerful transmitter can be reflected several times between the ionosphere and the Earth. This multiple reflection carries high-power, low-frequency waves across the oceans.\n\nAmplitude modulation\n\nThe oldest modulating method used for broadcasting varies the strength, or amplitude, of each single wave in the carrier. This is called amplitude modulation (AM). (In a wave diagram, zero strength is shown by the baseline. Amplitude is shown above and below the baseline.)\n\nThe modulation must impress upon each other, or blend, two characteristics of each distinct sound. One is its intensity, or loudness. The other is its frequency of vibration, or pitch. The pitch is the position of a musical note on the scale (or the difference between a man’s lower-toned voice and a woman’s higher-pitched voice). Loudness is transmitted by the amount of increase given to the amplitude of each single wave in the carrier. As an example of how pitch is transmitted, suppose the frequency of a carrier wave is 500 kHz (500,000 individual waves a second). Suppose next that a low tone has a vibration rate of 100 a second. When this tone is loaded onto a carrier, each vibration in it occupies 5,000 single carrier waves.\n\nEach sound vibration, however, increases in strength during about half the time it lasts and decreases during the other half. The single carrier waves, therefore, increase gradually in amplitude for 2,500 waves then decrease gradually for the next 2,500. A vibration rate of 500 a second is loaded similarly upon 1,000 waves in the carrier (500 increasing amplitude, 500 decreasing). These durations transmit the pitch for each tone when the tone is sorted out in a receiver.\n\nThis method works no matter how many individual sounds must be carried at the same instant. There are thousands of separate sounds (tones and overtones) from the instruments of a symphony orchestra every instant that it plays. The modulating apparatus adds them electrically, however, as fast as they are received and impresses the result upon the waves in the carrier. The carrier transmits the whole sound of the orchestra. These are the same combinations of sounds that strike a listener’s ears instant after instant at a concert. The brain sorts out the individual voices of the instruments whether one listens to the orchestra at the concert or through a radio receiver.\n\nReception\n\nAs each wave in the carrier passes a receiver’s antenna, it sets up a weak surge of electrons in the antenna. This duplicates (except for strength) the corresponding surge in the transmitter. The antenna receives carrier waves from many stations at the same time. The tuning circuits pass to the rest of the set only the carrier waves of the frequency that the listener selects. The selected carrier waves are then amplified until they are strong enough to operate a detector in the receiver.\n\nThe detector takes the first step in sorting out the audio frequencies from the carrier. This process can be shown by a diagram of a carrier. In the diagrams illustrating the transmission and reception of radio waves, the tips of the waves in the radio-frequency carrier (colored lines) are joined by black lines on either side, which form the envelope of the carrier wave. It matches exactly the audio pulse that was fed into the microphone.\n\nThe detecting device may be a crystal, an electron tube, or (most likely) a transistor-filled integrated circuit, or “chip.” These devices pass electric current in one direction only. When the modulated carrier is applied to the detector, the detector passes on electrical impulses that vary in strength to match the changes in the envelope. These impulses are then amplified until they are strong enough to operate a speaker, which changes the current back to sound. Throughout this amplifying, the current reproduces the audio-frequency (sound) pulses. The overall changes in strength (amplitude) reproduce the general loudness or softness of the sound. The small changes, occurring hundreds and thousands of times a second, reproduce pitches and qualities of all the tones.\n\nSide bands and frequency modulation\n\nSound broadcasting by amplitude modulation has important limitations of quality. Although the carrier has only one central frequency, when audio frequencies are combined with it they create a pair of side bands of frequencies. One band contains frequencies added to the central frequency. In the other, the frequencies are subtracted. These side bands extend the transmission over a range of frequencies.\n\nAM broadcast stations are limited to a side band of 5 kHz on each side of the central frequency. The total width is called a radio channel. AM channels do not have the bandwidth to permit transmission of all the higher overtones of music. The method of frequency modulation (FM) can do so because the necessary channel width (200 kHz) is available.\n\nThe AM method uses audio-frequency pulses to vary the strength of carrier waves, which keep the same frequency. Circuits can be arranged, however, to make the varying strength in the audio pulse change the frequency of the carrier wave. This produces frequency modulation. As loudness of the sound source increases, so does the frequency of the carrier wave.\n\nThe diagrams on this page compare amplitude and frequency modulation. In Diagram 1 an audio-frequency pulse is registered upon a direct current. The pulse itself is vibratory, but its effect is to strengthen or weaken the current.\n\nIn Diagram 2 an audio-frequency pulse has modulated a radio-frequency carrier by varying the amplitude of the waves. The carrier envelope (black lines) duplicates the audio pulse. Louder tones have greater amplitude than do more quiet tones.\n\nIn Diagram 3, showing frequency modulation, the weaker audio pulse is represented by a moderate increase and decrease of frequency. The louder pulse gives a greater frequency as shown by more crowding together of the waves.\n\nIn the traditional analog television signal, both modulation methods are used. Video information, which is carried on the picture carrier, is amplitude modulated. Audio information, which is carried on the sound carrier, is frequency modulated. Digital television—which became the standard mode of transmission in the United States in 2009—uses digital modulation for both.\n\nFiltering out noise\n\nFM radio is nearly free of static interference caused by lightning and various spark discharges. These disturbances act chiefly upon the amplitude of the transmitted wave. Much of this can be filtered out by noise-limiting circuits which suppress amplitude changes that would interfere with the desired signals. Excess noise triggers the circuit, which clips the excess amplitude from the affected waves. Thus the waves when diagrammed appear to have squared-off tops.\n\nSome electrical devices, such as automotive ignition systems, generate varying frequencies. These register as static in some radio receivers, unless the manufacturer of the device includes a circuit to suppress the interfering signal.\n\nInvention\n\nThe concept of sending information over a distance without connecting telegraph or telephone wires was first theorized by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell in the mid-1860s. German physics professor Heinrich Hertz proved Maxwell’s theory to be correct with experiments in the late 1880s. Italian innovator Guglielmo Marconi pieced together work by others, adding (among other things) the all-important aerial or antenna, and began sending wireless signals over a mile or so in 1895 on his parent’s estate near Bologna. In Marconi’s wireless method, an electric charge was built up until it sparked across a tiny air gap. Such an electric spark produces electromagnetic radiation. If groups of sparks are timed to send radiations at proper intervals, the waves can be used to carry signals in telegraphic code.\n\nWhen Italian government authorities expressed little interest, Marconi, then just 21, traveled to London where his mother had good social connections. As the capital of a thriving empire, London was the ideal place to sell the potential of wireless communication, and soon the British army and navy were actively experimenting with applications of wireless. Marconi improved his equipment such that he sent the first message (simply the Morse code for the letter “s”) across the Atlantic Ocean in 1901. Within a few years, his company was building transmitters on both sides of the Atlantic and offering commercial service to business and governments (few individuals could afford the high cost), in competition with submarine telegraph cables. Marconi also placed wireless equipment on board merchant ships. For the first time, ships could stay in touch with land even when far out at sea.\n\nTo transmit the human voice, however, required the transmission of continuing radio waves—something not possible using Marconi’s spark gap method. The first known broadcast transmissions of music and voice were made by Reginald A. Fessenden using his experimental transmitter at Brant Rock, Mass., in December 1906. These initial continuous wave transmissions consisted largely of music from phonograph records. But Fessenden fell out with his financial backers and did not continue the effort. He did develop a means of long-distance radio communication called an “alternator” that remained in use into the early 1920s when more capable vacuum tube technology was introduced.\n\nIn 1883 prolific American inventor Thomas A. Edison inadvertently discovered something that would become a key element of early wireless telephony. He noticed that the filament inside his new incandescent light bulb gave off electrified particles that quickly blackened the inside of the glass bulb. He did not follow up on his discovery (soon dubbed the “Edison effect”) because he was concentrating on introducing the electric lamp. Two decades later, however, English electrical engineer J.A. Fleming applied this Edison finding to create a vacuum tube known as the “Fleming valve”—a closed glass tube that contained a filament and a plate. Such a tube is now called a diode. Since electrons flowed only from the hot filament to the plate, the diode produced direct current, even when alternating voltage was applied.\n\nSoon others, including inventors Edwin Howard Armstrong and Lee De Forest, were improving the vacuum tube, making wireless telephony more practical. In 1906 De Forest added a grid in the middle of the diode, making it into a triode (see electronics) or what he called an Audion. He used it to broadcast a live performance by opera singer Enrico Caruso in 1910. De Forest and Armstrong independently developed the regenerative circuit, though Armstrong understood its potential far better. This greatly aided reception and also could make an Audion produce oscillating current for a radio carrier wave. In 1918 Armstrong invented the superheterodyne circuit, which is still used in most radio, radar, and television reception.\n\nOld-Time Radio (to 1960)\n\nThe first American radio programs were as experimental as the equipment they used. Before radio, people enjoyed sports events, singers and dance bands, and vaudeville variety shows. The first radio programs built on these forms of entertainment. But by the late 1920s, people demanded more and the notion of different program types (or genres) began to develop, especially on the new national networks. The examples that follow are all from one or another of the four national radio networks. Local stations provided further music and variety programming as well.\n\nComedy and variety\n\nRadio’s comedy shows were mainly of two types: those with plots and those without. Situation comedies were half-hour programs with simple stories or plots and continuing characters. Comedy-variety shows consisted of skits, music, and joke telling. Most radio comedians were veterans of vaudeville—troupers who had worked in theaters across the country for years. Radio allowed them to perform in one area while being heard over the whole country.\n\nOne of the earliest comedy-variety shows first aired on Oct. 18, 1921, on WJZ. It starred Ernie Hare and Billy Jones, who became “The Happiness Boys” in 1926 when they were sponsored by Happiness candy on NBC. The singers were soon overtaken in audience popularity by outstanding vaudevillians, including comedians Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Bob Hope, and Red Skelton. Each of these comedians developed a radio character and a cast of sidekicks.\n\nThe first nationally popular radio program featured two white men playing a variety of black characters. Although it is an exaggeration to say that the country stopped for 15 minutes every night to listen to Amos ’n’ Andy, it is not far from the truth. Freeman F. Gosden and Charles Correll created what today would be considered stereotyped African American dialects. They began as Sam and Henry on WGN in Chicago in 1926. Two years later they were signed by a rival station (and had to change their on-air names since WGN owned rights to the originals) and became Amos and Andy. Gosden played Amos Jones and the shrewd and scheming George (“Kingfish”) Stevens. Correll played the naive Andrew H. Brown, president of the Fresh Air Taxi Cab Company—so named because their one car had no windshield. In one format or another, Amos and Andy remained on the air until 1960.\n\nDrama\n\nDramatic programs on radio took several years to fully develop. At first writers presumed that stories could only take place at night or in caves or other locations lacking light since listeners would not be able to see anything, relying only on dialogue and description. But it did not take long to realize that listeners had imaginations that made vivid pictures out of what they heard.\n\nThe best demonstration of the powerful impact radio drama could have on those imaginations came on the evening of Oct. 30, 1938. The Mercury Theatre on the Air, a one-hour dramatic series on CBS produced and directed by Orson Welles, aired on Halloween eve. Welles’s troupe presented a dramatization of H.G. Wells’ War of the Worlds, about an invasion of Earth by Martians. So realistic was the performance (in the radio script the setting was in New Jersey and New York City, not in London, as in the original novel) that, in spite of on-air assurances that it was only a play, millions of listeners panicked over visions of rampaging monsters and burning cities. The next day, Welles professed surprise that the drama had such impact. But he was being disingenuous—the program weaved its story just as radio might have broken an actual news event, and realistic sounds contributed to the overall effect. Recordings of that broadcast played today can still chill listeners.\n\nSome dramatic programs showcased plays written for the stage or Hollywood films. Among them were The Lux Radio Theatre, The Mercury Theatre on the Air, and First Nighter. Other programs featured continuing casts of characters with new plots each week. Among these were Grand Central Station, Death Valley Days, Dr. Christian, Escape, and Wilderness Road. Many other dramas catered to younger listeners, of which the most famous was the long-running Lone Ranger, about a masked western hero, and Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy, about a young teen who had fantastic adventures in exotic places.\n\nStarting about 1930, radio networks aired weekly programs featuring everything from conventional detectives to the most bizarre encounters with the supernatural. Crime fighters included both amateur and professional detectives. Some programs emphasized the time element and suspense, others the character of everyday criminals. Some, such as Sherlock Holmes, were based on heroes from earlier media. The Shadow centered on “Lamont Cranston, wealthy young man-about-town,” who had learned in the Orient how to make himself invisible, thus enabling him to trap criminals every week. Many private investigators were featured on the air, most of them hard-bitten with handsome female friends or sidekicks. The official forces of law and order appeared on Gangbusters, Counterspy, Dragnet, Mr. District Attorney, and The F.B.I. in Peace and War.\n\nOf the suspense programs, Inner Sanctum Mysteries probably had the largest following. It first aired in 1941 and was followed the next year by Lights Out and Suspense. Each of these programs offered anthology drama—with changing casts and stories each week, usually written by different authors. Westerns, which later became popular on television, varied from the singing cowboy shows of Gene Autry and Roy Rogers to the more dramatic Gunsmoke (which also ran on television), Fort Laramie, The Tom Mix Ralston Straightshooters (for children), and Have Gun, Will Travel (also a television hit).\n\nCommonly called “soaps,” because many of them were sponsored by soap manufacturers, daily serial dramas. or soap operas, appealed mostly to women and were broadcast during morning and afternoon hours. A chief exception was One Man’s Family, a half-hour series created by Carlton E. Morse that was broadcast in the evenings. One Man’s Family first aired on April 29, 1932, and lasted until overtaken by television in 1959. The series was unusual in one respect-the characters aged in real time over the years. Soap operas were generally 15 minutes long, on the air five days a week. They were nearly all produced by advertising agencies (not the networks that carried them) for their consumer product sponsors. Each featured continuing characters and slow-moving plots that focused on human foibles and romance. Episodes always ended with the program announcer breathlessly setting up the next day’s program to encourage continued listening.\n\nMusic\n\nExpanding from merely playing records on the air, radio soon catered to every musical taste—from grand opera to the novelty music played by Spike Jones and his City Slickers. Music has always been a staple of radio from the medium’s earliest days. The Metropolitan Opera in New York City began airing productions every Saturday afternoon—and continued to do so into the 21st century. The Bell Telephone Hour, The NBC Symphony Orchestra, and the Longines Symphonette each offered chiefly light classical music. The National Barn Dance and Grand Ole Opry helped to create a national audience for country music. Shows of the big-band era featured dance music by Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, conductor Guy Lombardo (long a feature on New Year’s Eve broadcasts), clarinetist Benny Goodman, trumpeter Glen Miller, and others. Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians featured both instrumental and vocal music.\n\nThe era’s leading vocalists had their own shows. Bing Crosby first went on radio in 1931 and remained in music and variety shows on television for its first several decades. Other popular vocalists included Kate Smith, Nelson Eddy, and Rudy Vallee. Your Hit Parade presented the top songs of the week, sung by such stars as Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, and Dinah Shore, who also had their own network shows. Some music programs were almost comedy-variety shows. Kay Kyser’s Kollege of Musical Knowledge was a quiz-variety show.\n\nQuiz and audience participation\n\nRadio quiz programs became popular in the late 1930s and continued until network radio programs disappeared by 1960. Each program featured its own game or gimmick whereby entertainment stars or studio audience members could win prizes. Take It or Leave It, for example, doubled the prize money for correct answers until a total of 64 dollars was reached. Other programs awarded those who could identify music. In Truth or Consequences audience members had to endure silly “punishments” for not answering questions. Information Please and The Quiz Kids were shows that tested panels of experts. Non-quiz audience-participation shows included People Are Funny and Pick a Date.\n\nNews and public affairs\n\nBy the late 1930s, as tensions rose in Europe and Asia, the networks featured news commentators such as Lowell Thomas and Fulton Lewis, Jr., on current events. CBS reporter Edward R. Murrow began commentaries from London in 1938, and William L. Shirer reported on the rise of Nazi Germany from Berlin. During the war, Murrow built a fine cadre of reporters (“Murrow’s Boys”) who would help to define broadcast news in the years to come. Gossip columnists also thrived, feeding their audiences tidbits on celebrities in Hollywood and New York City. Among them, Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper broadcast from Los Angeles, and Ed Sullivan and Walter Winchell originated in New York City.\n\nDocumentary programs such as The March of Time and Passing Parade dramatized news events from the previous week. America’s Town Meeting of the Air provided a forum for debating major public controversies. During and after World War II, radio playwright Norman Corwin wrote lyrical documentaries for CBS that reflected the troubled wartime and then postwar world.\n\nFew political figures made effective use of radio in its early days. During the presidential contest of 1932—at the depths of the Depression—a candidate emerged who could utilize radio as the perfect tool for political messages. Franklin D. Roosevelt began to make radio speeches during the campaign. The confidence inspired by his easily recognizable voice aided in his overwhelming victory. Having realized the value of the medium, he used it consistently and effectively during his more than 12 years in office. His informal “fireside chats” drew millions of listeners. The first one aired on March 12, 1933, and was heard by an estimated 60 million people.\n\nOther programs\n\nAfter-school hours and Saturday mornings were devoted to children’s programming. These shows were mostly adventures featuring dramatic heroes such as Jungle Jim, Captain Midnight, space explorers Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon, Superman, Tarzan, Dick Tracy, and Tom Corbett, Space Cadet. There were also programs in a lighter vein—Gasoline Alley, Joe Palooka, L’il Abner, and Popeye. The Lone Ranger, an evening western, was primarily aimed at children. Initially youngsters were a difficult radio audience to program for because they were hard for broadcasters to “sell” to advertisers. Eventually broadcasters convinced makers of cereal and other consumer products that children could be persuasive consumers.\n\nSome radio shows fit no set category. Major Bowes and His Original Amateur Hour, for instance, was a weekly talent contest (on which singer Frank Sinatra got his start in 1935). Don McNeill’s Breakfast Club was an hour-long, morning variety show. Played before a studio audience in Chicago, the wake-up program had regular features such as “Memory Time,” a “call to breakfast,” and a “march around the breakfast table.”\n\nOrigins\n\nPioneering broadcasting similar to that in the United States took place in Europe and elsewhere. Britain’s first successful broadcast of a voice took place in 1919. By 1921 about 150 amateur transmitting licenses had been issued. To control the growing business, radio manufacturers began a commercial British Broadcasting Company in 1922. Shortly thereafter, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was chartered by Parliament as a government monopoly that would last for nearly a half century.\n\nOn the Continent, regular broadcasting began in The Netherlands in 1919. Experimental stations took to the air in Denmark in 1921, and Denmark’s State Broadcasting System began service in 1925. A station was on the air in Paris by 1922. Radio broadcasts began in Canada in 1919, with the first commercial station appearing in 1922, and radio aired in Australia in 1923. Stations aired in Cuba, Puerto Rico and Mexico in 1921–22. Radio stations appeared elsewhere around the world. In India, for example, both Bombay and Calcutta had stations by 1927.\n\nRadio continued to expand through the 1930s with most cities being served by the end of the decade save in the most remote areas. The pattern of government control or operation dominated in most of Europe and its colonies while Western Hemisphere nations tended to follow the U.S. commercial example.\n\nAfter World War II, FM (dubbed VHF radio in European nations because of the spectrum it occupies) was seen as a means of reducing chronic AM overcrowding and interference problems. FM could also serve regions largely unreached by existing stations and do so less expensively than medium-wave facilities. Most countries also sought additional program channels. As part of the postwar rebuilding of its shattered industry, for example, Germany led Europe in beginning FM broadcasting. Its first FM transmitters were on the air by 1949, and most of West Germany was well covered with FM by 1951. Sale of FM receivers was brisk, partly because television was not a competitor in Germany until 1952. By 1955 there were 100 FM transmitters in operation. With a severe shortage of medium-wave frequencies, Italy followed suit, first providing its first FM services in the early 1950s. By the early 1960s, multiple FM transmitters were operating as well in Belgium, Britain, Norway, Finland, Switzerland, and Sweden. Japan experimented with FM for a decade before stations opened in major cities in 1969.\n\nFor a time in the 1970s and ’80s, a raft of mini-FM transmitters called “free radio” and covering a radius of only about 3,000 feet were very popular, broadcasting music and advertising. Few were licensed, however, and many were eventually closed down. Perhaps the most extreme examples of local FM radio’s potential took place in the 1970s in France and Italy. When an Italian court held that the state broadcasting authority did not have a monopoly on local radio, hundreds of new FM stations took to the air, providing Italians with the most radio stations-per-person of any nation in the world. Along with music and advertising, stations broadcast often strongly political viewpoints. France went through a more limited version of the trend—by the early 1980s there were more than 100 such stations in the Paris region alone."
