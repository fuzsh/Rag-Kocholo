        "text": "A Conversation with Dustin Abnet\n\nFrom its outbreak, the coronavirus pandemic has prompted a wave of speculation, and worry, over an expected acceleration of the use of automated labor. After all, “the machine doesn’t fall ill.” Worries over the future of labor in the face of competition from robots and computers is especially acute, and serious, today. But as historian Dustin Abnet explains in his book “The American Robot: A Cultural History,” the idea of robots supplanting human workers has captured the American imagination almost since the nation’s founding.\n\nThe American obsession with robots is not confined to labor. As Abnet argues, the robot has been used as a symbol across many different spheres of American society. Through fiction, film, and even traveling exhibitions, the robot has reflected dreams and paranoias around race, gender, class, and labor. Furthermore, robots have often been used to reinforce social and economic inequalities. By examining the robot in American culture, Abnet brings a fresh understanding of the complex interactions between economics, politics, and culture.\n\nBackStory recently spoke with Dustin Abnet. The conversation below has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nBackStory: You cover a lot of ground in this book, using the symbol of the robot to bring together different elements of American culture and history. How did you come across this topic?\n\nAbnet: I came into the topic from labor and working class history. I was doing readings for 1960s and 1970s American economic development, and kept coming across scholars using the term “robot”.\n\nWhat was interesting to me is that they used it in two different ways. One of them, the way I expected, was to talk about advanced automation and the kinds of assembly line arms that started entering factory floors in the 1960s and 1970s. Then, there was the other usage of “robot” to refer to workers themselves.\n\nTo this day, we use the term to refer to both machinery and people who seem vaguely machine-like. I thought it was a really interesting way to get into the history of not only how we think about ourselves, but how we think about other people.\n\nThat is a really rich topic, it encompasses so many different things. What started out as a question about work and technology became something that involved religion, science, class, race and gender as well.\n\nBackStory: You have a huge number of textual and other primary sources in the book. How did you work through and organize all of these documents? How did you decide what to leave out?\n\nAbnet: That is probably the most challenging element here. There is a lot that has been left out, particularly in the post-World War II period. There are just so many robots that it’s impossible, it would be thousands and thousands of pages of textual analysis. But before World War II, I’ve included many of the major robot stories and examples in the United States.\n\nI chose the stories that were particularly emblematic of the larger themes that I was talking about, and that also were relatively popular and important at the time.\n\nIn the post-World War II period I talk mostly about film robots rather than pulp science fiction robots. That’s because in my estimation, the film robots were more popular than the pulp magazine robots. It’s a combination of popularity and thematic resonance that shaped how I chose particular robots.\n\nBackStory: Did you find any sort of robot tradition or metaphor in other cultures as well? For example, African Americans culture has a strong UFO tradition in parallel to white America, but takes it in a very different direction.\n\nAbnet: I looked hard for this, and did not. I looked in a lot of the digitized databases for African American newspapers and various different magazines, and there’s not nearly as strong of a tradition.\n\nThe term itself rarely appeared. Women’s magazines, as well, tended not to use it. You can find occasional references to it, but not nearly to the same extent that I found in mainstream publications written by white editors and writers.\n\nI don’t want to say that it’s not part of that conversation, but that this is a conversation that is, at least at the national level, dominated by white men. This is basically a fantasy of enslavement, and that has a particular resonance with powerful figures.\n\nBackStory: I thought it was fascinating how the idea of the robot reflects different anxieties and ideas about the division of labor between the genders.\n\nAbnet: From the 19th century to the 20th century robots reflect this ideological gender division with labor, both inside and outside of the home.\n\nWhat I find really interesting is that in the 19th century, stories about mechanical women located in the home tended almost always to end in disaster. But in the 20th century it was reversed. By the 1930s, female robots have become objects of desire. By the 1950s, they’re the perfect maids and caretakers of children.\n\nThe gender division of the robot suggested that men saw their role in the world as more mechanical, regimented, and controlled than women’s labor. In other words, men could be mechanized, but women could not. That kind of gender division, I argue, shapes how we understand robots into the 20th century.\n\nBackStory: You’ve positioned this idea of the American robot as a focal point for different questions around race, labor, gender and how individuals relate to society. Has this metaphorical lens led to any insights into the relationship between these different spheres of American life?\n\nAbnet: I want to stress how much these ideas intersect with each other, especially between race and class. One of the things I argue about the original meaning of the term “robot” is that people initially didn’t define it as a machine, they defined it as a worker. But in the context of the United States, with a highly racially segregated workforce, it acquired a racialized meaning as well.\n\nThe key idea I take away from this is how much our analysis needs to interweave race, class, and gender when we think about who counts as a worker and what counts as work in the United States. In the 1950s, when they started talking about consumer robots in the home, mens periodicals were all in favor. Women tended to be a little bit more skeptical about it because they saw that as devaluing what they could do.\n\nA couple of weeks into the coronavirus crisis, there were a lot of articles about how we need robots to fulfill certain jobs in the name of safety. At the same time, these workers are finally being labeled essential.\n\nYou have a mixture of, “Your work is essential, but we should have it done by a robot.” It’s that combination of how we think about other people and the work they do in our society that is so intrinsic to what the robot means.\n\nA Conversation with Russell Cobb\n\nEarlier this year, the Netflix documentary Tiger King briefly dominated American culture. In doing so, it shone a rare spotlight on Oklahoma, the setting for the wild, almost unbelievable antics of its characters. But for many people familiar with the history of Oklahoma, Tiger King is just another anecdote in a culture packed with contradictions, fraud, wealth, and swindles. Russell Cobb focuses on this last aspect of the state in the new book “The Great Oklahoma Swindle: Race, Religion, and Lies in America’s Weirdest State.”\n\nCobb tells a fascinating story of his home state that balances between memoir and history, revealing a hidden past that many Oklahomans rarely acknowledge. This is one of many ways that Cobb understands Oklahoma as a microcosm for many of the issues facing Americans today.\n\nBackStory recently spoke with Russell Cobb as May’s featured author for our monthly BookStory book club. We discuss writing and making history, and get to the bottom of the Oklahoma swindle to discover how Oklahoma got to where it is today.\n\nBackStory: What was the inspiration, the catalyst for this book?\n\nCobb: It started with a feature article I was working on for The Guardian newspaper. I had seen so much bad news about Oklahoma, where I grew up. It had fallen to the very bottom of education funding, and risen to the very top in levels of incarceration. I started to think of it like a failing state. After I wrote that article, it became clear to me that the next step was to understand how it got that way. How is it possible that a place that is so wealthy – it sits on one of the richest oil deposits in the world, it used to be known as the oil capital of the world – can have so many miserable social and health indicators?\n\nBackStory: In the book you have a lot of really fascinating anecdotes or broader stories, and I’m curious how those came to your attention, and how you incorporated those into your writing?\n\nCobb: I have a wealth of experience growing up in Oklahoma and visiting a lot. It wasn’t just that I grew up, I had generations and generations of family in Oklahoma, back to the beginning of the land run. That was the real beginning of the white settlement of what used to be known as Indian Territory. I have family that were rural, poorer Oklahomans, and a lot of them left during the Great Depression. I also have a wealthier side of the family that was connected to the oil boom of the 1910s and 1920s.\n\nSo I took an approach of doing a history through a personal lens. I would think about a lot of these things that I grew up with and stories I heard, and try to push them a little bit further. To push them beyond the idea of lore, or family tradition, or just stories that you hear. What really became shocking is how much of it was either covered up, couched in lies, or misstated, and that gave me a broader window into a lot of issues that I hadn’t taken seriously before.\n\nBackStory: We received a question from one of our BookStory readers, Stephanie Pounds. She is curious about the balance that you struck between writing a personal memoir and a history. Were there any challenges that you faced here? Were there any advantages to this approach?\n\nCobb: I’m not a historian by training, I’m part journalist and part literary critic by training. Years ago, I started to work on a memoir and the people who read it went, “There’s some really weird stuff in here that just doesn’t make sense to me. Can you tell me more about that?”\n\nA lot of it is about oil and land swindles and things that I hadn’t really considered would be interesting to anyone else. I thought people would think, “Oh yeah, of course your great-grandparents made a fortune in oil, and then completely lost it, and killed themselves. Isn’t that the way it goes with everybody?”\n\nThe methodology, if I can put it that way, is, “Okay, here are some things that people talk about, and that I’ve heard a lot about. Let’s see how far we can push that. Let’s take a documentary approach to it. What kind of documents can you find, and where is the real truth?”\n\nHere’s a good example. My wife is from the Bay Area of California, from a liberal background. I was telling her about how in grade school in Oklahoma, we always had a Land Run day to mark the creation of the state of Oklahoma. It gets recreated all the time. A girl named Miss Indian Territory is wedded to a boy named Mr. Oklahoma. There’s a whole speech that’s pronounced where the girl, a beauteous maiden endowed with natural abundance, is going to be wed to an industrious young man who’s going to bring civilization.\n\nThis is a serious affair. People do it at the historical society, they recreate it at the Capitol, they do it in grade schools. My wife went, “That’s crazy. That’s celebrating an illegal invasion.”\n\nAnd I thought, “Yeah, it’s pretty weird. You’re right.”\n\nBackStory: This book is such a tangle of different themes, and mythologies. It’s difficult to establish what is true and what’s false. What’s folklore and what’s fact. A major theme is the idea of the history of Oklahoma as a swindle. You describe the taking of the land from the native populations, and stealing the oil from them and from the earth with all of these dishonest machinations.\n\nBut it also seems like a swindle of the state’s history itself. How the actual events of the past are often intentionally hidden from the present observer, and how Oklahomans have propped up a false narrative of their own history.\n\nCobb: As I say in the very beginning of the book, the state is founded on a swindle. The only reason Oklahoma is Oklahoma is that a treaty was violated that gave the Five Tribes the land, as long as the waters run, and the grass is green. And that was just the beginning, there were all kinds of promises that were broken.\n\nThe first settlers, some of them really colorful characters, came in with all of these promises of making cities overnight. Oklahoma City was created overnight by a bunch of illegal land pirates, issuing fake certificates of land to people. They were often arrested, some by federal troops.\n\nThe way that the story is told in the present is to make the ugly side of it look like a victory. To make the Boomers and Sooners into heroes, when really they were outlaws. Then there’s the continuing swindle, which is the political class promising that if we just lower taxes and deregulate industry a little bit more, we’re going to be a top 10 state.\n\nWhen the current governor, Kevin Stitt, was elected in 2018, his big campaign promise was that Oklahoma’s going to become a top 10 state during his administration. It’s widely acknowledged by all these indicators that Oklahoma is somewhere in the bottom 10. Well, how do you categorize that? What empirical data are you using? Stitt offered none. He continues to offer no empirical data, just vague promises of the good times that will happen. And it’s like a snake oil salesman. Just fake promises.\n\nBackStory: It seems like you’re telling another other story, too, of the process of myth-making. How the US has told myths about itself, especially with the American West.\n\nCobb: That’s definitely a place where this story links up with a broader story of the American West. Manifest Destiny, and the conquests of the wilderness, overlooking all the different peoples that were there, the violence that it implies, and the continuing injustices that were created by that original trauma.\n\nBut the myths that spring up around oil men in particular are fascinating. There’s some real skullduggery going on that is every bit as fascinating and crazy as a movie like There Will be Blood, or the novel it’s based on. In the end they didn’t need to fictionalize it.\n\nBackStory: It’s incredible how powerful an economic driving force oil has been in Oklahoma’s history.\n\nCobb: The more I researched it, the more I found that you can’t understand Oklahoma’s past and where it went wrong without understanding the oil industry.\n\nMost of the oil in Oklahoma was found on what happened to be part of the allotted Indian Territory. Before it became Oklahoma it was Indian Territory, and the federal government parceled out tracts of land and gave the best tracts to the most well-connected and whitest passing people. That’s river bottoms, black soil. Then they gave the remaining land to the Native peoples, even those who didn’t want an allotment.\n\nThat land happens to be on an oil field called The Cushing Dome. Readers may have heard of Cushing because to this day it is the place where the price of oil is set on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nBackStory: I want to bring up another major idea you have laced throughout the book, which is this question of identity and racial codes. You talk about the “wannabe tribe,” and the complexity of claiming native ancestry. You also share your own personal story, and describe how between the eighties and nineties people didn’t want to be Native American, and then suddenly everybody…\n\nCobb: …wanted to be Native American. I could have written a whole book on that. It’s so tricky and it’s also so current. I remember growing up with that commercial of the crying Indian, Iron Eyes Cody, where he’s canoeing down the stream.\n\nHe sees the pollution and somebody throws a piece of garbage at his feet. The narrator comes on and is like, “Some people have an abiding respect for the beauty that is the United States. Some people don’t.” And then he sheds that tear.\n\nI was writing for an Oklahoma magazine and they asked me to find out more about Iron Eyes Cody. It didn’t take long to figure out that Iron Eyes Cody was a fraud. He was an Italian immigrant from Louisiana who was mistaken for a Native American and then realized if he played his cards correctly, he could leverage that into success in Hollywood.\n\nGrowing up in Oklahoma, the native influence is extremely important. My grandmother’s partner was Choctaw. I just assumed that I was part Native American. I would unthinkingly repeat stories like that. So many people claim very slight Native American ancestry.\n\nMy research brought me to a pretty negative view of that. It’s not an indictment of those people, but the historical context for it is not positive. It’s not something that is innocent.\n\nIt goes back to the swindling of land of the tribes in the South, in the 1820s and 30s, and then later on in Oklahoma. In many cases, when they were allotting lands, if you could claim Native ancestry you could get free land. There are many, many instances of people buying their way onto tribal rolls, or finding some sort of a way of fraudulently getting on there.\n\nThey never had any intent of becoming a part of the community, of going to ceremony, of preserving the language, anything like that. It was purely a way to gain access to the land for fraudulent purposes. And the flip side of that is that many people who were a native “by blood” were kicked off tribal rolls. A lot of people whose ancestry was clearly native were kicked off. And a lot of people who were clearly not native at all were included on there.\n\nSo I certainly don’t claim ancestry anymore. I think a lot of people do so in the way I used to do it, not innocently, but at least they don’t really know what they’re saying. There’s probably a reason they claim that. And it probably had to do with taking part in a fraud.\n\nRussell Cobb is an associate professor in Latin American studies and creative writing at the University of Alberta.

Hamlin\n\nIn her latest book “Free Thinker: Sex, Suffrage, and the Extraordinary Life of Helen Hamilton Gardener,” historian Kimberly A. Hamlin tells the story of an influential and fascinating woman who you likely have never even heard of. Helen Hamilton Gardener dedicated her life to championing women’s rights and pushing back against the sexual double standard. She went toe-to-toe with some of the most prominent scientists and politicians of her day. She published 7 books and many more essays. By the time of her death in 1925, Gardener was the highest-ranking woman in federal government and a symbol of female citizenship.\n\nHamlin examines Gardener’s accomplishments and legacy, but she also uncovers a great secret: up until she was 23, Gardener went by Alice Chenoweth. Already a successful educator, “Alice Chenoweth” was featured prominently in Ohio newspapers which carried the details of her affair with a married man. A “fallen woman,” she changed her name to Helen Hamilton Gardener, moved to New York, and spent the rest of her life fighting the sexual double standard.\n\nBackStory recently spoke with Hamlin about her research on Gardener, the themes of legacy and personal identity, and the considerable amount that this once-forgotten figure has to say about our present day.\n\nBackStory: How did you first come across Helen Hamilton Gardener, and what was about her that interested you?\n\nHamlin: I first met, in quotes, Helen Hamilton Gardener, in the basement of the Perry-Castañeda Library at the University of Texas at Austin when I was working on my dissertation. My dissertation explored how 19th century feminists used science to advance claims for women’s equality.\n\nSo I was sitting in the basement thumbing through pages of old editions of Popular Science Monthly, the popular magazine from the 1870s and 1880s. I don’t know if UT still has these bound copies, but it was kind of fun to leaf through them in a non-digitized way. I could just really see the whole scope of conversation.\n\nAs I was perusing these old volumes, one woman named Helen Hamilton Gardener really stood out to me. She wrote to Popular Science Monthly to challenge the findings of this guy named Dr. William Hammond, who was a pioneering neurologist. He had been the surgeon general for the Union during the Civil War, and then he went on to help found the American Neurological Association and serve as one of its early presidents\n\nSo here’s this top-dog scientist, and here’s Helen Hamilton Gardener, some woman who has never gone to college and no one has ever heard of. And she’s challenging his research in the pages of Popular Science Monthly. So I thought, “Oh my gosh, who is this bold and fearless woman?” And also, she was totally right.\n\nHammond had advanced all these claims about the inferiority of women’s brains. He claimed that he had found 19 distinct ways in which women’s brains were quote / unquote “Naturally inferior to men’s.” Gardener and other women’s rights activists had been reading his research and thinking, “This makes no rational sense.” What are his studies like? This does not ring true.\n\nHammond’s research was mostly anecdotal, what his other male scientists friends had said about women that they encountered. Gardener conducted her own research, and she consulted with other leading neurologists in New York City, where she lived. She really championed what we would consider a more modern approach to science to disapprove Hammond’s claims that women were naturally intellectually inferior.\n\nThis was a huge issue in the 1870s and 1880s, because arguments like Hammond’s were generally used to keep women from higher education. This was when women were first trying to attend college in larger numbers, and people like Hammond were arguing that they should not be able to go to college, much less have professions. So the implications of Hammond’s arguments, as Gardener and others realized, were huge. That’s why she thought it was so important to discredit them.\n\nBackStory: How did this discovery become full biography on Gardener?\n\nHamlin: I wrote about Gardener in my dissertation, and then in my first book I wrote about her interest in brain science and her later contributions. She donated her brain to science when she died in 1925 to prove the intellectual equality of women.\n\nBut something about her just stuck with me. She was so interesting. And I felt like through her, you could really see the whole of the 19th century women’s rights movement. She’s like the Forrest Gump of the women’s rights movement. She’s at all the things, she’s friends with all the people.\n\nI came to see that you could really tell this much larger story. Everywhere I looked for her, I found her. Early on in my research I said, “Gosh, I wonder if she was involved in the 1913 suffrage parade in Washington DC, the huge women’s march that suffragist Alice Paul planned to coincide with the first inauguration of Woodrow Wilson.”\n\nI went to the archives and, lo and behold, who was Alice Paul’s right-hand woman in their makeshift office in DC every day? Helen Hamilton Gardener. Who was the press secretary for the campaign? Helen Hamilton Gardener. Who got every permission that they needed to march down Pennsylvania Avenue? Helen Hamilton Gardener. She plays a pivotal role in this marquee women’s suffrage event.\n\nAnd that’s just one example of places where I thought, “I wonder if she’s there?” And then not only is she there, she’s totally responsible for many of the key elements of that event.\n\nBackStory: How did you go about recreating Gardener, especially given that she went through a major identity change? Was there a chance that you just weren’t going to uncover the person she was before she became Gardener?\n\nHamlin: In Gardener’s will, she decrees that her executors burn her correspondence or destroy it in some other way. I think that’s because she had had a scandalous early life and a big affair. She didn’t leave behind a set of traditional papers. Mostly it was kind of a hunting and pecking exercise to trace her comings and goings.\n\nBecause of this affair and the resulting sex scandal she had in her early twenties, she changed her name. I loved this project because I did a lot of traditional historical research, and then a lot of sleuthing, which was the really fun part.\n\nOne thing that made this book possible is the digitization of small local newspapers. I found a lot of details about Gardener’s early life, including the affair that she had in Ohio, through the digitization of small local Ohio newspapers. It would have been impossible to go to every county in Ohio and physically look through old newspapers, but because they had been digitized, I could find her.\n\nAnother source that was really helpful in finding her in these early years, was this Freethought periodical called Truth Seeker, which has been posted online and digitized and you can search it. In Truth Seeker, Gardener wrote a lot of entries and essays for Truth Seeker, but they also loved her, so they frequently profiled her comings and goings. That was another important avenue to trace her early years.\n\nBackStory: It is fascinating how her affair was litigated in public in these newspapers.\n\nHamlin: Exactly. She’s this 23-year-old woman with hardly any family to support her. She has nothing really to fall back on. Yet she has this strength in herself to say, “You know what, no. I’m not going to just sneak away in shame over this. I’m going to question, why are women held to such a different standard in terms of sex? Why is a woman’s virginity considered her most valuable asset?”\n\nShe moves to New York City, changes her name and reinvents. And I just love that about her.\n\nBackStory: That brings up another point, in how clearly you are able to link Gardener’s personal experiences with the causes that she fought for. This is especially interesting considering her lack of awareness about racial issues, especially as they concern women’s freedom and equality.\n\nHamlin: I think that’s exactly right. A pro and a con of Gardner’s activism, is that it was very much rooted in her personal experience.\n\nIt’s admirable to think that you can turn your personal struggles into political movements and social change. That’s what she did in terms of the sexual double-standard and her work to raise the age of sexual consent.\n\nBut then a con of drawing so closely on her personal experience, is thinking about herself as a stand-in for all women. This really blinded her to the experiences of African-American women and limited her ability to challenge the racist ideologies of her day.\n\nGardener was such an iconoclast. She had no fear calling out the church for its misogyny, or writing controversial articles about sex. But even she could not see her way through racism.\n\nI think that’s in large part due to her upbringing and her experiences during the Civil War. I have this sense that because Gardener’s family had sacrificed so much during the Civil War, and to end slavery, that she felt this somehow absolved her from having to do anything more.\n\nIt is an unfortunate part of her legacy, but one that I think we really need to grapple with in terms of our larger understanding about voting rights and the history of women’s rights.\n\nBackStory: I want to ask about this idea of legacy and historical memory, and how that ties in with the individual. Gardener was obviously very aware of her legacy. In your book, you also explain how the Suffragists held their specific coalition and movement to stand for women’s suffrage overall.\n\nHamlin: I have a lot of thoughts on that, and I’ve published some shorter pieces about it. Most recently, in a Washington Post op-ed called “The Problem With Women’s History Month in 2020,” I argue that the suffragists were in many ways the nation’s first historians of women.\n\nThey were the first to compile and write about the contributions of women because they thought it helped advance their claims for citizenship. And they were the first to assemble archives for women, because they realized the importance of documenting women’s contributions to American life, not just for history, but also for politics.\n\nFor example, in 1909 the National American Women’s Suffrage Association had a committee, and their charge was to investigate all the history and civics textbooks in America, to assess how women were represented. At the annual convention, the committee chair reported that history and civics textbooks basically tell the story that the world was made by, and for, men.\n\nI would say that even though many tremendous gains have been made in history textbooks over the past several decades, that even though there’ve been generations of pioneering historians of women, our national narratives still are basically the story of old great white men.\n\nIn 2017, the National Women’s History Museum conducted a comprehensive survey of all history textbooks to see how women were represented. They found that women are still sidebarred from the larger stories of American national life.\n\nWe have a long way to go. Like the suffragists said, the stories we tell about our past shape what we think is possible in the present and in the future. It’s really important that we tell new stories and different stories about our past if we want to see change in the future.\n\nBackStory: It’s interesting, as well as disheartening, how relevant Gardener and her beliefs are today.\n\nHamlin: I think Gardener is really a suffragist for the Me Too era, because her life, work and writing show so clearly the links between women’s political and bodily autonomy. So while Gardener didn’t advocate for birth control or anything – that would have been a little too radical even for her in her day – she wanted the world to recognize that women were “self-respecting human units with brains and bodies sacredly their own.”\n\nThat was really the core of her life’s mission. To see that there was a place for autonomous women who could make their own money, who could behave as they wanted to in private and in public, and participate equally in politics. I think a testament to that is, when Gardener died in 1925, she was the highest ranking woman in federal government and a national symbol of what it meant for women to be full citizens.\n\nA recipient of the NEH Public Scholar Award, Kimberly A.

The phrase often brings to mind population displacement, the destruction of historic neighborhoods, and a general failure of the public sphere. But this is far from the whole story.\n\nLizabeth Cohen’s book “Saving America’s Cities: Ed Logue and the Struggle to Renew Urban America in the Suburban Age” examines the history of urban renewal in the decades following World War II through the career of influential urban planner Ed Logue. The evolution of Logue’s work neatly follows the trajectory of urban policy over this time, tracing the changing balance between public government programs and private interests. What emerges is a story about the nature of American democracy, and the relationship of different levels of government to each other and to their communities. Ultimately, Cohen illuminates not only how America’s cities became what they are today, but also what they could become in the future.\n\nBackStory recently spoke with Lizabeth Cohen about “Saving America’s Cities,” which was just announced as a winner of the 2020 Bancroft Prize in American History and Diplomacy.\n\nBackStory: How did you decide on Ed Logue as the subject for this book? What were some advantages of telling this history through an individual, and did you face any major limitations from this approach?\n\nCohen: I knew that I wanted to investigate the fate of post-World War II American cities as they faced the explosion of suburbanization. My previous books (Making a New Deal and A Consumers’ Republic) had both been set in cities, the former focused on Chicago, the latter in the metropolitan New York area, particularly Northern New Jersey. But the city itself was not the problematic, the real subject of inquiry, in those books. Moreover, other historians, including me in A Consumers’ Republic, had written extensively on how the federal government incentivized the boom in postwar suburbia through mortgage lending and highway building. But little attention had been paid to how cities coped with the huge exit of residents, employers, and capital more broadly from the 1940s onward. Most American cities were truly in trouble after a decade of depression followed by the deprivations of wartime. I also wanted to make sure that I was attentive to the changing physical built environment as postwar cities met these challenges.\n\nMy next question was how to go about framing this book. My previous work had been social history, where I investigated the life experiences of various groups of ordinary Americans—first- and second-generation immigrants, workers, middle-class homeowners and consumers, African Americans who had had recently moved from the South to the North, and so forth. For this new book, I felt it was more appropriate to put an individual with great influence at the center of my story, while still being attentive to the social identities that matter so much to social historians, such as class, gender, race, ethnicity, profession and the like. A biographical focus, I hoped, might also appeal to general readers, making my book more accessible. So I searched for a protagonist whose life and work would allow me to tell two intertwined stories: how both a person and a nation went about trying to revitalize American cities over a substantial period of time.\n\nI knew about Ed Logue from a course I had taught at Harvard on Boston’s history, as he was generally credited with turning around a deteriorating city and moving it towards a “New Boston.” What I learned over time convinced me that Logue was an ideal vehicle for my book. Logue had a long, influential career working in many cities–New Haven in the 1950s, Boston in the 1960s, New York State in the 1970s, and the South Bronx in the 1980s. (He died in 2000.) Over that half-century, Logue responded to shifts in government policies towards cities as well as lessons he learned on the job. It helped me as well that he had left a huge cache of papers at his alma mater of Yale. Over his lifetime, Logue had given many interviews, so although he was no longer living, I would still “hear his voice.” Also, many of his colleagues and family members were still alive, and were very willing and eager to talk to me. There was even a website, “The Friends of Edward J. Logue.” So I began my research in voluminous archives and printed sources and undertook almost one hundred interviews with people who had known and worked with Ed Logue.\n\nThe biggest challenge I faced in putting Logue at the center of my book was figuring out what aspects of his life and career were relevant to my historical project to understand the evolution of postwar cities and what were not. I decided that I would only discuss aspects of his life that had a bearing on his public work. I made occasional exceptions to keep the reader interested and informed, but generally this was a book about a powerful person’s public career, not his private life. Another difficulty was calibrating my own relationship to my subject. I tried very hard to treat Logue and his work with even handedness, to acknowledge the costs and achievements of urban renewal, as it was often called. And I wanted to convey that Logue was a complicated figure who was loved and admired by some and greatly resented and feared by others. Sometimes I would catch myself becoming too empathetic and need to pull back. Other times I felt I was being too tough on Logue, applying today’s knowledge and expectations ahistorically to him at an earlier moment in time. Finally, I worried that the many people still around who knew Logue or worked in related fields might contradict my interpretation. That is less of a problem when you write about an earlier period of history, or when your subject is a broad social group. In the end, however, I have been challenged very little by Logue’s colleagues. Most of them, in fact, are happy to see the work that he and they did be treated seriously as history.\n\nBackStory: Ed Logue’s career saw a shift in the balance of the roles of the expert and the community in urban renewal projects. What does this trajectory tell us about the nature of democracy and role of government in the 20th century?\n\nCohen: This question identifies an important theme of Saving America’s Cities, a shift in how communities responded to urban renewal and what urban redevelopers like Ed Logue had to adjust to in carrying out their projects. I argue that in the first phase of urban renewal during the 1950s—in New Haven for Logue but in many cities all over the country—community consultation operated as what I call “pluralist democracy,” a term I borrowed from a classic study of New Haven’s urban renewal by Yale political scientist Robert Dahl entitled Who Governs? Leaders of established organizations and interest groups were tapped to advise urban renewers but there was very little broad, grassroots participation. Rather, Logue considered himself and his staff to be experts who would carry on in the tradition of FDR’s New Deal and bring the resources and talent of the federal government to bear on the next problem to solve—failing cities.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, in New Haven, Boston, and elsewhere, neighborhoods had learned to be much less accepting and most importantly, how to negotiate with city redevelopment agencies and planners to get more of what they wanted, such as more subsidized housing. I label that new era one of “participatory democracy.” In Boston, those skills would help citizens defeat two major highway projects in the 1970s, the Southwest Expressway and the Inner Belt.\n\nI watch how over the course of his career Logue learned to work within an urban redevelopment regime where he must engage more and more with communities. That partnering did not come easily to Logue, but by his work in the South Bronx in the 1980s he had come to recognize how crucial it was to any success. There he collaborated closely with community planning boards and local CDCs on projects to build much needed affordable housing.\n\nAt the end of the book I acknowledge the necessity of engaging communities in the important decisions that will affect them. But I also raise some concerns about how we can do that while also avoiding excessive NIMBYism or planning that is so narrowly defined by neighborhood that the future of the city as a whole is not adequately considered.\n\nBackStory: One thing that I found fascinating about the book is how it illustrated a cross-section of different levels of government, and how these levels interacted in complex ways over the second half of the 20th century. Was the process of urban renewal a driving factor in the reshaping of these relationships, or merely a reflection of these changes?\n\nCohen: That’s a very interesting question. Logue had many opportunities over his career to work at the federal level—for Senator Hubert Humphrey, for what became the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and more—but he always chose other opportunities at the municipal and state levels where he felt he could have more direct impact. At the same time, he felt the federal government’s resources were absolutely necessary to revitalize struggling cities and build subsidized housing. In fact, he watched in dismay as those federal dollars declined, first with the costs of the Vietnam War under President Lyndon Johnson and then with an ideological shift, initiated by President Richard Nixon, away from federal programs towards his “New Federalism.” Ronald Reagan would take it all a big step further and argue that the private sector, not the public realm, should be solving these urban problems.\n\nLogue’s major engagement with state government was his seven-year stint as President of the powerful New York State Urban Development Corporation (UDC). Readers of the book watch as this idealistic organization falls apart for many reasons. But while it lasted, the UDC marked a significant effort on Logue’s part to search for alternatives to fading federal financing of what he felt were greatly needed interventions to provide housing and support cities more generally.\n\nIn terms of whether urban renewal led or was swept up in these shifts from federal to lower levels of government and from the public to private sector, I would say that transformation took place in many policy areas but that housing and urban projects were particularly affected because there were alternatives imaginable in this realm, where there weren’t always in others.\n\nBackStory: Your book wrestles with many forces that have shaped the role and power of the federal government, and the limitations of private interests in shaping the public sphere. What provoked your exploration of these questions?\n\nCohen: Another of my motives for writing this book that I should mention here was my alarm at the current nationwide crisis in affordable housing and the deterioration of so much urban infrastructure throughout the country. I felt that the failure over many decades to invest public resources in these basic social needs required further investigation. I was also affected by watching how the nation rebuilt after the catastrophe of Katrina and the foreclosure crisis of the Great Recession. Private sector interests seized opportunities and further undermined how people perceived the effectiveness and importance of government. I am watching closely how the nation deals with the COVID-19 pandemic and worry greatly that we will see further eroding of the public sector’s capacity and authority. And we should stay alert to possible corruption that might accompany the greater empowerment of the private sector to deal with the crisis.\n\nBackStory: You describe how both American conservatives and progressives cast the history of federal urban development as an “abject failure.” What has motivated this characterization? Does it tell us anything about how history is actually created and interpreted?\n\nCohen: It had become accepted wisdom on all political fronts that everything about the urban renewal era was bad. I don’t dispute that there is much truth in that assertion. I show very clearly that almost all efforts undertaken in the 1950s were deeply flawed. But I try to make the case that urban renewal was not one unshifting disaster over many decades that should be fully written off. Rather, I show that urban redevelopers like Logue evolved over time, learned from their mistakes, and in some cases even promoted some progressive goals. Logue, for example, was deeply committed to creating mixed-income, mixed-race, and mixed age communities, aspirations we still hold today. And he worked hard to make the case that whole metropolitan areas need to be involved in solving the housing and other problems facing low-income residents of cities. For example, readers follow Logue’s ultimately failed effort at the UDC to build modest amounts of what he called “Fair Share Housing” in nine well-off Westchester County towns.\n\nWhen ideologically-based assumptions that are under-investigated prevail, important goals and even successes can easily get forgotten. We “throw the baby out with the bathwater,” so to speak. By assuming that there was nothing redeemable about the federal government playing a significant role in revitalizing cities, particularly financially, we abandon the opportunity to fight for that possibility once again. I despair at the current moment where cities find themselves almost totally dependent on squeezing resources out of private developers to solve the crisis of affordable housing and much more. And cities compete with each other to win an Amazon or GE headquarters and investment dollars, at the cost of sacrificing future tax revenues and putting more uncompensated burdens on already shaky services. Creating a more nuanced history of a controversial subject like urban renewal not only makes for a more accurate historical record, but it can provide a more useable past and suggest alternatives for the future that we might not otherwise have considered. In a capitalist society like ours, the private sector will always play a significant role. It did in the heyday of federal urban renewal and it certainly does today. But it matters greatly which sector—public or private—is in the driver’s seat. Logue believed deeply that it was the responsibility of government to represent the public interest and, flaws and all, he fought to make it so for over half a century.\n\nLizabeth Cohen is the Howard Mumford Jones Professor of American Studies at Harvard University and the former dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.

Movies, music, award shows, and much much more, help us understand our world, and even have the potential to influence it. This interplay between culture and politics is nothing new, even if the lexicon has changed. That is why Jonathan Rosenberg’s book, Dangerous Melodies: Classical Music in America from the Great War through the Cold War, is such an original and necessary look at the United States on the political world stage.\n\nTrained as a classical musician and educated as a historian, Rosenberg looks back at a time when classical music dominated much of the United State’s cultural discourse. Dangerous Melodies traces the history of classical music through both World Wars and well into the Cold War. In doing so, the book uncovers some important truths about the nature of political life in 20th century America.\n\nRecently, BackStory had the opportunity to speak with Jonathan Rosenberg. The conversation below has been edited for clarity.\n\nBackStory: What drew you to this approach of viewing the 20th century through the lens of classical music?\n\nRosenberg: Classical music has been a very important part of my life since I was quite young, and later, I pursued it professionally. After a number of years in music I went into academia and studied 20th century U.S. history. With this book, I wanted to see if there was a way I could pursue my love of classical music and meld that to my deep interest in history. I didn’t want to write about American composers or compositions; instead I wanted to explore the experience of classical music in the United States and see how that interacted with world affairs.\n\nI began by scanning the 20th century by reading many decades of music journals and newspaper accounts, which gave me a sense as to the contours of the period. I began to see points of intersection between what was happening in the world of classical music in the United States and what was going on in the wider world. Over time, I recognized that this connection – this link – could be fashioned into a book that looked at the relationship between the classical music community in the United States and momentous affairs that were unfolding overseas.\n\nWorld War I, the emergence of fascism in Italy and Germany between the world wars, World War II, and finally the Cold War were obviously enormously significant events in the history of the 20th century, and each had a powerful impact on the world of classical music. I then dug down more deeply into each of these developments in an effort to understand how they intersected in a meaningful way with the classical music world in America. What I began to grasp was that this classical music story, as it were, could be used as a lens through which to look at the way America engaged the world.\n\nAnd what I saw in studying the world of classical music was something that’s quite important in the history of 20th century America aside and apart from music, that is, America’s increasing engagement with the world, and growing sense of insecurity or unease resulting from developments that were unfolding across the world.\n\nBackStory: Reading the book, I felt so much sympathy for a figure like Shostakovich trying to navigate these events and insecurity.\n\nRosenberg: As a musician I knew Shostakovich’s music, I’d listened to it and played some of the symphonies. But what really came to interest me, and what the book shows, is that the way the way Shostakovich was perceived in the United States reflected, in a certain sense, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union itself.\n\nWhen the Shostakovich’s 7th Symphony received its American premiere in July of 1942 it became a huge national story across the United States. Shostakovich was lionized as a hero because he had written the piece in Leningrad when the city was under siege by the German army.\n\nShostakovich became a very, very important figure in the United States. He was discussed, people were playing the piece, there were countless newspaper and magazine stories about him. At that moment, of course, the United States was fighting World War II, and it was important to fortify the relationship between Washington and Moscow. So he became this heroic figure, an artist portrayed in heroic terms.\n\nSeven years later, in 1949, Shostakovich visited the United States for the first time. He came to the Waldorf Hotel in New York for a peace conference which was organized by elements of the left of the United States, Europe, and to some extent, the Soviet Union.\n\nShostakovich was the most sought after and celebrated figure at the peace conference. He delivered a highly political speech, written for him by Soviet authorities, in which he excoriated the United States for its militarism, for causing the world to spin out of control in terms of East-West relations. Seven years after he had been held up as this heroic figure, he was now seen as a tool of the Soviet government, “an obedient instrument of the state.”\n\nIn Shostakovich’s experience here in the United States, one can see what had happened to the U.S.-Soviet relationship, which went from this crucial, if somewhat uncomfortable, alliance during World War II, to the deepening gloom of the Cold War in the late forties.\n\nBackStory: Toward the end of the book, you write about how the United States’ attempts to impact world events through classical music didn’t pan out to much of anything. Did you find any conclusions about the relationship between politics and culture, and how they might have any power to influence each other?\n\nRosenberg: The book ends with the so-called Cold War tours, with the U.S. government sending American symphony orchestras across the world, particularly behind the Iron Curtain, to propagandize the American system.\n\nI conclude that ultimately the Cold War tours were not a particularly effective way to do that. In the end, classical music was not capable of transforming the world. It couldn’t transform international relations. It couldn’t make world politics more humane or cooperative as some hoped it might. In that sense, classical music had its limits.\n\nAs far as the relationship between politics and culture is concerned, the fact that classical music did not have this transformative effect does not minimize the significance of the entanglement between music and politics. They are deeply entangled, deeply enmeshed, in each other. What struck me in writing the book was how over the course of the 20th century, people were acutely conscious of the political implications of music.\n\nYou have thousands of people demonstrating against the performance of German music in New York City in the aftermath of World War I. While those people might not have been able to provide a finely crafted explanation about the relationship between culture and politics or music and politics, that they were out on the street demonstrating, often violently, about the performance of German opera, is a clear illustration that culture and politics are linked. That same relationship was evident on any number of occasions.\n\nOne of the central points I do make in the book is that, while classical music didn’t help America overcome some of the challenges it faced on the world stage, it did help people understand those challenges. It helped people grapple with questions of war and peace, patriotism, democracy, tyranny, and oppression. So while I’m not going to say that people’s reaction to music helped America win World War I, it did help Americans reflect upon and understand what was at stake in the war.\n\nBecause people imbued music with political and ideological meaning, it helped them understand some of the great questions of the 20th century. Therein lies the importance of music and its relationship with world politics. It did not solve problems, but it helped people begin to try to understand a variety of challenges.\n\nBackStory: These conversations about the power and influence of classical music were being had at the time as well. What did this debate look like?\n\nRosenberg: The other thing that I came to see as I did this research was this very interesting debate between these two groups that I call the musical nationalists and the musical universalists.\n\nDuring in the 1930s, for example, when Wilhelm Furtwängler was invited to come and conduct the New York Philharmonic to replace Toscanini, there were those who thought it was an absolutely abhorrent idea. They believed he was an unsavory character, someone who should not come to the United States because he was seen as a tool of the Hitler regime. This was in the thirties. Then there were those who said, in fact, we must keep music and politics separate. Furtwängler should be allowed to come to the United States. He’s a great musician. He’s a great conductor. We want him here. These people believed the two things, i.e., music and politics, were distinct and should be kept apart.\n\nThose sorts of debates reflect how meaningful classical music was in the life of the country. People were deeply committed to their respective positions, which further heightened the meaningfulness of classical music in American society.\n\nUltimately, one of the stories of the book is that classical music mattered a great deal over the course of the 20th century in a way that it does not matter anymore. It became entangled in these enormously consequential international events.\n\nSo when we think of a country being riveted by the performance of the Shostakovich 7th Symphony in World War II, that is a world that has disappeared. In that sense the book captures a kind of lost world, where classical music was once deeply meaningful, precisely because it became entangled in world politics.\n\nAgain, that’s a world that no longer exists, as far as I can tell, in the United States. You’re not going to have millions tuning into the premiere of a classical piece, or thousands demonstrating on the streets against performances of certain types of music. It’s unimaginable now. One of the things that I think is striking, and I’ve given lots of talks on the book in various places, and one of the things people find absolutely remarkable is how much classical music mattered to people in an earlier time. That is one of the things I was not particularly aware of when I began this project several years ago. But by the end of it, I became keenly aware of how important the music once was in the life of the country.\n\nJonathan Rosenberg, professor of twentieth-century history at Hunter College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, is author of How Far the Promised Land?: World Affairs and the American Civil Rights Movement from the First World War to Vietnam, and coauthor of Kennedy, Johnson, and the Quest for Justice: The Civil Rights Tapes. He lives in Croton-on-Hudson, New York.\n\nAn Interview with Nicholas Buccola\n\nOn February 18, 1965, two leading voices in American politics took the stage at Cambridge University to debate the question: “Is the American Dream at the expense of the American negro?” On on side of the debate was James Baldwin, the prolific American writer and documenter of the ongoing civil rights movement. On the other side was William F. Buckley, another towering literary figure and a founder of the modern American conservative movement.\n\nBaldwin and Buckley, born a year apart in 1924 and 1925 respectively, were near-exact contemporaries representing divergent world views. Their 1965 debate creates a framework for issues of race, class, and citizenship that came to a head at that time and continue to effect us today. This is where Nicholas Buccola picks up in his new book, “The Fire is Upon Us: James Baldwin, William F. Buckley Jr., and the Debate Over Race in America.”\n\nBy looking at the Cambridge debate and lives and work of Baldwin and Buckley leading up to it, Buccola tells a dramatic and relevant intellectual history of the early-to-mid 20th century. Through this approach, he asks important questions about the nature of conservatism, progressivism, and what it really means to be a responsible citizen of the United States. Recently, BackStory had the opportunity to speak with Nicholas Buccola.\n\nBackStory: How did you come across this topic for the book? What came first, the Baldwin-Buckley debate, or the two movements represented in that debate?\n\nBuccola: I was invited to write an essay on Baldwin several years ago for a book called The Political Companion to James Baldwin. And as I started getting to know Baldwin in a serious way, I came across the BBC recording of the debate with Buckley on YouTube. I was fascinated by this moment with these two figures that came from such radically different backgrounds, on this international stage at the high tide of the civil rights movement. The drama of the moment really pulled me in.\n\nAs I reconstructed that story, I realized pretty quickly that there’s a much larger story to tell. The debate was a climactic chapter, but the story that I really wanted to tell was of Baldwin and Buckley, born a year apart, coming of age intellectually at almost the exact same moment in the late ’40s, early ’50s, and chronicling and shaping the history of these two movements, respectively.\n\nBackStory: You describe how Baldwin provides a template for how to think about the world or how to be in the world, rather than representing any particular ideology.\n\nBuccola: That’s right. Buckley clearly had these aspirations to be a founding father of a movement. He was very strategic in a lot of the choices he made, and I go into a lot of depth about them in the book, in terms of questions of race and civil rights.\n\nBaldwin’s conception of himself is always primarily as an artist. He would use this term “witness” – he was there to write it all down. He had this different role to play in the struggle, compared to Malcolm or Martin or Medgar Evers. He was in a sense, unconventional, but he was a philosopher. He was a kind of moral psychologist. He really wanted to try to understand what makes human beings tick, and try to understand what prevents us from achieving liberation. That’s one of the reasons Baldwin was so resistant to labels and categorization. He didn’t like to be limited.\n\nBackStory: It’s fascinating how you step back to both of these men’s formative childhood experiences that shaped their world views. It has so much to say about how people come to hold the views that they do, how they might change them, and how they might evolve.\n\nBuccola: I wrote the chapter on their childhoods later in the process of writing the book. The first major substantive chapter I wrote was the chapter on the late ’40s, early ’50s when Baldwin and Buckley are both arriving on the intellectual scene. But although the biography of each man had been studied in a lot of depth, there was something missing in terms of the foundation of the book.\n\nBaldwin uses this phrase “system of reality” a lot, including in the Cambridge debate. We have to understand an individual’s system of reality before we can really have a conversation about morality and politics. I think part of what makes up the foundation of our system of reality is our upbringing and our childhood experiences and what we’re taught by our parents and our teachers and so on.\n\nIt’s not that the childhood of William F. Buckley determined the man he would become. I’m not claiming these experiences determined their views, but they certainly shaped them in important ways. We can trace those and find evidence to support the idea that maybe this particular thing that Buckley thought about race, you can see it reflected in his later views in a different form. I tried to have a good dose of humility as I made these sorts of claims, but one of Baldwin’s insights is to take that sort of thing seriously, and I tried to do that in the book.\n\nBackStory: What does this book have to tell us about the purpose of debate in society?\n\nBuccola: There’s this question of how do we engage, how do we have a meaningful exchange of ideas? One of the tragedies of the story that I tell in the book is that Baldwin and Buckley never really had a serious exchange of ideas. I argue various reasons why I think that was the case. Baldwin did want to have serious exchanges of ideas with people who had different views from him. He seemed to really take that seriously. He said at various points in his life that he preferred engaging with people who disagreed with him, as opposed to people who had bland views and couldn’t really say what they thought.\n\nBaldwin really calls for a kind of radical candor in terms of the question of how we debate or how we have meaningful exchanges with one another. He calls for an attentiveness to careful listening and trying to understand how someone that we’re having a conversation with could possibly view the world the way that they do. Baldwin absolutely thinks we have a responsibility to point out ways in which their world views undermine justice or undermine human dignity.\n\nBuckley hosted Firing Line for 33 years, and in many ways, at least in the early years of that show, provided one of the few platforms for radical voices in American and international politics. I talked to a lot of people as I worked on the book who, although they may have loathed Buckley’s politics, appreciated a role that he played in intellectual life in at least having people like Noam Chomsky, Allen Ginsberg and Huey Newton on his program. That was something that was significant in terms of American political culture, and it’s not something we see very much anymore at all.\n\nBackStory: At one point, you distill the fundamental disagreement between Baldwin and Buckley in a way that has a lot to say about ongoing differences between the conservative and progressive movements. You write, “For Buckley, love of country was displayed by one’s gratitude for it, despite its flaws. For Baldwin, one’s love for the country was revealed by one’s willingness to ‘criticize her perpetually.’”\n\nBuccola: Buckley really refused to take Baldwin seriously. He treated him as an adversary who needed to be defeated, not as somebody who might have something to teach him. Buckley calls Baldwin the number one America hater, he refuses to consider the possibility that maybe Baldwin does have a kind of love for the country. Of course, love is a central idea in Baldwin’s philosophy. It would have been really interesting if Buckley had actually taken that idea of love seriously.\n\nToward the end of his life, Buckley writes a book on gratitude. He’s clearly animated by a gratitude for the affluence that his father and his mother were able to achieve in the country, and feels like one of his roles is to defend the system that made that affluence possible.\n\nSo you can understand why William F. Buckley came to view the country and the meaning of patriotism the way he did. But Baldwin is there to point out to Buckley the ways in which his privilege has allowed him to conceive of patriotism in this way. His privilege has allowed him to build this barricade against anybody who could possibly say anything critical of the country.\n\nOne of the things that’s really powerful about Baldwin is that he doesn’t let anybody off the hook. He’s not just going after the William F. Buckleys of the world, he’s calling on all of us to realize the ways in which we are complicit in the imperfections of our country and the world.\n\nNicholas Buccola is the author of The Political Thought of Frederick Douglass and the editor of The Essential Douglass and Abraham Lincoln and Liberal Democracy.

Bowers took a similar stand on a streetcar in Charleston, South Carolina. Her 1867 protest would eventually lead to the desegregation of the city’s streetcars that same year.\n\nThis was no isolated incident, either. Elements of the Civil Rights Movement of the mid-20th century can be traced at least as far back as Reconstruction. The post-Civil War desegregation movements in Charleston and New Orleans stand out as especially important both for the cause itself, and for our understanding of its roots.\n\nIn The Accident of Color, Daniel Brook examines 19th-century New Orleans and Charleston, exploring these cities’ cosmopolitan residents who eluded the ubiquitous binary racial categories observed in the rest of the U.S.\n\nDaniel Brook is November’s featured author for the BookStory book club. We recently spoke with Brook about his book and the construction of race in America.\n\nBackStory: What drove you to write this book, and how did you come across Charleston and New Orleans as these unique areas to focus on?\n\nBrook: It started as JSTOR research gone awry. I moved to New Orleans in 2011 and decided to educate myself on its history. I went to JSTOR and put in the terms “New Orleans” and “school desegregation.” I came up with over 100 hits. 99 of them were about the 1960s, and one of them was about the 1870s.\n\nThere was an article about the desegregation of the New Orleans public schools at the height of Reconstruction, which is something I did not know had even occurred. I stumbled across the desegregation of the University of South Carolina in the same period, and kept reading around streetcar systems, police forces, etc.\n\nI thought that I should read a book about this topic, so I went to the libraries and bookstores. I couldn’t find one. I decided I would write one.\n\nTime and again I kept coming back to Charleston and New Orleans where you saw the most progress in terms of civil rights, not just in the South but in America in this period. It eventually became clear that this progress was rooted in their having large communities of openly mixed-race free people of color before the Civil War.\n\nAs I moved into the project more deeply, I realized that this biracial identity, this belated adoption of the Anglo American idea of a black/white binary, was really central. As Americans, we often think that since slavery was so terrible, segregation was a kind of inevitable, awful consequence of it. But actually, America is the only New World society that imposed segregation after emancipation. Race is incredibly complicated in all these uniquely American ways that we typically don’t think about. At some level the book is about provoking these questions.\n\nBackStory: You write about the enforcement of New York City’s street car system, how people of color could ride it up to certain streets but not take it down past others. Segregation was enforced on a very local and personal level.\n\nBrook: The system is fragmented in the Antebellum period in many cities, including in New York. Just about every city in that period had a transit system run by private companies that were given a monopoly on different routes. One company built the Sixth Avenue street car and another company built the Third Avenue street car, and then different civil rights legal challenges to the system were resolved in different ways. Certain companies ended up with court orders that they had to be integrated and others did not. So you had this patchwork system where African American riders can take any street car on Sixth Avenue, but only a segregated street car on Third.\n\nEach state had different definitions of what a white person is and what a black person is, based on how many grandparents or great grandparents are of African descent. So to decide which car people go to, streetcar drivers were essentially making snap judgements, based on appearance, about the ethnicity of someone’s great grandparent who was long dead.\n\nAs Americans we often think of race as this obvious and knowable fact, but it had to be created in this period.\n\nBackStory: You talk about how Plessy v. Ferguson essentially argued against the idea of Americans having distinct races. Then Brown v. Board of Education, while it’s cast as overturning Plessy, really addressed a less radical idea, which is that we’re separate races but should be treated equal. I wonder if that was a missed opportunity to properly portray the history of Jim Crow and Reconstruction.\n\nBrook: I was shocked and amazed when I actually read the legal arguments of the various attorneys in the Plessy case. It’s not as all the way it’s presented to us in school.\n\nWe’re taught that the Supreme Court decided that if the separate segregated car was ostensibly equal, then a company in the state could force a black man to ride in the Jim Crow car.\n\nThat’s such an over-simplification of the case as to be almost inaccurate. Homer Plessy was chosen for this case because his race under a black/white binary was indeterminate. He was openly mixed race. He’d never been enslaved. He was, according to the African American paper in New Orleans, “as white as the average white Southerner.” The Justice wrote in his decision that he himself can’t decide what race Homer Plessy belongs to by looking at him or by ancestry, and he understands that different states are going to categorize him differently based on ancestry.\n\nSome states will categorize him as a white man and some states will categorize him as a person of color, and each state is free to make that determination. On an interstate train, they can move him back and forth. He could be a black in Louisiana and a white man in Texas, and then a black man again in Arizona.\n\nThe Plessy case was really an attempt to challenge the notion of distinct races and that, sadly, has been lost. By the time the 1960’s civil rights movement happened, you’d had generations under Jim Crow. The one–drop rule of blackness had become more and more the law of the land.\n\nBackStory: It’s interesting how this contextualizes figures that are commonly known in schools, like Ruby Bridges with school integration or Rosa Parks and bus integration. They were a part of this long history of resistance.\n\nBrook: Even in the darkest days of Jim Crow, there’s always resistance. It’s also about who’s been remembered in history, and who’s been expunged.\n\nThere’s a character in the book, Mary P. Bowers, whose protest on the Charleston street cars in 1867 is almost eerily reminiscent of Rosa Parks’ protest on the Montgomery bus system in the 1950’s. Just like Rosa Parks she was too tired from a long days work to move to the seat for colored people. Of course, this is a woman who was taking a seat to make a stand to try to desegregate the line, which she successfully did in 1867 in Charleston.\n\nAt the very end of the book there is a long excerpt from “Lemon Swamp and Other Places” byMamie Garvin Fields and Karen Fields. Mamie Fields is the grandmother of Karen and Barbara Fields, who co-wrote “Racecraft: The Soul of Inequality in American Life.” The excerpt describes this resistance game from when the streetcars of Charleston were officially resegregated around 1912.\n\nIn Charleston slang terms, a “Black Negro” was someone who identified as African–American and had dark skin, and a “White Negro” was someone who identified as an African–American and had light skin. A pair of teenage girls—one White Negro, one Black Negro—would board and sit right in the middle. Blacks were supposed to board from the back and whites from the front. As the white passengers board they get angrier and angrier.\n\nFinally, the streetcar conductor yells at the girls to sit the way they’re supposed to. So they get up and walk to the very back row and sit down together, the White Negro and Black Negro girls. The colored passengers in the black section start laughing, and the white section is embarrassed that they’re enforcing this law that’s patently absurd.\n\nThat’s the extent of the passive resistance that two teenage girls can safely get away with in Charleston South Carolina at the height of segregation in the early 20th century. But even then, they’re not only resisting segregation but also needling at this concept of race and how ill–fitting it is.\n\nBackStory: Has writing this book shifted your perspective on these issues?\n\nBrook: Writing this book as a nonacademic and as a non–African–American, I’ve been so heartened talking to audiences and readers about it. The actual conversations I’m hearing in different places in America are much more sensitive, open, compassionate and honest than what I assumed from following these issues in the media. The idea that Americans can’t speak about these things in a helpful or useful or compassionate way has not been borne out by my experience. I’ve really been feeling a lot more optimistic, even in this hard time happening around the country, talking about this with readers.\n\nBackStory: Finally, we have a question from a BookStory reader: “Do you think that anything would have been different had Abraham Lincoln not been assassinated? Seems like the events that caused the progress to be lost and Jim Crow laws to exist happened well after Lincoln would have finished his second term, but still curious about what might have been. I’m sure it’s hard to speculate.”\n\nBrook: Lincoln’s views on civil rights were evolving rapidly at the time of his death but it’s hard to say how they would have progressed (or regressed) had he lived longer. His successor, Andrew Johnson, was a virulent opponent of civil rights but he so overplayed his hand that it led to Radical Reconstruction which might not have happened without his provocations. In general, I think these counter-factual questions are intriguing but there are so many moving parts in history that it’s hard to make claims with any confidence.\n\nDaniel Brook is a journalist and author whose writing has appeared in Harper’s, the New York Times Magazine, and The Nation. Born in Brooklyn, raised on Long Island, and educated at Yale, Brook lives in New Orleans.\n\nAnointed with Oil: A Conversation with Darren Dochuk\n\n“Anointed with Oil places religion and oil at the center of American history. As prize-winning historian Darren Dochuk reveals, from the earliest discovery of oil in America during the Civil War, citizens saw oil as the nation’s special blessing and its peculiar burden, the source of its prophetic mission in the world. Over the century that followed and down to the present day, the oil industry’s leaders and its ordinary workers together fundamentally transformed American religion, business, and politics — boosting America’s ascent as the preeminent global power, giving shape to modern evangelical Christianity, fueling the rise of the Republican Right, and setting the terms for today’s political and environmental debates.”\n\nWe recently had the opportunity to speak with Darren Dochuk about Anointed with Oil, his research and writing processes, and the important lessons that religion and oil can teach us about numerous diverse aspects of our world today.\n\nBackStory: How did you come across this subject – what led you to understanding and focusing on the oil industry and Christianity as such a closely intertwined phenomenon?\n\nDochuk: My interest in this subject stemmed from professional and personal experiences. While writing my first book—a study of Sunbelt religious and political conservatism—I spent a lot of time in the southwest and in California, where I noticed the overlapping prevalence of evangelical Christianity and oil production. It was not uncommon for me to see oil pumps and church steeples on the same horizon, or encounter powerful oil barons who poured their profits into conservative causes. Having grown up in Alberta, Canada—where there is substantial oil and religion—I sensed there might be a story to tell. So I decided to see how the two interrelate.\n\nInitially I had planned simply to follow the money in order to see how oil capital has supported American Christianity’s institutions, cultural enterprises, and political interests at home and abroad. My book does indeed follow the money, and traces the ways petro-profits (be they attached to the Rockefeller name or other prominent oil families like the Stewarts and Pews) have shaped the institutional structures of modern American Protestantism and Catholicism, and generated some of its most important cultural and political turns; the clash of Rockefeller-supported missionaries and Stewart-supported missionaries in 1920s China, and the “modernist-fundamentalist” crisis this precipitated being one obvious example.\n\nAs I dug into the subject, though, I found that there were other connections to flesh out, points of deep contact that I had not imagined at the start. For instance, I found it fascinating how oil’s discovery during the Civil War seemed to guarantee its mythological proportions as a healing balm for a broken society and a catalyst for its political, economic, and religious ambitions on a global stage. In the years that followed, missionaries and oilmen, statesmen and engineers, churches and petroleum companies, naturalized America’s imperial project as God-ordained, and—fueled by petro-dollars and a passion to win souls and discover more oil-rich soil—together helped make the twentieth century the “American Century.”\n\nI was also surprised by the prominence of spiritualist sensibilities in early oil hunting. At a time, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when petroleum geology was rudimentary, average wildcatters leaned on their religious senses to locate crude and, aided by divining rods, went out into the world expecting signs and wonders to appear. Always curious about their physical surroundings, and the minerals they discovered along their paths, Methodist circuit preachers were among the first to note the presence of oil in Southeast Texas. Even today there are evangelical wildcatters using their bibles to locate oil in Israel and the Middle East.\n\nFinally, as I continued to research and write I grew increasingly interested in the local dimensions of oil and religion’s reciprocity. Again, on account of my own experiences growing up in Alberta, I began questioning how grassroots religious life itself is shaped by proximity to crude. Be it Texas or Oklahoma or Alberta: the oil patches of North America truly operate on oil time. In this sense, oil patch communities’ very notions of work, play, and worship are very much dictated by the prerogatives and boom-bust cycles of crude. And their proximity to oil (and in their minds their right to control it) also creates a sense of regional exceptionalism, one that is politically charged. All of these lines of questioning allowed me to flesh out—in ways I didn’t forsee at the beginning of the project—the entwinement of petroleum and religion.\n\nBackStory: When researching and writing this book, how did you keep all these narrative threads, of culture, religion, economics, geopolitics, in balance? Was there some guiding principle you followed to keep everything in focus?\n\nDochuk: Keeping these various narrative threads in balance was a real challenge, and I would be lying if I said I never worried about how the numerous moving parts in my narrative would cohere. I have always sought to write histories that incorporate multiple voices, perspectives, and scales of vision, from the grassroots to the global, and that use thick detail and colorful stories to get my main points across. One of the best books I have ever read is J. Anthony Lukas’ Common Ground, which looks at the Boston busing and civil rights crisis in the 1970s from the perspective of three different families (African American, white working class, white liberal middle class). It may not necessarily be a model I’ve been able to follow, but Lucas’ illustrious work has always been an inspiration for me.\n\nSo Anointed With Oil is my attempt to write in that manner. But still—throughout the early stages of writing especially I found myself flailing a bit, unable to manage and keep all of the pieces of the puzzle together. It was at that point that I decided to focus more on the histories of a few oil families (the Rockefellers and Pews especially) and use their generations-long sagas in the oil business and church as the glue for my broader account. I did not want my book to be as much about white elite men as it turned out to be; yet I felt I had no choice but to foreground these powerful figures in order to provide the reader with some sense of grounding and continuity. It may not have been a “guiding principle,” per se, but this strategy did provide me with an anchor of sorts; whenever I felt I needed to glance at wider structural forces of economic, cultural, and geopolitical changes related to oil and religion I knew I could do so, however briefly, then return the reader to the illustrative tales of oil’s first families.\n\nBackStory: In the book, the oil industry both relies on and buttresses a vision of progress and civilization – you write that “The golden age of America is in the future, in the development of her limitless resources.” I think it’s fair to say that that vision has darkened. How does oil factor into our dimmed modern outlook? And more broadly, what does your book reveal about the narrative of civilizational progress in American history?\n\nDochuk: As mentioned above, as I got deeper into the archives and started stretching my story back in time to the very beginning of the oil industry in the 1850s and 1860s (I originally planned to start in 1901), I realized just how central oil was to Americans’ envisioning of their nation’s economic, cultural, and political future. During the late nineteenth century, oil was looked upon as the fuel and lubricant that would light the nation’s cities, grease its modern machinery and economic ascent, and fuel its imperial expansion.To be sure, amid America’s excited rush into modernity, other natural resources inspired sacred dreams of their own. Scholars have suggested that turn-of-the-century coal was itself religious for the way it “congealed meanings of progress into one enchanted material.” For western societies especially—Britain and the United States, coal was deemed a suprahuman life force gifted to them as their tool to Christianize a barbarous world. Yet, even at this early juncture oil’s sacred status was special. Summoned, not scraped from the earth, spectacular in its earth-shattering arrival, and deemed a democratic agent for the way it privileged individuals’ free labor with earth’s resources, oil always seemed the purer industrial lifeblood. Oil, then, was a material that easily lent itself to bold, sweeping, and optimistic narratives of civilizational progress, and my book tracks that spirit of progress from the 1860s to the 1970s.\n\nAnointed With Oil tries to demonstrate, then, how one resource—one commodity—could and did elicit grand (and theological) thinking about America’s manifest destiny. Even the most base materials, I suggest in this way, should be accounted for when we, as historians, try to make sense of how Americans viewed their nation’s development on an international scale.\n\nYet while portraying the long history of oil in this country as a melodrama of sorts (the way countless American powerbrokers and average citizens envisioned it), I don’t mean to brush over the excesses and exploitation that oil and its sacralization by Americans provoked: excesses of wealth and power, the exploitation of natural environments and human labor and lives. To the contrary, I attempt to show how the adoration of oil often led a majority of Americans to glance over its vilest effects on societies, those evident on this side of the Atlantic as well as beyond. I also attempt to show how oil’s seeming omnipresence in American society did not sit well with all citizens. At the very outset of the oil industry, petroleum also served as a caution for some outspoken Americans who sensed that its arrival meant a darker rather than brighter future for humanity. For early critics such as Ida Tarbell, petrocapitalism represented all that was coercive and wrong about modern industry and markets; watching her father lose his business and self confidence as John D. Rockefeller monopolized oil, Tarbell deemed crude a curse as much as a blessing for her society.\n\nSo from the beginning, oil generated as much angst and as many dimmed outlooks for modern America as it did notions of American exceptionalism and glory on a global stage. The outlook would grow increasingly more dim in the 1960s and 1970s as oil and the scale of its destruction (witnessed in oil spills in England and California and their blight on nature) would come to stand for everything wrong about modern industrial society. In the decades since, numerous critics have followed Tarbell’s lead and embraced a carbon-free gospel that demands resistance to and the rollback of oil’s hold on modern society. Oil, in their minds, represents a future of disastrous climate change and earth’s catastrophic end, not of some millennial utopia first imagined by oil-obsessed Americans in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nBackStory: You write that “Oil, America’s gift from God, was now America’s gift to the world,” and argue that oil played a central role in America’s sense of exceptionalism and of a global mission. What new lessons can we draw from this understanding of the American Century, and from its end after the 1970s?\n\nDochuk: As alluded to above, and as my book demonstrates, throughout the twentieth century countless powerbrokers (politicians, businessmen, preachers, government and nongovernment agents) maintained a confidence that “Big Religion” (defined as ecumenical, internationalist, civil, cosmopolitan) wedded to “Big Oil: (defined by integration, combination, and collective effort between state and company in foreign fields) could and would guarantee this nation’s global authority. Of course their dominance in other corporate sectors further buttressed their belief that the United States had reached an unmatched status in the western world as its chief protector. But the sheer financial clout of the U.S. oil industry (roughly eight of the twenty most lucrative and powerful corporations in 1950s America were oil companies) meant it played a unique and special role in shaping America’s sense of its exceptional stature in Cold War times.\n\nYet as heady as American oil’s supremacy during the Cold War was, the diminishing authority U.S. oil companies and visionaries realized in the 1970s made it painfully evident that the nation’s moment in the sun had come to an end. Oil’s dark side would only grow more pronounced for Americans when the energy crisis of the 1970s made it clear that their hold over the black stuff was no longer hegemonic or beneficent. Rising frustrations with OPEC and its own claims to crude as god-given; festering worry about liberal drifts in energy policy; heightened tensions with Middle Eastern petroleum suppliers; the violent and uncertain remapping of oil interests—and American confidences in the Middle East: these were signs that the fantastic possibilities of oil Americans envisioned and embraced at an earlier time now rested at the root of the nation’s knotty geopolitical involvements around the globe, and served to remind them that their nation was no longer so exceptional.\n\nSo by the 1980s, one could say that Henry Luce’s American Century, and its twin pillars of beneficent oil and internationalist religion, had succumbed. Today, it is very clear that the exceptional authority Luce proclaimed for his carbon-rich county is no longer America’s to enjoy alone. Of course, petroleum was a global phenomenon from the start. Still, there is an irony in play. Big oil’s ambassadors who went out into the world to educate peoples in the magical potentials of the black stuff helped spur other theologies of oil’s blessedness, other myths of exceptionalism that are now replying from abroad. Once on the receiving end of American conceptions of God and black gold and their promises of a petro-fueled modernity, it is now oil-rich and religious societies like Saudi Arabia that are spreading that faith.\n\nBackStory: From the theological focus of independent Texas oilmen seeking oil, to the ideas of the mechanical gospel, God and nature have been deeply connected through oil. What can this tell us about the theological and moral dimensions of ongoing political battles around environmental issues?\n\nDochuk: One of my goals in writing Anointed With Oil was to demonstrate how and why our current battles over energy and environment are so morally charged. The ongoing political struggles over pipelines and the Alberta oil sands touch on religious and moral sentiments that run deep in our histories.\n\nOn one hand, for instance, we have champions of the wildcat way—independent energy companies and evangelicals in the Southwest—continuing to espouse an “America First” energy platform that demands fewer federal regulations over western lands and drill sites. Ronald Reagan won the hearts of the oil patch in 1980 by running on a platform of “Let’s Make America Great Again.” “We must remove government obstacles to energy production,” he declared.” “It is no program simply to say “use less energy,” here referencing President Jimmy Carter’s energy program. Reagan traveled to Texas and mingled with preachers and petroleum executives, promising them that the nation would be great again as soon as Washington bureaucrats took a back seat and let rugged wildcatters open up new frontiers of extractive wealth and god-fearing pioneers raise their children in communities calibrated to the morals of an honorable past. It is that very same charge that now animates Donald Trump’s administration and his supporters across Texas, Oklahoma, and the American oil patch.\n\nAt the same time, we also see a religious and political fervency that is equally potent on the anti-oil side of the political spectrum. Recent battles over energy and environment have exposed dissent in America’s oil patches over the efficacy of the wildcat imperative. At odds are stalwarts of the old order and young dissenters who demand different handling of “God’s garden.” Countless children of the oil patch are locking arms with environmentalists and joining environmental movements to protest some of wildcat religion’s creations—like the Keystone Pipeline and Alberta Oil sands. One young evangelist for the carbon-free gospel states it simply: “many people see the pipeline as a political or an economic issue, but I see it as a moral issue.” Invoking Charles Finney, another proselyte promises a “power shift” brought on by revival on behalf of the planet.\n\nIf we want to make sense of our current moment of political struggle, then, I would suggest we need to foreground a longer history of religiously-motivated and charged contestation over the way Americans—particularly those who inhabit our energy frontiers—encounter, inhabit, manage, and possess land and its resources.\n\nFrom one of our readers:One thing that intrigued me was the mention of the Young Ladies Oil Company in Chapter 3, said to be created by a group of women. I’d imagine this was a rarity for this time? Is there any other information about the company and what happened to it?\n\nDochuk: The Young Ladies Oil Company was certainly intriguing; I came across only brief mention of the company, but hoped to uncover more about it as my research unfolded. It was an anomaly for women—let alone “young” women—to be so directly and heavily invested in the oil business. A number of prominent women that I studied inherited their husband’s oil companies and went on to manage their family-owned oil businesses’ wealth. A few oversaw the distribution of corporate profits to religious and educational institutions like Baylor University. And in more modest ways, in local settings (like the family farms) women were often left in charge of the management of royalties generated by the leasing of land to oil companies. But in terms of its direct empowerment of women in the oil business, the Young Ladies Oil Company was indeed a rarity, and I only wish I could have dug up more information about it!\n\nDarren Dochuk is a professor of History at University of Notre Dame. His book, Anointed With Oil: How Christianity and Crude Made Modern America, is out now.\n\nOn the Heels of Ignorance: A Conversation With Owen Whooley\n\nThe fundamental concerns of American psychiatry – articulating madness, understanding mechanisms responsible for mental distress – have always eluded it. As Owen Whooley argues in On the Heels of Ignorance: Psychiatry and the Politics of Not Knowing, the history of the field is a history of ignorance, and a cyclical record of disappointment and reinvention.\n\nOn the Heels of Ignorance begins with psychiatry’s origins in the 1840s, and moves through nearly two centuries of periodic understanding, doubt, and reinvention. Whooley creates a unique and coherent framework to grasp the chaotic history of psychiatry, with ignorance emerging as the unifying thread. On the Heels of Ignorance not only succeeds in clarifying a blurry subject, but also points to a new direction for the field, and for the discipline of intellectual history.\n\nBackStory spoke with Owen Whooley about his book, the hype-disappointment cycle, and the known unknown of psychiatric ignorance.\n\nBackStory: You talk about psychiatry as a narrative character that keeps reinventing itself, it keeps changing. You have this quote, “Historians of the same period, often using the very same data, can arrive at wildly different portrayals.” How did you reckon with this in your own writing in the book?\n\nWhooley: There’s a fundamental challenge to anyone who’s examining psychiatry or psychiatric practice from an academic intellectual perspective. The field itself is very polemical. On one side you have apologist histories, often written by former psychiatrists themselves. Then on the other side you have research that is more of the anti-psychiatry vein. So it becomes hard to enter into that conversation with nuance. I think a fundamental challenge that I had in writing this book is, I don’t want this to be an anti-psychiatry screed. I don’t want, for example, Scientologists taking the book up in support of their arguments. But on the other hand, I want to remain critical of psychiatry because frankly, it’s hard to look at the history of psychiatry and not be critical. There’s a lot of abuses there.\n\nI try to walk this fine line, I think it’s a difficulty when the title of your book has “ignorance” in it because that suggests a certain kind of critical standpoint, which I do indeed take, but I hope that, for example, psychiatrists who might actually read the book would find it to be a critical, yet more balanced account.\n\nOften when we write about professions, or write about scientific endeavors, we have a tendency to slide into narratives of progress. That’s another thing I’m constantly trying to work against. Not to say that there hasn’t been progress, not to say that people don’t get better from contemporary treatments, but to really push against these professional narratives that psychiatry is getting better and better all the time. Because I think when you look at the history of psychiatry, you don’t see a linear progression. What you see are these repeated cycles that I call reinvention.\n\nBackStory: You talk about psychiatry’s stance towards the future and this necessary fundamental optimism that it has. What does that say about psychiatrists’ own conception of their history?\n\nWhooley: So, one thing to note about the book is, the data I’m working with can tell you about psychiatric elites, or what other historians have called aspirational psychiatry. These are the leaders of the profession, who are articulating a vision of the profession. Now, my other research would suggest that psychiatry is unique, or perhaps extreme in the ways in which everyday practice might be divorced from what’s happening among these elites.\n\nSo what happens in this cycle? Well, psychiatry faces some sort of crisis when their ignorance gets exposed, often in a very public way. And so, reformers during those periods of crisis begin to articulate a new vision for psychiatry. They then hype up this new vision.

It’s not just that they were wrong. They were fundamentally misguided in the ways they articulated and understood mental illness.\n\nWhat I argue is in doing so, these reformers then create a break from the past. It’s almost like they acknowledge this history, they acknowledged these problems, but they domesticate it into the past, relegate it to the past, and then articulate a new kind of direction that is fundamentally different from that past. And so that lets them off the hook.
