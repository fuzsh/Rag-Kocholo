Their first born, she was baptized on 4 March 1858. Sponsors were\n\nRobert Buxterbach and Frieda Weber, both married and residents of Solingen.\n\nOn 4 October 1879, in Solingen, Clara married Otto Voos/Vohs, an Eisengieï¿½er (iron caster) b 18 Jan 1851, son of deceased parents Wilhelm Voos/Vohs and Louise Dï¿½pper. Otto was born in Elberfeld, Rhine Province, Prussia. Witnesses to their marriage were August Muschick, a Schreiner (carpenter), 25 years old and Matthias Mï¿½ller, a Schuhmacher (shoemaker), 25 years old, both residents of Solingen. Clara and Otto, were listed as Evangelical. They lived at No. 10 Kronenbergerstraï¿½ (Kronenberger Street), Solingen.\n\nIn 1893 Otto, age 42, sailed 3rd class to America from Solingen, Germany. Carrying only one bag, he left Vlissingen (Flushing in English), Netherlands on 10 Dec 1893 aboard the SS Baumwall and arrived in Boston, Massachusetts on 1 Jan 1894 taking about 21 days. The mainifest gave his occupation as an iron molder, with funds of only $4.00 remaining. He was to meet his brother-in-law Otto Reuter in Milwaukee. Clara left Germany with the girls on 9 May 1894. They traveled aboard the SS Switzerland, from Antwerp, Belgium and arrived in Philadelphia, Pa. on 23 May 1894, taking about 14 days. According to the ship's mainifest, Clara was 36 years, 3 months; Helene was 13 years, 3 months; Adele was 11 years, 9 months; Elsie was 9 years, 8 months and Paula (Pauline Helen) was 4 years, 9 months. All could read and write English. Travel was 116 mi. or 186 km from Solingen to Antwerp. Clara's funds remaining amounted to $3.00, although she did have tickets sent by Otto,\n\nto take them on to meet him in Milwaukee, their final destination.\n\nClara & Otto were blessed with four daughters, Helene 9 Jul 1881; Adele 17 Jul 1882, married Edward Oliver Hamilton Logan; Elsie 27 Jun 1884, married Charles A. Fischer; and Paula (Pauline Helen) married Joseph Schwier. Helene born in 1881 passed away before 1900.\n\nThe family settled in Buffalo, New York after leaving Milwaukee about 1899. As of the 8 Jun 1900 Census, the family lived on Mortimer St. in Buffalo. Otto was employed as an Iron Molder, Adele and Elsie were employed as servants, Pauline was in school. Clara had 4 children, 3 were living, as Helene had passed away.\n\nVisit the Otto Reuter and App family biographies.\n\nSee photos below of the ships that plied the North Atlantic during the late 1800s. I have added a few details about the three ships. Also visit 'Norway Heritage', a site that tells about the trials and hardships of Transatlantic Crossings.\n\nClara and Otto left Germany because they did not approve of the policies of 'The Kaiser', William II, Emperor of Germany and King of Prussia. The Kaiser's policies helped to bring about World War I. See the paragraphs below about German history.\n\nInformation from my Mother, Leta Logan Hapeman: A family named Kuhn came to America at about the same time as Clara and Otto. Some of their family had previously migrated to Buffalo, and had owned since 1800, the business 'Kuhn Monuments' on Genesee near Pine Ridge Rd. Otto was employed there as a stone polisher for a number of years.\n\nClara and Otto's monument was made by the Kuhn family.\n\nOtto passed away 31 May 1917, Clara 16 Jun 1920.\n\nBoth are buried in Buffalo Cemetery, Cheektowaga, Erie County, New York\n\nTheir locations are:\n\nOtto, Sect H Lot 286 Grave 1\n\nClara, Sect H Lot 289 Grave 3\n\nThe plots are on a corner and therefore are side by side\n\nVIEW THEIR MONUMENT\n\nNordrheine-Westfalen Crest\n\nThe SS Switzerland\n\nCaptain Hans Dirderik Boxrud was the Master for the Red Star Line SS Switzerland in May 1894.

The son of Frederick William III, he was born in Berlin on 15 Oct 1795. After suffering two paralytic strokes in 1857, Frederick William became mentally unfit to rule. In 1858 a regency was established under his brother William, who, as William I, succeeded to the throne when Frederick William died 2 Jan 1861.\n\nWilliam I, full name Wilhelm Friedrich Ludwig (1797-1888), emperor of Germany (1871-88) and king of Prussia (1861-88), reigned during the unification of Germany under the Prussian crown. He was born 22 Mar 1797, in Berlin, the second son of Frederick William III of Prussia and his queen, Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. William declared at his coronation, that he \"ruled by favor of God, and of no one else\". Upon his death in Berlin on 9 Mar 1888, son Frederick William succeeded him as Frederick III.\n\nWilliam II (of Germany and Prussia), full name Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert (1859-1941), emperor of Germany and king of Prussia (1888-1918), policies helped to bring about World War I. William, also known as Kaiser Wilhelm, was born 27 Jan 1859, in Berlin and educated at the University of Bonn. He was the son of Prince Frederick William, later German emperor as Frederick III, and Victoria Adelaide Mary Louise, eldest daughter of Queen Victoria of Great Britain. In 1881, after a period of military service, he married Augusta Victoria, princess of Schleswig-Holstein. He became emperor in 1888 upon the death of his father, who had reigned for only three months. After the death of Augusta Victoria in 1921, he married Hermine, the princess of Schï¿½naich-Carolath.
