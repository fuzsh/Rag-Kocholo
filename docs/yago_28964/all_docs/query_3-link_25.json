        "text": "Friedrich Wilhelm III (August 3, 1770 – June 7, 1840) was King of Prussia from November 16, 1797 until his death in 1840. He was concurrently Prince-Elector of Brandenburg in the Holy Roman Empire until August 6,1806, when the Empire was dissolved. After the end of the Holy Roman Empire the title reverted to Margrave of Brandenburg.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm was born in Potsdam on August 3, 1770 as the son of King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia and Princess Frederica Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt, the daughter of Ludwig IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, and Countess Palatine Caroline of Zweibrücken. She was born in Prenzlau. She was the sister of Grand Duchess Louise of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, as well as Landgrave Ludwig X of Hesse-Darmstad, who later was the first Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm was considered to be a shy and reserved boy, which became noticeable in his particularly reticent conversations, distinguished by the lack of personal pronouns. This manner of speech subsequently came to be considered entirely appropriate for military officers. He was neglected by his father during his childhood and suffered from an inferiority complex his entire life.\n\nOn December 24, 1793, Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm married in the Kronprinzenpalais (Crown Prince’s Palace) in Berlin, to his cousin Princess Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the fourth daughter and sixth child of Duke Charles of Mecklenburg and his wife Princess Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt. Her father Charles was a brother of Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III of the United Kingdom, and her mother Frederike was a granddaughter of Ludwig VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nHer maternal grandmother, Landgravine Marie Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt, and her paternal first-cousin Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom served as sponsors at her baptism; her second given name came from Princess Augusta Sophia.\n\nAt the time of her birth, Louise’s father was not yet the ruler of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (he would not succeed his brother as Duke until 1794), and consequently she was not born in a court, but rather in a less formal home.\n\nLouise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz bore him ten children. Friedrich Wilhelm lived a civil life with a problem-free marriage, which did not change even when he became King of Prussia in 1797. His wife Louise was particularly loved by the Prussian people, which boosted the popularity of the whole House of Hohenzollern, including the King himself.\n\nReign\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm succeeded to the throne on November 16, 1797 as King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia. He also became, in personal union, the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel (1797–1806 and again 1813–1840). At once, the new King showed that he was earnest of his good intentions by cutting down the royal establishment’s expenses, dismissing his father’s ministers, and reforming the most oppressive abuses of the late reign. He had the Hohenzollern determination to retain personal power but not the Hohenzollern genius for using it.\n\nToo distrustful to delegate responsibility to his ministers, he greatly reduced the effectiveness of his reign since he was forced to assume the roles he did not delegate. This is the main factor of his inconsistent rule.\n\nDisgusted with his father’s court (in both political intrigues and sexual affairs), Friedrich Wilhelm III’s first and most successful early endeavor was to restore his dynasty’s moral legitimacy. The eagerness to restore dignity to his family went so far that it nearly caused sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow to cancel the expensive and lavish Prinzessinnengruppe project, which was commissioned by the previous monarch Friedrich Wilhelm II.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm III ruled Prussia during the difficult times of the Napoleonic Wars. The king reluctantly joined the coalition against Napoleon in the Befreiungskriege. Following Napoleon’s defeat, he took part in the Congress of Vienna, which assembled to settle the political questions arising from the new, post-Napoleonic order in Europe. His primary interests were internal – the reform of Prussia’s Protestant churches. He was determined to unify the Protestant churches to homogenize their liturgy, organization, and architecture.\n\nThe long-term goal was to have fully centralized royal control of all the Protestant churches in the Prussian Union of Churches. The king was said to be extremely shy and indecisive. His wife Queen Louise (1776–1810) was his most important political advisor. She led a mighty group that included Baron vom Stein, Prince von Hardenberg, Gerhard von Scharnhorst, and Count von Gneisenau. They set about reforming Prussia’s administration, churches, finance, and military.\n\nKing Friedrich Wilhelm III was the common ancestor of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia (through his daughter Princess Charlotte, wife of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia) and German Emperor Wilhelm II (through his second son Emperor/King Wilhelm I). He was the dedicatee of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony in 1824.\n\nIn 1824, after the death of his wife, King Friedrich Wilhelm III remarried (morganatically) Countess Auguste von Harrach, Princess of Liegnitz. They had no children.\n\nDeath"
