        "text": "by Scott Mehl\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2012\n\nIn the days preceding the Kingdom of Prussia, the Berlin Cathedral was the usual burial place for the Dukes of Prussia and Electors of Brandenburg. The Royal Crypt below the Cathedral is the final resting place of several of the Kings of Prussia as well. It was not uncommon to have a cenotaph built and displayed in the Cathedral itself while having the actual tomb down in the Crypt. Unfortunately, the Cathedral was bombed in World War II and many of the tombs were damaged or destroyed by the collapse of the Dome and the fire which ensued. The crypt itself was restored and opened to the public again in 1999 but many of the tombs have not yet been restored. One example is the tomb of King Friedrich Wilhelm II.\n\nWith the expansion of Sanssouci, we begin to see some of the Prussian royals buried in the Friedenskirche (Church of Peace) as well as elsewhere on the grounds. Several chose to be buried in a mausoleum at Charlottenburg Palace, and the last Emperor – Kaiser Wilhelm II, was entombed in a mausoleum built on the grounds of Huis Doorn, his home in exile in the Netherlands, while his two wives were buried at the Antique Temple (scroll down) on the grounds of Sanssouci.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Church of Peace on the grounds of Sanssouci Palace in Potsdam, Germany\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Berlin Cathedral in Berlin, Germany\n\nKings of Prussia\n\nFriedrich I, reigned January 18, 1701 – February 25, 1713\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm I, reigned February 25, 1713 – May 31, 1740\n\nFriedrich II, reigned May 31, 1740, to August 17, 1786\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm II, reigned August 17, 1786 – November 16, 1797\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm III, reigned November 16, 1797 – June 7, 1840\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm IV, reigned June 7, 1840 – January 2, 1861\n\nWilhelm I, reigned January 2, 1861 – March 9, 1888\n\nFriedrich III, reigned March 9, 1888 – June 15, 1888\n\nWilhelm II, reigned June 15, 1888 – November 18, 1918 (abdication)\n\nUnless noted, all portraits and photos are from Wikipedia.\n\nFriedrich I, King in Prussia\n\nreigned January 18, 1701 – February 25, 1713\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Friedrich I, King in Prussia\n\nFriedrich I was born July 11, 1657, in Königsberg. His parents were Friedrich Wilhelm, Elector of Brandenburg, and Louise Henriette of Orange-Nassau. Friedrich became Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia in 1688 upon the death of his father. In 1701, he crowned himself ‘King in Prussia’, when the Duchy of Prussia was elevated to a kingdom.\n\nFriedrich married three times, to Elisabeth Henrietta of Hesse-Kassel; to Sophia Charlotte of Hanover; and to Sophia Louise of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. From these marriages, there were three children, two of whom survived to adulthood, including his son the future Friedrich Wilhelm I.\n\nFriedrich died in Berlin on February 25, 1713, at the age of 55, and is buried at the Berlin Cathedral.\n\nElisabeth Henrietta of Hesse-Kassel, Electoral Princess of Brandenburg\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Elisabeth Henriette of Hesse-Kassel, Electoral Princess of Brandenburg\n\nElisabeth Henrietta was born November 18, 1661, in Kassel, to William VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and Hedwig Sophia of Brandenburg. In 1679, she married her cousin, Freidrich, Electoral Prince of Brandenburg, and they had one daughter.\n\nElisabeth Henrietta died on July 7, 1683, at the age of 21, and is buried at the Berlin Cathedral.\n\nSophia Charlotte of Hanover, Queen in Prussia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Sophie Charlotte of Hanover, Queen in Prussia\n\nSophie Charlotte was born on October 30, 1668, in Osnabrück, Germany, to Ernst August, Elector of Hanover and Sophia of the Palatinate. Her older brother later became King George I of Britain. She and Friedrich had two children, including the future King Friedrich Wilhelm I.\n\nSophie Charlotte died of pneumonia on January 21, 1705, in Hanover. She is buried at the Berlin Cathedral.\n\nSophie Louise of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Queen in Prussia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Sophie Luise of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Queen in Prussia\n\nSophia Louise was born May 6, 1685, to Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Grabow and Christine Wilhelmine of Hesse-Homburg. She married King Friedrich I on November 28, 1708.\n\nSophia outlived her husband by over 20 years and died July 29, 1735, at Schwerin Castle in Mecklenburg. She is buried in the Mecklenburg-Schwerin royal crypt at the Schelfkirche St. Nikolai in Schwerin.\n\n********************\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm I, King in Prussia\n\nreigned February 25, 1713 – May 31, 1740\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Friedrich Wilhelm I, King in Prussia\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm I was born August 14, 1688, to King Friedrich I and his second wife, Sophia Charlotte of Hanover. He and his wife, Sophia Dorothea of Hanover had 14 children, including Frederick the Great, and Queen Louisa Ulrika of Sweden.\n\nKing Friedrich Wilhelm I died May 31, 1740, in Berlin, and was originally interred at the Garrison Church in Potsdam. During World War II, his remains were removed and hidden away, and were later found by American Forces and reburied at St. Elisabeth’s Church in Marburg. In 1953, his remains were moved to Hohenzollern Castle where they remained until 1991. At that point, his coffin was finally laid to rest on the steps of the altar at the Kaiser Friedrich Mausoleum at the Friedenskirche.\n\nSophia Dorothea of Hanover, Queen in Prussia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Sophia Dorothea of Hanover, Queen in Prussia\n\nSophia Dorothea was born on March 16, 1687, in Hanover, the daughter of the future George I of Great Britain and Sophia Dorothea of Celle. On November 28, 1706, she married her first cousin, the future Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia. The marriage produced 14 children in total, despite the marriage not being a very happy one. Sophia had a very close relationship with her son, the future Frederick the Great.\n\nQueen Sophia Dorothea survived her husband by 17 years and died on June 28, 1757, in Berlin. She is buried in the Berlin Cathedral.\n\n********************\n\nFriedrich II (Federick the Great)\n\nreigned May 31, 1740 – August 17, 1786\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Friedrich II, King of Prussia\n\nFriedrich II (best known as Frederick the Great) was born January 24, 1712, in Berlin, the son of King Friedrich Wilhelm I and Sophia Dorothea of Hanover. While his father had been immensely interested in all things military, Friedrich excelled in the arts – especially music. This contributed to a very tense relationship with his father, although he enjoyed a very close relationship with his mother. In 1733, he married Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern, but they spent most of their lives separated, seeing each other only a handful of times after he became King. As they had no children, Friedrich was succeeded by his nephew, Friedrich Wilhelm II.\n\nFriedrich II died quietly in his study at Sanssouci on August 17, 1786, at the age of 74. He’d left very strict instructions that he wished to be buried on the grounds of Sanssouci with little fuss or fanfare. However, his nephew instead had Friedrich buried in the Garrison Church, Potsdam, with his father. During World War II, his remains were removed and hidden away, and were later found by American Forces and reburied at St Elisabeth’s Church in Marburg. In 1953, his remains were moved to Hohenzollern Castle where they remained until 1991. Finally, on the 205th anniversary of his death, Fredrick the Great’s wishes were granted. His casket lay in state in the court of honor at Sanssoucci with a guard of honor. Late that night, he was laid to rest in the plot he had designated before his death – on the terrace overlooking the vineyards at Sanssouci – near the graves of his beloved dogs.\n\nElisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern, Queen of Prussia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Bevern, Queen of Prussia\n\nElisabeth Christine, the daughter of Ferdinand Albert II, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and Antoinette of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, was born in Wolfenbüttel on November 8, 1715. She married the future Frederick the Great on June 12, 1733, but the marriage proved to be childless. Frederick had no interest in Elisabeth and once he became king, the two lived separately, seeing each other only a few times.\n\nQueen Elisabeth Christine died on January 13, 1797, at the Stadtschloss in Berlin. She is buried at the Berlin Cathedral.\n\n********************\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm II, King of Prussia\n\nreigned August 17, 1786 – November 16, 1797\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Friedrich Wilhelm II, King of Prussia\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm II was born September 25, 1744, at the Stadschloss in Berlin. His parents were Prince August Wilhelm, the second son of King Friedrich Wilhelm I, and Luise of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. He succeeded his uncle, King Friedrich II, as King of Prussia in 1786. He married twice – first, to Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and second, to Friederike Luise of Hesse-Darmstadt. Neither marriage was very happy, and he had many affairs.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm died on November 16, 1797, at the Marble Palace (Marmorpalais) in Potsdam. He is buried at the Berlin Cathedral.\n\nElisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Crown Princess of Prussia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Crown Princess of Prussia\n\nElisabeth Christine was born in Wolfenbüttel on November 8, 1746. Her parents were Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Princess Philippine Charlotte of Prussia, a sister of Frederick the Great. She married the future Friedrich Wilhelm II on July 14, 1765. They had one child, a daughter Frederica, who later married the Duke of York and Albany, a son of King George III of the United Kingdom. Elisabeth and Friedrich Wilhelm’s marriage was dissolved in 1769, but she retained her title of Crown Princess of Prussia.\n\nElisabeth Christine died February 18, 1840, in Szczecin (Stettin), Poland, and was buried in a mausoleum on the grounds of the Ducal Castle. It is speculated that she was later reburied in the cathedral of Krakow.\n\nFriederike Luise of Hesse-Darmstadt, Queen of Prussia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Friederike Luise of Hesse-Darmstadt, Queen of Prussia\n\nFriederike Luise was born in Prenzlau on October 16, 1751, the daughter of Ludwig IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and Caroline of Zweibrücken. She married the future Friedrich Wilhelm II almost immediately after his first marriage was dissolved, on July 14, 1769, at the Charlottenburg Palace. Together they had 8 children, 6 of whom lived to adulthood.\n\nQueen Friederike Luise died in Berlin, August 25, 1805. She is buried at the Berlin Cathedral.\n\n********************\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm III, King of Prussia\n\nreigned November 16, 1797 – June 7, 1840\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Friedrich Wilhelm III, King of Prussia\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm III was born August 3, 1770, in Potsdam, the son of Friedrich Wilhelm II and Friederike Luise of Hesse-Darmstadt. On December 24, 1793, he married Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The couple had 10 children, including two sons who would become Kings of Prussia, and a daughter Charlotte who became Empress of Russia through her marriage to Tsar Nicholas I.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm III died in Berlin on June 7, 1840, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Friedrich Wilhelm IV. He is buried at the Mausoleum at Charlottenburg Palace.\n\nLouise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Queen of Prussia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Queen of Prussia\n\nLouise was born on March 10, 1776, in Hanover, to Duke Charles of Mecklenburg and Landgravine Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt. Considered a great beauty of her time, Louise married the future Friedrich Wilhelm III on December 24, 1793, and the two enjoyed a very happy marriage, producing a total of 10 children.\n\nAt the young age of 34, Queen Louise died on July 19, 1810, while visiting her father in Strelitz. She was buried in the gardens of Charlottenburg Palace, over which a mausoleum was built. In 1814, her husband King Friedrich Wilhelm III established the Order of Louise, in tribute and remembrance of his wife.\n\n********************\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm IV, King of Prussia\n\nreigned June 7, 1840 – January 2, 1861\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Friedrich Wilhelm IV, King of Prussia\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm IV was born in Berlin on October 15, 1795, the eldest son of King Friedrich Wilhelm III and Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. He married Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria on November 29, 1823. A stroke in 1857 left him significantly incapacitated, both physically and mentally, and as he had no children, his younger brother served as Regent until his death. This brother would succeed him as King Wilhelm I.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm IV died in Potsdam on January 2, 1861. He is buried with his wife in the crypt of the Friedeskirche, in Sanssouci Park. His heart is buried in the Mausoleum at Charlottenburg Palace.\n\nElisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria, Queen of Prussia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria, Queen of Prussia\n\nElisabeth Ludovika was born November 13, 1801, to King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his wife Caroline of Baden. She had a twin sister, Amalie, who later became Queen Consort of Saxony. On November 29, 1823, Elisabeth married the future Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia. The couple had no children.\n\nQueen Elisabeth outlived her husband by 12 years and died December 14, 1873, while visiting her sister, Queen Amalie of Saxony, in Dresden. She was buried with her husband in the Crypt of the Friedenskirche, in Sanssouci Park.\n\n********************\n\nWilhelm I, German Emperor, King of Prussia\n\nreigned January 2, 1861 – March 9, 1888\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Wilhelm I, German Emperor, King of Prussia\n\nWilhelm I was born March 22, 1797, in Berlin, the second son of King Friedrich Wilhelm III and Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. As the second son, he was not expected to reign, so he received little education and spent his life devoted to his military service. He married Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach on June 11, 1829, and they had two children. When his elder brother, King Friedrich Wilhelm IV, suffered a stroke in 1857, Wilhelm was appointed Regent and succeeded to the throne upon his brother’s death in 1861. It was 10 years later, on January 18, 1871, that the German Empire was created and Wilhelm was created ‘German Emperor’.\n\nWilhelm I died in Berlin on March 9, 1888, and was succeeded by his only son, Friedrich III. He is buried at the Mausoleum at Charlottenburg Palace.\n\nAugusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, German Empress, Queen of Prussia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, German Empress, Queen of Prussia\n\nAugusta was born September 30, 1811, in Weimar, to Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Maria Pavlovna of Russia. Her maternal grandfather was Tsar Paul I of Russia. On June 11, 1829, Augusta married the future Wilhelm I and had two children. The two endured a sometimes distant and unloving marriage, but she had great hopes that her son’s marriage to the daughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom might help to guide them to a more liberal monarchy in the future. These views were not shared by her husband.\n\nAugusta, by now the first German Empress, reconciled with her husband just months before his death. Three months later, her only son, Emperor Friedrich III would die of throat cancer, and her grandson, Wilhelm II, would become German Emperor. Just over a year later, on January 7, 1890, Empress Augusta passed away. She was buried beside her husband in the Mausoleum at Charlottenburg Palace.\n\n********************\n\nFriedrich III, German Emperor, King of Prussia\n\nreigned March 9, 1888 – June 15, 1888\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Friedrich III, German Emperor, King of Prussia\n\nFriedrich III (Fritz) was born October 18, 1831, at the New Palace (Neues Palais) in Potsdam, the only son of King Wilhelm I and Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. On January 25, 1858, Fritz married Princess Victoria, the Princess Royal of the United Kingdom, eldest daughter of Queen Victoria. The couple had eight children and enjoyed a very close and devoted marriage. He succeeded as King of Prussia and German Emperor upon the death of his father in March of 1888. Unfortunately, he was already terminally ill with throat cancer and reigned for only 99 days.\n\nFriedrich III died on June 15, 1888. He is buried in the Kaiser Friedrich Mausoleum at the Friedenskirche in Sanssouci Park, with his wife and two young sons.\n\nVictoria, Princess Royal of the United Kingdom, German Empress, Queen of Prussia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Victoria, Princess Royal, German Empress, Queen of Prussia\n\nVictoria was born November 21, 1840, the eldest child of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. She married the future Friedrich III of Prussia on January 25, 1858, at the Chapel Royal, St James’ Palace in London. Like her parents, this was truly a love match for the young couple. They had eight children together. Her reign as Queen and Empress Consort was short, as her husband was already terminally ill by the time he became King. After his death, Victoria had a home built in Kronberg, Schloss Friedrichshof, where she lived out her remaining years.\n\nEmpress Friedrich (as she was commonly known) passed away on August 5, 1901, at Schloss Friedrichshof, following a long battle with cancer. She was buried beside her husband in the Kaiser Friedrich Mausoleum at the Friedenskirche in Sanssouci Park. Two of her sons who died as children are buried there as well.\n\n********************\n\nWilhelm II, German Emperor, King of Prussia\n\nreigned June 15, 1888 – November 18, 1918\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Wilhelm II, German Emperor, King of Prussia\n\nWilhelm II was born on January 27, 1859, at the Kronprinzenpalais (Crown Prince’s Palace) in Berlin, the eldest child of Friedrich III and Victoria, Princess Royal of the UK. An injury suffered during birth left him with his left arm significantly damaged and useless. He learned to hide this as a child and continued to do so for the majority of his life. Wilhelm married Augusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein in 1881 and they had seven children. In 1918, Wilhelm was forced to abdicate as German Emperor and King of Prussia. He spent his remaining years in exile at Huis Doorn in the Netherlands. After Augusta died in 1921, he remarried Hermine Reuss of Greiz.\n\nWilhelm II died on June 4, 1941, at Huis Doorn. He is buried in the mausoleum on the grounds.\n\nAugusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, German Empress, Queen of Prussia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Augusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein, German Empress, Queen of Prussia\n\nAugusta Viktoria was born October 22, 1858, the daughter of Friedrich VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein and Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. Her maternal grandmother was Princess Feodora of Leiningen, the elder half-sister of Queen Victoria of the UK. Dona (as she was known) married the future Kaiser Wilhelm II on February 27, 1881, eventually becoming the last Queen of Prussia and German Empress. After her husband’s abdication, she moved with him to Huis Doorn in the Netherlands where she lived out her remaining days.\n\nEmpress Augusta died somewhat unexpectedly on April 11, 1921, at Huis Doorn. Many feel that the abdication and then the suicide of her youngest son, Joachim, contributed to her death. Despite being in exile, Empress Augusta’s remains were returned to Germany and buried in the Antique Temple on the grounds of Sanssouci. Her husband was not allowed to attend, accompanying her coffin to the German border.\n\nHermine Reuss of Greiz\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Hermine Reuss of Greiz\n\nHermine was born December 17, 1887, the daughter of Heinrich XXII, Prince Reuss of Greiz and Princess Ida Mathilde of Schaumburg-Lippe. She was first married to Prince Johann of Schönaich-Carolath and had 5 children. After her first husband passed away, Hermine was introduced to the exiled German Emperor Wilhelm II in Doorn. From all accounts, a very mutual attraction developed and despite the objections of his children, she and Wilhelm married on November 5, 1922. Although they had no children together, Hermine’s youngest daughter, Henriette, married Wilhelm’s grandson, Prince Karl Franz (son of Prince Joachim).\n\nHermine returned to Germany after Wilhelm’s death and was later held under house arrest following World War II. She died in an Internment Camp near Brandenburg on August 7, 1947. She is buried at the Antique Temple on the grounds of Sanssouci."
