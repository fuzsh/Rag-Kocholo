She married a Prussian prince, then a prince of somewhere cause she got knocked up, and then the duke of Cumberland. It was because of the earlier rejection of Clarence that Queen Charlotte didn't like her, and the fact that she was perceived as having loose morals (getting knocked up) didn't help matters any.\n\nThe duke of Kent was considered for a while for Amalie of Baden (twin sister of the Bavarian queen) but Britain lost interest because Baden spun it out too long - her aunt in Berlin was attempting to arrange a marriage between Amalie and Friedrich Wilhelm III - so the match foundered. Amalie was again considered as a bride for Franz II after wife no. 2 died, but he found Ludovica Maria of Modena more to his taste and Amalie went back on the shelf. Amalie would make for fun times, since she'd be sister to the Bavarian queen (one of Napoléon's most stalwart allies), the Swedish queen, the Russian tsarina, as well as consorts in Brunswick and Hesse-Darmstadt. Plus, if her twin sister is anything to go by, she should emulate Mrs Jordan rather than Queen Adelaide in her childbearing capacity.\n\nOTL there was an attempted marriage between him and Friederike of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

Maybe Clarence ends up in a similar situation to his eldest brother - pressing debts, Parliament won't pay up unless he gets hitched, etc.\n\nWell, IIRC George was kinda batshit crazy by the 1800s, and both he and Charlotte liked some of their sons' live-in mistresses, but Mrs Jordan's an actress, so it's not unthinkable that at some point in the '90s George III says enough is enough.

But that might require one of her sisters to end up in London for some reason - I know the dchess of Brunswick and her Dutch daughter-in-law were staying at Branndenburg House at a point (Caroline of Brunswick had a nasty falling out with her motherdear during this residence). So if we alter it that it's her Badener daughter-in-law instead...\n\nWell Amalie travelled extensively from one sister to another OTL, so somehow she might even come to William.

Would this need to take place circa 1793/94?\n\nDuchess Therese of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n\nFriederike of Mecklenburg-Strelitz of Baden\n\nI like both your suggestions, however I believe that their is another \"Mecklenburg-Strelitz\" you have missed who could serve this story well, and she is the older sister of Friederike of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nLouise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n\n- Born just outside the capital in Hanover.\n\n- Her father Charles was brother to Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Queen of Great Britain; making him brother-in-law of George III\n\n- Her father was also field marshal of the household brigade in Hanover, and soon after Louise's birth he was made Governor-General of that territory by his George III, king of the United Kingdom and Hanover\n\n- Is 10 years and 7 months younger than William\n\n- Her paternal is first-cousin Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom (William's ) with the Princess serving as sponsors at her baptism; her second given name came from Princess Augusta Sophia\n\n- Described as a \"beautiful young woman, possessing \"an exquisite complexion\" and \"large blue eyes,\" and was naturally graceful\"\n\n- Is single up until 1793.\n\n- Although 14 in 1789, she could be kepts as a ward by George III and her aunt Charlotte until the age of marriage."
