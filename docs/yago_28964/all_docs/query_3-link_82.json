        "text": "Louise of Mecklenburg 1776-1810\n\nLouise, or also spelled Luise, was in full Louise Auguste Wilhelmine Amalie of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nLouise's Family\n\nLouise was the third daughter of Duke (German: Herzog) Karl Ludwig of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nLouise would become the mother of five princes and three princesses.\n\nLouise's Life\n\nLouise was born on March 10, 1776 at Hanover, Germany, where at the time her father was governor.\n\nHer mother died in 1782.\n\nIn 1785, Louise's father relocated his family to Darmstadt, where Louise's grandmother took care of her.\n\nFrom 1792 to 1793, Louise lived with her oldest sister Charlotte, the Duchess of Hildburghausen.\n\nOn July 14, 1792, Louise attended the coronation of Francis II at Frankfurt.\n\nOn December 24, 1793, Louise married the crown prince, the later King Frederick William III of Prussia.\n\nIn 1797, Frederick became king, and hence, Louise became Queen of Prussia.\n\nUpon outbreak of the War of the Fourth Coalition, Louise accompanied her husband to Naumburg, and, after the Battle of Jena, to Königsberg (Kaliningrad or Królewiec) and Memel (Klaipeda.)\n\nMost famous was her meeting with Napoleon at Tilsit on July 6, 1807, which did not render the results Louise had hoped for. And yes, Louise was a head taller than the French emperor. But then again, who wasn't.\n\nNapoleon Receives Queen Louise of Prussia at Tilsit\n\nPainting by Nicolas Louis Gosse\n\nIn 1808, Louise left Konigsberg and went to visit the imperial family at Petersburg, Russia, returning on December 23, 1809, to Berlin.\n\nIn 1810 she visited her father. While staying at the summer palace of Hohenzieritz, she took ill with a chest fever and died suddenly on July 19, 1910.\n\nHohenzieritz Castle\n\nPhoto Wiki\n\nOn July 27, 1810, Louise's body was brought to Berlin where she rests at the mausoleum of the Charlottenburg Castle. Her husband was buried next to her in 1840.\n\nLouise's Character and Personality\n\nLouise was loved and adored by pretty much everybody, rich and poor, because of her openness, kindness, and her always well-disposed nature. And yes, beauty helped.\n\nDue to the influence of his wife, Frederick is said to have been occasionally able to perform above his otherwise average capacity.\n\nLouise, the Queen of Prussia\n\nMore History"
