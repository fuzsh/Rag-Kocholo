        "text": "Among others of Ugo Tognazzi's superb, award-winning performances of his prolific career, this excellent Italian character star has been widely cherished for his classic comedy role of gay cabaret owner Renato Baldi, opposite Michel Serrault's hilariously mincing drag queen partner Alban, in La Cage aux Folles (1978) one of the biggest cross-over foreign hits to ever land on American soil.\n\nBorn Ottavio Tognazzi in Cremona, Italy, on March 23, 1922, by the time Ugo was a teen he was a bookkeeper for a salami factory and performed in local amateur theatricals on the sly. Appearing on the stage, he finally found an entry into films at age 28 in 1950 with a featured role in the war comedy I cadetti di Guascogna (1950). He built up a solid comedy resume in primarily Neapolitan 50's features including La paura fa 90 (1951) (his first co-starring role), Café chantant (1953), I milanesi a Napoli (1954), La moglie è uguale per tutti (1955), Sunday Is Always Sunday (1958), The Woman's Confidant (1959) and Tipi da spiaggia (1959).\n\nUgo became a middle-aged European star the following decade. Turning in a number of powerhouse character studies, he excelled as bon vivants, adulterous husbands and other suave gents in primarily farcical comedy and saucy, sardonic romps, particularly those of director/writer Marco Ferreri. He also demonstrated a remarkable range when it came to portraying world-weary protagonists in political drama or grim satire. For Ferreri alone, he appeared in the award-winning The Conjugal Bed (1963), Countersex (1964), The Wedding March (1966), L'udienza (1972) and the masterful The Big Feast (1973), among others.\n\nIn 1978, Tognazzi decided to take a chance, and play a character unlike anything he had done, (and, also, rarely done, for fear of being 'stereotyped'), and co-starred with the wonderful Michel Serrault in an image-shattering part in 1978. What he did was experience the most popular role of his career as one-half of an aging gay couple who operate a drag club. La Cage aux Folles (1978) went on to spawn two sequels and an American remake (The Birdcage (1996) starring Robin Williams (in the Tognazzi role) and Nathan Lane (in the diva Serrault part).\n\nTognazzi won several acting honors over the course of his long career. He copped several European awards for his classic roles in The Monsters (1963) (The Monsters), I Knew Her Well (1965), The Climax (1967) (also a rare foreign Golden Globe nomination), La bambolona (1968), Police Chief Pepe (1969), Lady Caliph (1970) and Duck in Orange Sauce (1975). He capped it off with the Cannes Film Festival award for his trenchant performance in Tragedy of a Ridiculous Man (1981), the tale of a near-bankrupt factory owner who attempts to use the kidnapping of his son (played by his real-life eldest son Ricky Tognazzi) to his financial advantage. Tognazzi was also the father of actor Gianmarco Tognazzi and director Maria Sole Tognazzi, and had another son, producer/writer Thomas Robsahm, via a relationship with actress Margrete Robsahm.\n\nIn the eighties, Tognazzi focused strongly on the theater and starred in such plays as Luigi Pirandello's \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\" (1986, directed by Jean-Pierre Vincent in Paris, Théâtre de l' Europe) and Molière's \"The Miser\" (1989, where he sparked a controversy in Italian government circles when he improvised lines about corruption in high places during his performance). Although he directed himself in a handful of his own often sexually explicit films, including The Seventh Floor (1967) and Dismissed on His Wedding Night (1968), Ugo's true brilliance shines in front of the camera and in the works of other famed European directors, notably Ferrari, Bernardo Bertolucci, Pietro Germi, Dino Risi and Mario Monicelli. He worked up until the end with incisive starring performances in Goodbye and Thank You (1988), Days of Inspector Ambrosio (1988), Tolérance (1989) and La batalla de los Tres Reyes (1990) (The Battle of the Three Kings). In 1972, at age 50, Tognazzi wed actress Franca Bettoia, who survives him. He died of a brain hemorrhage in 1990, age 68."
