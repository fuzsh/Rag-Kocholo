Mankiewicz’s “Guys and Dolls” (1955) and Francois Truffaut’s “Baisers voles” (Stolen Kisses, 1968).\n\nThe section is devoted to classic films that have been restored over the past year by film archives, cultural institutions or production companies, and documentaries about cinema and its auteurs.

Restored by Sony Pictures Entertainment in collaboration with the Cineteca di Bologna, the film is drawn from the collection of Historic Archives of the Contemporary Arts (ASAC).\n\nOther films include “The Innocents” (1961) by Jack Clayton, “The Tragedy of Macbeth” (1971) by Roman Polanski, “Umberto D.” (1952) by Vittorio De Sica, “L’udienza” (Papal Audience, 1971) by Marco Ferreri, and “Una giornata particolare” (A Special Day, 1977) by Ettore Scola.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nFilm director Giuliano Montaldo (“Sacco & Vanzetti,” “And Agnes Chose to Die,” “The Gold-Rimmed Glasses”) will chair the jury of film students, who have been selected from various Italian universities."
