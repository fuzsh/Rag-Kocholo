        "text": "The festival’s previously announced section dedicated to cinematic reflections of the work of Franz Kafka has now been finalized. The retrospective section honoring the famous Prague native, The Wish to Be a Red Indian: Kafka and Cinema, will show thirteen feature films, four medium-length films, and five shorts.\n\nThe originally announced selection has been expanded to include an exclusive programme dedicated to David Lynch’s lifelong love for the work of Franz Kafka. One block of films will include the surrealistic short film The Grandmother, which Lynch made in 1970 with financial support from the American Film Institute, as well as the third episode of the third season of the cult series Twin Peaks, which most intensely reflects the admiration of one peculiar genius for another.\n\nOne of the best-known works in the rich filmography of the legendary radical duo of film intellectuals Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet is Class Relations (1984), an adaptation of Kafka’s unfinished novel Amerika.\n\nA decade later, in his first time in the director’s chair, British actor Peter Capaldi shot Franz Kafka’s It’s a Wonderful Life. This playful and original short film depicting Kafka struggling with writer’s block won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.\n\nThe half-hour K is also a debut film, shot by the multifaceted Italian artist Lorenza Mazzetti while she was living in the UK. Made in 1954, the film – considered a forerunner to the UK’s famous Free Cinema movement – is the oldest title in the festival’s Kafka programme.\n\nThe complete list of films in the retrospective:\n\nThe Grandmother (dir.
