Mario Sesti, one of the Rome Film Festival’s founders and the artistic director at Sicily’s Taormina Film Festival, oversees the Cinema at the MAXXI initiative.\n\nSTORY: Rome Film Festival Unveils Complete Lineup\n\nMarra’s latest film, L’amministratore, will open the CinemaXXI section at the Nov. 8-17 Rome festival, which, like Cinema at the MAXXI, will be housed in Rome’s celebrated MAXXI Museum for 21st-Century art.\n\nBoth Cinema at the MAXXI and the Rome Film Festival are run under the auspices of the Cinema for Rome Foundation, headed by former Warner Bros. Italia head Paolo Ferrari.\n\nThe retrospective will include four films: Estranei alla massa, winner of the Pier Paolo Pasolini honor from the Locarno Film Festival in 2002 and a special mention from the jury at the Turin Film Festival; The Session is Open (L’udienza è aperta) which screened at the 2006 Venice Days section at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for the David di Donatello honor as best Italian documentary; Il grande progetto, which screened in competition at the 2008 Turin Film Festival; and Il gemello, which appeared in Venice Days and earned a special mention at Italy’s Silver Ribbons (Nastri d’Argento) honors."
