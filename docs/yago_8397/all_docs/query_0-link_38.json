This goal was reached thanks to contributions from 125 donors, not only from Italy but also from abroad, who believe in the restoration of one of the great forgotten films in the history of cinema.   The film’s restoration can therefore begin thanks to this sum, and it will be presented at the upcoming Venice Film Festival in the Venezia Classici section.",

This is the excellent result for the first crowdfunding project by the National Cinema Museum in Turin, aiming at restoring Marco Ferreri’s film L’udienza.\n\nThis goal was reached thanks to contributions from 125 donors, not only from Italy but also from abroad, who believe in the restoration of one of the great forgotten films in the history of cinema.\n\nThe film’s restoration can therefore begin thanks to this sum, and it will be presented at the upcoming Venice Film Festival in the Venezia Classici section.\n\nAchieving of this result is important and donations keep arriving. The decision to extend the deadline for the collection of donations until 25 July has been taken for all those who still wish to contribute to this initiative, thus allowing us to get even closer to our target.\n\nThe success of this campaign featured social networks as its protagonists.\n\nOver 1,050,000 people were reached through Facebook, in addition to 1,147,000 contacts through Twitter.\n\nThe www.makingof.itwebsite was visited by over 12,000 users, totalling 15,000 visits, and a person out of one hundred decided to contribute to the funds collection.\n\n“This is a great result - declared Alberto Barbera, the Director of the National Cinema Museum – and donations keep coming in. This is why we decided to extend the deadline for another couple of weeks, in order to allow everyone to make their contribution.”"
