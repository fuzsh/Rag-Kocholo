She was promoted by producer Franco Cristaldi, who carefully guided her every move in regard to the cinema, and later married her.\n\nCardinale was discovered during the era when Brigitte Bardot created one sensation after another both on screen and off. Cardinale could merely have become \"the Italian Bardot,\" and, indeed comparisons have been drawn between the two actresses. But a number of factors helped lead Cardinale's career in a different direction. The publicity surrounding both Cardinale's films and her personal life was not nearly as sensational as that concerning Bardot. More importantly, Cardinale soon began appearing in the films of the major Italian auteurs. Minor, and later more substantial, roles in the films of Mario Monicelli, Mauro Bolognini, Luchino Visconti, and Federico Fellini made her a star in Italy and abroad.\n\nWhile many of Bardot's films are now known simply because she is in them, Cardinale's films are often important works in the careers of their respective directors. For example, she appeared in Monicelli's best-known comedy (Big Deal on Madonna Street), co-starred in a fine series of films for Bolognini (Il bell'Antonio, La viaccia, and Senilità), and gained critical and popular recognition for her role as the fiancée of the eldest brother in Visconti's Rocco and His Brothers. She appeared in multiple roles in Fellini's 8½, one of her most memorable films.\n\nIn these films, Cardinale's characters were, more often than not, portrayed as glamorous sex objects, not unlike Bardot. The variations each director introduced in the presentation of Cardinale in this type of character, however, prove interesting. In 8½ she plays Claudia, herself, as well as the ideal woman of Guido's dreams. Outside the immediate narrative context of the film, her character becomes a symbol for Fellini of unspoiled, yet unattainable, innocence. Though beautiful and sensuous, she is not crassly sexual.\n\nLater, in Leone's Once upon a Time in the West, Cardinale portrays Jill McBain, the new bride of murdered settler Brett McBain. Again, her character could be described as the object desired by the male figures in the film, but Jill McBain signifies much more within the context of the film's complex narrative, and within the genre of the Western itself. She represents the forces of civilization, as female characters often do in Westerns. The final scene depicts Jill providing water to the thirsty workers building the railroad (that other symbol of the taming of the west), implying that Jill will fulfill her husband's dream of running a railroad station. Her past life as a prostitute in New Orleans, however, recalls the less than desirable elements of civilization, which will inevitably follow the settlers. In this film, as in 8½, Cardinale's character carries symbolic, almost mythic connotations.\n\nCardinale made her American film debut in Blake Edwards's very popular The Pink Panther, securing her international star status. Other American films, such as The Professionals, followed. During the 1970s and 1980s, however, Cardinale made most of her films in Italy and Europe. Many were not distributed in America or suffered from limited distribution, thereby reducing Cardinale's international exposure. Three 1980's roles, in Liliana Cavani's La pelle (well-received at Cannes), in Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo, and Diane Kurys's A Man in Love, have again focused attention on her as she enters a more mature phase of her life and career.\n\n—Susan M.
