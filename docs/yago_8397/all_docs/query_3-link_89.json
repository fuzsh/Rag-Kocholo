This hugely popular product was created in 1874 in Florence by the pharmacist Henry Roberts.\n\nThere’s a bottle of Roberts rosewater on Claudia Cardinale’s dressing table. The film director, Luchino Visconti, was sitting by her side, checking her hairstyle. The picture was taken by Angelo Frontoni on the set of Il Gattopardo."
