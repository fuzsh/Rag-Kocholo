There are a variety of different people who are getting in his way, and some perhaps on his side… although it is very hard to tell as I have no idea about what happened.\n\nIt’s absurd and confusing yet I quite liked it. The cinematography (recently restored) is beautiful and I quite liked the characters even though they often treat each other quite badly – there is a lot of passionate slapping and the like. So odd. And funny. But mostly odd."
