The Turin National Cinema Museum will be present at the 71st Venice Film festival (27 August - 6 September 2014) with three important restorations.

The films are presented in Venezia Classici, the section dedicated to the highlighting of restorations and documentaries on cinema carried out or made over the past year by worldwide film archives and cultural institutions: Todo modo by Elio Petri (Italy/France, 1976, 125’, colour), in the restored version carried out by the Bologna Film Archive and the Turin National Cinema Museum in collaboration with Surf Film, and L’udienza by Marco Ferreri (Italy/France, 1971, 112’, colour), in the restored version carried out by the Bologna Film Archive and the Turin National Cinema Museum in collaboration with Cristaldi Film.

The restoration of L’udienza was possible thanks to the crowdfunding campaign on the MakingOf.it website and massive communication activated on all the National Cinema Museum social networks.

The screening of Todo Modo will take place on 2 September, while the film L’udienza will be presented on Saturday 30 August 2014.

The National Cinema Museum will also be present on Tuesday 26 August (at 8.15 p.m.) for the pre-opening of the 71st Venice Film Festival at the Lido of Venice inside the restyled DARSENA CINEMA for the special evening dedicated to the city, with the premiere of MACISTE ALPINO (1916) by Luigi Maggi and Luigi Romano Borgnetto in a new restored version, for the occasion of the Great War Centenary.

Directing supervised by Giovanni Pastrone (Cabiria) and live music accompaniment by jazzman Raffaele Casarano with his Locomotive quartet.

This is the first public screening at the Darsena Cinema following its restoration over the past months.

The reconstruction and digital restoration of the original version were carried out by the Venice Biennale in collaboration with the Turin National Cinema Museum, at L’Immagine Ritrovata Laboratory in Bologna.
