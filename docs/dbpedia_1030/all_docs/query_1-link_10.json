Postage PAID West, TX 76691 Permit No. 39 VOLUME 62 NUMBER 4 The President’s Corner Troopers it’s your President and it is that time of the month. The 1st <strong>Cavalry</strong> <strong>Division</strong> <strong>Association</strong> just held our annual Reunion here at The Great Place - Fort Hood, Texas. The <strong>First</strong> Team did a great job making everyone feel welcome. The ‘Spirit of the CAV’ show on the Cooper Field was well done and I thought everyone that attended enjoyed it. I personally thank all our Troopers both active and inactive who joined us for our annual get-together. Those of you who wish to make our 66th Reunion in Chi- Town get your reservation in early. The hotel will begin taking reservations in late <strong>July</strong> and our registration information will be coming out with the calendars and will be in the November/December Saber and on the web page. Once again, thanks to Dennis and his staff for all they do, plus all the Board members for their time and support of your <strong>Association</strong>. A special thanks to Lorinda Davison who will be retiring from the <strong>Association</strong> at the end of <strong>August</strong>. Good luck to all of you and God speed until we see each other again. Jerry F. Eller, 808 S. 2nd St., Killeen, TX 76541-7703, (254) 526-6400, THE DIRECTOR’S CHAIR Dennis E. Webster 302 N.

Their vision has resulted in our <strong>Association</strong> celebrating our 69th year of existence this year. The <strong>Association</strong> was incorporated in Washington, DC in 1949 and has welcomed each successive generation of 1st <strong>Cavalry</strong> <strong>Division</strong> Veterans into its ranks. Very few of the Charter Members of the <strong>Association</strong> that started our organization are still with us. If you have the opportunity to thank them for their service and for having the foresight to form the <strong>Association</strong>, please do that. It will be the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Korean Armistice on 27 <strong>July</strong>. We also honor our Veterans of what is known as the “Forgotten War”. Our 66th Annual Reunion went very well but we had a smaller group of Veterans at this year’s shindig than in previous years. What we lacked in quantity we made up for in quality and we had a great time. I want to thank Marietta Gamble for presenting a lovely quilt to me that was signed by many of the <strong>Association</strong> members. Marietta keeps things going and I appreciate her for more than the quilt. Many of you know about “Sequestration” but if you don’t live in an area with a military base you may not know how it affects life in the military. Due to budget cuts brought about by the inaction of our Congress and the Administration, civilian workers on Fort Hood are being furloughed one day a week resulting in a 20% reduction in their pay and reduced services on post. How is sequestration affecting the <strong>Association</strong> you ask? The 1st <strong>Cavalry</strong> <strong>Division</strong> Museum is now closed every Friday until the end of October and likely into the next fiscal year. That means no one gets in the building and that includes people visiting Fort Hood and the workers in the Crossed Sabers Chapter Souvenir Shop that is located in the museum. The Museum Director, Steve Draper, asked for permission to keep the museum open on Friday but was told no by the Center of Military History which oversees the Army’s museums. The loss of one of our busiest days for people walking into the museum and shopping in the Souvenir Shop will reduce the money they generate to provide donations to the <strong>Association</strong> that provides travel funds to send active duty Troopers to our reunions away from Fort Hood and helps fund our Foundation which provides scholarships to the children of our KIA’s or totally and permanently disabled. There are other impacts on the military community not mentioned. Continued on pg. 9. DIVISION DOINGS JULY/AUGUST, 2013 May and June brought extreme excitement and enthusiasm to the Horse <strong>Cavalry</strong> Detachment. For starters, Soldiers have been keeping their warrior skills sharp by engaging in weapons training, physical fitness and institutional education. Harker Heights Stars and Stripes Parade This training was highly displayed at the M4 firing ranges, physical fitness test and Non-Commissioned Officer Education Schools where troopers excelled unlike no other. After sustaining our military skills, we continued to provide enjoyment and exhilaration to the local community through our outreach program and other social events. During May’s Distinguished Soldier Welcome Ceremony on Cooper Field, we welcomed in the new <strong>Division</strong> Commanding General-Support, BG Joseph Martin and bid farewell to <strong>Division</strong> Commanding General- Maneuver; BG Thomas James as he continues his decorated career at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas. We would like to welcome BG Martin to the 1st <strong>Cavalry</strong> <strong>Division</strong> Family and bid farewell BG James, thank you for your support to the Horse Detachment. The month of May also brought the Killeen Rodeo into town and the Horse <strong>Cavalry</strong> Detachment had the opportunity to perform our demonstration for more than 2,000 military families for the rodeo’s Military Appreciation night. This is the trooper’s favorite performance because of the overwhelming support we get from the city of Killeen, as well as the great audience participation during the event. This year’s Killeen rodeo was also the last public performance for Trooper Abernathy, Sergeant Jessie Hurst, Sergeant Janessa Kabela and Sergeant Marion Kelley. We would like to wish them good luck and thank them for the blood, sweat and tears they’ve given to the Horse Detachment. To wrap up a week full of events, we also participated in the Harker Heights Stars and Stripes Parade and had an opportunity to ride with two of 1st <strong>Cavalry</strong> <strong>Division</strong>’s senior leaders, Chief of Staff COL Robert B. Akam and the <strong>Division</strong> Command Sergeant Major; CSM James Norman. We closed out the month of May getting ready for the reunion. The month of June brought us numerous ceremonies that we’ve had a privilege to participate in. We started the month with the 66th Annual 1st <strong>Cavalry</strong> <strong>Division</strong> Continued on pg. 3. The following stories have been written by the 1st <strong>Cavalry</strong> <strong>Division</strong> Public Affairs office to provide an overview of some of the <strong>First</strong> Team’s recent activities.
