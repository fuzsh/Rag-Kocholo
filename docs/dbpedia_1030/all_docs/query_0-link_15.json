Letter ffomltieSecreiorij of the Novij For more than 224 years, the U.S. Navy has promoted security and stability around the world. Together with the Marine Corps, we have been “always there . . .for America.” This year’s “Owner’s and Operator’s Manual” helps to explain how we remain ready to do that; to be there for whatever we are asked to do — ultimately, to fight and win. Throughout this past year our great Navy, together with the Marine Corps and our sister services, has answered the call again and again, while forward deployed around the world in support of U.S. national security objectives. Whether conducting successful combat operations in Kosovo and Iraq, or complex humanitarian operations in the wake of natural disasters; whether supporting our friends and allies in joint and combined exercises, or responding with dazzling accuracy to counter terrorists even deep within land-locked areas; it is our amazing Sailors, together with leading-edge technology and an effective strategy, that make things happen with unquestioned success. As we enter the next century, we fore- see many new security challenges, and we know there will be others that we cannot foresee. The Navy’s task will be to remain ready in the face of those challenges. During the past year, we have begun to secure that future, in many ways, aiming to transform this great institution and the Sailors who will lead it. Tomorrow’s Sailor will harness and use remarkable technologies that we are now developing. F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets and Joint Strike Fighters will fly from the decks of the next generation air- craft carriers. The DD 21 land attack destroyer will support carrier battle groups, and provide littoral warfare capa- bilities and fire support for our amphibi- ous ready groups with tremendous preci- sion. Virginia-Class submarines will have great intelligence and land attack capabil- ities. Communications networks will tie combat capabilities together and enable our forces to achieve a new level of battle space dominance. Even with advanced capabilities, the single most important factor for the continued suc- cess of our Navy remains the Sailor. Today’s Sailor is versatile and creative, with the same qualities of honor, courage and commitment that are the hallmarks of our Navy. Sailors work hard, accept huge responsibilities and expect success, both personally and professionally. They develop and lead others. And whether they invest a career or just one tour of duty, the Navy experience stays with them forever. We are building Sailors for the next millennium — technologically savvy, highly motivated, and prepared to meet the challenges of the future. We are focused on recruiting and retaining the highest quality men and women, giving them the tools and the opportunities to succeed. The Navy is right now trans- forming what it means to serve this Nation, in the exciting times ahead. As a result, I have every confidence that the Navy will remain “always there” for America in the 21st century. This edition of All Hands is loaded with information about the people, the technology, and the programs that define the Navy of today, and tomorrow. I think you’ll find it informative and interesting. My hope is that it will inspire you to take the time to express your interest and appreciation for your Navy — and your Sailors — in the year ahead.

JANUARY 2000 15 A Navy (and Navy-related) sites can be extremely useful when Sailors want to expand their knowledge of ships, aircraft and weapons systems as well as those commands and areas of the world where they might be stationed next.

We’ve attempted to list sites relating to as many areas of Navy life as possible (and most of them have links to other sites). The list was accurate at press time.

That is the question. And the answer can be difficult to come by, especially among first- and second-term Sailors. The oath of reenlistment carries with it a commitment - a commitment to serve. And while that service has its rewards, it also has its hardships. The Navy is committed to keeping the best Sailors “on board.” The following incentive programs (which are detailed in Chapter 8 of the Enlisted Transfer Manual) are designed to do just that. For complete descriptions and provisions of these programs. Sailors should contact their Command Career Counselors. Seamen to Hdmirol Proyram The Seaman-to- Admiral Program (STA) provides outstanding enlisted personnel in the Navy, Naval Reserve (TAR) and USNR-R with an exceptional education and commissioning opportunity. Selectees will be ordered to one of seven Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) -affiliated universities on permanent change of station orders. After earning a baccalaureate degree and on successful completion of Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Pensacola, Fla., they will be appointed as a perma- nent ensign, USNR. Interested Sailors must submit their applications to Commander, Navy Personnel Command (NPC 811), Naval Support Activity Memphis, 5720 Integrity Drive, Millington, Tenn. 38055-8110, via their commanding officer before July 1 of each year. The Seaman-to-Admiral Selection Board will convene at Navy Personnel Command each September to consider applicants who meet eligibility require- ments published by NAVADMIN. Applicants are required to complete the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) or American College Test (ACT). For details on the SAT or ACT, contact your local Navy Campus Office. When preparing to submit their application package, interested Sailors are strongly encouraged to assemble the following documents: college tran- script(s) from each college attended; high school transcript(s) from each high school attended (if you have a GED Certificate and some high school, you will need to submit both the certificate and the partial high school transcript); SAT or ACT scores (must not be older than two years as of July 1 of the year applying); certified copies of evaluations; certified copies of PRT results; certified copies of special quali- fications documents; and a statement of desire for a commission. For additional information call DSN 922-4941 ext. 306 or Commercial (850) 452-4941 ext. 306, or send e-mail to cnet.sta@smtp.cnet.navy.mil. School llssignmeniQsoileenlisliTienI Incenlive Some Sailors place specific training desires above ultimate duty stations. For them, a set of orders with a school en route is the greater good. The program requirements include: ■ Must be willing to incur additional obhgated service in exchange for training. ■ Must maintain minimum perfor- mance standards. ■ Must provide some assurance that the training received will be effec- tively used. For instance, a skill gained through training which can only be used at sea will not be provided for someone heading to shore duty. Likewise, a chief petty officer won’t be assigned to a school whose training is intended for use by junior petty officers. Reference: Article 8.03, Enlisted Transfer Manual SCORE [Selective Conversion and Reenlistment) Program SCORE offers incentives to Sailors who wish to convert to undermanned (CREO 1) ratings. SCORE incentives include: assignment to Class “A” and, if available. Class “C” schools; possible advancement to third or second class petty officer; and, if eligible. Selective Reenhstment Bonus (SRB). The program requirements include: ■ Must be presently assigned in a rating listed as Category 2 or 3 in the most current CREO listing. ■ Must be in pay grades E-3 through E-6. ■ Must meet requirements for entrance to appropriate schools. ■ Must have maintained sustained superior performance in their present rating. ■ Can not have received previous benefits from the STAR, SCORE or RESCORE programs. Reference: Article 1060010, Military Personnel Manual RESCORE [Recruiling Selective Conversion ond Reenlistment) Program The RESCORE Program offers similar incentives as SCORE for Navy Veterans (NAVETS) who reenlist after a 24-hour break in service. Reference: Article 106001 1, Military Personnel Manual (MILPERSMAN) SIRR [Selective Training and Reenlistment) Program Under the STAR Program, Sailors can receive a career designation and become eligible for the following incentives: ■ Guaranteed assignment to Class “A” or “C” school. ■ Guaranteed advancement to third or second class petty officer upon completion of required schools or training packages. ■ Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB), if eligible. The program requirements include: ■ Must be a designated striker (E-3) or second or third class petty officer. ■ Must have at least 2 1 months and not more than six years of contin- uous naval service. Veterans of other services cannot have more than eight years of total military service. ■ Must meet minimum performance requirements and have a clear mili- tary record.
