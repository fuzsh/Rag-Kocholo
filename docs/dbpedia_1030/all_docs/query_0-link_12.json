The United States provided the bulk of the forces arrayed against Iraq, with the U.S. Army contributing the greatest portion of the ground force. Successful participation in this historic endeavor marked both an end and a beginning for the Army At an end was the long and some¬ times arduous transition from the Vietnam-era Army. What emerged was a small, superbly equipped, highly skilled, well-trained, and extremely mobile force, composed of units from both the active and reserve com¬ ponents. Its overall excellent performance in Southwest Asia reflected the attention that successive Army Chiefs of Staff had paid to leader development — the effort to professionalize the service’s officer and non¬ commissioned officer corps. In this major test, the Army clearly demon¬ strated that it could project its power effectively. One of the resounding lessons for the Army in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm was that it could operate as part of a multinational force with great suc¬ cess. Even as these operations were taking place, the Army addressed those steps necessary to prepare for its critical role as a key member of America’s armed forces of the future. The Whirlwind War tells the story of this pivotal chapter in the Army’s history. It shows the various strands that came together to pro¬ duce the Army of the 1990s and how that Army in turn performed under fire and in the glare of world attention. Drafted soon after the end of Operation Desert Storm, the book retains a sense of immediacy in its approach. Yet the manuscript also went through a series of reviews, and the maps were subsequently carefully researched and compiled as original documents in their own right. The result is a vol¬ ume that takes its place in the first round of the historical analysis of the events described. More definitive studies will undoubtedly follow, as ever more documents are assessed. But this book is intended to bridge that gap, and I commend it to all readers interested in the cur¬ rent and future role of American ground forces. Washington, D.C.

We hope that this study will fill an immediate need by charting the major changes in the Army since the Vietnam years, by showing the scope of the Army’s involvement in the Gulf war, and by highlighting the most significant aspects of that participation, to the extent that we could recognize them just after the war. The initial draft of the manuscript was completed by a team of histo¬ rians late in 1991, less than one year after the war ended. With one exception, all of the authors were employed at the U.S. Army Center of Military History The team was divided nearly evenly between civilian and uniformed historians. This work is based on such sources as were immediately available to the authors. Members of the team used a broad range of official documents and interviews as well as press accounts in assembling this narrative. Each author created a specialized collection of records and other materials according to the needs of each section and the individual author’s approach to research. Unless otherwise indicated in the notes, all of the unpublished documents cited remain on file at the Center of Military History We do not consider this work definitive. As more documentation becomes available and the passage of time provides different perspec¬ tives, other researchers will probe more fully some of the topics and issues mentioned in this book. In fact, it is already plain that questions we did not even raise are becoming the focus of considerable discus¬ sion and analysis. Nevertheless, we hope that this volume adequately explains the broad outlines of Army participation in the war and shows the way to further research. Our involvement in this project was very gratifying. We thank Brig. Gen. Harold W Nelson, Chief of Military History, 1989-1994, for the opportunity to participate in this endeavor. We also thank the authors and the numerous others without whom it would have been impossible to do the book so quickly or to do it well. We have tried to list in our acknowl¬ edgments all of the people who helped, knowing that such mention is in many cases inadequate, but we are indebted to so many people that we saw no reasonable alternative. We alone are responsible for any errors. The views expressed in this book are those of the authors and do not reflect the official policy or position of the Department of Defense or the U.S. government. FRANK N. SCHUBERT THERESA L.

It’s not going to be like Vietnam. It’s going to be like nothing you’ve ever seen.” General John R. Galvin Stars and Stripes 30 December 1990 Chapter 1 Background To War The geopolitical problems, border disputes, tribal rivalries, uneven eco¬ nomic growth, and lack of social and political reforms within the Persian Gulf nations are largely the result of developments in Southwest Asia since World War 1. The collapse of the Ottoman Empire during the war and the discovery of oil in the Gulf region created the conditions not only for internal chaos but also for external competition among the world’s most powerful nations for control of those immense oil resources. Late twentieth-century developments in the area are the direct result of that big power rivalry and its effect on the political development of the states involved. Emergence of the Post-World War I Persian Gulf States ^ Christine Moss Helms, Iraq: Eastern Flank of the Arab World (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1984), pp. 42, 44-45; Paul D. Wolfowitz, \"Remarks on the Conclusion of the Gulf War,” American-Arab Affairs, no. 35 (Winter 1990-91): 6; Phebe Marr, The Modem History of Iraq (Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press, 1985), p. 1. With the defeat of the Central Powers during World War 1, the Ottoman Empire quickly disintegrated. While the United States watched, the European members of the victorious allied coalition, France and Great Britain, reshaped the pieces into spheres of influence, drew boundaries, and set up dynasties. The years immediately after the war saw the emergence of a spate of new Middle Eastern kingdoms and protectorates. At least twelve of the new political entities that emerged on the Arabian Peninsula after World War I faced problems regarding acceptance of their borders by native inhabitants as well as neighbors. Many tradi¬ tional tribal and ethnic areas, including regions crossed by nomads, were disrupted by the post-World War I borders. At least twenty-two boundary disputes developed in the region after the war, with armed conflict arising at least twenty-one times and some disputes being settled only to erupt anew. Overlapping claims to grazing land or water, interfamily rivalries, and assertions of historical rights by aggrieved groups all worked against peaceful negotiations. In Iraq’s case, the border with Kuwait was one of a number of areas in dispute. Conflicts over the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia lasted until 1975, as did border disputes with Iran. The Iraqi-Jordanian border remained in dispute until 1984.^ 4 Whirlwind War Map 1 Great Britain was the most active of the European imperial powers in the establishment of nations and dynasties. On 18 December 1914, Britain declared Egypt a protectorate, making that country nominally indepen¬ dent. The British also set up monarchies for the offspring of their former ally, the Hashemite Sherif Hussein ibn Ali of Mecca, who had been deposed during the consolidation of Saud family rule in Arabia. They established a protectorate called Iraq and enthroned one son, Feisal, there. They also split off Transjordan (later Jordan), the portion of Palestine that lay east of the Jordan River, from the western part between the river and the Mediterranean Sea, and installed Eeisal’s brother Abdullah on the throne. In the western portion the British committed themselves to establishment of a national home for Jews. The flurry of coronations ignored only the Backbhounb to War S David Fromkin, A Peace To End AH Peace: Creating the Modern Middle East 19M-1922 (New York: Henry Holt and Co., 1989), p. 560.

Kurdish independence had been on the wartime agenda of the allies, who now decided to postpone action.^ The British adopted a pragmatic approach to control of the region. Because of the immense oil potential and important pipeline and trans¬ portation routes, political stability was paramount. The best way to achieve that goal was through the establishment of indigenous constitu¬ tional monarchies, buttressed and dominated by Britain under the cloak of League of Nations mandates. That approach proved less costly than direct rule (Map I).^ The Great War had changed things, underlining the importance of oil for the continued power and prosperity of the industrial world. As early as 1914 the government of Great Britain, quicker than other industrial pow¬ ers to see the potential importance of oil, had already become majority owner of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which controlled major oil fields in Persia. Postwar competition for oil, which pitted France against Britain and later drew in the United States, would go beyond mere com¬ mercial rivalries. At stake was the future of the West. The effort to recon¬ struct the Persian Gulf region represented the beginnings of a global power struggle to secure the oil resources of the Middle East.\"^ Initially the contest for Middle Eastern oil focused largely on Mesopotamia. The Great Power competition for concessions in neighbor¬ ing Persia had spread westward, stimulated by favorable prewar reports of Mesopotamian oil potential. In fact, one of the major factors in defining Iraq’s boundaries was the prospect of a secure pipeline as well as rail and air routes to Palestine and the Mediterranean. Together, Iraq and Transjordan formed a strategic corridor for Britain, linking the Persian Gulf and Anglo-Persian oil production to the British mandate of Palestine and the West. The route across northern Arabia seemed secure, with members of the Hashemite family on the Iraqi and Transjordanian thrones.^ In 1930 relations between Iraq and Great Britain underwent a basic change. A treaty widened Iraqi nominal independence considerably, although it left Britain with a major role in foreign policy and granted Britain base rights in Iraq. Still, in 1932 Iraq became the first former mandate to gain a seat in the League of Nations, and a British ambas¬ sador replaced the high commissioner.^ The first decade of nominal independence for Iraq coincided with a critical period in the development of the oil economies of the Persian Gulf region. In 1932 the Bahrain Petroleum Company struck oil on that rather obscure Gulf island. The modest discovery brought American oil interests in the form of Standard Oil of California (SOCAL) into the Gulf and, more significantly turned the attention of surveyors to the Arabian mainland, only 20 miles away, where the geological structure was identi¬ cal to that of Bahrain. The news was especially welcome in Kuwait, where the economy faced ruin as the Japanese success with artificially cultivated pearls destroyed the demand for natural pearls brought up by Whirlwind War B ^ Yergin, The ?nze, pp. 283, 292-94. ®Ibid.,pp. 291,297, 300. ^ Francis Robinson, Atlas of the Islamic World Since 1500 (New York: Facts on File, 1982), p. 158; Marr, Modern History of Iraq, pp, 86-87.

Kuwait desperately needed new sources of income, and the oil discoveries held out hope for the future.^ The rest of the decade saw a succession of oil discoveries and agree¬ ments. In May 1933 Standard Oil and Saudi Arabia signed a concession for exploiting local petroleum deposits. In the next year, the Kuwait Oil Company, a joint company formed by Gulf Oil Corporation of the United States and the British Petroleum Company of Great Britain, made a simi¬ lar deal with the emir of Kuwait. The first big strikes in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia came in 1938. The interdependence of the industrialized world with the oil economies of the Persian Gulf was just beginning.® World War II and the Persian Gulf Region World War II sped up the process by which the former parts of the Ottoman Empire became nation-states. After that war, and especially after the loss of India in 1947, Great Britain’s priorities in the Gulf changed. It found the region no longer necessary as a military frontier to protect its Indian interests but hoped to maintain a presence in the region because of its growing economic involvement in the oil fields. In much of the Persian Gulf the change to nationhood was preceded by a period of more explicit Western control. In Iraq, Britain put down a wartime attempt to sever its control and depose the monarchy. British occupation of Iraq for the duration of the war followed. The United States too became directly involved in the Gulf as part of its effort to send supplies to the Soviet Union for the war against Germany^ When the United States Army occupied much of Iran and set up the Persian Gulf command in 1942, ignorance of the region was widespread among Americans, policy makers as well as the public. The War Department had no maps of Persia when the decision was made to move into the country, and the State Department’s Division of Near- Eastern Affairs had a staff of thirteen, only three of whom spoke some regional language. Initially there seemed little reason for concern. At the time, the United States produced over 60 percent of the world’s oil, and the Gulf region, including Iran, Iraq, and Arabian Peninsula, pumped only 5 percent. Wartime demands for oil began the long-term shift of the industry’s center of gravity from the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean to the Middle East, and Americans were quick to adjust. As U.S. interest in the region grew, European control began to wane. Both the winners and losers in the war were too weary to contest the Middle East’s drive for complete independence. Syria gained freedom from Erance in 1945. Jordan kept the Hashemite monarchy but broke its tie with Britain in 1946. In the most dramatic and traumatic act of nation-building of the period, the Jewish state of Israel emerged from the shambles of the Palestine mandate in 1948. The British decline in the region, under way from about the start of World War II, was gathering momentum. “ fi 1 v: % 7j Supply train in the Persian corridor en route to the Soviet Union, loaded with armored vehicles Yergin, The Pnze, pp. 463-64, 475, 477, 783.

The Rising Tide of Nationalism The 1950s evolved as a revolutionary decade in the Middle East. The first shock came in September 1951 when the Iranian government abruptly nationalized the former Anglo-Persian Oil Company — the oldest of the Western concessions. The change was brief. In 1954 the government of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh was overthrown with U.S. assistance, and a new consortium of Western companies took over the oil concession in October 1954. Americans dominated the new group, with substantial British and lesser French minority interests. The United States was emerging as the dominant Western influence in the region, particularly in the oil industry. Britain withdrew from Egypt in 1954, and two years later President Gamal Abdul Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, triggering an ill-con¬ ceived effort in 1956 by Britain and France, along with Israel, to destabi¬ lize and overthrow the Egyptian government. The Suez crisis may have taught Western powers much about the volatility of the Middle East, but it also confirmed Middle Eastern suspicions of foreign imperialism. Also in 1956 the youthful Hashemite King Hussein of Jordan dis¬ missed the British commander of his army In 1958 Egypt and Syria formed the short-lived United Arab Republic, a brief experiment in Pan-Arabism. The revolutionary tide reached Iraq in the same year. A bloody military uprising overthrew Hussein’s relatives and revoked the alliance with Britain. 8 WHiRLWiNn War ''' Marr, Modem History of Iraq, pp. 123, 125, 153; Yergin, The Prize, p. 509.

The 1958 coup by elements of the Iraqi armed forces known as “the Free Officers” brought Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim to power. Qasim replaced a regime that had never built viable political institu¬ tions to sustain its rule and depended, much like the late Ottoman regime, on the army and bureaucracy as well as family and personal ties for support. Although the work of a small group, the coup reflected widespread discontent with the monarchy’s foreign policy, particularly the strong ties to the West and the lack of domestic reform. The new regime’s agenda became clear when it demanded major revisions in the nation’s relationship with the Iraq Petroleum Company In Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East, oil became the focus of the Arab nationalist tide of the 1950s and 1960s. A 1957 conference of Arab oil experts broached the possibility of an organization of oil¬ exporting states. Three years later, in September 1960, those states cre¬ ated the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at a meeting in Baghdad, marking the start of a new period of growing assertiveness among oil producers in the Middle East.^^ Nationalizations of oil industries in Libya and Algeria followed as producing countries everywhere took on dominant roles in their relations with oil compa¬ nies, a transition that climaxed in the OPEC embargo of oil to the West during the October 1973 Arab-lsraeli War. By the 1960s the political order established by Britain in the Middle East had fallen apart. The British had created an imposing insti¬ tutional facade but had not put down many deep roots. Perhaps their most lasting legacy was an accelerated drive for modernization, financed by the revenues from the oil industry that they had helped nurture. With an overall colonial policy that envisioned gradual con¬ version of colonies to membership in the Commonwealth, the British had also encouraged indigenous involvement in public administration and created the context in which the nationalist movements could develop. liowever, this gradualist approach ultimately foundered in the face of Arab and Jewish nationalism. In 1969, already long preoccupied with its economic problems, Britain announced its intent to withdraw its remaining forces from the Middle East. Two years later, the last British troops left Aden at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, leaving the region devoid of the sometimes unwelcome stabilizing power that Great Britain had provided.^® The Qasim Regime and the Kuwaiti Border The 1958 coup marked the beginning of political instability in Iraq. Despite economic and social reforms, Qasim alienated Arab nationalists as well as Western conservatives. He angered the United States by his flir¬ tations with communism and the British by his oil policy Syria and Egypt resented his harsh treatment of domestic opponents, who included the members of the new Ba’th, or Renaissance, party. That group, initially Background to War 9 Map 2 organized in Syria just after World War II, combined in its program the two main threads of Arab political thought, Pan-Arabism and radical social change. The Ba’th’s tight cellular organization made the party one of the most effective political groups in the region. Disturbed by the growing prominence of Communists in Qasim’s government and the fail¬ ure of a nationalist anti-Communist uprising in northern Iraq, Ba’th lead¬ ers concluded that Qasim had to go.^^ The growing internal and external opposition to the Qasim govern¬ ment reached its climax in 1961. During that year, a revolt among the Kurds in northern Iraq gave the Ba’th allies in its struggle with the regime. u^rr, Modern History of Iraq, pp. but even more serious was Qasim’s reaction to Kuwaiti independence.

Whiriwinb War between Kuwait and the Ottoman Empire. However, the outbreak of the World War kept the Ottoman government from formally ratifying the agreement. Iraq accepted that demarcation upon its independence in 1932 but soon changed its mind and asserted its rights to parts of Kuwait. The claim reflected the nation’s concern with its limited access to the sea, by way of its 48-mile coastline on the Persian GulD^ After the 1958 coup, Iraqi leaders actively promoted political insta¬ bility in the oil-rich monarchies of the Arabian Peninsula. That policy had its roots in antimonarchical fervor and rivalry with Iran for influ¬ ence in the Gulf. In Kuwait the long-standing border dispute exacerbat¬ ed the conflict between the radical Iraqi regime and the traditional sheikhdom. Iraq based its maximum original claim to all of Kuwait on the sheikhdom’s Ottoman past. The more recent minimum version focused on the islands of Warbah and Bubiyan, which dominated the approach to the Iraqi port of Umm Qa§r. Iraq claimed those as former parts of the Ottoman province of Al Basrah. President Qasim revived the larger claim in 1961, asserting that all of Kuwait had once been part of Ba§rah Province. Kuwait, he declared, was an arbitrary creation of the British. Six days after Britain granted Kuwait independence on 19 June 1961, Iraq claimed the entire sheikhdom and prepared an invasion. The Arab League supported Kuwait, admitting the emirate to membership on 20 July, but Iraq backed off only after Britain responded to pleas from its former colony by sending troops. Forces from Arab League members also entered Kuwait in September, stayed into the following year, and departed only when the danger seemed to be past.^® The affair proved disastrous for Iraq. Qasim severed ties with the Arab League and broke relations with nations that recognized the former British protectorate, among them Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia, and the United States. The result completed his isolation from the international community and immensely increased the vulnerability of his regime.^’ The Ba’th Regime Qasim’s government lasted five years before an Arab nationalist coup organized by the Ba’th ended his rule in 1963. The new regime fell apart within a year, but the Ba’th regrouped to lead a coalition back into power on 17 July 1968. Under Ba’th leadership, Iraq moved toward a more narrow, regional orientation, away from the West and Egyptian-sponsored Pan-Arabism. The Hashemite connection to Jordan was broken permanently, as was any meaningful relationship between the Iraqi Ba’th and the Syrian branch of the party. The Ba’thists also increasingly came to identify the United States as the major supporter of the conservative monarchies in the Gulf and as an enemy of reform.^^ By the time of the July 1968 coup, a clique of leaders from the town of Tikrlt, among them Saddam Hussein, who was the assistant secretary gen- Background to War 11 Marr, Modem History of Iraq, pp. 207-08, 211, 214-15; Frederick W.

Although not alone in bringing about the coup, the Ba’th soon took full control and significantly changed the structure and orientation of the Iraqi government. A one-party state with an impressive institutional structure emerged, along with gradual consoli¬ dation of power in the hands of one man to a degree not seen since the last days of the monarchy Buttressed after 1972 by arms provided under a treaty with the Soviet Union, the Ba’th created a strong central authority Iraq revived the border dispute with Kuwait in 1973, hoping to gain sovereignty over Warbah and Bubiyan islands in an effort to protect its second largest port at Umm Qa§r. Fighting broke out in March, when Iraqi troops attacked a Kuwaiti border post overlooking the port and naval base of Umm Qa§r. Three soldiers, one Iraqi and two Kuwaitis, were killed. Iraq demanded a portion of the coast south of the port city and Warbah and Bubiyan, but retracted its demands under international pres¬ sure. The situation gradually improved as Iraq became preoccupied with its own development programs and made a general effort to improve rela¬ tions with its neighbors during the second half of the 1970s (see Map 2).^^ The episode revealed the fragility of Kuwait’s position in the face of determined Iraqi aggression and even raised the possibility of an Iraqi menace to Saudi Arabian oil fields. In recognition of the danger to their own interests, the Saudis supported the Kuwaiti government and even sent 15,000 troops to help defend their small neighbor. They also exerted diplomatic pressure through the Arab League. Although Iraq backed down, it did not give up its claims. Tensions remained high for several years, and occasional reports of Iraqi incursions reminded all concerned that the dispute remained unresolved. The United States and Middle Eastern Oil As Britain declined as a regional force in the Middle East, the United States became more influential. World War II had raised American aware¬ ness of the region’s strategic importance, while the growing involvement of American oil companies had made the region more important to American security and prosperity. Gradually the prewar uncommitted benevolence was replaced by more active and explicit involvement.^^ The initial association of the United States in Arab minds with the principles of self-determination and anticolonialism helped establish American credibility in the Middle East. That early goodwill faded, however, as American support of Israel became evident. Arab states lost confidence in the evenhandedness of the United States and came to view it as an enemy American economic interests in Middle Eastern oil remained largely in private hands. The need for direct government involvement did not become clear until profound changes took place in the oil industry, includ¬ ing the final wave of nationalizations that followed the dramatic 1973 price increases. The United States needed assurance of regular supplies and 12 The Dhahran civil air terminal Stookey, America & the Arab States, pp. 54-55, 263; Michael Sterner, “The Gulf Cooperation Council and Persian Gulf Security,” in Thomas Naff, ed., Gulf Secwity and the Iran- Iraq War (Washington, D.C.: National Defense University Press and Middle East Research Institute, 1985), pp. 5-6; Yergin, The Prize, p. 646.

Whirlwind War sought to channel the huge oil profits into areas that enhanced the American fiscal stability and prosperity. After Britain withdrew from the region, the United States adopted a “twin pillars” policy, encouraging the development of regional power centers in Saudi Arabia and Iran, which would be relied on to maintain stability and protect American interests.^^ The new American policy also served another purpose — to block Soviet influence in the region. The United States and Saudi Arabian Defense With the emergence of the United States as a bulwark against Soviet influence, the government of Saudi Arabia began to turn toward the United States. The success of a small American military training mis¬ sion late in World War II helped encourage what ultimately became a long-term connection between the armed forces of both nations. The training mission later expanded to several Saudi bases and remained an important part of postwar American assistance to Saudi Arabia. In 1950 President Harry S. Truman explicitly assured King Abdul Aziz of American support for the preservation of Saudi independence and ter¬ ritorial integrity. Closer ties benefited both countries. The United States gained access to and use of the Dhahran airfield. In exchange the United States provided arms and training for the small Saudi army and helped develop the naval and air services.^® The work of the United States Army Corps of Engineers was singular¬ ly important to the development of that military relationship.

Although mainly military, these efforts also included civil projects such as the facilities for the national television network and the Dhahran civil air terminal The terminal project in particular, a striking piece of work that won the American Institute of Architects’ first honors in 1963 for designer Minoru Yamasaki, established with the Saudi government the corps’ reputation for quality engineering and construction. The Engineer Assistance Agreement of 24 May 1965 cemented that relationship and provided the basis for subsequent Corps of Engineers work in the kingdom 3^ In the 1970s the relationship changed from that of client and patron to a complex interdependence. The Saudis needed American support for their security as well as help in development projects;, the United States needed Saudi cooperation regarding the supply and price of oil and the recycling of Saudi oil profits. Early in the decade the Saudis, with one eye on the power vacuum created by the British withdrawal from the Gulf, asked for a special American military mission to study projects related to national security and make recommendations for future assistance. In response, the United States conducted several studies of Saudi defense requirements and began the sale of modern fighters to the Saudi air force. Other large military sales programs followed, as did modernization and training programs, their costs surging along with Saudi oil profits. As part of the vastly expanded program of assistance, the United States endorsed a Saudi military strategy that envisioned permanent deployment of large portions of Saudi forces in elaborate military cities near threatened frontiers. They consisted of command and control sites, airfields, hangars, depots, maintenance and repair shops, and elaborate cantonments for soldiers, their families, and supporting civilians. The sites included Khamis Mushayt, close to Yemen; Tabuk in the north near Jordan and Israel; and IJafar al Batin, next to Kuwait and Iraq.^^ The last of those, initially called Al Batin Military City but later renamed for King Khalid, began in 1972. Originally intended for three brigades and a tactical airfield and with an estimated price tag of $9 bil¬ lion, it was the most costly construction project ever undertaken by the Corps of Engineers. In the 1980s declining oil profits forced reduction of the base to two-brigade size and postponed construction of the airfield. However, when the corps turned the city over to the Ministry of Defense and Aviation in 1986, the final cost was still $7 billion.^^ The relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia was based on mutual but not identical interests. Saudi survival depended in large measure on the kingdom’s ties to the United States, but the govern¬ ment’s specific concerns were complex. The Saudis wanted visible American help through the sale of sophisticated weapons and treatment that indicated that they were as important as America’s other major regional allies, Israel and Egypt. The major menace to Saudi Arabia came from the Gulf, where both Iraq and Iran were potentially formidable foes. 14 Whirlwind War VII Corps area, King Khalid Military City Quandt, Saudi Arabia in the 1980s, pp. 142, 156; Safran, Saudi Arabia, pp. 151, 214; Cordesman, The Gulf and the West, p. 240; Peterson, Defending Aj'abia, pp. 7, 118, 145.

Quote from Yergin, The Prize, p. 702; Johnson, The Military as an Instrument of U.S. Policy, p. 1. The Saudis counted on Iran to check Iraq and the United States to curb Iran. The Soviet Union represented a more remote danger. When it came to the security of Saudi oil the interests of both the United States and Saudi Arabia were nearly identical.^^ The Carter Doctrine A series of events at the end of the 1970s jolted the United States into a more active approach to the region. To the west of Arabia, across the Red Sea, Ethiopia emerged as a Marxist state and almost immediately went to war with neighboring Sudan. In Iran, Mohammed Riza Shah Pahlevis regime collapsed in early 1979 and a bloody revolution followed, bring¬ ing to power Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s intensely anti-American Islamic republic. In November a group of radical Muslims in Saudi Arabia attacked the great mosque in Mecca, calling into question the sta¬ bility of the Saudi regime, and before the year ended, Soviet tanks rolled into Afghanistan. The entire region seemed to be in turmoil, and American policy demanded reconsideration.^^ On 23 January 1980, President Jimmy Carter announced what became known as the Carter Doctrine. In the traditional State of the Union speech before Congress, Carter declared that “an attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including mili¬ tary force. Although such a position had long been implied by American support of Saudi Arabia, the speech marked a turning point. Background to War IS President Carter acted quickly to secure bases that would enable the United States to move forces into the region. The United States gained access in 1980 to the island of Masira from the government of Oman, the only Gulf country to allow American forces on its territory in peacetime, and wartime use of supporting bases in Somalia (Berbera), Kenya (Mombasa), and Egypt (Ras Banas). A rapid deployment force, established in October 1979, was renamed the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force in March 1980. Although initially without any assigned troop units, the new organization provided the planning staff necessary for more ambitious contingency operations in the Persian Gulf.^^ Exercise Bright Star 81 in November 1980 was a more concrete ges¬ ture. The United States sent a battalion of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) for two weeks of training with Egyptian forces in the desert west of Cairo. A squadron of eight A-7 aircraft and the rapid deployment force headquarters accompanied the battalion. The exer¬ cise symbolized the Carter administration’s commitment to protect vital American interests in Southwest Asia.^^ Yergin, The Prize, p. 702; Johnson, The Military as an Instrument of U.S. Policy, pp. 1, 8, 34; Peterson, Defending Arabia, p. 6; Majid Khadduri, The Gulf War: The Origins & Implications of the Iran-Iraq Conflict (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988), pp. 143-44.

The Onset of the Iran-Iraq War The tension between Iran and Iraq had deep roots. Long-standing major problems included rivalries between the minority Sunni Muslims who dominated Iraq and the majority Shiites, Kurdish aspirations to nation¬ hood that challenged both countries as well as Turkey and Syria, and dis¬ putes over borders that confined Iraq to its narrow and tenuous access to the Persian Gulf by way of the Shatt al Arab waterway. In 1969, when Britain announced its intent to withdraw from the Gulf, Iran and Iraq already seemed poised for war. Iran was concerned over its neighbor’s Pan-Arab Ba’th ideology, zeal for revolutionary socialism, and anti- Western orientation. Iraq feared the Shah’s aggressive stance, buttressed as it was by a large armament program and support from the United States. That year did see a small confrontation over the boundary along the Gulf, and disputes flared in the 1970s as well, once when Iran occu¬ pied three Gulf islands in 1971 and several times later over the border.^® Most of those differences appeared to have been put to rest by the Algiers Treaty in 1975. This agreement settled the border dispute over the Shatt al Arab waterway in Iran’s favor and ended the Shah’s support of Kurdish insurgents in Iraq. At the same time, Iraq renounced a long¬ standing claim to the southwestern portion of Iran, an area called Arabistan by Iraq and Khuzestan by Iran, and recognized Iranian control of the disputed Gulf islands. Saddam Hussein, already a dominant force in the Ba’th party, took over the presidency in 1979, the same year that the fundamentalist Shiite regime came to power in Iran. The Iranian revolutionaries revived past disputes and added a new one, Iranian incitement of Shiite discontent in Iraq. When the Iranian monarchy was overthrown, Iraq IB Marr, Modern Histoiy of Iraq, pp. 234, 245; Khadduri, The Gulf War, pp. 83-85.

Wmiblwinb Wah denounced the Algiers Treaty and demanded restoration of the eastern bank of the Shatt al Arab as the border. After a period of mutual spo¬ radic border violations and skirmishes, Iraq attacked its neighbor in earnest in the summer of 1980.^® The war, extremely ill conceived, resulted directly from President Saddam Hussein’s poor political judgment. The situation could have been contained, as it had been in the past, and Iraqi interests could have been promoted short of war. But Iran appeared weak and disorga¬ nized, and the Iraqi president thought he could easily win. His miscal¬ culation 'of his opponent and corresponding overestimate of his own ability to impose a solution proved disastrous. It was exactly the kind of error that a highly personalized leadership lacking institutional checks and balances was inclined to make.\"^^ The Reagan Approach The Ronald W Reagan administration, which took office in 1981 when the war between Iran and Iraq was only a few months old, built on the Carter Doctrine. Reagan gave permanence and substance to the new approach and expanded the doctrine beyond the original commitment to deal with threats from outside the Gulf to cover any threat to Saudi Arabia. The United States would not, he avowed at a news conference on 1 October 1981, “stand by and see that taken by anyone that would shut off that oil.” Moreover, he indicated readiness to keep open the Strait of Hormuz in the event that Iran tried to close the Persian Gulf to shipping.^^ Reagan’s military plans for Gulf security were more ambitious than those of his predecessor. The Reagan administration regarded the lack of an actual American military presence as a tacit invitation to Soviet inter¬ vention. The refusal of the Persian Gulf States to accept American mili¬ tary forces frustrated the Reagan government, so the new administration strengthened the rapid deployment concept with significant expenditures for military construction in the Middle East and nearby areas. In the first Reagan administration, the United States spent nearly $1 billion on con¬ struction and support facilities, in Morocco, at Lajes Field in the Azores, and on the Indian Ocean island base of Diego Garcia. Reagan also made the first official assignment of forces to the rapid deployment force on 24 April 1981 and gave it a prominent place in the defense establishment.\"^^ While the Carter administration had buried the rapid deployment force within the U.S. Army Readiness Command, Reagan gave it visibility and prominence. In October 1981 the connection to the Readiness Command ended, and the task force became a separate command report¬ ing directly to the secretary of defense through the Joint Chiefs of Staff. One month later, Exercise Bright Star 82 showed the growth of plans and forces, testing a broad range of tactical and logistical capabilities. On 1 January 1983, the force became one of six U.S. multiservice com¬ mands.

Its commander was given charge of nearly all American military activity in that part of the world, including planning for contingencies, coordinating joint exer¬ cises involving American and other forces, and administering security assistance. The command oversaw the airborne warning and control sys¬ tem (AWACS), the tanker aircraft at Riyadh, and the Navy’s five-ship Middle East Force. Its total deployment potential stood at 300,000.“^^ Despite the increase in the size and capability of the deployable force, there were limits to the American ability to move its forces overseas. The United States still needed bases and facilities in the Persian Gulf, and, although it alone in the West could contribute significantly to the defense of the Gulf, it could not transfer a large combat force on short notice. Throughout the 1980s, Central Command planners emphasized helping friendly nations in the Middle East defend themselves through training, arms sales, and military liaison as well as joint maneuvers. The force reas¬ sured countries like Saudi Arabia, which rejected an overt American pres¬ ence but needed to know that support was available in an emergency The success of a rapid transfer of U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf depended on Saudi acceptance and support. Whether the threat came from the Soviet Union or an aggressive neighbor such as Iran or Iraq, access to Dhahran and King Khalid Military City were necessary for any major deployment. Bases at Diego Garcia and elsewhere provided periph¬ eral facilities but were too remote to use as operational centers for the defense of the oil facilities of the upper and central Persian Gulf.^^ The Gulf Cooperation Council While the rapid deployment force was an ingredient in the American recipe for regional stability, the United States also wanted to foster the establishment of a viable partnership among the Persian Gulf States. When war started between Iran and Iraq in 1980, Saudi Arabia and the states along the southern shore of the Gulf watched warily. Some, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Bahrain among them, had experienced Iranian threats even before the war started. The Arab states around the Gulf generally backed Iraq. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were particularly outspoken in their support. Both con¬ tributed substantially to the $40 to $50 billion that all the Gulf States provided Iraq. In addition, both allowed Iraq to use their ports for arms shipments and sold oil on behalf of Iraq. Saudi Arabia also allowed Iraq to build and use a pipeline through its territory.^® Although Kuwait was among the most generous contributors to the Iraqi cause, there were some things it would not do. Early in the war, Iraq renewed a proposal it had made in 1975 for 99-year leases on the islands of Bubiyan and Warbah. Kuwait refused. In 1984 Saddam Hussein scaled down his request to a 20-year lease in exchange for an agreement to a definitive border. Once more Kuwait declined. 18 Whirlwind War Ibid., p. 73; Khadduri, The Gulf War, p. 151; Quote from Ba’th Party, The 1968 Revolution in Iraq, Experience and Prospects, the Political Report of the Arab Ba’th Socialist Party in Iraq, January 1974, as cited in Efraim Karsh and Inari Rautsi, Saddam Hussein, A Political Biography (New York: Free Press, 1991), p. 63.

Despite their open support of Iraq during the early stages of the war, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia understood that in the long run Iraq threatened their security. With this threat in mind, they led the effort to create the Gulf Cooperation Council, a regional defense alliance that was estab¬ lished in May 1981. In addition to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, members included Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, a confed¬ eration made up of the sheikhdoms of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujiera, Ra’s al Khaymah, Sharjah, and Umm al Qaywayn. Iraq, which in 1974 had proclaimed itself “the most important and advanced Arab country in the area” and consequently protector of the Gulf “against dan¬ gers and encroachments,” sought, but was denied, membership. The council tried to contain the war between its powerful neighbors and ulti¬ mately bring both sides to the bargaining table.\"*® Militarily the Saudi armed forces formed the key to the council’s limit¬ ed defensive capabilities. The kingdom was by far the largest and most powerful of the six members. With oil reserves and revenues that dwarfed those of the others, it had the largest armed forces and good lines of com¬ munications. However, its military prowess was only imposing in contrast to that of the other members. A lack of manpower severely limited the capabilities of the Saudis, although the military infrastmcture built under Corps of Engineers contracts compensated somewhat by enabling the Saudis to take advantage of the most technically advanced weapons.*'\" While Iran and Iraq slugged it out, the Gulf Cooperation Council progressed toward its goal of creating an effective regional security structure. Despite the pointed rejection of the Iraqi application, the members continued to view fundamentalist Iran as the more immediate threat, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait continued in the forefront as providers of material aid to Iraq.® The council expressed interest in cooperation with the United States but still wanted to keep actual forces at arm’s length. Member states did not agree with the United States regarding the nature of the threat to regional stability. The United States emphasized the Soviet peril, at least until the middle of the decade, when American policy makers began to put more stress on strengthening the Arab side of the Gulf against a potential Iranian threat to the flow of oil. The council always worried more about its power¬ ful and quarrelsome neighbors and Israel than about the Soviet Union.®’ The United States and the Iran-Iraq War During the 1980s confusion in American policy caused a crisis in rela¬ tions with the Gulf States. In 1984 the United States, concerned that Iran might win the war and become a long-range menace to the supply of oil, reestablished diplomatic relations with Iraq, after a seventeen-year break. At the same time, some American officials embarked on the clandestine sale of arms to Iran, in direct contradiction to the official effort to with¬ hold them from Tehran. They channeled the money from that venture to F-1 6 fighters at a Saudi air base during Desert Shield Axelgard, A New haq?, pp. 14-16; Cordesman, The Gulf and the West, p. 313.

To restore its position in the Gulf, the United States agreed to reflag and convoy Kuwaiti ships. Protection of the flow of oil was in any case still a paramount American interest, and President Reagan affirmed his com¬ mitment to safeguard Gulf exports. Along with the reflagging went a major American naval deployment to protect the tankers.” The United States and Saudi Arabia maintained their close military relationship throughout the Iran-Iraq war. American diplomats contin¬ ued to enjoy easy access to the ruling family, although they never con¬ vinced the Saudis to agree formally to American access to their bases or abandon their opposition to the stationing of American soldiers in the kingdom. The official Saudi position was that both superpowers should keep their forces out of the Persian Gulf. The Saudis, however, never objected to the American naval contingent in Bahrain and other period- 20 Whirlwind War Cordesman, The Gulf and the West, pp. 141-42; Quandt, Saudi Arabia in the 1980s, pp. 2, 55.

Limited American deployments, among them minesweepers, operational air¬ craft, and the AWACS, were acceptable.” Reinforcement by U.S. forces in an emergency was always a basic component of Saudi defense planning, albeit only in event of a clear and immediate threat. In fact, to many observers, Saudi installations appeared plainly overbuilt, as if actually intended only for other forces. Saudi bases, with their modern infrastructure and service facilities, could accept an American deployment on very short notice. Those bases, com¬ bined with the large quantities of American supplies and equipment pur¬ chased ostensibly for Saudi use, ultimately constituted the virtual equiva¬ lent of American bases in Saudi Arabia, albeit without the American per¬ sonnel needed to translate their potential into actual combat power. The Saudi military buildup was principally oriented on aviation facili¬ ties. The Saudis had the largest and some of the most modem air bases in the region, with American contractor employees servicing their equipment and American-trained technicians among their own ground crews. Although rejecting any combined maneuvers, they recognized the need for cooperation with a Central Command deployment when necessary. Short of that necessity, however, they insisted that cooperation remain based on Saudi military buildups with American arms and technical assistance.^^ Saudi purchases from the United States did facilitate a possible deployment of Central Command forces to Southwest Asia. Any expedi¬ tionary force would gain an advantage if its weapons, ammunition, and parts were compatible to the equipment used by a potential host nation. The United States achieved a large measure of interchangeability through military assistance to the Gulf States, despite occasional frustration at the hands of American supporters of Israel, who saw the provision of any arms and equipment to an Arab nation in a different light. From the Iran-Iraq War to the Invasion of Kuwait The Iran-Iraq war ended in August 1988 with both sides exhausted and Iraq claiming victory but without Iraqi success in achieving control of the Shatt al Arab. Thereafter, the United States and the Gulf States continued to support Iraq, with American policy in the Persian Gulf trying to moderate Iraqi behavior through closer economic ties. Despite human rights abuses and the continuing development of chemical and nuclear weapons, Iraq’s secular leadership seemed less threatening than Iran’s religious zealots. Meanwhile, the continued financial contributions of Saudi Arabia and the sheikhdoms of the Gulf Cooperation Council enabled Iraq to rebuild its armed forces, which had been mauled by eight years of war.^® In spite of the continued support of Iraq, there was a growing per¬ ception in the United States that the major near-term threats to the states of the southern Persian Gulf and to Western oil supplies came not from the Soviet Union but from the Gulf region itself.

Both now had the experience of a decade of war to go with traditions of political instability. Meanwhile, the Iranian revolution represented a constant danger not only to Iraq, but the southern Gulf States and the industrial West as well.^^ The end of the war left Iraq both remarkably strong and desperate¬ ly weak. By regional standards, the Iraqi armed forces appeared formi¬ dable, and the war seemed to have forged a strong feeling of national cohesion. Iraq believed that it had won the war and defended Arab interests against the traditional Persian threat. Iraq also saw itself as a major oil power with a dominant role in the region. At the same time, it had piled up a debt estimated as high as $70 billion. The $5 to $6 billion in interest that the government paid annually consumed nearly one-third of its oil revenues. The war crippled Iraq’s economic development program and stifled the social mobility that had attended it. The years of fighting left much of the nation’s industrial capacity weakened and its ability to export oil severely impaired. Economically, the war also diminished Iraq’s interna¬ tional position and forced the regime into a position of dependence on its wealthy neighbors. That reliance actually represented a continuation of the relationship that had sustained Iraq through the war, although Iraq was convinced that it had not received adequate support. Iraqi resent¬ ment focused largely on wealthy Kuwait, which held territory that Iraq coveted and considered its own.^^ Although the states of the southern Gulf did not appreciate the depth of Iraqi bitterness at their supposedly inadequate support, they were not blind to the threat implicit in Iraq’s postwar military strength and confi¬ dence. The Saudis knew that the border with Iraq was ideal for armor operations and that the entire Arabian Peninsula was vulnerable to attack from the northeast. Major Saudi oil facilities were only 200 miles away. King Khalid Military Gity with its two armored brigades, provided only limited security, and other Gulf Gooperation Gouncil members had no mil¬ itary forces of consequence. Any assault on Kuwait might easily become the first stage of a two-phase attack on the rest of the peninsula. The United States shared Saudi Arabia’s concerns. Kuwait, the door to the entire oil-producing region, was very vulnerable. Threats to its sta¬ bility, either from external or internal pressures, would have wide ramifi¬ cations, endangering the flow of oil and the economic health of the industrial West (Map 3).^^ In the two years after the fighting between Iran and Iraq ended, Iraq increased its pressure on Kuwait. The war had left the Shatt al Arab approach to Al Ba§rah and the city itself a shambles. The opening of the waterway to shipping remained in the distant future. Iraq again turned its attention to the border that it shared with Kuwait.

He cleared the way for action by beginning negotiations for a final settlement with Iran, massing troops on the Kuwaiti border, and sounding out the American reaction to a possible military move into Kuwait. Saddam appeared to ignore the restatement of the Carter Doctrine by the administration of President George H. Bush in National Security Directive 26 of October 1989, warning that the United States would defend its vital interests by force if necessary Meanwhile, Kuwait struggled to find a counterbalance to the increasing Iraqi threat. It had a military agreement with Egypt that dated from the last phase of the Iran-Iraq war and even made an overture toward Iran, which might again serve as a potential counter to Iraq. But neither those connections nor the Gulf Cooperation Council had the potential strength to ward off a determined Iraqi attack. Kuwait needed protection, like that provided by Great Britain at the turn of the century and by the United States in 1987. Yet, like Saudi Arabia and other Arab states, Kuwait accepted American construction support and air defense missiles but stopped short of inviting an American presence in support of its own defense. That refusal, grounded in strong feelings of national pride, race, and religion, reflected an unrealistic assessment of its situa¬ tion. As historian Theodore Draper wrote during the year of the tanker war, in which Kuwaiti oil tankers began to fly American flags, “Kuwait was too rich to be left alone and too weak to defend itself.”®^ During the first seven months of 1990, Iraqi troop movements and presidential bombast foreshadowed the impending crisis. But, like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the United States did not recognize the imminence of the Iraqi threat until it was too late.^^ On 2 August 1990, when Iraqi tanks rolled through Kuwait to the Saudi border and Saddam Hussein’s government declared that Kuwait no longer existed as an independent country, perceptions quickly changed. President Bush quickly decided to uphold the Carter Doctrine and commit the United States to direct military action. With a large majority of the nations of the world opposed to the invasion of Kuwait, President Bush built a broad-based coalition in support of intervention. The United States, which took the lead in developing and coordinating opposition to Iraq, achieved a diplomatic triumph of great magnitude and far-reaching consequence. Urged for¬ ward by the United States, the United Nations General Assembly imposed an embargo on Iraq, and the Security Council voted to con¬ demn the invasion. Almost immediately coalition forces moved toward Southwest Asia. By far the largest contributor to the force, the United States honored commitments to Saudi Arabia first made by President Truman.®^ The result was Operation Desert Shield, which before it was over became the Desert Storm. Chapter 2 The Army of Desert Storm ^ On problems within the military at the end of the Vietnam War, see William L. Hauser, America's Army in Crisis (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1973); Paul L. Savage and Richard A. Gabriel, Crisis in Command: Mismanagement in the Army (New York: Hill and Wang, 1978); Charles C. Moskos, Jr., “The American Combat Soldier in Vietnam,” Journal of Social Issues 31 (1975); Data on Vietnam Era Veterans (Washington, D.C.: Reports and Statistics Service, Office of the Controller, Veterans Administration, June 1971); Lee N. Robbins, The Vietnam Drug User Returns (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1974); Edward L. King, The Death of the Army (New York: Saturday Review Press, 1972); and Comprehensive Report: Leadership for the 1970s, USAWC Study of Leadership for the Professional Soldier (Carlisle Barracks, Pa.: Army War College [AWC], 1971). The Army that deployed in 1990 to Saudi Arabia, the product of almost twenty years of reform and experimentation, bore little resemblance to the Army that left the Republic of Vietnam in 1972. At the end of the Vietnam War some weapon systems were obsolete while others were obsolescent, and conventional mobile warfare had to compete with counterinsurgency operations for military doctrinal, organizational, and training attention. At the same time, indiscipline, drug abuse, racism, and poor training were epidemic within the ranks. ^ By 1990 those problems were either well in the past or on their way to resolution. Not only were new weapons in place, but military theo¬ rists and planners had also broadened the range of possible conflicts to include from small tactical deployments of short duration to a major war over a broad front. Meanwhile, the Army had addressed its internal problems. High standards of recruitment, training, and discipline were in place. In the intervening two decades, the service rebuilt itself around the concept of an all-volunteer force designed to integrate the Army Reserve and Army National Guard into its wartime organization. Army leaders evolved new doctrine for ready forces, focused on the acquisi¬ tion of new equipment to support that doctrine, tied both together with rigorous training programs, and concentrated on leader development initiatives that increased officer and noncommissioned officer profes¬ sionalism. By the summer of 1990 the U.S. Army was a technologically sophisticated, highly trained, well-led, and confident force. New Doctrine A reassessment of how the Army fought began with President Richard M. Nixon’s “Guam Doctrine” of 1969, in which he stated that the United States would maintain a smaller defense establishment able to fight a “1- 72 war” contingency. This was generally interpreted to mean that the Army would prepare to engage in a general war, probably in the European theater, and in a minor conflict, presumably a Third World counterinsurgency. The smaller Army envisioned by Nixon faced growing challenges, however. American intelligence agencies in the early 1970s 2B Whirlwinu War ^ For summaries of the military bal¬ ance, see Amos A.

The Arab-Israeli War that began on 6 October 1973 intensified concerns about the deadliness of modern weapons as well as the Army’s Vietnam-era concentration on infantry-airmobile warfare at the expense of other forces.^ American observers who toured those battlefields began to create a new tactical vocabulary when they reported on the “new lethality” of a Middle Eastern battlefield where, in one month of fighting, the Israeli, Syrian, and Egyptian armies lost more tanks and artillery than existed in the entire United States Army, Europe. Improved technology in the form of antitank guided missiles, much more sophisticated and accurate fire-control systems, and vastly improved tank cannons heralded a far more costly and deadly future for conventional war. Technology likewise brought changes to battle¬ field tactics. Egyptian infantry armed with missiles enjoyed significant successes against Israeli tank units, bolstering the importance of care¬ fully coordinated combined arms units. ^ It seemed clear that in future wars American forces would fight powerful and well-equipped armies whose soldiers would be proficient in the use of extremely deadly weapons. Such fighting would consume large numbers of men and quantities of materiel. It became imperative for the Army to devise a way to win any future war quickly. ^ A new operations field manual, the Army’s specific response to new conditions that required new doctrine, was preeminently the work of General William E. DePuy, commander of the new U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). Surveying conditions of modern warfare that appeared to reconfirm the lessons of World War II, DePuy wrote in 1976 much of a new edition of Field Manual 100-5 and enlisted the help of the combat arms schools’ commandants to revise and improve his ideas. Depuy’s Field Manual 100-5 initially touted a concept known as the Active Defense, which once more focused on “the primacy of the defense.” The handbook evolved from its first publication to become the keystone of a family of Army manuals that completely replaced the doctrine being practiced at the end of the Vietnam War.^ From these modest beginnings the Army’s new doctrine, AirLand Battle, slowly emerged. In its final form AirLand doctrine was actually a clear articulation of fundamentals that American generals had under¬ stood and practiced as early as World War II, with an appropriate and explicit recognition of the role air power played in making decisive ground maneuver possible.^ The U.S. Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, acknowledged AirLand The Army of Desert Storm 27 Battle’s basis in traditional concepts of maneuver warfare by teaching it and making frequent use of historical examples.^ In practical terms, the doctrine required commanders to supervise three types of operations simultaneously In close operations, large tac¬ tical formations such as corps and divisions fought battles through maneuver, close combat, and indirect fire support. Deep operations helped to win the close battle by engaging enemy formations not in contact, chiefly through deception, deep surveillance, and ground and air interdiction of enemy reserves. Objectives of deep operations were to isolate the battlefield and influence when, where, and against whom later battles would be fought. Rear operations proceeded simultaneous¬ ly with the other two and focused on assembling and moving reserves, redeploying fire support, continuing logistical efforts to sustain the bat¬ tle, and providing continuity of command and control. Security opera¬ tions, traffic control, and maintenance of lines of communications were critical to rear operations (Chart 1). AirLand Battle generated an extended doctrinal and tactical discus¬ sion in the service journals after 1976 that helped to clarify and, occa- ® Field Manual 100-5 uses historical examples to illuminate the discus¬ sion of doctrine.

Starry who succeed¬ ed DePuy in 1977 at the Training and Doctrine Command, directed a substantial revision that concentrated on the offensive and added weight to the importance of deep operations by stressing the role of deep ground attack in disrupting the enemy’s follow-on echelons of forces. Changes mainly dealt with ways to exploit what B. H. Liddell Hart described as the indirect approach in warfare by fighting the enemy along his line of least expectation in place or time. The 1982 edition of Field Manual 100-5 stressed that the Army had to “fight outnumbered and win” the first battle of the next war, a concept that required a trained and ready peacetime force. The manual acknowl¬ edged the armored battle as the heart of warfare, with the tank as the sin¬ gle most important weapon in the Army’s arsenal. Success, however, hinged on a deft manipulation of all of the arms, but especially infantry engineers, artillery and air power, to give free rein to the maneuver forces. Using that mechanized force, the doctrine required commanders to seize the initiative from the enemy; act faster than the enemy could react; exploit depth through operations extending in space, time, and resources to keep the enemy off balance; and synchronize the combat power of ground and air forces at the decisive point of battle. AirLand Battle doctrine had additional utility because it helped to define both the proper equipment for its execution and the appropriate organization of military units for battle. Indeed, the doctrine explicitly acknowledged the growth of technology both as a threat and as a require¬ ment. The U.S. Army and its NATO allies could not match large Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces either in masses of manpower or in masses of materiel. To that extent, AirLand Battle was both an organizational strate¬ gy and a procurement strategy To fight outnumbered and survive, the Army needed to better employ the nation’s qualitative edge in technology. New Equipment Military theorists generally agreed that a defending army could hope for success if the attacking enemy had no greater than a 3:1 advantage in combat power. The best intelligence estimates in the 1970s, however, concluded that the Warsaw Pact armies enjoyed a much larger advantage. Continuing budget constrictions made unlikely the possibility of increas¬ ing the size of the American military to match Soviet growth. To solve the problem of how to fight an enemy that would almost certainly be larger, the United States relied, in part, on technologically superior hardware that could defeat an enemy at ratios higher than 1:3. To achieve that end, the Army in the early 1970s began work on the “big five” equipment sys¬ tems: a new tank, a new infantry combat vehicle, a new attack helicopter, a new transport helicopter, and a new antiaircraft missile. Several factors affected new equipment design. Among the most important was the flourishing technology encouraged by the pure and The Army of Desert Storm 29 These themes were treated most thoroughly in the years after 1980 by the Military Reform Caucus, an informal group of members of Congress, military analysts, and journalists. On the caucus and its criticisms, see MS, Theresa Kraus, The Military Reform Caucus [Center of Military History (CMH), 1987], Reformers focused on concrete issues of how to train, equip, and organize military forces, rather than on questions of strategy, and often used Dana Rasor’s Project on Military^ Procurement to communi¬ cate with the press. Members held diverse views, but among those criti¬ cizing the complexity and costs of weapons were Walter Kross, Military Reform: The High-Tech Debate in Tactical Air Forces (Washington, D.C.: National Defense University [NDU] Press, 1985); and James Fallows, National Defense (New York: Random House, 1981). For a general survey, see Asa A. Clark et al.. The Defense Reform Debate: Issues and Analysis (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1984). MS, Bruce R. Pirnie, Duster to DIVAD: The Army’s Search for a Radar-Directed Gun [CMH, 1987]. applied research associated with space programs. Although the big five equipment originated in the years before AirLand Battle doctrine was first enunciated, that doctrine quickly had its effect on design criteria. Other factors were speed, survivability, and good communications, which were essential to economize on small forces and give them the advantages they required to defeat larger, but presumably more ponderous, enemies. Target acquisition and fire control were equally important, since the suc¬ cess of a numerically inferior force really depended on the ability to score first-round hits. Such simply stated criteria were not easy to achieve, and all of the weapon programs suffered through years of mounting costs and produc¬ tion delays. A debate that was at once philosophical and fiscal raged around the new equipment, with some critics preferring simpler and cheaper machines, fielded in greater quantities. The Department of Defense persevered, however, in its preference for technologically superi¬ or systems and managed to retain funding for most of the proposed new weapons. Weapon systems were expensive, but defense analysts recog¬ nized that personnel costs were even higher and pointed out that the ser¬ vices could not afford the manpower to operate increased numbers of simpler weapons. Nevertheless, spectacular procurement failures, such as the Sergeant York division air defense gun, kept the issue before the pub¬ lic, and such cases kept program funding for other equally complex weapons on the agenda for debate. The first of the big five systems, the Ml Abrams tank, weathered considerable criticism and, in fact, began from the failure of a preceding tank program. The standard tanks in the Army inventory had been vari¬ ous models of the M48 and M60, both surpassed in some respects by new Soviet equipment. The XM803 was the successor to an abortive joint American-German Main Battle Tank~70 project and was intended to modernize the armored force. Concerned about expense. Congress with¬ drew funding for the XM803 in December 1971, thereby canceling the program, but agreed to leave the remaining surplus of $20 million in Army hands to continue conceptual studies. For a time, designers considered arming tanks with missiles for long- range engagements. This innovation worked only moderately well in the M60A2 main battle tank and the M551 Sheridan armored reconnaissance vehicle, both of which were armed with the MGM51 Shillelagh gun launcher system. In the late 1960s, however, tank guns were rejuvenated by new technical developments that included a fin-stabilized, very high velocity projectile that used long-rod kinetic energy penetrators. Attention centered on 105-mm. and 120-mm. guns as the main arma¬ ment of any new tank. Armored protection was also an issue of tank modernization. The proliferation of antitank missiles that could be launched by dismounted infantry and mounted on helicopters and on all classes of vehicles demonstrated the need for considerable improvement.

The Army made the decision for a new tank series in 1972 and awarded developmental contracts in 1973. The first prototypes of the Ml, known as the XMl, reached the testing stage in 1976, and the tank began to arrive in battalions in February 1980. The Ml enjoyed a low sil¬ houette and a very high speed, thanks to an unfortunately voracious gas turbine engine. Chobham spaced armor (ceramic blocks set in resin between layers of conventional armor) resolved the problem of protec¬ tion versus mobility A sophisticated fire control system provided main gun stabilization for shooting on the move and a precise laser range find¬ er, thermal-imaging night sights, and a digital ballistic computer solved the gunnery problem, thus maximizing the utility of the 105-mm. main gun. Assembly plants had manufactured more than 2,300 of the 62-ton Ml tank by January 1985, when the new version, the MlAl, was approved for full production. The MlAl had improved armor and a 120- mm. main gun that had increased range and kill probability. By the sum¬ mer of 1990 several variations of the Ml had replaced the M60 in the active force and in a number of Army Reserve and National Guard battal¬ ions. Tankers had trained with the Abrams long enough to have confi¬ dence in it. In fact, many believed it was the first American tank since World War II that was qualitatively superior to Soviet models. The second of the big five systems was the companion vehicle to the Abrams tank: the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, also produced in a cavalry fighting version as the M3. Its predecessor, the Ml 13 armored personnel carrier, dated back to the early 1960s and was really little more than a battle taxi. The 1973 Arab-Israeli War demonstrated that infantry should accompany tanks, but it was increasingly clear that the Ml 13 could not perform that function because it was far slower than the Ml, its obsolescence aside. European practice also influenced American plans for a new vehicle. German infantry used the well-armored Marder, a vehicle that carried seven infantrymen in addition to its crew of three, was armed with a 20-mm. gun and coaxial 7.62-mm. machine gun in a turret, and allowed the infantrymen to fight from within the vehicle. The French Army fielded a similar infantry vehicle in the AMX-lOP in 1973. The Soviets had their BMP-ls, which had a 73-mm. smoothbore cannon and an antitank guided missile, as early as the late 1960s. Variations of the BMP were generally considered the best infantry fighting vehicles in the world during the 1980s. The United States had fallen at least a decade behind in the development of infantry vehicles. General DePuy and General Starry, who at that time commanded the U.S. Army Armor Genter and School at Fort Knox, Kentucky, agreed the Army needed a new infantry vehicle and began studies in that direction.
