Founded in 1921, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy. CFR carries out its mission by – maintaining a diverse membership, with special programs to promote interest and develop expertise in the next generation of foreign policy leaders; – convening meetings at its headquarters in New York and in Washington, DC, and other cities where senior government officials, members of Congress, global leaders, and prominent thinkers come together with CFR members to discuss and debate major international issues; – supporting a Studies Program that fosters independent research, enabling CFR scholars to produce articles, reports, and books and hold roundtables that analyze foreign policy issues and make concrete policy recommendations; – publishing Foreign Affairs, the preeminent journal on international affairs and U.S. foreign policy; – sponsoring Independent Task Forces that produce reports with both findings and policy prescriptions on the most important foreign policy topics; and – providing up-to-date information and analysis about world events and American foreign policy on its website, CFR.org.\n\nMission Statement\n\n4\n\nLetter from the Co-Chairs\n\nIt is our third year as co-chairs of the Council on Foreign Relations and the list of issues for the institution to address continues to evolve and grow. This year has been marked by persistent financial uncertainty and sovereign debt concerns, as well as by political tensions in various parts of the world, from the Korean peninsula to Afghanistan and Pakistan to the Middle East. Adding to all this, politics in Washington are more polarized than ever. Access to nonpartisan and unbiased analysis is limited yet critical to keeping Americans informed and helping the United States meet its many challenges. The Council has done tremendous work in New York, Washington, and beyond to address the growing list of foreign policy challenges. There are great strengths to being a New York–based organization. New York is the financial and media capital of the world, and home to the UN headquarters. The convening power of CFR in New York is unparalleled, attracting the most prominent world leaders in government and business. In Washington, the past year represented the organization’s first full year in its new building. Given the discordant tone of U.S. politics, the time could not be more appropriate for CFR to build its presence in the nation’s capital. The Council’s work grows stronger each year as the institution expands programming and other initiatives in both cities, as well as nationally. We would like to highlight some of the work CFR is doing from its impressive new space in Washington. The Washington building was an essential step in helping the Council expand both programming for individual and corporate members and outreach to targeted constituencies— congressional, executive, diplomatic, and media. An enhanced presence in Washington is a necessary platform for much of what CFR does. Since January 2009, the Washington office has welcomed five world leaders—from Canada, India, Liberia, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe—as well as numerous other foreign and U.S. government officials. The Washington office continues to convene senior U.S. government officials and business leaders on an array of issues. It hosted Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke at the height of the financial crisis and also examined economic issues with industry leaders like James W. Owens, chairman and chief executive officer of Caterpillar. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton gave her first major foreign policy speech at the Council in Washington, and CFR recently hosted General David H. Petraeus for a discussion of national security issues. The Council has also welcomed several other officials from the Obama administration to speak on regions ranging from South Asia to Europe and on issues from cybersecurity to education policy and American competitiveness. The Washington building, with its fifty-nine-thousand square feet and eight stories, far exceeds the Council’s old space, not only in size, but also in technological capacity, which allows CFR more flexibility in programming and other initiatives. This past year during the opening of the UN General Assembly, the Council was able to conduct high-resolution\n\nLetter from the Co-Chairs\n\nCo-Chairman Carla A. Hills\n\nCo-Chairman Robert E. Rubin\n\n5\n\ninteractive videoconferences of New York meetings with foreign leaders for its members in Washington. The larger space has also enabled Council fellows to do more in the way of roundtables and study groups, which have increased by 15 percent from fiscal year 2008. In addition, the building was recently awarded a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold-level certification, making it one of the most energy efficient and environmentally conscious buildings in the nation’s capital. Given the nonpartisan quality of CFR’s work and this country’s ongoing political dissonance, a presence in Washington is not only important to the one-third of its membership based there, but is also vital to the organization as a whole. The Council is well positioned to contribute informed voices to serious policy debates. This is a critical component of the Council’s mission, and as such CFR has expanded its outreach efforts in Washington. The building—which is steps away from the White House, World Bank, and State Department—places CFR in a prominent and easily accessible neighborhood among the most influential persons involved in foreign policy. CFR is also doing more with government officials and policymakers on Capitol Hill and in the executive branch to provide analysis and serve as a resource. The Congress and U.S. Foreign Policy program has grown significantly over the past decade, elevating the Council’s profile on Capitol Hill. The program puts on meeting series for members of Congress, chiefs of staff, and other senior aides in both the House and the Senate on topics ranging from global health to international finance to nonproliferation. Such series include individual breakfast briefings, in which a new member of Congress chooses a topic and the Council sets up a session with roughly a dozen CFR members with expertise in the area—in fiscal year 2010 the Council hosted fifteen such briefings. Recently, CFR has also hosted meetings that draw on its Contingency Planning Memoranda, which examine the implications of possible scenarios (such as an escalation of Indo-Pakistani tensions) and what can be done about them, and others that focus on more immediate topics like U.S. terrorism trials and the Iraqi elections. The program also now holds a conference at the start of each new Congress to educate incoming senior congressional staff about a wide range of foreign policy issues. The Council’s executive branch outreach team was formed more than two years ago, before the move to the new building. Thanks to the team’s efforts, the Council in Washington is increasingly viewed as the go-to convening body where senior administration officials and Washington’s intellectual leaders meet for small, ad-hoc briefings on policy issues. This past year, the Council hosted four such sessions—on missile defense, U.S. strategy toward Afghanistan, the Nuclear Posture Review, and the Nuclear Security Summit. The Council has launched a series of meetings aimed at helping senior embassy officials understand the politics and policies of the United States. The meetings give foreign diplomats access to expert Council members in a private roundtable setting. In the past year, CFR has hosted six of these meetings and connected several dozen senior foreign diplomats with experts on topics like financial regulatory reform, the U.S. economy, and the role of Congress in policymaking. The Council also offers embassy lunches, hosted by foreign ambassadors, for a small group of Council members, helping CFR membership become more familiar with issues significant to foreign governments. To address the increasing political polarization in the capital, the Council is convening a salon dinner series on bipartisanship. Led by former secretary of state Madeleine K. Albright, former White House\n\nLetter from the Co-Chairs\n\nVice Chairman Richard E. Salomon\n\n6\n\nchief of staff Kenneth M. Duberstein, former House majority leader Richard A. Gephardt, and former congressman Vin Weber, the meetings focus on practical solutions to policy challenges that can garner bipartisan support. The Council’s programming and initiatives in New York continue to grow more robust as well. Five heads of state or government have visited the New York office this past year—from Georgia, South Korea, Libya, Namibia, and Ukraine—and senior government officials have come from countries including France, the United Kingdom, Thailand, India, Turkey, and Angola, among others. The Council has hosted U.S. senior government officials from the military, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Reserve System, the Treasury Department, and the State Department, among others. The new CEO Speaker series has featured business leaders from global Fortune 500 companies in finance, energy, telecommunications, and health care. The National Program continues to cater to CFR members located outside New York and Washington, offering more than eighty meetings and nearly fifty teleconferences over the past year in addition to the annual national conference. Even as CFR continues to build on its nearly nine-decade tradition as a New York–based institution, the Council also works to strengthen its presence in the city where many U.S. policy decisions are made. CFR Vice Chairman Richard E. Salomon and our fellow Board and Council members deserve much credit for all of their guidance and insight on the Council’s Washington efforts and other institutional priorities. We would like to especially recognize Council President Richard N. Haass for his able leadership and persistent efforts to expand the reach of the Council through both traditional means and innovative approaches.\n\nThe Council’s work grows stronger each year as the institution expands programming and other initiatives in both cities, as well as nationally.\n\nCarla A. Hills Robert E. Rubin Co-Chairs of the Board\n\nLetter from the Co-Chairs\n\n7\n\nPresident’s Message\n\nA large and growing fiscal deficit, unemployment hovering near 10 percent, wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, energy security and climate change, and threats from states, terrorist groups, and viruses (computer and biological) are just a few of the many challenges facing the United States and the world. The Council on Foreign Relations is focused on all these issues and many more. With programming in New York, Washington, and nationally, outreach to targeted constituencies, Council publications, an award-winning website—CFR.org—the work of experts through books, articles, and media appearances, and the first full year in the new Washington building, the Council has been busy and productive by any measure. Major areas of focus for CFR have included assessing the Obama administration’s decision to increase troop levels in Afghanistan, prospects for U.S. relations with a rising China, tensions in the Middle East, and concerns about Iran and North Korea. On the economic side, financial volatility and serious fiscal challenges linger, driving policy debates about financial regulatory reform and how best to promote growth while exercising fiscal restraint. There are also questions about how economic limitations affect the global role of the United States. These debates are taking place against a backdrop of strong performance by emerging economies, creating a shift in the global distribution of power. And a range of other topics, including climate change, global health, relief and development in Haiti, and political and economic reform in Africa, also demand and receive attention. In an era of strong partisan division in the United States, the Council has worked hard to address the full slate of foreign policy issues in a manner consistent with its nonpartisan character and the clear need for timely and serious analysis. To this end, CFR fellows have been highly visible this year, publishing more than five hundred articles and op-eds. They have written for or been cited in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and Washington Post, as well as in Foreign Affairs, the Economist, Time, Newsweek, the Atlantic, and Foreign Policy. CFR fellows have also appeared in nearly one thousand media interviews on major television networks including ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, and MSNBC, as well as the BBC and al-Jazeera. Fellows published six books, testified before Congress thirteen times on issues ranging from climate change to immigration to U.S. relations with Africa, and briefed U.S. and foreign government officials 350 times. The Council held some five hundred events in New York, Washington, and across the country this year, along with more than two hundred smaller roundtable discussions and study groups organized by CFR fellows. Among the highlights of this year’s programming were general meetings in New York and Washington with nine heads of state, more than twenty high-ranking foreign government officials, and nearly thirty senior U.S. government officials. During the opening of the UN General Assembly, we held meetings in New York with President Lee Myungbak of South Korea, President Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine, President José Manuel Barroso of the European Commission, and Libyan leader\n\nPresident’s Message\n\nPresident Richard N. Haass\n\n8\n\nLibyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi with CFR President Richard N. Haass.\n\nMuammar al-Qaddafi, as well as the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, France, Turkey, India, and Angola. The Council held sessions as well with senior administration officials on political and national security challenges, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet A. Napolitano, General Raymond T. Odierno, Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair, and then CENTOM commander General David H. Petraeus, now the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, among others. On economic issues, the Council hosted the heads of two regional Federal Reserve Banks as well as Peter R. Orszag, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. Members also heard from former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and former Treasury secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. And as part of our ongoing focus on religion and foreign policy issues, we hosted Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Cardinal Angelo Scola. Corporate members attended more than three hundred events this year, and the Corporate Conference attracted the biggest turnout since the inaugural conference five years ago. The two-day event this year covered challenges surrounding the U.S. economy and geopolitical risk, with an opening keynote by Kenneth R. Feinberg, special master for executive compensation. The Council’s recently launched CEO Speaker series featured nine heads of leading global corporations, including Christophe de Margerie of Total, Robert E. Diamond Jr. of Barclays, Andrew P. Witty of GlaxoSmithKline, and Ivan G. Seidenberg of Verizon. As part of our continuing McKinsey Series on International Economics, we convened a panel discussion on derivatives featuring John A. Paulson, president of hedge fund Paulson & Co. And at a time of grave concerns about sovereign debt in eurozone countries, Council members met with Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central\n\nPresident’s Message\n\nThe Council has worked hard to address the full slate of foreign policy issues in a manner consistent with its nonpartisan character and the clear need for timely and serious analysis.\n\n9\n\nBank. The Council also relaunched its World Economic Update series, in which senior bankers and chief economists participate in panel discussions on geoeconomic trends. The latest session featured the head of emerging markets and credit research at JPMorgan Chase & Co., the chief economist from Bank of America, and the chief U.S. economist from Barclays Capital. Other notable meetings this year included a two-day event at the Council’s headquarters in New York on media and foreign policy to celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of CFR’s Edward R. Murrow press fellowship. The event included a panel with the news presidents from ABC, CBS, CNN, and NBC, in their first-ever joint appearance, on how to meet challenges facing the news business. Also part of the Murrow fellowship’s anniversary celebration was an event at the Newseum in Washington, supported by the Knight Foundation and the Ford Foundation, on journalism in the digital age. Participants held a discussion with panelists from three major news organizations and CFR Board member Alberto Ibargüen, president and CEO of the Knight Foundation. Finally, the Council hosted a session at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, sponsored by Bank of America, with South African artist William Kentridge. The evening included a viewing of Kentridge’s exhibition and a discussion of both his art and broader issues on the intersection of art and politics. Serving the more than one-third of Council members located outside the New York and Washington areas, the National Program was extremely active. The highlight of its programming year was the fifteenth annual National Conference, at which members explored immigration reform, U.S. policy toward Iran, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and political and economic challenges in Africa and Latin America. Half the Sky coauthors Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn opened the conference with a session on women and economic development. Also\n\nThe David Rockefeller Studies Program The David Rockefeller Studies Program is the Council’s world-class think tank.

Volcker, chairman of the President’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board and former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. National members met with a number of Council fellows throughout the year on topics ranging from Afghanistan to the Middle East to Cuba, and I hosted sessions in several cities to discuss the challenges facing the Obama administration. We also organized review sessions for the recently released Independent Task Force report on the Korean Peninsula and for Senior Fellow John Campbell’s forthcoming book on Nigeria. In addition, the National Program held roundtable sessions across the country, including a global economic update by Dennis P. Lockhart, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and a discussion on U.S. nuclear policy with former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft. National members joined nearly fifty teleconferences of New York and Washington meetings, as well as interactive conference calls; participation in both has grown by 50 percent over the past three years. The Council continued to publish a wide range of reports that set a high standard. Council reports, which are offered free on CFR.org, were downloaded a record 69,000 times. The Studies Program published eight Council Special Reports by both CFR and outside scholars: James M. Goldgeier on the future of NATO; Bronwyn E. Bruton on U.S. strategy for Somalia; Paul Lettow on the shortcomings of the nuclear nonproliferation regime; Paul B. Stares and Micah Zenko on U.S. conflict prevention capacity; Matthew C. Waxman on intervention to stop genocide and mass atrocities; Vijay Padmanabhan on the relationship between the United States and the International Criminal Court; Jeffrey Mankoff on the Russian economic crisis; and Evan A.

The David Rockefeller Studies Program’s Maurice R. Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies (CGS) featured papers on the prospects for world economic growth, the significance of measured gross financial flows, the political effects of macroeconomic imbalances, and the dangers of U.S. debt. CGS also continued to feature the Squam Lake Working Group Papers, a collection of reports on financial reform from fifteen financial economists. The most recent papers examined the regulatory framework for handling impaired financial institutions, regulation of executive compensation in financial services, and the relation of prime brokers and derivatives dealers to the financial crisis. The Center for Preventive Action, also part of the Studies Program, continued its Contingency Planning Memorandum series, which considers what the United States should do to prevent or manage potential crises that would adversely affect its interests. The series has drawn significant interest from the White House, the State Department, the intelligence community, and Congress. This year it included papers on such\n\nPresident’s Message\n\n12\n\nCorporate Program\n\nChairs of the CFR Independent Task Force on Immigration Policy Jeb Bush and Thomas F. “Mack” McLarty III.\n\npossibilities as an Israeli strike on Iran, terrorism and Indo-Pakistani escalation, and renewed conflict in Sudan. Council experts published six books. Charles A. Kupchan’s How Enemies Become Friends: The Sources of Stable Peace uses historical and present-day analysis to examine how rival states can overcome competition to form partnerships. Isobel Coleman and Vali R. Nasr both wrote about trends in Islamic societies that could help counter extremist sentiment. Coleman’s Paradise Beneath Her Feet: How Women Are Transforming the Middle East looks at how activists in Islamic societies are working within the tenets of Islam to promote women’s empowerment. Nasr’s Forces of Fortune: The Rise of the New Muslim Middle Class and What It Will Mean for Our World examines the emerging business-minded middle class in Islamic countries. On economic topics, Daniel Senor and Saul Singer’s Start-Up Nation: The Story of Israel’s Economic Miracle uncovers the factors behind Israel’s economic success. And Sebastian Mallaby’s More Money Than God: Hedge Funds and the Making of a New Elite chronicles the history of hedge funds and argues for their continued role in the economy.

CFR welcomed many global Fortune 100 and 500 members this year, including Walmart, AT&T, Telefónica International USA, and Itochu International. Exxon Mobil Corporation and Chevron Corporation generously upgraded their membership to the Founders level, joining five other firms at the highest tier of support. The Corporate Program hosted more than one hundred events, such as the annual Corporate Conference, the CEO Speaker series, and frequent roundtables, briefings, and conference calls, offering members the opportunity to interact with leading figures in business and finance. New collaborations were also established, marked by events with Bloomberg and New York’s Museum of Modern Art. The program further increased its presence in Washington, DC, with more programs for—and participation by—corporate members in the capital. This year also marked the launch of CFR’s Resources for Global Business at www.cfr.org/ corporate. This dedicated platform offers corporate members and the business community access to quality analysis from CFR scholars and other domestic and international thought leaders.\n\n13\n\nSenior Fellow Max Boot with the governor of Nawa district in the Helmand River Valley in Afghanistan.\n\nSyndrome: A History of American Hubris analyzes three eras in American history in which policymakers tried to effect sweeping change: World War I, Vietnam, and Iraq. Two new initiatives this year in the Studies Program are the Civil Society, Markets, and Democracy initiative and the Global Brazil initiative. The former, made possible by a grant from Goldman Sachs, is being led by Senior Fellow Isobel Coleman and will explore how the United States can best promote open markets and democracies around the world. Senior Fellow Julia E. Sweig is leading the Global Brazil initiative, which will examine the domestic, regional, and international dimensions of Brazil’s emergence as a world power. The Council’s Task Force Program has been busy sponsoring bipartisan reports on some of the most vexing international issues. Two Independent Task Force reports came out this year. The first, U.S. Immigration Policy, was released in July 2009 by a Task Force chaired by former Florida governor Jeb Bush and former White House chief of staff Thomas F. “Mack” McLarty III and directed by Senior Fellow Edward Alden. It offered a strategy for maintaining U.S. political and economic leadership by attracting skilled immigrants, adopting a program of earned legalization for those living in the United States illegally, and taking steps to secure the country’s borders. The Miami Herald called the report “a bipartisan blueprint for fixing our broken immigration system” and urged members of Congress to read it. The Council released the second Independent Task Force report, U.S. Policy Toward the Korean Peninsula, at what could not have been a more appropriate time, in June 2010. The Task Force was chaired by former special envoy for negotiations with North Korea Charles L. “Jack” Pritchard and former commander in chief of the UN Command for the Republic of Korea/U.S. Combined Forces/U.S. Forces Korea John H.\n\nPresident’s Message\n\nThe interactive Crisis Guide series continued to thrive, with the most recent Crisis Guide winning the Council’s second Emmy Award.\n\n14\n\nTilelli Jr. It was directed by Adjunct Senior Fellow Scott A. Snyder. The report identified three pillars of an internationally coordinated response to the threat posed by North Korea: denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, close U.S.-South Korea consultations, and active participation by China. Released just after the sinking of the South Korean ship Cheonan, the report received significant attention both in this country and in Asia. We continue to strengthen the Council’s outreach initiatives for religious leaders, educators and students, and state and local government officials. This year we launched three dedicated sections of CFR.org to serve as portals of entry to CFR resources for these constituencies. In addition, the Council hosted its third annual Religion and Foreign Policy Summer Workshop this year, bringing together a diverse group of eighty religious leaders and scholars. Religious leaders also participated in eleven sessions of the Religion and Foreign Policy Conference Call series. On the education front, we hosted two gatherings of the Higher Education Working Group, in which college and university presidents explore the role of higher education institutions in meeting the challenges posed by major global issues. Approximately 1,150 students (in 47 groups) also came through our doors for briefings with CFR fellows and staff, and 85 colleges and universities participated in our popular Academic Conference Call series, which featured 13 calls over the course of the year with CFR fellows and Foreign Affairs authors. In addition, CFR served as a valuable resource for state and local leaders, hosting 6 conference calls on issues such as immigration and the Gulf oil spill. To make the Council’s content easily accessible to a wide variety of audiences, CFR.org launched its redesigned homepage in mid-December. The redesign puts more emphasis on the work of the Studies Program and features a steady flow of Web-only content from Council fellows, such as Expert Briefs and First Takes, both of which are drawing increased media attention. Overall, CFR.org attracted an average of 1.1 million page views and 375,000 unique visitors each month.\n\nCFR.org CFR.org, the Council’s award-winning website, is a primary means of sharing CFR’s work with interested audiences around the world. Each month, more than 375,000 users access its authoritative background and analysis in a growing array of formats. Among CFR.org’s most popular features: – A daily Featured Briefing that provides a package of analysis and background information on a current topic – First Takes that offer a CFR expert’s early view of a breaking news development – From Our Experts, which showcases timely and important work from CFR’s Studies Program – More than seven hundred Backgrounders that add up to a virtual encyclopedia of foreign policy – Expert interviews conducted by former New York Times editor Bernard Gwertzman and other CFR staff on current topics – A multimedia player for viewing full-length and highlight videos of recent on-the-record CFR meetings – Two free enewsletters—the Daily News Brief (weekdays) and The World This Week (weekends)—that deliver timely coverage directly to subscribers’ inboxes – A World Events Calendar that flags upcoming international events and anniversaries, with links to relevant background material – CFR blogs, including the Asia Program’s “Asia Unbound” and Senior Fellow Michael A. Levi on energy and the environment\n\nAngola’s foreign minister Assunção Afonso dos Anjos meets Council members after his address.\n\nPresident’s Message\n\n15\n\nCFR Board members Charlene Barshefsky, Vin Weber, OAI Advisors president Odeh F.

Levi’s blog analyzing climate, energy, and nuclear issues. The Center for Geoeconomic Studies also continues to update its “Geo-Graphics” blog regularly, using graphical analysis to report on timely geoeconomic issues and offering links to news and expert commentary. Finally, the interactive Crisis Guide series continued to thrive, with the most recent Crisis Guide, on the global economy, winning the Council’s second Emmy Award. A final highlight of the Council’s outreach is a new video produced this year by Emmy Award–winning director Jesse Dylan. The four-minute video, which features a diverse range of CFR members talking about the Council’s mission and its role as a resource for a range of constituencies, enhances CFR’s presence online and across social media platforms. This list is not exhaustive, but it does give a sense of the many ways in which CFR is addressing the serious issues facing this country and the world. I have now completed seven years as president of the Council, and I continue to be impressed with and proud of the many ways the Council and those who are part of it fulfill its mission. I offer my sincere thanks to Co-Chairs Carla A. Hills and Robert E. Rubin, Vice Chair Richard E. Salomon, and the members of the Board of Directors. In addition, the Council could not do what it does without its membership, both individual and corporate, in New York, Washington, and across the United States and the world. Finally, our dedicated staff deserve much credit for all they do, day in and day out. The work of all these groups—the Council’s Board of Directors, members, and staff—helped CFR serve again this year as a trusted resource for all those who want to better understand the daunting challenges facing the United States and the world.\n\nCFR garnered over 37,000 mentions in the media during the year, up more than 9,000 from the year before.\n\nRichard N. Haass President\n\nPresident’s Message\n\n16\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nIn six issues, stretching from July/August 2009 to May/June 2010, Foreign Affairs published nineteen articles relating to U.S. power, seven on the rise of China, and six on energy and the environment. Online—at ForeignAffairs.com—the magazine published twenty-four annotated Reading Lists, covering topics from Israeli politics to the financial crisis, twelve Letters, including one from Tehran and another from Kathmandu, and numerous Snapshots and Postscripts. Several major essays evaluated the Obama administration’s progress during its first year. Zbigniew Brzezinski called on President Barack Obama to do a better job of turning his soaring rhetoric into action. The president’s ability to govern, Brzezinski said, would be tested by the immediate challenges of Iran, Afghanistan-Pakistan, and Israel-Palestine. Kenneth Roth lamented that Obama had not lived up to his campaign promises to end Bush-era human rights abuses. Barry Eichengreen and C. Fred Bergsten assessed how the financial crisis would affect the U.S. dollar. Bergsten urged further steps to balance the budget and stimulate private savings. Meanwhile, Josef Joffe, Niall Ferguson, and Michael Mandelbaum debated whether U.S. preeminence is here to stay or could quickly wane, and whether the United States should lament its demise. Even as the future of U.S. hegemony remained in question, it was clear that China was becoming more powerful. Robert D. Kaplan wrote that its need for natural resources, markets, and greater security is pushing China to increase its influence over neighboring territories and seas. Ken Miller examined China’s financial strategies and the challenge they present. Marc Levinson argued that global financial regulations would do more harm than good. He favored coordinated regulations by nationstates over remedies proffered by multilateral committees. An annotated online Reading List provided by George J. Gilboy provided context to these discussions. As China reaches out, other countries will need to deal with internal problems: Bronwyn E. Bruton wrote that the United States should renounce intervention in Somalia and encourage local development; Charles King and Rajan Menon identified the Caucasus as Russia’s looming challenge; and Robert C. Bonner explored how Mexico could target its drug cartels, using lessons from Colombia’s war on drugs. In a lead essay on U.S. defense policy, Robert M. Gates explained that rather than fighting allies’ wars, the United States will need to help them better defend themselves. In a separate essay, Brzezinski marked the sixtieth anniversary of NATO by calling for it to become the hub of a web of regional security organizations. Charles A. Kupchan argued that it was time to seriously consider including Russia in NATO to achieve Europe-wide security. Dmitri Trenin evaluated the prospects of a “reset” relationship between Russia and the United States, and Andrei Lankov concluded that only internal initiatives would lessen North Korean intransigence. Meanwhile, Morton I. Abramowitz and Henri J. Barkey evaluated the implications for U.S. policy of Turkey’s expansive courting of Iran and its souring on Israel. Evan A. Feigenbaum, George R.\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nForeign Affairs editor James F. Hoge Jr.\n\n17\n\nGideon Rose, Clare Lockhart, and James F. Dobbins at a Foreign Affairs LIVE meeting on the theory and practice of state-building.\n\nPackard, and Yoichi Funabashi evaluated the prospects and possible pitfalls of developments within U.S. allies India and Japan. Wesley K. Clark and Peter L. Levin wrote that the threat of cyber warfare required Washington to quickly secure computer networks, software, and hardware. Graham T. Allison and Charles D. Ferguson took opposing sides on the practicality of the Obama administration’s goal of reducing the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. Keir A. Lieber and Daryl G. Press warned that the United States must retain the right nuclear weapons capabilities lest adversaries conclude that Washington’s nuclear strategy rests largely on bluff. James M. Lindsay and Ray Takeyh argued that the United States could successfully contain Iran in the event that Tehran gains a nuclear weapons capability. In online Snapshots, Andrew J. Tabler counseled the Obama administration to restart investigations on Syria’s reactor in order to gain leverage over Damascus, and Rashid Khalidi and Bret Stephens debated whether the end of Israeli settlements would bring peace to the region once and for all. Countering terrorists and insurgency in Afghanistan comprised another major theme this year. Jessica Stern described how terrorists could be rehabilitated, citing Saudi Arabia’s partially successful reeducation program. Stephen Biddle, Fotini Christia, and J Alexander Thier urged the Obama administration to give up on building an Afghan centralized state and aim instead for decentralized democracy. Sheri Berman drew parallels between state building in Louis XIV’s France and in Afghanistan today. In an online Snapshot, George Gavrilis called for the United States to use the international community’s intervention in Tajikistan as a model. In an online letter from Kabul, Kim Barker described the major problems U.S. forces face: corruption, warlords, and the Taliban. With the Copenhagen round of climate talks having taken place in December, and the next round on the horizon, Foreign Affairs continued its coverage of environmental and energy issues. Michael A. Levi forecasted that the Copenhagen talks would end in deadlock and, in a Web\n\nForeign Affairs\n\n18\n\nPostscript, compared his predictions with the actual outcomes. Jessica Seddon Wallack and Veerabhadran Ramanathan argued that reducing “black carbon” would be a viable way to fight global warming and Joel Kurzman called for a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. David G. Victor and Linda Yueh described the pressure that a growing demand for green energy, and for energy in developing countries, is putting on the International Energy Agency, and Edward L. Morse and Christof Rühl discussed oil markets after the economic crisis. These articles were accompanied by Morse’s online Reading List on oil and Victor’s on climate change. Laurie A. Garrett examined the viability of Cuba’s expensive healthcare system, particularly in a post-embargo world. Yale president Richard C. Levin told of the aggressive efforts to raise the quality of Asian universities, and Jack A. Goldstone illustrated the major demographic changes to which global institutions will have to adapt. Isobel Coleman put the spotlight on efforts to empower women in the Muslim world. Though the economic downturn continued to depress advertising revenue and newsstand sales, overall magazine circulation remained healthy. Average paid circulation of 157,566 for calendar year 2009 was down only 2 percent from 2008. The magazine’s website generated 14 percent more new subscriptions in the first half of 2010 than in the same period last year, and increased efficiencies in production and distribution contributed to the continued profitability of the magazine. During the past year, more than 7,500 readers downloaded bimonthly issues through the Amazon Kindle, Barnes & Noble Nook, and Sony Reader. Two Foreign Affairs ebooks—The Clash of Civilizations? The Debate and China on the World Stage—were developed for the eReader market in collaboration with CFR Publishing. In response to a demand from international readers for timelier and less costly delivery, a digitalonly subscription is in development. Other digital initiatives include a platform for mobile delivery of content on smartphones, as well as a section of the website to host audio and video content. Foreign Affairs Live, entering its third season this fall, has drawn more than two thousand readers to discussions with authors and editors in a lively public forum.\n\nDuring the past year, more than 7,500 readers downloaded bimonthly issues through the Amazon Kindle, Barnes & Noble Nook, and Sony Reader.\n\nJames F.

Meacham\n\n21\n\n2010 Board Election\n\nThe Council’s By-Laws provide for a Board consisting of thirty-five Directors (plus the President, ex officio), divided into five classes of seven Directors. Each class serves for a term of five years. In each class, three Directors are elected by the membership and four are appointed by the Board. Directors with terms expiring on June 30, 2010, were Peter Ackerman, Charlene Barshefsky, Tom Brokaw, Frank J. Caufield, Martin S. Feldstein, Ronald L. Olson, and David M. Rubenstein. The Nominating and Governance Committee was composed of Henry S. Bienen (Chair), Madeleine K. Albright, Mary McInnis Boies, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, Kenneth M. Duberstein, Bart Friedman, Nancy A. Jarvis, Kenneth I. Juster, Maria Elena Lagomasino, Edward J. Mathias, Theodore Roosevelt IV, Stanley S. Shuman, G. Richard Thoman, R. Keith Walton, and Christine Todd Whitman. On December 16, 2009, the Chair invited the Council membership to propose possible candidates. The Nominating and Governance Committee met on March 15, 2010, to consider the pool of names suggested by Council members for the three elective vacancies. Mindful of its mandate to consider “the need for diversity with regard to age, sex, race, geographical representation, and professional background,” the Nominating and Governance Committee developed the following slate of nominees for the Class of 2015: John P. Abizaid, Seth F. Berkley, Tom Brokaw, Pamela Brooks Gann, Robert M. Kimmitt, and Frances Fragos Townsend. Candidates running unopposed to fill the balance of an unexpired term were Penny S. Pritzker (Class of 2011) and Joseph S. Nye Jr. (Class of 2013). On March 26, Council members were notified of the slate and of the petition process available to them in accordance with the By-Laws. No petition candidate was put forth. A ballot was mailed to all Council members on April 29. At the Annual Meeting for the Election of Directors on June 3, 2010, 1,635 members participated in person or by proxy, fulfilling the quorum required by By-Law V. No name was written on ten or more ballots cast at the meeting, and, therefore, no one was nominated for the 2011 election by the write-in procedure outlined in the By-Laws. Sarah A.W. Fitts, Donald S. Rice, and Nancy Young served as election overseers. The following nominees were elected for five-year terms beginning July 1, 2010, and expiring June 30, 2015: John P. Abizaid, Tom Brokaw, and Pamela Brooks Gann. Under current procedures, the Board completed the Class of 2015 by appointing four Directors. Acting on the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, at its June 10 meeting the Board appointed four Council members to serve five-year terms as Directors in the Class of 2015, beginning July 1, 2010, and expiring June 30, 2015: Peter Ackerman, Mary McInnis Boies, Martin S. Feldstein, and David M. Rubenstein. Additionally, in accordance with By-Law IV(C), Penny S. Pritzker was elected to the Class of 2011 and Joseph S. Nye Jr. was elected to the Class of 2013.\n\n2010 Board Election\n\n22\n\nHistorical Roster of Directors and Officers\n\nIsaiah Bowman Archibald Cary Coolidge Paul D. Cravath John W. Davis Norman H.

With nearly 4,500 members, CFR’s ranks include top government officials, renowned scholars, influential business leaders, acclaimed journalists, prominent lawyers, and distinguished nonprofit professionals. The current membership is divided almost equally among New York, Washington, DC, and across the country and abroad. Unmatched in accomplishment and diversity in the field of international affairs, members participate in meetings, panel discussions, interviews, lectures, book clubs, and film screenings to discuss and debate the major foreign policy issues of our time. Members have unparalleled access to world leaders, senior government officials, members of Congress, and prominent thinkers. S T epHEN M. K ELLEN T ER M MEMBER PRO GR AM In 1970, a term membership program was established to cultivate the next generation of foreign policy leaders. The Stephen M. Kellen Term Member Program encourages promising young leaders from diverse backgrounds to engage in a sustained conversation on international affairs and U.S. foreign policy. Each year, individuals between the ages of thirty and thirty-six are elected to a five-year term. The Term Member Program has grown considerably since it was established almost forty years ago, with the number of term members now indexed at up to 15 percent of the total CFR membership. Candidates for term membership must be between the ages of thirty and thirty-six on January 1 of the year in which their election takes place. Term membership elections are held in June each year. For more information on term membership, please visit www.cfr.org/about/term_member_program. APPLYING F OR MEMBER SH IP Quality, diversity, and balance are the main objectives sought by CFR in the composition of its membership. New members are named twice a year by the Board of Directors, which invites selected men and women to join based on the recommendations of the Membership Selection Committee. The committee, which meets twice a year, is composed of five members of the Board and other non-Board members the committee chair appoints. Candidates for membership must be nominated in writing by a current CFR member and seconded by three other individuals (maximum of four). To be considered for term membership, candidates must be nominated by a current CFR member and seconded by two other individuals (maximum of three). The roster of members is listed in this annual report and is regularly updated at www.cfr.org/about/membership/roster.html. It is not required that seconding letters come from CFR members, but it is strongly encouraged, and it is recommended that at least one letter is from a current or former professional colleague. All candidates must complete an online application, which can be accessed only by contacting Membership Affairs at [email protected] or 212.434.9484. All materials, including sponsor letters, must be submitted using the online application. Membership is restricted to citizens of the United States or permanent residents who have made formal application to become a citizen. If foreign-born, the candidate must submit a written statement that he or she has met this requirement.\n\nMembership\n\n26\n\nAPPLIC AT ION R EQUIR EMEN T S – Letter of nomination from a CFR member; – Three seconding letters for membership (maximum of four) or two seconding letters for term membership (maximum of three); and – Completion of online application. SP ONSOR ING A C ANDIDAT E F OR MEMBER SH IP The Council on Foreign Relations relies on its members for their engagement, substantive contributions, and support, and counts on members to identify and propose qualified prospects for membership. Membership development efforts are focused on identifying and attracting diverse leaders in international affairs across all sectors. Members are advised to commit themselves to supporting a candidacy only when they can fairly meet the requirements of the process and the expectations of the candidates who depend on them for assistance. Members should write only in support of candidates whom they know well. Additionally, members are encouraged to make comparative judgments about candidates where appropriate. The committee also advises members to write no more than two letters per round (either one nominating and one seconding letter or two seconding letters). NOMINAT ING LET T ER S\n\nCandidates must be nominated by a CFR member. Thoughtful, candid, and succinct comments are far more important than formal endorsements of candidates. The first paragraph of a nomination letter must include a clear and comprehensive statement about the nature of the relationship between the candidate and the letter writer. Nomination letters should be no more than five hundred words and should address the following criteria: – intellectual attainment and expertise; – degree of experience, interest, and current involvement in international affairs or in other areas affecting international affairs; – promise of future achievement and service in foreign relations; – potential contributions to the work of CFR; – desire and ability to participate in CFR activities; and – standing among his or her peers. SECONDING LET T ER S\n\nSeconding letters need not be as comprehensive (and should be no more than three hundred words) but should amplify why, in the opinion of the writer, a given candidate should be considered for CFR membership. In seconding letters particularly, writers should express why a given candidate should be considered for CFR membership for reasons beyond the basic criteria cited and should draw comparisons, when possible, to other individuals. The first paragraph of seconding letters must also include a clear and comprehensive statement about the nature of the relationship between the candidate and the letter writer. ADDI T iONAL RULE S AND R EGUL AT IONS T O CONSIDER Candidates or their nominators are responsible for ensuring that all required application materials are submitted by the filing deadlines. Please also note the following: – Officers of CFR as well as members of the Board of Directors and the Membership Selection Committee are precluded from nominating or writing seconding letters on any candidate’s behalf. – A member who is a spouse, close relative (a parent, sibling, cousin, or the like), or near in-law of a candidate may not formally propose or second that candidate for membership in CFR. Members should also refrain from writing on behalf of clients. – CFR visiting fellows are prohibited from applying for membership until they have completed their fellowship tenure. DE ADLINE S, C ANDIDAT E NOT IFIC AT ION, and R E APPLIC AT ION Strict observance of deadlines is essential to staff support of the Membership Selection Committee’s work. Applications not completed prior to the deadline for any given committee meeting will\n\nMembership\n\n27\n\nnot be considered at that time, but they will remain on file and can be submitted for a future meeting once completed. All membership candidates and their nominators will receive notification of the committee’s decisions according to the schedule below. application deadline notification Membership March 1 June October 1 February Term Membership November 1 June Candidates who are unsuccessful at any given meeting may remain eligible for consideration at subsequent meetings of the committee if the criteria are met. An application may be reactivated by submitting an updated CV and nominee information using the online application along with a minimum of one and maximum of three additional letters of support. Candidates may submit new letters from previous letter writers only when new content is included. If a candidate is not elected after two consecutive meetings, the application will be placed on hold for a period of three years for membership candidates and one year for term membership candidates. After the hold period, the candidate may reactivate the file for consideration. For term membership applicants, the hold period does not apply if a candidate would be ineligible to reapply because of age. The process is entirely one of affirmative selection from the large and evolving pool of nominees.
