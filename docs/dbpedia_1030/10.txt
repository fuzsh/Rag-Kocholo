into Iraq to envelop the Republi-

“Soldiers in combat rarely get

to choose their missions but wit's

not so much the missions soldiers

are given as how they grab those

missions and carry them out”

continued Franks.

Franks praised the division for

the rapidity with in which they

moved during the war. According

to Franks the 1st Cav Div was a

msgor and decisive force in the

fast and lethal allied victory.

fixed his gaze on soldiers catching

a few last winks in the nearby

hangars before their voyage north-

ward. The scene was reminiscent

of his arrival in Vietman as a pri-

Saudi Arabia and then on into

sion.

getting the division ready to re-

turn to a peacetime mission.

“Soldiers are the resource for

everything we do” he explained.

“To gather a bunch of Military

in their individual fields and be

bia I’m sure we can do the job

again.”

“I’m not so sure I’ll change

anything. Everything looks great

in the division” said Paez. ‘The

standards are high and I will keep

that. I want to encourage more

military courtesy more involve-

ment of the noncommissioned of-

ficer and getting soldiers back in

school. Things I think will help

the Army of the future.”

Paez first heard of the 1st Cav

Div coming to the Middle East in

August and was assigned to the

7th Army Training Command in

Germany.

“I WAS elated and overjoyed

when I heard Maj. Gen. John H.

Tilelli Jr. wanted me” he ex-

claimed. “I came as fast as I could

and feel very proud to be one of 16

division command sergeants ma-

jor in the Army.”

‘The soldiers in the Cavalry

will see more of me” Paez said.

‘You’ll never know where I’ll be

but I always treat soldiers with

respect and professionalism. I

remember where I came from being

a draftee some 27 years ago.”

This is not the first time the

San Antonio native has worked

with the 1st Cav Div. He first

came to Fort Hood in 1972 and

has made many friends within the

unit since then.

“As I go through the division

everyday I find people I knew

back in the 70s.” With a slight

laugh he said remember when

soldiers being assigned to Fort

Hood used to arrive at the one bus

station in Killeen. Now they fly

into the local airport.”

“Families have been the cor-

nerstone of support while we have

been here” said the father of three

children. ‘They too have endured

many hardships. With all the sol-

diers coming back this summer

there should be one big celebra-

tion in Killeen. It’s going to be a

joyous occasion to see the soldiers

with their families.”
