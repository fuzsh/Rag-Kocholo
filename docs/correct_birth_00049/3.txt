During a Saturday stop in Winterset, Iowa, we visited the birthplace of actor John Wayne. Born May 26, 1907 to Clyde and Mary Morrison, Wayne’s boyhood home is located just off the city’s main square. The tiny white home—restored to appear as it did in 1907—is surrounded by a statue of the western star, a small gift shop and, if fundraising goes well, a John Wayne Museum.

We passed on the 20-minute tour of the actor’s birthplace—cost is $7 for adults—so we weren’t able to go inside his boyhood home, but we spent some time wandering the grounds and perusing the many John Wayne-themed items inside the shop. We even spotted a van painted as an homage to The Legend himself.
