        "text": "This museum and attraction is an American institution. John Wayne was an American actor who embodied the brute cowboy image and personified patriotism. The John Wayne Birthplace and Museum were established in 1982, three years after the legend’s death. The 6,100 square foot museum pays homage to the late icon. Of note the museum is adjacent to the home where the actor was born; both properties are available for tours. With an excessively diverse exhibit of John Wayne artifacts, original movie posters, film costumes, important written documents, and artwork, there are tons to see for the John Wayne enthusiast in your group. Additionally, you can even sneak a peek at one of John Wayne’s last customized cars. The facility even includes a movie theatre wherein you can enjoy a short documentary on John Wayne’s life. If you’re looking for historical, American activities to do in Iowa, be sure to pay John Wayne Birthplace and Museum a visit. Address: 205 S John Wayne Dr, Winterset, IA 50273, United States"
