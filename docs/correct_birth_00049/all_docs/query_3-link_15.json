        "text": "Background\n\nJohn Wayne was born in Winterset, Iowa to war veteran Clyde Leonard Morrison and Mary Alberta Brown. Wayne was of English, Irish and Scotch-Irish descent. In 1916, his family moved to Glendale, California, and he attended Glendale Union High School. Wayne excelled in sports and academics, and was on the football team. He also played for the team in the 1924 league championship. After high school, he enrolled at the University of Southern California, where he received an athletic scholarship and majored in pre-law. However, a bodysurfing accident, which broke his collarbone, truncated his athletic dreams and degree.\n\nHe soon began working for Fox Film and was given small parts. However, in 1930, he received his first lead role in “The Big Trail.” He chose the alias “John Wayne” as his screen name. After his debut lead role, Wayne was relegated to smaller parts again. He landed his second breakthrough role in 1939 in “Stagecoach.” After World War II, at which time Wayne’s age was an exempting factor, he starred in his first color film, “Shepherd of the Hills” (1941). By 1949, Wayne was nominated for an Oscar, and by 1952 he had co-founded a production company called Batjac. Through this company, Wayne produced several of his films. His company was responsible for “Seven Men From Now” (1956) and “Gun the Man Down” (1956). Wayne appeared in multiple films after this. In 1960, he was nominated for Best Picture for “The Alamo” as its director and producer. In his late career, Wayne starred in “The Cowboys” (1972), “The Shootist” (1976), and several more films.\n\nHe was diagnosed with stomach cancer and died on June 11, 1979. Wayne was survived by seven children from two marriages and several grandchildren. He was married thrice, but his second wife, Esperanza Baur, bore no children."
