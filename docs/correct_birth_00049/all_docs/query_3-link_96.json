Marion Michael \"John Wayne\" Morrison,\n\nHollywood Actor and Film Star (my 9th cousin, once removed) b. 26 May 1907 in Winterset, IA - d. 11 Jun 1979 in Los Angeles, CA at age 72\n\nMarion Michael \"John Wayne\" MORRISON was born in Winterset, Iowa on May 26, 1907.

The family headed for California where he grew to be a 6'4\", 225-pound captain of his high school football team, and became known as \"Duke\", after the name of his pet dog.\n\nWayne's neighbors were in the movie business, so it was natural that one day on a lark, he and some teammates would audition for a football film. From there, he graduated to bit roles and behind-the-scenes work, which eventually provided him a job when his college tuition money ran out. One day, he wa awarded a starring role in a movie, The Big Trail. Although the film flopped, it helped proper his career. His name is listed in almost every classic western movie. He was a highly honored actor, winning a coveted Oscar in 1969 for a starring role in True Grit.\n\nHe personified Americanism for millions. The day after John Wayne died in 1979 at the age of 72, Congress voted to award him its highest honor, the Congressional Gold Medal.
