        "text": "(1907–79). During a career that spanned five decades, U.S. motion-picture actor John Wayne became a screen legend and an almost mythic folk hero as he typified the two-fisted, red-blooded American cowboy and military man. In many ways he personified the idealized American values of his era.\n\nBorn Marion Robert Morrison (his name was changed to Marion Michael after the birth of his younger brother) on May 26, 1907, in Winterset, Iowa, he gained the nickname “Duke” when he was a boy. In 1925 he enrolled at the University of Southern California at Los Angeles, where he played football. During summers he worked as a propman at the Fox Film Corporation and developed a friendship with director John Ford, who cast him in some small film roles starting in 1928. His first leading role—where he used the name “John Wayne”—came in The Big Trail (1930). Over the next eight years Wayne starred in more than 60 low-budget motion pictures, mostly in roles as cowboys, soldiers, and other rugged men of adventure. The movie to generate the most buzz was Ford’s classic western Stagecoach (1939).\n\nAlthough Wayne has been accused of avoiding military service during World War II, evidence suggests that he was rejected from the Navy because of his age and an old football injury. Nevertheless, during the war years he entertained troops overseas and made popular action-adventure films such as Flying Tigers (1942), The Fighting Seabees (1944), They Were Expendable (1945), and Back to Bataan (1945). He also starred in melodramas such as The Spoilers (1942) and Flame of the Barbary Coast (1945).\n\nWayne made many classic films with directors Ford and Howard Hawks during the postwar years and into the early 1960s. For Ford, Wayne starred in the westerns Fort Apache (1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), Rio Grande (1950), The Searchers (1956), and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). Wayne also appeared in films for Ford that were not westerns, including standouts such as The Quiet Man (1952) and Donovan’s Reef (1963). Hawks’s collaborations with Wayne included the westerns Red River (1948), Rio Bravo (1959), El Dorado (1967), and Rio Lobo (1970).\n\nWayne also worked on films with other directors, including Sands of Iwo Jima (1949), in which his performance as a tough Marine sergeant earned an Oscar nomination. Other movies he starred in are Hondo (1953), a classic western filmed in 3D; The Alamo (1960), in which Wayne both directed and starred; The Longest Day (1962) and In Harm’s Way (1965), two World War II epics; and McLintock! (1963), a western comedy. Wayne earned an Academy Award for best actor for his portrayal of U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn in True Grit (1969). His final film, The Shootist, was released in 1976. Wayne died on June 11, 1979, in Los Angeles, Calif. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom."
