        "text": "WINTERSET, Iowa - In the living room of the tiny clapboard house where John Wayne was born, our tour guide explained that \"Duke's\" family moved to this town southwest of Des Moines in 1906 so his father could work in a pharmacy. They left in 1911 for Wayne's father to take a similar job in nearby Earlham.\n\n\"So how old was John Wayne when the family left this house?\" I asked the guide.\n\n\"Three,\" she said, and continued with his life story.\n\nOur nation's most iconic movie star couldn't tie his shoes when he left this house, but if you think that demeans the value of the most famous home in this little town, 30,000 annual visitors disagree.\n\nStanding in the room where baby Wayne took his first breath - a dim, back corner space about 8 feet wide and 15 feet long - brings an inevitable hush to the tourists who come from all 50 states and dozens of countries.\n\nSome cry.\n\nLike the rest of the house, that room is stuffed with period-era furniture and memorabilia from Duke's career, including photos from the 160 films starring the former Marion Robert Morrison and an eye patch he wore in the original \"True Grit.\" (The Coen Brothers remake got 10 Oscar nods yesterday, including a best actor, for Jeff Bridges in Wayne's iconic role.)\n\nWayne's birthplace makes clear that his greatness wasn't just a product of the screen; it was in his journey from heartland modesty to West Coast fame. It was classic American success, even if, despite pleas from Winterset leaders, he apparently never returned.\n\nIf true, that was too bad for Duke, because the town of 4,800 could have been built on a studio back lot. A handsome limestone courthouse anchors the town square while the usual small-town suspects orbit on all sides: the movie theater, the shoe store, the pharmacy (with requisite soda counter) and so on.\n\nWinterset is blessed with several attractions: George Washington Carver lived here briefly in the late 1880s and is honored with a small park. It also is the seat of Madison County, as in \"The Bridges of Madison County.\" The book and the Clint Eastwood movie have sent countless tourists here in search of covered bridges.\n\nUntil Wayne died in 1979, much of Winterset didn't give a lick about being John Wayne's birthplace. But, as with many celebrities, death was a great career move.\n\nIn 1982, the nonprofit John Wayne Birthplace Society bought the house. It has raised $1 million of a targeted $5.5 million for a museum. Until then, it offers visitors a 7 1/2-foot bronze Wayne statue (rifle in hand), a well-stocked gift shop (John Wayne beef jerky, anyone?) and 20-minute tours of the house, though there isn't far to wander in 860 square feet.\n\nThe main event centers on Wayne's May 26 birthday, when a party draws close to 10,000 visitors. For two days, it's all Wayne: an auction, music, food and, of course, movie screenings. Not everyone enjoys it.\n\n\"Every year for the party I get out of town,\" said a woman who lives nearby and didn't want to be named.\n\n\"Too many people in my back yard. But I get it. Hell, it's John Wayne. He's an icon. And the people need to see something.\""
