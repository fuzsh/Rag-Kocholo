Be sure to explore our gift shop’s wide assortment of John Wayne merchandise perfect for souvenirs or great new items to add to your collection. You’ll be fascinated as you linger and learn about John Wayne the actor, the private citizen and an American legend.\n\nThe life story of John Wayne began here in Winterset, Iowa. He was born Marion Robert Morrison on May 26, 1907, the son of Clyde and Mary Brown Morrison. Step back in time and picture the life of a young midwestern boy and his family near the turn of the 20th century. The modest four-room home has been restored to reflect its appearance in 1907. Adjacent to the home, the John Wayne Birthplace Museum is open daily and offers the largest diversified collection of John Wayne artifacts in existence, including movie posters, film wardrobe, original scripts, contracts, letters, artwork and sculpture — even one of his last custom-built cars. Our gift shop carries a wide assortment of John Wayne merchandise perfect for souvenirs or great items to add to your collection.\n\nSaveSave"
