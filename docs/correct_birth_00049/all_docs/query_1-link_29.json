        "text": "The Nickname “Duke”\n\nIn 1916, the Morrison family moved to Glendale, California. The small town was an idyllic spot for the Morrison family with its temperate climate and bustling yet quaint community. It was while living in Glendale that Marion acquired the nickname, Duke. The Morrison’s dog Duke, an Airedale, was Marion’s constant companion. Marion would visit the local firehouse accompanied by his dog. The firefighters knew the dog’s name and started calling Marion “Duke” as well. The name stuck.\n\nMarion Morrison’s High School Years\n\nA member of the class of 1925, Duke Morrison attended Glendale High School, where he was active in sports and school activities. Duke played football as a member of the Class B and champion Varsity teams and excelled as a 170-pound guard. Duke thrived at academics, earning the Bronze Honor Pin and contributing to the school newspaper, the Explosion, as a sports writer. Active in student government, Duke was junior class representative and vice president, and later elected president for the class of ’25. Duke also enjoyed social activities, serving as chairman of the senior class dance and reception committee.\n\nDuke Morrison at University of Southern California\n\nDuke’s athletic ability as a 170-pound guard and his academic excellence earned him a college scholarship to the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, California. He was active in social activities, joining Sigma Chi fraternity, and continued his academic success studying pre-law. While at USC, Morrison, along with a few of his football teammates, worked part-time at what was then Fox Film Corp. Morrison worked as a member of the swing gang moving set props, and as the occasional extra, often playing a football player. During 1926 and 1927, Morrison appeared on screen as a Yale football player in “Brown of Harvard” (1926) and a USC football player in “Drop Kick” (1927).\n\nOn the Open Water\n\nWayne’s greatest pleasure was spending time with his family and friends, especially aboard the Wild Goose. Originally a converted wooden naval minesweeper (USS YMS 328) christened and launched by the U.S. Navy on December 19, 1942, deep-sea fishing, swimming, water skiing and card games with friends and family took center stage. Upon moving to Newport Beach, California where he would live for nearly two decades, the Wild Goose became a familiar site in Newport Harbor.\n\nLung Cancer\n\nConsidered at the time to be a taboo topic, Wayne was encouraged to keep news of his lung cancer diagnosis private. Unconcerned with the impact on his image or career, he didn’t heed such warnings, telling the press, “there is a hell of a lot of good image in John Wayne beating cancer.” Though he would lose a lung in battling the disease, it did not stop him from continuing with physically challenging and demanding roles – from fighting oil well fires in “Hellfighters” (1968) to fighting on the front lines in “The GreenBerets” (1968) – portrayals difficult with two lungs!\n\nWayne became a passionate advocate for early checkups, doing numerous public service announcements for the American Cancer Society, as shown in this magazine.\n\nCongressional Gold Medal\n\nApproved by Congress on Wayne’s 72nd birthday, the Congressional Gold Medal inscribed simply “John Wayne – American,” was presented to John Wayne’s family in March 1980. Among friends offering testimony in support of the Congressional bill was a longtime friend and former co-star, Maureen O’Hara Blair.\n\nWayne became a passionate advocate for early checkups, doing numerous public service announcements for the American Cancer Society, as shown in this magazine."
