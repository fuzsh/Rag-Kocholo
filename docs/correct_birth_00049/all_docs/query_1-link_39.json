        "text": "Post by neferetus on\n\nJohn Farkis sums up his Wayne Birthday Experiences (From thealamofilm site)\n\nHowdy, Pilgrim. Well, listen and listen tight.\n\nFriday was a great day; around 74 degrees, bright blue sky with wisps of clouds. Couldn't be better. The Iowa theater had free showings of \"True Grit\", Stagecoach\" and \"The Shootist\" People were lined up all the way down the street outside the show. At the birthplace house, a chuckwagon supper was held that evening, while a VIP Fundraising event took place at the Stony Creek Inn in Des Moines. Over 200 people were in there, including many of the Wayne extended family including Ethan, Aissa, Melinda, Melinda's son Father Mark Munoz, and many, many grandchildren. A taped interview was played from Harry Carey, jr as well as Maureen O'Hara expressing their best wishes on this great day. A few members of the political arena expressed their thoughts (including a Presidental candidate from Kansas) and we got down to a great dinner. I was fortunate enough to sit at the table where Jason Ramos, the architect on the Wayne Museum and Learning Center, and Dave Trask, the Chairmen of the Board of the John Wayne Birthplace Society, Ltd, were sitting. It was nice to get a little inside information as to the timing, direction, etc. of the new Museum. Bob Boze Bell, Dean Smith, Ed Faulkner, A.C. Lyles, Gregg Palmer and many other individuals were there to entertain the dining members. (A.C. is a Paramount producer who won the Golden Spur award along with Duke in 1966.) We all sang Happy Birthday to Duke and Gregg Palmer did a teriffic impression of Gary Cooper, Jimmy Stewart and Duke riding into town. He also recited \"America-why I love her\" and there wasn't a dry eye in the house.\n\nAfter the dinner, we had a short musical break and finished up the evening with an exciting auction. Lobby cards, photos, autographed cowboy hats, posters, etc were all quickly bid upon and won. One of the items was autographed painting which rapidly escalated to over $5,000 before it was won. Really exciting!!! An individual donated a few Wayne costumes from his personal collection to the Museum and tickets from a Wayne anniversary saddle were also sold. All in all, it was just a great evening. (Ned, I met Jan from Denmark and we had a nice conversation about Kaj.) One of the nice things about this was that I was able to tape the whole evening.) Jennifer Wayne, the daughter of Aissa, and extremely pretty, ended the evening by singing two songs, one of which was called \"God Bless John Wayne\". I spoke with her and it will be out on CD shortly.\n\nPeople were lined up all day long to get into the Wayne birthplace and authors were there to autograph their books. Your's truly even made contact with the gift store manager and I might have my \"Alamo Village\" book sold there in the future. After spending a whole lot of money on more Wayne related items, I toured the birthplace home and was suprised as to how small it was. As Ethan said, \"My father said his den is bigger than that whole house.\n\nWith fond memories, I headed back to Des Moines, looking forward to another great day.\n\nMore later.\n\nPost by neferetus on\n\nMore Duke Memories from John Farkis:\n\nWell, it's raining cats and dogs! What a lousy day. Many of the scheduled events were either postponed or cancelled entirely. Again the Iowa theater showed free movies; \"Rio Lobo\", \"The Sands of Iwo Jima\", and \"Rio Bravo\".\n\nI headed over to the birthplace first thing and got there around 8:00AM. By that time the place was packed with a line all the way down the block. The parade was expected to start around 10:00AM and for awhile, the rain stopped, but eventually it started up again. About 30 members of the Wayne family showed up at the house and you would have thought it was a movie premiere with all the camera flashes going off. The parade continued with many horsemen from the \"Wild West Revue\" taking part. It was pretty cool, I can tell you. Umbrellas were out by the hundreds.\n\nAfter it finished, it was time for the ground breaking ceremony. I quickly hustled over there for a good view as there was no seating except for the family and invited guests. Around 40 family members and hundreds of fans showed up to watch the unvailing of the statue and the ground breaking itself. Actually, a shovel is no longer used unless you consider it being a steam shovel. Ethan started to tear down the Conoco station on the corner where the new $5.5 million dollar Museum will be constructed. It will be around 8,500 sq ft and have a gift shop, 50 seat movie theater, gallery and display area. It will take about a year to open the complex, which backers hope to have open by May 26, 2009. Bricks and granite slabs will be available for purchase. A 7 ft statue of Duke was also unvailed and it looked extremely realistic. Accurate right down to the Red River D belt buckle and a '92 Winchester. Again, many individuals were there to pay tribute to Wayne and we all sang Happy Birthday once again. As I was standing right next to the speakers, I was able to make a really good sound tape of the event. People who know me know I carry around a tape recorder all the time. You never know. Also took some more orders for my book.\n\nDue to the rain, the Fairgrounds were too slippery to have the Wild West show, but \"The Great Western Mercantile Emporium\" still took place. Great food and great items to purchase. Michael Martin Murphey had several concerts as well. KG & The Ranger, \"Highway Home bluegrass band\", and others were scheduled to perform.\n\nTo wrap up the day, I headed over to \"The Cowboy Symposium\" held at the Winterset high school auditorium. Hosted by Boyd Magers, noted Western film author and publisher of \"Western Clippings\" newsletter, it also included Dean Smith, Ed Faulkner, Gregg Palmer, and A.C. Lyles. A noted wardrobe manager was also present, but even though he signed my book, I can't make out his name. It'll come to me. (I think it was Lester Baylen). Film clips were shown and great stories were told. We all sang Happy Birthday once again, and ironically, as I sit here and write this, a small blurb about it just was shown on CNN. The highlight of the Symposium had to be the surprise appearance of Pilar Wayne. Still a beautiful woman. I had the opportunity to speak with her as well as Aissa, Jennifer and Ethan and I tell you, I'm still on cloud 9!!! There had to be several hundred fans there and after the event, all the guests were out in the hall, signing pictures and talking with the fans. As usual, I taped this as well.\n\nNow I'm back in Des Moines packing for the plane ride home. Ihe sun is hining and everything is right with the world. I'll probably have to pay a weight penalty on my luggage for all the stuff I'm bringing back, but it's worth it. The celebration goes on again tomorrow, but duty calls and I must go home. There will be free showings of \"The Quiet Man\", and \"The Searchers\", (my all-time favorite next to \"The Alamo\". Big surprise, right?). Father Mark will celebrate mass, The Emporium will be held again as will the Symposium and the weekend wraps up with a \"Riders in the Sky\" concert. I burned out my camera battery but purchased a disposable camera so once I get the pictures developed, I try and post them. So that's about it, great time, great weekend. If you ever get a chance, try and get down there. You won't be disappointed. Happy Birthday Duke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
