        "text": "Iowa once again pays tribute to its swaggering cowboy of a native son — a celebration that California recently refused.\n\nWINTERSET, Ia. — A columnist doesn’t always need to pretend to have all the answers just to achieve maximum bluster. Sometimes he can pose a question.\n\nSo here’s a sincere one: Should we love or loathe John Wayne?\n\nThis comes to mind as Winterset once again pays tribute to its famous native son. Wayne was born here as Marion Robert Morrison on May 26, 1907, in a humble four-room cottage. He went on to become “the Duke,\" arguably the 20th century’s top movie icon. The annual John Wayne Birthday Celebration May 27-28 features everything from a barn dance to a free screening Saturday night of \"The Searchers\" on the town square.\n\nThe spiffy new 6,100-square-foot museum that opened here last year makes it plain what Wayne represented, particularly in his Westerns: He was the ultimate macho patriot cowboy who doled out brash frontier justice with a rifle in hand and swagger to spare.\n\n“I don’t believe I ever killed a man that didn’t deserve it,” you can hear Wayne drawl in a clip from his 1976 film “The Shootist” as part of a tribute montage that plays in a continuous loop in the museum’s 24-seat theater.\n\nBut last month Wayne himself got zapped by California, the state that he called home for the vast majority of his life. (Little Marion and his family left Iowa for the West Coast in 1914.)\n\nA legislative resolution to establish a statewide “John Wayne Day” May 26 drew 35 votes — six votes short of the majority needed to pass in the 80-member Assembly.\n\nThe resolution touted Wayne as \"the prototypical American hero, symbolizing such traits as self-reliance, grace under pressure, resolve, and patriotism.\"\n\nBut the poison pill for some lawmakers turned out to be a Wayne interview published by Playboy that endures online with the unsubtle headline, “This is what John Wayne told Playboy about blacks and American Indians in 1971.”\n\n“I believe in white supremacy,\" Wayne said, \"until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility.\"\n\nThat’s reprehensible and racist. He didn't fare any better when it came to Native Americans:\n\n\"Our so-called stealing of this country from them was just a matter of survival,\" Wayne said. \"There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves.\"\n\nI suppose that in a sense Wayne was just staying consistent with the imperialist, genocidal tone of many of the cowboys-and-Indians films on which he built his fame.\n\nRacial legacies of our national heroes\n\nI should clarify that the last thing I want to do here is to give Brian Downes fits.\n\nDownes, executive director of the John Wayne Birthplace Museum, is a good guy. Wayne has been a lifelong fascination for this Chicago native. He interviewed the Duke in 1977 at the actor's home. When he worked at the Chicago Tribune he also befriended late writer Mike Royko, so Downes understands that a columnist often tends to ask impolite questions at inopportune moments.\n\nDownes humored me and observed that it would be foolish to try to deny or whitewash (so to speak) those notorious Wayne quotes.\n\nBut what Wayne said in that Playboy interview, he added, also “wasn’t the totality of his being.\"\n\n“The world was changing fast when he made those remarks,” Downes said.\n\nIn other words, context matters when we're judging the deeply flawed past from our (slightly) more enlightened present. Just the fact that we're talking about a Playboy interview shows some of the cultural shift.\n\nThis is a familiar debate on so many fronts. We've spent part of the year arguing over whom to honor on our currency. Harriet Tubman is replacing Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill. And both Jackson and fellow president and slave owner Thomas Jefferson in a switch this fall will not be namesakes for the Iowa Democratic Party’s annual fall fund-raising dinner.\n\nI applaud those moves. When you're actively printing money or organizing new dinners, why not give overdue recognition or re-brand according to your values? Similarly, the Confederate Flag can't be confined to museums fast enough for my taste. But I recognize that free speech means I'll still be staring at it on the backs of pickup trucks for the rest of my life.\n\nPoliticizing the Duke\n\nWayne as a political being is mostly absent from Winterset's museum. It's more about revolvers, saddles, the see-through eye patch from \"True Grit\" and the original sidecar from \"The Quiet Man.\"\n\nThere are tiny indications in framed letters that hang on the wall. Fellow actor Kirk Douglas in 1981 wrote, “John and I did not see eye to eye on many things.\" The two stars — Wayne a Republican and Douglas a Democrat — were on opposite sides of the Cold War paranoia that swept through Hollywood and saw suspected communist sympathizers blacklisted. Wayne years later in a 1974 BBC interview still called the witch hunt \"a very necessary thing at the time.\"\n\nBut then others also continue to politicize the Duke 37 years after his death. His own daughter, Aissa, stood inside this museum in January alongside Donald Trump and declared that her dad would have endorsed the billionaire for president.\n\nIf you were going to pick a candidate for whom brash frontier justice dovetails with his or her brand, wouldn't it be Trump? This entire election cycle has felt like a Wild West shoot 'em up.\n\nWhere do you stand?\n\nSo do we love or loathe the Duke?\n\nI don't see the question as a cultural divide between Californian political correctness and Iowan practicality. Wayne is still being honored in both states.\n\nThe city council in Newport Beach, California, where the actor lived, voted unanimously to establish its own John Wayne Day after the state's refusal.\n\nIowa, meanwhile, is doubling down: Brooklyn, one of the five Iowa towns where Wayne and his family lived before they migrated west, unveils its own new historical marker Saturday complete with a steel sculpture.\n\nOn one hand, I like to point out that another icon who looms as large as Wayne, singer Frank Sinatra, was more racially enlightened and publicly progressive decades before the Duke gave that Playboy interview.\n\nBut then Ol’ Blue Eyes was hardly a choir boy. Trying to turn our favorite artists or historical figures into ideal role models only tends to set us up for disappointment.\n\nOr as Downes puts it, “There’s nobody can stand that scrutiny.”\n\nBut by 1971, Wayne should have known better.\n\nWhat we end up with is a love-hate relationship with some of our icons, whether Jefferson or Wayne.\n\nAt this point I don't think we should shut down Turner Classic Movies or erase all Westerns from Hollywood's back catalog. But by the same token state legislatures probably don't need to waste time posthumously honoring figures such as Wayne.\n\nA museum and events dedicated to Wayne in his hometown or the other places he lived does feel true to our history. We don't learn anything by ignoring what we were. It all depends on how we process the Duke: Do we put him on a patriotic pedestal or do the hard work of figuring out what his flaws say about modern America?\n\nSo it's up to each individual moviegoer who sits in Winterset's town square Saturday night and watches \"The Searchers.\" The 60-year-old film might be the best possible case study: It's the most acclaimed Western of all time that simultaneously reflects the worst racist Western stereotypes but also seems to call them into question.\n\nThe first Wayne quote that greets you in the museum gallery is at the base of a bust of the Duke: “Tomorrow is the most important thing in life, comes to us at midnight very clean. It’s perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we’ve learned something from yesterday.”\n\nIt's just that in the Duke's hometown and everywhere else we keep arguing over what yesterday really taught us."
