And, as testament to the star's enduring popularity, they keep on coming.\n\nTo provide a more meaningful visitor experience, the Birthplace organization has announced the May 23 grand opening of the John Wayne Birthplace Museum, a new 5,000-square foot facility that will offer an astounding collection of artifacts from the screen legend's life and motion picture career.\n\nThe only museum in the world dedicated to John Wayne, it will feature the largest diversified exhibit of John Wayne artifacts in existence, including original movie posters, film wardrobe, scripts, contracts, letters, artwork and sculpture, one of his custom-built automobiles and, of course, a movie theater.\n\nMovies that Wayne made in the Northwest were \"Rooster Cogburn,'' (with a co-star performance by Katherine Hepburn), filmed in 1975 in Oregon's Deschutes County, and \"McQ,\" a 1974 Dirty Harry knockoff filmed in Seattle and around Washington.\n\nWashington has at least two places named for John Wayne: the John Wayne Marina near Sequim (he donated the land) and the 100-plus-mile \"John Wayne Pioneer Trail\" in Iron Horse State Park.\n\nA birthday celebration of this magnitude requires considerable flourish and the weekend of May 23-25 (Memorial Day weekend) will not disappoint, according to the announcement of the opening.\n\nProviding patriotic fanfare for the opening ceremonies will be the 100-member Iowa Military Veterans Band, in addition to rodeo queens, reduced price admission to the new museum, free John Wayne movies at the vintage Iowa Theater, food and merchandise vendors, cowboy mounted shooters and much more.\n\nA highlight for many will be the Museum Benefit Dinner ($150 per person) headlined by country music legend and RFD-TV star Marty Stuart & His Fabulous Superlatives. Also featured will be an auction of unique and one-of-a-kind John Wayne collectibles including artwork and film wardrobe.\n\nWinterset is 30 miles southwest of Des Moines, the state capital.\n\nFor further information call 877-462-1044 or visit the John Wayne Birthplace and Museum website at johnwaynebirthplace.museum/birthday.\n\nHere's a related link about a place in central Oregon that was used during the filming of \"Rooster Cogburn.\""
