        "text": "I was there twice. First time it was closed. Second time it was open and more interesting. It is a small house for sure. the covered bridges are very interesting. I saw most of them. I thought it was worth while.\n\nRon I live here. If you like John Wayne, I'd visit the museum and the house he was born in. They added on to the museum last year. Are you s veteran, we are given a discount on certain days of the month. As far as restaurants, yes we are down a few. Hardies, a McDonalds is being built now, and a couple on the north side of the square. Our Covered Bridge Festival will be the second full weekend of October this year. The car show usually has over 100 cars and trucks. 5 or 6 gas stations, two grocery stores, a bakery that is closed on Sunday and Monday. The local HyVee store has a decent restaurant.\n\nWhen we visited our son in Adel a few years ago, he took us through Winterset, but the museum was closed. He showed us an aircraft museum not far from that area that was open, and we toured that. It was on a county road, if I remember correctly.\n\nButch\n\nshaun, not sure what you were looking for but there is a pizza hut, a pizza ranch, a nice little mexican restaurant on the square, a chinese rastaurant on the square a bar and grill restaurant near the intersection 169&92. Its a blue collar town full of working folks, fancy dining, is not going to make it there. gobble"
