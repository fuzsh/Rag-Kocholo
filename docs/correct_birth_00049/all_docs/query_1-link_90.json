lot of John Wayne topics,\n\nJenn:\n\nUm, and I don't think they\n\nScott:\n\nhistory period, so we're coming for you History Channel.\n\nScott:\n\nI haven't said that in a while.\n\nScott:\n\nBut History Channel, you better watch out, because\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's\n\nScott:\n\nthis stuff, that you and\n\nJenn:\n\ncommon for you, Jen's Gaines of history.\n\nScott:\n\nToday, we are embarking on a journey to explore the life and legacy\n\nScott:\n\nof one of America's most iconic figures, the legendary John We're taking you on\n\nScott:\n\nan adventure to Winterset, Iowa, where we visited the very house where Marian\n\nScott:\n\nMorrison, the man who would later become John Wayne, entered this It's more than\n\nScott:\n\njust a house, it's a window into the early years of a Hollywood We're going\n\nScott:\n\nto unravel the story of John Wayne's life from his humble beginnings in Winterset\n\nScott:\n\nto his transformation into the Duke and the enduring legacy he left on the\n\nScott:\n\nsilver We'll delve deep into the roots of this cinematic legend and explore\n\nScott:\n\nhis later family life and how his own kids ventured into So whether you're\n\nScott:\n\na fan of Westerns, a history buff, or just someone curious about the life\n\nScott:\n\nof a true American icon, this episode promises to be a journey through time\n\nScott:\n\nand cinema you won't want to miss.\n\nScott:\n\nWithout further ado, let's step back in time and experience the life and\n\nScott:\n\ntimes of John Wayne as we visit his birthplace home in Winterset, Iowa.\n\nScott:\n\nSo Jen, this was, again, at the tail end of our western road trip, and this was\n\nScott:\n\na, a huge kind of thing for you to do.\n\nScott:\n\nThis was, this is the one thing we did in Iowa as we were driving.\n\nScott:\n\nSo let's talk a little bit about Winterset and then the birthplace of this cinematic\n\nJenn:\n\nYeah, so you know, pretty much the start of Walk With History, I did a\n\nJenn:\n\nlot of John Wayne research and this was always a bucket list place for me to go\n\nJenn:\n\nbecause I grew up on John Wayne movies.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo I always wanted to see the John Wayne Museum and the John Wayne House.\n\nScott:\n\nThis was always wanted to see the John Wayne Museum\n\nScott:\n\nand the John Wayne House.\n\nScott:\n\nJohn Wayne Americana and, and history Americana.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd that was literally one of the things that inspired you\n\nScott:\n\nto, to, to start the channel.\n\nJenn:\n\nYes,\n\nJenn:\n\nbecause people were showing some things on YouTube, but they\n\nJenn:\n\nweren't really connecting it.\n\nJenn:\n\nLike, why does this matter?\n\nJenn:\n\nOr why, how does this impact us today?\n\nJenn:\n\nHow does John Wayne impact us today?\n\nJenn:\n\nWhat is he left?\n\nJenn:\n\nWhat is his legacy?\n\nJenn:\n\nWhat is his Americana legacy?\n\nJenn:\n\nWhat did we, you know?\n\nJenn:\n\nWe think a lot about the West because of John Wayne, he is the, the Western\n\nJenn:\n\nactor of the time, like I said, highest grossing film actor for three decades.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe presents us with the window into a lot of these different stories.\n\nJenn:\n\nand brings them to life for us.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd you just think of John Wayne.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe is a movie star.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd you think of him with the swagger, with the star, with the\n\nJenn:\n\ngun, you know, in, in a shootout.\n\nJenn:\n\nLike this is, you picture John Wayne as this man who is part of building America.\n\nJenn:\n\nNow he didn't build it per se as the Westerners really did, but\n\nJenn:\n\nhe's going to personify it and show it on the silver screen.\n\nScott:\n\nI just thought that was so neat that you, you called that out that\n\nScott:\n\nwe were standing in the birthplace of the person inspired us to, to be\n\nScott:\n\nthere and to be filming to begin with.\n\nScott:\n\nSo I, I just thought that was really neat.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd we talked briefly about last week's episode, was more about his movie career.\n\nScott:\n\nWe're going to focus more on family life about kind of where set being off\n\nScott:\n\nkind of in the middle of Iowa off the beaten path a little bit easy to find.\n\nScott:\n\nThe, the movie museum is great, and if you guys are curious about\n\nScott:\n\nthat, I'd encourage you to listen to the episode just before this.\n\nScott:\n\nWe talk about kind of more his movie career and the museum itself, but we're\n\nScott:\n\ngoing to focus more on his personal\n\nJenn:\n\nSure.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo the house is kind of connected with the museum.\n\nJenn:\n\nIf you want to visit the museum.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd then go to the house, it's right next door.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd his house is at 220 South 2nd Street in Winterset, Iowa.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he was born there May 26th, 1907.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd it really hasn't changed a lot since then.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's a four bedroom house, or four bedroom, four room house.\n\nJenn:\n\nOne bedroom, one bedroom, one kitchen, one dining room, one living room.\n\nJenn:\n\nThat's it.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd so in the local newspaper reported four days after his birth\n\nJenn:\n\nthat he weighed 13 pounds at birth.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd so when we're in that house and I show you the room where he was born,\n\nJenn:\n\nI just comment on a 13 pound baby.\n\nJenn:\n\nI just can't even imagine amount of emotions that might have been\n\nJenn:\n\ncoming out of that room at the time.\n\nScott:\n\nwere there's a lot of screaming going on in this\n\nScott:\n\nroom and it's cool because they actually had the newspaper from\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd So\n\nScott:\n\nYou know that one of the things that I noticed in the announcement\n\nScott:\n\nof was just below that was an article about how popular for whatever, for\n\nScott:\n\nYeah, it was, it was probably coming back around, but it was just neat\n\nScott:\n\nto see some of the other things.\n\nScott:\n\nSure.\n\nScott:\n\nIn the newspaper right there.\n\nScott:\n\nSo again, the, the video that we're, that we made already that's the, show notes.\n\nScott:\n\nSo if you guys wanna watch that, you can, but it was kind of neat\n\nScott:\n\nto see what else was going on.\n\nScott:\n\nIt's 1907,\n\nJenn:\n\n1907.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo Marian, it's so funny, his name is, is Feminine.\n\nJenn:\n\nWhen you really think about it.\n\nJenn:\n\nMarian Robert Morrison and he, his middle name will be changed to Michael\n\nJenn:\n\nbecause they have a second boy in 1911 and they name him Michael.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo are they, I mean, they name him Robert.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo they change his middle name to Michael.\n\nJenn:\n\nNow, there's no legal papers ever found to show that they did this.\n\nJenn:\n\nI think they just kind of like, as a family, did it.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt was like they had a second boy and they really liked the name\n\nJenn:\n\nRobert, but they had given it to him.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo they're like, well, we're going to kind of take it back and give you Michael\n\nJenn:\n\nand we're going to call him Robert.\n\nScott:\n\nhow interesting.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd, and that's funny because one of the things that I, I thought I actually\n\nScott:\n\ncould have done a little bit better in we actually show a lot of childhood pictures.\n\nScott:\n\nMm-Hmm.\n\nScott:\n\nkind of on the walls and they're, they're, those are hard to find in Google.\n\nScott:\n\nLike a lot of those don't, don't pop up all the time.\n\nScott:\n\nSo it was neat to kind of see them on, on, on the wall, but I,\n\nScott:\n\nI, I wish I would've pointed out.\n\nScott:\n\nIt'd been more clear about who John Wayne was because he was the older\n\nJenn:\n\nolder brother.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's obvious.\n\nScott:\n\nit's obvious if you're looking at the pictures, but I would have liked to\n\nScott:\n\nhave called those out more because his younger brother was always there with\n\nJenn:\n\nYeah, his, he's four years older and his brother will pass\n\nJenn:\n\naway nine years before him.\n\nJenn:\n\nHis brother did serve in the U.\n\nJenn:\n\nS.\n\nJenn:\n\nNavy.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo they have a dog named Duke and that is where that nickname\n\nJenn:\n\ncomes from for John Wayne.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd so that.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd we'll get more into this like his some of his wives would call him Duke\n\nJenn:\n\nbecause that is the more Familiar name because John Wayne is a stage\n\nJenn:\n\nname and even his children have the last name Morrison children don't\n\nJenn:\n\nhave the last name Wayne now they if they are in the movies like Patrick\n\nJenn:\n\nWayne That is again their stage name.\n\nJenn:\n\nYes, but their legal names are Morrison.\n\nScott:\n\nYeah, and I had read about how he kind of got the nickname as,\n\nScott:\n\nas Duke because, you his dog, right.\n\nScott:\n\nBut his dog would follow him everywhere.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd so they always kind of just became synonymous.\n\nScott:\n\nI look, there's the Duke,\n\nJenn:\n\nYeah, Little Duke.\n\nJenn:\n\nYep.\n\nJenn:\n\nMm hmm.\n\nScott:\n\nand so I just thought that was neat.\n\nScott:\n\nI mean, it's very Indiana Jones ask, right.\n\nScott:\n\nBecause Indiana Jones is his nickname is like, because the dog's name\n\nJenn:\n\nIs Indiana.\n\nJenn:\n\nMm hmm.\n\nScott:\n\nthought that that was\n\nJenn:\n\nSo, Wayne's father, Clyde, was the son of American Civil War veteran Marion\n\nJenn:\n\nMitchell Morrison, which is why I like to always Say that because my maiden\n\nJenn:\n\nname was Mitchell and then his mother Mary Molly Brown was from Nebraska but\n\nJenn:\n\nthere is a lot of Scottish ancestry there and Irish ancestry there and they come\n\nJenn:\n\nfrom the different isles there where their family has located from but he\n\nJenn:\n\nwas raised Presbyterian and What I see a lot of is his father's a pharmacist and\n\nJenn:\n\nthey move for his job And so they're in they don't initially they're not from\n\nJenn:\n\nWinterset, Iowa They're there because the pharmacy is there and that's where\n\nJenn:\n\nthe two boys are born and it's shortly after Roberts born that they will move\n\nJenn:\n\nto California again for the pharmacy job.\n\nScott:\n\nYeah, so he lived in Winterset for what?\n\nJenn:\n\nYeah, like seven years And then they will move to California and\n\nJenn:\n\nthey'll settle in Glendale in 1916?\n\nScott:\n\nso that's, I mean, that's my neck of the\n\nJenn:\n\nYes.\n\nJenn:\n\nThat was Mm-Hmm.\n\nScott:\n\ngrew up in that kind of greater\n\nJenn:\n\nMm-Hmm.\n\nJenn:\n\n.And again, his father will work as a pharmacist and he's gonna go to Glendale\n\nJenn:\n\nHigh School and he's gonna do sports and academics, and he doesn't quite have\n\nJenn:\n\nthe grades to go to the Naval Academy.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe applies.\n\nJenn:\n\nYes, but he's not accepted because of poor grades, so he goes to USC instead.\n\nScott:\n\nThat's right, Trojans.\n\nScott:\n\nIt's\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's so funny.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo while he's at USC, he's six foot four and a half and he plays on the\n\nJenn:\n\nfootball team, but he's injured and it's that injury, it's a collarbone injury.\n\nScott:\n\nThey say what\n\nJenn:\n\nI\n\nJenn:\n\ndon't know, but I'm sure someone would\n\nScott:\n\nsomeone will know.\n\nScott:\n\nBut he\n\nJenn:\n\nBut he didn't injure himself playing football.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe injured himself body\n\nScott:\n\nsurfing\n\nJenn:\n\nbut he never wanted to tell his football coach that.\n\nScott:\n\nacademic\n\nJenn:\n\nBut he loses his academic scholarship, but when he loses\n\nJenn:\n\nhis scholarship, he has to leave the university and that's when he\n\nJenn:\n\nstarts working for the movies and starts doing the prop stuff and the\n\nJenn:\n\ncarpentry stuff and moving stuff and catches the eye of John Ford.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo we talked about his movie career.\n\nJenn:\n\nLast time this is more about his family.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo I want to stress in 1933 He gets married for the\n\nJenn:\n\nfirst time at 33 years old.\n\nScott:\n\nYeah, and before we go on to the,\n\nJenn:\n\nI mean, he's 26\n\nScott:\n\nand before we go on to the end of the marriage thing too, you know, Just\n\nScott:\n\nso, so people know when you, especially in that the greater, Hollywood, Los Angeles\n\nScott:\n\narea, it's very common for look for work.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd because Hollywood is such a big industry out there,\n\nScott:\n\nthere's work to be had, right?\n\nScott:\n\nAnd USC is right there too far from the Hollywood area and the studios,\n\nScott:\n\nyou know, Glendale, you know, and so it's not surprising that if he's\n\nScott:\n\nlooking for work, Did that kind of.\n\nScott:\n\nSure.\n\nJenn:\n\nSure, I mean, even if you go to the LA area today, people\n\nJenn:\n\nalways ask, are you in the industry?\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd you're like, what?\n\nScott:\n\nA.\n\nScott:\n\narea today, people always ask, are you in the industry?\n\nScott:\n\nWell, you live in the area,\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd Hollywood industry, especially at the time in the 1920s, 1930s,\n\nJenn:\n\nit's a big, like you said, industry of California before California\n\nJenn:\n\nbecomes more tech, what it is today.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt is just an agricultural and Hollywood industry at the time.\n\nJenn:\n\nI mean, Disneyland was the Orange Grove.\n\nScott:\n\nYeah, and that's why I wanted to kind of call that out again,\n\nScott:\n\nyou would think like, oh, maybe he was pursuing You know, being\n\nScott:\n\nan actor and acting and trying.\n\nScott:\n\nThat was his way in.\n\nScott:\n\nHe probably wasn't.\n\nScott:\n\nHe probably initially was just looking for work.\n\nScott:\n\nBecause that is, that's actually more common than people realize.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd, and I'm more familiar with that.\n\nScott:\n\nAgain, having grown up in that area and known people that work, different parts\n\nScott:\n\nof that industry and actually having know, again, for, for those, if this is\n\nScott:\n\nyour first time listening to the show, my great grandfather was a prop you know, so\n\nScott:\n\nhe built some big sets and was in charge of building sets for some very, very big\n\nJenn:\n\nRear window\n\nScott:\n\nwindow,\n\nJenn:\n\n10 commandments\n\nScott:\n\n10 commandments with Charlton\n\nJenn:\n\ngreatest show on\n\nScott:\n\nYeah.\n\nScott:\n\nSo, so it was, it's very common out in that area just to kind of set the\n\nScott:\n\nstage, give context to people who might not be from, you know, the West\n\nJenn:\n\nsure.\n\nJenn:\n\nso his first wife Josephine is the daughter of a Diplomat,\n\nJenn:\n\nbut she is of Spanish descent.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo he's, he's a diplomat from Spain and he meets her and they get married in 1933.\n\nJenn:\n\nThey have four children\n\nScott:\n\nOh, wow.\n\nJenn:\n\nand these are the four Michael Wayne Mary, Tony Wayne,\n\nJenn:\n\nPatrick Wayne, Melinda Wayne.\n\nJenn:\n\nWhen you see\n\nJenn:\n\nQuiet,\n\nJenn:\n\nMan and you see the four kids sitting in the wagon, those are his children.\n\nScott:\n\nOh, I didn't know\n\nJenn:\n\nThose are his four kids.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo Patrick Wayne will go on to have a pretty big movie\n\nScott:\n\nYeah, I mean, and you've seen him in\n\nJenn:\n\nOh, McClintock.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe's been in a lot of movies with him.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe'll be in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe's in McClintock.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe's in Big Jake.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo he has a pretty big career.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo he will have four children from his first marriage.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe subsequently will get divorced and marry Esperanza.\n\nJenn:\n\nShe's from Latin America.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe probably wasn't likely had an affair with her.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe marries her really on the eve of his divorce from his first wife.\n\nJenn:\n\nNow they never have children.\n\nJenn:\n\nThey're only married for, I think like four years.\n\nJenn:\n\nYeah, it was very steamy, very volatile No, they're actually\n\nJenn:\n\nmarried for eight years.\n\nJenn:\n\nShe accuses him of a lot of affairs, some are true, some are not.\n\nJenn:\n\nShe's greeted him at the door a couple times with a loaded gun.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo, you can just imagine.\n\nJenn:\n\nYeah, I think he likes this kind of, yeah, the flair.\n\nScott:\n\nlot of Yeah, I\n\nJenn:\n\nYeah.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo his third wife, again, married on the eve of divorce,\n\nJenn:\n\nPilar, will be his last wife.\n\nJenn:\n\nThey will never divorce, although they will separate.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he has three children with her.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo you hear Ayesa Wayne, who's still alive today, John Ethan Wayne, who is named\n\nJenn:\n\nafter his character from The Searchers.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he's also in the movie Big Jake, plays his grandson, even though he's the son.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd then Marissa Wayne.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo Ayesa Wayne and Marissa Wayne.\n\nJenn:\n\nVery.\n\nJenn:\n\nSimilar sounding names, but they're all alive today.\n\nJenn:\n\nOnly Patrick Wayne is alive of the first four.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd then his three younger ones are still alive\n\nScott:\n\nI don't think that was, that was something I've never really thought\n\nScott:\n\ntoo much about John Wayne's personal\n\nJenn:\n\nMm hmm.\n\nScott:\n\nother than I knew he had some\n\nJenn:\n\nSure.\n\nScott:\n\nknow, Patrick but it's one of those things it's interesting when you learn\n\nScott:\n\na little bit more about these historical you know, whether they're in the actors\n\nScott:\n\nor kind of, ex presidents or whoever it is, and you learn about like Wait, what\n\nScott:\n\ndo you mean first Oh, there was two.\n\nScott:\n\nNo, no, no, there was three.\n\nScott:\n\nIt gives you a little bit more kind of more of the picture about the person\n\nScott:\n\nthan necessarily the legend that is whoever you're talking about, right?\n\nScott:\n\nAnd in this case, it's John Wayne.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd, and, you know, not, I'm not trying to bring him down at all, it's just\n\nScott:\n\ninteresting, you know, as you learn more about these people who really most\n\nScott:\n\npeople know and they're, they're very kind of have an emotional attachment to\n\nScott:\n\nJohn Wayne and his movies and because of what he represented and what those\n\nScott:\n\nmovies often and the themes often represented, it's always interesting\n\nScott:\n\nto learn a little bit more about the person that's behind the curtain.\n\nJenn:\n\nWell, I would say John Wayne is, for lack of better\n\nJenn:\n\nwords, a typical movie star.\n\nJenn:\n\nOf the time.\n\nJenn:\n\nBecause these men of the time, if you think of Clark Gable, if you're thinking\n\nJenn:\n\nof, Jimmy Stewart is an anomaly.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe will stay married to his one and only wife for his whole life.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut there are some who they do have affairs.\n\nJenn:\n\nThey do have different women and it is kind of more acceptable and almost\n\nJenn:\n\nlike encouraged of leading men because it makes this this draw about them.\n\nScott:\n\nof the time, too.\n\nScott:\n\nI, you know, I don't know if it would be encouraged, but it's not as easily\n\nScott:\n\ncompared to things like know, it's, you know, if, if somebody suspected\n\nScott:\n\nsomething, well, it's hard to, harder to catch someone in the act.\n\nScott:\n\nThere's no, not everybody has their cell phone in their pocket a camera, right?\n\nScott:\n\nAnd then to actually publish something and, you know, Hollywood industry\n\nScott:\n\nat the time had a lot of power.\n\nScott:\n\nSo, that's interesting to kind of, again,\n\nJenn:\n\nBut he's a big family man.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd they even talk about that in the museum.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo big car to get the seven children in.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe has a Ship or boat called I would say a small ship called the wild\n\nJenn:\n\ngoose that he ports in Long Beach.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he likes to take it out to Catalina and big family guy\n\nJenn:\n\nlikes to have his kids with him.\n\nJenn:\n\nThere's lots of pictures of him selling, debating Christmases\n\nJenn:\n\nwith all seven children or Easter's with all seven children.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe built the John Wayne tennis club in Newport beach in 1973.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe just was very big into having.\n\nJenn:\n\nThese places to be with his family.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt is now the Palisades Tennis Club.\n\nScott:\n\nClub.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo, he's just, he is this guy who really does love his family around him.\n\nJenn:\n\nNow, even though him and Pilar are going to separate in 1973, and he\n\nJenn:\n\nlives to 1979, they will never divorce.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd she is very adamant to let people know they never divorced.\n\nJenn:\n\nNow, he will go on to have a relationship with his personal assistant.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd she writes a book, I think called John Wayne and Me, and\n\nJenn:\n\nI actually read that book.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd if you, and then they became boyfriend, girlfriend, and she,\n\nJenn:\n\nshe took care of him basically towards the end of his life.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd if you ever hear what John Wayne's last words were.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's, of course I know who you are.\n\nJenn:\n\nYou're my girl.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he was, he said it to her.\n\nScott:\n\nSo\n\nJenn:\n\nSo he was like, she had come in to check on him in the, in the hospital room.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd she said, do you know who I am?\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he goes, of course I know who you are.\n\nJenn:\n\nYou're my girl.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo that's his last words were to\n\nScott:\n\nwords were to her.\n\nScott:\n\nWere to her.\n\nScott:\n\nYeah, and that's actually, it's funny because I actually made a\n\nScott:\n\nshort about that amount of traffic.\n\nScott:\n\nI don't think I realized\n\nJenn:\n\nYeah, it was his former secretary, Pat Stacey, and she published a\n\nJenn:\n\nbook called Duke, A Love Story.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd I read that book.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's, it's fine.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's good, you know, but it just gives you the background into the end of his life.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe also, his hair began to thin in the 1940s.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he would wear a hairpiece.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo\n\nJenn:\n\nyou can see this a lot like Frank Sinatra wore a hairpiece.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd different people of the time, again, I think Gene Kelly wore a hairpiece.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd so, there would be pictures of him without his hairpiece on, like,\n\nJenn:\n\nI think he went to Gary Cooper's funeral without the hairpiece so\n\nJenn:\n\nyou could see his thinning hair.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd then when he was at Harvard, he had gone there, they do the those awards,\n\nJenn:\n\nwhat are they called, the Lampoon Awards, where they kind of, the Razzies.\n\nJenn:\n\naNd they were making fun of him for some role and John Wayne took\n\nJenn:\n\npride in accepting the award.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe showed up in a tank and it was really great.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe really like embodied you know, being a part of this persona.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd they asked him about.\n\nJenn:\n\nThe hair is a true your toupee is real hair and he responded.\n\nJenn:\n\nWell, sir.\n\nJenn:\n\nThat's real hair.\n\nJenn:\n\nNot mine, but real hair.\n\nScott:\n\nOh, so he, so he wasn't afraid to\n\nJenn:\n\nNo, no, he actually and they say a lot that Duke's personality and sense of\n\nJenn:\n\nhumor is very close to what people would see in the big screen when he was joking\n\nJenn:\n\nis really that's kind of who he was.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo, yeah, towards the end of his life, he will get cancer\n\nJenn:\n\nand he's the one who they think.\n\nJenn:\n\ncoined the term the big C.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo that's what he would call it.\n\nJenn:\n\nThe big C.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe had lung cancer, and then he had one of his lungs removed and\n\nJenn:\n\ntwo ribs removed right before he shot The Sons of Katie Elder.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd we talked about this.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe wanted to do his own stunts in The Sons of Katie Elder.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd if you watch that movie, he's kind of dragged through like a river.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he ends up getting, not a river, like a stream, and\n\nJenn:\n\nhe ends up getting pneumonia.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd with the one lung, he was very close to being close to death there,\n\nJenn:\n\nbut he was so adamant that he could still do all these stunts that he really\n\nJenn:\n\nput his life in jeopardy during that.\n\nJenn:\n\nThen towards the end of his life in 1979, the cancer had come back and\n\nJenn:\n\nhe had volunteered to do a study, a volunteer study, and he had checked\n\nJenn:\n\nhimself into the hospital there in L.\n\nJenn:\n\nA.\n\nJenn:\n\nfor the study.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he ends up passing away there.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd his, he actually passes away in June of 1979, actually June 11th,\n\nJenn:\n\n1979, our daughter's birthday.\n\nScott:\n\nYeah.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd but he will appear at the Oscars that year.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo that's his last public appearance.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo in earlier in the year, you, that's the last time you will see John Wayne.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he's a lot different.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe's a lot thinner.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd for a six foot four and a half man, who was always pretty.\n\nJenn:\n\nBig and to see him then it was just a, a, a change but he, you know,\n\nJenn:\n\nhe ends up, you know, leaving the wild goose, docked in Newport beach.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's listed on the U S registry of historic places.\n\nJenn:\n\nThere's a lot of pictures of him with that boat or ship.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe really did enjoy\n\nScott:\n\nthere was, there was a lot in the, movie part of things.\n\nScott:\n\nThey, they show a lot of, a lot of pictures of him on, on the boat.\n\nScott:\n\nThat's kind of how I always pictured him as well as as someone, not\n\nScott:\n\nonly, you know, the movie star, but when not making out there making\n\nScott:\n\nmovies, like you said, a family man who's out there doing stuff, right?\n\nScott:\n\nHe's out there fishing.\n\nScott:\n\nHe's out there.\n\nScott:\n\nYou know, hunting doing all those kinds of things.\n\nScott:\n\nI mean, I, that's why I kind of find it amusing that he hurt his\n\nScott:\n\nknee while he was in college body\n\nJenn:\n\nin college\n\nScott:\n\nRight?\n\nScott:\n\nBecause here's a, here's a guy just like anything at the time, like, you\n\nScott:\n\nknow, in the, in that era, you're not sitting around watching TV all the time.\n\nScott:\n\nYou're, you're out there doing stuff and that's kind of, that's who he was\n\nScott:\n\nand, and he really did embody that.\n\nJenn:\n\nThere's been some controversy around John Wayne.\n\nJenn:\n\nThe Playboy interview is probably the biggest one where he was interviewed\n\nJenn:\n\nfor Playboy 1971 and he was talking in support of Vietnam and he made it very\n\nJenn:\n\nclear that he was in support of Vietnam.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe also talked about he believed in white supremacy.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he says, I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated\n\nJenn:\n\nto the point of responsibility.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd so he felt, and I don't know exactly how he felt, but what he says\n\nJenn:\n\nhere and how I interpret it is that it's a white person's responsibility\n\nJenn:\n\nto educate and bring up the, the people who have been oppressed.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he.\n\nJenn:\n\nalmost feels like he believes until, until people can be to the point of\n\nJenn:\n\nbeing educated and to hand it over That the white supremacy is more like white\n\nJenn:\n\nResponsibility is what I read from this and I'm not trying to make excuses for\n\nJenn:\n\nhim, but that's how I'm reading his\n\nJenn:\n\nwords\n\nScott:\n\nof the things, right, as we kind of joked about in the beginning,\n\nScott:\n\nI'm not the history guy, but I've married into the history world.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd one of the things that I've seen, you know, from some of these historic\n\nScott:\n\nknow, like John, like the John Waynes and, and like some others, you know,\n\nScott:\n\nthat, that are much more controversial.\n\nScott:\n\nA lot of times, Again, I'll say the way that I interpret it from what I\n\nScott:\n\nsee and what they say or what they're trying to is they don't necessarily have\n\nScott:\n\nthe vocabulary that we have developed, however many years later today.\n\nScott:\n\nI'd say, you know, society today is a lot better educated when it comes\n\nScott:\n\nto talking about race and talking about, you know, past enslavement and\n\nScott:\n\nkind of, know, those things evolve.\n\nScott:\n\nI mean, we even joke about Who is it that you visited when you were\n\nScott:\n\nout in Mississippi, Emmett Till?\n\nJenn:\n\nTill, oh my, Miss Heron?\n\nJenn:\n\nMiss Heron.\n\nJenn:\n\nMm hmm.\n\nScott:\n\nright?\n\nScott:\n\nAnd so, people use the language that they grew up and were taught\n\nScott:\n\nand You kind of really have to take the see what they right?\n\nScott:\n\nAnd again, unless they say, unless they write down somewhere or they\n\nScott:\n\nsay how they feel, you kind of have to interpret a little bit.\n\nScott:\n\nBut again, a lot of times they just don't have the language.\n\nScott:\n\nThat we would have, right?\n\nScott:\n\nTake John Wayne and transport him 50 years into the future to today.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd he may have said that in a much more, by today's today's through, in a\n\nScott:\n\nmuch more socially acceptable manner.\n\nScott:\n\nRight?\n\nScott:\n\nAgain, you and I are very much interpreting here.\n\nScott:\n\nBut you have to remember that.\n\nJenn:\n\nYou\n\nJenn:\n\nhave to remember that.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd so I always look for people said this and what did they do, right?\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd so John Wayne on the set of The Searchers, if you think of the American\n\nJenn:\n\nIndian woman on The Searchers who plays the bride of the boy, right?\n\nJenn:\n\nShe was, John Wayne found her crying on set and he was like,\n\nJenn:\n\nwhat are you upset about?\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd she goes, I'm going to miss my son's graduation from high school.\n\nJenn:\n\nJohn Wayne shut down the set and flew her back to LA so she\n\nJenn:\n\ncould attend his graduation.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo he, I don't think And again, I, I think, like you said, people don't have\n\nJenn:\n\nthe words in the 1970s, even today people are still looking for the right way to\n\nJenn:\n\nexpress themselves with clear words, because really finding the right word\n\nJenn:\n\nfor a feeling is a difficult thing to do.\n\nJenn:\n\nI think with John Wayne, I think his heart is in the right place for me\n\nJenn:\n\nwhen I base it on his actions than what he's trying to say or interpret\n\nJenn:\n\nor in one interview, one time.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd this is what Patrick Wayne kind of gets into after this after this\n\nJenn:\n\ninterview resurfaces again, and in 2019 people want to change the John\n\nJenn:\n\nWayne airport and his son defends him saying it would be an injustice to\n\nJenn:\n\njudge someone based on an interview that's being taken out of context.\n\nScott:\n\nand, and that's what you and I really try hard to do is paint the\n\nScott:\n\npicture and give you the context, you the listener that's listening to\n\nScott:\n\nthis We try to give you the context and we try to frame it in such a way.\n\nScott:\n\nThat we're not laying in one way or the other, but we, we, we try to\n\nScott:\n\nreally understand what it was like back then and also identify the lens\n\nScott:\n\nthat we view things through now.\n\nScott:\n\nIf you can identify that, you're, you're going to understand history a lot better.\n\nScott:\n\nYou're going to understand what these historic figures are saying in public,\n\nScott:\n\nin interviews, in whatever letters they write much better if you understand one.\n\nScott:\n\nThe glasses that we look at things and two, the context\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd like I said, I like to tell you what people said, I also\n\nJenn:\n\nlike to tell you what people did.\n\nJenn:\n\nAgain, you can make up your mind of how you feel about John Wayne, and you\n\nJenn:\n\ncan tell us in the comments if how you feel about him, because I know people\n\nJenn:\n\nhave different feelings about him.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut for the most part, what I want you to know and understand is as a historian,\n\nJenn:\n\nour job, and my job, when I talk to people like Miss Heron, who It was\n\nJenn:\n\nbrought up in the times of Mississippi.\n\nJenn:\n\nI want to understand where they're coming from.\n\nJenn:\n\nStart to pose the questions and get in their mind.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd when you really start to change hearts, you really have to understand\n\nJenn:\n\nwhere someone's coming from.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd if you really want Change.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd if that's what we want in this world is to change people\n\nJenn:\n\nand use history as a catalyst.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo don't repeat history.\n\nJenn:\n\nDon't do the same things as stories.\n\nJenn:\n\nIf we want to use history as a catalyst, then we really have to treat\n\nJenn:\n\npeople with respect where they're at, understand where they're coming\n\nJenn:\n\nfrom and really empathize and then start to pull, ask questions and get.\n\nJenn:\n\nchange of heart if, if that's what we're looking for.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo again, as a historian, I, you know, and I love John Wayne.\n\nJenn:\n\nI wanted to talk about his family, his love of his family, and I\n\nJenn:\n\nwanted to paint the picture.\n\nJenn:\n\nThree wives, seven kids, and had this playboy interview, acted differently\n\nJenn:\n\nin real life, and part of his grave when he finally passes away.\n\nJenn:\n\nJuly and June of 1979 he's buried at Pacific View Memorial Park and\n\nJenn:\n\nhe has not an ornate tombstone.\n\nJenn:\n\nWe've talked about this before he's buried in the same Cemetery as\n\nJenn:\n\nJimmy Stewart not far actually away from Jimmy Stewart flat tombstone.\n\nJenn:\n\nNothing even that's It sticks out out of the ground and it says tomorrow\n\nJenn:\n\ncomes clean with no mistakes in it.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd we hope that we have learned something from yesterday to\n\nJenn:\n\ndo our best for tomorrow.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd that is from the same interview.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo I'm just putting it out there.\n\nJenn:\n\nThat is what's on this tombstone.\n\nJenn:\n\nThat's the same interview.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd here I hear what I hear when I hear this is someone who is admits that\n\nJenn:\n\nthey are still learning and not always\n\nScott:\n\nYeah.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd that's, that's incredibly important.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd again, we've seen that a couple of times.\n\nScott:\n\nWe've talked about some controversial things.\n\nScott:\n\nWill say or do and, and later in life, they, you see their actions change\n\nScott:\n\nthat support, What you would assume is, is them learning and them accepting\n\nScott:\n\nand coming what we today would So\n\nScott:\n\nwe've had the privilege of delving deep into the life and legacy of John
