His family then hopped from Iowa town to Iowa town before settling in California when he was 7.\n\nMORE COVERAGE:\n\n11 things to see in the John Wayne museum\n\nJohn Wayne museum spotlights Midwestern morals\n\nFive films for John Wayne newbies\n\nThe $2.5 million, 6,100-square-foot facility, kitty-corner from the Duke's first home, will honor Wayne's film career and his die-hard patriotism. The centerpiece of the gallery is a collection of memorabilia from Wayne's life, including scripts, costumes, set pieces, posters, personal correspondence, an original Andy Warhol painting and a custom-made 1972 Pontiac station wagon.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nJohn Wayne Birthplace Museum, 205 S.
