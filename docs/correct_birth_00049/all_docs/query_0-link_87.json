        "text": "In the tiny living room of the tiny clapboard house where John Wayne was born, our tour guide explained “The Duke’s” family moved to Winterset, Iowa, in 1906 so his father could work in a pharmacy. They left in 1911 for Wayne’s father to take a similar job in nearby Earlham. I didn’t think much of it. None of us 16 visitors seemed to.\n\n“Wait,” I asked the guide. “So how old was John Wayne when the family left this house?”\n\n“Three,” she said, and continued with his life story.\n\nThree.\n\nOur nation’s most iconic movie star couldn’t tie his shoes when he left the house where we stood, but if you think that demeans the value of the most famous home in this little town, 30,000 annual visitors disagree. Standing in the room where little baby Wayne took his first breath — a dim, back corner space about 8 feet wide and 15 feet long — brings an inevitable hush to the tourists who come from all 50 states and dozens of countries. Some cry.\n\nLike the rest of the house, that room is stuffed with period-era furniture and memorabilia from The Duke’s career, including photos from the 160 films starring the former Marion Robert Morrison, an eye patch he wore in the original “True Grit” and an autographed copy of “The John Wayne Story,” a 1972 biography in which he inscribed:\n\nDavid —\n\nHaven’t read this yet. Hope I won’t regret signing it.\n\nDuke\n\nWayne’s birthplace makes clear that his greatness wasn’t just a product of the screen; it was in his journey from Heartland modesty to West Coast fame. It was classic American success, even if, despite the pleas of Winterset leaders, he apparently never returned to the town.\n\nIf true, it was too bad for The Duke because the town of 4,800 could have been built on a studio back lot. A handsome limestone courthouse anchors the town square while the usual small-town suspects orbit on all sides: the movie theater, the shoe store, the coffee shop, the pharmacy (with requisite soda counter), the diner, the chiropractor and so on.\n\n“You wouldn’t think someone like that would come from Winterset,” said Marilyn Hull, 73, who grew up here. “Then again, I didn’t know he was from here for a long time.”\n\nA lot of people didn’t. Until Wayne died in 1979, much of Winterset didn’t give a lick about being John Wayne’s birthplace. Then, as with so many celebrities, death was a great career move. People started showing up at the house at Second and South streets, which, these days, is down the street from a video rental store and tanning salon.\n\n“The gentleman who lived here in the early 1980s, if he forgot to lock his door, would find people standing in his living room wanting to see the birthplace of John Wayne,” my tour guide said.\n\nIn 1982, the not-for-profit John Wayne Birthplace Society bought the house. It has raised $1 million of a targeted $5.5 million for a proper museum. Until then, it offers visitors a 7½-foot bronze Wayne statue, a well-stocked gift shop and 20-minute tours of the house: 10 minutes of guided talk and 10 minutes of wandering, though there isn’t far to wander in 860 square feet. Still, the memorabilia is plentiful, including his Page 4 birth announcement in the May 30, 1907, Winterset Madisonian that says, “A thirteen-pound son arrived at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Clyde Morrison Monday morning.”\n\nThe main event comes around Wayne’s May 26 birthday, when the birthplace museum hosts a party that draws close to 10,000 visitors. For two days, it’s all Wayne: an auction, music, food and, of course, movie screenings."
