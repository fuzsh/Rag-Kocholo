        "text": "John Wayne:\n\nSome words can give you a feeling that make your heart warm.\n\nJohn Wayne:\n\nRepublic is one of those words.\n\nJohn Wayne:\n\nMeryl,\n\nJohn Wayne:\n\nyou

I've seen you.\n\nJohn Wayne:\n\nTen years, I think.\n\nJohn Wayne:\n\nWanna quit, quit.\n\nJohn Wayne:\n\nGo on back to the bottle, get drunk.\n\nJohn Wayne:\n\nOne thing, though.\n\nJohn Wayne:\n\nSomebody throws a dollar in a spittoon.\n\nJohn Wayne:\n\nDon't expect me to do something about it.\n\nJohn Wayne:\n\nJust get down on your knees and go after it.\n\nJohn Wayne:\n\nThat's my steak Valance.\n\nJohn Wayne:\n\nBut you heard him, dude, pick it up.\n\nJohn Wayne:\n\nI said you, Liberty.\n\nScott:\n\nJen, we have learned episode in Spotify.\n\nJenn:\n\nThat's cool.\n\nScott:\n\nYeah.\n\nScott:\n\nSo someone commented on Spotify on the Lincoln Presidential Museum.\n\nScott:\n\nThey said, I learned that I need to visit that museum.\n\nScott:\n\nThat is 100 percent true.\n\nScott:\n\nThis is I can't really tell what the name is.\n\nScott:\n\nIt looks like an abbreviation.\n\nScott:\n\nThe facility seemed, seems so historically immersive.\n\nScott:\n\nI love both talk with history and walk with history.\n\nScott:\n\nThank you so much for your content.\n\nScott:\n\nWell, thank you so much.\n\nScott:\n\nJust going to say day diva.\n\nScott:\n\nDega\n\nJenn:\n\nDiva.\n\nJenn:\n\nDig a diva.\n\nScott:\n\nthe Spotify name is, but that's awesome.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut that's awesome.\n\nJenn:\n\nThat's the whole point.\n\nScott:\n\nThat's the whole point.\n\nScott:\n\nWe're hoping to teach you something and prompt you to go\n\nScott:\n\nout and visit that location.\n\nScott:\n\nThat is literally our goal for walk with history and talk with\n\nJenn:\n\nThat is, that is it in a nutshell.\n\nJenn:\n\nWe also had something else happen to us on the road.\n\nScott:\n\nOh yeah, so for our Talk With History listeners, you guys will enjoy\n\nJenn:\n\nSo we have painted the back of our car Walk with History, YouTube,\n\nJenn:\n\nand Talk with History, podcast.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd we also put our Venmo on there in case anyone wants to help us out for\n\nJenn:\n\ngas money or coffee or things like that.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd we were driving.\n\nJenn:\n\nto our, to our historic location over the weekend and I was beside a, a trucker.\n\nJenn:\n\nI was in the passenger seat, Scott was driving and he held up his phone and on\n\nJenn:\n\nhis phone I could see he was listening to the Talk With History podcast.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe was pointing at his phone, yeah, being very dangerous on the\n\nJenn:\n\nroad and pointing at his phone and showing me that he was listening\n\nJenn:\n\nto the Talk With History podcast.\n\nScott:\n\npodcast.\n\nScott:\n\nYeah, so that, that was neat because I was driving and Jen was like, Ah,\n\nScott:\n\na trucker just like showed, showed me his phone and what he was looking at.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd I was like, Oh no, where is this going?\n\nScott:\n\nAnd he said, no, no, no, no.\n\nScott:\n\nIt was our podcast.\n\nScott:\n\nHe showed us our podcast cover that he was listening.\n\nScott:\n\nSo actually, you know, if that gentleman's listening, you know, thank\n\nScott:\n\nyou for, you know, seeing that on the car and for, for showing us that you're\n\nScott:\n\nsupporting the podcast by listening.\n\nScott:\n\nAs you heard from the intro, we're going to talk about John Wayne's\n\nScott:\n\nbirthplace, actually his hometown museum.\n\nScott:\n\nWe're going to talk about his actual birthplace next for next week's episode.\n\nScott:\n\nBut one thing I did want to say that we got kind of a neat Story from\n\nScott:\n\none of our YouTube comments because this is the video that just posted\n\nScott:\n\nlast Wednesday on walk with This is actually from my daddy's green eyes\n\nScott:\n\nand she said the green berets, right?\n\nScott:\n\nSo a lot of we had a lot of comments on favorite movies and we're gonna talk\n\nScott:\n\nabout John Wayne's movie career a little bit tonight and the green berets at least\n\nScott:\n\na lot of it was filmed at Fort Benning, Georgia She said where my husband's\n\nScott:\n\nfather was stationed at the time.\n\nScott:\n\nJohn Wayne played football with some of the men there Including my father in law.\n\nScott:\n\nThis is my daddy's green eyes commenting.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd on that day, my husband, who was two years old at the time, was on base.\n\nScott:\n\nJohn Wayne held him for a while.\n\nScott:\n\nWe are both huge John Wayne fans, and he sure wishes he could remember\n\nScott:\n\nhis time in the Duke's arms.\n\nScott:\n\nThank you for taking us to this museum.\n\nScott:\n\nWhat a great place to visit.\n\nScott:\n\nI just thought that was so cool.\n\nScott:\n\nBecause it's, it's always neat to kind of...\n\nScott:\n\nInteract with someone who's either knew the person or had an experience with some\n\nScott:\n\nthat someone that we've covered on the\n\nJenn:\n\nSure.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd I, you know, I think that's so endearing.\n\nJenn:\n\nWe have a lot of John Wayne to cover.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo it's not going to be all in this episode.\n\nJenn:\n\nWe're going to also talk about movies.\n\nJenn:\n\nScott has finished my top 10 and he has ranked his top 10 and we will\n\nJenn:\n\ngo more in depth into those today will just be an overview of his\n\nJenn:\n\nbirthplace museum as so the location of his museum in which is at Iowa.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd basically like an overture of his movie career.\n\nScott:\n\nIowa, and so this is the tail end of our Reston Road\n\nScott:\n\nTrip.\n\nScott:\n\nOne of the places that we wanted to stop by and we're very glad we did.\n\nScott:\n\nThis is Winterset, Iowa.\n\nScott:\n\nSo Jen, tell us about not so much Winterset, Iowa, but why this museum\n\nJenn:\n\nSure, and I'll be honest, I probably would not have\n\nJenn:\n\nstopped in Iowa for anything.\n\nJenn:\n\nWe were driving back from South Dakota on our way to Ohio, and it's on the\n\nJenn:\n\nway, but there's, there's no reason to stop in Iowa except for this, for me.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo Winters at Iowa is where John Wayne was born.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd John Wayne was born Marion Morris.\n\nJenn:\n\nMarion Robert Morrison on May 26th, 1907.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd so we'll talk about his actual birthplace in a little bit more\n\nScott:\n\nabout his life and family next week\n\nJenn:\n\nYes.\n\nJenn:\n\nMm hmm.\n\nJenn:\n\nWe were\n\nScott:\n\nwe were there because they had a great Everybody kind\n\nScott:\n\nof knows the Fort Worth Museum.\n\nScott:\n\nThat's probably the bigger one.\n\nScott:\n\nBut this one was absolutely amazing\n\nJenn:\n\nSo this museum claims to have the largest diversified collection\n\nJenn:\n\nof artifacts of John Wayne.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo diversified.\n\nJenn:\n\nI think it means more than just movie props because\n\nJenn:\n\nthey have a bunch of posters.\n\nJenn:\n\nThey have a bunch of different things people wore.\n\nScott:\n\nhad art.\n\nJenn:\n\nThey had art, they had a big replica of the Alamo.\n\nJenn:\n\nWhen he was the director of the movie.\n\nScott:\n\nof the they had other things, you know, items from the movie.\n\nScott:\n\nYeah.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd we'll talk kind of more about some of the items that you see throughout the\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd they have some really great stuff in the gift shop.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo if you're interested in that as well, but I thought it was just a\n\nJenn:\n\nreally great museum to John Wayne.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt has a big statue of him out in front.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt lists his movies on tiles around the statue.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's named John Wayne Drive.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo it's 205 South John Wayne Drive.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo they really embraced that.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's their hometown hero.\n\nScott:\n\nTheir hometown here.\n\nScott:\n\nWell, because, and the funny part was, it's easy to get It's easy to look up.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's off the interstate.\n\nScott:\n\nthe interstate.\n\nScott:\n\nIt's off the interstate.\n\nScott:\n\nBut it's a little ways off the And it's kind of out in the middle of Iowa\n\nScott:\n\nin the cornfields and the farmland.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd it was very much like you could kind of picture this small town.\n\nScott:\n\nlike kind of had that because you were, I wouldn't say completely off\n\nScott:\n\nthe beaten path, but you weren't near any major metropolitan area.\n\nScott:\n\nNo major national park.\n\nScott:\n\nLike this town is kind of, is known for\n\nJenn:\n\nYeah, and unbeknownst to us, County.\n\nScott:\n\nThat's right.\n\nJenn:\n\nBecause we got there and we saw they had like movie stuff of\n\nJenn:\n\nthe Bridges of Madison County and I'm like, what county are we in?\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd they're like, Madison County.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd I'm like, is this like where the Bridges of Madison County?\n\nJenn:\n\nwas from and they're like, yeah, it was filmed here.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's based here.\n\nJenn:\n\nI'm like, Oh my gosh.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo that's also, and I liked that movie.\n\nJenn:\n\nThat's a Clint Eastwood, Meryl Streep, Meryl Streep movie.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd that's also, it was filmed there on location.\n\nJenn:\n\nThey have eight covered bridges and that's also kind of the\n\nScott:\n\nAnother\n\nJenn:\n\nanother draw of the area.\n\nScott:\n\nlet's walk us kind of through the different sections\n\nScott:\n\nof this, this John Wayne\n\nJenn:\n\nSure.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo you walk straight into the gift shop basically, and they give you a movie\n\nJenn:\n\nand the movie is part of your ticket.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd the movie just goes over John Wayne's.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's an overture of John Wayne's life and of him being born there.\n\nJenn:\n\nNow, again, his name is Marion Robert Morrison, and that'll be his name all\n\nJenn:\n\nthe way up until his movie career.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe starts as a B actor in in westerns.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd even then he's not really listed on the credits.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd when he's first listed on credits, it's Duke Morrison.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd we'll talk more about where the Duke comes from.\n\nJenn:\n\nHis dog growing up was named Duke, but it was actually the producers.\n\nJenn:\n\nWhen he starts to get more mainstream, they sit down and\n\nJenn:\n\nthey name him and they quit.\n\nJenn:\n\nThey were going to call him Duke Wayne, but they thought it wasn't\n\nJenn:\n\nunderstood, you know, and people weren't really gravitate towards it.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo someone just produced it, let's just do John.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo then John Wayne was born.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe didn't even pick it.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo you walk in, you do the gift shop.\n\nJenn:\n\nYou have a lot of great movie posters, a lot of great memorabilia there.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd then over to the movie and then across from the movie, there's basically\n\nJenn:\n\ntwo big rooms and they are just immersive of everything from his Career\n\nJenn:\n\nand it kind of walks you through him.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe went to USC.\n\nJenn:\n\nhis\n\nJenn:\n\nfamily eventually moved to California.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe goes to USC on a football scholarship.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe gets injured and starts working at the movies there because\n\nJenn:\n\nthat's, it was a job industry.\n\nJenn:\n\nI mean, your great grandfather worked in the movie industry.\n\nScott:\n\nis right smack there next to Hollywood.\n\nScott:\n\nYou know,\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd so he,\n\nScott:\n\neasy transition for someone that was tall and good\n\nScott:\n\nlooking and, you know, athletic\n\nJenn:\n\nand I think he started basically as a, as a hand, as a stage hand.\n\nJenn:\n\nLike he just was moving stuff around.\n\nJenn:\n\nI mean, big guy, right?\n\nJenn:\n\nHe's 6'3 6'4 1 2 but and so he's moving stuff around and someone spots him, much\n\nJenn:\n\nlike the Harrison Ford story, right?\n\nJenn:\n\nSomeone spots him, and they're making these B level Westerns, and they just\n\nJenn:\n\nkind of throw him in these Westerns.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd that's where he kind of gets his start, and he's, he,\n\nScott:\n\nthat was like in the 20s?\n\nScott:\n\nYeah, that was\n\nJenn:\n\nin the 20s.\n\nScott:\n\nBecause his first big movie, if I remember correctly, was in 1930.\n\nJenn:\n\n1930, The Big Trail.\n\nJenn:\n\nThat's his first leading role.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd again, so these, these B Westerns, he's just having these\n\nJenn:\n\nlittle bit parts and stuff.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut yeah, that's when he gets his first big role.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut it really isn't until 1939, so nine years later when he's in\n\nJenn:\n\nstagecoach with John Ford, that he...\n\nJenn:\n\nis a breakout movie star.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's when he does that role.\n\nJenn:\n\nI think he plays the Ringo kid or something.\n\nJenn:\n\nI think it's Ringo kid.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe plays it.\n\nJenn:\n\nYeah, I think he actually plays like a bad guy.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut he's like, he is a cowboy who stopped in the stagecoach.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he kind of is almost like an anti hero even then, but he has this great close up.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd I even think Martin Scorsese is like that close up is just what draws you\n\nJenn:\n\ninto him because he has a movie star\n\nScott:\n\nHe totally does, and it was really, I had never really kind of looked\n\nScott:\n\ninto kind of the younger John Wayne.\n\nScott:\n\nBut you look at him, you know, I think I show a clip somewhere it was either\n\nScott:\n\nin that one or it was in the next week's video of him in the 1930 and he's he's\n\nScott:\n\nso young and he says he's skinny right but he's a built skinny and he's just\n\nScott:\n\na tall presence he's he's he's just a he's a big man but he's a handsome\n\nScott:\n\nHe's a man, especially when he's young.\n\nScott:\n\nHe's got that thin kind of movie star look face, and even as he ages throughout\n\nScott:\n\nhis career when a lot of the rest of us kind of know him a lot better, I\n\nScott:\n\nmean, he, he ages pretty well and I can absolutely see why someone would\n\nScott:\n\nbe like, Hey, you come over here and let me have you start standing in as\n\nScott:\n\na B movie, this role in that role.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd then he kind of just naturally\n\nJenn:\n\nYeah, John Wayne in through his film career, he'll make an 179 films.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd for three decades, he's a top box office draw.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo think for 30 years, you put John Wayne on in your movie, you're\n\nJenn:\n\ngoing to sell a ton of tickets.\n\nScott:\n\nthat was the cool thing about this museum is that it really\n\nScott:\n\ntakes you from the beginning, right?\n\nScott:\n\nSo if you kind of go in the gift shop, hang a right, you're going to go right\n\nScott:\n\ninto the beginning of his movie career.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd it does a great job of saying, here's John Wayne in the thirties\n\nScott:\n\nand here's him in the forties and the fifties and the sixties and have all\n\nScott:\n\nthis memorabilia and movie posters on the wall and not just American\n\nScott:\n\nmovie posters, but movie posters from\n\nJenn:\n\nposters from overseas\n\nScott:\n\nIt was really neat to see that\n\nScott:\n\ntoo,\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's, they just have like a plethora, that's why I can see why it's\n\nJenn:\n\ndiversity, diversity of artifacts because they have the jacket he wore in The\n\nJenn:\n\nSearchers, he had the shirt he wore in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valens, they\n\nJenn:\n\nhave the eyepatch he wore in True Grit, they have the brochure from the Oscars\n\nJenn:\n\nwhen he won the Oscar for True Grit.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut what I really loved about it is it really shows the\n\nJenn:\n\ngrowth of his movie career.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt shows, and I was reading like What do people say about John Wayne's acting and\n\nJenn:\n\nSiskel and Ebert said of John Wayne, he's the kind of person who you didn't know if\n\nJenn:\n\nhe was acting when he was making a movie.\n\nJenn:\n\nIs this him?\n\nJenn:\n\nOr is he playing a part?\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he really was a lot of those.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe, he said he learned as an actor to be a reactor, not an actor.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd so he was really trying to be in the moment when someone\n\nJenn:\n\nwas saying lines to him.\n\nJenn:\n\nHow would you react to that?\n\nJenn:\n\nHow would you answer that?\n\nJenn:\n\nHow would you respond to that?\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he also credits himself with fight scenes with the heavy.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo the heavy is usually the bad guy or the, the, The antagonists\n\nJenn:\n\nto the protagonists and so the heavy would always fight dirty.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut John Wayne said he brought the fighting dirty to the good guy.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo the good guy would always be clean cut and never doing anything dirty\n\nJenn:\n\nand the bad guy would fight all dirty.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd John Wayne said when he was learning and acting, he would have to throw\n\nJenn:\n\neverything in the kitchen sink at him too.\n\nJenn:\n\nto pull off the stunt, to pull off the scene.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd so he thought, well, why wouldn't the good guy also throw a chair?\n\nJenn:\n\nWhy wouldn't the good guy also try to push him out of the way?\n\nJenn:\n\nSo he, he said he brought that to, to acting where the good guy was also\n\nJenn:\n\ngoing to do all the same kind of, you know, scrappy kind of fighting.\n\nScott:\n\ndidn't realize that because he really was one of those characters in\n\nScott:\n\nthe early, you know, kind of, I wouldn't call, I don't know if it's considered\n\nScott:\n\nthe golden age of cinema, but he really helped shape what you're you're.\n\nScott:\n\nyour hero, your, your, I'll call it the stereotypical hero, you know,\n\nScott:\n\nkind of embodied in partly because just like you said, you didn't know.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd that's kind of some of the, the aura around John Wayne you know, a\n\nScott:\n\nlot of the good characteristics of his characters, he seemed to also\n\nScott:\n\nembody outside, you know, of the movie\n\nJenn:\n\nor at\n\nScott:\n\nAnd people, or at least people put that on him, and I think\n\nScott:\n\nhe kind of embraced it for the most\n\nJenn:\n\nYeah, I think he found that important too.\n\nJenn:\n\nI know.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd we will go more into his life.\n\nJenn:\n\nIn the next podcast, this is his movie career, but I know it really bothered\n\nJenn:\n\nhim that he never served in the military.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd so he was really proud to make all the military movies.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd we talk about that as well.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he really wanted to, to show a positivity to the armed forces.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he tried to serve in the military and he actually tried, John Ford had left to\n\nJenn:\n\ngo work in the Navy and work for the OSS.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd so John Wayne had tried to.\n\nJenn:\n\nenlist that way, but he couldn't because he was too old.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe actually was too old and Pearl Harbor happened.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe was 34.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd that was why he wasn't able to join the military.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut he tries and John Ford actually gave him like a couple\n\nJenn:\n\nmissions and he did them.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo he gets like honorary member.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut I like that he Always wanted to show the positivity of that and I know\n\nJenn:\n\nwe talked about Green Berets no one really wanted to make a movie about\n\nJenn:\n\nthe military during Vietnam and he stepped up and did it and A lot of it.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe was older to make that movie, but he wanted to portray The military the\n\nJenn:\n\narmy in a positive light and he know he knew he had a lot of star power at\n\nJenn:\n\nthe time So for me, I just I really wanted to show that And they really\n\nJenn:\n\ndo a good job of honoring his military\n\nJenn:\n\nacting career, and so,\n\nScott:\n\na whole section.\n\nScott:\n\nSo if you're walking into\n\nJenn:\n\nmm hmm,\n\nScott:\n\nright.\n\nScott:\n\nFirst off, if you're ever in the Iowa area, which I don't know.\n\nScott:\n\nI'm not sure much what's out there and not knocking on Iowa itself.\n\nScott:\n\nI just don't know much about the state, but if you do decide to go visit, you\n\nScott:\n\nwould walk in, hang a right, you're in the big kind of, this is the primary\n\nScott:\n\nroom where most of the displays are.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd it's taking you through his career throughout the decades.\n\nScott:\n\nIt kind of loops all the way around.\n\nScott:\n\nThen you getting over.\n\nScott:\n\nthings like true grit, and they start having different sections.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd so they've got a military section about some of the\n\nScott:\n\nmilitary movies that he made.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd so some of the naval roles that he played in the army roles that he played\n\nScott:\n\nand, and showing, I mean, they have like some of his, his costumes, you know, they\n\nScott:\n\nhave a lot of kind of actual actual movie.\n\nScott:\n\nthings that he wore and items from all these different movies.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd so there's a whole military section there.\n\nScott:\n\nIt's actually right next to, like, a whole display of kind of tribute\n\nJenn:\n\nYes, yes.\n\nJenn:\n\nYes.\n\nScott:\n\nso some of them were kind of, not all of them are actually from the movie.\n\nScott:\n\nSome of them were actually tribute, you know, kind of made to look like\n\nScott:\n\nwhatever revolver he had in some western\n\nJenn:\n\nThat was neat.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo, you know, you think of John Wayne.\n\nJenn:\n\nhe has played these larger than life figures, but the thing is, like John\n\nJenn:\n\nWayne has aged and a lot of those military movies he's playing, he's a\n\nJenn:\n\nlot older than the rank he's portraying.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut I do like they, they do, they have the carriage for the quiet man there.\n\nScott:\n\nThat was\n\nJenn:\n\nSo we talk about that because we've both been to Kong.\n\nScott:\n\nin the other wing,\n\nJenn:\n\nYes.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd because they, the bigger that's that needed an area for bigger.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd so we talk about Maureen O'Hara because John Wayne has had a lot\n\nJenn:\n\nof great co stars Jimmy Stewart, Maureen O'Hara, Lee Marvin, Dean\n\nJenn:\n\nMartin, Ron Howard, end of his life, Lauren Bacall, Katherine Hepburn.\n\nJenn:\n\nLike he is, he is.\n\nJenn:\n\nable to hold his own as a leading man with all of these A list actors.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd so, Maureen O'Hara, of course, he's been in a couple movies,\n\nScott:\n\nVery well known.\n\nScott:\n\nThose two.\n\nScott:\n\nThose two\n\nJenn:\n\nYes, and so, we had gone to Kong, and we put in some pictures.\n\nJenn:\n\nWe stayed in Nashville Castle, and we walked through there.\n\nScott:\n\n2010.\n\nScott:\n\nwent to Kong.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd so it's funny, I was actually looking at some of those\n\nScott:\n\npictures of, of, that was right.\n\nScott:\n\nI'd gotten out of the\n\nJenn:\n\nMm\n\nScott:\n\nback in and it was 2010, but some of those places down in Kong, right?\n\nScott:\n\nSo in, in Kong, if you're listening, if you've ever seen the quiet man, you\n\nScott:\n\nknow, this little Irish based movie a little bit different for him, not your\n\nScott:\n\ntypical Western, but one of our favorites and the, the downtown area of Kong.\n\nScott:\n\nThey, I mean, they had actually filmed that area and they had recently redone,\n\nScott:\n\nbut one of the plaques was like from 2008.\n\nScott:\n\nThey had only finished kind of dressing it up, you know, just before we got there.\n\nScott:\n\nIt was really neat.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut one of 2008, and they have like\n\nScott:\n\ndo.\n\nScott:\n\nThey have like a whole corner of like what a set would look\n\nScott:\n\nlike and like him on lighting.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd because they talk a lot about John Ford and his cinematography and\n\nJenn:\n\nthe searchers is probably my idea and not just Quiet Man, which has great\n\nJenn:\n\ncinematography, also John Ford, but the searchers has great, you know,\n\nJenn:\n\nthe settings of Monument Valley.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd then the man who shot Liberty Valance.\n\nJenn:\n\nwith Jimmy Stewart.\n\nJenn:\n\nTrue Grit is when he wins his Best Actor award.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut they also go into like The Shootist, because that's also with Jimmy Stewart.\n\nJenn:\n\nThat's his last movie with Ron Howard.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd then you're going to get a bunch of the different scripts,\n\nJenn:\n\nany little kind of memorabilia they have from those bigger movies.\n\nJenn:\n\nShe wore yellow ribbon, the Cowboys, I think they had a shirt from the Cowboys.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut they have all these little pieces that you can walk around and go, Oh, yeah.\n\nJenn:\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nScott:\n\nOne of the things that you pointed out very briefly in the\n\nScott:\n\nvideo that I thought was really cool was a painting by Andy Warhol.\n\nJenn:\n\nI love\n\nScott:\n\nwas really cool.\n\nJenn:\n\nYeah, so Andy Warhol has done a, one of those overlap screen art\n\nJenn:\n\nportraits of John Wayne as a cowboy.\n\nScott:\n\nI mean, I was kind of surprised, like, was it a print?\n\nScott:\n\nI, I, I, I imagine it had to be a print because it was like an Andy Warhol.\n\nScott:\n\nThey're not going to be hanging out there in the\n\nJenn:\n\nNo, an original Andy Warhol.\n\nJenn:\n\nThat's probably worth 150, 000.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's probably in the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut no, you can buy a print.\n\nJenn:\n\nThey were selling them in the gift shop, and I do love it.\n\nJenn:\n\nI probably won't get it in one point.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut they have a real life kind of replica of the Alamo.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo when John Wayne directed the Alamo, and he did get an Oscar nomination for it.\n\nScott:\n\nWas that, so was that the only movie that he had\n\nJenn:\n\nYeah, yeah,\n\nScott:\n\nAnd I remember, and I put it up as a little kind of pop up\n\nJenn:\n\nMm\n\nScott:\n\nthat the, he wanted, I guess he wanted to direct\n\nScott:\n\nthis movie about The Alamo.\n\nScott:\n\nYes.\n\nScott:\n\nBut the movie studios would only agree to fund it if he starred in\n\nScott:\n\nit.\n\nJenn:\n\nYes.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he plays Davy Crockett.\n\nScott:\n\nDavy Right.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd so he is not really playing, you know?\n\nScott:\n\nYeah.\n\nScott:\n\nHis, his, his typical character.\n\nScott:\n\nBut I, I, I can see how a movie studio, he'd be like, yeah, we will let you direct\n\nScott:\n\nsomething, but you need to be the starring role because he's just this massive,\n\nJenn:\n\na massive\n\nJenn:\n\ndraw.\n\nJenn:\n\nNow don't get me wrong, John Wayne played some characters that he didn't quite fit.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe played Genghis Khan in a movie.\n\nJenn:\n\nDidn't quite fit that.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe played, if you, The Greatest Story Ever Told.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe plays a centurion, who with Jesus, kind of odd.\n\nJenn:\n\nYou're like, oh, that's John Wayne.\n\nJenn:\n\nWhat?\n\nJenn:\n\nThat's weird.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut he's, I don't even think he, I think he might have one line in the movie.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut he is a box office draw.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut, He also has a persona that people are used to seeing him in, and it's\n\nJenn:\n\nusually very Western or military.\n\nJenn:\n\nI would say even Quiet Man, he fits that persona, but it's a leading\n\nJenn:\n\nman who is almost like a broken man, maybe coming back up into\n\nJenn:\n\nhis own, and playing something off character like that was always good.\n\nJenn:\n\nNot been quite fit for him, but we talk about him winning the\n\nJenn:\n\nOscar for true grit, which I don't think is his best performance.\n\nJenn:\n\nI do like him as Rooster Cogburn, but I really love him and the searchers and he\n\nJenn:\n\nreceives his Oscar from Barbra Streisand.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd when he leans over to think to take it from her, he says beginners luck in her\n\nScott:\n\nhe'd been in the industry already for 30 plus\n\nJenn:\n\nand she just thought it was like the cutest thing.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd he actually cries like he wiped the tear it away when he thinks the audience.\n\nScott:\n\nhe also say, well, he was on stage.\n\nScott:\n\nHe's like, if I had known that this was going to happen, I would\n\nScott:\n\nhave put that eye patch on sooner.\n\nJenn:\n\nbecause he didn't want to wear it.\n\nJenn:\n\nThat was one of the biggest things when he was making the movie.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe didn't want to wear the eyepatch.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd actually we've talked about this before.\n\nJenn:\n\nThe eyepatch is actually see through.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's actually like a gauze that you could actually see through.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd if you look at it, it's there in the museum.\n\nJenn:\n\nIf you look at it, you can kind of see where it's not quite a full\n\nJenn:\n\neyepatch, like a leather eyepatch.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo it made it easier probably for him to act, but yeah, it was, I really enjoyed.\n\nJenn:\n\nThose are basically the big two rooms with a lot of,\n\nScott:\n\nthe, the other room that didn't have as much of the movie posters\n\nScott:\n\nagain, was kind of like, there was like a quiet man's section, Alamo section,\n\nScott:\n\nand then they actually had a bunch of kind of personal life type stuff.\n\nScott:\n\nThey had like one of his\n\nJenn:\n\nOne of his cars is there.\n\nJenn:\n\nA lot of his fan mail.\n\nScott:\n\nfan mail, which that was really cool to see.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd we showed that pretty well in the video of all these\n\nScott:\n\nletters that were written to him.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd it was neat to see someone's, someone's handwriting that says, John\n\nScott:\n\nWayne, movie star, Hollywood, Los Angeles.\n\nScott:\n\nIt was really neat to see that because you could tell that Probably was an adult,\n\nScott:\n\nwasn't an adult that wrote that particular letter that I showed in the video.\n\nScott:\n\nHe was probably a, you know, a child or someone younger.\n\nScott:\n\nBut then they showed like a bunch of his like leisure wear that he would\n\nScott:\n\nnormally wear, you know, out on his boat.\n\nJenn:\n\nWell, and you have to think, we're going to talk more about this in\n\nJenn:\n\nhis lifestyle, but John Wayne is a big family man, has seven children, and\n\nJenn:\n\nhe's a big proponent around Hollywood.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe's going to give a lot of his wealth away.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo you think of the John Wayne Cancer Research Foundation, think about, he\n\nJenn:\n\nstarted the tennis club in Newport beach.\n\nJenn:\n\nIt's still there today.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe liked to boat.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo\n\nScott:\n\nactually got an airport named after\n\nJenn:\n\nhe has an airport named after him.\n\nJenn:\n\nYes.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo he, he was very much giving back to everybody.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd from what I've heard about him, if you approached him, he was very open\n\nJenn:\n\nto signing autographs and meeting.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe was very, he loved his fans.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo even to have all that fan mail is understandable\n\nJenn:\n\nbecause he did love his fans.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe loved interacting with his fans.\n\nJenn:\n\nHe just loved that connection he had to people.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd Like, I feel it.\n\nJenn:\n\nI, John, I probably only lived for two years during John Wayne's life,\n\nJenn:\n\nbut I feel a connection to John Wayne.\n\nJenn:\n\nLike, I like watching his movies and I feel like I'm watching my dad on screen.\n\nJenn:\n\nSo I can see how people would feel this connection to him and want to watch him.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut yeah, I really, We talk about his movie career.\n\nJenn:\n\nI still watch new movies of his even today.\n\nJenn:\n\nI went to the Turner Classic movie weekend and I saw she wore a yellow ribbon.\n\nJenn:\n\nI had never seen that before.\n\nJenn:\n\nAnd so there's still new movies of John Wayne I'm discovering,\n\nJenn:\n\nbut we're going to talk about our favorites and on another podcast,\n\nScott:\n\ncoming up in a future\n\nJenn:\n\nif you have favorites of John Wayne, please let us know, or movies you want us\n\nJenn:\n\nto watch or review, please let us know.\n\nJenn:\n\nBut yeah, I'm, it was a really great museum.\n\nJenn:\n\nIf you're a John Wayne fan, you have to get there.\n\nScott:\n\nIt was a to get there.\n\nScott:\n\nYeah, it's definitely worth, worth taking a day to get out to Winterset, Iowa to\n\nScott:\n\nvisit, you know, this John Wayne Museum.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd I think it actually opened up around the same time as as the Fort Worth\n\nScott:\n\nSo thank you for allowing us to be your guides on a journey through the enduring\n\nScott:\n\nlegacy of John Wayne's illustrious all from the heart of Winterset, Iowa.\n\nScott:\n\nThe John Wayne Birthplace Museum is more than just a tribute to a cinematic\n\nScott:\n\nicon, it's a journey through the themes that resonated throughout his career,\n\nScott:\n\nthe very themes that helped shape the landscape of American film history.\n\nScott:\n\nAs you walk through the museum, you can see the rugged individualism,\n\nScott:\n\nthe unwavering determination, and the unyielding sense of justice that John\n\nScott:\n\nWayne brought to life in his characters.\n\nScott:\n\nHis films were more than just entertainment.\n\nScott:\n\nThey were a reflection of the American spirit, and those themes from his\n\nScott:\n\nfilms still resonate with us today.\n\nScott:\n\nSo thank you for listening to the Talk With History podcast.\n\nScott:\n\nAnd please reach out to us at our website,
