        "text": "We packed up and headed west from Amana this morning. Using secondary roads takes longer, but takes us through many small towns – and lots more fields of corn and soybeans. We were surprised that much of it was pretty hilly. Late in the afternoon we reached Winterset, Iowa.\n\nThe map said this was the birthplace of John Wayne. We found a statue to John Wayne and his boyhood home. He was born here in 1907 – (13 pounds) – the firstborn of Scotch and Irish parents. They actually left Iowa before he began school and moved to California.\n\nHowever, the house has been maintained and is furnished as it would have been in 1907, – just not many original family pieces. They had collected lots of photos, articles about John Wayne, props from some of his movies, tributes to him from many areas, including a special Congressional Medal of Honor to honor his patriotism and love of country. (He did not serve in the military). He only won one Academy Award, but played in hundred of movies over the years. It was really very interesting.\n\nAs we came into town, we had seen a sign for a city campground. By the time we finished the tour, it was nearly 5:00, so we decided to stay tonight in the city campground. It is reasonably priced, clean and quiet. A nice surprise."
