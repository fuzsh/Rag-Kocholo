        "text": "Duke Morrison often worked, as did many Southern California college students, for filmmakers as extras and/or grips. He can be spotted in several late 1920's silentâ€™s, including Brown of Harvard (1926), The Drop Kick, Mother Macree (both 1927), Hangman's House and Four Sons (both 1928). Several of those were directed by John Ford, who gave Duke and his football pal Wardell Bond bit parts in his 1929 talkie Salute.\n\nOut in the cold again, he won the lead in a Poverty Row quickie, His Private Secretary then spent the next two years starring in B Westerns for Monogram Pictures. (The first, 1933's Riders of Destiny cast him as \"Singin' Sandy,\" although his warbling was dubbed by the son of director Robert N. Bradbury.) He spent the rest of the 1930's headlining Westerns and grade-B action features, first for Republic and then for Universal. He returned to Republic in 1938 to replace Bob Livingston as Stony Burke in eight entries of the long-running \"Three Mesquiteers\" series, including Pals of the Saddle, Overland Stage Raiders (both 1938),The Night Riders, Wyoming Outlaw and New Frontier (all 1939).\n\nReunited with Ford and Mitchell, Wayne stepped away from his usual Western roles to become a Swedish seaman in The Long Voyage Home (1940). The film was adapted from a play by Eugene O'Neill and follows the crew of a steamer ship as they move a shipment of explosives. Along with many positive reviews, the movie earned several Academy Award nominations. He continued to work out his contract at Republic, starring in B-plus vehicles at the studio, but he was also in demand, for the first time, as a leading man in Hollywood.\n\nWayne then went on to share starring honors with Ray Milland and Paulette Goddard in Cecil B. DeMille's Reap the Wild Wind (all 1942), romanced Joan Crawford in Reunion in France (also 1942), Jean Arthur in A Lady Takes a Chance (1943), and Claudette Colbert in Without Reservations (1946).He also forged a lifelong association with war movies by starring in Flying Tigers (1942), The Fighting Seabees (1944), Back to Bataan and John Ford's They Were Expendable (both 1945).Ironically, he was exempt from military service in real life because of an ear infection developed during underwater shooting on Reap the Wild Wind.\n\nThat same year he made war movie history as the tough-as-nails Marine drill instructor (who has a heart, after all) in Sands of Iwo Jima (1949), which earned him his first Academy Award nomination. Ford and Wayne made one more Cavalry film, Rio Grande (1950), as a payback to Republic boss Herbert J. Yates; by turning out this sure-fire box-office film, they earned the right to make Ford's pet project, The Quiet Man.\n\nWayne formed his own production company, Batjac (the name of the shipping company in 1948's Wake of the Red Witch to develop projects both for him and for other stars. Having produced Budd Boetticher's Bullfighter and the Lady (1951) at Republic, he hired the director again for the Randolph Scott Western Seven Men From Now (1956).He also put strapping James Arness under personal contract, and recommended him to CBS for the lead in the \"Gunsmoke\" TV series, even introducing the first episode on camera. Wayne co-produced and starred in Big Jim McLain (1952), Island in the Sky, Hondo (both 1953), The High and the Mighty (1954), Blood Alley (1955), and Legend of the Lost (1957).\n\nOften accused of simply \"playing himself\" on screen, Wayne tried to stretch in the 1950's, but his choices were ill advised, to say the least, and both The Conqueror (1956, in which he played Genghis Khan) and The Barbarian and the Geisha (1958, in which he played 19th-century American ambassador Townsend Harris) were major fiascos. In the years to follow he stuck to the tried-and-true, and who can blame him? Audiences lined up to see a \"John Wayne movie\" and he gave them what they wanted. His last \"personal\" projects, which he directed and starred in, were the sprawling, extravagant super-production The Alamo (1960), in which he played Davy Crockett, and The Green Berets (1968), which reinforced his real-life image as a Hawk during the Vietnam era. These aside, Wayne continued working with Howard Hawks, in Rio Bravo (1959), the terrific African adventure Hatari! (1962), the Rio Bravo paraphrase El Dorado (1967), and Rio Lobo (1970), and John Ford in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance one segment of How the West Was Won (both 1962, in the latter as Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman), and Donovan's Reef (1963).\n\nIn later years Wayne appeared in a few non Western movies, even trying his hand at a more contemporary cop story (a la Clint Eastwood):In McQ (1974) Wayne was cast as a Seattle Police Lieutenant Lon McQ investigating the killing of his best friend who uncovers corrupt elements of the police department dealing in confiscated drugs, After McQ he made Brannigan (1975) a \"cop out of water\" film in the same vein as Clint Eastwood's Coogan's Bluff. The British action film set in London starred Wayne and Richard Attenborough, directed by Douglas Hickox. It tells the story of a Chicago detective sent to Britain to organise the extradition of an American mobster (John Vernon).\n\nWayne died on June 11, 1979, in Los Angeles, California. He was survived by his seven children from two of his three marriages. During his marriage to Josephine Saenz from 1933 to 1945, the couple had four children, two daughters Antonia and Melinda and two sons Michael and Patrick. Both Michael and Patrick followed in their father's footsteps-Michael as a producer and Patrick as an actor. With his third wife, Pilar Palette, he had three more children, Ethan, Aissa, and Marisa. Ethan has also worked as an actor over the years."
