        "text": "Louise Speaks: Day 21 Continued: We have had the best of luck on this trip. We had left Elk Horn and was trying to get to Winterset by 4:30 because we knew that’s when John Wayne’s birthplace closed. Thelma dropped me off at the corner and as I was walking to the house, they locked the door. I said we had come all the way from Arizona could they please let us in, and they did. Very nice of them to do that.\n\nBesides all the bridges, John Wayne is what put Winterset on the map. The mere mention of his name produces images of courage and patriotism. The life story of John Wayne began here in the Iowa town of Winterset. He was born Marion Robert Morrison on May 26, 1907, the son of Clyde and Mary Brown Morrison. This modest four-room home has been restored to reflect its appearance in 1907, the year of Duke’s birth. An impressive collection of John Wayne memorabilia includes unique items such as the eyepatch worn in the movie True Grit, a hat worn in Rio Lobo, and a prop suitcase used in the film Stagecoach. Since its opening, the childhood home of John Wayne has been visited by over one million people, including many celebrities and dignitaries. On November 3, 1984, President Ronald Reagan commented that the John Wayne Birthplace is an inspiring tribute to a good friend and a great American.\n\nThis year a huge birthday celebration was held at the Winterset home. Maureen O’Hara was in attendance. The celebration lasted 3 days and was full of daily activities. They showed John Wayne and Maureen O’Hara films all day, had a pancake breakfast, tons of food, races, tours of the home and an evening dance. This was the towns biggest event since the opening of the house. Funds are currently being collected to build a 5,000 square foot museum that will not only show memorabilia, but will also help teach new generations about the Duke and the character for which he stood.\n\nOn the tour, so much more was told to us. There are photographs of just about every phase of his life. Pictures of his marriages, his children, his awards, letters from presidents…just about everything. It was interesting to think of a family living in this 4 room house and to think there was a family of four living here. John Wayne and his family moved from Winterset when John was 7 years old…the rest is history.\n\nI’m really glad that we stopped, and very grateful for the tour guide to not only stay open, but to give us a tour and allow us to walk around the house for as long as we wanted. This was a great attraction, especially if you were a John Wayne fan. Definitely worth stopping for. John Wayne gets a B rating.\n\nThelma Speaks: John Wayne, the Duke, has been a favorite of mine for years. I have been here before but always love to come back and see the items they have collected that tell about all the movies he has played in and tons of other memorabilia. It was a quick trip to the museum and we did get the whole tour. What a lovely lady to stay and take us through the museum/home after hours. Winterset is a home the size of John Wayne. The people here love their Duke and they are not afraid to share their love with you. I can’t wait to come back and see the next addition with 5,000 feet of new displays!"
