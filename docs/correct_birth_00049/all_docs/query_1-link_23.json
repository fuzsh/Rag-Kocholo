        "text": "In a career that spanned five decades, John Wayne appeared in more than 175 movies and won a host of honors that included both an Academy Award and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor. But when he lived in Winterset, he was just little Marion Morrison, the son of Clyde, a pharmacist, and Molly, a telephone operator.\n\nAt Winterset's new John Wayne Birthplace Museum, both sides of the famous actor - the Hollywood legend and the small-town-boy - are celebrated. The $2.5 million building, which replaces a much smaller facility, is a testimony to the enduring appeal of Wayne, who was born in Winterset in 1907.\n\n'The reputation of most movie stars fades after they die, but a few become icons,” says Brian Downes, executive director of the museum. 'I think John Wayne continues to inspire affection because his life and film career symbolize much of what's best about America. We had over a million visitors to our old facility, and we believe our new museum is going to attract many more.”\n\nThe museum is located near Winterset's downtown (Winterset also is famous for its connection to the movie and book 'The Bridges of Madison County”). 'Two-thirds of the funding for the museum came in the form of small donations from fans around the world,” Downes says. 'That alone shows the continuing appeal of John Wayne.”\n\nA visit to the museum begins with a movie, an eight-minute documentary with scenes from many of his movies, from 'Rio Bravo” and 'True Grit” to 'The Quiet Man.” While Wayne is most identified with Westerns, the video shows the range of his film career, which included romantic comedies, war movies and historical films.\n\nThe first exhibits describe Wayne's off-screen life, from his childhood in Winterset to his family's move to California when he was 7. As a boy, he picked up the nickname Duke, which was the name of his dog. After an injury curtailed his football scholarship at the University of southern California, he turned to studio work to help pay tuition, changing the name Marion Morrison to John Wayne. He married three times and had seven children, including daughter Aissa, who serves on the board of directors.\n\nPersonal items in the museum include Wayne's address book, a well-traveled suitcase, and an artifact that fills an entire corner of the room: a 1972 Pontiac station wagon, one of the last cars that Wayne owned. Because he was so tall, he had the roof raised so he could fit more comfortably in its driver's seat. A nearby exhibit details Wayne's love of sailing (ironically, he had no love for horseback riding and did so only when he was making movies). Some of his happiest hours were spent on his yacht the Wild Goose.\n\nThe next section of the museum focuses on Wayne's film career. It's overseen by a life-size model of Wayne, dressed in Western attire in front of a mural of Monument Valley on the Utah-Arizona border, where many of his films were made. Posters of his films line the walls and display cases showcase photographs, film scripts, props and artifacts that include the eye patch he wore in 'True Grit” and his hat from 'Rio Bravo.”\n\nOther exhibits cover Wayne's role as an American citizen. Visitors can learn about his friendships with U.S. presidents, his political activism, and his support for cancer research (Wayne died of stomach cancer in 1979).\n\n'This is the only museum in the world dedicated to John Wayne, and we have the largest collection of his memorabilia,” says Mark Catton, museum designer. 'Our exhibits will grow and evolve so that people can keep coming back to learn new things about Wayne's life and career.”\n\nAfter touring the museum, visitors take a short walk to the four-room cottage where Wayne was born. The modest home has been decorated in the style of 1907, the year of Wayne's birth. Tour guides point out that while his birth weight was unusual (13 pounds), in other ways his early years were like those of any Iowa boy of the time.\n\nStanding in the little house gives one an appreciation for the extraordinary life of the actor. From his small-town beginning, Wayne went on to become one of the most famous men in the world. And nearly four decades after his death, people continue to feel a connection to him.\n\n'One of my favorite stories from working here happened when two young women from Minnesota visited on a snowy day in January,” Downes says. 'The one had given the other a Christmas gift of a visit to the museum. She told me that she lost her father when she was 10 years old, and that her happiest memory of him was sitting in his lap on Saturday afternoons watching John Wayne movies. That shows, I think, that people's love for John Wayne comes in many forms. And no matter what their connection is to the man, we welcome them here.”\n\nGrand Opening Celebration\n\nThe John Wayne Birthplace Museum will have its grand opening through Monday, just in time for the Duke's birthday on Tuesday. The Iowa Military Veterans Band will perform at the opening ceremony and the celebration's keynote speaker will be Scott Eyman, author of the New York Times best-selling biography 'John Wayne: The Life and Legend.” Special guests include actor Christopher Mitchum (the son of Robert Mitchum), who appeared in several of Wayne's movies. Country singer Marty Stuart will headline a museum benefit dinner, and a rodeo will be held at the Madison County Fairgrounds, followed by a dance."
