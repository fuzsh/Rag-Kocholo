        "text": "Quick facts about Flanders’ chemical industry\n\nIn Flanders, we don’t just feel the chemistry, we’ve also got plenty of tangible facts to prove that the region is brewing with chemical business activity:\n\nFlanders is home to Europe’s largest and the world’s second-largest integrated petrochemical cluster, part of the Port of Antwerp-Bruges.\n\nBelgium and Flanders rank as the world’s number 1 for chemicals and plastics sales per capita with an annual turnover of EUR 73.8 billion – over two thirds of which is generated in Flanders.\n\nThe chemical industry provides 65,159 direct jobs and 150,000 indirect jobs in Belgium, making it one of the country’s biggest employers.\n\n(Source: essenscia, 2021 key figures)\n\nDid you know that 8 of the world’s top 10 chemical companies operate production sites in Flanders, according to the sector federation essenscia? What’s more, all of the world’s top 10 biopharma companies have key activities in the region. It should therefore come as no surprise that huge amounts have been channeled by foreign firms into Flanders-based activities. To give you an idea, over EUR 13 billion in foreign direct investment was recorded in Flanders’ chemical industry between 2010 and 2020 (source: essenscia, 2021 key figures).\n\nMajor investments from the past years include large-scale projects initiated by Borealis (Austria), BASF (Germany), Covestro (Germany), Evonik (Germany), INEOS (UK), Kaneka (Japan), Nippon Shokubai (Japan) and more.\n\nThe chemical industry has a vital role to play in tackling climate challenges, realizing a circular economy and creating a carbon-smart society. That’s why Catalisti, Flanders’ spearhead cluster for chemistry and plastics, seeks to drive innovation and multidisciplinary partnerships in these high-impact domains with the goal of tackling a massive host of projects focused on sustainability. Your company can join the chemical innovation frenzy, too!\n\nFurthermore, Catalisti is in the driver’s seat of Moonshot, an industrial innovation program that unites citizens, governments and industries in working toward a clear mission: to transform Flanders into a CO2-neutral society by 2050. How? Through the development of marketable innovative and sustainable technologies. To this aim, the government of Flanders invests a total of EUR 400 million spread across various Moonshot projects.\n\nFederations for the chemical win\n\nThe fact that chemistry is one Flanders’ flagship industries is also reflected in the presence of numerous federations that represent the interests of companies active in (petro)chemicals, polymers, plastics, specialty chemicals and related business fields such as cleantech.\n\nThe most prominent ones include:\n\nessenscia vlaanderen – multisector organization and network of 450+ chemical and life sciences companies in Flanders.\n\nDETIC – the association for producers and distributers of soaps, cosmetics, (laundry) detergents, cleaning and maintenance products, hygienic and toilet articles, household coatings, paints, and adhesives.\n\nFederplast – the association of producers of rubber and plastic products.\n\nIVP – the federation of manufacturers and importers of paints and coatings, varnishes, printing inks and decorative coatings.\n\nResearch groups that mean serious business\n\nVarious university research groups in Flanders stand ready to help you turn science into a profitable innovative business. Below are just a few examples:\n\nThe Integrated Sustainable Chemistry consortium (InSusChem) helps chemical experts improve how natural resources are used to meet the need for chemical products and services. Part of Antwerp University (UAntwerp), it sets up industry collaborations that focus on the development of better, energy-saving and resource-efficient technologies. Further adding to the consortium’s expertise is BlueApp, an open-innovation hub for the co-creation of smart solutions for sustainable chemistry.\n\nCleanChem is a Ghent University (UGent) technology transfer cluster for sustainable chemical production.\n\nAssociated with Hasselt University (UHasselt) and strategic research center imec, imo-imomec brings chemists, physicists and engineers together. The goal is to conduct multidisciplinary materials research focused on advanced material systems for a sustainable and healthy society.\n\nPart of Ghent University (UGent), the Laboratory for Circular Process Engineering (LCPE) is dedicated to chemical engineering in the circular economy. Among other things, it focuses on developing cost-effective recycling and (re)use processes to valorize organic and plastic waste.\n\nColloquially called ‘EcoChem’, UGent’s Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry and Applied Ecochemistry focuses on the fate of trace and toxic elements in agricultural and natural ecosystems as well as on the development of environmental tech and recycling of nutrients and tech-critical elements.\n\nFinancing your chemical business in Flanders\n\nWhen deciding to establish activities or headquarters in Flanders, your chemical company can reap the rewards of:\n\ngovernment subsidies and support for investments in R&D and innovation, strategic transformation, ecological efforts, growth and other domains.\n\ntax incentives to fund a broad range of business activities.\n\nfiscal options to help you cut labor costs.\n\nfinancing opportunities through investment company PMV, the Moonshot program, the Capricorn Sustainable Chemistry Fund, the Innovation Circle and the Innovation Fund.\n\nTax incentives for research-intensive activities\n\nFlanders offers access to several tax incentives that are particularly relevant to research-intensive sectors like the chemical industry. Examples include:\n\nthe innovation income deduction – up to 85% of a company’s net innovation income can be exempt from corporate tax.\n\nthe R&D investment deduction – 13.5% of the investment value (at once) or 20.5% of the annual depreciation (staggered).\n\nthe R&D payroll tax exemption – 80% of the withholding tax on professional income for researchers and academic personnel."
