        "text": "Taminco now a subsidiary of Eastman Chemical Company\n\nEastman announced the completion of its acquisition of Taminco, a global specialty chemical company. Eastman and Taminco share several key fundamentals, such as complementary technologies, strong technology platforms, business capabilities, and a high performance culture. Eastman and Taminco also share a strong attribute in having leading positions in diverse, attractive end markets. To learn more, read the press release.\n\nThree Taminco business divisions – Functional Amines, Specialty Amines, and Crop Protection – produce products used by our customers in the manufacturing of everyday products primarily used for these end markets: agriculture, water treatment, personal and home care, animal nutrition, and energy.\n\nAll Eastman products can be found at www.eastman.com/products. For a list of Taminco worldwide locations visit www.eastman.com/locations.\n\nFunctional Amines\n\nThe Taminco Functional Amines division – producing basic alkylamines and solvents – forms the engine room of Taminco and provides the platform of our downstream derivatives businesses. Demonstrated by our continual investments, we are committed to maintaining our global leadership position within the Functional Amines businesses.\n\nTaminco produces amines through the reaction of primary alcohols with ammonia. The products generated from this reaction are methylamines and higher amines, which can then be reacted with other chemicals, by both Taminco and its external customers, to produce alkylamine derivatives.\n\nTaminco’s Functional Amines and their derivatives serve as key building blocks in a broad array of chemical products with a wide range of applications.\n\nMarkets served include:\n\nAgrochemicals\n\nEnergy\n\nWater Treatment\n\nPersonal & Home Care\n\nAnimal Nutrition\n\nPharmaceuticals\n\nPaper\n\nSpecialty Amines\n\nThe Taminco Specialty Amines division comprises two business units where customer and market focus, and innovation are key pillars of our strategy, alongside operational and technical excellence.\n\nOur Specialty Intermediates unit provides amine-based building blocks typically used in markets such as Water Treatment, Personal and Home Care as well as some Specialty Additives (serving the pharma and metal working fluids industries). Here we sit within the value chain, providing intermediates to our customers who then create derivatives from these fundamental elements. As we are not an end market player ourselves, we consider our customers as partners for mutual success.\n\nOur Performance Products unit focuses on branded amine and formic acid-based products for specific end applications directly serving the energy and animal nutrition industry as well as some differentiated Formic Acid Solution markets (including de-icing and leather).\n\nMarkets served include:\n\nWater Treatment\n\nPersonal & Home Care\n\nPharmaceuticals\n\nMetal working fluids\n\nAnimal Nutrition\n\nEnergy\n\nDeicing\n\nLeather\n\nCrop Protection\n\nAs a result of growth in the world population, coupled with the growing scarcity of arable land per person and advances in the bio-engineering of crops, crop protection products are becoming increasingly important.\n\nThe Taminco Crop Protection business division produces alkylamine derivatives that are used directly in agricultural end markets. These products are designed to protect crops from soil borne pests and fungal diseases, and to increase yields.\n\nMarkets served:"
