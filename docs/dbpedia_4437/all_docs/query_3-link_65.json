        "text": "\"Umicore's new management also decided to eliminate human rights violations from our supply chain. We wanted to make sure that no forced or child labour had gone into the products we purchased. Over time, we created a Sustainable Procurement Charter. Our sourcing processes for controversial products like cobalt are now audited annually. The cobalt we buy is more expensive, but not contaminated.”\n\n“Unfortunately, there are still companies willing to turn a blind eye in order to buy cheaper cobalt. At Umicore we welcome the growing international demand for transparency: this will make it harder for buyers to ignore human rights issues. Setting clear standards on transparency and CSR will help European companies like ours stay competitive.\"\n\nSustainability strategy\n\nUmicore's sustainable sourcing strategy is part of a broader sustainability strategy called: 'Let's go for zero'. This strategy aims for zero greenhouse gas emissions, zero inequality and zero harm. It is underpinned by best-in-class government techniques, such as increased transparency and a new remuneration policy linked to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) targets.\n\n\"We have set our sights to zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2035,\" says Annelies Storme. \"There are interim milestones of minus 20% by 2025 and minus 50 %by 2030. On the equality front, we are aiming for gender equality in management as soon as possible. We need to have at least 35% women on our management teams by 2030. We also aim to increase the representation of non-Europeans. The pillar of zero harm relates not only to the safety and well-being of our employees, but also to our neighbours and the environment. We strive to minimize all our emissions: not only those of greenhouse gases, but also those of lead and cadmium, caused by the treatment of raw materials.\"\n\nNew targets\n\nCurrently, Umicore measures its sustainability progress against two key indicators. One is the proportion of materials of non-primary origin in products and services: this is well above 50%. Natalia Agüeros-Macario: \"We also monitor how much of our revenue comes from activities related to either clean mobility products or recycling services. That is now about 77%. In the coming years, we will add several new indicators to measure our impact.\"\n\n\"One of our biggest challenges in terms of transparency is that we are B2B: we make materials that go into other things. How do we properly determine the sustainability of our products without taking too much or too little credit for the end result? Ultimately, it's up to our customers to decide what to do with our products and how much sustainability they are willing to pay for.\""
