        "text": "143 colleagues climbed the Vosges mountains in France this weekend to support the Climbing 4 Life initiative. 58 hikers, 73 bike riders and 7 runners from different Umicore sites all came together for this charity event to support diabetes research and how sport can have a positive impact on our health. Join us in congratulating everyone who participated!\n\nIt doesn't matter if you are watching a film at home, scrolling your favorite apps or relaxing by the beach reading an e-book, our technology and advanced materials power all types of devices and even make your internet faster. You cannot see us but we are enable you to stay connected all summer long. #UmicoreSummer\n\nRegistrations are now open! Secure your spot today for the 3rd Umicore Catalysis Symposium so you don't miss out on this opportunity to connect with leading experts, exchange ideas, and explore the latest advancements in catalysis. Space is limited, so act fast to ensure you don't miss out on this invaluable experience. Join us as we shape the future of catalytic innovation together! Click the link below to register and check out our keynote and expert speakers: https://lnkd.in/eFqnS4V2 We can't wait to see you there! #UCS2024\n\nToday we celebrate #WorldHumanitarianDay by honoring the persistent efforts of the organizations that stand at the forefront of disaster relief, specially those that we have supported in the past months. üåç Doctors Without Borders has been providing emergency aid in Gaza, Sudan, and Haiti. In 2024, we supported their emergency fund that has saved countless lives and continues to do so amidst the most challenging conditions. üíô In April, we supported the Taiwan Disaster Relief Foundation. It responded quickly to the earthquake in Taiwan, demonstrating the power of solidarity and immediate action in times of need. üç≤ World Central Kitchen supported Ukraine by providing meals and comfort to those affected by the conflict. ü©∑ We also donated to the Red Cross, that has played a crucial role in providing assistance to those affected by earthquake in Morocco and the floods in Libya. Thank you to the organizations and the countless volunteers who remind us that together, we are stronger.\n\nWhether you are exploring nature, cycling through the city, or simply enjoying a walk, our Umicore materials are with you in every move. üèÉ‚ôÇÔ∏èüí® You cannot see us but we are in your favorite sneakers. So, tell us, how many steps will you make on your city trip this summer? #UmicoreSummer\n\nClimate change is a challenge beyond carbon dioxide. Methane is about 80 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. This has led to a global response, with 155 countries now committed to the Global Methane Pledge, with a target of a 30% reduction in global methane emissions by 2030. Our Coating Services provide high-quality precision optical filters, which is crucial for the early detection of atmospheric gases, especially methane. We therefore not only strive to minimise our own emissions, but also help our partners detect and reduce methane release from their operations. Find out more about our infrared filters at: eom.umicore.com\n\nA #platinum #plating of the #titanium components is necessary to increase the efficiency of #PEM #electrolyzers for #hydrogen production many times over. We are proud to be able to realize this deposition in a newly developed process with our established platinum #electrolytes that is #safe for humans and the environment. Find out how we are driving forward the energy transition with our #green and #cost-#optimized plating process for porous transport layers (#PTL) and bipolar plates (#BPL): https://lnkd.in/e3ps_2vb #umicore #MetalDepositionSolutions #Electroplating #letsGoForZero #H2\n\nUmicore is proud to partner with the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs Critical Materials Innovation Hub (CMI Hub). This collaboration advances our commitment to sustainable and secure supply chains for #CriticalMaterials essential to clean energy technologies. By contributing our expertise in critical materials recycling, we join forces with leading scientists and engineers to tackle critical materials challenges. Jeff Koch, Senior Commercial Manager, says, ‚ÄúThis partnership aligns perfectly with our goals of fostering innovation and sustainability.‚Äù Learn more: https://umico.re/ts4 #Sustainability #Innovation #CleanEnergy\n\nOn #YouthDay we celebrate the potential of young people around the world. üåç‚ú® Umicore is proud to support the next generation through our ongoing partnerships with organizations like UNICEF and SOS Children's villages. Our contributions help these organizations build robust education systems and provide vital support to youth worldwide. Our journey with UNICEF has led to transformative projects: from building and equipping sustainable classrooms in Madagascar and Haiti to empowering the youth in India with STEM education and the UPSHIFT innovation program. üìöAnd looking ahead, we're excited to support UNICEF's initiative to improve water and sanitation in Brazilian schools affected by river pollution. Since last year, we are also a proud supporter of SOS Children's villages, which empowered about 2.000 children by setting up strengthening programmes for families in the DRC. Every contribution we make is a commitment to making a difference, because every child deserves the chance to learn, grow, and thrive. #GivingBackToPeople"
