We’re here to support them in any way we can. Because zero isn’t just a number to us. It’s an ambition. A work in progress. Something that reminds us that whatever we do, we do it with conviction. Pride. Responsibility. Know-how. Leading as one. If anything, our company culture is the key to our success.\n\nNo injury, no excess exposure\n\nHealth and safety first, everything else comes second. At Umicore, we aim for zero work-related injuries and safeguard the wellbeing and vitality of our employees by establishing a positive, inclusive, connected and empowering caring culture.\n\nTarget\n\nNo injury, no excess exposure\n\nWellbeing\n\nWe care. We take care – of ourselves and each other. Because you can’t have personal, let alone collective growth without a healthy organization. At Umicore, we promote our people's professional, physical, mental and social wellbeing through transparency, employee engagement and prevention programs and regular assessments.\n\nTarget\n\nZero work-related adverse health effects\n\nEnvironment\n\nWe’re a global company with a worldwide footprint. And we’re still growing – but that doesn’t mean our footprint continues to grow. On the contrary, we’re determined to reduce the impact of our operations wherever possible, pushing our limits to find innovative ways to protect land, water and air. We’re talking diffuse emission reductions, water & resource efficiency and good neighbor policies/continuing to be a good neighbor at all our facilities."
