        "text": "On Thursday, April 25, members of the Umicore Battery Materials Canada, travelled to Toronto to participate in the Belgian Canadian Business Chamber (BCBC) Excellence Awards Gala. Also in attendance as guests, were representatives of AESC, delegates from the County of Lennox & Addington, Loyalist Township, Kingston Economic Development, and Indigenous Relations consultants, First Peoples Group.\n\nHeld at the Art Gallery of Ontario, with a stunning view of the CN Tower, the event hosted a wide variety of Belgian and Canadian businesses, as well as members of the Canadian provincial and federal government, and His Excellency Patrick Van Gheel, Ambassador of the Kingdom of Belgium to Canada.\n\nPlanned around the theme of artistry and innovation, with a Belgian-inspired gourmet meal, the event included networking and entertainment showcasing the history of Belgian and Canadian inventions. The event also recognized and honoured businesses, and business leaders, who have made significant contributions to the economic health of the Belgian-Canadian business community in the last year.\n\nDuring the awards ceremony, the 2024 Belgian Business of the Year in Canada was awarded to Umicore Battery Materials Canada. The award recognizes a Belgian company in Canada that has made significant contributions to the economic health of the community; from sustainability and community service, to business growth and sound or innovative business practices.\n\nJust over a year ago, the first Umicore Battery Materials employee started in Canada. The new facility, located west of Kingston in Loyalist Township, will combine large-scale cathode and precursor materials manufacturing in one site. This first-of-its-kind site in North America, will be a critical part of the EV supply chain, supporting a low-carbon future and bringing environmentally sustainable economic growth to the region.\n\nOn behalf of the team in Loyalist, Managing Director of Umicore Battery Materials in Canada, Randy de Palma, accepted the award. In his acceptance speech, he noted that what is being built in Loyalist, is more than just an EV materials facility."
