        "text": "At the turn of the century, Umicore was a mining company far from being sustainable – a business of extracting finite resources from the ground combined with high CO2 intensity. Today, Umicore pivoted to take the wind from behind: it became a truly innovative technology firm operating at the frontier of metallurgy, chemistry and materials science, leader in clean mobility and recycling, which together represent more than 75% of its revenue. Umicore transitioned from being a sustainability laggard, exposed and with limited long-term growth prospects to a true sustainability champion, a front-runner in the mining and materials industry paving the way to reinvent the way we use finite resources.\n\nCase clearing houses\n\nIMD case studies are distributed through case clearing houses.
