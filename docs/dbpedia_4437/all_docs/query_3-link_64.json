        "text": "Reuters\n\nUpdated On Oct 15, 2021 at 09:23 PM IST\n\nRead by: 100 Industry Professionals\n\nRead by 100 Industry Professionals\n\nBelgian materials technology and recycling group Umicore on Friday signed long-term lithium supply deals with Ganfeng Lithium Co Ltd and Vulcan Energy Resources, expanding its capabilities to supply the metal as demand for electric-vehicle batteries has been rising.\n\nLithium is needed in the production of cathode materials used in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles.\n\n\"With the transitioning to electromobility accelerating in key regions, these long-term agreements will provide Umicore with additional sustainable and regional supply of this key raw material to meet the growing demand for cathode materials of its global automotive customers,\" Umicore said in a statement.\n\nAdvt\n\nUmicore said both contracts are for five years and can be extended upon mutual agreement.\n\nThe deal with China's Ganfeng concerns the supply of lithium starting 2022 and will cover a significant part of Umicore's lithium requirements in Asia, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe agreement with German-Australian lithium miner Vulcan will take effect as of 2025. It will cover part of Umicore's lithium hydroxide needs in Europe, allowing it to buy between 28,000 tons and 42,000 tons over the duration of the contract.\n\nVulcan has previously signed deals to supply lithium to automakers including Renault SA and Stellantis NV.\n\nJoin the community of 2M+ industry professionals\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.\n\nDownload ETAuto App\n\nGet Realtime updates\n\nSave your favourite articles"
