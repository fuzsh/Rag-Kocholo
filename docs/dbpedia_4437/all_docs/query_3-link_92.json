        "text": "Reuters\n\nUpdated On Dec 8, 2021 at 04:48 PM IST\n\nRead by: 100 Industry Professionals\n\nRead by 100 Industry Professionals\n\nBelgian chemicals and recycling company Umicore cut its outlook for the second time in three months on Wednesday by saying its 2022 and 2023 cathode materials sales would be below expectations, sending its shares down as much as 8%.\n\nThe company also said it planned to set up a joint venture to supply Volkswagen's battery cell production as the German carmaker ramps up electric vehicle production.\n\nBut that announcement failed to offset concerns about another cut to its forecasts for cathode materials sales volumes, which it said would grow less than expected and would fail to keep pace with global market growth.\n\nAdvt\n\nUmicore shares dropped almost 8% to their lowest price since late March. They were down about 4.7% at 42.73 euros by 0924 GMT.\n\nFaced with continued chip shortages and supply chain pressures, Umicore's clients are scaling back demand, resulting in lower volumes over the period and beyond the negative volume impacts from semiconductor shortages, the company said.\n\nThe company said it could see lower-than-expected earnings growth in the rechargeable battery materials unit because of the reduced expectations paired with rising costs to prepare for expected steep mid-term growth.\n\nIn October, Umicore lowered its cathode materials sales forecast, citing demand adjustments in electric vehicle production, and cut its 2021 profit outlook because of the global semiconductor shortage and lower prices for platinum group metals.\n\nThe company said it did not expect any \"significant uplift\" in its energy and surface technologies business (EST), assuming its cobalt and specialty materials did not repeat its 2021 performance, when it was helped by climbing demand, greater availability of supplies and rising prices.\n\n\"We're not excluding growth, it's just that because of looking at the consensus expectations, we thought it was a right thing to do to guide you to that reality,\" Umicore's chief financial Filip Platteeuw told a call with analysts.\n\nBefore the warning, the consensus was for EST earnings to 2023 to grow 88%, Credit Suisse analysts told clients in a note.\n\nAdvt\n\nJefferies said it was concerned about risks to other customer relationships from the announcement of the venture with Volkswagen and about returns from the venture deal.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nVolkswagen secures raw materials as part of $34 billion battery push\n\nAt the core of the three agreements, which are part of VW's 30 billion euro ($34 billion) plan to build battery plants and procure materials, lies a planned joint venture with Belgian chemicals and recycling company Umicore.\n\nGM partners with POSCO to build NA battery materials plant\n\nThe move comes as GM is ramping up electric-vehicle production and vowing to shift more of its supply chain to North America. GM did not disclose the planned investment or size of the facility but said it could announce a location in early 2022.\n\nJoin the community of 2M+ industry professionals\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.\n\nDownload ETAuto App\n\nGet Realtime updates\n\nSave your favourite articles"
