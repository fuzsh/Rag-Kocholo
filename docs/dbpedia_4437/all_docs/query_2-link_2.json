        "text": "We deliver custom made consumer and companies list in Excel. Get started in just three simple steps:\n\n1. Tell us which countries you want to target Chemical Companies\n\nOur data experts take the time to understand your business, target group and campaign. Based on these insights we create a highly targeted business email list based on more than 1500 criteria. From country and number of employees to industry type and job title.\n\n2. Receive a free count and quote\n\nYou receive a free quote and a detailed count of your business database within 24 hours. On request we can provide a free sample with a selection of 10 contacts. Based on your feedback we polish the companies list to perfection.\n\n3. Delivery list of\n\nChemical Companies in Belgium within 24 hours\n\nSatisfied? Then we deliver the custom-made companies list in Excel within 24 hours.\n\nThis a DDMA accreditated, premium companies list which is continuously updated by various sources such as the local Chamber of Commerce, D&B, phone books, directories, Statbel and numerous public sources.\n\nKruispunt: The Crossroads Bank for Enterprises (CBE) is a Belgian federal institution (in French: Banque-Carrefour des Entreprises) within the federal public service FPS Economy. The Crossroads Bank manages the official database of the Belgian government of all natural persons who carry out an economic activity, and of legal persons that are active or not economically active in Belgium (companies, non-profit associations (non-profit organisations), associations of co-owners (VMEs) and so forth). The term enterprise must therefore be interpreted here in a very broad sense.\n\nStatbel: Statistics Belgium conducts surveys among households and enterprises in Belgium. It uses and processes existing administrative databases (the national register) and provides data to Belgian and international authorities and organisations. Third parties may also call on its statistical expertise. Statistics Belgium is also the official representative of Belgium to international organisations such as Eurostat and OECD. Sets of figures, press releases and studies are published on its website, Statbel. Moreover, a number of databases can be queried through the online application be.STAT.\n\nD&B: Dun & Bradstreet – often shortened to D&B – is the market leader in providing global business information. Dun & Bradstreet’s services are based on the largest B-to-B database of any kind in the world, providing business information to more than 300 million companies in over 240 countries. Dun & Bradstreet has been providing its customers with tools and expert advice for making reliable business credit, marketing and purchasing decisions for more than 165 years.\n\nAside from the above three sources of data that feed BoldData UK Database, the following are also used:\n\nCredit and Risk Data: received from D&B\n\nCCJ Data: received from the Registry’s Trust who obtain it directly from the courts.\n\nNational Canvasse/Editorial Electoral Roll: helps identification of Small- and Home Office records.\n\nDirect Marketing Association: Files from the preference services that are used to suppress non-marketable data.\n\nMortgage Data: information on mortgages and charges lodged and receiverships appointed.\n\nDirectors Service Address Information: obtained from Annual Returns from Companies House\n\nAt BoldData, we’re working around the clock to keep our data updates and verified at the highest levels in the data-industry. All our lists have been checked on an ongoing basis. Nevertheless keep in mind that in the world today, people are constantly changing jobs and/or positions, and companies may move and change their telephone numbers, names, websites, or email addresses. Therefore it is impossible to reach 100% accuracy. Keep in mind a small error rate with our custom lists."
