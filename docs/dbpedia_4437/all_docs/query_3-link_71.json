        "text": "In order to thoroughly explore RPA technology and its opportunities, Umicore launched an RPA center of expertise as its first step toward robotics, choosing UiPath as the preferred RPA platform. “We were confident that RPA would quickly deliver business benefits,” Joris Peeters, Director Business Applications IT, begins. “The best way to achieve those benefits was by setting up pilot projects in domains where we expect quick ROI, like treasury, audit, tax and accounting, in addition to purchasing and IT administration.”\n\nPayback time: 3 to 9 months\n\n“The challenge with projects for finance is that, for us finance teams, the ROI is always top of mind,” admits Koen Van Impe, Global Process Owner Finance. “RPA is a perfect fit, as you can begin with a minimal start-up investment and constantly scale up with new products and robots. Typically, the payback time for an RPA project is around three to nine months. Next to ROI though, data quality has also been a major driver to prioritize cases.”\n\n“However, that’s only true if your processes match with RPA,” Joris adds. “Launching an RPA project just because you want to try RPA is not the right way. Start with the business case: what are the challenges the finance team is facing, what are the processes that need improvement and what processes and workflows are good candidates for RPA. When a process needs reengineering or improving, RPA is often only one of – or part of – the potential solutions.”\n\nHuman and machine working together\n\n“Robotic systems are ideal stand-ins for people in these cases,” continues Joris. “They are available 24/7 and don’t lose focus, no matter how long they’ve been working.” Koen: “Of course, that sounds quite harsh for people. Some employees were afraid that RPA would take away jobs rather than reducing work. But it is absolutely not our aim to replace people. By eliminating repetitive, error-prone activities, RPA frees up the time of our finance teams to do more interesting, value-added work.”\n\n“Cross-checking vendor invoices to detect double invoices, for example, is to a large extent, covered by ERP logic, but some cases slip through the embedded controls. By combining RPA with fuzzy logic algorithms, we are able to identify and report suspected duplicate invoices to the A/P accountants. Even if the cases discovered remain exceptions, it’s still a lot of money and it directly impacts the cash flow and P&L. The ROI of this use case is significant, as the solution can also be applied to historical data.”\n\ndelaware as an expert partner\n\ndelaware has been the implementation partner since the early days of RPA at Umicore. Two FTEs are helping the in-house team build and run the RPA technology. “Every use case is a co-development activity,” says Koen. “In addition, we get together every two weeks to discuss the pipeline and progress of RPA cases and discuss possibilities in the future.”\n\nLooking back on 25 successful use cases and with many more in the pipe, Umicore believes in the benefits of RPA. “The power of RPA has been demonstrated. We already started capitalizing on our RPA investments. From now on, every new project helps us further raise (cost) efficiencies and boost our bottom line,” Joris concludes. “By increasingly combining RPA technology with other digital technologies like Webscraping, OCR, artificial intelligence, fuzzy logic, etc. we’ll be able to add even more value in the future.”\n\nInspired?
