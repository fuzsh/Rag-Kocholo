        "text": "In my search for a ball cleaner I can buy at the auto/hardware store I came here for answers and noticed several posts about ball cleaning. Some say wax em others say never wax em. Some say windex others say no it has solvents. I saw a poster using a magic eraser. Someone else said not to use it because its abrasive. Funny thing is at least one person who says one of the following: no wax or no solvents or no abrasives will tell you to use the Aramith ball cleaner. Having worked in a cleanroom laboratory environment and dealing with chemicals this sounded like a contradiction to me so I found the MSDS (material safety data sheet) for the aramith ball cleaner and guess what folks... it contains wax, solvents and abrasives. Here is a c/p from the MSDS:\n\nBALL CLEANER 3.1 Version: 2\n\n30-10-99\n\nDate of issue : 30 th Oct 1999 Page 1 of 4\n\n1.

Happ controls has it on file.\n\nHope this clears up some of the hooplah surrounding the ball cleaning topic.\n\nPool Shark420\n\nLMAO...thank for the truth...finally. Maybe the put that stuff in there so you have to buy a new set of balls quicker.\n\nA lot of companies do things like that. I worked in the thread rolling dept of a leading electrical parts compay. Their wall sockets are everywhere. I got called up to the head of the R&D dept one day shortly after I was hired. It seemed the diamond knurl rivets I was making were .0005 too big in diam. and the knurls were too sharp. I had made the part 100's of times before at other shops and never really looked at the hand drawn print they had at this place. I knew what the specs were supose to be. Aparently the ones I was making didn't wear out and the wall socket would last forever. I was told to back off on the diam. to their print. Of couase being the hot-head know it all that I was, I kept making them my way, to the national specs. And for my next job.....Johnnyt\n\nYou all understand that balls are made of plastic right? Phenolic Resin\n\nThe exact formula and process is a trade secret but essentially balls are made by pouring liquid plastic into a cast and baking them at the right temperature to \"cure\" them. Then when the cast is remove they are turned to make them completely round. Balls are not exactly 6oz. A set can vary as much as .2oz over or under 6oz. To get a premium set of matched balls the ball company has to select from many finished balls. The closer in spec to each other that the balls are means that the more time was taken to find 16 balls that match in weight and roundness - more time equals more cost and a higher price.\n\nAs for cleaning them there are tons of ways to do it and some ways leave the balls ultra slick while others leave the balls dull. The best way I have ever seen in my travels is in Taiwan where the attendants in the pool room gather all the balls together in a piece of pool table cloth or a towel and spray or squirt some polish (like Pledge) on them, wrap the towel into a bag of sorts and then vigorous swing this from side to side. This is a highly skilled endeavor that could come in handy in a fight. When they are done they unwrap the towel and have 16 clean and shiny balls. They do this every time a session is done and sometimes even when the session has gone on for several hours.\n\nI have not chimed in on this topic before so, for what it's worth, here are my thoughts:\n\nTo clean the balls you need to have some solvents. These solvents should not harm the structure of the balls, just clean off the crap.\n\nTo polish the balls you must have some abrasive. These should be extremely fine abrasives so as not to \"wear down\" the balls prematurely.\n\nFor older worn balls that will not polish well due to scratches and such, you need a wax to provide as smooth slick surface.\n\nBasically, all we are trying to do is make the balls play like they are new again.\n\nWhy not just use the polish that is recommended by the ball making company themselves?\n\nI recommend the Aramath Ball Cleaner!\n\nRoyce Bunnell\n\nwww.obcues.com\n\nI totally agee with Royce. I use it regularly and as a result, my set of Super Aramith Pro balls look and play like brand new. :thumbup2:\n\ncheck this out.\n\nWPA Equipment Specs:\n\n16. Balls and Ball Rack\n\nAll balls must be composed of cast phenolic resin plastic and measure 2 ¼ (+.005) inches [5.715 cm (+ .127 mm)] in diameter and weigh 5 ½ to 6 oz [156 to 170 gms]. Balls should be unpolished, and should also not be waxed. Balls should be cleaned with a towel or cloth free of dirt and dust, and may also be washed with soap and water. Balls contaminated with any slippery substance - treated with a polishing or rubbing compound and/or waxed - must be cleansed and dewaxed with a clean cloth moistened with diluted alcohol before play.\n\nI usually use denatured alcohol and no wax. Cleans them well.\n\nVinnie,\n\nThat is great!\n\nThe only problem is that under those rules, as soon as the balls stop playing like they should, and you can't get it back by just cleaning them, then they should be replaced.\n\nI would love that, but I don't know many rooms who are going to want to buy 2 sets of balls per table per year.\n\nThe cleaners and waxes are there to help dirty or worn balls play like they are new. Lets face it, I don't care what it looks like, I just want it to play like it did when it was new!\n\nRoyce Bunnell\n\nwww.obcues.com"
