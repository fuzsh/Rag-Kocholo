        "text": "Antwerp manufactures products for a wide variety of applications. The Belgian site produces among others raw materials for the production of silicones for the electronics and communications industry in addition to binding agents for printing inks, paints and coatings, and raw materials for car tires.\n\nThe production site in Antwerp is distinguished by its excellent infrastructure with a port that provides a logistic advantage for the site, as well as the good connections by road and rail. It is the base of more than 1000 Evonik employees that make a difference every day.\n\nBelgium is the sixth most densely populated country in Europe with a population of over eleven million people living on thirty thousand square meters of land, and it is divided into three regions: the Flemish, the Walloon, and the Brussels-Capital Region. Belgium got its independence from the Netherlands following the Belgian revolution in 1830, and it was one of the founding six countries of the European Union (EU).\n\nAntwerp is the largest city in Belgium in terms of area and the second largest in terms of population after Brussels. It is only forty kilometers north of Brussels and has one of the biggest ports in the world, the Port of Antwerp-Bruges.\n\nIn the Antwerp skyline the Cathedral of Our Lady, which is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, proudly takes its place. A little further on, the MAS stands out: in this “Museum aan de Stroom” perhaps the most beautiful work of art is the view. From its 60-meter-high roof you can admire the entire city. The port of Antwerp-Bruges is the largest storage port of cocoa beans in the world. All major Belgian chocolate brands can be found in Antwerp, as well as artisan chocolatiers who make heavenly creations. Beer lovers will also find plenty to enjoy in Antwerp. “Bolleke” is the Antwerp beer and an icon of the city.\n\nDo you think that you may be the right candidate to complement our team? We are always in search of great people like you! Evonik offers many benefits, including work-from-home possibilities and a dynamic international environment.
