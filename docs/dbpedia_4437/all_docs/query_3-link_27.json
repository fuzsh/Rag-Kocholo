        "text": "Impact and dependencies assessment\n\nUmicore has not holistically assessed its impacts or how it depends on nature, including biodiversity. It has an opportunity to start such an assessment across its value chains, focused on quantification of its impacts or dependencies.\n\nKey areas and species\n\nUmicore does not disclose key species or areas important for biodiversity affected by its operations or suppliers. It has an opportunity to increase its transparency.\n\nEcosystem conversion and restoration\n\nNo evidence was found regarding Umicore’s efforts to avoid ecosystem conversion, including deforestation, or promote restoration. The company has an opportunity to develop a strategy and publicly report on specific, time-bound targets.\n\nResource exploitation and circularity\n\nNo evidence was found regarding the Umicore’s efforts to work towards a circular economy or which organisms it exploits. The company has an opportunity to develop a strategy and publicly report on specific, time-bound targets. The company provides qualitative evidence on improving soil health and of remediating soil contamination in historical activities. The company also provides evidence of conducting soil investigation and implementing other practices on soil health. The company does not disclose a target to improve soil health in its production or sourcing practices.\n\nWater\n\nWhile the Umicore discloses its 2021 figures for water withdrawal, no evidence of comparable water withdrawal figures from previous reporting years could be found in the public domain. While the company has a target to “substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater” by 2030, no evidence of a time-bound target specifically focused on reducing water withdrawals, or the reporting of progress against such a target could be found in the public domain. The company does not report how much water is withdrawn for its own operations in water-stressed areas. The company does not engage with suppliers to reduce water withdrawal. The company provides qualitative evidence of reducing water quality pressures. In particular the case of ground water pollution in Brazil. The company does not disclose its processes for managing and monitoring discharge water quality. The company reports regularly on water quality parameters and provides evidence of its total metal emissions to water over a 5-year period. The company does not disclose targets to reduce water pollution. The company does not disclose a commitment to respect the right to water. The company does not disclose its processes for implementing preventive and corrective action plans for identified specific risks to the right to water and sanitation in its own operations.\n\nSolid and air pollution\n\nNo evidence that Umicore reduces the production of hazardous substances was found. The company does not disclose a commitment to avoid developing or marketing new chemicals or products with SVHC (substance of very high concern) properties. The company provides quantitative evidence of reducing the production of hazardous waste. No evidence that the company reduces plastic use and waste in its own operations was found. The company does not report on the amount of plastic waste generated and proportions directed from or to disposal. The company reports regularly on air quality parameters on relevant pollutants identified in relevant regulations and as harmful air pollutants by international bodies. The company does not report time-bound targets to reduce air pollutants across the most material parts of its value chain.\n\nGHG emissions\n\nNo evidence that Umicore reduces its scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions was found. The company has a time-bound target to reduce its scope 1 and 2 emissions. While the company has a time-bound target to reduce its scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, no evidence of a reduction in the company’s GHG emissions in 2021 could be found in the public domain. No evidence that the companyâs scope 1 and 2 emissions target is aligned with a 1.5-degree trajectory was found. While the company discloses its scope 3 emissions figures via a preliminary study on its 2018 upstream scope 3 footprint, no evidence that the company discloses quantitative reductions for its scope 3 emissions could be found in the public domain. While the company has a target to reduce scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, it does not report reductions. The company does not report progress against its scope 3 emissions target. No evidence that the companyâs scope 3 emissions target is aligned with a 1.5-degree trajectory was found.\n\nInvasive species\n\nUmicore has not identified any activities that could lead to the introduction of invasive alien species in its own operations."
