        "text": "Cefic proposes 6 actions to modernise EU legislation on drug precursors\n\n12/07/2024\n\nThe chemical industry is committed to safe, secure, responsible, and sustainable production and use of chemicals. Therefore, any misuse of chemicals towards the production and trade of illegal drugs, is unacceptable and needs to be effectively combatted. The arrival on the market of so-called designer-precursors in the past 10-15 years represents a new challenge to…\n\nTransition Pathway for the EU Chemicals Industry – State of Play of the Inclusive Approach Towards a Green and Digital Chemical Industry\n\n11/07/2024\n\nThe co-implementation process for the Transition Pathway of the EU chemical industry is in progress. The Transition Pathway for the Chemical Industry, launched by the European Commission in January 2023, aims to be the industry’s compass for navigating through the ‘double-twin transition’ – guiding us toward climate neutrality, circularity, digitalisation, and the production of safe-and-sustainable…\n\nThis year we will highlight projects and initiatives that are shaping the future of the chemical industry in Europe.\n\nEuropean Responsible Care® Awards 2024\n\nOver five categories, the spotlight will be given to leading organisations who are seen as driving forward the EU chemicals industry in championing the ambitions outlined in the declaration. All valid submissions will be recognised. The application is now closed and winners will be disclosed in Q4. Stay tuned !\n\nDiscover Cefic low-carbon technologies projects map\n\nLow Carbon Project Map\n\nAs highlighted in the EU Chemical industry Transition Pathway recently published by the European Commission, the chemical sector is heading towards the biggest transformation in its history. A transformation covering four different dimensions, as we go climate neutral, circular, digital while transitioning to safe and sustainable chemicals. A new interactive and customizable map shows planned and ongoing projects and investments in low-carbon technologies made by the EU chemical manufacturers. You will be able to explore the activities across different European countries and across a broad range of technologies.\n\nThe EU Chemical Industry Transition Pathway !\n\nEU Transition Pathway\n\nOur industry thanks the European Commission for co-developing this first-of-a-kind roadmap for an energy-intensive industry like ours, which aims to provide the business case for investing in Europe as well as offering clarity and direction towards achieving European Green Deal goals. We now need the Transition Pathway actions to be implemented, and national Transition Plans developed across EU Member States. Will you be part of our transformation journey?\n\nFacts and Figures of the European Chemical Industry\n\nA Pillar of the European Economy\n\nWith over 1.2 million workers, €760 billion turnover and €11 billion R&I investments, the European chemical industry is a wealth generating sector of the economy and a major contributor to building a sustainable future for Europe.\n\nEconomic Analysis of business impacts of the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability\n\nChemicals Strategy for Sustainability\n\nThe upcoming EU chemicals legislation puts Europe’s chemical industry at crucial crossroads. The intended policy changes will also create a significant “ripple effect” across many value chains relying on chemicals. To help inform future policy development, Cefic commissioned an independent economic analysis of business impacts of selected actions proposed under the EU Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability.\n\nBe part of a movement to accelerate chemical innovations!\n\nFuture Chemistry Network\n\nBeing part of a movement to raise awareness of the latest developments, help promote stronger markets here in the EU for sustainable chemistry, and to accelerate chemical innovations which are safe and sustainable-by-design. Together we can demonstrate Europe’s potential to become a leader in sustainable chemistry.\n\nThe Landscape Of The European Chemical Industry\n\nA Pillar of the European Economy\n\nTo help those keen to acquire an accurate picture of the industry, what it does, where, and why. We have produced the \"Landscape of the European Chemical Industry\", providing a regional overview and country-by-country snapshots, the challenges it faces and our ambitions for the future. The forces that shape its locations, challenges and solutions are as complex as many of its formulas."
