It delves into the regulatory landscape, spotlighting key objectives and targets for circularity and recycling. Through the presentation of three concrete business cases from European pioneer companies working on recycling, reuse and digital product passports, and a research point of view, it aims to illuminate success stories, while also offering a reality check on the practical applications of the set objectives. Slidedeck coming soon.\n\nDuring the panel discussion, speakers and audience will explore some of the most imminent dilemmas and discuss key challenges in terms of technological developments, environmental and social aspects, policy coherence, trade concerns and financial viability of circular battery business models throughout the battery value chain.\n\nEU Batteries Regulation, Rana Pant, DG ENV\n\nAddressing Circular Economy and Sustainability of batteries and their value chain, Marcel Weil, KIT\n\nInnovation in battery recycling, Justo Garcia, Orano\n\nThe challenges of repurposing of batteries, Catherine Lenaerts, Watt4Ever\n\nPiloting the battery passport in practice, Jyri Arponen, Sitra\n\nLife cycle assessment research for circular batteries, Daniele Costa, VITO\n\nModerator: Fabrice Stassin, Umicore/BEPA\n\nreport\n\nTowards a Circular Built Environment using Bio-Based and Reclaimed materials\n\nThis session will take construction professionals through the learnings of European projects on improving the building process and design principles to drive the uptake of reclamation and reuse of building materials and components. Another challenge is the difficulty for biobased construction materials to be seen as equivalent for customary materials.
