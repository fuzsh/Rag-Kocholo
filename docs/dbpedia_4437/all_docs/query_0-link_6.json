        "text": "July lithium exports at lowest level since March this year Lithium exports during the year to July rose 25.3% to 158,306 mt Shipments of copper concentrates rose 25% to 7.9 million mt through July Chilean exports of lithium fell in July to their lowest level in five months as producers adjust to slowing demand and falling prices, customs data showed Aug 12. Chile exported 21,821 mt of lithium in July, down 4.5% from the previous month and a peak of 28,770 mt in April. Producers Albemarle and SQM have ramped production in recent years to meet rapidly growing demand from the electric vehicles industry. Production during the first seven months totaled 158,306 mt, up 25.3% from the same period of last year. The rise was driven by a 57.2% increase in shipments to China to 116,069 mt, representing almost 75% of total shipments during the period. However, despite the rise in volumes, the value of Chile’s lithium exports have fallen by around half during the same period to $2.0 billion as prices slumped as much as 80% from the peaks reached in late 2022. Calculated by export volumes and values, Chilean lithium fetched an average price of just $10.40/kg in July, down from $20/kg in January and its lowest in several years. Exports of copper concentrates reached 7.9 million mt (total weight) in the first seven months of the year, up 24.9% from the same period of 2023. The rise was driven by increased shipments to the three main buyers: China, Japan and South Korea. Shipments to China rose 15.8% to 5.4 million mt, representing more than two-thirds of the total Shipments of refined copper fell 12.3% over the same period to 1.3 million mt. Shipments to China fell 9.9% to 422,678 mt while shipments to South Korea 8.7% to 122,651 mt.

Over the first half of 2024, global sales of BEVs rose 11% year on year, slowing down from 35% in 2023 and 78% in 2022, all on a year-on-year basis, according to a report from the Macquarie Group. By comparison, H1 sales of PHEVs shot up 44% from the year before, similar to growth rates of 45% in 2023 and 32% in 2022. \"The share of plug-in hybrids in total sales at 35% is the highest since 2017,\" Macquarie Group said, as PHEV sales head toward making up half of overall Chinese vehicle sales. H1 2024 PHEV sales accounted for 41% of all Chinese sales compared with 32% the year before. \"The move back towards PHEVs mainly reflects strong growth in Chinese \"range extender\" cars, where the internal combustion engine vehicle is used solely to recharge the battery and not drive the vehicle's wheels,\" it said. Typically, HEVs combine a gasoline-powered motor with an electric hybrid battery excluding a charging socket. PHEVs are similar to HEVs but have bigger batteries, offering more distance on solely electric power. EU, US embrace HEVs In Europe, the emphasis centered on HEVs instead of PHEVs, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) showed. In H1 2024, new registrations of HEVs were up 22.3% from the corresponding six months of 2023 at 1.66 million units while those of PHEVs slipped 2.5% year on year to 392,284 units. As such, HEVs were the leading choice among EV types in the EU over H1, followed by BEVs at 712,637 units and PHEVs at 392,284 units. Similarly, over in the US, despite a slowdown in its own EV market, HEVs accounted for a leading share of electric-drive vehicle sales in H1 2024 at about 0.71 million units against BEVs of 0.55 million units, data from Argonne National Laboratory showed. Compared with H1 2023, HEV sales in the corresponding period of 2024 were up 34% from 0.53 million units while BEV sales rose 1.9% from 0.54 million units. S&P Global Mobility sales-based powertrain forecast expects HEVs to have a larger role in US light-vehicle sales, reaching about a 20% share in 2031. HEVs play transitionary role Japan's Toyota Motor Corp., a leader the HEV market sales, saw its H1 2024 sales of HEVs rise 19.8% to 1.92 million units while its PHEV sales shot up 35.2% to 72,668 units. Of Toyota's HEV sales, 1.5 million units were sold outside of Japan, or about 78.4% of the overall sales. Toyota's overseas HEV sales alone were up 32.7% against H1 2023. In June 2024 alone, Toyota accounted for a 51.1% share of total HEV sales in the US. Toyota is among several global automakers who have positioned HEVs as a transitional replacement for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. In countries where the buildup of EV rapid-charging infrastructure is challenging, HEVs are a promising stopgap measure. In Southeast Asia, Thailand temporarily lowered an excise tax rate for HEVs on July 26. The reduced rate will be effective 2028-2032 and will apply to HEVs of no more than 10 seats. To qualify for the cut, automakers must make new investments in Thailand of not less than Baht 3 billion ($84.81 million) between 2024 and 2027, subject to approval by the Thailand Board of Investment. EV battery costs have plunged amid slowing demand for EVs, a glut of battery metals and tariffs on Chinese EVs. Already, the cost for battery components such as lithium plunged over 2023 till to date, resulting in cheaper batteries and lowering the overall cost of an EV. Typically, batteries can account for as much a third of an EV's cost. At the start of 2023, lithium carbonate prices stood at $75,000/mt CIF North Asia, close to an all-time peak of $78,200/mt on Nov. 29, 2022, data from S&P Global Commodity Insights showed. Likewise, lithium hydroxide began 2023 at $81,300/mt CIF North Asia, down from an all-time high of 84,700/mt on Nov. 25, 2022. On Aug. 8, lithium carbonate stood at $12,000/mt while lithium hydroxide was $11,500/mt, resulting in plunges of 84% and 85.9%, respectively, compared with the start of 2023. Platts Connect: News & Insights (spglobal.com)\n\nEV sales hit record despite on-month decline in July Outlook on China’s lithium carbonate market remains gloomy China’s new energy vehicle sales reached a record in July despite posting a month-on-month decline, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said Aug. 9. EV sales accounted for 43.8% of the country’s total vehicle sales in July, an all-time high, S&P Global Commodity Insights calculations based on CAAM data showed. CAAM considers pure and hybrid EVs as new energy vehicles. China’s total vehicle sales fell 11.4% from a month earlier and 5.2% year on year in July amid slower seasonal demand, CAAM data showed. EV sales have remained elevated amid the country’s efforts to develop the industry while other supporting measures aimed at boosting sales have also helped the EV industry, industry sources said. China's EV sales reached 991,000 units in July, down 5.5% on the month, CAAM data showed. EV production hit 984,000 units in July, 1.9% lower than the previous month. Despite the decline on monthly basis, EV output and sales in July posted a year-on-year increase of 22.3% and 27%, respectively. China’s total EV output and sales reached 5.91 million and 5.93 million units in the first seven months of 2024, up 28.8% and 31.1%, respectively, over the year-ago period, CAAM data showed. The National Development and Reform Commission in July announced sales of ultra-long special treasury bonds, aimed at boosting large-scale equipment renewals and replacing old consumer goods with new ones. These new measures were expected to boost domestic EV sales in the second half of this year, sources said. Meanwhile, China’s EV exports reached 103,000 units in July, up 20.6% from a month ago and 2.2% higher from a year earlier, CAAM data showed. China’s passenger vehicle exports are expected to grow steadily in August despite some hurdles, the China Passenger Car Association said recently. Power battery output China’s output of power battery and other battery, a key indicator of battery metals consumption, reached a total of 91.8 GWh in July, up 8.6% month on month and 33.1% year on year, according to data from the China Automobile Battery Innovation Alliance. Nickel-cobalt-manganese material used by power battery and other batteries totaled 40,000 metric tons in July, up 11.1% from a month ago, CABIA data showed. Lithium iron phosphate materials consumed 162,000 t during the same period, up 7.3% month on month. Lithium salts prices China’s lithium salts market is expected to remain on a downward trajectory, despite recently-announced measures to boost sales, according to sources. Lithium salts are key ingredients needed to produce lithium-ion batteries used in EVs. In view of the expected supply surplus of both lithium ore and salt, any rebound in domestic lithium salt prices would be limited even if downstream demand improves to an extent, sources said. Platts assessed battery-grade lithium carbonate at Yuan 79,000/t ($11,016/t) on a DDP China basis on Aug. 8, down Yuan 10,500/t on the month, falling below the mark of Yuan 80,000/t since Aug. 1, Commodity Insights data showed.

The planned facility will be an advancement from the successful direct lithium extraction pilot program conducted in 2023, E3 said in a statement, adding the company operated and evaluated multiple technologies, showcasing the technical feasibility of DLE technology including its own proprietary DLE. The 2023 pilot provided critical data used in the recently released prefeasibility study validating the economic feasibility of lithium projects in Alberta, it said. The demonstration project will operate a full-integrated process that will include an increase in the scale of the DLE system and add into the processes for the purification, concentration and chemical conversion to continually process brine into battery grade lithium carbonate, the E3 statement said, noting additional hydroxide development will be conducted offsite. The objectives of the project are to unify the necessary components onsite into a fully integrated process replicating a commercial system. This will provide real-time data while the company continues to design a commercial system through advanced engineering. It will also provide samples for commercial discussions with potential strategic partners, it said. The project will enable E3 to continually optimize and de-risk each step of the flowsheet as it moves toward completing its feasibility study, it said without indicating a timeline. In August 2023, E3 said it had produced the first lithium carbonate from its resources in Central Alberta, paving the way for its conversion to battery-quality lithium hydroxide monohydrate, the company said then. The test work used concentrate generated from brines located in E3’s Clearwater Project Area near Leduc, it said. The testing was conducted to treat a sample of concentrate, or eluate, produced by the DLE technology, the company said, adding the program has progressed through coarse purification and concentration phases with eluate being converted to lithium carbonate. E3’s Alberta project is being developed under a strategic agreement with Imperial Oil and an equity investment from Imperial of C$6.3 million ($5 million). In mid-2022, Imperial Oil and E3 announced a deal to advance a lithium-extraction pilot in Alberta, exploring the redevelopment of an historic oil field into a potential new leading source of lithium for Canada’s growing critical minerals industry.
