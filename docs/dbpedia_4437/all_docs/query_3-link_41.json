        "text": "Slowdown in EV growth significantly impacts 2024 outlook for Umicore’s Battery Materials activities\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a sharp slowdown in the growth of demand for EVs impacting the entire supply chain, customers’ demand projections for Umicore’s battery materials have steeply declined in recent weeks. Consequently 2024 volumes for its battery materials could be equal or slightly lower than last year. In this context, Umicore lowers its full year 2024 guidance for the Battery Materials Business Group and now expects adjusted EBITDA for this business to be around break-even, including a positive one-off c. € 50 million1. This compares to the initially expected adjusted EBITDA2 for the Business Group in the order of €135 million3.\n\nThe overall 2024 performance of Umicore’s foundation businesses (Catalysis, Recycling and Specialty Materials) continues to be robust and overall in line with market expectations, confirming their capability to generate strong earnings and free cash flows and industry-leading returns.\n\nUmicore now expects Group adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024 to be in a range of € 760 million to € 800 million4.\n\nThe updated guidance reflects a reduction in cathode materials sales which is driven by:\n\nVolumes from legacy contracts coming to an end faster than anticipated;\n\nA delay in the anticipated volume ramp-up of new contracts in Europe as customers are scaling back their electrification ramp-up plans. The take-or-pay mechanisms of these contracts come in gradually during ramp-up;\n\nThe volumes for a Chinese battery OEM not materializing in 2024.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for Battery Materials (previously reported under the former Energy & Surface Technologies Business Group) amounted to €149 million in 2023, which included as reported earlier, substantial one offs related to a non-recurring lithium effect and valuation of battery production scraps.\n\nUmicore has started a process of re-assessing growth projections post 2024 in response to the slowdown and ongoing reviews of the investments plans by EV manufacturers. Umicore is working closely with its customers to create clarity in the coming months. The outcome of this assessment will result in phasing Umicore’s capex plans to closely match the future growth pace of its customer base. In the meantime, capex5 for 2024 is expected to not exceed € 650 million. Given the slower ramp-up, Umicore is also assessing ways to adjust its cost structure.\n\nBart Sap, Umicore’s CEO, commented: “Our short-term outlook in Battery Materials is clearly disappointing. At the same time the electro-mobility trajectory is and will not be linear, like in any other significant industry transformation. This is why we are re-assessing our own growth path with agility and determination, while we maintain a strong belief in the long-term prospects of electrification. We are convinced that Umicore has the right to play across all drive-trains through our broad technology portfolio, lasting customer relationships and relevant footprint. We are adapting our pace to this new reality and are taking the necessary actions to navigate the immediate challenges. We continue to build on the firm fundamentals of our complementary foundation businesses which are global leaders in their respective markets. They are a bedrock of strong cash flow and returns, as well as a repository of our vast knowledge and experience. This underpins our ambition to replicate this success for our battery materials business.”\n\nConference call and live audio webcast\n\nA conference call and audio webcast will take place today at 08:15 AM CEST hosted by Bart Sap, CEO and Wannes Peferoen, CFO.\n\nLive audio webcast\n\nThe audio webcast and replay can be accessed here: https://channel.royalcast.com/landingpage/umicore/20240612_1/\n\nConference call\n\nImportant: participants need to register upfront to receive the call-in details by email.\n\nTo register for the conference call click here.\n\nPlease fill in the registration form upon which you will receive a confirmation email with the information to join the call (pin code and phone number per country).
