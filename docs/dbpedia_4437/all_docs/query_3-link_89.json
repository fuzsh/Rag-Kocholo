        "text": "The Institute of Registered Auditors (IBR-IRE) celebrates this year the 20 years of the Awards for Best Belgian Sustainability Reports. Originally, an environmental award, it evolved to a full sustainability award for which the evaluation criteria have been largely aligned to the GRI standards. Elia won the Award for Best first Sustainability Report, chosen by the Jury. Pro Natura and Umicore are the winners for the Best Impact Sustainability Reports voted by the public.\n\nThe Jury also short-listed 5 nominees focusing on the impact of the Sustainability reports. The nominees were Solvay & Umicore in the category ‘large organisations’ and Pro Natura, Protos & the Federal Public Service Economy in the category ‘other organisations’. During a public vote on the ceremony yesterday, The audience could choose the winners of these best impact reports . After an exciting race, the audience finally gave the best points to Pro Natura and Umicore.\n\nElia: Best First Year Sustainability Report\n\nThe Jury appreciated the clear definition of stakeholders in the report of Elia and the way to interact with them (original stakeholder strategic interviews) the good materiality matrix approach, the clear ambitions with targets, the use of the new\n\nGRI Standards and the link with SDG’s.\n\nPro Natura & Umicore: Best Impact Sustainability Reports\n\nPro Natura has been short-listed by the Jury to participate in the competition for the Award “Best Impact Sustainability Report” by the Jury in the category “Other organizations”. The Jury appreciated the fair and transparent report of Pro Natura. It is transparent also on challenges. The report is nice to read, well presented and clear, concise and well structured. It is also well balanced and reflects a sound selection of material topics. The value chain is also included into the assessment on materiality. The report is nicely linked with the GRI G4 guidelines and the SDG’s. Pro Natura also provides a clear overview of its intended impact in the coming years in a SMART way.\n\nUmicore has been short-listed by the Jury to participate in the competition for the Award “Best Impact Sustainability Report” in the category “Large organizations”. The Jury appreciated the strong link with stakeholders, the mention of the shortcomings which makes it a balanced and honest report in positive and negative announcements. The reports shows clear linkages between strategy and context. The report provides for a lot of information but is easy to use, thanks to a clear analysis based on the value chain, linked to materiality and targets. It also provides for assurance by an independent registered auditor.\n\nThe ongoing participation in the Awards for Best Belgian Sustainability Reports proves that sustainable development is increasingly part of an organisation’s business strategy, even if reports come out only every two or three years or in a timing which makes it difficult to participate.\n\nThe Jury would like to stress once again the growing development of integrated or combined reporting and is very proud that some Belgian organisations are increasingly moving towards integrated reporting. The Jury congratulates them in particular on their efforts in this respect.\n\nThe Jury hopes that other organizations will follow suit."
