        "text": "Copyright Â© BusinessAMBE 2023\n\nSFPIM, the Federal Holding and Investment Company, is continuing its anchoring strategy with a notable new investment. The public investor is buying 5 percent in materials technology company Umicore.\n\nIn the news: SFPIM announced Monday evening a 5 percent stake in the capital of Umicore, which focuses on materials technology, metals and recycling. The Belgian state thus becomes the fifth largest shareholder through SFPIM.\n\nðŸ‘‰ \"Umicore plays a central role in the ecological transition thanks to its recycling activities and the production of cathodes for the automotive industry,\" SFPIM said in a note. \"With this investment, SFPIM wishes to co-manage the transformation and development phase of the company.\"\n\nThe broader picture: SFPIM has been working for some time to locally anchor companies that are strategically important to Belgium through the purchase of a minority stake. In some cases, that also results in a seat on the board of directors.\n\nThese are mainly financial companies, such as insurer Ageas, stock exchange company Euronext or securities house Euroclear.\n\nIn addition, the public investor also manages the federal government interests in the financial institutions that became partly or fully state-owned during the 2008 banking crisis, including Belfius or Ethias.\n\nSFPIM also controls a quarter of Brussels Airport.\n\nWith its entry into Umicore, the public investor is making it clear that it not only wants to be a financial superholding, but also hopes to anchor our industry.\n\nSide note: Through anchoring, the Belgian state is creating preventive buffers against unwanted foreign takeovers of strategically important companies. But critics say the strategy also works to \"distort\" the Belgian economy."
