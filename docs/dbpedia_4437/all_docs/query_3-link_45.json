        "text": "Mr. Grynberg\n\nUnfortunately, there has been a considerable impact. Some of our customers are based in the disaster-stricken region, and they have been greatly affected by the disaster. I sincerely hope that these companies will recover as soon as possible.\n\nThe important thing I would like to state here is that Umicore will not change its existing business and investment plans in Japan. We decided to press on with the launch of operations at the Kobe plant (scheduled for the end of April 2011) and our investment plans in other cities according to our initial schedule. In the long-term perspective Japan's economy will undoubtedly recover. When that happens, Umicore must be a fixture in the Japanese market.\n\nMr. Grynberg\n\nWe would like to expand our business into various fields. One of them is providing support for electric vehicles. Umicore has unique technologies in the fields of battery materials, catalysts for cars and recycling of scarce materials. Japan is an emerging market for these fields, and we would like to seek growth in these areas. Umicore is also the world's leading company in recycling of complex materials, so in Japan we are exploring whether we could launch a recycling business, specifically in the field of precious and scarce metals. Currently, one of our strategies is to seek possibilities in the field of catalysts through cooperation with Japanese auto makers and together with our Japanese partner.\n\nWe are also identifying business opportunities in Japanese industries where our company's materials may be used; namely, display screens, electric/electronic parts, high-purity glass and solar cells, among others.\n\nMoreover, (as a corporate strategy in the future) expanding business in the fields of electric vehicles, solar cells, recycling and catalysts will be one of the global strategies for Umicore group. This applies to the Japanese market as well. We are identifying future possibilities to grow in these four fields.\n\nMr. Grynberg\n\nFirst of all, I wish to express my sincerest sympathy and deepest compassion to the people who have suffered from the disaster. The reason why Umicore Japan remained in Tokyo following the disaster was because we wanted to do our best for the people in disaster-stricken areas to help their recovery and revival through business activities. The reason I came to Japan from my home country of Belgium in the wake of the great earthquake was to show our unchanged commitment, and business and investment plans for Japan.\n\nMr. Gellens\n\nI also would like to express my deepest sympathy to the people who suffered due to the disaster. I contacted people connected to our business immediately after the disaster, and found that everyone was aiming for a speedy recovery and seeking to restart business. Our employees also felt the same. Our hope is that Japan will return to its pre-disaster status as soon as possible."
