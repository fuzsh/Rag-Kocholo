        "text": "A giant zinc-plated ribbon folds in and out between the floors of this Antwerp office extension for metal refiner Umicore.\n\nBelgian firm Conix Architects completed the extension in 2009, which provides an entrance to the companyâ€™s nine-storey-high industrial plant.\n\nThe facade of the building is glazed between the strips of curved metal.\n\nThe lowest folds of the ribbon shelter the ground floor lobby and create the sloped floor of a lecture room above.\n\nSee more projects from Belgium here, including a see-through church and a renovated farmhouse.\n\nPhotography is by Serge Brison.\n\nHere's some text from Conix Architects:\n\nMaster plan of an industrial site and office building, Hoboken (near Antwerp)\n\nThe company plant of Umicore, south of the Antwerp agglomerate, is part of a larger industrial park. The site is a city in itself but lacks structural cohesion and coherence. Conix Architects had to structure this complex site to promote a new corporate identity. In order to integrate the plant better into its surroundings and generate an improved feeling on the whole, reconversion was considered.\n\nConix Architects developed a strategy which creates a new and more accessible identity for the company. The strengths and weaknesses of the terrain were determined. Based on this, Conix Architects drew up a master plan, including the problem areas and particular issues. The master plan points out the complexity and diversity of the necessary actions. Consequently, the perception and emotions of future visitors and employees are also considered. The functionality and flow of logistical activities are revised and modified, where needed.\n\nMultiple spatial changes are made: adding a compact tower building with offices, screens, green areas, billboards, signage and route descriptions and the renovation of a number of important industrial buildings.\n\nThe new office building is the eye-catcher, encapsulating and generating the companyâ€™s new corporate identity. It offers a place to stop on the main axis which runs through the entire site. By narrowing and shaping the street profile, the idea of an entry area is created, an element that was lacking. The office building is unrestrained in design in contrast to the monotonous and randomly selected surroundings. The design draws oneâ€™s attention, in an emotional response, counter to the existing rational background. By positioning the building at a slight angle, the axis of the central entry road is broken.\n\nThe powerful look and feel creates an innovative image, thus modernizing the company. Umicore is ready to face the 21st century as a dynamic and innovating company.\n\nProject name: Umicore Hoboken\n\nProject description: Master plan of an industrial site + extension and new interior design for office building\n\nClient: Umicore Precious Metals Refining Hoboken nv\n\nSite: A. Greinerstraat, 2660 Hoboken\n\nDesign submission date: December 2005\n\nStart of construction: September 2007\n\nDelivery date: June 2009\n\nSurface area: 110 ha masterplanning, 2.300 mÂ² new construction, 6.900 mÂ² renovation"
