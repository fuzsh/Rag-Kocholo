Umicore’s overriding goal of sustainable value creation is based on this ambition to develop, produce and recycle metals in a way that fulfills its mission: materials for a better life.\n\nThe materials technology and recycling group Umicore officially opened on January 17th , 2017 its new production plant for emission control catalysts in Rayong, Thailand. The plant produces automotive catalysts for gasoline and diesel light duty vehicles, serving customers in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe plant, which operates with a team of more than 50 employees, is situated in a special economic zone near Rayong, close to automotive plants in the country. It allows Umicore to meet the increasing demand for emission control catalysts in the fast growing market of Southeast Asia (AEC).\n\nGiven their extensive presence in the regional market, Japanese automotive producers make up the majority of the plant’s business. These Japanese customers will be served by the Umicore Shokubai joint venture.\n\nUmicore’s catalysts enable improvements to air quality by transforming harmful vehicle emissions through sophisticated catalytic processes. Umicore is a pioneer in automotive catalyst technology and has been producing emission control catalysts for over 40 years.
