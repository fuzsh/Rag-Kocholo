        "text": "Umicore N.V. Partner Information Based Brussels, Belgium Founder 1989 Announced 18 February 2019[1] Broke Role Battery Recycling Supplier Official Website Umicore\n\nUmicore N.V., stylised as umicore, is a Belgian based multinational materials technology company, specialising in refining and recycling precious metals.[2] Founded in 1989 after the merger of four mining and smelting industries, Umicore is one of Belgium's most important business and a founding member of the BEL20 stock market index.[2]\n\nUmicore first became involved in the ABB FIA Formula E Championship during the 2018/19 season, signing a multi-year partnership deal with Formula E Holdings to recycle the batteries used in 2014/15 and 2015/16.[1]\n\nBackground[]\n\nUmicore's origin is found in the era of colonialism, with the Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK) a principle factor.[2] The company, originally incorporated in 1906, was founded to exploit natural resources in the Congo Free State (later the Belgian Congo), and came to hold a near-global monopoly on uranium.[2] By 1967 UMHK held more than half the revenue produced by the Congo, resulting in then President Mobutu Sese Seko to nationalise the firm.[2]\n\nFallout and Reform[]\n\nThe seizure of over $800 million worth of assets left UMHK on the verge of bankruptcy, although the group managed to survive following a transfer of ownership.[2] The group subsequently found itself under the control of the Société Générale de Belgique, which placed the firm in their mining and metal refining investments.[2] UMHK was renamed as Union Minière, and duly began to grow to one of the largest firms in the SGB with interests in various refining sectors.[2]\n\nUnion Minière's success led the SGB to merge the group with three other business, forming Acec-Union Minière in 1989.[2] Streamlining through the 1990s saw the group ultimately renamed as Umicore in 2001, with a switch away from mining to clean technologies coming in the early 2000s.[2] Umicore subsequently became The Global 100's \"Most Sustainable Company in the World\" in 2013, with interests in recycling, emission control catalysts and renewable energy.[2]\n\nFormula E History[]\n\nUmicore were one of a number of companies to be consulted by various entrants in the ABB FIA Formula E Championship about the use of batteries, and duly partnered with Mahindra Racing during the 2017/18 season.[3] The Belgian firm would subsequently be contacted by FE's overseers Formula E Holdings about recycling the first generation of batteries at the end of the same campaign, with the new Spark SRT05e using a new battery pack developed by McLaren Applied Technologies.[4] Umicore subsequently signed a deal with FEH midway through the 2018/19 season, becoming the series' 'official battery recycling supplier' on a multi-year contract.[1]\n\nProducts[]\n\nUmicore serve as the series' 'official battery recycling supplier', and hence provide no official products to the ABB FIA Formula E Championship.\n\nReferences[]\n\nVideos and Images:\n\nReferences:"
