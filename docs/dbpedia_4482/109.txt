NetSuite Overview:

NetSuite was founded in 1998 by Evan Goldberg, who had previously worked at Oracle. Goldberg recognized that legacy client-server accounting software was inadequate for modern web-based businesses. He envisioned a cloud-based system that could provide integrated business management software. Along with his team, Goldberg spent two years developing the initial version of NetSuite, which launched in 1999 as the first software-as-a-service (SaaS) financial management system. NetSuite's cloud-based model allowed businesses to access its tools over the internet, without having to install software locally. This innovation enabled smaller companies to affordably manage key business processes like accounting, inventory, and CRM on an integrated platform. NetSuite has continued to grow and expand its product offerings over the years, and has become a leader in cloud ERP solutions.

NetSuite pricing ð°:

NetSuiteâs pricing isnât public, but beware, itâs expensive. Really, really expensive. Annual contracts typically start at $50k and scale up from there. Yes, it has more features than a Quickbooks or a Xero but at a price that matches.

Also keep in mind that along with the annual cost of the software there will be an expensive integration process.Â

Additionally, you will pay more for additional modules, additional seat licenses, and ongoing support.

This is a tool for the big boys and priced to match.

With third-party applications QuickBooks can mimic some NetSuite features, but it does not have the robust features that NetSuite does for Enterprise size companies.

Can you convert QuickBooks to NetSuite?
