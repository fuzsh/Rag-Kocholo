Some NetSuite History

NetSuite was founded in 1998, and was one of the first vendors to develop web-based business applications. In November 2016 NetSuite was acquired by Oracle, and it now operates as an independent global business unit.

NetSuite has since scaled to become the #1 cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution supported by an ecosystem of partners, users, and third-party solution providers extending, customizing, and integrating NetSuite solutions.
