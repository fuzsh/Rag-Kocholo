        "text": "Highlights for this year included the purchase and build-out of a new Phoenix production and warehousing facility that doubled our footprint in the Southwest. Overseas, the sales staff in Mumbai also completed a move to larger space, which now comfortably accommodates the 14 staff members there.\n\nInpro’s award-winning history continued with a ninth consecutive Top Workplaces award, and the third Wisconsin 75 honor marking our place as one of the state’s largest privately and closely held companies.\n\nWe’re known for our commitment to our community, and 2018 was no exception. In addition to our contribution to build the new Inpro Athletic Field at Muskego High School, Inpro also contributed to provide camera technology to the police department’s K-9 unit. And we continue as a main corporate sponsor for Make-a-Wish, Children’s Hospital, Racers Fuel the Cure and the Waukesha County Fair.\n\n2019\n\nA year of expansion and innovation\n\nInpro sustained its reputation as a first-rate employer with its 10th consecutive placement as a Top Workplaces as scored by Energage, Inc., the research partner for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s annual ranking.\n\nProduct innovation was in the spotlight as the new F140 Fire barrier was named an Architectural Record Best Product, and the new 1000BH Series Ligature Resistant Handrail won a prestigious Nightingale Silver Award for Clinical Architectural Products.\n\nInpro expanded its international production of fire barriers with the opening of a Fireline Fire Barriers production cell at its plant in Orvieto, Italy, which vastly reduces lead times for customers in the European region.\n\nThe company embraces its role as a corporate citizen, and was proud to be honored by the Wisconsin Association of School Boards (WASB) for its work with local students in career exploration, high school co-op student engagement and college internships.\n\n2020\n\nContinued performing, growing and innovating\n\nIt was an incredibly challenging year for any business in 2020. Yet despite the pandemic, Inpro continued performing, growing and innovating. Here are some of the highlights:\n\nFor the 11th year in a row Inpro was named a Top Workplace in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel / Energage annual ranking. In addition, Inpro was ranked in the Deloitte Wisconsin 75 for the 4th\n\nWe became the first company in Wisconsin to receive a Fitwel® building certification. Fitwel is the world's leading certification system committed to building health for all. The system’s vision is to create a healthier future where all buildings and communities are enhanced to strengthen health and well-being.\n\nInpro completed a successful expansion and implementation of cubicle curtain track production at its Charlotte, N.C., and Phoenix, Ariz. plants. These new production hubs allow for capacity balancing and faster ship times.\n\nThe company’s door + wall protection division launched a new wall cladding system targeting labs, pharma production, clean rooms and commercial food prep. The innovative Sani-System™ Heavy Duty Wall Protection is comprised of two integrated products:\n\nSani-Base™ Stainless Steel Wall Base— the only complete waterproof transition from floor to wall when installed per manufacturer’s instructions\n\nSani-Surface™ Hygienic Wall Cladding – new industrial-strength, fiberglass-free wall panels offering high impact resistance, a Class A fire rating, and thermal stability to handle a wide range of temperatures and moisture fluctuations.\n\nInpro successfully completed a migration to the NetSuite® system as its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform. The highly flexible, cloud-based NetSuite ERP will serve Inpro’s growth plans well into the future.\n\n2021\n\nContinued Expansion\n\nThis year, Inpro chalked up its 28th straight Best Year Ever, and we hired 125 new employees to accommodate increased sales and allow us to successfully manage our industry-leading short lead time delivery to our customers. Other highlights included:\n\nBeing recognized with our 12th straight regional and first-ever national Top Workplaces USA award, issued by Energage, a purpose-driven organization that develops solutions to build and brand Top Workplaces. In addition, Inpro was recognized with special awards in the areas of manufacturing, innovation and leadership.\n\nAcquiring Chicago-based Everything Division 12 (ED12) a provider of window treatment solutions, including solar shades, blinds and drapery; and specializing in motorized and automated shading solutions for commercial buildings. The acquisition supports Inpro’s leadership in the commercial interiors industry and broadens our capabilities in the commercial window treatment business.\n\nBeing named the Large Business of the Year by the Waukesha County Business Alliance. The Business of the Year award honors small, medium and large businesses with a significant presence in southeast Wisconsin who are committed to good business practices, are involved in their community, are committed to their customers and employees, and demonstrate financial growth and consistency.\n\nOnce again, Inpro was recognized in the Deloitte Wisconsin 75 award that recognizes the contributions made to Wisconsin’s economy by the state’s largest privately and closely held companies.\n\nAnd to conclude … in recognition of our continuous focus on protecting our planet and resources, Inpro was recognized by the Wisconsin Dept. of Natural Resource Recycling Award for implementing a more robust recycling program and increasing product yields to produce less scrap. Inpro is operating at a 79.4% overall diversion rate based on production efficiencies.\n\n2022\n\nGetting Bigger and Bolder\n\nInpro is proud to celebrate our 29th straight “Best Year Ever” having reached record momentum on all fronts. For the 13th year in a row, we received the Top Workplace Award. In March, Marc Holland transitioned to CEO to continue the legacy left by Phil Ziegler. We acquired WT Shade, an expert commercial window treatment manufacturer, and launched Continuum® Shower Walls and interior protection.\n\nTo address industry-wide challenges we invested in a new sheet line and tanker truck for our door and wall product line, providing better control of our material supply and lead times in our ongoing obsession with providing world-class service.\n\nWe launched the CommUNITY of Friends program as a space for employees and their peers to gather, create, socialize, and plan for whatever their passions inspire them to do. And Inpro’s community impact reached beyond our U.S. borders. Inpro employees came together to donate nearly $17,000 in funds and critical supplies to Ukrainian refugees at the height of the Russian and Ukraine crisis. We also innovated our recycling and product yields to operate more efficiently and keep us on track to become net zero landfill by 2025.\n\nWe anticipate great success as we prepare for 2023’s “Best Year Ever.”\n\n2023\n\nExceeding and Expanding\n\nInpro celebrated its 30th “Best Year Ever” in 2023, reaching new milestones and exceeding expectations for the 30th anniversary of ownership by the Ziegler family.\n\nWe proudly earned both regional and national awards as a Top Workplace: 2nd year as a United States winner and 14th Hall-of-Fame winner regionally. This honor is a testament to our unwavering dedication to fostering an exceptional workplace environment and being an “employees first” company.\n\nIn tandem with this milestone, Inpro embarked on a groundbreaking initiative—the first-ever building products roadshow: Join the Movement™. This pioneering venture brought accredited education and products directly to architects and contractors across the nation in a never-before-done way.\n\nCollaborating closely with MSI Construction, we announced significant expansion plans, including the expansion of our distribution center and the construction of a new office building.\n\nAligned with our commitment to sustainability, we are still set to achieve net-zero waste status by 2025.\n\nThe year 2023 was a testament to Inpro's dedication to excellence, innovation, and growth. As we move forward, these milestones serve as the foundation for our continued commitment to our people, our customers, and our pursuit of industry-leading solutions."
