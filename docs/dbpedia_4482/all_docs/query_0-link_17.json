This guide is an excellent primer and roadmap for implementing NetSuite.\n\nHistory of NetSuite\n\nOrigins and evolution of the software:\n\nNetSuite's journey began in 1998 when it was founded by Evan Goldberg under the original name \"NetLedger.\" The primary goal was to provide businesses with web-based accounting software, a revolutionary idea at the time.\n\nWith the backing and vision of Oracle's co-founder, Larry Ellison, the company quickly expanded its offerings beyond just accounting.\n\nKey milestones during development:\n\nOver the years, NetSuite underwent several transformations, both in terms of its product suite and its branding. Some notable milestones include:\n\n2003: Introduction of the NetSuite ERP, expanding its capabilities beyond accounting. Using an ERP system, such as NetSuite, gives an organisation improved efficiency, enhanced decision making and so much more.\n\n2007: The company officially rebranded from NetLedger to NetSuite, reflecting its broader range of solutions.\n\n2016: Oracle acquired NetSuite, further solidifying its position in the market and benefiting from Oracle's vast resources and expertise.\n\nWhat is NetSuite?\n\nNetSuite is a comprehensive cloud-based finance software solution designed to manage various business processes in a unified system. It encompasses functions such as financial management, customer relationship management (CRM), e-commerce, and more.\n\nBy integrating these functions, NetSuite provides businesses with a 360-degree view of their operations, enabling them to streamline workflows and enhance efficiency.\n\nBeing cloud-based, NetSuite offers several advantages over traditional on-premises systems. Businesses can access the platform from anywhere, anytime, ensuring continuity and flexibility.\n\nMoreover, the cloud model means reduced IT overhead, automatic updates, and enhanced security.\n\nHow NetSuite is Used\n\nAt its core, NetSuite is powerful finance software, bringing together on a single platform elements that are often left behind. For example, approval routings, budgeting and forecasting can all be done in the same single platform. ERP systems integrate various business processes into a single unified platform, facilitating data sharing across departments and improving decision-making.\n\nWith NetSuite, non profit organisations can ensure that departments like finance, sales, subgranting, funder management, approvals and budgeting are not operating in silos but are interconnected, sharing real-time data and insights. Having an expert team of NetSuite consultants allows all these functions to reach their full potential.\n\nContact us to find out exactly how you can use NetSuite.\n\nKey Features of NetSuite\n\nNetSuite's robustness lies in its comprehensive suite of features, tailored to meet the diverse needs of businesses across various sectors.\n\nLet's delve into some of the platform's most prominent functionalities:\n\nFinancial Management\n\nNetSuite's financial management module is at the heart of its offerings, providing businesses with tools to streamline their financial operations.\n\nAccounting: With a centralised source of financial data, businesses can automate their day-to-day accounting tasks, from ledger and inventory management to accounts payable and receivable.\n\nFinancial Planning: NetSuite aids in budgeting, forecasting, and financial modelling, allowing companies to plan effectively for the future.\n\nRevenue Recognition: For businesses with complex revenue streams, NetSuite offers features to recognize revenue according to accounting standards, ensuring compliance and accuracy.\n\nConstituent Relationship Management (CRM)\n\nBuilding and maintaining customer relationships is crucial for any business, and NetSuite's CRM module is designed to facilitate just that.\n\nSales Force Automation: Automate the entire donation and funder management process, from lead generation to closing funding, ensuring that fundraising teams can focus on building relationships and driving income.\n\nMarketing Automation: Streamline marketing campaigns, track ROI, and segment customer data for targeted outreach.\n\nCustomer Support and Service: Manage customer inquiries, track service requests, and ensure timely resolution, leading to enhanced customer satisfaction.\n\nE-commerce\n\nIn the digital age, having a strong online presence is indispensable.
