In addition to continuing to enhance our core products—mortgages, credit cards and checking accounts—we began to replace our online banking systems as well as revamp our corporate website, the benefits of which you will experience in the coming months.

Here are some points we want you to know:\n\nDifferent from everyday credit unions\n\nPURCHASE, NY – Each year at Quorum Federal Credit Union, a Holiday Committee is created to help raise money for a local charity. On Thursday, December 17, 2009, the Committee sponsored a holiday party for the Spinal Cord Unit of James J. Peters Veterans Medical Center in Bronx, NY.\n\nFundraising for the event was a company-wide effort that included a bake sale, office raffles (prizes were a full-day off with pay, a $100 American Express Gift Card, and professional cakes baked and donated by employee Lisa Penirelli’s daughter, Ariana), and a “Charity Tree” decorated with ornaments listing presents desired by the veterans.\n\nFrom The New York Times\n\nBy Nancy Folbre\n\n(Original Publication: July 27, 2009)\n\nCredit unions always seemed like Dullsville to me. I never bothered to check out the interest rates, much less the governance structure of credit unions I was eligible to join.\n\nBut in the wake of the financial crisis, they began to look more like Clark Kent, who turned out to be Superman. When the big American banks started sucking up to funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, credit unions, with many fewer subprime mortgages on their balance sheets, started looking really good.\n\nFrom The New York Times\n\nBy Ryan Bubb and Alex Kaufman\n\n(Original Publication: June 22, 2009)\n\nIndustry representatives would have you believe that the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act enacted last month spells the end of the credit card as we know it. President Obama’s proposal last week to create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency to enforce the law has increased the industry’s concerns.\n\nRepurposed from The Journal News, Westchester County\n\nBy David Schepp\n\n(Original Publication: October 4, 2008)\n\nThe turmoil that has ripped through the U.S. financial system has seemingly touched every sector, from investment banks to savings and loans to mortgage companies.\n\nCredit unions, however, have remained unscathed, even as concern about the fallout has pushed the National Credit Union Administration, which administers the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, to assure credit union customers that their money is safe.\n\nFrom The Wall Street Journal\n\nBy Brett Arends\n\n(Original Publication: August 28, 2008)\n\nFor obvious reasons, many Americans are pretty unimpressed with the banking industry right now.\n\nSo maybe it’s a good time to look at an alternative – like moving your account to a local credit union instead.\n\nFrom The Wall Street Journal\n\nBy Andrea Coombes\n\n(Original Publication: April 27, 2008)\n\nThe Web sites may not look quite as polished and the eligibility requirements may give you pause, but when it comes to low fees and generous rates, credit unions match banks head-to-head.\n\nIt’s not that you’ll find drastically better deals at credit unions, but their products should be among the options you consider when searching for savings and checking accounts, certificates of deposit, small-business, mortgage and auto loans, and credit cards — particularly now, given that credit unions in large part sidestepped the subprime crisis."
