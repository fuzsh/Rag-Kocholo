        "text": "Oracle in the early days had one of the most competitive cultures of any company They were willing to do anything to win (It caught up with them in 1990) But this passage from the book, The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison: *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison, explains it üëá \"The fundamental question for any businessperson is: What are you prepared to do to get ahead? And whether or not anybody thought about it, Oracle faced that question every day. What would Oracle do to win? Was it willing to deceive its customers‚Äîor at least make them feel deceived‚Äîabout what they would get for their money? Was it prepared to loose a sell and drop sales force on the marketplace? To put all the really good people in presales at the expense of customer support? To release software that wasn't ready in an attempt to stay competitive? Gary Kennedy: \"The motto-or the epitaph-could well be written: We did what we had to do.\" --- I think it's important for anyone in business to understand their answer to that question: What are you prepared to do to get ahead? And know that there are probably competitors out there, good or bad, willing to do anything.\n\n‚ÄúWe are modernizing away from Oracle‚Äù This was a throw away line from our client, but it‚Äôs really stuck with me. It even made me a little sad. üòû I know that Palisade has built an entire business protecting our clients from Oracle overreach. However, most companies over the years have made the decision to put up with Oracle‚Äôs behavior because the Oracle products were good. Are we seeing a shift? More and more companies are actively looking to excise Oracle products from their environment. What‚Äôs Oracle‚Äôs response to this? Hit the accelerator and push things like Java enterprise licenses. It is a little sad that a mega technology vendor like Oracle can‚Äôt see the customer satisfaction issues in front of them. It's also surprising when a company says they are modernizing and getting rid of Oracle at the same time. They equate Oracle technology with legacy. Open source, cloud native, AI are the future. My guess is this client would not be moving away from Oracle if Oracle‚Äôs behavior was different. If this company had client-first Oracle sales people then they would be sticking with Oracle. Just a guess, but I‚Äôm a good guesser. If you are an Oracle customer, and you want to continue using Oracle, it‚Äôs critical you stay in control of your licensing, contracting, compliance, and costs. If any of these get out of whack, you‚Äôre going to feel real financial pain. You may even find yourself locked out of new technologies (Oracle or other). Palisade Compliance is 100% independent of Oracle. Whatever your path with Oracle, we keep you in control so you can make the best decisions for your organization.\n\nI‚Äôve always been excited about working for Oracle but right now I'm more thrilled than ever about our mission and impact! ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù You ask. Because I'm so inspired by the transformative work our customers are doing on #Oracle #technology. üå°Ô∏è First, together we're on a mission to enhance #healthcare. Not only does that mean improving patient and provider experiences; A pivotal aspect involves expediting the testing of new drugs and taking them to market safely so more people can benefit from them. üåæ Secondly, we're re-imagining #agriculture. Transforming this industry will not only help to combat food insecurity and reduce the environmental footprint, it will do so while enhancing safety and consistency for its invaluable workforce. These challenges are among the most complex in the world, and I'm beyond inspired to support Oracle customers to be part of the solutions üåçüí™ Hear it straight from Larry Ellison‚Äôs #CloudWorld keynote: https://lnkd.in/e4W4ruYH #innovation"
