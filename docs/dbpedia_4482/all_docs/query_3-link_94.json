        "text": "This is part of HappyAR’s ongoing Vendor Review series where we help busy company owners and executives evaluate their options for software and services that help the finance operations functions. These solutions will be related, and possibly integrated with our AR automation SaaS. Make sure to follow us as we continue to post new guides that can help companies of all sizes. This review is on Zoho Invoice.\n\nAbout Zoho\n\nZoho offers a suite of business, collaboration, and productivity applications. The company offers over 30 online applications from CRM to mail, office suite, project management, invoicing, email marketing, social media management, and more.\n\nToday we’re looking at Zoho Finance Plus and specifically the Zoho Invoice portion of the suite.\n\nKeep in mind that Zoho Invoice is a product that’s completely free. To understand why that’s the case, here’s the company’s explanation:\n\nZoho has been a profitable, bootstrapped, privately-held company for over 20 years; we’ve been offering free (and ad-free) productivity apps for more than a decade. While some of our products are free, others are paid. Paid products subsidize our free apps. Free apps bring more awareness to our paid apps and brand in general. Our business model is as simple as that. There’s no hidden agenda here to sell user data for ads.\n\nZoho was founded in 1996 by Sridhar Vembu and is based in Pleasanton, CA.\n\nZoho Invoice Process Overview\n\nAccording to the company:\n\nZoho Invoice is online invoicing software that helps you craft professional invoices, send payment reminders, keep track of expenses, log your work hours, and get paid faster—all for free!\n\nCREATE Professional Invoices. Crafting professional invoices is essential for creating the right brand image, building trust with customers, and encouraging payment. Zoho Invoice lets you create perfect invoices in seconds.\n\nSEND Invoices Effectively. Zoho Invoice helps ensure that the invoices you send actually reach your customers. Your clients may also appreciate timely reminders to clear their past-due balances and avoid penalties.\n\nA simple payment process helps you get paid on time. Provide multiple payment options that your customers can choose from to make their payments securely.\n\nWe were up and running with custom invoices within ten minutes.\n\nThis included confirming our account, customizing an invoice template with our company information and branding, selecting sales tax collection functionality, and linking our payment method (in our case, Stripe).\n\nWe liked how there was the ability to select your industry and business type to guide the setup process:\n\nCustomizing and branding invoices for our business was intuitive and fast:\n\nWe completed this part of the setup in less than five minutes:\n\nConnecting and configuring payments was also very easy. We only did Stripe for our test, but the other options are very popular and we assume that they will be easy to connect as well:\n\nThe solution does feel like it’s built for very small companies and freelancers, so we liked the ability to set up mobile access upfront:\n\nHere is our feedback after registering, configuring, and trying the system out:\n\nWe love how easy it was to activate and configure. You do not need to be a technical person to figure this out.\n\nThe iOS and Android mobile apps are an awesome touch. Great for productivity.\n\nThe price is certainly right for companies and freelancers on a budget. It’s hard to beat free.\n\nWe felt that the solution was more focused on small businesses and freelancers. Those organizations should review this application but mid-size and enterprise organizations may find the integrations and functionality to be limited.\n\nWith this in mind, it would make sense to review existing integrations to make sure that connections can happen before you get started. Their pre-built integrations are limited compared to other solutions. Zapier does have Zoho Invoice connections, which is how you could integrate with solutions like HappyAR.\n\nIf you or your accounting agency use other systems like QuickBooks or Xero, you may find Zoho Invoice to be limiting. Zoho has a massive business suite that appears to be their priority to connect you with. Not all of those products are free.\n\nSome criticisms in the past for Zoho have been around complex implementation and poor support compared to paid products, but we didn’t experience this with Zoho Invoice.\n\nWhy you Should Send Invoices Electronically\n\nThe speed and time saving of not having to manually create PDFs, purchase paper materials, print documents, mail, and wait. Even if you’re attaching PDFs to emails, the amount of time you’re wasting per year adds up if you aren’t using invoice automation tools. You also run the risk of email with PDF attachments being blocked by SPAM filters.\n\nThese solutions help greatly reduce or eliminate human error especially when they are part of accounting systems like Zoho Books. No more manual double entry means more accurate billing and better customer relationships.\n\nYou will be able to directly tie in electronic payment options for the convenience of your client and for the benefit of your accounts receivables team. This will accelerate payments and offer an easier way to incentivize early payments.\n\nWith electronic invoices, you will be creating a digital audit trail to protect yourself against problems collecting past due payments that may end up with a collections agency or law firm.\n\nThis process will reduce wasteful paper and inefficient mail processes that are especially impacted by more work-from-home staff members.\n\neInvoices give your team better visibility, especially if you tie in accounts receivable automation solutions like HappyAR.\n\nAbout the Market and Alternative Solutions to Check Out\n\nBecause of its huge business suite, Zoho products compete with many different SaaS categories. The big Zoho Books competitor is QuickBooks, specifically QuickBooks Online. Any evaluation for small business and freelance software solutions should include Zoho Books and QuickBooks.\n\nWe also think that FreshBooks and Sage Intacct are good SMB options to review. If you are a small business, be careful with more advanced enterprise accounting solutions that may have too much functionality, are difficult to self-implement, and are costly. If you are a larger organization (maybe with over 100 employees) or have a high volume of invoices, looking at mid-size and enterprise solutions would be smart to do.\n\nAgencies should consider solutions that allow for multiple client views and address the needs of the companies they serve.\n\nZoho Invoice competes directly with invoicing software like Bill.com and Invoiced and helps to streamline the online invoicing and receivables process without full accounting functionality. While some of these may be good options for companies that have an existing accounting platform, Zoho Invoice may work best only with the larger Zoho Finance suite.\n\nYou may want to consider an option that has seamless integration with your CRM system in order to capture a complete view of your sales and collection lifecycle and the activity happening with each client. Zoho has had a long-standing CRM that competes with Salesforce.com.\n\nNote that HappyAR has an open API and connects to all of these major systems to even further improve the collections process.\n\nWith all software reviews, we suggest using G2 as an impartial evaluation source.\n\nAbout HappyAR and our ability to integrate with Zoho Invoice\n\nHappyAR is a seamless SaaS that quickly and easily boosts your accounts receivables work.\n\nWe save companies of all sizes thousands of dollars each year by optimizing the speed and efficiency of their collections methods.

We elected to set us a Stripe ACH integration for our payment gateway due to the flexibility of their API and the payment options that Stripe supports. There are other out-of-the-box options to consider, but if you have access to development resources that can connect the Stripe API, we strongly suggest it for the price, speed, security, and flexibility.\n\nThis article covers Stripe’s ACH capabilities which we consider to be essential for both B2B and B2C US-based companies that want to offer options to their customers.\n\nWhat exactly is ACH?\n\nACH is short for Automated Clearing House and is a network used for electronically moving money (USD) between bank accounts exclusively in the United States.\n\nThe network has existed since the 1970s and ACH credit transfer volume is growing consistently each year.\n\nThese payments aren’t just for B2B transactions and can also be used for government, consumer, and even some international payments.\n\nACH transactions take around three business days to access and appear on your bank statement depending on several factors with timing, your bank, and the client's bank.\n\nWhat is Stripe?\n\nStripe provides APIs that web developers can use to integrate payment processing into their websites and mobile applications.\n\nBusinesses of every size from new startups to public companies like Salesforce and Facebook use the company’s software to accept online payments and run complex global operations. The company combines economic infrastructure with a set of applications for new business models like crowdfunding and marketplaces, fraud prevention, analytics, and more.\n\nThe company was founded in 2010 and is headquartered in San Francisco, CA.\n\nLearn more about Stripe here\n\nWhat is Plaid?\n\nSince 2016, Stripe and Plaid have partnered to offer seamless bank account verification for their customers. Any evaluation of Stripe’s ACH functionality will inevitably include a look at a Plaid account.\n\nUsers can instantly and securely authenticate their bank accounts through a Plaid link. This eliminates the need for manually entering an account number and routing numbers and then waiting for micro-deposits.\n\nLearn more about Plaid here\n\nWhy should I consider adding Stripe ACH to my payment options?\n\nWe are huge advocates of offering as many payment methods to your clients as possible to accelerate the accounts receivable process and to make checkout for online purchases easier.\n\nWhile there are some small downsides to ACH when it comes to refunds, funding delays, and costs associated with very high volumes, the upsides far outweigh these.\n\nThese upsides include:\n\nACH payments cost way less than credit card payments. There’s no need to add an irritating service charge for your customer or to eat the approximate 3% fee from the credit card network. These charges are very small compared to other payment types.\n\nACH payments are open to anyone with a US bank account – both B2B and consumers.\n\nACH debits help reduce churn associated with expired credit and debit cards. Bank account details may change, but all credit card information needs to be renewed periodically.\n\nKeep in mind that refunds and disputes on ACH payments are fundamentally different than those on credit card payments.\n\nIf a customer’s bank accepts the request to return the funds for a disputed charge, Stripe immediately removes the funds from your Stripe account. Unlike credit card disputes, you can’t contest ACH reversals, so you must contact your customer to resolve the situation.\n\nHow would I go about adding Stripe with ACH payment functionality?\n\nIt’s important to note that configuring Stripe functionality, including ACH payments, requires integration experience from a development resource. This is not a plug-and-play software solution for non-technical folks.\n\nThere are plenty of resources available that can help you configure the web service, but make sure not to cut corners with inexpensive resources. Thoroughly review the qualifications of developers that you interview and only select ones that have extensive experience with this technology and have strong reviews. Data and application security with payments is critical and you want to work with reputable resources or agencies before there is exposure to your bank information or your customers' bank accounts.\n\nIf you want the flexibility and cost savings of hiring an international developer with the confidence that they have been thoroughly screened, consider a resource like Scalable Path – a company that HappyAR has used successfully in the past.\n\nStripe is a large and very popular technology, so API keys, docs, webhooks, endpoints, and sandbox access will be easily available and very well documented for developers to use.\n\nAbout HappyAR\n\nHappyAR is a seamless SaaS that quickly and easily boosts your accounts receivables workflow.\n\nWe partner with various accounting, invoicing, and ERP systems that also allow for Stripe ACH integrations.\n\nWe save companies of all sizes thousands of dollars each year by optimizing the speed and efficiency of their collections methods.

Make sure to follow us as we continue to post new guides that can help companies of all sizes. This article is focused on how companies use a dunning letter in their financial operations\n\nWhat does “dunning” mean?\n\nThe origin of the word “dun” is disputed but its original use was first recorded in the early 17th century (1620). The definition is:\n\nverb (used with object),dunned,dun·ning.\n\nto make repeated and insistent demands upon, especially for the payment of a debt.\n\nnoun\n\na person, especially a creditor, who duns another.\n\na demand for payment, especially a written one.\n\nWhat’s a dunning letter?\n\nSimply put, a dunning letter is slightly more aggressive in tone than a reminder email but less aggressive than a demand letter.\n\nIt serves a role in between these two extremes when an account balance is owed, and gentle reminders have been made to collect.\n\nThe purpose of this note is to clearly increase the intensity of the collection without damaging the client relationship with a much harsher and threatening tone. While that may be required in the future, using it too early can have unwanted consequences.\n\nDunning letters and emails can help reduce days of sales outstanding (DSO), increase cash flow, and avoid the heavy percentages taken by collection agencies and debt collectors.\n\nWhen should I use a dunning letter?\n\nUsing automation technology for your account receivable follow-up workflow and includes visibility into when emails are opened, clicked on, and forwarded will give you a much better understanding of if your request is being ignored or not seen in the first place.\n\nThis is a lot more challenging to do with paper invoices unless you are mailing with delivery confirmation.\n\nDon’t be surprised if way fewer than 50% of your email follow-ups and subsequent letters are being seen by the recipient. This could be related to:\n\nTurnover in their accounts payable department and the recipient no longer being there\n\nSpecific copy being used in your emails that send them to the recipient’s spam folder\n\nProblems with your domain’s deliverability settings that send messages to a spam folder\n\nMessages being overlooked due to high consistent volume\n\nNot personalizing follow-up emails enough and having them being disregarded before opening\n\nNot sending a quick follow-up forwarded email two days after the original. These often receive better response rates, so we highly encourage them.\n\nIf you are unsure if your correspondence is being seen, make sure to follow up with a phone call and leave a voicemail every time.\n\nIf you’ve exhausted two or three email outreach attempts, with follow-up emails for each, and voicemails, it’s time to escalate the message in a tone and send a dunning letter.\n\nInformation to include in dunning letter templates\n\nHere’s what you’re going to want to include in your dunning letter and what you should avoid:\n\nInclude a summary of payment reminder attempts you have made to date. AP departments are busy and may not recall the previous notes you sent.\n\nReiterate the invoice amount due, original due date, days past due, and a brief description of what the debt is related to. Include access to the original unpaid invoice.\n\nSuggest that you will be escalating the request to executive members of their team if a response isn’t received, and prepare to follow through with this by researching senior contacts on LinkedIn.\n\nExplain all payment method options available to them and any payment plan information if you offer those.\n\nRemind them that you will be following up via phone shortly – and do it!\n\nRequest a status update and explain that overdue payments cause a financial burden to your organization.\n\nBriefly explain any next steps in the debt collections process if you have them defined but DO NOT use threatening language around damaging reputation, credit scores, or legal action. Not only is this unethical and unlikely to help resolve anything, it can also be illegal. Know what the collection rules and laws are and obey them!\n\nAbout HappyAR\n\nFollow HappyAR’s AR University for more quick finance learning opportunities, like this one on dunning letters, intended for business owners that are interested in gaining a better understanding of the health of their business and their finance operations.\n\nHappyAR is a seamless SaaS that quickly and easily boosts your accounts receivables work.

It enables its users to track and manage cash flow processes, invoicing, payments, reporting, and pay runs. Users can use Xero through any one of its three monthly subscription packages: starter, standard, and premium. The software solution is available on Mac and PC platforms.\n\nXero was founded in 2006, the company is headquartered in Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand.\n\nXero currently offers a 30-day free trial that includes a 30-day free trial and the ability to:\n\nSend invoices and quotes\n\nEnter bills\n\nReconcile bank transactions\n\nCapture bills and receipts with Hubdoc\n\nUse multiple currencies\n\nAccess on the go with the mobile app\n\nPricing depends on functionality and volume and can be found here.\n\nXero Invoicing Process Overview\n\nIt only took us a minute or so to register for a free trial and to have the ability to start using the full features including invoicing. No credit card was required to get started.\n\nYou’ll have the option to use classic invoicing or new invoicing:\n\nClassic Invoicing\n\nNew Invoicing\n\nYou’ll also have the option to “add more details for polished, professional invoices”. These include a logo, phone number, and address, although adding an address should be strongly suggested or required if you plan to collect paper checks via mail.\n\nWithin a minute, you can add or select a recipient, adjust sections of the invoice like line items, due date, and tax rate, preview, and edit an introduction email:\n\nShortly after, your invoice will be received by your client with the option to click through and pay. Notifications will be available in the platform and via email.\n\nYou’ll be able to import existing invoices to the system now or in the future.\n\nLinking your online payment process is simple and includes offering options for credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, and more. For clients that already accept payments through Stripe, integration between systems exists. Seamless connections with your company bank account will allow for fast deposits and access to funds.\n\nNote that if you’re evaluating Xero with other accounting or invoicing systems, you may not want to send many invoices during the evaluation period. If you’re still undecided after 30 days, you may have outstanding invoices with links to a deactivated Xero account.\n\nWe liked the easy setup and intuitive invoicing interface. Setting up invoice templates would help to accelerate the accounts receivables process. You will also have the option to set repeating or recurring invoices.\n\nWe couldn’t tell any big differences between the two invoice interfaces, so it’s possible that Xero is just phasing to the new, more modern one.\n\nWhy you Should Send Invoices Electronically\n\nThe speed and time saving of not having to manually create PDFs, purchase paper materials, print documents, mail, and wait. Even if you’re attaching PDFs to emails, the amount of time you’re wasting per year adds up if you aren’t using invoice automation tools. You also run the risk of email with PDF attachments being blocked by SPAM filters.\n\nThese solutions help greatly reduce or eliminate human error especially when they are part of accounting systems like Xero. No more manual double entry means more accurate billing and better customer relationships.\n\nYou will be able to directly tie in electronic payment options for the convenience of your client and for the benefit of your accounts receivables team. This will accelerate payments and also offer an easier way to incentivize early payments.\n\nWith electronic invoices, you will be creating a digital audit trail to protect yourself against problems collecting past due payments that may end up with a collections agency or law firm.\n\nThis process will reduce wasteful paper and inefficient mail processes that are especially impacted by more work-from-home staff members.\n\neInvoices give your team better visibility, especially if you tie in account receivable automation solutions like HappyAR.\n\nAbout the Market and Alternative Solutions to Check Out\n\nThe big Xero competitor is QuickBooks, specifically QuickBooks Online. Any evaluation for small business and small accounting agency software solutions should include the Xero accounting software suite and QuickBooks.\n\nWe also think that FreshBooks and Sage Intacct are good SMB options to review. If you are a small business, be careful with more advanced enterprise accounting solutions that may have too much functionality, are difficult to self-implement, and are costly. If you are a larger organization (maybe with over 100 employees) or have a high volume of invoices, looking at mid-size and enterprise solutions would be smart to do.\n\nAgencies should consider solutions that allow for multiple client views and address the needs of the companies they serve.\n\nInvoicing software like Bill.com and Invoiced help to streamline the online invoicing and receivables process without full accounting functionality. These may be good options for companies that have an existing accounting platform but wish to enhance the AP/AR functionality or for those that use an outsourced bookkeeper or accounting firm but elects to send invoices themselves.\n\nYou may want to consider an option that has seamless integration with your CRM system in order to capture a complete view of your sales and collection lifecycle and the activity happening with each client.\n\nNote that HappyAR has an open API and connects to all of these major systems to even further improve the collections process.\n\nWith all software reviews, we suggest using G2 as an impartial evaluation source.\n\nAbout HappyAR and our Xero Invoicing integration\n\nHappyAR is a seamless SaaS that quickly and easily boosts your accounts receivables work.\n\nWe save companies of all sizes thousands of dollars each year by optimizing the speed and efficiency of their collections methods.

Visit us at www.happyar.com to learn more.\n\nKeeping your company in the black by properly invoicing your customers means providing them with information on their bills that clearly communicates what you expect. Aside from the total amount due, the most important number that your invoices should feature is known as the balance forward.\n\nWhat Is the Balance Forward?\n\nThe balance forward shows the sum of the previous balance (if a client has unpaid invoices or a delinquent previous bill) from a specific date range.\n\nThis should be added to a customer’s current balance to show the total amount due. Depending on how long it’s been since the customer last paid, the balance forward may even take into account non-payment from the prior fiscal year.\n\nThis number can also be zero if there is no outstanding money due from a previous statement. In other words, it can also show an opening balance.\n\nBank account ledgers also show balance forwards. For example, if you were looking at a bank account statement for 2021, it might show a detailed list of the current year’s transactions underneath last year’s final balance.\n\nIf a negative number appears, this means there was an overpayment on the part of the customer. You can handle this in several ways.\n\nOne method is issuing a credit balance to the customer that will go toward their next bill. You may also refund the overpaid amount to their bank account. A negative invoice charge is another way to apply the overpayment to the next bill.\n\nWhat is a Balance Forward Statement?\n\nA balance forward statement is a single page or document that lists all payment activity that falls in a specific date range.\n\nThis statement will show the previous balance at the top to show how the balance forward has been calculated.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that this statement doesn’t necessarily show the current amount that a customer owes because it’s only used to refer to a set time period. For this reason, a balance forward statement is different from accounts receivable, which gives the current balance owed.\n\nMake the Balance Forward Obvious\n\nIt’s important to give customers visual cues on their bills to show them exactly what you want them to do and where they need to look for information.\n\nThe balance due portion of a bill is usually the place you’ll want to guide a customer’s eyes, so you’ll need to make the wording, formats, and design instructional.\n\nFor simplicity, many bills feature a box at the top of the page that shows the amount of the last payment, the date of the last payment received, and the balance forward, in that order.\n\nThe main body of the bill will show the current date range’s payment due, adding this to the previous balance to arrive at the amount the customer needs to pay. Including a due date and payment terms can help the customer maintain positive standing with their accounts.\n\nHow Balance Forward Helps with Planning\n\nThe more information a customer has, the better. You want them to pay their bills so your company maintains healthy cash flow, while they don’t want to be delinquent on payments.\n\nGiving your customers a balance forward statement shows them more information than just the total amount due. By understanding the amount they owe for unpaid invoices to make their accounts current, the balance forward helps them see their current standing.\n\nBecause credit scores determine buying power in so many areas of life, these statements help customers to avoid interest payments and maintain healthy credit.\n\nWhen the customer can determine what their proper allocation of funds should be, they are in a better position to stay out of debt and send your company payments in a timely manner.\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nOn your end of the payment chain, you’ll need to keep a balance sheet of accounts receivable for each customer. This will tell you the entirety of what the customer owes. Instead of focusing on a specific date range, accounts receivable will refer to all outstanding debts for a given client.\n\nAccounts Payable\n\nAccounts payable refers to what you owe other companies. When you receive a bill for services rendered by another company, accounts payable is where those payments will need to be logged.\n\nWhat is an Open Item?\n\nOpen items and balance forwards are similar but differ in a fundamental way. While the balance forward amount shows outstanding payments from a specific date range, the open item shows all outstanding payments.\n\nWhether your bills and invoices will show an open item or balance forward amount will depend on how your company makes a customer’s account balance current. If your business provides a grace period for one bill payment before default, then you would probably only ever show a customer their remaining balance forward amount.\n\nBalance Forward in 401(k) and Sharing Plans\n\nFor another look at the term “balance forward,” let’s turn our attention to 401(k) accounts. In this context, a balance forward plan is a 401(k) or another type of sharing plan that values accounts on a monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, or even yearly basis, as opposed to daily.\n\nGenerally, balance forward plans are only done with pooled investments.\n\nWith valuation happening so infrequently, the account providers can’t show their customers’ the current value of their accounts. Plan assets will likely be different from the last valuation, especially in a turbulent market.\n\nIf an account valuation shows $500,000, but it dropped because the market took a downturn, the actual value could be far less. If the customers’ retirement plan terminates after this downturn, they may not realize that they’re not getting the full valuation they expect.\n\nMost plans take market fluctuations into account. If a participant requests payment of the balance, they’ll receive anywhere from 75% to 90% of the current valuation. Once the next valuation is calculated, the participant will receive the remaining balance.\n\nAdvance of Technology\n\nObviously, a balance forward sharing plan is not ideal. Since the advent of computer tracking tools for stocks, bonds, and other investments, plans that show current, accurate valuations have nearly made balance forward plans a thing of the past.\n\nFor accuracy’s sake, most people prefer to use plans that offer daily valuations. Most investment plans are moving away from balance forwards for this very reason.\n\nBetter Invoicing\n\nGiving a balance forward statement helps all parties to stay on top of their unpaid invoices and other debts. By structuring an invoice with this essential information in a logical place that is easily seen, the customer can track their debts, which makes it more likely that they’ll pay them in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nHaving the right structure in place for your statements can also help any employees who are responsible for keeping tabs on the flow of money coming in and out of the organization.\n\nWhether you rely on software to automatically tabulate payments or you use templates for manual entry, remove human error from the equation as much as possible. Find layouts that are easy to read and easy to use, both for your employees and for the clients that receive your statements.\n\nWith a firm understanding of the purpose of balance forward statements, you can use them effectively to keep your books up to date and error-free, all while encouraging your clients to pay their debts on time\n\nHappyAR is an ever-evolving toolkit that helps optimize your invoice collections process and our solution starts at $0/month and scales up based on your invoice volume.

Make sure to follow us as we continue to post new guides that can help companies of all sizes.\n\nA liquidity ratio indicates whether your company’s current assets (liquid assets) will be sufficient to meet your short-term obligations when they become due.\n\nThis calculation is going to be primarily used by lenders and investors, but it’s also a good way to understand the current financial health of your business. It would be a good idea to periodically run one or more of the common ratios on your own or with your accountant.\n\nWhat’s Considered a “Good” Liquidity Ratio?\n\nA good ratio will be subjective based on a lot of factors with your business (like age and industry), but anything below 1 is generally considered risky for lenders and investors. Aim for a ratio of 1.25 or higher, but don’t panic if you’re not there. Cost-cutting and accounts payable automation, and accounts receivable automation can rapidly improve your financial ratios, cash flow, and company’s liquidity and can impact your approvals for future borrowings.\n\nOptimizing your accounts payable processes can help ensure cash flow. Automation can help remind clients of discounts in return for quicker payments, accelerate unpaid invoices, prioritize collection efforts for customers with large payment balances, and define weekly cash collection targets. AR software can help you send accurate invoices, provide your team with payment and follow-up visibility, and use the accounts receivable turnover ratio to help you track progress.\n\nThis guide includes general industry ratios broken down by year and may be a useful guide to benchmark your business: https://www.readyratios.com/sec/ratio/current-ratio/\n\nA Quick Guide to liquidity ratios:\n\nBefore we get into some of the types of liquidity ratios that are used, let’s get some basic definitions out of the way:\n\nCash equivalents: debt securities with maturities of less than 90 days. Cash equivalents do not include equity or stock holdings because they can fluctuate in value.\n\nCurrent assets: may include cash, inventory, accounts receivable, marketable securities, supplies, and prepaid expenses.\n\nCurrent liabilities: financial obligations that are payable within a year, not long-term debt. Examples of current liabilities include accounts payable, short-term debt, dividends, and notes payable as well as income taxes owed.\n\nLiquidity: the ability to cover short-term obligations.\n\nSolvency: ability to pay long-term obligations\n\nQuick assets: assets owned by a company with a commercial or exchange value that can easily be converted into cash or that are already in a cash form.\n\nIt’s important to note the difference between a liquidity ratio and a solvency ratio. A solvency ratio includes financial obligations in both the long and short term, whereas liquidity ratios focus more on a company’s short-term debt obligations and current assets. In this article, we’re only focusing on liquidity ratios.\n\nThree Common Liquidity Ratios:\n\nThe current ratio, also known as the working capital ratio\n\nAcid test ratio, also known as quick ratio\n\nCash ratio, also known as cash asset ratio\n\nThe current ratio, AKA the working capital ratio, measures your company’s ability to pay off short-term debt obligations with current assets.\n\nThe formula for calculating the current ratio is as follows:\n\nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nLiquidity Ratio Details:\n\nA higher liquidity ratio is generally considered better, and as mentioned before, aim for some margin of safety with at least a 1.25. Anything below 1 indicates an issue with the ability of a company to pay for short-term liabilities and current debts and will likely be a red flag to investors and lenders and should motivate you to make some immediate changes if you’re looking to borrow or raise funds.\n\nThe acid test ratio, AKA the quick ratio is more conservative than the current ratio since it removes assets that are most difficult to convert to cash in 90 days: inventory, supplies, and prepaid expenses.\n\nA prepaid expense is a type of asset on the balance sheet that results from a business making advanced payments for goods or services to be received in the future. Prepaid expenses are initially recorded as assets, but their value is expensed over time onto the income statement. Unlike conventional expenses, the business will receive something of value from the prepaid expense over the course of several accounting periods.\n\nThe formula to calculate the acid test ratio is:\n\nAcid Test Ratio = (Total Current Assets – Inventory – Supplies – Prepaid Expenses) / Current Liabilities\n\nIf you run both the acid test ratio and the current ratio and find the numbers to be way different, that could indicate that you are relying heavily on inventory. Depreciation may also need to be factored in which could change the ratio. This might be a result of the industry you’re in. Retail and manufacturing ratios may be impacted more than professional services and SaaS companies.\n\nWhat is a Cash Ratio?\n\nCash ratio, also called cash asset ratio, is the most conservative of the three ratios and looks at the ratio of cash and cash equivalent assets to your total liabilities.\n\nThe ratio indicates the extent to which available funds can pay off current liabilities.\n\nThe formula for calculating the cash ratio is:\n\nCash Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalent) / Current Liabilities\n\nIf the cash ratio is equal to 1, the business has the exact amount of cash and cash equivalents to pay off the debts. If the cash ratio is less than 1, there’s not enough cash on hand to pay off short-term debt.\n\nWhen your company’s cash ratio is too high, you may be missing opportunities for short-term investments or other growth initiatives.\n\nFollow HappyAR’s AR University for more quick finance learning opportunities, like this one on liquidity ratio analysis, intended for busy executives that are interested in gaining a better understanding of the health of their business and their balance sheet.\n\nHappyAR is a seamless SaaS that quickly and easily boosts your accounts receivables work.

For example, if an email is opened, but not replied to, a follow-up is sent two days later.\n\nWorkflows automatically end when a credit card, ACH, wire, or paper check payment is updated in the accounting system or can be manually paused or completed.\n\nThe collections manager will now have a fully exportable activity audit trail that can be sent to collections companies and your law firm for the most challenging debts.\n\nAdditional benefits:\n\nA collections manager will have a bird’ eye view of the entire past due invoice workload. They can easily track historical performance and see what may need additional efforts.\n\nBecause a collections manager is typically involved in technology purchases related to that function, seamless integrations are super easy.
