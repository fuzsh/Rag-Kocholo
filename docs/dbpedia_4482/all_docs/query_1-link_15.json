        "text": "The year was 1998… cell phones were big, boy bands were bigger, and “the cloud” was something you saw in the sky – that is, until we came along as the first cloud company and ushered in the new era of technology. Once a pipe dream, the cloud has become the backbone of today’s most successful businesses. Since day one, NetSuite was built to help leaders run their businesses better, and we’ve continued to grow because our customers continue to grow. Now 25 years later, the idea of the suite has never been more important. ☁️ Thank you to everyone who's been on this incredible journey with us. We can’t wait for the next 25!"
