        "text": "Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another great quarter. When you look at the top of our financial results table, a few things are very clear. The largest number, Cloud Services and License Support is now 74% of the revenue, and its recurring revenue and it's the one growing by $1 billion this quarter. The smaller numbers, which are not recurring, now account for only 26%. This is exactly what we told you would happen and it's happening. And as this continues, total revenue growth will accelerate every year.\n\nTo that point, OCI is now one of the clear drivers of our acceleration. Imagine just 3 years ago, OCI was rarely, if ever, mentioned as a viable hyperscale alternative. Of course, we knew what we had built and we kept talking about it, and we knew it was only a matter of time. And now more industry analysts are catching on to what customers are choosing. For example, just last week, we were recognized as a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services.\n\nOur financial results reflect that customers have figured out that by moving to OCI, they really can get more while paying less. On top of that, we are now the default choice for AI workloads, given our unique differentiation and price performance capabilities. Why specifically are they coming to Oracle cloud infrastructure? Well, it's a combination of several things, creating the second-generation cloud enabled us to building much better, more scalable and more efficient cloud. We understood the limitations of the first generation and engineered very differently.\n\nSecond, we know what it takes to run an enterprise scale, performance and security better than, I'd say, anyone else. Our 45-year history as the leading enterprise software company gives us unique knowledge of what exactly is required to run mission-critical systems. Third, we recognized that customers need deployment flexibility. Rather than just offer public cloud services like our competitors, we are the only vendor which also offers dedicated Cloud at Customer, dedicated regions, sovereign clouds and Alloy, our partner cloud.\n\nAnd then finally, our belief in the importance of multi-cloud offerings will be industry-changing as these collaborations roll out. With all this success and exploding demand, we are working as quickly as we can to get the cloud capacity built out with total revenue at the midpoint of my constant currency guidance and EPS at the high end of guidance. Now as a reminder, currency was 1 point less helpful than when we gave guidance 3 months ago.\n\nTotal cloud revenue, that's SaaS plus IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4.1 billion, up 25%. Including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 24% at $4.8 billion, with IaaS revenue at $1.6 billion, up 50% and SaaS revenue of $3.2 billion, up 14%. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 11%, driven again by our strategic cloud application, autonomous database and our Gen2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include support, were $4.5 billion, up 9%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $7.1 billion and were up 19%.\n\nInfrastructure subscription revenues, which include License Support, were $5.2 billion, up 12%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 50%. Excluding legacy hosting services, Gen2 infrastructure Cloud Services revenue grew 55% with an annualized revenue of $6 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 71%. Database subscription revenues, which include database license support, were up 4%, highlighted by Exadata database cloud services revenue, which was up 40% and autonomous database up 26%.\n\nVery importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and Gen2 OCI. Software license revenues were $1.2 billion, down 19% in a tough comparison to last year where it was up 23%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.9 billion, up 4%, including Cerner, actually up 6% excluding Cerner.\n\nNow shifting to margins. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 78%. This is because of the mix between Support and Cloud, in which Cloud is growing much faster than Support, Support and SaaS margins are consistent with last year, while IaaS gross margins improved substantially. While we continue to build data center capacity, gross margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. We monitor these expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale.\n\nTo this point, the gross profit dollars of Cloud Services and License Support grew 10% in Q2. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.5 billion, up 7% from last year. The operating margin was 43%, up from 41% last year. As we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income but we will also expand the operating margin. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.34 in USD, up 11% in USD and up 9% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.89 in USD.\n\nAt quarter end, we had nearly $8.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.9 billion, up 1%. Over the last 4 quarters, operating cash flow was $17 billion, up 13%, and free cash flow was $10.1 billion, up 20%. Capital expenditures were $6.9 billion over the same period as we continue to see cash flow benefit from our cloud transformation.\n\nOur remaining performance obligation, or RPO, is now over $65 billion, with the portion excluding Cerner up 11% in constant currency. We continue to sign large deals with many in the pipeline. Approximately 48% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx was $1.1 billion in Q2 as we continue to build capacity for bookings and our customers' growing needs. Given the enormity of our pipeline and backlog, I expect CapEx will be somewhere around $8 billion this fiscal year, meaning our second half CapEx will be considerably higher as we bring online more capacity.\n\nTo that point, we now have 66 customer-facing cloud regions live, with 45 public cloud regions around the world and another 6 being built. 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Azure, and starting next year, customers will be able to run Oracle Database at Azure on OCI inside Azure. We also have 10 dedicated regions live and 13 more planned, 9 national security regions and 2 EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each.\n\nAnd finally, we have 7 Alloy cloud regions planned where Oracle partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside the Oracle Cloud. And of course, we also have so many, many, many Cloud at Customer installations. The sizing and flexibility -- the sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be advantageous for us in the marketplace.\n\nAnd finally, as we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for a total of $450 million. And in addition, we paid out dividends of $4.1 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share.\n\nNow let me turn to my guidance for Q3, which I will review, as always, on a non-GAAP basis. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have little effect on total revenue and EPS. However, the actual currency impact may be different. So because of that, all the numbers I give you are the same for constant currency and USD. Total revenues, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 6% to 8%. Total revenues, excluding Cerner, are expected to grow from 8% to 10%.\n\nTotal cloud revenue, excluding Cerner, is expected to grow from 26% to 28%. Non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to grow between 10% and 14% and be between $1.35 and $1.39. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. Finally, I remain firmly committed to our fiscal '26 financial goals for revenue, operating margins and EPS growth. And with that, let me turn it over to Larry for his comments.\n\nOkay. Our customers are very happy with the idea. Remember, Oracle started as one of the first databases that ran everywhere. We ran on IBM mainframes. We ran on personal computers. We ran on digital equipment, if you remember them, many computers. And HP mini computers. We ran on every operating system on every computer. Now in cloud, they're very happy to see that they can not only get the Oracle database at OCI, they can also get the identical capability from Microsoft. Microsoft, we are building data centers for Microsoft inside Azure. And Microsoft, it wasn't us that decided 2,000 was the right number of Exadata machines to install in those 20 data centers. That was Microsoft. The demand is enormous. They want the same -- plus our customers want the same flexibility they've always had with Oracle. They want to use Oracle, they want to transition. But if they're using the Microsoft cloud, they want to run the best and latest and greatest version of Oracle in the Microsoft Cloud. They want to do that in other clouds as well. Some of them is very important to have it. In Japan, for example, it's very important for some of that data remaining in Japan. One of the things the Oracle database does is it runs the Tokyo Stock Exchange. And it does that in a dedicated data center run by Nomura Research who supplies financial services and Oracle Cloud, Oracle Gen2 Cloud Services to the Japanese market. There are a number of other partners in Japan that are going in that same direction. So they used to -- in Japan, they used to buy the Oracle database from Nomura or they used to buy it from Fujitsu or they bought it from Hitachi or they bought it from NEC. They wanted that Oracle database. It is quite natural for all of those companies to build their own -- have their own dedicated regions of OCI and sell to their -- and support their customers out of those regions. That's the flexibility we allow that something that nobody else can do. We can build these regions for our partners. We can build these regions for sovereign states. We can build these regions for large companies that want to have -- that don't want their data commingled with anyone else's. They want a public cloud. They want a full OCI. They want every part of OCI, but they don't want anyone else in that -- in their region. They want it to be theirs and theirs alone. We can do that. Nobody else can."
