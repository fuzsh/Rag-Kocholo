        "text": "This page is a digest about this topic. It is a compilation from various blogs that discuss it. Each title is linked to the original blog.\n\n1.The Birth of NetSuite[Original Blog]\n\nIn the early 1990s, cloud computing was not yet a buzzword, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software was only available to large companies with deep pockets. small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) were left to rely on spreadsheets and manual processes to manage their operations. This is where Evan Goldberg, the founder of NetSuite, saw an opportunity to disrupt the ERP market and democratize access to business software.\n\n1. The birth of NetSuite\n\nGoldberg founded NetSuite in 1998 under the name NetLedger, with the goal of providing SMBs with a cloud-based erp solution that would be affordable and easy to use. The company's first product, NetLedger Accounting, was launched in 1999 and quickly gained traction among SMBs. NetLedger later rebranded as NetSuite, and expanded its product offering to include CRM, e-commerce, and professional services automation.\n\n2. The early challenges\n\nIn the early days, NetSuite faced several challenges. One of the biggest was convincing SMBs to trust their financial data to a cloud-based system. Many businesses were skeptical of the security and reliability of the cloud, and preferred to keep their data on-premise. To address these concerns, NetSuite invested heavily in security and compliance, and built a robust data center infrastructure.\n\n3. The acquisition by Oracle\n\nIn 2016, NetSuite was acquired by Oracle for $9.3 billion. The acquisition was controversial, as NetSuite had always positioned itself as a challenger to Oracle's dominance in the ERP market. However, Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle and a major shareholder in NetSuite, saw the potential for NetSuite to become a key part of Oracle's cloud strategy.\n\n4. The integration with Oracle\n\nSince the acquisition, NetSuite has been integrated into Oracle's cloud offerings, and has become a key component of Oracle's strategy to compete with other cloud providers such as amazon Web services and Microsoft Azure. The integration has also allowed NetSuite to leverage Oracle's vast resources and expertise in areas such as AI and machine learning.\n\n5. The legacy of NetSuite\n\nNetSuite's legacy is one of innovation and disruption. The company was a pioneer in cloud-based ERP, and helped to democratize access to business software for SMBs. Today, NetSuite continues to be a leader in the ERP market, and its integration with Oracle has only strengthened its position.\n\nNetSuite's birth and evolution is a testament to the power of innovation and disruption in the technology industry. By democratizing access to ERP software, NetSuite has helped to level the playing field for SMBs, and has paved the way for other cloud-based software providers to follow. The acquisition by Oracle and the subsequent integration has only strengthened NetSuite's position, and has ensured that its legacy will continue for years to come."
