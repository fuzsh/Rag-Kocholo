        "text": "Subscribe to the GoEngineer Blog!\n\nArticle by Sam Oanes on Feb 12, 2024\n\nAs we know, every year, SOLIDWORKS releases a new version with hundreds of new features and functionalities. Ninety percent of these enhancements come straight from you, the customer. While thinking about how much it has changed since I started, I decided to compile the highlights of SOLIDWORKS through the years. We tend to take many of these enhancements for granted now, but they were truly groundbreaking at the time they were released. From innovative new functionalities to all-new product offerings, this blog post will put you in a time machine and take you on a journey through the history of SOLIDWORKS.\n\nIt all started in 1993 when founder Jon Hirschtick recruited a team of engineers with the purpose of making 3D CAD more accessible. Hirschtick used $1 million that he earned while a member of the acclaimed MIT Blackjack Team to get his new venture off the ground. The team’s goal was to build an easy-to-use, affordable software built on the Windows platform. This was truly revolutionary; all other popular CAD systems were built on Unix at the time. After a couple of years in development, the initial release of SOLIDWORKS finally came...\n\n1995\n\nSOLIDWORKS launches at a price point of only $4,000; compared to $18,000 for other CAD systems.\n\nThe software was easier to use: a user could become comfortable with only 3 months of experience, compared to 3 years with other CAD software on the market. A large part of the ease-of-use was due to being on the modern, well-known Windows interface.\n\nThe visualization of the model was unprecedented. Building features in a fully-lit, shaded environment was a stark contrast to the traditional modeling space which only showed a wireframe against a black background\n\nA similar FeatureManager to what we are familiar with now was used to show the history of how a model was built\n\nParts, assemblies, and drawings were all available from the start. Users couldn’t apply mates in assemblies yet, but could still place components into position\n\n1996\n\nIn-context modeling was introduced. This allowed for the top-down assembly modeling method to be used.\n\nUsers could now use mates in assemblies and capture dynamic assembly motion. Along with interference detection, users could verify form, fit, and function much more easily\n\nDrag and drop functionality for moving one assembly component into another assembly\n\nConfigurations in parts\n\nAutomated Bill of Materials. There was only one way with no customization options, but it worked\n\n1997\n\nSheet metal functionalities were released for the first time\n\nLibrary features were now available\n\nThe Loft feature could now use guide curves\n\nSOLIDWORKS acquired by Dassault Systemes\n\n1997+\n\nFace fillets introduced\n\nAssembly configurations\n\nFully customizable exploded views of assemblies\n\nSOLIDWORKS Viewer was introduced as a free product to share designs with non-CAD users and protect intellectual property when sharing data with external parties\n\n1998\n\nFeature palette released, which is now similar to what the Design Library does. Pre-made features that can be dragged and dropped onto the model\n\nSketch diagnostics to help the user understand why a sketch wouldn’t work for a particular feature\n\nTangency controls for Lofts and Sweeps\n\nAssembly envelopes\n\n1998+\n\nSmart mates to make more use of drag-and-drop automation in building assemblies\n\nLightweight components to help performance as users continually made larger and larger assemblies\n\nSurfacing tools introduced for the first time\n\nFeatureWorks for imported files, to be able to use existing 3D data from other software more effectively\n\nFirst CSWP exam released. It was hand-written and sent in via mail\n\n1999\n\nFirst SOLIDWORKS World in Palm Springs\n\nReal-time collision detection for assemblies when dragging components\n\n3D Sketch introduced\n\nPiping module released\n\n2D command emulator to help bridge the gap for previous users of AutoCAD\n\n2000\n\neDrawings released\n\nHole Wizard interface implemented\n\nSurfacing made more useful with the ability to knit, trim, and extend surfaces\n\nSOLIDWORKS Explorer\n\nDynamic clearance detection to verify minimum gaps are maintained between assembly components\n\n2001\n\nMirror components in assemblies\n\nHeads up interactions. Previously, in any CAD system, the software would bring up an entire dialog on top of the model whenever a command was selected. SOLIDWORKS started doing away with this and moved toward the PropertyManagers we know now with shaded callouts back to the model\n\nFlexible subassemblies were now allowed, to further capture accurate assembly motion\n\nFill surface command introduced\n\nDXF/DWG Import Wizard was released\n\n3D Meeting, which was eventually retired a few releases later. Leveraged Microsoft Live Meeting and allowed for real-time synchronous meeting with screen sharing\n\n2001+\n\nMotion simulation capabilities can now capture actual physical dynamics of components moving in an assembly\n\nLarge Assembly Mode introduced\n\n2D to 3D conversion tools were implemented to allow for 2D CAD data to be easily converted into a fully functional 3D model\n\nSOLIDWORKS Office introduced, packaging commonly used add-ins like PhotoWorks, Toolbox, Utilities, and FeatureWorks into one product offering\n\nDassault Systemes acquired SRAC and began bringing simulation into the mainstream design process\n\n2003\n\nCOSMOSXpress, the first Xpress product, brought simple part validation onto every desktop\n\n3DContentCentral provided users a community to interact and share their models\n\nMulti-body part design.
