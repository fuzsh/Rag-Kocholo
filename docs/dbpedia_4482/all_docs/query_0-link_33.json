        "text": "Q: How does Oracle NetSuite enhance data visibility for clients, and what strategies does it offer for data monetization and cost reduction?\n\nA: NetSuite was founded in 1998 by Evan Goldberg with a mission to deliver a unified and agile application that businesses can rely on to grow. After being acquired by Oracle in late 2016, it now operates as a business unit within Oracle, specifically targeting growing companies. As companies grow rapidly, they outgrow manual processes, such as spreadsheets, and require more robust tools for customer management, sales forecasting, financial control, and accounting. NetSuite provides a unified cloud business system, integrating financials and accounting, inventory management, HR, professional services automation, and omnichannel commerce so that businesses have a single source of truth for business intelligence and automate repetitive tasks.\n\nOracle’s acquisition of NetSuite further enhanced its ability to invest in regions like Mexico. NetSuite's functionality has evolved to include more robust data security, mobile capabilities, and embedded AI, offering growing companies the visibility and control they need to make informed decisions about investments, hiring, and expansion, among other areas. NetSuite's cloud-based platform ensures that all users have access to the same version of the software. It offers a comprehensive suite of applications tailored to the needs of growing companies, providing essential information for decision-making and helping to increase efficiency.\n\nQ: What advantages does NetSuite provide to Mexican companies over other cloud-based platforms?\n\nA: NetSuite started in the cloud as the first cloud computing company, establishing a distinctive edge over other companies that later migrated to the cloud. Our product, methodology, and learning resources are all cloud-based. NetSuite is also tailored to the local market with currency, tax and language capabilities, and it is where we have established one of our largest operations in Latin America over the past 12 years.\n\nThrough SuiteSuccess, we are able to identify best practices among our more than 37,000 customers and offer pre-built solutions tailored to specific sectors, improving customer success. This approach expedites sales, adoption, and learning processes for our customers, as they receive solutions customized to their industry needs.\n\nQ: How does AI integration assist in decision-making by automating repetitive tasks?\n\nA: We integrated traditional AI features into our system to enhance efficiency and decision-making. These features generate unique insights, expand visibility, and automate tasks such as bank reconciliation and invoice capture. We are now advancing further by incorporating generative AI to help organizations reach their goals faster and more efficiently. This evolution reflects our commitment to continually enhance NetSuite's capabilities, providing customers with increasingly intelligent and intuitive solutions that empower them to thrive in their respective industries.\n\nQ: How are enterprise resource planning (ERP) services evolving and how will they benefit from generative AI?\n\nA: Kavak, a Mexican unicorn specializing in buying and selling used cars, is a good example of the optimal use of an ERP. Its business model highlights the evolving needs of modern enterprises, particularly in contrast to traditional ERP systems, which were rigid and lacked flexibility. Kavak acquired its NetSuite solution prior to the pandemic but, when the pandemic hit and disrupted the business, it swiftly pivoted its operations. Instead of solely selling cars, it began offering financing services, purchasing cars and reselling them to customers with financing options. This shift required a dynamic cloud ERP system capable of adapting to its changing business model seamlessly. NetSuite proved instrumental in automating Kavak’s operations. The agility afforded by NetSuite allowed Kavak to effectively navigate the pandemic, demonstrating the platform's ability to support innovative business models.\n\nNetSuite's ongoing integration of AI further enhances its capabilities, making teams incredibly productive and giving leaders an extra help to reach their goals faster. By analyzing broad organization-wide data collected throughout our unified suite it can produce new and deeper business insights. This is exemplified by our extensive customer portfolio, which provides invaluable feedback for continuous improvement and innovation. Our clients span diverse industries, from sugar producers like Ingenio Santos to cutting-edge startups like Kavak and cryptocurrency firms like Bitso. This diversity underscores NetSuite's versatility and adaptability to meet the needs of businesses across various sectors. As we continue to develop AI functionality, our goal remains to empower the next generation of businesses with the tools they need to thrive in an ever-evolving marketplace.\n\nQ: How have advances in data visibility and ERP maturity influenced digital transformation priorities among customers?\n\nA: ERP is the cornerstone of every company because it simultaneously serves as both the heart and the brain, fed by the lifeblood of the business – data. It forms the core around which the community and operations revolve. It ensures daily operations run smoothly, while also functioning as the brain, providing insights to make strategic decisions about the future, such as launching new products or services. The best decisions and the latest AI innovations rely on quality data, which is enhanced by a unified suite of applications that operates off a shared data model.\n\nIn their digital transformation, companies initially focus on ensuring operational continuity by implementing ERP systems. We encourage our customers to “SuiteUP” and expand into new modules to keep as much of their data in a single integrated system. As they progress to the second stage of the digital transformation, the data quality that exists within an integration suite helps to unlock more capabilities and better performance as they begin to leverage traditional and generative AI.\n\nBy using more modules and features within their ERP systems, companies can further integrate their operations and gain greater visibility to increase profitability and achieve faster growth. It is important to note that ERP systems do not replace human decision-making, but rather simplify it by providing valuable insights and automating routine tasks. This allows employees to dedicate more time to strategic activities like market development and innovation.\n\nQ: Considering the nearshoring ambitions of Mexican companies, how has Oracle NetSuite adapted its solutions portfolio to address the unique needs of businesses in the region?\n\nA: There are numerous manufacturing companies coming to Mexico. In response, we have launched a manufacturing-specific solution. This initiative aims to streamline and facilitate the implementation process for these companies, significantly reducing their time to market compared to other available solutions. Using the recently-launched NetSuite Analytics Warehouse, businesses can gain valuable AI-powered insights from their data – both external data and NetSuite data – and make informed decisions to drive their business forward.\n\nQ: What specific functionalities or features within Oracle NetSuite support companies engaged in nearshoring initiatives?\n\nA: We made substantial investments in the region to better serve our customers and help them improve the agility of their operations. In addition to our tailored industry approach, we offer NetSuite Advanced Customer Support to assist customers post-implementation. This service goes beyond traditional support by providing dedicated hours for customers to seek guidance and assistance on optimizing their use of NetSuite for their specific needs. It matches consultants with clients' unique business requirements, serving as an extension of the company team. This level of support, provided in Spanish by local experts who understand Mexican localization requirements, sets us apart from other global vendors.\n\nQ: What specific short-term goals and objectives is NetSuite prioritizing ?\n\nA: We will host our event series SuiteConnect in Mexico City in the next couple months. This is an important addition to our global event lineup that complements our annual user conference event: SuiteWorld. SuiteConnect will unveil a plethora of new features, modules, and AI advancements. At the same time, it offers an amazing space for learning and networking and gives companies the ability to explore other modules in the suite to help.\n\nQ: What are Oracle NetSuite's ambitions and strategic goals for 2024 in Mexico and Latin America?\n\nA: Our goal is to become the go-to solution for every entrepreneur and fast growing organization seeking to establish or expand their presence in Mexico and Latin America. Leveraging our cutting-edge technology and tailored industry solutions, we strive to democratize access to our system, empowering growing companies to transform their ideas into successful ventures. With hundreds of customers already benefiting from our solutions in Mexico and thousands across the region, we are committed to helping entrepreneurs and growing businesses. We possess not only the product and methodology but also maintain a strong local presence with dedicated teams and robust support services tailored to meet the needs of Mexican organizations."
