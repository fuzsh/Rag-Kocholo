Here's the next 25 years now. Sweet. From the start with those four Oracle guys above the hair salon to today with thousands of employees, partners and 10s of thousands of customers, it's been an amazing ride. Congratulations next week on 25 very successful years. Happy 25th anniversary next week and here's to the next 25 years. Congratulations Nest Suite on 25 years.
