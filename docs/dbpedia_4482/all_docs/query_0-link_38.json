        "text": "The ERP selection process is tedious—and rightfully so. The system you choose will inevitably become the backbone of your business processes for years to come.\n\nSelect the right one, and you’ll be well on your way to being a more efficient business; choose the wrong one, and you’ll find yourself wrestling with all kinds of bottlenecks and complications. Worst case, you might run your business processes to a grinding halt.\n\nBelow we compare two well-known ERP providers: NetSuite vs Great Plains (Microsoft Dynamics GP). Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, with different competencies depending on business use-cases and implementation.\n\nAt the end of this article, you will gain better perspective on the NetSuite vs Great Plains debate and, hopefully, get one step closer to finding the right ERP software for your business.\n\nNetSuite vs Great Plains: A Brief History and Evolution\n\nNetSuite\n\nNetSuite, was founded in 1998 by Evan Goldberg. The company started out as a web-hosted accounting management software, but quickly evolved into an end-to-end cloud-based solution for ERP, financial planning, and omnichannel commerce.\n\nIn 2016, NetSuite was acquired by Oracle for an estimated $9.3 billion. Today, the company serves over 16,000 customers in more than 200 countries and territories, and is widely considered a pioneer in the cloud-based software space.\n\nGreat Plains\n\nGreat Plains has an extremely rich history predating Microsoft Dynamics. The software traces its origins to 1983 in Ohio, where Solomon Software (originally TLB) built an accounting system called Solomon I. Through the years, Solomon I (and subsequent versions up to Solomon IV) gained widespread acclaim, impressing both users and software pundits.\n\nSolomon Software was acquired by Great Plains Software in 2000 and by Microsoft in 2001. In 2004, Microsoft released Great Plains and three other solutions under the Microsoft Business Solutions suite. Microsoft Business Solutions rebranded to Microsoft Dynamics in 2006, offering better integration within its suite of ERP products.\n\nThe software is now better known as Microsoft Dynamics GP.\n\nComprehensive Comparison: NetSuite vs Great Plains\n\nCurious about the cost?\n\nCalculate your NetSuite Price now!\n\nDetailed Review: Features & Functions of NetSuite and Great Plains\n\nCurious about the cost?\n\nCalculate your NetSuite Price now!\n\nCustomer Support & Training: NetSuite and Great Plains Evaluated\n\nKey Differences Between NetSuite and Great Plains\n\nThe Great Plains application played an important role in an era of on-premise ERP deployments. However this mode of software investments & deployment is going by the wayside. On-premise software requires substantial hardware investments, larger IT budgets, and challenging upgrade cycles, which is why NetSuite introduced the idea of a fully cloud-based business solution. No hardware or IT supervision necessary!\n\nBest of all NetSuite offers seamless twice a year upgrades that eliminate version lock and ensures you are running the latest and greatest software available.\n\nOther major differentiators...\n\nMicrosoft GP relies on batch processing – which can cause reconciliation issues at month end, if someone forgets to post in one of the modules.\n\nCustomizing native reports is difficult in GP. Ironically reports do not easily export into Excel, you have to format and \"pretty up\" each time. NetSuite maintains the report format and even the formula in Excel saving you time.\n\nGreat Plains does not offer any dashboards or KPIs whereas NetSuite's offers pre-packaged dashboards and KPI's to provide deeper insights in real-time.\n\nThe biggest difference between NetSuite vs Great Plains is that NetSuite is an industry leading all-in-one cloud-ERP solution, while GP is an aging accounting application but don't just take our word for it.\n\nLeading industry analyst Gartner, named NetSuite a \"leader\" as one of only three ERP solutions listed in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Cloud Core Financial Management Suites for Midsize, Large and Global Enterprises.\n\nOther points to consider...\n\nGreat Plains still carries some legacy architecture that isn’t cloud native, which means certain processes can only be completed by batch. Additionally, financial consolidation via its General Ledger (GL) can only be done manually, and some transaction details get lost in translation once the GL is consolidated.\n\nNetSuite requires a partner for compliance controls (e.g. ISO, TS, and FDA), while Great Plains provides all those out-of-the-box. Also, naturally, NetSuite lags a little behind Great Plains when it comes to integration with Microsoft tools like MS SQL server, Power BI and Excel.\n\nFinal Thoughts: NetSuite vs Great Plains\n\nThe answer to the NetSuite vs Great Plains discussion is not just a matter of a what you need from an ERP system, it's also a conversation about what you can expect from your software vendor and your future IT investments.\n\nMicrosoft has been heavily marketing and positioning their Dynamics 365 Business Central cloud ERP product leaving many wondering what the Microsoft road map looks like in the coming years.\n\nNetSuite is 100% focused on investing in a single, leading, cloud-based ERP platform while Microsoft has acquired, maintained, and retooled multiple platforms (SL,GP, NAV, AX) over the years leaving many prospects scratching their head about what ERP product they should invest in.\n\nIf you desire:\n\na leading software vendor (Oracle)\n\na singular product focus (NetSuite invest 25% of all revenue back into R&D)\n\na proven & scalable platform (Gartner Magic Quadrant \"Leader\")\n\na robust partner ecosystem\n\n...then NetSuite should be your #1 choice.
