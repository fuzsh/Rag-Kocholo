        "text": "3. Aging ERP Is a Drag on Business Velocity\n\nThe web enables business to go global instantly—reaching many millions of customers in a year or two, whereas it used to take a decade or more to make that type of progress.\n\nSome of today’s fast growing publicly traded companies are growing because they are not shackled to their on-premise ERP systems. Had these companies relied on an upgrade to the installation of their on-premise ERP system to take advantage of innovation, who knows where they’d be today?\n\nYour ability to compete is diminished if you’re running an aging install of Microsoft Dynamics NAV or Epicor that was designed for when businesses grew incrementally—country by country, market by market, over years and decades. The old way of doing business meant deploying multiple ERP instances and databases for each market. It meant hiring IT in each location, setting up offices, procuring software and hardware, and enduring onerous setup processes. IT budget, resources and time were the constraining factors for business growth.\n\nCloud applications like NetSuite provide the engine to drive growth, enabling businesses to lay down an applications footprint for each country and subsidiary in weeks—not months or years. Cloud ERP spares businesses from having to worry about scaling up expensive IT resources and large capital expenditures on IT infrastructure. The result is velocity that creates true competitive advantage.\n\n4. Mobile Workforce Battles Immobile and Outdated ERP\n\nThe millennial generation entering the workforce demand easy-to-use systems that mirror social tools or online shopping and increasingly blur the lines between work and home life. At the end of the day, putting the right person in the right place with the right tools remains the best way for a company of any size to stay competitive. According to Gartner, worldwide devices (the combined shipments of PCs, tablets and mobile phones) are on pace to reaching more than 2.9 billion units in 2017. But your ERP system was designed for when work was done in the office cube, and consumer computing and business computing were clearly separated. Using outdated ERP means either completely giving up on accessing your information from anywhere outside of your office, struggling for access over sloth-like Citrix connections or enduring painfully slow client-server experiences over virtual private networks (VPNs)—not to mention the associated IT and maintenance costs. It also means having no visibility into business operations when on the road, or having to drive into the office to approve a sales order. The result is your employees are simply less productive than they could be and you make decisions more slowly based on outdated information.\n\nNetSuite requires as little as 10% of the implementation effort normally associated with an ERP deployment. – Nucleus Research\n\nOld ERP was never designed for the post-PC era of the anytime, anywhere workforce, but cloud applications are. In fact, no matter how much you upgrade your old PC-era ERP system, it will never be easy to access over mobile devices because it was not initially architected with the web in mind and, in some cases, was engineered before the Internet was invented. On the other hand, web-based cloud ERP applications are optimized for bringing the world of mobile computing together with ERP, enabling your employees to monitor and manage the business from anywhere on any device. For example, without any IT setup work, NetSuite cloud ERP can be accessed from anytime, anywhere via any web browser, whether IE, Chrome, Safari or Firefox, and any mobile device, whether iPads, iPhone, Androids or whichever device hits the market next.\n\n5. Centralized Old ERP Hampers the Increasingly Decentralized Business\n\nIt’s not just workers that are becoming mobile. Businesses as a whole are becoming more distributed.\n\nTo compete, businesses are looking to achieve agility and fluidity in their business structure. In a globalized world, businesses need to be able to choose where work takes place based on cost, timeliness and the ability to maintain and adapt an elastic workforce.\n\nToday’s businesses are running operations in multiple locations and maximizing efficiency with offshoring and remote workers. But last generation’s ERP was never designed with this in mind, requiring hefty Windows clients and heavyweight software in each location. Old ERP forces you into an expensive centralized structure, unless you can afford to dispatch IT teams to every corner of the globe. It means maintaining desktops at multiple locations, upgrading clients and dealing with information fragmentation across local desktops. Businesses want to decentralize while maintaining visibility and control, but old ERP holds them back from achieving those goals.\n\nA good example of how a business can compete in this newly globalized environment is Sundia Corporation, a multimillion-dollar fresh produce brand based in Oakland, California. With customer support in the Philippines, accounting in India and the executive team in California, Sundia needed to get operations up quickly while maintaining an efficient ongoing cost structure. Cloud ERP is the foundation for Sundia’s modern, global and decentralized operations, enabling its personnel across the globe to access, manage and even innovate the ERP system in real-time.\n\nIt’s an organizational structure that would have been untenable with old centralized ERP. Brad Oberwager, Founder, Chairman and CEO, observed that Sundia “simply wouldn’t be in business with the old way.” Sundia is able to leverage the power of cloud to drive innovation further, with remote application development and customization based in Asia taking place in real-time on the cloud platform.\n\nCloud computing enables the distributed “elastic” business—enabling the extended workforce to access applications from anywhere across the globe, offshore as it makes sense, and scale up and down easily whenever needed. They can easily operate on a true “follow-the-sun” model and not be limited by the constraints of centralized ERP or be dependent on local IT resources.\n\n6. Legacy ERP Fails to Satisfy the Appetite for Real-Time Information\n\nIf you’re running legacy ERP like Sage MAS or Microsoft Dynamics GP, you know the drill. Your business is running on spreadsheets, and management reporting is an onerous and error-prone exercise. You’ve got employees dedicated to the job of simply reporting, or reporting consumes the lion’s share of their day.\n\nMore often than not, it takes days to assemble bookings, billings and backlogs reports, or complete the periodic budgeting and forecasting process. You’re constantly struggling to unlock data that’s buried in the ERP (or other disconnected systems and spreadsheets). Amazingly, while businesses can today measure ad performance, marketing campaign responses, and the number of unique visitors to their website in real-time, core financial management reporting remains measured in weeks and business days.\n\nAccording to a survey by Forrester research titled Key Prevailing Trends in ERP, more companies are interested in adopting the following trends and Analytics is one of the top three priorities.\n\nSaaS: Deployments are complementary to on-premises apps.\n\nMobile: Running ERP apps on a variety of smart devices.\n\nAnalytics: Broadening their organization’s use of BI and reporting.\n\nCollaboration: Taking on technologies as part of a push for app usability.\n\nBusiness Processes: Embedding processes within ERP apps.\n\nAnd for good reason—there’s a gulf between what financial managers need and what their ERP is delivering. Custom ABAP reporting in an SAP ERP system, static Crystal Reports or out-of-date spreadsheets emailed among managers just aren’t enough. Your ERP is starving your business of information, forcing you to make strategic and tactical decisions based on out-of-date, incomplete or simply erroneous data.\n\nTo compete, businesses need modern ERP designed for today’s needs, not the needs of yesteryear. BI and analytics should be part and parcel of the ERP experience. BI has to empower every employee with personalized key performance indicators (KPIs) in real-time, enable them to get down to the invoice behind that days sales outstanding (DSO) threshold metric, gain visibility across the complete business and create and share their own reports with self- service tools.\n\nCombining the mobility and distributed access enabled by the cloud with real-time analytics puts your company firmly on the path to true competitive advantage—enabling workers across the extended business to collaborate and achieve alignment, no matter where their location and without days of delay. Modern cloud ERP like NetSuite eliminates the gap between the demand for analytics, your business processes and the decisions you need to make based on both of those items.\n\n7. Stone Age ERP Walls Your Business Off from Suppliers, Channels and Customers\n\nEverything has become connected through the cloud. Your customers are no longer content to wait on the phone to check an order; they want to browse your website to get their order status right now. Your suppliers stand ready to drop-ship your orders in real-time rather than forcing you to tie up capital in inventory.\n\nChannels like Amazon are ripe to drive additional sales. Your website is increasingly your principal storefront, and customers judge your business by the level of service it provides. Your operations have to be interconnected with customers, suppliers and partners, enabling real-time information exchange on demand.\n\nBut your out-of-date SAP R/3 or Microsoft Dynamics AX deployment was never designed for such an interconnected world—forcing you to deploy expensive adapters, third-party applications and CSV exports. In short, Stone Age ERP was never designed to be connected across so many touchpoints and with so many external stakeholders—they’re simply not service-oriented systems.\n\nAs the Web increasingly becomes the medium for information exchange, your on-premise ERP is increasingly an anathema, a silo—disconnected and out of sync. The impact is multi-faceted. Your customers are frustrated if they can’t easily view pricing and inventory information on your website, or check the status of orders or returns. You’re frustrated if you can’t switch suppliers on demand, because the effort requires yet more expensive integrations.\n\nIn contrast, cloud ERP applications were designed to connect with other platforms and web applications within your enterprise and beyond. Designed from the ground up to be service-oriented and always-on, cloud ERP makes it easy to synchronize your back- and front-office with your website in real-time and connect to the extended enterprise. Your customers see their orders and returns in real-time. Your suppliers are able to fulfill your customers’ orders as they process in your ERP. Your stock levels are always up to date, providing visibility for your sales and service reps as well as customers browsing through channels like eBay and Amazon.\n\nOld ERP is a Barrier Between Your Employees and Self- Service\n\nAre you part of a self-service business? Can your employees enter time and expenses themselves into the ERP, or does someone need to rekey it for them? Can an accounting manager quickly implement a new purchase order process, or do you need to wait weeks for IT to do it? Can your finance team easily change the invoice template, or add another field to a customer record themselves? If none of this rings true, don’t blame your co-workers—blame your ERP.\n\nStone Age ERP was designed when businesses were top- heavy in general administration—when it was standard practice to have someone assigned to rekeying purchase orders or time and expense entries. Back then, a manager could offload his reporting to the finance staff, and you could hire another IT guy to make an ERP process change.\n\nCloud ERP is designed for lean businesses and uses the power of the web to drive employee self-service, just as the Web has securely transformed online banking and customer self-service systems. As banks have known for years, empowering customers with self-service through the Web increases profitability and reduces waste that goes straight to the bottom line. Employees who use the cloud gain self- service efficiencies that aren’t possible to achieve with old ERP. They can submit time and expense reports or purchase orders, even enter receipts directly into the ERP anywhere from a web page or mobile device. Once these transactions are submitted, it’s just a matter of online approval. Managing change is also self-service, with graphical workflows, forms and schema changes that require no delay or IT involvement. Even reporting—a function long offloaded to “reporting analysts”—can be performed by managers themselves.\n\nFrom “Version-Locked” Outdated ERP to “Version-Less” Cloud ERP\n\nCloud ERP frees businesses from the brittle, inflexible and change resistant ERP of the past. With the cloud, businesses can run on ERP that is “version-less.” It means that businesses get the latest innovations automatically, from new features to support for the latest regulations. No more waiting, no more costly upgrades, no more upgrade risk. No more outdated ERP.\n\n“Version-less” cloud ERP enables enterprises to experience ERP innovation as fast as consumers experience innovation in the enhanced web applications they use every day. It continuously aligns your ERP with your business operating environment.\n\nBetter still, enterprises no longer have to live in fear of customizations acting like “silicon concrete,” hardening their ERP to change and slowing their business to a crawl. They can finally customize their ERP with confidence, because with cloud ERP, customizations migrate automatically with every new release. Customization no longer becomes a barrier to innovation.\n\nThe Competitive Advantage of Cloud ERP\n\nA recent Forrester Research Forrsights survey found that the top four reasons that businesses move to the cloud are improved business agility, speed of implementation and deployment, faster delivery of new features and functions and to support business innovation with new capabilities. At NetSuite, we couldn’t agree more—we’ve seen the 30,000+ companies and subsidiaries that run on the NetSuite cloud, experience the same benefits.\n\nWhy make the move now? Consider the alternative. Remaining on Stone Age “version-locked” systems means high ongoingcost, distraction from focusing on what matters and a continuing drag on business agility. And ultimately that means falling behind your competition.\n\nNetSuite is the most successful ERP suite SaaS provider operating in terms of active customers, international presence and functionality offered across the product. – Gartner"
