Discover how NetSuite streamlines operations, provides critical insights, and can be tailored to suit your unique needs.\n\nWhat Exactly is NetSuite?\n\nNetSuite stands at the forefront of cloud-based business management platforms, helping organizations function more effectively. With a clientele spanning over 36,000 entities worldwide, it offers applications that seamlessly unify your operations. Core functions like finance, accounting, and inventory management are just the beginning. With options to integrate CRM, HR, and professional services automation, NetSuite presents a holistic view of your operations. Thanks to its shared database across all modules, real-time insights are always a click away. Plus, the cloud-based nature ensures reduced overheads for infrastructure and upgrades, enabling you to channel your resources towards business growth.\n\nHow Does It Work\n\nNetSuite's prowess lies in its ability to unify various applications with a centralized database. This ensures real-time information flow and robust management of business processes—from finance and accounting to orders and procurement. To cater to diverse business requirements, modules like CRM, HR, professional services automation, and omnichannel commerce can be incorporated. The shared database concept guarantees that real-time data remains at your fingertips. As a cloud-based solution, NetSuite ensures secure, remote access from any internet-connected device. With tailored dashboards and role-defined access, it paves the way for efficient workflows and data-driven decisions.\n\nHistory of NetSuite\n\nNetSuite, which began its journey as NetLedger, has an illustrious history, charting its path from a startup idea to becoming one of the world's leading cloud-based business management platforms. Founded in 1998 by Evan Goldberg with the backing of tech titan Larry Ellison, the initial vision was to provide web-hosted accounting software, revolutionizing the way businesses approached finance.\n\nWith a substantial investment of $125 million from Ellison's Tako Ventures, the company set its sails into the vast sea of the software industry. By 2002, recognizing the need to offer more comprehensive business solutions, NetLedger transformed into NetSuite. This rebranding was more than just a name change; it introduced pivotal applications in inventory management and CRM, setting the stage for its forthcoming achievements.\n\nZach Nelson's appointment as CEO in 2002 was a defining moment for the company. Under his leadership, NetSuite witnessed exponential growth, carving its niche in the software market. The world took note in 2007 when NetSuite made its stock market debut with a noteworthy IPO, raising over $160 million, marking its arrival on the global stage.\n\nHowever, NetSuite wasn't just resting on its laurels. It undertook strategic acquisitions to strengthen its platform:\n\n2013: The acquisition of LightCMS bolstered its SuiteCommerce platform.\n\n2014: Buying Venda, a London-based e-commerce solutions provider, extended NetSuite's e-commerce reach.\n\n2015: NetSuite made headlines with its purchase of Bronto Software for around $200 million, enhancing its CRM and e-commerce prowess.\n\n2016: The acquisition of IQity's cloud business equipped NetSuite to cater to both discrete and batch process manufacturers, diversifying its offering.\n\nPerhaps the most pivotal moment in NetSuite's journey was in 2016 when global tech giant Oracle announced its intention to acquire NetSuite for a whopping $9.3 billion. This acquisition by Oracle, one of the leading companies in enterprise software, was a testament to NetSuite's success and the value it brought to the table. Under Oracle's umbrella, NetSuite has further expanded its global footprint, enhancing its capabilities and serving an even broader range of customers.\n\nFrom its modest beginnings to its esteemed stature today, NetSuite's journey underscores the power of vision, innovation, and strategic growth.\n\nUnpacking the 5 Core Features of NetSuite\n\nLet’s talk about the core features of NetSuite.

NetSuite Licensing Cost:\n\nNetSuite offers different editions for their packages, most NetSuite packages start around $1,200 per month.\n\nModular Pricing: NetSuite operates on a modular setup, allowing businesses to choose specific modules that are tailored to their needs. Whether you require tools for finance, operations, customer relations, employee management, or business intelligence, you will be billed based on your module selections. This modular pricing ensures that you only pay for the functionalities that are relevant to your business, avoiding unnecessary costs.\n\nAnnual License Fee: NetSuite follows an annual subscription-based pricing model. The fee grants you access to the NetSuite platform and its wide range of features. The cost of the annual license fee is influenced by factors such as the number of users and the modules you have chosen. This pricing structure provides flexibility for businesses of all sizes and allows for scalability as your business grows.\n\nFor a precise estimate that matches your organization's needs, it is highly recommended to collaborate with a NetSuite consulting firm such as Kimberlite partners.

Most NetSuite implementations will cost between $25,000 up to $150,000.\n\nModule Selection: Similar to licensing, the choice of modules plays a significant role in the implementation cost. Configuring multiple modules or specific industry-centric solutions may increase the overall price. However, it's important to note that these additional modules can provide substantial value and enhance the efficiency of your business processes.\n\nConsultation and Services: Implementation goes beyond software deployment.
