        "text": "There are two questions eCommerce firms operating in a digital economy must be able to answer: What is an ERP solution and what are the best ERP solutions for eCommerce? The first question is easy, but the second one is more subjective.\n\nLet’s start with what an ERP solution is…\n\nSimply put, a cloud-based ERP solution is an application that acts as a centralized storehouse of data that flows in from integrated applications. The solution allows businesses to access the synchronized information via the Internet, automate their processes, and become a fully connected business.\n\nHow ERP Fits Into Your eCommerce Business\n\nStatista notes that in 2020, eCommerce revenues exceeded $431 billion and estimates that by 2023, eCommerce sales will rise above $740 billion. Consumer expectations are rising with them. To meet these growing expectations, your eCommerce firm must provide a comprehensive eCommerce website (what they interact with) that seamlessly integrates with a cloud ERP solution (what you use to manage omni-channel orders, inventory, picking-packing-shipping, returns, customer support, accounting, and more).\n\nAccording to BigCommerce’s Leigh-Anne Truitt, ERP solutions for eCommerce, such as Acumatica Cloud ERP, can help you future-proof your eCommerce business by supporting complex pricing, minimizing human error in processing, helping you react quickly to change, simplifying your system, and keeping your store secure. All of which are clearly business-building benefits, but there are also things to watch out for, which means you need to make sure you choose the best ERP for your business.\n\nThe Best ERP Solutions for eCommerce\n\nBecause there is no shortage of ERP solutions for eCommerce businesses to choose from, it’s a good idea to compare and contrast your ERP options before making a choice. Here’s a look at four competitors in the ERP space.\n\nRead the current report from G2 on ERP User Satisfaction Ratings…\n\nOracle NetSuite\n\nNetSuite was established in 1998, went public in 2007, and was acquired by Oracle in 2016. Oracle NetSuite has been the ERP choice for thousands of businesses in almost every industry across the globe, from marketing and advertising, agriculture, and government to construction, engineering, and eCommerce. The cloud-based ERP solution is available through subscription licensing. It supports remote access with a mobile application and can customize its software to your business’ needs. Built-in BI provides access to analytics you need to make valuable business decisions. The company has a SuiteCommerce family of cloud-based eCommerce solutions for B2C and B2B customers. According to Oracle NetSuite, they give companies “clear visibility and control of their business.”\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365\n\nThough used by large companies (e.g., HP, Coca Cola, and Lowe’s), Microsoft Dynamics 365 works for small companies, too. Product suites can be “bundled” together based on what a business requires. Its cloud-based architecture means its scalable and flexible. It can be remotely accessed and customized to fit your business needs. The software applications are designed to work with each other as well as with third-party applications. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce helps online retailers unify back-office, in-store, eCommerce, and call center departments. According to Microsoft Dynamics 365, “Adapt and innovate with the only portfolio of business applications that empowers your organization to deliver operational excellence and delight every customer.”\n\nSage\n\nFounded in 1981, Sage offers multiple ERP software solutions, such as Sage 300, to small-to-medium-sized businesses. Sage 300 (along with Sage 50, Sage 100, and Sage 500) was designed for on-premises deployment but has been reimagined for the cloud. This allows users to access the solution via the Internet on multiple web-enabled devices. Businesses pay for licensing based on user count. Upgrades are able to happen on users’ schedule and offers a full relational database export. Sage offers Sage eCommerce, which is seamlessly integrated with Sage Enterprise Management. According to Sage, it is an “all-in-one business management software” for a variety of industries to “manage their finances, operations and inventory.”\n\nAcumatica Cloud ERP\n\nAcumatica Cloud ERP began in 2008 and is an ERP solution that was purpose-built for the cloud. All users can remotely access their centralized data for a single source of truth via a mobile application (available on any web-enabled device; data automatically resizes to fit each screen). The product is highly configurable and provides multiple deployment options (e.g., cloud, private cloud, and hybrid). Users can update and upgrade at any time they choose. As a full-function ERP, Acumatica supports a variety of vertical industries, including distribution, manufacturing, construction, and more. The retail-commerce edition delivers a consistent customer experience across all sales channels and integrates with your back-office system and includes a native Acumatica for BigCommerce Connector. According to Acumatica Cloud ERP, “Built on a future-proof platform with open architecture for rapid integrations, scalability, and ease of use, Acumatica delivers unparalleled value to small and midmarket organizations.”\n\nHow Crestwood & Acumatica Can Help\n\nDeciding which of the best ERP solutions for eCommerce is the right one for your business is vital to your success. Though all four competitors have their strengths and weaknesses, Acumatica Cloud ERP is an award-winning solution that will scale with you as you grow (charging for the resources you use, not the number of users) while offering a seamless integration between your eCommerce storefront, such as BigCommerce, and Acumatica’s financial, inventory, and fulfillment capabilities."
