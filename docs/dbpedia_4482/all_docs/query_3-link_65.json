Almost immediately, management and select staff, encouraged by the Board, set about crafting a new strategy and way forward for the organization. IFDC’s new streamlined strategy, completed early in 2020, focuses on developing better technologies, increasing on-farm productivity, strengthening market systems, and facilitating an enabling environment for smart agricultural policy and knowledge sharing. The strategy is discussed in our feature.\n\nOur staff continued their excellent work and, by the end of last year, converted more than 100,000 hectares of smallholder farmland to improved agricultural technologies. More than 200,000 farmers utilized these technologies on their land, and more than 250,000 farmers participated in training and capacity building, with women representing 31%. In addition, we established more than 13,000 demonstration plots, formed and facilitated an astounding 523 public-private partnerships, and led over 4,000 outreach activities.\n\nWe were also able to sign a new Master Agreement with the OCP Group in Morocco. As part of this public-private partnership, IFDC and OCP will work together with the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) on various research, implementation, and education projects with the ultimate goal of developing and increasing farmer access to new fertilizer products and boosting their incomes.\n\nThanks to the combined efforts of the IFDC team, we were able to finalize the process with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs that led to the signing of a Coordinated Relationship Management agreement facilitating partnership with IFDC and providing for simplified review and reporting processes. This agreement will continue to strengthen our relationship as we work with the Dutch Government and in-country embassies throughout Africa.\n\nOur great work in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia is built upon a strong foundation within the organization. In 2019, we strengthened internal processes by transitioning to an accounting software powered by NetSuite, which allows for an improved procurement process and faster delivery of financial results. In addition, we fully implemented the EthicsPoint platform, which provides employees a safe whistleblower mechanism to anonymously report misconduct if that should occur.\n\nUnfortunately, we mourned the passing of Dr. David Glenn. David was the Chief of Party of our Dry Zone and Uplands Agro-Input and Farm Services project, funded by the Livelihoods and Food Security Fund (LIFT) in Myanmar. His passing was truly a tragedy and a great loss for our team.\n\nWe express our sincere gratitude to all donors and partners that have supported IFDC during the past year. 2019 was a successful year for IFDC, from both a project implementation and a financial perspective. However, we face many new challenges in 2020. It will take the best effort and ingenuity of the IFDC Board, management, and staff to negotiate this unprecedented time and to ensure that food security of the most vulnerable of our society is not compromised any further. We are optimistic that we will successfully meet these challenges with our passion, creativity, and determination.\n\nOUR REACH 2019\n\nBANGLADESH | BENIN | BURKINA FASO | BURUNDI | CÔTE D’IVOIRE | ETHIOPIA | GHANA | INDIA | KENYA | MALI | MOZAMBIQUE | MYANMAR | NEPAL | NIGER | NIGERIA | SENEGAL | TOGO | UGANDA\n\nIFDC believes fundamental improvements in soil and plant nutrition are required to meet the challenge of sustainably feeding 10 billion people by 2050. Global population growth will drive a substantial increase in food demand, while climate change is already accelerating risks to food production, especially in poorer regions. Major changes in agricultural systems – especially nutrient use efficiency – will be needed to ensure food security and environmental sustainability.\n\nOver the past 70 years, NPK adoption fueled spectacular increases in agricultural productivity in much of the world, but the ecological costs of inefficient fertilizer use have been high. Over half of the estimated 120 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers used each year ends up in waterways. Agriculture, forestry, and land-use change were responsible for a quarter of global annual greenhouse gas emissions during 2007-2016.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, deficiencies of zinc, boron, and sulfur have contributed to poor fertilizer profitability, low adoption rates, and a vicious cycle of soil degradation. Soil and environmental degradation results as nutrients are continually extracted through cropping and as agricultural production expands onto new, often marginal, lands. Declining soil fertility limits biomass production and surface cover, leading to poor soil structure and increased runoff and erosion.\n\nTo meet these challenges, IFDC has revamped its strategic approach. For more than 40 years, IFDC has led the research and implementation of many novel technologies. As our shared challenges become more complex, we must find innovative ways to look ahead and solve them. Our strategy outlines four strategic objectives that guide us as we strive for a food-secure, environmentally sustainable world.\n\nOUR STRATEGIC SOLUTIONS\n\nAchieving impact at scale requires adapting research and technology to smallholder needs, but it must go further. IFDC experts and their partners work across the discovery-to-consumer continuum to bridge the traditional gaps between research, technology dissemination, and market systems that often undermine efforts to realize and sustain impact at scale. With an emphasis on working with partners and strengthening local capacity, IFDC focuses on integrating project-level research and development efforts across four priority areas.\n\nDEVELOP BETTER TECHNOLOGIES\n\nCATALYZE FARM PRODUCTIVITY\n\nConduct on-farm research and demonstrations.\n\nIFDC works with smallholders and other partners to test the impact of key practices, including soil and water conservation techniques, no-till farming, relay cropping, cover crops and organic matter recycling methods, on climate resilience and the environment.\n\nExpand engagement of women and youth.\n\nIFDC is expanding training for these groups and working to improve their access to productive resources and services. Increasing the successful participation of women and youth in new agribusiness partnerships on and off the farm is a key objective.\n\nUse ICT to scale adoption of improved technologies.\n\nWorking closely with youth as early adopters and trainers, IFDC is harnessing mobile phones and apps to change how farmers access and use information about markets, weather and pest forecasts, and crop management and business management advice.\n\nSTRENGTHEN MARKETS\n\nENABLE IMPACT\n\nIFDC Research plays a unique intermediary role by transforming innovative fertilizer products and soil fertility management technologies into adaptable and scalable production technologies. We undertake applied research and implementation, involving scientiﬁc discovery, development, and testing of advanced fertilizers and related soil fertility management technologies; design of fertilizer manufacturing and quality control processes; market system development; and applied policy and regulatory analysis. The overall goal of IFDC research is to signiﬁcantly boost the production of higher quality food, using less land and water; improve the climate resilience of farming systems; and reduce adverse environmental impacts associated with agriculture. Our research was made possible by the Feed the Future Soil Fertility Technology (SFT) Adoption, Policy Reform, and Knowledge Management project, as well as partnerships with the private sector.\n\nINNOVATIVE RESEARCH SOLUTIONS THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS\n\nPartnerships are crucial to our applied research. In 2019, our team worked with private sector and university partners on maximizing nutrient use efficiency of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and sulfur (S) fertilizer products; improving soil and plant health through balanced nutrition; and promoting sustainable soil intensification practices, such as conservation agriculture and integrated soil fertility management. Laboratory, greenhouse, and field trials were conducted to quantify the effect of various coating materials (polymer, lignin, peanut shell, corn starch, S, micronutrients, polyhalites, nanomaterials, etc.) and inhibitors (urease and nitrification) on ammonia volatilization loss, N leaching loss, nitrous oxide emissions, yield, crop N uptake, and protein content.\n\nECONOMICS AND POLICIES FOR CHANGE\n\nDuring 2019, IFDC’s economics and policy work focused primarily on research and advocacy efforts through focused surveys and consultations among stakeholders. The Kenya Fertilizer Platform (KeFERT) initiated in 2018 was formally launched in July 2019. KeFERT facilitated meetings with fertilizer sector stakeholders in partnership with the Kenya Bureau of Standards and the Ministry of Agriculture to set fertilizer standards and streamline fertilizer subsidies in Kenya. At the request of the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, IFDC conducted a detailed technical assessment of the subsidy program and submitted a modified design using electronic vouchers, known as the Kenya National E-Incentive Inputs Program. Since then, the Ministry has held several consultations to generate consensus on shifting to a countrywide e-voucher system during the 2020 cropping season.\n\nIn 2019, an empirical estimation of the economic and environmental benefits of using urea deep placement (UDP) technology was conducted in Bangladesh using the life cycle analysis (LCA) approach. Results indicated UDP reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 50% while minimizing N in runoff compared to broadcast urea application. Economic benefits associated with UDP include a 33% savings in the amount of N fertilizer applied, reduced weeding cost, and increased paddy yield by about 500 kg/ha compared to broadcast application. The analysis further indicated that Bangladeshi farmers using UDP technology may have opportunities to gain carbon credits\n\nSOILS CONSORTIUM LAUNCHES\n\nIFDC, in partnership with the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Sustainable Intensification (SIIL) at Kansas State University that is financed by USAID, initiated a collaborative research consortium focusing on Sustainable Opportunities for Improving Livelihoods with Soils (SOILS). The SOILS Consortium brings together national and international partners to develop and implement soil health and fertility-enhancing innovations. Academic and research partners include Michigan State University, University of Colorado, Auburn University, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service. The primary goal of the SOILS Consortium is to improve soil fertility in the most vulnerable regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Through innovative research, coordination, capacity building, networking, data sharing, and communication approaches, the SOILS Consortium will provide sustainable solutions to build resilient households with access to nutritious food.\n\nFollowing a soft launch during the Soil Science Society of America meeting in San Diego in January 2019, the formal launch of the SOILS Consortium was held in Washington, D.C., in March 2019 to showcase USAID and IFDC’s leadership and solidify activities for the first year. The consortium further invited detailed concepts to enhancing soil fertility research, leveraging ongoing work by partners in Niger and Ethiopia.\n\nThe SOILS Consortium conducted a series of summits in Niger and Ethiopia during May and November 2019, bringing together research stakeholders leading soil health activities across major production zones in each country, and co-developed unified regional strategies to improve soil health and soil fertility recommendation in alignment with national and regional priorities. A Common SOILS Agenda was drafted, outlining ongoing activities that meet the recommendations of the summits and proposing a new set of activities to address gaps in soil fertility research.\n\nFERTILIZER ENGINEERING, PRODUCTION, AND RESEARCH\n\nIFDC’s fertilizer engineering and pilot plant services help fertilizer producers solve production problems.\n\nIn 2019, we:\n\nConducted research on various binders for use in granulation to produce products for the fertilizer industry.\n\nWorked on incorporation of new raw materials into existing fertilizer processes.\n\nConducted physical properties testing on new fertilizer products introduced into the market.\n\nResearch on fertilizer formulations, properties, technical feasibility, and overall market feasibility of products is made possible through an interdisciplinary team of engineers, technicians, scientists, and economists.\n\nProject Highlights\n\nIFDC projects in East and Southern Africa bolster local agribusinesses. We work to transform livelihoods for smallholder farmers and their communities by utilizing improved agricultural technologies, creating inclusive income opportunities, and facilitating market access. On the input side, we link farmers with small and medium enterprises that that supply quality fertilizers and seeds. On the output side, we connect them with companies that buy their crops. Farmers involved in these agribusiness partnerships collectively sell millions of dollars of crops to buyers. IFDC also works with these agribusinesses and related service providers to increase their capacity to source from smallholder farmers and supply products to domestic and international buyers, including low-income consumers.\n\nAll projects include training and mentoring components. We strengthen farmers’ knowledge of good agricultural practices, integrated soil fertility management technologies, and other crop management practices that help farmers build resilience to climate shocks. IFDC emphasizes balanced fertilization and crop nutrition, particularly the use of secondary and micronutrients. To ensure farmers in the region have access to fertilizers that meet specific soil and crop needs, IFDC employs its SMaRT framework (Soil testing, Mapping, Recommendations development, and Technology transfer). Regional activities also focus on association building, policy analysis and reform, and market information access.\n\nBy collaborating with agribusinesses, service providers, national and regional partner organizations, research institutions, governments, and donors, we support the development of competitive and sustainable agricultural value chains and create an enabling environment for agricultural intensification and private sector development.\n\nProject Highlights\n\nIFDC in Asia serves one of the most diverse areas of the world. Our work seeks innovative ways to develop sustainable agricultural production systems by adopting a holistic approach throughout the entire value chain involving firms, traders, and farmers. This includes developing and testing efficient nutrient technologies and agronomic practices at the farm level, strengthening agri-entrepreneurship, and influencing policy reforms through evidence-based economic analysis. Improving fertilizer efficiency is a major focus of IFDC research in Asia. Climate-smart agricultural technologies, like fertilizer deep placement (FDP), are helping farmers earn more income and mitigate agriculture’s impact on the environment. We are also building the capacity of national scientists in measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from improved technologies compared with traditional practices.\n\nIn addition, IFDC’s work in the region promotes agribusiness models that engage women and youth. In 2019, we completed a project in Bangladesh that empowered women farmers in Bangladesh to improve horticulture production; as a result, over 35,000 female farmers are using improved technologies and management practices.\n\nIn 2020, IFDC plans to expand this work into India to diffuse improved agricultural technologies to peri-urban farmers through good agricultural practices (GAPs), capacity building, micro-enterprise development, and linking farmers to markets.\n\nAccording to one attendee at the workshop in Germany, the biggest benefit was the “excellent networking between experts in the industry… [this workshop was] a great event to increase knowledge of [fertilizers].”\n\nAs of publication, precautions taken against the COVID-19 pandemic have put IFDC’s international workshop activities on hold.

Undeterred by poor fortune, she and 65 other women in Kadiolo, Mali, established a rice producers association, Dabakala. These courageous women, once caught in a cycle of poverty and food insecurity, have doubled their rice production with improved fertilizer technology. “We never thought we could grow enough rice to sell, but now we are selling so much we have our own cash. Many of our women are independent. They no longer depend entirely on their husbands,” said Ouattara, humbly beaming."
