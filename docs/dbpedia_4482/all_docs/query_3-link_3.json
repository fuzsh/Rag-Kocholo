        "text": "Many people close to me have heard me talk (maybe to much) about the future in software for several years. In the past, there were completely standalone software. Software was created according to a special need. If there was information in one software that was useful in another, the information had to be copied between the systems. After the turn of the millennium, we began to carefully connect different software and today it is a matter of course. However, it is not wholly positive. It is very easy to create a very complex network of software. Especially when updating different softwares and APIs is not synchronized. Today, companies buy software that is far too large for their needs. the software manufacturers need a lot of functionality to create a larger target group. This leads to you getting a lot of functions you don't need at the same time as it is very difficult to get unique adaptations according to your own needs. Usually it ends up with multiple softwares and connections between them. I don't think we will be buying big complex software and paying expensive licensing costs per user in the future. I think that we will quite quickly switch over to customized software as the basis of most companies. A software that you can shape according to your own unique needs. In today's society with all the demands that exist, companies are becoming more and more unique. The software needs to keep up. For several years I have been completely taken aback by how good the software Oracle APEX is and have seen the potential in it. In 2019, I was in San Fransisco and listened as Oracle properly highlighted APEX for the first time. I remembered how excited people from the internal group responsible for APEX within Oracle were about this. Now the next step is taken. Larry Ellison (https://lnkd.in/dVphqCmn) said yesterday that all software that is developed from now on must be based on Oracle APEX. Many people have looked a little askance at Low-code and No-code solutions. APEX has been low-code, but now in combination with the AI revolution, you can go one step further and reduce the need for code for those who don't want to program themselves. It will be even easier to develop software and functionality will increase rapidly. My suggestion to business owners, start asking yourself how you would like your software to work and plan for it? There is incredible potential already today and my firm belief is that the best foundation is an Oracle Database with APEX as RAD tool, especially if you manage important data. Own your data, own your software! #OraclAPEX #Oracle #CloudWorld\n\nThere are several reasons why some individuals or organizations may choose not to use Oracle products or services: 1. Cost: Oracle products can be expensive, especially for small businesses or startups, due to licensing fees and ongoing support costs. 2. Complexity: Oracle software often comes with a steep learning curve and complex setup requirements, which can be challenging for organizations with limited IT resources or expertise. 3. Vendor Lock-in: Once a company heavily invests in Oracle products, migrating away can be difficult and costly due to dependencies on Oracle's proprietary technologies and formats. 4. Performance Issues: Some users have reported performance issues with certain Oracle products, particularly in high-demand or resource-intensive environments. 5. Licensing Agreements: Oracle's licensing agreements can be complex and restrictive, leading to confusion and potential compliance issues for organizations. 6. Limited Support: Some users have expressed dissatisfaction with Oracle's customer support, citing long response times and difficulties in resolving issues effectively. 7. Alternatives: There are many alternative database management systems and enterprise software solutions available, offering similar or better performance at a lower cost. Ultimately, the decision to use Oracle products or services depends on the specific needs, budget, and preferences of each organization. It's essential to carefully evaluate the pros and cons before making a commitment."
