        "text": "EHS SaaS Multitenancy explained and why it matters.\n\nThere is a considerable degree of (intended) confusion in the EHS software space when it comes to cloud computing and multitenancy. If your software vendor cannot share statistics in real time like shown in the figure nearby, most likely they do not run on a multitenant SaaS platform.\n\nThe real-time information on system performance and security of SaaS cloud platform is the most important element that frequently gets overlooked during EHS software selection process. Success in the cloud is built on trust. Trust starts with transparency.\n\nOur real time status monitoring (ran by an independent provider of web monitoring services) provide transparency around service availability and performance for Locus’ EHS SaaS products.\n\nJust as with airlines that fly through clouds, our entire business is built on trust and security of our cloud offerings. Over 700,000 locations around the globe trust Locus to safeguard their data in the cloud.\n\nCloud Computing\n\nSince the turn of the millennium, cloud computing has revolutionized the landscape of the computing world because it provides enterprise-grade computing resources that are affordable and instantly available. Clouds provide straightforward access to IT resources—you just access as many resources as you need when you need them, and never have to deal with the complexities of managing all of the underlying infrastructures that provide those resources. EHS manager job is suddenly a lot simpler and easier with cloud computing. You don’t even need help from IT department (if you don’t want it).\n\nMultitenancy\n\nMultitenancy is the fundamental technology that clouds use to share computing resources cost-efficiently and securely. Just like a bank—in which many tenants cost-efficiently share a hidden, common infrastructure, yet utilize a defined set of highly secure services, with complete privacy from other tenants—a cloud uses multitenancy technology to share IT resources securely among multiple applications and tenants (businesses, organizations, etc.) that use the cloud. Some clouds use virtualization-based architectures to isolate tenants; others use custom software architectures to get the job done. The multitenant design of a cloud service can have a dramatic impact on the application delivery and productivity of an IT organization, yet most CIOs, CTOs, system architects, and developers who use clouds don’t give it a second thought because it’s all magic that transparently happens behind the scenes.\n\nLocus Platform is the proven cloud application development platform that powers popular Locus cloud EHS and Sustainability applications as well as custom applications that customers build to satisfy their specific EHS+S requirements.\n\nSilicon Valley’s oldest EHS cloud software company reaches a major milestone\n\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., 11 April 2017 — Locus Technologies (Locus), the multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS) environmental compliance and sustainability management company, today celebrates the 20-year anniversary of its founding and, with it, 20 years of customer success. Two decades ago, Locus was founded with a bold vision to lead the EHS software space. Today, the company’s cloud computing model has enabled new levels of success. Locus has more net paying subscribers in its single instance multi-tenant SaaS platform than any competitor and has over 600,000 locations around the world.\n\nLocus was founded in 1997 with a vision for three new revolutionary models: a new technology model where customers access EHS services via the cloud rather than buying and installing software; a new subscription-based business model where customers pay as they go; and integrating mobile technology in its cloud offering from the get-go.\n\nAs a result, Locus is largely responsible for the creation of the emerging technical sector of EHS&S management software at the intersection of two major trends at the time of the company’s creation: the rise of the Internet and corporate attention to environmental compliance management. Locus not only defined and pioneered the new space of environmental information management in the cloud, but it also became a leader, leaving many well-funded startups with borrowed ideas and established ERP software companies behind. The company introduced many industry firsts, including: first cloud-based EHS system in 1999; first EHS mobile application in 2000; first integrated EHS portal in 2001; first web-based GIS in 2003; first user-configurable, drag-and-drop platform (Locus Platform) in 2013, and first IoT (Internet of Things) integration in 1999, before it was called “IoT”.\n\nLocus’ distinction comes both from harnessing the cloud and from a unique perspective on how to address the complex issues of environmental compliance and information management. Multi-tenant SaaS technology offers Locus’ customers numerous advantages such as improved data collection, aggregation, visualization, business analytics, advanced analysis, and the cost reduction inherent in multi-tenant web-based software. These features translate into a competitive advantage and increased profitability for customers.\n\nAs the industry continues to evolve, competitors merge or disappear, and new markets emerge and grow, Locus continues to stay independent and lead innovation in a space littered with failures.\n\n“Twenty years is a major milestone for Locus,” said Wes Hawthorne, President of Locus Technologies. “I have watched our software evolve and expand to cover all aspects of environmental information management— from our latest configurable platform where customers can design any application, to integrated mobile apps that truly streamline field data collection. I can’t predict the next 20 years of technological innovation, but I am sure Locus will continue to innovate and push the envelope to serve a market we understand so well.”\n\n“I’d like to thank our customers, who have created an unprecedented record of success and inspired our best innovations, and our employees to making it all possible,” said Neno Duplan, founder and CEO at Locus. “As we look forward to the next decade, we see not only applications, but integrated platforms, powered by AI and running in the cloud. The age of enterprise multi-tenant cloud EHS computing is here.”\n\nThere is a considerable degree of (intended) confusion in the EHS software space when it comes to multi-tenancy. Companies that are considering Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) hear all sorts of things from EHS software vendors hoping to tap into the momentum of cloud computing. Among the most common is that multi-tenancy is a “techie” thing that doesn’t need to be part of the conversation. Many go as far as saying “sure, we can do multi-tenant, single-tenant, whatever you need!”— anything to win the job.\n\nUnfortunately, those vendors simply do not understand what they are talking about. Multi-tenancy is a major shift in computing and requires all new approach to software architecture and delivery model. It is transformational, and customers who intend to buy the next generation of EHS software should spend the time to understand differences.\n\nMulti-tenancy is the core foundation of modern SaaS and shouldn’t be taken lightly, generalized, or massaged into something that suits a vendor’s self-serving interpretation of SaaS. Having experienced first-hand the true benefits of multi-tenant SaaS, I can’t conceptualize how SaaS would have delivered those benefits if it wasn’t multi-tenant. Can anyone imagine companies like Salesforce, NetSuite, Google, or Amazon offering a “single-tenant” solution side by side to their multi-tenant clouds? I will go as far as say that any company offering a single-tenant solution cannot be a serious contender in offering multi-tenant SaaS.\n\nI would also add that single-tenant (hybrid) cloud applications are worse than on-premise installment. Why? Because they are fake clouds. In these instances, a customer is, in fact, outsourcing maintenance of their application to a vendor that is not equipped for that maintenance. No single vendor in the EHS software industry is large enough to undertake maintenance of the single-tenant infrastructure on behalf of their customers, regardless how inexpensive hardware may be.\n\nThere are many ways to take the functions of on-premise installed software model of the 1980s and package them as services. Some of these service delivery modes– such as ASP, single-tenant hosting, and hybrid clouds– merely relocate and reassign long-standing problems and potentially make them worse. In a single-tenant model, user customizations may infiltrate throughout the stack, in a way that makes it difficult to upgrade the performance of the stack. The true SaaS models confront and mitigate– or even eliminate– some of the most vexing elements of software installation and maintenance: configurability on the fly, software maintenance, and upgrades. It is “a tyranny of software upgrades” that kills the single-tenant model.\n\nLet me offer a simple analogy to drive home the point as to why multi-tenancy matters: Tesla vs. Edison– War of Currents.\n\nThe War of Currents was a series of events surrounding the introduction of competing electric power transmission systems in the late 1880s and early 1890s that pitted companies against one another and involved a debate over cost and convenience of electricity generation and distribution systems, electrical safety, and a media/propaganda campaign, with the main players being the direct current (DC) based on the Thomas Edison Electric Light Company and the supporters of alternating current (AC) based on Nikola Tesla’s inventions backed by Westinghouse.\n\nWith electricity supplies in their infancy, much depended on choosing the right technology to power homes and businesses across the country. The Edison-led group argued for DC current that required a power generating station every few city blocks (single-tenant model), whereas the AC group advocated for a centralized generation with transmission lines that could move electricity great distances with minimal loss (multi-tenant model).\n\nThe lower cost of AC power distribution and fewer generating stations eventually prevailed. Multi-tenancy is equivalent of AC when it comes to cost, convenience, and network effect. You can read more about how this analogy relates to SaaS in the book by Nicholas Carr, “Big Switch,” a Wall Street Journal bestseller. It’s “the best read so far about the significance of the shift to cloud computing,” said Financial Times. The EHS software industry has been a laggard in adopting multi-tenancy.\n\nGiven these fundamental differences between different modes of delivering software as a service, it is clear that the future lies with the multi-tenant model.\n\nWhether all customer data is put onto one database or onto multiple databases is of no consequence to the customer. For those arguing against it, it is like an assertion that companies “do not want to put all their money into the same bank account as their competitors,” when what those companies are doing is putting their money into different accounts at the same bank.\n\nWhen customers of a financial institution share what does not need to be partitioned—for example, the transactional logic and the database maintenance tools, security, and physical infrastructure and insurance offered by a major financial institution—then they enjoy advantages of security, capacity, consistency, and reliability that would not be affordably deliverable in isolated parallel systems.\n\nIn enterprise cloud applications and cloud application platforms, multi-tenancy yields a compelling the combination of efficiency and capability without sacrificing flexibility or governance.\n\nWhen a software provider seeks to blur the distinctions between one technology and another, there’s usually just one reason: because they are unable to offer the superior technology to their customers, and hope to persuade their customers that real differences are not relevant to their needs. Multi-tenant platforms for enterprise on-demand applications represent genuine opportunities for customer advantage. The reality of multi-tenant differentiation is acknowledged by authoritative industry analysts such as Gartner, whose March 2007 announcement1 of its Outsourcing Summit that month included this definition of Software as a Service:\n\n“Hosted software based on a single set of common code and data definitions that are consumed in a one-to-many model.”\n\nIn other words, hosting models that do not offer the leverage of multi-tenancy don’t belong in the same discussion as the value proposition implied by the term, “SaaS”. Multi-tenancy is a difference that makes a difference.\n\n—\n\nReferences\n\n1Gartner Inc., “SaaS will have significant impact on IT services and outsourcing providers,” Tekrati, 7 March 2007\n\nPeriodically, our CEO Blog will host blog contributions from Locus employees, who will be blogging about environmental data, compliance, sustainability, or other topics of interest to our customers and partners. We hope you will enjoy these different perspectives, and we invite you to join in the conversation, either in the comments field below, or on our social media channels:\n\n[sc_icon icon=”facebook” shape=”circle” color=”#ffffff” background_color=”#52a6ea” size=”mdsmall” link=”https://facebook.com/locustechnologies” link_target=”_blank”] [sc_icon icon=”twitter” shape=”circle” color=”#ffffff” background_color=”#52a6ea” size=”mdsmall” link=”https://twitter.com/Locustec” link_target=”_blank”] [sc_icon icon=”linked-in” shape=”circle” color=”#ffffff” background_color=”#52a6ea” size=”mdsmall” link=”https://www.linkedin.com/company/locus-technologies” link_target=”_blank”]\n\nAnyone in the tech industry will tell you that building software can be a costly endeavor.\n\nOn top of the overhead expenses, selling enterprise software means long sales cycles and competing in a crowded field of vendors.\n\nTo succeed in this cutthroat environment, you need a differentiator—somewhere your company excels compared to the other players in the field. This differentiator will be your main focus in every aspect of the business. It allows you to effectively prioritize and execute your tasks, maintaining an edge on the competition.\n\nWorking at Locus, a question I often hear is, “How do you hire and retain top engineering talent, when you’re competing with the big tech titans in Silicon Valley?”\n\nMy answer is simple and straightforward: our environmental focus. Ever since Locus started as a company, our vision has been to deliver technologies that optimize the management of environmental data for our customers. Our goal is to be the best technology partner for helping our customers manage their environmental footprint.\n\nTo work on Locus’ product development team, you must either be exceptional in cloud/SaaS technologies or in environmental engineering. Our ability to integrate these two specialties is our differentiator. Other vendors may have capability in one area, but very few can claim both.\n\nAt Locus, these two types of engineers work side by side, collaborating to deliver new software. This dynamic creates incredible opportunities for engineers to learn new things and experience the satisfaction of being challenged at work. At the same time, it creates an ideal team to deliver the best products to address the environmental health & safety market.\n\nRecently, our engineering team was working on our vapor intrusion and indoor air management application, built for our customers for compliance and regulatory reporting. Environmental engineers were best suited for this project because they thoroughly understand the regulatory compliance process. Having environmental engineers collaborating directly with software designers on the team, rather than relying on consultants, allowed us to quickly design a reliable system for automating GHG tracking. This is just one example of how we integrate a unique set of skills and expertise in our company.\n\nProjects such as this one help reaffirm my belief that finding a unique differentiator is the key to success. Find what makes you stand out in the market, and pride yourself on that quality.\n\n—\n\nStill looking for the right EHS software to revolutionize your environmental and compliance initiatives?

In his role, he directs the work of a broad range of technical personnel and is a coach and mentor for team members across multiple and diverse projects.\n\nBefore joining Locus as the Director of Software Engineering, he spent over 14 year with HP Software leading development of products like IT Governance, Project Management and Cloud Service Automation while working with teams across the globe in US, Czech Republic, India, and China.\n\nIn the EHS&S industry, companies and organizations demand a unique set of needs from their software applications.\n\nThere are many software tools and applications available out there aimed to assist with any aspect of your company. Many buyers get stuck on the question of how to find the perfect app solution for their business needs, especially considering that these needs grow and evolve over time. They spend money and time researching the perfect app that fits their unique situation.\n\nAn unexpected solution to this dilemma lies in a configurable software platform— designed specifically to allow you to easily build and reconfigure apps that perfectly fit your business needs.\n\nDeveloping custom applications on a cloud-based application development platform has a number of advantages that you should consider before deciding to buy an off-the-shelf application that happens to tick all the boxes on your features list. This solution delivers easily configurable, scalable, and well-integrated applications that will help you drive your productivity and success in the future.\n\nLower long-term costs\n\nCustom app development on a platform means you can create a custom application that is specifically tailored to your company’s needs, as well as being focused on scalability and efficiency.\n\nOff-the-shelf software may initially seem like the faster and cheaper option, but the lack of customization for day-to-day operations is ultimately inefficient (and often leads users to invent their own manual processes outside the software to compensate for the software’s inefficiencies). As the application is used more often, even the smallest issues can grow exponentially, leading to costs that will far outweigh your initial savings on the off-the-shelf software.\n\nBetter productivity = higher ROI\n\nConfigurable custom applications that are specifically designed with your needs in mind will help your team work faster and smarter. Well-integrated apps on a unified platform can yield major efficiency gains, since all the data is in one place and users do not have to switch between different applications or websites as part of their workflow.\n\nAnother added benefit comes from the interoperability of apps coexisting on the same platform, which can drastically reduce input requirements, as well as the need for multiple QA/QC processes. Input once, use many times.\n\nSave time, adapt faster\n\nThe ability of an organization to quickly shift technology strategies can mean the difference between dominance and obsolescence in many industries. A configurable platform enables you to rapidly customize and deploy your application, with a fraction of the time and resources that would be required for an off-the-shelf application.\n\nCommon UI, data and security model\n\nPlatform applications share the same user interface, security, and configuration-data model amongst all apps. There is no need to manage data integration or sync issues.\n\nAdditionally, new software upgrades are easily deployed to a large number of users, so users will remain in a familiar interface across all apps. These benefits support faster and easier deployment, as well as rapid user adoption— both of which are critical to success and a high ROI for any solution.\n\nBuilt-in support for integration with other platforms\n\nAdvanced APIs (to support integration of third-party, enterprise, Internet of Things, or legacy applications not on the platform) are interoperable and will help maximize your team’s productivity.\n\nOff-the-shelf software may not be compatible with other programs. You may need one software product to read IoT data from sensors, another to launch an incident management workflow, and yet another to file a new SAP purchase order. If the programs do not communicate effectively, they will hinder your work process.\n\nA custom platform app can integrate with a wider set of APIs from different software and data partners, providing a seamless flow of information.\n\nMobile capability\n\nMobile applications have become a significant extension of any web-based application. A configurable app platform inherently supports an easy transition from a web app to a mobile app, without any extra development efforts. This saves time, money, and resources needed to maintain the mobile app. It also resolves any data integration or usability issues that integrating a third-party, custom mobile app could cause with your application.\n\n—\n\nStill looking for the right EHS software to revolutionize your environmental and compliance initiatives?

At Locus, Rehan gets the opportunity to combine both his passions, making his job much more fun and intriguing.\n\nAfter graduating from Purdue with a degree in computer engineering, he spent the next 10 years working for industry leaders including HP, Oracle, and ServiceNow. Now at Locus, he’s a senior software engineer in the Locus Platform dev team, an agile dev team lead and a self-proclaimed Chief Hackathon Officer.\n\nIn today’s Internet-driven age, consumers are overwhelmed by an abundance of choices and information on every conceivable product on the marketplace. The same is true for businesses looking to buy software solutions. Selecting an enterprise-wide EHS&S software solution can be a feat for any organization.\n\nWhether you have been tasked to research vendors from the EHS shop window, or you are driving the data evolution in your business to move from spreadsheets (or worse – paper) to a 21st century-ready alternative— the task at hand can seem daunting and fraught with challenge.\n\nEstablishing a timeline and setting milestones along the way will help you break down your mission into manageable, bite-size chunks. Here are some helpful tips to find the right EHS vendor for you — and remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint!\n\nWho are the stakeholders?\n\nAs the individual spearheading this project, you are not the only one with skin in the game, nor is this likely confined to your team. Multiple business units, divisions, and departments are not only going to have to use a new EHS software solution – they need to like doing so.\n\nThe different stakeholders also come with their own individual business goals, and they will be looking to the new EHS software solution to assist them. Can you carefully engage different areas of your business to find the key drivers?\n\nEven better – assign project leaders within business units to join your selection process, attending demos and providing critical feedback along the way. After all, more heads are better than one.\n\nThe nice-to-have’s vs. the need-to-have’s\n\nMany of us in the EHS&S industry share similar passions, such as the desire to help reduce climate change and help businesses move to more environmentally-friendly ways of operating.\n\nSadly, this isn’t at the top of every company’s list of priorities. But we can all agree that the most important and critical areas are compliance-driven.\n\nThink about which local, state, and federal regulations you are bound by and must adhere to at all costs. It’s all well and good, having a software that can calculate CO2 emissions saved from a new “green” initiative. But shouldn’t it also be smart enough to alert you when a permit is up for renewal?\n\nTake time to compile a list of all areas you need to keep on top of. The right software should be able to keep you one step ahead, not left scrambling around, collecting data from all of your sites to meet a certain deadline.\n\nWho to engage?\n\nTrying to select a shortlist of vendors to demo with is no easy feat, especially when an Internet search throws up 20 pages of results. Fortunately, there are plenty of independent sources and conferences that exist specifically to help you in this endeavor. The National Association of Environmental Managers (NAEM) is one example. Networking with other EHS professionals can lead to recommendations and “been there, done that” advice on who the key players are.\n\nIt’s also important to remember that EHS vendors are not necessarily built for every terrain, and some specialize in different areas (i.e., health and safety, air emissions, waste management, etc.). I have yet to come across two businesses with the exact same EHS needs and requirements, so remember to regard your own company as the unique entity that it is.\n\nOnce you have a feel for the vendors that are most suitable for your needs, you should start engaging sales professionals in initial 20-30 minute conversations on what you are trying to achieve, as well as finding out more from vendors on their potential suitability for your project.\n\nEvaluating the market\n\nOnce you have a shortlist of worthy candidates, the next logical step is to schedule some demos. I recommend a 60-90 minute demo to begin with – anything shorter is not worthwhile to get a full grasp on the software capabilities.\n\nThere seems to be two schools of thought regarding demos and how much information to provide to the vendor, prior to the big day. Some companies like to keep their cards close to their chest and ask to see the “out-of-the-box” functionality. Others choose to provide the vendor upfront with their detailed requirements, existing reports, and sample data, in order for the demo to focus specifically on what the customer is looking to solve.\n\nI favor the latter approach, as it gives the vendor the opportunity to tailor the demo to the needs that are of most importance to the customer. This helps both sides to focus the conversation on exactly how the software functionality will make the customer’s job easier. Tell them what you want to achieve or what you’re struggling with, and let them do the work of showing you how their product will solve all your problems. And quite frankly, if you are looking to catch out a vendor who doesn’t have everything you need, then the relationship is already off to a pretty bad start!\n\nLonger sessions and “focus groups” can be arranged as a follow-up. Second and third demos are par for the course in most selection processes. These additional demos will give you a chance to whittle down the competition, plus give you the opportunity to reflect and to go back to the vendors with any additional questions, requirements, and clarifications.\n\nGoing steady\n\nAs you continue through the purchasing process, you will find yourself building bonds with the best vendors. This working relationship is key to a lasting experience that assists your business in getting the “mission-critical” EHS work done.\n\nThe best EHS vendors will have a healthy mix of subject matter experts, project managers, developers, and sales professionals – all dedicated to keeping your business compliant and happy enough to renew your subscription, year after year.\n\nPricing is obviously a concern for any customer, and it’s important that you fully understand what the vendor is going to charge you. The last thing you want is to agree on a project and implementation process, only to be hit with a hefty bill once the software has been deployed – for what you felt was a minor change.\n\nUseful questions to ask:\n\nIs the software configurable?\n\nHow much support is available to me?\n\nWhat happens when you upgrade to a new version?\n\nHow much data can I store on your platform?\n\nOnce you have settled on a vendor and are ready to embark on the implementation, the real fun begins. Now you can start to reap the benefits of your carefully planned and executed selection process.\n\nGood luck out there!\n\n—\n\nStill looking for the right EHS software to revolutionize your environmental and compliance initiatives?

His current role with Locus is Sales Engineer, working with new and prospective customers to identify their EHS targets.\n\nThe first deal limiting greenhouse gasses from international aviation has been sealed after years of negotiations. Carbon emissions from international aviation will be capped under a global agreement to limit the impact of commercial flights on the climate. The deal launches a voluntary compliance system from 2021 that would become mandatory in 2027. Airlines spent about $181 billion on fuel last year, and this deal would add between $5 and $24 billion in additional costs, depending on the price of carbon at the time. The aviation carbon cuts were agreed in Montreal by national representatives at the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO.\n\nThe deal comes in a critical week for climate policy when the Paris agreement to stabilize climate change passed a key threshold for becoming law. International aviation is responsible for putting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year than the whole of the Germany or the UK. And until now, there has been no global consensus on how to address aviation emissions.\n\nCO2 will be allowed to grow to 2020, but after that, emissions will need to be offset. The deal will be voluntary to 2026, but most major nations are expected to take part. Airlines that pollute more than the prescribed level after 2020 would have to purchase carbon-offsetting credits.\n\nThe offsetting proposal is especially controversial. Airlines are striving to make planes more efficient, but the industry can’t innovate fast enough to contain its dynamic growth.\n\nThat led to the proposal for offsetting – but sometimes offsetting by planting trees is not enough and is prone to double-counting.\n\nOne way to offset emissions, besides planting trees, is using trees’ and other plants spoils to make sustainable fuels. The effort to use sustainable fuels has already started, and manufacturers and airlines support of alternative fuels is high.\n\nTo that end, the US biofuels leader, Amyris, Inc is developing an alternative aviation jet fuel made with a sustainably-sourced hydrocarbon using Amyris’s proprietary synthetic biology platform. It is one of the most promising developments in aviation fuels in decades.\n\nAmyris’ jet fuel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared with petroleum fuels, when compared unmixed to petroleum fuels on a one-to-one basis, according to Amyris.\n\nAttempts have been made for nearly two decades to include aviation and shipping in the UN’s climate agreements, but both sectors have managed to avoid firm targets.\n\nUS EPA earlier this year issued a final scientific assessment that concluded that carbon emissions from aircraft endanger public health and welfare, a legal prerequisite the agency must take before regulating those emissions in the US. It is widely expected that EPA will introduce its set of rules for regulating domestic aircraft emissions in the US. Domestic aviation represents about 40% of total carbon-dioxide output from commercial flights.\n\nEnvironmental groups said they hope the action to curb airline emissions will spur a similar cap on maritime CO2 production. Maritime emissions aren’t covered by the Paris climate deal even though the industry is considered a major carbon emitter.\n\nAll these emissions trackings must be managed and verified and will require companies to install scalable and intelligent database systems like Locus SaaS-based EIM and Locus Platform that already help many companies comply with various emission laws and regulations around the world.\n\nLocus helps customers leverage data, analytical, cloud, and mobile capabilities via IoT-to-Locus SaaS platform\n\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., 9 August 2016 — Locus Technologies (Locus), the industry leader in cloud-based EHS software, announced today that its multi-tenant SaaS Platform fully interoperates with the Internet of Things (IoT). The company has been the pioneering innovator in the EHS software space since 1999 when it first introduced its Automation and Data Management Groups, which used Internet-based technologies to manage and control vast amounts of data generated at the company’s customer sites.\n\nLocus’ automation technologies have evolved over the years to encompass the vast array of Internet-connected devices, sensors, programmable logic controllers, and other instruments to gather and organize large amounts of streaming data.\n\nThe IoT interconnects uniquely identifiable embedded computing, testing, and monitoring devices within the existing Internet infrastructure and software platform. Locus IoT services offer connectivity beyond machine-to-machine communications and cover a variety of protocols, domains, and applications.\n\n“The IoT is one of the fastest-growing trends in tech. When applied to the environmental monitoring industry, there is an overwhelming influx of information that has to be dealt with; many companies are concerned that the sheer volume of data will render the information useless. For that reason, Locus invested in smart software and intelligent databases to deal with this new trend, long before IoT had a common name. We aspire to change the face of the environmental monitoring industry,” said Neno Duplan, CEO of Locus.\n\nIn any industry, when all incoming data are connected and centrally accessible through a multi-tenant SaaS application, the flow of information is much more efficient and effective. For example, instead of having a separate data collection protocol from software applications for water quality management, waste management, GHG management, EHS compliance and incident management, a company can have all emissions-related records—regardless of whether they originated in the laboratory, field, or Internet-connected monitoring device—in a single system of record. From this single system of record, they can manage compliance activities, perform data gathering and monitoring, manage water treatment systems remotely, and manage resources for sustainability reporting at the same time. Adopting such a structure offers Locus’ customers the ability to converge all incoming sources of information to create a much-needed integrated enterprise platform for EH&S+S management.\n\nAt the crux of this integration is Locus’ highly scalable and end-user configurable Locus Platform. The interoperability combines the Locus Platform as a service with its automation, mobile, and IoT platforms. The combined IoT suite will be hosted on Locus’ cloud.\n\n“By combining our cloud platform and Internet of Things (IoT) platforms to make them interoperable, we provide the single platform for our customers that helps them lower their operational costs, reduce cycle time, and ultimately become better stewards of the environment. This integration will give our customers more analytics from connected devices,” added Duplan."
