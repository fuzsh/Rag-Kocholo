        "text": "What is NetSuite?\n\nNetSuite is a cloud-based suite of enterprise-grade business management tools all managed under one excellent platform. NetSuite’s core functionality is built around enterprise resource planning (ERP). In addition, it has since expanded into a number of different product offerings throughout the years including: CRM, HRM, eCommerce, PSA, and more.\n\nMeet with a NetSuite Expert\n\nWhat is an ERP and Why Use a Cloud-Based ERP?\n\nSo let’s back up and start at the beginning.\n\nAn enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is a software platform that helps businesses manage and integrate their core business processes, such as financials, supply chain, manufacturing, and human resources. ERP systems provide a central repository of information that can be accessed and shared by different departments and team members within an organization.\n\nERP systems are designed to support the efficient and effective operation of a business by automating and streamlining various processes, such as accounting, inventory management, and order processing. They can also provide real-time data and insights that can help businesses make more informed decisions and better understand their operations.\n\nERP systems are commonly used by medium to large businesses, and can be implemented on-premises or as a cloud-based solution. Some popular examples of ERP systems include SAP, Oracle, Acumatica and, of course, Oracle NetSuite.\n\nWhy Would You Want to Use an ERP?\n\nImproved efficiency: An ERP system can automate and streamline various business processes, reducing the time and effort required to complete tasks and freeing up resources to focus on more important tasks.\n\nEnhanced decision-making: An ERP system can provide real-time data and insights that can help businesses make more informed decisions.\n\nIncreased collaboration: An ERP system can facilitate communication and collaboration between departments and team members, promoting a more cohesive and integrated work environment.\n\nGreater flexibility: An ERP system can be customized to meet the specific needs and goals of a business, and can be easily scaled up or down as needed.\n\nReduced costs: An ERP system can help businesses reduce operational costs by streamlining processes, eliminating the need for manual data entry, and reducing the risk of errors and discrepancies.\n\nCloud ERP’s and Their Benefits\n\nA cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is a software platform that is hosted and delivered via the internet, rather than being installed and run on a business’s own servers. This means that businesses can access the ERP system from anywhere with an internet connection, rather than being tied to a specific location.\n\nThere are several benefits to using a cloud-based ERP system:\n\nCost savings: With a cloud-based ERP system, businesses don’t need to invest in expensive hardware and software infrastructure. They can instead pay a subscription fee to access the system, which can be more cost-effective in the long run.\n\nScalability: Cloud-based ERP systems can be easily scaled up or down to meet the changing needs of a business. This can be especially useful for businesses that experience fluctuations in demand or are experiencing rapid growth.\n\nFlexibility: Cloud-based ERP systems can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, which makes it easier for businesses to work remotely or to collaborate with team members in different locations.\n\nSecurity: Cloud-based ERP systems often have strong security measures in place to protect sensitive business data.\n\nIntegration: Cloud-based ERP systems can easily integrate with other business applications, such as customer relationship management (CRM) and supply chain management (SCM) systems, allowing for a more seamless workflow.\n\nSo Why is NetSuite Popular?\n\nNow that we know what ERP and cloud-based ERP tools are and why their benefits, we can begin to look at what makes NetSuite such a special cloud-based ERP tool.\n\nNetSuite is more than just the flavor of the year ERP tool. You can argue NetSuite began the cloud revolution that is currently sweeping through offices around the globe. NetSuite’s accession to the top of the pack is based on disrupting the old status quo and changing the way people do business for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis sense of disruption has stayed with the organization and to this day, pushes them to be the leading edge of business software technology.\n\nSo after 20 years of successfully convincing the public that the cloud is the way forward, NetSuite has climbed to the top of the pile as the number one ERP solution available today, but what specifically does it owe this success to?\n\nMeet with a NetSuite Expert\n\nNetSuite Benefits\n\n1.

The SuiteCloud platform is the environment that all of the features and functionality we previously discussed were built on.\n\nIt’s important to look at this as its own feature because as a NetSuite user you can use the platform to extend the usefulness of the NetSuite ERP as well as compare the platform NetSuite uses to other ERP platforms. No two ERP platforms are the same and they can be the difference in things like customization options, configuration, security, integration, and ease of use.\n\nHere is a visualization of the platform. As you can see, the platform includes a lot more than just the features we discussed in the modules section. For more information on the SuiteCloud platform, I recommend you check out this page as well as this datasheet. For now let’s discuss some of the most important features of the SuiteCloud platform.\n\nOracle NetSuite Analytics\n\nNetSuite Analytics is a feature of the NetSuite SuiteCloud platform that allows users to create custom reports and dashboards to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and make data-driven decisions. With NetSuite Analytics, you can access real-time data from across your business, including financial data, sales data, customer data, and operational data.\n\nSome of the main features of NetSuite Analytics include:\n\nCustom reports: You can create custom reports to display data in a variety of formats, including tables, charts, and graphs.

It is important to distinguish customization from configuration for this discussion so I will define these to words for you now.\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion:\n\nCustomization – refers to anything that will require scripting or a third party application to modify or enhance the NetSuite platform.\n\nConfiguration – Refers to anything that is natively included with the SuiteCloud platform that allows you to enhance and tailor the NetSuite platform to your specific needs. Examples are using NetSuite’s form builder or workflow automation features, custom reports, and custom fields.\n\nThis section will only be discussing ways in which the SuiteCloud platform allows you to customize the platform for your unique needs. Before we get into the different ways you can customize NetSuite, I want to mention here that customizing NetSuite should be looked at as a last resort. If there is a NetSuite module or a third-party add-on available it is usually suggested to pursue that path as opposed to creating your own customization. That said, here are the ways you can customize NetSuite:\n\nSuiteScript\n\nSuiteScript is a JavaScript-based programming language that is used to customize and extend the functionality of the NetSuite platform. With SuiteScript, you can create custom scripts that automate business processes, integrate with other systems, and customize the user experience.\n\nThere are several types of SuiteScripts, including:\n\nUser event scripts: User event scripts are triggered by specific actions within NetSuite, such as creating a new record or saving a form. You can use user event scripts to automate processes, validate data, or perform custom actions.\n\nScheduled scripts: Scheduled scripts are scripts that are automatically run on a regular basis, such as daily, weekly, or monthly. You can use scheduled scripts to perform periodic tasks, such as generating reports or sending emails.\n\nClient scripts: Client scripts are scripts that run in the client’s web browser and can interact with the user interface. You can use client scripts to customize the look and feel of your NetSuite account or to add custom functionality to forms and pages.\n\nMap/reduce scripts: Map/reduce scripts are used to process large sets of data in a distributed manner. They can be used to perform complex calculations, data transformations, or data integrations.\n\nOracle NetSuite Integration API’s\n\nNetSuite integration refers to the process of connecting NetSuite with other systems, such as your accounting software, customer relationship management (CRM) system, or e-commerce platform. Integrating NetSuite with other systems can help you automate business processes, exchange data, and streamline your operations.\n\nThere are several ways you can integrate NetSuite with other systems, including:\n\nUsing NetSuite’s native integration tools: NetSuite offers a range of integration tools, such as the NetSuite Connector and the NetSuite Web Services API, that allow you to connect NetSuite with other systems.\n\nUsing third-party integration solutions: There are a number of third-party solutions that can help you integrate NetSuite with other systems, such as integrations developed by NetSuite partners or independent software vendors (ISVs).\n\nUsing custom integration solutions: You can develop custom integration solutions using tools such as SuiteScript or SuiteFlow. This requires technical expertise and programming skills, and may be suitable for more complex or custom integration requirements.\n\nFor more information on this subject, check out our guide on NetSuite Integration.\n\nSuiteFlow Automation\n\nSuiteFlow is a feature of the NetSuite platform that allows you to create custom workflows to automate business processes and streamline your operations. SuiteFlow is a visual workflow builder that allows you to define the actions and conditions that trigger a workflow.\n\nYou can use SuiteFlow to automate tasks such as sending emails, updating records, or creating tasks. You can also use SuiteFlow to validate data before it is saved, or to customize the user experience by hiding or displaying fields or buttons based on specific conditions.\n\nNetSuite ERP Configuration\n\nNow we’ll discuss how the SuiteCloud platform can allow you to configure the NetSuite platform to better meet your specific needs.\n\nCustom Fields\n\nCustom fields in NetSuite are additional data fields that you can create to store information that is specific to your business. Custom fields can be added to most types of records in NetSuite, such as transactions, contacts, and items.\n\nYou can use custom fields to store a wide variety of information, such as customer preferences, project status, product specifications, or internal notes. Custom fields can help you track and manage data that is specific to your business and not covered by the standard fields provided by NetSuite.\n\nCustom fields can be created using a variety of data types, including text, numbers, dates, and lists. You can also set up custom fields to be mandatory, hidden, or read-only, depending on your needs.\n\nCustom Forms\n\nCustom forms in NetSuite are customized versions of the standard forms that are used to enter and view data in NetSuite. You can use custom forms to tailor the look and feel of your NetSuite account, to capture additional data, or to simplify the user experience.\n\nThere are several types of custom forms in NetSuite, including:\n\nTransaction forms: Transaction forms are used to enter and view data for transactions such as invoices, sales orders, and purchase orders. You can use custom transaction forms to capture additional data or to customize the layout and appearance of these forms.\n\nCustom records: Custom records are custom types of records that you can create in NetSuite to track different types of information. You can use custom record forms to enter and view data for these records.\n\nCustom pages: Custom pages are custom pages that you can create in NetSuite to display data or functionality. You can use custom pages to create a custom user interface or to display custom reports or dashboards.\n\nCustom Workflows\n\nA workflow in NetSuite is a series of automated actions that are triggered by specific events within the platform. Workflows can be used to streamline business processes, automate tasks, and improve efficiency.\n\nYou can use workflows in NetSuite to:\n\nAutomate tasks: You can use workflows to automate tasks such as sending emails, updating records, or creating tasks. For example, you can create a workflow to automatically send an email to a customer when their order is shipped.\n\nValidate data: You can use workflows to validate data before it is saved to ensure that it meets specific criteria. For example, you can create a workflow to ensure that all invoices have a valid customer and a positive total amount.\n\nCustomize the user experience: You can use workflows to customize the user experience by hiding or displaying fields or buttons based on specific conditions. For example, you can create a workflow to hide a discount field if the customer is not eligible for a discount.\n\nMeet with a NetSuite Expert\n\nNetSuite ERP Adoption\n\nWith over 33,000 active customers, tons of good reviews, and blessings from all credible institutions that rate software solutions, NetSuite can make a good case for calling itself the number one ERP solution on the planet.\n\nIn G2Crowds “Magic Quadrant” NetSuite is ranked number 1 overall. If you’re not familiar with magic quadrants, they’re a great way to tell what the market thinks of an enterprise software solution. The data is based on credible reviews from real customers. The closer your solution is to the top right of the quadrant the better the market is responding to your solution.\n\nWho Uses Oracle NetSuite?\n\nWhile plenty of large enterprises use the NetSuite platform, according to G2Crowd, SAP still reigns supreme in the upper echelons of business. However, in 2023, NetSuite is hot on their tail. A few years ago SAP’s reign was unchecked. This is not the case in 2023.\n\nBut while NetSuite is happy to be considered a leader in the enterprise category, it really shines in the mid-market and SME segments. Which is logical as many of the advantages of cloud-based solutions apply more specifically to businesses with smaller budgets.\n\nIndustry Adoption\n\nNetSuite is flexible enough to be adopted by a number of different industries. However, Computer and Software companies currently dominate the landscape.\n\nPricing Model\n\nIn most cases, NetSuite is bought with the help a NetSuite partner that is known as a VAR or Value Added Reseller. Often, would-be NetSuite users are not familiar enough with the NetSuite platform to make optimal decisions during the configuration and implementation phases of the project. These users rely on the VAR to make those decisions for them. Along with consulting fresh NetSuite users, VARs also help negotiate the price of NetSuite, add an extra layer of support to help with user questions, and can do a lot of the heavy lifting with the initial implementation.\n\nPurchases can be made directly through NetSuite. This is only recommended if you have a lot of NetSuite experience aboard your team, are preparing to use the SuiteSuccess program offered by NetSuite, or are planning on doing the NetSuite Implementation alone.\n\nNetSuite Partners\n\nAs you could imagine, a platform like NetSuite has attracted quite the community around it. A number of businesses have stepped up to provide additional services and software that benefit NetSuite users. NetSuite has arranged it’s ecosystem of partners in into these categories:\n\nSolution providers: Solution Providers are companies that sell NetSuite software and solutions to their customers. They may also provide implementation and customization services.\n\nAlliance Partners: Service providers are companies that offer professional services, such as consulting, implementation, training, and support, to help customers get the most out of their NetSuite software.\n\nSuiteCloud Development Network (SDN): SDN partners are companies that have developed integrations or customizations that enhance the functionality of NetSuite. These partners may be software vendors, hardware manufacturers, or other technology companies.\n\nOEM partners: OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) partners are companies that incorporate NetSuite functionality into their own products or services.\n\nIndependent software vendors (ISVs): ISVs are companies that develop software applications that run on top of NetSuite. These applications may provide specialized functionality or integrate with other systems.\n\nReferral partners: Referral partners are companies that refer potential customers to NetSuite. They may receive a commission for successful referrals.\n\nMeet with a NetSuite Expert\n\nNetSuite Implementation\n\nNetSuite implementation refers to the process of setting up and configuring NetSuite to meet the specific needs of your business.

It has been said, the NetSuite platform is only as good as its implementation. The implementation is just as important as the product itself, and it also can be one of the largest up-front costs when purchasing NetSuite.
