        "text": "The side of the hexagonal harbour that faces the north-east is occupied by several hills covered with bushes, but which only show above ground incoherent debris of walls and ruins. I had in vain examined how this massive whole could be linked to the entire site, and nothing put me on the way to its original function, when a fortuitous event came to open a new path to my investigations. A workman employed in the excavations had pursued a badger which had slipped into a sort of burrow; the workman tried to reach it with a stake, but instead of entering a narrow conduit, he found that the stake went into a deep hole and could turn in all directions in the void. I was called and recognized indeed that this hole communicated with a large vault. Paper and dry grass lit and thrown into this hole did indeed light up a room which seemed immense to us; sounding its depth with a rope we found nearly four meters. It would not have been prudent to venture immediately into these unknown paths; the orifice was cleared to give air; but as all the flaming matter that had been thrown into the hole had burned peacefully, we had nothing to fear from the toxic air.\n\nIt was not without difficulty, however, that we succeeded in descending into this subterranean room; candles had been brought from Fiumicino, and we understood that this place had for centuries been untouched by human footsteps. Lianas and stalactites hung from the roof, small pools of water glistened in the depths, and the ground was composed of a black and fine compost. Going around this room, which was oblong, we recognized several doors perfectly free of earth and rubble, which led to other rooms, and galleries which seemed even larger to us, in the almost complete darkness in which we found ourselves. After having attached a rope to the entrance hall, the workers traversed this new labyrinth without finding the end. Every day a few new rooms were reported; they were all intact, perfectly empty, and nowhere was there any communication with the outside air.\n\nTo describe the surprise I felt on entering this underground building would be impossible for me. The arrangement of the rooms seemed to me so bizarre that I could not suspect what purpose they had been used for. We sometimes found ourselves stopped by a network of long roots which formed a veritable fabric; they were the roots of the trees which covered the ground, and which, penetrating into this void, had taken on an extraordinary development. We saw them crawling on the walls and going to seek, sometimes very far, an interstice where they could find a little topsoil. I often observed these movements which one could rightly attribute to vegetable intelligence; they had to be very singular to divert my attention from the main object of my subterranean peregrinations.\n\nThe days passed with these visits, without my being able to obtain from the inspection of the ruins any clarification, any basis, to support my operations of reconstruction. It was then that I recognized the great advantage of compass bearings. Without this instrument it would have been impossible for me to determine in which direction I had wandered for so long. But, having taken the readings of the principal walls and the longest galleries, I understood that, the underground building following the two sides of the hexagon of the harbour of Trajan, it was already a step forward for tracing the direction above ground.\n\nI had already understood during my incessant visits that this multiplicity of rooms could only belong to a palace. I had seen cisterns, chimneys with heating pipes, several substructures that were part of an atrium, but I could not yet fathom on which floor of the building I was: was it the ground floor or basement? The long stay of several people in these vaults with lights was beginning to pollute the air; moreover, a sour and nauseous odour was spreading, the origin of which I could not work out, and which the workers attributed to the presence of snakes, which hardly encouraged them to venture further; but on the other hand the hope of discovering some antiquities outweighed their fear, so that it did not take much trouble to get them back to work. The badger hole had been marked with a stake and a pavilion, it was our only landmark outside. It was absolutely necessary to provide air to our vaults by breaking through in some favourable place. Eventually I traced on the ground the course of a long gallery whose wall contained regular depressions, which seemed to me to have been windows or ventilation shafts. An excavation carried out at the presumed extremity of this gallery had all the desirable success. We went straight into the underground rooms, which were airy and could be walked through without fear of being suffocated.\n\nCalled back to Rome by the need to build instruments to draw the overall plan, I shared my discovery with a large number of artists and lovers of antiquities, who expressed the desire to visit these ruins. A festarolo of Saint Peter took care of lighting them very brightly, the Trattoria della Lepre transported its crockery and its gnocchi famosi there, to serve a feast to the visitors. The Fiumicino boats provided the tables and the benches; several loads of fiaccole or large lanterns which serve for the illumination of the cupola were transported to Ostia, and placed in each of the rooms so that they could be traversed at leisure. They began by exploring the ruins of Ostia, where the climate seemed less unhealthy since the Roman cooks had settled there. Finally they rested and sat down at the tables in the subterranean galleries. The visitors were far from suspecting that they were about to see the horrors of Phineus' feasts repeated [Phineus is a mythological figure who set a trap with a meal and the Harpies].\n\nNo sooner had they been seated than a sharp, strident, prolonged cry was heard in the depths of the galleries; everyone listened, surprised by these unknown noises which resembled the whistling of the wind through the badly joined doors. Soon black and velvety veils appeared to sweep the faces of the frightened guests; some left their places to flee, others wanted to understand the unexpected movement that was taking place in the heights of the vaults. There were thousands of bats which, awakened by the heat and the light of the lanterns, came in incalculable numbers to throw themselves on the table which was better lit than the rest, were going to burn themselves and fry in the grease of the lanterns, or fall dying on the feast dishes. Never could the harpies entering the palace of the king of Thrace cause such terror; before everyone could identify the cause of this noise, all the rooms were invaded by these nocturnal animals; the black masses which hung from the vaults and which at first appeared like inert heaps of earth and dust, began to stir and dissolve; they were agglomerations of bats whose wingspan seemed enormous, and which in reality were no less than twenty-five centimeters. The genus belonged to the species named spearhead, vespertilio hastatus. Each of the assistants had only been able to escape the impure contact of these new Harpies by a flight surrounded by a thousand obstacles. Thus ended the first visit to the ruins of the old palace.\n\nA superstitious Italian and jettatore [bringer of misfortune], the Chevalier of Castel-Nuovo [in Naples], pointed out that we received just punishment for our misdeeds by wanting to devote to frivolous pleasures the venerable remains of antiquity which only deserved our respect; but a Neapolitan architect thought that all this misadventure was due to the presence in our company of a jettatore, like the Chevalier de Castel-Nuovo. I have never been able to find out which of the two reasons was the right one. When, recovered from our surprise, we tried a few days later to clear certain rooms, we noted that the ground raised by several feet was only composed of the droppings of these bats, which obviously had chosen these underground dwellings for several centuries as their den.\n\nTo describe in an intelligible way these remarkable ruins, let us suppose them completely cleared and accessible from all sides. We will take for our route the general plan which was created with the compass with incalculable difficulties, and restored to the surface of the ground, so as to understand the entirety and the extent of the building.\n\nThe palace, the ruins of which were unearthed in such an unusual manner, was situated between the two harbours of Claudius and Trajan; its entrance faced the harbour of Claudius, and therefore looked out to sea. One arrived under a portico composed of five arcades which gave access to as many rooms, the walls of which are still covered with stucco. From there one entered an atrium 15 m. long and 9 m. 60 wide, in the middle of which is a cistern. Two large chambers, which were framed only by two pilasters (and probably by two columns on the first floor), opened to the right and left of the atrium. The back part of the building was occupied by six rooms; the entire gallery that surrounds the atrium is barrel-vaulted with openings. To the left of the entrance to the portico are six large rooms in two rows, the vaults of which take on various forms; the front rooms are pierced with windows; the rooms in the second row open onto a long gallery which communicates at its end with the first room with pilasters. Assuming a similar layout on the other side of the portico, we find in this group a majestic arrangement for the entrance to a large palace.\n\nI have reason to suppose that the rooms which I have just described belonged to the basement, firstly because they are lighted only by very narrow windows, then because the walls are covered with a rather coarse stucco, which however had received some painted decoration. The masonry of all these constructions, which appears at certain intervals under the coating, is made of concrete and reticulate work, assembled with rare precision, and indicating the good times of Roman architecture. One of the curiosities of these constructions is the varied arrangement of the vaults, which are different in all the rooms. I must add that the ensemble of all the chambers which I have just described is at right angles, while the body of the building which I am about to examine forms with the first an angle of 120 degrees, which is that of a regular hexagon. Now, as the direction of the walls of the first palace is parallel to the north side of the harbour, the direction of the second body of the building is parallel to the second side, that is to say that the palace embraced two sides of the hexagonal basin. This layout suffices to indicate that the second building which concerns us is later than the foundation of the harbour of Trajan; one must even think, based on the nature of the materials which are assembled with infinite care, and recall the belle époque of Roman art, that this building was part of the overall plan designed by the Emperor Trajan.\n\nThe second body of the building also seemed to have been intended for housing, but its layout is entirely different. On the side which looks out to the harbour of Claudius is a long gallery of more than 50 m. in length and a width of 2 m. 10 c. On the front wall one observes a series of niches, twenty of which still exist and which are equally spaced. These niches communicate with vertical channels that could lead to the supposition that they are chimneys, if they were not so numerous. Besides, we will see the heating system in another room. But these channels which are square seem to me to have no other purpose than to provide air and a little light to that gallery, which was obviously below the ground. All along the front wall runs a bench in masonry, the purpose of which does not seem very clear to me; perhaps one would find by digging along the bench a channel which would join the aqueduct of Ostia, and this gallery would be intended only for the water supply.\n\nAll the rooms which are at the level of the gallery therefore formed cellars and substructures; the entrance to the body of the building can be recognized by a triple door, opening onto a room common to the two palaces which communicated through a corridor. In the rooms to the left of the entrance, one observes chimneys or hypocausts built exactly like those of the Baths; they are inserted into the wall at a certain height above the ground, there is a high fireplace, and heating pipes which go up to the upper floors. The construction of the vaults is very simple, in spite of their apparent complexity. In the collapsed parts we see that they were made entirely of concrete; the curvature and the shapes were made of wood, and on top of that the concrete was poured which was customized by tamping; when the mass was dry, the moulds were removed and the vault was finished. Concrete constructions have lately been mentioned as a modern discovery; we see once more that, with respect to constructions, the ancients left us little to innovate. Below each atrium are cisterns which are still in an astonishing state of preservation, but it is not so easy to understand the function of a large number of oblique rooms, recesses, and dead ends, which make these ruins one of the most curious parts of the ancient Port city.\n\nThe research and study of this building occupied me for more than a month, during which a good number of curious people came to visit it; but since that time I haven't heard of it again, perhaps the entrance was again blocked by rubble and vegetation. As I published nothing on this subject, and as the population of artists then in Rome was liable to disperse, it is not surprising that these ancient ruins fell into oblivion. I have vainly sought in the modern authors who have written on the city of Ostia some indications of the time when the first discovery of these ruins, or rather of the long gallery, was made, because it is only there that I observed some traces of visits. Bergier Danville, Pirro Ligorio, and travelers who are not special, but who spoke of these ruins, like Father Labat, etc., none of them provided me with the slightest explanation.\n\n[Texier then quotes Carlo Fea's description of the discovery of the Temple of Hercules and the stamp of Messalina, without knowing his name. He continues:] The indication of the place agrees fairly well with the location of the palace, but that is all that can be said. According to the state of the stuccos which cover the major part of these walls, one can conjecture that the rooms were little inhabited, because the flower of the coating is found almost everywhere. There was no trace of modern visits, except at the entrance to the long gallery, where I thought I read the date 1764; it is not probable that all the rooms would have been visited in our time before I entered them.\n\nAlthough nothing can serve to specify the function of this building, we can assume with reason that it served as the residence of the supreme magistrate who administered the city and the port. We find in the other parts of the enclosure all the public establishments which may be necessary in a large military arsenal, the castrum, the warehouses for parts of the rigging, the warehouses for grain and merchandise, the naumachia to exercise the sailors, finally the baths, bazaars, temples and civil dwellings, which we are going to deal with. This palace would also have served as the Emperor's residence during his visits to Ostia; but we only know the substructures. It is probable that if one excavated in the upper part, and the plan would be a certain guide, one would find numerous remains of the decoration of the building. In the most central and most beautiful position of the city, that is on the peninsula that separates the harbour of Claudius from that of Trajan, are imposing ruins superior to all the others in terms of height and extension, and therefore more than the others studied by antiquarians. [Lanciani then mentions the earlier descriptions and continues:] The recent excavations have resolved this very important question for the topography of Portus: they have shown us an imperial palace of great magnificence and extension including in its perimeter baths, atriums, porticoes, temples, gardens and even a theatre; very few traces of which monuments appear in my plan, not having had the good fortune to be present at the excavations which were soon covered over in such a way as to make any topographical survey impossible. Nonetheless, here is some news that I was able to gather on the spot.\n\nThe imperial palace is bounded to the north by a small road which divides it from the warehouses, to the east by the harbour of Trajan, to the south by another path which separates it from the forum, and to the west by the harbour of Claudius. Almost the entire surface was excavated in the 1864-67 working seasons, and my guide (May 22, 1866) was unable to express the admiration felt at the sight of such imposing buildings. The main decoration of the building consisted of a very long portico of columns placed on the side of the harbour of Claudius, along which the main apartments were connected. The portico appeared arranged in this way: at a height of 2.50 m. above the current water level of the marsh large travertine corbels project from the facade wall for about 0.60 m., on which arches are resting with a diameter of 3 m. An elegant brick cornice protrudes for 0.22 m. on top of the arches, above which the parapet of the terrace must have risen, now almost totally destroyed. The general line of the building is interrupted from time to time by small towers that jut out for 3 m. Beyond the parapet runs the street, or terrace, 6 m. wide, below which is a corresponding very long corridor, which we will discuss below. In the masonry of the vault, they assured me, was a conduit without inscription of about 0.15 in diameter, which later changed its course in the direction of the marine baths.\n\nOn the side of the terrace opposite the parapet rose the portico with columns, the bases of which were found mostly in place, while the shafts lay broken on the ground. Perhaps due to the better-preserved remains of this portico, the denomination of palace of the hundred columns (\"palazzo delle cento colonne\") preserved by Labacco arose in the past centuries. The brick front of the building was situated about 3 m. from the middle of the columns and was interrupted by doors corresponding to the main rooms, on the arrangement of which I have been able to gather the following information:\n\nStarting from the south facade of the building and following the direction of the portico, traces of a quadrangular room terminated by an apse can still be seen on the terrain: that is, it repeats in smaller proportions the shape of the basilica adjacent to the imperial palace on the Palatine; and perhaps its function was similar. From the story of the excavators it seems that it had a mosaic floor, and representing a centauromachy. About four rooms later the same men pointed out to me a large hall with semicircular apses on the sides, and decorated with niches and columns in cipollino: perhaps it was a bathing room, if it is true that it had a floor of marble slabs and was enclosed by steps with heating provisions and hypocausts underneath. Close by this was followed by a circular room called by my guide a temple, after which it seems that an arrangement similar to the one described up to now was repeated. [Lanciani then mentions the report by Lanci and continues:] Also the temple of Hercules enclosed in the perimeter of the palace was again excavated last March [so in 1867], extracting drums of columns, finely carved capitals and three bases of 0.90 m. in diameter [later Lanciani says that a statue of Hercules, reduced to fragments yet almost entirely recomposed, was found near the presumed Barracks of the Fire Fighters, much further to the south].\n\nThe most important discovery is that of the theater existing within the same limits of the palace, not otherwise than in the Neronian one of Anzio. I don't believe it has yet been excavated, but the traces existing above the ground are so evident that I cannot explain how it has been able to escape the attention of archaeologists and especially of Canina and Texier until now. Although of mediocre proportions, the imperial theater of Portus is in all respects similar to the analogous ancient buildings: part of the scaena decorated with niches survives, and part of the substructures of the cunei, which, as is normally the case in Greek theatres, do not converge in the centre of the scaena, but at a point which is some meters in front. Behind the same scaena emerged a perfectly preserved stairway, but completely covered by lianas and brambles, after descending which with no mean effort we found a small passage with only one door on the left: but the rubble, almost reaching the archivolt, made it impossible for us to penetrate further: on the other hand, the perfect ventilation of the place offered us the possibility of penetrating those subterranean rooms from another side. And so it happened, having come across an opening half flooded by the swamp and a hundred meters away from the stairway described above, by means of which we had access to a veritable labyrinth of underground halls and corridors, the extent of which is impossible to determine, most of it being invaded by water, encumbered by rubble, without light and almost without air. Without going into minute details, I will observe the following about these subterranean rooms:\n\n1. There are currently no less than 35 practicable rooms and corridors. I do not give a description nor a plan, because both have already been published by Texier in the work quoted several times which has come into my hands only in the last few days, after he had completed both with considerable effort. In the plan provided by the famous topographer some large rooms appear, in which, despite repeated attempts, it was impossible for me to penetrate: so I also don't recall having found traces either of the heating system or of the paintings he observed.\n\n2. The nature of the walls is partly reticulate, partly brickwork of truly incredible perfection and such that I doubt it can be found in any other ancient building.\n\n3. A large part of the walls and especially the vaults are covered with fine plaster. I have not seen any graffiti, apart from some numbers.\n\n4. Each of the rooms originally received light and air from some slit windows, 0.65 high, 0.14 wide, occurring both in internal courtyards and along the exterior facade. Starting from this situation, Texier wanted to deduce the plan of the upper floor of the building from that of the underground area: but recent excavations have shown that the layout of the walls is very different on one floor and on the other: and this without any harm to the solidity of the building, since the thickness of the walls and vaults of the underground area is such that on the solid and uniform foundation formed by them, the architect could without fear raise walls with a different plan. Only a long corresponding corridor was found below the portico with columns mentioned above.\n\nIt remains to determine the author and the time of construction of the imperial palace. First of all, it should be noted that the whole of the subterranean substructures constitutes two parts of a building placed under an angle of 120 degrees: that is, parallel to two consecutive sides of Trajan's hexagon: which indicates that the building is either contemporary or later than the establishment of the harbour. But other documents clarify the question even better. Here are two fragments of inscriptions I saw among the ruins of the palace:\n\n...TRAIAN...\n\n...VI COS DE... ...TRAIANO\n\n...NT MAX\n\n...cosVI.PP\n\n...NI.FELIC\n\nboth with the date of the sixth consulate of Trajan, that is of the year 112 AD. Now although most of the coins of that prince with the inscription PORTVM TRAIANI SC have his fifth consulate, there are also authentic specimens with the date of the VI, a diversity which I believe is related to the duration of the work on the port which began perhaps in 103 and was completed around 112. It therefore appears that as soon as the work required by the needs of navigation was completed, the construction of the imperial palace began. Stamps extracted from its ruins confirm this fact. Here are the main ones: [discussion of brick stamps from 114, 115 and 116 AD]. Some restorations of the palace must have been carried out during the reign of Hadrian, according to the following stamps also found there: [discussion of brick stamps from 123 AD]. The palace received new and more important embellishments under the Antonines, especially in the southern part where I have found many examples of the following stamps: [discussion of brick stamps from 144, 154 and c. 157 AD]."
