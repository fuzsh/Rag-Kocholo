        "text": "1. Introduction\n\n2 The second part focuses on the stress patterns of Italian loanwords in English dictionaries and investigates the potential stress match between the two languages.\n\n2. Stress assignment of Italian loanwords in English pronunciation dictionaries\n\n2.1. Corpus building\n\n3The final corpus is based on the data of three major references in English: the Oxford English Dictionary (henceforth OED), the Longman Pronunciation Dictionary (henceforth LPD) and the Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary (henceforth EPD). The last two sources are reference works concerning English pronunciation while the OED gives access, through its large database, to numbers of representative loanwords. The loanwords extracted from the OED also include phonetic transcriptions when they are attested.\n\n<-VC2V#> (Italian)\n\n→\n\n<-VCV#> (English)\n\nburatto\n\n→\n\nborato\n\n5When the structures of the last two syllables, whose influence on stress assignment appears to be fundamental, are modified through the borrowing process, the corresponding items are not conserved because stress comparison would prove to be vain.\n\nItalian\n\nEnglish\n\nteleferica\n\n→\n\nteleferic\n\n6Despite the OED precious etymological resources, source languages may prove to be difficult to determine. Some loanwords (i.e. pasquinade, mora and moto) have an uncertain origin that might be dual according to the OED. They, therefore, are not selected either. The corpus building is systematically carried out with an etymological double-check, because it turns out that some sections of the OED are currently updated, thus possibly modifying the initial data Pinnavaia used in her work. This uncertain etymology is not relevant to our study because only Italian loanwords are taken into account.\n\n7On the contrary, variant spellings that do not modify <VCV#> structures in both languages are preserved.\n\nItalian\n\nEnglish\n\nbalcone\n\n→\n\nbalcony\n\ncembalo\n\n→\n\ncymbalo\n\nletterato\n\n→\n\nliterato\n\n8After having applied these first lexicographic criteria to the lists Pinnavaia built, the resulting list of Italian loanwords is composed of 534 items. However, 89 out of these 534 loanwords are obsolete in the OED. Those outdated loanwords, whose entries do not contain any phonetic information, turn out to be useless and have to be rejected. The entire list of obsolete Italian loanwords is found below:\n\n5 The items in bold letters between brackets correspond to the corresponding Italian terms when diffe (...)\n\nalture (altura), ancora, antelucano, appassionate (appassionato), argin(e) (argine), balsamo, berlina, bollito, bona-roba (buenaroba), botano (bottana), brendice (brindesi/brindisi), buckone (boccone), burratine (burattino), caricatura, carnadine (carnadino), celestrine/celestine (cilestrino/celestino), centurine (centurino), clarissimo, cornuto, crociate (crociata), enamorate (innamorato), entrata, entrate (entrata), faciata (facciata), fantastico, festino, fincture (finctura), frittado (frittata), gallantissimo (galantissimo), gallature (gallatura), glorioso, gossipine (gossipina), governatrice, imboscata, porporate (porporato), granitone, Greco, ignaro, imbroccata, improviso, inspiritate (inspiritato), intagliature (intagliatura), intrico, intrigo, Liatico (liatico), lujula (lugliola), malevolo, malgrado, marsoline (marzolino), melancholico (melancolico), mezzo termine, moccenigo (moc(c)enigo), morene (morena), moro, moroso, moscardino, motivo, napelo (napelo/nap(p)ello), nicolo (niccolo), nimfadoro, pagody (pagodi), Papalina, pavone, pistolese, plemmirulate (plemmirulata), politicone, polverine (polverino), pomada (pomada/pomata), primore, puttine (puttino), ripare (riparo), saltamartino, scalado (scalada), scrivano, sdrucciola, serenissimo, sotane (sottana), spiritato, squadrate (squadrato), squadrature (squadratura), stare (stara/staro), steccado (steccada/steccata), stilettato (stillettata), stuccature (stuccatura), stufata (stufato), stufe (stufa), travature (travatura), verzino, volpone.\n\n9The resulting corpus has yet to be cleaned because 45 loanwords attest final mute <e>s in English that modify the number of syllables compared to the corresponding Italian terms whose <e#>s are always pronounced. The determination of the stress pattern is then compromised in the perspective of a stress preservation analysis. These 45 English loanwords are found below:\n\n6 Surprisingly, the <e#> of Bolognese is mute in the OED but it appears that it can also be pronounce (...)\n\nariose (arioso), belvedere, Bolognese, capitanate (capitanato), Cassinese, Comacine (comasino), davyne (davina), ergonovine, facellite, Ferrarese, fuse (fuso), galipine (galipeina), Genovese, Ghibelline (Ghibellino), girasol(e) (girasole), granite (granito), gumfiate (gonfiato), hieratite, impassionate (impassionato), Italianate (italianato), marinate (marinato), matildite, Milanese, miniature (miniatura), nunciature (nunziatura), pastose (pastoso), perrierite, pilastrade (pilastrata), profile (proffilo), ptomaine (ptomaina), recitative (recitativo), rosasite, scalade (scalada), scarpine, scope (scopo), sellaite, simetite, sistine (sistina), soldanate (soldanato), taramellite, Ticinese, Torinese, tramontane (tramontana), travertine (travertino), trombone.\n\n10The OED online edition is under constant revision and its entries have not been fully updated yet: it appears that some Italian loanwords do not have any associated phonetic transcriptions. Stress comparison turns out to be impossible and these items have therefore not been retained. The following list includes these 16 cases:\n\n7 In a few cases, the mute final <e> criterion and the lack of phonetic transcription may be cumulative,</e> (...)\n\nbarcone, casal(e), con impeto, granito, latticino/latticinio, natrodavyne (natrodavyna), sonata da camera, sonata da chiesa, stretto maestrale, verde antico, viola pomposa, violetta marina, violoncello piccolo, vita nuova, inamorate (innamorato), Veronese.\n\nbrava, camata, cavo-rilievo, dimity, flautone, gigalira, improvisatrice, intrada, messa di voce, mezza voce, Mona Lisa, Monte di Pietà, negroni, numero uno, oboe d’amore, ottava rima, palmarosa, piano nobile, piano piano, sgraffiato, sgraffito, tarantato, tarentola, terza rima, Unione Siciliana, Verona.\n\n12Furthermore, seven Italian loanwords with -ino and -ina diminutive suffixes in English are not attested as such in Italian sources where only deriving forms are found:\n\nduettino (duetto), fantoccini (fantoccio), giallolino (giallo), palombino (palombo), pandurina (pandura), scherzino (scherzo), spaghettini (spaghetto/spaghetti).\n\n13Finally, syneresis is a frequent phonetic phenomenon occurring in Italian and the stressed syllables that undergo this process have to be carefully dealt with. Two cases are to be distinguished. The first one is only related to the two Italian dictionary sources into which this phonetic process leads to distinct stress representations. The Dizionario della Lingua Italiana does not include <i> and its palatalized /j/ realization within the stressed syllable whereas the Robert & Signorelli dictionary does.\n\nDizionario della Lingua Italiana: cappricci’oso, curi’oso, ruffi’ano\n\nRobert & Signorelli: cappric’cioso, cu’rioso, ruf’fiano\n\n14The inclusion of those items might lead to a misinterpretation of Italian stress patterns and then skew the results of the stress match investigation with English. Indeed, and this is the second case, the borrowing transfer may, in some very specific cases, trigger a re-syllabification process that deeply reshapes syllable structures of corresponding Italian loanwords in English and affects the determination of stress patterns. The loanword piano clearly illustrates this phenomenon because in English, <ia> is traditionally interpreted as a syllabically-dissociated sequence that then has to be considered as disyllabic. The expected stress pattern of piano in English is therefore /010/. However, the foreign origin of piano and the potential influence of Italian phonological principles over English create a stress variant in /10/ according to which <i> is palatalized and included in the representation of the stressed syllable. A similar phenomenon occurs with soave, whose <oa> sequence is disyllabic in Italian, hence, its /010/ stress pattern in both Italian dictionaries. However, the alternative phonetic realization of <o> as /w/ in English reshapes its syllable structure in which it is perceived as a monosyllabic sequence. The determination of the English stress pattern (/10/ or /100/?) raises insoluble problems. Those 42 cases of conflicting syllabic and stress representations are not integrated into the final corpus:\n\narioso, basso-relievo (bassorilievo), bersagliere, capriccioso, carabiniere, condottiere (condot(t)iero), conversazione, curioso, diabolo, duomo, forte-piano, furioso, grazioso, majolica (maiolica), mezza-majolica (mezzamaiolica), mezzo-rilievo (mezzorilievo), millefiore, minchiate, mysterioso (misterioso), Nebbiolo, paolo, passeggiata, pensiero, pensione, piano, quartiere, relievo (rilievo), religioso, ripieno, Riviera, ruffiano, scagliola, scuola, sestiere, Siciliana, soave, stagione, stiacciato, studiolo, suabe (soave), zabaglione (zabaione), viale.\n\n15The final corpus is composed of 309 Italian loanwords (see annex). Gender, singular/plural or spelling variations are found, but these differences are not relevant as far as stress assignment is concerned.\n\nItalian / English stress match investigation in dictionary sources\n\n2.2.1. Stress in Italian\n\n16In Italian, as well as in English, there is a lexical stress (noted /1/). This phonological similarity between both languages makes it possible to compare the stress patterns of loanwords in the source language and in the target language. Several studies concerning stress patterns in Italian have been carried out and the results appear to be equivalent. In Italian, words are mainly stressed on the penultimate syllable (80%). Stress on the antepenultimate syllable is also attested (16%) and the final stress pattern is not productive (only 4%) (Borrelli 2002; Thornton, Iacobini & Burani 1997). If we compare these results with those based on the stress patterns of the Italian items that constitute our corpus, the general tendency is confirmed. Indeed, out of 309 Italian loanwords:\n\n– 247 are stressed on the penultimate syllable (79.9%).\n\n– 57 are stressed on the antepenultimate syllable (18.4%).\n\n– 4 are stressed on the final syllable (1.4%).\n\n– 1 case of stress variation is attested (0.3%).\n\n2.2.2. Results\n\n18\n\nTable 1: Total stress matches between Italian and English\n\n19Only 4 loanwords out of 309 do not display any stress match between Italian and English:\n\n13 The number (3) means that the associated stress pattern is attested in the three English dictionary (...)\n\nauto’strada → ‘autoˌstrada (OED/LPD)\n\nbal’cone → ‘balcony (3)\n\n‘bucchero → buc’chero (OED)\n\n‘porfido → por’fido (OED)\n\n21Finally, nine partial stress matches are observed between Italian and English.\n\nTable 2: Partial stress matches between Italian and English\n\n22As can be observed in Table 2, stress variants are minor in English dictionary sources (9 cases out of 309 loanwords i.e. 2.9%). Two types of variation are attested in the above table. The variation may be either attested within the same dictionary data base (example: incognita in the OED), or, the variation can be found between dictionaries (example: Pietà, whose alternative stress pattern on the first syllable is attested in the LPD and the EPD but not recognized by the OED).\n\n23Furthermore, it is worth noting that dialect-dependent differences have no impact on the stress of Italian loanwords in English. The OED entries have not been fully updated yet and thus access is often only restricted to British phonetic transcriptions, however, stress variants which are linked to dialectal variation are very limited and generally not extended to the three dictionary sources. This means that the dialectal argument plays no part in the stressing of Italian loanwords whose stress patterns are only influenced by the reproduction of the phonological stress properties of Italian. This is a major difference with French loanwords whose stress patterns are greatly influenced by the varieties of English under scrutiny (see P. Fournier 2013 and 2016).\n\n2.2.3. Preliminary conclusions concerning dictionary data\n\n24This dictionary-based analysis of stress match between Italian words and their corresponding Italian loanwords in English demonstrates that the stress pattern of the source language (Italian) is almost always reproduced by the target language (English). The results, i.e. 95.8% total match added to 2.9% partial match, strongly support this argument. Only 1.3% of Italian loanwords are not stressed according to the Italian stress pattern in English and show assimilatory features. Italian loanwords are not stress-assimilated in English and the low rate of partial matches confirms that trend.\n\n25These results also highlight the reliability of the OED phonetic transcriptions which have often been criticized for a very long time in the specialized literature. Indeed, annex 1 shows that a high proportion of Italian loanwords are only attested in the OED. However, the stress conservation principle is also valid, as the two reference pronouncing dictionaries (i.e. the LPD and the EPD) show. The results of the first study (P. Fournier to appear) are thus confirmed.\n\n26The next part of the study compares those results, based on dictionary sources, with oral data. An experiment was conducted with seven English native speakers to determine the influence of the introduction of Italian loanwords on the way Italian loanwords are perceived and stressed in English. The majority of Italian loanwords in English are stressed on the penultimate syllable. The preservation of Italian stress patterns explains why the penultimate stress pattern is the most frequent one. However, the dictionary-based data has proved that words that are stressed on the antepenultimate syllable in Italian also reproduce the same stress pattern in English after the borrowing process. Nonetheless, it turns out that the massive introduction of Italian loanwords, which are stressed on the penultimate syllable, has had an impact on the way foreign words in general might be perceived and stressed by English speakers.\n\n3. English native speakers’ sensitivity to Italian word stress\n\n3.1. Description of the experiment\n\n27 Seven English native speakers (two male and five female speakers), aged from 22 to 35, were asked to read a list of items. Several varieties of English were represented (Irish, Scottish, British and American English). This hardly seems relevant, though, as the first part has clearly demonstrated that in English, the stress of Italian loanwords is not determined by the variety under consideration. Five speakers are lecturers in French universities and two of them are prospective EFL teachers. Several of them have advanced language skills abilities and can speak several languages such as French, Spanish, Arabic, German, Turkish or Hebrew, however, only three of them studied Italian at school, although only for one year, at high school or university.\n\n28The list of items they were asked to read was composed of 150 words, 50 of which were Italian words (nouns or adjectives). Twenty-six of those Italian items are stressed on the penultimate syllable, while the remaining 24 are stressed on the antepenultimate syllable. Several conditions were implemented in the corpus elaboration. First, the Italian words cannot be loanwords in English and they have to exhibit <VCV#> structures. Words with <e#> structures were not selected because the vocalic realisation or non-realisation might modify syllable structure and thus, the determination of the primary stress location. Moreover, their spellings had to be as far from any similar English word as possible. Lastly, suffixed Italian words (ending in -ino or -ina) were not selected because the morphological parameter, and in particular the suffixal one, is determining in stress assignment in Italian, and English speakers who have linguistic notions concerning Italian might be tempted to apply these stress rules. The goal of this experiment was to test how English speakers stress Italian words, when inserted in a list of English items. The preferential Italian stress patterns, as we have demonstrated in the first part, are /(-)10/ and /(-)100/. This is why the 50 Italian words have at least three syllables. English speakers were expected to stress Italian words on the penultimate or antepenultimate syllable. Would their stress realisations match with the Italian stress patterns as dictionary sources suggested? It was expected that the match rate would be connected with the informants’ command of the Italian language. Here is the list of the selected Italian words:\n\nItalian words in /(-)10/: sagrestano, pericoloso, naftalina, panchina, premurosa, pedina, intriso, vampata, riposo, morboso, grattacapo, gattino, lettino, lattuga, permalosa, pasticcino, velenoso, pendolino, raffinato, effettiva, pettinatura, scanalatura, portafortuna, scriminatura, spaventapasseri, qualcosa.\n\nItalian words in /(-)100/: solita, umido, gomito, prossimo, enfasi, ibrida, ettaro, valvola, ennesimo, gomitolo, edicola, pellicola, ostacolo, ossigeno, novantesimo, voltastomaco, quarantesima, lucertola, garofano, geroglifici, fascicolo, gambero, capitombolo, scampolo.\n\n29 The other items on the list are English words with different etymological backgrounds. They may be of Romance or Germanic origin and belong to several syntactic categories. Attested loanwords from different languages were also selected in order to ensure that English speakers would not only focus on Italian words that sounded strange to them. The 100 words that constituted the rest of the list are presented below:\n\ndefinition, majority, epidemiology, jealousy, laureate, metaphor, imprisonment,, ligature, observatory, logarithm, ironing, kingfisher, landholder, latecomer, helplessness, heaviness, livelihood, meadowland, overburden, wintergreen, dynamic, maintainable, heterogeneous, hysterical, juvenile, mandatory, lateral, maturative, lenticular, litigious, handwritten, threatening, meaningless, yellowish, weaponless, uppermost, turnipy, weedgrown, waterproof, tokenistic, indirectly, organically, humanistically, luminously, marginally, pejoratively, meditatively, pronouncedly, monstrously, nutritionally, knowledgeably, tellingly, prettily, heartbreakingly, healthily, girlishly, early, feelingly, wholly, guiltily, individuate, irradiate, obnubilate, licentiate, panegyrize, liquidate, manducate, masculinize, modify, nationalize, wallow, hearten, glisten, fumble, forbid, believe, understand, hurdle, listen, answer, kibbutznik, mandapam, mazurka, pastourelle, restaurant, resumé, gendarmerie, t’ai chi ch’uan, kimono, tokonoma, genipapo, guerilla, gemütlich, gegenschein, kindergarten, dreidel, cunjevoi, couscous, bungalow, smorgasbord.\n\n30 The speakers were then asked to read the whole list without any further information. The presence of loanwords of different origins which are attested in English along with other English words, and the random order the words were listed, could make the speakers to think that all these words were attested in English. Consequently, they systematically attributed stress patterns no matter the words they were presented with. Data recording was carried out by a single person but oral data analysis and the determination of stress patterns concerning Italian words were treated separately by three researchers. This analysis was first carried out separately and results were then confronted. When the three people could not come to an agreement concerning primary stress location, the majority (two over one) won, but, it only represents a dozen of cases because the determination of stressed syllables is generally made easy by the reading of isolated words. Finally, ten oral productions were rejected, because speakers mispronounced the words or pronounced them so slowly that the stressed syllable identification was made impossible.\n\n3.2. Results\n\n3.2.1. Global results\n\n31Each of the 7 speakers pronounced 50 words and only 10 productions - that is 340 tokens - could not be used.\n\nstress patterns\n\noccurrences\n\nrate\n\n/(-)10/\n\n280\n\n82,3 %\n\n/(-)100/\n\n57\n\n16,8 %\n\n/(-)1000/\n\n3\n\n0,9 %\n\nTable 3: Overall results concerning the stress patterns of Italian words\n\n3.2.2. Stress match analysis between oral data and Italian stress patterns\n\n33 If only Italian words that are stressed in /(-)10/ are taken into account, 26 words were pronounced by 7 speakers, and 4 items could not be used, which means 178 occurrences. Among the 24 Italian items that are stressed in /(-)100/, 6 productions could not be used, which means 162 occurrences. The following table examines the distinction between the stress patterns the English speakers realized alongside the stress match investigation criterion.\n\nItalian words in /(-)10/\n\nItalian words in /(-)100/\n\nstress patterns\n\noccurrences\n\nrate\n\noccurrences\n\nrate\n\n/(-)10/\n\n170\n\n95.5 %\n\n111\n\n68.5 %\n\n/(-)100/\n\n7\n\n3.9 %\n\n49\n\n30.2 %\n\n/(-)1000/\n\n1\n\n0.6 %\n\n2\n\n1.3 %\n\nTable 4: Match rate results between oral data and Italian stress patterns\n\n34Results show that Italian words which are stressed on the penultimate syllable are also mainly stressed on the penultimate one by English speakers (95.5%). Few cases of antepenultimate stressing are attested (3.9%). The results turn out to be different when only Italian words with an antepenultimate stress are taken into account because it appears that the /(-)10/ stress pattern is still the preferential one (68.5%) but the antepenultimate stress pattern is far more represented (30.2%) than concerning Italian words that are stressed in /(-)10/. This meaningful difference demonstrates that English speakers might be sensitive to the original stress patterns and, more generally, to the phonological properties of source languages (here Italian). Indeed, some speakers tend to reproduce the original stress patterns (either /(-)10/ or /(-)100/). However, those results cannot be fully interpreted if no clear-cut separations are drawn, based on the speakers’ command of Italian. As a matter of fact, this linguistic ability criterion is also a determining factor in the reproduction of corresponding Italian stress patterns. The next part re-interprets these results alongside this new parameter.\n\n3.2.3. Results based on speakers’ linguistic abilities in Italian\n\n35 Four English speakers out of seven have no linguistic notions concerning the Italian language, have never studied it nor been exposed to it. Each of them pronounced the 50 Italian words and 6 items - that is 194 tokens (101 concerning /(-)10/ items and 93 concerning /(-)100/ ones - could not be used.\n\nItalian words in /(-)10/\n\nItalian words in /(-)100/\n\nstress patterns\n\noccurrences\n\nrate\n\noccurrences\n\nrate\n\n/(-)10/\n\n95\n\n94 %\n\n73\n\n78.5 %\n\n/(-)100/\n\n5\n\n5 %\n\n19\n\n20.4 %\n\n/(-)1000/\n\n1\n\n1 %\n\n1\n\n1.1 %\n\nTable 5: Match rate results between linguistically naïve speakers’ productions and Italian stress patterns\n\n36 The majority of Italian words that are stressed in /(-)10/ are also stressed on the penultimate syllable by English speakers even though they do not have any linguistic abilities concerning the Italian language. These results are not surprising because it appears that most <VCV#> words of foreign origin in English are stressed that way. This point will be dealt with later. The difference is more meaningful concerning Italian words that are stressed in /(-)100/ because English speakers tend to stress the penultimate syllable (78.5%) all the same rather than the antepenultimate one (20.4%). If global results only related to those four linguistically naïve speakers are pooled together, it is worth noting that they strongly stress the penultimate syllable when faced with an Italian word no matter its stress pattern in Italian (86.6%) and that the antepenultimate stress is quite rare (12.4%). Only 20% of /(-)100/ Italian words are stressed the same way by English speakers. Even if /(-)10/ is the preferential stress pattern, those linguistically naïve speakers seem nevertheless to be slightly sensitive to the /(-)100/ Italian stress pattern because one word out of five is stressed according to the Italian stress pattern.\n\n37 If English speakers with linguistic notions in Italian are now considered, the results significantly change. These three speakers generated 146 exploitable tokens (with 77 concerning Italian words in /(-)10/ and 69 concerning Italian words in /(-)100/).\n\nItalian words in /(-)10/\n\nItalian words in /(-)100/\n\nstress patterns\n\noccurrences\n\nrate\n\noccurrences\n\nrate\n\n/(-)10/\n\n75\n\n97.4 %\n\n37\n\n53.6 %\n\n/(-)100/\n\n2\n\n2.6 %\n\n31\n\n44.9 %\n\n/(-)1000/\n\n0\n\n0 %\n\n1\n\n1.5 %\n\n38Table 6: Match rate results between initiated speakers’ productions\n\nand Italian stress patterns\n\n39 Concerning /(-)10/ Italian words, figures are roughly equivalent with a 97.4% match between Italian stress patterns and what English speakers actually produce. It appears that, whatever the level of linguistic requirements speakers may possess, they tend to stress Italian words on the penultimate syllable. However, a significant tendency emerges concerning the results with /(-)100/ Italian words. Indeed, initiated speakers better reproduce the antepenultimate Italian stress (44.9%) than speakers with no prior notions in Italian (20.4%). They are more familiar with the Italian stress system but may also be more sensitive to the reproduction of Italian phonological principles through the borrowing process.\n\n/(-)10/\n\n/(-)100/\n\n/(-)1000/\n\nglobal\n\n82,3 %\n\n16,8 %\n\n0,9 %\n\nnon-initiated speakers\n\n86,6 %\n\n12,4 %\n\n1 %\n\ninitiated speakers\n\n76,7 %\n\n22,6 %\n\n0,7 %\n\nTable 7: Overall results related to initiated and non-initiated speakers\n\n4. Discussion\n\n41 The study of the stress patterns of Italian loanwords in English pronouncing dictionaries clearly demonstrates that Italian loanwords massively reproduce corresponding Italian stress patterns whether primary stresses are located on the final, penultimate or antepenultimate syllable. Nevertheless, the results also confirm that the preferential stress pattern in Italian is /(-)10/ and, consequently, through the preservation of this Italian stress pattern, many penultimate stress patterns are attested in English. Thus, in <VCV#> structures, the English language adopts Italian lexical items, as well as their stress patterns.\n\n42 The oral test, experimented on native English speakers, has led to the following conclusion: English speakers massively stress Italian words on the penultimate syllable whatever the original Italian stress patterns. However, speakers with some knowledge of Italian reproduce more faithfully original Italian stress patterns and the observation of their stressing concerning the Italian items that are stressed in /(-)100/ confirms that the more they grow accustomed, the more they stress in accordance with Italian stress principles. Those conclusions are to be drawn with a measure of caution, because firstly, there were few recorded speakers, and secondly, it has been difficult to determine the degree of fluency of initiated speakers in Italian who might have been biased concerning the pronunciation patterns. Yet it is noteworthy that the more accustomed the speakers are to Italian, the more faithful they are to the Italian stress patterns. One should also keep in mind that those of the informants who were skilled in Italian had only been exposed to it at school and for a very brief period of time (up to one year). Generally speaking, it seems quite obvious that bilingual speakers had integrated Italian loanwords into their English lexicon. If this were not so, this close-to-perfect stress match would not have been possible and would not have been so well reflected by dictionaries. Before being attested in English dictionaries, these loanwords may firstly be used by a community of bilingual speakers hence their stress patterns would remain stable in English. Therefore, these bilingual speakers would not only integrate a new word into the English lexicon, but also its stress contour.\n\n43 This influx of Italian loanwords in English, adopted with their original stress characteristics, has had a major influence on the stressing of foreign words in general. Considering that most Italian words are stressed on the penultimate syllable, and that the stress preservation principle implies that Italian loanwords are consequently stressed in /(-)10/ in English as well, French phonologists postulated the existence of a pedagogical stress rule, called the “Italian rule”, that states that words ending by an alveolar consonant (except <l> and <r>) and followed by a pronounced vowel are stressed on the penultimate syllable (see J.-M. Fournier 2010 amongst others). This rule does not only apply to Italian loanwords because the segmental characteristics of it also account for words of other origins such as Spanish, Japanese or Arabic loanwords. However, this stress rule is labelled the “Italian rule” because the vast majority of words, whose stress patterns are accounted for by this rule, are derived from Italian. This stress rule is in fact reductive as it is limited to segmental considerations, but its labelling which makes reference to etymological considerations, paves the way for the role of etymology in the stressing of loanwords in English. Indeed, syllable weight has long been considered as the fundamental factor in the stressing of loanwords, but, it appears that etymology might be determining as Church (1985) put out:\n\n“It is clear (…) that the stress of Italian loans is not dependent on the weight of the penultimate syllable (…) I believe that speakers of English adopt what I like to call a pseudo-foreign accent. That is, when speakers want to communicate that a word is non-native, they modify certain parameters of the English stress rules in simple ways that produce bizarre “foreign sounding” outputs”.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\n46 The study of the stress patterns of Italian loanwords in English dictionary sources shows a stress preservation principle between Italian and English. The possible introduction of Italian loanwords in English by bilingual speakers might have influenced the stressing of loanwords in general because the /(-)10/ stress pattern, massively imported from Italian, seems to be the preferential one used by native speakers to stress foreign words no matter what their origin may be (except French). Further oral investigations are needed concerning the stressing of foreign words other than Italian to prove it."
