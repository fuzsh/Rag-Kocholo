        "text": "From Harris to an Unsettled World\n\nThis plus a rather strange decision, case dismissed, by the relatively untried prosecutor in the case against Donald Trump for mishandling a large number of highly confidential files from the time that he was in the White House, 2017-2021. It puts him in a strong position to win the Presidential election come November.\n\nEven other prosecutors are querying the decision which makes it seem that something is wrong with the US justice system, which would seem subject to political aims. Come what may, the decision by the prosecutor would leave Trump free to contest the election and, once elected, the system is such that he can pardon himself from the several other cases outstanding against him. ‘’No one is above the law’’ – except the President! Really?\n\nThe last period has not been good for President Joe Biden, glaringly seen as stumbling when walking or speaking. He has been diagnosed with a mild form of covid, but there is no denying there is a groundswell of movement that is asking him to step aside. His powers are obviously waning, and it is doubtful if he could withstand another 4 years in the White House.\n\nThe US domestic economy has been sound during the Biden years, he has embraced the forces of climate change, somewhat controversial in the US, but his foreign policy has been decidedly patchy. Afghanistan, the Ukraine war, and more recently the Israel- Palestine conflict.\n\nAt last, a few days ago Biden realised the groundswell of Democratic opinion against his standing again,and resigned effective the end of his allotted term in January 2025. He immediately endorsed his Vice-President, Kamala Harris. The Democratic party quickly offered their support and the coffers were filled with $81 million for her campaign.\n\nTrump has chosen J D Vance, Senator from Ohio, as his Vice-Presidential running mate. He represents the working- class Americans, once a strong opponent of Trump, now an ally. His credentials so far make him an America-first candidate which does not auger well for the complex world which faces the nations normally allying with the US. The next few months will tell.\n\nThe Democratic party have finally obtained a sound and honourable candidate, free from convictions for serious misdemeanours, and showing leadership qualities. Have they left adequate time for Harris to show her potential, and the electorate, particularly the undecided, to gather round the Democrats?\n\nFrom Harris to an Unsettled World\n\nMeanwhile, the ongoing places of conflict, the Gaza strip and Ukraine, bubble along. PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s Israeli troops are carrying on as ‘normal’ in Gaza, now that the US is occupied with domestic affairs, bombing school targets ostensibly while seeking one Hamas leader and with no thought towards collateral deaths of innocent Palestinian women and children sheltering in a place designated as a refuge.\n\nThe UN International Court of Justice have called out these heart-rending crimes and the illegal Israeli land grab in the West Bank. But until much stronger measures are put in place, like drastically reducing the supply of arms to Israel, particularly by the US, imprisoning Netanyahu as promoter of these wrongdoings, then forcing Israel to contribute payment for some of the rebuilding of Gaza as part of the 2-state solution, an idea long in the planning, Gaza will continue to be bombed and innocent women and children killed. It is not known, at this stage, where the Republicans stand on the Gaza conflict – non-interference? Trump was a robust Israeli supporter in his previous stint, but the conditions are different now.\n\nThe Republicans or more accurately Trump has said he would seek an end to the war in Ukraine. He reckons he has a good rapport with Vladimir Putin. Irrespective of this, Putin is unlikely to give up much or any of the land he has gained, albeit illegally, nor is Volodymyr Zelenskyy likely to cede territory.\n\nSomehow one sees a trade off since the war cannot go on for ever, a price for ceding to Russia a portion of land – the land of East Ukraine is rich in wheat, and for Ukraine, war reparations, immediate membership of NATO, with US support guaranteed plus rearming Ukraine. In addition, a joint committee of high-level empathetic Ukrainians and Russians is formed to work together for the years to come with the remit to produce a peaceful and profitable border land, say called Ukrussaine! And become a model for a bigger potentially looming threat, climate change.\n\nGeorge Friedman’s (2009) book considered the world political development over this century – ‘’The next 100 years’’. He thought that, looking forward, the US would dominate world affairs for most of the century, and only in the last quarter would other players become strong enough to exhibit a challenge.\n\nThat forecast did not see a situation of the US appearing so divided already that people are worried that the scenario does not descend towards civil unrest, two seriously opposed factions. We Europeans and other nations are watching carefully the drama unfold, as does Putin the East and other members of the BRICS bloc. Where do we go after that?\n\nDr J Scott Younger, International Chancellor of the President University in\n\nIndonesia,Honorary Senior Research Fellow of the\n\nGlasgow University and member of IFIMES Advisory Board\n\nIFIMES – International Institute for Middle East and Balkan Studies, based in Ljubljana, Slovenia, has Special Consultative status at ECOSOC/UN since 2018 and is the publisher of the international scientific journal “European Perspectives”."
