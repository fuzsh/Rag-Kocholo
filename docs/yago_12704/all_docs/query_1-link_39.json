        "text": "Hi Jettatore.\n\nJust to let you know, recently Ive created a sort of camera Zscript. Very simple to use. You rotate the model to one view from where you wish to start panning/ rotating the camera and press on a ‘Set Camera 1’ button. Then you rotate to change the view to the destination position of the camera and press “Set Camera 2” and then you click a “Apply Camera” button which pans/ rotates the camera from the start view to the final while taking snapshots into the movie, and you can also adjust some settings. If that’s what you want I can upload the zscript it here, but first I would need to clean up the code and interface since this is all very recent and is integrated with the animation Zscript I was attempting. Just let me know.\n\nThis is something i was looking for too.\n\nCan you post the camera Zscript, Darukin?\n\nThanx in advance.\n\nThis would be quite handy…the ability to do somewhat more\n\nsophisticated ‘demo’ reel revolves and pans using Zbrush’s\n\nbuilt in goodies, then just edit in AE or Vegas or summin.\n\nThe addition of a plug like this would definitely add value for\n\nmany, I’d imagine (me too, me too!).\n\nHope to see it attempted.\n\ncheers.\n\nWailingMonkey\n\nHi Drive2Moon\n\nSure thing I shall post the Zscript but when it’s fully ready hopefully since it’s still sort of in prototype stage. Unfortunately there is one problem with it so far , which if fixed should mean it’s complete.\n\nThe pan and zoom functions of the camera work perfectly but the rotate has problems, which I think is a problem with Zbrush rather than the Zscript logic. You see, whenever the tool rotates more than 90 degrees along Y axis left or right the tool suddenly flips upside-down for some reason and continues to rotate the other 180 degrees upside down. So rotation works well for first 180 degrees only so far. I’ll try to work it out though and will hopefully post the script here as soon as it’s fixed / ready.\n\nIt’s called\n\nGimbal lock and is a feature of using Euler angles in the rotation algorithm. I’ve not found a reliable solution for interpolated rotations in ZBrush.\n\nThe simplest way of coping with it is to temporarily change the rotation of the entire object using the Deformation> Rotate slider so that rotation is about the Z axis instead and the problem then won’t appear. Granted this isn’t a particularly attractive solution (especially with subtools) but it is generally the most practical.\n\nShould you find some other solution please post the code. Every zscripter will worship you as a god thereafter.\n\nThis sounds awsome Darukin. Even with the rotation limitation you’ve mentioned it sounds to be perfect for my needs. If you could post it in a beta form, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI haven’t tested it very much yet but it looks like the rotation option in the Movie script has solved it, no?\n\nMyself, I’ve often used your solution of temporarily reorienting the object so the Y axis becomes Z, then executing a rotation around Z, and finally rotating the object back so Z axis is again Y. (subtools do complicate that. )\n\nSven\n\nNo Problem\n\nI have the Zscript here now. Let’s just say say it’s in beta form right now.\n\nAbout the subtool problem, all I needed was to place an extra button to prepare the entire tool for the camera, to automate the deformation rotation of the entire tool for all subtools in one click. Though depending on the tool’s deformation this button may need to be clicked more than once though I doubt.\n\nAnyways, here it is, and with the extra button added the limitation I mentioned should be gone.\n\nOh and this of course is thanks to Marcus Civis, thanks very much for that suggestion it sort of solved the problem even though maybe not the most attractive solution.\n\nZCamera Quick Instructions:\n\n1: Load the Zscript\n\n2: Load Your tool. With tool selected, press on the: Prepare Tool For Camera Button. You may need to press this button more than once until you get the right rotation deformation so that the camera will rotate correctly so dont panic if you get very strange camera rotations around tool’s y-axis, in that case click the button again till it’s right, but usually should be pressed ONLY ONCE if modeled normally.\n\nChange view of the tool and press on the Set Camera Start button to specify where camera shall start panning / rotating from i.e. the start camera.\n\nChange view of the tool and press on the Set Camera End button to specify where camera shall stop panning / rotating, i.e. the destination camera.\n\nMake sure to apply appropriate settings from Movie Palette within ZBrush.\n\n6: Scroll the Frames Slider appropriately to specify the number of frames to capture, which corresponds to the relative speed of the camera movement\n\n7: Press Preview Camera button, only after the start and end cameras have been specified, to preview the camera movement.\n\n8: Press Render Camera button, again only after the start and end cameras have been specified, to render the scene as the camera is applied.\n\nFinally, Enjoy, I hope it’s helpful.\n\nDude, thank you so much. I’m going to be playing with this all day tommarow. Good looking out -Derek\n\nHey Darukin,\n\nA lot of vanks from me! The plugin is just beauuuuuuuuuuuuutiful!\n\nExactly for my needs!\n\nIt worked also with a separate subtool!\n\nNow I start dreaming about smth like letting them subtools travel separate routes to later get together into one piece of the mesh, then go apart again…\n\nThere is no end to the plans…\n\nPlease go on working over this gem!\n\nAnatom\n\nThank you so much, Darukin.\n\nThe script is working great!\n\nIt would be really nice if the script offers multiple camera destinations. Just a suggestion.\n\nHi all, and you’re welcome!\n\nI’m glad you guys liked it, first of all.\n\nSecondly, indeed I said I would consider this a beta so maybe for the final I could add multiple cameras and extend the functionality in more than one way, like you suggested drive2moon.\n\nAnd Anatom, I’m not sure exactly what you meant with subtools taking own routes and merging, if you could be clearer\n\nFinally, maybe you guys can show me some of the nice movies you make with this within Zbrush, I would be interested in seing some results.\n\nThis is going to be one of my favorite scripts once finished. As its still beta heres my bug report.\n\nIf I try to back up the turntables one after the other, say for example one normal turn follwed by a couple fo turn and moves and zoom ins, it seems to work fine and even previews fine on export. However on play back the turntable is fine for the ‘normal one’ but the framerate apears of for the scripted ones.\n\nThats to say it goes very slow and jerky. I can upload an example if it helps with the bug. Nice work so far on this one, lots of fun to play with.\n\nWayne…\n\nHi Darth Wayne.\n\nDo you mean that the scene plays fine for the Preview Camera, but when you press Render Camera and then play the movie from the movie palette it goes very slow and jerky as a movie? Because if that’s what you mean then it’s not really a bug but all it means is that you must adjust certain settings in the movie palette, like I also stated in the instructions. The default Snap shot time is one second in the movie palette modifiers section, i.e. 1 second per frame which is very slow. What you can do is change that to something like 0.01 and then the rendered movie version will be very fast and fluid, even if the preview version may run slow with very high poly counts.\n\nIf that’s not what you meant then i’m not exactly sure what the problem is exactly in which case maybe you can post the example you’re talking about.\n\nIn the meantime Im open to all suggestions / features for a final version of the script.\n\nThanks that was it exactly, so looks like it was a case of RTFM by myself.\n\nSome sort of constrain to certain axis on rotates would be nice addition. Also it seems to knock the center pivot off on the model I was using if I want to do a normal turntable afterwards.\n\nI think I’ll go and have another play with it lol.\n\nWayne…\n\nLol, again there’s a solution to the turntable problem.\n\nThe problem happens due to the preparation of the model which occurs when you press the Prepare Tool For Camera button so that camera can work properly. Essentially it flips the tool completely 90 degrees along x axis so that tool’s y-axis becomes z-axis or something like that.\n\nBecause of this, you must change the axis along which turntable rotates model from Y axis to Z axis which you can select / specify from within Movie: Modifiers palette as well. There are many options there which you should check out and adjust to optimize it according to your needs.\n\nYea, sure, I guess I’ll apply that too.\n\nJust wanted to say thank you for providing this very handy script…\n\nso ‘Thanks!’ (2mb)\n\n(nuthin special…just my first test with it)\n\nNow a key-framer with minimal editing and we’re off to the races! :lol:\n\nMuch appreciated, Darukin.\n\nKind regards,\n\nWailingMonkey\n\nLol, thanks that was nice WailingMonkey. Or shall I say you’re welcome\n\nAs for the keyframer you suggested, well that sounds like a great idea. I’ll look into it definitely, especially for multiple cameras etc."
