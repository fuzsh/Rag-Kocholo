        "text": "Palacios Law\n\nAlfredo Palacios was the first socialist in the Argentine Congress who brought light to different social injustices involving sexual exploitation. He created the Palacios Law, passed in 1913, which says that “The person who in any way promotes or facilitates the prostitution or corruption of minors to satisfy the lust of others, even if mediated by the consent of the victim, will be punished: With 3 to 6 years of prison if the victim is over 18 years old. 6 to 10 years if the victim is over 12 and under 18, and up to 15 years in prison if the victim is under 12 years old”. At the end of the play, Renata threatens Senora Fernandez and tells her she will get 3 to 5 years in prison.\n\nEconomics of Prostitution\n\nIn 1919 Buenos Aires prostitution was a way for lower class girls such as the three sisters to make enough money to live a middle class lifestyle and purchase many material goods even though they were not viewed as socially or morally higher class citizens. Although their lifestyles and fashion may show that they are higher class, because other people in society know they are prostitutes their reputation is tainted and they do not move up socially or morally in society. Economically these sisters were flourishing and prostitution was a successful way for these women to obtain higher wages.\n\n“Lorenzo dreaming about Sr. de Fernandez helping them out. What a drag it is to be poor! With a salary of 400 pesos per month, you girls could have with a clothing boutique in the center of the city, we could go to the theater, drive in cars, I could smoke, go to the races, (he is lounging) “\n\n400 pesos per month x 12 months = 4800 pesos per year\n\n4800 pesos per year = $2385 USD per year\n\n$2,385 in 1919 (inflation) → $32,636 yearly income USD according to Lorenzo’s dreaming.\n\nAccording to Donna Guy’s book Sex and Danger in Buenos Aires “a successful woman might have an average of 300 customers a week, each of whom paid 5 pesos” “half of which she would turn over to her pimp”\n\n5 pesos’ x 300 customers = 1500 pesos a week\n\n1500 pesos a week x 4 weeks = 6000 pesos a month\n\n6000 pesos a month x 12 months = 72,000 pesos\n\n72,000 pesos = $3528\n\n$3,538 in 1919 → $48,414. in 2014 (Inflation)\n\n$48,414 divided by 2 (pimp gets half) = $24,207 income yearly for successful prostitute with 300 weekly customers. Since 300 customers a week seems un realistic I divided the figure $24,207 in half to resemble 150 customers a week for a successful woman so the realistic wage based on Donna Guy’s “Sex and Danger in Buenos Aires” would be $12,103 a year.\n\n“This year, twenty-nine authors made over 5,000 pesos apiece for their plays. At the top of this group, was Luis Bayón Herrera (b. Spain, 1889-1951) with 36, 981 pesos, followed by Alberto Novion (b. France, 1881-1937) with 28, 608, and Julio Escobar (b. Buenos Aires 1892-1957) in third place with 28,547. ” Compared to the wages of successful playwrights in 1919 Buenos Aires from Dr. McCleary’s Life is a Cabaret, a succesful prostitute could be making anywhere from 4,800 pesos a year to 18,000 pesos a year.\n\nBuenos Aires view on Prostitution\n\nBuenos Aires was considered to be a city of sin due to the abundance number of prostitution in the area . Sin not just meaning commercial sex, but to a wide range of non-normative sexual practices. It is mentioned in “Global Modernity and Sexual Science: THE CASE OF MALE HOMOSEXUALITY AND FEMALE PROSTITUTION, 1850–1950.” written by Pablo Ben states that “Though this was an area of sin, it was not necessarily seen as judgmental and prostitution was almost seen as a normality for women living in Buenos Aires at the time.” They began to embrace the fact that “sin” was unavoidable. Migrants moving to the city were shocked to see these living conditions and ways, and at first did not condone the behavior of commercial sex, but over time some of them too participated in these activities. An article made a statement that in today’s society “Although prostitution is illegal in Buenos Aires, the law is rarely enforced and women make more money in the sex industry than in any other line of work”.\n\nRole of women in the workforce\n\nThe beginning of the 20th century came with a changing wind that would give women a fighting chance to change their role in the world and workforce. Specifically to south america, middle class jobs for women mimicked that of what they did for household chores. Many were seamstresses, maids, cooks and teachers. There was expansion to sales jobs in department stores and secretaries. One thing that all these women had in common in the workforce is that their pay was less than what their male counterparts received across the board. In factories in Buenos Aires, men could expect 2.80 to 7 pesos a day while women only 2 to 4 for the exact same job. There was little chance for low-income families to escape the situation they were in and it only became harder with the rise in the cost of living during the 1910’s.\n\nEconomic deterioration between 1913 and 1919 was a factor in the quality of wages that women received as well. It is no surprise that other options, such as prostitution and illegal activities seemed more favorable to struggling people, such as seen in our play. “The Pet of the Neighborhood” is a perfect example of women in the work force as all three sisters have different jobs that are believable for a middle class woman of the time to hold. The wages that the girls receive are only adequate to keep the families financially stable when all three are of their incomes are pooled together, which tells the audience that there pay is not enough for the cost of living."
