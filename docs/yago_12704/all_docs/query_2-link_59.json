The exciting evening event will include music, refreshments, live-woodblock printing, and available prints for sale by Stephany Sanchez.\n\nBiography\n\nStephany Sanchez is a Oaxacan- American artist from San Jose, California, currently residing in San Francisco. Through her work, she addresses political views and pays homage to her culture using Oaxacan folk art as an influence. Stephany enjoys working with a variety of mediums, printmaking being her current focus. She is currently working towards her Studio Practice degree at San Francisco State University with an emphasis in printmaking.\n\nGuerrera: An Exchange with Stephanie Sanchez\n\nTANA: Can you share a bit about your background?\n\nStephany Sanchez: My father was born in Oaxaca and my mother was born in Guerrero but raised in Oaxaca. My brothers and I were born in the United States but have traveled to Oaxaca since we were less than a year old. We spent much of our childhood in Oaxaca, completing one year of schooling and taking yearly summer trips to ensure we could read and write in Spanish. During that time we would run around with my primos in my father’s small pueblo. Our family would take us out to visit places that they felt were important for us to appreciate. These trips taught us a lot about our ancestry and culture of Oaxaca.\n\nTANA: What are some of your sources of inspiration?\n\nStephany Sanchez: Much of my inspiration stems from Oaxacan folk art, artesanías, and archeological sites. Apart from these, I find much inspiration in Mexican history. Moreover, I really enjoy studying the Mexican Revolution. I find it helpful to read into labor movements of the time and political topics still relevant today. I find myself seeking information about how these movements influence Mexican art, specifically printmaking.\n\nTANA: Who are your biggest influences?\n\nStephany Sanchez: My art is highly influenced by 19th-century, Mexican photographers. I can alleviate any art block by looking at the photographs of artists Lola Alvares Bravo, Graciela Iturbide, Nacho Lopez, and Victor Casasola. I am also influenced by artists like Saturnino Herran, Jose Clemente Orozco, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, and Francisco Goita. Lastly, family photographs sent from relatives in Oaxaca highly influence my work. Family portraits and candids, shared through our Facebook group chat, often display my family in their everyday pueblo life or enjoying cultural festivities.\n\nTANA: What does your work aim to say?\n\nStephany Sanchez: My work is intended to create representation for Oaxacan women and anyone else that can connect to my art. I seek to create relatable content for people like me. Having come from Oaxacan ancestry, I never felt represented in media or art. I want my work to serve as a platform for me to express my experience and stance on our current political climate as a woman of color.\n\nRicardo Flores Magon Woodcut print, 18” x 24”, 2018\n\nMuerteada, Woodblock Print, 32″x28″, 2018\n\nRiot Woodblock print, 22” x 30”, 2017\n\n“Minds, Bodies, and Souls” is an end of the year exhibition showcasing TANA intern posters with students from the silkscreen printing program in the Chicana/o Studies Department at UC Davis. Their exciting work represents various styles, techniques, and innovative approaches explored through the silkscreen process.\n\nTANA workshop participants will additionally have posters on display and for sale. The Open House will offers a unique opportunity to connect with the artists and gain an understanding of their process, artistic point of view, and why the poster serves as a vehicle for change and continues to make a difference!\n\nOpening:\n\nFriday, June 7 5-7pm\n\nDates:\n\nThrough September 13, 2019\n\nEvent Details:\n\n*Workshop participant,\n\nIntern, & Chi Silkscreen artist work on display\n\n*Live DJ\n\n*Taco Truck Y Elotera\n\n*Refreshments\n\nLocation:\n\nTaller Arte del Nuevo Amanecer\n\n1224 Lemen Ave. Woodland, CA\n\n(530) 402-1065\n\nArtists:\n\nJose Quintero\n\nMarina Contreras\n\nWendy Hernandez\n\nGabriel Mata\n\nSheila Moreno\n\nJose De Jesus Quintero: Jose De Jesus Quintero born and raised in Woodland, CA. He is graduating from UC Davis with a double major in Chicanx Studies and Art Studio. Jose went to Woodland Community College where he was first introduced to TANA in 2015. Starting Fall of 2017 he was accepted to UC Davis and began his internship at TANA. Creating art, particularly with and for a cause took off for him. As the process of silkscreen printmaking became second nature, his sensibility of making art for others became a responsibility. His posters are focused on personal experience with limitations, distance, and self-care. Hoping that his imagery may inspire the community and others to tackle issues that are close to home. While serving as an intern, Jose realized the community of Woodland needs spaces like TANA; an outlet and hub for activists, as well as a space for freedom of expression.\n\nMarina Contreras: Marina Contreras grew up in a small border town, Calexico, CA. and its sister city, Mexicali, BC, Mexico. Now a second year studying Clinical Nutrition and Chicanx Studies at UC Davis. She originally began her artistic work through acrylic paintings on canvas, and later developed the process of screen printing where she is now focused on creating posters that express issues she sees in her community. She creates thoughtful images about current issues with the expressed intention of generating hope in each topic and spark conversations that move toward a solution.\n\nGabriel Mata: Gabriel Mata (pronouns:they/she/he) grew up in the San Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles, CA. Graduating with a B.A. in Chicana/o Studies from UC Davis they hope to work within community spaces to address the pervasive cissexism and heterosexism within Latinidad. Throughout their time at Davis, they witnessed cissexism and heterosexism perpetuated by professors, students, organizations, and the Chicana/o department. Therefore they seek to highlight issues created through colonialist ideologies within the Chicanx and Latinx community. Through their position as the Gran Tardeada coordinator, they choose to center queer and trans identities for the 50th anniversary and created the “Queer and Trans Latinidad” gallery in commemoration of queer and trans labor towards a better environment for the Latinx community at UC Davis. Their art is centered around their experiences of having both queer and trans identities and navigating ethnic spaces designated for Latinidad. Their hope is to create pieces that spark dialogue that goes beyond the university and back to the communities the students originate from.\n\nSheila Moreno: Sheila Moreno (pronouns: they/them) grew up in K-Town Los Angeles, CA. They are now a third year at UC Davis, double majoring in Art Studio and Chicanx Studies. In high school, Sheila began their artistic work with drawing, and acrylic painting. Later in college, they were introduced to three forms of printing; silkscreen, woodblock, and intaglio. Through these mediums, their work centers around the cultural aspects and social issues that are part of their upbringing and are seen in their community today. They also work from personal experience.Given the skills to work with almost any medium (painting, drawing, printing), they have put their responsibility in creating a change in different forms of art. Sheila’s goal is to continue working with their community and creating art that their community wants to see and can connect with. To them, there is no better way of learning then through the beauty of art.\n\nWendy Hernandez: Wendy Hernandez is a fourth year Animal Science and Chicanx Studies double major from UC Davis. She is from South Central Los Angeles, California. Wendy was introduced to silkscreen printing through the Chicanx Studies department during the Summer of 2018. Starting Fall of 2018, she began her internship at TANA (Taller Arte del Nuevo Amanecer). Wendy’s work focuses on sharing the narratives of the working class population of Los Angeles. The collection of stories from her family and community have allowed her to advocate for a better immigration reform, among other issues which affect a broader population."
