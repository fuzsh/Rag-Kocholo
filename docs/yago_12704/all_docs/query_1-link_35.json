What’s you’re technique? Stencils or Masks? Either one, how do you do it?\n\nGlad you think it is cool.\n\nTo create this I did not use stencils or masks.\n\nI used Adobe Illustrator combined with Photoshop to create alphas. I used screen shots of my model to help draw my alphas to the right scale and orientation. This way they fit perfectly for this “Robot Part”.\n\nI found Adobe Illustrator really helpful in creating custom\n\nalphas. I also like using its gradients.\n\nI made small parts such as screw heads in Max or ZBrush. These were eventually to projected onto the model using projection master.\n\nVery cool, I can’t wait to see it textured.\n\nOk, so once you have you’re alpha’s do you use them as a displacement or do you use the inflate function or what? Thanks.\n\n…friend!\n\nJettatore- I will try to prepare something that explains how I did it, I use the alphas for displacement by using projection master.\n\ncmurray- I’m just leaving this as a sculpt for now, but a textured version would be interesting. Maybe I’ll post more\n\nparts of the robot sometime.\n\nFrenchy Pilou- it does look kind of starwars like.\n\nHopefully when Zbrush 3 comes out I will beable to cut this Robot into more peices and assemble him in ZBrush\n\nwith more crisp detail. Maybe even to the billion polygonal level."
