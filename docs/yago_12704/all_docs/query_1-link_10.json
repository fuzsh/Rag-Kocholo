        "text": "HAND-ME-DOWN DREAMS By Carol Antoinette Peacock. 167 pp. New York: Schocken Books. Cloth, $12.95. Paper, $8.95.\n\nMY mother's just a little kid at heart. She starts drinking sometimes, and then she gets just like a little kid. I hafta treat her like a baby. So I hafta say, 'It's okay. Don't cry, honey.' ''\n\nThe speaker is 16-year-old Joyce, but it might be any of thousands of adolescent girls in a similar predicament. They populate the welfare rolls and the truant list, and they are likely to be counted among the million adolescents who become pregnant each year. We know them in the abstract as statistics, but we can hardly imagine the emotional chaos of their lives.\n\nVery likely these teen-agers were born to teen-aged mothers; children who had not completed their childhood produced children whom they could not mother. The scramble for mere survival undid these young women. Poor, ill-educated, knowing little of security and unable to provide it, they become dependent on their daughters. These children, never adequately mothered, are caught in the cycle of anger, guilt and need. Delinquency is the daughters' adolescent assertion of independence; delinquency almost assures that the daughters will never break the destructive pattern or realize their mothers' tired dreams of a better life.\n\n''Hand-Me-Down Dreams'' is Carol Peacock's account of four adolescent girls who seemed headed for reform school when she met them in 1972. Miss Peacock, a young social worker, believed that group and individual therapy for both the girls and their mothers could interrupt the destructive cycle. The odds against the girls were formidable: As a group, they had experienced almost every violation and humiliation possible for children of their age. Truculent or withdrawn, they feared the intimacy they so desperately needed. There was no safe nurturing place in their lives.\n\nMiss Peacock and her streetwise co-worker drew the four girls into group activities that enabled them to reclaim the childhoods they had never had. Dinner at a Chinese restaurant, horseback riding, going to a rock concert were exercises in delight as well as in abiding by group rules. Self-respect began to replace guilt, dependence was gradually transformed into choice.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
