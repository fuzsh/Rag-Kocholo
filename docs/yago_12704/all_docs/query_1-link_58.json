Here is the brief about them.\n\n1) Turkey\n\nThe evil eye charm has been deeply rooted in Turkish culture since ancient history. It has a deep symbolic significance in the entire culture. In Turkey, the evil eye amulet or Nazar is made from handmade glass consisting of concentric circular patterns. There is a white, yellow, light blue, and black teardrop shape in these blue concentric circles.\n\nIn Turkey, people believe that everything that deserves high praise is at the risk of an evil eye curse. And thus, to protect their houses, cars, belongings and even individuals, they use these evil eye amulets or Nazars. They hang these Nazars in homes, offices, cars, children's clothing or wear them as jewellery.\n\n2) Greece\n\nThe evil eye charm is considered as an \"Apotropaic\" visual device to ward off the hostile glance. The symbol was first witnessed in 6th BC on Greek drinking vessels. The Greeks believed that there are some ways to ward off the evil eye curse by performing some processes like:\n\nXematiasma: In this process, the healer silently recites the powerful secret prayer of their elder grandparents (usually of the opposite gender) on the victim. It is believed that this prayer must be recited under specific conditions. Otherwise, the healer would lose their ability to cast off the evil eye.\n\nOil Drop Test: In this test, the healer puts one drop of olive oil in holy water. As oil is denser than water, it must float in the usual conditions. But in the case of an evil eye, it sinks, confirming the affliction.\n\nSimilarly, there is another drop test in which two drops of oil are placed in a glass of water. If both remain separated, there is no evil eye curse. But if they merge, then the curse is there.\n\nClove Test: In this test, the healer pierces a few cloves together in a pin and crosses over the afflicted. After crossing, the cloves are burned with a lighter. If the cloves burn quietly, then there is no evil eye. But if it explodes with noise, then the person is cursed. The cloves must be extinguished in water and later buried in the garden along with the pins to remove this curse.\n\nGreeks used to believe in the Evil eye curse and refer to it as devil and envy glare. They believed that demonic forces influence people to cast an evil eye on others intentionally or unintentionally. To ward off these bad intentions, they remain humble and often spit when praising someone/something.\n\n3) Israel / Jews - Middle East\n\nThe Bedouin folk culture in the Middle East believes that Evil Eye is the most dangerous force to destroy anyone's life in untold ways. They fear the misfortune and harm it can cause due to envy. The standard Arabic name for Evil Eye is \"ayn\", and there are two types:\n\nHumankind - known as Insiya\n\nThe Jinns - known as Jinsiya\n\nThey believe that the evil eye can cause mental, sexual and physical impairment to all ages and genders. To protect from the evil eye, they use Amulets, Charms, Spells, Sacrifices, Incantations, Vows and so on.\n\n4) Islamic Countries\n\nThe Islamic people believe that any individual has the power to cast an evil eye on someone/something out of envy or bad intentions to cause misfortune and harm. That is why they believe that If a compliment is made, the person should reply with \"TabarakAllah\" (\"Blessings of God\") or \"Masha'Allah\" (\"God has willed it\") to ward off the evil eye.\n\nApart from it, there are some other words like Sura Ikhlas, Sura Al-Falaq and Sura Al-Nas. Reciting these words from the Quran, three times after Fajr and Maghrib, also offers protection against evil intentions or glare.\n\n5) India\n\nAccording to the religions and regions, India has different names and protection methods to guard off the Evil Eye. In North regions like UP, Punjab, Haryana, etc., the evil eye is known as \"Nazar\" or \"Buri Nazar\". People use slogans, charms, bracelets or other objects like Nazar Bhattu to keep the evil eye away.\n\nIn India, people believe that newborn babies and infants are more prone to Evil Eye. Thus they usually put Kajal or Kaala Teeka to them to keep the evil glares away. Some people often preserve the umbilical cord of a newborn baby and cast it into black thread or metal. Babies can wear this as a bracelet or pendant to banish harmful energies.\n\nIn southern regions, the Evil eye is commonly known as \"Disti\" or \"Drusti\". To eliminate it, people use several items like rock salt, red chillies, lemons coated with kumkuma, white pumpkins, oiled cloth, etc. They rotate any of these items over the victim and burn or dump it to keep the evil spirits away.\n\n6) Italy\n\nAs per the ancient beliefs, The Wielder of the Evil Eye is known as Jettatore, having a striking facial appearance and high arching brows with an evil glare. He had a reputation for possessing dark powers and magic to harm successful people.\n\nSo, people in Italy use a twisted-horn shaped amulet called Cornicello (little horn) to keep the Evil Eye away. They are usually carved out of gold or silver or out of red coral.

Then this egg is broken into a glass of water and placed under the bed of the patient. If the egg looks like the cooked one in the morning, the curse has been eliminated.\n\nSometimes the raw egg turns into a cooked one, which confirms the presence of an evil eye. When raw eggs transform into cooked ones, Mal de Ojo is transferred immediately into the egg, and the patient feels better.\n\n8) Assyria\n\nAssyrians believe strongly in the Evil Eye curse.
