        "text": "Apart from the vague suggestions I gave in the comments, perhaps the nearest to an actual answer is here. The digital version of Zingarelli dictionary allows some quite refined searches. It is mostly a vocabulary of contemporary use, not a historical one, so one of the requisites is satisfied by default.\n\nBy searching the the present (2018) edition for lemmas including a “j” (just lemmas, not inflexed forms) and asking for the century of first occurrence to be at most the 17th century, we get very little, and probably nothing that qualifies:\n\nbijou\n\ndagli (because of Roman variant “daje”)\n\nfideiussione (because of the variant form “fidejussione”; the same for “fideiussore”)\n\nfoglietta (a volume measure for wine and oil, because of Roman variant “fojetta”)\n\nj (as a lemma in itself)\n\njunior\n\nnavaja\n\nragià (because of variant form “rajah”)\n\nFor the sake of curiosity, adding the 18th century only yields “acajou”, “jacquerie” and “Tokaj”, while in the 19th century a first tide of foreign terms began, from “abat-jour” to “navajo” (with, in last alphabetical position a curious, Neapolitan “scetavajasse”).\n\nSo, much as I personally love the letter “j” and would use it everywhere, I guess the answer to your question is a firm no (give or take a wandering fidejussore)."
