Whenever rivalries for the control of this region between the superpowers of the time have required, the French regime or government has followed an Arab policy based upon a myth of empire. After the Six-Day War in 1967, when observers looked for signs of a new Arab policy, what they saw was actually a reflection of a more global change in situation, in which the Arab world on one side and Israel on the other were participants in a new political engagement. France’s decisions to pull out of NATO’s integrated command and to build a nuclear weapon, and de Gaulle’s 1963 speech at Phnom Penh condemning American intervention in Vietnam, were, at that time, the fundamental decisions that gave meaning to a new nationalist approach. This approach, ending the decolonization of Algeria and the imperialist adventure, attempted to reconstruct a collective destiny after a crisis that had nearly plunged France into civil war. It all began with Napoleon Bonaparte’s expedition to Egypt in 1798. The expedition, which only lasted three years, was clearly the consequence of the Enlightenment philosophers’ perception of Ottoman decadence.1 This perception had already raised the problem of how to reform and modernize non-European societies, be it through revolution from within or by intervention from without—which would imply the breakup of the Ottoman Empire. The French intervention was, in fact, provoked more by the urgent need the revolutionary leaders felt to find a remote, perilous task for the burdensome victor of the Italian campaigns than by any desire to modernize the Orient. But the element of reform and modernization was nevertheless manifest in the presence of some three hundred scholars and engineers who embarked with Bonaparte. These scholars found the Rosetta stone and studied the flora and fauna of the region as well as the irrigation system and the monuments, both ancient and modern, of Egypt. In three years’ work, they imposed upon this country the analytical method put forth by Diderot and d’Alembert, authors of the Encyclopedia. The published results of this research extended over a period going well beyond the fall of Napoleon’s Empire, and covered as well most of the modernization projects undertaken in nineteenth-century Egypt, including the project to link the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. 3\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 4 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nDIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nA desire to defeat Bonaparte’s war-driven utopia provoked Great Britain’s interest in the region, especially in order to protect its interests in India. Thus one can see from the start the three factors that in the long run dominated the development of France’s Arab policy: a cultural project to modernize the Arab world; short-term concerns over domestic policy; and international political rivalries. This last aspect is most often evident in the nineteenth century in terms of the Franco-British rivalry, but it had an indirect influence on the European balance of power in general. Although the first factor was not active at the beginning of the French conquest of Algeria, the other two certainly were. They constituted, from that moment on, an Arab and Islamic policy that was dominated by the rivalry with Great Britain for control over the Mediterranean and the passage to India. In the long run, the building of a colonial empire appeared after 1815 to be a compensation for the impossibility of dominating the continent, which would have drawn Great Britain and Austria into a new conflict. The system that Metternich and Talleyrand put into place neutralized any attempt by France to break with the balance of power, for France was still suspected of harboring revolutionary and expansionist tendencies. These tendencies were channeled into colonial adventures; after the defeat of 1871, the system was reinforced, as Bismarck harbored a plan to facilitate French intervention in Tunisia, thereby creating friction between France and Italy as well as distancing France from any desire to reconquer Alsace-Lorraine. In the southern reorientation imposed on its expansionist desires, France sought to use its political influence in facing the Ottoman Empire and its dependencies both near and far. France attempted, however, to consolidate its local influence in a lasting way without coming directly into conflict with Great Britain. The abandonment of Egypt’s Muhammad Ali (1839–1840) and the backing down at Fashoda (1898) demonstrate the primacy of these choices in terms of the European balance of power. Expansion abroad also served to compensate for France’s demographic deficits by bringing in imperial troops that would eventually fight in both world wars. France developed a vision of its regional presence and a long-term project to legitimize its domination over the Muslim populations. The work of the Saint-Simonians in Muhammad Ali’s Egypt,2 the protection of the Christians in Lebanon in 1860, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the intervention of French banks in the management of the Egyptian debt and then of the Ottoman debt all demonstrate the coherence of this regional project. The aid given to Christian religious orders, to la mission laique and to the Alliance française in the construction of a network of influence that spanned the Ottoman Empire, Iran, and Egypt completed this vision. Before Bonaparte’s invasion of Egypt and then the French conquest of Algeria in 1830, France forged an amicable relationship with the Ottoman Empire, which had, in the time of Francis I and Louis XIV, allowed it to assume the protection of the Eastern Christians who still followed Rome. By virtue of the treaties called “capitulations,” French consuls were authorized to withdraw from local jurisdiction a large number of subjects of the empire by registering them as “protégés.” These protégés, who came largely from the Christian and Jewish minorities, later constituted a ready-made clientele for French schools established there. Although French influence was maintained 4\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 5 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nFRANCE’S ARAB POLICY\n\non both cultural and political levels thanks to this protection of minorities, however, the affront to the caliph brought about by showing him to be unable to defend the Dar al-Islam against the attacks of miscreants made any deeper political association impossible. The British and the Prussians would profit from this situation to expand political and military cooperation with the Ottoman Empire, progressively setting themselves up as protectors of the empire. The French, who, until the eighteenth century, had benefited from a sympathetic reception, were from this point on considered dangerous predators, although less so than the Russians. The Crimean War would, of course, allow for a new alliance with the Ottomans against Russia, but under British supervision. The occupation of Tunisia in 1882 only deepened the humiliation at a time when the Ottoman Empire was giving in to foreign appetites everywhere. The Qajar Empire in Persia did not constitute a prize comparable to the Ottoman Empire on the route to India, even though Napoleon himself had dreamed of taking up Alexander’s path. French consuls there were more concerned merely to observe Anglo-Russian rivalries, and had enough time on their hands to interest themselves, as Gobineau did, in racial theory or, as others did, in archeology. In the regions it controlled directly, France established the foundations for what was to be an exemplary empire, a civilizing mission as much as a conquest, in the image of ancient Rome—different from and yet comparable to the British Raj in India. It was the vision of what Prévost-Paradol called a “New France” designing its own empire—less powerful and smaller than that of Great Britain—one that touched the southern shores of the Mediterranean and that would therefore be an integral part of Metropolitan France. “The Mediterranean flows through the center of the empire just as the Seine flows through Paris.”3 Tocqueville had also thought that the installation of a large colonial population of Europeans was the best way to guarantee France’s domination in the long run. In practise, however, it became difficult to reconcile such an objective with the principle of equality, or to consider the interests and needs of the Muslim populations for democratic representation. Under the influence of Ismail Urbain, Napoleon III tried to do just this, by developing while on his travels in the region the concept of an “Arab kingdom” in Algeria.4 Actually, the realization of a need to consider local populations dates from the creation of the bureaux arabes by Bugeaud,5 as a counterweight to the services more specifically dedicated to helping the colons, especially as concerned access to real estate. In the acceptance of French domination by the Muslim populations in Algeria, Napoleon III saw the basis for a peaceful presence following the military conquest. This required that France take responsibility for the interests of these populations, together with instituting a policy of assimilation. But the emperor’s personal involvement and his instructions to governors Pélissier and MacMahon were not successful in offsetting the dominant attitude, which sought to impose a European population of Mediterranean origin upon Arab and Berber populations. The confrontation was over the control of the land and the right of suffrage. Although there were differences in terms of sovereignty, France’s extension of its domination to Tunisia in 1882 and to Morocco in 1912 continued the debates about the Algerian model. Despite the efforts of republican statesmen such as Clémenceau, 5\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 6 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nDIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nHerriot, Viollette, and Blum, the colons succeeded in their fight against all reformist legislation that was intended to increase the civil rights and resources available to the Muslim populations. These populations suffered under a profoundly unjust domination until the very end, which would cause the revolt of the 1950s. Nonetheless, the contact with French society did exert a cultural influence as well as allow for the dissemination of certain social and behavioral models. In the Middle East, the First World War transformed the Franco-British rivalry into an uneasy association in order to share the spoils of the Ottoman Empire. The Sykes-Picot accords (1916) still constitute today, along with the Balfour Declaration (1917) and the Crusades, the favorite references that Arabs and Islamists use to illustrate the never-ending plot by the West against Islam. Suspicious of British projects to structure the region by creating an Arab kingdom under British control, the French treated Faisal in Damascus like a rebellious tribal chief and administered the Syrian and Lebanese territories they were entrusted with according to principles that, for more than a century, had proven their effectiveness in the Maghrib; they played upon divisions in language, community, and geography through a direct administration unencumbered by the presence of colons. As in the Maghrib, this system produced a confrontation with a French-speaking native elite that soon engaged in nationalist activities. For a long while, this elite counted on the negotiated reformist solutions that were proposed each time the French Left came into power, notably at the time of the Front populaire in 1936. But other priorities of both international and domestic origin always stopped these reforms succeeding. The deputies elected by the colons of Algeria, members of Léon Blum’s slim majority in Parliament, had no trouble in deferring action. Even so, the Arab nationalists did not exploit the French defeat of 1940, and resisted the advances of Hitler and Mussolini. The administration and the vast majority of the colons remained loyal to the Vichy government both in the Maghrib and in the Middle East. Those who rallied to Free France were marginal types (aristocrats, Freemasons, Jews, socialists). De Gaulle’s troops fought in Syria alongside the British against those of Vichy. On the other hand, in 1942, Noguès, then Resident General in Morocco, ordered that the Americans debarking at Kénitra be fired upon. When the civil and military administration of Vichy finally rallied to the cause of the Allies, it attempted to do so by squeezing out de Gaulle and by supporting traditional military leaders such as Giraud and Darlan. Nonetheless, the Maghrib nationalists had an intuitive feeling for de Gaulle, perhaps as a result of the liberal tone of the speech he gave at Brazzaville, and probably also owing to the negative reaction the colons had to him. They actively collaborated with the Free French forces in mobilizing troops for the Italian and French campaigns. Oufkir, Ben Bella, Boudiaf, and many others served valiantly as commissioned and noncommissioned officers and were decorated for their war efforts. At the war’s end, Muhammad V was made a Compagnon de la Libération by de Gaulle in recognition of the role played by the Moroccan troops in the return to battle of a France that had been defeated in 1940. The Maghrib nationalists, however, expected, as they did at the end of World War I, a generous and progressive attitude from France with respect to their requests for independence. Once again they were faced with the obtuse and brutal response of a 6\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 7 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nFRANCE’S ARAB POLICY\n\nweakened France that was fearful of confronting a decolonization that would destroy its empire and deal the final blow to its world status. The fierce repression of the riots in Setif of May 8, 1945, in which Algerian Muslims participated in celebrating the Allied victory while simultaneously demanding independence, sharply illustrates these contradictions. Thousands died in these riots, which can be considered as the beginning of the war in Algeria inasmuch as they demonstrate a clear break with the attitudes of the colonized people in that country. Although for a few years France was still able to continue a purely repressive response in the Maghrib owing to the colon presence, the proximity of Metropolitan France, and the indifference of the rest of the world, this was not the case in the Middle East. As early as 1943, the Lebanese Maronites, Sunnis, and Shi`ites reached a “national pact” for power sharing and cooperation to achieve independence at the end of the war. Paris could no longer simply bombard Damascus, as in 1925, in order to impose its domination. The regional and worldwide responsibilities of Great Britain obliged it to work against French dreams in the Middle East, whereas, as a result of Algeria’s annexation into the French national territory, the Maghrib remained a matter of French domestic politics—a fact that at the time was contested by no one. It is in this ambiguous context of Franco-British relations that one must situate the attitudes toward Zionism and the birth of the state of Israel. In the beginning, the British support for Herzl’s Zionist project seemed like a bizarre way of reinforcing British influence in the region by rendering themselves indispensable as both arbiters and protectors in the conflict between the Jews and Arabs of Palestine, whereas they refused to allow the French to play a similar role (between Christians and Muslims) in Lebanon. In addition, the French Jewish community had shown no interest in Zionism before World War II. When, after 1945, Jewish terrorist movements began to attack Great Britain they could count on covert support from the French Secret Service, which was thrilled to discomfit a neighbor who had been guilty of bad behavior during the Syro-Lebanese conflict with France in 1945. Léon Blum’s rise to power in 1947 facilitated contacts with future Israeli leaders. According to the pattern established in the help given to the Spanish Republicans in 1936, weapons were bought and volunteers recruited. The indirect military support given to the state of Israel was also a function of the not-yet-admitted guilt of the Vichy government in its deportation of French Jews during the German occupation. Moreover, the image of a small state resisting a hostile environment created a wellspring of public support and rendered the sale of weapons a much more acceptable act, and also justified for the elites the assistance given later toward the creation of a strategic nuclear weapon. These two very sensitive programs were jointly developed in order to insure the greatest level of autonomy possible in the West in opposition to both Great Britain and the United States. The emergence of an Arab nationalist movement after the 1952 revolution in Egypt—a country that was then just as much an adversary of France as of Great Britain, engaged, as it was from 1954, in the Algerian war as well as the opposition to Israel—justified the political and military cooperation that reached its height at the time of the Suez campaign of 1956. 7\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 8 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nDIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nThe struggles for independence in the Maghrib were waged in the name of the egalitarian principles put forward by the school of Jules Ferry and disseminated by the French-speaking elites. This rendered the break with the imperial past less brutal and more ambiguous in the Maghrib than in the Middle East. It is in this regard that the years 1956 and 1962 are symbolic. The first date marks the end of a period of Franco-British rivalry in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and Africa. The nationalization of the Suez Canal and the failure of the Franco-British expedition served as important moments. After these events, the region was caught in the rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States, polarized by the Israeli-Arab conflict and by the efforts undertaken to assure control of the oil industry. The year 1962, bringing the end of the Algerian conflict, marks also the end of the imperial dream; the economic, political, and cultural consequences continue to be felt today on both sides of the Mediterranean. From the beginning of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth, through its Arab policy France played skillfully and sometimes powerfully the imperial game that the European powers—Britain, Germany, and to some extent Italy and Spain—all played. This Arab policy was rarely described as such, though with respect to the positioning of the different players involved in the Ottoman Empire, one spoke occasionally of a Muslim policy. In any case, the leaders of the European states felt it important to intervene in the Arab world in order to preserve their ranking in the state system. It was Tocqueville who put forward this idea to justify the occupation of Algeria, although he also analyzed the negative aspects of such intervention. If, at the time of Tocqueville, France’s Arab policy made sense, its later expression as well as its final episodes were based on a misconception. Correcting a Misconception: The Gaullist Policy The break of 1962 makes sense only if interpreted as the nationalist disengagement from a colonial relationship no longer seen as positive in terms of France’s long-term interests. De Gaulle’s attitude toward the Algerian conflict was, however, riddled with ambiguity. Having risen to power with the help of the military and the colons, who believed that the war could not be won without a total victory over the F.L.N., he had to equivocate. He needed to acquire personal legitimacy by means of a series of national referendums and legislative elections, while at the same time ensuring control over Algeria through military operations undertaken both in the cities and in the country. Thus, with the support of French public opinion, which starting in 1960 wanted to see an end to the conflict, he was able to undertake the withdrawal from Algeria. The separation was painful: there was nearly a civil war, and four attempts were made upon the life of the head of state; there was also a revolt within the army, justified by the Gaullist tradition of disobedience. A double referendum in favor of independence was necessary, one to determine the choice of Algeria, and the other to confirm this choice in metropolitan France. This breaking of ties created a million refugees and caused nearly 100,000 civilian and military casualties for the French side alone. On the Algerian side, losses were estimated at a million dead and disappeared. More than thirty years later, these events still leave an ambiguous mark upon the perceptions of both sides involved in the conflict. In the end, the painful memory of the 8\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 9 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nFRANCE’S ARAB POLICY\n\npast is of as much concern to the million French pieds-noirs refugees and their descendants as to the veterans of the war and the descendants of the harkis (Algerians who served with the French forces during the 1954–1962 war in Algeria), as well as to the descendants of the Algerian immigrants who live in France, whose numbers now greatly surpass those of the European colonists who had lived in the Maghrib. Even today, each group reacts to current events in the Arab world according to the community to which it belongs. This collective conscience is an integral part of each community and influences the ways in which it integrates into French society. The sad events of the past explain positions taken today, allowing one to better understand a brutal and yet ambiguous separation. As someone who knew Great Britain well, General de Gaulle wished to save France from the decadent and morose atmosphere surrounding the British loss of empire. To accomplish this, he attempted to give France a new role as an autonomous power, without neglecting the alliances necessary to strengthen Europe as a whole. He was careful not to break with his allies, even while being a difficult partner. Another effect of the 1962 rupture was that the Mediterranean became a barrier once again. Despite the efforts made to raise living standards in the region, some saw this barrier as the French refusal to integrate a population of 10 million poor and illiterate Muslims as equals. These perceptions remain powerful even today, and one occasionally has the impression that a sort of collective unconscious continues to influence each side’s behavior. It was in the context of this search for a new worldwide status that France began to develop an Arab policy that appeared to be in direct contradiction of what was expected. The first surprise came from the fact that, despite the emigration to the Metropole of one million refugees, and the assassinations of both harkis and European civilians, the decolonization of Algeria was not nearly as catastrophic as had been predicted. The model of Guinea seemed to indicate that a complete and total rupture was inevitable. Nonetheless, an extensive program of cooperation (including military cooperation) between France and Algeria was put into place, inspiring the amazement and at times even the indignation of neighboring countries such as Morocco. This cooperation, however, was the product not of an inexplicably charitable gesture but of a convergence of interests. The Evian accords seemed to preserve the vestiges of the old empire, such as the clauses guaranteeing the status and freedom of circulation, and the choice of citizenship for Europeans living in Algeria and for Algerians in France. Since these clauses were soon to be obsolete, they posed no problem to the two sides engaged in a formal separation. On the other hand, those clauses which preserved French oil interests, as well as temporary nuclear arms-testing centers in the Sahara and military bases, were scrupulously respected. These were, in fact, essential elements of the worldwide French policy of which the Arab policy was only a part. Observers have, at times, mistaken the part for the whole. General de Gaulle was careful not to reveal his intentions, thereby finding opportunities to reinforce his strengths. Essentially his decisions were focussed elsewhere, depending on the role he wanted France to play in Europe and the world. Seen in this light, the decisions to restart the dialogue with Algeria and to create new contacts with nonaligned countries made sense. These countries were, in fact, following a policy 9\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 10 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nDIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nsimilar to that of France. At the same time, the reconciliation with Adenauer’s Germany, the Elysée treaty (1963), and the support for the Common Agricultural Policy were fundamental elements on the new direction France was taking in Europe. At the time, the Arab world took a back seat in terms of priorities and means to French-speaking Africa—and the Arab world could not be considered as a single unit. In the Maghrib, Algeria remained the primary partner. The Bizerte crisis in 1961 with Tunisia, and the Ben Barka conflict in 1965 with Morocco both contributed to the deterioration of the political ties between these countries and France’s Fifth Republic. On the whole, cultural cooperation probably remained the most important element in France’s relations with the Maghrib in the long run. It remained a durable if evolving element, with television replacing schools. Beyond whatever choices each state made in this domain, the influence of civil society made its mark and compensated for the decline in public funding. Emigration soon created a transnational domain in which influences and cultural and social models were exchanged. The strongest ties that exist today between France and the Maghrib come from civil society, beyond the destructive effects of governmental policies that attempt to break them by suppressing nearly all north/south contacts. Should one, then, speak of an “Arab policy,” or rather of transnational relations that mix domestic and foreign cultural, economic and political influences? In this new domain, states tend to lose their ability to act or even control. With respect to these matters the 1980s marked a turning point, coming on the heels of the independence movements, as a result of the ties created between the north and the south through new immigrants and their images of Europe, images that would soon be reinforced by the television shows picked up on parabolic antennas. In the Middle East, the situation is profoundly different. The Suez crisis created a deep schism, and the ties that were later established never attained the same human aspect, except perhaps those with Lebanon. After Suez, the rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States was in place, centered on the Israeli-Arab conflict and the control of oil profits. In this context, the Fourth Republic remained too paralyzed by its inability to administer the decolonization of the Maghrib to do anything other than maintain simple ties of solidarity with the state of Israel and a special cooperation with Lebanon. From his rise to power in 1958 to the end of the Algerian war in 1962, de Gaulle would follow the same path, hindered by difficult diplomatic relations with the principal countries in this region that voted regularly against France in the United Nations. He was far from enthusiastic about the American Middle East policy, but he did not react to the sending of U.S. marines to Beirut in 1958, or to the union of Egypt and Syria. Having long been pushed off the Middle Eastern scene by his involvement in the Algerian conflict, de Gaulle came back to it at a time when he was going through a general reevaluation of his relations with the United States. Maurice Couve de Murville, his minister of foreign affairs at the time, contributed to this new strategy of distancing within NATO as well as seeking convergence with positions held by the nonaligned countries. Couve, the French ambassador in Cairo in the1950s, did not have a negative view of Nasir’s revolution. But Egypt, then heavily dependent on the 10\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 11 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nFRANCE’S ARAB POLICY\n\nSoviet Union for the construction of the Aswan Dam and for reequiping its military, was slow to respond. It was in this context that the French declared their disapproval of Israel’s initiating hostilities in 1967. This disapproval came out of the feeling that the conflict would increase the influence of the two heavyweights, the United States and the Soviet Union, in the region. France’s reservations were expressed in the Council of Ministers declaration of June 2, 1967, that “France is not cooperating with any of the states involved in this conflict in any way on any subject. Therefore, whichever state should decide to use military force, wherever this may occur, will not enjoy France’s approval nor any kind of support.” The Arab world’s reaction, at first incredulous, far outstripped the actual extent of France’s commitment, and created a symbolic image of de Gaulle as coming to the aid of their mythic leader, Nasir, weakened in defeat. After 1967, France’s Middle East policy sought to emerge from the abyss, and attempted to find a diversified discourse well adapted to the region’s situation. But compared to previous positions (before 1940 and even before 1956), the results were meager. Now the rivals were the United States and the Soviet Union, countries that were much more powerful than Great Britain had been. Envious and disdainful of the “commercial diplomacy” of West Germany, France looked for a way to have a greater, more diversified presence than its partners in the European Community without going beyond the “collective declarations” or getting involved in elaborating a truly European political cooperation in the region.6 Promising security guarantees to Israel became an American problem, and the globalization of the oil market led Washington to consider a region harboring 50 percent of the world’s oil reserves as essential to its security. These two factors explain the depth of American commitment as well as the reactions of France which, in 1967, on the heels of the Six-Day War—as in Phnom Penh—would mark a different approach. Israel’s increasing tendency to align itself with the American positions doubtless played an important role in General de Gaulle’s distancing himself from this country. Additionally, the dangers that Israel was running in Lebanon, through both its violent reactions and its efforts to destabilize Lebanese domestic politics, all contributed to solidifying the French desire to disapprove of its actions. Although France tried to present a voice distinct from that of the American discourse in the Middle East, notably with respect to a balanced solution to the Palestinian problem, it could not ignore reality. The French found a niche of their own by aligning with states that had taken up the path of a modernization that overcame regional and ethnic divisions. In this respect, Iraq and Egypt were closer and more familiar partners than Saudi Arabia. For a long time, Egypt had expounded, through its jurists and judges, a French concept concerning the role of the state as well as the importance of the legal rules, which today is often in competition with the ideas of those who have attended American universities. But France scarcely understood that it had contributed to the construction of Arab nation-states that, although often made in France’s image, could not but resist direct French influence. De Gaulle, with his own profoundly nationalist point of view, could more easily recognize the Arab nationalism of Nasir and Ben Bella than could the 11\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 12 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nDIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nFrench Left. Domestic political objectives changed over the years. In the nineteenth century, the Maghrib had been the dumping ground for those who lost revolutions and wars (for example, the rebellious Parisians of 1848 and the inhabitants of Alsace-Lorraine who were exiled in 1871). It was also an expansionist safety valve for ambitious military leaders who would otherwise have threatened the Republic and democracy after 1871. In order to construct its majorities, the Left needed the representatives elected by the colons in Algeria, whose support was conditioned by the demand to drop reforms, especially those that would have extended the right to vote to the Muslims without their giving up their personal status. In addition, the traumatic memory of the pieds-noirs refugees, the harkis, and the veterans of the Algerian war would long influence the images and perceptions of France’s relations with the Maghrib. The transitional period of decolonization seemed therefore to come to an end with the fall of the Iron Curtain and with the Oslo accords. The Gulf War demonstrated the dominant American role in this region as well as the defeat of the strategies of nonaligned countries that had received a warm reception in France. The Oslo accords, however, have been far from successful in bringing peace, and the difficulties of applying their clauses leave room for the intervention of other players should they find it in their interest. Even so, experience has shown that the intervention of a single mid-sized country has neither much meaning nor credibility in the Middle East. In times of crisis, such as during the Gulf War, the validating power of American policy cannot but leave a feeling of helplessness and isolation as soon as one strays from it. Nevertheless, a special French relationship with the Maghrib has been preserved, even though memories of the colonial period and the civil war in Algeria continue to paralyze it. There is still need for an Arab policy that would depend, on the one hand, upon the solidarity of the Muslim community in France and, on the other, upon the strength of the European Community. It is the European Community that should establish well-balanced relations with the surrounding regions, such as the Maghrib and Turkey, which constitute special partners in that they both have large expatriate communities living in Europe. The fall of the Ottoman Empire was sealed by a primitive peace treaty signed in Sèvres in the spirit of the Versailles treaty. Mustafa Kemal’s refusal to recognize it, and his efforts to create a homogenous nation-state that implied a total withdrawal from the Middle East, were recognized by the Herriot government in 1924. At that time, France renounced the idea of expanding its Syrian mandate to part of Anatolia. In 1939, the French even ceded the province (sandjak) of Alexandretta (Iskanderun) in order to help maintain Turkey’s neutrality in World War II. Later, Turkey became a key element in NATO’s arsenal against the Soviet Union, and very quickly became interested in the construction of the European Community. The Europeans did not greet this interest nearly as warmly as they did that of the Greeks, the Spanish and the Portuguese. The 1997 denial of membership was reversed in 1999, but the solution to the Kurdish question remains vital to Europe, especially for Germany, which does not wish to see the conflicts of the Anatolian plateau transferred to German cities. In the end, the integration of the Balkans into the European Union, a possibility since the 12\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 13 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nFRANCE’S ARAB POLICY\n\nKosovo crisis, would make it both acceptable and necessary to offer the same treatment to Turkey, which would then become a stabilizing factor in the entire region, whereas the Maghrib is neither a logical candidate for, nor in any way desirous of, being a part of the European Union. Perceptions of Iran have also changed, with Europe taking over the relations with this country. For many years it was considered the privileged domain of Anglo-Russian rivalry; the British dominance became a reality after the Qajar dynasty was overthrown by Reza Shah thanks to the implantation of British Petroleum in the exploitation of oil fields and at the Abadan refinery. France remained outside these rivalries, and was still in this outside position when Musaddiq in the early fifties nationalized the oil industry and temporarily forced the shah into exile. France did participate in the boycott of the Iranian national company and was not unhappy to see the American-orchestrated return of the shah, which put Iran, a country on the border of East-West rivalries, under Washington’s lasting influence. On the other hand, years later, after the departure of the shah, France’s relations with the regime of Ayatollah Khomeini rapidly deteriorated, to the point where Iran was accused of encouraging the terrorist attacks that occurred in Paris during the summer of 1986. One can find the origin of this confrontation in the French military aid given to Iraq when it engaged in war with Iran (1980–1988) as well as in the French intervention in Lebanon in 1982 following the Israeli invasion. When Iran stopped proselytizing among the Muslim minorities in Europe and contented itself with its role of regional power—having its word in the Middle East conflicts—calmer Franco-Iranian relations were established. But it was through the European dimension of the “critical dialogue” with Iran, in which Germany took the lead, that France reformulated its ties with Iran, while being associated with the uproar around the Mykonos restaurant case.7 Enlarging the Field and Increasing the Players What was perceived from outside, and at times claimed, as France’s Arab policy was based upon the East-West blocs, nonalignment, and the construction of nation-states in the Arab world. The Gulf War, the march toward economic globalization, and the reduced role of separate states marked the end of these parameters. The emergence of Islamic movements that reject both the authority of states and certain constraints of globalization only complicates the situation further. In many ways, these changes render a coherent Arab policy even more necessary, but the most important players are no longer the same. Indeed, neither the emergence of regional subsystems capable of protecting each player, nor the balance of economic relations, nor the expansion of new fields of economic relations concerning culture and society are yet perceptible on either the Arab or the European side. In this intermediate phase, however, the influence of the United States remains dominant without guaranteeing an efficient regulation. The control exerted by each state that participates in the separate subsystems is thus downgraded and, more often than not, reduced to an ability to create a nuisance or to block initiatives. A “call to empire” is developing among members of the middle class in the countries of the south, who have been deprived of the politics of nonalignment, cultural opportunities, and grand state projects. Their ability to convert to a 13\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 14 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nDIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nglobal economy is not guaranteed, at least in this generation. The risk of a proletarianization without an opening to the outside world brings about a nostalgic and critical evocation of the good old days of the Arab policies not only of France but also of the Soviet Union. Then, states had real roles to play, which indirectly afforded intermediary elites social mobility. A new definition of Franco-Arab relations is needed. The goal of playing a role in the Middle East peace process and in the reconfiguring of a region, while respecting the security concerns of the Israelis and the desire for prosperity shared by the Palestinians and the other players in the region, requires greater capacities than those of any single country, even the United States. The United States will remain, however, a privileged partner in dialogue for both sides. The current barriers to the peace process, the risks of collapse, and the increase in rejections coming from identity movements do nonetheless leave room for more balanced support and mediation than those of the current American interventions. In the Maghrib, where France enjoys political, economic, and cultural influence, the effectiveness of its interventions is weakened by a colonial past that prevents it from doing anything other than supporting the governments currently in power. France also fears that the civil war in Algeria could be waged on its own territory. The Maghrib is not a priority for the United States, which does, however, reserve the right to exert great influence in certain domains. The other European countries have shown some concern without demonstrating the desire to get involved in a way that France would not like. France, which for many years believed that it could play a role in the Maghrib comparable to that of the United States in the rest of the world, must now be disappointed. During Hassan II’s funeral, President Clinton found it the most natural thing in the world to be the first to present his condolences to Muhammad VI in the company of James Baker, who continues to play a role in the arbitration over the Western Sahara conflict. Many of the measures that had been in the domain of bilateral politics, such as agriculture, fishing, and visas, have entered the domain of collective administration. Others are subject to close consultation. In the Europe-Mediterranean partnership one can see a common foreign policy coming into being. France, while desiring this, occasionally gives the impression of being incapable of playing its part correctly in the collective symphony, demonstrating that it sees itself more as a soloist being backed up by the rest of the European orchestra. To continue with this comparison, one might hypothesize that, concerning the important issues (major conflicts, human rights, defense, energy), the United States is already playing the part of soloist, while France is, at best, first violin in a European orchestra playing before a North African audience rarely satisfied with its performance. Additionally, the confrontations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and the social and political changes in the Maghrib, are integral parts of the group of issues that greatly concern those populations of Maghrib origin and Muslim culture now living in France. Their loyalty, constantly questioned on the occasion of external tensions such as the Gulf War and generally confirmed by the facts, presupposes the French state’s taking into consideration their external ties—be it with regard to the Palestinians or the Maghrib. 14\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 15 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nFRANCE’S ARAB POLICY\n\nIf France is to preserve its interests and demonstrate concern for the Arab world on both a governmental and a societal level, it must find a way to reconcile this approach with its first and foremost responsibilities, which today tie it to the European Union. It must take into account the role played in foreign policy and in collective defense by a NATO that is largely dominated by the United States but embraced as well by its European partners. Moreover, the fifteen states of the European Union lack a coherent foreign policy. The declaration of Venice in 1980, which was largely the product of a Franco-German consensus to recognize the fact of the Palestinian nation, constitutes an important precedent despite its exceptional nature. The choice of a European envoy to the Middle East is another example of an advance in this sense. One can, however, hardly imagine the European Union quickly adopting a policy and naming an executive with the means to act credibly. Once the single-currency stage has been successfully dealt with, one might see groups of states within the European system that will act in concert with respect to certain issues and will agree to abandon certain privileges of sovereignty, as was done with the Schengen accords. Such a strategy would make it easier to develop a common European foreign policy with respect to both the Maghrib and the Middle East. New Perspectives A Europe based upon contractual solidarity between states that vary in size and shape casts the central problem in new terms. The first thing to be done is to recognize the importance of the Muslim culture within Europe as the foundation of a collective identity of the populations originating in the Maghrib, Turkey, and the Indian subcontinent. This recognition would validate for these individuals their right to remain citizens of European countries without having to abandon too much of their culture. Beyond assimilating religious difference within a new pluralistic context, this also presupposes accepting, at least in the transitional stage, the principle of double nationality, and the establishment of ties of solidarity with the countries of origin. In these elements one can see sketched out the new bases of what would eventually become a new policy, no longer simply an Arab policy, but also an Arab-Muslim policy, for Europe. This policy would be based on the cultural reconfiguration of the European space through collective regulation, as well as norms and values that would guarantee the legitimate rights of the populations living there. In this respect, the European courts of justice are the only supranational mechanisms able to fix the customary and progressive bases of the necessary adaptation of the practices of each country. In this area, one thinks first of the problems concerning collective status and behavior (such as the issue of the veil) that create disparities between European countries. One can also imagine that citizenship which influences the free circulation of persons and their right to live where they choose would be the object in the future of harmonizing legislation. It is clearly difficult to manage a population living in a country by cutting it off from any human, cultural, or family contact with its country of origin, as is the intent of the current policy that restricts visas. The right to naturalization must also be adjusted so as to limit conflicts with the countries of origin. 15\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 16 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nDIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nIn general, this means a policy of solidarity between Europe and the regions where these populations originate, including economic aid and free circulation of people, capital, and merchandise, as well as mutual security guarantees. The territories affected by these possible commitments would greatly extend the borders of the area currently considered essential for European defense. According to this approach, issues such as the Kurdish question in its regional and Middle Eastern dimensions would have to be solved, if one wants to avoid suffering the consequences in Europe, as the Mykonos case demonstrates.7 The relations between the Turkish army and the Islamists could also create tensions in German cities. The same is true today of the consequences for French suburbs of the civil war in Algeria. This leads Europe, or at least those states which are determined to contract a strong commitment to domestic and foreign solidarity (probably with the Franco-German dyad at the center), to make possible a common foreign policy that will concern both the Eastern European countries and the Arab-Muslim world. If the immigration currently flowing into Europe constitutes an important element in a mutual relationship of influence and transnationality with the southern and eastern Mediterranean, this is not the sole determining factor today. Energy needs in Europe are based on a complex balancing of nuclear power (less and less popular with its citizens), oil (susceptible to a world market dominated by the United States), and gas resources. This last resource is provided through a network of pipelines from Siberia, the North Sea, and the Maghrib. Since Spain and Italy have refused to use nuclear power, the fixed supply lines with Algeria that pass through Tunisia on the one hand and Morocco on the other are essential for these two countries. These factors, coupled with Europe’s interest in having a partnership with a North African market of about 70 million inhabitants, should push Europe to work toward the unity and stability of these three North African countries. Beyond that, the Maghrib might also be deemed a part of the common European foreign policy (rather than simply a region that France alone is responsible for). This presupposes a European policy on the Algerian civil war, on the Western Sahara and on human rights violations in Tunisia. If Europe is unable to develop a truly autonomous policy concerning these issues, it will find NATO making use of resources which, by expanding its missions beyond its traditional borders, will be a way for the Americans to resolve crises on the model of those in the Balkans. Although, aside from times of crisis, Europe does not need the United States to solve its problems with the Maghrib, the questions concerning Turkey and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are more complex. Without the burden of a colonial past, Turkey has developed relations with Germany that are comparable to those between France and the Maghrib. But it has participated in NATO’s missions right from the start, and its zones of strategic and defensive importance cover the Balkans, the Straits, the Caucasus, and the Muslim republics of the ex-Soviet Union and the Middle East. Its conflict with Greece over the islands of the Aegean Sea required the personal intervention of President Clinton to prevent the use of force. In addition, the occupation of the northern part of Cyprus by the Turkish army has created a conflict within NATO and is one of the main reasons why Turkey cannot enter the European Union despite favorable attitudes by France and the United States. Germany is now considering (with 16\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 17 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nFRANCE’S ARAB POLICY\n\nsome reservations) Turkey’s entry into the European Community, since, in becoming citizens, the two million Turkish inhabitants in Germany would acquire rights equal to those of Turkish citizens in Turkey. This bundle of criss-crossed interests demonstrates the urgency for a European policy with regard to a country that has for many years been a candidate for entry into the European Union and that is capable of blocking the eastward expansion of NATO. For all these reasons, a common European policy with regard to Turkey is a priority. This policy should coexist with an American commitment, which one would hope—because of its own needs, including those in dealing with Europe—would have a reasonable amount of weight in the long-term decision-making process. In the domain of the nearby Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which will only be partially resolved by the accords signed in Oslo and Washington for as long as Syria and Lebanon remain outside these agreements, Europe’s essential problem is to make itself heard in the concert that the Americans wish to direct. Isolated actions undertaken by individual European states have few chances to succeed, despite the acute interest that France has in Lebanon or that Great Britain has in Jordan. Egypt maintains strong, well-balanced ties with the principal European nations, but the diplomatic, military, and financial commitments made by the United States since the Camp David accords of 1979 to guarantee Israel’s defense through negotiated settlements remain dominant. These commitments were renewed after the Gulf War in the accords signed in Madrid, and then by those signed in Washington in 1993. American aid to Egypt, which since 1979 has been proportional to that given to Israel, contributes to the region’s stability. Today, Europe collectively supports the Palestinian Authority by covering 60 percent of its costs, although it has no political power to influence the decisions being made in the current peace process. It was only after the American intervention of December 1996 that an agreement concerning Hebron was reached. No European state alone can claim comparable political power. The Germans remain handicapped in this region by their history, which makes it impossible for them to take a position hostile to Israel. Germany needs a European framework, as was the case with the declaration of Venice in 1980, in order to take a more balanced position. Only consensus mechanisms among the leading European nations can compensate for the lack of a common foreign policy and render valuable the investment of financial support given to the Palestinian Authority. If the Mykonos restaurant case and, before that, the establishment of a critical dialogue led to a coordinated European policy concerning Iran, this is not the case for positions regarding Iraq. Commercial diplomacy and/or humanitarian intervention, and the desire either to support or to combat American positions, have all been characteristic of European attitudes at different times; European states’ participation in the Gulf War was never a determining factor in their reactions years later. With respect to Tehran, the Salman Rushdie case and the accusations of state-sponsored terrorism have slowed down what could have been an effort at normalization of relations. With respect to Iraq, its refusal to dismantle its nuclear, chemical, biological, and ballistic weapons arsenal constitutes the primary point of contention for all sides. In both cases it is the United States that necessarily runs the show, along with Great Britain, either directly or through the United Nations. 17\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 18 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nDIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nConclusion The reality of France’s Arab and Muslim policy was not perceived as such until it became an important part of a vaster imperial project. Paradoxically, it was de Gaulle’s break with the empire and the search for an autonomous path for France, one which would bypass the superpowers, that allowed France to come together at times with certain nonaligned Arab countries. This “Arab policy,” isolated from its context since the fall of the Soviet bloc, no longer makes any sense, and Europe is not yet a credible collective partner in the context of a U.S.-dominated globalization. Germany’s emergence as a major political force in East Europe has allowed it to play a role similar to that of France with the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean. This activity has perhaps been motivated by fear of the “Islamic menace” or of waves of immigrants on the Albanian model. Although these fears are largely unfounded, the stability of these Mediterranean countries is necessary to European security as a result of the transnational influences that have been developing for the past twenty years in the fields of economics, culture, and social changes, especially due to south-to-north migrations. The dialogue between the European Union and the Mediterranean region, which is based upon an economic approach, is meant to design a strategy that would compensate for the ruptures that came about during the 1960s. Associating the countries of the south with those of the European Union in a free-trade pact should create the same complementary space as is being created by the ties between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Financial aid given primarily to entrepreneurs should incite others to invest and open up the region to international commerce. Although it would be far from the amount of public and private funds invested in Eastern Europe, an annual influx of 3 billion dollars should help create a secure zone by stimulating economic growth. Europe’s commitment to this path today is no longer limited to that of France and of the Mediterranean countries of Europe. Rather, in order for this choice to be meaningful, Europe must begin to recognize the place that Islam and Muslims occupy in its culture and society. This is the price of becoming a confident partner with the Arab-Muslim world, transcending what would otherwise seem like a simple aid package meant to buy tranquility for the north. As with the construction of the European Union itself, the heart of the European-Mediterranean relationship is culture, and on this level, thanks to parabolic antennas, communities can better relate to each other than states. Will these communities be able to create a confident relationship with each other in a reasonable amount of time, thus allowing the defects of the human and economic exchanges taking place to be overcome?

Ismail Urbain (1812–1884), another of these fascinating Frenchmen linked to the Saint-Simonians, was the principal ideologue to shape Napoleon III’s short-lived and ill-fated “Arab kingdom” policy intended to integrate Algerians better into the French Empire. See Edmund Burke III, “Two Critics of French Rule in Algeria: Ismail Urbain and Frantz Fanon.” Marshal Thomas Robert Bugeaud (1784–1849), the leading general in the French conquest of Algeria and governor-general there from 1841 to 1847, presided over the system that provided for military administration of the native population—the bureaux arabes.

As a result of this sentence, the ambassadors of the European Union left Tehran, and an end was put to the “critical dialogue” with Iran.\n\n19\n\nChapter 1.fm Page 20 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:33 PM\n\nChapter 2.fm Page 21 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:34 PM\n\n2\n\nBritain and the Middle East after 1945 Wm. Roger Louis\n\nAfter World War II, the Middle East formed part of a great British imperial system, with an array of territories that ranged from the crown colony of Cyprus to the mandate of Palestine, to protectorates such as Somaliland, to the protected states in the Gulf such as Kuwait. Just as significant, there were further gradations of domination, an “informal empire” that included states bound to Britain by treaties of alliance such as Iraq and Egypt. In territorial extent the British formal and informal empire in the Middle East extended from Libya in the west to the enclave of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company at Abadan in Iran in the east. Iraq represented the northernmost country, while in the south the Sudan stretched into tropical Africa and was at once an Arab and an African country. The informal empire—territories where the British held sway but had no direct administration—must be included in any analysis of British imperialism because the British themselves regarded units such as Jordan as an integral part of the British world system. Developments in one part of the Middle East would have repercussions elsewhere. The nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company by Muhammad Musaddiq in 1951, for example, influenced Egyptian calculations on the Suez Canal Company and the British base at Suez. Despite major efforts to meet nationalist challenges, the end of the British era came much more rapidly than most contemporaries had anticipated. In a little over two decades, the British empire virtually disintegrated. In 1967, the British decided to withdraw forces east of Suez. After the British departure from the Gulf in 1971, the history of the British in the Middle East became, in one view, mainly an epilogue, with Britain independently yet rather consistently upholding the American position. “The Americans count on us to be reliable and sympathetic, but not sycophantic, allies,” commented the British ambassador in Washington in 1967, in a remark that sums up one version of the story from then onward to the end of the century.1 The other view holds that British imperialism, though diminished and less visible, remains to the present day a vibrant force in the Middle East, above all in the Gulf. There were four stages in the dissolution of the British Middle Eastern empire, stages that the British themselves did not anticipate. The years 1945–1955 mark the first phase leading to dissolution, though the British tried vigorously to reverse the trend. It was the British view after 1945 that the empire would be recreated and reshaped, not liquidated. As a replacement for India, the Middle East along with 21\n\nChapter 2.fm Page 22 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:34 PM\n\nDIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nAfrica and Southeast Asia would be developed economically for the benefit of the indigenous inhabitants as well as the British. The empire after 1945, so went the argument, was in a state of revival and not in the process of decline and collapse. The British would form new alliances with a younger generation of nationalists who demanded reform of the old social order. In the Middle East, the British would, in the phrase of Ernest Bevin, cast their lot with the peasants rather than the pashas. Bevin was foreign secretary in the Labour government from 1945 to 1951, and his influence remains, even today, a source of inspiration. Bevin himself believed, at least initially, that a harmony of interests might be achieved if the British renounced old imperialist ambitions and regarded the Arabs and Iranians as truly equal partners in the effort to develop and defend the Middle East. Anthony Eden, foreign secretary in the Conservative government from 1951 to 1955 and then prime minister from 1955 to 1957, embraced Bevin’s optimistic view that Britain and the peoples of the Middle East might work together in unity. Eden was, however, more skeptical than Bevin about the possibility of aligning Britain’s aims with those of the United States and especially the United Nations. In the end, Eden shifted to the view that Britain’s position in the Middle East could only be maintained by force. Eden is identified with the catastrophe of the Suez crisis in 1956, when the British and French (and Israeli) invasion of Egypt collapsed under the weight of American protest and economic pressure. The single year 1956 forms the second of the four periods. In the third phase, when American power began to eclipse that of the British, Harold Macmillan, prime minister from 1957 to 1963, attempted to salvage Britain’s position in the wake of Suez and the Iraqi revolution of 1958. Macmillan restored Anglo-American relations, which had reached a nadir during the Suez crisis, and he tested the concept that Britain’s new and enduring position might rest on an arc of strategic bases stretching from the Mediterranean to the Pacific. The key point would be the base at Aden. The disintegration of the British position in Aden in 1967—the critical year in the fourth and final stage—ended Britain’s aspiration to remain a regional power in the Middle East, even though the withdrawal from the Gulf did not occur until four years later. The roots of Britain’s postwar dilemmas extended as far back, at least, as the late nineteenth century, to the problems caused by the Egyptian response to the British occupation of Egypt in 1882; the discovery of oil in Persia at the turn of the century and the eventual issue of royalties to the Iranian government; and the creation of the modern Zionist movement—though in the Zionist case the British involvement did not begin directly until 1917, when the Balfour Declaration promised the Jewish people a national home in Palestine and subsequently provoked Arab protest. How were these three interlocking issues of Egypt and the canal, the oil concession at Abadan, and the question of Palestine regarded in 1945?2 Could they be solved or were they essentially problems that could merely be contained? We must not let today’s vantage point distort the view in 1945. The British in the postwar era examined all options, and retreated only after having exhausted all other possibilities. Their failure to sustain Britain’s position in the Middle East makes the story all the more fascinating. 22\n\nChapter 2.fm Page 23 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:34 PM\n\nBRITAIN AND THE MIDDLE EAST AFTER 1945\n\nThe view that the British should withdraw or at least retrench was, in fact, expressed at the time by Prime Minister Attlee, who believed that Britain’s economic and military resources did not permit a sustained presence in the Middle East.3 Attlee anticipated the solution espoused in the late 1950s and 1960s: that the British might be able to maintain a series of strategic bases stretching from Gibraltar to Cyprus to Aden to Singapore, but withdraw from commitments in most of the Middle East, and specifically from “deficit areas” such as Somaliland. Had Attlee’s view prevailed, it might have made the postwar sterling crises less severe and might even have made it possible for Britain to have joined the European Community at an earlier stage. Attlee, however, acquiesced in the postwar consensus forged by Ernest Bevin and the chiefs of staff, who believed that Britain’s status as a “world power” had to be sustained and that the problems of the Middle East could be resolved with skill and tenacity. The leaders of the Conservative Party were of the same opinion. There was a consensus in postwar Britain, in Parliament, and generally among the public that Britain’s historical position in the Middle East must be maintained. The dilemmas posed by Arab, Iranian, and Jewish nationalism might be acute, but they had to be resolved. If driven out of the Middle East by insurgent nationalism, Britain would decline to the status of a third-rate power and would become, in the phrase of the day, another Belgium. Old outlooks die hard, and in 1945 there were remnants of authoritarian and indeed arrogant assumptions of a previous age. The Victorians had believed that Britain led the civilized world not only in trade and commerce but also in the art of government. Lesser breeds (Kipling’s phrase) might, with British and other Western assistance, modernize their economies and progress toward representative government, but they would require a long period of tutelage before they could stand on their own. The most legendary of British proconsuls in Egypt, Sir Evelyn Baring (Lord Cromer), whose tenure stretched from 1883 to 1907, personified many of the British assumptions of the age when he spoke of the “utter incapacity” of the Egyptian “ruling class.”4 As late as the early 1950s, British officials in Egypt continued to draw inspiration from Cromer’s reform of the Egyptian administration, finances, and agriculture. They still believed that the Egyptians were incapable of operating the Suez Canal. Another such proconsul was Sir Miles Lampson (Lord Killearn), who in 1936 had negotiated the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, the basis of Britain’s position in Egypt, that secured the Canal Zone as a military fortress—of its kind, the largest in the world in 1945. Killearn, like Cromer, was an authoritarian figure.5 In 1942 he had with a blatant show of military force presented an ultimatum to the Egyptian king, Faruq, to install a Wafd nationalist regime under Nahas Pasha (who collaborated with the British during the rest of the war) or abdicate. This arrogant demonstration of British power rankled with not only Faruq but also the younger military officers and nationalists, not least Gamal `Abd al-Nasir. Killearn, still ambassador in Egypt in 1945, believed that the Egyptians understood only force, which must remain the basis of the British position in Egypt. It was this attitude that the Labour government after World War II attempted to repudiate. The Labour government pursued a policy of nonintervention as a matter of principle. During the postwar years of Labour rule there was nothing comparable to 23\n\nChapter 2.fm Page 24 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:34 PM\n\nDIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nforcing King Faruq to impose a Wafd government in 1942 or the adventure at Suez in 1956. But the aim was not entirely altruistic; there was an underlying calculation of self-interest. Attlee, Bevin, and their colleagues believed that intervention would undermine rather than sustain British influence in the Middle East. They were reluctant to impose political or economic arrangements that would require British bayonets. That theme runs through Bevin’s minutes. Always having to bear in mind the weakness of the British economy and the scarcity of resources, he knew that the British public would not tolerate prolonged colonial warfare or suppression of nationalist movements. The old attitude of British domination as both necessary and beneficent—an attitude still prevalent in official as well as diehard circles—would have to change. If the British system were to endure, it would have to be dismantled and then reconstructed. The history of the British Empire in the Middle East during the first decade after 1945 can be interpreted as an unsuccessful attempt to convert formal rule and alliances to an informal basis of equal partnership and influence. Here is a paradox: the purpose of this transformation was the perpetuation of Britain as a great “world power.” Nonintervention thus becomes intervention or hegemony by other means.6 Two qualifications need to be made to the Labour government’s commitment to the principle of nonintervention. First, Bevin made a virtue of necessity. Britain was now economically dependent on the United States. The American loan of $3.5 billion to Britain in 1946 had significance for the Middle East and the empire at large, as well as for the British Isles. As with the house that Jack built, the United States propped up the British economy, which in turn enabled the British to prop up a fragile system of imperial control and to maintain the garrison at Suez, which in turn propped up a military, air, and naval network that extended throughout the Middle East. British policy, at least implicitly, had to be generally aligned with American policy if the economic relationship were to remain stable. Thus the British would have to prove willing to come to terms with Middle Eastern nationalism and to abolish the remnants of direct control. The relationship came under severe strain in the case of Palestine, and it snapped, temporarily, in the case of Suez. Otherwise the British skillfully played their hand. They managed to maintain for two decades the sterling area in the Middle East and elsewhere, despite American insistence that the closed economic system be opened up. When the British imperial system came to an end in the mid-1960s, decolonization had marched hand in hand with the dismantling of the sterling area. The second qualification to Labour’s principle of nonintervention, at least in the Middle East, lies in the character of Ernest Bevin. Bevin, the strongest man in the Labour government, had worked his way up in the Transport and General Workers’ Union, and had served in the wartime coalition government as a member of the War Cabinet.7 He was the moving force behind British policy in the Middle East, and was respected not merely for his determined views but also for his grasp of essential issues. Harry S. Truman, who disliked him, once spoke of him as “the embodiment of rugged honesty.” But he had his shortcomings, not least of which was a volcanic temper and an immense reluctance to remain conciliatory once anyone had, in his view, betrayed him. The Zionists as well as the Egyptians, as will be seen, fell into this category, and by 1949 Bevin’s policy of reconciliation was in a shambles. From an Egyptian point of 24\n\nChapter 2.fm Page 25 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:34 PM\n\nBRITAIN AND THE MIDDLE EAST AFTER 1945\n\nview, there was little difference between him and Winston Churchill, and it is legitimate to ask whether there was ultimately any real distinction between Labour and Tory policies in the Middle East.8 Since Churchill’s tenure as prime minister extended from 1951 to 1955 as well as from 1940 to 1945, the question can be answered in comparative detail. Would a Conservative government under Churchill’s leadership have pursued a different course in attempting to resolve the problems of the postwar period? Bevin and Churchill saw eye to eye on many issues, though Churchill would have evacuated Palestine earlier, and he would assuredly have done it with better grace than Bevin. Nevertheless, there were substantial and divisive differences between the Tory and the Labour outlooks, in particular on the questions of the Canal Zone and the refinery at Abadan. Churchill believed that Suez should continue to provide Britain with a commanding bastion in the Middle East regardless of the loss of India, regardless of Egyptian nationalist protest, and regardless of American criticism of “colonialism.” Suez, in his view, remained the keystone of the Middle East and indeed one of the supreme geopolitical positions in the world. He never forgave the Labour government for offering to withdraw British troops from Egypt in the spring of 1946. He also used the word “scuttle” in reference to the evacuation from Abadan in 1951. The differences in Tory and Labour modes of thought were real. The themes of “development” and “collaboration” after 1945 help to explain the general continuity in British thought. Even the late Victorians would have felt at home in a Cabinet meeting in 1950, when Bevin set out the prospects for development in the Middle East and Africa. There were 25 million people in the Egypt and the Sudan, he said, and the water resources of the upper Nile in Uganda might be harnessed “to develop industries in the Nile Valley which would raise the standard of living in peace and provide a valuable industrial potential for war.”9 In the years after 1945, the British would provide technical assistance in projects of agricultural development, irrigation, education, and many other measures of economic and social welfare. Economically the Middle East, together with Africa, offered as alluring a prospect as India had in the past. Militarily the countries of the Middle East could be brought into a system of defense that would help to offset the manpower and military potential of the Soviet Union. Such were the combined political, economic, and military strands of thought that formed a general policy attempting to preserve Britain as a great power; the Middle East was the principal pillar of Britain’s position in the world. The British would secure their economic and military position only if they could find Arab and other leaders willing to cooperate. During World War II, the British for their own purposes had encouraged the creation of the Arab League, which, it had been hoped, would help to unite the Arabs behind the British wartime cause. In the postwar years, British officials sometimes used the phrase “Frankenstein’s monster” to describe this organization partly of their own creation that was at once, in their view, reactionary and fanatically nationalistic. In any event, the British found themselves dependent on what was known as the “old gang” in each of the Arab countries and in the Arab League. The British now pinned their hope on persuading their collaborators to change their ways, while seeking other more moderate and younger nationalists 25\n\nChapter 2.fm Page 26 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:34 PM\n\nDIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nto assist in economic and social development before the initiative passed to the extremists. There were three major crises in the Middle East that the Labour government faced: the problem of Palestine; nationalization of the oil industry in Iran; and the question of British troops in Egypt, which was inseparable from that of the future of the Sudan.10 In Palestine, partition symbolized generally to the British a bankruptcy of policy, the end of the road, and an admission of failure. The British aimed to avert partition and to achieve, in one way or another, a binational state in which there would be religious and political guarantees for both Arabs and Jews. Bevin wanted to create a state in which Arabs and Jews would live and work together as equals. The model of the binational state could be found in Britain’s experience in both Canada and South Africa, though the separate Arab and Jewish units that the British had in mind resembled Swiss cantons. Such a binational state came closer to realization than is commonly remembered. In 1946, a British and American Committee of Inquiry made such a recommendation, but it foundered on President Harry Truman’s unwillingness to give it full support. In April 1946 Truman accepted merely one part of the committee’s report that recommended the admission to Palestine of 100,000 Jewish refugees. He did so unilaterally, without consulting the British prime minister or foreign secretary. The British and Americans were now acrimoniously at loggerheads at a critical time in the development of the Cold War as well as the Palestine conflict. To the British, a false step in Palestine could lead to disaster in the larger areas not only of Anglo-Arab relations but also of American support of the British Empire, the transfer of power in India, and the confrontation with the Soviet Union. The critical period in Palestine was from the summer of 1946 to early 1947. In July 1946, the Jewish terrorist or freedom-fighting group Irgun Zvai Leumi blew up the British military headquarters at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. The explosion at the King David irrevocably changed the public mood in Britain. It caused a powerful impulse to suppress terrorism, but at the same time it strengthened the view that the British should withdraw because of Jewish ingratitude. The British chiefs of staff held that, if Britain was compelled to choose between Arabs and Zionists, the overriding priority would be the need to preserve Arab goodwill. The decisions made at this time took place against the background of the great emotional debate on India, a sense of impending economic disaster, and one of the worst winters and fuel shortages in British history. It was not an easy time for the Labour government, or for the British people. The two men making the critical decisions on cutting losses were Bevin and Attlee. When the two of them agreed in December 1946 that British troops should be withdrawn from Greece, Attlee aimed at economic and military retrenchment. Bevin also regarded the crisis in the eastern Mediterranean as an economic and military emergency, but beyond that he saw it as an opportunity to win American commitment to a northern tier stretching across Turkey, Iraq, and Iran that would provide a shield against Soviet penetration of the Middle East and Africa. In late 1946, Attlee and Bevin agreed not only on the question of withdrawal of British troops from Greece but 26\n\nChapter 2.fm Page 27 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:34 PM\n\nBRITAIN AND THE MIDDLE EAST AFTER 1945\n\nalso on the issue of submitting the Palestine problem to the United Nations. The key to their thought on the latter problem was that they did not want the British to be held responsible in Arab eyes for a policy of partition. Having presided over deadlock between the Zionists and Arabs, the British now moved to the United Nations in the hope that there would be a better chance that the Arab side would prevail. The British would thus continue to pursue the goal of a binational state, but in the international arena. In the last resort they hoped to avoid the stigma of presiding over partition. The United Nations strategy was a miscalculation. In the summer of 1947, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (Unscop) visited Palestine.11 British troops and other personnel were bivouacked behind barbed wire in “Bevingrads,” in the center of Jerusalem and elsewhere. One-tenth of the armed forces of the entire British Empire now occupied Palestine, a territory the size of Wales. The majority of the members of Unscop voted in favor of partition, which triggered the British decision in September 1947 to evacuate. Against a background of economic anxiety, the decision was made during the crisis over the convertibility of sterling. To the British, Palestine was a small place but a major source of despair. After September 1947, British influence on the Palestine issue diminished. In November, the U.N. General Assembly endorsed partition. According to a British official reporting from New York, American newspapers had built up the fever of excitement to the extent that opponents of partition were regarded as enemies of the American people. The British stayed on until the expiration of the mandate on May 14–15, 1948, but they conducted a rearguard action. They had lost the initiative. The paramount aim remained to keep on good terms with the Americans as well as the Arabs, but the British could not do so as long as the issue of partition continued to poison the atmosphere. Arab nationalism, frustrated in Palestine, could not be appeased. It was the American failure, in British eyes, to curb militant Zionism that went to the heart of the trouble. In the course of the 1948 war, Bevin remarked that the Middle East was “sinking into chaos.” The British at this time believed that Israel might become a communist state, if not a Soviet satellite, and that the Middle East was on the verge of revolution. “Another China,” was the phrase Bevin used on several occasions to sum up his dire premonition about the Middle East. This was clearly an exaggeration, but it was in line with the general British view of the Middle East in the late 1940s. It is ironic that the British perceived a communist threat in Israel while in most of the Middle East they believed that the Americans exaggerated the dangers of Soviet penetration or communist takeovers. On Iran, the American and British governments held divergent views, but, on the whole, they agreed that the regime of Muhammad Musaddiq might deteriorate into a revolutionary situation resulting in a communist regime or possibly a Soviet satellite.12 Musaddiq had an inveterate mistrust of the British. No one who listened to his animated conversation could doubt that he actually believed the British to be responsible for the poverty and general malaise of Iran. Musaddiq himself was a scion of a wealthy Iranian landowning family. Born in 1882, he had first been elected to the Majlis, or Iranian parliament, in 1924. He consistently denounced British attempts to subjugate Iran, in his view, through the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.) in Abadan and the British embassy in Tehran. After becoming prime minister in 1951, 27\n\nChapter 2.fm Page 28 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:34 PM\n\nDIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nMusaddiq achieved his major aim, the nationalization of A.I.O.C. in the same year.13 Musaddiq acknowledged that the company was entitled to compensation, but he disagreed with the British on a fundamental point. He held that the foundation of the British position in Iran, the concession agreement of 1933, was both illegal and immoral. In this respect Musaddiq was the forerunner of a later generation of Asian and African nationalists who believed that the Western powers had no right to impose a system of capitalist exploitation. There lingered in Britain, on the other hand, the view that the Iranians had no real right to their own oil because its discovery and development were entirely due to British enterprise. The controversy raised a basic issue for the British, one they could not afford to concede: If Musaddiq’s view prevailed, especially on the invalidity of the 1933 concession, then nationalists throughout the world could abrogate British concessions with impunity. The problem was clearly stated by the minister for defense in the Labour government, Emmanuel Shinwell, in May 1951: “Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries would be encouraged to think they could try things on: the next thing might be an attempt to nationalise the Suez Canal.”14 The decision to intervene in Iran by covert operations was taken by the Conservative government after the election in late 1951 that brought the return of Winston Churchill as prime minister and Anthony Eden as foreign secretary. The Labour government, despite jingoistic sentiment on the part of Herbert Morrison, Bevin’s successor as foreign secretary in early 1951, had held firm against military intervention. Attlee decided to keep British policy in line with that of the United States and the United Nations. The prime minister thus upheld a principle championed by Ernest Bevin, who had believed that Britain should use great restraint in interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, not least in Iran. This was a consistent attitude, as can be demonstrated in other places in the Middle East since 1945, above all in Egypt. Attlee and Bevin, however, never indicated that they would refuse categorically to support a policy of intervention. What can be established with certainty is that they persistently checked permanent officials from pursuing a more active or interventionist policy. One cannot say that without exception the Labour government stood in principle against covert operations. It was the Labour foreign secretary, Herbert Morrison, who gave instructions to plan for the overthrow of Musaddiq. In general, however, Attlee and Bevin believed that intervention would lead to unanticipated and undesirable consequences. The Labour government, in short, demonstrated restraint in not taking action against Musaddiq, as did the Truman administration in which Dean Acheson as secretary of state held views that independently coincided with Bevin’s. The new Conservative government quickly indicated a much greater willingness to follow an interventionist course. Churchill and Eden worked in concert with the new Eisenhower administration, which included the two Dulles brothers, John Foster as secretary of state and Allen as director of the C.I.A. The early 1950s saw a sea change in the range and nature of covert operations in the Middle East and elsewhere.15 The critical month was August 1953. The intelligence agencies of Britain and the United States cooperated in an intervention that led to the fall of the Musaddiq government. The Central Intelligence Agency played a vital part in this venture and, 28\n\nChapter 2.fm Page 29 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:34 PM\n\nBRITAIN AND THE MIDDLE EAST AFTER 1945\n\nin so doing, eventually established a reputation in Iran as the instrument of Western intervention responsible for the continued rule of the shah. This was a complex operation, its origins and planning mainly British but with vital American financial assistance and with the contribution of a flamboyant and effective intelligence officer, Kermit Roosevelt, who played a key role in its success. On the British side there are two figures useful to identify. The first is C. M. Woodhouse, who had fought with the Greek resistance during the war, became a colonel at the age of twenty-seven, and was later Conservative M.P. for Oxford and still later director of the Institute for International Affairs at Chatham House. In 1951–1952 he headed MI6 in Iran. He deemed joint action by Britain and the United States necessary to prevent the Red Army from marching southward and forging a satellite state in Iran on the model of eastern Europe. Against the background of the Greek civil war, the danger, as he saw it, was that of an internal communist takeover that would provide the opportunity for the Soviets.16 This was also the American view, held both by the American embassy in Tehran and by the C.I.A. Woodhouse was responsible for the planning and for the initial liaison with the C.I.A. At the highest level, the other person was Churchill, who himself, during a time when Eden was ill, took the initiative in approving the plan to topple Musaddiq. The British as well as the Americans bear some responsibility for the post-August 1953 course of Iranian history, but it was at this time that, in Iranian demonology, the United States began to eclipse Britain as “the Great Satan.” The C.I.A. has lingered on in the public consciousness in Iran as the symbol of foreign intervention. For the British the legacy is more difficult to assess, but perhaps nations, like individuals, cannot be manipulated without a sense on the part of the aggrieved that old scores must eventually be settled. That was certainly Bevin’s view. By 1953, however, the British had become convinced that Musaddiq had to be removed. The outcome seemed to demonstrate that the countries of the Middle East could still be coerced or indirectly controlled. The success of the 1953 operation encouraged Anthony Eden to believe that military action against Egypt in 1956 might also be a success. This leads to the Suez crisis. The problem of the canal and Egypt must be seen from the perspective of Britain’s position in Egypt after 1945, the legacy of the Labour government, and Eden’s general line of conciliation until close to the time of the Suez crisis itself. The course of action pursued by Eden during the crisis was, as will be seen, very much an aberration for both himself and the course the British had consistently charted since 1945. The Conservative government under Churchill and Eden had inherited from the Labour government the problems of the Egyptian unilateral abrogation of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in October 1951 and guerrilla warfare in the Canal Zone. On “Black Saturday” in late January 1952, mobs swept through Cairo killing, looting, and destroying the symbol of the British occupation, Shepheard’s Hotel. Churchill wrote: “The horrible behaviour of the mob puts them lower than the most degraded savages now known… . I doubt whether any relationship is possible with them. They cannot be classed as a civilized power until they have purged themselves.”17 The overthrow of Faruq and the ascendancy of the Egyptian army officers in July 1952 seemed to mark 29\n\nChapter 2.fm Page 30 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:34 PM\n\nDIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nthe development of such a purge. The young military officers might not be experienced, and they might harbor anti-British sentiment, but, from the British viewpoint, almost anything was better than the old corrupt regime under Faruq. The British came quickly to believe that Gamal `Abd al-Nasir was the moving force of the revolution. They judged that Nasir wanted to come to an agreement on the Canal Zone in order to move ahead with economic reconstruction and social reform, and that the dispute over troops in the Canal Zone prevented him from devoting his full concentration to domestic priorities. The British calculated that Nasir would be the best chance, perhaps the last, to reach a lasting reconciliation. According to a key British minute, the opportunity should be seized “to consolidate his [Nasir’s] position… . it looks as though he is our best bet.”18 Both the British and the Egyptians made genuine concessions to reach agreement on the evacuation of British troops from the Canal Zone in 1954.19 Anthony Eden played a prominent role in the conciliatory tactics that led to temporary reconciliation with Egypt. Though Eden himself was ill for part of this period, and the approach to the Egyptians was very much a collective or team effort, this was an achievement by Eden that must be borne in mind in view of what happened in 1956. Eden was assisted by the 5th Marquess of Salisbury, an experienced statesman who had served as dominions secretary in the wartime coalition, and General Sir Brian Robertson, the commander of British Land Forces in the Middle East, who helped to persuade his fellow military officers that it would be wise to redeploy troops in the Middle East rather than concentrate them at Suez. Robertson’s underlying rationale was that nuclear weapons had rendered the Suez base obsolete. In exchange for troop withdrawal, the British would have the right to return in the event of a general war. The withdrawal would be gradual and would take place over a two-year period. Robertson, along with Eden, wooed Churchill away from a diehard position. The British hoped that this would be a permanent settlement that would enable them, in turn, to resolve the Arab-Israeli problem and to create a line of defense in the Middle East along the northern tier. Eden is often held responsible for the Suez venture, but it was in fact a collective operation with collective responsibility. Eden put his own reputation at risk. Once regarded as the champion of anti-appeasement of Hitler, he now appeared to the hard right of the Tory party as the arch-appeaser of Nasir. By evacuating troops from the Canal Zone, Eden seemed to be sounding an imperial retreat. He himself believed such criticism to be a caricature of his position, but in comparison with Churchill he did have progressive views. During the Suez crisis Eden responded with anger to the American accusation that old-fashioned colonialism motivated him. “It was I who ended the ‘so-called colonialism’ in Egypt,” he exclaimed.20 The Suez crisis had its immediate origins in late 1955, when Nasir accepted military assistance from the Soviet Union via Czechoslovakia.21 By introducing the Soviet Union as a major contender for regional hegemony, Nasir altered the existing balance of power in the Middle East. The Czech arms deal liberated Nasir from the Anglo-American embrace. In consequence John Foster Dulles first orchestrated an Anglo-American–World Bank offer to help build the Aswan High Dam and later abruptly withdrew it. This directly sparked Nasir’s decision to nationalize the Suez 30\n\nChapter 2.fm Page 31 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:34 PM\n\nBRITAIN AND THE MIDDLE EAST AFTER 1945\n\nCanal Company on July 26, 1956. Eden now attempted to prove that he could rise to the occasion in the tradition of Churchill, but he had a higher aim as well: Britain would demonstrate that it remained the preeminent regional power in the Middle East and, moreover, a world power that could act, if necessary, independently from the United States. The British prepared for the invasion of Egypt as if they were about to engage German Panzer units in World War II. With more effective and more daring planning, and without the fatal misjudgment about the United States, the military operations in November 1956 might have been a success. Nasir might have been toppled, a more friendly regime in Cairo might have been installed, and the life of the British Empire might have been extended. But it is just as possible that the British might have turned the clock back to 1882 and poisoned sentiment throughout the colonial world, not merely against Britain and France but against the United States as well. In any event, Eden and Harold Macmillan, the chancellor of the exchequer, did indeed make a monumental miscalculation. Eisenhower and John Foster Dulles believed that a British and French invasion would provoke a far-reaching anti-Western reaction. Most irritating to the Americans was the lack of consultation. Eden and Macmillan, as well as other members of the Cabinet, generally thought that the Americans did not want to know about the plans and would acquiesce in a successful operation. There is some evidence that this was true for Dulles but certainly not for Eisenhower, who was outraged. The Eisenhower administration waged virtual economic warfare against the British, forcing them and also the French and the Israelis to withdraw. It was Eden, not Nasir, who was toppled. The Suez venture demonstrated the dependence of Britain on the United States. Suez made it plain for all to see that Britain was doomed both as a colonial power and as a world power unless it acted in concert with the United States. There was a psychological dimension to the trauma of Suez that has a bearing on subsequent events in the Middle East. Sir Charles Johnston, the governor of Aden, wrote: “One of the worst things that has happened to us … particularly since Suez, is that in the Middle East we have lost confidence in our ability to deal with situations. The loss of confidence is a very odd thing—it is something which has happened inside ourselves, and bears no particular relation to the facts as observed in the field. Our Suez fiasco seems, in effect, to have left a far deeper mark on ourselves than on the Arabs.”22 Britain had not lost the will or the capacity to deal with colonial insurgency, as would later be proved in places such as Kenya and Malaysia. It had lost the pretense of being a superpower. Over four decades later, it is still worth reflecting why Suez was so seminal an event and why it so bitterly divided the British people. Part of the explanation is that it split the nation because many believed that Britain should continue to champion the cause of the United Nations and should work in harmony with the United States, while others believed that the issue of security and the prestige of the British Empire overrode other commitments and, moreover, that the United States was aiming to dislodge Britain from the Middle East. These conflicting ideas were apparent in the mind of Lord Salisbury, who had helped to create the United Nations at San Francisco in 1945 31\n\nChapter 2.fm Page 32 Tuesday, February 13, 2001 1:34 PM\n\nDIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nand who was Anthony Eden’s principal source of strength within the British Cabinet. When Salisbury decided in November 1956 that he could not in good conscience support the government in opposition to the United Nations, Eden himself began to waver and then collapsed. There was a failure of British nerve at the highest level. There was also deception, and this perhaps is the most significant legacy. Even at the time of the crisis there was a general sense that the government, and Eden in particular, had deceived Parliament and the public. Eden became the scapegoat for a failed policy, but his ideas were representative of, and his policies accepted by, members of the Cabinet.23 Eden was not a great man, and, for temperamental reasons alone, he probably should never have become prime minister. But he was representative of his age. He believed, as did many of his countrymen, that the British Empire would continue to survive as a Commonwealth, and that Britain would remain a world power. Suez was very much a collective enterprise. Many in the British government and in the country believed that the United States was attempting to dislodge Britain from the Middle East. This was a misapprehension, but sometimes the psychological dimension of"
