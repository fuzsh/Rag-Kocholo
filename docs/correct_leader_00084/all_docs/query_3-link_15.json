        "text": "From the context of the Islamic Cold War between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, this thesis examines the diffusion of Salafi and Shia doctrines to Sub- Saharan Africa through case studies of Lagos and Cape Town. It is my hypothesis that the Islamic Cold War and the Saudi-Iranian struggle for regional hegemony – a dynamic I define as a soft power supremacy dilemma – can partly explain the diffusion of religious doctrine and the emergence of Salafism and Shiism south of Sahara. To assess the explanatory prowess of this hypothesis and to understand the development of Islamic doctrine in Sub-Saharan African, I seek to provide answers for three interrelated questions: (1) to what extent are the religious discourses of Saudi Arabia and Iran diffused to Lagos and Cape Town and how can such diffusion be interpreted in the context of an Islamic Cold War and their struggle for regional power?, (2) at what level of interaction and through which types of actors is religious diffusion occurring?, and (3) what is the reciprocal influence of Salafi and Shia doctrines in the local environments of Lagos and Cape Town? To answer these questions, I apply a methodological framework, which takes it inspiration from French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu’s conceptualisation of social fields as an interpretative grid open for analysis. This framework helps identify intra-field contestation for religious authority and thus enables analysis of field dynamics and transformation. The main foundation of empirical data in constituted by first-hand interviews and observations conducted during two months of fieldwork in Lagos and Cape Town, respectively. Having studied and interacted with Islamic culture and having held several meetings with Salafis and Shias in Lagos and Cape Town, the thesis presents three broad conclusions; first, since the 1960s-70s, both Lagos and Cape Town have experienced increased pluralism within the Islamic field affecting the structures of the field. Islam in Sub-Saharan Africa has traditionally been equated with prominent Sufi brotherhoods and moderate and tolerant religious interpretation, but the emergence of several new doctrines is challenging Sufism’s monopolisation of Islamic discourse. New actors – Salafis in particular – have to a great extent succeeded in transforming both doctrine and discourse by emphasising the importance of religious knowledge. Second, the emergence of new doctrines has led to a radicalisation of Islamic discourse with the dual objective of consolidation and condemnation. The debate focuses on issues such as ‘what constitutes religious knowledge’ and ‘what true Islam is’ resulting in reciprocal accusations of heresy and bid’a and leading to what could be defined an Islamic revivalism. Third, the emergence of Salafism and Shiism in Lagos and Cape Town is a result of interaction with Saudi and Iranian actors and institutions. Primarily occurring through educational institutions, this diffusion can be attributed to the Islamic Cold War and its inherent logic. I argue that Saudi and Iranian diffusion has been paramount to the emergence of new doctrines, but that it is inadequate to understand the further development of Salafi and Shia doctrine within the local environments of Lagos and Cape Town.\n\nResulting from ancient pilgrimage networks and the outcome of the Patani Kingdom’s decline in the eighteenth century, the Patani community from Southern Thailand has had a longstanding presence in Islam’s Holy City. This community grew and became particularly well established in the aftermath of the discovery of oil in twentieth century Saudi Arabia. Currently, there are more than 200 Patani families in Mecca’s Ajyad district alone. Historically, Patani Muslims are Sufi and Shafiʿi in their religious orientation. This thesis will examine the interrelation between Islamic modes of reasoning and the social, cultural and political contexts in which these modes of reasoning occur. It will look at the intergenerational transformation of religious practice among Patani-Meccans from the 1950s to the 2010s. It will show how the practices and beliefs of first generation Patanis are being challenged by the new generations born and socialized in Saudi Arabia. Drawing on fieldwork and interviews, it argues that each generation developed distinctive strategies to reconcile the Salafi-Wahhabi Saudi context. Additionally, it argues that the social meaning of statements or arguments about the Islamic tradition has new meanings for each generation because they are made in a specific context throughout the three generations.\n\nFollowers of Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn 'Abdalwahhab, today are also presented in Tatarstan, which in turn affects in a certain way on the religious situation in the region. The purpose of this article is to identify and analyze patterns of outstanding Salafi doctrinal literature in modern Tatarstan. The leading approach to the study of this problem is a systematic and comparative analysis which allows to carry out islamic study on the topic. In this article the concept of \"Salafis,\" is revealed, the Salafi Muslims categories, their theological differences with the traditional Muslim sects, the analysis of the Islamic Salafi doctrinal literature authors, published in today's Tatarstan are described. The results presented in the article indicate wide circulation of Salafi literature in Tatarstan in recent years, various types of such literature, and how its content is contrary to the theological tradition of the local Hanafi Muslim. The article may be useful in the study of the religious situation in the regions of Russia at the moment.\n\nThis article discusses the genesis of Boko Haram as an offshoot of the Nigerian Salafi movement. In particular, it looks at the ambivalent relationship between Boko Haram's first leader Muhammad Yusuf and the leaders of the mainstream Salafi group Ahlus Sunna. Using as a starting point Quintan Wiktorowicz's threefold model of purist (or quietist), politico and jihadi Salafis, the article challenges the conclusion of two recent publications, which tend to see Boko Haram and Ahlus Sunna in terms of, respectively, jihadi and quietist Salafis. While agreeing that the rift between the two Nigerian groups reflects global Salafi debates, the article advances two critical arguments and one hypothesis. The first argument is that in terms of their political theology, the positions of quietist and jihadi Salafis are virtually identical, the differences between the two being contextual and volatile. Of the three categories identified by Wiktorowicz, only the politicos contain the germs of an alternative Salafi political theology. The second argument is that the War on Terror, encouraging the Saudi policy of promoting the exclusivist political theology of quietist Salafis in order to counter the jihadis, has created a context in which the politicos have been isolated and paradoxically a new, more extreme generation of jihadis like Yusuf (and, in the Middle east, ISIS) has been empowered. Finally the hypothesis, is that the rift between the Ahlus Sunna leaders and Yusuf was a consequence of the initial collaboration of the former in establishing a jihadi camp in Nigeria, followed by their decision to collaborate with the authorities in dismantling it.\n\nIn contemporary academic literature, the word “Salafī” has a variety of meanings. Most importantly, Western academic literature of the 20th and 21st centuries applies the word to (1) an Islamic reform movement founded by Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī (d. 1897) and Muḥammad ʿAbduh (1849–1905) in the last decades of the 19th century and (2) to contemporary Sunni reform movements that criticize manifestations of Sunni Islam which are based on Sufism, Ashʿarism, and traditional madhhab-affiliations to the Shāfiʿī, Ḥanafī, and Mālikī schools. In a 2010-article Henri Lauzière argued that the use of the word “Salafī” to describe these two movements is an equivocation based on a mistake. While the movement of contemporary Salafīs may be rightfully called by that name, al-Afghānī and ʿAbduh never used the term. Only Western scholars of the 1920s and 30s, most importantly Louis Massignon (1883–1962), called this latter movement “salafī”. This paper reevaluates the evidence presented by Lauzière and argues that Massignon did not make a mistake. The paper describes analytically both reform movements and draws the conclusion that there is a historic continuity that justifies calling them both “salafī”. The paper draws an analogy from the use of the word “socialist” in European political history, which first applied to a wider movement of the late 19th century before its use was contested and narrowed down in the course of the 20th."
