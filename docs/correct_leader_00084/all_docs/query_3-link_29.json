        "text": "This book delves into the physical public spaces of communication, majālis in East Arabia and their equivalents, digitally mediated cyber spaces. All are transformative spaces wherein Arabian social groups (Arabs from the Arabian Peninsula) regularly interact, listen to one another, discuss diverse topics, communicate traditional and modern knowledge, and question or circulate ideas. These social groups communicate multi-layered information and codes of meaning that inhabit every aspect of Arabian daily life. Those who dominate these two participative spaces of interaction have the ability to communicate particular knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, heritage, ideologies, norms, and values. Islamic religious ways of thinking abound in these public spaces and some can find preference to deconstruct or reconnect segmented communities. The book attempts to apprehend some of the cultural, social, and political changes rapidly shaping two predominant, religious clusters of contemporary Sunnī Islam in Eastern Arabia: the ‘Sufis’ (traditional Sunnī Muslims), and the ‘Salafis’ (Wahhabi Sunnī Muslims). Furthermore, by focusing on the micro cultural foundation that regulates the unification or fragmentation dynamics between a Sufi master or a Salafi shaykh and his respective disciples, this book reveals new information on how in-group micro-life is co-created before it manifests at the macro social level. The book captures cognitive identity as part of the public religious discourse in terms of fiqh (religious reasoning) or madhhab (school of religious reasoning), each distinctively tenting Sufi or Salafi clusters with different identity markers. Due to the discursive nature of fiqh, exposure to group discourses and counter-discourses is essential in order to gain insight into the process of constructing cognitive religious identity. In portraying public cognitive religious reasoning as a main identity marker, the book reveals how cognitive identity re-manifests itself in the realms of attires, melodies, and digitally-mediated-Islam. By using an interdisciplinary framework, employing different disciplines and approaches, the book will be of specific interest to students and scholars of Islam, Communication, New Media, Ethnology, Anthropology, Religion, Heritage, Identity, as well as Middle East Studies."
