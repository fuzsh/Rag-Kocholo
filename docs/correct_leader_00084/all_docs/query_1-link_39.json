        "text": "For a Biography Summery, please click here\n\nTHE RISE\n\nThe Grand Shia Islamic Authority and Jurist, Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi is born on January 8, 1942 in the holy city of Karbala, in Iraq into a family of outstanding history and position in the Islamic sciences and leadership. The Grand Jurist was named Sadiq after the sixth Shia Imam, with the hopes of treading in the path of protecting moralities, justice, and the genuine culture of the Islam, presented by the holy Prophet of Islam and his pure Household. These hopes came true years later, as the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi dedicated his entire lifetime to serving the genuine Islam, the holy Quran, and the culture of the holy Prophet of Islam and his Household.\n\nFATHER\n\nGrand Ayatollah Sayyid Mahdi Shirazi, the father of the Grand Jurist was a widely respected and accredited religious authority of his time.\n\nBorn in 1887 in the holy city of Karbala, the Grand Jurist’s father had to suffer the loss of his father, Sayyid Mirza Habibullah Shirazi at the young age of 16, in the year 1903. Since then, he enjoyed the supports of his mother and his elder brother, Sayyid Abdullah. The Grand Jurist’s father studied the Arabic literature and the preliminary stages of Islamic sciences in the Islamic Seminary of holy Karbala; then, he made a long journey to the cities of Samarra and Kadhimiya, and after a short stay in holy Karbala, he left his hometown for the holy city of Najaf, where he continued his studies for the next 20 years. Finally, the late Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Mahdi Shirazi returned to holy Karbala and lived the rest of his life in this city.\n\nThe late Grand Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi had the honor to study under many great names in the contemporary history of Shia Islam, such as Sheikh Muhammad Taqi Shirazi, Mirza Ali Shirazi, Haji Rida Hamedani, Sayyid Kazim Tabatabaei, and Akhund Khorasani. Meanwhile, the father of the Grand Jurist along with many acclaimed Shia scholars and religious authorities such as Sayyid Muhammad Hadi Milani, Haji Sheikh Muhammad Rida Isfahani, Sayyid Zainul Abedin Kashani, and Sheikh Kazim Shirazi used to take part in the scientific courses directed by the senior Shia scholar of the time, Grand Jurist Haji Husayn Qomi.\n\nIslamic Leadership\n\nIn the years following 1946, after the death of two great Shia Jurists, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Abul Hasan Isfahani and Grand Ayatollah Haji Husayn Qomi, more and more people referred their religious matters to the prominent Grand Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi. This popularity among different groups of people came along with words of admiration from the many religious scholars and jurists who predicted that the Grand Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi will succeed the Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Husayn Borujerdi, as the next Shia leading Marja and Jurist.\n\nHowever, Grand Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi passed away on February 15, 1961, only forty five days before the sad departure of the leading Shia Marja, Grand Ayatollah Borujerdi.\n\nThe Four Lights\n\nThe late Haji Rida Fedayi, a pious and sincere eulogist in the holy city of Karbala narrates:\n\nOn the day, when the Grand Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi passed away; the entire city of Karbala grieved the death of the late Ayatollah. It was like that even the sun mourns this loss, since there was a solar eclipse upon his death. The departure of the late Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi struck the people with a deep feeling of grief, because the people admired the Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi for his fatherly love and his honest and steadfast services to the public. On that night, I had a dream of a light ascending to the sky. When I looked more precise, I could see Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi in the midst of that light. Then, I screamed out of pain and said: “What a big loss!” Suddenly, I heard a voice that told me: “True. You have lost a shining light, but this light has left you four other lights instead, so treasure them.” The four lights that the Grand Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi left us were his four sons, one of whom is the current religious Authority and Jurist, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi.\n\nThe Four Mahdis\n\nAt the funeral ceremony of the late Grand Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi, when the late Grand Ayatollah Mohsen Hakim watched the impatient and grief-stricken mourning of the pubic, he asked them to calm down and then he said:\n\nToday, we lost one Mahdi, but remember that our beloved Mahdi has left us four other Mahdis.\n\nPolitical Activities\n\nThe late Grand Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi had an active role in the following social and political movements:\n\nThe revolution of 1920 in Iraq which was led by his uncle, late Grand Ayatollah Mirza Muhammad Taqi Shirazi\n\nThe uprising of the late Grand Ayatollah Qomi, who traveled to Iran in order to make sure the religious activism and rituals will be legalized in Iran’s legislative bodies.\n\nThe issue of a religious command against the communists, who wanted to trigger a war in Iraq.\n\nFighting apostasy and heresy by holding ceremonies to celebrate the birthday anniversary of the Commander of the Faithful, Imam Ali, peace be upon him, in the holy city of Karbala. Years later, these celebrations spread out to other cities in Iraq, including holy Najaf, Hillah, Baghdad, and Samarra.\n\nBooks and Publications\n\nAn unfinished commentary on the famous book of “Urwatul Wuthqa”\n\nCommentaries on the principles of Islamic jurisprudence\n\nA commentary on a book of jurisprudence written by Imam Rida (PBUH)\n\nA collection of notes on different sciences\n\nA collection of important prayers and supplications, “Al-Da’awatul Mujarrabat”\n\n??\n\nA Memory of My Father\n\nMy dear father was an early riser and it was only one of his many good habits. I don’t recall even a day to have seen my father sleeping late. This was, in fact, a lesson that his mother taught him and he used to say that his mother was also an early riser. In the midst of the nights, his mother used to wake my father up to watch her do the prayers of the night. She used to give my father a handful of snacks so that her five-year-old son could stay awake and watch her mother praying. She wanted to teach her son to be an early riser. In the meantime, she never wanted to force her son into staying awake, so she gave him some snacks as a means of encouragement.\n\nHe always woke up before the morning call for prayers. Even in his final years, when he was severely ill and couldn’t sleep at night, my father took a short nap an hour before the morning prayers and again, he woke up before the morning call for prayers. He had developed this habit to stay awake in that early time of the morning, although he was feeling ill. The signs of his habit to stay vigilant at nights were evident in his tender and considerate behaviors.\n\nNote: this story is quoted by Grand Jurist, Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi.\n\nGrand Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi Visiting Imam Mahdi (PBUH)\n\nOnce, a senior scholar who was a close friend of my father said:\n\n“On each Friday night, Grand Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi used to go to the rooftop of his house and plead the helps and attentions of Imam Mahdi, may he reappear soon.”\n\nAs we are informed, our late father had the honor to meet Imam Mahdi, may he reappear soon, for three times. The first meeting took place in the sacred cellar, where Imam Mahdi had disappeared. The second meeting was in the holy city of Najaf, near the sacred tomb of prophet Hud and prophet Saleh. The last meeting, again, took place in the sacred cellar, where the first meeting happened. We were never informed of the details of these meetings, but we were just informed that my father had met Imam Mahdi in that cellar. My father never spoke to us about any of these meetings at all.\n\nThat senior scholar narrated the story of the meeting between my father and Imam Mahdi in these words:\n\nDuring his stay in the holy city of Samarra, the late Grand Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi used to visit the sacred cellar on each Friday night. He used to read Quran and pray all alone during the night until the morning. Then, he left the cellar after reading the prayer of Nudba. During those nights, there were no other people in that cellar; so the Grand Ayatollah told me that when he visited the sacred cellar, he locked the door from inside so that nobody could disturb him, while praying.\n\n“In one of those Friday mornings, while I had the door locked from inside, I was busy reading the prayer of Nudba. Then, I read this sentence from the prayer that said “you ascended his soul to the skies”. Suddenly, I noticed someone sitting beside me. He pointed to me and corrected me, saying “you ascended him to the skies.” I corrected myself and resumed reading the prayer, while I had totally missed the odd point of the man who sat next to me. A few moments later, suddenly I asked myself: Oh God. Who is the man sitting next to me? How did he enter the cellar? I had locked the door from inside and I was sure no one could come into the cellar.\n\nAll these thoughts thundered my brain and I started quivering. I could clearly hear my heart beating and I hardly could look back to where that person was sitting, but he was not there anymore. I looked for him into the cellar and I didn’t find him. I was made certain that he was our master, Imam Mahdi, may he reappear soon.”\n\nMOTHER\n\nThe mother of the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi, and the wife of the late Grand Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi was the daughter of Sayyid Abd Al-Sahib, and a granddaughter of the Great Mirza Shirazi. This respectful lady passed away on June 28, 1976 on her seventies.\n\nThe Grand Jurist’s mother was known for her deep insight and virtuous conducts. She was an inspiration to her children who dedicated her life to preserve the genuine Islamic morals and observe the acts of worship in all stages of her life.\n\nEvery day, she was committed to soften her heart by shedding tears and remembering the tragic martyrdom of Imam Husayn, peace be upon him. The late Grand Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi used to read the events of Ashura Day from the famous book of “Jala Al-Uyun” for her wife.\n\nUpbringing Children\n\nAs an exemplary lady and self-giving mother, the Grand Jurist’s mother was deeply keen and solemn to bring up her children to serve the sublime culture of the Prophet of Islam and his pure Household in the future. The history’s judgment can obviously show us that she was successful as each of her children became known as great scholars and protectors of the genuine Islamic teachings.\n\nThe late Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi clarified on her mother’s upbringing methods in these words:\n\n“My dear mother, may she rest in peace, woke me up every night, before the sunrise and taught me how to humbly make my prayers to the Lord. As a young boy, I was at times so sleepy that I couldn’t walk, but she always was kind and caring to me and taught me to get used to staying vigilant at nights.”\n\nShe had six sons with the names of Muhammad, Ali, Hasan, Husayn, Sadiq, Mujtaba, and seven daughters. Sadly, two of her sons, Ali and Husayn, and one of her daughters died at a young age.\n\nTHE LINEAGE OF THE SHIRAZI FAMILY\n\nThe Commander of the Faithful, Imam Ali, peace be upon him, has said:\n\n“Indeed, the friends of God are those people who look at this world and see its inside, while the rest of people are amused by its appealing appearance. They look forward to the afterlife while the rest of people are pleased with this petty life. Quran is made known by them, and they are known by Quran; the book of God is upheld by them and they are strengthened by the book of God. They don’t see more that they hope for and they don’t fear except for what they must.”\n\nAll these qualities and characteristics can best describe the noble and great family of the Shirazi. They are the family who have preserved the light of true knowledge, piety, morals, virtue, resolution, tenacity and service to the genuine Islam and the holy Quran in our disturbed time.\n\nA noble family with strong and deep roots …\n\n“a blessed tree which has firm roots and branches rising up into the sky”\n\nChapter 14, Verse 24, Holy Quran\n\nThe Islamic Authority and Jurist, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi is a descendant of the Commander of the Faithful, Imam Ali. He is brought up in a family, known for their strong commitment and dedication in leading the Shia Muslims and their expertise in the Islamic Jurisdiction in the last century and a half.

He was one of the best students of his uncle, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi.\n\n***\n\nThe Grand Islamic Authority and Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi was born and raised in a family, renowned for their long-time stance in protecting the Islamic values against its enemies.\n\n*******************\n\nThe Rise of another Scholar from the Family of Shirazi\n\nTHE BEGINNING OF ISLAMIC STUDIES\n\nLike the rest of his family members, the Grand Islamic Authority Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi began studying the basics of Islamic sciences and jurisdiction at his childhood, under the supervision of his late father, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Mahdi Shirazi. As a young boy, the Grand Jurist learned about the genuine Islam and the culture of the Prophet and his pure Household and established his strong resolution to step in the path of serving the faith, in the holy city of Karbala in Iraq.\n\nSince his childhood, the Grand Jurist was well observant to establish a deep perception and authentic understanding of the Islamic morals and virtues. He maintained his focus on memorizing the holy Quran and learning the sublime culture of the Prophet and his Household and in this way, he remained faithful to the famous hadith by the holy Prophet of Islam who invited the people to stick with the book of God and his pure Household.\n\nPUTTING ON THE RELIGIOUS ROBE\n\nIn 1950 and at the age of ten, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi officially engaged in the Islamic and religious studies and put on the religious robe at this very young age. The beginning of these religious studies next to the sacred shrines of Imam Husayn and his loyal brother, Abbas, was a big privilege to many young and determined students of Islamic sciences who made it their cause, to respond to the centuries-long call of their leader, Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, on the Ashura Day and transmit the message of this holy leader to the entire humanity in every epoch of the history.\n\nThe sacred shrine of Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, has had a deep influence on the spiritual devotion and the scientific dedication of the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi, both as a young student of Islamic sciences in the holy city of Karbala and as a reliable and popular religious authority and Jurist in our times.\n\nA MEMORY OF THE FIRST DAYS\n\nAt the time when I used to read the basics of Islamic sciences, I remember an old person, a religious scholar, who came to my father and talked to him for a long time. In fact, he was an old friend of my father’s. They were classmates and they studied together. Finally, when he said good bye to my father, he came to me and said: Keep studying so that you become a great and learned man like your father. I have spent years with your father and we studied together. Your father always made his time for studying and doing research. He never left any subject unless he had mastered it. But I didn’t do much in studying. I always waited for the weekends to go out with my friends and have fun. I always requested your father to come with us, but he was always busy studying and reading. He never joined us on the weekends and kept reading, writing and discussing different subjects. I once got angry at him and told him what he is going to make out of all these studying.\n\nBut now, you can see your father has become a famous religious authority and jurist who funds the students, and I am only one of the many students who is funded by your father!\n\nAN ADVICE FOR STUDYING\n\nMy father used to tell us repeatedly that we should never let anything stop us from studying. He always used to tell us to give top priority to our studies, even if we had to quit doing recommended acts of worship. He also told us that we shouldn’t stop studying for the sake of some party or get-together. That is why, we never let anything to be an obstacle in our course of studying.\n\nPERSISTENT PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE\n\nThe Grand Islamic Authority and Jurist, Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi started studying the basics of Islamic sciences under direct supervision of his late father, Grand Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi. In addition, he enjoyed the loving company of his elder brother, the late Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi, who was a founder of the School of Imam Sadiq, and several other Quranic Institutions in the holy city of Karbala. During this period, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi had the chance to learn a lot from his prolific brother, the king of authors, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi.\n\nIn short, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi completed the preliminary and basic stages of Islamic sciences at the Islamic Seminaries. Then, he had the chance to sit at the feet of many great scholars and jurists of his time and began his studies in the Advanced Courses of Jurisprudence. His sharp mind and quick pace of learning made the Grand Jurist a popular and much-admired face among his teachers and the scholars. In fact, the rise of many great and prominent scholars and jurists, who each left many great legacies to protect Islam, signified that intelligence and sharpness runs in this family.\n\nThe Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi was a humble and keen student, whose earnest resolution for learning made him attend the courses of advanced jurisprudence under the top Islamic scholars of his time. After proving his profound reflection and weighty expertise in the Islamic sciences, the Grand Jurist was granted the level of Islamic leadership, Ijtihad. Since then, the Grand Jurist has been known as a qualified Islamic jurist, a skilled expert in deducing the hadiths, and an adept authority in giving interpretations of the holy Quran.\n\nSIMULTANEOUS LEARNING AND TEACHING\n\nIn his youth, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi was recognized as an accomplished and capable character in the Islamic sciences. Soon, other Islamic scholars in the holy city of Karbala requested the young Ayatollah to start teaching the large number of avid students in this holy city. Following these requests, the Grand Jurist began teaching advanced courses of Islamic sciences by the shrine of Imam Husayn, peace be upon him.\n\nThe Grand Jurist had dedicated all his time to studying and learning the extensive realm of Islamic sciences and he never missed a chance or opportunity to respond to the unprecedented issues in the Islamic law and jurisprudence.\n\nIn respect to acquiring the teachings of the holy Prophet of Islam and his Household, the Grand Jurist always makes this recommendation to all young students of Islamic sciences:\n\n“Studying and learning the teachings of the holy Prophet of Islam and his Household was my best ever decision and I believe it is the best choice one can ever make in this world; therefore, I recommend all the young people, especially the young Islamic students to make this decision and do their best in this long route. I also ask you to encourage all young friends to pick up this route and dedicate their lives in learning the teachings of the AhlulBayt.”\n\nTEACHERS\n\nDespite being recognized as a distinguished teacher of Islamic sciences in the holy city of Karbala, the Grand Jurist always took part in the courses held by the well-known and prominent Islamic Jurists and scholars and benefited from their deep perception of Islamic Jurisprudence. In fact, the interminable thirst of the Grand Jurist for the Islamic sciences could never be quenched except by kneeling at the feet of the great Islamic Jurists and scholars of his hometown.\n\nThe Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi studied under many great and outstanding figures of Islamic sciences, who all influenced the Grand Jurist in many juridical, moral, and doctrinal matters. Here, we bring you the names of some of these scholars:\n\nThe late Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Mirza Mahdi Husayni Shirazi\n\nThe late Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Husayni Shirazi\n\nMartyr Ayatollah Sayyid Hasan Husayni Shirazi\n\nThe late Grand Ayatollah Sheikh Muhammad Rida Isfahani\n\nLate Ayatollah Sheikh Muhammad Shahrudi\n\nLate Ayatollah Sheikh Muhammad Sidqi Mazandarani\n\nLate Ayatollah Sheikh Jafar Rashti\n\nThe Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi describes his teachers and instructors as following:\n\n“The most important quality of my teachers and many other great Islamic scholars, which made them stand out in the history was that they feared their Lord and had a durable state of piety. The real state of piety is a reality and understanding that causes the people to put God above all of their ambitions, such as power, supremacy, wealth, health, comfort, and luxury. This is not something beyond reach, as these scholars acquired this state of piety.”\n\nACHIEVING THE SATISFACTION OF IMAM MAHDI (PBUH)\n\nFor his entire lifetime, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi was determined to step in no other paths, except for the path of the genuine Islam set by the holy Prophet of Islam and his pure Household. With every step he took, the Grand Jurist tried to earn the satisfaction of his leader, Imam Mahdi, may he reappear soon. In this regard, the Grand Jurist says:\n\nAll my concern was not to be derailed from the path of the holy Prophet of Islam and his Household, the path of Imam Ali, peace be upon him.\n\nThe Grand Jurist has also mentioned that:\n\nAll the believers, especially the youth and the Islamic students should make efforts and endeavor hard to achieve the satisfaction of their leader, Imam Mahdi, may he reappear soon.\n\nThe satisfaction of Imam Mahdi, is a token of the God’s satisfaction; as the God’s satisfaction is a result of the satisfaction of Imam Mahdi, may the Lord hasten his advent. This means that there is a coherent and straight forward connection between the satisfaction of God and Imam Mahdi, peace be upon him.\n\nThis straight forward connection can also be deduced from the cause and effect relationship between God’s satisfaction and that of the chosen leader, Imam Mahdi, may he reappear soon.\n\n**************\n\nThe Joint Cultural Activities of\n\nGrand Ayatollah Shirazi and His Late Brother in Iraq\n\nAlongside His Brother\n\nThe Grand jurist and religious authority, Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi was always by the side of his late brother, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi and accompanied him in all of his sociopolitical plans and cultural activities. After the sad departure of his brother, the Grand Jurist took the helm of all these events and institutions, and continued the unfinished work of his brother.\n\nHere is a brief summary of the social, cultural and political activities by the late Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi which was taken up again by his brother, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi.\n\nReligious, Cultural and Social Institutions in Iraq\n\nSchools for Memorizing Holy Quran\n\nMore than three thousand boys and girls enrolled and studied in six Quranic Schools, which held up to thirty three different cultural and religious programs. The management of these schools were in the safe hands of more than two hundred Islamic scholars and teachers of Islamic Seminaries.\n\nThe Institution of Darul Quran\n\nDarul Quran Institution, with more than seventy branches across Iraq, especially in the cities of Najaf, Baghdad, Mosul, Amarah, and Rumaitha is dedicated to publishing and selling religious books. Although the Grand Jurist expected the number of the branches of this institution to rise to one thousand, but the critical political situation in Iraq stopped the number of these branches to grow.\n\nPublic Libraries\n\nMore than forty public libraries have been founded directly by the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi in many cities and villages. The public library of Quran Karim, which is located behind the Islamic Seminary of Ibn Fahd Hilli in holy Karbala, is one of these libraries.\n\nIslamic Publications and Journals\n\nPrint media, appearing the form of newspapers, journals and magazines have had an undeniable role in the public awareness of any society. In fact, many social movements have begun to exist by the power of the magazines and journals that illuminate on the ideological and doctrinal issues.\n\nWith full knowledge of the power of the media, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi, along with some other progressive Islamic scholars and intellectuals in the Islamic Seminaries utilized the huge potential of the print media to promote the Islamic values. Here is a list of the Islamic journals established by the supports of the Grand Jurist.\n\nCodes and Ethics in Arabic\n\nCall of Islam in Arabic\n\nQuran’s Guidance in Arabic\n\nVoice of the Preachers in Arabic\n\nShia Media in Arabic\n\nIslamic References in English\n\nVoice of the AhlulBayt in Arabic\n\nMemories of Infallibles in Arabic\n\nVoice of Islam in Arabic\n\nResponse to Islamic Queries in Arabic\n\nReferences of the Culture of Islam and many other Islamic magazines and journals.\n\nConstruction and Renovation of Mosques\n\nThe renovation projects of the deserted mosques was one of the social programs started by the late Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi. More than fifty mosques in different neighborhoods of Karbala city in Iraq were renovated and expanded in these projects. In addition, there were communities and societies founded to manage the affairs of these mosques.\n\nConstruction and Renovation of Islamic Schools\n\nMore than thirty religious schools, including: Husayniyah School, Razawiyah School, Ibn Fahd Hilli School, and Sharif Al-Ulema School were renovated in projects that were directed by the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi. In addition, there were many other schools, such as the school for Memorizing Quran and Islamic Morals, schools for handicrafts, the school of “Book and Household”, training lecturers and speakers, and the elementary school of Imam Sadiq, peace be upon him, which were constructed in the holy city of Karbala in Iraq. It is worth mentioning that two more schools were constructed in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.\n\nQuran Hakim Clinic\n\nThis clinic was founded to provide treatments to the patients, who were incapable of fully paying for thorough medical treatments. This clinic which was located in the Imam Ali square, in front of the Central Library, received only modest sum of money for providing full treatments by experienced and seasoned doctors and personnel.\n\nMarriage Grant\n\nThe deprived and the poor groups of young people who faced financial problems for starting a family were offered and provided with grants and other financial plans. These plans were part of the social security plans to combat social instability and sexual corruption.\n\nPromotion of Islamic Memorials\n\nIn an innovative and ground-breaking move, the schools of Quran memorization trained groups of scouts who held various programs on different religious occasions throughout the year. These scouts changed the face of Karbala city both during the happy celebrations and the days of the AhlulBayt martyrdom with their numerous programs.\n\nThe Islamic Club\n\nThis facility was established to provide the youth with a healthy atmosphere for entertainment and sports. In this regard, the Islamic Club was equipped with a full set of sporting goods and gym equipment, along with Islamic and scientific journals for the youth to have both physical and mental trainings. The Islamic Club was directed by a chosen board of the youth.\n\nSending Missionaries Abroad\n\nTo address the crucial subject of missionary tasks, there was a special committee appointed to administer the public funds and resources. This committee sent Islamic missionaries abroad on different religious occasions and took care of the expenses of these missionary tasks. African and European countries were two main destinations of these missionaries.\n\nReligious Community of the Youth\n\nWith instructions and the guidance of the late Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi, a number of educated young men and women started the religious community of the youth. This community set up funding for three major purposes.\n\nThe establishment of religious gatherings for the youth\n\nPublication and distribution of valuable religious books among the people\n\nTransmission of the AhlulBayt’s message and culture to other Muslim societies\n\nMobile Preaching Group 1\n\nThe mobile preaching group was engaged in many cultural activities and events. This group was successful in sending religious preachers to remote areas on a regular basis. This religious group also printed significant religious books and massive copies of prayer books on important occasions such as Arbaeen and Ashura.\n\nMobile Preaching Group 2\n\nThis preaching group followed the same procedures and programs, however, in a much greater scale. This mobile preaching group spread its activities to all of Iraq and sent its specialists to all cities and villages with automobiles branded as “Mobile Preaching Group 2”.\n\nReligious Guidance Institution\n\nIn some countries, the private sector including the big companies and the famous universities establish and run radio stations for their own purposes. Now, the question is “would it be right to have radio stations, supervised by the religious Jurists and experts to broadcast programs that improve public awareness about religious matter?” The answer is absolutely positive.\n\nIt was always one of the main goals of the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi to establish a radio station and speed the pace of his wide preaching activities in Iraq and across the world. However, authoritarian regimes and dictators were a big obstacle for this goal to be achieved. Therefore, the late Grand Jurist made preparations and installed loudspeakers in busy parts of the city of Karbala and performed many cultural and religious programs in this city. These loudspeakers broadcasted religious, scientific, and Islamic lectures by distinguished and famous characters.\n\nCenter for Islamic Preaching\n\nThe Center for Islamic Preaching performed many activities including installing placards, giving out religious pamphlets to people, and making statements on religious occasions such as Arbaeen, Ashura and Arafah day. This religious Center organized many outstanding religious gatherings with large numbers of people attending them.\n\nThe Center for Islamic Preaching was overwhelmingly successful in its efforts to encourage people and mark the religious celebrations in the entire city of Karbala. During the birthday anniversaries of the holy Imams, this Center used to install placards and stands with important quotes from the noble Infallibles.\n\nVisitations to Sacred Shrines\n\nA community was established to organize pilgrimage trips and visitations to the sacred shrines in different cities of Iraq, such as holy Najaf, holy Kadhimiya, and Samarra. During the month of Ramadan, this community made arrangements and held tour visits to the sacred shrine in the holy city of Samarra every day. The pilgrims in these trips were given free services such as food and transportation.\n\nStatements and Announcements\n\nOn different religious occasions, the loudspeakers installed in different parts of Karbala city made necessary announcements and statements to the public from the Central Library. In the absence of TV and other mediums, the people were informed of the latest programs and plans for the city and special religious ceremonials.\n\nThe House of Islamic Services\n\nThis foundation followed three major goals:\n\nStarting ties and Collaboration with the pool of newspapers, journals, and authors that published articles about the culture of Shia Islam and the Prophet of Islam and his pure Progeny.\n\nPublishing critiques and objections to the journals and magazines that insulted the Islamic principles and values. In cases, these criticisms led to reconsiderations by these journals.\n\nMaking connections and laying out the ground for cooperation with other Islamic Communities across the world.\n\nEstablishment of Islamic Guidance Community in entire Iraq\n\nEstablishment of almost 200 religious communities in different mosques\n\nWith the discretions and guidelines of the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi, the religious communities had organized a weekly get-together in mosques to coordinate their religious and cultural programs. These programs included sessions for Quran interpretations, courses of Islamic Law and Ethics, and publishing articles and pamphlets on different social and religious matters. The Islamic communities of Rasul Azam, Al-Quran Al-Hakim, the Islamic Awakening, the Islamic Awareness, and Imam Sadiq were some of the religious communities that engaged into these cultural and religious activities.\n\nJob Center\n\nTo assist and guide the massive workforce towards decent paying jobs and occupations, there was a Job Center established in the holy city of Karbala by orders of the late Grand Jurist.\n\nUnder direct supervision of the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi, there were annual glorious celebrations held on the birthday anniversary of Imam Mahdi, peace be upon him and may the Lord hasten his advent, in his birthplace, the holy city of Samarra.\n\nEach year, on the birthday anniversary of Imam Hasan Askari, peace be upon him, a large pack of Shias were organized to visit the shrine of this holy Imam in the city of Samarra. Free food and services were also part of this religious program.\n\nAfter nonstop efforts of the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi, and his two brothers, the martyr Ayatollah Sayyid Hasan Shirazi, and the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi for transmitting the message of Ashura and Imam Husayn’s uprising, the state-run radio station of Baghdad was left with no other option but to respect the Shia feelings and honor the martyrdom of Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, by streaming a speech by Sheikh Abd Al-Zahra Ka’abi, may he rest in peace.\n\nThe foundation of religious preachers for fighting off the sacrilegious activities.\n\nThe foundation of Council of Islamic Scholars, which was meant for addressing the latest problems and developments in the Muslim world.\n\nThe establishment of Quran Hakim Publication.\n\nThe formation of “Political Establishment” for influencing the Muslims’ social fate.\n\nThe foundation of religious organizations that served pilgrims from other countries.\n\nForming Islamic theater groups\n\nEstablishment of Community of “Servants of Mosques”\n\nThe foundation of Technical workshops\n\nCollaborations on the establishment of AhlulBayt printing company.\n\nThe establishment of community of authors for the publication of religious and ethical books\n\nSetting up religious gatherings.\n\nSetting up groups for managing ceremonials on religious occasions\n\nThe foundation of Cultural Centers\n\nOrganizing cultural and religious programs for students on their summer vacations\n\nPublication of religious books, in which the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi, along with his students at Imam Hasan community managed to print and publish up to a hundred thousand volumes of books.\n\nThe foundation of a large Islamic Center in Samarra, in the exact place where Imam Hadi, peace be upon him, was prisoned. This Islamic Center was built in this place in honor of Imam Hadi, peace be upon him.\n\nFundraising and encouraging people to build Islamic Centers in Iraq. Due to these activities, more than twenty Islamic Centers were founded in those days.\n\nEncouraging and organizing the enthusiasts for beginning communities to present Quranic educational courses. Due to these efforts, hundreds of Quranic educational courses were formed.\n\nEncouraging the talented youth to continue their educations in Islamic Seminaries. Due to the continuous lectures and inspirations by the late Grand Jurist, hundreds of teenagers enrolled at the Islamic Seminaries.\n\nEncouraging the educated young talents to fill in the place of great Islamic scholars and put on the Islamic robe to serve Islam, the holy Prophet of Islam and his pure progeny.\n\nEncouraging many scholars and authors to speed and expand their activities. Due to these words of encouragement and the assistance by the late Grand Jurist, many great religious authors and speakers were trained.\n\nEncouraging the people to establish interest free loan funds.\n\nEncouragements for organizing groups and fractions to provide services to the pilgrims of Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, on Ashura Day.\n\nThe late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi made three speeches every week to coordinate activities by his Office members.\n\n*************\n\nTHE FIGHT AGAINST DICTATORS IN IRAQ\n\nWithout the slightest doubts, all governments ruling over Iraq in recent decades have been formed and presided over by dictators and authoritarian presidents who dishonored the religious sanctities of the Iraqis and undermined the rights of the people.\n\nThe late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi always stood against all of those puppet and suppressive governments and exposed their hidden intentions to eliminate religious symbols. (In the meantime, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi was always at the side of his brother and gave his outright support to this great Islamic figure.) Some of the ways and methods used by the late Grand Jurist to expose these regimes are listed in the following:\n\nTHE MONARCHY\n\nThe late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi held firm and strong stances on all religious matters; these stances were announced and published by the wide network of PR offices established by the Grand Jurist. These announcements were included in the three books of “the Pure Tree”, the Reflection of Martyr Ayatollah Sayyid Hasan Shirazi on Jihad, and the book of “the civilization of mankind”. The regime of Nuri Said, however, prevented some journals such as the magazine of “Ethics and Conducts” to include these announcements and reports. These announcement were mostly objecting the regime’s destructive policies, especially the Treaty signed between Iraq and Britain.\n\nIn the final years of the monarchy, Abdul-Wahab Mirjan, who claimed to be a Shia person succeeded Nuri Said as the new prime minister of Iraq.\n\nThe late Grand Ayatollah Shirazi sent a delegation to the new prime minister in order to negotiate the “Lawsuit of the Sacred Sites”. This lawsuit was proposed under the tenure of Sayyid Muhammad Sadr as the head of the two legislature bodies of Iraq but after his resignation, this lawsuit never passed.\n\nThe delegation held a meeting with the prime minister and negotiated the lawsuit of sacred sites and talked about the implementation of other Islamic laws in the country.\n\nAfter this bold move, the prime minister issued a secret order to the security officials to arrest the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi and his brother, Sayyid Hasan Shirazi. However, the 14 July Revolution left all their plans unfinished. During this revolution, Nuri Said, Bihjat Atiyyah and other keynote figures of the regime were arrested and then executed.\n\nABDUL KARIM QASIM\n\nFollowing a coup, which was orchestrated by the Old Colonizer, the Britain, Abdul Karim Qasim defeated the monarchy in Iraq and ushered the way for the communists to tighten their grip on the power. Since the very first steps, the late Grand Ayatollah Shirazi openly criticized their beliefs and their social and political plans. The Grand Jurist also denounced their violent and ferocious governing styles which had spread the shadows of terror across Iraq.\n\nIn those disturbed times, the late Grand Jurist wrote and published the two books of “Hawar Hawl Tatbiq Al-Islam” (A Word on the Implementation of Islam), and “Mubahithat Ma’a Ashuyui’yn” (Debates with Communists). He also published several books about the beliefs of Shia Islam, including the books of “Social Beliefs” and “In the Shade of Islam”, in order to spread public awareness against the poisonous propaganda of the communists. Meanwhile, the Grand Jurist held round table discussions and talked straightly to the people who were under the influence of the communists’ propaganda.\n\nAside from all of these cultural and religious activities, the Grand Jurist was determined to uncover the true and irreligious face of Abdul Karim Qasim, to the masses of people. The Grand Jurist never missed any chance to voice his serious concerns over the dominion of the communists over Iraq and the Muslims.\n\nNATIONALISM IN IRAQ BY ABDUL-SALAM ARIF AND HIS BROTHER ABDUL RAHMAN\n\nIn this period of the Iraq’s political history, the Baath Party acceded to power and General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr was elected prime minister. His first move was the formation of the National Guard, which was meant to intimidate the public and the dissidents. Unfortunately, the Baath Party followed the communists and Abdul Karim Qasim in their footsteps and committed many unspeakable crimes.\n\nTherefore, the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi, along with many other notable Islamic figures and scholars staged a resistance against the Baath Party.\n\nWith the hopes of opening a route for dialogue and as a demonstration of good will, the Grand Jurist sent a delegation, comprising of famous Islamic scholars, to Abdul Salam Arif. This delegation was given the mission to negotiate these two requests:\n\nThe revocation of all anti-Islamic laws in all ministries and official departments, including the laws which were passed during the Monarchy or the Republic.\n\nMaking schedules for implementing the Islamic Laws in Iraq\n\nAbdul Salam promised he will take time to see into these requests and implement the Islamic laws in the country. However, the time proved that his promises were only lies. Since then, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi started a full-force resistance against the ethnic government of Abdul Salam. In this period, all authors, speakers, the journals and papers affiliated to the Grand Jurist formed the ranks of resistance against the Baath Party and continued their works until the reign of Abdul Rahman Arif.\n\nTHE NEW ERA OF BAATH PARTY\n\nAfter the July 17 Revolution, the new era of Baath Party began in Iraq. At this critical period, the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi, as well as other great scholars and jurists from the cities of Najaf, Karbala, and Kadhimiya united to fight the new era of suppression by the Baath Party. In this era, the Baath Party which enjoyed from the full support of the Britain, started to arrest the large number of its dissidents and opposition with the fabricated charges of espionage and acting against the national security. Ayatollah Sayyid Hasan Shirazi along with many other notable characters were immediately imprisoned; Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Mohsen Hakim also faced many restrictions and threats by the regime while his son, Sayyid Mahdi Hakim was sentenced to death in absentia. He was charged with espionage. The late Grand Ayatollah Shirazi resisted against the atrocious crimes of the Baath Party and continued his fight against this ferocious regime. Following his firm stances, the journals and the charity organizations affiliated to the Grand Jurist were closed and suspended. Thousands of religious and media activists, who were born in Iraq were stripped of their nationality and were deported from the country. Consequently, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi was forced to leave the country and immigrate to Kuwait. In the meantime, the Baath Party sentenced the late Grand Jurist to death in absentia.\n\nThe mounting pressures on the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi and his brother, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi led to an upsurge of anger and umbrage among the Muslims in India, Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and many other Islamic countries. The news of the pressures by the Baath Party and the immigration of these two great figures of the Muslim world was widely covered by many newspapers.\n\nAl-Hayat newspaper, number 8033 wrote:\n\n“The exile and immigration of religious scholars continue in Iraq”\n\nThe Al-Hayat political reporter continues:\n\n“The Baath regime intensifies its fights against the Islamic sanctities and the Islamic Seminaries of holy Najaf, holy Karbala, and holy Kadhimiya after it forced scores of notable Islamic scholars out of the country. These waves of deportations started with the exile of prominent Shia religious leader, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi. Imam Shirazi and a number of other notable scholars have chosen Kuwait as their destination.”\n\n*************\n\nIMMIGRATION FROM IRAQ TO KUWAIT\n\nIt was a difficult decision for the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi and his brother, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi to leave Iraq in secret. The suppressive Baath regime had surrounded the house of the late Grand Jurist and was determined to arrest and execute his eminence. On October 9, 1971, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi along with his brother left the country and traveled to Syria, where they paid a visit to the sacred shrine of Lady Zaynab, peace be upon her, in Damascus. Then, they moved to Beirut and after they received invitations from the Shia Muslims in Kuwait, they traveled to this country and were warmly welcomed by the large number of Shia Muslims at the country’s airport.\n\nShortly after the Kuwaiti Shia Muslims were informed of the presence of the Grand Ayatollah Shirazi in their country, they rushed to visit the Grand Jurist in large groups. The late Haji Sheikh Abbas Ali Islami, the head of “The Community of Islamic Learnings” describes the presence of the Grand Ayatollah Shirazi in these words:\n\n“The great spirit, the dignity and the confidence of the Shia Muslims in Kuwait is a heritage of the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi. The presence of this great scholar in Kuwait was a big blessing to all people, and they should be grateful to God for giving them the chance to enjoy the presence of this distinguished Islamic figure.”\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS IN KUWAIT\n\nAfter the settlement of the Shirazi Family in Kuwait, the Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi began numerous projects to prepare the grounds for more religious activities in this country.\n\nThe foundation of an Islamic Seminary\n\nIn less than a year after their immigration to Kuwait, the Shirazi Family founded an Islamic Seminary in this country and invited many enthusiasts from all Islamic countries to enroll at this School.\n\nThis Islamic Seminary which was named “The School of Rasul Azam”, started its activities with 60 rooms that housed 150 students. This Islamic Seminary played an important role in the growth of the public interest in the Islamic activities and ideals in Kuwait and other Islamic countries. Soon, the School of Rasul Azam turned into a light that pierced through the darkness of corrupt and suppressive regimes of the region.\n\nThe foundation of Rasul Azam Husayniyah\n\nThe Husayniyah of Rasul Azam was an Islamic Center founded by the late Grand Jurist in order to help promote and spread the rituals and the message of Ashura and Imam Husayn’s uprising.\n\nInterpretation of holy Quran\n\nDuring the eight years of their stay in Kuwait, the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi and his brother, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi held courses of Quran interpretations for the public groups of people. These courses were handled in way so that the ordinary people could also join these discussions and develop a deeper insight from the holy Quran. In addition, these courses addressed the importance of rescuing the Muslim nations from the claws of colonialism.\n\nSpread of AhlulBayt Culture in Kuwait\n\nThe presence of such great and learned figures from the Shirazi Family in Kuwait was very rewarding in that critical period of time. In that period, the colonizers had waged a serious and forceful fight against all Islamic and moral values in Kuwait, and the youth were greatly influenced by these anti-Islamic propaganda.\n\nHowever, the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi and his brother, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi stood up in the face of the colonizers and protected the Islamic identity and culture of Kuwait.\n\nThe masses of people were attracted to the far-reaching and profound ideas of these two great scholars from the Shirazi Family. Subsequently, the large number of students who were trained by these two great scholars spread the light of guidance to all corners of Kuwait and helped the vulnerable and curious souls of the youth to find relief and salvation in the rich and insightful values of the genuine Islam. In short, Kuwait turned into a strong base for the Islamic scholars and religious activists, who coordinated the numerous Islamic activities and projects, especially during the month of Ramadan in the neighboring countries.\n\nFurthermore, the late Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi, along with his brother Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi founded series of Islamic Institutions in Kuwait. Here is a list of these Islamic Institutions.\n\nThe foundation of Rasul Azam library, with more than thirty thousand books.\n\nThe foundation of a large hall for religious gatherings and ceremonies.\n\nThe foundation of an institution which had the task of renovating Islamic Centers and Mosques.\n\nThe publication of Islamic Journals\n\nSome of the Islamic journals and magazines published by the Shirazi family are listed as following:\n\n“Al-Iman” journal which translates into Faith Magazine.\n\n“Al-Islam wa Al-Hayat” which translates into the Magazine of Islam and life\n\n“Fitat Al-Taqadumiya” which translates into Pioneer Girls Magazine\n\n“Al-Hidaya” which translates into Guidance\n\n“Al-Jihad” Magazine\n\nThe foundation of two hundred small libraries\n\nEncouraging the people to form religious gatherings on a weekly basis. Formerly, the religious gatherings were only held on the months of Muharram and Ramadan, but after these encouragements, the Kuwaitis held gatherings on a regular basis.\n\nThe foundation of two big libraries due to the encouragements of the Grand Jurist.\n\nThe foundation of a center to facilitate marriage\n\nThe publication of sixty books, including the book of “Al-Muraji’at” translates as The Right Path. This book was written by the late Sayyid Sharaful Din and it published in thousands of copies and was distributed in Kuwait, Egypt, and during the Hajj rituals.\n\nHolding Ashura gatherings at the Universities.\n\nAfter persistent efforts by the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi, the rituals of Ashura day were given media coverage.\n\nThe foundation of Al-Jahra’ Mosque and Husayniya\n\nThe foundation of Rasul Azam library in neighboring countries.\n\nThe Grand Jurist had weekly speeches to the public on Friday mornings. In addition, the Grand Jurist also talked to the Islamic scholars and experts at the School of Rasul Azam on Thursdays.\n\nThe construction of a Public Baths and a Morgue.\n\nThe Grand Jurist used to send prayer leaders to mosques and Islamic Centers.\n\nThe foundation of publication centers for publishing Islamic books.\n\nThe establishment of “the assembly of authors” whose members were mostly young and educated writers.\n\nEstablishing interest-free loan funds. This fund also provided financial supports for the religious celebrations and ceremonials in Kuwait.\n\nThe Grand Jurist established religious courses during the school holidays. These courses were held in different stages for the elementary students, for junior school students, for high school students, and for college students and their teachers. The participants at these courses studied the Islamic principles and sciences by new methods. The graduates of these courses could write many substantial articles and books on different religious matters.\n\nThe foundation of a publication center that published more than fifty Islamic books in one year.\n\nThe Grand Jurist contacted many non-Shia and non-Islamic institutions and communities in different countries in order to invite them to the rightful culture of the holy Prophet of Islam and his progeny.\n\nRELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES\n\nThe School of Rasul Azam in Kuwait played an important role in making the new generations familiar with the principles of Islamic morals and beliefs. In fact, this school gave rise to many famous speakers, writers, and religious activists who widened the scope of Shia Islamic activism in many other Islamic countries too.\n\nDuring his stay in Kuwait, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi expanded the beams of Shia culture in many other countries neighboring Kuwait. This is while that these oil-rich countries were suffering from the overwhelming and irresistible dominion of colonialist powers and the communists. The colonizers were decisive to annihilate all Islamic values and tenets, in order to pave the way for their undisputable rule over these oil-rich countries. The late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi was one of the few leaders who could preach the Islamic concepts and principles in these countries. The tireless efforts of the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi and his brother, Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi were an important part of the Islamic awakening in many Islamic countries. After eight years of nonstop works and efforts in Kuwait, the Grand Ayatollah Shirazi traveled to Iran to continue his religious activism and his everlasting fight against corruption and oppression in a broader scope and arena.\n\n******************\n\nIMMIGRATION TO IRAN\n\nIn 1979, the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi and the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi made a pivotal decision and chose Iran as their next destination to continue their nonstop scientific, cultural and political activities.\n\nUpon the arrival of these two great Islamic figures to Iran, the throngs of scholars, intellectuals, and the masses of people welcomed the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi and his honorable brother. The big turnout of people and the attendance of distinguished scholars who received the two notable Islamic characters so warmly, was noticed by the newspapers published in Beirut, the Lebanese capital.\n\nThe presence of these two great characters was a blessing to the people and the Grand Jurist, Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi continued to serve his elder brother, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi as a loyal aide and an honest advisor.\n\nThe Intellectual Movement\n\nThe late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi continued the intellectual movement he had started in Iraq by his numerous publications and books. Many of these books were translated and published in different languages such as English, Persian, and Urdu, in many Islamic and non-Islamic countries.\n\nWith a tireless resolution, the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi continued to put down his innovative and ground-breaking ideas in different realms of the Islamic sciences during his stay in the holy city of Qom, since 1979 to 2001. In these years, the Grand Jurist wrote 60 volumes out of the 160 of volumes of his major collective studies in Islamic Jurisprudence, called “Al-Fiqh”.\n\nIn spite of his great collective study with regards to Islamic jurisprudence, the late Grand Jurist authored many other great works such as the collection of “Al-Wasail Ela Rasail” (The means of the missions) in twenty volumes, and the books of “The path to the Islamic Awakening”, “The frameworks for a new world with freedom, welfare, and peace” and finally the book of “Make Change to Wake Muslims”. In addition, the Grand Jurist illuminated on the history of the fourteen infallible figures in 14 separate books. In those years, the Grand Jurist made thousands of valuable lectures on Islamic sciences and morals, especially during his weekly speeches on each Thursday at Imam Zainul Abedin Mosque in holy Qom. His eminence also taught the highest levels of Islamic Jurisprudence, Al-Fiqh and Usul, to hundreds of ardent and enthusiastic students since 1979.\n\nThe Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi also began his religious and cultural activities by writing books, teaching the highest levels of Islamic Jurisprudence to the passionate students, and holding gatherings to speak about the genuine Islamic morals. In the following years, the Grand Jurist was known as a symbol of Islamic morals and a skilled expert in the Islamic sciences. At the moment, many students of the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi are among the top Islamic preachers and speakers in the Muslim and non-Muslim countries.\n\nIn short, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi became known as a pious and insightful company for many great Islamic jurists and scholars. The large number of Islamic students along with the notable Islamic scholars and jurists eagerly sought the companionship of Grand Ayatollah Shirazi and enjoyed his vast knowledge of Islamic sciences.\n\nLike his elder brother, the Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi spares no moment and effort in his scientific activities. In the years, when the Baath regime was brutally attacking the holy city of Qom, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi along with his brother traveled to the holy city of Mashhad, and continued their studies of the Islamic sciences at the Islamic Seminary of Imam Rida, beside the sacred shrine of Imam Rida, peace be upon him, in this city. This transition was widely welcomed by the Islamic students in holy Mashhad, as they could join the courses of advanced Islamic jurisprudence by these two great Islamic scholars.\n\nCommunity Centers\n\nOne of the greatest concerns of the late Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi was to establish centers that can be effective in the realm of cultural and religious activism in different countries. This great concern pushed the Grand Jurist and his brother Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi to support and found a large number of cultural and religious centers, which are operative in many different countries.\n\nHere is a glimpse of these Religious and Cultural Centers:\n\nSchools\n\nThe school of Rasul Azam in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe school of Imam Mahdi in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe school of Imam Hadi in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe school of Imam Baqir in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe school of Imam Husayn in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe school of martyr Sayyid Hasan Shirazi in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe female school of Al-Zahra in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe school of Imam Rida in holy Mashhad, Iran\n\nLibraries\n\nThe library of Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe library of Ale Rasul in Isfahan, Iran\n\nIman Publication Center in holy Qom, Iran\n\nDarul Mahdi Publication Center in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe institution of Islamic Thought in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe library of Darul Husayn in Yazd, Iran\n\nThe female library of Al-Zahra in holy Qom, Iran\n\nMosques\n\nThe mosque of Imam Husayn in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe mosque of Imam Zainul Abedin in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe mosque of Imam Rida in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe mosque of Imam Hasan in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe mosque of Sayyida Masoumah in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe mosque of Al-Zahra in holy Mashhad, Iran\n\nInterest-free loan funds\n\nThe loan fund of Sayyid Shuhada in Tehran, Iran\n\nThe loan fund of Sayyid Shuhada in Isfahan, Iran\n\nThe loan fund of Sayyid Shuhada in Tabriz, Iran\n\nThe loan fund of Sayyid Shuhada in Rahnan town, Isfahan, Iran\n\nThe loan fund of Sayyid Shuhada in holy Mashhad, Iran\n\nThe loan fund of Sayyid Shuhada in Yazd, Iran\n\nThe loan fund of Sayyid Shuhada in Varamin, Iran\n\nThe loan fund of Sayyid Shuhada in Adrian town, Isfahan, Iran\n\nThe loan fund of Imam Jawad in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe loan fund in Kahak, holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe loan fund of Husayn ibn Ali in holy Mashhad, Iran\n\nThe Husayniyahs (Islamic Centers)\n\nThe Islamic Center of Isfahan\n\nThe Islamic Center of Fatimiyun in Dihnu, Isfahan, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Sayyid Shuhada in Rahnan, Isfahan, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Sayyid Shuhada in Isfahan, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Qamar Bani Hashim in Adrian town, Isfahan, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Yazd, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Shahre Rei, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Ahwaz, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Shiraz, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of holy Mashhad, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Meibod, Yazd, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Qazwin, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Tehran, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Mahallat, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Sayyid Shuhada in Kashan, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Darul Husayn in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Sayyid Shuhada in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Zaynabiyyah in holy Qom, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Qarchak and Varamin, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Dowlat Abad, Isfahan, Iran\n\nThe Islamic Center of Malek Shahr, Isfahan, Iran\n\nClinic of Sayyid Shuhada in Tehran, Iran\n\nMarriage Foundation of Sayyid Shuhada in Tehran, Iran\n\nThe Beginning of the Intellectual Movement of Grand Ayatollah Shirazi\n\nThe Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi, alongside his brother continued to serve the path of the Prophet’s Household by producing valuable books, establishing numerous Islamic foundations, and organizing huge movements for introducing the real Islam across the world. The two brothers had set their goal to approach the Islamic utopia and globalize the culture of the Prophet’s Household and the Shia Islam. In this long path, they preserved their hopes and dedicated their lives for achieving these lofty goals.\n\nThe Central Office of the Shirazi scholars was always a shelter to all the Muslims, and even the non-Muslims. The presence of the leaders of other faiths and religions was a significant mark that demonstrated the high respects and popularity of the Shirazi scholars beyond the spheres of Islam. In fact, the two Shirazi scholars were the suns of the Islamic jurisprudence whose warmth had even overwhelmed the non-Muslim scholars.\n\nThe end of a star\n\n“Verily we are from God and to Him, we shall return.”\n\nOn December 18, 2001, the Shia Muslims suffered an irreparable loss. The statue of piety and wisdom, the Grand Islamic Authority and Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi departed this world and joined his masters, the holy Prophet of Islam and his pure Household. On this very day, the world of Islam lost a great Islamic scholar, whose huge contributions to the culture of Shia Islam remained matchless in the last century. Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Shirazi, in his youth time, had once the honor of meeting the twelfth infallible leader, Imam Mahdi, may he reappear soon, in the mosque of Sahlah in Kufa city. In that meeting, Imam Mahdi set the road for this great Islamic scholar and prolific author, and commanded him to write. This was a light that showed the long path ahead of the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi, the author of more than 1200 invaluable books that laid out the stance of Quran and the Prophet’s Household in all important matters of our modern world.\n\nThe late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi was the author of the extensive study into the Islamic jurisprudence called “Al-Fiqh” that comprises 160 volumes and addresses up to fifty thousand topics, which have been unnoticed before.\n\nDue to the countless and invaluable books and publications of the late Grand Jurist, the International Association of Arab Writers granted the title of the “King of Authors” to the Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi.\n\nHowever, the Grand Jurist was not merely admired as a prolific and productive author, but he was a respectful character among the public for his humane and ethical stances on different social topics. The popularity of the Grand Jurist grew so much that even his adversaries warned each other not to meet the Grand Jurist in person, as his mild manners and deep words would soften their hearts and make them attracted to him.\n\nWith the special attentions of Imam Mahdi, may he reappear soon, Grand Ayatollah Shirazi became known as a leading figure and Jurist in Islamic jurisprudence and surpassed all his contemporaries. After a meeting with the Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi, the late Grand Ayatollah Mar’ashi Najafi expressed his feelings for the Grand Jurist in these words: “Tears role down my face only because I know that our generation won’t recognize the great position of this man (Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Shirazi). Maybe two centuries later, his real character will be appreciated.” These words speak of a reality, which was repeatedly pointed to by many other great figures of Shia and Sunni Islam.\n\nAfter the sad departure of the Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Shirazi, it became a matter of great concern that who should succeed and fill in the empty place of the late Grand Jurist as the next leading Marja and Jurist of the Shia Muslims? This question whirled around the minds of millions of Shia Muslims, who knew the precarious and hazardous situation of Shia Islam in those disturbed times. Someone had to pick up this burden and continue the path treaded by the late Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Shirazi, someone the public could look up to and become inspired by his deep knowledge and earnest preservations.\n\nAfter the death of Grand Ayatollah Sheikh Murtida Ansari on 1864, the Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Mirza Muhammad Hasan Shirazi, also known as the Great Mirza started a path, which was later treaded by many great Islamic scholars from the Shirazi family. On 1894, Grand Ayatollah Mirza Muhammad Taqi Shirazi succeeded the Great Mirza and led the Shia Muslims against the invaders. The respectful son of the Great Mirza, Sayyid Mirza Ali Shirazi was the next Islamic scholar who stepped up to this position on 1919, and on 1936, the Grand Ayatollah Mirza Mahdi Shirazi was given the burden of the Muslims’ leadership. This path was later continued by one of the greatest scholars of the time, the Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi. But after the passing of this great character, no one, except for the great Islamic scholar and jurist, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi could ever pick up the steam and continue to lead the Shia Muslims in this disturbed era.\n\nThe news of the passing of the late Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Shirazi, the king of authors ripped through the entire world and put the Muslim populace into shock. Consequently, floods of people came together in the holy city of Qom and participated in the glorious funeral service of this exceptional Islamic scholar and jurist. Finally, the pure body of the late Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi was put to rest in the holy shrine of Lady Ma’soumah, peace be upon her, after the Grand Jurist’s brother, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi performed the dead prayers on his body. Today, the resting place of the late Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Shirazi is an inspiration to the countless believers and Islamic scholars around the world to step in his feet.\n\n**************\n\nTHE RISE OF A SUN FROM HOLY KARBALA\n\nThe Rise of the New Islamic Jurist and Scholar, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi\n\nWith his far-reaching and broad knowledge of the existing state of affairs, the late Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi could know that he has to introduce a potent and accomplished heir to continue the movements he had started. He needed to make sure that his replacement will be someone who surpasses all others in the realm of Islamic sciences and spirituality, someone who will continue to lead the Muslim world with an unshakable faith and undeniable popularity; therefore, in a historic letter, he introduced his brother, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi as his successor and invited all Shia Muslims to help and follow him in the lengthy and hard path ahead. Since then, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi has been praised as a loyal follower of the holy Prophet of Islam and his Pure Household, and a stern reviver of the Islamic rituals of Imam Husayn, peace be upon him.\n\nIn the name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful\n\nPraise belongs to the Lord of the worlds, and peace and blessings be upon Muhammad and his pure Household.\n\nAnd so, I acknowledge that the Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi, may his services be continued, has mastered the Islamic sciences with a thorough understanding and that he has acquired piety and justice to its brims. I believe he has earned all the qualifications of an Islamic Jurist, someone who can release fatwas and be referred to by the believers.\n\nTherefore, I declare it is permissible for all the believers to refer to his eminence in all of their religious matters, on the condition of the permission by the just Islamic jurists. And I ask him to preserve piety, which is the path to salvation. I also ask my believing brothers to follow his eminence in all related affairs.\n\nGod, the Almighty, is the one who determines success and power, and He is the only helper.\n\nSayyid Muhammad Shirazi\n\nThe Great Legacy\n\nIn this regard, the late Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Rida Shirazi, the eldest son of the late Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi said: “I ask the Almighty Lord to help all of us, our scholars, our speakers, and our women and men to preserve the legacy of my father, the Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi and obey his eminence.”\n\nThe Memory of Sun\n\nAyatollah Sayyid Murtida Shirazi, the second son of the late Grand Jurist, Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi also said:\n\n“The Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi is alive, because he has left us a great legacy; a legacy that outweighs everything else. My late father left us a great scholar and a statue of piety, someone who is a relief to our souls and hearts. My father is still alive, because he left us a unique and peerless leader and scholar, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi.\n\nHe is a renowned scholar and a great man who spent half the century to help his brother. After the martyrdom of Ayatollah Sayyid Hasan Shirazi, he always stood up for his brother and became his loyal supporter.\n\nYes, my father is still alive, because there is a man from his blood, whose deep knowledge and unshakable piety is attested by all Islamic scholars; he is the fountain of knowledge and we should enjoy and value his presence among us.\n\nThe Islamic seminaries admit his great scientific character and his invaluable books prove his vast and profound knowledge of the Islamic sciences. The name of my late father will live on, because he has left us such a great legacy, the scholar Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi.”\n\nThe Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi, Personality Traits\n\nIn the name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful\n\nGrand Ayatollah Shirazi, a competent, compassionate and concerned leader\n\nIn a noble hadith, it is stated: “One who doesn’t have concerns for the Muslims’ problems and doesn’t try to solve them, is not a Muslim.”\n\nThis hadith is a scale by which we can tell apart the real Muslims from the rest. In other words, this hadith tells us that one’s knowledge and understanding of Islam is only measured by their dutifulness and observance of their responsibilities, which are inscribed to them by Islam. Although this hadith serves as a scale that measures the reality of every individual’s faith, yet it is by far a more valuable tool that can be helpful to the influential and public figures, especially the scholars and the religious authorities in a society.\n\nLikewise, we can see that the holy Prophet of Islam always had concerns about the bad conditions of the Muslims either when he was in holy Mecca or in holy Medina. His holiness had so deep concerns that he couldn’t have a moment of comfort. During his residence in holy Mecca, Lady Khadija, who couldn’t see what the holy Prophet went through, told him: “Oh, the messenger of God. I am worried about you. You are working day and night, and it is wearing you down. You must take some rest.” The holy Prophet answered her in these words: “Khadija, the time for sleeping is over; there is no time for rest or respite.” This is while that in holy Medina, the holy Prophet had even more concerns as he always had to defend the Muslims in the frontlines against the enemies.\n\nIn the same way, Imam Ali, peace be upon him, was deeply concerned over the bad conditions of the Muslims, in all stages of his life in holy Mecca, holy Medina or Kufa. He let go of all luxuries and comforts, and didn’t spend a moment unless he was working out a way to improve the conditions of the new born Muslim nation. The loyal companions of Imam Ali expressed their concerns for his holiness and said: “You should give yourself a time for resting.” But Imam Ali told them: “If I sleep at nights, I would have lost the chance to worship my Lord; and if I sleep in daylight, I would have failed the Muslim nation.”\n\nIn this subject, the Islamic scholars and religious authorities, including the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi adhered to the path of the holy Prophet of Islam and his pure Household and grew an all-time concern for the Muslim nation. The Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi, during his residence in holy Karbala, Kuwait, and in holy Qom, always tried to serve and keep alive the intellectual movements created by his late brother, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi. Furthermore, the Grand Jurist pioneered many influential movements by his valuable and priceless publications and like his father, the Grand Ayatollah Mirza Mahdi Shirazi, continued his nonstop works for promoting the conditions of not only the Muslim populace but also the entire humanity. The Grand Jurist strongly believes that knowledge becomes valuable only if it is accompanied by piety; therefore, his eminence set an example in this regard and became known as a symbol of knowledge and piety in our contemporary times.\n\nThe highest courses of Islamic sciences by the Grand Ayatollah Shirazi show the immense level of the Grand Jurist’s knowledge, and his high manners are a token of his surpassing state of piety and devotion. The Grand Jurist always bears with him a big concern for the Muslim populace and works day and night to improve the lives of the Muslims.\n\nMany of the Islamic Jurists and contemporary scholars, when asked about the Shirazi scholars, highlight that this great and old family has a long history of unparalleled sacrifices for the Muslim world, signifying their big concern for the Muslim nation.\n\nThe long-time scientific works of the Grand Jurist such as his interpretation of the precious book of “Al-Urwatul Wuthqa”, resolved many complex and the yet-unanswered questions. In addition, the Grand Jurist’s ingenious introduction to his book of Islamic laws, which illuminated on the most challenging principles of the Islamic beliefs in the most simple and brief wordings helped the large number of Shia Muslims to get familiar with the depth of the genuine Islamic beliefs. In the meantime, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi kept working on a big social plan, on the international level in order to promote the lives of the oppressed Muslim nation in the entire world.\n\nIn this regard, the Grand Ayatollah Shirazi tried the old and new methods to introduce the true reflection on the holy Quran, the genuine culture of the holy Prophet of Islam and his Household to the entire world. The numerous publications of the Grand Jurist about the culture of the Household of the Islamic Prophet and the countless web pages and TV networks, along with the various cultural and religious institutions and the Islamic and the human rights associations, they all try to present a deeper and more authentic approach to the real Islam and the peaceful culture of the Islamic Prophet and his Household. At the moment, many Shia human rights organization such as Shia Rights Watch have emerged to carry the heavy responsibility of defending the oppressed nation of Shia Muslims and have voiced out the unheard story of their sufferings at the international podiums. All these great achievements are indebted to the far-reaching thoughts and plans of the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi.\n\nThe Daily Schedule of the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi\n\nThe Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi has dedicated his whole time to serving the Almighty God and helping out the people. A portion of the daily schedule of the Grand Jurist is dedicated to teaching the highest levels of Islamic jurisprudence to the large number of avid students; his eminence has also specified a certain time of his every day to his personal studies and researchers on different Quranic topics and the hadiths.

In most of these meetings, the representatives of the Grand Jurist, the social and political experts and the distinguished religious activists present reports of their activities and then listen to the precious guidelines of the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi. The crammed daily schedule of the Grand Ayatollah Shirazi doesn’t leave his eminence more the three or four hours of sleep in every day. Finally, the Grand Jurist has specified the rest of his schedule to answering the written questions sent to him from around the world.\n\n**********\n\nMoral and Ethical Codes of Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi\n\nA Statue of Moral Traits\n\nThe public admires the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi as a perfect scholar, a caring religious leader and a statue of moralities.

The warm smile on the face of the Grand Jurist is a soothing sight and his perceptive directives and guidelines are a sign of his insightful and visionary character.

This Tunisian Shia convert expressed his feelings in these sentences:\n\n“The warmth of your smile makes me think of the holy Prophet of Islam and Imam Ali, whose enemies couldn’t find any faults with him, so they started criticizing him for having a sense of humor. They wanted to criticize him, but unintentionally, they unfolded another great quality of his holiness.”\n\nCourtesy, passion, and forgiveness are the most significant moral characteristics of the Grand Ayatollah Shirazi, which are important characteristics of any successful and popular leader and role model. All these qualities and characteristics have made the Grand Jurist to stand out all other contemporary Islamic jurists and scholars, and have given his eminence a powerful influence over all friends and adversaries.\n\nThe Company of Grand Ayatollah Shirazi\n\nThe sweet company of the Grand Jurist, according to the dozens of people who have enjoyed it, is a gift that reminds every one of the Almighty God and the pure Household of the holy Prophet of Islam.

This intimate and close bond between the Grand Jurist and the people with different ethnicities has planted the seeds of compassion and love in the hearts of millions of Muslims around the world who see the Grand Jurist as their compassionate and concerned father and a comforting shelter. In holy Quran, God Almighty states:\n\n“Surely (as for) those who believe and do good deeds, for them will Allah bring about love,”\n\nChapter 19, Verse 96\n\nThe Statue of Piety\n\nThe great scientific and spiritual character of the Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Sadiq Shirazi leaves people with very few words to describe his eminence. In fact, the Grand Ayatollah Shirazi is an Islamic jurist who has mastered Islamic knowledge, is recognized as a popular Islamic leader, and has acquired the moralities of the holy Prophet of Islam and Imam Ali, peace be upon them both. All these characteristics are the best means to describe a true and real Shia person to the entire world. The high manners of the Grand Jurist give us the notion of what the Islamic utopia and the perfection of piety and morals can be like in an exemplary time. In short, the Grand Ayatollah Shirazi is a depiction of the famous hadith by Imam Ali, who describes the character of the pious and faithful people.\n\nIn this hadith, the commander of the faithful and the gate of knowledge, Imam Ali, peace be upon him, describes the pious people in these words:\n\n“They possess pre-eminence and excellence because they always speak truthfully, rightly and to the point, their way of living is based upon moderation, and their mode of dealing with other men is founded on their good will, fellow feeling and courtesy towards them. They deny themselves the things prohibited by God. They concentrate their minds upon knowledge of things which will bring them eternal bliss.\n\nThey bear hardships and sufferings as happily as they enjoy comforts and pleasures. If God had not fixed the span of life for each one of them, their souls in desire of attaining His Heaven and out of fear of falling into His displeasure, would not have stayed in their bodies for long.”\n\n“They have visualized mentally the glory of God in such a way that beyond him nothing in this world alarms, frightens or awes them. Everything other than His might appears to them as insignificant and humble. They believe in the Heaven and its blessings like a person who has been there and has actually seen everything of the Heaven with his own eyes.\n\nSimilarly, their faith in the Hell and its torments is as strong as that of a person who had passed through its sufferings. They feel that the tortures of the Hell are around them and very near to them.”\n\n“The ways of worldly people make them sorry. They harm nobody. They do not indulge in excessive eating and pleasure seeking. Their wants are limited. Their wishes are few. They have accepted patiently sufferings and adversities in this mortal and transitory life for the sake of eternal bliss which by the grace of God proved for them a very profitable transaction.\n\nThe vicious world desired their fellowship but they turned their faces away from it. It wanted to snare them, but they willingly accepted every trouble and discomfort to free themselves from its clutches.”\n\n“Their nights they spend in carefully studying the Quran, because, of their weaknesses and short-comings, and try to find ways from this Holy book for improvements of their minds. In the study of the Qur’an when they came across a passage describing the Heaven they feel highly attracted towards it and develop such a keen desire to reach it; that the Heaven with all its blessings is visualized by their minds, while a passage about the Hell frightens them and makes them feel as if they are seeing and hearing the raging fire and the groans and lamentations of those who are suffering the tortures of the Hell.”\n\n“Nights they spend in praying before the Lord and requesting and beseeching Him to deliver them from the Hell. Days find them occupied with such works that clearly indicate their wisdom, depth of knowledge, virtuousness, and piety. Constant fasting, simple diet: avoidance of every aspect of luxury and regular hard work make them look lean and haggard, but they possess very sound and robust health.\n\nWhen people hear them discussing various problems of life they often take them to be whimsical fanatic or even half-witted. But it is not so, they are not satisfied with the quality and quantity of the work done by them in the cause of religion and humanity .The more they work the less they feel satisfied. Having set up a very high standard of efficiency for their work they fell nervous that indolence may not make it impossible for them to attain those heights.”\n\n“If anyone of them is praised for piety, virtuousness and the good deeds done by him, he does not like to be so complimented; he is afraid that such praise may not allure him towards vanity, self-flattery, and self-glorification. He says, I know my mind and my work more than others, and God knows much more than me.\n\nO Lord! Please do not hold me responsible for what they have said about me. You know very well that I did not instigate them for such praises. Please Lord! Grant me excellence far greater than what they complimented me for. And Lord! Please forgive those of my sins short-comings which they do not know.”\n\n“You will find every pious person possessing the following attributes. He is resolute though tender-hearted and kind. He is unwavering in his convictions and beliefs. He is thirsty for knowledge. He forgives those who harmed him, fully knowing that they have wronged him. Even when owning wealth his ways of life are based upon moderation. His prayers are models of humility and submissiveness to God. Even when starving he will maintain his self-respect. He will bear sufferings patiently.”\n\n“He will resort only to honest means of living. Leading others towards truth and justice, will give him pleasure. He disdains avarice and greed. Though he does good deeds all the time, yet he feels nervous of his short-comings. Every night, he thanks God for having passed one more day under His Grace and Mercy.\n\nEvery morning finds him starting the day with the prayers of the Lord. Of nights he is cautious that he may not carelessly waste those hours in comfort and ease. He starts his days happy with the thought the Lord has given him another day to do his duty.”\n\n“If his mind wishes for something unholy and impious he refuses to obey its dictates. He desires to achieve eternal bliss. Worldly pleasures do not interest him. His wisdom is mixed with patience. His deeds reciprocate his words (he does what he says). Inordinate desires do not trouble him. He has few defects in him. He is courteous to others.\n\nHe possesses a contended mind. He eats little, he does not harm anybody. He is easy to be pleased. He is strong in his faith. His passions are dead. His temper is controlled.”\n\n“People expect good out of him and consider themselves immune from his harm. Even if he is found among godless people his name will be written in the list of Godly persons. If he is in company of those who always remember God, naturally his name will not be included amongst those who forget Him. He forgives those who harm him. He helps those who have forsaken him and have refused to help him.\n\nHe is kind to those who have been cruel to him. He does good to those who do evil to him. He never indulges in loose talks. He has no vice in him, and his good qualities are outstanding, noticeable, and prominent, when facing dangers and disasters he is calm and undisturbed. In sufferings and calamities he is patient and hopeful. In prosperity he is thankful to God. He would not harm his worst enemy. He will never commit a sin even for the sake of his best friend.”\n\n“Before anybody has to bear testimony to his fault he accepts and owns it. He never misappropriates anything entrusted to him. He never forgets what he has been told. He does not slander anybody. He does not harm his neighbors.\n\nWhen misfortunes befall any person he does not blame him, neither is he happy at the losses of others. He neither goes astray from the right path nor follows a wrong one. His silence does not indicate, his moroseness nor his laughters are loud and boisterous.\n\nHe bears persecution patiently and God punishes his oppressor. He is hard to himself and very lenient to others. He bears hardships in this life to attain eternal comfort and peace. He never wrongs a fellow being. If he avoids anybody it is to retain his piety and uprightness. If he forms contract with anybody it is on account of his kindness and clemency.\n\nHe does not avoid anybody because of his pride and vanity, and he does not mix with others with ulterior motives of hypocrisy, pretense, and vile.”\n\nThe Youth\n\nThe Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi is very observant about the youth and always receives them with open arms and opens face to face dialogues with them. The youth also consider the Grand Jurist as a trusted and wise counselor who always gives his whole attention to their problems and needs.\n\nWith regards to the youth, the Grand Jurist has said: “In our modern age, which is titled as the age of information and technology, the crime rates have risen and we need to take care of the youth. We need to promote the public education and make the youth familiar with the bulk of the Prophet’s Household culture. We need to create an obstacle between the youth and the deceptive misleading paths, such as the deviating schools of thought, the satanic teachings, and the corrupt propaganda of this age.”\n\nAdditionally, the Grand Jurist always puts strong stress on the youth, when speaking to his representatives and deputies across the world. With full knowledge of the undeniable role of the youth in ushering the world into a better future, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi always instructs his representatives and office members to attract the youth and help them with their needs and problems.\n\nIn one of his addresses to the Islamic preachers, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi stated:\n\n“Pay attention to the teenagers and the youth. Bring them together and teach them the Islamic principles, the Islamic beliefs, the Islamic morals and the Islamic laws. Make them familiar with the conducts of the pure Household and answer their numerous questions. Encourage them to engage in cultural, religious and social activism so that they are kept away from the corrupt and immoral currents and waves.”\n\nImam Sadiq, peace be upon him, also states: “Take care of the youth, because they are the quickest in all goodness.”\n\nIn another gathering of the Islamic preachers, the Grand Ayatollah Shirazi emphasized on making the youth familiar with the genuine Islamic beliefs and said: “Protect the youth and try to bring them up with the faith in God, the holy Prophet of Islam and his pure Household. Help them to add to their pool of knowledge about the doctrine of the Prophet’s Household. We are responsible to introduce the Islamic Prophet and his pure Household to the youth using the same lexicon which was employed by the holy Quran and the Household. We should do away with all extremes and exaggerations. There are certain lexicons used by the enemies of Islam who try to describe the holy Household in a way to exaggerate or downsize their real positions in public.”\n\nThen, the Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi continued:\n\n“We are not allowed to give even one of the divine attributes to the pure Household. Instead, we must make the youth familiar with the absolute and solid facts about the pure Household, such as their infallibility and their knowledge of the unseen.”\n\nThe Thirst for the Culture of the Household\n\nThe youth have a strong thirst for the culture of the Prophet’s Household and all they need are the people who can lead them to this path and make them familiar with this sublime and inspiring culture.\n\nAnyone off the road to guidance is like a sick person. The sick people, sometimes, fail to understand the instructions of their doctors, however the doctors are duty bound to take into consideration the needs and the cure of the people who have gone off the road to the genuine Islam.\n\nA while ago, a young person, who had lost the way to guidance, came to me. I talked and unfolded to him some of the precious quotes of the holy Infallibles and the verses of the holy Quran. After a few minutes, I saw him shedding tears and expressing his remorse for what he had done in the past. I told him what’s done is done and that he should repent from all his past mistakes and start a new leaf, but he told me that he feels ashamed. These were the feelings of a young person who didn’t have a sound belief in God but in just a few minutes, he developed such a deep insight of the Almighty God that made him feel the presence of his Lord.\n\nThe Youth and Islamic Sciences\n\nThe Grand Jurist Ayatollah Shirazi, in all of his meetings with the youth, invites all young and motivated minds to join the ranks of Imam Mahdi, may the "
