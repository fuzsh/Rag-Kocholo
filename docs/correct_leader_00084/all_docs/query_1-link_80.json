        "text": "Prince Abd al-Ilah ibn Ali delivers a speech to the Iraqi people on the occasion of the end of his regency. Jalila is afraid the prince would get killed after finding a young man in the garden while King Faisal prepares to reach the Senate.\n\nThe prince is angry at the discovery of the child in the garden and orders the officers to investigate the matter, while his wife, Jalila, calms down a little, despite the sadness of King Faisal for her.\n\nThe communists gather in the bar to talk about the affairs of the country, while King Faisal asks the prince to stand by him until he understands how to run the government.\n\nThe daughter of Abu Jaafar (Jaafar's father) frequently visits the palace. The Saudi King and a Turkish delegation arrive in Baghdad to congratulate King Faisal on his assumption of the throne of Iraq, and a banquet is held in his honor.\n\nAs Kawthar is accepted into the University of Baghdad, her father objects to her going there because of the foreign teachers from the colonizing country. King Faisal gets sick after the party ends and everyone works to make him comfortable.\n\nAhmed Bey goes to the palace to meet the king and presents him with the files of the prisoners who have faced the police. Abadiya checks on King Faisal after hearing Abd al-Ilah quarrel with him because the king wants to appoint young men to head the ministries.\n\nAs Jaafar goes to visit his father, Kawthar receives him at the request of her mother, while his father quarrels with him for opposing his reactionary ideas. King Faisal wanders with Ahmed Bey in the desert, and he convinces him to appoint new ministers.\n\nKing Faisal meets with Atta Sabri, a fine art teacher, who is drawing a beautiful painting, and the king admires it very much. Jaafar tells his friend that his father works in the Rihab Palace.\n\nAbu Jaafar goes to his first wife and stays with her all day, but he quarrels with his son Jaafar, while Kawthar wonders why her mother married Abu Jaafar.\n\nAhmed Bey proposes to the king to dissolve the government because it does not conflict with the parliament, and to take new measures related to governance, much to Abd al-Ilah's anger. Badiah sadly bids farewell to her husband, who travels to Egypt.\n\nJaafar meets his friend at his home and talks about party matters, while the relationship between King Faisal and his uncle Abd al-Ilah is strained due to his tendency to change the system of government to a republican one.\n\nHussein tells his wife, Badiah, that he does not trust Abd al-Ilah, especially since he is ruling Iraq from behind the scenes, despite King Faisal's aspiration for reforms and regime change.\n\nJaafar goes with his father to the palace to meet King Faisal to find a job there, while the king reconciles with Prince Abd al-Ilah and agrees to all his orders regarding ministries and the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nThe Pasha requests the appointment of Abdul-Wahab Mirjan as President of the Chamber of Deputies, but he resigns, while Mr. Khalil is appointed.\n\nAs King Faisal celebrates Jaafar and his father, he promises Jaafar to appoint him to the palace as soon as he finishes his studies. The Pasha quarrels with Prince Abd al-Ilah, and the King tries to smoothen things between them.\n\nThe officers are preparing for a revolution against the regime, and Jaafar is affiliated with the Ba'ath party and is asked to enter the palace and get some information.\n\nYassin and the rest of his colleagues meet at the newspaper's headquarters and talk about supporting the Ba'ath party to get rid of the monarchy, while Jaafar tries to get close to a girl who works in the palace to provide him with the information he wants.\n\nAfter some dams break, a great flood sweeps Baghdad, drowning many areas and forcing residents to leave their homes for fear of drowning, so King Faisal orders the army to intervene immediately.\n\nAbu Jaafar supervises the cooking of food for the families who were displaced from their homes due to the floods, while Umm Jaafar cooks. Prince Abd al-Ilah becomes addicted to alcohol and King Faisal grieves for him.\n\nJaafar is injured while helping soldiers prevent water from flowing into Baghdad, and when King Faisal learns of the news, he is honored and given an honorary medal.\n\nFadda's mother seeks to marry off her daughter to King Faisal. New elections are held to appoint deputies to the new council, but fraud takes place in the elections.\n\nAs Jaafar meets Kawthar in the garden more than once, she confesses her love for him. The Pasha is afraid of the concentration of parties in Parliament, but Ahmed reassures him that Prince Abd al-Ilah is still in control.\n\nPrince Abd al-Ilah proposes to King Faisal to marry Ahmed's daughter, but he refuses because she is an alcoholic, while her relationship with Jaafar strengthens and they become friends.\n\nThe Pasha decides to dissolve the party and asks the king to dissolve Parliament, which the latter accepts. Umm Jaafar agrees to Kawthar's betrothal to her son."
