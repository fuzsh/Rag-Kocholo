        "text": "Save as PDF\n\nWhat is happening to the name of some Adam Matthew Digital databases?\n\nThe provider Adam Matthew Digital has changed the name of a few databases.\n\nTherefore, we will be changing those databases names in the Knowledgebase. The content of the databases, and their database ID's , will remain the same.\n\nThis change will take effect on July 13, 2023:\n\nDB ID Current Collection Name New Collection Name ABLUG Foreign Office Files for the Middle East, 1979-1981: The Iranian Revolution and the Iran-Iraq War Foreign Office Files for the Middle East III ACLOV Foreign Office Files for the Middle East, 1975-1978: The Lebanese Civil War and the Camp David Accords Foreign Office Files for the Middle East II ACMNA History of Mass Tourism Leisure, Travel & Mass Culture: The History of Tourism ACQZR AM Scholar: Area Studies Japan Already Updated - For more info:\n\nhttps://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/...e_--_June_2023 ACVGI J.
