The majority of the material concerns the so-called \"classic period\" of the 16th to 18th centuries. In addition to these classic texts, the archive includes:\n\nAnti-persecution writings\n\nWorks by penologists\n\nLegal and church documents\n\nExpos√©s of persecutions\n\nPhilosophical writings\n\nTranscripts of trials\n\nExorcisms\n\nThe majority of these texts, sourced from the Cornell University library, are in Latin, English and German, although there are also selected items in French, Italian, Portuguese, Danish, Dutch, and Spanish.
