        "text": "Primary sources are materials that provide first hand testimony or direct evidence concerning a topic under investigation. They are created by the individuals who either witnessed or experienced the events or conditions being documented. Generally, primary sources are created at the time when the events or conditions occurred, but can also be created later if based on first hand experiences. Primary sources enable you to get as close as possible to understanding the lived experiences of others and discovering what actually happened during an event or time period.\n\nExamples:\n\ndiaries\n\ncorrespondence\n\nphotographs and illustrations\n\nmaps\n\nnewspaper articles from the time period\n\nmanuscripts\n\npamphlets\n\nbroadsides, posters and other ephemera\n\nautobiographical materials\n\ninterview or speech transcripts\n\noral histories\n\ngovernment documents (laws, bills, proceedings, acts, census records, etc.)\n\nâ€‹Context is everything: distinguishing between the three types of sources (primary, secondary and tertiary) will vary according to context and situation. For example, if you are analyzing how African American history was depicted in middle school textbooks in the 1980s, then the textbooks would be considered a primary source rather than a tertiary one.\n\nPrimary sources vary by discipline: different disciplines define primary sources differently. This is because the artifact considered to be a primary or original source varies by discipline. For instance, in the sciences a primary source is one that describes or presents original research, experiments or discoveries. These are often published as journal articles, which in other disciplines are considered secondary sources.\n\nDiscipline Primary Source Art creative artifacts: drawings, paintings, sculpture etc. Music sheet music, recordings English play, poem or novel Political Science treaties, congressional record Sciences report/article documenting an original experiment/study Film/Television script, video recording, film"
