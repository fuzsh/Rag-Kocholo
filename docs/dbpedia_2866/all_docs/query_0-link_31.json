From webinars and subject guides to course and research alignment, our product specialists connect you with the relevant content in AM databases to maximise your experience.\n\nCourse alignment\n\nWe recognise that it can take time to get to know newly acquired e-resources and to understand how they might be useful within specific research and teaching.\n\nWe offer a free course and research alignment service connecting you with relevant content from AM titles based on your research or teaching programme.\n\nWebinar: Digital Humanities with AM\n\nIn this webinar, Dr Ben Lacey, Head of Engagement, provides an overview of how you can use your AM collections for Digital Humanities scholarship. It includes a case study of one project that used a full-text data set, and examples of how instructors have applied the content of these collections in a more introductory way, focusing on digital presentation of student work.\n\nWatch the webinar"
