        "text": "Managing Director, Adam Matthew Digital\n\nby Tom Gilson (Associate Editor, Against the Grain) <gilsont@cofc.edu>\n\nand Katina Strauch (Editor, Against the Grain) <kstrauch@comcast.net>\n\nATG: Khal, when Adam Matthew Digital (AM Digital) became part of the SAGE Group a few years ago, you told us that growing new markets and expanding your product portfolio were the key considerations for you in making the deal. Have your expectations been met? In what ways? Has anything not worked out the way you thought it would?\n\nKR: My expectations have definitely been met. We have grown our customer base by circa 150%, sell into more countries around the world and work with far more consortia. When we became part of SAGE in 2012 we had 46 individual products and we now have a growing portfolio currently at 128 titles. We have created a new product range, Research Source for extensive faculty and postgrad research, and a subscription product AM Explorer, that provides access for the smaller or less well funded institutions. We have increased our staff numbers from 30 people to over 100, with staff based all over the world from Sydney to Beijing to Austin. The only area that didn’t fit our plans as expected was the ability to easily fill an existing reps bag with AM Digital products — we realized that specialist sales people were required to sell our products.\n\nATG: By all appearances, AM Digital operates independently from SAGE. Is that a fair assessment? Can you describe the relationship between AM Digital and SAGE? How has it evolved over the years? Why do you think it works?\n\nKR: Adam Matthew Digital and SAGE have always shared a common set of values and approaches to publishing which is why both parties were so eager to secure a deal and why it has been a very positive and productive experience. The Directors and Senior Management team at AM Digital run the company as an independent subsidiary with some of the SAGE executive committee sitting on the AM Digital board. I think both companies have learnt from each other and I really enjoy being on SAGE’s Global Vice President Group where I get a 360 view of the entire SAGE organization and can engage with colleagues from around the world.\n\nATG: The formation of partnerships with libraries, archives, and heritage institutions seems to be an essential element in AM Digital’s approach. Can you tell us more about those partnerships and they how they work? What part do they play in your business strategy?\n\nKR: We are proud to work with many of the world’s leading libraries, archives and research institutions, many of whom we work with long-term, across multiple projects. Partners such as the Newberry Library, Chicago; the British Library; the The National Archives, UK or the New York Public Library have worked with us over decades and we work closely and sensitively with such partners to develop a strategic partnership that works symbiotically with their own digitization strategy. Other partners may offer only a small selection of material within a single broader thematic product. For smaller institutions this offers an opportunity to have material digitized for free and a welcome financial boost that is often deployed towards other open access initiatives.\n\nOur strong relationships with our archival partners are maintained long after the digitization process has completed; and whether the archive is contributing a small amount to a multi-archive resource, or is the sole partner providing hundreds of thousands of pages, our commitment to working with those archives, listening to their concerns and ensuring that the best possible result is achieved remains\n\nATG: Speaking of partnerships and business strategies, we would be remiss if we didn’t ask you how the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted AM Digital. What adjustments have you had to make? Have you added new primary source collections this year?\n\nKR: Our industry has been impacted on many levels. We are a global company and our inability to travel to meet with partners, colleagues and customers has been challenging. Many archives that we should now be working with and onsite assessing their material or digitizing their content are still closed. Universities around the world are facing budget the same.\n\ncuts on a scale we have not seen before. Despite all of these challenges, we are an agile business and I’m immensely proud of how our staff have adapted to working from home and yet still engaged on a global scale with webinars, virtual conferences, video conferencing etc. Importantly we will publish over 90% of our frontlist this year. 2021/22 will see a reduced frontlist as these products are huge undertakings that take years to publish. The global pandemic will have an impact on our finely tuned production process but important content that we know the community wants will still be delivered and we aim to be back to maximum output by 2023. We can also see how our products are needed more than ever in a world of remote and blended learning and we are investing now for the future increased demand.\n\nATG: AM Digital has developed Quartex, a platform designed to help libraries, archives, and other heritage institutions create their own digital collections. Can you tell us how about it? Do all of your customers have access to the platform? What benefits does it provide to its users?\n\nKR: AM Digital has always invested heavily in new technology and we are doing so again as we develop the new software we use to build, publish and host our next generation of products. This software is licensed, as Quartex, to libraries and archives around the world,\n\ncontinued on page 53\n\nenabling them to benefit from our expertise and giving them access to the same functionality we offer in AM Digital products, so they can easily and affordably create their own online collections and exhibitions. All AM Digital customers will benefit from the new platform’s performance and enhanced features as we build new and migrate existing products onto it. Libraries and archives will have to pay an annual fee if they want the opportunity to build their own digital collections using Quartex, and benefit from exciting features we’ve developed to improve search and accessibility, such as Handwritten Text Recognition and in-platform generation of A/V transcriptions and closed captioning.\n\nATG: What about future primary source collections? Are there particular research themes, historic time periods or geographic regions that warrant the development of additional primary source collections? What can we expect from AM Digital in the next 3-5 years?\n\nKR: We have many exciting projects in the pipeline, and given the complexity of large-scale digitization projects and the time they take to bring to fruition, our editorial development team are always working anywhere from three to seven years into the future. Our product development strategy tries to balance a provision of our long-term programmes — such as Archives Direct, which makes available UK foreign policy documents — with keeping abreast of emerging subject areas. Areas of study that are getting us excited at the moment include Animal Studies, Sports History, Environmental History and Latinx Studies. In a broader sense, a key focus for future product development is trying to find ways to highlight under-represented and hidden voices in the archives. Quite rightly, the community we serve is clamouring for this kind of content; showcasing it and doing it justice is the next exciting challenge for us.\n\nATG: Khal, our readers are also interested in the personal side of things, so we have to ask, what you like to do in your down time? Last time we spoke you said you liked to attend music festivals and that you were an avid supporter of the Arsenal football club. Is that still the case? Have any new interests cropped up?\n\nKR: My latest hobby that was fueled by the lockdown is cycling on my electric mountain bike. We live in the beautiful Cotswolds (West of England) and there are so many hills, woodlands, bridleways and paths to explore. The electric assistance doesn’t stop you working out, it just means you can go further and more quickly and explore woods that with pure peddle power would be off limits! I’ve really appreciated for the first time in years how lucky we are to live here and now get out as often as I can to explore. My wife has also bought one so we often go out together. I’ve also discovered Reformer Pilates which uses spring based machinery to work your core and specific muscle groups. This is fantastic as I get older and still try and play soccer once a week! For my sins I’m still a season ticket holder at Arsenal. If anyone wants to understand my addiction and a time that I got into it (in the early 1980s) then please read Nick Hornby’s seminal novel Fever Pitch.\n\nIMF Research At No Charge!

Who will remember most of us? Beyond, I mean, colleagues with whom we’ve worked, or even someone who remembers an anecdote that can elicit nods of appreciation or laughter at a dinner party (at a table, socially distant, or on Zoom).\n\nYou can make the footprint case for some groups quite easily. Professors, obviously, are remembered by the graduate students and post-docs they’ve trained, even by undergraduates, and, for much longer, for archived journal articles and books they’ve put their names to.\n\nQuestions about leaving behind can come down to “where” and (mainly) “how.” Painters, sculptors, photographers, etc. have museums. Movie stars, musicians, writers, now leave behind digital archives in one form or another. Statistics accumulated by professional athletes are recorded for posterity; there’s a ton of film celebrating their careers and the games they played in. Some political and national leaders will be remembered forever. Books and articles will be written about some of these people, but as the millennia roll by, the biographies of only a very few exceptionable people, particularly those who created something lasting or made enormously consequential decisions, or of evil people who murdered millions, will be of interest.\n\nPeople with jobs in publishing can do wonderful work and be recognized for it during their tenure, but, I dare say, most of them will be forgotten eventually, although I do notice that at the bottom of the copyright page in one of my handbooks published by Elsevier, there are the names of the publisher, acquisitions editor, editorial project manager, production project manager, and designer. And this isn’t to say that there aren’t those who seek enduring credit. When I joined Wiley in the mid1970s, there was friend-\n\nly competition among the top brass about who had signed up Haliday and Resnick, the blockbuster physics textbook, which is still going strong.\n\nAs long as pension deposits are made on time, there are some who don’t care about having left any footprints. A friend who acquitted himself quite well during his publishing tenure has zero interest in news and gossip about the industry or even the company where he worked.\n\nOthers stay involved. After his retirement from Wiley, Dick Rudick, the company’s general counsel, remained active on the intellectual property front, notably as vice chairman of the Copyright Clearance Center.\n\nHaving your name on the company helps in keeping your name alive, of course. After I left Wiley, I used to get calls every so often from industry watchdogs as to whether I thought the Wileys would be willing to sell their company. (There were two classes of shares, and voting shares were in the family’s hands, so selling would be up to them.) I knew people who would answer the question in the affirmative. My answer was always the opposite. “If they were to sell,” I’d say, “they’d just be these rich people. But if they keep the company, then they’re still ‘the Wileys.’”\n\nOne of the most chilling things anyone ever said to me was at the Oyster Bar in Grand Central Station. I was eating lunch at the counter with a headhunter friend. We’d have lunch from time to time, whenever my friend wanted to keep in touch with a potential client or for no other reason than we seemed to enjoy each other’s company. This time, however, we were talking about my difficulties in “managing up,” something I wasn’t always good at, how no one was protecting me, and how likely it was that I was about to get fired. After I did get fired, even though the division I ran was doing well on a financial basis, I put together a narrative that, I suppose, was intended to comfort me. Part of the story involves the possibility of leaving footprints and how your superiors can sometimes react.\n\nI’d been featured in a story in Publishers Weekly about new initiatives at Wiley and had been elected to the OCLC Board of Trustees as the first publishing industry representative. I surmised that my boss hadn’t been entirely happy about any of that recognition. And when I’d asked my boss’s boss, Wiley’s president, who was basically an industry outsider, to give a talk to a group of senior publishers, she said she would consider the invitation if I wrote her speech. My dislike of this woman surfaced and I demurred, probably with a look that said, “write your own damn speech.” I can’t remember for certain why my headhunter friend said what he did — perhaps he was giving me fair warning and wanted me to be realistic about my prospects — but here it is: “the day after you’re gone, it will be like you were never there.” (Actually, I’ve been a Wiley author for over 50 years, so my name hasn’t been rubbed out.)\n\nNo one should have to consider such a thing. Instead, try thinking of yourself, for example, in terms of what Karen Hunter accomplished during her three plus decades at Elsevier. I talked recently about Karen with John Tagler, whom I got to know when he was in charge of the Professional and Scholarly Publishing Division at the Association of American Publishers. Before that stint, John worked with Karen during a good part of his time at Elsevier from 1977 to 2008.\n\nI contacted John in mid June of this year, but it took until late August before he and I were able to talk. In the spring, he was hit with the Coronavirus so hard that he spent four weeks on a ventilator, which badly damaged his throat, more weeks in NYU Hospital, and more time after that in rehab. But he was home and getting around his apartment when he emailed me the number of his cell phone I reached him on it.\n\nHe told me that he and Karen began to work together in the late 1990s. That was when journals were going online. In 1994-1996 journal tapes had been loaded locally on library systems. By 1997 the Internet and web browsers enabled remote continued on page 55\n\nDSM-5® and essential new resources are available for students and practitioners\n\nPsychiatryOnline.org offers the most comprehensive online access available for psychiatric textbooks, journals and professional development tools including DSM-5 and The American Journal of Psychiatry.

Two years later, Elsevier decided to create complete archives for its journals. The project didn’t go smoothly. It took three years to round up all the paper copies, and early scans didn’t work perfectly. But, as we all know, the project was completed successfully.\n\nEarly in Karen’s Elsevier career, in the 1970s, John said, she was basically a right hand for James Kels, Elsevier’s chairman. In 1977-78, she was involved in acquiring major medical journals in OBGYN, gastroenterology, and cardiology. These were big society journals and involved different kinds of operations compared to what had been needed for the much smaller journals that Elsevier had been publishing in the U.S.\n\nWhat made Karen Hunter famous was how she approached her work on Science Direct and other digital initiatives, and how others appreciated that work. “Karen was amazing in her knowledge,” John said. She knew about both technical and intellectual property issues. I witnessed her expertise firsthand. Others have remarked on this, of course. “Knowing her stuff inside-out [including about library services — she was trained in library science at Syracuse], was one of the things that attracted librarians to her,” John said. “She was the only one librarians really liked.”\n\nI knew Karen and worked with her a bit. She was sociable and likeable, open and giving. She was fun and she was wicked smart. She loved jazz. (Me too.) I can still see that big smile when something delighted her. Karen retired in December 2010, as Elsevier’s Senior Vice President of Global Academic & Customer Relations, and died a couple of years ago.\n\nKaren had a tremendous positive influence on Elsevier and on the scholarly publishing industry. There are footprints: the list of publishing industry initiatives and projects Karen had a strong hand in is long; Elsevier Library Connect sponsors the Hunter Forum at ALA Midwinter Meetings. There’s stuff about her, and in her own voice, on the Internet. It’s inspirational.\n\nRumors\n\nfrom page 36\n\n9/3/2020 11:29:08 AM\n\nlaptop, with optional use of mobile phones or Oculus devices to go further with the augmented reality.

In describing the makerspace at The Citadel, Hawkins told of the services being offered, equipment available, and how the makerspace fits with the library’s mission, including the value of offering students and faculty the opportunity to learn new technologies. After defining augmented reality versus virtual reality, van Arnhem specified a variety of equipment, such as headsets, available for participating in the technology and considered how libraries may best choose what could work in their circumstances. She showed a project developed by an art student. All the speakers conveyed an energy and engagement with interactive content that confirmed the potential for use within the academic curriculum.\n\nCommunicating Collections: Strategies for Informing Library Stakeholders of Collections Budget & Management Decisions — Presented by John Abresch (University of South Florida), Laura Pascual (University of South Florida), Anna Seiffert (Colorado School of Mines) — https://sched.co/UXry\n\nReported by Chris Vidas (Clemson University) <cvidas@clemson.edu>\n\nIt was enlightening to hear the perspectives of librarians from two very different institutions addressing unique problems regarding the ways in which libraries communicate with stakeholders, specifically surrounding collections decisions. Abresch and Pascual discussed some of the findings from a survey of 25 academic libraries and how those institutions convey collection management decisions via their websites. Pascual highlighted many of the hurdles that arise when attempting to share relevant details about building collections. Not only is it complicated to reach the proper audience or to utilize an effective method for disseminating information, but it can be problematic to determine which details are most effective to share. Ultimately, they concluded that information should be publicized, including collection development policies, e-resources decisions, and cancellation telling their own stories. These virtual reality experiences tend\n\ninformation. The goal should be to become as transparent as possible. Seiffert described a truly daunting situation at the Colorado School of Mines in which she initially had no formal liaison program, no communication with departments, and no continued on page 57\n\nfeedback from faculty. Using an array of usage and expenditure reports and by comparing data with peer institutions, she was eventually able to enhance the way in which she communicated with faculty, and she began to make inroads where they had not previously existed. Her progress suggests that any communication void can be overcome with the proper data and when an appropriate outreach strategy is implemented in order to appeal to a specific audience, although it could vary between institutions. Each of the presenters offered valuable details to help attendees improve the manner in which collections decisions are shared with all types of library stakeholders. (The session’s slides can be found in Sched.)\n\nA Comparison and Review of 17 E-Book Platforms — Presented by John Lavender (Lavender Consulting), Courtney McAllister (moderator, Yale University, Lillian Goldman Law Library) — https://sched.co/UXrg\n\nReported by Ramune K. Kubilius (Northwestern University, Galter Health Sciences Library & Learning Center) <r-kubilius@northwestern.edu>\n\nMcAllister introduced the session whose abstract lists the scope of the undertaking Lavender undertook at the behest of the University of Michigan Press, with support from the Mellon Foundation. (The presentation slides, attached in the SCHED provide much more granular detail that could not be appreciated in viewing presentation slides in the large session room). Functionality, not content, was the focus of the study. Some of the features sought and analyzed included: filtering, browsing, search prediction, highlighting of terms, ranking, indexing, downloading by chapter or book. Not all eBook platforms licensed by (or familiar to) audience members were represented in this study, but it still served as a reminder to all that these platforms are scrutinized, analyzed, and compared against others. (Lavender’s slides are available in Sched.)\n\nThe time has come…for next generation open access models — Presented by Anneliese Taylor (University of California, San Francisco), Celeste Feather (LYRASIS), Kim Armstrong (Big Ten Academic Alliance), Sara Rouhi (Public Library of Science) — https://sched.co/UXrL\n\nReported by Lindsay Barnett (Cushing/Whitney Medical Library, Yale University School of Medicine) <lindsay.barnett@yale.edu>\n\nThis session explored multiple open access models, followed by a discussion of challenges and opportunities.\n\nRouhi detailed specific challenges faced by native open access publishers, stating that flipping subscription dollars to open access funds is not possible for publishers with no subscription revenue. The Public Library of Science (PLos) is considering new funding models such as bundled APCs and annual billing, moving away from individual APC transactions.\n\nTaylor listed negotiation with publishers on open access agreements as a core principle of University of California’s (UC) Call to Action. She acknowledged that read and publish agreements disadvantage native open access publishers and central APC funding may influence where authors submit their articles. UC San Francisco is in discussion with PLoS about a multi-payer model in which libraries and authors, through grant funds, share APC costs.\n\nFeather noted the diversity of LYRASIS members in type, size, and goals. An open access model must appeal to all members to be successful. Consortia should develop diverse scenarios that fit each type of content and institution.\n\nArmstrong described the Big Ten Academic Alliance as 14 independent universities each with their own governing system. Big Ten is taking a measured approach, working to understand institutional goals and exploring emerging models.

Kendall (Michigan State University Libraries), Ramune Kubilius (Northwestern University), Sarah McClung (University of California, San Francisco), Jean Gudenas (Medical University of South Carolina), Rena Lubker (moderator, Medical University of South Carolina) — https://sched.co/UYCv\n\nNote: This sponsored session took place off-site and was open to all. Registration was requested. Wendy Bahnsen gave words of greeting from lunch sponsor, Rittenhouse Book Distributors.\n\nReported by Nathan Norris (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) <nnorris@bidmc.harvard.edu>\n\nLubker served as moderator for the session on “things that keep us up at night,” library expansions, and considerations for moving toward “read and publish” agreements. To answer “what things keep us up at night,” Kendall concluded that our collections mix has become more complicated, and our users live in a “re-mix culture,” in which they desire a myriad of content re-use capabilities. She discussed how assessment has become more sophisticated and referred to the Bibliomagician Blog, DORA, and principles of the Leiden Manifesto as contributors. Kendall also asserted we must be flexible and rely on our values. Kubilius provided the annual “Developments” update and handout containing the major events from the publishing world from the past year. Gudenas described how she was able to quickly extend her subscriptions at the Medical University of South Carolina when her institution purchased four hospitals. She contributed her success to effective communication. Gudenas created ad hoc communication workflows and stressed the importance of including hospital administrators. McClung reported on a unique scenario at the University of California, San Francisco, as a participant in the California Digital Library (CDL). The faculty are particularly supportive of OA, and faculty have even been included in vendor negotiations there. The CDL has continued on page 58\n\nsigned a single “read and publish” agreement with Cambridge University Press. While they have not yet been able to sign a similar agreement with Elsevier, McClung believes the CDL remains open. (Kubilius’ handout is in the Galter IR, DOI 10.18131/g3yvaf-3330 and will be deposited in the conference proceedings.)\n\nLIVELY DISCUSSIONS THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 2019\n\nDo the Right Thing: Sustainability, Values, and Streaming Video — Presented by Trey Shelton (University of Florida), Sarah McCleskey (Hofstra University), Alex Hoskyns-Abrahall (Bullfrog Films) — https://sched.co/ UZR2\n\nReported by Christine Fischer (UNC Greensboro) <cmfische@uncg.edu>\n\nMcCleskey described the need for budget predictability in an environment with many acquisition models for streaming content. While tending to purchase life of file licenses, McCleskey pointed out the necessity of meeting the needs of the academic curriculum through purchasing one- or three-year licenses or subscriptions. She seeks to contribute to the revenue stream for content creators and distributors. Shelton stated that he prioritizes owning films in perpetuity, while acknowledging that libraries are faced with balancing between building a collection versus access and serving immediate academic needs; he stated that there is no clear path forward. He touched on the issue of lack of metadata and the challenges of discovery for library users. From the perspective of a film company and distributor, Hoskyns-Abrahall talked about filmmakers as activists and films creating change by educating the public. The role of the distributor is getting films noticed through promotion and marketing, arranging for showings at film festivals, securing reviews, and curating collections. Discussion with the audience touched on topics such as commercial streaming services that offer individual subscriptions and the question of use of those services in the classroom.\n\nLet’s give them something to talk about… Textbook Affordability and OER — Presented by Derek Malone (University of North Alabama), Linda Colding (Florida Gulf Coast University), Jennifer L. Pate (University of North Alabama), Peggy Glatthaar (Florida Gulf Coast University) — https://sched.co/UZRl\n\nReported by Cori Wilhelm (SUNY Canton) <wilhelmc@canton.edu>\n\nThis session highlighted textbook affordability initiatives at two academic libraries. Pate and Malone described an Alabama Commission on Higher Education state-funded grant which served as the springboard for both UNA’s textbook affordability project and an OER initiative. Because there is not currently an OER for all courses, the library established a textbook reserve program, focusing on the highest enrollment classes when selecting textbooks for purchase. At FCGU, librarians started a textbook affordability project focusing on loaning textbooks for courses with the highest DFW rates. They also solicited student input — some creative takeaways include FGCU’s use of a whiteboard for student textbook purchase suggestions and an online fillable form for the same. As Colding and Glatthaar explained, FGCU administration initially provided funding for the program, which has not been renewed. This led to conversations about sustainability of textbook programs, and alternatives when there isn’t funding available.\n\nAudience members added much to the presentation by contributing questions and experiences from their own institutions, sparking lively discussion between the presenters and audience, and between audience members themselves. Ideas were enthusiastically shared regarding using eBooks, how these programs work with existing courseware, and the sustainability of such textbook affordability initiatives.\n\nCONCURRENTS THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 2019\n\nNever Waste a Crisis: Re-imaging Interlibrary Loan as Part of the Resourcing Picture — Presented by Rice Majors (University of California – Davis), Kelley Johnson (Griffith University) — https://sched.co/UXu9\n\nReported by Rob Tench (Old Dominion University) <ftench@odu.edu>\n\nThe presenters expertly addressed two of the thorniest issues facing interlibrary loan/document delivery departments: migration to Tipasa and the effects of breaking a Big Deal. Johnson outlined the step by step process her library undertook over three years to implement Tipasa. Migration involved a lot of trial and error, an organizational restructure, and workers assuming new duties. Policies had to be updated, software tools implemented, and multiple workarounds developed to meet users’ needs during the transition. Among the many lessons learned were that disruption can be great when done right, assumptions should always be questioned, accountability needs to be built into the process, and failure is a learning opportunity. Above all, she counseled the audience to be patient but mindful that the future is now. In contrast, Majors and his team developed a plan to address the expected increased demand of ILL services as a result of the UC system cancelling Elsevier’s Science Direct. Challenges included translating previous downloads of Science Direct articles into ILL requests, overcoming patron uncertainty about how to place ILL requests, developing patron support for the cancellation decision, coordinating requests across multiple campuses with divergent needs, providing 24/7 access in a Monday through Friday business model, and being copyright compliant. To address these issues, a system-wide task force is looking at ways to enhance ILL operations with decisions being driven in large part by ILL usage. Both presentations were outstanding — highly informative and extremely well received. continued on page 59\n\n“…of research workflows - and changing roles - and the challenges it brings” — Presented by Anne Rauh (Syracuse University), Vincent Cassidy (Institution of Engineering and Technology), Emily Hart (Syracuse University), — https://sched.co/UXtZ\n\nReported by Lynnee Argabright (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Information and Library Science) <lynneeargabright@gmail.com>\n\nThis session impressively approached author services from the perspective of a publisher — specifically, a society publisher — and a library in their efforts to become embedded throughout the researcher workflow. The presenters packed their slides full of valuable information and takeaways; a favorite was a visualization showing where author services had been applied to the research workflow in the case of IET and Syracuse University Library. Cassidy rapidly explained six slides on a researcher usage study in six minutes, which was far too interesting to crush into that time, so individual review of the poster presentation slides (in Sched) and the video recording is highly recommended. Syracuse librarians Hart and Rauh highlighted the value of shaping librarian roles based on their specialized skills rather than generalist support for a discipline.\n\nOverall, the presenters conveyed their roles’ challenges, efforts to learn, and processes decided upon to become supportive, competitive, and connected. The changes both institutions rolled out can be models for turning a problem on its head, facing risk, and flexibly adapting to changing needs. (The session’s slides can be found in Sched.)\n\nTrot So Quick: Addressing Budgetary Changes — Presented by Jeff Bailey (Arkansas State), Star Holloway (Arkansas State) — https://sched.co/UXu3\n\nReported by Amy Lewontin (Snell Library Northeastern University) <a.lewontin@northeastern.edu>\n\nLibrary Director Bailey opened the session on budgetary changes, by letting the audience know he had been at the Library for ten years, and the changes he planned to outline in his talk were budgetary issues that he had been dealing with for the last year and a half. Prior to 2019, his library had traditional library accounts, as well as funds from a library fee from enrollment of each student, which then became a smaller sum, as the university’s enrollment began to drop. Some budgetary changes came quickly for their Library, presenting severe budgetary challenges, and both Bailey and Collection Management Librarian Holloway, gave a very thorough explanation of how they managed to cope with the changes. These are challenges that many libraries face, they explained, and their experience could be considered drastic, but their strategies would most likely work for any library. Arkansas State, when it began to suffer budget difficulties, hired an outside consultant to help the University find efficiencies, to cover their budget deficit. One place the consultant identified was the Library, and its reduced spending suggested the University could save one million dollars a year, representing around a 34% budget cut for the Library. Both Holloway and Bailey explained their efforts to work with the faculty and to gain input into the cuts and changes they needed to make. They also asked departments if they could offer funds to retain items that might need to be cut. They also discussed working with their Provost, about the decisions and making sure that everything they were doing was approved by the Provost’s office.\n\nHolloway went into useful detail on how journal packages were examined and trimmed, and how their databases were reviewed. They considered usability when making decisions on what to keep and conducted considerable overlap analysis, all of which were fruitful for the Library and then shared widely. Noteworthy in the work that Arkansas State University’s Library did to achieve the necessary savings was the speed in which this all had to be accomplished. Bailey closed the talk by acknowledging that the University’s administration developed a better understanding of the Library and its issues. (The session’s slides can be found in Sched.)\n\nPreprints - Why Librarians Should Care — Presented by Susan K. Kendall (Michigan State University Libraries), Oya Y. Rieger (Ithaka S+R), Rachel Burley (Research Square), Jessica Polka (ASAPbio) — https://sched.co/UXtN\n\nNote: Jessica Polka presented remotely.\n\nReported by Ramune K. Kubilius (Northwestern University, Galter Health Sciences Library & Learning Center) <r-kubilius@northwestern.edu>\n\nPolka reviewed categories of preprints and their benefits in providing: rapid dissemination, earlier, broader feedback, visibility — collaborator finding opportunities, institutional recognition (grants, jobs), reduced gatekeeping, broadened dissemination (e.g., negative results). The biggest criticism? No peer-review. Burley spoke about the “In Review” option at Springer Nature (partnered with Research Square) being piloted by 17 BMC journals, which allows sharing and feedback to take place while an article goes through the editorial and peer review process. Authors can see the peer review timeline, there is a preprint to publication continuum. Kendall surveyed the 40 some preprint server landscape, remarking that many are scientific and non-profit. Disciplines differ regarding fears of getting scooped and others exhibit slow adoption of: open access (chemists); preprints (health practitioners). Librarians can help alleviate preprint confusion — pointing out check boxes in submission checklists, journal policies, and funder requirements. Per Rieger, librarians should care — preprints ensure integrity and durability of scholarship. View business models holistically. Recognize that content is not homogenous: 20% (computer science) and 85% (materials science) preprints get published. Confusion differentiating institutional repositories and preprint servers remains. Technologies such as Open Science Framework OSF Preprints can make sharing easier. Researchers and librarians prefer community driven options, expect transparency, stability, durability. Advisory boards are optimal. There are bad actors and, in general, there should be some information skepticism. continued on page 60\n\nCONCURRENT SESSIONS THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 2019\n\nBeyond ROI: Expanding data analysis to develop a strategy for transformation — Presented by Matthew Wilmott (California Digital Library) — https://sched.co/UXuv\n\nReported by John Banionis (Villanova University) <john.banionis@villanova.edu>\n\nBased on CDL’s strategic move towards transformative agreements, Wilmott explained his work supporting this initiative through the development of a data analysis tool incorporating article-level publication datasets from Web of Science (WoS), and article-level and journal-level OA status from DOAJ and Unpaywall. However, due to gaps in coverage in WoS, Wilmott also developed publisher-specific scaling factors for the tool based on WoS coverage statements, Crossref article counts, previously observed publishing patterns, and cross-checking of publisher data. This then allowed for an estimated calculation of University of California systemwide APC spend, which would be coupled with subscription spend and the other datapoints in the tool to generate transformative agreement models, which CDL would in turn propose to their publisher partners. Wilmott stressed that this data analysis was critically necessary to provide confidence in CDL’s approach while conveying a compelling message to faculty and other stakeholders. Recognizing that this process can be very time consuming, Wilmott encouraged attendees to use and adapt the tool (available at http://bit.ly/ CDL_TA_Tools) for their own institutional analyses.\n\nResource Discovery in a Changing Content World — Presented by Christine Stohn (Ex Libris), Cynthia Schwarz (Temple University), Hannah McKelvey (Montana State University), Allen Jones (The New School), Rachelle McLain (Montana State University) — https://sched.co/UXus\n\nReported by Janice Adlington (McMaster University) <adling@mcmaster.ca>\n\nThis forty-minute session was evenly divided between presentation and discussion, giving the three schools and one vendor relatively little time to present their content. Each library panelist provided an overview of the systems underlying their discovery solution, shared examples of customizations supporting library services (ILL, course reserves, storage retrievals), and described enhancements to expose unique or external content, including image viewers, fulltext delivery (Browzine+LibKey), and network zone resources. Stohn from Ex Libris wrapped up the presentation, suggesting methods to surface archival, special, or curated collections within discovery. This session attracted more vendors/publishers than librarians, and the ensuing discussion led into some unexpected directions. The importance of quality metadata was emphasized, with one panelist issuing a plea to publishers to stop developing their own search platforms and instead focus on metadata and interoperability. The need to provide additional contextual information (“look inside”) was also highlighted, to help students and researchers select sources. Overall, the session was a little uneven, with differing levels of technical sophistication and many ideas presented very quickly. It could perhaps have benefited from a longer time slot to more fully explore the issues raised.

Approaches to open access vary significantly by country as funder mandates, cash flow, and institutional priorities differ. The key features of Wiley’s approach to open access are transparency, building trust, aligning with university goals, and recognizing that all models are unique.\n\nEvans spoke on behalf of OhioLINK, a state agency made up of 90 institutions and 118 libraries. OhioLINK entered into a pilot transformative agreement with Wiley in 2019. Funding was distributed based on publishing output; there were no limits on journal type (gold or hybrid). A structural issue of the read and publish model is that the majority of institutions fall in the “read” category but the cost burden falls on “publish” institutions. The collective question is how will read consortia participate in open access?\n\nCampbell posited that there is enough money already in the global publishing economy to flip from subscriptions to open access. She discussed Projekt DEAL in Germany, whose objective is to form transformative agreements with the three biggest publishers with Wiley as their first partner. Consortia are naturally and strategically placed to manage these agreements. (Evans’ slides can be found in Sched.)\n\nThat’s all the reports we have room for in this issue.

(In 2014, administrators officially outnumbered instructors in the U.S. for the first time.)\n\nWhat used to be an affordable way to gain social mobility has become anything but, and COVID-19 may be the factor that finally causes some strong reforms as the value proposition is reconsidered by parents and students alike.\n\nI was the first person in my family to go to college, and because tuition was so affordable and the state school in town allowed me to commute, I incurred no student debt. Now, tuition at that same institution for an in-state student is 10x higher. Overall, tuition has increased 1,400% over the past few decades. Scott Galloway notes in his critiques of higher education’s current rates and methods1 that higher education would now be unattainable for him, its unattainability reinforcing a de facto caste system:\n\nIn August 1982, I took a job installing shelving for $18/hour, as I had been rejected by UCLA and had no other options for college. UCLA admission would have meant I could live at home. On September 19, 1982, I got a call from an empathetic admissions director at\n\nUCLA, nine days before classes started. She said they had reviewed my appeal, and despite mediocre grades and SAT scores, they were letting me in, as I was “a son of a single mother and the great state of California” (no joke, her exact words). My mom told me that as the first person from either side of the family to be admitted to college,\n\nI could now “do anything.” The upward mobility and economic security afforded me by education has resulted in a meaningful return for the state and the union (jobs created, tens of millions in taxes paid, etc.).\n\nIt has also resulted in the profound: the resources to help my mom die at home (her wish) and to create a loving and secure environment for my kids.\n\nHigher education is far less affordable, and social mobility has been hindered for years. More troubling, the elite’s bubble may be detaching from society, if it hasn’t detached already, making science and scholarship out of touch in both how it’s practiced and also in how it’s viewed and accepted.\n\nPresumptions and pretensions of elitism pervade many parts of academic and media cultures, including college applications. On a recent Against the Rules continued on page 62\n\npodcast with Michael Lewis, 2 a teacher in a smaller city decided to help coach a homeless student working two jobs, who had a 4.0 GPA, and who scored a 1260 on her SAT despite taking it “cold” without preparation. As she worked with the student through her college admissions process, the adult was struck by how elitist the questions were:\n\nColumbia asks, “What exhibits, lectures, theatre productions, and concerts have you liked best in the last year?” And I’m tempted to write, “Carmen, at the Metropolitan Opera. ... PSYCH! My town doesn’t even have a movie theater.” ... Another school asks her what her favorite periodicals, newspapers, and web sites are. She doesn’t have access to a computer except when she does homework on a school computer. She doesn’t get the New\n\nYorker. She’s never traveled outside her town. ... I’m looking at these questions, and I’m thinking, “You clearly don’t get it, you don’t understand what it’s like to grow up in a rural town and not have resources like elite Americans do.”\n\nAnother story involves a student in a rural area who was accepted to a university in a big city across the country. He and his parents had never flown in the U.S. before, and his struggles with connecting flights and the complexity of airports almost prevented his attendance. Such mundane barriers don’t occur to us, and when we’re told about them, they strike us as quaint. But they exist, they are real, and they can block people from advancing.\n\nIn our broadband-enabled metropolitan areas, we often forget that computer access and fast Internet is still a luxury. Even in the relatively prosperous suburbs of Boston, computer and Internet access for K-12 kids has major gaps.\n\nThere are layers to such insights we need to contemplate, such as how education has become a “false meritocracy” for many, with the recent college admissions scandals only serving as a cherry of farce atop decades of biased standardized testing rewarding elites, bloated tuition blocking opportunity, corrupt admissions greased by massive donations, and surging and unforgivable student debt.\n\nThe expectations of elitism also pervade the job market. Many employers\n\nhave hard-coded requirements for bachelor’s degrees into their computerized screening of applicants, often for jobs that haven’t historically required them. Some experienced workers, who years ago did these same jobs, and who left to raise families or deal with other life issues, return to find that their experience and abilities don’t count as much as a piece of paper they never needed before — a certification which won’t matter even after they get it.\n\nSarah Kendzior’s passionate, imperfect, and excellent book about the ongoing corruption of U.S. institutions, Hiding in Plain Sight: The Invention of Donald Trump and the Erosion of America, 3 is worth a read. Kendzior, who also wrote The View from Flyover Country: Dispatches from the Forgotten America, 4 moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in the early 2000s after stints as an academic in Europe and as a journalist in New York City.\n\nFor young professionals, we are seeing a double blow — the 2008-09 Great Recession, and now the COVID-19 economic implosion — upending their early careers, perhaps setting them back forever. 5 But the deck was already stacked against them. Kendzior laments what she feels is a lost pathway to a brighter future for many:\n\nWhen I tell young people how I got [my first journalism job], they respond as if I’m telling them a fairy tale. I was hired after sending someone my résumé through the mail to strangers. I had no connections, no graduate degree, and no summer internships. I had spent my summers working to save money for college, which meant my résumé included positions like “Record Town cashier” and “Dannon water inventory specialist,” a job that consisted of stocking bottled water at supermarkets and did not require the ability to read. But no one cared back then; the era of elite credentialism was still years ahead.\n\nThe time Kendzior recounts was just 20 years ago. In that period, in addition to greater consolidation, two major economic upheavals, and skyrocketing costs and pressures around college admissions and degrees, scholarly publishing has become prone to greater implicit geographic workforce elitism. Social mobility had already declined for decades, 6 and it seems to be doomed to decline more with these events.\n\nHigher education is going to be transformed by COVID-19 and other events. How do we ensure it’s transformed to be more inclusive? To elevate more lives? To be more relevant? To bring talent forward, even if it’s hidden and in unexpected locations?\n\nWe need to ensure we’re attached to reality and the broadest possible version of our society, or the mission of higher education may become irrelevant to millions.\n\nKent Anderson is the CEO and founder of Caldera Publishing Solutions, editor of “The Geyser,” a past-President of the Society of Scholarly Publishing, and founder of “The Scholarly Kitchen.” He has worked as an executive of a technology startup and as a publishing executive at numerous non-profits, including the\n\nAmerican Association for the Advance-\n\nment of Science (AAAS), the Massachusetts Medical Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1. https://www.profgalloway.com/ how-i-got-here 2. https://atrpodcast.com/ 3. https://us.macmillan.com/ books/9781250245397\n\n4. https://us.macmillan.com/ books/9781250189998\n\n5. https://www.washingtonpost. com/business/2020/05/27/millennial-recession-covid/\n\n6. https://www.minneapolisfed.org/ institute/working-papers/17-21.pdf\n\nLEGAL ISSUES\n\nSection Editors:\n\nBruce Strauch (The Citadel) <strauchb@citadel.edu> Jack Montgomery (Western Kentucky University) <jack.montgomery@wku.edu>\n\nLegally Speaking — The Internet Archive Lawsuit\n\nby Anthony Paganelli (Western Kentucky University) <Anthony.Paganelli@wku.edu>\n\nIn my “Legally Speaking” column of the Against the Grain September 2020 issue, I mentioned the lawsuit against the Internet Archive by Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, John Wiley & Sons, and Penguin Random House on June 1, 2020. This lawsuit was discussed further in Bill Hannay’s article from the same issue, “No Good Deed Goes Unsued!” (Hannay, 2020).\n\nThe plaintiff argued that the Internet Archive’sNational Emergency Library; which was established on March 24, 2020 following the shutdown of schools and libraries, was in violation of copyright infringement. The publishers based their lawsuit on the Internet Archive’s offer to provide a single digital work for an unlimited number of people regardless that the Internet Archive only had one book. These works were digitized for patrons to view online and the Internet Archive could only lend digital copies depending on the number of physical copies in the collection. In other words, if the digital copy was checked out to a patron, then those requesting the same book would be placed on a waiting list. Therefore, the plaintiffs felt that releasing one digital book to multiple patrons simultaneously was a violation of copyright.\n\nDue to the lawsuit that was filed in the U.S. District Court Southern District of New York, the Internet Archive returned back to their digital lending policy on June 11, 2020. The Internet Archive released a statement noting that the publishers were attacking the concept of library ownership and lending of digital books. They added that the publishers were working to provide materials for students and patrons of the schools and libraries that were shut down due to the pandemic. For example, numerous publishers did provide either free access or reduced financial expenditures for textbooks and other resources for a limited time during the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHannay also stated in the September Against the Grain issue, “Where things go from here is an open question.” Indeed, it was an open question following the Internet Archive’s decision to return to their original policy of digital lending on June 11, 2020. However, the Internet Archive did request and was granted a 30-day extension to reply to the plaintiff’s lawsuit, which was set to end July 28, 2020. This was also in part due to the publishers continued efforts to seek statutory damages against the Internet Archive, which included a demand for a jury in this case.\n\nPrior to this lawsuit, libraries across the nation released a statement on March 13, 2020 to identify that “Fair Use” was to be a major legal issue as they tried to support students and educators during the pandemic that shutdown schools and libraries. Following the lawsuit, the Asso-\n\nciation of Research Libraries\n\n(ARL) encouraged the publishers to drop the lawsuit through the statement, “As universities and libraries work to ensure scholars and students have the information they need, ARL looks forward to working with publishers to ensure open and equitable access to information. Continuing the litigation against IA (Internet Archive) for the purpose of recovering statutory damages and shuttering the Open Library would interfere with this shared mutual objective.” (Aiwuyor, 2020).\n\nOn July 27, 2020, the Internet Archive had their opportunity to make their statement regarding the lawsuit through their 28 page brief filed in the U.S. Southern District Court of New York. In the brief, the Internet Archive addressed the publishers’ 53 page suit that was filed against them on June 1, 2020. The Internet Archive reiterated the purpose of their service, which is to provide print books through “Controlled Digital Lending.” They noted that they provide digital content securely that was the same as the publishers that release digital content. Furthermore, the Internet Archive described the purpose of establishing the National Emergency Library.\n\nIn the Preliminary Statement of the brief, Internet Archive stated that their Controlled Digital Lending platform was within the regulations of digital lending that is used by publishers that sell digital books. The Internet Archive claimed that they adhere to the own-to-loan basis for their digital collection and their digitization helps preserve numerous print books. The statement also noted that libraries have purchased over a billion dollars to publishers for print books. The Internet Archive recognized their digital collection was approximately 1.3 million, which is available to patrons based on the same borrowing system of one patron to loan one book at a time.\n\nThe Internet Archive described the purpose of the National Emergency Library, “During the early days of the COVID-19 crisis, in response to urgent pleas from teachers and librarians whose students and patrons had been ordered to stay at home, the Internet Archive decided to temporarily permit lending that could have exceeded the one-to-one ownedto-loaned ration. With millions of print books locked away, digital lending was the only practical way to get books to those who needed them. The Internet Archive called this program the National Emergency Library and planned to discontinue it once the need had passed. Twelve weeks later, other options had emerged to fill the gap, and the Internet Archive was able to return to the traditional CDL approach.” continued on page 64\n\nOf course, the Internet Archive stated in the brief that the publishers’ “are not entitled to statutory damages,” which is based on the 17 U.S.C. § 504(c) Remedies for infringement: Damages and profits. They also requested relief and dismissal from the lawsuit in its entirety, as well as a trial by jury. While the brief replied to the publishers’ lawsuit and the Internet Archive did return to their original checkout policy, the lawsuit continues.\n\nOn August 20, 2020, both parties got together to discuss the lawsuit, but they were unable to reach a settlement. After their discussions, they filed a joint report to the court on August 28, 2020 based on the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 26. This report outlined the discovery plan for both parties between September 11, 2020 to September 10, 2021. In addition, the publishers have until November 1 to add more works to the lawsuit and December 1 to amend the complaint. Following the December 1 possible amendments, the Internet Archive would have 21 days to respond. Over the next year, both parties will prepare for possible hearings in November 2021.\n\nEven though, there is really not much to report on this lawsuit at this time as both parties are preparing for the November hearings, this lawsuit is bringing to the foreground the relationships between libraries and publishers as the increase need for digital content continues to be an issue. As noted by Hannay, “Where things go from here is an open question.” This open question could very well be, “Is Controlled Digital Lending legal under the U.S. Copyright Law?” Of course, numerous other questions will arise as this lawsuit moves forward. Until there is a ruling or resolution, it will be interesting as schools and libraries continue to seek of ways to access digital content.\n\nReferences\n\nAiwuyor, J. (2020).

While the last term was unusually busy with copyright issues, including major decisions on copyright in state laws and sovereign immunity, this term is mostly defined by the copyright cases the Court chose not to hear. Two particular cases have been closely watched based on their colorful facts and the significant legal questions raised by each.\n\nThe first case dealt with a set of murals painted on the 5Pointz complex in Long Island City, Queens. The complex itself was primarily made up of factories and disused spaces, but for decades graffiti artists had decorated the space with colorful murals and eye-catching tags, establishing it as a mecca for street art. In 2013-14, however, the owner of the complex abruptly whitewashed and then demolished all the buildings to make space for a new development.\n\nThe artists sued, alleging that their rights under the Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA) had been violated. Although VARA, which provides a slimmed down version of “moral rights” to a narrowly defined set of works of visual art, has been on the books since 1990, it has rarely been considered by the courts. This case raised VARA issues directly and drew attention when a court in 2017 awarded the artists $6.75 million dollars ($150,000 for each of the 45 pieces destroyed) in damages. The defendant development company G&M Realty appealed the decision but lost again at the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court’s decision not to hear the case leaves the verdict in place and leaves us without the opportunity to hear from the Court about the scope and interpretation of VARA.\n\nThe second case offered an equally dramatic set of facts, concerning the claim of guitarist Randy Wolf, who used the stage name Randy California, that his song Taurus was the basis for Led Zeppelin’s iconic song Stairway to Heaven. Wolf’s band Spirit regularly played this song when they were touring with Zeppelin in the late 1960s, shortly before Stairway to Heaven was released in 1971. Similarities between the two songs, and particularly the opening arpeggios, had been frequently noted in music fandom and press as well as in comment from California in the liner notes of a later album.\n\nIn 2014 Spirit bassist Mark Andes and a trust acting on behalf of the now-deceased California filed a copyright infringement suit against Led Zeppelin seeking writing credit for California and potentially claiming some future profits on the song. A district judge initially held that enough similarities existed that a jury could hear continued on page 65\n\nthe case, but later that year a jury decided that the similarities between the songs did not amount to copyright infringement. After a series of appeals, the Ninth Circuit ruled in favor of Led Zeppelin holding that Stairway to Heaven does not infringe on Spirit’s copyright in Taurus.\n\nLegally, this decision was significant since the Court rejected the “inverse ratio rule” that had been used to decide copyright infringement cases in the past. The rule, which holds that the more an alleged infringer had access to a work the lower the threshold for establishing substantial similarity should be, had been a source of significant uncertainty and, in some scholars’ eyes, led to some clearly bad decisions. Between this decision and the 2018 “Blurred Lines” decision related to the estate of Marvin Gaye’s claim against Robin Thicke, the “inverse ratio rule” has now been clearly abrogated in the Ninth Circuit. The Supreme Court’s decision not to review the case means that that rule is a dead letter in the Ninth Circuit but that the question of its application nationally will not be answered this year.\n\nWith those two cases not on the docket, the only major copyright case under review remains the Google v Oracle case left over from the 2019-20 term. Oral arguments in this case were held on October 7 with a decision expected sometime in the spring.\n\nQUESTION: A public university administrator asks, “What is the state of sovereign immunity today?”\n\nANSWER: Another hangover from the previous Supreme Court term is the issue of sovereign immunity. As discussed in previous columns, sovereign immunity, the general rule that federal courts cannot hear suits brought by individuals against nonconsenting states, was considered in the case of Allen v Cooper, where the Supreme Court upheld the doctrine as applied to the state of North Carolina’s unauthorized use of images of Blackbeard’s sunken pirate ship.\n\nThe decision was based in part on consideration of the Copyright Remedies Clarification Act of 1990, which included a report from the Copyright Office that had gathered examples of alleged bad action by the states. This report was intended to establish a record of widespread intentional violations of a federal law by the states, as required to abrogate sovereign immunity. The Court was not persuaded.\n\nSeemingly frustrated with the decision, the Copyright Office issued a notice of inquiry soliciting more examples of bad behavior by the states. Responses to the Notice were recently released and, despite claims of widespread abuse by some rightsholder groups, only 31 responses were recorded. Further, as documented by University of Kansas Libraries Director Kevin Smith in a recent blog post, those 31 responses reflect a limited understanding of the law and often do not even engage with the issues under consideration: “[c]omments that complain about Nigerian phishing schemes, rogue federal agents, or a state’s alleged infringement of an individual’s “copyright” in his name indicate that some took the opportunity to air their grievances, even when those grievances misunderstand the nature of copyright and/or have no relationship with sovereign immunity.” The full blog post is available here: https://www.arl. org/blog/sovereign-immunity-boondoggle-at-us-copyright-office/ and a tip of the cap is due to Darcee Olson, LSU’s Copyright & Scholarly Communication Policy Director for summarizing responses.\n\nThe Copyright Alliance, a group that advocates on behalf of rightsholders, also released the results of a public survey designed to “assist the Copyright Office” with building a case for abrogation: https://copyrightalliance.org/ca_post/ copyright-alliance-survey-reveals-growing-threat-of-state-infringement/. Unsurprisingly, the Copyright Alliance singled out “state universities or institutions of higher learning” as actors they most wished to remove protection from. As of this writing the Copyright Office is accepting “reply comments” and the issue of sovereign immunity is likely to remain critical for libraries, universities, and university presses who rely on the doctrine for their society-serving work every day.\n\nQUESTION: A faculty member asks, “What is happening at the Copyright Office? It seemed like there was a lot of noise about the Office a few years ago, but I haven’t heard as much recently.”\n\nANSWER: After several years of drama at the Copyright Office related to a proposed “Next Great Copyright Act,” removal of one Register by new Librarian of Congress Dr. Carla Hayden, and some heated discussion about moving the Office out of the LoC, the Office has focused primarily on modernization and developing more up-to-date information for those who rely on the Office to understand the law and register their works.\n\nThe big news from the Copyright Office in 2020 is that in September of this year Shira Perlmutter was named as the next Register of Copyrights. She comes from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) where she served for more than a decade as chief policy officer and director for international affairs. Dr. Hayden and the American Library Association both praised Perlmutter’s ability to find common ground with “both users of information and rights holders.” Her work on the U.S. implementation of the Marrakesh Treaty also demonstrates her leadership on supporting access to information.\n\nIn recent years, the Copyright Office has done outstanding work updating and improving what had been a very creaky system for digital copyright registration and records infrastructure. Perlmutter is an excellent choice to continue that valuable work so that the Copyright Office can serve creators, users, and the copyright system as a whole.\n\nQUESTION: A digital humanist asks, “How does copyright impact text and data mining?”\n\nANSWER: Text and data mining is emblematic of digital scholarship as a whole in that it has tremendous potential to improve the way we understand the world and build a scholarly record but it raises thorny legal questions that many scholars are not prepared to address. For this reason, I was pleased to see the National Endowment for the Humanities fund an institute to understand Legal Literacies for Text Data Mining in partnership with UC Berkeley in the summer of 2020. The Institute and openly-licensed materials are available on the project page: https:// buildinglltdm.org/.\n\nYou couldn’t ask for a better example of the impact of the Building LLTDM project than The Data-Sitters Club, a “comprehensive, colloquial guide to digital humanities computational text analysis” that evokes the popular Baby-Sitters Club novels beloved by young readers. The Data-Sitters Club site offers seven books and three multilingual mysteries that introduce topics in text analysis including “The DSC and Mean Copyright Law” which wrestles with questions about copyright, trademark, and related legal issues by discussing the way the project uses images, marks, and similar materials from the original Baby-Sitters Club series: https://datasittersclub.github.io/ site/dsc7/.\n\nBiz of Digital — Repository Quick Submit and CV Scraping\n\nby Deborah Revzin (Knowledge Management Consultant, 18 B Hilliard Street, Cambridge, MA. 02138; Phone: 307-264-0292) <deborah.revzin@gmail.com>\n\nand Colin B. Lukens (Senior Repository Manager, Harvard Library Office for Scholarly Communication, Widener Library G-20 – 1 Harvard Yard, Cambridge MA; Phone: 617-495-4089) <colin_lukens@harvard.edu>\n\nColumn Editor: Michelle Flinchbaugh (Acquisitions and Digital Scholarship Services Librarian, Albin O.

Complicated licensing and author re-use rights can sometimes be viewed as a barrier by authors who are looking to deposit their work. Paired with the challenges of communicating the benefits of repository deposit and the rights afforded by institutional open-access policies, limited resources, or lack of administrative support, repository managers often struggle to build a broader culture around deposits outside of open-access advocates. A proactive, mediated, and collaborative publication review program can mitigate or solve some of these issues. By reviewing an author’s publication list or CV with an eye towards repository deposit, repository managers and scholarly communication librarians can demystify the process and educate depositors on licensing and open-access policies. Here, we outline such an effort at Harvard University.\n\nThe Harvard Library Office for Scholarly Communication (OSC) was founded in 2009 to support the first of many open-access policies adopted by the University.1 The Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard (DASH) repository was inaugurated shortly thereafter to support these policies.2 Throughout the OSC’s history, Open Access Fellows — graduate students from Harvard University and Simmons University’s School of Library and Information Science program — have and continue to identify scholarship to deposit into DASH, determine licensing for works in the repository, and communicate with faculty about DASH deposits. These Fellows are invaluable resources in the OSC’s mission to build scholarly content in DASH and to promote open access at Harvard.\n\nSince its inception, the OSC has provided DASH depositing assistance to all members of the Harvard community. In the early years, Fellows contacted faculty to inform them of open-access policies and guide them through the depositing process. To minimize the number of steps in the depositing process and to ensure greater licensing compliance, a Quick Submit form for depositing works into DASH was created. This form has become a much faster way for authors to deposit a work, shifting metadata reconciliation and licensing determination responsibilities to Fellows and the OSC staff. The Quick Submit option on DASH’s user-facing interface asks depositing authors to sign an Assistance Authorization (AA), which provides the range of licenses used for works in DASH and gives approved proxies permission to make DASH-related license choices on the author’s behalf.3 In the case of a Harvard-affiliated faculty member, AAs re-affirm the University’s open-access policy; for all other Harvard-affiliates, it serves as the opt-in for the Harvard Individual Open-Access License.4\n\nIn addition to the self-deposit Quick Submit option, the OSC offers affiliates of the University a mediated deposit service known as a CV Scrape. This service increases deposits into DASH and has become a vital part of making more scholarship at Harvard open-access. The CV Scrape program also helps the OSC foster a culture and understanding around repository deposits at the University. Knowledge of and interest in this service is driven by presentations given to faculty and faculty assistants by OSC staff, library peers advocating this service to authors, word of mouth, and the OSC’s webpage outlining the CV Scrape service.5\n\nThe first step in the process is to acquire an author’s CV and a signed AA. From there, Fellows begin working on the scrape using a custom spreadsheet template to capture data from the author’s CV. The columns of the spreadsheet act as a workflow to guide Fellows through a series of decision points. First, citations are collected and works are crosschecked with those already in DASH, to prevent duplicate entries. Next, Fellows search for publisher DOIs or manuscript URLs and lastly, SHERPA/RoMEO is used to determine the publishers’ copyright and re-use policies. When all the necessary data has been recorded on the spreadsheet, Fellows deposit into DASH those works for which a publisher or University open-access policy allow for its distribution. Finally, the Senior Repository Manager (SRM) is informed of the completion of the CV scrape. From this point, the SRM sends a distillation of the spreadsheet to the author, which acts as an Outcomes Report. This report is color-coded to indicate what the Fellow was able to make available in DASH, what already exists in the repository, and if certain versions of a work are needed from the author to be deposited into DASH. As well as offering next steps to authors, the Outcomes Report empowers them to make more of their works available in the repository while also creating an opportunity for the OSC to educate authors on open access, licensing, and copyright and to engage in fruitful discussions on scholarly communication. These discussions position the library as the knowledge center for these issues, helping to create and cultivate a culture of open access and continued depositing into DASH.\n\nThe CV Scrape service has a number of proven benefits. The primary benefit is the increase in the amount of Harvard scholarship that is open access and available in DASH. The more personal patron service model provides flexibility for authors with varying levels of familiarity with open access. Authors who are new to depositing scholarship into a repository and the concept of open access often feel unsure of where to begin. The CV Scrape process gives authors a starting point by initiating the creation of their collection in the repository. It is hoped that this beginning produces favorable statistics that can act\n\ncontinued on page 67\n\nCome see us at the Charleston Virtual Vendor Showcase\n\nFor more information on how to support or participate in the archive contact us at info@clockss.org.\n\nCLOCKSS Archive is a dark archive that ensures the long-term survival of web-based scholarly publications, governed by and for its stakeholders.

For authors who are familiar with the repository and open access, the CV Scrape process mitigates complications and streamlines depositing.\n\nEven though this process has many benefits, it also poses a few challenges. Some of the most common obstacles Fellows face when working through a CV Scrape include a lack of communication from authors, an author’s assumption that all scholarship on a CV can be made available in DASH, licensing that can often be difficult to determine (especially for older articles or journals), and the labor intensive nature of the process. Some scrapes demand a lengthy amount of time, which diverts attention away from other projects and pulls from Fellows’ limited availability.\n\nThe OSC continues to monitor ways to improve its mediated depositing service, in part by testing new applications and processes. Last year, Fellows tested the Open Access Permission Checker,6 then in its beta-form, and provided feedback and commentary on using the tool in the CV Scrape process. The Open Access Permission Checker was created by Our Research, a joint venture nonprofit co-founded by Heather Piwowar and Jason Priem. The Checker was one aspect in the team’s larger project, Unpaywall, created to “help make scholarly research more open, accessible, and reusable.”7 The OSC also stays up to date on what processes are used by other colleges and universities to build and enhance their repositories. Sharing feedback on ways to improve repository collections serves all institutions. The OSC would love to hear from you on how your scholarly communication office or repository managers are using CV Scrapes or other processes to populate collections in your institutional repository.

Recently, the OSC has piloted and adopted a collaborative distributed workflow program that divides the work of repository deposits, metadata review, and licensing amongst groups of helpers located within the Harvard Library, the University’s school library units, and academic administrative staff. This program is called D3, or Distributed DASH Deposit. A 2018 DLF Forum presentation outlined this program: bit.ly/D3_DLF 4. In 2018, Harvard adopted an opt-in open-access policy for all non-faculty Harvard-affiliated authors, thereby giving all affiliates the same rights as those afforded under faculty-approved policies.

Students completed their spring semester off-campus as in-person sessions were deemed unsafe. Six months later and schools are still navigating this new terrain as fall semesters begin.\n\nOver the past few months, demand for digital content for education and recreation has increased, and academic librarians have adjusted to a remote learning environment by shifting focus and priorities to eBooks and audiobooks. Before the pandemic, many colleges and universities had already been using digital titles to supplement traditional print resources, both for educational and recreational purposes. But even for academic libraries that were already familiar with providing digital content, there were challenges and changes. Schools were not just responding to an increased need for digital content, but also to a need to overhaul their entire academic process completely. And nobody felt the pressure to provide access to digital resources to support remote learning more than academic librarians.\n\n“Online Access Did Not Prepare Us For Online Learning”\n\nFor Maria Aghazarian, Scholarly Communications Librarian at Swarthmore College, nothing could have prepared her for the “rapid changes we had to make this spring,” she said.\n\nSwarthmore, a private liberal arts college in Pennsylvania, was founded in 1864 by the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, and was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the U.S. The 425-acre campus, which boasts hiking trails, wooded hills, and a creek, has frequently been named one of “America’s Most Beautiful College Campuses” by Travel+Leisure magazine.\n\nPrior to March 13, Swarthmore’s 1,500 full-time undergraduate students already had access to digital content that supported the school’s curricula of over 40 academic programs. With an OverDrive digital library, Swarthmore was able to customize its eBook and audiobook collection. Not just by title and format, but also the number of copies purchased. This ability to customize provides academic libraries maximum flexibility and efficiency, while users benefit from anytime-anywhere access to titles.\n\nBut as Aghazarian noted, “online access alone did not prepare us for online learning.”\n\nIn the first three months of the pandemic, Swarthmore’s library had 712 individual requests for digital copies of books. Requests covered everything from course reserves, honor exams, research, and personal use. The speed at which Aghazarian and her colleagues had to pivot to an online-only environment dozen different staff members to triage requests, depending on the platform,” she said.\n\nBut adapting to this increased demand for digital created new challenges, especially when it came to creating a collection that required developing a new workflow that “involves about a\n\nmet the new remote needs of Swarthmore’s students, faculty, and staff. “The usual factors we might consider when purchasing a book were suddenly more dire,” explained Aghazarian. Choosing the best lending model became paramount as each one affects how many users have access to a particular title at a given time.\n\nOverDrive’s multiple lending models support a range of loan types, and for Aghazarian, choosing among these models provides an opportunity to expand access to titles. “The availability of class sets that can be assigned to students is a game changer,” she said. Right now, Swarthmore delays cataloging certain titles they purchase through OverDrive to guarantee titles are first available to students in a particular class. If Swarthmore were to add class sets, that concern would be alleviated.\n\nAghazarian also sees tremendous potential in other lending models Swarthmore does not yet buy, such as Cost-Per-Circ (CPC) and Simultaneous Use (SU). With CPC, libraries only pay for a title when a user checks it out, while SU titles can be checked out by an unlimited number of users simultaneously. She said that both of these options “provide greater flexibility as we prepare for the coming year.”\n\nCPC can allow greater selection more efficiently because of the lower initial cost and the ability to set spending parameters to stay within the set budget. For example, colleges can offer an additional 300-400 titles while only paying for the ones that circ because the real cost is only a fraction (usually 10%) of the cost of purchasing outright. SU also offers potential savings by eliminating the need to buy multiple copies for a group or class reads, instead paying a per-student cost at a fraction of the price of a single copy.\n\n“We Have Relied Heavily On Our Digital Book Collections”\n\nAnother school that has seen great success with its digital collection of eBooks and audiobooks is Miami Dade College (MDC). Located in South Florida, MDC is a public college founded in 1959. Comprised of eight campuses, it is one of the largest community colleges in the U.S. and home to a diverse student body.\n\nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic, Adria Leal, Librarian at the Wolfson Campus Library, recognized there were tangible benefits to digital content. Students have anytime-anywhere access to eBooks and audiobooks through OverDrive. Because the titles are digital, they don’t have to worry about carrying them around or needing to remember to return them. Library staff also benefit from a digital library. Along with eBooks and audiobooks not requiring any physical space in the library, the staff doesn’t have to worry about needing to replace lost or damaged items.\n\nThere is also no need for staff to handle the material, such as when physical books are returned and need to be checked back in, something of great concern among librarians during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile eBooks and audiobooks were an essential part of MDC’s collection of online resources before COVID-19, Leal said the popularity of digital content is even more evident now when access to the physical library is limited. “During these unprecedented times, we have relied on the use of our online learning resources and digital book collections,” Leal said. MDC’s collection is a mix of titles that fit course curriculum along with current bestsellers, both fiction and nonfiction. She added, “OverDrive has provided our students, faculty, and staff with a great choice of new material to meet their popular reading needs.” Indeed, MDC has consistently seen a positive trend in eBook and audiobook checkouts year over year, a trend that Leal believes will continue.\n\nPart of MDC’s circulation success can be tied directly to their collection development policy, which relies heavily on recommendations from students, faculty, and staff. To streamline the recommendation process, MDC utilizes OverDrive’s Recommend to Library (RTL) feature. With RTL, if a user searches for a book on MDC’s OverDrive site and MDC doesn’t own it, the user has the option to notify MDC they would like this title to be added to MDC’s OverDrive collection.\n\nMDC students are not the only ones who see the benefits to eBooks and audiobooks, said Leal. “Some of our faculty have used the OverDrive collection for academic use as part of their reading material for some of the academic courses,” she explained. In some instances, students can choose to read a title in print, eBook, or listen to the audiobook version. Providing required reading in multiple formats supports different learning styles and increases a student’s odds for success.\n\nPartnership Creates Path Forward\n\nAs colleges and universities continue to adapt to an everchanging remote learning landscape, digital collections will be crucial to the success of everyone as the schools identify a path forward. For both Swarthmore and Miami Dade, their relationship with OverDrive has created a remote learning environment that will allow their students, faculty, and staff to thrive in the upcoming academic year.\n\nLeal points to OverDrive’s catalog of 3.1 million titles from over 30,000 premier publishers in more than 100 languages. OverDrive’s catalog has titles and publishers that are not available on any other platforms in a digital format. “The partnership between OverDrive and MDC Libraries has afforded a great variety of digital reading material made available in both eBook and audiobook format to our students and faculty,” Leal said. She also added that she appreciates how OverDrive has helped MDC promote reading during the pandemic.\n\nLikewise, Aghazarian notes how partners like OverDrive have provided solutions to meet the needs of librarians during this time. “As we’ve worked to quickly adapt our resources and services, I’ve been heartened to see the ways that vendors have been doing the same, appreciating their flexibility and willingness to work with us,” she said.\n\nOptimizing Library Services — Insights From a Professor and Researcher\n\nHow Librarians and Doctoral Education Leadership Can Partner to Provide Stronger Programs During the “New Normal”\n\nby Dr. Robin Throne, PhD (Independent Scholar, USA) <robin.throne@gmail.com>\n\nColumn Editors: Ms. Brittany Haynes (Editorial Assistant, IGI Global) <bhaynes@igi-global.com>\n\nand Ms. Lindsay Wertman (Managing Director, IGI Global) <lwertman@igi-global.com> www.igi-global.com\n\nColumn Editors’ Note: This column features IGI Global contributing author Dr. Robin Throne, independent scholar-researcher and author/editor of the highly cited IGI Global publications Autoethnography and Heuristic Inquiry for Doctoral-Level Researchers: Emerging Research and Opportunities,\n\nPractice-Based and Practice-Led Research for Dissertation\n\nDevelopment, and Indigenous Research of Land, Self, and Spirit. She outlines how librarians and doctoral educators can collaborate and pave the way for new solutions in the post-pandemic future and through the challenging upcoming semester in the midst of the “new normal.” — BH & LW Doctoral education, like all other aspects of higher education, continues in a rapid, decision-making mode as to the instructional delivery methods and modalities for the 2020-2021 academic year amid a global pandemic. Whether the doctoral institution was previously solely on campus, fully online, or hybrid, the new academic year likely involves the expansion of digital library resource support in some manner to ensure quality levels of engagement and research productivity among doctoral scholars. Ideally, doctoral faculty, research supervisors, leadership, and program/course developers are essential partners with library and information science (LIS) professionals to ensure continued on page 70\n\nquality levels for doctoral programs and the rigorous research doctoral scholars typically conduct.\n\nFor some, the pandemic has served to bolster collaboration, partnership, and innovation between all members of the doctoral learning community to ensure doctoral scholars, especially those who may have previously relied on face-to-face library research and subsequently faced zero-contact policies, remain engaged within the digital and virtual resources necessary to accomplish rigorous doctoral research. For others, the pandemic has simply firmed up collaboration, infrastructures, and emergent resource support that may have existed pre-pandemic but are now essential to a doctoral scholar’s success in the dissertation journey, capstone, or other forms of doctoral research. In many cases, this collaboration has served to strengthen the doctoral learning community and resulted in innovative or new approaches in the service of digital academic library research and research support.\n\nDoctoral Collection Development, Library Research, and Scholarship Sourcing Instruction\n\nNothing can replace the LIS professional’s curation of academic databases for the university’s doctoral program (not to mention the dean or director’s eye on the collection budget). This vetting of academic databases can be enhanced by collaboration with doctoral faculty to assure expertise in the current research necessary for doctoral research within the discipline. This may include a review of the value of open access databases or other sources of research within the discipline. When lean library budgets result from the pandemic and post-pandemic era, collaboration with doctoral faculty can bolster limited financial resources and be essential to vet these OA-specific resources to appropriately expand doctoral library offerings. Doctoral program faculty can be an essential partner to LIS professionals to determine appropriate OA databases and OA journals relevant to specific disciplines. As Tikam (2018) emphasized, open and available current research is necessary to the scholarly community but must also be carefully considered for inclusion in academic libraries due to the complex intellectual property considerations involved with digital access and fair use.\n\nSimilarly, it often takes the triad instruction from LIS professionals, doctoral faculty, and the doctoral research supervisor as doctoral students evolve into more sophisticated users of digital access to current research sources. Thus, another essential collaboration between LIS professionals and doctoral faculty can be the opportunities these faculty can bring to library instructional processes. As doctoral students may rely on open sources easily attained from the internet, scholarship sourcing instruction is necessary to ensure doctoral scholars understand the distinctions between credible and reliable research versus non-peer-reviewed research. As Tang and Zhang (2019) stressed, complex research support services is a new digital frontier for many universities and relies on the “wisdom/skills and expertise of librarians” (p. 22) and the collective experti"
