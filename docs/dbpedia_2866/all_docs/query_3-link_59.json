        "text": "This groundbreaking collection features 54 digitised First Folios from 30 institutions. Most contributing copies have not been publicly available before, and several have been digitised specifically for this project.\n\nHosted on the AM Quartex platform, the site presents a range of powerful new research opportunities for users. The gathering and unifying of a collected set of metadata tags unlocks unprecedented searchability functions, while a new split screen viewer enables side-by-side digital comparison of the unique texts for the first time.\n\nFolio highlights\n\nThe First Folio held by the University and City Library of Cologne which is accepted to be one of the most pristine examples of the text in existence\n\nThe example held by Durham University which had been located within the city for more than three centuries before being stolen in 1998. The folio resurfaced when an attempt was made to sell it to the Folger Shakespeare Library before being returned to Durham in 2010\n\nThe Saint-Omer folio which was rediscovered in 2014 and confirmed to be a First Folio after laying undisturbed in the library at St-Omer for some 200 years"
