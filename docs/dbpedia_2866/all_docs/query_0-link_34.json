        "text": "Remote access to primary source content continues to be a vital component for research at the University of Kentucky and at other institutions across the globe. To meet researchers’ needs, UK Libraries is offering access to 65 additional primary source collections from the award-winning publisher Adam Matthew Digital.\n\nLibrary users with a linkblue ID now have perpetual access to all Adam Matthew digital content published through 2016, including collections such as Colonial America, American West, American Indian Histories and Cultures, Slavery, Abolition and Social Justice, Jewish Life in America and Popular Culture in Great Britain and America. This acquisition was made possible through a partnership between the Association of Southeastern Research Libraries (ASERL), of which UK Libraries is a member, and Adam Matthew Digital.\n\n“UK Libraries has a long history of partnering with other institutions to preserve and enhance access to scholarly collections,” said Doug Way, dean of UK Libraries. “This partnership with ASERL and Adam Matthew Digital demonstrates the value of these relationships, allowing us to make scores of primary source collections available to our campus for teaching, learning and research.”\n\nWorking with other ASERL libraries to reach a collective spend goal, UK Libraries was able to purchase access to an estimated $2 million in additional primary content for a fraction of the cost.\n\n“ASERL is thrilled our member libraries were able to make these investments that unlocked a wonderful trove of content,” said Jan Lewis, director of Academic Library Services at East Carolina University and president of ASERL’s Board of Directors for 2020-2021. “The past year has been so challenging for so many libraries in so many ways — it’s really wonderful ASERL libraries are able to receive this membership benefit to boost their collections.”\n\n“We’re very pleased to engage in progressive partnerships that widen access to our products, and enable a much larger community to access important teaching and research content during these challenging times,” added Adam Matthew Digital managing director Khal Rudin.\n\nUsers can access all 65 collections through UK Libraries’ new A-Z Database list by either searching for a specific topic or browsing through new and popular databases on the righthand side of the page. To see a list of titles of all the new acquisitions, visit the UK Libraries website at: https://libraries.uky.edu/newsitem.php?lnote_id=1069.\n\nAn independent subsidiary within the SAGE group, Adam Matthew is a digital publisher of unique primary source collections from libraries and archives around the world. The company offers award-winning digital products enhanced through innovations in technology, creativity and collaborative partnerships.\n\nThe Association of Southeastern Research Libraries (ASERL) is comprised of 37 research libraries in the southeastern region of the United States. ASERL’s mission is to provide and maintain “top quality resources and services to students, faculty and citizens of their respective communities.”"
