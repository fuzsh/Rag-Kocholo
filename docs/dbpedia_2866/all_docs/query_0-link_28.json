        "text": "Syracuse University Libraries has acquired access to the entirety of Adam Matthew Digital’s online primary source archives and nine collections from Bloomsbury Digital Resources. These new holdings expand campus support for teaching and research across humanities, social sciences, architecture, visual and performing arts, and food, sport and exercise studies.\n\nAdam Matthew Digital Archives comprises 71 themed collections of primary sources digitized from libraries and archives in North America, Europe and Australasia, such as the Amistad Research Center, the British Archives, UCLA Ethnomusicology Archive and the Folger Shakespeare Library. Study of gender, sexuality, Jewish life, civil rights, poverty and social change is covered through photographs, audio recordings of speeches, diaries, correspondence, historic newspapers, film clips and periodicals. Study of American consumer culture, food and popular medicine is supported by catalogues, print advertisements, posters, pamphlets, cookbooks and client lists. Collections from the “Confidential Print” and “Foreign Office Files” series are dedicated to British government papers from the 18th to 20th centuries, facilitating the detailed study of British foreign affairs, colonization and trade globally. A full list of Adam Matthew archival collections is available in the Libraries’ database menu.\n\nBoth Adam Matthew Publishing and the Libraries provide personalized curriculum support to faculty for teaching with primary source materials. Adam Matthew provides a free course alignment service, and you can contact your University subject librarian for assistance and recommendations for collections and items that fit your teaching and research needs. For researchers interested in digital humanities, Adam Matthew accepts text and data mining requests.\n\nBloomsbury Digital Resources are themed collections of books, images, video, academic reference works, screenplays and exhibition archives. Syracuse University Libraries have acquired the collections focused on food studies, sport and exercise, cultural history, architecture, fashion and design, popular music, and screen studies. Content of note includes the major reference works “Berg Encyclopedia of World Dress and Fashion” and the “Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World,” video collections for practitioners in human kinetics, Faber & Faber screenplays, images from the Culinary Arts Museum at Johnson & Wales University and the National Archives at Kew, and video archives of YOOX-NET-A-PORTER fashion shows in London, Milan, Paris and New York. A full list of Bloomsbury Digital Resource collections is available in the Libraries’ database menu.\n\nAll authorized Syracuse University users can access these and other licensed resources through the Libraries home page, using a valid NetID and password."
