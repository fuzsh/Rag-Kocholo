        "text": "The SLNC Government & Heritage Library is pleased to announce the addition of two new digital collections to its subscription offerings: the Adam Matthew Colonial America and Colonial Caribbean primary source collections. These collections are available on site at the Government & Heritage Library or online from anywhere to users with an SLNC Government & Heritage Library card.\n\nAdam Matthew is a SAGE Publishing Company that has worked with The National Archives, UK to make materials from the Colonial Office (CO) Files available online for education and scholarship. The SLNC Government & Heritage Library purchased the Colonial America and Colonial Caribbean collections, particularly for their relevance to the rich history of North Carolina. With the addition of these collections, we can provide access to more online materials that help to represent the diverse populations of North Carolina. In addition to providing access to thousands of historical records, both collections include introductory materials, essays, and videos created by experts to help provide users with invaluable context relevant for interpreting and making sense of historical records.\n\nThe Colonial America collection includes the complete Colonial Office (CO 5) files located at The National Archives, UK. This series covers the time frame between 1606 and 1822 with all 1,450 volumes digitized and made available online in the Colonial America database. The Colonial Caribbean collection includes records from the Colonial Office files related to British governance in the Caribbean spanning from 1624 to 1870 and offers researchers and users access to primary resources that demonstrate the impact of slavery in the region as well as on enslaved peoples. Search across both the Colonial America and Colonial Caribbean databases via the AMexplorer search box on the Adam Matthew Primary Sources for Teaching and Research landing page.\n\nThis purchase was made possible by funding from the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) under the provisions of the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) as administered by the State Library of North Carolina, a division of the N.C. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (IMLS grant number LS-246155-OLS-20).\n\nHave questions about the Adam Matthew resources or anything else? Contact library staff through online chat or give them a call, 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., Monday – Friday, except for state holidays.
