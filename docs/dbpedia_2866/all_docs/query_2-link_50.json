It is a platform for teaching, learning and performing text analysis using archival repositories of scholarly and primary source content. You can query, search and download full-text articles or upload your own to use with their tools. Constellate works using Python and includes sample Jupyter Notebooks which you can modify and extend.\n\nThe University of Manchester has access to the free, public version of Contellate (excluding the Lab).\n\nITHAKA launched the Text Analysis Pedagogy (TAP) Institute to help instructors and librarians learn and teach text analysis. From 10 July to 11 August 2023, Constellate—in partnership with the Academic Data Science Alliance and the Association of College and Research Libraries—is offering free events and classes for anyone interested in teaching text analysis. Courses are progressive, so you will benefit from taking a single class or the entire series, no matter your skill level.\n\nRegister for summer 2023 TAP events now\n\nThere were a series of webinars in summer 2022 which can watch now:\n\nIntroduction to Constellate\n\nConstellate, the Technology\n\nConsiderations in Building a Good Dataset for Text Analysis\n\nWhat Can You Do With Word Counts?\n\nTopic Modeling Together\n\nIntroduction to the Constellate Trial and Participation Packages"
