        "text": "Publishing platforms are digital solutions that are principally designed to help publishers and authors to evaluate and disseminate content.\n\nIn its simplest form, a platform is an accessible location to host content and make it discoverable. Publishing platforms allow authors to share their insights on a digital platform, and promote the sharing of information with their intended audiences.\n\nA publishing platform needs to give publishers control of all the key functions that they require to run their publication and drive growth, as well as how their content is hosted, presented, marketed, and shared. It needs to support all of a publishers’ content, products and websites, and be easy to customise, extend and link to third-party systems. An effective publishing platform increases the value of a publisher’s content and the impact of their digital brand with websites that adapt the features we are familiar with in many successful consumer websites specifically for research content.\n\nKey players\n\nPublishing platform providers include 67 Bricks, a trusted partner to many publishers. The company has created flagship information products, platforms, AI-powered workflow tools and supercharged digital user experiences.\n\nAdam Matthew Digital is a specialist publisher of primary-source collections.

Articles can be published in as few as 14 days, and, post-publication, invited peer review creates an open dialogue between authors and their research community.\n\nFrontiers’ open-science publishing platform is at the heart of its publishing operations for researchers to benefit from the latest technology to validate and disseminate their findings. The firm leverages software tools for a rigorous, fast and efficient service.\n\nPensoft is the creator of the ARPHA open-access publishing platform. Offered as software-as-a-service (SaaS), ARPHA allows users to build their own publishing solution, and to manage and host journals, books, conference abstracts, proceedings and institutional documents.\n\nRiver Valley Technologies (RVT) built an XML-based publishing solution from submission to peer review, to production and to final hosting, giving full control to publishers, with full transparency of data.\n\nThe Silverchair platform is home to innovative digital products in research, reference and education.
