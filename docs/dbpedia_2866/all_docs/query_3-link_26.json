        "text": "Explore the history of printing, publishing and bookselling from 1554 to the 21st century.\n\nThe archive of the Stationers’ Company is widely regarded as one of the most important sources for studying the history of the book, publishing and copyright. The Company was instrumental in the development of the printed book in early modern England, exerting enormous power over the publishing industry as it developed. This resource provides essential primary sources for students and scholars of English literature, Renaissance theatre, and print culture from the early modern period to the twentieth century.\n\nThe arrival of printing caused a social and cultural revolution in late 15th century Britain. The Stationers’ Company was granted immense power by Royal Charter to control this nascent industry, requiring all works to be licensed and entered into a ‘Book of Copies’, in order to censor seditious and heretical works. The Registers quickly became used by publishers and printers to assert their exclusive rights over their publications, developing the concept of ‘copyright’.\n\nFeaturing Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) for full-text searching:\n\nThe Entry Book of Copies, the single most comprehensive record of all printed works registered in England until the mid-nineteenth century, is now enhanced with powerful Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) search functionality. The registers provide much unique information about literary and dramatic works, especially in the early modern period. Notable entries include Shakespeare’s First Folio, entered on November 8th, 1623. Read more about HTR or watch our demonstration video.\n\nHighlights\n\nThe Entry Book of Copies (1554-1842) provide unique information about literary and dramatic works. Notable entries include Shakespeare’s First Folio, entered on November 8th, 1623\n\nThe Court Records (1602-1982) are an essential source for understanding the workings of the Stationers’ Company and can be used to trace the establishment of book trade practices\n\nThe English Stock documents (1603-1961) record the activities of the successful publishing arm of the Stationers’ Company which held a monopoly over popular and frequently re‑published works\n\nDate reviewed: 2017. This new database from AM presents numerous types of documents from The Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers, which was first established in 1403 and incorporated in 1557. Among other items, there are trade records, court records, financial records, charities and property records, membership records, photographs, and a collection of recent oral histories. These items trace the history of the book and of publishing in England, as well as the development of copyright there. Seven introductory essays dealing with the materials provide users with the history of the organization and the different sorts of documents included in this rich database. Topics of the essays include plays, ballads, printed music, “Liber A,” and membership of the Company from 1550 to 1700.\n\nThis resource is clearly aimed at a particular group of scholars/researchers, who are familiar with the various roles of the Stationers’ Company, who can navigate the diverse categories of documents presented here, and perhaps most importantly, decipher English penmanship (for some documents). The visual quality of the documents is excellent; readers can zoom in to examine the minute details of a particular page, an ability most helpful for the handwritten texts.\n\nSumming up: Clearly aimed at research institutions, this resource will be best utilized by academic libraries anywhere that have patrons researching the areas of history mentioned above. Having this treasure trove of information literally at their fingertips, rather than many miles away, will serve them well indeed.\n\nRead the full review at: http://www.arbaonline.com\n\n\"While humanities and history scholars are the most likely users, Literary Print Culture: The Stationers’ Archive, 1554–2007 covers material in all disciplines,\" wrote A Haigh Widder for ccAdvisor. A product of AM, it contains full-text facsimiles of the archive of the UK’s Stationers’ Company. Stationers’ began in the late medieval period as the “trade guild for illuminators, book workers, booksellers, scribes, scriveners, copyists, and, after the invention of printing, of printers and publishers.” It was responsible for British copyright until 1911. Indeed, “this body invented the concept of copyright.” The database offers three types of searches: basic, advanced, and archival records. Advanced\n\nsearching narrows results by date, document type, record type, or theme. Full-text facsimiles often offer links to outside sources. Indexes are also linked to full texts. Extras include “oral histories, a glossary, a chronology, some images, and a number of secondary source essays.” The advisory board includes an emerita archivist of the Stationers’ Company. The reviewer advocated the purchase of this database for her library because scholars want to study the history of the\n\npublishing of particular books, particular authors, and particular printers/publishers.\n\nRead the full review at: www.CCAdvisor.org"
