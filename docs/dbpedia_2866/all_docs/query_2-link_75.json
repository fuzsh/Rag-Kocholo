        "text": "The Binghamton University Libraries are pleased to announce the addition of an expansive and new primary resource database, AM Explorer. Binghamton users now have access to millions of pages of primary sources in the Adam Matthew collections spanning over five centuries. This includes archives, personal diaries, expeditionary journals, photographs, maps, sound recordings, film and much more! Overall, there are about 130 distinct collections that make up the entirety of AM Explorer. Additionally, one of the best features about the AM Explorer platform is that you can search across all Adam Matthew Digital collections to make sure you’re always retrieving the most relevant search results of what you’re interested in.\n\nA list of all collections can be found on the Libraries database list under AM Explorer. Some highlights include:\n\nApartheid South Africa\n\n“Apartheid South Africa makes available British government files from the Foreign, Colonial, Dominion, and Foreign and Commonwealth Offices spanning the period 1948 to 1980. These previously restricted letters, diplomatic dispatches, reports, trial papers, activists’ biographies and first-hand accounts of events give unprecedented access to the history of South Africa’s apartheid regime.”\n\nBritish East India Company\n\n“East India Company offers access to a unique collection of India Office Records from the British Library, London. Containing royal charters, correspondence, trading diaries, minutes of council meetings and reports of expeditions, among other document types, this resource charts the history of British trade and rule in the Indian subcontinent and beyond from 1599 to 1947.”\n\nEthnomusicology\n\n“Delve into the cultural study of music and explore content from across the globe with this diverse and comprehensive collection. Produced in collaboration with the UCLA Ethnomusicology Archive, the material in this collection includes thousands of audio field recordings and interviews, educational recordings, film footage, field notebooks, slides, correspondence and ephemera from over 60 fields of study.”\n\nGender: Identity and Social Change\n\n“Gender: Identity and Social Change includes primary sources for the study of gender history, women’s suffrage, the feminist movement and the men’s movement. Explore records from men’s and women’s organizations and pressure groups, detailing twentieth-century lobbying and activism on a wide array of issues to reveal developing gender relations and prevalent challenges.”\n\nIndigenous Histories and Culture in North America\n\n“Explore manuscripts, artwork and rare printed books dating from early European colonization up to photographs and Indigenous newspapers from the mid-twentieth century. Browse through a wide range of rare and original documents from treaties, speeches and diaries, to historic maps and travel journals.”\n\nHaving access to all AM Digital collections will delight researchers for the breadth and depth of coverage and content available. The Libraries are confident that it will be an invaluable research tool for undergraduates, graduates and faculty alike.\n\nIf you have further questions as to how you can use AM Explorer for your own research endeavors, please contact your subject librarian accordingly.\n\nCitations:\n\nApartheid South Africa – https://login.proxy.binghamton.edu/login?url=https://www.apartheidsouthafrica.amdigital.co.uk\n\nBritish East India Company – https://login.proxy.binghamton.edu/login?url=http://www.eastindiacompany.amdigital.co.uk\n\nEthnomusicology – https://login.proxy.binghamton.edu/login?url=http://www.ethnomusicology.amdigital.co.uk\n\nGender: Identity and Social Change – https://login.proxy.binghamton.edu/login?url=http://www.genderidentityandsocialchange.amdigital.co.uk"
