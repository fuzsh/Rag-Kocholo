        "text": "Directory of Open Access Books This link opens in a new window\n\nThe primary aim of DOAB is to increase discoverability of Open Access books.\n\nThis is a free electronic resource and TCD cannot guarantee the stability of the connection.\n\nThe directory is open to all publishers who publish academic, peer reviewed books in Open Access and should contain as many books as possible, provided that these publications are in Open Access and meet academic standards.\n\nNineteenth Century Short Title Catalogue This link opens in a new window\n\nDefines the printed record of the English-speaking world from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the end of the First World War.\n\nMore than 1,200,000 cross-searchable records drawn from the catalogues of the Bodleian Library, the British Library, Harvard University Library, the Library of Congress, the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, the National Library of Scotland and the University Libraries of Cambridge and Newcastle.\n\nIt is now accessed via the C19: The Nineteenth Century Index.\n\nC19: The Nineteenth Century Index forms the bibliographic spine of 19th century research, comprising tens of millions of records and providing integrated access to the most important finding aids for books, periodicals, official publications, newspapers, archives, and reference material. Users can query its many component indexes simultaneously or can conduct more detailed research using search pages for specific indexes or content types.\n\nChildren's Literature and Culture This link opens in a new window\n\nExplore a stunning collection of rare books, games, ephemera, and artwork from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that reveals the socio-cultural history of these times.\n\nShowcasing innovative new publishing methods characteristic of the golden age of children’s literature, from mass-produced chapbooks to richly illustrated ‘book-beautifuls’, this resource examines the way in which new concepts were introduced to young readers, encouraging an engagement with the imagination which went on to fundamentally shape established notions of childhood.\n\nDictionary of Old English: A to I This link opens in a new window\n\nThe Dictionary of Old English (DOE) defines the vocabulary of the first six centuries (C.E. 600-1150) of the English language, using twenty-first century technology. The DOE complements the Middle English Dictionary (which covers the period C.E. 1100-1500) and the Oxford English Dictionary, the three together providing a full description of the vocabulary of English.\n\nThis release includes a new and updated interface with improved search capabilities.\n\nDigital Theatre+ This link opens in a new window\n\nThe content is mapped to English and Drama curricula, and commissioned and curated with a view to assisting educators and students in their understanding of core texts, characterisation, and the many and diverse facets of performance.\n\nIMPORTANT: Please be aware that you need to download the latest version of Chrome in order to continue using this browser to watch content on the platform.\n\nAny personal accounts created in DT+ will be cancelled after 12 months of inactivity\n\nDrama Online This link opens in a new window\n\nFull access to Play texts, Video and Audio.

Theatre Works This link opens in a new window\n\nL.A. Theatre Works is a non-profit media arts organization whose mission for over 25 years has been to present, preserve and disseminate classic and contemporary plays.\n\nThe L.A. Theatre Works Audio Play Collection for Drama Online includes more than 350 important dramatic works in streaming audio from the curated archive of the US’s premiere radio theatre company. The plays – which include some of the most significant dramatic literature of the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries – are performed by leading actors from around the world and recorded specifically for online listening.\n\nIt contains modern works from the oeuvre of American playwrights such as Arthur Miller, David Mamet and Eugene O’Neill.\n\nDrama Online: Rodenburg [Shakespeare in the present] This link opens in a new window\n\nAn acting master class with Patsy Rodenburg, (Head of Voice, Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London).\n\nRodenburg is recognised as one of the worlds leading voice teachers as well as a renowned authority on Shakespeare.\n\nFilmed on the stages of Michael Howard Studios, New York and The Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London, this video master class demonstrates Patsy Rodenburg's techniques and exercises in Movement, Speech, Body and Vocal Warm-Up.\n\nIt includes one-on-one analysis of Shakespeare’s most famous monologues, working with those actors performing speeches from Hamlet, Romeo & Juliet, Macbeth, King Lear, and many more.\n\nBibliography of British and Irish History This link opens in a new window\n\nIt provides bibliographic data on historical writing dealing with the British Isles, and with the British Empire and Commonwealth, during all periods for which written documentation is available - from 55BC to the present. It is the successor to the Royal Historical Society Bibliography of British and Irish History, available online from 2002 to 2009.\n\nThe Bibliography is a guide to the work of historians - it does not contain original sources, unless they have been edited and republished by historians (except for a selection of key sources published before 1901 derived from the printed bibliographies published for the Royal Historical Society and the American Historical Association by Oxford University Press).\n\nBritish and Irish Literature This link opens in a new window\n\nAs a key part of Western literary and cultural history, British and Irish literature encompasses a massive range of periods, authors, and works that make it one of the most active fields in academia today.\n\nAs such, this area of study invites trans-disciplinary collaboration with fields as varied as history, cultural studies, political science, and philosophy making it challenging for students and scholars to stay informed about every applicable area. In addition, a great deal of this work has moved online with the most recent scholarship, research, and statistics appearing in online databases. With advances in online searching and database technologies, researchers and practitioners can easily access library catalogs, bibliographic indexes, and other lists that show thousands of resources that might also be useful to them. In this situation what is most needed is expert guidance. Researchers and practitioners at all levels need tools that help them filter through the proliferation of information sources to material that is reliable and directly relevant to their inquiries. Oxford Bibliographies in British and Irish Literature will offer a trustworthy pathway through the thicket of information overload.\n\nBritish Library Newspapers, part VI: Ireland, 1783-1950 This link opens in a new window\n\nPart VI adds additional titles published in Ireland in the late eighteenth, across the nineteenth and during the early twentieth centuries.\n\nA significant number of these are national publications but many are more regional from cities such as Dublin, Cork and Galway as well as more rural towns like Waterford, Tuam, Ballinasloe, and Birr. It will facilitate a range of scholarship across Irish Studies and British history, allowing researchers from the variety of disciplines to access several the most formative and informed newspapers and periodicals that illuminate various aspects of Irish history, society, economy, politics and religion. Key topics include nationalism and Irish independence; Fenianism; The Roman Catholic Church; Irish diaspora; establishment of the Land League; the Irish literary revival; and sport and leisure.\n\nSeventeenth and Eighteenth Century Burney Newspapers Collection This link opens in a new window\n\nThe newspapers and news pamphlets gathered by the Reverend Charles Burney (1757 - 1817) represent the largest single collection of 17th and 18th century English news media.\n\nOver 700 bound volumes of newspapers and news pamphlets were published mostly in London, however there are also some English provincial, Irish and Scottish papers, and a few examples from the American colonies, Europe and India.\n\nBritish Library Newspapers, Part I: 1800-1900 This link opens in a new window\n\nFormerly Nineteenth Century British Library Newspapers (or 19th Century British Library Newspapers) contains 48 influential national and regional newspapers representing different political and cultural segments of the 19th century British society.\n\nRanging from early tabloids like the Illustrated Police News to radical papers like the Chartist Northern Star, publications in Part I span a vast range of national, regional, and local interests. Other notable papers of Part I include the Morning Chronicle, with famous contributors such as Henry Mayhew and John Stewart Mill; the Graphic, publishing both illustrations and news as well as illustrated fiction; and the Examiner, the radical reformist and leading intellectual journal.\n\nThe papers themselves have been carefully selected by an editorial board from the British Library whose purpose was to provide a broad yet detailed view of British life in the 19th century: from business to sport,from politics to entertainment and the arts. The collection is made up of daily and weekly publications and reflects Britain's growing role as a superpower in the 19th century world.\n\nBritish Library Newspapers, Part II: 1800-1900 This link opens in a new window\n\nPart II further expands the range of English regional newspapers and the political views represented in the programme. Researchers can find the newspapers of a number of significant towns and regions included in this collection: Nottingham, Bradford, Leicester, Sheffield, and York, as well as North Wales. The addition of two major London newspapers, The Standard and the Morning Post, helps capture conservative opinion in the nineteenth century, balancing the progressive, more liberal views of the newspapers that appear in Part I.\n\nBritish Library Newspapers, Part III: 1741-1950 This link opens in a new window\n\nPart III adds even more regional and local depth to the series, encompassing powerful provincial news journals like the Leeds Intelligencer and Hull Daily Mail, local interest publications such as the Northampton Mercury, and specialist titles such as the Poor Law Unions’ Gazette.\n\nOther noteworthy titles in Part III include the Westmoreland Gazette, whose early editor, Thomas DeQuincy (of Confessions of an English Opium Eater) was forced to resign due to his unreliability.\n\nBritish Library Newspapers, Part IV: 1732-1950 This link opens in a new window\n\nFrom key early newspaper titles like the Stamford Mercury to what is possibly the oldest magazine in the world still in publication, the Scots Magazine, Part IV offers key local and regional perspectives from cities as geographically diverse as Aberdeen, Bath, Chester, Derby, Belfast, Liverpool, and York.\n\nIn addition, Part IV includes the 1901-1950 runs of papers such as the Aberdeen Journal and Dundee Courier whose earlier newspapers are available in Part I and Part II.\n\nBritish Library Newspapers, Part V: 1746-1950 This link opens in a new window\n\nWith a concentration of titles from the northern part of the United Kingdom, Part V deepens the database's northern regional content, doubling coverage in Scotland, tripling coverage in the Midlands, and adding a significant number of northern titles to the British Library Newspapers series.\n\nPart V includes newspapers from the Scottish localities of Fife, Elgin, Inverness, Paisley, and John O’Groats, as well as towns just below the border, such as Morpeth, Alnwick, and more.

From Anglo-centric beginnings in 1902, by the mid-20th century the TLS had developed into a truly international publication, with contributors from every region of the world.\n\nUntil 1974, writings and influential criticism of hundreds of the twentieth century's most important writers and thinkers were kept anonymous to foster open discussion. The Times Literary Supplement Historical Archive now discloses the identity of these contributors.\n\nThe value of this archive lies in its reach, offering comprehensive coverage of the latest and most important publications in multiple languages.
