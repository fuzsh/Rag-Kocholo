What is happening to the name of some Adam Matthew Digital databases?

The provider Adam Matthew Digital has changed the name of a few databases.

Therefore, we will be changing those databases names in the Knowledgebase. The content of the databases, and their database ID's , will remain the same.

This change will take effect on July 13, 2023:

Actions you may need to take:

If you are a 360 MARC Updates client and have requested the custom specification that adds the database name as it appears in the Client Center/Intota to MARC records, you can expect to see some change records when you get your MARC records after July 13, 2023.

If your library uses a third-party service (such as EBSCO A-Z, etc.), custom scripts to manage data, or other non-ProQuest tools that require the database name to function, you should note the change in ProQuest's database name in order to retain the proper relationship/mapping between those tools.
