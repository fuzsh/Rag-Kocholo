Former Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Clark Haggans, who was a part of the Steelers Super Championship back in 2005, is dead at the age of 46.

So far, no cause of death has been given. Haggans was drafted in 2000 out of Colorado in the 5th round of the NFL Draft.

Haggans retired back in 2013 but ended his career with the Steelers 332 tackles and 32.5 sacks. After playing for the Steelers for eight years, he played for the Arizona Cardinals for four years and later retired with the San Francisco 49ers.

Like the Steeler team, he was on, both the Cardinals and 49ers also made Super Bowl runs as well.

This is the second time in less than a year that the Steelers football family has faced a tragic death.

Last December, just before the Christmas holidays, Steelers Hall of Fame running back Franco Harris died at the age of 72 just short of the 50th anniversary of the “Immaculate Reception.”

Harris died of natural causes but it was a tragic and surprising end to one of the greatest Steelers of all time. The organization has yet to release a statement on Haggans’s death, but more than likely they will pay tribute to the former Steeler at some point.
