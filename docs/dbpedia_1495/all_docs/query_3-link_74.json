        "text": "It might be a bit much to call Willie Williams, a former Steelers cornerback on two-different Super Bowl teams from two-separate eras, “forgotten,” but he certainly had a unique career in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Steelers made Willie Williams their sixth-round pick out of Western Carolina in the 1993 NFL Draft.\n\nAfter biding his time for two seasons, Williams emerged as a starting quarterback for the Steelers 1995 squad that lost its top corner and all-around best player, Rod Woodson, during a Week 1 overtime win vs. the Lions at old Three Rivers Stadium. Williams started 15 games during the regular season, two more in the playoffs, and was one of the fortunate players to have his name announced as he ran out of the tunnel before Super Bowl XXX.\n\nThat’s right, that 1995 Steelers team made it to the Super Bowl, and Williams played an underrated role in getting there.\n\nNot only did Williams record seven interceptions in ’95 to help lead the Steelers to an 11-5 regular-season record, but he may have made the most important play in the Steelers victory over the Colts in the AFC Championship Game at TRS.\n\nEveryone remembers Jim Harbaugh’s Hail Mary pass on the game’s final play that ALMOST settled into the arms of receiver Aaron Bailey before falling to the Astroturf. They talk about the 37-yard pass from quarterback Neil O’Donnell to receiver Ernie Mills that set up the Bam Morris game-winning touchdown plunge moments earlier. I mentioned Woodson’s injury. Carnell Lake, an accomplished safety heading into ’95, rightfully gets a ton of credit for transitioning to corner during the season and going on to have another Pro Bowl year.\n\nBut none of that would be as memorable today, or just plain would not have happened, if not for a tackle that Williams made on running back Lamont Warren late in the AFC title game with the Colts facing a third and one and clinging to a 16-13 lead. Williams recognized the run from his left-cornerback spot and raced into the backfield to make the very definition of a shoestring tackle; it was a good thing, too, because Warren had nothing but Astroturf in front of him and could have easily gained 15 or 20 yards. With precious few minutes remaining, it could have been the difference between the Steelers making it to their first Super Bowl in 16 years or once again going home losers after falling to a huge road underdog in the AFC Championship Game.\n\nWilliams was again a full-time starting cornerback for the 1996 Steelers, as Pittsburgh advanced to the divisional round before getting blown out in New England.\n\nLike most Steelers free agents in the 1990s, Williams bolted for more lucrative pastures and signed with the Seahawks. Williams started 74 games over seven seasons in Seattle and recorded 17 interceptions.\n\nWilliams quietly signed back with Pittsburgh just prior to the Steelers 2004 season. He began the year as a backup but became a starter when Chad Scott suffered a season-ending injury. Williams started 10 games at cornerback for a Pittsburgh defense that was the most dominant in the NFL. Williams started two more games in the playoffs before once again having his postseason journey end in a blowout loss to the Patriots–this time at Heinz Field.\n\nThat would be the final postseason game of Williams’ career.\n\nThis isn’t to say he wasn’t on the roster in 2005, as the Steelers overcame long odds to finally capture their One For The Thumb after a 21-10 victory over the Seahawks in Super Bowl XL. Unfortunately, after appearing in four games and starting one during the regular season, Williams did not play in any of Pittsburgh’s four postseason games.\n\nWilliams was released after the season and officially retired from the NFL.\n\nBut he did so after finally earning a ring.\n\nWilliams started 115 games during his career but only 41 with Pittsburgh.\n\nHowever, seven of Williams’s 10 career playoff appearances came as a member of the Steelers–including three in the AFC title game.\n\nSeven of Willie Williams’s eight career playoff starts came as a Steeler–including two in the AFC title game.\n\nOnly nine of Williams’s 26 career interceptions came as a Steeler, but the seven he had during the Super Bowl XXX campaign were the most he had in any single season.\n\nAnd he was a starter in Super Bowl XXX.\n\nHow many Steelers can say they played during two different Super Bowl eras? No one besides Williams can.\n\nWillie Williams did a lot of heavy lifting for two different Steelers teams that came close to winning it all and was essentially a non-factor during a year when he finally earned a Super Bowl ring.\n\nBut while Willie Williams didn’t do much to help the Steelers win their fifth Lombardi trophy, he contributed enough to a couple of earlier contenders that he can certainly wear his Super Bowl XL ring with pride.\n\nFollow @Defeoman\n\nPlease lend a hand by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc... Thanks.\n\nAs the month of June ended two things caught my attention:\n\n1. The Steelers seemingly avoided their dreaded June Curse\n\n2. The Pennsylvania State legislature was considering changing the official state song\n\nThe former is most welcome, given that June is the month that where the Steelers lost Chuck Noll, see Willie Colon’s season end due to an off season injury, cut David DeCastro and have Stephon Tuitt lose is brother, ultimately leading him to retire.\n\nIf the former is about avoiding tragedy, the former is about embracing opportunity. That’s right. If the Pennsylvania State Legislature wants to change the state song, then there can be no better option than Jimmy Psihoulis “Western Pennsylvania Polka.\n\nResidents of Philadelphia, Lancaster, Allentown, King of Prussia might object, saying the State Song should be about the entire state, not just its western part. Sure, that makes superficial sense.\n\nBut the truth is, popular culture already gives those parts of the state already disproportionate share of their adieu.\n\nThink about it, Philly has the Cheesesteak and Philadelphia Cream Cheese, the latter of which is a global commodity (yes, you can even find it here in Buenos Aires, if you look for it.) Its most famous resident, Ben Franklin, is on the 100 dollar bill. And of course one of Tom Hanks breakthrough roles was in Philadelphia – sure, he played also Mr. Rogers, but he didn’t even attempt the accent.\n\nSpeaking of accents, the Philly/Southwestern Pennsylvania accent got four-star treatment in the Mayor of Eastown. Lot’s and lots of movies and TV shows get filmed and/or set in Pittsburgh.\n\nBut when was the last time you heard a character ask, “Sorry, but yinz mind getting owta of my road for a minute? I gotta I redd the table. And hey, as you’re getting up can you hand me those gumbands?”\n\nLancaster has the movie Witness and the Amish tradition. Allentown has its own Billy Joel song. The name “King of Prussia” evokes images of Bismarck and 19th century German might.\n\nMore importantly, Jimmy Pol’s Western Pennsylvania Polka stands on its own.\n\nAs the official Pennsylvania state song, it will teach citizens about the Commonwealth’s history and offer true life lessons that everyone can benefit. A simple, stanza-by-stanza analysis of the lyrics proves this:\n\nDa-Da-Da-Da-Ta-Da – Charge!\n\nWe’re from the town with that great football team,\n\nWe cheer the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nChuck Noll and all his friends are all on the field.\n\nGo out and get them Steelers.\n\nToo many kids and adults today sit on couches with faces fixed screens. What better antidote than meeting friends on the field to play?\n\nBradshaw, and Rocky, and Franco and Lynn,\n\nWe love you Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nIt’s been many years in coming,\n\njust keep that Steelers machinery humming\n\nThe last time lines bring home an important message: Good things take time, so it’s important to appreciate them when they do come.\n\nDefense, Defense, make them scramble, intercept that ball.\n\nDefense, Defense, keeps the Steelers always best of all!\n\nMean Joe, Mean Joe, do your thing against the other team,\n\nYou start from year to year, we’re so glad you play here,\n\nNow join with me, and sing the Steelers cheer-er-ER!\n\nJoe Greene single handedly shifted the trajectory of an entire franchise – what an excellent example of empowerment in action — from a Penn State grad no less!.\n\nWe’re from the town with that great football team,\n\nWe cheer the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nWinning’s a habit, not only a dream,\n\nGo out and get them Steelers!\n\nGood habits lead to consistent, successful performance.\n\nGerela’s Gorrilas are here for the show,\n\nand so is Franco’s Army,\n\nIt’s been many years in coming,\n\njust keep that Steelers machinery humming.\n\nIn just 12 words we’re celebrating conservationism, diversity and lauding the contributions of immigrants to the Keystone State.\n\nOffense, Offense, take that football whole way up the field!\n\nOffense, Offense, let’s score and score and never ever yield!\n\nFranco, Franco, can you believe we have a running game?\n\nTake the initiative and always remain persistent – what state legislator could argue with a song that teaches that lesson?\n\nThe Steelers are so great, and so hard to overrate,\n\nGood things, will come, to those who work and wait.\n\nCharge!\n\nReinforcing the reality that you achieve excellence through patience and hard work instead of instant gratification.\n\nSo really the case is clear.\n\nThe move to change Pennsylvania’s state song is a bi-partisan effort pushed by Reps Craig Williams and Joe Ciresi.\n\nThe only remaining is, gentleman, what are you waiting for?\n\nFollow @SteelCurtainRis\n\nPlease lend a hand by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc... Thanks.\n\nLiving up to the Steelers’ rich history of outside linebackers is not easy.\n\nJust ask Jason Gildon. When he left Pittsburgh following the 2003 season, he did so as the organization’s all-time leader in sacks with 77. Yet, when fans talk about Steelers’ legends at the position, Gildon’s name is rarely mentioned.\n\nSure, Gildon’s name might eventually come up when it comes to retired greats.\n\nStill, it would almost surely be an afterthought after fans rattle off names like Jack Ham, Andy Russell, Mike Merriweather, Greg Lloyd, Kevin Greene, Joey Porter, LaMarr Woodley and James Harrison, the 2008 Defensive Player of the Year who eclipsed Gildon’s mark during his storied Steelers career.\n\nIf you thought being Jason Gildon was tough, try being the guy who replaced him.\n\nI’m talking about Clark Haggans, a fifth-round pick out of Colorado State in the 2000 NFL Draft.\n\nNot only was Haggans a mid-round pick from Colorado’s second-most famous college football team, but he wasn’t even the most well-known alumni from that team — at least among Steelers players. For that matter, Haggans wasn’t even the most famous Steelers outside linebacker from Colorado State. Porter, a third-round pick in 1999, would quickly earn that distinction after becoming a full-time starter during the Steelers 2000 season and recording 10.5 quarterback sacks.\n\nIt’s a pity, too, because if you do a little digging into Colorado State’s history, you’ll learn that Haggans, not Peezy, is the school’s all-time leader in sacks with 33.\n\nBack to Haggans’s Steelers career.\n\nWhile Porter was quickly establishing himself as one of the best young outside linebackers in the NFL in the early-2000s, Haggans had to bide his time as a backup and special teams player.\n\nIt was as a reserve in 2002 when Clark Haggans had a bit of a breakout year and recorded 6.5 sacks.\n\nThis was Gildon’s penultimate season in Pittsburgh and perhaps paved the way for Haggans to ultimately succeed him as the starter on the strong side.\n\nHaggans finally became the man on the left side in 2004. He would go on to start 13 games and tally six sacks.\n\nHaggans’s best season came in 2005 when he posted nine quarterback sacks for the Super Bowl-bound Steelers. Haggans notched another 1.5 sacks in the postseason, including a takedown of Matt Hasselbeck forcing the Seahawks to punt on the first possession of Super Bowl XL.\n\nBut while that sack was huge, the holding penalty Haggans drew on tackle Sean Locklear early in the fourth quarter was bigger. Pittsburgh led, 14-10, but the Seahawks were driving and looked to have a first and goal after a pass from Hasselback to tight end Jerramy Stevens. Unfortunately for Seattle, Locklear, who was beaten badly by Haggans, was called for the controversial infraction. While that penalty will always be controversial in the eyes of Seahawks fans (Haggans may have also been offsides on the play — others will differ), there is no doubt it altered the course of the game.\n\nIke Taylor intercepted Hasselbeck moments later, and the rest is history.\n\nHaggans started 61 games during his Steelers career and recorded 32.5 sacks. He departed following the 2007 campaign, as the Steelers made room for LaMarr Woodley, the next to carve his name into the Steelers’ history book of notable-to-great outside linebackers.\n\nAfter playing four years in Arizona where he recorded 14 more sacks, Haggans finished his career with the NFC Champion 49ers in 2012 — his final game was a loss to the Ravens in Super Bowl LVII.\n\nClark Haggans, who tragically passed away on Tuesday, June 20th at the age of 46, will likely rarely be mentioned when fans talk about the Steelers’ rich history at outside linebacker.\n\nBut it’s certainly not an easy history to live up to, and it’s much easier to be an afterthought than someone who sticks around and carves out a nice little niche for himself at the position.\n\nClark Haggans may not have been a Steelers’ legend at outside linebacker, but he was far from an afterthought.\n\nRIP to a man who did the position proud for the Steelers organization.\n\nFollow @Defeoman\n\nPlease lend a hand by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc... Thanks.\n\nMy favorite time of the Steelers’ offseason has arrived.\n\nI’m talking about that “dead” period between OTAs (Organized Team Activities)/minicamp and the start of Steelers training camp.\n\nYep, there’s always a huge content void during the second half of June and most of July until the boys report to Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, to prepare for yet another Steelers regular season.\n\nThe first day of Steelers training camp in 2023 is July 26, and nothing will be the same when it comes to Steelers news from then until their season wraps up in either January or, for the truly positive pollyannas out there, on February 11, 2024 (the date of Super Bowl LVIII).\n\nBut in the six weeks before that, following the final day of last week’s mandatory minicamp on June 15, there will be little tangible news to report on as it pertains to the Pittsburgh Steelers (provided the Steelers “June Curse” doesn’t strike again.”)\n\nHowever, Steelers fans being who they are, Steelers media being what it is, and the 24/7/365 obsession with the NFL being what it is, the desire for black-and-gold-related content will still be there.\n\nIt used to be that a writer such as myself could use the dead period of the offseason to focus on stories involving Steelers’ history. I could honor heroes from the past who we may have forgotten about. I felt like I had a license to talk about unheralded players from yesteryear, guys who will never be remembered but still contributed to some successful Steelers seasons (Weegie Thompson comes to mind).\n\nSpeaking of Weegie Thompson, I may have even written a story or two about the 1984 Pittsburgh Steelers and their unexpected appearance in the AFC Championship Game. What about that wild wildcard win over the Oilers down in the Astrodome on December 31, 1989?\n\nJune and July used to be the time of year for such stories, but it’s just not like that anymore. Now, writers (both credentialed and non-credentialed) as well as radio hosts and podcasters try to fill the dead period with nothing but speculation and drama.\n\nWhat player said what on some podcast?\n\nAre there any free agents still on the open market that Pittsburgh should pursue before training camp?\n\nCan you believe what that numbskull receiver did on TikTok?\n\nIn my opinion, this is mostly all garbage. Having said that, I often find myself writing about such speculation and drama. Why? It gets a great reaction. Steelers fans love to speculate. They love to be mad. They love to be outraged. They love to work themselves up into a frenzy over the most ridiculous things (Devin Bush’s stupid joke about a falling cat from two years ago comes to mind).\n\nSteelers fans love to talk about trades and signing free agents.\n\nIt simply never stops, not even in June or July.\n\nI do have some advice: Stop and smell the flowers.\n\nI know I always do. The summer months before training camp are when I begin to fall in love with the Steelers and the NFL all over again.\n\nIt’s easy to get jaded when every story involving the Steelers is about Kenny Pickett’s hand size, Matt Canada’s schoolyard offense and Mike Tomlin’s lack of a playoff win since 2017.\n\nIt’s easy to get worked into a frenzy over some receiver’s TikTok account (although, I can’t imagine why).\n\nBut revisiting the Steelers’ past will never leave you jaded or outraged.\n\nEven learning about the bad times is comforting because we know that they led to some memorable years.\n\nGo on YouTube and watch Steelers highlight films from the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, heck, even the 2000s and 2010s. Take some time dig into some long-form pieces and learn about the 1989 Steelers or to relive the Cowher Years.\n\nWatch those America’s Game films that chronicle every Super Bowl season since the first one. You don’t just have to watch the ones involving the Steelers, either. There are other NFL dynasties and champions to explore and learn about.\n\nWhat about memorable playoff games involving the Steelers? Those are available in highlight form, as well as in full broadcast form. Check out Steel City Star’s Twitter feed. Check out Ron Lippock’s Steelers Takeaways where you can find interviews from the 1991 Steelers Helper Assistant Water Boy to Super Bowl Architect Dick Haley — and everyone in between.\n\nSocial media can actually be a beautiful thing, especially when we can go back and explore great sports memories.\n\nHeck, go back and watch features involving the Ice Bowl or the Fog Bowl.\n\nI know it sounds crazy to focus on teams besides the Steelers, but it’s not that bad.\n\nYou know what I can’t wait for? That moment when I walk past some football field this summer, and I smell that freshly-cut grass. It’s going to get me all jazzed up for the NFL. It’s going to remind me why I love the game of football so much.\n\nThere’s more to being a Steelers fan than just being worked into a frenzy 24/7/365 over real or imagined drama.\n\nLearning and writing about Steelers history is quite therapeutic.\n\nI encourage you to try one or both of those before the start of the 2023 regular season.\n\nFollow @Defeoman\n\nPlease lend a hand by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc... Thanks.\n\nTwo seasons, one catch for two yards on third and 6 in 41-10 loss. Alas, that stat will define Anthony Miller’s Steelers resume as the team announced his waiver to create roster space for Nick Kwiatkoski.\n\nThe Chicago Bears drafted Anthony Miller in the 2nd round of the 2018 NFL Draft. Yet in three years at the Windy City, Miller never started more than 7 games. The Bears traded him to the Texans in July 2021, but he only lasted in Houston until October 6th. The Steelers signed shortly thereafter opening the door to his one catch 2 yard career in Pittsburgh.\n\nStill, Anthony Miller impressed a lot of people in training camp during the summer of 2022 and appeared as a roster lock prior to going on injured reserve in August. The Steelers quickly offered him a futures contract in January and his name was mentioned along side Calvin Austin III as it became apparent that Omar Khan would neither use a premium pick nor a major free agent signing on a wide receiver.\n\nHowever, the Steelers did trade for Allen Robinson prior to the 2023 NFL Draft.\n\nThey’ve also signed Hakeem Butler whom they took a long look at going into the 2019 NFL Draft. And of course they’re bringing back Diontae Johnson, George Pickens and Gunner Olszewski.\n\nSteelers Bolster Special Teams with Nick Kwiatkoski and Rex Sunahara Signings\n\nIn letting Anthony Miller go the Steelers gave Special Teams coach Danny Smith a boost by signing linebacker Nick Kwiatkoski. The Bethel Park native and West Virginia alumni was a fourth round pick of the Chicago Bears in the 2016 NFL Draft. He brings the Steelers 89 games of experience with 34 starts for the Bears and then the Raiders.\n\nHowever, injuries limited his 2021 campaign to just 66 defensive snaps for the Raiders and he saw zero defensive snaps on his most recent stop with the Atlanta Falcons. He did log close to 400 combined special teams stops in those cities and special teams will be his ticket to a roster spot in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Steelers also signed long snapper Rex Sunahara to compete with incumbent Christian Kuntz.\n\nThe Kwiatkoski signing sends a strong signal that the Steelers have turned a page from both Derek Watt and Benny Snell, two running backs who saw few carries over the last two years, but were both special teams standouts.\n\nFollow @SteelCurtainRis\n\nPlease lend a hand by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc... Thanks.\n\n“And then they started running the ball down their throats.”\n\nThat was my first recollection of Stan Savran as a Pittsburgh sports broadcaster. I can’t remember if it was on TV or radio, but he was doing some postgame show after the Steelers defeated the Patriots, 24-20, in a preseason game in Knoxville, Tennessee, on August 14, 1982.\n\nPerhaps, it was fitting that I don’t know if my first memories of Savran were on television or radio. I started following Pittsburgh sports in the early ’80s, and that man was always somewhere talking about them.\n\nIn other words, Savran was omnipresent as a Pittsburgh sports broadcaster and journalist for most of my life.\n\nSavran, who passed away at 76 on Monday after a battle with lung cancer, began his career in Pittsburgh in 1976 after a stint in Florida where he did play-by-play for the World Football League.\n\nSavran started out at radio stations WWSW and then KQV in the ’70s, but by the time I found him in the ’80s, he was part of WTAE’s Action 4 Sports Team, a lineup that included Bill Hillgrove, who still does radio play-by-play for both the Steelers and University of Pittsburgh Panthers football and men’s basketball teams; John Steigerwald; Guy Junker; and, of course, Myron Cope, a Steelers and Pittsburgh broadcasting icon who, among other things, created The Terrible Towel.\n\nCan you imagine that kind of broadcasting roster on the local level today?\n\nYou talk about star power. But it was different in the 1980s. ESPN wasn’t really the worldwide leader yet, and fanatics like me looked to the local news stations for the daily scoop on the Steelers, Pirates, Penguins and Panthers. Savran served as a sports anchor and reporter for WTAE in the 1980s, and he also followed Cope with his own talk show five nights a week over on the radio side.\n\nAt various points in his career, Savran did everything from pre and postgame shows for the Steelers, Pirates and Penguins, to television, to radio. Savran even did radio play-by-play for Penn State football in the ’80s and was in the booth for the Nittany Lions‘ 1986 National Championship win over Miami. Savran also hosted the weekly Penn State football highlight show on the television side.\n\nSavran even wrote a weekly sports column for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in the early-2000s.\n\nOf Savran’s many roles, however, none were more iconic than as the host of Sportsbeat from 1991-2009.\n\nSportsbeat was a local cable show that Savran co-hosted with Junker through 2003 before finishing out as a solo host until 2009. The show–basically, a radio show on television–saw many icons sit down and talk to Stan and Guy over nearly two decades, including Reggie Jackson, Bill Cowher, and, yes, Chuck Noll.\n\nMy favorite Sportsbeat episode was also my most therapeutic, and it aired on October 15, 1992, just one night after the Pirates lost Game 7 of the National League Championship Series to the Atlanta Braves. Pittsburgh is a proud sports town that was dubbed The City of Champions in the 1970s thanks to four Steelers Super Bowl victories, two Pirates World Series titles, and a national championship for the Pitt football team. That reputation was strengthened in the early-’90s thanks to back-to-back Stanley Cup victories for the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nBut as great as all of those memories were for Pittsburgh’s citizens, none of them may have matched the low that everyone felt the day after the Pirates blew a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7 in Atlanta with a trip to the World Series on the line.\n\nI was 20 and in tears that night. Downtown Pittsburgh was like a morgue the next morning.\n\nI turned to Stan and Guy to talk me off the bridge (metaphorically, of course). The late, great Beano Cook was a guest on that night’s show and also did his part to make me feel better.\n\nIt’s been over 30 years since Sid Bream was safe at home plate, and I still can’t go back and watch Game 7. But I remember how a guy from Cleveland and his two colleagues got me through the worst sports loss I think I’ll ever experience.\n\nThat’s a special kind of talent.\n\nThat’s right, Savran was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and grew up a Browns and Indians fan. But while he remained a diehard fan of Cleveland’s Major League Baseball team up until the day he died, he left Cleveland’s football team –the original one that moved to Baltimore and was renamed the Ravens in 1996 — behind many years earlier and became a supporter of the Black and Gold.\n\nIn addition to his many years covering the team on television, radio and even in print, Savran was very instrumental in the creation of the Steelers Hall of Honor in 2017.\n\nMore importantly, Savran became a supporter of Pittsburgh and called it his home over the final 47 years of his life.\n\n“AWWW, BLEEP YOU!” ‘\n\nThat was the first call to the Steelers postgame show following a devastating 34-31 overtime loss to the Titans in the 2002 Steelers divisional-round playoff game on January 11, 2003. The caller was seeking comfort and validation after a controversial running into the kicker penalty gave Tennessee new life and a chance to win the game. But Savran, the host of this postgame show on the Steelers Radio Network, calmly said, “You can’t run into the kicker. It’s as simple as that.”\n\nClearly, the caller didn’t like Stan’s answer.\n\nAs stated earlier, Savran was a fixture in the Pittsburgh sports scene for nearly 50 years, but even though he was very opinionated and told it like it was, the venom that the caller spewed that night was the exception and not the rule.\n\nSavran often disagreed with callers and was critical of players and coaches, but he seemed to have a knack for not taking cheap shots — a lost art in the current sports landscapes, one that’s dominated by social media and one where opinions and people are often called garbage (or worse).\n\nWhile just about every Pittsburgh sports personality is often a target for the venom spewed by “fans” on social media, Savran was too respected to get that kind of treatment.\n\nMaybe that’s because he was known as “The Godfather of Pittsburgh sports,” and you never disrespect The Godfather, not if you know what’s good for you.\n\nThe whole “Mount Rushmore of…” talking point is now a tired cliche, but if there was a Mount Rushmore of Pittsburgh sports broadcasters, Stan Savran would surely have his likeness carved into it.\n\nRest in peace, Stan, so many of us really did love the show.\n\nFollow @Defeoman\n\nPlease lend a hand by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc... Thanks.\n\nA few weeks back when the Steelers voted against the NFL’s decision to flex Thursday night games during weeks 13-17, I wondered, “Maybe Franco told Art Rooney about Mateo?”\n\nMateo Labriola (no relation to Bob, or so he insists) is an Argentine Steelers fan who was fortunate enough to meet Franco Harris on a while visiting the Pro Football Hall of Fame. I shared their story in my eulogy for Franco. Here’s the digest version:\n\nIt was December 2017 and Mateo was visiting the United States to see the Steelers. He was at Paul Brown Stadium the night Ryan Shazier’s career ended.\n\nBut Mateo’s journey wasn’t making a one-act show.\n\nHe had tickets to see the Steelers vs the Ravens at Heinz Field the following week. In between, he stopped in Canton to visit the Pro Football Hall of Fame, where fortune brought him together with Franco Harris. It’s a good thing for Mateo that there was no flexing of Thursday night games back in December 2017, or otherwise their encounter may never have happened.\n\nHad the NFL, in their infinite greed, been able to flex either of those games, Mateo would have been forced reprogram his entire trip. Fate could have easily forced him to sacrifice his trip to Canton.\n\nAnd truthfully, that would have been the least of his problems. In December 2017 the Argentine peso US Dollar exchange rate was 17.4 to 1 (today it is 250.5 to 1 – the black market rate is nearly twice that, but that’s another story.) Rebooking hotel rooms and travel could have easily been cost prohibitive.\n\nHe even might have been forced to miss one of the games.\n\nMateo is hardly the only international Steelers fan to scrimp and save to make pilgrimage to see the Steelers. Shortly after news of the decision to flex Thursday night games broke, I got this in a WhatsApp feed hosted by Mexican Steelers fans.\n\nFor those who don’t speak Spanish, this is a flyer advertising a trip to see the Steelers December 3rd and December 7th games against the Cardinals and the Patriots, with a return flight to Mexico on December the 8th.\n\nThis seems like a petty good deal, but those games fall on weeks 13 and 14, inside the NFL’s Thursday night flex window. That means if both the Cardinals and Steelers are hot late in the season, the NFL could decide to pull that game to Thursday night.\n\nConversely, if either the Steelers or that Patriots are struggling come December, the NFL could simply decide to push their Thursday night game to Sunday.\n\nI asked friend who knows organizers of the trip and he replied, “…No tienen plan B” – they don’t have a plan B. So if the NFL decides to flex either of those games, then I guess those Mexican fans will simply be SOL.\n\nSure, they’ll be 28 days advanced notice before a game is flexed to Thursday night, but changing international flight plans will still be an expensive nightmare.\n\nI opened this article with a bit of a while lie.\n\nYes, I did think of Mateo when I heard about flexing Thursday night games. But no, I don’t really think that Franco Harris mentioned anything about meeting Mateo to Art Rooney II. He didn’t need to.\n\nLike his father Dan Rooney and his grandfather Art Rooney Sr. before him, Art Rooney II understand that the fans who bust their asses day in and day out, the ones who revel in tailgating, the ones who wouldn’t dream of trading in an Iron City and seat in Section 188 for chardonnay and a spot in the luxury box are what make the NFL the power house it is.\n\nThat’s the same sentiment that led Dan Rooney to buy hundreds of delivery pizzas for fans waiting in the snow to buy tickets to the 1995 Steelers AFC Championship game.\n\nIn that light, it is fitting that the New York Giants, New York Jets, Chicago Bears, Las Vegas Raiders, Detroit Lions, Cincinnati Bengals joined Pittsburgh Steelers in opposing Thursday Night flexing.\n\nWith the exception of the Jets, those teams make up what’s left of the league’s “old guard owners” – owners of teams who have enough institutional memory to recall a time when the NFL didn’t dominate popular culture, when the NFL had to fight for the attention, loyalty and and yes, the money of the “average fan.”\n\nThat’s something the other 25 NFL owners now take for granted.\n\nThey should not.\n\nFollow @SteelCurtainRis\n\nPlease lend a hand by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc... Thanks.\n\nThe Watch Tower has been dim for quite a while, but its lights shine again today with a focus on a major Steelers media figure manning up, making a story out of a non-story and draft war room nuggets.\n\nBob Labriola Mans Up\n\nDick Haley’s death marked the passing of yet another of the architects of the Steelers Dynasty of the 1970’s.\n\nAs Haley’s role in building four Super Bowl Championships doesn’t get the attention that Dan Rooney, Chuck Noll, Art Rooney Jr. and Bill Nunn Jr.’s roles do, the Watch Tower made an extra effort to soak up as much as possible from his eulogies.\n\nBut in reading Bob Labriola’s eulogy a quote from Dick Haley sounded familiar.\n\nSo the Watch Tower reached out to Ron Lippock who seemed to have published the quote before, and the Steelers Takeaways author confirmed that the quote indeed had come from his 2012 interview with Dick Haley.\n\nLippock contacted Labriola, and to his credit the editor of Steelers.com immediately manned up:\n\nRampant content stealing is a depressing downside of the digital age. Often, if not most of the time, it it’s not a question of who has the idea, the insight or who is breaking news, but who has the ability to push it to their followers. Rarely do those who engage in that behavior recognize it let alone apologize for it.\n\nBob Labriola, who assuredly made an honest mistake, acknowelged it immediately and made things right. In doing so, he set an example for all of us. Good for you Bob.\n\nMitch Tribusky Staying with Steelers – The Non-Story of the Century\n\nArt Rooney II does his annual State of the Steelers sit down with the press after the season is over, and he rarely, if ever, speaks after that.\n\nBut the flip side is that the Steelers President isn’t coy.\n\nYes, he is guarded with his words. But if he says the Steelers are leaning in certain way, expect his lieutenants to follow in that direction. After the 2009 season he said the Steelers need to run better. And guess what? The Steelers ran better in 2010. In January 2017 he said the Steelers would probably draft a quarterback, and sure enough they picked Joshua Dobbs.\n\nSo when Art Rooney II opened the 2023 off season by confirming that the Steelers expected Mitch Trubisky back, that should have ended any and all questions about Trubisky’s future in Pittsburgh.\n\nExcept the opposite happened.\n\nWhen Omar Khan spoke to reporters at the NFL Combine a month later, reporters asked him if Tribuisky would be back, Khan confirmed he would, and the exchange spawned dozens (if not hundreds) of stories from both bloggers and the professional press alike.\n\nBut you’d figure that the “story” would have ended with Khan’s comments.\n\nExcept it didn’t.\n\nOne month later reporters asked Mike Tomlin about Tribuisky at the NFL Owners Meeting, where Tomlin confirmed (again) that the Steelers were keeping Tribuisky. And again the exchange spawned dozens (if not hundreds) of stories from both the professional press and bloggers alike.\n\nIn the past the Watch Tower has wondered, “If a reporter breaks news and it doesn’t go viral is it still a scoop?” with Jim Wexell getting Ben Roethlisberger on the record confirming his plans to return before the Jaguars playoff game, only to have Roethlisberger say the same thing after the loss and have it treated as “new news.”\n\nHere, the opposite has happened.\n\nEach of the Steelers top three officials all confirmed that Mitch Tribuisky was in the team’s long term plans, yet somehow both bloggers and writers kept spinning yarns about scenarios that would see him leave Pittsburgh right up until Trubisky signed signed a contract extension.\n\nWho knows? Maybe next off season reporters can try coaxing Khan, Tomlin or Rooney into saying, “Yes we’ll wear dark jerseys at home and white ones on the road next year” to see if that generates page views.\n\nDonahoe’s Reveal on Steelers Draft Strategy in the ‘90’s\n\nTom Donahoe joined the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1986 as a BLESTO scout and quickly rose to Director of Pro Player Personnel and Development in 1989 before ascending to Director of Football Operations in 1992, upon Chuck Noll’s retirement.\n\nWith Bill Cowher, Donahoe oversaw the Steeler return to contender status during the 1990’s, but ultimately clashes with The Chin came to a head in 1999, and Dan Rooney sided with his head coach.\n\nStill, Donahoe’s service to the Steelers from ’86 to until early 2000 make him one of the organization’s most informed insiders from that period. Yet, he’s seldom spoken about the organization since leaving.\n\nJim Wexell has changed that in a big way to the tune of a 4,301 word interview as part of research for his book On the Clock, the History of the Steelers Draft. Wexell shared the full interview with Steel City Insider subscribers last spring.\n\nThe interview is a pure gold for Steelers history buffs, as Donahoe shares insights into how stars from the ‘90s like Greg Lloyd, Rod Woodson, Dermontii Dawson, Levon Kirkland, Joel Steed, Darren Perry, and Chad Brown made their way to Pittsburgh.\n\nDonahoe also offers draft room back stories about players such as Alan Faneca, Hines Ward, Deshea Townsend and Aaron Smith who’d go on to help Bill Cowher and Mike Tomlin win Super Bowl XL and Super Bowl XLIII.\n\nAny one of Donahoe’s 36 answers would suffice to earn Wexell Watch Tower kudos, but here’s an exceptional exchange:\n\nQ: Did it hurt you guys economically not having the new stadium in free agency?\n\nTD: It was a challenge. But we always tried to prepare for the guys that we thought were probably not going to be here to replace them. Maybe not to the same degree but we would at least have a player waiting in the wings where we wouldn’t have to just go out and buy a free agent. Although we did that the one year with Kevin Greene. He was a great pickup for us at that time. But Chad Brown was a tough loss.\n\nTom Donahoe’s answer might not qualify as “news” or a “revelation” for fans who suffered through those annual free agent exoduses during the 1990’s. But, to the Watch Tower’s knowledge, this is the first time that someone from the organization actually confirmed that anticipated free agent losses shaped the Steelers draft strategy in the 90’s.\n\nAnd for that Jim Wexell earns a double dose of Watch Tower Kudos.\n\nFollow @SteelCurtainRis\n\nPlease lend a hand by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc... Thanks.\n\nThe Athletic’s Mark Kaboly came out with something interesting at the end of the first week of Steelers 2023 OTAs: Namely that Steelers coaches are exploring ways to get Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren.\n\nCredit Kaboly for delivering one of juiciest nuggets of come out of what are normally nearly newsless Organized Team Work Outs.\n\nOr did he deliver a nugget?\n\nMaybe he did, maybe he didn’t. You are wise don your Doubting Thomas cap on this one. But before we delve into the nuances of the question, let’s look at the facts.\n\nFirst, Kaboly doesn’t simply acknowledge that fans have a right to be skeptical, he gives them reasons to reinforce their skepticism. He points out that the combos of Le’Veon Bell and DeAngelo Williams, James Conner and Jaylen Samuels, and Harris and Warren have been on the field a total of 24 times.\n\nHowever, he gets Jaylen Warren on the record explaining, “They have said they are planning to find ways to get us both on the field at the same time and just do different things with me.”\n\nKaboly goes further to point out that Matt Canada has been tinkering with a two-back offense and cites the success the Steelers had last year when they had two backs on the field. (Fun Fact: While its clear the Steelers won’t bring Derek Watt back, they were 7-1 in games where Watt got a carry. Just say’in…)\n\nAll of this is encouraging news to us Generation X Steelers fans who still pine nostalgically for a return tothe old Pro Set offensive backfield (cue the “If it was good enough for Franco and Rocky why isn’t it good enough for The Bus and FWP?” quotes), but encouraging only to a point.\n\nWe have heard stories like this come out of OTAs before.\n\nIn fact in 2019 Jim Wexell got confirmation from Jaylen Samuels that the Steelers were experimenting with putting him in the same backfield as James Conner. By Kaboly’s count, that happened 11 times in 2019.\n\nAnd of course they’ve been other rumblings at other points in the 21st century about the two back offense returning to Pittsburgh, just as stories about “this year the Steelers will give the fullback a few carries each game” and “we’re gonna throw to the tight end more” were training camp staples during the 1990’s. That never happened.\n\nBut why then, might this time be different?\n\nWell, let’s just say that Kaboly has established some credibility here.\n\nLast year, on June 7th to be precise, Kaboly got Steelers running backs coach Eddie Faulkner on the record discussing his plans to reduce Najee Harris’ snap count. At the time, I read the story with great interest but finished with a big mental “Yeah, right.”\n\nBut in 2022, Najee Harris had 313 touches of the ball as opposed to 381 in 2021. Moreover, his snap count dropped further, from 980 offensive snaps to 763 offensive snaps.\n\nOne of the reasons why the Steelers were able to but reduce Harris’ workload and get him off the field more often is that Jaylen Warren essentially forced coaches to find ways to get him on the field.\n\nMaybe, just maybe Harris and Warren will find ways to force coaches to put them out together….\n\nFollow @SteelCurtainRis\n\nPlease lend a hand by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc... Thanks.\n\nDo AI platforms pose an existential threat to sports bloggers?\n\nA short while ago this question was laughable. Today? Not so much. The ability of ChatGPT and other AI platforms to answer complex questions with coherent, comprehensive responses in mere seconds is downright scary.\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised to see the owners of one or more “Content Aggregation” sites test the waters this fall by using an AI platform to produce post-game summaries and/or to synthesize articles using transcripts from coaches’ press conferences.\n\nSo if the “Content Aggregators” need be ware, what about those of us in the “mom and pop” Steelers blogging space? Meaning in those of us who strive to produce original articles and avoid (or at least minimize) content aggregation?\n\nI wondered about that, so I thought I’d do a test, by challenging ChatGPT to answer a not so simple question: Is Rod Rust’s contribution to the Steelers defensive legacy overlooked?\n\nIf you’re sitting there asking, “Who is Rod Rust?” I suggest you be patient, and do anything but rely on ChatGPT for your answer:\n\nWow. Where do we start?\n\nChatGPT begins off on the right foot by confirming that Rod Rust’s “contributions are not as widely recognized as some other prominent figures associated with the team.” That is correct. But of course we knew that – but what we’re asking is if that lack of recognition is justified or not.\n\nThings go downhill after that. Fast.\n\nNext, ChatGPT tells that Rod Rust served as the Steelers defensive coordinator from 1992 to 1994. This is wrong. Dom Capers was the Steelers defensive coordinator from ’92 to ’94. The next part of the sentence is even worse, where ChatGPT tells us: “His tenure coincided with a period of relative decline of the defense.”\n\nExcuse me?\n\nAnyone with a pulse knows that the Steelers defense improved in 1992 with Bill Cowher’s arrival, and continued to improve through 1994. By Steelers 1994 season they were calling it “Blitzburgh” as Rod Woodson, Kevin Greene, Greg Lloyd, and Carnell Lake were in their primes, with Chad Brown, Levon Kirkland and Joel Steed coming into their own as starters and future Pro Bowlers.\n\nGiven that the “Blitzburgh” defense never won a Super Bowl (thanks Neil!) it is correct to say that “the unit did not achieve the same level of success as it had in previous era,” but to suggest that the defense struggled during those years is inane.\n\nThe next paragraph is essentially fluff – except for when it comes to Dick LeBeau. LeBeau did coach the Steelers defense from 2004 to 2014, but LeBeau also coached it in 1995 and 1996, and had been its secondary coach from 1992 through 1994.\n\nWhere ChatGPT a human, I’d suspect that it glazed over LeBeau’s role in the Blitzburgh era simply to avoid highlighting a fact that weakens its core argument. Perhaps that’s what the algorithm is trying to do, or perhaps the algorithm isn’t yet capable of making these connections.\n\nSteelers Bloggers Not Threatened by ChatGPT – for Now at Least\n\nLet’s agree that Rod Rust occupies a pretty obscure niche in Steelers defensive history. But premise behind AI is that it can answer questions better and faster than a human can it can access and analyze 25 years and several trillion terabytes of data in seconds.\n\nAI failed this test miserably. Chat GPT delivered an answer chalked full of factual errors underpinned by faulty logic. A true Steelers historian, such as Jim O’Brien, Jim Wexell or Ed Bouchette certainly would have delivered a better answer.\n\nWith that said, the other premise of AI is that it can learn from its mistakes.\n\nI’d wager that if we pose the exact same question to ChatGPT a year from now, the bot’s answer will probably at least be free of factual mistakes.\n\nA Quick Word on Rod Rust\n\nFor the record, Rod Rust served as the Steelers defensive coordinator under Chuck Noll in 1989. Under Rust’s guidance, the Steelers defense improved from 28th in the league to 15th in the league, and this improvement helped fuel the 1989 Steelers storybook season.\n\nAlthough Rust left in 1990 to become the Patriots head coach, his disciple Dave Brazil succeeded him. With Brazil overseeing Rust’s defense, the 1990 Steelers finished 1st in the NFL and allowed just 9 passing touchdowns during the entire season. Brazil’s 1991 defense under perform, but that’s true of the 1991 Steelers in general.\n\nRod Woodson cites Rust as a formative influence on his Hall of Fame career, explaining that it was Rust who taught him how to analyze film and breakdown opposing offenses.\n\nIn my humble opinion, Rod Rust’s contribution is undervalued.\n\nWho knows? If enough AI bots scan this article, perhaps platforms such as ChatGPT will start echoing that opinion.\n\nFollow @SteelCurtainRis\n\nPlease lend a hand by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc...
