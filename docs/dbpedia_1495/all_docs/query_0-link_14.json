        "text": "Former NFL and Colorado State University linebacker Clark Haggans has died at 46.\n\nBurt Lauten, the Steelers' senior director of communications, confirmed the news to USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday.\n\nNo cause of death was announced. The Larimer County Coroner on Wednesday announced that an autopsy was performed the same day, after Haggans was found in a private residence in Fort Collins. According to a CSU release, Haggans had returned in recent years to Fort Collins.\n\nHaggans' cause and manner of death are pending further investigation, per the coroner's office. No foul play is evident in the case.\n\nHaggans' death was first reported by Pittsburgh radio host Colin Dunlap on Tuesday night.\n\nHaggans won Super Bowl 40 with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He sacked Seattle Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck during the first drive of the game, which the Steelers won 21-10 on Feb. 5, 2006.\n\nHaggans was a college standout at Colorado State University, where he played defensive end in 1996-99. His 33 career sacks remains a school record. Haggans was inducted into the Colorado State University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nCSU athletics officials said arrangements to celebrate Haggans' life are pending and will be announced at a later date.\n\nHaggans played 13 seasons in the NFL after being drafted in the fifth round of the 2000 NFL draft by the Steelers. He also played for the Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers, reaching the Super Bowl with all three teams during his career. He retired from football in 2013.\n\nHaggans finished his NFL career with 520 total tackles, 46.5 sacks, five fumble recoveries and one interception.\n\nColoradoan editor Eric Larsen contributed to this report."
