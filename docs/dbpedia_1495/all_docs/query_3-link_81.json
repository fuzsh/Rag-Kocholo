        "text": "Its tough to judge value before the combine and workouts, but heres where i am as far as value and likely picks.\n\nnot all picks in concrete decided yet, coin flips and playoffs are still pending\n\nSt Louis- Jimmy Clausen\n\nThey need a face of the franchise, I love clausen as a pro but he doesn’t deserve to go over Suh and Berry.\n\nDetroit- Ndamukong Suh\n\nInstant difference maker, he and Sammie Lee Hill will be a top interior Dline for years.\n\nTampa- Eric Berry\n\nTampa has always been about defense, they could use Dline but Gerald Mccoy would be a reach here and Berry is an Elite talent. Barber is old, Talib is a nice CB and Berry/Talib would be nice in the secondary.\n\nWashington- Gerald Mccoy\n\nPlaying next to haynesworth would be the IDEAL situation for mccoy who is no where near suhs level in any way\n\nKansas City- Russell Okung\n\nClichÃ© Pick but it makes sense…they passed on some LTs last year for Tyson Jackson, the need to pair him up with branden albert and they will have some studs keeping cassel upright\n\nSeattle - Anthony Daivs\n\nThey need a Qb but Bradford has no value here. They draft Anthony Davis because Walter Jones is old and dying. Pete got the job but I don’t think hes gonna have much power right away, especially not enough to grab his boy mays.\n\nCleveland- Dez Bryant\n\nTrading away Edwards and leaving them with a bunch of scrubs at WR, they need a playmaker and I think Bryant will be valued here.\n\nOakland- Taylor Mays\n\nI know how Al davis is, everyone does, but I still cant even believe the heyward-bey pick….just unreal. Mays will give Davis all he dreams about.\n\nBuffalo- Arrelious Benn\n\nI honestly have no clue where benn is going to be selected, i think workouts could push him into a spot around here. I hate projecting the bills pick more than i do the raiders or patriots\n\nJacksonville- Tim Tebow\n\nYeah yeah yeah….not worth it, we all know. The jags want to sell tickets and if derrick Harvey and reggie nelson are any idication…they love local heroes. I think this pick is a lock, especially because I don’t think teams will let him slip out of the first round so this is their chance at their boy.\n\nDenver- Rolando Mcclain\n\nHe SHOULD be a jag, but they are idiots and the broncos get a stud LB. Hes perfect for the middle as the still make the transition to a 34\n\nMiami- Terrence Cody\n\nThey have some great young talent on the dline. Langford, merling, cody….awesome line, perfect 34 line.\n\nSan Francisco- Trent Williams\n\nThey Love that hes here, he can play RT for them right away.\n\nSeattle- Sam Bradford\n\nNot crazy about him, but he can play in the seahawks west coast offense. The seahawks have now found their answer to alex smith (lol)\n\nNew York Giants- Brandon Spikes\n\nPierce-old, danny clark-old, sintim-stud….spikes can play middle and strong.\n\nTennessee- Dan Williams\n\nAs they search for haynesworths replacement they find themselves with dan Williams who can be a disruptor in the middle of a 43 line.\n\nSan Francisco – Joe Haden\n\nThey love to see him here, someone to team up with Nate Clements and give them 2 great corners to match teams like AZ and their passing attack\n\nPittsburgh- Earl Thomas\n\nClark is likely done, even if hes not, hes a liability in ocverage anyway. Earl Thomas and Polamalu could be legendary. Not the elite prospect berry is, but as close as you can get. Bulaga would make sense but the steelers in in offensive line denial.\n\nAtlanta- Jason Pierre-Paul\n\nPerfect for them to put opposite Abraham. Abraham, jerry, bump Anderson to DT and JPP on the end they have a dline that will be a handful.\n\nHouston- CJ Spiller\n\nThe run game suffered when slaton went down. Hes a part time back anyway and brown, moats and the other guy are nothing more than backups. Spiller will dominate in the zone blocking scheme they run.\n\nCincinnati- Golden Tate\n\nVertical threat at WR for them which was a problem for them last year, he’ll be able to play right away.\n\nNew England- Colt Mccoy\n\nIm sayin this pick happens, he sits behind brady for a year and brady walks. Its just my pick, you don’t have to agree with it….i think dunlap is a possibility here as well, but we have to wait on the Julius peppers rumors.\n\nGreen Bay- Bryan Bulaga\n\nRodgers got sacked A LOT, and the packers love white guys. Hes a legit LT prospect\n\nPhiladelphia- Mike Iupati\n\nThe shawn Andrews era has ended, hes the best guard prospect since….well, shawn andrews\n\nBaltimore- Jermaine Greshem\n\nHeap is old, they want to get flacco some more weapons. Greshem is a terrific pass catching TE.\n\nArizona- Sergio Kindle\n\nClark Haggans is old and they cant just keep franchising dansby every year\n\nNew York Jets - Damien Williams\n\nLegit first round talent, Edwards is probably on his way out. Sanchez played with Williams at USC…it makes sense\n\nDallas- Corey Wootton\n\nNot your typical 34 end, but an intriguing player with all the tools to be moved around on the line\n\nMinnesota- Carlos Dunlap\n\nThey weren’t scared away from percy harvin….this gives them a legit end opposite Allen.\n\nSan Diego- Bruce Campbell\n\nHe didn’t have a great year but hes an incredibly gifted athlete and with some coaching could be a difference maker in both the run and pass game\n\nIndianapolis- Sean Witherspoon.\n\nLinebacker is definitely the biggest weakness, especially on the weak side, witherspoon is perfect for that spot and will be a tackling machine\n\nNew Orleans- Jonathan Dwyer\n\nThey are pissed the colts took witherspoon, rumor is the coveted beanie wells last year and dwyer will give them a tough, inside, physical runner that they want. Bush is likely gone so depth is a concern"
