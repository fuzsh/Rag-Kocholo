        "text": "Any attempt at identifying the best draft pick in an NFL team's history is going to come with some qualifiers.\n\nThis one is no different.\n\nA couple of assumptions need to be made.\n\nFirst, the player must have unexpected value, since that's generally accepted as the best way to measure a pick's overall success.\n\nThis alone probably eliminates the majority of first- and second-round picks.\n\nAlso, the player must have played most, if not all, of his career with the franchise that drafted him.\n\nIt's tough to be the best pick in a team's history when you spend a chunk of your career with another team.\n\nSo let's give this a shot with the Bills, Browns and Steelers.\n\nIt'll be fun.\n\n- Bills: Players such as tackle Howard Ballard and quarterback Daryle Lamonica make compelling cases because they were late-round picks who enjoyed long, productive careers.\n\nThe problem is both made roughly half of more of their career starts with other teams, and thus must be disqualified.\n\nThat leaves defensive tackle Kyle Williams, a 2006 fifth-round pick out of LSU who has been a rock in the middle of Buffalo's defense and a four-time Pro Bowl selection, and wide receiver Andre Reed.\n\nAlthough he was a fourth-round pick, 86th overall, out of Division II Kutztown in the 1985 draft, Reed far surpassed Bills' scouts most optimistic expectations.\n\nHe played 15 of his 16 NFL seasons in Buffalo, was a linchpin on four straight AFC championship teams and retired among the league's top 10 all-time in receptions (951) and receiving yards (13,198) and 11th in receiving TDs (87). Not only did he end up in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Kutztown re-named its football stadium in his honor.\n\nReed gave a shout-out to his alma mater during his HOF induction speech, saying, \"Nobody knows where that is, but they do now.\"\n\n- Browns: Not surprisingly, there aren't many recent contenders given the Browns' mostly awful draft history since returning to the league in 1999. But historically the franchise has unearthed some gems, including linebacker Andra Davis in the fifth round in 2002, wide receiver Michael Jackson in the sixth round in 1991, defensive end Rob Burnett in the fifth round in 1990 and tackle Doug Dieken in the sixth round in 1971.\n\nThe two that stand out, though, are running back Earnest Byner and quarterback Brian Sipe, who represent the Browns' last two stretches of semi-sustained success. Sipe arrived in the 13th round, 330th overall, out of San Diego State in 1972. He went on to become the leader of the 1980 \"Kardiac Kids\" team that snapped the franchise's eight-year playoff drought. He was a Pro Bowl and All-Pro selection and threw for 23,713 yards and 154 touchdowns in 125 career games. One year after Sipe bolted for the USFL, the Browns selected Byner out of East Carolina with the 280th overall pick in the 10th round of the 1984 draft. Byner posted a combined 12,866 rushing and receiving yards and 71 touchdowns over a 14-year NFL career, but a big chunk of that production came during five seasons with the Redskins. That's enough to swing the pick to Sipe.\n\n- Steelers: You can make logical arguments for players like defensive end L.C. Greenwood, a 10th-round pick in 1969, tackle John Jackson, a 10th-rounder in 1998, and wide receiver Antonio Brown, who has four Pro Bowl selections and two All-Pro honors in six seasons since the Steelers chose him in the sixth round of the 2010 draft. Linebacker Clark Haggans, who amassed 461/2 career sacks after arriving as a fifth-rouund pick out of Colorado State in 2000, and nose tackle Gary Dunn, an eight-year starter who was a sixth-round pick out of Miami (Fla.) during the heart of the Chuck Noll Super Bowl years in 1976, also deserve consideration.\n\nActually, though, this is a fairly easy pick. After taking him in the fifth round, 125th overall, out of Wisconsin in the 1974 draft, the Steelers installed center Mike Webster in the middle of their offensive line two years later and he spent the next 14 seasons becoming arguably the best player ever to play the position. Webster made 245 career starts, was a nine-time Pro Bowler and five-time All Pro and 1997 Hall of of Fame inductee.\n\nAs for all-time top picks, it's tough to argue with two quarterbacks, one old, one older. Tom Brady represents one of the crowning achievements of NFL scouting as a sixth-round selection in 2000, while Joe Montana going 82nd overall to the 49ers in 1979 turned out to be a late third-round steal. Then again, arguments are never in short supply when it comes to the draft.\n\njohn.dudley@timesnews.com"
