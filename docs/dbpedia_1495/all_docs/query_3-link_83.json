        "text": "Time for todays links, with an update on two players who are waiting to be resigned at the moment.\n\nArizona Cardinals News:\n\nCan't Just Cover\n\nCardinals cornerbacks have to be willing to hit, tackle\n\nClark Haggans, Vonnie Holliday in waiting game with Arizona Cardinals\n\nThe Cardinals could use depth at outside linebacker and defensive end, and General Manager Rod Graves has acknowledged the club is interested in re-signing linebacker Clark Haggans and defensive end Vonnie Holliday. But the Cardinals aren't in any hurry to do so. The agents for those players said this week that nothing is happening and that their clients are both waiting it out. I would expect both to return some time in the next month, however.\n\nWord From the Birds Blog | Cap space and Campbell\n\nNo, nothing new is brewing on the Calais Campbell contract front. Right now, the franchise-tagged defensive end remains unsigned and isn’t around. To refresh the details, the tag means he will be a Card in 2012 for sure, but until he signs, he’s under no obligation to come to anything. (Technically, the Cards could also pull the tag at any point before it’s signed, but that would never happen.) The Cards, by last report out there in cyberspace, had about $2.5 million of cap space. There has been a lot of speculation that a new long-term deal for Campbell would create more, and that’s true. How much, though, is the question.\n\nFeely, Cardinals take bus trip to Coyotes game - ArizonaSports.com\n\nArizona Cardinals kicker Jay Feely is offering his support to the Phoenix Coyotes, along with a large contingent of the Birdgang. Feely tweeted a picture of the Cardinals group before embarking on a bus trip to Glendale for the Coyotes series-clinching win against Nashville.\n\nWhether Cardinals took right tack in draft - NFC West Blog - ESPN\n\nJustin from Phoenix thinks the Arizona Cardinals can't win with critics. \"The Cardinals have caught grief over the last few years for not drafting offensive lineman, so this year they go out and draft three,\" he writes. \"Now, they are catching grief for not addressing the outside linebacker position. Why can't this team ever do anything right?\"\n\nWhich draft pick will make biggest impact - NFC West Blog - ESPN\n\nArizona Cardinals receiver Michael Floyd was fifth and Seattle Seahawks pass-rusher Bruce Irvin sixth on John Clayton's list of 10 new draft choices likely to make the greatest immediate impact. \"Floyd's presence may force defenses into more zone coverages, because it will be hard to double Larry Fitzgerald and match up man-to-man against Floyd,\" Clayton theorized. \"Irvin is probably the draft's best pass-rusher and should put up double-digit sack numbers early in his career.\"\n\nWhat's up with former Arizona Cardinals player Matt Ware\n\nWe caught up with the former Arizona Cardinals safety.\n\nArizona Sports News:\n\nIan Kennedy, Arizona Diamondbacks fall to St. Louis Cardinals\n\nCarlos Beltran homered in his first two at-bats, including a grand slam, matching his career high with six RBIs, and the St. Louis Cardinals beat Arizona 6-1 on Tuesday night, handing the Diamondbacks their fourth loss in a row.\n\nNFL News:\n\nCris Carter admits to using bounties during his career | ProFootballTalk\n\nOn Monday, former NFL receiver Cris Carter provided great insight regarding the concussion issue during ESPN’s Outside the Lines. On Tuesday, Carter chimed in on the other big issue in the NFL.\n\nBrian Xanders, Denver Broncos Agree To Part Ways - SBNation.com\n\nBrian Xanders, GM of the Broncos since 2009, has decided to leave the Broncos organization.\n\nVikings Stadium Bill: Minnesota Senate Amendment Would Increase Team's Share By $25 Million - SBNation.com\n\nThe Minnesota Senate passed an amendment to the Vikings stadium bill that would reduce the state's financial contribution by $25 million, according to Tom Hauser of Twin Cities television station KSTP. That change would lower the amount that the state would put toward the stadium project from $398 million in the original plan to $373 million."
