        "text": "Heading into the draft, we will give the recent history at each of the Vikings' seven draft slots.\n\nThe Vikings have the first pick in the fifth round, acquiring the 137th overall selection from the Bills via Tampa Bay in a trade that shipped quarterback Matt Cassel to Buffalo. There's a good cornerback that was recently drafted at this spot, and there's one quarterback Vikings fans will remember fairly well for all the wrong reasons\n\nThe good… Skrine just inked a five-year deal with the Jets this offseason. He was a solid cornerback that lined up on the opposite side of Joe Hayden during his tenure with the Browns. See, Vikings fans, you can a good No. 2 cornerback in Day 3 of the draft.\n\nThe bad… And you can also find a bad linebacker. Nande never panned out for the Titans. He was cut after a season and only made one appearance in the NFL.\n\nThe ugly… And, of course, there's Booty. He famously said he wanted to play for the Vikings before the draft. He was eventually cut after a season because some guy named Brett Favre joined the team. Something about a news chopper and a private jet, I think?\n\nHaving the Vikings ever picked 137th? Outside of Booty, the Vikings haven't had another selection with the 137th pick. It's probably safe to say they won't use a quarterback with the pick this year, regardless of how badly the prospect wants to be a Viking.\n\nBest 137th pick in NFL history? Historically, there isn't a high bar. The Steelers drafted linebacker Clark Haggans in 2000, and he went on to have a decent career. He made 104 starts in his 13-year career. Haggans finished with 355 tackles and 46.5 career sacks."
