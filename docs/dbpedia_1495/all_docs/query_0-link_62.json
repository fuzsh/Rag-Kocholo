The list of names is just remarkable. Jack Lambert, Joe Greene, Jack Ham, Rod Woodson, James Harrison or Troy Polamalu.\n\nsee also\n\nMike Tomlin goes viral after emotional speech to Steelers players\n\nNow, in heartbreaking news, the Pittsburgh Steelers have lost a beloved player at a very young age.
