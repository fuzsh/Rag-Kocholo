        "text": "Joseph BrunoCorrespondent I\n\nBest Late-Round Draft Picks for the Steelers Since 2000\n\n0 of 9\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers have long been known as one of the best drafting teams in the NFL, almost always hitting on their first-round picks and routinely finding late round gems.\n\nThis list spans from 2000 to present and encompasses only players selected from the fifth to the seventh rounds of the draft.\n\nThis article about the team's diamond-in-the-rough draft picks, so great undrafted players the Steelers have acquired will not be found in these slides.\n\n2000\n\n1 of 9\n\n5th round – LB Clark Haggans\n\nClark Haggans may not have be one of the most heralded Steelers 'backers in the 21st century, but he certainly represents some of the best value the Steelers found in their linebacking corps.\n\nAfter being drafted, Haggans was didn’t become a major contributor until the team parted ways with Jason Gildon after the 2003 season.\n\nHaggans helped the Steelers to a Super Bowl victory XL over the Seattle Seahawks and accumulated 32.5 sacks with the team before leaving in 2007.\n\n2002\n\n2 of 9\n\n7th round – DE Brett Keisel\n\nBrett Keisel has become the poster child for late round picks, since the Steelers selected the defensive end in the seventh round of the 2002 draft.\n\nKeisel became a full time starter when Kimo Von Oelhoffen left in free agency after the 2005 season and hasn’t relinquished that spot yet.\n\nAlthough Keisel could be in his last year with the team, he has been the perfect 3-4 defensive end for the Steelers for his career.\n\n2002\n\n3 of 9\n\nVerron Haynes is probably the most unheralded name on my list because he was never a major contributor, but he was a nice complementary player for the Steelers.\n\nHaynes wasn’t a feature back for the Steelers. However, for several seasons, he was the quintessential third-down back, spelling Jerome Bettis and Amos Zereoue.\n\nAs a runner, blocker and receiver, there wasn't much else the Steelers could have wanted from a fifth-round pick role player, especially considering the depth at the position the team already had on the roster.\n\n2005\n\n4 of 9\n\n6th round - G Chris Kemoeatu\n\nI was one one of many who were concerned when Alan Faneca was let go after the 2007 season and the Steelers decided to go with Chris Kemoeatu as the starter.\n\nKemoeatu then ensued to start for the Steelers, until he was released in the 2012 offseason in favor of Willie Colon.\n\nAlthough fans got a little tired of Kemoeatu towards the end of his career, you can’t really ask for more than getting a four-year starter out of a sixth-round pick.\n\n2007\n\n5 of 9\n\n5th round – CB William Gay\n\nI was a big fan of William Gay when the Steelers drafted him in the fifth round of the 2007 draft, although I did not think he was ready to start in 2009.\n\nIn my opinion, Gay was more of a slot corner and he struggled when becoming the full-time starter after the team let Bryant McFadden go in free agency.\n\nAlthough I was pretty happy to see Gay go in the 2012 offseason, he made major contributions with 43 passes defensed in his five years in Pittsburgh. Overall, he was a nice pickup in the fifth round.\n\n2008\n\n6 of 9\n\n6th round – S Ryan Mundy\n\nRyan Mundy, like William Gay, has soured a bit in the latter part of his career with the Steelers and he could be allowed to walk as a free agent.\n\nFor most of Mundy’s career, however, I thought he was a very solid backup safety and a guy who could step in for an injured Ryan Clark or Troy Polamalu.\n\nEven though I believe Mundy’s time in Pittsburgh is over now, any significant contributions from a sixth-round pick are a pleasant surprise.\n\n2009\n\n7 of 9\n\n7th round – TE David Johnson\n\nDavid Johnson was in a competition with current FB Will Johnson for a roster spot last training camp and, unfortunately for David, he blew out his knee.\n\nNow Will Johnson has a firm hold on that position and the only way I can see David coming back to the team is to compete for a backup TE spot with Leonard Pope and David Paulson, while Miller is recovering from his late-season injury.\n\nIn his career with the Steelers, David never really lived up to the potential we all thought he had in the passing game. However, he was an effective blocker and a nice find as a backup TE/H-back in the seventh round.\n\n2010\n\n8 of 9\n\n6th round – WR Antonio Brown\n\nAlthough the Steelers are probably going to lose Mike Wallace to free agency this offseason, Antonio Brown's production is probably the deciding factor in the Steelers' relative confidence in parting ways with the speedster.\n\nBrown became the first player in NFL history to record 1000 receiving and return yards in the same season in only his second year and the team gave him a five-year contract extension.\n\nLike many Steelers in 2012, Brown had a somewhat disappointing year. However, he has a bright future and was a great pick by the team.\n\nTime Will Tell\n\n9 of 9\n\nX"
