        "text": "As the Pittsburgh Steelers prepare to enter NFL Draft week, we could always discuss mock drafts, possible selections in 2023 or the usual draft hype stories. Let's talk about the past, not the present, and dive into the best Steelers late-round selections in the past 30 years. The Steelers have found many key players in the final rounds, leading to six Super Bowl Titles for the franchise.\n\nSince this is specifically focusing late rounds, we'll take out the first three and only take a look at rounds four through seven. The Steelers currently only have three of these selections in 2023, a fourth and two in the seventh. That doesn't mean the team can't or won't acquire some before the draft ends, however.\n\nSince 1993, the Steelers have selected 76 defensive players and 70 offensive players along with seven special teams selections in that timeframe. This does not include undrafted free agents. Tom Donahoe, Kevin Colbert were the General Managers and now Omar Khan takes over draft duties in 2023.\n\nFourth Round\n\nIn the fourth round, the Steelers have had some solid selections, primarily on the defensive side of the ball. Ike Taylor was taken with the 125th overall pick back in 2003. Taylor was picked three rounds after Troy Polamalu was selected with the 16th overall pick. You already know how those two worked out for the Steelers.\n\nOne year prior, in 2002, Pittsburgh drafted a linebacker in Larry Foote with the 128th pick. Foote had a breakout season in 2005, recording 102 tackles and picked off Jake Plummer in the 2005 AFC Championship game against the Denver Broncos. Some of the current offensive linemen on the roster, Kevin Dotson and Dan Moore Jr. were are also fourth-round picks.\n\nFifth Round\n\nThere aren't a huge number of selections in the fifth round to consider from the last three decades for the Steelers. The obvious choice would have to be Clark Haggans, the former starting outside linebacker for the black and gold, who was drafted out of Colorado State and recorded six sacks in 2004, before having his career-best nine sacks in 2005.\n\nHaggans collected 18 combined tackles, two tackles for loss, and one and a half sacks in that magical Super Bowl run during the 2005-2006 season. In recent years, Zach Gentry was selected out of Michigan with the 141st pick in 2019 and Isaiahh Loudermilk was the last fifth-round selection for Pittsburgh in 2021. Unless the team makes a trade from now until Thursday, he will keep that title for at least another year.\n\nSixth Round\n\nThe Steelers selected arguably their greatest singular weapon in the team's history during the sixth round of 2010. Jonathan Dwyer was great as a running back, but that's not who we are talking about here. Antonio Brown got the call from the Steelers with the 195th pick, catching 837 balls in 130 games for Pittsburgh. Brown racked up over 11,000 yards receiving and caught 74 touchdowns in his nine seasons.\n\nHis peak from 2013 to 2018 was nothing short of spectacular. In fact, his 2014 and 2015 seasons might be the greatest back-to-back seasons for a receiver in AFC history. Don't forget about Vince Williams being picked 206th in 2013 either. Williams provided a massive spark for the Steelers defense in 2017 with his eight sacks.\n\nSeventh Round\n\nThe final round has provided Hall of Fame talent to the NFL. Another reason why the sport is so beloved is that you truly never know who can turn into a franchise cornerstone. Shannon Sharpe, Bo Jackson and Donald Driver were all selected in the seventh round. Now, the draft had more rounds back then, but imagine getting arguably the one of the top five tight ends in league history with the 192nd overall pick.\n\nBrett Keisel embodied what it meant to be a Steeler and is the best seventh rounder in the organization's storied history. As tough and fearless as Keisel was, he wasn't selected until the 242nd pick in the 2002 draft. These picks matter. Pittsburgh wouldn't have six Lombardi trophies without some of these guys.\n\nCould The Steelers Pull Out Another Big Time Late-Round Pick In 2023?\n\nThe draft is looming closer than ever. Pittsburgh will only have two selections in the later rounds of the 2023 Draft. This makes it even more important to hit on at least one of the picks."
