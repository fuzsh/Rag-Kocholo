        "text": "Looks like AdamJT13 had good predictions -- only big miss was Pittsburgh getting a 5th not a 3d (which still doesn't make sense IMHO)\n\nFrom AdamJT13 at KFFL:\n\nI got 26 correct, with almost all of them coming in the order I projected. I was off by one round on three more, all of which I said were possible. I barely missed my goal of 30 correct or within one round, but I had more picks correct and fewer off by one round than I expected, so I'm fairly pleased.\n\nI missed two seventh-rounders, with the NFL awarding picks to Jacksonville and Cincinnati (both of which I said would happen if Aaron Glenn and Alex Stepanovich qualified, and they did qualify). Seattle didn't get one of the seventh-rounders I projected because Keary Colbert wound up qualifying (I explained his situation in my original post). Detroit didn't end up getting a net-value pick as I projected, so I'll have to re-examine the players involved there. It was a close call anyway, so it's not a big surprise.\n\nThe one surprise that I can't explain is the Steelers getting only a fifth-round pick after losing two players (Alan Faneca and Clark Haggans) and signing one (Mewelde Moore). Haggans and Moore had seventh-round values and should have canceled out each other. Faneca played 99 percent of the snaps for the Jets, made the Pro Bowl and got a huge contract ($7.8 million per season, plus a little more that doesn't count in the equation). He clearly had a third-round value, so I'm curious about why the Steelers got a fifth. Hopefully the media in Pittsburgh will look into it and get an answer.\n\nFrom PFT:\n\nRules Capped Steelers’ Compensatory Pick At A Fifth-Rounder\n\nPosted by Mike Florio on March 31, 2009, 8:01 p.m.\n\nAnd there’s further proof that free agency is a game intended for men in their 20s.\n\nSeveral readers have expressed consternation regarding the fact that the Steelers received only a fifth-round pick as compensation for the departure in 2008 of Pro Bowl guard Alan Faneca.\n\nWe’ve seen in the comments assertions that the rules cap the compensatory pick at that level when the departing free agent older than 30.\n\nPer John Clayton of ESPN.com, that’s precisely the case.\n\nResponding to a reader in a Q&amp;A column, Clayton wrote the following: “[T]he Steelers asked the same question at the owners’ meeting. What they found out is that a departing free agent older than 30 can’t net anything better than a fifth-round choice. They were banking on a third, too. They received the max value. They simply didn’t know the rule that has been there for a few years in the compensatory formula.”\n\nThough it’s unknown whether the Steelers would have opted to use the franchise tag on Faneca if they’d known that they’d only get a fifth-round selection this year for letting him walk, it seems unfair that the league would use age-based restrictions on such matters.\n\nIf as in Faneca’s case the player is regarded by another team as sufficiently valuable to result in a five-year, $40 million deal, the fact that the player is on the wrong side of 30 shouldn’t matter.\n\nMeanwhile, we’ll wait for the folks who are convinced that the league office is in the tank for the Rooneys to explain that the Steelers got the shaft this time in order to throw the dogs off the scent.\n\nIt's bizarre that the max comp pick for someone over 30 is a 5th round pick."
