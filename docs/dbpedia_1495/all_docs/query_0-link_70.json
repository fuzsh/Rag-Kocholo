        "text": "According to multiple reports, including from Pittsburgh radio personality Colin Dunlap, former Pittsburgh Steelers outside linebacker Clark Haggans has died. He was 46 years old.\n\nHaggans was a fifth-round pick of the Steelers in 2000, former general manager Kevin Colbert’s first draft class. He played his college ball at Colorado State.\n\nHaggans was in the NFL for 14 seasons, including eight in Pittsburgh. During his time with the Steelers, Haggans started 61 games and finished with 32.5 sacks. His best season came in 2005, when he got 9.0 sacks in 13 starts. In Super Bowl XL that season, Haggans had a sack and five tackles in the Steelers’ 21-10 win over the Seattle Seahawks."
