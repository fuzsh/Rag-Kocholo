        "text": "Round 3, Pick # 72\n\nKendrick Clancy, DT Mississippi\n\nClancy spent five seasons in Pittsburgh, but only started four games (played in 44) totaling just 22 tackles and zero sacks. To his credit though Clancy has managed to bounce around to three different teams the past three years and has started 28 games over that time while playing in 41 total. Clancy might have had a better future in Steel Town if Casey Hampton hadn't been drafted in 2001. Then again, had Clancy shown more promise or if the Steelers believed in his ability more, they probably wouldn't have used their first round pick on Big Snack the following year. Clancy can thank Hampton for giving him a second chance though because Kendrick was actually cut prior to the 2004 season and was resigned off the street after Hampton tore his ACL eight games into the season. Grade: C+\n\nStill available: Darrell Jackson (WR),\n\nRound 4, Pick # 77\n\nHank Poteat, CB Pittsburgh\n\nPoteat, a Philadelphia native who played his ball in Pittsburgh, spent the first three years of his 8-year career with Pittsburgh. Though he played some DB here, he mainly earned his paycheck as a punt and kick returner. As a kick returner, he was only decent, averaging 19.4, 15.6 and 20.6 yards per return in his first three years. He was fairly solid as a punt returner though, especially during his rookie season, when he took one the distance and finished the year with a healthy 13 yards per return average. Compare that with Rossum's 6.4 yards per return in '07 and you can understand why we thought we maybe had something in Poteat. Poteat's contributions on special teams weren't enough to keep him around though. Since 2002, he has joined three other teams in the past five years, most recently for the Jets in '07.\n\nDuring that time he's played in 81 games, starting 17, and totaling 122 tackles and 2 interceptions. Poteat was cut by the Steelers before the 2003 season but was signed by the Buccaneers. He played in just one game during that season before getting cut halfway through. It appeared he might be out of football until he was signed by the Patriots right before the 2004 season's playoffs. He would play in each of their playoff games and ended with a championship ring and 3 tackles. Poteat stayed on with New England until he was cut midway through the 2006 season and was signed by the Jets just one day later. 2007 was actually Poteat's best season as a pro when he started 9 games and totaled 37 tackles, while recording his first two interceptions. Grade: B-\n\nStill available: Laveranues Coles (WR), Reuben Droughns (RB)\n\nRound 4, Pick #103\n\nDanny Farmer, WR UCLA\n\nFarmer not only didn't play a game in the Black and Gold, he never even broke camp with the team. He was among the final cuts in training camp in 2000 and was picked up by the Bengals before the Steelers could sign him to the practice squad. Farmer played three seasons in Cincy and ended his career with just 4 starts (33 games total) totaling 43 receptions for 611 yards and one touchdown. Grade: D\n\nStill available: Tyrone Carter (S)\n\nRound 5, Pick # 137\n\nClark Haggans, LB Colorado State\n\nThe Colorado State product started 61 games over his eight year career with the Steelers and has been the primary starter for the past four seasons. Haggans didn't have his best year in 2007 but his contributions the past eight seasons shouldn't be overlooked. He's had four seasons with at least six sacks and three seasons with at least 50 tackles. He also started and recorded a sack in the Super Bowl. Not bad for a fifth round pick.Haggans was good enough to contribute when he was younger and had more lively legs, but now that he's on the downhill part of his career, he doesn't have the size, speed or strength to really be a force in a defense that aims to be atop the league standings each year. Hence Pittsburgh's decision to let him get away to Arizona, where he played an integral role as a reserve LB for Arizona's run to the Super Bowl. Grade: B\n\nStill available: Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila (DT), Dante Hall (KR), Sammy Morris (RB)\n\nRound 5, Pick #163\n\nTee Martin, QB Tennessee\n\nAfter the Kordell Stewart soap-opera, it's somewhat odd that the Steelers felt compelled to roll the dice on another slightly undersized QB who made his mark in college running the option. Martin's career stats include 3 games (1 with Pitt, 2 with Oakland) with 6 completions on 16 attempts for 69 yards. He threw one interception and zero touchdowns and also added 36 yards on 6 attempts. Martin lasted just two seasons with the Steelers (1 game, 1 rushing attempt) and he got one other chance in Oakland during the 2003 season when he played in two games. He also played one season in NFL Europe and one season in the Canadian football league. Martin continues to be involved in football though as he owns Playmakers Sports, an organization devoted to combine training, as well as QB and skill position development camps. It's nice to see that even though his NFL career wasn't successful, he is still successful in life. Grade: D\n\nStill available: Marc Bulger (QB), Neil Rackers (K)\n\nRound 6, Pick #173\n\nChris Combs, DE Duke\n\nCombs hung on in the NFL for just three seasons, playing in 10 games and totaling one tackle. He was cut by the Steelers before the 2002 season when he was beat out by seventh round pick, Brett Keisel. He was signed by Jacksonville for the 2003 season but played in just two games and didn't register a tackle. Note to the Steelers' front office: we trust the decisions you make, but try to avoid any and all football players that come out of Duke. Cool? Grade: D-\n\nStill available: Tom Brady (QB), Adalius Thomas (LB), Dhani Jones (LB)\n\nRound 6, Pick # 204\n\nJason Gavadza, TE Ken State\n\nGavadza never broke camp with the Steelers and bounced around several NFL teams including St. Louis, Carolina and Baltimore (on their practice squad their SB year). He played one season in NFL Europe and as recently as 2005 was playing in the CFL for the BC Lions. Grade: D-\n\nStill available: Adewale Ogunleye (DE), Brian Waters (G)\n\n********"
