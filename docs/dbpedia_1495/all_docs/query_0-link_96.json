        "text": "Former Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Clark Haggans has passed away at the age of 46, according to local reports.\n\nThe news was first announced on Tuesday night by Colin Dunlap of Pittsburgh's sports radio station 93.7 The Fan. On Wednesday, a spokesperson for the team confirmed Haggans' death with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.\n\nThe cause of his death remains unclear.\n\nHaggans spent eight seasons with the Steelers after being selected as a fifth-round draft pick out of Colorado State in 2000.\n\nHe was part of the championship team that defeated the Seattle Seahawks in the 2006 Super Bowl and had 18 tackles in the playoffs that season, including five in Super Bowl XL.\n\nThe California native also went on to play for the Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers before retiring in 2013.\n\nHe is survived by his son Damon and daughter Alianna.\n\nTributes started pouring in for Haggans on Wednesday, with many taking to social media to express their condolences.\n\nNFL analyst Mike Kennedy tweeted: \"So sad. RIP to Clark Haggans. Perhaps the most underrated piece of those elite Steelers defenses.\"\n\nAlex Kozora of Steelersdepot.com said: \"Clark Haggans' life was obviously so much more than one Super Bowl or the game of football. But he was a key piece to some great Steelers' defenses.\"\n\nOne fan also called Haggans \"one of the unsung heroes of the Super Bowl 40 team\" and another said: \"Clark was loved and will be dearly missed by all those who knew him. He was much, much more than a football player. He was a devoted dad to his two kids and loved them beyond measure. We're all still in shock.\""
