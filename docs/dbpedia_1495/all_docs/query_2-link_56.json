        "text": "PHOENIX -- 93.7 The Fan's Colin Dunlap has reported former Pittsburgh Steelers and Arizona Cardinals linebacker Clark Haggans has died at the age of 46.\n\nPittsburgh Sports Now's Alan Saunders says a cause of death is currently unknown, though he does leave behind a son, Damon and a daughter, Alianna.\n\nHaggans played his college ball at Colorado State University - and according to his Wiki page, he holds the CSU all-time sack record with 33 career sacks. He was inducted into the Colorado State University Athletics Hall of Fame just a few years after retiring from football.\n\nHaggans spent the first eight years of his career with the Steelers after being selected in the fifth-round of the 2000 NFL Draft. In Pittsburgh, Haggans won Super Bowl XL with Pittsburgh after contributing nine sacks that season.\n\nIn 2008, he signed with the Cardinals and played four seasons in the desert, starting 43 games while amassing 186 tackles and 14 total sacks. He was placed on injured reserve late in the year before Arizona ultimately fell to Pittsburgh in Super Bowl XLIII to finish the season.\n\nIn 2012, Haggans signed with the San Francisco 49ers - where he played nine games as a rotation player. He was part of another Super Bowl run (his third) but San Francisco fell short to the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XLVII.\n\nHaggans was also actively involved in charity work.\n\n\"In 2012, Haggans became the first NFL player to support the Black Out Child Abuse Campaign. Black Out Child Abuse, Inc. is a 501(c)3 non-profit foundation, with offices in Westerville, OH, was founded in 2012 and serves families and organizations across the country; bringing education, assistance and support to those in need. Haggans wears blackout paint as opposed to the stick on in support of this cause.\"\n\nAll Cardinals offers our condolences to the Haggans family at this time."
