        "text": "Former All-Pro linebacker Jason Gildon was released Wednesday by the Pittsburgh Steelers in a long-expected move that creates $3.65 million of salary cap room for the team.\n\nGildon, who will be 32 next month, learned weeks ago he would be traded or released. The Steelers also told him not to attend last month's minicamp or their ongoing voluntary coaching sessions, though he has worked out by himself at the team's practice complex. Gildon, the team's all-time sacks leader, was the last player remaining on the Steelers' roster from the team that lost to Dallas in the Super Bowl in January 1996.\n\nreleasing Gildon, the Steelers freed themselves of his $3.65 million salary but still must count $1.3 million of his deferred signing bonus against their 2004 cap and $2.6 million next year. They would have been required to count the entire $3.9 million this year if they had cut Gildon before now.\n\nThe 6-foot-4, 255-pound Gildon, coming off two consecutive down seasons after making All-Pro in 2001, is expected to sign shortly with another team. The Texans, Redskins, Packers, Ravens and Browns are believed to be interested in Gildon.\n\nGildon knew his 10-year Steelers career was effectively over when they signed his former backup, Clark Haggans, to a $10.2 million, four-year contract on March 6. Haggans will slide into Gildon's starting position at left outside linebacker.\n\n\"It's part of the business, and I understand that,\" Gildon said recently. \"But it's kind of disappointing because of how long I've been here.\"\n\nGildon was a third-round draft pick in 1994, played in the January 1996 Super Bowl against Dallas and became a starter in 1996, twice making the Pro Bowl. He had six sacks last season, giving him 77 in his career — 3? more than previous record-holder L.C. Greenwood. Hall of Famer Joe Greene is third with 66 sacks. Gildon has seen his sacks total decline from 13? in 2000 and 12 in 2001 to nine in 2002 and six last season.\n\nRedskins cut Trotter, Canidate, Fiore\n\nASHBURN, Va. — The Washington Redskins cut linebacker Jeremiah Trotter, running back Trung Canidate and guard Dave Fiore on Wednesday, saving the team about $4.7 million under the salary cap for 2004.\n\nNone of the cuts was unexpected. Trotter was told months ago not to attend the spring minicamps and was given permission to seek a trade. A trade for Clinton Portis in March made Canidate expendable, and Fiore's history of knee injuries put his football future in doubt. Trotter, Canidate and Fiore were high-profile acquisitions that never worked out, representing the hit-and-miss pattern of offseason player signings under owner Dan Snyder.\n\nTrotter never lived up to the seven-year, $35 million contract he received as a free agent from Philadelphia two years ago. The Redskins this offseason signed Mike Barrow from the Giants to replace Trotter at middle linebacker.\n\nEagles' Simon skips minicamp\n\nPHILADELPHIA — Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Corey Simon, entering the last year of his contract, will not attend the team's voluntary minicamp, Coach Andy Reid said Wednesday.\n\nSimon, the Eagles' first-round pick in 2000, is earning a base salary of $535,000 this season. Eugene Parker, Simon's agent, did not return a telephone message left Wednesday by The Associated Press.\n\nSimon, who has 26.5 career sacks, earned his first career trip to the Pro Bowl last season after leading the Eagles with 7.5 sacks.\n\nReid, who spoke with Simon directly, declined Wednesday to discuss their conversation.\n\n\"I'm going to handle it like I have the other situations,\" Reid said. \"If the player is not here, it just gives the other players a great opportunity to get some practice time in and play.\n\n\"But there are issues involved that he is dealing with,\" Reid added.\n\nNo player had missed a minicamp during Reid's tenure until last year, when running back Duce Staley and cornerback Bobby Taylor — both in the final years of their contracts — skipped the passing camp.\n\nStaley also held out of training camp for a month.\n\nThe Eagles, for the third straight season, eventually lost in the NFC Championship.\n\nWhile Staley, Taylor, Vincent and Emmons all signed elsewhere this off-season, the Eagles have added two top free agents in wide receiver Terrell Owens and defensive end Jevon Kearse.\n\nSimon briefly held out of training camp in 2000 while negotiating a contract, before going on to set an Eagles rookie record with 9.5 sacks.\n\nNote: Defensive tackle Paul Grasmanis, who missed nearly all of last season with a torn left Achilles tendon, has strained his right Achilles tendon and will undergo surgery. Grasmanis will be out about six weeks, but should be ready for training camp, Reid said."
