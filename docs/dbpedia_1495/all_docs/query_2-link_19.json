        "text": "Clark Haggans, a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers' Super Bowl XL championship team, has died. He was 46 years old. The Steelers confirmed his death to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, but no cause of death has been given.\n\nSelected in the fifth round out of Colorado State in the 2000 NFL Draft, Haggans joined the Steelers a year after his college teammate, future All-Pro linebacker Joey Porter. Haggans became a staple of the team's vaunted defense for much of the next decade, taking over as a starter in 2004.\n\nOver the course of eight seasons, Haggans accrued 332 combined tackles, 32.5 sacks, 31 tackles for loss, 17 passes defended, 12 forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries. He never made a Pro Bowl, but he was a reason the Steelers never ranked outside the top 10 in total defense during his tenure in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe high point came in 2006, when Haggans notched a sack of Seattle Seahawks QB Matt Hasselbeck in the opening drive of the 21-10 Super Bowl XL win."
