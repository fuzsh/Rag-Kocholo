        "text": "As general manager Kevin Colbert prepares to run his 21st draft with the Steelers, how did his first 20 turn out? And how do we judge them?\n\nYou can rate them by annual class, by cumulative effect, by championships won (two Super Bowls, three AFC titles) or simply list his best and worst picks. We decided to try our hand at the latter. Let’s call it Colbert’s 20 for 20, the Steelers’ 20 top draft picks over his 20 drafts. On Friday, we’ll examine the bottom 20.\n\nKeep in mind that we are judging Colbert’s best draft choices, which does not necessarily mean the best players he drafted, although many of those coincide. The rankings are based — subjectively by one person, me — on how good the decision was to draft those players, looking back on their careers of course. It also may or may not have been the best decision at the time of the draft, and luck often plays a part in that, but that’s not among the criteria here.\n\nThe higher the pick, the more the weight put on it because while it’s easy to say one of the greatest draft picks of all time was Tom Brady in the sixth round, the Patriots also passed on a chance to draft him before that — as did every other NFL team.\n\nColbert and the Steelers — with Bill Cowher and Mike Tomlin having great say in the selection process — were somewhat hamstrung in the drafts compared to many teams because they were so successful for much of the 21st century it left them with lower picks in each round.\n\nHere then, is how we rate Colbert’s Top 20 (21 with a tie):\n\n20. (tie) OT/G Willie Colon (4, 2006) and OT Kelvin Beachum (7, 2012)\n\nBoth became starting tackles with the Steelers for short periods and both wound up with the Jets. Colon started all 16 games for three seasons until an arm injury in the 2011 opener ended that season. He became a starting guard in 2012, then signed as a free agent guard with the Jets in 2013, where his career ended after the 2015 season. Beachum started five games at right tackle as a rookie, then moved to become their starting left tackle in 2013. A torn ACL during the 2015 season ended his Steelers career. He played one year in Jacksonville and has been the Jets’ starter for the past three seasons.\n\n19. CB William Gay (5, 2007)\n\nGay played 10 years with the Steelers and one in the middle of his career with Arizona, who signed him as a free agent in 2012 and cut him afterward. He carries the reputation as a good, nickel slot cornerback but Gay started 102 of the 176 games he played in the NFL and never missed a game, playing in all 16 in every season. He returned five of his 13 career interceptions for touchdowns.\n\n18. WR Mike Wallace (3, 2009)\n\nMike Tomlin often referred to him as a one-trick pony, but that was some trick as their speedy deep man. In his four seasons with the Steelers, Wallace caught 235 passes and averaged 17.2 yards per catch. He led the league with a 19.4-yard average as a rookie, then averaged 21 yards his second season. He played only four seasons with the Steelers before he signed as a free agent with Miami in 2013. He would go on to play nine seasons, catch 538 passes and score 95 touchdowns.\n\n17. OLB Clark Haggans (5, 2000)\n\nHaggans was overshadowed by Joey Porter as the two outside linebackers for the Steelers but was a starter for them for four years, one of them the 2005 Super Bowl season. He played on the left or strong side, an often more difficult position than the right when it comes to sacks. He was good enough, though, that offenses could not concentrate merely on doubling Porter on the right side of the defense. He left as a free agent before the 2008 season to sign with Arizona, where he started three of his 13 seasons in the league.\n\n16. ILB Larry Foote (4, 2002)\n\nFoote never made a Pro Bowl, but he sure did make plenty of tackles during his 13-year career, 11 of them with the Steelers. He became a starting inside linebacker in his third season and did not miss a game or a start from 2004 through 2008. After playing the 2009 season in Detroit where he started, he returned to the Steelers in 2010 and started the entire 2012 season for them. He played his final year with the Cardinals, where he started 15 games in 2014.\n\n15. WR Santonio Holmes (1, 2006)\n\nSteelers traded up from No. 32 to No. 25 to draft him. He spent just four seasons with the Steelers, who traded him to the New York Jets in 2010, a year before he could become a free agent. Holmes made one of the great catches in Super Bowl history as the game’s MVP and helped the Steelers beat the Cardinals. That game-winning TD with 35 seconds left is the main reason he’s on this list.\n\n14. OT Max Starks (3, 2004)\n\nAt 6-foot-8, 345 pounds, he was one of the biggest players in the league, and he became a fixture for the Steelers at right tackle early and then at left tackle. He played nine seasons with the Steelers before bowing out with the Rams in 2013. He started in both their Super Bowl victory seasons of 2005 and 2008. They foolishly released him before training camp in 2011, then re-signed him after four games and he started the rest of the season at left tackle and all 16 games in 2012.\n\n13. DE Brett Keisel (7, 2002)\n\nAnother late-draft bargain. It took Keisel until 2006 to become a starter. He was a special teams star first and missed his entire second season with a shoulder injury. But once he got going, he kept going. He became their starting right defensive end for eight seasons until injuries took their toll in his final year, 2014. The defenses the Steelers played back then featured their linebackers more than their ends as pass rushers so he did not pile up a lot of sacks, but he pushed the pocket and put pressure on quarterbacks, was agile and covered plenty of ground that helped make their zone blitz under Dick LeBeau work.\n\n12. CB Ike Taylor (4, 2003)\n\nThe Steelers still have not drafted a cornerback to make a Pro Bowl since they took Rod Woodson in 1987, and he had his seventh Pro Bowl season with them in 1996. Joe Haden, who was elevated to the Pro Bowl the past year as an alternate, is the only Steelers cornerback at all to make it since Woodson. Taylor was the next closest thing and would have made at least a few Pro Bowls had he intercepted more passes than the 14 he had over his 12-year career.\n\n11. RB Le’Veon Bell (2, 2013)\n\nAmong the best dual-purpose backs in Steelers’ history, Bell not only topped 1,200 yards rushing in three of his five seasons with the Steelers, but he also holds their top three spots for a receiver in the backfield with seasons of 85, 83 and 75 catches. The only two seasons he finished under 1,200 yards were his rookie season and in 2015 when he played just six games because of injury.\n\n10. ILB Lawrence Timmons (1, 2007)\n\nThe first draft pick (No. 15) under Mike Tomlin, Timmons was Ryan Shazier-like. He could play all over the field and often did, moving to outside linebacker in a pinch when it was necessary. Timmons played 11 seasons, his first 10 with the Steelers. He did not become a regular starter until his third season after the Steelers released Larry Foote at his Foote’s request to make room for him.\n\n9. G David DeCastro (1, 2012)\n\nThe offensive lines were not the strength of their team until they started feeding them players like this; he arrived two years after Pouncey. His rookie season was delayed by a severe preseason knee injury, but DeCastro then became one of their most reliable players and among the best guards in the NFL.\n\n8. NT Casey Hampton (1, 2001)\n\nThe Steelers actually traded down in the first round from 16 to 19 to get a player who anchored the middle of their defense for the next 13 years, starting as a rookie. Those were some of the best defenses in the NFL annually and, unlike today, the Steelers relied heavily and often on their nose tackle.\n\n7. DL Cam Heyward (1, 2011)\n\nAt No. 31, Heyward nearly fell out of the first round. If teams knew what they do now, he would have gone near the top of it. He did not start until his third season and missed half of 2016 with a torn chest muscle but has been a standout every other year. Soon to be 31, he has gotten better with age, making two of the past three first-team All-Pros. He’s also annually selected by his team as their defensive captain.\n\n6. WR Antonio Brown (6, 2010)\n\nThe end turned ugly and so were some of his antics in-between, but there is little question this was one great draft pick. After a slow start to his rookie season, Brown topped 1,000 yards in all but one of his nine other seasons with the Steelers (injuries slowed him in 2012). He led the NFL in receptions in 2014 (129) and 2015 (136) — the top two totals in team history — and led the league in receiving yards in 2014 (1,698) and 2017 (1,533). He owns the team’s four most productive seasons in receiving yards, topped by 1,834 in 2015. It did not take a genius to use a sixth-round pick on him, but then as with Brady, everyone passed on him in the first five rounds.\n\n5. OLB T.J. Watt (1, 2017)\n\nBy far the most recent draft selection to make our list. He does so and this high because of his spectacular first three seasons in the league. He has more sacks in his first three seasons than any former Steelers draft pick, 34.5, topped by last season’s 14.5 when he should have been the league’s defensive player of the year. Last year he also led the NFL with eight forced fumbles, had eight passes defended, 55 tackles and two interceptions. He unselfishly agreed to switch from right outside linebacker, where he started 15 games as a rookie, to the left to accommodate Bud Dupree’s move to the right. He has missed just one game in three years, which includes two Pro Bowls and one first-team All-Pro.\n\n4. TE Heath Miller (1, 2005)\n\nAll they did after drafting him at No. 30 was win two Super Bowls in the next four seasons and go to a third in his sixth season. The Steelers covet tight ends who can block and catch and he was the best combination at doing it in their history. Because he was used as a blocker, he did not get the kind of publicity others did at his position — he made just two Pro Bowls in his 11 seasons. However, he caught 592 passes for 6,569 yards and 45 touchdowns and since he retired after the 2015 season, the Steelers still haven’t filled his shoes.\n\n3. C Maurkice Pouncey (1, 2010)\n\nThe Steelers have a long, illustrious history at center with two of them in the Hall of Fame, Mike Webster and Dermontti Dawson. Guard Jeff Hartings was an outstanding replacement for the retired Dawson after the Steelers signed him as a free agent and converted him to center in 2001. But when Hartings retired after the 2006 season, the string was broken. They signed free agent Sean Mahan, who started one season in 2007 and then was dispatched back to Tampa Bay. They signed another free agent in 2008, Justin Hartwig, and he did OK while starting every game the next two seasons. But after they drafted Pouncey with the 18th pick, he won the job as a rookie and he’s still there as the unquestioned leader of the line and offense.\n\n2. QB Ben Roethlisberger (1, 2004)\n\nWhile Hall of Fame quarterbacks are the most valuable commodity, choosing him at No. 11 was a no-brainer for the Steelers. At least it should have been. There was some discussion about drafting guard Shawn Andrew of Arkansas, but Dan Rooney famously kept his brain trust on point. Good thing.\n\n1. S Troy Polamalu (Round 1, 2003)\n\nIn a previous ranking, I had Polamalu second and Ben Roethlisberger first. Troy gets the edge this time for two reasons: He will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year in his first year of eligibility (but then, Roethlisberger likely will make it too) and it took more maneuvering and more moxie by the Steelers to draft him. They traded with Kansas City to move up from 27th to 16th, the first time they did that in their history (they would do it twice more under Colbert for Santonio Holmes and Devin Bush). They did not give up much either. The Chiefs got that 27th pick along with Nos. 92 and 200. A steal.\n\n(Photo: George Gojkovich / Getty Images)"
