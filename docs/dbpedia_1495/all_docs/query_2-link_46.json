He gets caught peeking inside on outside runs WAY too often.\n\nSFrush\n\nVeteran\n\nPosts: 5,081\n\nOriginally posted by WRATHman44:\n\nI think we are fine. Davis will backup G and T, either directly or indirectly. G goes down, Davis goes in. T goes down, Boone goes to T, Davis to G. Another T goes down, Davis goes to T, Kilgore goes to G. Remember, both Davis and Kilgore will be active on gameday. Additionally, Davis played T for his first few seasons in the league. He's probably not quick enough to be a starter at tackle, but he's good enough as a 3rd stringer.\n\nI think the last time Leonard Davis played tackle was in 05 or 06. I know it's been a while.\n\nbtthepunk\n\nVeteran\n\nPosts: 22,704\n\nOriginally posted by monsterzero789:\n\nPlease please please cut Haralson!!!!\n\nI'd rather cut Dobbs or Brock.\n\nGEEK\n\nVeteran\n\nPosts: 19,200\n\nGood vet signing.\n\nThe guy has 3-4 OLB experience, proven track record of production - especially last season, and can provide some insights on the Cardinals D to our team.\n\nHaggins isn't expected to start.

If Haralson makes 1-1.5 a year, he looks a lot better.\n\nbtthepunk\n\nVeteran\n\nPosts: 22,704\n\nOriginally posted by sfout:\n\nOriginally posted by btthepunk:\n\nOriginally posted by monsterzero789:\n\nPlease please please cut Haralson!!!!\n\nI'd rather cut Dobbs or Brock.\n\nwhy would you want to cut someone who can play 4 positions?

Quality over quantity.\n\nYou cant stay that considering you haven't seen Dobbs play in anything but preseason. Coaches dont make players learn 4 positions without planning on keeping them. Besides thats the point Haralson is making $3Mil while Dobbs is making $400K with 4 times the responsibility, that is quality to find a player capable of shouldering such a workload. Haralson is a replaceable over the hill reliable OLB, Dobbs is a young, promising player with potential at 4 positions."
