        "text": "The Senior Bowl\n\nBy CK Stiller\n\nThe Senior Bowl has, on average, contained 2/3 Steelers draft picks since 2000. League wide, somewhere between 79-88% of the players involved in the game have gone on to be drafted during that same time span. That is roughly one third of the average rookie draft class.\n\n2000 - The Steelers drafted 5 players from the game. Kendrick Clancy and Hank Poteat were taken in the third round. Danny Farmer in the fourth. Clark Haggans in the fifth, and Chris Combs in the sixth. 85% of the players were drafted in all.\n\n2001 - Only a single player was taken. Kendrell Bell was taken in the second round. 79% of the players were drafted in all this year.\n\n2002 - Once again, the Steelers took five players. Kendall Simmons in the first round. Antwaan Randle El in the second. Chris Hope in the third. Larry Foote in the fourth. Brett Keisel in the seventh. Each of those players became a starter, which made this the best season by far. 82% of those who played ended up being drafted.\n\n2003 - In stark contrast to the previous season, the Steelers took no one from the game. League wide, 88% of those who participated ended up being drafted.\n\n2004 - Four draft picks. Ricardo Colclough in the second. Max Starks in the third. Nathaniel Adibi in the fifth. Bo Lacy in the sixth. In this year, 84% of those who played were drafted.\n\n2005 - The Steelers took three players. Bryant McFadden in the second round. Fred Gibson in the fourth. Noah Herron in the seventh. Only 79% of those who played in this year�s game ended up being drafted.\n\n2006 - The Steelers did not draft any.\n\nThere are a number of players who could interest the Steelers this year. They�ve apparently been more active this year compared to year�s past, and showed special interest in Adam Carricker on the first day of practice. The Steelers could be looking at help in a number of positions. LB, DL, and OL are all real possibilities. Here are some of the prospects who impressed this week:\n\nRyan Kalil, C (6�3 ft., 285 lbs.) - An undersized center prospect, a bit like Nick Mangold last year. More of a technician. He could find himself going in the first round this year. With the retirement of Hartings, some fans are going to link him with the Steelers. Like Mangold last year, though, he is a better fit for a zone blocking scheme, and the Steelers probably won�t show much interest.\n\nJoey Staley, OT (6�6 ft., 300 lbs.) - A great athlete who had one of the better weeks of practice. He will probably need to put on weight at the next level. Most likely the second or third tackle off the board.\n\nJames Marten, OT (6�7 ft., 305 lbs.) - Not the most talented tackle. A mid round (maybe a third rounder) prospect who shows some grittiness. He got into scuffles with two different defenders during the week of practice (Woodley, Patterson), and could play right or left tackle.\n\nTony Ugoh, OT (6�5 ft., 301 lbs.) - Will likely find himself going in the first or second round. The Steelers apparently interviewed him. He impressed all week. A great athlete, and has room to bulk up at the next level.\n\nBen Grubbs, OG (6�3 ft., 302 lbs.) - An athlete who could use coaching up. Will most likely go in the third round or later. He was able to beat DT Ryan McBean in 1-on-1 drills during practice. Fits the mold of a Steelers guard.\n\nAmobi Okoye, DT (6�2 ft., 287 lbs.) - Had one of the best weeks of practice of anyone. He was nearly unstoppable all week long. Some thought he could play NT at the next level, but he weighed far too light for that. Has some pass rushing ability. Could play 3-4 DE. Ideal tackle in a cover-2 scheme. First rounder.\n\nAdam Carricker, DE (6�6 ft., 290 lbs.) - Maybe the top prospect to participate. Had the best week of practice, and the Steelers showed a lot of interest. He could play as a 3-4 DE, or 4-3 DE. Not a dominant pass rusher in college, he dominated during practice. A first rounder.\n\nDavid Harris, ILB (6�2 ft., 240 lbs.) - Was a force in the middle all week long. Has great instincts and showed a lot of ability against the run. Not the most athletic LB, he would probably be better suited to a 3-4. Mid-round prospect.\n\nTim Crowder, DE/OLB (6�4 ft., 270 lbs.) - Had a great week of practice. He projects more as a 4-3 DE, but showed a good deal of athletic ability during practice. He could find himself going to a 3-4 team as an OLB. He had a great senior season rushing the passer, and showed ability all week long. Looks to be a second rounder.\n\nAnthony Spencer, DE/OLB (6�3 ft., 260 lbs.) - Had a great week of practice. Is a definite 3-4 OLB prospect who showed a lot of ability rushing the passer. His stock is rising greatly. A first or second rounder.\n\nStewart Bradley, OLB (6�3, 256 lbs.) - Played OLB in college. Showed some ability to rush the passer during the week. Not the most athletic LB. A guy who may fit better in a 3-4 as opposed to a 4-3. Second or third rounder.\n\nBrian Leonard, RB/FB (6�1, 224) - Leonard slimmed down to show he could play RB at the next level. He has good hands and blocking ability. Has good footwork. He may go in the third round."
