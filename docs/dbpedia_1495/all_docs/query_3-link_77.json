        "text": "JfromthaTray said:\n\nI think we need one of those hybrid ends/outside lb's. We need a pass rush and personally, I think the Babin pick last year was a mistake. We should have went with the best o lineman there.\n\nYeah, we should've stayed put and took Jacob Rogers ...When Babin is putting up between 8 and 12 sacks every year and punishing RBs stupid enough to run to his side, are you still going to think it was a mistake?\n\nAnyway, for this draft, we should just add the best athlete available...The draft is about acquiring talent, not completely filling your needs...If the BPA just happens to be at a need position, then so be it, but we're going to be taking the BPA at this year in every round IMO...\n\nJ you from the Third. Man I gotta agree on the Yates thing all of my family has gone there and when you talk about Texas football they better be mentioned very high. Anyway I agreed with you about Babin last year and if you talked to Aaron Glenn after the pick he did not know who the guy was. I have changed my mind since I have seen him working out, the kid is dedicated to becoming a better player and he is like a sponge sucking up every bit of info any LB has to offer. I think he will be ok for the next couple of years, that does not mean I dont want DJ or Merrimen. I would love for our LB crew to be somethin like this. Babin, Wong, Greenwood, Merrimen. And we are training Peek to play ILB were he could shine as the BUC linebacker.\n\nSo D rek, you are another Tat lover who knows very little about the game. Babin won't be around long enough to average 8 to 12 sacks per yr. He is a guy form a small school who was just better than his competition. Thats why he jumped out at you on film. Had he to Michigan, Miami, USC, etc..., he probably wouldn't have started. BTW, why didn't he go to a big time school. I have my opinions. O VER RA TED.. ...\n\nJfromthaTray said:\n\nSo D rek, you are another Tat lover who knows very little about the game. Babin won't be around long enough to average 8 to 12 sacks per yr.

Guess you don't think much of Jerry Rice, Steve McNair, Andre Reed, Terrell Owens, Marshall Faulk, Ben Rothelisberger, Daunte Culpepper, and the list goes on and on. These guys all came from \"small\" schools, and have been great in the NFL. For you to question another poster's knowledge of the game is humorous.\n\nAs I said the list goes on and on which means that there are numerous other players than the ones I mentioned. Might I ask how you KNOW that Babin would have been there in later rounds? Did you happen to have insider knowledge of all 31 other NFL teams and where they had him rated on their draft board? Are you a league wide scout? We've been over the Babin pick countless times, and there were several teams interested in him. The Texans knew the guy they wanted and they went after him. As Vinny pointed out he faired pretty well as a rookie. I'm guessing you're using the same crystal ball you used to predict that Babin won't be around long enough to get 8 to 12 sacks a year to predict that no other team would have drafted him until a later round.\n\nJfromthaTray said:\n\nBabin won't be around long enough to average 8 to 12 sacks per yr.\n\nIt is silly to think that you can project a player's career when you've only seen him play one NFL season. It's even funnier when someone feels they know where a player should go moreso than an NFL GM who's got an entire scouting department at his disposal. Not to mention the game film he's watched, the ability to interview the prospect, etc. Yet since he's from a school you've never heard of or he's a name you don't recognize you feel you have a better grasp of his value as a NFL prospect.\n\nJfromthaTray said:\n\nPut Babin in the same category as those guys when he puts up the hall of fame numbers that they have put up. BTW, you forgot about Walter Payton. My point is that he wasn't worth that high of a pick, he would have still been there in later rounds.\n\nBabin was a sure fire 5th round pick, nothing better...WTF were we thinking?\n\nSeriously though, if you even briefly followed the draft last year, you would know that most people had Babin pegged as a late 1st rounder...If we didn't take him at 27, he would've been gone by 28...\n\ntexasguy346 said:\n\nAs I said the list goes on and on which means that there are numerous other players than the ones I mentioned.

JfromthaTray, you got knocked tha f*** out!!! :woot\n\nStanding 8 count baby, this one's going 15 rounds. These are the same GM's and experts who had Mike Mamula and Ryan Leaf pegged as 1st rounders. Babin is in the Texans version of the Killer B's. Boselli, Benny(Joppru) and Babin. And as for Stat Boy with the tackles and sacks, how many of those players were 1st rounders. Also, it might have been a good thing if we wouldn't have traded up to get him and he was gone by the time we were on the clock. Admit it folks, he didn't live up to the billing of being a 1st rounder. The experts say that it takes 3 years to grade a player, until then, I'll reserve any further comments but you know what I think of him.\n\nBTW Mr. Moderator, I haven't masked any foul language in my posts but you sent me a private message, I hope you express the same concerns to the others as to how they address me.\n\nJfromthaTray said:\n\nAlso, it might have been a good thing if we wouldn't have traded up to get him and he was gone by the time we were on the clock.

Were you expecting him to jump right in and lead the league in sacks? If so then your expectations were too high for his rookie season."
