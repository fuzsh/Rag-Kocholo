        "text": "We have reached the fifth round of our fan polls for the best Pittsburgh Steelers players of all time by draft round. Thus far, results have gone largely as expected with a few surprises. Once we are through all seven rounds we will share the results with everyone and share our own list.\n\nThis round had so much promise to be one of the most heated battles of any. And then there was that one Hall of Famer dropped in the middle of a lot of really good players. But we are going to give everyone a shot today.\n\nHere are this week’s contenders.\n\nMike Webster | Center\n\nHardy Nickerson | Linebacker\n\nBarry Foster | Running back\n\nClark Haggans | Linebacker\n\nWilliam Gay | Cornerback\n\nThis is normally the time in the story where we offer a little context about each of these players. And make no mistake, guys like Clark Haggans, William Gay and Barry Foster are all great players. Hardy Nickerson as well.\n\nBut we are talking about Mike Webster. Perhaps the greatest center to ever play in the NFL, certainly top 3 and the anchor the offensive line for all those dominant teams of the 1970’s.\n\nSo cast your vote and if you aren’t voting for Webster, make your case for another player."
