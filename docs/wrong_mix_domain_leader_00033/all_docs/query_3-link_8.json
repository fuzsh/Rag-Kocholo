Regardless of the political form, however, British rule brought profound changes, transforming the various states socially and economically.\n\nThe Brookes and the North Borneo Company faced prolonged resistance before they consolidated their control, while occasional local revolts punctuated British rule in Malaya as well. In Sarawak in 1857, for example, interior Chinese gold-mining communities nearly succeeded in toppling the intrusive James Brooke before being crushed, while Muslim chief Mat Salleh fought expanding British power in North Borneo from 1895 to 1900. The Brookes mounted bloody military campaigns to suppress headhunting (practiced at the time by many Indigenous peoples of the interior) and to incorporate especially the Iban into their domain; similar operations were carried out in North Borneo. Those who resisted British annexation or policies were portrayed by the British authorities as treacherous, reactionary rebels; many of the same figures, however, were later hailed in Malaysia as nationalist heroes.\n\nThe British administration eventually achieved peace and security. In Malaya the Malay sultans retained their symbolic status at the apex of an aristocratic social system, although they lost some of their political authority and independence. British officials believed that the rural Malay farmers needed to be protected from economic and cultural change and that traditional class divisions should be maintained. Hence, most economic development was left to Chinese and Indian immigrants, as long as it served long-term colonial interests. The Malay elite enjoyed a place in the new colonial order as civil servants. Many Malayan and Bornean villagers, however, were affected by colonial taxes and consequently were forced to shift from subsistence to cash-crop farming; their economic well-being became subject to fluctuations in world commodity prices. Much economic growth occurred; British policies promoted the planting of pepper, gambier (a plant producing a resin used for tanning and dyeing), tobacco, oil palm, and especially rubber, which along with tin became the region’s major exports. Malaya and British North Borneo developed extractive, plantation-based economies oriented toward the resource and market needs of the industrializing West.\n\nBritish authorities in Malaya devoted much effort to constructing a transportation infrastructure in which railways and road networks linked the tin fields to the coast; port facilities also were improved to facilitate resource exports. These developments stimulated growth in the tin and rubber industries to meet world demand. The tin industry remained chiefly in immigrant Chinese hands through the 19th century, but more highly capitalized, technologically sophisticated British firms took over much of the tin production and export by World War II. The rubber tree was first introduced from Brazil in the 1870s, but rubber did not supersede the earlier coffee and gambier plantings until near the end of the century. By the early 20th century thousands of acres of forest had been cleared for rubber growing, much of it on plantations but some on smallholdings. Malaya became the world’s greatest exporter of natural rubber, with rubber and tin providing the bulk of colonial tax revenues.\n\nThe British also improved public health facilities, which reduced the incidence of various tropical diseases, and they facilitated the establishment of government Malay schools and Christian mission (mostly English-language) schools; the Chinese generally had to develop their own schools. These separate school systems helped perpetuate the pluralistic society. Some Chinese, Malays, and Indians benefited from British economic policies; others enjoyed no improvement or experienced a drop in their standard of living. Government-sanctioned opium and alcohol use provided a major source of revenue in some areas.\n\nBetween 1800 and 1941 several million Chinese entered Malaya (especially the west-coast states), Sarawak, and British North Borneo to work as labourers, miners, planters, and merchants. The Chinese eventually became part of a prosperous, urban middle class that controlled retail trade. South Indian Tamils were imported as the workforce on Malayan rubber estates. At the turn of the 19th century Malays accounted for the vast majority of Malaya’s residents, but the influx of immigrants over the subsequent decades significantly eroded that majority. A compartmentalized society developed on the peninsula, and colonial authorities skillfully utilized “divide and rule” tactics to maintain their control. With most Malays in villages, Chinese in towns, and Indians on plantations, the various ethnic groups basically lived in their own neighbourhoods, followed different occupations, practiced their own religions, spoke their own languages, operated their own schools, and, later, formed their own political organizations. By the 1930s ethnically oriented nationalist currents began to stir in Malaya, Singapore, and Sarawak. Malay groups either pursued Islamic revitalization and reform or debated the future of the Malays in a plural society, while Chinese organizations framed their activities around political trends in China.\n\nThe Borneo states experienced many of the same changes. Charles Brooke, second raja of Sarawak, passed the state on to his son, Charles Vyner de Windt Brooke, in 1917. Vyner Brooke reigned until 1946, furthering the pattern of personal rule established by his father and by his great-uncle, James Brooke. Economic incentives attracted Chinese immigrants, and by 1939 the Chinese accounted for about one-fourth of the state’s population. Similar to Malaya, Sarawak became ethnically, occupationally, and socially segmented, with most Malays in government or fishing, most Chinese in trade, labour, or cash-crop farming, and most Iban in the police force or shifting cultivation. Gambier and pepper were planted, with Sarawak emerging as the major world supplier of the latter crop. Later, rubber became dominant, and a petroleum industry developed. Most cash-crop agriculture remained in smallholdings rather than in the plantations that were characteristic elsewhere. Christian missionary activity and church, Chinese, and Malay schools also generated sociocultural change. In the 1930s ethnic consciousness rose among both the Chinese and the Malay communities as Vyner Brooke’s personal rule began to erode.\n\nThe North Borneo Company operated differently from the Brookes in that it concentrated on developing an extractive economy for the benefit of its shareholders, based mostly on Western-owned tobacco and rubber estates and forest exploitation. Like the Brookes, however, the company created a single state out of many local societies and tolerated little open political activity. Christian missions facilitated change among non-Muslims. Significantly, immigrant Chinese and Indonesians also diversified the population through their employment as plantation workers.\n\nPolitical transformation\n\nThe occupation of Malaya and Borneo by Japan (1942–45) during World War II generated tremendous changes in those territories. Their economies were disrupted, and communal tensions were exacerbated because Malays and Chinese reacted differently to Japanese control. The Japanese desperately needed access to the natural resources of Southeast Asia; they invaded Malaya in December 1941, having neutralized American military power in Hawaii through the Pearl Harbor attack and in the Philippines through attacks on Manila. Shortly thereafter, the Japanese controlled the peninsula, Singapore, and Borneo. Pro-communist, predominantly Chinese guerrillas waged resistance in Malaya, and a brief Chinese-led revolt also erupted in North Borneo. In many places increasing politicization and conflict within and among ethnic groups developed as a result of economic hardship and selective repression; in northern Borneo the rule of the Brookes and of the North Borneo Company was permanently undermined, while in Malaya the Chinese and Malays also realized that British domination was not everlasting. Nonetheless, most people welcomed the Japanese defeat in 1945.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Sarawak and North Borneo, both of which had been British protectorates until the Japanese occupation, became British crown colonies. Sarawak, however, faced a turbulent political situation. Many Malays opposed the termination of Brooke rule and Sarawak’s cession to Britain, and the resulting sociopolitical divisions persisted for years. With the establishment of the British North Borneo colony, the capital was moved from Sandakan to Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu). Some local self-government was introduced in Malaya. The major catalyst of political organization, however, was a British proposal to form a single Malayan Union, incorporating all the Malayan territories except Singapore, that would diminish state autonomy and accord equal political and citizenship rights to non-Malays. A tremendous upsurge of Malay political feeling against this plan, led by Dato’ Onn bin Jaafar, resulted in the creation in 1946 of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO) as a vehicle for Malay nationalism and political assertiveness. Strikes, demonstrations, and boycotts doomed the proposed Malayan Union, and the British began to negotiate with UMNO about the Malayan future.\n\nThe negotiations resulted in the creation in 1948 of the Federation of Malaya, which unified the territories but provided special guarantees of Malay rights, including the position of the sultans. These developments alarmed the more radical and impoverished sectors of the Chinese community. In 1948 the Communist Party of Malaya—a mostly Chinese movement formed in 1930 that had provided the backbone of the anti-Japanese resistance—went into the jungles and began a guerrilla insurgency to defeat the colonial government, sparking a 12-year period of unrest known as the Malayan Emergency. The communists waged a violent and ultimately futile struggle supported by only a small segment of the Chinese community. The British took measures to suppress the insurgency by military means, which included a strategy that forcibly moved many rural Chinese into tightly controlled New Villages located near or along the roadsides. Although this policy isolated villagers from guerrillas, it also increased the government’s unpopularity. The British finally achieved success when, under the leadership of British high commissioner Gerald Templer, they actively began to address political and economic grievances as well as the insurgency, which further isolated the rebels.\n\nPromising independence, British officials commenced negotiations with the various ethnic leaders, including those of UMNO and the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA), formed in 1949 by wealthy Chinese businessmen. A coalition consisting of UMNO (led by the aristocratic moderate Tunku Abdul Rahman), the MCA, and the Malayan Indian Congress contested the national legislative elections held in 1955 and won all but one seat. This established a permanent political pattern of a ruling coalition—known first as the Alliance Party and later as the National Front (Barisan Nasional; BN)—that united ethnically based, mostly elite-led parties of moderate to conservative political leanings, with UMNO as the major force.\n\nOn August 31, 1957, the Federation of Malaya achieved independence under an Alliance government headed by Tunku Abdul Rahman as prime minister. Singapore, with its predominantly Chinese population, remained outside the federation as a British crown colony. The arrangement tended to favour the Malays politically, with UMNO leaders holding most federal and state offices and the kingship rotating among the various Malay sultans, but the Chinese were granted liberal citizenship rights and maintained strong economic power. Kuala Lumpur became the federal capital.\n\nNew currents also were emerging in Borneo. Colonial rule succeeded in rebuilding and expanding the economies of the two colonies, with rubber and timber providing the basis for postwar economic growth. Health and education facilities slowly reached beyond the towns. Political consciousness began to spread as elections were held for local councils. During the 1950s the Kadazan community, stimulated particularly by the development of radio broadcasting and newspapers, became involved in North Borneo politics, while Chinese and Malay leaders formed Sarawak’s first political parties—some espousing multiethnic identities—in expectation of independence. Political activity accelerated with the mooting in 1961 of the proposal by Malayan and British officials for a federated state that would include Malaya, Sarawak, North Borneo, Brunei, and Singapore. New parties formed in North Borneo representing the Kadazan, Chinese, and various Muslim communities. Elections were held in North Borneo and in Sarawak, with most of the parties in both colonies accepting independence through merging with the new federation, called Malaysia; the inclination to join Malaysia increased after the Philippines claimed North Borneo, based on former Sulu suzerainty.\n\nBritish leaders proposed a Malaysian federation as a way of terminating their now burdensome colonial rule over Singapore, Sarawak, and North Borneo, even though those states were historically and ethnically distinct from Malaya and from each other. It was in many ways to be a marriage of convenience. Malaya was closely linked economically with bustling Singapore, and the Malays felt a kinship to the various Muslim groups in Borneo. Tunku Abdul Rahman believed the federation could defuse potential leftist Chinese activity while balancing the Chinese majority in Singapore with the non-Chinese majorities of the Borneo states. Malaya already contained a Chinese minority of nearly 40 percent, with Malays barely in the majority there. Hence, on September 16, 1963, the Federation of Malaysia was formed, with North Borneo—renamed Sabah—and Sarawak constituting East Malaysia. Brunei, which had been invited to join, chose to remain a British protectorate and later became independent as a small, oil-rich Malay sultanate.\n\nCraig A. Lockard\n\nMalaysia from independence to c. 2000\n\nThe new, hurriedly formed country faced many political problems, including a period of Indonesian military opposition that ended in 1966, sporadic communist insurgency in Sarawak, periodic disenchantment in East Malaysia over federal policies and the domination of Peninsular Malaysia, and the secession of Singapore from the federation (at Malaysia’s urging) in 1965. The latter event resulted from increasing friction between the mostly Malay federal leaders and the mostly Chinese state leaders, especially Singapore’s independent-minded chief minister, Lee Kuan Yew, who disagreed on national goals. Under Lee’s autocratic direction and unconventional economic policies, Singapore became a highly prosperous but tightly controlled country, and relations with Malaysia gradually improved. Both countries became founding members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1967.\n\nThe secession of Singapore allowed UMNO to exercise more influence over federal policies, even if it did not end political uncertainties. Communal tensions on the peninsula following a heated election generated riots and a countrywide state of emergency in 1969–70. Many non-Malays resented the government’s attempts to build national unity and identity through such measures as increasing the use of the Malay language in education and public life. The Chinese were particularly worried by government policies aimed at distributing more wealth to Malays. For instance, the New Economic Policy, launched in 1971 and renewed as the New Development Policy in 1991, was designed to increase significantly the wealth and economic potential of the bumiputra (Malays and other Indigenous peoples)—especially the Malays. It included affirmative-action policies for bumiputra citizens in education and in employment in the civil service. A growing Islamic movement also fueled tensions in the country and wrought divisions within the Malay community itself. Beginning in the late 1970s, this Islamic fundamentalist revival, or dakwah movement, increasingly attracted the support of young Malays who felt alienated by what they perceived as the growth of a Westernized, materialistic society. Finally, although rural development policies reduced poverty rates, large pockets of urban and especially rural poverty persisted, with many regional and ethnic inequities in the distribution of wealth. Radical critics of the government (including communists, socialists, Islamic militants, and progressive intellectuals) were politically marginalized and sometimes detained.\n\nFor Sarawak and Sabah, politics within Malaysia proved to be a turbulent experience. The decision to join the federation was made in haste, and many people continued to resent the loss of their autonomy, especially their loss of control over growing petroleum revenues. Political crises occurred periodically in Sarawak, although it was governed after 1970 by a Malay-dominated, profederal but multiethnic coalition that represented a triumph of peninsular alliance-style politics. By the mid-1980s, however, some Iban leaders had challenged the coalition for being too accommodating to wealthy Malay and Chinese interests. The government encouraged the assimilation of Sarawak society to that of the peninsula and dramatically increased the exploitation of timber resources, often at the expense of interior peoples. Sabah politics also were contentious, with ongoing tensions between Muslim and non-Muslim groups. Between 1967 and 1975 Chief Minister Tun Mustapha ruled the state rigidly, absorbing or repressing opponents, promoting Islam, and challenging federal policies. The multiethnic coalition that replaced Mustapha continued to preside over rapid economic growth spurred by the exploitation of Sabah’s bountiful natural resources. Tensions resurfaced in the mid-1980s, however, when a Christian Kadazan-led party swept into power and followed policies opposed by federal leaders. Although peninsular sociopolitical patterns increasingly influenced Sabah and Sarawak, the states remained unique within the Malaysian system.\n\nDespite these difficulties, the country as a whole maintained its quasi-democratic parliamentary political system, including regular elections and moderate political diversity but also some restrictions on civil liberties, such as a ban on public discussion of issues deemed “sensitive.” Tunku Abdul Rahman was succeeded as prime minister by Tun Haji Abdul Razak bin Hussein in 1970. Upon Abdul Razak’s death in 1976, another UMNO leader, Datuk (later Tun) Hussein Onn, replaced him. In 1981 Tun Hussein Onn, owing to ill health, relinquished his positions as president of UMNO and as Malaysian prime minister, allowing Mahathir bin Mohamad to become the fourth prime minister and the first nonaristocrat to hold that office.\n\nMahathir’s 22-year tenure as prime minister was marked by an authoritarian style and economic success. His assertive manner and controversial policies generated a major split within UMNO: in 1986 Deputy Prime Minister Musa Hitam resigned, citing irreconcilable differences, and the following year Mahathir only narrowly survived a challenge to his role as UMNO president (and thus as prime minister). A subsequent challenge to Mahathir’s victory led the courts to declare UMNO illegal because it had failed to register properly. Mahathir was able to outmaneuver his opponents, however, by dissolving UMNO and forming a new Malay party, UMNO Baru (New UMNO; Baru was subsequently dropped in 1997 and the original name restored). Mahathir’s opponents countered by forming Semangat ’46 (Spirit of ’46), which claimed to embody the ideals of the original UMNO (established in 1946) and attempted to unite the disparate opposition groups against the ruling BN coalition headed by UMNO.\n\nDuring the 1980s Anwar Ibrahim rose rapidly within the ruling party, and many believed he was being groomed to be Mahathir’s successor. In 1993 Anwar was elected deputy president of UMNO and deputy prime minister, and within a few years he was considered a potential contestant for the offices of UMNO president and prime minister of Malaysia. In 1997 the country faced a severe economic downturn, and Mahathir and Anwar (who also served as the country’s finance minister) differed over the economic prescriptions necessary to rescue the economy. In September 1998 Mahathir removed Anwar from office, and Anwar subsequently was expelled from UMNO and charged with (and, eventually, convicted of) corruption and sexual misconduct. Demonstrations, under the banner of reformasi (“reform”), ensued in support of Anwar, whose backers claimed that the charges were a bid to humiliate him and to eliminate him as a potential rival of Mahathir."
