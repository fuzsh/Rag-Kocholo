        "text": "This article is about a former Burmese politician. For former Malaysian politician, see Abdul Razak Hussein.\n\nIn this Burmese name, U is an honorific, not a given name.\n\nU Razak (Urdu: عبدالرزاق; Abdul Razaq; Burmese: ဦးရာဇတ်, pronounced [ʔú jàzaʔ]; also Abdul Razak; 20 January 1898 – 19 July 1947) was a Burmese politician and an educationalist. He was a Bamar of Tamil ancestry and also was a cabinet minister in Aung San's pre-independence interim government, and was assassinated on 19 July 1947 along with six other cabinet ministers. July 19 is commemorated each year as Martyrs' Day in Myanmar.[1] Razak was Minister of Education and National Planning, and was chairman of the Burma Muslim Congress.\n\nAbdul Razak was born in Meiktila, Upper Burma, on 20 January 1898 to a Bamar Buddhist, Nyein Hla, and Sheik Abdul Rahman, a wealthy Indian police inspector. While his brothers and sisters chose to be Buddhists, he maintained the Muslim name Razak, in honor of his father. Although nominally Muslim, Razak was a secularist who deeply loved Burma and encouraged unity in diversity. He studied at the Wesleyan School in Mandalay, and continued his studies at the Rangoon College, earning a B.A. degree in English.[2] Throughout his school years, Razak was involved in athletics.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1920, Razak was the first Burmese organiser of a boycott to the British colonial education system. In 1921, he became headmaster of Mandalay National High School. Razak's natural charisma was effective in persuading the Mandalayans. Mandalay, where he taught, was a center of Burmese Buddhist faith and culture. Yet Razak, of ethnic Bamat, was fully accepted by the community.[2][3] When Japan invaded Burma in World War II, he was imprisoned.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1945, Abdul Razak was named chairman of the Mandalay branch of Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) and was elected a Member of Parliament to represent Mandalay. He was Minister of Education and National Planning in Aung San's cabinet. He died on 19 July 1947 together with six other cabinet members.[1]\n\nRazak initiated calls for unity between Burmese Muslims and Buddhists. He was a Muslim, but maintained ties to Buddhism, educating himself on Pali, the sacred script of Theravada Buddhism, and helped found the Mandalay College (modern Mandalay University). Razak fathered three children.[citation needed]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
