        "text": "Generally, this paper discusses Malaysia’s nation building process that includes the changing of national understanding from Sultanate perspective towards democratic nation. In 1957, Malaya achieved its independence. Ethnic Malays through United Malays National Organization (UMNO), ethnic Chinese through Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) and ethnic Indian through Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) are the major political parties, which at that time maintained separate identities, based on ethnicity. However, they had to compromise and unify for independence. This paper will also touch on the factors, which influenced the process of nation building, especially internal and external factors. The role of several important leaders, especially former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, their policies and actions to develop and establish Malaysia’s nation building process, is discussed. Keywords: Nation Building; Leadership;\n\nIf any person wants to know and learn about leadership, he or she must have to learn from Mahathir Mohamad about leadership, how to lead the people, and how to turned into the rich country from a poor agricultural economy. He is known as the Father of Modernization for Malaysia. In this respect, dynamic reforms which have taken place in the context of whole Malaysia owe much to the leadership of Mahathir Mohamad. His leadership ability led the community to grow from lower level to upper level and the achievement unparalleled neither by any contemporary leader nor at the present time. He is a true patriot and a multi-talented leader where he was able to achieve a breakthrough in a short period of time. The purpose of this writing is to know about the leadership qualities of Mahathir Mohamad, achievements, and effective ruling ideas which turned Malaysia into a rich and developed country. This paper has written based on the analysis of literature review of some previous works about Mahathir Mohamad and Malaysia.\n\nThis paper explores the significant lessons from Mahathir's domestic and foreign policy pursuit for the developing states and their leaders. From 1979, every mention of Malaysia's multi-faceted development would remain synonymous with Mahathir. The two can hardly be historically separated for they have so much bearings on each other, especially in terms of transformation and development of Mahathir's personal philosophy, political statecraft, thoughts, and ideals for development, and Malaysia's development and excelling not only among rivals and contemporaries, but before the so-called advanced nations and states. The paper is conceptual and used secondary sources of historical method of data collection and analysis. The paper is significant at this material time when many developing states and nations/leaders have lost the commitment, philosophy, practical statecraft, and inspiration, political maxims, and consistent and sustained principles for development which Mahathir embodies, preaches and practices, and has taken Malaysia where it is today with pride, dignity, development, prosperity and stability on both domestic and foreign scenes.\n\nPurpose: The review focuses on past prominent leadership literature, aiming to highlight the emerging thematic evolution of the leadership literature Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative approach by using the literature synthetization to derive to concept and definition of leadership are applied for this research. The concept and definition are discussed at length to see the application and changes of leadership paradigms. Findings: Various leadership theories seem to be overwhelmed with different thematic thoughts – from the earliest trait-based charismatic and authoritative style; to the seemingly complete full-range of effective leadership styles and communicational techniques; and finally, the emergence of the more contemporary value-based leadership theories such as authentic, service, servant, ethical, inclusive, and later the paradoxical yin-yang leadership style. This research concludes that there is no one style fits all. Due to the these complex dynamics as the VUCA 2.0, the concept and practicality of leadership has changed significantly. Research limitations/implications: The review opens with an attempt to define the meaning of contemporary leadership, followed by exploration and analysis of emerging themes, identifying the literature gap, and lastly, a comprehensive discussion on new insights. The review concludes with recommendations of potential future research directions in leadership. Practical implications: this research layout the different perspective of leadership. It begins with the discussion on concept and definition. The practicality of the paper is viewed from the literature standpoint of view. Originality/value: This research manages to compile various definition and concept of leadership. This is important to build a solid understanding on leadership from various literatures. This holistic view helps to build better perspective of leadership in VUCA 2.0 world.\n\nWritten by Hng Hung Yong and translated by Mokhtar Ahmad, this book describes the development of Malaysia's multi-racial society. Its essay discusses the question of change and modernization in the post-1970 Malaysia, focusing in particular on policies and programs related to Dato' Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad became Prime Minister since 1981. The book quotes an opinion. Some essays reflect the views of Dr. Mahathir on race, religion, language and political future of the Malays. Other essays comprise reviews of the title choice in political and economic fields. On the whole, the focus is given to the strategy, namely the public policy that determines the formulation of public policy versus implementation."
