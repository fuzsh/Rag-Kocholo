Following the completion of an undergraduate degree in business (BYU), MBA (Michigan State), and a Ph.D. (Pennsylvania State University in business with minors in computer science, social psychology, and quantitative methods), he joined the faculty at the University of Oregon. A faculty position at Brigham Young University followed, where he enjoyed 30 years of teaching, researching, and writing at BYU’s Marriott School of Management.

Since 2000, Jeanette has sat knee-to-knee with the state’s biggest names and told their epic stories — including those who have passed on such as Stephen Covey, Becky Lockhart, Larry King, Hyrum Smith, Christopher Clark and Ruth Hale. Her cover stories are legendary and have highlighted current superstars including Ryan Smith, Astrid Tuminez, Carine Clark, James Clarke, Todd Pedersen, Steve Young, Mitt Romney, Lindsey Stirling and David Archuleta.\n\nJeanette has presented twice at the Commission on the Status of Women at the United Nations in New York City and has continued to be active in promoting family, entrepreneurism, faith and education.\n\nShe serves the community as she drives a pink golf cart around with stickers such as “Heels on Wheels” and “Charity Never Walketh.” Her life was beautifully depicted in a 17-minute ballet choreographed by the Utah Metropolitan Ballet in 2021.\n\nJeanette was a finalist for Utah’s 2019 Mother of the Year, although her five funny kids like to remind her that she didn’t win. She was born and raised in Idaho Falls, where she landed her first job as a high schooler at the local TV station and launched her journalism career.\n\nShe grew up in a large family in Idaho Falls, where her dad was a school teacher. She was known for being a quiet student who would surprisingly come out strong and win academic contests and debates. As a first-grade student, she won the reading contest for reading 234 books, with the second place student reading 50 books. Throughout her life, she has put her head down and outworked the competition.\n\nJeanette is a cancer survivor, former state senate candidate, on-again-off-again runner, and perpetual cheerleader for the state of Utah.\n\nKara North\n\nBoard Member\n\nKara is a Utah native and managing partner at Moxie Law Group, a female-led personal injury firm, which was recently recognized by the state as one of the Top 100 businesses in Utah advancing opportunities for women in the workplace.

Years later, she transitioned her sales career to the pharmaceutical industry where she was recognized as a top sales rep.\n\nIn the early 2000’s, Andrea and James founded CLEARLINK and began growing their family of five. The Clarkes are now founders, investors, and operators of private and public companies on five continents with over 36,000 employees globally.\n\nAndrea has dedicated her life to her family and makes time to support a number of causes in her community and abroad.

Oaks Foundation, CharityVision, Bridle Up Hope—the Rachel Covey Foundation, The Noorda College of Osteopathic Medicine, and serves as a Governor-appointed Trustee for Utah Valley University, as well as Past-Chair of the UVU’s Women’s Success Center Advisory Board.\n\nWith her exceptional background in nonprofits, Andrea closely oversees the affairs of The Labor and Honor Foundation, the Clarke family charity, which focuses on poverty alleviation, education, and the arts. The name of the foundation is derived from the Clarkes’ English family crest dating back centuries, which instills that whether a task be great or small, ALL work should be done with honor. The Clarkes’ hope is that through their efforts, they might improve the lives of others by giving back with humble thanksgiving for life’s many blessings.\n\nJeremy D.
