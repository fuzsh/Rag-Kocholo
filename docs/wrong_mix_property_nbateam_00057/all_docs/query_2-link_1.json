        "text": "Heidi Pottle\n\nLosing Blake was and still is the most heart-breaking, devastating loss of my life. Blake never lost hope, he never stopped fighting. His spirit lives on and he gives me perspective every SINGLE day.\n\nBlake was passionate about helping others reach their full potential. He once challenged me to attend yoga three times per week for a month on his dime when I needed some motivation to get moving.\n\nI too have a passion for helping others reach their full potential and love connecting with people over the things that make us human, vulnerable and imperfect. Thatâs why I became a marriage and family therapist.\n\nDuring Blakeâs battle with cancer and after his passing, we were so fortunate to have such amazing support. The smallest gesture can mean the world in those moments. As a foundation, we want to pay it forward, as we believe Blake would have done.\n\nHeidi lives with her two kids in Olympia, Washington. In her spare time, she enjoys spending time with friends and family, reading, playing guitar and being out on the water.\n\nJacqueline Hanson\n\nBlake was, and still is a huge part of my life.\n\nWe lived together, built homes together, hiked and traveled together and so much more. My husband and I often ask ourselves âwhat would Blake do?â because the way he lived his life was inspirational. He was mine and my husbandâs best friend and a third parent to our two sons. We thread him through our days, every day, and our love lives on.\n\nCancer, of all forms, impacts so many. The diagnosis is a shock to the system, the fight is heart wrenching, and the experience has changed me forever. Although this experience dealt me many of my darkest days, it also gave me clarity, perspective and purpose. I believe now more than ever that life is about love, human connection and helping others. We want nothing more than to champion Blakeâs memory by offering support to others in his honor.\n\nJacqueline is a Sr. Program Manager in Human Resources and lives in North Bend, Washington - on the property she and her family built together, with Blake.\n\nCandace Christensen\n\nBlake was smart, successful and caring. He was always looking for new ways to grow culturally and spiritually, hence, his love of travel. My husband and I had the amazing opportunity to travel with Blake to Bali. We learned about Hinduism, which is centered on maintaining a harmonious relationship with God, people, and nature. Just as in Christianity, Hindus believes life does not end at the death of the physical body. The body dies but the soul does not. This, I believe. Also, while in Bali Blake made sure that we bought and delivered gifts and school supplies to a local orphanage.\n\nLosing Blake is devastating. Every child has so many lessons to teach their parents. Every child is a gift. When all is going well, you take that for granted.\n\nI was diagnosed with Inflammatory Breast Cancer within months of Blakeâs Diagnosis. I credit his positive attitude and fighting spirit for getting me through all my treatments and surgery. I am currently NED, which means â no evidence of diseaseâ. Blake and I were so lucky to have the support of family and friends. This is a gift that we can still pay forward.\n\nCandace lives with her husband and Blakeâs dad, Steve, in Olympia. In addition to Blake, she has two inspiring daughters, Heidi and Jacqueline, an unbelievable son-in-law, Daniel, and four talented grandchildren, Julian, Marielle, Caton and Camden. Â She treasures time with family and friends, gardening and travel.\n\nFrances Holtman\n\nFrances is a long-time friend and colleague of Blake. She met Blake when he was in high school when he played tennis with her nephew, Matt. She had the privilege of working with him at Slalom for 8 years and experienced many fun outdoor adventures with him.\n\nFrances is passionate about making a positive impact in the world, and believes as Blake did, that there is a cure and we just need to find it. She loves exploring the outdoors - skiing, hiking, and being on the water - any day outside and in the mountains is a great day.\n\nFrances lives in the Seattle area with her husband, Eric. She is an Executive Coach and Senior Director at Slalom."
