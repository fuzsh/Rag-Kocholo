        "text": "THANK YOU — to the donors whose philanthropy made this possible; to colleagues who advance their units’ priorities with generosity of spirit and donors’ goals at heart; to those who guide efforts to have philanthropy impact Penn State University; and to all those involved in this effort — THANK YOU! #philanthropy #WeAre\n\nAs a member of Penn State's Division of Development and Alumni Relations Awards Committee over the past three years, we recognized colleagues, as voted on by their peers, for their outstanding work in a variety of categories. We also shined a spotlight on the good work of volunteers like Dr. Priscilla Hamilton, to whom I was fortunate to present the 2024 Charles Lupton Volunteer Award for her tireless efforts on behalf of Penn State Behrend. The committee, a team of engaged colleagues from across the University led by incredibly gifted individuals, twice set a record for the number of nominations received for the Division's 13 awards, both at the end of A Greater Penn State for 21st Century Excellence and again at the beginning of Penn State's next campaign. We welcomed recipients at delightful pre-event receptions, then feted them in multi-media awards ceremonies before standing room-only crowds and a vast online audience. Most importantly, we formed a bond through diligence and respectful deliberation that has led to great relationships. I am grateful!\n\nThe Penn State Alumni Association, the largest dues-paying alumni association in the country, seeks its next Director of Alumni Development. I work closely with this person, and am happy to answer any questions you have if you want to be the next person helping Penn Staters impact the university that they love."
