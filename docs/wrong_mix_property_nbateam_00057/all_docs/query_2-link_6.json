        "text": "Rival executives believe the Blazers are interested in exploring a swap of Felton to the Lakers for Steve Blake, with L.A. sending another piece to make the salaries match and compensate the Blazers for getting the better player and future cost savings in the deal. The Portland coaching staff and front office are comfortable with Blake, who could provide a calming presence as the team battles through numerous distractions. Coach Nate McMillan appears to be safe for the time being, according to people in contact with Blazers officials.\n\nIn anticipation of her 30th birthday on March 27, Kristen Blake set up a website at kristensbirthdaywish.com to provide links for people to donate to various charities she and Steve support. Steve Blake has partnered with the Children’s Cancer Assn. in honor of Ketchum. Blake also signed up with Athletes vs. Cancer, a foundation that Lakers forward Matt Barnes founded in 2008 after losing his mother, Ann, to lung cancer. Kristen Blake is currently training for the Hollywood Half Marathon on April 7. She hopes to raise at least $1,300, which Steve will match, to donate to Samaritan’s Purse, an international relief organization. They also will visit a sponsored child this summer in Rwanda through Africa New Life, which provides medical supplies.\n\nThe much maligned Los Angeles Lakers bench could receive an unexpected boost Thursday against the Boston Celtics. Lakers guard Steve Blake was medically cleared and returned to practice Wednesday and will be a game-time decision for the Celtics game after being out of the lineup since Jan. 11 with a costrochaondral fracture, which is the a fracture of the cartilage connecting the rib to the sternum. “I’ve just been patient with it, trying to let it heal,” Blake said. “I really had no preconception of when I was coming back. I didn’t know if it was going to be sooner or later. I really had no idea. To me, it’s on time.”"
