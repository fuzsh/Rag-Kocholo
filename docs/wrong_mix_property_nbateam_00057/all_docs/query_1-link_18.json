        "text": "But sources familiar with Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns “Inside the NBA,” said today that there is “essentially zero chance of the show going anywhere intact” — because, Johnson is reportedly not interested in exiting Turner and, because Barkley, O’Neal and Smith are under long-term contracts. Barkley has said he has an out in his contract if WBD loses the NBA, but those sources indicated that was not necessarily the case and that all the contracts were unique with variables that could prohibit a switch to Amazon, NBC or Disney, the league’s three impending partners after next season.\n\nGene Peterson, the legendary voice of the Rockets for more than three decades as the team’s radio play-by-play announcer, died Wednesday. He was 83. Peterson was moved to home hospice care Tuesday, his son Todd said, following two weeks in the hospital after a fall.\n\nLakers, Magic, Kings among teams interested in Cameron Johnson?\n\nIn what was viewed as a down year — slogging through adductor, ankle, calf, leg and shoulder injuries — Johnson still averaged 13.4 points and 4.3 rebounds in 58 games. He shot 39.1 percent from deep, just off his 39.2 career mark. His size (6-foot-8), age (28) and shooting ability combine to make Johnson valuable. Only 10 NBA players 6-7 or taller averaged more than his 2.4 made 3-pointers last season. While the Kings, Magic and Lakers are interested, one recent report claimed the Spurs, Raptors or Warriors could be a “dark horse.”\n\nMark Bryant is joining the Knicks coaching staff, SNY NBA Insider Ian Begley reported on Wednesday. Begley noted that Bryant, 59, is widely viewed as one of the top big man coaches in the NBA. He joins a Tom Thibodeau coaching staff that has seen a great run of recent success in getting a great deal of output out of less-than-heralded big men, like Isaiah Hartenstein’s emergence last season.\n\nWells Fargo plans to drop its name from the South Philadelphia sports arena, the home of the Flyers and 76ers, after the bank’s contract expires in 2025. “Wells Fargo regularly reviews and adjusts our overall sponsorship strategy,” a Wells Fargo spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday. “As such, we have made the business decision not to renew the naming rights contract to Wells Fargo Center. We value our relationship with Comcast Spectacor and we look forward to collaborating on live entertainment and sporting events at the Wells Fargo Center through the end of our contract in August 2025.”"
