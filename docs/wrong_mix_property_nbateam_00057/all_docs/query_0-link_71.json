        "text": "The Lakers will spend more money on their 2010-11 payroll than any other team in the NBA, possibly topping $95 million as they chase a third consecutive championship. They are well above the league’s salary cap and its luxury tax threshold.\n\nIt’s money well-spent, team owner Jerry Buss insisted Tuesday.\n\n“As of now, I feel like there’s a good chance this could be the best team we’ve ever had,” said Buss, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame last Friday after guiding the Lakers to their 10th title during his ownership and 16th overall in June.\n\n“You sit there and you say, `We really can’t afford this,”‘ he added moments later. “Then somehow the next day we end up spending some more money and getting another player and signing a new (contract) extension.\n\n“At least it has softened my attitude toward women in the mall because I can’t turn down things either.”\n\nBuss said he wouldn’t be signing such large checks if he didn’t believe the Lakers weren’t equipped to make a run at winning their 17th championship this season and tying the Boston Celtics for the most titles in league history.\n\nBuss also said he closely monitored the Lakers’ offseason moves and gave his approval to sign free agents Matt Barnes, Steve Blake and Theo Ratliff. He said it was necessary in order to improve the team while rivals strengthened their rosters.\n\nKeeping up with the hyperactive Miami Heat was not the Lakers’ offseason goal, but it did seem to work out that way in the end.\n\nLike everyone else close to the NBA, Buss was captivated by LeBron James’ decision to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers and sign with the Heat. James has joined Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh to form what Buss believes might be a Finals opponent.\n\n“Suddenly, there’s this juggernaut out there that we have a chance to play against and that excites me,” Buss said a few hours before hosting a charity poker tournament at The Bicycle Casino in Bell Gardens. “Quite honestly, I think we can beat them and I’m looking forward to playing them.”\n\nThe Lakers will play host to James and the Heat on Christmas Day.\n\nBuss said he had mixed feelings about James’ nationally televised decision to sign with the Heat and added, “I kind of decided I wasn’t going to watch, then I did.”\n\n“My feeling was that he let down a lot of people, and it was kind of sad,” Buss said. “On the other hand, it created a juggernaut. I thought, `Oh boy, this is our next big opponent.’ Still, I think Boston is really good and Orlando is still good.”\n\nThe Lakers defeated the Celtics in a grueling seven-game Finals to win their most recent championship one season after beating the Magic rather handily in five games. Buss chuckled when asked about Boston’s signing of former Laker Shaquille O’Neal.\n\n“I like the drama,” he said. “I think it’s fabulous. You can’t help but love Shaq. He’s a very funny man. Sometimes he gets a little carried away in his analysis of former employers. (But) outside of that, he’s quite a guy.”\n\nBuss also seemed to delight in what he called “the little rivalry” between O’Neal and Kobe Bryant, his former teammate. Bryant has won five league championships, one more than O’Neal. They won three in row together to start the 2000s.\n\nBuss admitted he was wary of the Denver Nuggets and Utah Jazz, two Western Conference rivals that have tried and failed to derail the Lakers as they charged to the Finals during the past three seasons.\n\nNo matter what happens this season, Buss said he hoped he could persuade Phil Jackson to continue coaching the Lakers. Jackson said earlier this summer while announcing his return for 2010-11 this would be his last season.\n\n“Hopefully, he’ll go through this season and discover a fountain of youth,” said Buss, who said he hasn’t considered a possible replacement for the Hall of Fame coach.\n\nBuss said his own enshrinement in the Hall of Fame last week has dominated his thoughts in the past few days.\n\n“There were a lot of moments, not a single one,” Buss said. “It’s hard to believe it was 31 years ago when Jerry West and Bill Sharman came to my office for the first time, and seeing Jerry West there (in Springfield, Mass.) started the process all over again.\n\n“It made the little speech very, very real to me. The people I was talking about were right there in front of me. It made the moment very poignant.”"
