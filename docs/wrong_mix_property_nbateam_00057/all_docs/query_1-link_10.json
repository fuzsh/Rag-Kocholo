        "text": "2023\n\nRob Cohen\n\nChairman & CEO, IMA Financial Group & Founder of the Denver Sports Commission\n\nWatch Video\n\nAs Chairman and CEO of the IMA Financial Group, Inc., an integrated financial services company, Robert Cohen is responsible for the company’s core strategic plan, including organic growth, M&A and building an industry-leading employee culture. In 2001, he was the Founder of the Denver Sports Commission, whose purpose was to help bring high-profile sporting events to Denver. The group was also designed to serve as a welcoming host to athletes, families, and fans from around the world. Denver Sports proactively identifies, pursues and attracts new sporting opportunities and helps Denver to compete regionally, nationally and internationally to host amateur and professional athletic competitions and events.\n\nRob strongly believes in personally giving back to the community and has served on more than 20 non-profit boards throughout his career in a variety of leadership capacities. Currently Rob serves on Colorado I Have a Dream Foundation (Co-Founder & Past Chair), Colorado Succeeds, Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce (Past Chair), Denver Sports (Founder & Past Chair), Downtown Denver Partnership (Past Chair), Metro Denver Economic Development Corp. (Past Chair), and the United States Olympic Museum.\n\nHe is also a member of the Board of Directors for the United States Olympic and Paralympic Foundation that serves as the primary source of philanthropic support for Team USA. Founded in 2013, the USOPF generates critical financial resources that help Team USA athletes reach their full potential, both on and off the field of play. Additionally, Rob Cohen is the chair of the Games Hospitality Working Group and in this capacity he travels around the world attending Olympic and Paralympic Games and other related events in an effort to support the Olympic movement and advance its mission. Because of Rob’s commitment to the Olympics, he was recently named a member of the Congressional Commission on the State of the U.S. Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nJennifer Jasinski and Beth Gruitch\n\nOwners Crafted Concepts Restaurant Group\n\nWatch Video\n\nJen has perhaps brought more national attention to Denver fine dining than any other single chef. A James Beard Foundation award-winner for Best Chef Southwest in 2013, and appeared on Top Chef Masters on the Bravo network that same year. Jasinski and her business partner Beth Gruitch opened their first restaurant, Rioja, in Denver’s Historic Larimer Square to critical acclaim in 2004 with a huge media splash -- a 16-page special section in the Rocky Mountain News that chronicled all the work that goes into opening a restaurant. Rioja features a menu inspired by Mediterranean ingredients and influenced by local and seasonal products.\n\nIn 2005, Jasinski and business partner Beth Gruitch bought Bistro Vendôme, the kicky French boîte directly across the street. Their seafood spot, Stoic & Genuine was the first restaurant to open in the beautifully remodeled Denver Union Station in 2014 joined in 2017 by Ultreia showcasing the food of Spain and Portugal. Jen added a consulting chef gig at The Ponti at the Denver Art Museum opening in 2021. The pair have announced the move of Bistro Vendôme to the Park Hill neighborhood in early 2023. Chef Jen was named 2004 Colorado Chef of the Year and 2005 Western Regional Chef of the Year by the American Culinary Federation. Jen has been named Best New Chef, Rising Star, Best Chef and more in Denver Magazine, Restaurant Hospitality, Nation’s Restaurant News, The Denver Post, and 5280 Magazine. Jasinski’s impressive restaurant credits include stints at Wolfgang Puck restaurants including Postrio, San Francisco; Spago, Las Vegas, Malibu; Spago, Chicago; and corporate chef at Wolfgang Puck Food Company.\n\nIt’s difficult to imagine anyone in Denver’s highly competitive restaurant market that does more for the industry and the city than Beth Gruitch. Beth served as board chair and board member of the Colorado Restaurant Association, treasurer and board member of EatDenver and was a recent board member of the Downtown Denver Partnership’s Denver Civic Ventures board. She is responsible for human resources, crafting beverage programs, overseeing banquet sales, banking and guest service and monitoring accounting for four busy and successful restaurants.\n\nShe and Jen were honored as a semifinalists for the national Outstanding Restaurateur award by the James Beard Foundation in 2020 and Beth was named to the Colorado Restaurant Association Hall of Fame in 2022. Perhaps her business partner, Jasinski says it best. “Beth assures that all the best happens for the guests in all our restaurants. She makes sure we hire the best service staff, gives them complete and thorough training and coaches them to perform. She’s the reason people rave about our service.”\n\nGeorge Sparks\n\nPresident & CEO, Denver Museum of Nature and Science\n\nWatch Video\n\nGeorge Sparks is well known for his wonderful leadership at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, where he has turned it into the fourth largest museum in the United States and one of the most respected museums of its kind in the world. In addition to consistently being one of the top tourism attractions in Denver, the museum has gained much national press for the discovery of fossils in Steamboat – one of the largest fossil finds in history.\n\nGeorge has transformed the museum, taking it to new international recognition, and has also been responsible for bringing blockbuster shows to the region. From the museum’s on-site work at paleontological sites such as Steamboat to their work in space, George Sparks has kept the museum relevant and still on the cutting edge in the 21st Century. Prior to the museum, he spent nine years in the Air Force as a pilot and as an assistant professor of aeronautics at the United States Air Force Academy.\n\nHe is a distinguished graduate of the USAF Academy with bachelor’s in aeronautical engineering, and holds a master’s in aeronautics and astronautics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His passion is public policy, particularly around science and education. He is a member of the Colorado Forum, Colorado Concern, and is on the boards of Colorado Education Initiative, Colorado Music Hall of Fame, Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, and the Denver School of Science & Technology. He is the founder of the Institute for Science & Policy, a program of the Museum.\n\nHal O’Leary, Posthumous Award\n\nFounder, National Sports Center for the Disabled\n\nWatch Video\n\nIn 1970, George Engel, the owner of the Winter Park Ski School, asked his 65 employees for a volunteer. Some 23 amputees from the Children’s Hospital would be visiting and they needed a one-time ski lesson. Hal O’Leary raised his hand. He didn’t have any prior experience dealing with children or people with disabilities. When the kids arrived on an especially cold and windy day, he struggled. And he learned. O’Leary transformed that ski lesson into what would become the National Sports Center for the Disabled (NSCD), one of the largest therapeutic recreation and adaptive sports agencies in the world. His journey would revolutionize the skiing industry and bring a new world of movement and hope to people of all disabilities.\n\nHal’s book on adaptive skiing, Bold Tracks, has been translated into numerous languages and is still used to guide instructors on how to teach skiing to those with a myriad of disabilities. He also began to invent his own equipment to adapt to the different needs of his students, creating a cord between skis to help with lateral control, adding skis to walkers and creating sleds for paraplegics. Hal took his teachings around the world, setting up adaptive ski programs in more than 30 countries in Asia, Europe, and South America. He also coached the US Disabled Olympic Team. It is estimated that Hal worked personally with more than 20,000 disabled people before he passed away in June 2021 at the age of 94.\n\nToday in Colorado, the NSCD at Winter Park Resort and in the Denver Metro area offers incredible adaptive outdoor experiences from skiing, hiking and horseback riding to rafting, archery, camping and more. And our Elite Athletes come from around the world to train here and ski competitively at the highest levels of their sport. Through a highly trained staff and hundreds of volunteers, NSCD served nearly 2,000 children and adults with disabilities in 8,000 adaptive outdoor experiences in 2022. For his contributions, Hal O’Leary has been inducted into the Colorado Ski & Snowboard Hall of Fame, the U.S. Ski Hall of Fame and the U.S. Disabled Ski Hall of Fame.\n\n2022\n\nJoe Blake\n\nFormer Chancellor Emeritus, CSU System; former CEO, Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce\n\nWatch Video\n\nA Colorado native, Joe Blake was a vital part of Colorado’s business and education community for more than five decades. He was the President and CEO of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce for nearly a decade during a pivotal time in Denver’s history, helping to bring Major League Baseball to the city and helping to win the election to expand RTD’s transit system in Metro Denver, two events that greatly increased Denver’s appeal as a tourism destination. As Chancellor of the Colorado State University System, he oversaw its three distinct institutions: CSU, CSU-Pueblo and CSU-Global, and worked to help secure a more sustainable funding commitment for higher education in Colorado.\n\nFor nearly 20 years prior to his leadership of the Chamber, Blake was part of the senior management team that created the community of Highlands Ranch, home today for nearly 100,000 residents.\n\nHe was Legislative Assistant to U. S. Senator Gordon Allott (R-Colo.) in Washington. He was also a special agent of the FBI following graduation from law school.\n\nJoe's commitment to Colorado was most apparent in 2005 when he served as co-chair of the statewide Yes on Referendum C and D campaign. Voters passed Referendum C to allow the State of Colorado to retain revenues for higher education, transportation and health care over a five-year period.\n\nHe has served on numerous boards and commissions, including the CSU Board of Governors, Colorado Baseball Commission, Chair of the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority, Chair of the Colorado Transportation Commission, Colorado Concern and Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce.\n\nRecognition for his past civic and community service include induction into the 2017 Colorado Business Hall of Fame, the 2015 Denver Business Journal Legacy Award, the El Pomar Foundation Community Leadership Award, the Boy Scouts Distinguished Eagle Award and the Del Hock Lifetime Achievement Award from the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce.\n\nHe was a Life-time Trustee of the Denver Area Boy Scouts. Joe was a graduate of East High School, Dartmouth College and the University of Colorado, School of Law. For his many contributions that have helped Denver grow as a tourism destination – from professional sports to a world class ground transportation system – Joe Blake is inducted into the Denver & Colorado Tourism Hall of Fame.\n\nSadly, Joe Blake passed away in February 2022, just weeks prior to his induction.\n\nKim Day\n\nFormer CEO, Denver International Airport (DEN)\n\nWatch Video\n\nFormer DEN CEO Kim Day retired in July 2021, after presiding for 13 years over large-scale expansion projects and rapid passenger growth. For more than half of the airport’s history, Day was integral in elevating its international profile. She has also recognized how DEN contributes to Colorado tourism and the economic success of the region and made sure these were factors in decision making.\n\nDay was appointed DEN manager by then-Mayor John Hickenlooper in early 2008. After Mayor Michael B. Hancock’s first election in 2011, he retained Day, calling her “the dynamic leader we needed at a pivotal time.”\n\nShe took over during the Great Recession, but soon she was able to foster the growth and increasing revenue to turn DEN into the nation’s fifth-busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic, prior to the pandemic. During the pandemic, DEN was one of the world’s first major airports to rebound and is currently the 3rd busiest in the world in terms of passenger count.\n\nIn addition to its high rankings and innumerable accolades, DEN is admired throughout the aviation industry. “Kim Day’s impact on Denver International Airport and subsequently on our regional economy, is indelible,” Mayor Michael B. Hancock said. “Kim has been the dynamic leader we needed at a pivotal time of growth and opportunity for our city and state. She is the epitome of selfless leadership, grit and perseverance, an exceptional leader who sets the highest standards for herself and her team, and delivers impactful results with precision, and expert attention to detail. Kim’s dedication to our shared vision of creating a world-class airport is a crowning achievement of her professional career and a lasting legacy for my administration.”\n\nDEN reports that annual passenger traffic has increased from 51 million when Day took over to 69 million in 2019, and the number of international destinations served by DIA increased from 170 to 214. Annual airport revenue grew from $842 million to $1.2 billion. In a statement, Day attributed her decision to step down in part to surviving cancer in recent years. She had planned to retire in 2020, but stayed on to help guide DEN through the many challenges of the pandemic. She said she also felt confident about the stability of several expansion projects underway as part of a $3.5 billion capital program, including the gate expansion program and terminal rebuild.\n\n“Kim Day’s impact on Denver International Airport, and subsequently on our regional economy, is indelible,” Hancock said. “Kim’s dedication to our shared vision of creating a world-class airport is a crowning achievement of her professional career and a lasting legacy for my administration.” For her many contributions to the success of Denver International Airport, Kim Day is inducted in the Denver & Colorado Tourism Hall of Fame.\n\nPasquale “Pocky” Marranzino & Kathy Hagan\n\nCO-CEOs, Karsh Hagan\n\nWatch Video\n\nBoth Hagan and Marranzino have provided strategic leadership, brand development and marketing experience in tourism marketing for Denver and Colorado for a combined eight-plus decades.\n\nMarranzino has been involved in more Denver and Colorado tourism advertising than any other human being. For four decades, he has worked with a wide variety of clients, making him one of the most respected and well-known advertising professionals in the Rocky Mountain Region. Though he has worked on clients such as McDonald’s, INVESCO Funds, and Colorado National Bank, it is for tourism-related clients that he is perhaps best known, including the Colorado Lottery, Colorado Tourism Office, Aspen Snowmass, Best Western International, Deadwood Chamber of Commerce, Frontier Airlines, Loveland Ski Area, Regal Hotels, Steamboat Ski & Resort, and of course, VISIT DENVER. He currently has the distinction of working on both the award-winning Colorado Tourism Office and the VISIT DENVER accounts.\n\nHe was named “Professional of the Year” and honored with a Silver Medal for Outstanding Achievement by the Denver Advertising Federation. For more than 40 years, he has been an instrumental figure in creating Denver and Colorado’s tourism brand, and converting this brand into creative, visual and impactful advertising.\n\nEncouraged to be an entrepreneur by her father, Karsh Hagan founder Tom Hagan, Kathy Hagan launched her first agency at the age of 26. Today, she is co-CEO of Karsh Hagan with Marranzino, running the agency and remaining actively involved in the advertising campaigns for VISIT DENVER, the Colorado Tourism Office and Denver International Airport (DEN).\n\nShe has supported numerous community initiatives and led the Denver Advertising Federation as Chairperson and was also recognized as “Professional of the Year”. Other recognition includes Denver Business Journal and Colorado Business Top Women Owned Company, Colorado Homes and Lifestyles Stylemaker and Karsh Hagan was recognized as Colorado Biz Top Company in 2019. In addition, she currently serves on the Advisory Board for the University of Denver, The Denver Art Museum and is a trustee of the Women’s Foundation of Colorado. As with Marranzino, she has had a swath of clients – from corporations to tourism destinations - including Anschutz Medical Campus, Aspen Snowmass, Colorado Tourism Office, Denver International Airport (DEN), The Governor’s Office of Economic Development, Four Point Energy, University of Colorado, VISIT DENVER, and Volunteers for Outdoor Colorado.\n\nFor their significant contributions to developing Denver’s and Colorado’s tourism brands, Pocky and Kathy are inducted into the Denver & Colorado Tourism Hall of Fame.\n\nReturn To Top\n\n2020\n\nScott Bemis\n\nDirector, Business and Community Partnerships, Plante Moran\n\nWatch Video\n\nScott Bemis served as president and publisher of the Denver Business Journal (DBJ) from 1996 to 2014, retiring after 30 years with American City Business Journals, DBJ’s parent company. It was Bemis who hired popular DBJ editor Neil Westergaard, who passed away in July 2019. Westergaard said of Bemis, “Scott Bemis is the Denver Business Journal. His leadership and personal style led the DBJ through profound changes in the newspaper business. He created an environment in which everyone could do their best work and he truly cared about the people who worked for him.\"\n\nThroughout his career, Bemis recognized the great economic potential tourism could have in Denver and was a strong supporter of the industry. As a community leader, he joined the VISIT DENVER Board of Directors and was made chairman in 2004, a pivotal year for Denver and VISIT DENVER. Bemis oversaw the opening of the first Colorado Convention Center expansion in 2005 and a new direction for VISIT DENVER with the hiring of Richard Scharf as president. He was instrumental in helping achieve the voter-approved 2005 Denver election for more tourism marketing dollars; and he helped win campaigns for the continued funding of SCFD and approving FasTracks, which led to the vital rail connection between downtown Denver and Denver International Airport. After serving as chairman, Bemis has remained active with VISIT DENVER, taking on numerous committee roles during his long tenure on the board. He currently serves as chairman of the Nominating Committee, identifying potential new board members. He also remained active in the 2015 Denver election, which approved funds to further expand the Colorado Convention Center with a new ballroom and other upgrades.\n\nAdditionally, Bemis has spent nearly a decade mentoring a group of 25 young business professionals, and he has served on the boards of the Downtown Denver Partnership, Junior Achievement and the Colorado Women’s Chamber of Commerce. He received an honorary doctorate from Johnson & Wales University and was granted a District Director’s Award from the U.S. Small Business Administration.\n\nIn an effort to further serve the community, Bemis utilizes his professional network and connections to inspire inmates at Federal prisons. By bringing a variety of speakers to the prisons to work with and motivate inmates nearing release, Bemis hopes to contribute to the goals of reducing recidivism and reforming former offenders.\n\nDenver Mayor B. Michael Hancock praised Bemis' ability to build relationships within the community. \"There is no finer human being than Scott Bemis,\" Hancock said. \"I consider him a friend and a confidant. He has set the pace for fair and high-quality journalism that is the model for modern-day reporting.”\n\nBefore coming to Denver, Bemis was publisher of business journals in Indianapolis and Rochester, N.Y., and the Cincinnati Business Courier. He and his wife, Pat, continue to live in the Denver area. Since retiring from publishing, Bemis has served as director of Business and Community Partnerships for Plante Moran, where he has continued his passion for the tourism industry by working with many of tourism’s top businesses.\n\nPatricia Calhoun\n\nEditor, Westword\n\nWatch Video\n\nCalhoun’s friend at the Denver Post, Bill Husted, wrote of her: “Patricia Calhoun is a Denver fixture as durable as the U.S. Mint.” She has been the editor of Westword since she and two friends founded the newspaper in 1977. Westword is a paper dedicated to Denver and to encouraging its citizens to explore the city, and it is consistently ranked as one of the most successful and award-winning alternative weekly newspapers in America.\n\nAs an editor, Calhoun is an ardent supporter of tourism, the arts, the live music scene, dining, breweries, galleries, shopping and every other aspect of Denver. She has appeared as a Denver ambassador on many national news shows, from the Today Show to NPR. Under her direction, Westword has also been a supporter of VISIT DENVER on numerous initiatives, from Denver Restaurant Week to Denver Beer Fest and more. The Westword weekly events calendar provides valuable information for tourists with the information it provides on concerts, art shows, exhibitions, and Denver events (large, small, and offbeat). Westword’s frequent special issues on summer activities and dining are great promotions for Denver, and the publication’s “Best Of” award is a trend-setting, coveted recognition that inspires all Denver businesses to do their best.\n\nThere is little doubt that Patricia Calhoun has had the longest-running news column in Denver history, with 2019 marking her 42nd year of running Westword and writing a column about the city she loves. Quirky, funny, and original, her columns could form an encyclopedia of Denver’s history over the last four decades, all of them done with a sense of humor and with malice toward none.\n\nIn addition to Calhoun’s dedication to spreading the word about Denver’s assets through Westword, her love of Colorado and tourism can be demonstrated by the fact that she and some partners recently bought the Genoa Tower – a historic roadside attraction that dates back to the 1920s, when early automobile tourists could climb the tower 100 miles east of Denver and get their first glimpse of the snowcapped Rocky Mountains. The group plans to restore the tower as a museum and 21st Century roadside attraction for future tourists.\n\nRich Grant\n\nVISIT DENVER, Former Director of Communications\n\nWatch Video\n\nRich Grant likes to compare his career in travel to that of Forrest Gump, the fictional movie character who continually found himself by accident at history-making events. “I may not have had much to do with creating Denver’s history, but I was always in the room,” Grant says. As the public relations director for VISIT DENVER since 1979, Grant found himself attending and promoting every major Denver opening, including the 16th Street Mall, the Denver Performing Arts Complex, the Cherry Creek Shopping Center, the Colorado Convention Center, Denver International Airport, the Pepsi Center (now Ball Arena), Coors Field, Empower Field at Mile High, the Hamilton Building at Denver Art Museum, RTD FasTracks, dozens of new hotels and restaurants and many more tourism businesses. He attended and helped publicize some of the city’s major events including the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Final Four in 1990, Pope John Paul II’s visit in 1993, the first pitch of the Colorado Rockies in 1993, the Summit of the Eight in 1997, and the Democratic National Convention in 2008.\n\nThroughout his career, Grant gained a reputation for coining terms that elevated Denver’s brand and have now become beloved cornerstones of the city’s identity – including the famed “300 Days of Sunshine” and the “Napa Valley of Beer,” among many others. He was also integral in the creation of some of VISIT DENVER’s signature events, including Denver Restaurant Week, Denver Beer Week and Free Night at the Museum’s during Denver Arts Week.\n\nSince retiring, Grant has become a full-time travel writer, his work appearing on many travel websites and print publications and receiving gold, silver and bronze awards from the Society of American Travel Writers, Western Chapter, and the North American Travel Journalists Association. He is the co-author with Irene Rawlings of the travel book, “100 Things to Do in Denver Before You Die,” which is currently in its second edition run.\n\nBefore joining VISIT DENVER, Grant had been a communications manager for Colorado State Parks & Recreation and a freelance writer with works appearing in more than 60 national publications, from National Forests Magazine and Sports Afield to Ranger Rick and Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine\n\nKevin & Denise Taylor\n\nOwner/Chef, Kevin Taylor Restaurant Group\n\nWatch Video\n\nIn 1987, at the age of 25, self-taught chef and Denver native Kevin Taylor opened Zenith American Grill, serving his unique take on southwestern cuisine. Six months after opening, Zenith was among the three top-rated restaurants in Denver. Awards and recognition were garnered from national media, including Bon Appetit, Restaurant Hospitality and GQ. Zenith also earned a prized four-star rating, securing Taylor’s place on the culinary map.\n\nMultiple successful concepts followed over the years, including the eponymous four-star, four-diamond Restaurant Kevin Taylor, Brasserie Z, Prima, Dandelion and many others. Throughout his career, Taylor has been named a “Rising Star” by multiple national media outlets and has been inducted to both the American Culinary Association’s Colorado Chef’s Association and Nation’s Restaurant News Fine Dining Halls of Fame. He’s been a frequent guest chef at the James Beard House, as well as a Cakebread Cellars American Harvest Workshop, Taste of the NFL and more.\n\nIn 1993, Kevin’s one-day wife and business partner, Denise, began at the company in an event sales and management role. She became a financial partner in the business with the opening of the beloved Palettes in the Denver Art Museum in 1997, and they were married several years later. Since then, much of KTRG’s 32 years in business has been spent nourishing the city’s arts patrons – for 20 years at Palettes, and 15 at Kevin Taylor’s at the Ellie Caulkins Opera House.\n\nPerhaps more than any other restauranteurs, the Taylors have welded tourism, the arts and food together. Tens of thousands of Denver visitors have included dining at one of the KTRG’s restaurants as part of their Denver cultural experiences, and with its recent expansion into the wider metro area, now even more diners will have the chance to enjoy the group’s food, with Hickory & Ash and Masa in Broomfield’s Arista Development. The Taylors’ love of food, presentation and culinary mastership has helped to give Denver the reputation it now enjoys as the cultural center of the Rocky Mountain West.\n\nReturn To Top\n\n2019\n\nThe Third Generation of the Legendary Colorado Gart Family\n\nJohn, Ken and Tom Gart of The Gart Companies\n\nWatch Video\n\nIn 1928, Nathan Gart started a fishing and outdoor gear shop in Denver and over the years, with help from his brothers and then his sons, grew it into the Gart Bros. Sporting Goods Company. The firm grew from the original downtown ‘main store’ to a regional chain of over 150 stores. The Gart stores were a skiing and sports institution in the Rocky Mountain Region, with such identifying institutions as the world-famous Sportscastle store, which Jerry Gart opened in 1971 featuring over 100,000 square feet of sporting goods on seven levels.\n\nJerry Gart was a long time board member of VISIT DENVER, the 1978 chairman and a true supporter of tourism. He was among the first people inducted into the Denver & Colorado Tourism Hall of Fame in 1999. ​\n\nThe third Gart generation headed in a new direction, which has been no less important to the travel industry. Following the sale of the business in 1992, Ken, Tom and John Gart founded The Gart Companies. Initially, The Gart Companies had two divisions; Gart Properties, a commercial real estate firm; and Specialty Sports Ventures, a joint venture with Vail Resorts. By 2010, they had grown to more than 150 specialty ski, cycling, golf and fly fishing stores in Colorado, Utah and Northern California before the family sold their interest. At the same time, the company expanded its real estate portfolio, becoming what today is a leading commercial real estate firm with a primary emphasis on retail centers.\n\nThe Gart Companies today is comprised of two primary divisions. Gart Properties currently holds two properties that have been important to downtown Denver, Denver Pavilions and the California Mall, which brought the first urban footprint Target store to downtown. Gart Capital Partners, a private equity business focusing on specialty retail, currently holds investments in GolfTec, Swoozies and Powderhorn Ski Resort.\n\nBut it is their Individual achievements in Denver and Colorado tourism that has them joining their father in the Tourism Hall of Fame. John was a long time board member of VISIT DENVER and was chairman in the pivotal year of 2005, where he worked with then-Mayor John Hickenlooper and the board to place an initiative on the ballot that ultimately resulted in a one-percent increase in the lodger’s tax for tourism marketing. In the ensuing years, this initiative has resulted in tens of millions of dollars for tourism promotion.\n\nAs a family committed to outdoor sports in Colorado and Denver, the Garts have been involved in helping to bring back the new Colorado Classic, which has helped promote Colorado as a cycling destination around the world. The Garts were instrumental in securing the Outdoor Retailer convention in Denver, which constitutes the largest convention booking in the city’s history with a combined total of three meetings bringing 70,000 delegates and $100 million in spending a year for at least five years. Additionally, through Gart Properties, the family has been one of the leaders in the revitalization of downtown Denver as a retail and entertainment destination.\n\nJohn Hickenlooper\n\nFormer Mayor of the City & County of Denver, former Governor of Colorado, co-founder of Colorado’s first brewpub, the Wynkoop Brewing Company\n\nWatch Video\n\nIt is doubtful that any single individual has played as pivotal a role in Denver and Colorado’s tourism industry as John Hickenlooper. In 1988, he opened Colorado’s first brew pub, creating a new industry that has grown to more than 350 craft breweries in the state. John eventually owned eight breweries in Colorado and was instrumental in helping many others get started. As a brewery owner, he continually worked with the press helping to promote Denver as “the Napa Valley of Beer,” establishing the city as the premiere craft beer capital of the nation. If that was all that John Hickenlooper did, that alone would qualify him for the Hall of Fame.\n\nBut of course, he did more, including: serving on the VISIT DENVER board of directors for 12 years, winning two terms as Mayor of the City & County of Denver and two terms as Governor of Colorado. The hospitality industry has never had a stronger supporter in office.\n\nAs Mayor, he helped Denver secure the bid for the 2008 Democratic National Convention and was instrumental in raising the money to host what became the single largest and most important event in the city’s history. He supported VISIT DENVER’s bid for more funding by championing a successful ballot measure in 2005 to secure a 1% increase in the Lodger’s tax, which generated millions of dollars for tourism marketing. He met with dozens of meeting planners and hundreds of journalists to help promote the city, flying to New York City, Washington DC and around the world to help win bids, gain additional international direct flights and generate press coverage. He was also instrumental in Denver obtaining the Clyfford Still Museum, which has become a top city attraction.\n\nAs the Governor of Colorado, he increased funding for the Colorado Tourism Office and helped transform it into one of the nation’s best destination marketing organizations. He helped with countless convention bids, generated media stories, led the successful introduction of legalized marijuana that has become an international model for how it should be done, improved the state’s economy and oversaw one of the largest booms in Colorado’s history with more than 12 years of increased year-over-year tourism growth.\n\nJust recently, he led the effort to secure the Outdoor Retailer convention for Denver, the largest convention booking in Colorado history, which has helped cement Colorado’s reputation as one of the world’s top centers for the manufacture, sales and use of outdoor sporting equipment.\n\nThe Denver and Colorado tourism industry is proud to honor one of our own, a giant in hospitality, craft beer, marketing, government and public service: John Hickenlooper.\n\nMary Motsenbocker\n\nInternational Tourism Marketing (ITM)\n\nWatch Video\n\nToday’s thriving Colorado tourism industry – with its wildly successful international airport, prosperous statewide destinations and renowned international marketing program – is an enduring result not only of the state’s natural beauty and resources, but also of a small group of people who advocated for the state’s tourism industry and kept its tourism marketing efforts alive. Mary Mostenbocker was one of those people.\n\nMary got her start in the industry as a marketing and sales person for Purgatory Ski Resort, and Crested Butte Mountain Resort, where she helped develop the American Rockies campaign with United and United Express, resulting in more than 10,000 international visitors coming to Colorado. This success resulted in her working for four productive years in the international tourism department of the Colorado Tourism Board (CTB).\n\nWhen Colorado voters ended the CTB in 1992, international promotions came to a halt. So Mary formed her own company the next year, International Tourism Marketing (ITB), which through co-op programs and private dollars was able to keep Colorado’s presence at international tradeshows and marketing events. She then helped create the Colorado International Marketing Organization (CIMO), which with support from Denver International Airport, was able to develop marketing programs with Lufthansa, British Airlines, Korean Airlines, United and others to keep Colorado’s image alive overseas.\n\nITM also created a tradeshow called Go West Summit, which brings together international travel trade representatives with Colorado products such as attractions, shopping and events, which has ultimately brought hundreds of thousands of tourists to Colorado from Asia, Europe, South America and Mexico, generating millions of dollars for the state.\n\nFor all that Mary Motsenbocker has done for decades to promote Colorado as an international destination, she is inducted into the Denver and Colorado Tourism Hall of Fame.\n\nEnos Mills, Posthumous Award\n\nRocky Mountain National Park\n\nWatch Video\n\nEnos Mills was the “father” of Rocky Mountain National Park, the man most responsible for fighting for the preservation of the area and its establishment as a national park in 1915. As a homesteader and guide in the area, he climbed Longs Peak more than 340 times. His hotel and restaurant, the Longs Peak Inn in Estes Park, was called by famed travel writer Lowell Thomas, the best hotel in Colorado along with the Brown Palace and the Broadmoor.\n\nEnos endlessly lobbied Congress, lectured around the country, wrote articles for Sunset, the Saturday Evening Post, Cosmopolitan and others, and with the help of John Muir, the Sierra Club and his friend F.O. Stanley (who built the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park) he was able to convince Washington to preserve the area for future generations. Today, Rocky Mountain National Park is the most popular attraction in Colorado and the fifth most popular national park in the U.S., attracting nearly four million visitors a year. It is difficult to imagine how different the area might be today if Mills had not fought for and succeeded in preserving these 412 square miles of Rocky Mountain beauty.\n\nAs a young boy in Kansas, Enos was a sickly youth. He was not expected to live past 14. But he was determined, so he convinced his parents to let him walk to Colorado where the better air might help him. He got a job in Estes Park, improved significantly and made his first climb up Longs Peak. That changed his life and he devoted everything going forward to the outdoors. In 1885, he built a log cabin in the shadow of Longs Peak that still exists and is today a museum, run by his descendants.\n\nBy the time Enos was 35, he said he “had lit a campfire in every state in the Union” and hiked all over the world. In California, walking on a beach, he met a kindly old man with a beard and they developed a lifelong friendship. That man was John Muir, who took Enos under his wing and encouraged him to fight for conservation. Ironically, while John Muir is well known and honored today, Enos Mills has been almost forgotten. Mills Lake in Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the few landmarks named for him. But as Rocky Mountain National Park has celebrated more than 100 years of conservation, it is fitting to remember the man who did so much to preserve it.\n\nReturn To Top\n\n2018\n\nStephen Bartolin, Jr.\n\nChairman, The Broadmoor\n\nWatch Video\n\nStephen Bartolin, Jr. has had a legendary career at The Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, where he served as president and CEO for 24 years, making him the longest serving president in The Broadmoor’s history. Starting there in 1991, after stints at the Greenbrier and the Opryland Hotel in Nashville, Bartolin became the driving force behind The Broadmoor’s success and acclaim. During his reign, Bartolin oversaw a $450 million expansion, upgrade and restoration project that allowed the property to keep the Five Star rating they were at risk of losing. Today, The Broadmoor is the longest running Five Star and Five Diamond rated property in North America and is one of the greatest icons in Colorado’s hospitality business.\n\nIn March 2015, he was named Chairman of The Broadmoor and its related businesses. He also serves as President of The Broadmoor-Sea Island Company. Bartolin was named 1997 Resort Executive of the Year, was recognized as the 2005 Colorado Hotelier of the Year, named Independent Hotelier of the Year by Hotels Magazine in 2010, and was named the 2013 CEO of the Year by Colorado Business Magazine.\n\nThe Broadmoor’s other tourism related businesses include The Manitou and Pikes Peak Railway, Seven Falls, Cloud Camp, The Ranch at Emerald Valley, The Broadmoor Fly Fishing Camp and The Broadmoor Soaring Adventure.\n\nCharlie Brown\n\nDenver Councilman\n\nWatch Video\n\nKnown as the “cowboy councilman,” Charlie Brown was first elected to the Denver City Council in May 2001 until he was tenured out of office in July 2015. Decked out in his signature western shirts, hat and bolo tie, Charlie Brown brought a moderate, business-oriented, common sense perspective to the 13-member council. As a voice for fiscal moderation, Councilman Brown worked hard to ensure that Denver continued to be a great place to live, work and raise a family – and welcome tourists. Charlie represented the Council on the VISIT DENVER Board of Directors for 14 years.\n\nHe was a strong backer of the Colorado Convention Center, the expansion of the center and the 2015 ballot initiative 2C, which increased funding for tourism marketing. Throughout his tenure, he was the voice for tourism on the Denver City Council, with a near perfect attendance at all VISIT DENVER functions. Not one to mince words, he gave up on “political correctness” early in his career, favoring “political directness.” Representing Denver, he appeared on national news shows, including The O’Reilly Factor, ABC’s World News Sunday, NBC Nightly News, CBS Evening News and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and was quoted in The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, Forbes and many international publications.\n\nCharlie’s diverse background includes serving as president of an award-winning public relations firm, chief lobbyist for a statewide medical society, assistant public affairs director for an international trade union, a teacher at the secondary and college levels, and Realtor. A graduate of the University of Wyoming, he was named their 2014 Outstanding Alumnus in the college of Arts and Science.\n\nCharlie has been married for 35 years to Suzanne Brown, former features editor at The Denver Post. They have two grown children living in Brooklyn and Denver. Together, Charlie and Suzanne are one of the most distinguished couples in Denver, championing hundreds of projects and events to help make Denver a world class tourism destination.\n\nGary Defrange\n\nWinter Park Ski Resort\n\nWatch Video\n\nGary DeFrange was only the third resort president at Winter Park since 1939, but in his 20 years of running it, he transformed Winter Park into one of Colorado’s major destination ski resorts. He was Chairman, President, and CEO of First Interstate Bank of Denver and Area President for a three-state region for First Interstate Bank when he was guiding blind skiers for the National Sports Center for the Disabled in Winter Park. But his banking career ended when the late Jerry Groswold (a member of the Denver & Colorado Tourism Hall of Fame) retired from running Winter Park Resort in 1997, and Gary took over.\n\nAt first, finding money for capital investment was very difficult, as was cash flow, but DeFrange and his team came up with Colorado’s first low-priced Season Pass, “The Friends and Family 4-Pack,” which they began selling before the season ended to help cash flow through the summer months. He also worked with a team of people appointed by Mayor Wellington Webb to renegotiate the operating contract between the City of Denver and the Winter Park Recreational Association to benefit all parties. This contractual change allowed DeFrange to work with representatives from the City of Denver and Intrawest, one of the largest ski resort developers in the world, to create a Lease and Operating Agreement that would provide a minimum of $2 million each year to the City of Denver, pump an initial $50 million of capital improvements into the ski area for on-mountain and skier services, and allow Intrawest to build a Village at the base of Winter Park Resort. New high-speed lifts were added, such as the six-passenger Super Gauge and the Panoramic Express, increasing uphill capacity to 38,000 skiers an hour, and the resort today has over 500 lodging units and over 47,000 square feet of retail shopping and restaurant space at the base of the mountain.\n\nBut perhaps his most well-known success was in building a coalition between several partners and political allies to bring back the train from Denver’s Union Station to Winter Park Resort. The original beloved train to Winter Park ended in 2009, but today the now named Winter Park Express is transporting over 500 skiers to Winter Park on weekends and some Fridays. This service now makes Winter Park the only resort in North America where it is possible to take a train from a world class international airport to downtown, and then take a train to a world class ski resort.\n\nFor his 20 years of service transforming Winter Park to one of the largest ski resorts in Colorado, for securing financial success from the resort for the City of Denver, and for reviving the Winter Park Express, Gary DeFrange is worthy of entering the Denver and Colorado Tourism Hall of Fame.\n\nBarney Ford, Posthumous Award\n\nHotelier and Restauranteur\n\nWatch Video\n\nBarney Ford has one of the most remarkable stories of anyone who has ever been in Colorado’s hospitality industry. He was born a slave in Virginia in 1822. Although it was illegal at the time, his mother taught him how to read and write. When he was “loaned” out by his master to work on a steamboat as a cook and porter, he saw his opportunity. When the steamboat was docked in Illinois, a free state, he was able with the help of the Underground Railroad, to literally step off the boat and escape.\n\nThen began a series of adventures that would fill several novels. He went to Nicaragua, crossed the West, and panned for gold in the California Gold Rush of 1849. But it was in the Colorado gold rush of 1859 that he achieved fame and fortune.\n\nThe laws of the day did not allow Black men to file mine claims. Barney found and worked a gold mine with white partners, but they cheated him and stole the mine. It was then he discovered the one area in the West at the time where he could work freely and where there was no color barrier -- the hospitality industry. Barney went back to his previous skills and opened a hotel and restaurant -- the Inter-Ocean Hotel at 16th and Blake in Denver. Within a short time, he was one of the richest people in the new mining town of Denver.\n\nBarney always said that people “appreciate good quality food and accommodations, but they pay for service.” His philosophy paid off. He became one of the most famous restauranteurs in the West, opening restaurants in Cheyenne, Denver and other locations that were all known for their consistency and quality, but most of all for their service.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the hotels or restaurants survive. Most of them burned down in fires or are long forgotten. However, Barney and his wife built a gorgeous home on Main Street in Breckenridge, and the house is open today as the Barney Ford Museum. The museum does an excellent job of telling the story of Barney Ford, and how, because there was no color barrier in the hospitality industry in the West, he was able to amass a fortune by providing something that was in short supply – quality food, outstanding accommodations and excellent service. Barney Ford died in 1902. There is a stained glass portrait of him in the Colorado State Capitol.\n\nReturn To Top\n\n2017\n\nJoe Ellis\n\nPresident & CEO, Denver Broncos\n\nWatch Video\n\nIt would be impossible to overestimate the economic and publicity value of the Denver Broncos to Denver’s tourism industry. The Broncos are the first thing mentioned in tourism word association tests about Denver and in 2014 were recognized by a Harris poll as “America’s Team”—the most popular football team in the U.S. More than 1.4 million fans watched the Broncos play in person in 2016, while hundreds of millions of people around the world watch them every season, exposing them to tourism images of Denver and Colorado. The publicity from the Super Bowl 50 victory alone was valued at $190 billion from the more than 108,000 stories told around the world. In 2016, Joe began his sixth season as president of the Denver Broncos and his third year as chief executive officer. Having worked with Owner Pat Bowlen for nearly three decades, Joe has been entrusted to operate the team with full authority while serving as the Broncos’ representation for all league matters. Joe owns extensive experience and expertise at both the club and league level through his 22 seasons with the Broncos and 29 seasons in the NFL. Joe’s leadership skills and business knowledge have helped the Broncos strengthen their reputation as one of the most successful and fan-friendly franchises in all of professional sports. He has earned significant recognition from his peers and throughout the Rocky Mountain Region for the Broncos’ emphasis on community involvement and civic responsibility. For his work in making the Denver Broncos a symbol of the city and a professional organization that gladly works with the tourism industry to promote the Mile High City, Joe Ellis is inducted into the Denver & Colorado Tourism Hall of Fame.\n\nHolly Arnold Kinney\n\nOwner of the Fort Restaurant and Founder of Tesoro Foundation\n\nWatch Video\n\nHolly Arnold Kinney literally grew up in one of metro Denver’s most famous tourism icons, The Fort restaurant. The Fort, a replica of Bent’s Old Fort on the Santa Fe Trail, was built by Holly’s father, Sam Arnold, as a private home in 1963, but turned it into a restaurant specializing in authentic foods of the mountain men era in the Southwest. Holly grew up in an apartment in the upstairs portion of the restaurant, with Sam Arnold’s bear, “Sissy,” as a pet. After a career in advertising and marketing, Holly formed a partnership with her father to manage the restaurant in 1999, and took over full ownership of The Fort restaurant in 2006, after her father passed away. Holly has not only kept the Western traditions of The Fort going, but she has expanded on them. In 1999, she started the Tesoro Culture Center, a non-profit committed to protecting and making available to the public the artistic treasures and history of the Southwest. They have group and school tours teaching Bent’s Fort history, historic lecture series, and many events such as the Indian Market Powwow that attracted the nation’s top Indian artists. In the fall, a Mountain Man Rendezvous that preserves Colorado history with artists, demonstrations, and music. New in 2017 Tesoro is opening The Fort from 11am-3pm during weekends for their new Living History Experience from June 1-Oct. 15 featuring artists, Indian dancing, demonstrations and music of the early West. For her lifetime of work in promoting the history, culture, traditions and cuisine of the Southwest through the Tesoro Center and The Fort restaurant, Holly Arnold Kinney is inducted into the Denver & Colorado Tourism Hall of Fame.\n\nRoy Romer\n\nFormer Governor of Colorado\n\nWatch Video\n\nRoy Romer was the 39th Governor of Colorado and the last governor to serve three terms. The former owner of a ski area, he was governor during a pivotal time for Denver and played a key role in the decision to build Denver International Airport (DIA). Perhaps no single event has been more important to Denver’s tourism industry than the decision to build DIA, and it is impossible to imagine that happening without the support of Governor Romer, and the work he did in lobbying for statewide support for the project. He was a strong supporter of tourism and under his reign the Colorado Tourism Board (CTB) became a model for the entire country. When the CTB was eliminated due to the TABOR being passed, Governor Romer worked to get at least some funds to keep information centers open. He also lobbied the state legislature to supply $125 million to purchase the land for the Colorado Convention Center. Without that support, the center never could have been built in downtown Denver. Because of his support of the two biggest tourism projects of the 20th Century, the building of DIA and the construction of the Colorado Convention Center, former Colorado Governor Roy Romer is being inducted into the Denver & Colorado Tourism Hall of Fame.\n\nWilliam F. “Buffalo Bill” Cody\n\nWatch Video\n\nCol. William F. Cody was the world’s first superstar and the man who made the American West one of the world’s great tourism destinations. The romantic images and stories of the West that he created have endured for more than a century and are still an important factor in why people visit Denver and Colorado. Today it is difficult to imagine Buffalo Bill’s popularity. From 1883 to 1913, he and his show, “Buffalo Bill’s Wild West,” toured the globe, bringing the thrill of the American West to a thousand cities in a dozen different nations. At its height, the show played before the crowned heads of Europe, crisscrossed America in a special train of 52 box cars, and employed more than 640 cowboys, Indians, vaqueros, rough riders, and support personnel. As a comparison, Beyonce’s world tour in 2016 employed less than 100 people. In 2017, it will be 100 years since Buffalo Bill died in Denver and was laid in-state in the Colorado State Capitol. At his request, he was buried on top of nearby Lookout Mountain, which offered views of the plains and the Rocky Mountains. More than 25,000 people attended his funeral – the largest in Colorado history with a progression of cars that stretched from downtown Denver, up the Lariat Loop Trail to his gravesite at the top of the mountain. His grave and a museum honoring him have been ranked as one of the top 10 paid attractions in Denver for more than 20 years. For all that he did in promoting the romance, adventure and beauty of the American West and for being the “star” of one of Denver’s most popular and long-lasting tourism attractions, Buffalo Bill is inducted into the Denver & Colorado Tourism Hall of Fame.\n\nReturn To Top\n\n2016\n\nLannie Garrett\n\nWatch Video\n\nLannie Garrett is a Denver institution with that rare combination of popular and critical appeal. In addition to being named Denver’s “Favorite Female Vocalist” repeatedly by her fans, she has garnered that same title with the readers of 5280 Magazine and Outfront. Lannie has headlined at Boettcher Concert Hall and Red Rocks Amphitheater with the Colorado Symphony Orchestra, acted in a campy, “B” movie opposite movie star, Anthony Perkins and has worked with a diverse group of national entertainers, including BB King, Ray Charles and Roseanne. Her music is played on stations across the country. Her eclectic collection of shows run the gamut from classy and jazzy to naughty and bawdy. She can change her onstage feathers easily becoming the glamorous chanteuse fronting her 10 piece big band, “Any Swing Goes,” or becoming the self-deprecating clown in her hilarious country comedy spoof, “The Patsy DeCline Show.” She has been selling out shows for over 3 decades. In 2006, Lannie and actor, Jefferson Arca, teamed up to open a nightclub bearing her name. This gorgeous, intimate showroom, Lannie’s Clocktower Cabaret, is located in the heart of downtown Denver, under the D&F Tower, and features her many shows, as well as national acts and the best in Colorado entertainment. For a decade, it has been a popular downtown venue for tourists and locals alike. For being a longtime fixture in Denver’s entertainment scene and for adding to Denver’s downtown nightlife for a decade, Lannie Garrett is inducted into the Tourism Hall of Fame.\n\nJerry Mcmorris\n\nWatch Video\n\nFew people in Colorado’s history have been so strongly associated with not one, but two huge tourism attractions, as was Jerry McMorris, who played pivotal roles with both the Colorado Rockies and the National Western Stock Show & Rodeo. McMorris graduated from the University of Colorado, School of Business in 1962 and while still attending college started his first transportation company, which grew over 40 years into the $400 million trucking giant, NationsWay Transport, serving all of North America. In 1993, McMorris and the Colorado Rockies ownership group brought Major League Baseball to the Rocky Mountain Region for the first time. For 12 years, he served as Chairman, President & CEO of the team as it broke every attendance record in Major League Baseball (MLB) history, drawing the all-time-record 4,483,350 fans to Sports Authority Field at Mile High (now Empower Field at Mile High) during their inaugural season. He sold his interest in the Colorado Rockies in 2006. While in MLB, he served as a member of the Executive Council, Finance and Compensation Committee and Chaired MLB’s Legislative Committee. From 1990 until his death in 2012, he was heavily involved with the National Western Stock Show, serving as a member of the executive committee, treasurer and vice chairman before becoming chair in 2006. In 2009, he was inducted into the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame. For his leadership in bringing the Colorado Rockies to Denver, his guidance over the team in its early years, and his many contributions to the National Western Stock Show, Jerry McMorris is remembered as a member of the Denver & Colorado Tourism Hall of Fame. Posthumous Award\n\nChuck Morris\n\nWatch Video\n\nChuck has been a driving force in the Colorado music community for over 45 years. After moving to Boulder from New York City in 1965 to pursue a doctorate in Political Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Chuck built the legendary Tulagi nightclub in Boulder (1970-1973), which included first tours by artists such as the Doobie Brothers, Bonnie Raitt, the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, ZZ Top, and many others. Following Tulagi’s, he co-owned and managed the equally famous Ebbets Field nightclub in Denver (1974-1978) which also brought in early tours from such varied acts as Lynyrd Skynyrd, Steve Martin, Dan Fogelberg, Carole King, Richard Pryor and more. Ebbets Field was Billboard Magazine’s “Club of the Year” in 1975 and 1976. After Ebbets Field, Chuck worked with the late Denver music promoter Barry Fey (another Tourism Hall of Fame winner in 2013) as Sr. Vice President of Feyline Presents. After leaving Feyline Presents, Chuck started his own management company, Chuck Morris Entertainment, managing the careers of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Lyle Lovett, Highway 101 and Leo Kottke among others. Chuck later went on to form Bill Graham Presents/Chuck Morris Presents which subsequently continued to run as Live Nation. Chuck then moved on in 2006 to be President and CEO of AEG Live Rocky Mountains and the Northwest. During these many decades, Chuck was responsible for building the Fillmore Auditorium, developing the 1STBANK Center, putting together the Mile High Music Festival and the re-development and takeover of the Fiddlers Green Amphitheatre.

While a State Representative and a State Senator, Al White championed tourism’s economic strength as a valuable component of Colorado’s economic well-being. As a member of the Joint Budget Committee, he worked diligently to protect the tourism office’s budget. From 2011 to 2015, he directed the Colorado Tourism Office, helping to achieve a new record-breaking tourism year every year he served as director. Al White put together a team of professionals that raised the Colorado Tourism Office to new levels, while overseeing award-winning marketing and advertising campaigns that helped establish Colorado’s tourism brand around the world. In 2014, 71.3 million visitors spent $18.6 billion in the state, an all-time high, supporting 155,000 jobs. These visitors contributed $1.1 billion in state and local taxes. Without tourism, the average household would have to pay $538 a year more in taxes. No figure in the 21st Century has been more associated with Colorado tourism than Al White, who retired from the Colorado Tourism Office in September 2015. For his work in supporting tourism funding in Colorado and promoting Colorado’s brand around the world, Al White is being inducted into the Tourism Hall of Fame.\n\nReturn To Top\n\n2015\n\nBill Daniels, Posthumous Award\n\nWatch Video\n\nBill Daniels was a born entrepreneur and is widely considered one of the great business visionaries of the twentieth century. His brilliance in business was matched by his sincere compassion for people and his desire to help those in need. Bill began his business career by opening an insurance agency in Casper, Wyoming. On a drive home after visiting family in New Mexico, Bill stopped for lunch in Denver. A boxing match flickered on a small black and white screen behind the bar. It was Bill’s first encounter with television, and he was captivated. He learned that many small towns — including Casper — did not have access to TV. As a result, Bill started building Casper’s first cable system in 1952. As one of the earliest pioneers in cable TV, Bill owned and operated hundreds of systems across the country. The firm he founded, Daniels & Associates, operated these properties and brokered many of the deals that shaped the industry. Bill’s leadership attracted many technology and communications companies to the area, making Denver the recognized “cable capital of the world.” An avid sports fan, Bill was one of the first in his industry to focus on generating sports programming, clearing the way for today’s regional sports networks. He sponsored a number of professional boxers, served as president of the American Basketball Association, was a founder of the United States Football League, and was an owner of professional sports teams, including the Utah Stars and the Los Angeles Lakers. He played a significant behind-the-scenes role in bringing teams and stadiums to Denver. During the course of his life, the respect Bill earned for his achievements in business was matched by the admiration generated by his philanthropy. With his plane, he set a new round-the-world speed record for business jets while raising $300,000 for education. He opened his home, Cableland, to fundraising events for nonprofits dozens of times per year, and donated the house to the City of Denver as the official mayoral residence. Bill provided significant support to innovative education efforts. He collaborated with the University of Denver to incorporate ethics, values, and personal integrity into the business school curriculum. In 1994, the school was renamed Daniels College of Business in Bill’s honor. The Daniels Fund continues Bill Daniels’ legacy of compassion and generosity by providing grants to outstanding nonprofit organizations, and scholarships to deserving students, in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.\n\nJeff Hermanson\n\nWatch Video\n\nFor his long history of supporting historic preservation mixed with a re-energizing of Denver’s retail, restaurant and entertainment scene, Jeff Hermanson, chief executive officer of Larimer Associates is inducted into the Denver & Colorado Tourism Hall of Fame. Jeff founded Larimer Associates in 1987 and in 1993, Jeff purchased Larimer Square, the firm’s most high-profile property. The 220,000-square-foot office and retail property is a full city-block of downtown Denver and encompasses the largest assemblage of National Historic Registered buildings in Colorado. With Jeff’s leadership, the property has been re-positioned over the past 15 years to include one of the best collections of independently-owned fashion boutiques and chef-owned and operated restaurants in the state, perhaps the country, and consistently ranks as one of Denver’s top attractions for both visitors and Denver residents. Additionally, Jeff has partnered with a number of Denver’s notable chefs and restaurateurs to create some of the city’s most acclaimed restaurants, including Rioja, Bistro Vendôme, Corridor 44 and TAG. Recently, Jeff opened a number of award-winning neighborhood restaurants in Denver, including Billy’s Inn, LoHi SteakBar, Ernie’s Bar & Pizza, and the Lowry Beer Garden. And most recently, Jeff was a principal partner in the restoration of Denver Union Station. Larimer Square and Denver Union Station are Denver’s most iconic attractions. Jeff’s philanthropic and social responsibility efforts are principally focused on hunger awareness and land conservation. He was recently named to the Board of Directors for We Don’t Waste, and Jeff has been a board member and served as the President of the Crested Butte Land Trust in addition to serving on the board of the Downtown Denver Partnership. Hermanson is also the founder of the Crested Butte Wine and Food Festival which benefits the Crested Butte Center for the Arts.\n\nKay Rogness\n\nWatch Video\n\nThe Colorado Crossroads National Qualifier is America's third-largest indoor volleyball tournament with 1,285 girls’ volleyball teams playing annually over two weekends in late February or early March, a traditionally slow time for hotels and restaurants. The event has been coming to downtown Denver since 1996, bringing as many as 45,000 people each time, creating an economic impact as high as $25 million per tournament. Hotels are sold out, restaurants have to put on extra staff to deal with volumes higher than experienced during the Democratic National Convention, and shops from the 16th Street Mall to Cherry Creek are swamped with thousands of young shoppers. Since 1996, Kay Rogness has been the tournament executive director and driving force behind this event. Because the teams come from all over the country (30 different states were represented in 2014), this is the first time many of the players and accompanying coaches, family and friends have been to Denver. Over the years, hundreds of thousands of young girls playing in the tournament in Denver have developed a love for the city, returning over and over again as tourists and tournament participants. Considering the immediate economic benefit, the longevity of the event, and the residual tourism it has generated for decades, this is one of the largest and most economically significant conventions that Denver hosts. For these contributions, Kay Rogness is inducted into the Denver & Colorado Tourism Hall of Fame.\n\nNavin Dimond\n\nWatch Video\n\nNavin Dimond is the founder of Stonebridge Companies, one of the nation’s leading hotel development and management companies, and serves as President and Chief Executive Officer, overseeing the company’s development, operations and investment functions. In June 2014, Navin and his wife Rita donated $1.5 million to Metropolitan State University of Denver, the largest contribution MSU has ever received. A significant portion of the gift will create the Dimond Fellowship Program, funding 10 student-fellows each year who are preparing for careers in the hospitality industry. In return for the gift, MSU named their hotel management program after the Dimonds. The Rita and Navin Dimond Hotel Management Program at MSU Denver's Hospitality Learning Center is the first of its kind in the Rocky Mountain West. It includes a 150-room SpringHill Suites by Marriott hotel; a 28,000-square-foot hospitality learning center and a 5,000-square-foot conference center. In addition to this wonderful gift, Navin Dimond has a long history of adding to Denver’s hotel inventory, capped by the opening in the summer of 2014 of the Renaissance Denver Downtown City Center, a 230-room hotel built in the lovingly preserved 1915 Colorado National Bank Building. The project not only saved the building, but also preserved 16 murals from the iconic western muralist Allen Tupper True. The hotel showcases historic elements from the building’s original construction in the early 20th century, juxtaposed with the accommodations, amenities and comforts of a modern luxury hotel. For these contributions, Navin Dimond is inducted into the Denver & Colorado Tourism Hall of Fame.\n\nReturn To Top\n\n2014\n\nLarry DiPasquale\n\nWatch Video\n\nIn the mid 1980s, after working in the Denver area for several years, the young, driven Larry DiPasquale took a major risk by launching Epicurean Group, an endeavor that promised little besides long hours and hard work. But his vision for the future, his fearless desire to change the way catering had been done in the past, and his long list of goals, including creating a better product for clients and a better work environment for employees, resulted in a dynamic and multi-faceted organization. Epicurean Group now acts as the premium concessionaire at Sports Authority Field at Mile High (now Empower Field at Mile High), exclusive event coordinator/caterer for The Denver Center for the Performing Arts, restaurateur/coordinator/caterer for Palazzo Verdi/Mangia Bevi, and is the preferred caterer at venues across the Front Range including properties in outlying mountain towns. Epicurean has fed thousands at The 2008 Democratic National Convention, Pope John Paul II, Julia Child, Oprah Winfrey and every president since the original George Bush, a list few in the industry can claim. DiPasquale still considers the nod from the White House in 1988 to coordinate and cater the prestigious Summit of the Eight, as well as being selected to oversee the inaugural international event, as a major career highlight. Epicurean Group, today the largest off-premise catering operation in the state of Colorado, employs more than 300 food service professionals who embrace DiPasqaule’s goals and who understand the importance of exceeding client expectations. DiPasquale's keen business sense, and his desire to empower those who work under his leadership, has resulted in a team he trusts to carry forth the vision he has for Epicurean. He has been recognized with numerous awards and accolades, including Small Business of the Year, Business Owner/Operator of the Year, Colorado Meetings & Events Lifetime Hall of Fame, Colorado Italian American Hall of Fame and the first caterer to be inducted into the Colorado Restaurant Hall of Fame. Epicurean Group is Denver’s only caterer to be registered “Colorado Proud” by the State Department of Agriculture and they meet all of the EPA requirements for green events. In addition to his significant business pursuits, Larry and his wife, Jill, are devoted to giving back to the community. In 2005, the DiPasquales and their business partner, Sharon Magness Blake, formed Epicurean Compassion to oversee and promote the company's charitable endeavors leading with The LRD Foundation, an education trust created to provide financial support to hospitality and culinary students. DiPasquale is intimately involved with We Don’t Waste, providing more than 100,000 meals to homeless since 2011. And in addition to his 20-plus years of supporting Volunteers of America, DiPasquale now volunteers the Epicurean Food Truck twice a month to feed Denver’s hungry and homeless. Larry DiPasquale credits his success to his own entrepreneurial spirit, a tool which has helped him recognize that same drive in others. He is adamant about filling Epicurean’s venues, offices, and kitchens with passionate team members who continually embody and display Epicurean Group’s five core values: Amazing Food, Stellar Service, Nurturing Community & Relationships, Always Going Above & Beyond, and Passion for our Clients. For his more than 30 years of excellence in providing Colorado catering, serving as a role model, and giving back to his community, Larry DiPasquale is honored as an inductee into Visit Denver’s Tourism Hall of Fame and celebrates his co-honorees.\n\nGrace Gillette\n\nWatch Video\n\nGrace Gillette has been in charge of staging the Denver March Powwow, one of the country's largest Native American cultural events, for 30 years, more than half of its existence.

Fey also played an important role in helping to save the Denver Symphony and to create the new Colorado Symphony Orchestra. In 1967, at just 27 years old, he began his extraordinary career as one of rock’s most important promoters by booking Big Brother & The Holding Company, featuring lead singer Janis Joplin into Denver’s Family Dog Concert Hall. His company, Feyline, transformed the \"Summer of Stars\" concert series at Red Rocks into a top \"bucket list\" event for music lovers all over the world.

Under his leadership, the DAM was totally transformed to become the most important art center in the Rocky Mountain West and one of the principal art museums in America. During his tenure, the DAM drew approximately 500,000 visitors each year and was touted by USA Today as one of the \"10 Great Places to Introduce Children to Art.\" Dr. Sharp substantially increased the museum's collections and improved the educational activities. One of his continuing legacies has been the museum's increased focus on major touring exhibitions such as \"Toulouse-Lautrec from the Metropolitan Museum of Art,\" \"Impressionism: Paintings Collected by European Museums,\" and the blockbuster, \"El Greco to Picasso from the The Phillips Collection.\" Sharp also had a tremendous influence on shaping the national and international image of Denver through his leadership on the Daniel Libeskind designed Frederic C. Hamilton Building, which elevated Denver's reputation as a cultural destination. The expansion was completed through a city bond initiative approved by Denver voters in 1999, while the museum raised another $28 million in private funds to cover additional expansion projects. Dr. Sharp was instrumental in both helping pass the initiative and in raising the private funds. He also helped lift the museum's stature through a landmark donation of funding, artwork and property from Kent and Vicki Logan, the largest planned gift in the Museum's history. Lewis Sharp retired at the end of 2009, but his legacy and contributions live on at the Denver Art Museum with recent blockbuster exhibits such as \"Yves St. Laurent: The Retrospective\" and \"Becoming Van Gogh.\"\n\nSid Wilson\n\nWatch Video\n\nSid Wilson has operated A Private Guide for 20 years, becoming one of the best known and most beloved guides and entrepreneurs in Denver's tourism industry.

Beckwourth Mountain Club), the Black American West Museum, and the Plains Conservation Center. Wilson's contributions often take place behind the scenes, where he has worked for years to bring new people into the travel industry. He is a senior instructor at the International Guide Academy and has worked in numerous school projects with student groups, where he has long been a proponent of kids working in travel and tourism.

For over ten years he has worked with Beckwourth Outdoors, preparing and exposing inner-city youth to their first skiing, hiking and a variety of mountain based recreation activities. Research had shown that many youth who get into trouble with authorities have never been to the mountains. Beckwourth Outdoors was created to right that situation, and Sid has literally changed the lives of hundreds of youths by introducing them to Colorado tourism and mountain experiences. As he has stated, Wilson has been able to take experiences and contacts from powerful boards like VISIT DENVER, the Denver Zoo and the Denver Public Library Commission, and use that knowledge to help other smaller boards like the Black American West Museum, Beckwourth Outdoors and the Plains Conservation Center.\n\nReturn To Top\n\n2012\n\nJohn Denver\n\nWatch Video\n\nOne of the world's best-known and most-loved performers, John Denver earned international acclaim as a songwriter, performer, actor, environmentalist and humanitarian.

Charlie Papazian deserves much of the credit for creating the craft beer industry in America – and in Colorado, where it has become an important brand pillar of the tourism industry, exemplified by the fact that the readers of Travel + Leisure Magazine just ranked Denver as the No. 1 microbrew beer city in North America. Papazian’s published commentaries on beer have provided insights to the industry, advice to homebrewers, and beer reviews for consumers. He is the founding publisher and regular contributor of Zymurgy (the magazine for homebrewers), The New Brewer (the magazine for small, professional craft brewers) and National Beer Examiner for Denver based Examiner.com.
