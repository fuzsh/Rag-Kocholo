        "text": "You don't need anything but your eyeballs to peruse and try on our frames. If you're planning to purchase prescription frames or contacts, it's helpful to have a digital or physical copy of your current prescription. If you'd like to pay with an FSA or HSA card, remember to bring that along, too.\n\nNo prescription handy? Not a problem! You can come in just to browse, shop for non-prescription sunglasses and accessories, or can book an eye exam at most locations.\n\nYes! We can take any optical measurements needed to complete your orderâ€”and if your frames don't fit perfectly on arrival, an optician is available for adjustments.\n\nPlus: Every Warby Parker frame comes with complimentary adjustments for life. Swing by any time for a tuneup.\n\nYes, indeed. We have a 30-day, hassle-free return or exchange policy for all of our eyewear and accessories. Whether you purchased online or in a Warby Parker store, we can help you out.\n\nWe also accept returns and exchanges for contact lenses within 30 days of purchase if they're in their original, unopened box."
