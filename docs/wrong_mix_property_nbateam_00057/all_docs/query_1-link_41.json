I’m still in shock about Blake! He was one of my oldest friends and a truly great guy. I believe we met in a tidal creek when he was 7 and I was 5. He pulled the biggest alligator snapping turtle I have ever seen out of that creek/drainage ditch! The turtle went to the Quattlebaum Zoo (ie their backyard on the bluff) and Blake and I became friends that day! I find solace in one thing that is certain, that Blake was in the palm of God’s hand at least a full hour before the devil knew he was gone!

You are in my prayers and thoughts.\n\n- Gail Hawthorne, Pooler, GA\n\nA candle has been lit!\n\nI only just recently heard of Blake's departure to be with the Lord. I was not only shocked but deeply saddened by the news. I love that the family requested trees be planted in his honor. Blake would have loved that. Maybe he spoke with them about this before his passing. I planted another Drake Elm my yard so I can watch it grow to be a beautiful reminder of how much Blake enjoyed the outdoors. I know his always loving family will miss him every day but I know they can have some peace in knowing that their loved one is most definitely in heaven.\n\n- Traci Sweetin, Springfield, GA"
