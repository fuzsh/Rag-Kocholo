        "text": "Karen Blake and her husband Steve founded Autism Education & Therapy Center (formerly known as the Autism foundation of Tennessee) in 2007 following her family’s move to Nashville. Her son, Matthew, was diagnosed with Autism at 18 months of age. He immediately started receiving ABA services in Atlanta and was making great progress.\n\nUpon their arrival in Nashville, the need for center-based ABA therapy was quickly apparent as Mathew started regressing. Karen and Steve founded Autism ETC to address the unmet needs of Middle Tennessee autism community.\n\nFollowing the original Nashville clinic, Autism ETC’s first Clarksville location was established in 2009 to meet the needs of the military families of nearby Fort Campbell. The Clarksville office quickly outgrew its existing location. In response, Autism ETC Clarksville commissioned a state-of-the-art ABA therapy clinic which opened in 2018. The Clarksville clinic has a capacity of 45 clients.\n\nIn 2009, Autism ETC moved to its Holt Road location in South Nashville, employing just seven people. Ten years later, Autism ETC had seventy employees across its two locations. The Holt Road location was bursting at the seams, so Autism ETC Nashville relocated to its new location in the Music Valley Area near Opryland Hotel in early 2020. The Nashville clinic has a capacity of 57 clients.\n\nIn 2020, Autism ETC announced it would begin a new chapter of growth by opening a new clinic in Glendale, Arizona near Phoenix. While the announcement surprised some, the decision was made to empower leaders within the company to carry Autism ETC’s unique value and clinical model to communities across the United States.\n\nIn 2021, Autism ETC had once again outgrown its Clarksville facility. The Harnett Court location opened in December of 2021 to increase the service capacity in Clarksville. With the addition of new space, Autism ETC is able to offer diagnostic evaluation services to in the area for the first time! The Harnett Court clinic has a capacity of 21 clients.\n\nKaren, Steve, and the entire management team are very proud of Autism ETC’s growth. The top-notch staff is committed to quality programs, and their passion to serve children is inspirational."
