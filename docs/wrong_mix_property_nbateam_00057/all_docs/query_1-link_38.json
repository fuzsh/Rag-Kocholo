        "text": "A Tribute Starring Ted Vigil\n\nTed Vigil is a singer, songwriter and a tribute artist. He was born in Seattle and raised in the Olympia area. He has been performing from the age of ten throughout school in concert, symphonic and jazz bands developing his talents as a drummer and singer.\n\nIn 2006 Ted Vigil went on to Laughlin, NV to compete in the Talent Quest 2006 involving 28 states, New Zealand, Australia and Canada taking first place. He then went on to win KOMO TV 4’s NW Afternoon Celebrity Look Alike contest in Seattle. Ted now performs nationwide for all kinds of venues and events. He has wowed the crowd selling out theatres in Pennsylvania and Kansas and has played twice now for John Denvers own “Windstar Foundation” in Aspen, CO. Ted cruised the Caribbean with Darryl Worley and Jimmy Wayne on a “Travelin’ Inc. country cruise hosted by Great American Countrys’ own Storme Warren. Last year Ted was awarded the Rising Legend Award by the National Traditional Country Music Association. Ted also performed with Steve Wiesberg, John Denvers lead guitar player from the 70’s who is quoted as saying “Apparently the audience thinks they all look and sound like John. I don’t see it. I see it with Ted. A very strong physical resemblance… Uncanny!” (King 5 Eve News Magazine clip) The most heard comments after a show are “I can’t believe how much he looks and sounds like John Denver! It really took us back!”"
