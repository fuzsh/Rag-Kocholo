        "text": "Spotlight on Steve Blake: It didn’t take a ton of prodding earlier in the series to get Lakers guard Steve Blake to spill some of the beans on his knowledge of Nuggets coach George Karl. After all, he had played for Karl as a member of the Nuggets for half of the 2006-07 season. Karl had been the beneficiary of Blake’s timely 3-point shooting, but as the Nuggets sit one loss away from the end of their season, it’s Blake who has put the hurt on the Nuggets with critical fourth-quarter 3-pointers in Games 1 and 4.\n\nTHREE POINTERS\n\n1. Will the Nuggets play at playoff intensity? Twice in this series we’ve heard individuals associated with the Nuggets speak of the team not playing at a playoff pitch. Karl said the team came out with “regular-season intensity” in Game 1. On Sunday, forward Danilo Gallinari fretted about the Nuggets lapsing in and out of the proper intensity needed to win. One thing’s for certain: If the Nuggets play laissez-faire basketball tonight, there will be no doubt their summer vacation is 48 minutes of playing time away.\n\n2. Will the Nuggets make free throws? For all of the complaining from announcers to fans about the officiating in Game 4, the jury was out on whether the Nuggets might have made the free throws anyway. They hit a dismal 9-of-18 from the charity stripe in a four-point loss. The Nuggets are shooting a respectable 73 percent from the line in the series, though, and those shots are most important on the road.\n\n3. When will rebounding return? The hyper-athletic Nuggets simply outworked and outjumped the Lakers in Games 2 and 3, getting rebounding edges in both. The Nuggets cannot get into a consistent running game if they do not rebound the basketball. Credit the Lakers for actually boxing out in Game 4, leading to a big edge on the boards. The Nuggets have proven to be pretty good in their first-shot defense. Securing the rebound would get them off and running."
