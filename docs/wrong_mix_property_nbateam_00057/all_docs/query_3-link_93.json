That's why we are proud to announce the opening of Trailblazers Park, a dedicated permanent public space that honors the legacy of those who have paved the way for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nTrailblazers Park's inaugural exhibition features 16 original flags designed by contemporary artists, each honoring the diverse legacies of LGBTQ+ heroes who dedicated their lives to fighting for equality and made a significant impact on the LGBTQ+ movement.\n\nAs an LGBTQ+ community, we at FIPPOA know how important it is to recognize and honor the Trailblazers who have made a difference. We are committed to using Trailblazers Park as a space to continue the fight for equality and representation. A new group of Trailblazers will be honored with flags every two years, ensuring that the legacy of these heroes is never forgotten.\n\nWe invite you to come and visit Trailblazers Park, celebrate the lives and legacies of these incredible Trailblazers, and be a part of the ongoing movement for equality and representation. Let's continue to build a stronger, more inclusive community together.\n\nAre you looking for a fun and easy way to give back to our amazing LGBTQ+ community? We've got the perfect opportunity for you!\n\nWe're organizing 1-hour volunteer shifts at the local post office.\n\nWhy the post office, you ask? It's simple!\n\nThe post office is a vital hub for our neighborhood, connecting us all through mail and packages. By volunteering, you'll be helping to make sure that everything runs smoothly and that everyone gets their mail on time. Plus, it's a great way to meet new people and catch up with old friends.\n\nNo special skills are needed—just bring your friendly smile and a helping hand. Whether you're sorting mail, greeting customers, or helping with deliveries, every little bit helps.\n\nSo, why not take an hour out of your day to support our community?\n\nSign up for a shift and make a difference. Let's show our pride in the neighborhood we all call home!\n\nWelcome to Whyte Hall, the heart of the Pines community. We are excited to invite homeowners to engage with our vibrant community by hosting events and meetings at our beautiful space.\n\nWhyte Hall is available for a wide variety of gatherings, from meetings and religious services to private parties and fitness classes. Our versatile space can accommodate events of all sizes, and our experienced staff is dedicated to making your event a success.\n\nWith over 200 events hosted at Whyte Hall each season, we are proud to be the hub of the Pines' cultural and social events. Our space has been home to events produced by Broadway Cares’ BROADWAY Bares in the Pines, BOFFO, DRA’s Fire Island Dance Festival, FIPAP, Recovery & Religious Meetings, and Women's Pride in the Pines.\n\nAt Whyte Hall, we believe that community engagement is key to creating a vibrant and inclusive community. That's why we offer affordable prices for event and meeting bookings, making it easier than ever for homeowners to get involved and connect with their neighbors.\n\nClick below to view our available rooms, services, and details on how to book your event or meeting at Whyte Hall.\n\nWe can't wait to see you and be a part of your next event!\n\nOur Mobility Access Cart (MAC) service is here to help anyone who needs transportation assistance in the Pines. Thanks to generous donations from our residents and support from SAGE (Services & Advocacy for GLBT Elders), we are able to offer three motorized vehicles operated by friendly and reliable volunteer drivers.\n\nOur MAC vehicles are available daily from 7 AM - 7 PM and are completely free of charge.\n\nTo make a reservation:\n\nFill out and submit the Indemnity Form here.\n\n(All riders must complete this form for each season.)\n\nSubmit a reservation here or call 631-597-3797.\n\nWe take the safety of our residents and visitors very seriously, which is why we maintain our MAC vehicles to the highest standards. However, this upkeep comes at a cost and we rely on donations to keep this vital service operating throughout the year.\n\nIf you would like to support our MAC service, please consider making a 100% tax-deductible donation today. Thank you for your support in helping us make the Pines a wonderful place to live!\n\nThe Pines is situated within the Fire Island National Seashore between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great South Bay, on one of the world's most beautiful beaches.\n\nThe Seashore Defense Fund (SDF) is an emergency funding mechanism of The Pines Foundation that allows for immediate action when catastrophe faces Fire Island Pines’ most valuable asset—its incomparable beaches.\n\nThe fund is used as needed to lend support for preservation and maintenance measures and to augment larger initiatives like beach reclamation. It is important to maintain a healthy reserve to ensure the community can respond in a timely way to any threat to our magnificent natural asset.\n\nWe believe that it's essential to take care of our environment and preserve the beauty of the Pines community. That's why we offer programs to help homeowners become environmental stewards and keep the Pines thriving.\n\nThe Pines Conservation Society (PCS) annual tree sale, held at the beginning of March, provides homeowners with an opportunity to plant trees and beautify their homes. With our help, homeowners have planted over 5,000 trees over the years, replacing those lost to pine beetles and flooding. By planting trees, you can contribute to the health of the environment and help keep the Pines lush and green.\n\nIn collaboration with the National Park Service and FIPPOA, the Pines Conservation Society offers a tree removal program. This program removes infected, dead, or dying trees from the right-of-way in the community, ensuring that the environment remains healthy and safe for everyone.\n\nJoin us in becoming environmental stewards of this beautiful community.\n\nVisit PCS to learn more about the Annual Tree Sale and the Tree Removal programs.\n\nWe are committed to representing the interests of our community and ensuring that our voices are heard in local politics. Our Political Action Committee (PAC) is a vital part of this effort, supporting political candidates who can represent the interests of the Pines.\n\nDespite our relatively small number of voters registered locally, the FIPPOA PAC is able to exercise political influence and make a meaningful impact in the Town of Brookhaven and Suffolk County. We encourage all members to consider changing their voter registration to the Pines to increase our voter rolls and participation.\n\nTo Change Your Voter Registration:\n\nIt’s easy and does not affect your tax filing status. Simply file anNYS Voter Registration Form with the Suffolk County Board of Elections to make your voice heard in local politics.\n\nTo Early Mail Ballot:\n\nRegistered voters may apply for an early mail ballot. Each person must apply for themselves. It is a felony to make a false statement in an application for an early mail ballot, to attempt to cast an illegal ballot, or to help anyone to cast an illegal ballot. Simply request an Early Mail Ballot from either New York State Board of Elections or Suffolk County Board of Elections."
