        "text": "“\n\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I... I need help. I think I wanna talk to someone.\n\n” Steven to Fallon and Sam[src]\n\nSteven Carrington is a main character in the television series, Dynasty on The CW. He is portrayed by James Mackay.\n\nThe son of Blake Carrington, and biologically Joseph Anders, Steven is an environmental activist with a flair for making his billionaire father pay for his unethical mistakes. He also has an on/off relationship with Sam Jones.\n\nHe used to reside in a mental institution in Paris following severe manipulation caused by his long-lost brother Adam Carrington, who assumed an alias and convinced Steven that he was losing his sanity. He has now returned home and rekindled his relationship with his ex-husband.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nSteven Carrington was born in 1988, in Atlanta, Georgia, to Alexis Carrington and Joseph Anders. Alexis had an affair with the Carrington family's butler, Joseph Anders, who impregnated her. She lied and claimed that Blake was the biological father so that she would remain in the Carrington family, and her child would be an heir to their fortune.[3] Because of this, Steven is the second oldest Carrington child, following his kidnapped brother, Adam. He is the older brother of Fallon Carrington, and the older half-brother of Kirby Anders. As an adult, Steven clashed with his legal father on the companies policies and ethics and decided to leave Atlanta. He helped fund several environmental protests, some even against Carrington Atlantic.\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nNote: This section is a stub. You can help Dynasty Wiki by expanding it.\n\nAfter getting a call from Blake, he returns home only to reunite with his sister and Anders, their majordomo. There, Blake introduces them to Cristal Flores, his fiancée, and business partner. Fallon however bitterly dislikes her and storms off in a huff. Steven kindly apologizes to Cristal for her stubborn behavior and starts to accept her as a step-mother. At a bar, he later meets Sam, Cristal's nephew and the two go to the hotel and have sex. Now getting involved with Police Chief Stansfield, teaming up with Jeff Colby and clashing with Blake, Steven is willing to do the right thing all the time.[4]\n\nSteven and Sam's relationship blossomed and they got married.[5]\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nNote: This section is a stub. You can help Dynasty Wiki by expanding it.\n\nSteven later left to Paraguay when things fell apart at home, and eventually ended up in France with a new supposed love interest.[6]\n\nSteven was manipulated by Adam Carrington, who introduced himself as George Emerson(character of his favourite novel), during his time in France and made to believe he had a mental illness that impaired his judgment. Adam achieved this by faking Steven's robbery and loss of passport, only to have it reappear later. Adam also made Fallon and Sam believe that Steven's \"friend\" and Paris-co ed was made up in Steven's mind. Steven was later admitted to a psychiatric facility after he was found by Fallon and Sam after the trio were lead to believe Steven was going to commit suicide. In the facility, Adam revealed his true identity to Steven, while Steven was forced into therapy and medications to treat his believed mental illness.\n\nSeason 5[]\n\nSteven spends years locked away in the sanitarium, drugged by a nurse kept on Adam's payroll. The nurse intercepts letters sent to Steven by Fallon, Blake, and Sam, and Adam additionally forges letters from Steven to his family, demanding that they not contact him. The sanitarium burns down, and the nurse dies in the fire while Steven gets out with a few burns. The lack of drugs in his system allows for his memory to become clear, and he visits the nurse's old house where he discovers what Adam has done to him. Steven has a mask made and returns to Atlanta as a hospital patient where he reconnects with his sister, Kirby, under the alias of Graham. His connection to Kirby lands him a job as the new majordomo of Carrington Manor where he is able to kidnap Adam and make him pay for all of the people that have been hurt. Steven reveals this to Adam before a physical altercation where Steven nearly kills Adam, but he refuses to allow Adam to turn him into a murderer. He demands that Adam leave and never return again, and Steven proceeds to reunite with both Sam and Fallon, the truth about Adam exposed, before he reveals himself to the rest of the family. Steven and Sam get back together, and Steven expresses interest in taking over Fallon's foundation. (\"More Power to Her\", \"Catch 22\")\n\nNotes and Trivia[]\n\nIn the original series, his relationship with his homophobic father was very complicated. In the reboot, Steven's sexuality is not a problem for Blake but their relationship is complicated due to different opinions in business and politics.\n\nIn the original series, his sister Fallon was the oldest child. In the reboot, he is the oldest.\n\nHowever, in the reboot, it was revealed in I Answer to No Man, that there is at least one more Carrington child named Adam who is the eldest.\n\nIn the original series, he had a son named Danny with Heather Lockclear's version of Sammy Jo in 1982, during their brief marriage together. In the reboot, his brief parentage with Melissa Daniels may have been a nod to Danny's existence. However, Steven wasn't the biological father of Melissa's child. Knowing Melissa, this maybe a lie too.\n\nJoseph Anders being Steven's real father may have been foreshadowed by the fact that the actor who played Steven (James Mackay) is also from Australia.\n\nOn May 24, 2019, Paula Sabbaga, one of the head writers for the show, revealed that the Dynasty writers were Steven's political career for a potential 4th season arc for this particular Carrington, however it was written into Blake's storyline instead of Steven's.[7]\n\nHe is a skilled fighter. (\"Guilt is for Insecure People\")\n\nHe is an excellent piano player. (\"Rotten Things\")\n\nHis first baby food was white truffles. (\"Enter Alexis\")\n\nAlexis would build a pillow wall on his bed whenever he brought a girl home. (\"The Butler Did It\")\n\nHe was described as Alexis to \"always [have] his nose in a book. (\"First Kidnapping and Now Theft\")\n\nHis favorite book is A Room with a View. (\"Parisian Legend Has It...\")\n\nAs a child, he was a fan of Un Chien Andalou. (\"There's No One Around to Watch You Drown\")\n\nHe had a Harriet the Spy phase and would use a wax pencil to writer secret messages. (\"There's No One Around to Watch You Drown\")\n\nHe drinks Mai Tais with lime.
