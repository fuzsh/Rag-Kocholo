Many years ago, my young son began collecting autographs from NHL players. The players he most wanted to meet were players that were from our home town of Kitchener-Waterloo. In 2011, I was able to contact Mike through a mutual friend. Not only was Mike willing to sign an autograph for a young fan, but he welcomed my son and I into his home to see his hockey memorabilia and hear stories from his playing days. What a rare privilege! I didn't know Mike well. However, one can learn a great deal about a person by seeing the kindness they extend to strangers. I imagine it must have been a gift to call Mike a friend; a father; a son; a husband; a teammate. To those who were fortunate enough to know him, my deepest condolences. As for my son and I, we will always cherish the memory of meeting Mike! Brian Allison\n\nPlease wait\n\nG\n\nGary Laskoski posted a condolence\n\nI was so saddened to hear of Mike's passing.

Although we didn’t get together often, you were always thought of. We have shared some fun times through hockey, and getting together with our Waterloo friends. In the last month of mike’s life, he told me “ if I can make it through your roast beef dinner, I can make it through this!” He never lost his sense of humour.

He was like a big brother to me, he was so kind was this OSU/NHL goalie. He brought me a OSU jersey one summer and some football practice jerseys as well. I played some golf with him but my most favorite memory of Mike is when he was back in town from playing in the NHL and he had one of those super hot new camero’s. I was drooling over it, he threw me the keys and said take it for the day…I was 16 years old and drove that car around town like I was the man!!! I remember pulling in our driveway at home, I went inside and my mom said your home early, and I said ya because I bought myself a car…you should have seen her face when she walked outside. She thought Mike was such a special person, and she was 100% correct. Rest in peace good buddy, I still have those jerseys and the memory of my ride for a day will be with me forever - Go Bucks and Go Blue.\n\nPlease wait\n\nD\n\nDave and Laurie Sloan donated to GRAND RIVER HOSPITAL FOUNDATION\n\nWe are so sorry for your loss.\n\nPlease wait\n\nP\n\nPhyllis Kurt posted a condolence\n\nMy deepest condolences to the Blake family on the loss of Mike.
