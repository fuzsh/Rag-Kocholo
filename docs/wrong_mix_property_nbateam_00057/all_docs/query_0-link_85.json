        "text": "When the series between the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat starts on Wednesday night in the N.B.A. “bubble,” Doris Burke—a television analyst and sideline reporter for ESPN—will be calling the game on radio, the first woman to ever do so for the N.B.A. Finals. Burke, who played basketball at Providence College more than three decades ago, has been in sports journalism since the nineteen-nineties, calling both men’s and women’s games on radio and television. She became a full-time N.B.A. analyst three seasons ago, and quickly gained a devoted following. In a piece for The New Yorker published during last year’s N.B.A. playoffs, David Remnick wrote, “The good news is that the best broadcaster in the game is Doris Burke. This has been the case now for years. There is no one remotely close.”\n\nThis season was interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, which forced the league to relocate twenty-two teams to an isolated campus at Disney World, near Orlando; it was nearly cancelled again after the shooting of Jacob Blake, in Wisconsin, led to the Milwaukee Bucks going on strike. After two days, the players (most of whom are Black), the team owners (most of whom are white), and the league came to an agreement. The result was a new commitment to social-justice causes, and a promise to use arenas as voting sites this November.\n\nI recently spoke by phone with Burke, who was preparing for the Finals from inside the bubble. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed the challenges of calling games in a new environment, the politics of the N.B.A., and the ways her profession has changed during the last thirty years.\n\nWhere are you, and what have your last six weeks or so been like?\n\nI am in what is referred to as the yellow bubble, which is the bubble where reporters and broadcasters are not in direct contact with the players and the coaches. Our broadcast positions are maybe seventy-five to one hundred feet away from the court, and we’re elevated slightly to get a better view. Any interaction we have with the coaches is via Zoom calls on game days. Very atypical interactions with players and coaches, but certainly it’s working just fine. We’re all joking here that every day is Wednesday.\n\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nYou wake up in the same hotel and see the same people, eat the same food, and continue on a very particular schedule, depending on how you’re trying to pass your non-working hours in the bubble. But, to be honest with you, Isaac, the working conditions really are as good as they possibly can be. We are staying in a lovely hotel. The staff here has been incredibly welcoming and gracious. I don’t want to complain, mostly because I am very mindful of the fact that there have been economic realities to this pandemic. The one challenge is that it’s difficult to be away from your family for such an extended period of time and not be in the comfort of your own home, eating the foods you eat and doing all the normal daily things that give you comfort in your home. You know where it really strikes me, and, forgive me, I’m so accustomed to asking the questions, not answering them, so if I ramble just take out whatever you don’t need.\n\nNo, I like not having to do work, so keep going.\n\nIt was interesting for me to be on Zoom calls with coaches and have a [Denver Nuggets coach] Michael Malone or a [Boston Celtics coach] Brad Stevens say, “This is day seventy-five,” and to feel the weight of what they were saying. Both of those coaches have young children, relatively young compared to mine, who are twenty-eight and twenty-six. When we had Denver’s last game, Michael Malone had just missed his twenty-second wedding anniversary and his daughter’s fourteenth birthday. Those are the challenges of the bubble.\n\nHow many days have you been there?\n\nI arrived July 23rd. But keep in mind that after two weeks, during the initial stage of this, they started to rotate [the announcers] Jeff [Van Gundy], Mark [Jackson], Mike [Breen], and Mark Jones and I out just for a few days’ break at a time. I had one after two weeks. I then had to come back and do a month straight. The reason for that was my daughter was getting married on September 13th.\n\nIt’s not that they don’t want to subject people to weeks with Van Gundy?\n\n[Laughs]\n\nHow does it make your job easier or harder, if it does?\n\nThey brought us down here a few days early so that we could get familiar with the campus and we could go over and see the positions where we would be broadcasting. We were spaced six feet apart. There was also an inch-thick plexiglass on three sides of you, including directly in front of your view to the court. The hardest part is there’s a point at which that plexiglass meets, and so if you’re looking toward the right or the left it’s not easy to see through the plexiglass. One of the things I said I was going to do as an analyst was take a beat. I have to take a beat longer to be certain that I’m getting the right player in particular. There was a seeding game where I misidentified J. R. Smith as Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, I believe. Now, this was weeks ago, so I could be wrong about who I misidentified. But I thought, O.K., even slower. You need to go even slower now.\n\nThere is something powerful about sitting courtside and watching closely the interactions of players with their teammates, with their opponents, with their coaching staff. To watch their body language and their facial expressions when adversity is hitting, when the tension is high, when the pressure is most palpable—there is something so powerful about being courtside. To me, it gives you a better chance to try to relay that to the viewer. I take enormous energy from the players on the court. We are watching the best in the world do their thing.\n\nDid you have to call two games in a day at all in the bubble?\n\nYes. Yeah, there were two or three occasions. I don’t remember now. Forgive me. These weeks have all run together.\n\nHad you ever done that before?\n\nWell, I did it quite often, frankly. We always would call games in a day for all three weekends of the N.C.A.A. tournament. On the men’s bracket, they would call four. In fact, there was a year where I called four games in a day for ESPN: two in the afternoon, two in the evening.\n\nWhen the protests started happening after the shooting of Jacob Blake, and it seemed like the season, or the playoffs, might stop, where were you and what were you thinking?\n\nI was sitting in my room prepping for our game the next day. The Milwaukee players were not taking the court. What I remember thinking at that moment was, This is historic. I was riveted. I was riveted to the coverage. I flipped over to CNN, which I am always doing, to be honest with you, as I work. Even if there’s ESPN on, NBA TV, TNT, I’m always flipping back to see the news. I just remember thinking, This is going to be powerful, because it was clear from the outset of this campus that these men so deeply wanted to have some kind of impact for their community. Yeah, I just, I respect the hell out of what they’ve tried to do here.\n\nWhat I think is lost, Isaac, to be honest with you, is the work that these young men did in their communities before George Floyd was killed. This wasn’t the first time they had been dealing with these things. It didn’t surprise me. It only elevated what I thought of these young men and their commitment to make change. If you’re paying attention to the interviews they’re doing, what comes across to me is the pain that they feel. I watched that [former Los Angeles Clippers coach] Doc Rivers interview and I cried. I cried. Here’s a man whose father was a police officer, who I know loves the United States, who I think feels quite fortunate to have had the career playing and coaching that he’s had, who wants to believe in our United States of America, who wants deeply to believe in it. To feel Doc’s pain and to know the kind of man that he is, I cried.\n\nWhen you got into sports announcing, did you see your role as being anything outside of calling games, and do you see that role any differently now?\n\nI think the start is important for me because this was not a career I aspired to. Beth Mowins is a good friend of mine. Beth and I have often discussed her knowing from a very early age that this is what she had hoped to do. She watched Phyllis George as a young girl and that put in her head, Oh, this is possible for me. To be honest with you, Isaac, I was incredibly shy outside of the four lines of the basketball court. Didn’t have a ton of confidence. There’s not a shot in hell I ever thought I’d be a broadcaster for a living. In college, I had bad hair, bad clothes, bad teeth, and bad skin. That was not a great combination for being a sports announcer.\n\nThere also weren’t many women who were doing—\n\nCorrect. Exactly right. For me, even in the very first broadcasting job I had—the year I left coaching Providence College women’s basketball, they put Providence College women’s basketball on radio. They said, “Why don’t you give this a try?” That was literally the origin. I don’t want you think I went into this with the mind-set of a journalist.\n\nNow, when we realized we were coming down to the bubble, I can tell you I knew this would be a different assignment. Essentially, there would have to be three things that we did here. The first thing we were going to have to do was document the game. That’s always our first responsibility. There’s a game played. There’s a winner. There’s a loser. There’s a reason why, and it’s our job to cover that. But we were coming down here knowing that the players were very close to saying, “No, we’re not going to play the remainder of the season. There are far too many important things going on in the world.”\n\nWe were going to have to document the social-justice movement as driven by the players. I thought it was our job. Listen, maybe other announcers thought differently than I did, but we were going to have to drive our content of social justice around what the players deemed important, in my mind. That was the way I felt we should cover it.\n\nThen the third thing was you were dealing with those two and you were doing it in the most unusual environment of your professional life. I work with Mark Jones primarily. Mark Jones is someone I’ve known for, I think, close to two decades now. We have at times discussed issues of race over the course of our careers together. Mark is married to a white woman. I remember in the past having asked him about that. In the course of this, as you know, ESPN has had several conference calls, and they have afforded all of us an opportunity to speak about issues around social justice, or the lack thereof. They’ve given each of us an opportunity. I have been on the phone with Mark Jones and heard some of the things he’s encountered in his life that I have never had to deal with.\n\nBut, as Mark Jones was covering these games, you could hear in his coverage some of the pain he has felt. One of my challenges—and I use that word because I don’t know what else to use—as his partner and as someone who’s trying to be a teammate on the broadcast, as he brought something up or documented something or shared a personal anecdote, was figuring out if it was O.K. to add to that, or to let his words hit the ears of the viewer, and just step back from it, or . . . I don’t know. I know that that was a challenge for me because you want to do the right thing. You want to do the right thing for the broadcast, but, more important, you want to do the right thing for the person and the friend that’s sitting right next to you.\n\nHow do you think the N.B.A. has dealt with all this? Because I know the N.B.A. and EPSN are obviously broadcast partners.\n\nSure. Sure.\n\nI’m sure you at least hear how the N.B.A. is feeling about things. The N.B.A. has a reputation as the most progressive professional-sport league, but there was also the China issue. The N.B.A. allowed social-justice messages on jerseys, but only certain ones. The N.B.A. is drawing lines, too. I’m curious how you think they’ve dealt with it and what you’ve been hearing about how they view these protests.\n\nI’m going to go at this from a couple of different angles. This whole campus, this ability to execute the ending of a season after the long duration of the hiatus, is nothing short of remarkable. This was a massive logistical challenge. From the health-and-safety perspective to executing two different levels of the bubble, and to have everybody participate in a way that you’ve maintained the integrity of the bubble is mind-blowing to me. No. 2, the game presentation has been off-the-charts good. When I have sat in my room and watched TNT broadcasts, I have been in awe of how they have been able to put me in a space where, when it’s a possession ballgame, I am so compelled by the action of the N.B.A. that I forget where it’s occurring.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is if the Players Association, and Michele Roberts and Chris Paul, the leadership of the Players Association, and Adam Silver and his respective leadership team didn’t have the foundation of their relationship in place, in light of everything that had occurred in society, there is no way we’d be here. The fact that they could watch yet another Black man be shot, and the season has the ground moving under its feet again and somehow maintain its footing and get back to business within a matter of hours, I’m blown away by that. I’m blown away by that because it takes an enormous amount of trust. Listen, look at what these issues are doing to our country. Frankly, I don’t understand it. This is not a political issue. Equality is not a political issue.\n\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it may be a political issue.\n\nIt is, and to me that’s complete and utter bullshit, Isaac, because the fact of the matter is it’s an issue of humanity, right? If you are an American citizen and you are not outraged at the video footage of George Floyd, I worry about us. Those are facts. It’s equality for women or equality for people of color, I don’t get what is controversial about that. We should all be pulling in that direction.\n\nAre there players you feel like are doing really great work who either you know and talk to or who should be spotlighted?\n\nWell, the first person who comes to mind is [the Portland Trail Blazers guard] Damian Lillard. This goes, Isaac, to the point that I made earlier about these are men who are contributing to their respective communities long before the national spotlight became white hot on this. Damian Lillard grows up in Oakland, and he has never forgotten where he’s come from. He goes to college in Utah, and he plays his entire professional career to this point in Portland. That man had made significant commitments to each of those three communities, and he does so quietly and he does so without pumping his chest, and you’ll never hear him breathe a word of it. He just goes about his business trying to make positive change.\n\nIn the N.F.L., there seems to be a fairly large gap, politically, between many of the Black players and many of the white players and mostly white coaches. In the N.B.A., you have a situation where there are fewer white players, and a lot of the white players are from abroad, and some of the coaches, who are also overwhelmingly white, like Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr, are very aligned with the players on political issues. Do you think there are divisions that we just don’t hear about in the N.B.A.?\n\nNo. It’s interesting you say that, because I haven’t thought of it in that light before. People sometimes say to me, “Oh, you know these guys,” or they marvel that a LeBron James or one player might acknowledge my name in an interview. I know we have a relationship that is based on our interactions in these very brief moments. I’ve been covering the N.B.A. for well over a decade now. I don’t want to overstate how well I know these players or the coaches. You get to know them and you develop relationships, but I also don’t want to oversell it. We’re operating in a completely professional environment. I don’t socialize in any context with the players. I give you that as prelude to my answer here. I will tell you unequivocally what I have felt is nothing but complete unity as it relates to what they want and what they’re fighting for here.\n\nIt’s been well documented there were players who wanted to leave the bubble and end it after Jacob Blake, and there were those who wanted to stay. Now, they were able to finally get to a place where they agreed that the season would go forward, but over all, in terms of their messaging and what they hoped to achieve, they were united—the coaches were driving the messaging as consistently as these players were.\n\nAre we more likely to have a woman call a Finals game or a woman be an N.B.A. head coach first?\n\nOh, boy, that’s a great question. I think both are now possible. Ten years ago, I don’t know that I would’ve said that. In fact, I would’ve told you there’s no way. There was a point in my career, I remember saying to my kids, “I got assigned as a sideline reporter to the Big East Championship,” and I’m, like, “You have no idea. I’m a sideline reporter on the Big East Championship game. I played and coached in this league. I’ve been watching it since I was a kid. This is as high as I’ll ever go.” Within a few years, I was an analyst on the Big East. Listen, they’re both possible, and that’s exciting to me, because ten years ago I would’ve told you you were out of your mind.\n\nWho’s going to win the Finals?\n\nI think the casual viewer might be stunned at this, but I think it’s going to be a long, hard-fought series.\n\nThat’s a cliché, Doris. Come on, you’ve got to call a winner here. Don’t say “long, hard-fought series.”"
