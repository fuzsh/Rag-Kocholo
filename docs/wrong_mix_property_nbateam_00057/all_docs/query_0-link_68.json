Yes, I said it.\n\nOn Thursday night, four teams agreed to a deal that will send Dwight Howard to the Lakers. As of now, this is what the deal looks like:\n\nLakers: Dwight Howard\n\nPhilly: Jason Richardson and Andrew Bynum\n\nDenver: Andre Iguodala\n\nOrlando Arron Afflalo, Al Harrington, Nikola Vucevic, Moe Harkless, and one protected future first-round pick from each of the other three teams.\n\nOther names may emerge by the time the deal is finalized, but the Lakers have pulled off the unthinkable. First, it was Steve Nash. And now, they have the best center in the league. The Lakers might be the first team in NBA history to have four All-Stars in their starting line-up! Are you kidding me? Here is the projected starting line-up.\n\nPG: Steve Nash, SG: Kobe Bryant, SF: Metta World-Peace, PF: Pau Gasol, C: Dwight Howard\n\nThis is absolutely ridiculous. This is unreal. This is crazy! The Lakers have three future-HALL OF FAMERS in their starting lineup! I know I picked the Thunder as the #1 seed in the West but the Lakers are my new top seed in the Western Conference.\n\nNot to mention, the Lakers still have depth with Antawn Jamison, Steve Blake, and Jordan Hill. After watching Kobe yesterday against Australia, I think it is safe to say that he is still an elite player in the NBA. With the addition of Nash and Howard, the Lakers will be a dominant force.\n\nThis is the perfect mix for a championship. The Canadian has the ability to get Dwight and Kobe their touches while managing to keep Gasol happy. Pau will definitely have to agree to take on a smaller role but I think that will lead to a higher efficiency rate.\n\nLA now has two elite veterans in the backcourt and the 26 year old down low in the paint. The Lakers have improved in every single category over this off-season.

The Lakers have improved in every single category over this off-season. Dwight Howard will help lead the Lakers to another championship.\n\nEarlier this week I predicted the top eight seeds in the Eastern Conference next year. Now it’s time to get to work on my Western Conference predictions. Post your picks in the comment section. Let the debate begin!\n\n#1. Oklahoma City Thunder– After last year’s loss in the NBA Finals, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook cannot wait for the season to start. With the same core of players, we should expect similar results. And with more playoff experience, I expect this young team to learn from their mistakes. The Thunder are the most talented team in the West. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook are hungrier than ever, and this team still has great size with Kendrick Perkins, Serge Ibaka, and Nick Collison. Projection: 61-21\n\n#2. Los Angeles Lakers– After a disappointing post-season in 2012, the Lakers went out and got veteran point guard Steve Nash to join Kobe Bryant in the backcourt. This team has become extremely dangerous with Gasol and Bynum down low, and the addition of Antawn Jamison. If Nash and Kobe can stay healthy, the Lakers will be a serious contender. Projection: 57-25\n\n#3. San Antonio Spurs– The Spurs tied for the best record in the NBA last year. However, they are all now a year older, which draws some concern for Tim Duncan. Without Duncan, this team is significantly worse and I just don’t see Timmy having another spectacular year. He’ll average 12 points and 8 rebounds but wont be the same guy we are all used to seeing. San Antonio will still be a good team led by Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. Projection: 52-30\n\n#4. Los Angeles Clippers: The Clippers look great on paper and should be able to repeat a successful season. Chris Paul is the best point guard in the League, and the big man combo consisting of Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan, have welcomed CP3 to Lob City. The Clips have a solid back up for every single position including power forward, now that Lamar Odom has returned to the team that drafted him. If Billups and Crawford can play consistently at the 2 guard, this team could surprise people come playoff time. Projection: 51-31\n\n#5. Memphis Grizzlies: The Grizzlies are a solid team and Zach Randolph has become an elite power forward. Marc Gasol is one of the better big men in the league, Tony Allen is a stifling defender, and Mike Conley is a solid point guard. Oh, and they have Rudy Gay too who is an absolute stud. However, the Grizzlies do not have a deep bench. My biggest concern for them is that they are not deep enough. If Memphis wants to make some noise in the post-season, they will have to lean on Gay and Randolph. Projection: 49-33\n\n#6. Denver Nuggets: George Karl will lead another mediocre Denver team to the post-season yet again. With no superstar, the Nuggets are a great example of a team that thrives off of team work. Denver is lethal from downtown and led the league in points per game last year. But this team still needs work, especially on the defensive side of the court. Ty Lawson will have his best season yet. Projection: 44-38\n\n#7. Utah Jazz: After losing Deron Williams, everyone assumed that the Jazz were a sinking ship. However, Utah still made the playoffs last year and I believe they will do it again in 2013. Al Jefferson and Paul Millsap are great big guys to have and the acquisition of Marvin Williams has filled the small forward position. Mo Williams will start at point guard and will have to keep the big guys involved if Utah wants to sneak into the playoffs. Projection: 43-39\n\n#8. Minnesota Timberwolves: The Wolves had a great offense last year led by Ricky Rubio and Olympiad Kevin Love. Love is one of the best rebounders in the league and Rubio can be great assuming that he is healthy. With many up and coming youngsters on the roster such as Derrick Williams, Alexy Shved, and Robbie Hummel of Purdue, this team should be exciting to watch. And the addition of Andre Kirilenko will help the Timberwolves get past the Hornets, Mavs, and Warriors, for the last seed in the Western Conference.

Projection: 42-40\n\nWho is the best point guard in the League right now?\n\nWhat makes a great point guard is the ability to orchestrate an offense while making everyone on the team a better player. A great point guard requires a high level of intelligence combined with good court vision and leadership skills. Point guards need to play hard on both sides of the court and be able to perform in clutch situations. Perimeter defense and speed are also essential. And it is vital to have good shooting percentages, dish out a lot of assists, get to the basket, shoot the three, and carry the team at times by scoring.\n\nStatistically, I look for points, assists, steals, rebounds, FG%, FT%, and 3P%. But remember, you cannot judge a player solely on paper. The small things and intangibles don’t show up in the box score, but the following five players do exhibit statistical excellence in these critical measurable areas well.\n\n#1. Chris Paul has had an incredible career. He has been extremely consistent and is a dedicated hard worker. There is a reason that he is the co-captain of the United States Olympic team. He has never averaged less than 15 points and 8 assists in a season except in his rookie year in which he averaged 7.8 assists. CP3 can do it all. He is the perfect example of a point guard who can contribute in every single aspect. He has the best court vision of any professional player hands down and is exceptionally consistent in the clutch, when the game is on the line. Chris Paul surprisingly has the most game winning shots in the NBA over the past 5 years. Yes, more than Kobe Bryant. Now that Paul is teamed up with Blake Griffin in Lob City, Los Angeles, the West better look out. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Clippers win a championship within the next few years.\n\nCareer: 18.8 points, 9.8 assists, 2.4 steals, 4.4 rebounds, 47 FG%, 85 FT%, 36 3P%.\n\nLast Year: 19.8 points, 9.1 assists, 2.5 steals. 3.6 rebounds, 48 FG%, 86 FT%, 37 3P%\n\n#2. In my opinion, Deron Williams is the only other player that even competes with Paul for the #1 slot at the PG position. D-Will has progressed every season and right now he looks unstoppable at the offensive end. He was on the All-Rookie 1st Team in 2006 and was honored with a spot on the All-NBA 2nd Team in 2008 and 2010. He was the 3rd pick in the NBA draft 7 years ago and was chosen by Jerry Sloan and the Jazz BEFORE Chris Paul. Although he is not the fastest or most athletic, he has the most range on his shot and is a great competitor. He set the Nets franchise record last season by scoring 57 points in one game! Now that he has Joe Johnson in the back court with him, the Brooklyn Nets could be very dangerous.\n\nCareer: 17.6 points, 9.2 assists, 1.1 steals, 3.3 rebounds, 46 FG%, 81 FT%, 35 3P%\n\nLast Year: 21 points, 8.7 assists, 1.2 steals, 3.3 rebounds, 41 FG%, 84 FT%, 34 3P%\n\nHere is where it got tough to select further, and I went with the less traditional pick.\n\n#3. Rajon Rondo is freakishly athletic and can do things with his body that I never knew were possible. He has a deep arsenal of moves and can distribute the ball to his teammates like no other point guard. His court vision makes him one of the smartest players in the league. He has incredibly long arms, and standing at 6’1”, he is a great on ball defender and as aggressive as a point guard can get. Last season, he had the most triple doubles out of all the point guards in the league. And Rondo is not afraid to get on the floor or wrestle for a rebound. So why is he not number one? His shot. He is awful from the free throw line, I mean absolutely dreadful. Unlike most other point guards, he rarely hits the three. Although his numbers improved in the playoffs last year, he is still a 62% free throw shooter and his jump shot is mediocre at best. If he works on his jumper, he could eventually become a superstar but right now I see him as only the third best point guard in the league.\n\nCareer: 10.8 points, 8.1 assists, 1.9 steals, 4.4 rebounds, 48 FG%, 62 FT%, 24 3P%\n\nLast Year: 11.9 points, 11.7 assists, 1.8 steals, 4.9 rebounds, 45 FG%. 60 FT%, 24 3P%\n\n#4. Derrick Rose is explosive and is the best scoring point guard in the League. He can beat you on the drive, and if you give him space, he will nail a jumper in your face. He is very strong for his size and can play great defense as well as offense. Assuming he will get healthy, I see Rose as the 4th best PG in the League. Rose just needs to mature a little bit more and learn how to involve his teammates more often on the offensive end of the floor. Once he improves his playmaking ability, Chicago could give Miami a run for their money.\n\nCareer: 21 points, 6.8 assists, .9 steals, 3.9 rebounds, 46 FG%, 82 FT%, 31 3P%\n\nLast Year (only 39 games due to injury): 21.8 points, 7.9 assists, .9 steals, 44 FG%, 81 FT%, 31 3P%\n\n#5. Lastly, we have the Canadian. You can’t have a conversation about point guards without including Steve Nash. Nash is 38 years old and has played in the League for 16 seasons. Somehow, he has maintained a great resume throughout it all. He is in the homestretch of his career as he seeks an NBA Title with his new teammate Kobe Bryant and the Lakers. Nash is a back to back League MVP and arguably has the highest basketball I.Q. in the world. Some say that he is the best shooter in the league too. To average 50% from the field, 40% from beyond the arc, and 90% at the foul line is incredibly rare and the staple for a great shooter. It is only a matter of time before Nash is inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\nCareer: 14.5 points, 8.6 assists, .7 steals, 3 rebounds, 49 FG%, 90 FT%, 43 3P%\n\nLast Year: 12.5 points, 10.7 assists, .6 steals, 3 rebounds, 53 FG%, 89 FT%, 39 3P%\n\nHonorable mention goes to Tony Parker who is #6 on my list.\n\nI didn’t even consider Russell Westbrook because I honestly don’t think he is point guard material. I think he is an undersized shooting guard. In my opinion, if you have a shoot first mentality with Kevin Durant on your team, you are not an elite point guard. He turns the ball over too often and needs to mature a lot to crack the top 5.\n\nSo there you have it! My top five Point Guards in the League! Who is in your top five?"
