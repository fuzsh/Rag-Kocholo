        "text": "Nuggets coach George Karl isn’t asking for approval or veto power. Just a voice.\n\nThe organization has plenty of salary cap-related decisions to make this summer as Denver retools for next season. Karl wants input.\n\n“As I get older, I understand that coaches have to accept what happens,” Karl said Thursday. “It’s a business. There’s free agency, there’s contracts, there’s salary caps. I think everybody would like the foundation and the pillars of this team to stay intact, and I think that will be a major conversation. But I’m sure there’s also a philosophy that will be thrown into the pot that (there) could be other ways.\n\n“Summertime for me is (a time) I throw out my desires and my philosophies, and I know that they’ll be listened to; this organization does listen to me. But, they also know that I know that things sometimes have to be done based upon basketball being a business.”\n\nThe Nuggets have been eliminated from the first round of the playoffs four consecutive seasons, the latest coming Wednesday night in San Antonio. Denver has more than $75 million in salary committed to 10 players for next season and faces luxury tax issues unless it moves one of its expensive players. The Post has reported that unless the Nuggets made it at least to the second round, changes would likely be made to the roster in order to lower the cap.\n\nWhen Karl arrived in Denver in 2004, he purposely stayed away from voicing opinions on front-office decisions, opting to keep his focus on the court. This past season, however, he expressed some displeasure with the trades of Andre Miller and Earl Boykins at the time of the deals.\n\nNow, he has ideas about which direction he wants the organization to go, but will wait to voice them.\n\n“I think the organization wants to hear what I have to say, and I think they give me a lot of say,” Karl said. “But it’s not important to me that I have a vote or I have power. What’s important is we win basketball games. That’s what turns me on. And I think we’re going to have a team that wins a lot of games next year.”\n\nWho is on the roster remains to be seen. The Spurs exposed the Nuggets’ weakness from 3-point range, but Karl said everything isn’t as it seems.\n\n“There’s anger, there’s emptiness, there’s frustration right now,” Karl said. “Just because San Antonio did something against us, that might not be the No. 1 priority, it might be another priority that I might put in front. So, I’m not going to predict or philosophize until a couple of weeks from now.”\n\nForward Carmelo Anthony said he just wants the Nuggets to make sound moves this offseason.\n\n“I’m not saying that they shouldn’t make any (financial) decisions, which they have to,” Anthony said. “Just make the right decisions. That’s all I’m saying. I’m not telling them how to run their business.”\n\nPlayers who could end up on the trading block for salary cap reasons include center Marcus Camby ($9 million next season), forward Eduardo Najera ($4.95 million) and forward Reggie Evans ($4.32 million).\n\nFree-agent guard Steve Blake and forward DerMarr Johnson will test the market during the offseason, and both have desires. For Blake, who will live in Portland, Ore., during the summer, it’s finding a team he has on his wish list.\n\n“There’s a list,” he said. “I don’t know if my agent wants me to say it yet. But there’s a list.”\n\nNuggets vice president of player personnel Rex Chapman has said he would like to re-sign Blake.\n\nFor Johnson, it’s finding a team to give him playing time, and he’s willing to go anywhere.\n\n“I want to play,” Johnson said. “And at this point, it really don’t matter where. But certainly, I want to be on the floor.”\n\nBrawl ramifications\n\nSo, was the Anthony-J.R. Smith fight against the New York Knicks in December good for the team, or bad? Two takes.\n\n“The brawl somehow brought us together as a team because it showed that we care for each other, we take care of each other,” Najera said. “You hate to go that way, but it seemed like it got us together, and we definitely had better chemistry and better players because of that incident that happened. As you saw down the stretch, we became closer, and that’s what we want.”\n\nAnthony, who was suspended 15 games, said it had more of a negative effect.\n\n“We were winning before that. We were on a roll before that. A little winning streak, and then that happened.”\n\nKudos for J.R.\n\nThe story of Karl’s benching of Smith died down quickly because of how Smith accepted the news when finally told. The guard calmly answered all questions about it, and while on the bench during Game 5 of the Nuggets-Spurs series he was perhaps the most visible player cheering on his teammates.\n\n“He did a great job,” forward Linas Kleiza said. “He stayed positive. He cheered for his teammates. He’s becoming a pro. A really good pro. It’s tough to go through that adversity.”\n\nStaff writer Marc J. Spears contributed to this report."
