        "text": "To celebrate 10 years of Warm Visions / Combo Breaker Kid, I’ve compiled my 200 favorite albums of the 2010s. Not only that, but I’ve concocted “Warm Visions” descriptions and wrote blurbs about each record. I’m sure you can infer from that that this is a long post, so get your popcorn, get your cookie dough bites, get a cuppa tea in a nice insulated mug – you’re gonna be scrolling quite a bit.\n\nThis is a ranked list of 200 albums that’s chock full of personal gems, obvious premium indie biggos, landmark generational achievements and dark horses that most have forgotten about. I initially had a list of 100, but thought why not expand to 200? It’s my own damn blog and I have a lot of records I want to write about. Collectively all the preparation and execution adds up to nearly a year’s worth of work. Yes, that’s far too much time to be working on a Best Albums of the Decade post. I know this. But I had a lot of fun doing it, so that’s what matters.\n\nThe ranking is pretty fluid and shouldn’t mean much to you until you get to the Top 20 or so. Those are the true lifetime favorites. I was moving records around position-wise the day before this was released, so clearly the numbers don’t mean a whole lot. It’s just a snapshot of where I’m at right now. Who knows what my AOTD will be in five years. You should just listen everything I’ve listed here, regardless of ranking. I tried including streaming links for each record, but it turns out having 200 embedded YouTube videos in one post slows it down a bit. Instead, you can sample most of these in my massive Best Songs of 2010-2019 Spotify playlist! Sorry to those who don’t have Spotify, I’ll try and branch out this decade!\n\nThanks for reading and following along with this goofy blog for 10 years. Hope you enjoy.\n\n200. CHASTITY BELT – Time To Go Home [2015]\n\nNothing serious, everything’s a joke.\n\n~~\n\nThis is an album that defined my final semester of college. Jammy, jangly indie rock that has a great sense of humor. Sounds like the comedown after a drunk night out with friends, but still holding the memories of the times y’all spent together near and dear to your heart.\n\n199. OWEN PALLETT – Heartland [2010]\n\nA ballet with intense, coordinated dance routines in a snowstorm.\n\n~~\n\nOwen Pallett made a smart, dramatic chamber pop masterpiece on Heartland. Haven’t really heard this style of music be replicated this decade. “Lewis Took Off His Shirt” is eternal. Where the heck is a new Owen Pallett album is what I want to know!\n\n198. DEERHUNTER – Monomania [2013]\n\nDoing a sick motorcycle jump over a pit of alligators while shedding a single tear.\n\n~~\n\nKind of the start of the current phase of Deerhunter. It also exists in a universe of its own, one of blown out distortion, Bradford Cox’s ultimate flamboyance and incorporating more country elements into their rock layout. “Sleepwalking” is the hit! Hearing “Monomania” live was killer, they blow the roof off the venue with noise.\n\n197. KRILL – A Distant Fist Unclenching [2015]\n\nWaking up with every surface of your house covered in mouse traps.\n\n~~\n\nTaking cues from obvious alternative rock bands of the late 80s/early 90s like Pixies while also doing weirdo stuff no one else has did then or since, Krill made one of the best Exploding In Sound releases of the decade. It seems like their debut is more widely regarded as the classic, but this one is near and dear to my heart. This one has “Tiger”, which has one of the best buildup/payoffs ever recorded: over a minute of cathartic guitar pounding. It’s worth it.\n\n196. DIRTY BEACHES – Badlands [2011]\n\nThe most glamorous car crash in the west.\n\n~~\n\nCame onto this one late, but I’m glad I did. Noir rockabilly vibe with a knack for noise. There are some truly beautiful, top-decade moments on this LP, like the shrieking guitar solos on “A Hundred Highways” (totally the most glamorous car crash song since “In The Kingdom #19” by Sonic Youth) and of course “Lord Knows Best”, one of the best songs ever. Dude is obsessed with Twin Peaks and it shows. Wish he made more records like this but I respect his artistry and what he’s doing now.\n\n195. ROYAL HEADACHE – Royal Headache [2011]\n\nDrinking a ton of caffeine and trying to see all of your friends in one day.\n\n~~\n\nHigh energy garage rock with one hell of a singer. One of the great rock records of this decade. I think my Warm Vision description above does this record justice in providing what you need to know about the sound. It’s jittery, infectiously positive and blows by in a second. The obvious star of the show is singer Tim “Shogun” Wall, whose soulful wailing puts an extra earnest layer on top of the hyped up garage rock instrumentals.\n\n194. GRAVE BABIES – Crusher [2013]\n\nThe sound of a metal baseball bat making impact with a human skull.\n\n~~\n\nMan this is a gross record. Some of the grimiest coldwave/post punk ever recorded. It seems like the audio was recorded, abandoned, then the tape grew mold and the engineers just said “yeah this is fine.” Everything is totally blown out and distorted but still… sounds good? It’s confusing. Either way, if you’re looking for a goth-as-hell ride to Heck with some GREAT hooks and inventive production, look no further than this overlooked gem.\n\n193. WHITE DENIM – Last Day of Summer [2010]\n\nHaving a leisurely day grilling outdoors unravels once you realize your dog has knowingly locked you out of your own house, causing you to get help from your neighbors to try get back into your abode before the sun sets.\n\n~~\n\nThis record holds an incredibly special place in my heart. It was a major soundtrack to my final summer spent living in Michigan and has remained in heavy summer rotation since then. Maybe the quintessential summer rock album for me? It’s lightweight, breezy, soulful, groovy, but most of all it’s FUN. It sounds like the band had a blast making this record and it translates perfectly to the listener. Seems like a precursor to bands like Whitney even. Don’t you dare miss this one and add it to your summer playlist ASAP.\n\n192. WAXAHATCHEE – Cerulean Salt [2013]\n\nGoing fishing as healing after a traumatic incident.\n\n~~\n\nThis record has grown on me SO much since it first came out. Katie Crutchfield has some wild way of crafting a song that packs in so much room for wistfulness, about family, about relationships, in such small packages. I have more to say about her songwriting later, but her first step into real indie rock icon status is a marvelous one.\n\n191. JULIA HOLTER – Ekstasis [2012]\n\nMaking a boat out of a cloud and sailing to an undiscovered continent.\n\n~~\n\nWhereas Holter’s following two albums are like being plunged within a dream, this is more sketches of dreams with a touch of rigidity to its formula. Still, this album easily envelops the listener in baroque dream pop, a gateway between her early heavily experimental work and her more accessible albums that followed this one.\n\n190. FEAR OF MEN – Early Fragments [2013]\n\nEncountering a vision in a secluded sea cave of a sailor that was lost at sea.\n\n~~\n\nThere is just something so special about this band. With lyrics that touch on mysticism that intertwines with the singer’s own personal troubles, all set with a punchy jangle pop background. Any fans of indie rock or jangle pop owe themselves to listen to this record and their follow-up Loom.\n\n189. PERFUME GENIUS – No Shape [2017]\n\nThrowing 100 bouquets of roses into a stream and floating among them downriver.\n\n~~\n\nBoth bold and vulnerable in the same breath. This is the most complete Perfume Genius album, with luscious instrumentation featuring strings, epic flourishes in the choruses and tender keys. The pure variation of sound among these tracks is also astonishing. Just so awesome to see this project grow so much over the past 10 years.\n\n188. TY SEGALL BAND – Slaughterhouse [2012]\n\nA homemade roller coaster made with a riding lawn mower goes dangerously off the rails.\n\n~~\n\nMaybe the only garage rock record from this decade that you need to listen to? Ok, I’m definitely biased against the genre after overdosing on it sometime in 2015, but damn the Ty Segall Band experience from 2012 still hits. It’s fun and destructive, clearly pulling inspiration from Ty Segall’s background in hardcore (or maybe his proximity to it in CA) and blending it with blues, sludge metal, noise rock and more.\n\n187. BILL CALLAHAN – Apocalypse [2011]\n\nRiding a horse to a motel in Montana and booking one room for the horse and one for yourself because the horse doesn’t like that you watch political commentary late at night.\n\n~~\n\nI’m not the most familiar with Bill Callahan’s massive catalog, but man is this a satisfying album to listen to. Serious somber simmering on some tracks and a lightweight jesterness on others. One of America’s great modern folk songwriters. Definitely one that I’m going to be revisiting more as I get more time to digest it.\n\n186. THE BETHS – Future Me Hates Me [2018]\n\nThe satisfying feeling of watching your close friends and family react negatively and shamefully after you say something really self-deprecating but actually very funny.\n\n~~\n\nScientifically engineered all-star indie rock BANGER CENTRAL right here. The melodies, the hooks, the performances, the arrangements – it’s all there and it’s all top-notch. Any Alvvays fans… or really just indie rock fans in general need to be anticipating The Beths’ sophomore album, hopefully coming early in the 20s.\n\n185. MACINTOSH PLUS – Floral Shoppe [2011]\n\nAn entire city of people that look incredibly cool in an 80s way, but hold music comes out of their mouths when they try to speak.\n\n~~\n\nAt first listen, I hated this record. I feel like that’s the most common reaction when presented this record. I kept listening. Why, I thought. Why does this collection of wacky, slowed down hold music jams + Whitney Houston keep pulling me back in? Well, it’s pretty infectious and unlike anything (most things) out at the time. It certainly spearheaded a whole new internet renaissance if you can call it that. Just go in with a good sense of humor and you’ll have a good time.\n\n184. FRANK OCEAN – Channel Orange [2012]\n\nA long weekend of partying and engaging in the most basic pleasures at home while your parents are away.\n\n~~\n\nCome for “Pyramids”, stay for “Pyramids”. Nah I mean, this is a modern classic! The early baby steps that soon turned out to be baby rocket shoes shooting Frank Ocean into being a modern R&B and pop culture titan. Kinda nerdy, very romantic, a bit elusive, extra sweet, jazzy and groovy in the right spots, and with peak guest features for 2012 (Earl, John Mayer and Andre 3000, what a combo). This has faded on me a bit, but its influence has continued to make ripples in the current music environment.\n\n183. FLOATING POINTS – Crush [2019]\n\nCompleting complex equations on a giant chalk board opens a gate to a secret dimension.\n\n~~\n\nI recently wrote a bit about this in my Best Albums of 2019 post, but the main gist is that the swirling, gorgeous sounds on this LP are intoxicating. How something can be so invigorating while also being so pleasing to the mind is a wonderful thing. Just brilliant electronic music.\n\n182. TOPS – Picture You Staring [2014]\n\nRosy smiles and loose laughter fill a room more than the furniture in it does.\n\n~~\n\nAnother record that defined my senior year of college and all the parties, hangouts and friendly times that came along with it. To perfectly cap off my final year as a TOPS-centric one, I got to book the band a show at my college and partied with them and my good friends afterwards. This record will always bring back fond memories for me. I assume that it will do the same with anyone else who goes back to listen to it. It’s just such a lovely companion to have. Blissful, romantic and dreamy pop music. Put a few of these cuts on at your next party.\n\n181. HOLLY HERNDON – Platform [2015]\n\nThe price to pay if you forget all your account passwords all at once.\n\n~~\n\nThis record totally broke my brain when I first heard it. Not only was it my introduction to ASMR (weird!) but it also provided me a song that literally gives me an anxiety episode whenever I listen (maybe more when it first came out), which is “An Exit” featuring Amnesia Scanner. Meshes of voice and brutal computerized sounds twisted and contorted around rippling bass and cacophonous crashes of malfunctioning electronics. This album continues to be an inspiration to me, despite some of its obtuse edges.\n\n180. KRALLICE – Years Past Matter [2012]\n\nLightning strikes the earth so intensely that magma begins to surge out of the strike zone, along with molten hordes of undead agents of hell.\n\n~~\n\nWhat a trip! I’m really not well-versed when it comes to metal terminology but man does this thing rip. I’m feeling like there are elements of black metal, heavy metal, death metal, doom metal and more. In short, it’s HEAVY. Everything pops from the mix and nothing is lost in the frenzy. I would be listening to this in headphones and just feel myself vibrating from the excitement. There are long songs, but they buckle you in for the ride: there’s no getting out now. If you’re interested in dipping into metal or haven’t checked this out, I cannot recommend this enough.\n\n179. ELITE GYMNASTICS – RUIN [2011]\n\nAn intense sugar rush from an experimental candy yields to an emotional, delirium-inducing crash.\n\n~~\n\nOf course it’s natural for artists to move on and do new things over time as they change on their own, but damn I’m bummed that Elite Gymnastics isn’t around anymore, because RUIN is magic. RUIN is a combo of two EPs: the first contains rave-inspired, lo-fi pop that’s a total blast, and the second comprises of “chopped & screwed” versions of those original songs that are some of the most melancholy and numbing of the decade. The two “HERE, IN HEAVEN” tracks are some of my absolute favorites. Try and find this on Soundcloud(!) or YouTube, since it’s not on streaming services. Please bring it back!\n\n178. TAKAO – Stealth [2018]\n\nTaking a seat on a deserted beach on a bright, breezy day, the smells and sounds of the Earth and sea take control of your subconscious and guide you through your troubles.\n\n~~\n\nMaybe the most under the radar record on this list. According to last.fm, I’m this artist’s top listener. Brilliant new age / neoclassical debut album from Tokyo. Accompanied many-a-snooze + commute + stressful moment throughout 2019 (where it was far and away my most listened-to album). To say this sounds and feels like the cover, a bright and shining island scene, would be a disservice to its versatility, but its minimal tones and soothing, smooth textures really do transport the listener to a peaceful place.\n\n177. SAM AMIDON – The Following Mountain [2017]\n\nA bluegrass fever dream where everything transforms into sweaty free jazz.\n\n~~\n\nI’ve loved Sam Amidon’s music for a long time now, but this is his best album in my eyes. Taking heady Arthur Russell-like experimentation and bringing it into a more bluegrass zone is just amazing. Not to mention, jazz also flies into this record with help from new and old masters like Sam Gendel, Shahzad Ismaily and Milford Graves. No boundaries are safe.\n\n176. GORILLAZ – Plastic Beach [2010]\n\nA planet-wide treasure hunt spanning from harsh deserts, to frozen depths, to impregnable jungles, all while being chased by a shadowy government operative.\n\n~~\n\nWhat can I say about Plastic Beach? This was my most-anticipated album going into this decade and for the most part it’s held up beautifully, especially when compared to Gorillaz’ last two records of the . This record balances solid guest performances (that seem legit / fit into the sound of the album) with a good amount of Damon Albarn to glue it all together. I’m a Gorillaz fan through and through – there’s no way I’ll abandon this album.\n\n175. DAVID BOWIE – Blackstar [2016]\n\nA wizard calls a meteorite to Earth just to harvest its rare minerals to use in a powerful, dimension-opening spell.\n\n~~\n\nThe final transmission from David Bowie. We lost him far too soon, but it was so kind of him to leave us with such an enigmatic, multi-layered and intense final record. It’s got plenty of doom and gloom, but you can tell Bowie was having fun experimenting on this one. I didn’t find myself listening to it super often since its release, but I appreciate it mightily nonetheless.\n\n174. KLLO – Backwater [2017]\n\nWarm lights bob and pulsate around and against two stainless steel sculptures of lovers.\n\n~~\n\nThis record is so damn underrated! I don’t know what you’d call it: downtempo vocal house? Electronica? Regardless, there are some bangers on this record that I’ve returned to time and time again since 2017. It definitely takes cues from the late 90s / early 00s but keeps its sound in the present for the most part. The singles are obviously hits, but even deeper cuts like the mostly instrumental “By Your Side” is hypnotic and totally a zoner.\n\n173. ARIEL PINK – pom pom [2014]\n\nA children’s cartoon program hit with alien distortion rays becomes NOT a children’s program very fast, mentally scarring families across the nation in real time.\n\n~~\n\nYou’re a strange one, Mr. Pink. There are a few stinkers on here, but the songs that hit are some of Ariel Pink’s all-time best. It sounds like jingles from 80s and 90s television commercials that have been distorted to hell and back, spliced with odd ballads found on black spine VHS tapes found in a Salvation Army. A bizarre hodgepodge home video with ambiguous, terrifying homemade commercial breaks.\n\n172. 2814 – 新しい日の誕生 / Birth of a New Day [2015]\n\nTaking solitary evening strolls through a post-apocalyptic metropolis, where the city lights still beam with energy but the streets are disturbingly empty.\n\n~~\n\nThis is a special record for me. When I was commuting between Connecticut and New York once a week in 2015, I would listen to this album on every return trip back to CT. It’s a perfect late-night train companion. It may be a bit bloated near the end (also I’d be fully asleep by then) but the first few tracks are absolute ambient / vaporwave bliss. An instant teleportation device to an emotional timeline set in a bustling, futuristic metropolis.\n\n171. SZA – CTRL [2017]\n\nEating a delicious fruit plate and sliding around on wood floors while burning the possessions of an annoying ex.\n\n~~\n\nThere are moments on this record where I’m like holy smokes, this record is my favorite of 2017. Some of the choruses are so next level (“Drew Barrymore” is far and away my favorite), SZA’s voice is athletic, bounding all over her register, and the amount of different sounds synergizing here is an inspiration for future pop/R&B of the 20s. We’re already seeing examples right now, but I’m anticipating even more fantastic, experimental yet successful records like it coming soon.\n\n170. HUNDRED WATERS – Hundred Waters [2012]\n\nGlowing cave moss provides light for a small troupe of bioluminescent forest nymphs putting on a micro symphony for travelers.\n\n~~\n\nAnother madly underrated record. Doesn’t really sound like much else. Kind of pigeonholed into the “folktronica” label and yes, they fuse organic and synthetic instrumentation, but the way they weave together their own wondrous world with this diverse array of sounds and timbres is so gorgeous. It’d be a crime if I didn’t mention the lofty, totally unique voice of singer Nicole Miglis, who’s able to string together this blinking, mossy forest tale together. They’ve moved past this sound on their most recent album, but I’m happy they gave us this to begin their career.\n\n169. TR/ST – Joyland [2014]\n\nA high-speed, gravity-defying plummet down a blinking, strobing, throbbing chasm.\n\n~~\n\nWant the feeling of going to a dark, smoky club with alien-like dance music but don’t actually want to go out? Look no further than the sophomore record from TR/ST, who plunges the listener into a vibe unlike any other. It’s sinister and joyous. It’s dramatic and throbbing. It will hit you with a total fetish dance banger (“Capitol”, “Peer Pressure”) and then turn on the emotions (#emotionalinthecub) with a slow burner cooldown (“Are We Arc?”). Like I said, I don’t think any other record on this list captures the vibe that this one lays out. Go embrace your hedonistic side and blast this record in your room.\n\n168. THE BOOKS – The Way Out [2010]\n\nA self-help seminar that ends up alienating and endangering most of its attendees due to an accidental demon summoning.\n\n~~\n\nThe Books: a singular entity that was gone too soon! Would love to have seen what they would have made together in the late 10s. They’re kind of like the Everything Is Terrible of music-makers, taking samples from old television and radio broadcasts and connecting them with electronic and folky instrumentation. Their records never fail to make me smile and this one is no different, with plenty of fun little snippets that will make you question what the actual context was behind it. Tons of fun, outrageous fun.\n\n167. FATHER JOHN MISTY – I Love You, Honeybear [2015]\n\nReading the advice column newspaper and then jumping in a fountain without removing anything from your pockets.\n\n~~\n\nHaven’t gone back to I Love You, Honeybear with as much vigor as I did when it was first released (cause I listened to the SHIT outta this in 2015), but some of the songs still hit super hard with me. Really great, satisfying songwriting, hilarious and tragic lyrics, and the endless personality dolloped onto these tracks from FJM makes for something resembling classic in my eyes.\n\n166. JULIANNA BARWICK – Nepenthe [2013]\n\nSitting in an outdoor hot tub one peaceful winter night and watching the steam drift through the bare tree limbs, mingling with the clouds.\n\n~~\n\nTotally gorgeous new age / ambient music based on echoed loops of Julianna Barwick’s voice, usually accompanied by piano and strings. “Pyrrhic” is my favorite on here and features guest vocals from Jonsi of Sigur Ros. If you’ve never listened to Barwick’s music before, I’d say the prettier, slower moments from Sigur Ros records are a good comparison. We’ll see more of her later though – I have much more to say.\n\n165. FORD & LOPATIN – Channel Pressure [2011]\n\nBeing afflicted with a dangerous case synth poisoning after too much noodling.\n\n~~\n\nJoel Ford and Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) expanded their extremely-online GAMES project for a full-length album with wonderful results. This is a severely overlooked record that has a ton of gems on it. 80s synth nerd soaked pop jams. There are two songs with Autre Ne Veut singing. There are crunchy guitars. There’s plenty of wacky drum programming. All the technologic synths you could ask for. Sometimes it sounds like a nightmare. Other times it sounds like you’re flying through the air on a hoverboard as you high-five an anti-drug PSA penguin mascot. This record does hold a lot of sentimental value, so that’s probably another reason why it’s on here, but it’s still a worthwhile listen. Especially for those wanting to capture all of Oneohtrix’s work.\n\n164. WHITNEY – Light Upon The Lake [2016]\n\nAn honest, supportive get-together with old friends helps heal internal and emotional injuries sustained in the time since their last meeting.\n\n~~\n\nIn 2016, I was absolutely head over heels with this record. I had graduated college the year before and the songs here reminded me of vital hangs with my sweet friends. A few years have passed by since then. These songs no longer carry that spark, rather play like faraway memories. I no longer hang out with friends. I no longer have the same lightness in social situations. I have become reclusive and have the feeling that all my friends feel the similarly. This no longer makes me feel like I’m together with them, but instead like those days have passed, a glossy picture framed on a wall in a room I don’t go into often.\n\n163. MAC DEMARCO – 2 [2012]\n\nA big graphic tee from high school that brings you comfort in casual moments like getting a slushee from the gas station.\n\n~~\n\nHey take a chill pill bro! Remember 2012 when Mac DeMarco was a bright-eyed upstart making music for the kids? Yeah that was a good time. That was a simpler time. I could listen to “Ode To Viceroy” and “My Kind of Woman” without thinking of a meme of a teen with comically rolled jeans and 10 cigarettes stuffed in their nose. Man that sounds pretty cool. Listen now it still definitely feels like sitting in an old car with carpet-lined seats and just cruising around town. Glad it hasn’t been completely ruined by irony.\n\n162. THE BABIES – Our House On The Hill [2012]\n\nDoing a dance around a sunflower in the middle of your apartment to help it grow.\n\n~~\n\nDoes anyone remember The Babies? I sure do. Kevin Morby and Cassie Ramone coming together for jangly power pop tunes that make you feel like dancing. After listening to a few solo Morby records from this decade, you can tell he had a big hand in the guitar sound on this record. We already saw a Vivian Girls reunion last decade, who’s to say we won’t see a Babies reunion in the 20s? I really don’t know if there are any other politics surrounding this band not being around anymore, so don’t get mad at me if there are. Just a great, overlooked indie rock supergroup that you should listen to if you haven’t.\n\n161. GRIMES – Visions [2012]\n\n– Looking into a mirrored marble reveals the hidden extraterrestrial beings that feed on your excess brain heat.\n\n– Finding liberation in a cybernetic sacrifice circle.\n\n~~\n\nSome decade-defining synth pop right here. “Genesis” and “Oblivion” are obviously the GOATs, but songs like “Be A Body”, “Vowels” and “Nightmusic” still bang too. I’ve fallen out with this album a bit, but listening to it again now really does bring me back to 2012. It seemed like everything was gonna get really weird and really fun back then. Things definitely did get weird but way too fast and then it burned out. Now things are all twisted upside down and inside out. But listening to this makes me feel better again. This album is so iconic I somehow wandered onto the McGill football field when I was in Montreal and took a picture because it’s the setting for some of the shots in the “Oblivion” music video.\n\n160. JESSICA PRATT – Quiet Signs [2019]\n\nSitting in the corner booth of a 24-hour diner at 2am, watching waitresses and clientele, steam rising out of the kitchen window, woman smoking on the curb outside, your own contorted face in a soup spoon.\n\n~~\n\nWhat else can I say about the album that you can’t already gleam from the Warm Visions description? It’s a cool, collected night alone, walking through a city. Delicate acoustic guitar, faraway warbling piano, flourishes of flute, and a rogue tambourine all provide Jessica Pratt’s cloud-like voice a place to stay. It’s gorgeous night music, plain and simple.\n\n159. REAL ESTATE – Days [2011]\n\nThe feeling of a refreshing summer breeze that beckons the call of incoming autumn.\n\n~~\n\nAlthough I haven’t found myself listening to Real Estate that much lately, this record still has jam after jam. Whereas Jessica Pratt’s Quiet Signs (listed above) is a night music record, this is perfect for mornings and lazy afternoons. Everything here is presented lackadaisically, but with intent. Nothing is taken for granted, even though it may be low energy: a gentle frisbee toss, a friendly pat on the back, a slow ceiling fan. It’s all there to support you, but it’s just taking it easy right now.\n\n158. JENNY HVAL – Apocalypse, girl [2015]\n\nAscending to heaven and after finding out there’s just as much misogyny and rampant ignorance up there, you will yourself back to life to try accessing a different afterlife.\n\n~~\n\nExperimental dream pop with a dose of feminist poetry? Does that work? Jenny Hval embraces harmonies and sounds that are so gloriously beautiful and emotive (“That Battles Is Over”, “Heaven”) but also so unsettling (“Holy Land”, White Underground”) that this album is an entire journey between a sort of heaven and hell, with sexual tension and freedom being at the center.\n\n157. SAMPHA – Process [2017]\n\nAn extremely likable protagonist is on a journey to recover his lost memories.\n\n~~\n\nLike I wrote in the Warm Visions description, there’s something about Sampha that makes him so likable. His voice carries a distinct earnestness that gives the music so much more weight. You really believe that he feels strongly about what he’s singing about. The result is an album that may have been forgotten to time if Sampha doesn’t follow it up with some heat. But with songs like “Under”, “Kora Sings”, “(No One Knows Me) Like The Piano” and “Blood Knows” I know I’ll be listening to this for a while, so it better not get lost to time.\n\n156. JANELLE MONAE – Dirty Computer [2018]\n\nA deliciously funky sexual revolution to get all this bogus business balanced.\n\n~~\n\nUltra-funky and accessible pop/R&B hybrid album whose very existence makes me very happy. A bit heavy-handed with mission statements, but the fact that a sex-positive, queer-friendly album that’s also this liquid and groovy was incredibly successful is awesome. Janelle Monae is so hard to dislike, so when she starts having fun on this record, it’s hard not to get wrapped up in it too.\n\n155. ANGEL OLSEN – MY WOMAN [2016]\n\nAn eternal blush from a love-stricken patron warms an entire late night diner.\n\n~~\n\nRetro-touched diner ballads + pump up love songs. Maybe all I can think of is the roller rink from the “Shut Up Kiss Me” video, but I can see this working really well in some roller rink scene in an old movie. At times MY WOMAN taps into the raw emotions of Olsen’s debut Strange Cacti, but in a much more polished and down to earth way. Come for “Shut Up Kiss Me”, stay for the sequence of “Sister” + “Those Were The Days” + “Woman”.\n\n154. BIG THIEF – Two Hands [2019]\n\nDoing karate in the woods by yourself and a courier brings you a fruit basket.\n\n~~\n\nRollicking and confident indie rock that has one of the decade’s best songs (“Not”) on it. I say confident, but only in the scope of Big Thief’s previous work, which has prided itself of ramping up and paying off with anxiety-laden rock tracks. These songs are still vulnerable, but they’re relatively straightforward and sounds almost celebratory at times. The trio of “Those Girls” + “Shoulders” + “Not” is a three-course meal of big feelings.\n\n153. CHARLI XCX – Charli [2019]\n\nGoing so fast in a car that realities begin to separate, splitting your consciousness between an ultra-futuristic, utopic society and one built out of your neuroses and paranoia.\n\n~~\n\nCharli XCX established herself as the bastion pop hero of the 10s by releasing radically experimental and infectious projects. Her first proper LP in this new era of Charli is fantastic and follows up on the high expectations set by Pop 2. If this album had a few less tracks, it would be near-perfect, probably on Pop 2 level. The songs I like less on the record bring it down a few pegs (which is saying something, considering the songs I do like are mind blowingly good), but overall it’s got some truly remarkable pop songs here. The first six songs are near-untouchable levels of good.\n\n152. SMERZ – Have fun EP [2018]\n\nAcross a foggy, strobe-lit club, a dancer stares at you intimidatingly.\n\n~~\n\nBrutally cool. Smerz create an atmosphere like no other on their releases but especially so on Have fun, where the duo pair shattering, blown out bass with vocals that almost sound bored. They’re just barely there; lyrics slowly being uttered by the two singers like they couldn’t care less if you were listening or not. That’s so damn cool. Meanwhile, the instrumentals feel like an aggressive bouncer most times, making their presence felt with girthy thumps of bass and head-rattling metallic sound effects. The chaos from the instrumentals paired with this unaffected delivery makes for a fantastic foil, like filing your nails in a collapsing elevator shaft.\n\n151. MY BLOODY VALENTINE – mbv [2013]\n\nSmearing a human soul on a slide and observing it under a microscope.\n\n~~\n\nSometimes I think that I don’t like this record anymore. Then all the other times I’m like hell yeah, My Bloody Valentine put out another record and it’s got some straight up bangers on it. What would you call a shoegaze banger? A question for another day that needs a team of at least 10 scientists and likely a specific French Canadian shoegaze master. MBV delivers another classic album where the guitars sound like nothing else. Also, it’s widely agreed upon that they sampled an jet engine for “wonder 2”, right? If not, that’s impressive. I’m definitely a fan of the first half over the second, but the legends themselves were able to put out a solid record this decade. Props to them.\n\n150. FRANK OCEAN – Blonde [2016]\n\nGetting emotional thinking about life while sitting in a hot tub overlooking the city.\n\n~~\n\nI’m not the biggest fan of Blonde, but it certainly has its deserved place in the scope of the 10s. The endless clamoring for a new Frank album really did yield something that Gen Z’ers will consider a timeless classic. I’m gonna stop acting high and mighty now, cause that’s corny as hell. It’s a solid album, that’s for sure. “Nights” is the obvious jam for me, “Close to You” is killer, “Nikes” of course. Chances are you’ve listened to this already. Granted the day it came out I was the sickest I had been all decade, so it still reminds me of that gross period. I’m sure once I listen to this even more it’ll connect. I’m sure.\n\n149. FUTURE ISLANDS – In Evening Air [2010]\n\nRunning through nine cinder block walls at full speed and emerging unscathed.\n\n~~\n\nKind of funny to look back at reviews of this album and see how mixed critics were about it. Little did they know Future Islands would be one of the more talked-about bands of the mid-decade. Yes some of the songs feel samey-samey, but I feel like vocalist Sam Herring is at his most untamed here, making for more dynamic and engaging tracks. He’s just letting it all go on tracks like “Vireo’s Eye” and “Long Flight”. It may not have the instant hit-ness of Singles but man it’s got slow burn classics that I’ve returned to more than Singles over the course of the decade.\n\n148. DJ KOZE – Knock Knock [2018]\n\nLaying in the bed of a pickup truck, you watch the skies change hue, listen to different sounds coming out of passing cars, and feel the terrain changing around you as you make your way across the country to visit an old friend.\n\n~~\n\nMan this album is FUN. This was a go-to summer album in 2018 and 2019, bringing a casual bounce and breeze to all of my commutes. The specific set of sounds that Koze pulls from on this album tends to make a few of the tracks blur together, but the ones that really strike a chord are inescapable, “Pick Up” being the main favorite. “Illumination” feat. Róisín Murphy is my favorite – again, great bounce! Put this on once the weather starts to improve and watch your commute become an enjoyable jaunt down city streets.\n\n147. CROSS RECORD – Wabi Sabi [2016]\n\nA small, candle-lit hot air balloon carrying an ancient inscription lofts over an angry sea and into a dark, storm-threatening sky.\n\n~~\n\nAlmost mythical sounding music. Bass drums boom far in the distance (“The Depths”). Smoky choirs of disembodied voices shriek forebodingly (“Basket”). Guitar melodies arc and twirl in the sky like lightning, with booming, thunder-like percussion following quickly after over a turbulent sea. Drowsy synth loops rumble beneath (“Lemon”). Wabi-Sabi carries all these cinematic and mysterious qualities, elevating it over so many potentially similar sounding indie rock / whatever-you-wanna-box-this-into-genre-music and making it into a special, memorable experience. If I ever wanna lay my angst down on record, I wanna do it like this. Like invoking the raw power of an old god from the great beyond.\n\n146. KELELA – CUT 4 ME [2013]\n\nA chance encounter on the interplanetary space station yields one night of interspecies romance in the glow of distant star systems.\n\n~~\n\nThe best thing to come out of the Fade to Mind / Night Slugs explosion of 2011 – 2015. Stellar “futuristic” R&B record with booming bass, dark/non-traditional textures and a bit of “deconstructed club” atmosphere morphed into great vehicles for Kelela’s voice. The whole project is great, but “Bank Head” is the one to stay for. One of the best songs of the decade.\n\n145. JENNY HVAL – The Practice of Love [2019]\n\nBeing engulfed by the folds of a Georgia O’Keeffe painting.\n\n~~\n\nWhile I would love for this album to be a bit longer, the songs that Jenny Hval did offer us here border on a body-freeing quality of sublimity that I haven’t found in much other modern music, aside from Hval’s 2016 record Blood Bitch, funnily enough. Something about the combination of smoky, mystifying synths and the pillowy voice of Hval’s makes for a totally intoxicating experience, even when she’s plunging into topics such as birth, the role of reproduction in society and abortion.\n\n144. WEDNESDAY CAMPANELLA – Superman [2017]\n\nThe ecstatic energy of a prideful parade, unironic and shining, as droves of dancers armed with confetti cannons strut their way down the avenue.\n\n~~\n\nIf you’re a fan of modern, hyperactive pop music, you owe it to yourself to listen to this. Yes, the lyrics are in Japanese. That part doesn’t matter thanks to the vivacity of lead singer KOM_I, who traipses around these futuristic fanfares like they’re bouncy furniture. Nearly every song is a direct plunge of pleasure into the brain. If you’re like me, you’ll find yourself smiling multiple times through your first listen. I only started listening to this a few months ago, so I anticipate I’m only going to keep liking it more and more. But like I said – any and all pop music fans need this in their lives.\n\n143. CHRISTINE & THE QUEENS – Chris [2018]\n\nUltimate naked lip-syncing post-shower in a foggy mirror moment compilation.\n\n~~\n\nHoo-wee. Thanks to Chris’ background being a dancer, her music is almost optimized for movement. It rolls, bounces and strikes poses, granting confidence to any listener. It’s hard not to get a little pep in your step while listening, or even just singing along once you know the words. It calls back to killer, dance-friendly pop of the 80s and early 90s a la Janet Jackson and Madonna, but definitely feels like it was made for this decade and beyond.\n\n142. GROUPER – Grid of Points [2018]\n\nAfter a hard, summer rain, steam rises from a clearing that’s been ravaged by wildfires.\n\n~~\n\nGrouper at her most minimal. Almost entirely just voice and piano, Grid of Points still sounds like Grouper, as it’s drenched in fog and allows Liz Harris’ voice to mesh into the echoing piano so everything arrives in a calming wave. Not to say everything is homogenous, but rather it’s intoxicating to be immersed in this cloud of sound.\n\n141. SUN ARAW – On Patrol [2010]\n\nHaving an out of body experience while stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the hottest day of the year.\n\n~~\n\nHave you ever listened to an album and thought “man this sounds sweaty”. A lot of Sun Araw’s early work carries that enviable(?) and unique quality: the ability to bring humidity purely in the aural sense. These are some gorgeous, long-form psych jams. The dark, murky universe that Sun Araw creates on this record is unlike anything I’ve heard this decade. Sticky, bubbling, broken air conditioner music. Sweat soaked through shirts. Closing out all other senses just to survive in the heat. Zoning in on the prize only. I used to write all my papers to this during my senior year of college, especially the nearly 17-minute closer “Holodeck Blues”, featuring furious hand percussion, melting guitars and a barn-burning finale for the ages.\n\n140. PANDA BEAR – Tomboy [2011]\n\nWatching wave after wave of colorful, hypnotizing marine life pass in front of your eyes in large, cylindrical fish tank.\n\n~~\n\nThe string of singles that this record produced are near perfect. The rest of the album is just alright, but damn – “Alsatian Darn”, “Tomboy”, “You Can Count On Me”, “Surfer’s Hymn”… these are all fantastic tunes. I think the more I’ve gotten into Person Pitch and the more Panda Bear’s more recent material has faded in affinity for me, the more Tomboy has gone up in my eyes. It’s a gorgeous, swirling psychedelic record that’s really the only Animal Collective-related thing that came out this decade that I can reliably listen to.\n\n139. SWEARIN’ – Swearin’ [2012]\n\nThrowing a couch off a rooftop into a swimming pool, then comically laying on it underwater.\n\n~~\n\nIf there’s an upbeat song on this record, chances are high that there’s an unreal hook or riff or melody in it. The hits just don’t stop coming on this record. The string from “1” to “Shrinking Violet” is just hit after hit. Nothing wrong with “Divine Mimosa” but all the other songs are just power pop perfection. Then “Hundreds and Thousands” to “Kill em With Kindness”? Mwah. Perfection. Amazing. This record is stupid good. Power pop classic. Love this band to death. Don’t really listen to much like it though. People – recommend me similar records to this. I bet they’re not as good as this one 😉\n\n138. DANNY BROWN – Atrocity Exhibition [2016]\n\nBeing thrown down a well that’s lined with fuzzy CRT television sets all showing surveillance footage of you trapped in said well.\n\n~~\n\nDark and dusty, damp and moldy, breakneck and decrepit. These adjectives come together on a hip hop record that nearly made Danny Brown broke via clearing samples. I know it’s a cliche to say “take a look into my twisted mind”, but this is really feels like one of those moments. Intense krautrock and psych samples mixed with signature Detroit grittiness Brown is known for. Sounds like years of partying has caught up to him and the paranoia has set in. No way paranoia has sounded this fun to dance along to. Also, the man sampled Indonesian gamelan music. He’s in the clear for life in my opinion.\n\n137. BEACH HOUSE – Depression Cherry [2015]\n\nThe feeling of descending the longest, most beautiful, jewel-encrusted, red carpet-lined staircase ever created in front of your adoring partner.\n\n~~\n\nI think Depression Cherry is a misleading album title for this record. I don’t really associate it with being depressed at all, but more an overwhelming romantic sensation; one that rockets your conscious up into the stratosphere to float freely among space debris. Beach House continue to be up to their old tricks on this record and make some of the best songs of their career on it (see “Levitation”, “Sparks” and “Days of Candy”). If anything, I think the last song there would have fit best as an album name. It conjures up images of an alternate dimension perhaps, one of vast sweetness. Or perhaps visions of days that contained that honeyed feeling gone by. Either way, it’s another entry into Beach House’s near-perfect discography of syrupy love jams.\n\n136. BRAIDS – Deep in the Iris [2015]\n\nPassing sunlight through assorted crystals and sketching floral arrangements in the casted colorful prisms of light on the ground.\n\n~~\n\nOne of the best synth pop records of the decade without a question! Although they elevate past the pure “synth pop” tag with lovely piano arrangements and effective percussion on every song, Braids pack powerful statements in songs that appear small but are really large in scope. Does that make sense? I mean that most of these songs are comprised of short, choppy instrumentation, but really blow the doors open when vocalist Raphaelle Standell-Preston lets her soaring voice loose. “Sore Eyes” is my favorite jam on this!\n\n135. DNTEL – Human Voice [2014]\n\nCreating complex sequences with a synthesizer that’s plugged into a human brain watching roller coaster POV videos.\n\n~~\n\nPurely instrumental electronic bliss with a sly dip into LA beat scene. Highly computerized sounding but human in approach. Sounds blip and bop in arranged routines but the little variations bring it all down to human level. The song “Connections” has a deep and personal connection to me – I listen to it all the time. The two songs that follow it are also fantastic. Also for those that don’t know – Dntel is the non-Ben Gibbard half of The Postal Service. So if you dig the micro-beats on that project, you might like this!\n\n134. (SANDY) ALEX G – House of Sugar [2019]\n\nYou return to the secluded wooded spot that you retreated to as a child to play with imaginary friends to find that it’s been clear-cut for a new suburb.\n\n~~\n\nIt has its odd bruises like any old piece of fruit, but it also has its crisp, sweet taste and bountiful juices that run down your chin. House of Sugar contains both (Sandy) Alex G’s strangest and most accessible material. “Gretel” is a banger for the ages. “Bad Man” is divisive to say the least. In the end though, it’s undeniably Alex G, one of the most vital songwriters of this decade.\n\n133. THE WEEKND – House of Balloons [2011]\n\nBeing brought to a dark basement club where the floor is made of some outrageously soft, stretchy substance, making you feel like you’re sinking into the floor with every step.\n\n~~\n\nI remember thinking this was the coolest thing of all time when it first came out. A mysterious R&B singer from Canada dropped an album for free with songs about drug use, sex and dark consequences all paired with downtempo, sultry instrumentals that just ooze cool. Not to mention the samples on this thing: Beach House (twice!), Siouxsie and the Banshees, Aaliyah and Cocteau Twins. For someone that wasn’t well-versed in R&B (and guess what, I’m still not), this blew my mind. It was clearly an outlier in what I listened to at the time, but it definitely opened the door to my taste now. This will always be the GOAT in The Weeknd’s catalog, for my money.\n\n132. WAXAHATCHEE – American Weekend [2012]\n\nSeeing friends you haven’t seen for a very long time and it didn’t bring the happiness that you thought it’d bring.\n\n~~\n\nA homespun collection of hushed acoustic tunes, the world’s first taste of one of the decade’s finest songwriters, Waxahatchee. She went on to embrace a full rock band sound with her following record, but the stripped back and lo-fi quality of this release makes the confessional and emotionally ravaging songs that much more personal. “Noccalula” still hits me right in the heart. Also fun fact for those who don’t know, Waxahatchee (Katie Crutchfield) is the twin sister of Swearin’s Allison Crutchfield. Likely the only twin siblings on this list. Shout out to the Crutchfields, for real. They ruled this dang decade.\n\n131. JAMES BLAKE – James Blake [2011]\n\nThe power going out in an elevator with facing mirrors leads you to having conversations with your infinitely-repeating reflections in the dark.\n\n~~\n\nThis is another record that blew my mind in high school. Soulful crooning over spacious piano and spare electronics. Felt like I was entering into some mirrored world where time stopped. It also helped change my mind about autotune. I feel like this was around the time that I hated hearing autotune on the radio and this helped me recognize its potential as a tool to shape the human voice into alien formations, removing its natural humanity. This release alone has spawned so many copycats, but nothing even comes close to this crowning achievement.\n\n130. DEAN BLUNT – Black Metal [2014]\n\nA country star is caught in a drug deal gone wrong, leaving them stranded in the darkest corners of a sprawling metropolis to fend for themselves.\n\n~~\n\nI’m not as well-versed in Dean Blunt lore as much as other people I know, but I do know that this album is really, really great. Blunt jumps from genre to genre but keeps the whole thing sounding cohesive. I feel like that sentence makes sense on paper for any artist, but you gotta hear how many sounds and ideas are present on this record. How the hell do you get to a minimal grime instrumental from a lush acoustic ballad? Like my little description above, you get roped into this descent from a glitzy, polished album into a dark experimental corner of broken electronics and ominous vocals & rapping. It’s a chameleon act that gets better after every listen.\n\n129. LITTLE SIMZ – GREY Area [2019]\n\nAn in-depth profile of a local clique boss that’s beloved in their community, showing off their harsh edges but also their tender sides hidden behind closed doors.\n\n~~\n\nBursting with confidence but not cowardly enough to confront their nightmares, Little Simz made one of the most essential hip hop records of this decade with GREY Area. Not only is the record bold in lyrical content but it spreads itself out among a variety of great instrumentals and guest features. Each song has its own character and they all shine. It’s a beautiful, irony-free statement that makes me feel grateful it exists after every listen.\n\n128. ANGEL OLSEN – Strange Cacti [2010]\n\nThe dizzy feeling of counting stars for an entire night, feeling small and insignificant but also at peace with the universe.\n\n~~\n\nImagine being so filled with lofty romantic ideas or fantasies that you being floating away into the sky? Or becoming so drunk with feelings that you can’t help but stumbling down into a bush, but you don’t even notice? Angel Olsen is SO emotive in her vocal delivery on this project, it’s like her feelings are just spilling over from her brain. Pair that with the lo-fi quality of the recording, you’ve got a ghostly call from another world pouring out the remainder of their soul to a chosen audience member. The first transmission from Olsen is one that has matured well over time – I highly recommend revisiting this if you haven’t in a while.\n\n127. ANDY SHAUF – The Party [2016]\n\nPicking up the coat that smells of the vintage velvet couch it rested on all night. Blown-out candles linger in the air, the glossy feeling of playing cards slip from fingers, you’re standing alone in the kitchen finishing your drink while groups of laughter and goodbyes burst from the foyer.\n\n~~\n\nThe Party somehow able to synthesize palpable feelings that stem from common interactions at any party you could ever attend. It shouldn’t be surprising; the album is literally called The Party. What else did you expect? Andy Shauf is able to do this thanks to his impeccable narrative songwriting, keeping us entertained with main characters that pop up throughout the length of the record, all exhibiting familiar feelings and actions that we can connect with. The music itself is also masterfully arranged and performed. I can attest that I have never seen people go as hard to soft rock as I did when I saw Andy Shauf and his band live a few years back. It’s subtle grooves that get it going. The pocket is there, but it’s easy to forget about that while you listen to the storytelling.\n\n126. KAITLYN AURELIA SMITH – EARS [2016]\n\nThickets of beautiful coral grow in the inner folds of your brain’s hemispheres.\n\n~~\n\nPacked full of peculiar sounds and inquisitive synth explorations, EARS charmed the hell out of me in 2016. One of the few bright spots from that year on this list. With fusions of bubbling modular synthesis and organic elements like voice, winds and wooden percussion, Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith created an aural landscape that’s easy to get lost in. Every song feels like it unfurls naturally, like there’s no other way this chord progression or melodic shift could have happened except for the way it did.\n\n125. COLIN STETSON & SARAH NEUFELD – Never Were The Way She Was [2015]\n\nThe brutal, yet calculated duel between snake and mongoose.\n\n~~\n\nA balancing act between two forces of nature. This record is almost entirely saxophone and violin-based, constantly intertwining and disengaging like sand in the wind. With the thumping crush of Colin Stetson’s dynamic sax playing and Sarah Neufeld’s ethereal, long strokes of violin, the two paint a pained, eternally feuding portrait that is impossible to turn away from. They complement each other, but also stand out and fight for the spotlight in knotting passages of pure, bubbling anxiety. Two stars racing against time.\n\n124. TODD TERJE – It’s Album Time [2014]\n\nAn autonomous silk suit encrusted in mirror shards boogies and slides its way through tropical parties to find its chosen owner.\n\n~~\n\nCondensed party in a jar. Although its glitziness has faded a bit for me and three of the tracks were featured on an earlier EP, there’s no denying some of these monster grooves on here makes this a classic album of the decade. “Inspector Norse” is the most obvious one. I will dance to that song til I die. “Johnny and Mary” had its moment for me when I was in college. “Strandbar” and “Delorean Dynamite” are white hot jammers. It’s not something I can listen to all the time, but when its time is right, it’s album time. Eyyyyy.\n\n123. ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER – Replica [2011]\n\nLucid dreaming yourself flying into a vat of toxic waste runoff from old TVs.\n\n~~\n\nMy first real dive into Oneohtrix Point Never was a VHS-fueled nightmare scape. Actually though – the fact that this entire album was made from samples of old VHS tapes still blows me away. It sounds nothing like that. It sounds like a fuzzy sci-fi world where everyone’s too bloated on media consumption and a thick, Silent Hill-like fog gathers around eternally-on television screens. There are some pretty moments, but most feel like they’re trying to grasp onto something very temporary, continually fading away.\n\n122. ROMAN À CLEF – Abandonware [2015]\n\nSpeeding down the quaint roads of your hometown on a moped on the days leading up to your 20-year high school anniversary.\n\n~~\n\nI think a total of like five people I know will be psyched about this record being so high up, or being on this list at all. What can I say? I’m a sucker for Prefab Sprout and these guys have executed the best faithful recreation. It’s wistful and romantic and has a great sense of humor about itself – they definitely know they’re channeling Sprout here. Yes it’s corny at times, but the hooks and catchiness is certainly there. It even reminds me of music featured in the first two Katamari Damacy games, which is one of the best compliments I can give.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJjGZkPl9Tw It’s a fabulous throwback to luscious sophistipop, what is there not to like?\n\n121. FEVER RAY – Plunge [2017]\n\nA human frozen alive for the past 80 years is thawed and experiences culture shock upon viewing the hedonistic behavior of today’s society, eventually succumbing to the overwhelming carnal pleasures.\n\n~~\n\nYou should have seen my face when I found out that Fever Ray was releasing a new album that year. You could have powered a small town in rural America with that beaming smile. The best part though is that I still love the record. It’s a bountiful celebration and revolution all rolled into one. Karin Dreijer sounds like she’s having the most fun of her life on here, with highly suggestive lyrics, obtuse sound effects and a liberal smattering of percussion. The last The Knife album unfortunately hasn’t stuck with me, but this has.\n\n120. ANGEL OLSEN – Burn Your Fire For No Witness [2013]\n\nAn old-time radio plays classics in a high school gymnasium, with one couple alone dancing and recounting stories of their love.\n\n~~\n\nSeems like with this release Angel Olsen really stepped out and said “yep, this is my sound. You best be paying attention to me or else I’ll make you pay”. Bonafide killer rock tracks like “Forgiven/Forgotten” and “Hi-Five” flip to slow-burning torch songs like “White Fire” and “Dance Slow Decades”. And I couldn’t get away without mentioning the anthemic “Unfucktheworld”. Also feeling grateful for Angel Olsen this decade. Thank you Angel!\n\n119. YO LA TENGO – Fade [2013]\n\nGoing grocery shopping on a sunny Sunday morning to make a lovely dinner for friends coming over later in the week.\n\n~~\n\nMaybe I’m just a hopeless fan, but I really do think that Yo La Tengo can do no wrong. How they were able to write so many classic-sounding songs this late into their career is amazing to me. “Ohm” is the massive standout for me, but songs like “Paddle Forward”, “Stupid Things”, “Before We Run”, “Well You Better” and “Cornelia and Jane” are on my must-hear-played-live list. No other band out there that makes me feel so at peace.\n\n118. U.S. GIRLS – Half Free [2015]\n\nA widow whose partner died fighting overseas enacts a revenge plot on their negligent superiors.\n\n~~\n\nPsychedelic nightmare pop. Bittersweet, ultra dramatic, noir/Chinatown-like vibes with a good dose of psychedelia thrown in. U.S. Girls bring the heat on nearly every track, combining a multitude of genres into swirling, vengeful storytelling courtesy of front person Meg Remy. Her lyrics and storytelling are incredibly vivid, and the way she sings just lights a fire and reminds me of the rage boiling in the heroines of exploitation movies from the 70s and 80s. Combustive guitars (check out “Navy & Cream” – the guitar solos on that are i n s a n e), paranoid sparking synths, cut-you-in-half shrillness. It’s a thrill ride.\n\n117. TIM HECKER – Virgins [2013]\n\nFrom atop a dark tower, a hulking titan made of stone and steel robotically forges together ornate chandeliers of diamonds, pearls and other gemstones.\n\n~~\n\nTim Hecker once again created a world like no other on this album, this time making sounds that are akin to those in a glass-cutting factory or some similar industrial setting where small, sharp objects are being created. Like being thrust into a chute of metal shards and drifting in and out of consciousness. Brash horns blare at you at times, harsh, metallic piano corners you, thunderous blasts of distortion knock you off your feet. There are moments of peace, but it’s short-lived once the gears start turning again.\n\n116. THE RADIO DEPT. – Clinging to a Scheme [2011]\n\nGrowing a thriving palm tree in a place not usually hospitable for them, bringing you constant, coastal-tinged joy.\n\n~~\n\nThese folks from Sweden sure can make summery, shining music. I guess they have to harness all the sunlight they can before they go into almost complete darkness for part of the year. A go-to for me for almost every summer this decade. Songs on here just feel GOOD. Groovy, unironic slices of dream pop heaven.\n\n115. SHARON VAN ETTEN – Are We There [2014]\n\nSitting in a waiting room, regulating your breathing in anticipation of hearing a potentially life-changing verdict.\n\n~~\n\nSharon Van Etten knows how to put aching into song. Ache from emotional toil, ache from uncertainty, ache from lovesickness, ache from strained capabilities, ache from knowing something is over, ache from confusion. She conveys all these things so beautifully and so artistically, layered with harmonies and effective arrangements. It’s multiple darts straight to the heart, with each song punching you in a different way. I once had a friend ask me “so why do you even listen to sad music? Why make yourself sad like that?” Well, it’s beautiful to be sad sometimes.\n\n114. CHRISTIAN SCOTT ATUNDE ADJUAH – Ancestral Recall [2019]\n\nAncient alchemy brings to life a humanoid figure made of diamonds and jewels for an astral dance ceremony that happens once every 1000 years.\n\n~~\n\nThis record will make you love the trumpet. I almost 100% guarantee it. This record’s shrieking trumpet damn near made me cry on the subway. Such beautiful rhythms and sounds on this record. The sound of a vision being captured. Big shout out to Saul Williams for all his spoken word work on this as well.\n\n113. MAJICAL CLOUDZ – Impersonator [2013]\n\nA future version of yourself travels back in time to tell yourself as a child they’ll always be alone.\n\n~~\n\nA peek into a world that we wish lasted a bit longer. Majical Cloudz debut bottles a very distinct mood. It’s like you feel like you’re in a dark room alone, but you could be outside on a beautiful, sunny day. It’s an isolating album that’s lovesick as hell and has no cure. Its heartbroken nature will never cease. It’s like the character Florentino Ariza in Gabriel García-Márquez’s novel Love In The Time Of Cholera, who ravenously eats the flowers he wanted give his love interest if she didn’t reject him, only to get sick on the beach. For the true sad folks out there.\n\n112. CLOUD NOTHINGS – Attack On Memory [2012]\n\nThe sudden, crashing, aggravating realization that you will never amount to anything, no matter how hard you try or how much time you have.\n\n~~\n\nMaybe my Warm Vision description above is a bit too harsh, but it really does feel like all the aggression powering this record is from a feeling of uselessness. It’s a theme on the record with song names like “Stay Useless”, “Wasted Days” and “No Future / No Past”. The kicking and thrashing and self-flagellating sarcasm that comes with years of complacency and laziness. Well, the hate that powers that machine can make one hell of a rock record. Also, putting a near 9-minute titan jammer as the second song of a record is also one hell of a statement.\n\n111. DAUGHTERS – You Won’t Get What You Want [2018]\n\nBeing trapped in a haunted house for 12 hours with intensely vengeful spirits, intent on constantly torturing you to the edge of consciousness until morning.\n\n~~\n\nA pure hurricane of rage, confusion and hopelessness. Further pushing the finish line away during a mental breakdown. Raw intensity being shoved in the listener’s face for nearly 50 minutes. And when the record isn’t trying to tear your head off, it’s just making you nervous about the next time it will attempt to. It all culminates in one of the best album closers of all time, “Guest House”, which never fails at giving me goosebumps.\n\n110. EMERALDS – Does It Look Like I’m Here? [2010]\n\nUploading your brain into the cloud just for fun.\n\n~~\n\nI remember this record blowing my mind in high school. I think the blog Drowned In Sound named it their top album of 2010, so during my independent study in the library I decided to try and listen to it. Immediately I knew I was in over my head. The most electronic music I had listened to up until that point was Burial. This was some heady, chugging, psychedelic computer music. It wasn’t until later I started noticing guitars in here. Then to just let go and let the music overtake you. A sublime instrumental trip into the ether. At times a perfect simulation of ideal weather scenarios, beamed in from a super computer that loves jam bands, space rock and Sun Ra.\n\n109. VARIOUS ARTISTS – Mono No Aware [2017]\n\nA series of instrumental suites set to dreams of rooms.\n\n~~\n\nThe only compilation that made this list! While it does have tracks from established experimental mavens like Yves Tumor and M.E.S.H., it gave a chance to newer artists like Malibu, Kareem Lotfy, Oli XL, Sky H1 and more to kickstart their profiles. Some of the best ambient and experimental bites I’ve heard all decade. To zone out to this album is like nothing else. I had some pretty revelatory moments with this record in the year it came out, depressed out of my noggin on my slow-as-dirt morning J-train commute. It probably kept me going – another day is just another excuse to listen to this great record. PAN did something really special with this release and I am eternally thankful for it.\n\n108. ALDOUS HARDING – Designer [2019]\n\nHaving an existential crisis after meeting an ersatz version of yourself on vacation.\n\n~~\n\nWhile not as electric as Harding’s sophomore record Party, Designer cements her as an absolutely essential and completely unique songwriter of the 10s. Her knack for making anxiety in woozy, uncertain moments sound beautiful is near-unparalleled. Basically the whole back half of the record sounds like it was being sung from the gallows by a court jester looking for a pardon but knows they won’t get one.\n\n107. PREOCCUPATIONS – Viet Cong [2015]\n\nA bleak factory with no specific purpose where people pull pointless levers & press inactive buttons all day, but everyone goes home satisfied. Eventually they all die and are easily replaced.\n\n~~\n\nCan a record still be good if the mental imagery that’s conjured is that of a towering cinderblock wall? An endless expanse of grey. It doesn’t help that the cover is greyscale. It also doesn’t help that the music is bleak as hell. But man, does it slap. Post punk for the ages right here, with plenty of personality (or lack of it? Post punk politics are weird, man). Throws a bunch of curveballs in songs (much appreciated in a post punk record, for real! The politics again my gaahh!) like “March of Progress”, “Silhouettes” and “Newspaper Spoons”. And who could forget the hits “Continental Shelf” and the hulking “Death”? My affection for post punk my have waned as the decade progressed but this record can still bring a tear out of my brutalist-free heart.\n\n106. SKEE MASK – Compro [2018]\n\nLike being strapped inside a metal box that has one small window to look out of and being pushed down a large, snowy mountain.\n\n~~\n\nI’ve said it in every blurb I’ve written about this album: the SOUNDS. To this day the volleys of bass in “Rev8617” get me amped. The breakbeats in “Kozmic Flush” or “Soundboy Ext.”, the washes of synth in “Via Sub Mids” or “Flyby VFR” just push all the right buttons in my pleasure centers. I’ve binged the hell out of this record so many times since its release and I have yet to get tired of it. I can only assume it will grow in favor as time passes and all new electronic records have to compare to this. Sorry, other records!\n\n105. ERIKA DE CASIER – Essentials [2019]\n\nTaking an aromatic bubble bath after a night at the club and sending texts to your exes that you’re having fun without them.\n\n~~\n\nLush Y2K-era R&B instrumentals thrust into 2019? Usually I’d say “hmmm nope” but this is so damn satisfying to listen to. The songs are expertly arranged with all the best detailed flourishes, whether it be a water sound effect here, a camera lens sound effect there, weepy synthetic strings in the background, LCD screen bass, or Timbaland-like keys. It’s all there and it’s all beautiful.\n\n104. DEMEN – Nektyr [2017]\n\nUnderneath the old clock tower lies a pitch-black portal to another dimension. A dark, dripping hand slowly extends from the gaping opening after you recite the incantation.\n\n~~\n\nThe enigmatic Demen only has this record to their name. It’s a damn good one. It’s ultra-dark, shapeless dream pop similar to Cocteau Twins on tranquilizers or This Mortal Coil. It feels like it was summoned from an ancient cauldron. One interesting thing about this darkness is that it doesn’t weigh you down like some goth records do. It acts more like a thick smoke, enveloping you in a hazy space where the senses are marred. Only acceptance until the storm passes will suffice.\n\n103. CHROMATICS – Kill For Love [2012]\n\nIn the hours before dawn, you follow a trail of notes and clues left by a thought-to-be-deceased lover, leading you to the house of mirrors where the partner had been supposedly murdered.\n\n~~\n\nStarting off a record with a Neil Young cover: bold. Making an album over 90 minutes: bolder. Making a 90-minute album that’s so engaging that the listener usually wants to finish the whole thing: man you’re so super bold right now. Chromatics essentially made a cult classic film in album form with Kill For Love, further entrenching a ravenous fanbase outfitted in too-cool-for-school merch. And I get it, clearly. I own a Chromatics sweatshirt. This is like the movie Drive with extended scenes. A romantic trawl trapped in an hourglass. The first half is obviously stacked with the hits, but the second half packs in cinematic cuts that the band is known for. Name another band that captures Chromatics’ sound that’s not directly associated with the band. No one.\n\n102. GROUPER – The Man Who Died In His Boat [2013]\n\nThe sound of wind and snow banging against wooden shutters on a solemn, solitary night.\n\n~~\n\nA nice middle ground between Grouper’s ambient and folky material. Some songs are more like her breakout Dragging A Dead Deer Up A Hill, where some are purely instrumental bliss drifts like in her A|A series. At times it sounds like a harsh winter storm ravaging the boards of an old house, other times it sounds like a peaceful current on a placid beach. That’s the beauty of Grouper, always versatile with solitary situations.\n\n101. OVLOV – Am [2013]\n\nThe joy and exhaustion that comes from sledding down a giant hill for an entire night.\n\n~~\n\nOne of the best rock records of the decade, it’s a shame more people don’t know about it. Connecticut’s great Ovlov really hit it home on their debut, stocked full of ultra-crunchy guitars, blown out drums and a mastery of building tension like on song “Where’s My Dini?”. An obvious comparison would be Dinosaur Jr so if you dig them, don’t wait! This album will blow your socks off.\n\n100. KELLY LEE OWENS – Kelly Lee Owens [2017]\n\nFlying down a tunnel in a high-speed rail, the blinking lights in the darkened passageway craft a symphony of color and rhythm.\n\n~~\n\nA deeper electronic record than at first glance. Each song houses a litany of polyrhythmic beats and sounds that are played off so cool that you barely notice them. But if you listen hard, you’ll start to lock in to the overlaying synth passages, the rising and falling textures, and the minimal electronic beats. Like being lulled into a trance by pulsating lights.\n\n99. CHINO AMOBI – PARADISO [2017]\n\nIn the year 2017, the entire history of humanity and its culture is rebuilt and destroyed in a cataclysmic flash. The process is documented via a team of artists and antagonized by cannibalistic radio hosts.\n\n~~\n\nRadical in its approach. Even now when I listen to PARADISO I say damn, this is hard. The mix of spoken word, poetry, fiery rhetoric and incomprehensible babbling with slabs of chaotic noise, booming horns, signs of the apocalypse and more flying overhead make for a record unlike any other on this list. I could listen to this on a bright and shiny day and think it was raining hellfire outside. The title track continues to be one of my all-time favorites. Keep this in your rotation as world turns to hell in 2020.\n\n98. DEAFHEAVEN – Sunbather [2013]\n\nWhile skydiving, the Earth moves further away from you, infinitely elongating your exhilarating descent.\n\n~~\n\nMy intro to actually liking metal and I’m assuming the same for so many others. Pummeling black metal that pivots between feelings of triumph, melancholia, frustration and anger, mixed with elements of shoegaze, post-rock and other styles of hard rock. It’s an overwhelming listen that’s buffered by three interlude tracks, offering a respite in the deluge. I honestly don’t care about the politics behind black metal or whatever, I just love this album because it gets me pumped the hell up, a bit emotional (the shrieked vocals are so effective) and it’s just so satisfyingly well-made.\n\n97. NICK CAVE & THE BAD SEEDS – Push The Sky Away [2013]\n\nTaking a steamboat ride up a river and listening to the mad tales of woe regaled to you from the eccentric sailors along the coastlines.\n\n~~\n\nAnother iconic album from Australia’s dark poet. Pretty minimal and bluesy for the most part, with most instrumentation coming in the form of flinty bass lines, wispy strings (courtesy of the unmistakable Warren Ellis) and fragments of rock-formed guitars. We all know the true star is Nick Cave, though, and oh does he shine. His narratives are as sharp as ever and the arrangements are top-notch. When he wants to get cool, he gets cool. When he wants to open up, it’s all open. I came onto Cave’s music late. I’d say this is a pretty decent starting point if this does sound interesting to you. Minimal goth blues from one of the all-time great lyricists.\n\n96. (SANDY) ALEX G – DSU [2014]\n\nA child has to be wound with a crank like a motorized toy to execute everyday tasks.\n\n~~\n\nRock that exists in its own universe. Every instrument sounds like it’s just a bit out of tune. The vocals are just a touch off key at times. Some part came in a little late, there’s a few aural scraps here and there that litter up the mix. Despite the superficial issues, you likely can’t stop listening. That was my experience listening to Alex G and DSU for the first time. “Am I hearing this right? What is happening?” I hope I’m not making it sound bad, because it’s just unique. The songs are genuine, honest and emotional. The riffs have a swing to them that most groups don’t have. This is a terrifically unique album that helped breed a new generation of music-makers doing their thing on their own. That’s pretty damn cool.\n\n95. UNKNOWN MORTAL ORCHESTRA – Multi-Love [2015]\n\nA deliriously funky individual has the ability to morph their physical matter into liquid and gas.\n\n~~\n\nTotally sun-baked funk with grooves for days. The production on this album almost makes it feels like it really is totally dried out, but something about that just helps get the listener all warmed up and ready to head bob or tap into the pocket that UMO occupies on these songs. It’s glitzy and glammy without being a tribute act.\n\n94. KELLY MORAN – Ultraviolet [2018]\n\nAn ice castle is constantly destroying and rebuilding itself into different prismatic formations of varying complexity.\n\n~~\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous compositions of prepared piano and some computerized synthesis. Prepared piano is a technique where the performer places objects on top of the strings within the piano to directly change the timbre of the instrument. The result is metallic, harmonium-like tone that sound amazing when bounding across a shifting landscape of colorful electronics. This is an album I’ve been listening to more and more of, each time I find a passage that strikes me differently. Each piece could have its special moment (first it was “Helix”, now it’s “Water Music”, I’m kinda feeling “Halogen” next). Kelly Moran is a fantastic talent that I cannot wait to see grow and flourish in this ever-changing musical landscape.\n\n93. HOP ALONG – Bark Your Head Off, Dog [2018]\n\nGetting so deeply invested in your family’s old, nostalgic stories that you begin to interact with corporeal visions of times long past.\n\n~~\n\nTip your hats to one of the great voices of the decade, that of Hop Along lead singer Frances Quinlan. I’ve known people that bristle against it, but her energetic rasp carries so much emotional weight it basically powers the entire album from front to back. Bark Your Head Off features Hop Along’s most ambitious arrangements, instrumentation and songwriting in their catalog. I think they’re at their best when they get straight to the point since they meld so great together in moments when they’re going the hardest, but any time I can get with Quinlan’s powerhouse is worthy of all the gold in the world.\n\n92. FKA TWIGS – LP1 [2014]\n\nA human being made of pure smoke, collecting and dispersing in a mirrored room.\n\n~~\n\nA dark ballet of seductive electronics and alluring layers of voice. A pop album almost completely in a league of its own. FKA twigs’ debut LP is an exciting collection of R&B/pop tracks that benefit from brilliant production, twigs’ swift, commanding voice. That voice is full of personality, too – there’s no doubt when you’re listening to a twigs song. The way she’s able to emote in these dark songs is something to marvel at for sure.\n\n91. DIRTY PROJECTORS – Swing Lo Magellan [2012]\n\nMaking a silly face at someone across the room at an opportune moment.\n\n~~\n\nWhat the heck is up with the melodies on this record? Dave Longstreth is a a wacky crazy goofy guy when it comes to melodies (we know this). Voices sliding all over the place, randomly locking into oblong harmonies, making themselves at home among instrumentals made from rattling objects you’d find in the pockets of seasonal coats. Compared to the balanced coolness of preceding album Bitte Orca, Swing Lo Magellan sounds like the moment when you let your guard down around a friend you’re becoming closer with. It’s VERY casual, but maybe that’s why I like it so much. Even after the massive indie success that Orca brought them, the band wanted to make a FUN record.\n\n90. FEAR OF MEN – Loom [2014]\n\nDangling upside down from a bridge; the sensations from the intense, powerful current of the river below brings a peerless euphoria.\n\n~~\n\nI’d like to say that Fear of Men are the masters of the “modern jangle”. Sure there’s been jangle pop being made for eons now, but Fear of Men do it in such a way that’s so engaging and thrust into the present. Every song brings a current of unease, a layer of noise to drift below the bright guitars. The drums are intense with a huge emphasis on the cymbals. And finally lead vocals are smooth, yet intense. They command your attention with a cool hand. This and Early Fragments are two great jangle/indie records you need to try this decade.\n\n89. WOMEN – Public Strain [2010]\n\nMaking a snowman out of sawdust that you’ve sanded from your own face.\n\n~~\n\nSour post punk beamed in from another dimension. Everything is warped, bent, broken, shaking, wilted, barely held together. The vocals sound like they’re coming from an ominous stranger down a hallway. The guitars are prickly and volatile, at times engaged in a machine-like sequence of harsh tones, then suddenly breaking out into a frenzy. The whole thing is blanketed in a sense of unease, culminating in fantastic closer “Eyesore”, probably the most straightforward and feel-good song here.\n\n88. BIG THIEF – Capacity [2017]\n\nSitting up in bed after being horizontal for a long amount of time, you punch a pillow over and over until it becomes misshapen and somehow the perfect shape for hugging. You lay back down and hug the pillow.\n\n~~\n\nThe start of a dynasty? Big Thief’s debut Masterpiece was one hell of an introduction, but this really came out with the haymakers: “Shark Smile”, “Capacity”, “Watering”, “Great White Shark” (my personal fav), “Mythological Beauty”, “Haley” and I mean, “Mary”! A decade-defining rock record, I’d say. Along with that, I’d say that these songs also established the band as one of the best live bands to catch this decade, especially when they weren’t regularly going out 30 minutes past their set time. But aside from that – damn. What a band.\n\n87. JULIANNA BARWICK – The Magic Place [2011]\n\nWrapping yourself in a giant comforter in a massive concert hall.\n\n~~\n\nHave you ever wanted to be caressed by countless layers of pillowy voice and sequestered in some peaceful realm? Look no further than The Magic Place, the specific album I told my partner to put on after I got my wisdom teeth taken out. Julianna Barwick’s specialty is building a plush fortress of pleasure with seemingly endless plumes of voice and gentle synths. An incredibly comforting and warm album that belongs in everyone’s library.\n\n86. ALVVAYS – Antisocialites [2017]\n\nA group of teenage friends live out the last weeks of their final suburban summer break in flawlessly attractive fashion. All of them have incredibly complicated relationships with each other, ones that are like, completely believable and real, but we just can’t get into that detail right now, okay?\n\n~~\n\nAlvvays may be simple songwriters, but man can they write a satisfying pop song. These are tunes that instantly become lodged in my brainstem after an inkling of a thought related to the album crosses my mind. Nearly every song on this album has a hook on it that blows my mind every time I listen. I feel obligated to sing along. “Not My Baby”, “Dreams Tonite”, “In Undertow”, “Plimsoll Punks”, “Saved By A Waif”… these are killers!\n\n85. VINCE STAPLES – Big Fish Theory [2017]\n\nIn 2079, a man is having the time of his life in a crumbling Los Angeles, despite the consuming knowledge of the many evils surrounding him.\n\n~~\n\nThe closest something can get to hip house without being hip house. Vince Staples embraces the harsh electronic textures of say, a PC Music camp (shout out to the SOPHIE production on “Yeah Right”) and turns those hard-hitting bursts of bright textures into bouncing West Coast hip hop instrumentals. Although probably not as iconic as Summertime 06, I found myself continually returning to this album with earworms like “Big Fish” and “Bagbak”.\n\n84. SASSY 009 – Do you mind EP [2017]\n\nHolding conflict resolution with facsimiles of friends in an erupting/collapsing volcano.\n\n~~\n\nMy favorite EP of 2017 and one of my largest obsessions since that year. Brutal, unflinching electronic with calm voices that almost mock the listener over top. Very similar to Smerz, who I mentioned earlier in this list, but these instrumentals and arrangements here hit me in a different way. “Pretty baby” has a continued thumping, “Feel me” has an insanely distorted breakdown that destroys me every time. Hopefully this wasn’t just a lightning in a bottle situation – can’t wait for more SASSY music in the future.\n\n83. TIM HECKER – Ravedeath, 1972 [2011]\n\nIn a post-apocalyptic setting, an engineer plays massive, haunting dirges with abandoned city blocks he’s modified into wind tunnels that emit organ-like frequencies.\n\n~~\n\nMaybe my introduction to ambient music. Airy and ambiguous piano recordings thrown into a vacuum to grow and duplicate on their own. Sometimes it sounds like the recording has somehow broken into a single note played on the piano and is examining it on an atomic level, the hidden dynamics and quarks that make up the energy that is used and comes from striking a chord on the piano. Blown out noise rippling against a steel sheet. Alternating between slow passages and intense buildups. Just sounds massive overall, like the world’s largest organ billowing bellyfuls of gusts through an abandoned metropolis.\n\n82. HUNDRED WATERS – The Moon Rang Like A Bell [2014]\n\nManeuvering through an abandoned space station in zero gravity and piecing together the final transmissions of its crew.\n\n~~\n\nHundred Waters have this special ability of making both massive and microscopic songs able to exist in the same space. The way they arrange and produce the electronics makes the album feel like it exists on a such a titanic stage on some moments, like on the incomparable “Murmurs”, the feathered wings of “Cavity”, the floating space of “Innocent”. But then songs like “No Sound” or “Broken Blue” are microcosms of sound, gently murmuring with singer Nicole Miglis’ pure voice. THEN we see tracks that blossom from molecules and particles into full-blown symphonies like on “Seven White Horses”. It’s a mastery of space, dynamics, arrangements and pacing. All this combined with their unique basin of sounds they pull from makes this album a winner. The Moon Rang Like A Bell was my favorite album of 2014 and although it has waned a bit in being my top favorite, it’s still an iconic album for me and deserves everyone’s listening attention.\n\n81. TAME IMPALA – Lonerism [2012]\n\nA carnival attraction where you have to navigate through a nonsensical funhouse of casual acquaintances while wearing lava lamp-like psychedelic shades, distorting the shapes and faces of those that try and strike up a conversation with you.\n\n~~\n\nTame Impala excel at producing super sweet psychedelia. No tang of bitterness, no bumps of sour, no hint of spice, no bite of salt (maybe a bit on “Elephant”). It’s a straight-up sugar rush that will make you feel like the coolest cat on the pavement. A honey-scented ascent into cotton candy clouds. Multi-layered, multi-colored, ever-expanding psychedelic pop rock gum drops. Front person Kevin Parker has to have a secret key to our dopamine centers, because this album is almost unfair in that way it makes us feel so good.\n\n80. BEACH FOSSILS – Clash The Truth [2013]\n\nHiding inside a snowman on a mountain, watching skiers zip around you at high speeds.\n\n~~\n\nBeach Fossils set the highest watermark for all lo-fi jangle pop for this decade with this album right here, so if you’re looking for any more of their contemporaries further down on this list, I’m afraid the train stops here (please keep reading though). This is no shade on any of those bands either – Beach Fossils just did it the best here. Clash The Truth has the satisfying riffs and melodies that the band had been known for up to that point, but they also bring in new ideas and sounds and dynamics that hadn’t been present in the genre. For instance, the band’s biggest song “Sleep Apnea” tones down the fuzz for gentle acoustic guitar but still keeps the listener engaged with a slow, singable melody. For the most part though BF keep up their fast, layered jangle pop they’re known for and supply some iconic tracks in the genre, like “Shallow” and “Birthday”. Like I said earlier – if you want to get to know the brilliant era of indie rock from 2010 – 2013 (I think it’s brilliant!) start with this and go outward to their contemporaries. It’s a really fun time that I’ll look back on so fondly.\n\n79. SUFJAN STEVENS – Carrie & Lowell [2015]\n\nPlunging a sword deep within your own heart and letting light glint off the blood that spills from the wound and coats the silvery blade.\n\n~~\n\nTouching beyond words, but I’ll try and will some in here. Sufjan Stevens called upon the grief and confusion he felt from the passing of his distant mother on Carrie & Lowell, named after his mom and stepdad. What resulted is a gorgeous tapestry of sparkling folk jewels that just happen to have a crushing backstory. Instrumentally, vocally and lyrically Stevens is on his A-game. It’s a huge load to carry, but the beauty of Stevens’ reflections makes the journey worth it.\n\n78. HAND HABITS – Wildly Idle (Humble Before The Void) [2017]\n\nIt’s 1pm on any given Sunday. Light pours in through a well-thought out window. A good friend is in one room of the house and you’re in another, but you can see them if you look up from the book you’re reading. They’re cutting fruit that you will both enjoy together. You love them. You lay on the floor next to each other. You love them.\n\n~~\n\nAs you can probably tell from the Warm Visions description, I associate this record with some seriously romantic thoughts. Not just a ultra lovey-dovey, hands-on love, but a really casual, mutually-beneficial partnership. Guitars alternately shimmer like sunlight shining bright off a reflective surface and mosey around like wool socks on a well-tread rug. It’s a record that’s got songs for self-reflection, songs for slow dancing, songs for gazing, songs for tea steam, songs for chores, songs for driving, songs for writing. It’s over-flowingly lovely and charming.\n\n77. D’ANGELO – Black Messiah [2014]\n\nAn angel with a choir of ten thousand behind it asks for peace.\n\n~~\n\nThe man came back and somehow did not miss a beat. D’Angelo’s first album in over ten years is a knotty funk masterpiece that taps into the liquid grooves that he’s been known for and applies that to the current social climate. It’s a touching album that has all the simmering slow jams (the church bell on “Prayer” just melts me) and upbeat jams (“The Charade”) that you’d want. I just feel lucky we got another D’Angelo record, seriously.\n\n76. JAMIE XX – In Colour [2015]\n\nLucid dreaming through various psychedelic party scenarios without any sense of linear time.\n\n~~\n\nMan is it easy to listen this record to over and over and over again. According to last.fm I’ve listened to the songs on this album a collective 728 times. It’s a staple summer record for me. Once the weather starts getting a touch nicer, BOOM – it’s on my phone and I’m listening to it on my evening commute home. The sun is setting, the freedom of the night is setting in, the misty vibes on this record come rolling out and coil around me. Essences of solitary jubilation bleed from this record. A brilliant record to blast in your headphones or on your car speakers to remove any worry accumulated from the workday and ease yourself back into your original form.\n\n75. WHITE LUNG – Deep Fantasy [2014]\n\nLanding approximately one thousand spin kicks upon your mortal enemy’s face.\n\n~~\n\nThis record kicks ass. The songs here have such a burning intensity they could strip your flesh from bone in a millisecond. Just an absolute assault of sound on this record. There is no inch of empty space in the mix on these songs. It’s loaded with spiked guitars, wartime percussion and Mish Way’s total rock n roll croon. Even after six years of listening to this record it gets me hyped all the way up.\n\n74. ZOLA JESUS – Okovi [2017]\n\nAn immortal, emotionally-tortured vampire tries & fails to resurrect a lost friend in a series of dark magic rituals.\n\n~~\n\nZola Jesus really nailed it with this LP. She’s been making dark, epic music for over 10 years with her powerful voice being the centerpiece. That’s worked out great on other records, but this time her cauldron’s recipe was altered a bit. I may be wrong, but it seems like the dialed-up intensity on the instrumentals to match her own vocal vivacity has never worked better than here. Not only do they go hard as hell (like on personal highlight “Remains” and single “Exhumed”), they also enhance the emotional impact of gutting songs like “Siphon” and “Witness”. A jet-black, industrial symphony of anguish that burns fiercely to stave away cold and hunger another night.\n\n73. DISCLOSURE – Settle [2013]\n\nBeing cursed with an overflow of electricity that won’t expel unless you dance endlessly.\n\n~~\n\nPure magic in house + dance music form. Smartly described as “pop-house” by a close ally of the blog, Disclosure don’t quite go full pop or full house on this album, so there we go. Straddling the boundary between the two, the English duo expertly make tracks that allow their all-star crew of vocal guests (for 2013) space to not only flex their prowess as singers, but also to blend into the song and become one, cohesive unit. There’s not many moments on this record where it feels like “oh this is just a guest, whatever” – everything feels proper and a real good time. Like I said – it’s pure magic.\n\n72. ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER – R Plus Seven [2013]\n\nA severe internet addiction grants you the power to open people’s thoughts like opening tabs in a browser.\n\n~~\n\nOne of those albums that kind of shifts your brain’s stacks around into new organizational systems. New age-inspired electronics that constantly morph into new shapes, making the listener guess where it heads next. Almost seems like the sounds here were pulled from MIDI clips played from early internet web browsers. They seem like they could have practical sound effect usage elsewhere, but are employed here in such inhuman ways (yet also strangely human? This is what I’m getting at when I say it reorganizes your brain, you’re never quite concretely sure of what’s happening). A heartfelt string symphony, clearly programmed via computer, but carrying the emotion of one recorded live.\n\nI remember ranking this apart from my Best Albums of 2013 list and making a whole different “Weirdo” list because I had no idea what to make of it. One of those records that alters the reality around you if you’re listening, intently or otherwise. It’s almost like this record cuts into filters of existence, each song allowing the listener to observe one slice of humanity at a time, apart from all the others, in a vacuum. Moments of true beauty and pure anguish reside behind its many doors and you have to open all of them to escape.\n\n71. EARL SWEATSHIRT – Some Rap Songs [2018]\n\nA HAM radio enthusiast plays multiple distorted frequencies at once at high volumes while reclining in an old oversized recliner.\n\n~~\n\nEarl Sweatshirt channeled the rising experimental, underground hip hop scene of NYC and LA that’s obsessed with deep sample digging, jazz, gospel, micro-loops, woozy production, quickness (but slowness when it matters), etc… and essentially made a best-of compilation of the style. Not quite riding a beat but more like pasting words overtop it, just applying his intricate wordplay over retro, blown out patchworks wherever it can fit. It’s a feeling.\n\n70. DUSK – Dusk [2018]\n\nSeeing some of the same old, charming items (fridge magnets, plastic cups, fake plants, vinyl tablecloth) from your grandparents’ house in a thrift store, miles & miles away.\n\n~~\n\nA country rock record made by punks, for punks. If you like homespun southern classic rock songs that you can blast out of your car with the windows down, chock full of soulful steel pedal guitar, dual lead guitars, vintage organ, rollicking acoustic guitar, tender string arrangements, relatable lyrics, and a healthy dose of the best retro radio vibes, you’ll like this to the moon and back. I can confidently say that there isn’t a bad song on here. The emotions on here feel so real and unpolished – prime for singing along to. This band is CRIMINALLY underrated. Please start paying attention to them! Or… I dunno, maybe they can be our little secret 🙂\n\n69. KAYTRANADA – 99.9% [2016]\n\nFollowing the life of a dancer for 24 hours as they travel to rehearsals in their island community, improvising routines with the overflowing fauna and running into an endless amount of friends along the way to a night of partying.\n\n~~\n\nA masterclass in utilizing guest features. Even though Kaytra never sings or speaks on the record, it squarely feels like something HE made. His signature, blocky bounce he puts on all the songs is more than enough of a force to establish a presence. While he’s laying down the groundwork, he’s allowing the guest vocalists to shine their own personalities and make the song their own too. But unlike how many producer records go, there’s never a question of whose record this is and no disconnect between songs with different guests. It flows smoothly, with singers changing on nearly every track, vibes changing on each track, things not feeling homogenous, and it’s still all cohesive. Going through this whole thing is a piece of cake and it’s a great time at that. Just an odyssey at twilight, gliding through a sparkling city.\n\n68. KENDRICK LAMAR – Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City [2012]\n\nTales from a town afflicted by a delirious illness rooted in the scent of money.\n\n~~\n\nI love that this album is so easily accessible but breaches topics like gang violence, poverty, politics, drug abuse and relationships. A concept album strung together by quick audio recordings to establish a narrative shows Kendrick is a compelling storyteller. For every banger there’s a song that sits you down and lets Lamar do his thing. There’s a Beach House sample, too. Come on y’all, you know this album is great and a landmark in the decade.\n\n67. VAMPIRE WEEKEND – Contra [2010]\n\nBecoming the head of 15 to 20 different clubs and societies so you can be featured in the school yearbook the most out of anyone else.\n\n~~\n\nContra is the better version of Vampire Weekend’s debut. They’re essentially the same album of prim and proper indie pop, but Contra is the start of the band really fermenting, developing flavor, deepening the sweetness of their melodies, adding instrumentation, etc. From the opening clatter of “Horchata” to the warm-hued shimmer of “I Think Ur A Contra”, Vampire Weekend pushes the boundary on their summery, relatively carefree music while still keeping it close to the debut. A proper sophomore record indeed. Also you can hi-five me if you think “Diplomat’s Son” is the best song.\n\n66. KAMASI WASHINGTON – The Epic [2015]\n\nThe gods play chess with lost souls of departed legendary heroes.\n\n~~\n\nThe massive one. I didn’t know much about jazz when this first came out and hell I still don’t know much about it now. Does that make me unfit to like this album? Hell no, get your pretentious ass outta here. Am I allowed to enjoy a three-disc, near three-hour collection of highly produced, expertly performed, absolutely epic (heh, get it? It’s called The Epic. Is this like when they say the title of the movie in the movie?), psychedelic funk-dipped, incredibly satisfying and cinematic jazz? Hell yes I am. I haven’t found myself listening to this entire monster in one sitting in a while, but certain songs like “Miss Understanding”, “Re Run Home”, “The Magnificent 7” and “The Rhythm Changes” still get me in the zone. The attention this record has brought back to jazz by the mainstream listening audience is admirable – just think about all the hip hop/Flying Lotus youth taking an interest in this album and trying to hone their craft so they can make THEIR Epic? Ok, now that is epic.\n\n65. MOUNT EERIE – A Crow Looked At Me [2017]\n\nSeeing the donated clothes of a deceased loved one worn by people of the town you live in.\n\n~~\n\nIf you’ve lost a loved one recently, please tread with caution. Phil Elverum (Mount Eerie) made an album that consolidates all the loneliness and dizzying agony that comes with losing a partner into an album. One of the record’s main points is that life keeps going after a tragedy, although it seems like life has stopped through our perspective. Things are ordinary and plain to most people around you, and that really sucks. Elverum captures this overlooked consequence of death the best, and that may be why this album cuts so deep. Yes it’s beautifully poetic and eulogizes his partner, but the way he describes how witnessing the terrifying, painful march to death and the endless confusion and despair that follows fits into your new, daily routine, interactions with friends and family is devastating. Shockingly candid. It’s not a fantasy. It’s real life.\n\n64. SHABAZZ PALACES – Black Up [2011]\n\nA series of intricate handshakes recorded with a fisheye lens.\n\n~~\n\nThis is a record that totally blew my mind when I first heard it. At the time of its release I still wasn’t into hip hop, but the oddness of the instrumentals and vocal delivery hooked me in. Since then, I don’t think anyone has made a hip hop record quite like this. Nothing as weird and confident and groovy as this. Something that pushes boundaries but still maintains sight of making a good, satisfying hip hop song. Also I’m 90% sure that “An echo from the hosts that profess infinitum” sampled Teen Girl Squad.\n\n63. ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER – Garden of Delete [2015]\n\nA middle schooler makes the most insane class film project on a corrupted digital camera and gets sent to the principal’s office.\n\n~~\n\nOf course OPN’s mallgoth record would be his most accessible one in his discography. Well maybe not the most accessible, but definitely the one with the most instant gratification. The album may be loaded with complex melodic sequences and speaker-testing blasts of noise, but they honestly feel more like actual structured songs than any other project in his discography. Most tracks here have a clear emotional peak (you’ll know it! The peaks on this album are intense, overwhelming and euphoric) and that’s probably why I like it so much. Call me simple, but when sheets of wicked electronics start grinding together while an unintelligible robot voice squeals overhead, I can’t help but get wrapped up in a nice sheet of goosebumps and marvel at the scale of it all.\n\n62. CARLY RAE JEPSEN – E•MO•TION [2015]\n\nNervous butterflies burst from your chest and chauffeur you and your love interest directly into the sun (but like, in a good way).\n\n~~\n\nMaaaannn… what else can I say here? I got snagged in this record and there was no chance to escape. I say that like it’s a bad thing. How could I, with such towering anthems tied up in such pretty packaging like these? Maybe it’s the lack of major celebrity that allows these songs to feel so genuine? Maybe CRJ as a person just is so organically bubbly that these songs come off as legit as they are? Honestly though, this needs no hypothesizing. CRJ made some monster-ass pop songs that have defined half the decade. “Gimmie Love” is one of my all time most listened-to songs ever. How can you not want to get wrapped up in effervescent songs about love that make you feel like you’re on vacation?\n\n61. THE CARETAKER – An Empty Bliss Beyond This World [2011]\n\nAn estranged, drifting socialite h"
