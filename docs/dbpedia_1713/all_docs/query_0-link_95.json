        "text": "My peers from the 20th Century (or the 1900s, as my son refers to my childhood) know about not being able to find things. There was no internet, home video wasn’t a thing until the 1980s, and if it wasn’t played on the radio or physically in your record store you didn’t get it. Weirdly, you could see more adventurous music on TV then hear on the radio. At least in my village.\n\nThat said — even kids read the newspaper. All of us read the Comics while we split on the Sports and Arts sections. I would read about Television and Tom Verlaine, the most praised Guitar God of the CBGB scene, and wasn’t sure what he actually sounded like (other much mentioned modern guitar heroes included Verlaine’s Television compatriot Richard Lloyd and Robert Quine from Richard Hell & The Voidoids). So, I was curious about Television but I couldn’t listen to them. If local rock station KPRI played Television’s “See No Evil” or “Foxhole” on the radio during their short-lived 1979 attempt to go New Wave I didn’t notice it the way that concurrent Iggy Pop, Elvis Costello, and Talking Heads jumped out of the radio and into my ears.\n\nRock journalists writing about artists and bands who lacked any mainstream media exposure at all gave artists such as The Velvet Underground, Scott Walker, and Tom Verlaine a mysterious aura. Television, and Verlaine, stayed in my consciousness partly from reading, and re-reading, copies of the NY Rocker, a great Melody Maker style music magazine that got San Diego beach kids to dream about all the good times to be had in a still affordable, but falling apart, Fun City.\n\nWTF did they sound like exactly??? Television, like the Talking Heads, ended up sounding artsier and stranger than other CGBG era bands but I didn’t actually get to back up that assumption with Television until the mid 1980s.\n\nI heard Tom Verlaine solo material first because those were the records you could find. And, even though Verlaine was a singer-songwriter and lead guitarist, and thus in complete control of what he presented to the world, he kept that mysterious aura and sense of inscrutability even after I heard his music. Who really knew what was going on in that guy’s head?? He seemed both NYC streetwise and tough and zen-like, gentle, and serene. Verlaine was supposedly a very private person. I saw him in concert both solo and on Television reunion tours and he barely talked to the audience, if at all, and kept his thoughts to himself. But his music was often stunning. We need more of that — does knowing an artist more ever make them more interesting?? I am sure his desire for privacy hurt his career in the 1970s and ’80s.\n\nVerlaine is still celebrated for his transcendent guitar playing and is feted by today’s musicians, from Dream Syndicate’s Steve Wynn (Dream Syndicate) and Luna’s Dean Wareham to Wilco’s Nels Cline. Just before Verlaine passed away, The Go-Betweens Robert Forster wrote a neat little appreciation.\n\nREM’s Michael Stipe and Steve Albini actually mentioned the originality of Verlaine’s singing voice. Verlaine deserves his reputation as a brilliant guitarist, but he was also a gifted songwriter, and he really created a new American vocal style of the New Wave scene — The UK had Bowie and Ferry to follow and he filled in a new American example for young artists around the world who didn’t want to sound bluesy or like Joe Cocker or Mick Jagger or Robert Plant.\n\nI would recommend everybody have a vinyl copy of Marquee Moon while Television’s follow-up album is actually pretty darn good — its main fault is that it follows a masterwork. Verlaine’s solos records are also very rewarding, all the dreaminess of Television but less NYC art-punk bite to them. The recently departed Terry Hall name-checked NYC punk by Richard Hell and Television over its UK counterparts. He said the Sex Pistols inspired kids like him with “Hey, we could do that!” where-as a band like Television was creating mysterious music that he knew he wouldn’t be able to duplicate.\n\nInstead of New York attitude or even a classic noir sense of the streets, Tom Verlaine’s solo records have an internationalist sense of romance and glamour and are more like colorful koi ponds than black & white images of the concrete jungle — they are for the underground art-minded, a secret army of future downtown loft dwellers and kids living on student grants.\n\nOne of the best shows I have ever seen was Tom Verlaine’s live accompaniment to brilliant short films from the artist Man Ray, whose Silent era works were full of perfect shots and quickly edited in a very modern way. The combination of Verlaine’s practically symphonic guitar music and Ray’s images came together perfectly.\n\nIt has been a stormy winter here in San Francisco with almost a month of non-stop rain.\n\nPerfect time to bundle up and pull out the Cal Tjader ballad set Last Night When We Were Young. This little wonder is one of a number of Tjader LPs that have never been reissued in the digital age. I wrote up an earlier, more smoking, Tjader live set that has yet to see to see even a streaming release here.\n\nI’ve done a couple other jazz+strings ballad sets by other favorite musicians. Something about rainy winter nights has me breaking the glass on the jazz+strings album. One was from Clifford Brown, the tragically short-lived trumpet genius and mathematician that every other horn-player, including Miles Davis, bowed down to. The other was by Cal Tjader’s San Francisco compatriot, Paul Desmond. Both Tjader and Desmond came to fame playing with Dave Brubeck, though not at the same time. I can recommend all three of these jazz+strings records if you need music to accompany staring out of windows onto rain, or snow, dappled streets on cold winter nights.\n\nCal Tjader’s bread and butter was Latin jazz; but he was steeped in Swing and Bop, first as a drummer and then as a vibraphonist. Tjader was a founding member of the small group Latin-jazz form, marrying Carribean rhythms with West Coast, Cool-toned bop. There is a nifty scene in the Boogaloo documentary We Like It Like That where a Latin-jazz bandleader from NYC explains the impact of hearing how helped Tjader open up Caribbean music with American jazz, allowing Bop bass lines to combine with the classic rhythms, and thinking “Eureka! That’s how you do it!”\n\nTruth be told, Cal Tjader probably wanted to record more straight-ahead jazz albums but his Latin releases outsold his straight jazz ones something like 3-to-1 (a noted partial exception was his version of the West Side Story score, which includes orchestral arrangements, small group jazz, and Latin rhythms in different spots).\n\nWhen Tjader signed on to Verve and got some special Creed Taylor attention, the result was Soul Sauce, the first Latin-jazz set (or just Latin LP period) to sell over 100,000 copies. This album is where the later term salsa comes from — really, bring all of this up in your ethnomusicology class and just feel the glare.\n\nTjader was a pretty mainstream jazz star in the 1960s and he had a diverse fanbase — Latin fans loved him, black fans danced to him, and jazz fans listened to him. He performed at the Harlem music festival that was later turned into the Oscar-winning Summer of Soul documentary, but he wasn’t featured in the film (time for a sequel).\n\nOver at Verve they were enjoying releases that frequently topped the jazz charts, and went into the pop charts, and even though Tjader hurt his career by deciding to keep San Franciso as his home base he was still enjoying sales, and radio play, most jazz musicians would envy. Things suddenly changed for the worse for jazz in the late 1960s and, after burning out with his own short-lived record label, Tjader returned home to SF’s Fantasy Records in the early 1970s. While he experimented with a lot of different material there (from hot Latin with old friend Tito Puente to groovy Fusion with George Duke) it took him until 1975 to ask the conga player to take five so he could slow things down and dive into a classic jazz ballad set, backed by sumptuous strings.\n\nArt\n\nWhat a striking LP sleeve.\n\nIt reminds me a little of the sleeve to Chet Baker’s CTI release She Was Too Good For Me.\n\nThe photograph was by Nick Saxton, who I can find very little information about. He shot this sleeve, a photo of Bob Dylan, and directed an early Michael Jackson music video. No idea what his bread and butter was or if he changed professions. If it’s somebody from the 1970s or ’80s I usually default to blaming cocaine and a devious cult leader so if anybody knows anything about Nick Saxton please let me know. He shot one beautiful album cover.\n\nMusic\n\nCal Tjader, to me, is a bandleader as much as a soloist. Maybe even more of a bandleader — think of how Art Blakey was a master drummer but rarely allowed the Jazz Messengers to primarily be a showcase for his drums or how Horace Silver is a truly underrated pianist because his playing was always in the service of his songs and his band (and if you have Joe Henderson or Blue Mitchell in your group let them solo!). The music the entire band makes is what is important. So, Tjader was a fine soloist but its instructional to listen to him and contrast his groups with that of the great Latin jazz bandleaders who started with him. When they led their own bands Willie Bobo or Mongo Santamaria didn’t let their sidemen take centerstage the way that Tjader did with them.\n\nBy 1975, Cal Tjader singles were no longer making it to jukeboxes, jazz was falling off the radio, and Latin audiences were listening to Salsa, a big pop music form but more segregated from mainstream audiences. On the other hand, Carlos Santana was huge and he didn’t hide the fact that Cal Tjader had a massive influence on his Latin Jazz influenced sound. Who can blame Tjader for wanting to sit down in an easy chair and take one nice and slow.\n\nOn Last Night When We Were Young, Cal Tjader has veteran West Coast scene pianist Frank Strazzeri (Art Pepper; Oliver Nelson) not only write up his very first set of string charts for the session but also lets him start off the album, beautifully, on an extended acoustic piano opening to “I Can’t Get Started With You,” the Vernon Duke beauty that has the rare Ira Gershwin lyric not matched to one of his brother’s songs. The rendition here has an appropriately 1970s retro film noir feel to it (think Chinatown, Farewell, My Lovely or The Long Goodbye — the impressionistic 1940s black and white turned to lush but nocturnal Francis Bacon Technicolor). That is Cal Tjader through-and-through — he was a star vibraphonist but his own album doesn’t start off with him in the solo spotlight. Instead, he puts the spotlight on his pianist.\n\nWhen Tjader’s vibes do kick in, followed by the rest of band and the strings, Strazzeri switches over to the Rhodes keyboards. I have written in the past that while I am crazy for the Rhodes, I don’t see the point pairing them with the vibes since both have a shimmering, refracted sound to them. I take it all back – I would now gladly listening to nothing but the Rhodes and the vibes together all day long.\n\nThe thing about Tjader is, just because he had no problem turning the spotlight on his bandmates, that doesn’t mean he wasn’t a master soloist. His work on “I Can’t Get Started” is just sublime. Cal supports Stazzeri’s piano and the charts like a piano normally would for the first minute and then he kicks in for a two and a half minute solo where he primarily plays the melody, but improvises on the harmonies, and mixes this in with numerous darts away into improvising off the melody (he just improvizes in such a way that it feels so natural and logical that is seems like he’s still playing the melody as written. Another reason jazz musicians played standards (besides the structure of the tunes being so solid for improvisation) is that listeners could tell when they were playing the melody or improvising on it.\n\nTjader is telling the story of the song and not pushing his knowledge of chords and scales past the emotions of the song. His old friend, Eddie Duran follows up on guitar — Eddie was another professional musician who would be better known if he decided to leave SF the way Dave Brubeck, Paul Desmond, and so many others did. Drummer Dick Berk was another SF local, he played with jazz-funk master George Duke and a bunch of Bay Area based artists though he also worked with the great Milt Jackson, who gets my vote as jazz’s all-time greatest vibraphonist (Tjader wrote his hero a tribute that he recorded a number of times, first with George Shearing).\n\nFrank Strazzeri handles the string charts deftly and uses them judiciously — the extra juice is turned on maybe for a third of the playing time total. Perfect set of standards here — the title track is a personal favorite of Tjader’s (and many jazz musicians) and the majority of the songs are “standard” standards. Three of the numbers come from the 1960s — Braodway’s “Why Did I Choose You,” Burt Bacharach’s “A House Is Not A Home,” and Johnny Mandel’s “Emily” (the theme to the brilliant anti-war satire The Americanization of Emily.) Tjader also includes Thad Jones’ “A Child Is Born” — Thad was part of the mighty Jazz Jones Dynasty that included his brothers Elvin and Hank. I believe Tjader recorded at least three times with Hank Jones (whose piano playing defined elegance) across his career and Hank named Cal as his favorite drummer to play with, which may have also been passive/aggressive slap against his brother Elvin, a brilliant drummer and bandleader in his own right.\n\nTjader and Strazzeri do different, but complimentary, things together to state the haunting melody of Burt Bacharach’s “A House Is Not a Home.” They play the entire song through but don’t solo — they just let the perfect chords hang in the air. They guide listeners through the chords that shape a sublime melody from a gifted modern pop composer who wrote a ballad that can stand tall next to the accepted masterworks from the great Broadway, Tin Pan Alley, and jazz traditions.\n\nThis is then followed up by the album’s final track, a reading of “For All We Know” which picks up the pace and lets everyone, especially Tjader, solo in-between an austere string intro and outro. Like many songs that would become standards, “For All We Know” was written in the 1930s but it gained a new relevance during WWII.\n\nAmerica entering the war helped turn teenage drummer Cal Tjader into a professional musician as San Francisco’s bands had open seats. Tjader had graduated high school but was still under 18 when he joined the Navy with his mother signing approval for his early entry. He was a corpsman, running around the battlefield under heavy fire, trying to save the lives of his fellow soldiers. Often, when the men were too badly wounded his duty was to administer morphine so they’d be in less pain as they died alone on the beach and he’d have to move on to the next man. On top of the stress of the battlefield that is a lot of life and death responsibility for an 18 year old to have to shoulder.\n\nTjader was in showbiz but spent the rest of his too-short life helping others — he was involved in various SF charities and often did fund raisers. As I write about here – when Art Pepper, a notorious drug addict, needed a sponsor to tour Japan, Tjader stepped up and sponsored him even though he could have faced criminal and financial penalties if Pepper was caught with drugs. But his war experiences never left him — he told friends and family they were not good memories.\n\nPlaying a jazz festival in the Philippines in 1982, Tjader visited a beach that was the site of a fierce battle he was in. Usually known for his lowkey manner, friendliness, and wit, Tjader became overcome with sensory trauma and collapsed into uncontrollable sobs which led to the heart attack that killed him. He was 56 years old.\n\nPeople from the rock or hip-hop generations think that standards are corny old songs with lyrics that aren’t about real life. Jazz artists knew better. These songs endure because they speak to our lives. When TV critics would tell the screenwriter Dennis Potter that he picked corny old songs for his dark, twisted shows like Pennies From Heaven and The Singing Detective he would grow enraged and respond that those songs saved his life.\n\nCal Tjader recorded “For All We Know” at least three times in his career. The version that ends Last Night When We Were Young is fine, and adds a little fire to the album, though my favorite version is the one he cut was with Stan Getz. Here are some lyrics from the song — you, hopefully, can see why servicemen, and their families back on the home front, resurrected the song and brought new relevance to it during the war:\n\nFor all we know\n\nThis may only be a dream\n\nWe come and we go\n\nLike the ripples of a stream\n\nSo love me, love me tonight\n\nTomorrow was made for some\n\nTomorrow may never come\n\nFor all we know\n\nCal Tjader’s bread and butter was good time party music that was so kinetic that your body won’t sit still while you listen to it. I’m a stereotypical white guy with glasses — not a big dancer. Doesn’t mean my feet, shoulders and head don’t uncontrollably start rocking and rolling when I play Tjader’s usual Latin jazz fair. But, hopefully you can see why Tjader wanted to return to jazz ballads and bask in the comfort of the most beautiful songs ever written.\n\nThis is especially appreciated on stormy winter nights.\n\n— Nick Dedina"
