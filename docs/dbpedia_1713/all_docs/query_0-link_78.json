        "text": "Last week, I watched the first season of the much touted HBO series The White Lotus for the first time. Being sick with Covid over the past three days gave me the chance to binge the second season. That these are six- and seven-part series respectively makes it easier to binge a season as opposed to the typical 10-to-13-part series for many shows. The two seasons are very similar in some respects. Both take place in an international resort hotel called The White Lotus in an exotic location.\n\nSeason 1 unfolds in Hawaii. Season 2 happens in Sicily. Both are beach and poolside resorts giving ample opportunities for parades of flesh. Apparently Season 1 was filmed during pandemic restrictions which limited the variety of settings. Most of the action takes place in the hotel or on the beach. Certainly, it doesn’t do justice to the gorgeous variety of Hawaii that one comes to know and love over many visits to its different islands. Season 2 offers a more lavish portrayal of Sicily including the beach town of Taormina where the hotel is located, and the city of Palermo. It is far lusher visually, much more integrated with the locality, and will make anyone who sees it want to visit Sicily (I know I do). No wonder the Italian government offers a 40% tax break to make such shows in country.\n\nIn terms of themes, the first season is focused on the haves versus the have-nots with a healthy dose of colonialism thrown in for good measure. It's somewhat of a Gatsbian tale with wealthy, privileged, and connected people getting away with irresponsible behavior while causing collateral damage to those less fortunate around them. The entire ensemble does a fantastic job of portraying these intertwining characters and stories. The scene stealer in Season 1 is Armond, the hotel manager, who is a wound-up ball of mad energy and so much fun to watch. None of the other characters is likeable except Belinda the spa staffer (who is mistreated in the end) and perhaps Quinn, the sullen teenage son who ends up joining a squad of local Hawaiian rowers. Hands down the most uplifting scenes are of Quinn getting Shanghaied each morning on the beach to join the Hawaiian bros on their craft. And the breaching whale is a touch of magic.\n\nSeason 2 hovers around the theme of illicit sexuality, with a craven carnival of concupiscent carnality leading to carnage by the end. Again, the ensemble cast do impeccable jobs of portraying various modes of the human condition, including horniness, excess, selfishness, peevishness, jealousy, irresponsibility, duplicity, and dissatisfaction. In Season 2, my two favorite characters are the gorgeous young local hooker Lucia and her talented musician friend Mia, who frequent the hotel and seek gainful opportunities by manipulating various guests and staff members, outwitting them at every turn.\n\nThe only person to appear fully in both seasons is the dysfunctional and physically and emotionally bloated heiress to a massive fortune named Tanya McQuoid. Her terse lover and then husband Greg also appears in Seasons 1 and 2. While Jennifer Coolidge’s performance of Tanya is outstanding and one of the highlights of both seasons, I found her character and role to be the least believable in the series. How could a woman so amazingly wealthy be traveling abroad to such exotic locales alone and unprotected? Basically, she is shark bait.\n\n(Spoiler alert) When her mysterious aging and obviously ill hotel neighbor Greg falls for her, we know something is up but we’re not sure what. Is this just a casual fling of opportunity? Given her physical and emotional unattractiveness (though she sure knows how to dress the part), why should a guy like Greg jump into bed with this woman? He makes clear on several occasions in his gestures that he is repulsed by her, yet he wants to sleep with her nonetheless. Later in Season 2, we find that Greg has married Tanya and later it is revealed that he is indeed plotting to get rid of his wife and claim the bounty of her inheritance. For this nefarious task he employs an old British expat friend based in Sicily named Quentin (played with great finesse by Tom Hollander) along with his gay companions. When Tanya shows up in Sicily with only her assistant, a clueless young American girl named Portia out for an adventure, only to be abandoned by Greg who returns to the USA for mysterious purposes, we know trouble is brewing. Eventually the odd companions figure this out, but only after it is too late to avoid the consequences.\n\nIt is hard to imagine that a woman like Tanya with that much financial clout wouldn’t be surrounded with an entourage of people serving all her needs including protection from all the hustlers, opportunists and other evil doers who must circle around such people like sharks. And how could she not hire better assistants? She claims at one point that she has bad luck hiring people, but come on, this woman has access to half a billion dollars. Is there any reality to this scenario? And yet it drives a significant portion of the plot.\n\nMost of the other scenarios are more believable, with families and friendships festering with internal conflicts, rivalries, and secrets. In Season 1, the emasculated father Mark, powerful mother Nicole, college age daughter Olivia, and teenage son Quinn portray an authentically dysfunctional family dynamic that strikes me as somewhat universal. Only the classmate friend of Olivia, a girl of color named Paula, has a bit more nuance and bravado as a character, if in a tragic vein. The story of the newlywed couple Shane and Rachel strikes me as realistic. He is a wealthy and arrogant young man who can’t stop complaining about everything that doesn’t go his way and thinks money is the cure to every problem, while she is a beautiful and idealistic young woman from a modest background who must now come to terms with having married into the moneyed class.\n\nThe trio of men in Season 2, including the patriarch Bert (played fantastically by F Murray Abraham, who is the main reason I wanted to see this show in the first place), his son Dominic (played by Michael Imperioli of Sopranos fame) and grandson Albie are fun to watch as they attempt to discover their ethnic and family roots in Sicily while dealing with issues of infidelity and sexual addiction. Meanwhile, the foursome of thirty-somethings who get tangled in their own sexual rivalry of sorts are amusing to watch and they put on a credible show as they sort out the complex dynamics of their new relationship. “Alpha Dog” Cameron reminds me of a typical Dartmouth fraternity bro who went on to NYC to engage in high finance. High octane testosterone runs through his veins. His college roommate Ethan “Big E” is an introverted and nerdy guy, who made it big when he sold his tech company. Now Cameron is angling to get into a business relationship with his long-lost pal. Meanwhile, their wives Harper and Daphne are trying to come to terms with each other’s alien value system and outlook on life while dealing with the explosive and troublesome friendship between the two bros. Toxic masculinity is a keyword here. While none of these characters are likeable in any real way (expect perhaps the kind-hearted Albie though he is hopelessly naïve—and maybe that’s why we root for him in the end, like some hapless character in a Woody Allen film) they come across as real and nuanced people.\n\nYet ultimately what I find unconvincing is how the main characters all leave the country at the end of each season just after major crimes have been committed and need to be investigated and prosecuted. They are not detained as witnesses to sort out the sordid details of said crimes. Is this an indictment of the Hawaiian and Italian justice system a la Ripley (also a fantastic series recently aired by Netflix)? It seems incredibly naïve to think that major theft and murder cases would be left to the locals to tie up, while the perpetrators, abettors, and witnesses fly away unscathed. The end of each season turns tragic, so you could say this is a tragicomedy masking as a dark situational comedy.\n\nDespite these caveats, the series was a great deal of fun and a blessed distraction from my second round of Covid. Sometimes laughing at others’ pain eases your own. And the next season which takes place in Thailand—one of my favorite places on the planet— will surely be just as delightful.\n\nConceptually, it holds together extremely well. It's the sequence of the songs, the themes that they, the musical themes within the songs are very coherent. And there's a classic element to the music. This is by far their most classical album. It's an album that has resonances with Bach and Mozart and Beethoven.\n\nSo they're digging even deeper into the wellspring of music. Paul found a poem written for a play in like 1600. So going way back in history, Golden Slumbers, which I think is really the keystone to understanding this album. It's that song. And this was my revelation with this album. I won't tell you what I was on, but I remember one day, just I guess listening or thinking about this album. And it just occurred to me that that's a song about death.\n\nThe golden slumbers is the slumber of death. That's it. And so it's, you know, smiles awake you when you rise. Sleep pretty darling. Do not cry. It's kind of like a laying down to death. It's the death of the Beatles. It's an acceptance. I will sing a lullaby. I think what is saying is we have to accept death. And we have to tell ourselves kind of the myth that we continue to live on after we die. We need to tell ourselves that myth. And that's what all religion tells us that our souls continue to live or that we're reborn.\n\nBut it's a myth. You die, you die. You're gone. And I think they kind of understood that. And that was deeply embedded into this album. They knew that after this album, the Beatles would be gone. There would be no more Beatles. They would live on as individuals, but the magic that they had woven together as four musicians would never exist again.\n\nWould it be transcendent? Would it stand the test of time? You know, I'm sure that they were wondering, you know, how long are we, we were, we were this incredible band, but are we just a product of the 60s or will this last on? And what will we do as individuals.\n\nSo I think all that's woven into this album. And I liken this album to Dante. The first side is the Inferno. That's the hell. Maybe it's the hell that they were going through as they as they broke up. Terrible fights, fights over money, over artistry. They were probably going through a kind of a personal hell because, you know, they, they were very sad that this couldn't last. And I think they all, you know, they were, they had gone through so much together. So it was kind of like a divorce in a way. The band breaking up as they went on with their lives. And like a divorce, it was pretty messy. It was, there was a lot of anger and a lot of resentment and negative feelings and, you know, that really comes out on the first side of the album.\n\nWith like, you know, I Want You. She's so Heavy. Oh, Darling. I mean, there's a lot of screaming. There's a lot of, you know, emotions, a lot of pent up emotions and anger on this first side. Maxwell's Silver Hammer, you know, that's an interesting one was, is this, I don't think that that song can be taken literally. I think it has to be, I think this, the hammer is figurative. I think it's, it's a metaphor, you know, the hammer of justice, the hammer of freedom. It was, they're, they're smashing a relationship in order to gain their freedom, their artistic and personal freedom. They're breaking up what was the greatest band on earth in order to attain their own freedom and peace of mind. So, you know, I think if you analyze that song, it's all about smashing authority figures. It's kind of a cultural revolution. The aspect to it. I can even kind of see a cultural revolution poster in my mind of a, of a young revolutionary with a hammer trying to smash all the olds [in 1960s China]. And maybe that's what it's referencing. Just smashing, you know, teachers, old girlfriends or judges, the kind of people who are holding you back. So, I think it has to be taken figuratively. I don't think it's literally a story about a serial killer. And especially because it's told and sung in such a whimsical way. Obviously, it's not, this is not a dark, this is not a Peter Gabriel-like serial killer kind of song.\n\nSo, yeah, so the whole first side just has this, you know, there's, it's dark, it's, it's, it's earthy, it's fair, it's the inferno. Here come ol’ flat top, you know, it's Come Together, a song, which is about as creepy a song as you can get as bluesy and dark and, you know, from the earth, from the ground up. And Octopus's Garden thrown in there is kind of an underwater, underworld sort of adventure with caves and darkness and something primordial. And, you know, an octopus is kind of a fearful, fearsome creature, you know, you don't really want to, you know, be swimming and kind of come across an octopus all suddenly without warning. So, you know, it's, that's a dark, that's the dark side of the album. And, it represents kind of the winter of their discontent and their aggression and anger.\n\nAnd then you turn the side over and it's, and you're, and it's the Paradise. Now they're ascending to heaven. So, the flip side is, you know, Here Comes the Sun, one of the most joyful popular songs ever made. It's, every winter, it's a song that you sing in March when the flowers start to bloom again after a long cold, lonely winter. So, that was George Harrison and that was his kind of sense of freedom and happiness that he was no longer a Beatle, he could go, he could find his own destiny now. He had so much to share that had been suppressed by the Beatles and now he was going to let it all out.\n\nYou know, then, You Never Give Me Your Money which is such a deep song, such a, it's a sad, but it's also about freedom about, you know, crossing bridges. And, you know, leaving a place that you know you'll never go back to and so you're sad about that, but you're now finding your freedom and you're kind of finding yourself, a self that had been lost.\n\nAnd then the whole, the whole medley, of course, which is just a brilliant concoction of these old bits that they had kind of, you know, scraps of songs that they, that they had been working on that had never really jelled into full songs and they put them together in this medley. And somehow it worked. And so it ends the album with this, and it's very kind of dreamlike, it's, like I said, it's very heavenly, the Sun King, a lot of themes of sun and light and joy.\n\nAnd, you know, then you, you kind of go back to these mundane characters, but they're very, you know, Mean Mr. Mustard, Polythene Pam, kind of the people that you might see on the streets and Liverpool or in the clubs, but they're very iconic, very archetypal figures. And, and then She Came in Through the Bathroom Window. I mean, that song, I think you can only understand by knowing the anecdote about the Apple Scrufs and Paul and kind of the end of Apple Records, but you could also see it as kind of, I guess it's their relationship to their fans in general that their fans are just invading their private space and they're kind of sick of that. They're ready to move on. An then of course, Golden Slumbers, which I had explained is kind of, it's a poem ancient, not ancient, but, you know, several hundred years old poem, which I think was about death. And, kind of the myth, the mythology of rebirth that, you know, that we're told like a, a bedtime story. And then finally, The End, it's the end. And that's where they all come together for this jam session, which is quite amazing and really, and then of course, Paul's statement about the love you take is equal to the love you make. And what are you saying is, life is finite. We don't know what's going to happen after we die. We don't know what, of that we produce will be remembered or cherished. But at the end, it all equals out. What you take is equal to what you make. So, whatever you consume or enjoy ultimately is, it's going to be equal to what you produce in the world. If you're loved by people, it means that you loved them. You can't get anything for free. You have to put in as much as you get out.\n\nSo, it's an interesting way. It's a final message. And then there, of course, there's that the final final thing tacked on, which was just a kind of a whimsical mistake that they decided to keep, which was the little, the little bit Her Majesty, which I think it's such an unfinished little, I mean, it sounds almost like a jazz song from the 1920s. It's very kind of classic early, early 1920s popular song in its structure. And it could have been something much, much bigger and much more joyous, but they just kind of just tacked it on at the very, at the very end of the album as kind of a little surprise, very folksy little bit.\n\nBut, you know, all their songs can be played in so many different ways. But what I really, so there's the Heaven and the Hell motif, you know, the Dante's Inferno to the Paradise. And kind of ascending, I think in the, you know, they're ascending to the heavenly Pantheon. They'll always be known as this great band, seminal band. And they kind of, I think they recognize that the band would outlive them. They would go on as individuals, but nothing would ever be as important as the Beatles in their lives. Even though it was so short, so fleeting, it just passed by in like six, eight years, you know, and then they get there, they get to live the rest of their lives.\n\nSo, I think structurally and musically that album really came together. There are so many recurring motifs and themes. And I think in a way, it was kind of like their Ninth Symphony. You know, when you listen to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, it encapsulates pretty much everything that he was known for musically. And just takes it all to greater and greater heights. And it's about joy and about the beauty of humankind and about art and love.\n\nAnd I think that that was the message of Abbey Road as well. It was kind of continuing on from just that, so love in a way is kind of the message that love is transcendent. You know, it started out with the childish, it starts out with the teenage love, which is kind of a lusty, lusty love, but kind of a zest for life. And then, and then they got more reflective over time and, and more imaginative and lyrical and transcendent, and then finally, but it's always cycling back to that message about love. And that kind of never, that never left, you know, so it's, so love was always the message that, in a way, very Christian, as opposed, that you have to, you have to love the world. You have to love the people in the world, even though they'll let you down, even though there will be nasty breakups, there will be wars, there will be death, there will be struggle. The only way for us to keep going on is to have just believe in the power of love, believe that there's a some kind of greater power, and, and that love is coursing through the universe. And that was kind of the deepest message, I think, that resonated through their music.\n\nIt has become a custom of mine to end the year with a blog post (who writes blog posts anymore? Who reads them??) about the books I read over the past year. These aren’t books that I read for any purpose other than pure pleasure and personal enlightenment. Thus, “guilty pleasure reading.”\n\nI suppose some of my choices do relate to my academic interests but not necessarily in any direct way. As a champion of liberal education, I believe that even we “mentat academics” ought to read widely, not just carry out targeted reading for specific academic objectives or keep up with the state of our field (which admittedly I am not very good at doing these days). Nevertheless, I do feel a twinge of guilt when I look back at some of these tomes and wonder if my time wouldn’t be better spent writing more books of my own (I did publish one book this year, so I suppose I earned some relief time from writing). Still, one ought to be allowed some grace time to read for pure pleasure, especially if one has gone through some very challenging times, as I did this past year. Thus, without further ado, here are my guilty pleasure reads for 2023.\n\nSci Fi / Fantasy Fiction\n\nI have admitted in previous posts to being a sci fi and fantasy addict, particularly in my teenage years, when I was reading a great deal of fantasy and sci-fi by authors such as Piers Anthony, Michael Moorcock, and my favorite writer in that genre, Stanislaw Lem. I was also a fan of Isaac Asimov, but I confess that I never got round to reading his Foundation Trilogy, until this year. Like many others, it was the release of the Foundation series on Apple TV that spurred me to go back to the source. Anybody who reads Asimov’s Foundation series must marvel at the sheer immensity of his vision, which has influenced just about every space-faring fantasy series since then, including Star Trek, Star Wars, and so many others. Stanislaw Lem was obviously inspired by Asimov as well. The made-for-TV series, though entertaining (who can resist Lee Pace as the Emperor Day?) hardly does justice to the original vision of Asimov, preferring to indulge in stories of characters with paranormal powers. That said, the Mole, one of the most memorable characters in the original series, had such powers. Yet most of the original story is grounded in scientific possibilities. The premise for the Foundation series is that a mathematician and scientist named Hari Selden can predict the future of the galactic empire at the heart of the story, a future disliked by those in power, and for this he is banished to the outer realms of the galaxy to compile an encyclopedia. Yet he and the community he establishes on an outlying world are helping to minimize the downfall of the galactic civilization and prevent centuries of war. The pace of the story is fast, and it develops over hundreds of years, focusing on key characters (unlike the TV series, Selden dies early in the story) and on episodes known as “Selden Crises” when the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance. This is a monster of a book series, and a must-read for any sci-fi fan. I’m glad I finally got around to reading it this past summer, and I found it to be quite the page turner. As for the TV show, I understand why they felt that they had to recraft it, as the book series would be near impossible to turn into engaging TV—or would it? Maybe someday a TV writer or filmmaker will do justice to the books.\n\nSpeaking of page turners, I finally polished off the Fire and Ice series that I started at the outset of the pandemic in 2020. Last year, I read books 2 and 3. This fall, I charged through books 4 and 5, hoping that Book 6 might be out soon. This is a hope shared with all fans of the series. C’mon J.R.R. Martin, you can do it! As usual, these books proved impossible to put down once I’d started them, and I devoured both like the wildfires that struck Canada this year (yes, it was another year of global disasters piling up on each other). As with many readers who began the journey after seeing the TV series known as Game of Thrones, part of me wished that I had read the books first. You can’t help seeing the TV characters in your mind, which I suppose is a testament to the power of the TV series and the choice of actors who performed the roles. Who can ever forget Peter Dinkler as Tyrion, hands down the most interesting lead character in the book and TV series? I must admit that I found Book 5 to be bewildering with its explosion of characters and stories, yet Martin has a knack of making them all hang together somehow. I have no idea how he will be able to resolve all the plot twists and developments of Book 5. And I can’t imagine how he would have the discipline not to add more characters and story lines to this immensely rich world he has conjured up in the five volumes. The book series is so much richer, deeper, and more rewarding than the TV series, which ended in a very disappointing way. The characters are so much more nuanced and interesting too. While Martin is inevitably compared to Tolkien, I see him more as the Stephen King of the fantasy world, churning out books that are so powerfully addictive they just suck you into their worlds until you pop out at the other end.\n\nObviously, I was in a fantasy groove over summer and fall. Basically, I was recovering from a terrible health crisis, and I needed some fantasy to help pull me through it. The same thing happened to me back in high school when I went through a death-defying period brought on by an accident and spent a few weeks in hospital. The power of reading to help heal body, soul, and mind is underestimated, I think. The next book was a happy accident. I bought Samantha Shannon, The Priory of the Orange Tree for my daughter, who is also a huge fan of fantasy fiction and TV. One of our enjoyments is to indulge in such TV series as Shadow and Bone, The Umbrella Academy, and others of that ilk, and yes, we also saw Foundation together. One day, intrigued by the bright orange cover, I picked up the book to see what it was about. Once I started it, I couldn’t stop reading. Written by a woman with a feminist perspective on fantasy fiction, the book focuses on strong female characters, who drive the entire story. The lead characters are warriors caught up in a global war involving dragons. In this world, the dragons are either evil, hell bent on dominating the world of human beings, or they are benevolent creatures working with humans to fight the evil dragons. There is an East-West alignment to this world, with the Western dragons being the evil ones—perhaps a metaphor for Western imperialism and capitalism and its baleful influence on the modern world. The Eastern dragons are closer to those of Chinese and Japanese mythology, and indeed the people of this part of the world bear strong cultural resemblances to East Asian societies. Meanwhile, the title of the book refers to a secret society of warrior priest-like women bound to a tree whose fruits give them superhuman powers. It all adds up to a delectable story at the heart of which blossoms a Sapphic romance. I will be keeping an eye on this author and would love to tackle the prequel to this book if I get a chance.\n\nMusic\n\nThere are usually several books on my list focusing on music and musicians and this year was no exception. While I was in hospital this summer, I was deep diving into the catalog of the band Genesis. I grew up listening to this band by default, since they had become quite popular and their hit songs were always playing on the radio (I was a ‘70s-80s kid). Phil Collins was also a highlight of radio and TV, and was an ubiquitous presence. Then there was Peter Gabriel. I was a huge fan of his music throughout the 1980s. But I didn’t really investigate the earlier work of Genesis when Gabriel was the lead singer. For some reason I decided to do so while convalescing and needed a guide to their early work, so I downloaded Dave Thompson, Turn It On Again, Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins & Genesis on Kindle. I was treated to whirlwind tour of the band’s formation and its various phases under Gabriel and later Collins. While Peter Gabriel was experimental and showy—he wrote long song-stories, and dressed up in funny costumes and masks while performing, as you can see if you watch Youtube videos of their early work—Phil Collins took the band in a more compact and soulful direction. At first there was some crossover between the two phases in the 1970s, but eventually Collins helped shape the band—which eventually was pared down to the trio with Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks—into a hit-making machine by the dawn of the 1980s. Gabriel was obviously meant for more of a solo career and had a brilliant one. Phil did both.\n\nI’ve been a Tom Waits fan since the 1990s, when a friend introduced me to Swordfish Trombones. Like a bitter single malt Scotch, it was an acquired taste, but soon I was deep into his unique style of music-making, and I also picked up CDs of his albums Rain Dogs and Frank’s Wild Years, as well as a few others. Alex Harvey, Song Noir: Tom Waits and the City of Los Angeles provides many insights into the formation of Waits’s unique songwriting style and persona. The book delves into his early work when he was struggling in Los Angeles to make it on the music scene with his revival of what he calls “old man’s music.” I’ve been incorporating a few Tom Waits songs into my own repertoire of guitar songs, and it’s always helpful to get a sense of where the artist came from and why he wrote and performed as he did.\n\nMy focus this past year has been on Bob Dylan. I decided to make a consistent effort to memorize Dylan songs, and now have around 30 of them under my belt. Mostly these are his older tunes from the 1960s and ‘70s, with a few later ones thrown in for good measure. I’m still trying to digest some of his later stuff, which wasn’t on my radar screen until recently. In addition to listening to Dylan-focused podcasts such as Is It Rolling, Bob and Pod Dylan, I’ve been on a Dylan reading kick as well. Recently I read Tim Riley, Hard Rain: A Dylan Commentary. I knew Tim Riley from his book on the Beatles, Tell Me Why, which I acquired back in high school. I liked his humorous style and admired his ability to write critically and insightfully about songs I’d been listening to since I could remember. He wasn’t afraid of poking fun at a band that the world has put on an Olympic pedestal. With Hard Rain, he does pretty much the same with Dylan’s work up to the 1990s. I’m now reading Richard Thomas, Why Bob Dylan Matters, which is a somewhat more academic analysis of Dylan’s work, connecting his songs to, among other things, ancient Greek and Roman literature. I find it convincing. After all, the man teaches a course on Dylan at Harvard. But if you want to get into Dylan’s mind, one of the best ways other than his songs is to read his own book, Bob Dylan, Chronicles Volume I. As Thomas points out, the book is part truthful autobiography and part showmanship and bluster, but every page is bristling with insights into Dylan’s influences, musical and otherwise, and his unique ability to take the stuff around him and churn it into archetypes for songs.\n\nFiction\n\nWhile I tend to read a lot of nonfiction, I always try to have at least one work of fiction in my hands at any given time. This year I found Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Living to Tell the Tale in a local bookstore in Shanghai. It’s an autobiography of sorts, which is a fine counterpoint to his works of fiction such as Hundred Years of Solitude and Love in the Time of Cholera. It starts out with a deep account of an epic journey he took with his mother to the home of his childhood, which turns into a journey of memory and family stories. He moves on to discuss his transformation from a budding journalist into a writer of fiction. Like Dylan’s book, you can see how Marquez takes the material of his own life story and the people surrounding him, mythologizes them and turns them into fiction. As for this book, like Dylan’s Chronicles, I’d say it rests comfortably in the interzone between the spheres of fiction and nonfiction as many fine writers’ memoirs do.\n\nFew fiction writers have reached the status of James Joyce, the godfather of modernism, who did for fiction what Picasso did for painting in the 20th century. I confess that I haven’t read Ulysses—every attempt to do so has ended in failure—but this year I read Kari Maher, The Paris Bookseller, which focuses on the story of Sylvia Beach, the American expatriate in 1920s Paris whose book shop, Shakespeare and Co., became a lodestone for expatriate writers such Ezra Pound, James Joyces, Ernest Hemingway, and their books. She also took on the responsibility of publishing Ulysses at a time when the book was considered scandalous, especially in the USA, for its candid portrayal of everyday life in Dublin. While you don’t learn a great deal about the contents of this towering work of fiction, you do learn how it was published and all the struggles and ordeals that Sylvia Beach went through to help get it out into the world. It’s an intimate story about writers, publishers, and booksellers, couched in an overstory of a Sapphic romance (that makes two of them in one year).\n\nThe 1920s holds a special fascination for me, and my own research on Shanghai offers many parallels to what was going on in Paris, New York, and Berlin at the time. In fact, I used to teach a course on these cities focusing on the theme of nightlife. Later I developed a course on documenting cities. While searching for some materials on Berlin, I found this graphic novel, Jason Lutes, Berlin. I don’t read many graphic novels, but I found this one to be compelling, both in terms of the story and characters and their graphic treatment. The illustrations are astonishingly good. I was able to download the novel on Kindle and read it panel by panel. It tells of the high times but also the growing darkness of the period when Fascism and Nazism were on the rise is Germany and in Europe. I learned a great deal about the urban culture and the politics of 1920s Berlin and especially the plight of the working classes. And in the midst of it was yet another Sapphic romance (that makes three!).\n\nI don’t do a good job of keeping up with the latest fiction, but somehow Charles Frazier, The Trackers popped onto my radar screen. I remember enjoying his book Cold Mountain, about a Civil War soldier, and so I decided to give his latest novel a read. It also takes place in the period before World War II, focusing on an artist in Depression Era America who is hired to paint a mural for the post office in a town in Wyoming. Last year, I read about the mural painter Thomas Hart Benton (again, connecting to my course on documenting city life) and this proved to be a good counterpoint to the Henry Adams book Tom and Jack. In this novel, the key relationship that emerges is between the young artist and a wealthy resident who befriends him and provides housing for him on his ranch. He gets tangled in a relationship with the man’s wife after she disappears with a valuable painting, and he is sent out to find her. I think Cold Mountain was a sharper novel, but this one has its merits, as it paints a panoramic landscape of American society in that era.\n\nSanmao, Stories of the Saharah, was another work of semi-autobiographical literature that I enjoyed this year. I first encountered the adventuresome writer Sanmao in Taiwan when I was studying Chinese there in the late 1980s. It was a pleasure to return to her work and read this excellent translation of her stories about living in the Sahara with her Spanish husband, and their encounters and relationships with the local people. It’s a book that sits on the crossroads between fiction, autobiography, and ethnography. Though she certain was not an expert in the people and cultures of the place they lived, she does portray them in a vivid way. I haven’t read through all the stories but the ones I did read are evocative and hilarious in their own way. How expatriates survive in hostile environments that local people have spent centuries or millennia accommodating to is an interesting subject, and her eye for details makes it even more worthwhile. Is this Chinese literature? It was originally written (and I originally read a story or two) in Chinese language, so I suppose it qualifies. Yet it takes a refreshingly worldly perspective.\n\nAnother writer I first encountered while in Taiwan in the 1980s was Thomas Pynchon. While traveling to Hong Kong and in Mainland China for the first time, I read his novel Gravity’s Rainbow. I later reread that book a few times (it takes a few readings to appreciate the book, I think), and later tackled his other works, such as Mason & Dixon, Against the Day, and Vineland. One book that eluded me was V. I attempted to start it a few times but couldn’t seem to get through the first chapter. This fall I determined to get through the book and succeeded in doing so. Like Gravity’s Rainbow, it’s a novel that could take a few reads to plumb its depths. I don’t find it as compelling as GR, which is an epic adventure story set in WWII and postwar Europe, with historical excursions to other parts of the world. V is set in 1950s America, with historical forays to Malta, Venice, South Africa, and a few other places. It’s a bit of a mystery novel, with the main conceit being that a man is pursuing a shadowy figure named V through time. The counterpart to Tyrone Slothrop in this novel is Benny Profane. I confess to not following the story in all its intricacy, but the literary quality of the novel is stunning, especially given that this was his first novel. Now there’s only one novel in the Pynchon oeuvre that I still need to tackle, his last novel Bleeding Edge. Perhaps next year.\n\nThis year I also dug into John Le Carre’s classic novels Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and The Honorable Schoolboy. While far from the literary mysticism of Pynchon, Le Carre does share some qualities with Pynchon, including a penchant for convoluted mystery stories that range widely in time and place, carrying the reader around the world. And conspiracy looms in both the Pynchonian and Carrean worlds. Both writers explore the shadow worlds of governments and spies advancing different and conflicting ideological systems. Both involve picaresque, deeply flawed heroes (anti-heroes really) who deploy special and often hidden powers to crack the mysteries, including their sexual prowess. Honorable Schoolboy takes the reader into Hong Kong among other places. Apparently the author did his due diligence and comes up with a credible and convincing depiction of this part of the world. I had never read Le Carre before and I was surprised by the literary quality of his writing. I will certainly come back to him in the future.\n\nNonfiction and Philosophy\n\nOn the advice of a Russian colleague, I read Roger T. Ames, Human Becomings, a reinterpretation of the ancient Chinese works of philosophical and political thought that I’ve been teaching all these years. Ames retranslates many of the terms that we’ve come to take for granted in an attempt to remove some of the Christian influences on Chinese thought (the earliest translators and interpreters were Christian missionaries) and get at the heart of the original thinking behind these key concepts. I think I need to reread sections of this book, but it definitely gets you to rethink some of the core ideas of classical Chinese civilization.\n\nOn another note, I found Edward Slingerland, Drunk: How We Sipped, Danced, and Stumbled Our Way to Civilization to be right up my alley. As a historian and scholar of nightlife and music, alcohol plays a big role in my research subject, and I think the author is on to something when he claims that alcohol has been a key aspect of human social development since prehistoric times. As somebody who has over-indulged in booze on many an occasion, and who has championed the role of nightlife in society, I am a longstanding member of the choir to which this book is preaching.\n\nAs I delved into their discography, I came to know their individual personalities as well as their contributions to the songs. At the time, other than what was available on or inside the albums themselves, or films like Hard Day’s Night, there was very little visual material to go with the listening experience. Instead, one had to imagine them singing and playing the music. As with many boys who grow up with the four lads, they became like imaginary friends and boon companions. In times of trouble, they were there to keep me company and assuage my sorrows. They were the brothers I never had in real life. They never judged me, and they were always there with supportive and kind advice.\n\nAt the same time, I was keenly aware that the Beatles had broken up as a band around the time I was born in 1969. They had all gone their own ways and were making their own music, as post-Beatles individuals or with new bands like Wings. We had the McCartney album Ram, and I loved Ringo’s album Blast From Your Past, which came out when I was five. I didn’t have any John or George albums but was aware of their solo efforts, which were often on the radio. When John died in 1980, we all mourned his senseless death, and my sixth grade class held a vigil in his memory. I dreamed that the Beatles were getting in a Volkswagen Beetle and saying goodbye forever.\n\nFast forward to the 1990s, when I was a graduate student at Columbia University living in the Upper West Side of Manhattan. It had been a while since I’d delved into Beatles music. In college, I became obsessed with classical music. In graduate school, I’d been listening to a lot of other music, including jazz, and getting into New York sounds like Lou Reed, Tom Waits, and the Rolling Stones (for me, Beatles are Boston, and Stones are New York City). Then, in 1995, the Anthology documentary series came out, along with an album of Beatles tunes that I’d never heard before, or never heard in the way they were playing them. I devoured both the series, which aired on TV, and the CDs, listening to them over and over. They were both a revelation. Suddenly, we had intimate access to the visual archive and storytelling of the Fab Four, and to their recording studio where we could hear them coming up with their songs. We were able to see and hear them in deeper, richer tones and in a new light. To top it off, they released two new Beatles songs, which nobody had ever heard before. I couldn’t have imagined this happening in my wildest dreams. “Free as a Bird” was the first to come out. It was accompanied by a cool video with clues to myriad Beatles songs in a Liverpuddlian landscape, a kind of Beatles dreamscape that paid homage to John Lennon. Then there was “Real Love.” With Lennon’s voice blended with the others, and with soaring harmonies and scintillating guitar solos by George, both songs sounded like the Beatles. For me there was no question that these were Beatles songs, even though we had to accept that John wasn’t there to complete them with the other three.\n\nSince then, there have been various new releases of Beatles music in different guises and forms. And in 2021, we were thrilled by the Get Back documentary series by Peter Jackson, which once again brought us into the intimate arena of the Beatles as they struggled to make the album Let it Be and perform their last concert on the Apple building rooftop in London. We witnessed their efforts to create new music together and overcome their differences to create what would be the final and one of the best Beatles albums (despite the well acknowledged overproduction of the album by Phil Spector).\n\nNow, in November 2023, another Beatles miracle has been performed. A third and final Beatles song has emerged from the recordings made by Lennon before his untimely death. This was supposed to be included with the Anthology series, but at the time, John’s voice couldn’t be separated from his piano work. Now, with the technology of AI and the innovations of Peter Jackson and his team, they can do so, and John’s voice comes out crystal clear in the recording. The remaining two Beatles, Paul and Ringo, worked along with Giles Martin, the son of George Martin who contributed so much to the Beatles oeuvre, to complete the song. It’s a true labor of love. Both men are now in their 80s, and they have long since lost two of the closest companions of their youth, the only other two men who knew what it was to be a Beatle. This song is a testament to that four-way friendship and collaboration that created some of the best popular music of all time.\n\nSince it was released a week ago, the song “Now and Then” has stirred up a lot of discussion and debate on social media. I’ve been following posts on Facebook and have seen many videos on Youtube discussing the song and its back story, and I’ve formed my own opinions of the song as well. One of the questions that has emerged is, is this truly a Beatles song? With two of the members long since passed on, what makes it so? Another question people are asking is why they decided to leave out the “middle 8” part that John originally recorded, the part with the lines “use you and abuse you” in it? A third question is, regardless of whether this is really a Beatles song, is it a good one?\n\nPersonally, I’ve gone back and forth on all these questions. Of course, we must accept that this is officially a Beatles song as it has been released as such. And who can doubt the word of Sir Paul, or Ringo, or Giles son of George Martin, or the estates of John and George? Yet what makes a song a Beatles song? Why were we more ready to accept the earlier releases of “Free as a Bird” and “Real Love” as Beatles songs, but more reticent to do so with “Now and Then”?\n\nFor one thing, back in the 1990s, three of the Beatles (or the Threetles as some like to call them) were still alive. A tripod stands up well on its own. Now, George is long gone (he passed in 2001), and only Paul and Ringo were left to finish the work they’d started in the 1990s. And we have some testimony that George thought the song was “rubbish.” Was it just the recording he was talking about, or was it the song itself? One can imagine that George wasn’t too pleased with the “heart on sleeve” lyrics that John had come up with for the song. Or was it the strange chord progressions and the movement from A minor to G major? I haven’t done any further research on this question of George’s response to the song, so I don’t know and certainly would be curious to learn more about his attitude toward the song. Nevertheless, he did some guitar work on behalf of the song before they scrapped it. But for me, one key thing that’s missing from the song, which was such a huge part of the first two songs, is a George guitar solo. Does that make is any less of a Beatles song? Perhaps not.\n\nWhat about the missing “middle 8” part? Why did they remove it? Was it the lyrics? Or did the chord progression and melody just not fit in well with the rest of the song? Apparently, this was Paul’s decision. Nobody can doubt Paul’s musical genius, after all he wrote some of the most cherished songs in the history of popular music. Yet by removing this part, did they also remove some of the depth of the original song, with John singing “I don’t want to lose you”? It seems that John is crying out for love in this part, and that’s missing from the version they released last week.\n\nIf John is mourning a lost love, what is the true nature of this song? It got me thinking that this song could be a lament at the death of a loved one. Who would that be? Could it be John’s own mother Julia, who he wrote one of his best songs about on the White Album? That song also happens to be the longest single-note song that John ever sang (18 single notes in a row—thanks to the podcast Something About the Beatles for this insight!). What could be more painful than losing one’s own mother in a freak bus accident? Especially when she wasn’t a big part of his life to begin with, and maybe she would have become so if it hadn’t been for her sudden loss? Paul also lost his mother, who later came to him in a dream when the band was on the verge of breakup and famously told him to “let it be.” Many people have speculated that the death of their mothers brought the two lads closer together. Then in 1980, John was killed in an even more senseless and meaningless act of violence. To this day, no true Beatles fan has ever really gotten over that. Certain I haven’t.\n\nThus, the resurrection of John through AI is kind of a holy moment in the history of the Beatles and of pop music. His voice re-emerges clear as a bell to give us a final message. Paul, the apostle, is carrying that message forward, along with Ringo and the others. The message is a deep one about friendship, love, and loss. And we should all heed it carefully.\n\nAs I was deep diving into this song and its origins, I was also carrying on a big project of digitizing old videos and film in my own personal collection. My own near death last summer due to a health crisis that I may discuss another time made me realize that the most important aspect of life is one’s relationships with family and friends, in that order. I’ve been going through my own personal collection of photos and videos and sending out copies to friends and family this fall, as a way of reconnecting with old friends and remembering the times and the bonds that brought us together. As I was listening to the final resurrection of the Beatles, I was scanning slides and sending out photos to friends and reconnecting all the dots that brought us together and reminiscing on some of the good times we had. Somehow this converged with the project of reviving this old tune of John’s that became a Beatles song as the other three members of the band came together to complete it in their own way. As I sent out each photo, I could have added the words, “Now and then, I miss you.”\n\nAs I write this post from my apartment in Shanghai, the city is undergoing its most intense encounter with COVID since the virus started plaguing the world in early 2020. For reasons we can try to guess at but will likely never truly understand, the government of China decided quite suddenly to end its “Zero Covid” campaign earlier in December. Since then, a “tsunami” of Covid infections has hit the populations of China’s biggest cities. Even small town and village life has been affected, at least in the area I live in neighboring Kunshan.\n\nAmong people I know in China, which includes family, friends, colleagues, students, and many others in my life, the initial reaction to the end of “Zero Covid” was one of relief. Having been through a challenging year of lockdowns, restrictions, obstructions, daily tests, QR codes, travel codes, school entry codes, and so forth, we were all ready to move on with our lives. If the price of entry into a more normal state of being was catching the virus, it seems that most people were willing to pay that price.\n\nOver the month of December, almost everyone I know in China caught the virus. Some had a mild reaction to it, while others suffered through several days of fevers, chills, body aches, and other symptoms associated with the virus. Some recovered quickly, while others had persistent coughs and fatigue. It didn’t help that the years of masking and social distancing had probably weakened everyone’s immune systems. Yet I don’t know of anybody in my circles who had to have emergency health care treatment.\n\nWhile catching Covid was a very scary proposition during the early months of the outbreak back in 2020, over the past year that fear diminished. It seems that the greatest worry for people in China in 2022 was of being sent to a “quarantine camp” or special facility, which was the policy for those who tested positive up until last December. Once that policy ended, I think people were far less concerned about testing positive. In fact, it quickly became a source of amusement and humor with endless references in social media to 小阳 “little positives” a synonym in Chinese with 小羊 “little lambs”.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that people aren’t taking precautions. Most people still wear masks outdoors, even though they aren’t mandated anymore. I’ve even seen my neighbors in Kunshan wearing masks inside their own homes. I don’t know if they are being extra cautious and/or if someone in the home caught the virus. I live in a remote area of Kunshan, a relatively rural area of farmlands and fields, and even there, people are acting very cautious. Thus, it would be misleading to state that people in China have given up on protecting themselves from the virus. But the consequences of catching it are quite different to what they were up until a month ago.\n\nIn my own case, I decided to play it safe and stay in my home in Kunshan while the virus was raging in Shanghai. By mid-December both my wife and daughter, who live in Shanghai, had the virus, so for me going back to Shanghai would have meant getting exposed to it for certain. I ended up spending my birthday weekend and the following Christmas weekend alone in my house, and for three weeks I saw nobody outside of my immediate neighbors. By late December, my wife and daughter had recovered from the virus, though they still complained of fatigue and had persistent coughs. I decided to return to Shanghai for New Year’s weekend. I still played it safe and stayed home or took lone walks with my dog in and around our neighborhood. I’m trying to avoid this current wave, though I figure it’s only a matter of time before I too am exposed to the virus. Yet life goes on, and I can’t stay in my fortress of solitude forever.\n\nWhile there has undoubtedly been a huge wave of viral infections since the change in policy was announced in early December, that wave already seems to be receding, at least in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Through most of December, both cities were like ghost towns, with residents either suffering from the virus and/or sheltering in their homes. In the past few days, I’ve heard and seen reports of cities coming back to life and people going out to dine and even to drink in local bars. It should be added that since the change in policy in December, there are no more restrictions on entering these places, so it’s a matter of preference now.\n\nPeople whom I know in China are now waxing optimistic about the coming year. As soon as this wave diminishes, and as soon as “herd immunity” kicks in, people will be very happy to see their daily lives returning to normal without all the restrictions and the fears of lockdowns, green fences, quarantine camps and so forth. We are also very excited to have the opportunity to travel again both in China and abroad, and already a flood tide of people are leaving the country. Happily, the policy of quarantining incoming people upon their arrival to China is ending soon. On a sour note, other countries have laid on new policies and restrictions against people traveling from China, mainly asking for evidence of negative tests. In some cases, people from China are even banned from entering the country. This is all temporary though and I’m sure it won’t last long.\n\nMy prediction is that sometime after the Chinese New Year, people will have largely moved on, as they have already done in most other parts of the world. Yes, there will be casualties, as there were in enormous numbers even in such advanced countries as the USA. Yes, the virus will come and go, and some people will be reinfected. Yet over time, immunity levels will rise and Covid will indeed become something akin to a typical flu virus. I think this is what the government was banking on when they decided to end the “Zero Covid” campaign. Over time, we will have a much better understanding of the causes and consequences of the policy and its sudden ending. For now, I remain cautiously optimistic that our lives in China can be groovy once again.\n\nIt has become a year-end tradition of mine to post about books I read over the previous year. And as any reader of my blogsite this past year knows, 2022 has been a challenging year for me and for all of us (all 1.4 billion of us) living in China. The “Zero Covid” policy of the government has been a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it kept most of us Covid-free for the past three years. On the other hand, it meant dealing with a load of nuisances (such as daily testing), disruptions, restrictions, isolation, and lockdowns, as well as the possibility of being sent to a quarantine camp.\n\nSo, on to the point of this post: Which books kept me company during all those months of solitude on the lakeside? Not academic reading mind you, but reading for pure pleasure, as well as for personal enlightenment? Then again, as a humanist with a broad spectrum of academic interests, most of my reading relates to my work. This year, my favorite reads fell into three basic categories. First, there were books about music. Second, art. Third, epic fantasy/sci-fi novels. In other words, typical fare. Here are some of my top reads in 2022.\n\nI started the year with a spate of books on music scenes and rock bands. This might have had something to do with my own rock band forming and starting to perform in clubs in Shanghai. I shouldn’t say “my own band”, since a band is a collaboration that doesn’t belong to any one person, unless you happen to David Bowie or Prince or somebody special like that. Our band didn’t last long—it fell apart during the spring lockdown when most of the band members left China (and still haven’t returned). Anyhow, I was inspired by this experience to read about some of the bands and scenes that left the deepest impression on me since I was a child.\n\nI began the year with a deep dive into the So-Cal Canyon scene of the late 1960s and early ‘70s. I’ve been fascinated with that scene for many years now and have seen several documentaries about it. Reading Hotel California by Barney Hoskyns brought me deeper into that world. While the book recounts the rise of America’s greatest country rock band, the Eagles, it puts their story into the context of the scene that developed around the Troubador and the folks who inspired a whole generation of musicians to pick up their guitars and write their own songs. Those musicians and bands who flocked to the Canyon scene included Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne, the Byrds, the Beach Boys, and many more. Even bands across the pond like Led Zeppelin, the Beatles, and Eric Clapton and Cream were influenced by that scene.\n\nSpeaking of Led Zeppelin, early in the year I chose the massive biography of the band by Bob Spitz as my boon winter companion. I’d enjoyed his book on the Beatles, and next to them, Zep was probably the most influential band of my childhood (ok, maybe the Who, but close). I relished the opportunity to delve into this band’s history and learn more about their magical recipe for making epic rock music. I wasn’t disappointed, though I must say you need to be a hardcore fan of the band to slog through this humongous tome. As is typical with band stories, the early years are the most interesting, when the band is forming and going through the experimental stage of figuring out what it is about. Then you follow the band through the cycles of concert tours and record albums. Things get repetitive after a while, but you learn how each album was crafted and what the inspirations were and how the band worked together to make their magic. You also learn what it took to take this band on the road, and the special role played by their manager in the process. I’d say the highlight for me was reading about how their fourth album, the one with “Stairway to Heaven”, came together.\n\nAfter I polished off that epic band biography, I moved on to the R.E.M. bio by Tony Fletcher, The Perfect Circle. It felt similar in some ways to the Zep bio, yet without the over-the-top antics of the band members, who are low key in comparison to the Zep lads. There’s the origin story, which takes place in Athens Georgia, followed by the crafting of a particular sound and style, the years of slogging away in small scenes, the rise to the top of the music scene, and then the efforts of an aging band to stay relevant in a music industry that favors the young. I came out of this read with a much greater appreciation for the rich and long-lasting musical legacy left by R.E.M. which was one of the more inspiring bands for me as a teenager in the 1980s.\n\nLater in the summer, after participating in a mini-concert of Grateful Dead tunes for Jerry Garcia’s 80th birthday in Shanghai, I picked up the Dead bio So Many Roads by David Browne. This book takes an alternative approach, focusing on several key years in the history of the band. While it was an enlightening read, I confess that I didn’t get more than halfway through the book, mainly because I was interested more in the early years of the Dead and the crafting of their distinctive musical sound and style. As with many musician bio pics, the story of the rise of a band is more interesting than its slog through the middle years or the end of the band, though some endings are more spectacular than others (e.g. the Eagles).\n\nLast spring, for the first time in my career, I taught a “mini-course” on songwriting to a group of talented students at DKU. In the process, I absorbed several books on songwriting. These included Jeff Tweedy’s How to Write One Song, which combines some humorous observations and anecdotes with some practical advice on crafting song lyrics. Then there was Mary Gauthier’s Saved by a Song, a more serious and semi-autobiographical book about songwriting that encourages us to dig deep into the traumas that make us want to write songs. While teaching the course on songwriting, I focused on some Burt Bacharach songs, and I ended up reading his autobiography, Anyone Who Had a Heart. I was surprised at how enjoyable this was and came out with a greater appreciation for the craft of the professional songwriter, who writes songs that others will perform. I also read Beeswing by the folk-rock artist Richard Thompson, more of an autobiography than a how-to book on songwriting, though the author provides many insights into his own creative process as well as the folk scene in which he was a part during and after his stint with Fairport Convention.\n\nIn addition to forming a rock band, this past year I rediscovered my childhood love for making art. While spending my “hundred days of solitude” in the lake house during the spring lockdown event, I got into watercolor painting and drawing. I found myself diving into countless youtube how-to videos and reading books about painting and drawing techniques. Most of these books I was able to download and read for free through Kindle Unlimited. In addition, I rekindled my love for art through reading books about great artists. One was Matisse & The Joy of Drawing by Christopher Lloyd. I found this book in the Foreign Languages Bookstore in Shanghai. It’s partly a biography of the artist, but also a tribute to his skills as a draftsman, not just a painter. And it shows how drawing was so essential to his art throughout his career, even though he was largely self-trained. I found this inspiring as I threw myself into painting and drawing for the first time in decades.\n\nAnother art-related book that proved inspiring was Tom and Jack by Henry Adams. This is the story of the complex relationship that unfolded between two great artists of the twentieth century, Thomas Hart Benton and Jackson Pollock. The author argues that Benton was critical to the development of Pollock’s art, even though he forsook his mentor in later years. I’d taken an interest in Benton’s mural work while teaching a Media Arts course last spring on depictions of urban life. My dad recommended the book, which indeed turned out to be a great read on how visual artists draw from great traditions and add their own experiences and creative powers to push the boundaries of modern art, much as musicians do in the world of modern music. It gave me a much deeper appreciation of Pollock’s work as well.\n\nWhile much of my fall reading was taken up preparing to teach a course I hadn’t taught before on Medieval China, I continued to indulge in reading pleasures with novels consumed late at night (I often wake up in the middle of the night and read for an hour or two before falling asleep again). One book on my reading list was Neal Stephenson’s latest novel Terminal Shock. I’ve read most of Stephenson’s novels and this one promised to face the future and current problem of global warming/climate change and propose a possible solution. As usual it was filled with technical details and very minute blow-by-blow action scenes, and the characters were compelling and wide-ranging. As for the proposed solution and whether it succeeds, I’ll leave it to the reader to learn about it on their own, but Stephenson regards it from every possible angle from the perspective of global politics as the world confronts rising ocean levels. Let’s just say that the Dutch figure into the story in a big way, as does a Texan billionaire, and a Canadian Indian martial artist.\n\nIn preparation for my course on Medieval China, I attempted to read China’s greatest novel, The Romance of Three Kingdoms, in a relatively unabridged version in English. The story takes place after the fall of the mighty Han Dynasty circa 200 AD, when my course begins. It is an epic novel about wars and battles fought among the rivals as they play a Chinese version of “game of thrones”. Speaking of which, reading that novel inspired me to pick up the Game of Thrones series by George R. R. Martin, whose actual title is A Song of Fire and Ice. I finished the first book A Game of Thrones during the spring of 2020 when we first started sheltering from Covid. I’d started the second novel A Clash of Kings but got distracted by other things, and so this past November I decided to dive back into it. Not only did I rush through that novel, I went onto book 3, A Storm of Swords, and read it as if possessed.\n\nThose of us who have watched the GoT series before reading the books probably can’t help but see the faces of the actors and recall the visual scenes of the series as we read about them. Yet after reading the books a while, I find that the characters achieve a richness, nuance, and complexity far beyond the TV series and that they take up their own life in my mind. As any fan can tell you, the books are so much richer and deeper than the TV show, especially when you consider all the historical tales that the characters tell each other. I also appreciate the important role that music and songs play in the books, as they did in the medieval era and in our modern age as well.\n\nAs for how the Game of Thrones series compares to the Chinese story of the Three Kingdoms, I’d say that there are enormous parallels yet also some key differences of course. The Game of Thrones was inspired by British and French history, yet there are some fundamental features of the medieval age of feudalism, whether in China or in Europe, and something in that age that inevitably appeals to readers in the modern age.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the government finally let go of the “Zero Covid” policy. Now, it seems all of China is testing positive for Covid, and there’s a lack of medications and hospitals are overrun with feverish patients. Go figure. Not that I know any of this except from hearsay. I’ve been sheltering in my lake house on Dianshan Lake in Kunshan for the past two weeks ever since news of the rapid spread of Covid began to reach my eyes and ears. I’m used to the solitude by now. I’d estimate that I’ve spent nearly six months alone in and around my lake house this past year, mostly because of the Zero Covid policy, but now because it has finally ended. One key thing missing from Game of Thrones, at least the books I’ve read so far, is the plague. At least that’s one feature of medieval life that we can still enjoy in our contemporary world.\n\nFor nearly two months now, I’ve been immobilized in my new lakeside neighborhood in Kunshan (see my previous post). In line with Shanghai’s much harsher lockdown, the Kunshan lockdown began in March, solidified in April, and started loosening up in May. For the past two weeks I’ve been able to leave my compound and drive all the way to the center of Kunshan City, where I was able to replenish some of my dwindling supplies. Also, after being nearly empty for the past month, the shelves of our local neighborhood shops once again have a full array of items, albeit limited in scope. And packages are being delivered to my doorstep once more. I had a number of packages on hold that I’d order on Taobao several weeks ago. Normally items take a few days at most to reach your doorstep here in China, but everything was put on hold for the entire month of April and well into May. Now the delivery trucks are once again speeding through our neighborhood with boxes of goods. It feels like the end of a long bout of constipation.\n\nThe past few weeks have been quite an ordeal for everyone. In addition to the isolation and immobilization, there’s also been the great uncertainty of how long this lockdown would continue and also what would happen if the virus continues to spread. The thought of being sent to a quarantine camp is not a pleasant one to say the least.\n\nOn the other hand, compared to my friends and family stuck in their apartments in Shanghai, my lockdown experience has been a mild one. Every day, I go on long walks in our neighborhood with my dog. We average close to 10K of walking per day. I know all the best routes and the best stopping points. Naturally, the lakeside walks are the best, and now that they are strewn with purple and yellow flowers, they are glorious walks indeed.\n\nOne place I visit daily is a small grass and flower-covered hillock overlooking the small lake in our community. It’s private property, but the house is unoccupied and the gates are wide open. In addition to me and my dog, others go there daily to fish, although technically this isn’t allowed and the police cart comes by now and then to scatter the fishermen.\n\nI enjoy sitting on the hillock looking out over the lake in its various moods and watching the birds. There are several white egrets that contest for territory, preferring to strut along the buoy-boundary fences in the water as they hunt for fish. A family of little grebes floats and dives in the lake. I also see fishing boats now and then. Today an older couple were pulling up nets in various spots around the lake. There are also boats for hourly rent, including colorful kayaks and canoes. I may try them out later in the season.\n\nAfter a few minutes at the lakeside, I wander back home, tracing a circular route that takes me through the neighborhoods of our community. Sometimes I stop to identify trees and flowers. The loquats are bursting now with yellow fruits. There are oleanders with purple and white flowers. There are St. Johnswort flowers, all yellow with bristling stamens. Today I spotted a sweetgum.\n\nThe most ubiquitous are the camphor trees, which line all the roads. They provide excellent shade. They are also very messy trees in springtime. In March, they drop their purple drupes all over the roads. Then they shed their leaves, which turn yellow, red, purple and finally brown, and immediately they grow new leaves. Then their tiny little yellow flowers grow and disperse all over the streets. Meanwhile, the local ladies hired to sweep the streets are kept busy all spring.\n\nSince the lockdown lifted earlier in May, people have visibly relaxed. Many people don’t even wear masks outdoors anymore, and the local shopkeepers aren’t wearing them either. I guess everyone feels much safer now that numbers in Kunshan have dropped back to zero and people are being tested no longer on a daily basis but at least every two or three days. It seems that our community has now cut down the testing to once every three days, though they never seem to be able to state a clear policy around the testing. Instead, it’s “wait until we’re informed (by the government)”. Everybody’s in the dark in one way or other.\n\nDespite the lifting of travel restrictions within Kunshan, I’m still choosing to lay low and stay in and around my neighborhood. I’ve been on two car trips to the city center to resupply; both times I’ve visited the German superstore called Metro. Both times I found plenty of stuff, yet I was disappointed by their lack of imported items including coffee beans, Italian pasta, and tonic water. Still, I was able to restock my liquor cabinets, fill the fridge with beer, and stuff the freezer with cuts of chicken and beef.\n\nThe biggest change for me has been my ability to make bread. Until the lockdown began, I’d never baked a loaf in my life. But after all the bread disappeared off the shelves, the need arose. Fortunately, the local shop still carried plenty of yeast and flour. I started watching how-to videos on Youtube. I recommend watching a few of them to get different tips and learn different techniques. Now I bake a loaf of bread every week. I also make homemade pizzas and banana bread. The bread I make now is fresher and tastier than any of the store-bought bread you can buy in China, except perhaps the specialized breads in shops like Baker & Spice in Shanghai.\n\nA couple weeks ago, while I was walking back home from the local shops, I was approached by a Frenchman who also lives in our community. He invited me to join him and an Englishman and their wives for dinner. We exchanged Wechats. Later, we all met for a long lunch. I also invited another foreigner who I’d seen a few times on the road, who was always friendly and said hello even at the height of the lockdown when we were all masking. It was drizzling that afternoon, and we found a covered pavilion to sit while we enjoyed a potluck lunch together with some wine, beer, and whiskey.\n\nA few days later, I invited the group to join me for a BBQ dinner at my home. This was the first time I had a chance to use my new backyard grill. Fortunately, one member of the party turns out to be a veteran grill-master and showed me the ropes. We had a nice evening eating beef and chicken kebabs and home-made bread while chatting on my back porch. At one point I brought out my guitar. I hadn’t played songs for other people since the lockdown began, and since I’d been working on a whole new set-list of songs, I tried some of them out on the group. They seemed to appreciate the live show.\n\nThis is one thing I miss from the “normal days” of Shanghai prior to the lockdown, when we had a band going and were jamming and gigging all around town in local clubs and bars. Maybe we will be able to revive that scene. But since the lockdown in Shanghai is still ongoing and nobody knows for sure when and how things will return to normal again, everything is up in the air.\n\nAs the lockdowns in China progress, many foreigners have indicated their desire to leave the country, temporarily if not permanently. Some have already left for their home countries or for greener pastures. One of my old friends from Beijing moved down to Thailand recently, citing difficulties returning to China as the main reason. Some people predict another mass exodus of foreigners from China. Since 2020, the number of foreigners in China has already halved, and it may halve again according to some predictions.\n\nI have no plans to leave the country any time soon. It’s still too expensive to fly back and forth to China, the process of returning here is complicated, and the quarantine time is very long. I would love to spend part of the summer back in the States visiting family and friends, regardless of the current situation, but I don’t think I can afford to do so right now. I’m hoping that traveling will ease up over the next year or so.\n\nAs for the overall impact of the lockdown on Shanghai, this remains to be seen. I am confident that the city will be able to spring back into a glorious existence. Yet this may take some time and a great deal of healing. We shall see. The next few weeks and months will be interesting indeed.\n\nLast winter, I decided to move my residence in Kunshan. After living in the same place for nearly seven years, I felt I needed a change of scenery. Also, the neighborhood I was living in had been thoroughly transformed and urbanized over those years. Even though it boasts a wonderful park (Forest Park), it has become a noisy mess, with a new subway line being built along the main road (Qianjin Road), and constant construction of buildings in all directions. Moreover, my next-door neighbor decided without consulting or informing neighbors, as is the usual case here, to thoroughly renovate their apartment, which resulted in a great deal of banging, chiseling, hammering and various other noises and smells emanating daily from the walls and hall of my apartment, a place that I often use as my primary workspace. This was the decisive signal that it was time to move on.\n\nMoving out was not an easy decision. Over the years, I’d made my apartment in Kunshan into a cozy home. I’d cleaned up and fixed out the balcony, which was a wonderful space overlooking the canopy of trees outside the fourth-floor apartment. I had spent much of the previous year fixing up the kitchen, which was now a fine place to cook, eat, and watch the birds flitting about the canopy of trees outside the windows. Recently I’d acquired an amiable flatmate, a colleague from DKU where I’ve been working and teaching for seven years now. Perhaps the finest point of the apartment is that it is a ten-minute drive to campus. At DKU, I was the pioneer settler of this apartment complex, which hosts thousands of residents in dozens of high-rise apartments. Over the years, as DKU expanded its faculty and staff base, dozens of other colleagues moved into this apartment complex and into the neighboring complexes, creating a vibrant community of DKUers.\n\nThus, it wasn’t easy to depart the apartment and the neighborhood. Nevertheless, I persisted in searching for a new place, and I targeted the lake district to the south. I wanted to find a bigger place, one where I could hold parties, host events, and even arrange sleepovers for friends and family coming out to the countryside from Shanghai, a kind of B&B if you will (call me Basil Fawlty). I envisioned a place with a back yard where I could cook up barbeques on a grill and sit on the back porch in the early evening with a beer in hand, strumming on my guitar in the light of the setting sun. I also envisioned a music room where I could play my instruments and invite my bandmates, students and others to practice or record music.\n\nLo and behold, I found such a place, a house in a community off the biggest lake in the region, Dianshan Lake. I hadn’t spent much time in that region since joining DKU and moving to Kunshan. I’d been to some of the water-towns such as Zhouzhuang and Jinxi, which are quite attractive if touristy, but other than that I hadn’t had any reason to explore this area of Kunshan. After communicating with an agent, I was shown a home for a very reasonable rent, not much more than what I was already paying for my apartment. I looked at a few other places nearby, which were more expensive and not as charming. The clincher was that the home was fitted with a karaoke room, soundproofed, which made a perfect music room. Also, it was a two-minute walk to the lakeside. Those two factors sold me on the place.\n\nI started moving in at the end of winter. In March, I took a few carloads of stuff from my apartment and started settling into the new place. Then the lockdowns began. At first, I was stuck in the new neighborhood for two weeks because I had been to Shanghai and my travel code had a star on it. They wouldn’t let me drive or even walk out of the compound. As soon as I was free, I drove to campus to grab some books for my new course on Documenting City Life. I also went to the Metro shopping center to stock up on supplies of food and beverages, and I grabbed a bunch of stuff from my apartment, including my record collection, to bring to my new home. You never know when you’ll need to put on an album to comfort you in these times.\n\nI had a hunch that things would close down further, since the situation in Shanghai was getting more intense over the month of March. People in Pudong were being asked to stay in their homes. “Asked” is a mild term for it. Puxi was next. By the end of the month, the city announced a five-day lockdown plan, with Pudong first and Puxi next. I couldn’t even get back to Shanghai, since all the highways were blocked. (All of this is well known and I also discuss it in a couple of podcast interviews I’ve done recently, so I won’t go into details.) Suffice it to say that the initial lockdown plan was extended indefinitely, and as of April 24, there is still no clear indication of when the people of Shanghai will be released from this total lockdown. My wife and daughters have been stuck inside our Shanghai apartment for 24 days now, as have millions of others. A few neighborhoods have been allowed some freedom, but in a very limited way, and for all practical purposes the city is still completely shut down.\n\nMeanwhile, here in Kunshan, roads were being closed and roadblocks going up, more and more every day. Eventually we also settled into a lockdown, though a softer one than in Shanghai. People were forced to stay in their communities and could only go out of their residential areas occasionally to buy food. I was completely cut off from the northern and central districts of Kunshan where my campus, apartment, and the major food centers are located. It’s a good thing I’d prepared for such an outcome and had stocked my larder with food and drink supplies. Now, for the past month or more, I’ve basically been confined to my own neighborhood residence. For a while, we were still able to walk outside the residence and enjoy the beautiful lakeside walks that my new neighborhood affords. More recently, these perambulations have been strongly discouraged and more guards are posted on the main gates of our residential area to deter us from going out of them. The exterior entrances to the food and goods shops lining the main gates of our residence have also been shut, and you need to enter these establishments from the back doors inside the residence.\n\nFor a while, it was getting hard to find fresh vegetables and fruits, let alone anything else. More recently, the fresh fruits and vegetables have returned to the local shelves, though at much higher prices than usual. Last week I paid around 75 RMB for a melon!\n\nIn many respects it’s been a soft and easy lockdown for me. I live in a large home now, with few neighbors. I have an entire backyard to myself, which I share only with the chattering birds and the buzzing bees. The residential area in which I live is very expansive, lined with large houses (mostly empty) and flowering trees, and has canals and a smaller lake. The month of April has been gorgeous, and I get to experience the flowering of various trees, bushes, and plants. I can take long walks with my dog on the tree-lined streets, soaking in the redolent aroma of the flowering plants and trees. I have even been able to head out to the lakeside for a few long walks. I can also cycle around the neighborhood.\n\nMost of the residents here seem to be quite well educated. Mandarin Chinese seems to be the main language that I hear, although some people speak in the Shanghainese dialect. Judging from the license plates of cars parked in front of various residences, people are mainly either from Jiangsu Province or Shanghai. The occupancy rate for the homes here seems to be very low. I was told this is more of a weekend-holiday-summer retreat area, so I suspect in normal times people head here from the cities for weekend and summer fun. There are gazebos and pavilions lining the lakeside, where people can hold barbeques. There is a boat rental business at one of the gates, with canoes, kayaks and other boats for rent. I’ve seen a few kayakers on the smaller lake and I plan to try that out myself one of these days.\n\nAll in all it’s really paid off for me to move here. To be sure, the commute to campus is much longer, around 30-40 minutes in normal times. But that’s a moot point right now, since the campus is in a “closed loop system” and most of us aren’t allowed on campus even if we could travel there. Instead we are all teaching online again. I have mixed feelings about this. My current course lends itself well to online teaching since we do a lot of analysis and interpretation of artworks, photographs, films, and other visual records of urban life. Of course my plan to have the students conduct their own fieldwork was completely scuttled by the lockdown.\n\nOn the other hand, I’m glad to take a break from the constant grind of commuting for a while. Normally I drive to Shanghai every weekend, and also around the area of Kunshan and environs for various reasons. I haven’t even entered my car in over a month now.\n\nNaturally, I’m looking forward to reuniting with my family and friends in Shanghai, and with colleagues and students in Kunshan as well. I suspect that this madness will end soon, perhaps in the next month or so. Meanwhile, I’m trying to take advantage of my solitude to enjoy and explore my new environs, and to catch up with some research projects that I can do from home. One of my big rationales for moving here in the first place was to have a “fortress of solitude” where I can conduct “deep work”, not unlike Carl Jung and his castle. Fate and the PRC government have now dictated that I have that solitude whether I like it or not.\n\nLast July I decided to step off the Facebook merry-go-round for an unspecified length of time. I can’t say there was any singular motivation do so. Instead, it was a combination of factors. For one, I found myself obsessing way too much about Facebook posting, and probably sharing too much info about myself. In any case, I felt I had to get some distance from Zuck & Crew.\n\nBefore I get to the benefits of a withdrawal period from Facebook and other social media, and what I learned in the process of disconnecting and eventually reconnecting, allow me share the story of how I got hooked on Facebook in the first place.\n\nIn 2006, I was invited to join Facebook by some of my students at UNSW. At that time, Facebook was new, and you had to be a member of a university to join, as I recall. Also, this was before the age of smart phones and iPads, and the only way to get on Facebook was on one’s computer.\n\nFor the first few years, I would occasionally post on Facebook and check others’ posts as the platform developed. Over the years, more and more people joined and connected and there were more reasons to use Facebook. It was fun to reconnect with old friends and classmates who I hadn’t seen or heard from in years if not decades. But my relationship with Facebook was still rather casual and distant, limited to occasional posts and checking the feed now and then.\n\nThen in 2015, a few things happened that deepened my relationship with Facebook. After years of paying very little attention to the platform, I started posting more frequently. The first catalyst was the publication of our book Shanghai Nightscapes. We wanted to get the word out about our new book. We created a book page to push news about it and about talks we were giving. Then, soon after the publication of our book, I moved to Kunshan, where I’ve been living and working ever since (I still spend weekends in Shanghai). Living alone in Kunshan five days a week drew me even deeper into the world of Facebook. I also used the platform to share my blog posts and to share info and news about my other publications and films.\n\nAs more people joined and used Facebook more frequently, I found myself connecting to all sorts of people, including colleagues of mine in Asian Studies, old friends, long-lost companions, relatives, and so forth. Most of these people are in the USA, Europe, and other places around the world. Facebook was a handy connect-all.\n\nOver the next few years, I continued to post frequently, sometimes several times a day. This was aided and abetted by my iPhone and iPad, which had the Facebook app on them. Every time I scanned my apps, I’d see the blue Facebook button with a red circle with a number in it, indicating some sort of activity. What genius behind this little red circle! It becomes an addiction, the need to press the button when you see that red dot. Facebook intentionally designed the app with a lot more functionality than getting on the website, so you develop a need to use it over time. That plus an addiction creates a vicious cycle of need to feed and read.\n\nNot only did this happen with me. I saw it happening with all sorts of folks on my Facebook feed. There was this addictive tendency to post whatever thought or activity or reaction you were having at the moment. And it gets very repetitive. What one notices over time (and I am as guilty of this as anybody else) is the endless, obsessive repetition of certain themes in people’s Facebook posts. Eventually you become jaded or inured to the repetitive nature of the posts.\n\nAnd what was driving all this was our addiction to a little blue square and a smaller red circle with numbers on it. Long and short: I was addicted, and so were most of my Facebook friends. It became an endless and unquenchable thirst to feed the Facebook machine. All of this was rattling around in my head last July when I chose to pull the plug on Facebook for a while. Over the next month or two, a few friends noticed my absence and wrote me, some with concern, the Great Firewall being on some minds. Meanwhile, Facebook went merrily on its way, and people kept chugging away at it, feeding its bottomless stomach with our personal obsessions.\n\nSo what happened to me when I got off the Facebook carousel?\n\nOnce I made the decision to disconnect, I didn’t look back. I suspended my own account, and I took all the Facebook apps off my devices. I also took off the Linked-In apps (those are really the only two social media I was using). Very quickly, the urge to post anything and everything dissipated. I found myself blissfully free of the need to take photos with my iPhone and immediately upload them to Facebook. I no longer felt the desire to share my thoughts or my reactions to what I was reading or watching with the Facebook world.\n\nAnother thing that happened was that I found myself far less bothered and disturbed by the daily news cycles. I continued to follow the news via my subscription to the New York Times, and through podcasts such as NPR or BBC newscasts. (I live in China but don’t read Chinese media--not that I’m unable to do so, but I’ve never developed the habit. Most of my China news comes from international sources, which have their own biases, but I digress.) Anyhow, I found myself reacting more dispassionately to the news of the day, the week, the month, or the year.\n\nPerhaps it helped that a certain attention-mongering President was no longer in office, and his successor operates in a more quiet and resolute manner. Regardless of the reasons, I felt happier not being bombarded by the fears and the waves of negativity expressed by my Facebook friends over every bit of bad news in the cycle. I was more connected to my immediate surroundings, and it felt like the burdens of the world had been lifted off my shoulders.\n\nNor did I feel the compelling desire to learn all that was happening with my Facebook friends. Instead, I kept up with close friends and family members by using email or Messenger. I continued to have discussions and to share things with a very small circle of people who mean the most to me. And that connection kept me satisfied—for a time.\n\nAt the beginning of January, after a nearly six-month hiatus, I decided to rejoin Facebook. I felt that if I took certain precautions and stuck to certain principles when using Facebook, I could avoid being sucked back into the well of addictive behaviors and negative thinking that the platform may encourage.\n\nBasically, my principles are:\n\n1) Only use a laptop computer or iPad web browser to access Facebook; don’t use or install the Facebook apps.\n\n2) Only connect to Facebook once per day, like I do when reading the NYT, usually in the morning while eating breakfast.\n\n3) Limit myself to scrolling my Facebook feed for fifteen minutes at most.\n\n4) Read and respond to personal messages, and “like” posts about personal matters such as family, friends, birthdays, anniversaries, fun activities, achievements (publishing a new book or article, etc.), or beautiful photos that a person took of nature, scenery, art etc.\n\n5) Limit myself to one or two posts per day at the most.\n\n6) Divert much of my writing energy to my blog posting, then use Facebook to share my blogs.\n\nI’m sure that some people would vehemently disagree with me about some of these things. I don’t begrudge anybody’s use of Facebook—it’s a democratic space even if it’s a messy one (and democracy is messy). On the other hand, if anybody else out there feels the way I do about the addictive, negative, and repetitive nature of Facebook posting, you might want to consider unplugging for a while and then rejoining and adopting some of these principles.\n\nFinally, I have to say that despite its many pitfalls, Facebook has provided me with many great pleasures over the two decades I’ve been using it. While I’m not happy about the advertising that invades my feed, I do appreciate the ability to connect and share things with so many friends, colleagues, relations etc. whom I don’t get to see these days, especially with the travel restrictions in our pandemic age. Like so many other technologies out there, there are benefits and hazards associated with Facebook and other social media platforms. Yet when used wisely, the benefits outweigh the hazards.\n\n(Note to readers: this is not a general article about China! It is about my own life in China as an American long-term resident of Shanghai and currently a professor at Duke Kunshan University)\n\nAs part of my blogging practice, at the beginning of the new year, I often take the time to review my previous year and plan for the coming one. This is a good time to assess what went right or wrong over the past year and how to steer a better course for the future. I can also look back on personal or professional highlights of the past year and share them with others who might be interested in learning what my life is like here in China. And I can say a few words of gratitude to folks who made a difference in my life.\n\nBut first, a few words about 2020. As readers of my blog know, 2020 was a special year for me and my family, as it was for everyone. After leaving China in February, my two daughters and I became “stranded” in the USA for seven months, waiting for our opportunity to return to our lives in Shanghai and (in my case) Kunshan. We spent six of those months living with my parents in my hometown of Acton Mass. As it turned out, while challenging, especially for my daughters who had to be schooled remotely from 12 time zones away, this was a unique and wonderful experience in so many ways. Under the pandemic conditions, along with my daughters and parents, I enjoyed countless long walks on dozens of nature trails across Massachusetts, and I was able to take advantage of the summer months to return to my love of cycling across the rolling hills and gentle valleys of the place where I grew up all those years ago. That September, after much anxiety, we were able to return to China and resume our lives here in Shanghai.\n\nThe year 2021 was all about getting back into the swing of life in China. The pandemic continued to present limitations on travel—particularly travel abroad—and we experienced an occasional tightening of restrictions and the need for COVID tests and vaccinations, but otherwise life has been normal here in the PRC. Social life especially. Although we did have to teach online for one 7-week session this fall, otherwise we were able to deliver our goods in the classroom, at least to our Chinese students. Unfortunately, our international students are still “stranded” abroad and we do not know when they will be able to return to Duke Kunshan University. Here’s hoping that this will happen in 2022, and that DKU will go back to being the truly international campus it was always meant to be!\n\nSpeaking of DKU, my first debt of gratitude goes to the senior administrators who helped me make the transition to a full-time faculty position. After my previous contract ended in June, I became an Associate Professor of Chinese History with a full teaching load of four courses per year (one per session, as our semesters are divided into two 7-week sessions). Thus, after eight years of full-time admin roles in various institutions, I came full circle back to my original love for teaching and research. I appreciate the flexibility in scheduling that a faculty position allows. While we are “on the job” 24/7 in so many ways, we are not tied to a 9-5 office schedule. Other than our scheduled classes, office hours, and so forth, we are relatively free to plan out our days, activities, and whereabouts as we see fit (for any faculty member who disagrees, try being a full-time administrator for a change and you’ll see what I mean). One thing I learned from my experiences in 2020 was that I enjoy working from home rather than sitting in an office all day. As a professor, I am able to do so more often. Also, I feel that the “deep work” that we do as researchers, writers, and in my case, filmmakers, requires large chunks of flexible time and the ability to seclude ourselves from social obligations and meetings in the workplace.\n\nThis brings me to my biggest achievement of the year 2021. After working on my jazz documentation project for nearly 17 years (off and on mind you) I finally managed to complete a version of my 90-minute documentary film on the history of jazz in Shanghai, “A Century of Jazz in Shanghai,” which I am now pleased and proud to screen to live audiences. Much of 2020 and most of 2021 were spent in my home editing studio working on this film. Over the summer, as I’ve written in previous blogs, I also conducted many follow-up interviews and gathered new material for the film to catch the story up to the pandemic era. All of this involved countless hours of “deep work” as I progressed through version after version of the film. I conducted three separate public screenings in Shanghai over the fall and received positive feedback from different audiences including many people who are in the film. In 2022, I need to figure out more ways to get this film out to the public and eventually distribute it so that the rest of the world can see the finished product.\n\nMeanwhile, over the past several months, I also managed to write a few articles on the history of jazz in Shanghai and other topics relating to live music scenes in China, which are going to be published in various publications over the coming year. In addition, I wrote some book reviews for different journals (still need to work on a few more this winter). Thus, while the film occupied much of my time, I was able to keep up with more “conventional” publishing work expected of us academics.\n\nAnother personal achievement in 2021 is also music related. After many decades of being a “closet” or “bedroom” or more accurately “living room” musician, playing piano and guitar in my home or with close friends, I managed to play more live gigs in Shanghai and Kunshan than ever before in my musical life. At the beginning of the year, I joined up with two musician friends, Jud and Johan, to form a “band” of our own (I use quotes because the three of us play guitars mostly, and we would really need a drummer and bass player to round out our band.) Mostly we played and sang songs in local bars and cafes in Shanghai, outside mainly, where we were occasionally joined by another guitar"
