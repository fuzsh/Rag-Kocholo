        "text": "Why I’m a Swiftie, you ask?\n\nLet me take you through the Eras.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: My favourite song from the album is A Place in This World. Upon the release of Taylor’s debut album, in 2006, I was 12. I was being bullied relentlessly at school, which was causing me to pull out my own eyelashes and eyebrows due to the stress. Suddenly, Taylor Swift entered my life like a whirlwind, putting into words exactly how I was feeling, and expressing other feelings I didn’t even know I had yet. I absolutely love her debut album, which I still have as the CD.\n\nCold as You, The Outside, and A Perfectly Good Heart helped me process my feelings about being tormented and excluded. Teardrops On My Guitar introduced me to heartbreak, Our Song introduced me to romance and butterflies, and I’m Only Me When I’m With You instantly made me think of my bestie, Miranda. She’s been my bestie for over 20 years and is coming with me to see Taylor Swift in concert. When I learned that Taylor’s long-time best friend is Abigail from high school, I warmed even more to this curly-haired blonde country singer and saw myself – and my friendship with Miranda – in her.\n\nFEARLESS: My favourite song from the album is You Belong With Me. I fell in love with the music video instantly – it was so creative and funny, with a happy ending. “She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts, she’s Cheer Captain and I’m on the bleachers” and “I’m listening to the kind of music she doesn’t like” resonated perfectly with me. I also adored Love Story; I listened to Fearless on repeat while on holiday in San Gimignano; and Change was a gamechanger for me, inducing a sense of hope that things would eventually get better.\n\nBy now, I was 14. Soon I would be leaving Danish primary school behind and “starting afresh” at a new school. Or so I hoped. I didn’t know that it was about to be the worst year of my life. This was when I started getting bullied by my classmates for listening to Taylor Swift; classmates who apparently only listened to “indie records much cooler than mine”. I ended up leaving the school early and having an emotional breakdown that saw me isolated in my room with the blinds shut for a month. Needless to say, Taylor Swift’s music got me through this.\n\nSPEAK NOW: My favourite song from the album is Mean, although The Story of Us, Better Than Revenge, and When Emma Falls in Love (From The Vault) are close contenders! I didn’t actually get to listen much to Speak Now at the time of its release (2010), as I was slowly slipping into psychosis. I would later be diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. However, I have caught up with all albums now, of course 😉 I have made a friendship bracelet for every Era, and Speak Now is no exception – it’s purple and fabulous …\n\nRED: My favourite song from the album is Red. “Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street, faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly” is probably my all-time favourite lyric. The emotions, speed and rush it evokes, and, of course, as someone who loves colour, Red perfectly suits my taste. At the time of this album’s release in 2012, I had just been discharged from hospital (after a seven-month-long stay) and was reeling from the chaos and confusion of my breakdown and diagnosis. I could barely string a sentence together, let alone write about my experiences or think about listening to all my favourite music. Everything was just so overwhelming, and I was feeling sadness, frustration, and a great sense of loss. People were making parodies of Taylor’s songs, and I hated it. I felt they were attacking me personally (not in a paranoid way, just feeling great sympathy for my new idol). I love All Too Well, the upbeat 22 rekindled my love for Taylor’s music, and Ronan (Taylor’s Version) recently made me have to sit down and cry like a baby. All in all, Red made me feel all the feels – happy, sad, and everything in between.\n\n1989: My favourite song from the album is Shake It Off. (Thanks, Mum! :-)) I also absolutely adore Wonderland, but as the first one I heard of the two, Shake It Off is epic. I still struggle with shaking off what my bullies did to me, but every time I listen to “I stay out too late, got nothing in my brain” (when I know I have an official IQ that puts me in the top 0.01 percentile of the population :-P) and the rest of this irresistible song, it all just gets a little easier. 1989, from 2014, produced a lot of the pop hits we still all sing along to today.\n\nREPUTATION: My favourite song from the album is Look What You Made Me Do. Oooooooh, how I love this album! What a comeback. Every song is a triumph. …Ready For It?, I Did Something Bad, and So It Goes… are also among my favourites. The music video for LWYMMD is fantastic. I love the snakes, diamonds, red lipstick, and power. In 2017, I was taking back my own power by blogging and also in the process of writing my first book, “Georgias Stemme(r)”. Things were finally starting to look up again, and once again, Taylor got me through it with a smile. “I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time; honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time; I got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined …”\n\nLOVER: My favourite song from the album is Afterglow. I Forgot That You Existed made me feel good, The Man is clever, Soon You’ll Get Better is poignant, and Cruel Summer is currently on repeat. Oh, and of course, ME! has a fantastic music video. So colourful and imaginative … right up my street. In 2019, I was working on my second book, this time in English, which would later become “VOICES OFF: Talking About Schizophrenia“.\n\nFOLKLORE: My favourite song from the album is Cardigan. This album came as such a surprise to all of us, back in 2020. And, perhaps, partly for this reason, I keep going back to it as my favourite album of Taylor’s. It’s such a wonderful album and I love every song on it. Betty, The Last Great American Dynasty, This Is Me Trying, Mad Woman and Hoax are favourites of mine. Taylor showed that she could do indie as well as country and pop, making her even more of a superstar.\n\nBut, as those of you who know me will know, I will not be wearing grey (this Era’s colour) to the concert 😉 I’m simply too much of a colour fiend for that. I do, however, have a grey cardigan from Taylor’s The Tortured Poets Department merch line … so, I guess that’s my tribute 🙂\n\nEVERMORE: My favourite song from the album (again, 2020 – does Taylor ever sleep? :-D) is Coney Island. Another amazing album, another beautiful song. No Body, No Crime is also highly addictive, and Marjorie delivers lyrics such as “Never be so polite you forget your power / Never wield such power you forget to be polite”. Classic.\n\nMIDNIGHTS: My favourite song from the album is Anti-Hero (but I could go on: Maroon, Snow On The Beach, Karma, Mastermind, The Great War …).\n\n2022; just before the publication of my first English book. Life was going much better for me at this point, and I was soaring in my recovery. Now, I loved seeing Taylor excel and succeed, instead of “just” hanging on to her songs as a lifeline. I smiled knowing she was winning … and so was I.\n\nTHE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: My favourite song from the recently-released album is Clara Bow. Along with the beautiful music video for Fortnight, with Post Malone, and other amazing tracks such as I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can), The Manuscript, and So Long, London, this is yet another bull’s-eye from Swift, who deserves every bit of hard-earned, billionaire, pop icon success she gets.\n\nThe most famous person in the world.\n\nWhat a star.\n\nAnd that’s why I’m a Swiftie.\n\nSee you at the concert.\n\nThis post is somewhat delayed – I wrote it in March and didn’t publish immediately. But I’ve decided to post it now!\n\n13th March 2023\n\nI’m watching Taylor Swift’s “Reputation Stadium Tour” movie on Netflix as I type.\n\n(Yeah, I’m slow at getting around to things – it adds a certain je ne sais quoi to life, I think.)\n\n…\n\nAnyway, I was just reminded of every single reason I call myself a Swiftie.\n\nRight from the very first minute of the movie.\n\nI love all Taylor’s albums, but Reputation now has an even more special place in my heart.\n\nAs soon as I started watching, I was brought all the way back to one of my darkest times.\n\nA time when I was deeply unhappy, struggling, and Taylor’s music was my lifeline.\n\nA time when I felt like nobody would ever want to be friends with me again.\n\nA time when I felt like I’d lost everything.\n\nA time when I was 15.\n\nNo teenager should EVER have to go through what I did.\n\nBut they do. Every single day, all over the world, in endless ways.\n\nEspecially when it’s just allowed to happen.\n\nI felt an overwhelming and terrifying loss of control. I had an emotional breakdown and didn’t leave my room for a month … I was unable to face the outside world. Thanks to a handful of young people who thought it was fun to break me down, I felt like my reputation was ruined.\n\nMy reputation.\n\nI was 15.\n\nThe way I saw it, an ever-growing number of my peers had rallied together with the sole intent to completely ruin me. (Again, I was 15 – maybe not the most rational and mature of thinkers.) I could see the things they wrote on social media and the way they interacted with me – how different it was from the way they interacted with each other, and how my name popped up in various unflattering ways. “I think Georgia looks really hot in that picture! Ha-ha, just kidding, Georgia….”\n\nAs time passed, more and more of my peers seemed to join in. I heard that some of them were talking about how weird I was – sharing this with new people, people I hadn’t even met yet.\n\nPeople I hadn’t even met yet.\n\nUltimately, I felt like I would never be able to win. How could I? How could I possibly reclaim my reputation? There were dozens, if not hundreds, of them and only one of me – and I seemed to be doing a pretty bad job at simply existing. (I was 15!)\n\nMy confidence was at an all-time low. I was mortified to my core. Eventually, I deleted all of them from my Facebook “friends” list and blocked a lot of them, too. Slowly, I managed to get myself outside again. It was hell. I was furious. So overwhelmingly, utterly infuriated by the fact that I had done NOTHING to provoke this, yet here I was, crushed and humiliated, crying my eyes out and feeling like the villain in my own story.\n\nThis is where Taylor Swift comes in.\n\nWhile watching this movie, many years after my dark times, I found myself witness to a young woman with her own host of “reputation struggles”, yet here she was, standing tall, smiling, and absolutely SLAYING on stage. Few have achieved what Taylor has achieved, and that stadium was full – over ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND people in attendance (out of 3 MILLION for the whole tour). I could say something trite like “there will always be haters”, but I’d rather say this: Taylor Swift had her struggles. She was hurt by the haters. And yet she was still up there, out there, singing her heart out and showing up. That takes courage. Poise. And she did it with such humour, charm and grace.\n\nI have been a loyal Swiftie ever since I first heard her song “Love Story”. I have never been afraid to hide this – on the contrary. I immediately got tickets to her 2020 concert at Roskilde Festival (before COVID blew that out the water). I have drawn her. I have written about her. I have watched her journey from her earliest, more innocent, country days – to her hard-hitting pop era – to the magical indie “lockdown” years and beyond. I have enjoyed “All Too Well: The Short Film” – and the fact that I’m not the only one who loves wearing snake rings.\n\n(Above: From Taylor’s music video for “Look What You Made Me Do”)\n\n(Below: Georgia’s own jewellery)\n\nAll in all, if I was to mention one thing I’ve learned from watching the “Reputation Stadium Tour”, it’s that it takes enormous strength of character and courage to get up, dress up, and show up, even when it feels like your reputation is ruined beyond repair. Taylor’s concert is a demonstration of power in this respect … she hasn’t let those who tried to bring her down succeed, instead channelling her experiences into a full-blown amazing album and tour with millions of ecstatic fans screaming her lyrics and crying at her every word.\n\nTaylor hits the right notes. She’s massively successful for a reason, and it’s not plastic surgery or sleeping with exes on TV. To me, she is a true inspiration, ever since I could relate to her first music and now, with her superstar status.\n\nAnd guess what?\n\nShe’s won.\n\nProven them all wrong.\n\nMade her “haters” look silly.\n\nI’m eagerly awaiting the announcement of her international tour dates, as I’m sure many others are, too.\n\nThis brings me to this chapter of my story …\n\nI felt like I’d lost, back then. That I’d been defeated.\n\nIt’s hard to type that.\n\nBut I see things differently now. I’m happy to see that school was a temporary nightmare, and grateful that I never became friends with any of them, even though it felt awful to be excluded at the time.\n\nBecause you know what?\n\nI’m winning, too.\n\nI’ve reclaimed my reputation.\n\nI’ve put things into words from MY perspective, not allowing any jerk to dictate how my story reads.\n\nAnyway, if you’ll excuse me. I’m off to underline your name in red.\n\nIn my new English book “Voices Off”, I dedicate a chapter to talking about my struggles with tidying up and throwing things out. I wrote the book while I was still living with my parents.\n\nToday, I live independently in my own flat. I have done so since September ’21. This was by no means something that just happened naturally. I was very fortunate to be in a good place in my recovery, so I could handle the process of moving. We took it very slowly so I wasn’t under undue stress. And, despite my practical skills being a long way from stellar, I have so far managed to stay on top of my daily chores and housework.\n\nThere have been days in January – weeks – where I’ve just prayed to myself nobody turned up uninvited (i.e., it was messy!). February, too. But I always manage to get my act together eventually. And I take pride in looking after my own space.\n\nIt wasn’t always like that.\n\nI used to struggle hugely with keeping my room tidy. It seemed like a massive, insurmountable task. And maybe it was. I had so much stuff – not helped by the fact I was terrible at throwing out. I really, truly couldn’t do it.\n\nWhy not? Because it was painful. And it seemed stupid. I didn’t want to throw anything out because I knew I might need it later. It’s often the case. Say you’ve never used that measuring tape, so you decide to finally throw it out. Two weeks later you’re online shopping and need to take your measurements – bam, what do you need? Your measuring tape! This may not be the best example as it’s generally handy to have a measuring tape (and it’s not the largest item to keep), but I hope you get my point.\n\nSo, out of fear of regretting it later, I held on to stuff. I also wasn’t as far in my recovery, so my brain wasn’t in the right zone for “huge” tasks. I would motivate myself to work on a bit of my room – e.g., my chest of drawers (which was full of stuff) – only to space out after five minutes and stop. I couldn’t move forward with it. I am not by nature a slow person, so it exasperated me, but I also felt powerless. I would stop because I didn’t know where to start. Because I couldn’t bring myself to throw any of it out. Because I found my ambivalence too difficult to deal with. And, sometimes, I just stopped because I was exhausted, and went to sleep (surrounded by stuff).\n\nI kept trying. I kept that hope that this COULD and WOULD change. It took many monumental efforts to start feeling and seeing a little difference. I eventually cleared my chest of drawers. Got rid of half a bin bag’s worth of stuff. Discarded drawings (not “good” ones), old birthday cards, a bunch of magazines, random paper clips, receipts … all stuff I knew I was never going to need again. It was difficult, and with some more sentimental stuff, I sometimes changed my mind at the last minute … but, the next time I targeted an area of my room, I managed to fill more than half a bin bag. So that, to me, signified progress. And with that, my “hope-metre” rose a little.\n\nAnd then we moved house.\n\nFor me, the impending move suddenly meant I had a rock-solid reason to throw things out. A fresh start.\n\nTo not end up swamped with cardboard removal boxes in our new house, my mum and I went to our local Shurgard (a self-storage warehouse) and signed me up for a storage unit. This way I could transfer everything I didn’t need immediately to a secure space – billed monthly – and sort through it in my own time.\n\nIt worked. Inspired by the prospect of a new adventure, comforted by not having to deal with it all straightaway, and motivated by the fact I was paying for my storage unit (it was a fair price, but still money I could be using on other things), I started tackling the massive, insurmountable task. Once we’d moved, I regularly went out to Shurgard – with my mum – to sift through my old ceramics works, endless childhood books, magazines, things of sentimental value, tennis racquets, schoolbooks, old notebooks, folders full of old artworks, ornaments I’d gathered throughout the years and much more. My storage unit was full in 2020 (before we moved) and, by the end of the summer in 2022, I had cleared it.\n\nApart from a couple of boxes of books that I know I want to keep (but currently don’t have room for in my apartment), everything was sorted. I reckon 2/3 of it went out. Mostly taken to the dump – my mum drove there and back several times, the car packed full each time. We moved the boxes of books to her storage unit, and I could subsequently go to the reception desk with a smile on my face and terminate my contract.\n\nNo more money “out the window” every month. No more clutter. No more weight of too – much – stuff! It was a good feeling.\n\nI finally felt like I was on my way to not feeling ashamed of my own space. I’d previously felt embarrassed inviting friends over; it didn’t stop me, but I was constantly self-conscious about my inability to have a “nice” room. When I didn’t have friends over, the mess could be appalling. It looked like an explosion in a knick-knack factory next to a bookshop and an office … there were decorations, books and paper everywhere, and plastic boxes full of stuff I’d never looked at for years. I hated it. Absolutely hated it. But I couldn’t bring myself to do anything about it.\n\nI was likely suffering from avolition – a symptom of schizophrenia which can be described as low motivation, but is a little more complex than that. Specifically, it means you want to achieve a goal, you know what’s required to achieve the goal, but you cannot motivate yourself to do it – no matter the consequences. I.e., you could have a “carrot” (a positive outcome of achieving a goal) or a “stick” (a negative outcome of not achieving a goal), yet still not act. Nobody wants to be fired from their job, and everybody loves a reward for good effort, but imagine if you can’t get yourself to take the necessary steps to pay your bills, lose weight, or even just make your bed in the morning. Imagine how out of control this could become. A snowball effect with the potential to negatively affect every area of your life.\n\n… Well, darkness aside, and to get back to the subject of this post: I had avolition, and it was unbearable to deal with. I wanted to achieve so many things, but had no “drive” to get those things – including a tidy room.\n\nI think I’ve trained myself to become more structured.\n\nI say this because I also struggled terribly with isolating myself. I would never leave the house – literally, never. Social anxiety and low confidence meant that I found it too stressful. I relied heavily on my parents. I wouldn’t even consider going for a walk in my neighbourhood – and as for supermarkets or shops? Forget it! Way too stressful.\n\nThe world was a daunting, unpredictable place (in my mind) back then.\n\nHowever, those of you who follow me on Instagram may have noticed my many “walk photos”. Photos I’ve taken on walks. In my neighbourhood. Outside.\n\nI actually leave my flat these days. I often go to the supermarket. I sometimes go shopping in town (when I can afford it, that is). I’m living a relatively normal life. And I like to think that, knowing my history, this is a tremendous victory.\n\nAnd now, I’d like to share my tips with you.\n\nIf you’re struggling with clutter, here are things you can do to help yourself “slay the beast”:\n\n1. Take photos.\n\nWhen you’re struggling to throw something out that you know you’re never going to use/wear/look at again, ease the process by taking a photo of it on your phone and keep it there for a while. When you start to find it easier to throw out, just keep taking photos – of every item you are considering.\n\nThat’s how I felt “in control”, while still getting rid of stuff.\n\n2. Delay.\n\nFor a week/month/set amount of time. Again, when there’s something you know you should throw out because you’re never going to use it, but you’re still finding it too hard, set yourself a time where you have to decide – that way you give yourself a little “breathing space” before getting rid of it. If you don’t look at it within that time and still know you’ll never use it, it should probably go out.\n\n3. Easiest stuff first.\n\nDeal with the “easier” stuff first. Disposable water bottles, plastic bags, clothes with stains or holes in them, thing that don’t have sentimental value. Whatever “easy” means to you, tackle those groups first. Do the things you find most difficult last – that way, you’ll train yourself until you feel more able to deal with the “difficult” stuff.\n\n4. Sort into piles.\n\nKeep – charity – bin. By sorting your belongings methodically into piles according to what you want to do with them, this can help you see how much you’re holding on to that you don’t actually need.\n\n5. Reflect.\n\nI eventually realised that – philosophically – holding onto the old stuff didn’t allow me space for all the good new stuff. Not just physical things, but in life generally.\n\nHowever, do still be patient with yourself – it takes time and effort.\n\nOh, and one more thing – what others can do for a loved one who’s struggling with clutter:\n\n1. Don’t throw out for them (i.e., without them agreeing to it).\n\nThis often just causes immense stress and sets them back in their progress.\n\nSo, that’s my advice. I am not a psychiatrist nor an expert. But I hope that, perhaps, this post could reach people who may find my personal experiences useful.\n\nNow I’m off to sort my wardrobe.\n\nWhat ten songs would you pick for the soundtrack of your life?\n\nI’m in a music mood, so here are mine!\n\n1.\n\nAly & AJ – Walking On Sunshine\n\nThe ultimate happy song. I love it. It perfectly captures that feeling of elation and excitement for the future. (I know Katrina and the Waves did the original, but Aly & AJ’s is the version I remember from my childhood.)\n\n2.\n\nAvril Lavigne – Nobody’s Fool\n\nThe whole first verse is my favourite. The musical form of “Do no harm, take no s**t”. My first “artist album” was Let Go by Avril, who I just thought was the coolest person ever. She expressed feelings and experiences I didn’t even know I had yet, while remaining cool and edgy in her style. To little Georgia, for whom the world was pink and fluffy, Avril was an awesome mix of sensitive, trendy, and insanely talented. Still is.\n\n3.\n\nColdplay – Talk\n\nWhere life is changeable, music is constant. When life is cruel and chaotic, music stays the same – it’s always right there where you left it and there’s no risk of it ever leaving. When things seem too much to bear, Coldplay understands. I felt like everyone was talking to me in a language I didn’t speak, and this song got me through the toughest times I never wish to revisit. Plus, it reminds me of my best friend, who listened to “Talk” with me on a school trip to Prague.\n\n4.\n\nLinkin Park – Numb\n\nFor a pop addict like me, Linkin Park was positively hardcore. I really enjoy watching music videos, and this one spoke to me on some level when I was struggling. Quiet, arty girl who’s being bullied at school? Ticks all the boxes. Thank you, and rest in peace, Chester Bennington.\n\n5.\n\nMadison Beer – Stained Glass\n\nI think the lyrics are really clever in this one. It’s all about sensitivity and how harsh words can damage us, but with layered metaphors centred around the fragility, colours and fractures of “stained glass”. I went to see Madison Beer in concert and enjoyed every minute – unless you’re a staunch metalhead (and if you haven’t already), give her music a listen.\n\n6.\n\nNatasha Bedingfield – These Words\n\nWhew … that got deep! So, here’s an upbeat, fun song that brilliantly describes the struggle of the writer. I listened to it a lot in my childhood.\n\n7.\n\nNickelback – Savin’ Me\n\nI have yet to watch a music video that I’ve found as interesting as this one. Clever, well-executed, and sad (I wouldn’t recommend watching it if you’ve just lost a loved one), its concept is just … well, clever. Thought-provoking and original. I do love the lyrics too.\n\n8.\n\nRobbie Williams – Feel\n\nThis song reminds me to live up to my full potential. Don’t let all the life running through your veins go to waste …\n\n9.\n\nSia – Elastic Heart\n\nAgain, the music video is a masterpiece, but I also listened to this song on repeat for a long time to get me through a dip in my health. Sia powerfully captures the essence of “you won’t f***ing break me” in 4 minutes and 16 seconds. It’s strong, relatable, vulnerable and moving, all in one little song. Have you listened to it?\n\n10.\n\nSpice Girls – Viva Forever\n\nOkay, another music video that I LOVE! Growing up in London, with the Spice Girls as a big part of a little blue-eyed girl’s everyday life, I HAD to have them on the list. This is my favourite song by them, and brings back all the feels and memories of childhood.\n\nSo … which Spice Girl were you? I was Baby 👱🏻‍♀️\n\n11.\n\nTaylor Swift – Love Story\n\nNo Georgia playlist would be complete without T-Swizzle, so of course, I had to pick the first one I ever listened to, Love Story. It’s been a love story about her music ever since 😉\n\nDid my (eleven) choices surprise you? What would yours be?\n\nThere’s a saying that goes “Style is a way to say who you are without having to speak”. I have always loved this quote. When words failed me, I could always express myself through my clothes. When I was a teenager, I felt like a walking contradiction; super-quiet, but always dressed in bright colours. I didn’t own one piece of black clothing, and even my braces had multicoloured bands.\n\nI read another quote recently: “If a composer could say what he had to say in words, he would not bother trying to say it in music”. A slightly different take on the subject. It got me thinking; thinking about my own struggles and difficulties with communication. In a way, my schizophrenia diagnosis in 2012 came as a relief; now I finally had answers to why I’d struggled socially all my life. I started my first blog in 2016 as a way to express myself – through writing, I could say everything I needed to say, in a controlled and personal manner without interruptions or misunderstandings. I hoped it would clarify things, both for others and for myself – which it certainly has.\n\nHowever, writing has not been my only therapy (aside from the regular sessions with my psychiatrist). I have also used art as a means to communicate who I am.\n\nWhen I was younger, I drew manga girls in different outfits. When I was even younger, I drew animals. Now, I draw and paint portraits – to order, when I’m able to cope with it. Schizophrenia doesn’t like to make things easy, and even my artistic side suffered during the worst period of the illness; I couldn’t bring myself to pick up a pencil. This was particularly devastating when I couldn’t rely on my mouth to articulate everything on my mind; I felt like I’d lost myself.\n\nI recently entered a portrait competition. This was a HUGE hurdle to overcome for me, despite being something I’d wanted to do for a while. My ambivalence (a crippling by-product of schizophrenia) means that, even when I have a strong desire to achieve something, my brain goes into overdrive finding all the reasons why I shouldn’t try. In the past, this would be accompanied by aggressively critical voices (the kind only I can hear) and, as a result, nothing would come of my aspirations. I’m not saying it’s much different now – I still have to design my life around my illness – but I’m hoping that, with effort, I can keep pushing the limits at my own pace and not let the darkness win.\n\nAs it so happens, I received a diagnosis of depression not long ago. I may have to grapple with my own mind for a while yet, but at least I have my creative outlets.\n\nIn any case, it definitely won’t stop me wearing bright colours."
