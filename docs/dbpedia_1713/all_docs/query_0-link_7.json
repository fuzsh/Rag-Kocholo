        "text": "Here's a look at the recently completed cover for August Burns Red's new album, Rescue & Restore. The album will be available June 25th on CD, double gatefold vinyl, and limited edition vinyl box set. Pre-orders available soon! We had an absolute blast putting this together. Thanks to JB and the guys for their trust and letting us run crazy with it.\n\nOur friends in Underøath asked us to contribute a design dedicated to one show of their upcoming farewell tour. This design (for both poster and t-shirt) specifically commemorates the Houston, TX date of the tour. If you have a chance, don't miss seeing this band for the last time, and be sure to check out all of the final tour designs created by friends of the band here.\n\nTo commemorate Demon Hunter's ten years, we've created a silkscreen poster featuring imagery from all six studio albums. This is a limited pressing of 100, signed by Ryan Clark (me), and is available in the store now. Order by December 20th for holiday arrival! (orders for this poster do NOT include IC Holiday Giveaway print)\n\nWe're honored to have our work featured in The Grammy Museum's new installation \"The History Of Heavy Metal\", opening April 11th. The exhibit opening coincides with The Golden Gods and will feature numerous album covers from our early years within the heavy music genre. The show will be up for one year and definitely worth checking out.\n\nSo it's kind of a long story, but when my buddy Vijay, who owns and operates Artist Series Guitar, mentioned that his good friend, Ryan Hurst, would be doing a photo shoot for his custom Demon Hunter and Throwdown guitars, I had to make sure I was there. For years now, people have said I look like Opie, a character that Hurst plays in the always-enthralling Sons Of Anarchy TV show. All of us in Demon Hunter have become huge fans of the show over the years, so this was a really cool opportunity. Oh, and my wife made the dope leather vest Hurst is wearing in the shoot. Checking off that bucket list, one day at a time.\n\nHere is the cover for an upcoming Demon Hunter release featuring the first 3 albums in one package. The 3 disc set will be available everywhere March 8th. If you've had trouble finding these older releases in a store near you, here's the chance to get them all (and cheaply). As always, the DH demon skull graces the cover, this time made from the trees of my back yard. I gathered up some fallen branches and leaves, constructed the logo on a large sheet of white paper, and Jerad Knudson shot the photo.\n\nWe just wrapped up the artwork for our friends, The Famine, and after an interesting photo shoot of blowing black body paint on a total stranger through a straw, I'm glad to say I'm pleased with the outcome. Be afraid.\n\nAs They Sleep is a new band on Solid State Records, bringing some much needed brutality to the masses. This is the album cover that we recently completed for their upcoming release titled Dynasty. We again enlisted photographic/set design whiz Jerad Knudson to help us see the vision through, and we couldn't be happier with the results. Apparently the model is a homeless man that sells newspapers near Jerad's house in Seattle's Capital Hill neighborhood.\n\nCheck out your local newsstands now for the new issue of Revolver Magazine, featuring Zakk Wylde. We did the photo-illustration work for the cover and the feature, which meant many hours of cutting out little demon people to create the elaborate scenes. The cover image itself pays homage to recently deceased Frank Frazetta's classic artwork.\n\nIt's the Rowdy Boys Heavy Metal Club! These ruffians may look a little troubled, but they're good kids... just don't tell them you think Inside The Torn Apart is the best Napalm Death album. The brand new 16\" x 22\" Giclee print is available in the store now.\n\nCheck out the cover we recently finished for our buddies The Showdown. The new record, Blood In The Gears, has a very gritty, Southern, biker sound to it, so that's exactly what we went for. That's me in the jacket, and there's no Photoshop magic here- we had the back patch made just for the cover. Ride to live...\n\nWe just launched a pre-order for the new Demon Hunter record, The World Is A Thorn. Go here to see the different bundles being offered. The deluxe edition box is filled with goodies and there are some extra odds and ends that you can add for dirt cheap. Oh, and the music's not too shabby either.\n\nHere's the cover for Demon Hunter's new \"Live In Nashville\" record. For this album cover we wanted to execute our \"demon skull\" logo (which graces every DH cover) in a new and unique way. If you focus on the black negative space, you'll see it. Album available January 27th!\n\nJust finishing up the artwork for new Solid State band, The Ascendicate. This is actually a band that I sought out and recently helped sign to the label. I'm very excited for the release of this record. The above image is the final cover (sans sticker, which displays the band name, album title).\n\nHere's a glimpse at some imagery that we're working on for the new record by Becoming The Archetype, titled \"Dichotomy.\" The theme of the album is loosely based on C.S. Lewis' \"The Hideous Strength,\" wherein Lewis writes of the dichotomy between man and machine. Brutal! Oh, and the album slays. Buy it November 25th!"
