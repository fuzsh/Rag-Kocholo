        "text": "On January 1, 2020, I'm launching a new blog dedicated to exploring recorded jazz from the 1970s. It's called Playing Favorites: Reflections on Jazz in the 1970s.\n\nDuring the year-long blogging project, I plan to list one album per day for the entire year. So, at the end of the year, the site will provide details for 366 albums, all recorded between January 1, 1970 and December 31, 1979. As the title of the blog implies, I'm not focusing on the \"most important\" or \"best\" recordings from the decade. Rather, I'm discussing my favorite recordings, music that has personal meaning to me. One other caveat: I'm limiting myself to one recording as a leader per artist and one recording as a co-leader per artist. Rather than digging deeply into a handful of musicians, I wanted to show the breadth and diversity of jazz during the decade. This strategy also had the effect of prompting me to listen to lots of new music -- and to carefully re-examining old favorites.\n\nThe URL for my blog is https://jazzinthe70s.blogspot.com/. So far, I've written one post, providing background info about the project (as above).\n\nI've already chosen all 366 recordings. I have them listed chronologically (by recording date) on a spreadsheet -- with sidemen, labels, reissue details, etc. I've already written several of the entries, but I won't post them until next year on their \"assigned\" date. Some blog entries may only provide a sentence or two of commentary. Other entries will be longer. I think the main value of the project will be to shine a light (however dim) on some under-valued artists and express some appreciation for all the enjoyment that they have given me.\n\nIt goes without saying that I will NOT be sharing files on this blog. That's not my purpose. I may occasionally provide links to music that others have posted on YouTube -- assuming that those YT posts are legal. But I'll emphasize again that my main purpose is to offer up a sizable, annotated LIST of recordings that others might recognize as jumping off points or gateways for further exploration.\n\nI've been tinkering with this idea for a long time, and I'd intended to write a book on the topic. But, based on the progress that I've made (nearly none), I decided that it would be better to create something, rather than holding on to a grander idea and as a result produce nothing.\n\nLet's see how this thing goes.\n\nOTOH, I share the assessment that \"70s jazz\" gets a horribly bad rap, usually based more on emotion (EVERYTHING'S CHANGING!!!!!) than on objective musical evaluations. Sure, some things were NOT good (particularly in terms of recording...too much indiscriminate \"direct\" everything...), but all the whining about electronics and keyboards and funks and fusions and avant-gardeness and \"commercialism\"...yeah, you had a living music and this is what it looks like when shit is alive and engaged in a world that is also alive and engaged. Not every change works, but that is evolution, In retrospect, it seems like everything works or doesn't. In real time, it's not that simple, and certainly not that clean. REAL shit be messy!\n\nPlenty of bad records made, but plenty of GREAT music made. And look what happened when the organic changes were brought to a more or less enforced halt (as much as was possible). It's taken a loooong time to get over/around that.\n\nA name that for some reason immediately springs to mind is Jimmy Heath. The Gap Sealer was an excellent record form the early 70s, \"modern\" (if not \"cutting edge\"). Then he went back to relatively straight-ahead bebop, made a good (enough) record or two, and then got The Heath Brothers thing going, and oh btw - the first Heath Brothers record on Columbia is a GREAT record in terms of compositions, playing, and production. It seems to be dismissed by \"the establishment\" because of it's \"commercial\" touches (of which there are more than a few, but jeesuz - that's both beside the point while being exactly the point.\n\nI would invite anybody who's not emotionally bound to \"style\" to listen to the compositions on that record, and the playing that goes on therein. Those tunes are very nicely involved, details abound, and the playing is fully engaged. No halfassing going on, just a mellow sense of intent. This is a record full of expert music played by experts, yet very radio-friendly. All of that merits consideration, I should think.\n\nSo, tow totally different Jimmy Heath records from within the 70s, each one strong within itself, and neither like the other, at least not superficially. But underneath the surface, they're both pure Jimmy Heath. That's hardly a 70's thing, but it seems to have been more present in the 70s for more people than usual, if only because what was considered a \"commercially viable jazz record\" in, say, 1977 was a helluva lot different than at anytime before, and possibly since. So many options...."
