        "text": "AIMS Marketing Program/ Featured Titles Promoted This Week:\n\nBlur – The Ballad Of Darren CD/LP (Parlophone)\n\nBritpop legends Blur are back with their first new album in over eight years. The Ballad Of Darren is the band’s ninth studio album overall, their first since 2015’s The Magic Whip, with artwork featuring an image by British photographer Martin Parr. Damon Albarn said, “This is an aftershock record, reflection and comment on where we find ourselves now.” Graham Coxon adds, “The older and madder we get, it becomes more essential that what we play is loaded with the right emotion and intention. Sometimes just a riff doesn’t do the job.” Alex James shares, “For any long-term relationship to last with any meaning you have to be able to surprise each other somehow and somehow we all continue to do that.” Dave Rowntree closes, “It always feels very natural to make music together. With every record we make, the process reveals something new, and we develop as a band. We don’t take that for granted.” The highly anticipated 10-track collection is introduced by lead track “The Narcissist” which The Guardian says, “chugs along to a motorik beat, rising to an anthemic chorus that seems to be reflecting on the band’s career path.” [An indie store exclusive blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nSam Burton – Dear Departed CD/LP (Partisan)\n\nDear Departed, the second album from Sam Burton, arose from a time of rebirth. In the last few years, Burton basically started over. He temporarily abandoned the life he’d built in Los Angeles and spent time with friends and family friends in rural Utah and California. After all that time wandering, couch-surfing, and writing, Burton emerged with more than enough material for his sophomore outing. He joined up with producer Jonathan Wilson to craft a more intricate, layered sound that recalled the lived-in yet immediate singer-songwriter albums of the ’60s and ’70s. Together they achieved a sound that didn’t descend into retro pastiche, but rather became an evocative echo, a dream of the past. In scope, Dear Departed finds Burton using a far bigger canvas than on his debut, giving the emotions therein a new sense of urgency and intensity. But the album still has an intimacy to it, like Burton and his backing musicians are crammed onto the corner stage of a smoke-filled bar in a long-lost time.\n\nLori McKenna – 1988 CD/LP (CN)\n\nLori McKenna titled her new album 1988 after the year she married her husband, Gene, yet the ten songs within also serve as a love letter to lifelong friendships, people she’s lost, and her family. Recorded with producer Dave Cobb in Savannah, Georgia, 1988 naturally has its nostalgic moments, even if not every ending is a happy one. With more of an electric edge than her past projects, 1988 feels in step with classic ‘90s albums by Sheryl Crow or Gin Blossoms, where the lyrics pulled you in as much as the melody or production. Playing together on acoustic guitars while facing one another in the studio, McKenna and Cobb tracked the album live, giving it a feeling of immediacy and authenticity.\n\nNecrofier – Burning Shadows In The Southern Night CD/LP (Season Of Mist)\n\n“Featuring current and former members of acclaimed progressive metallers Oceans Of Slumber among their ranks, Texas’ Necrofier has a far different sound and have managed to carve out a legacy in their own right in very short order. Ever since the release of their first EP, Visions Of Fire in 2018, followed by their debut album Prophecies Of Eternal Darkness in 2021, the Houston-based quartet have quickly established themselves with their angular and melody-driven take on black metal, emerging as one of the more promising acts within the US’ vibrant underground scene. Their latest album, Burning Shadows In The Southern Night, is another stunning slab of black metal with a few notable stylistic additions making this not only their best but also their most diverse release to date.” – Danny Sanderson, Distorted Sound\n\nNothing But Thieves – Dead Club City CD/LP (Awal Recordings)\n\nNothing But Thieves is back with their fourth album Dead Club City. Through their 11-track album, the band showcase their city-sized members only club Dead Club City. The album’s tracklist is formed by different characters and story arcs from in and around the city. Is it a shared consciousness? Another planet? The next corporate wasteland? Heaven? Or somewhere else? Using the club as a focal point, it is easy to imagine the real-world meaning behind Dead Club City. Themes such as advertisement, unity, internet culture, the music industry, ageing and politics, as well as escapism and change are highlighted by the alienation or privilege of a members-only club.\n\nNina Simone – You’ve Got To Learn CD/LP (Verve)\n\nThe Newport Jazz Festival had always brought the best out of Nina Simone. On July 2, 1966, the audience was treated to the full range of her artistry – from the opener, a breathtaking version of “You’ve Got To Learn” to a swinging take on “Mississippi Goddam”. After a sustained standing ovation, her fans were rewarded with the show-stopping encore, “Music For Lovers”. This previously unreleased recording makes it clear why hearing Nina Simone in concert was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. [An indie store exclusive color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nThe Teskey Brothers – The Winding Way CD/LP (Glassnote)\n\nFour years after the boys from Warrandyte’s globe-conquering second album, Run Home Slow (2019), which followed their debut album Half Mile Harvest (2017), the artistic vision of vocalist Josh Teskey and his brother, guitarist and engineer Sam Teskey is more defined than ever on their highly anticipated new studio album The Winding Way. The album is a bigger and more adventurous sounding record than The Teskey Brothers’ first two albums – but while it’s a more studio-oriented release, each track is bursting with life and full of surprises. [An indie store exclusive white color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nMolly Tuttle & Golden Highway – City Of Gold CD/LP (BMG)\n\nCity Of Gold follows Molly Tuttle’s acclaimed 2022 record, Crooked Tree, which won Best Bluegrass Album at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards and led NPR Music to call her, “a female flat picker extraordinaire with agility, speed and elegance who distinctively brings American roots music into the spotlight,” adding that the album “marries the improvisatory solos of traditional bluegrass with singer-songwriter sophistication.” Produced by Tuttle and Jerry Douglas and recorded at Nashville’s Sound Emporium Studios, City Of Gold was inspired by Tuttle’s constant touring with Golden Highway the past few years, during which they have grown together as musicians and performers, cohering as a band. These 13 tracks – mostly written by Tuttle and Ketch Secor (Old Crow Medicine Show) – capture the electric energy of band’s live shows by highlighting each members’ musical strengths. [An indie store exclusive blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nVarious Artists – Barbie The Album: Soundtrack CD/LP/Cassette (Atlantic)\n\nTo live in Barbie Land is to be a perfect being in a perfect place. Unless you have a full-on existential crisis. Or you’re a Ken. Oscar-nominated writer/director Greta Gerwig’s (Little Women, Lady Bird) new Barbie film stars Oscar-nominees Margot Robbie (Bombshell, I, Tonya) and Ryan Gosling (La La Land, Half Nelson) as Barbie and Ken. Barbie The Album features new tracks from an unprecedented lineup of artists including Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice, Lizzo, Karol G, Charli XCX, PinkPantheress, Ava Max, Dominic Fike, Khalid, The Kid Laroi, Tame Impala, Haim, Gayle and Fifty Fifty feat. Kali. Barbie star Ryan Gosling also joins the robust roster of soundtrack artists with his iconic original song performed as his character, Ken. [A limited-edition hot pink vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nAdditional Social Media Program Titles:\n\nNo additional social media titles this week.\n\nCDs + Vinyl:\n\nAerosmith – Live! Bootleg [Reissue/1978] CD (Capitol)\n\nLive! Bootleg is a double live album by American hard rock band Aerosmith, released in October 1978. In addition to previously unrecorded covers “I Ain’t Got You” and “Mother Popcorn”, the album also features a version of “Train Kept A Rollin'” which inserts an uncredited “Strangers In The Night”. This reissue has been remastered from the original tapes [Vinyl edition due August 25.]\n\nAgriculture – Agriculture CD/LP/Cassette (The Flenser)\n\nWhat was initially a meeting and subsequent series of jam sessions between Kern Haug and Daniel Meyer, two musicians in the Los Angeles underground noise scene, would eventually manifest as a shared vision to portray the sublimity of the human experience through the vehicle of heavy music. Following the additions of veteran guitarist Richard Chowenhill and bassist/vocalist Leah Levinson to the band’s lineup, this idea would crystalize into the “ecstatic black metal” backbone of Agriculture’s music.\n\nArthur Alexander – …Stepin’ Out! CD (Big Stir)\n\nNew solo album from veteran guitar-pop maestro Arthur Alexander (of Sorrows and Poppees fame); a confident, eclectic, and revelatory collection.\n\nCindy Alexander – Messy CD (Blue Élan)\n\n“Seven months into the pandemic, I left Los Angeles for Big Sur. This record was written from my new perch on top of a forested mountain that overlooks the ocean. The air is clear, and so is my mind. The weather here is much more dramatic, and the storms are intense. I live the same storms within that I experience in the weather. But I welcome them because they cleanse me. I allow and accept, with immense gratitude. To say I love living here is an understatement. I feel at one with my surroundings, and completely inspired. I let go of a lot of physical items when I moved. What I gained spiritually far exceeds what I left behind. I let go of emotional baggage by writing and recording this album and appreciate the lessons with perspective and a lighter sense of being. I can laugh.”\n\nCaterina Barbieri – Ecstatic Computation [Reissue/2019] CD/LP (Light-Years)\n\nThree years after the original release date of Caterina Barbieri’s career-defining album Ecstatic Computation, the Italian artist reissues the record on her newly found own label Light-Years. The reissue features a beautifully reworked version of the original cover art and a previously unreleased song on the CD. Caterina Barbieri is an Italian composer who explores themes related to machine intelligence and object-oriented perception in sound through a focus on minimalism. [A limited-edition silver color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nBlur – The Ballad Of Darren CD/LP (Parlophone)\n\nBritpop legends Blur are back with their first new album in over eight years. The Ballad Of Darren is the band’s ninth studio album overall, their first since 2015’s The Magic Whip, with artwork featuring an image by British photographer Martin Parr. Damon Albarn said, “This is an aftershock record, reflection and comment on where we find ourselves now.” Graham Coxon adds, “The older and madder we get, it becomes more essential that what we play is loaded with the right emotion and intention. Sometimes just a riff doesn’t do the job.” Alex James shares, “For any long-term relationship to last with any meaning you have to be able to surprise each other somehow and somehow we all continue to do that.” Dave Rowntree closes, “It always feels very natural to make music together. With every record we make, the process reveals something new and we develop as a band. We don’t take that for granted.” The highly anticipated 10-track collection is introduced by lead track “The Narcissist” which The Guardian says, “chugs along to a motorik beat, rising to an anthemic chorus that seems to be reflecting on the band’s career path.” [An indie store exclusive blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nCadaver – The Age Of The Offended CD/LP (Nuclear Blast)\n\nThirteen tracks of pure savage raw Norwegian death metal. [A limited-edition translucent orange w/ silver & blue splatter vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nCut Worms – Cut Worms CD/LP/Cassette (Jagjaguwar)\n\nAs Cut Worms, songwriter Max Clarke’s contemporary vision of American heritage rock-n-roll is both pristine and askew. He’s been called a modern Buddy Holly and Everly Brothers while also being tagged as “Lynchian.” Since 2016, this vision has made Cut Worms fans of Nick Lowe, Norah Jones, Wilco, and other notable powerhouse artists. And on his self-titled third album, we find Clarke refining his craft down to its most crucial elements. [A limited-edition ‘seaglass wave’ color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nDon Ellis – How Time Passes [Reissue/1961] CD/LP (Candid)\n\nA fascinating blend of jazz and contemporary classical influences, How Time Passes is the debut album from the envelope pushing trumpeter and composer Don Ellis. Known for his extensive musical experimentation, particularly with time signatures, Ellis began his long career in New York City’s post-bop and avant-garde jazz scenes of late 1950s. Most notably he appeared on Charles Mingus’ Mingus Dynasty, and albums by George Russell and Maynard Feguson. But he also worked with, among others, the Glenn Miller Orchestra, Lionel Hampton, and Woody Herman. On subsequent albums, Ellis would take an even wilder direction. Here, on his first recoding date as a band leader, the experimentation begins. Ellis stretches the boundaries of bop-based jazz playing with time, tempo, and meter.\n\nGoldie – Timeless (The Remixes) 2xCD/3xLP (London)\n\nGoldie’s 1995 album Timeless is regularly cited as one of the greatest dance music albums ever made, a Dark Side Of The Moon for the rave generation. As Tony Marcus, writing in Mixmag back in 1995, concluded: “Timeless is a record that couldn’t have been made if it wasn’t for the party, the MDMA, the noise and the rage. Timeless tells you that you can’t ignore or erase this history because to Goldie, and to so many others, it holds their lives, dreams, and feelings.” Timeless (The Remixes) features hand-picked contemporary remixes by Goldie from the likes of Break, Doc Scott, Teebee, 4 Hero, Trevino and many more.\n\nGraceless – Shadowlands [Reissue/2017] CD/LP (Listenable)\n\nGraceless – Where The Vultures Know Your Name [Reissue/2020] CD/LP (Listenable)\n\nGraceless – Chants From Purgatory [Reissue/2022] CD/LP (Listenable)\n\nIf you are a death metal fan, Graceless shouldn’t need an introduction. Three full-lengths and two split EPs have granted the Dutch ensemble a respectable reputation across the globe. [Multiple vinyl colorways are available.]\n\nGreta Van Fleet – Starcatcher CD/LP (Republic)\n\nGrammy Award-winning retro rockers Greta Van Fleet follow-up 2021’s The Battle At Garden’s Gate with their much anticipated third studio album Starcatcher. Produced by the ever in demand Dave Cobb (Chris Stapleton, Brandi Carlile) and recorded at the legendary RCA Studios in Nashville, TN, the band utilized the large recording room to capture the pure energy of their world-renowned live performances. [Two limited-edition vinyl colorways are available: white; and clear.]\n\nGuided By Voices – Welshpool Frillies CD/LP (Guided By Voices Inc.)\n\nWelshpool Frillies finds the gang back together, in a Brooklyn basement with producer Travis Harrison. Much of it was recorded live to tape. The catchy ear worms in these new songs are undeniable, as the kinetic energy of the band is captured in its most raw and pure form. The album is brash, no-frills, and punky, inspired by the wiliness of ‘90s-era GBV, specifically the Scalping The Guru compilation that Pollard put together in 2022.\n\nThe Isley Brothers – Make Me Say It Again Girl CD/2xLP (BFD)\n\n2023 release, the 32nd studio album from the soul music icons. Includes “Friends And Family” (featuring Snoop Dogg) and “Make Me Say It Again, Girl” (featuring Beyoncé). [A limited-edition green color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nJames – Be Opened By The Wonderful 2xCD (Virgin)\n\nRecently released on vinyl – including an indie store exclusive white colorway – now available on CD. Recorded at Blueprint Studios in Manchester in celebration of their 40th Anniversary, Be Opened By The Wonderful is a celebration of James’ most loved and rare tracks, reimagined with a 22-piece orchestra and eight-piece choir and including one brand-new track, “Love Make A Fool”. Tim Booth says “Life begins at 40. For our midlife euphoria we recorded a double orchestral album of some of our deepest cuts.”\n\nKiana Ledé – Grudges CD (Republic)\n\nArizona-raised artist Kiana Ledé releases her sophomore album, Grudges. Her relatability and poetic lyrics (set to an alluring blend of early R&B, soul, singer-songwriter, pop and hip-hop) have led to notable success.\n\nNils Lofgren – Mountains CD/LP (Cattle Track)\n\nOn his new album Mountains, Nils moves seamlessly between bluesy and straight ahead rockers and tender ballads as only he can, all treated with Nils’ sonic attention to detail and unmistakable vocals and guitar.\n\nMatteo Mancuso – The Journey CD/LP (Players Club)\n\nMatteo Mancuso hails from the far-away island of Sicily, nestled in the Mediterranean Sea to the South of Italy. The island has always had a rich cultural heritage, from poets, writers, philosophers, and architects to painters and musicians. Born in 1996 and raised just outside the capital Palermo, the pedigree runs deep in the veins of those from the region. Had his family relocated to the US, he might be the best-kept secret in the lineage of great Italian American players like Zappa, Vai, Satriani, Di Meola, Petrucci and Gambale. As a multi-faceted player, either classical or electric, what is astounding is his one-of-a-kind technique and use of his fingers instead of regular picking. With an impressive tone, original sound, and humble demeanor, you have the guitarist no one has ever seen and whose talent puts him in a different league.\n\nLori McKenna – 1988 CD/LP (CN)\n\nLori McKenna titled her new album 1988 after the year she married her husband, Gene, yet the ten songs within also serve as a love letter to lifelong friendships, people she’s lost, and her family. Recorded with producer Dave Cobb in Savannah, Georgia, 1988 naturally has its nostalgic moments, even if not every ending is a happy one. With more of an electric edge than her past projects, 1988 feels in step with classic ‘90s albums by Sheryl Crow or Gin Blossoms, where the lyrics pulled you in as much as the melody or production. Playing together on acoustic guitars while facing one another in the studio, McKenna and Cobb tracked the album live, giving it a feeling of immediacy and authenticity.\n\nCharles Mingus – Mingus [Reissue/1961] CD/LP (Candid)\n\nAt the time of this recording, Mingus had been working regularly with the piano-less quartet of Eric Dolphy, Ted Curson and Dannie Richmond. The same group featured on the 1960 Candid release, Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus. The Mingus album, also recorded that year, features one track, “Stormy Weather”, recorded with that same quartet, and two tracks recorded with a larger group featuring piano and additional horns. Of note, “MDM (Monk Duke & Me)” consumes most of this album. The piece consists of three intertwining themes – Duke Ellington’s “Main Stem”, Thelonious Monk’s “Straight, No Chaser”, and Mingus’ “Fifty First Street Blue”.\n\nNewJeans – NewJeans 2nd EP ‘Get Up’ (The POWERPUFF GIRLS X NJ Box Ver.) CD (Big Hit Entertainment)\n\nNewJeans – NewJeans 2nd EP ‘Get Up’ (BUNNY BEACH Bag Ver.) CD (Big Hit Entertainment)\n\nKnown as the K-Pop girl group that’s taken the world by a storm and broken world records, NewJeans is back with their 2nd EP titled ‘Get Up.’ Multiple collectable variations of each version are available.\n\nAlva Noto – This Stolen Country Of Mine: A Documentary Film By Marc Weise CD/2xLP (Noton)\n\nAlva Noto’s award-winning score for the 2022 German documentary film This Stolen Country Of Mine directed by German filmmaker Marc Wiese. Across 19 compositions, the music exposes and holds back when the images and statements of the protagonists speak for themselves, reflecting the dark shadows and the glares of hope of communal resistance.\n\nOxbow – Love’s Holiday CD/LP (Ipecac)\n\nOxbow is Dan Adams (electrical/acoustic bass), Greg Davis (drums/percussion), Eugene S. Robinson (vocals), and Niko Wenner (guitars/pianos). The San Francisco-born band has released seven studio albums since their inception in 1988, with Pitchfork saying the foursome have created “some of the most eccentric heavy music albums ever.” [An indie store exclusive red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nOmara Portuondo – Vida CD/LP (One World)\n\nNew release from the Cuban singer and diva of Buena Social Club. Vida is a tribute to Omara’s musical legacy.\n\nRachael Sage – The Other Side CD (Sono Recording Group)\n\nRachael Sage’s album The Other Side is as instantly hummable as it is lyrically poignant. With memorable Americana infused pop hooks & folk-fueled poeticism, Sage’s timeless writing reminds us that what’s most important is worth waiting for. Guests include Howard Jones & members of Patti Smith & Rufus Wainwright’s bands.\n\nNina Simone – You’ve Got To Learn CD/LP (Verve)\n\nThe Newport Jazz Festival had always brought the best out of Nina Simone. On July 2, 1966, the audience was treated to the full range of her artistry – from the opener, a breathtaking version of “You’ve Got To Learn” to a swinging take on “Mississippi Goddam”. After a sustained standing ovation, her fans were rewarded with the show-stopping encore, “Music For Lovers”. This previously unreleased recording makes it clear why hearing Nina Simone in concert was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. [An indie store exclusive color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nSomnuri – Desiderium CD/LP (MNRK Heavy)\n\nSomnuri do not keep their feet planted in surface reality. The Brooklyn-based heavy metal trio’s flavor of heavy metal stomps from genre to genre with the fervor and confidence of a band ready to cross thresholds of all that’s perceivable and possible. [A limited-edition blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nSpiritual Front – Rotten Roma Casino [Reissue/2010] 2xCD+DVD/LP\n\nSpiritual Front – The Queen Is Not Dead 2xCD/LP+7” (Prophecy)\n\nRotten Roma Casino (2010) is the follow-up to the seminal Armageddon Gigolo album (2006). The album presents the band’s unmistakable style: suicide pop with melancholic melodies, stirring guitar chords and emotional vocal parts. But Rotten Roma Casino goes even further: The band has reassembled their tried and tested ensemble, including chamber musicians from Ennio Morricone, and once again set off a firework of hits. The Queen Is Not Dead is the eighth studio full-length from the Italian band and an “homage to Morrissey’s and Johnny Marr’s legendary hymns of unquestionable beauty.” [Multiple vinyl colorways are available.]\n\nJacques Tati – Swing! [OST] CD/2xLP (Born Bad)\n\nWatching a movie by Tati is a surprising experience; in his films, sound and music speak more than words, overtaking the conventional discourse – and boredom – of adulthood. Hulot remains silent, or mumbles. Tati knows all about the noises of the modern world: beeps, rings, crackles, pneumatic drill, cars, mechanical, electrical, and rubbery sounds, the high heels of secretaries and typewriters, factory noises, creaking doors, sighing chairs, machines and technical machines, franglais, vacuum cleaners and the whole range of small appliances… With all of that urban and domestic jumble, plastics of all sorts, linoleum and Formica, he composes a virtuoso partition. Signs and signals, warning sounds and sirens mislead us in urban space. Tati maliciously disorients us. Maximalist, he records on five tracks in skillful, tasteful rhythms – a pleasure for the senses.\n\nThe Teskey Brothers – The Winding Way CD/LP (Glassnote)\n\nFour years after the boys from Warrandyte’s globe-conquering second album, Run Home Slow (2019), which followed their debut album Half Mile Harvest (2017), the artistic vision of vocalist Josh Teskey and his brother, guitarist and engineer Sam Teskey is more defined than ever on their highly anticipated new studio album The Winding Way. The album is a bigger and more adventurous sounding record than The Teskey Brothers’ first two albums – but while it’s a more studio-oriented release, each track is bursting with life and full of surprises. [An indie store exclusive white color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nThunderhorse – After The Fall CD/LP (Ripple Music)\n\n“There’s no denying the power and brilliance of Thunder Horse.”\n\nThy Art Is Murder – Hate [Reissue/2013] LP (Nuclear Blast)\n\nYellow w/ red & white splatter colorway of the Austrian deathcore outfit’s second album.\n\nMolly Tuttle & Golden Highway – City Of Gold CD/LP (BMG)\n\nCity Of Gold follows Molly Tuttle’s acclaimed 2022 record, Crooked Tree, which won Best Bluegrass Album at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards and led NPR Music to call her, “a female flat picker extraordinaire with agility, speed and elegance who distinctively brings American roots music into the spotlight,” adding that the album “marries the improvisatory solos of traditional bluegrass with singer-songwriter sophistication.” Produced by Tuttle and Jerry Douglas and recorded at Nashville’s Sound Emporium Studios, City Of Gold was inspired by Tuttle’s constant touring with Golden Highway the past few years, during which they have grown together as musicians and performers, cohering as a band. These 13 tracks – mostly written by Tuttle and Ketch Secor (Old Crow Medicine Show) – capture the electric energy of band’s live shows by highlighting each members’ musical strengths. [An indie store exclusive blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nDwight Twilly – The Best Of Dwight Twilly: The Tulsa Years 1999 – 2016 Volume 1 CD (Paramour)\n\nRecently released on vinyl – now available on CD. Dwight Twilley is a critically acclaimed singer/songwriter considered the Father of Power Pop. Spanning 1999 – 2016, Dwight released six original albums, several covers albums including one of Beatles songs, a live CD/DVD, an original Christmas collection, and a record of unreleased tracks.\n\nVarious Artists [Armin van Buuren] – A State Of Trance – 2023 (Mixed By Armin van Buuren) 3xCD (Armada Music)\n\nBrandishing tracks from artists such as Bryan Kearney, Maarten de Jong and Maddix across three sides rather than the usual two, A State Of Trance 2023 shows that the essence of trance music reaches far, wide and beyond the once-imposed borders.\n\nVarious Artists – Barbie The Album: Soundtrack CD/LP/Cassette (Atlantic)\n\nTo live in Barbie Land is to be a perfect being in a perfect place. Unless you have a full-on existential crisis. Or you’re a Ken. Oscar-nominated writer/director Greta Gerwig’s (Little Women, Lady Bird) new Barbie film stars Oscar-nominees Margot Robbie (Bombshell, I, Tonya) and Ryan Gosling (La La Land, Half Nelson) as Barbie and Ken. Barbie The Album features new tracks from an unprecedented lineup of artists including Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice, Lizzo, Karol G, Charli XCX, PinkPantheress, Ava Max, Dominic Fike, Khalid, The Kid Laroi, Tame Impala, Haim, Gayle and Fifty Fifty feat. Kali. Barbie star Ryan Gosling also joins the robust roster of soundtrack artists with his iconic original song performed as his character, Ken. [A limited-edition hot pink vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nVarious Artists – Superunknown Redux 2xCD/2xLP (Magnetic Eye)\n\nVarious Artists – Best Of Soundgarden Redux 2xCD/2xLP (Magnetic Eye)\n\nSuperunknown Redux presents new takes on all fifteen tracks from the seminal Soundgarden album from some of the most eclectic bands across rock and metal today, along with a few less heavy but captivating contributions. Also available is the companion release Best Of Soundgarden Redux, featuring covers of an additional 15 classics and deep cuts from across the rest of the grunge band’s extensive catalogue. [Two limited-edition vinyl colorways of Superunknown Redux are available: white; and red w/ black smoke. Two limited-edition vinyl colorways of Best Of Soundgarden Redux are available: clear/black marble; and translucent yellow.]\n\nVirtual Tyrant – Vultures Like You CD/LP (Ripple Music)\n\nPortland, Oregon’s Viral Tyrant breathe fresh into the doom sphere.\n\nVoïvod – Morgöth Tales CD/LP (Century Media)\n\nCelebrating 40 eventful years of existence, Canada’s progressive sci-fi metal innovators Voïvod present their special Anniversary release Morgöth Tales, which includes studio re-recordings nine songs from the band’s extremely diverse back catalogue (between 1984 and 2003) as well as a brand-new song in the album’s title-track, “Morgöth Tales”.\n\nThis Week’s Vinyl Exclusives:\n\n88Rising – Head In The Clouds [Reissue/2018] 2xLP (WB)\n\nDouble vinyl pressing of the 2018 release from the pioneering music and arts collective. While all 88Rising artists have excelled in their solo careers they’ve always operated with a crew mentality, and it’s with this collection that they were able to bring that to life.

The young guns in the quintet are superb, with Miles being pushed in new directions by Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams. E.S.P. is a post-bop excursion into mostly modal songs with Miles, Wayne and Herbie playing interlocking melodies that they improvise and fracture into something new.\n\nMiles Davis – In Person, Friday Night At The Blackhawk, San Francisco [Reissue/2003] 2xLP (Impex)\n\nMiles Davis’s two night stand at the Blackhawk in San Francisco in April, 1961 is a landmark record.

They may not have “started” the genre, but they were the first to tick all the boxes. The eels rejected every 1970s rock convention-professionalism, virtuosity, subject matter, image. Dave E.’s caustic vocals, complete with an aggressive lisp and a head full of snot, would become de rigeur a few years after the group disbanded. Meanwhile, the songs’ focus on car crashes, suicide, neuroses, and generally hating people were as far out of the mainstream as possible.

King himself considered it to be one of his greatest achievements.\n\nSteve Lacy – The Straight Horn Of Steve Lacy [Reissue/1961] LP (Candid)\n\nThe “straight horn” referred to in the title of this superb album from 1961 is the soprano saxophone, and Lacy is recognized as one of the greatest to ever play the instrument, ranking alongside John Coltrane and Sidney Bechet. Because of the difficulty involved in mastering its pitch challenges, very few jazzmen concentrated on it. Lacy is widely considered the first “modern” musician to specialize in the instrument. Lacy had a long and prolific career and a fascinating style trajectory. At sixteen he began playing Dixieland with the likes of Pee Wee Russell. In the mid-1950s he played free jazz with Cecil Taylor and appeared with his groundbreaking quartet at the 1957 New Port Jazz Festival. He made a notable appearance on the 1959 Gil Evens, Great Jazz Standards album.

More specifically, the content behind the project is that of the existential / primal and innate musings about cause, purpose, and self. It is the search for light and truth, or the fact that there is none. It comes from an embittered, burned, confused, and broken heart. It is the fight for survival when reason and foundation has turned to nothingness. It is the crashing down of towers of falsehood and the freedom that comes through a certain kind of grief. Ultimately, Mizmor is the manifestation of a long-felt depression which doesn’t have an end in sight.\n\nNurse With Wound – Brained By Fallen Masonry / Cooloorta Moon LP (United Dirter)\n\nLimited-edition picture disc.

The prolific MC, producer, and musician’s new album The Iceberg is a plea for humanity to dig deeper in search of understanding and common ground. His third release in just 12 months, The Iceberg is a distillation of stereotypical tropes in hip-hop and beyond; 12 tracks about money, sex, politics, race, and religion that appear superficial until his multi-dimensional lyrics unfurl to expose the complexities of individuality and identity – how we see ourselves and how others see us. Deeply soulful, and shot through with jazz, go-go, gospel, thick R&B and hard beats, the album is a timely, poetic statement.\n\nPelican – The Fire In Our Throats Will Beckon The Call [Reissue/XXXX] 2xLP+MP3 (Thrill Jockey)\n\nPelican and Thrill Jockey present a deluxe edition of the band’s acclaimed 2005 album: The Fire In Our Throats Will Beckon The Thaw, newly remixed, remastered, and featuring special bonus rarities including an early version of “Red Ran Amber”, (previously only available on a split with Mono) and demos of “Autumn Into Summer”, “Last Day Of Winter”, and “Sirius”. The Fire In Our Throats established Pelican as indisputable masters of their craft. Pelican’s ability to alchemize their influences into a sound so wholly original and then expand on that sound into a work of captivating beauty remains a marvel. The album indelibly shifted the paradigm of heavy music, and the ripples of that shift can be heard in the countless bands that have risen to prominence since its release. [An indie store exclusive pressing is available.]\n\nPhish – Fuego [Reissue/2013] 2xLP (Jemp)\n\n‘Spontaneous combustion’ orange color vinyl pressing of Phish’s thirteenth studio album.\n\nBrontez Purnell – No Jack Swing LP (Dark Entries/ Papi Juice)\n\nNo Jack Swing is the solo electronic debut of multi-hype man Brontez Purnell.

Back in 1976 the long psychedelic wave was rapidly fading away, but the market of private press was still in demand. The self-debut album of Relatively Clean Rivers came out the same year on the leader Phil Pearlman label. The brainchild of Phil Pearlman, the band was rapidly crossing genres focusing on extended long jam verging on Californian psych and proto-ambient country/folk.\n\nBuddy Rich – Birdland [Reissue/2015] LP (Lightyear)\n\nLimited 180gm translucent red color vinyl pressing.

His approach to McIng, though, wasn’t exactly in line with the traditional school of hip hop.

Following the additions of veteran guitarist Richard Chowenhill and bassist/vocalist Leah Levinson to the band’s lineup, this idea would crystalize into the “ecstatic black metal” backbone of Agriculture’s music.\n\nCut Worms – Cut Worms (Jagjaguwar)\n\nAs Cut Worms, songwriter Max Clarke’s contemporary vision of American heritage rock-n-roll is both pristine and askew. He’s been called a modern Buddy Holly and Everly Brothers while also being tagged as “Lynchian.” Since 2016, this vision has made Cut Worms fans of Nick Lowe, Norah Jones, Wilco, and other notable powerhouse artists.
