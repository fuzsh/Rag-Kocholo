good man the bestest ever - everytime that i lock it down and endeavor to demonstrate that i make the mate that you want up in your corner it seems you wanna make it harder every step of the way say you just needing a bite but then you take the buffet no longer reach for my hand im always fishing for yours whenever youre fishing for compliments i will find you the words still got these bees and the birds wrapped all up deep in your curves butterflies up in my tummy dumbly put a crease in my nerves but it occurs to me that i do none of the same to the vision that you have of me and i think im to blame so i turn up the flame double down and maintain because as long as one of us is loving its all in the game everything you need i give you but dont receive back and now im in the breeze in the wind another victim of the one way love i got this - cup - filled to the top with emotional potion and every time you take a sip i notice something is broken i cant help but notice that your focus is off you stay a million miles away after ive broken you off cant - put my finger on it - but somethings amiss the way that you used to clutch my shoulders when i went in for a kiss the way that you ran your fingers through my hair like a comb and the way that youd sing my name when you would answer the phone i feel alone - i cant ignore anymore and ive confirmed my suspicions but every day im still wishing that this phase will just pass and its back to the fast love ignite that old school passion that we had in the past, love but thats love - sometimes you give and you take sometimes you bending over backwards so much that you break i cant - be the only one forgiving mistakes cause id rather have you give me nothing than something this fake everything you need i give you but dont receive back and now im in the breeze in the wind another victim of the one way love\n\n9.\n\nsecond base appeal 04:23\n\nlike most things in my life - i met her on the internet i was still finding myself not

remix) 03:44\n\nLate in the evening, or is it morning? Couple days lie awake and they see me yawning James Bonding, pinging and they ain't responding Mission accomplished, yeah bitch, I'm pwning Roll out the crib, white hat on the crest \"Spamtec\" like a badge on the right of my chest Blip-blip on my Sidekick, I flip my wrist SSH to my box, page down to next My stats look good, what about my checks? So many digits, its a googolplex Rotation of the earth like my spam subjects Perplexed the best when you get no rest Slide in my Chrysler, the blades'll slide ya Mesh grill on the front just to entice ya IPod in the dash, Nerd Life supreme Track track to the Spamtec audio stream Still live my life like the perfect dream There ain't a soul that can touch me or my team (nah) District attorneys set out on journeys And then I lead them on like \"A Weekend at Bernie's\" Feds on the scene, try to collect all my convos See me on AIM talking to all the blonde ho's Condos, coast-to-coast, wireless enabled When they set to sniff I switch the cables IPs bounce through multi-nations I keep confidential like doctor's patients This nerd life and this DG death Represent DG 'til my dying breath [Hook] I still a DG and I ain't going to stop So don't twist it up make it something its not From hangars to bandwidth I'm still kicking And I'll fry your ass like a piece of chicken [Verse 2] Drive to local coffee stop Pull my laptop out and setup shop Five for the coffee, pay and swap Card a couple XBox to my drop Its a merry Christmas if you figure this Both the naughty and nice are on my list And if you notice something missing, don't get pissed I pulled all your info from Lex-Nexus Those who cross me: cross with care Because I won't leave 'til your wallet's bare You can't run from social because I'll be there And I'll get your next one, you don't have a prayer I swear, people baffle me Who the fuck would even want to battle me? (who?) Boy what a fucking day that'll be When their life disappears with the chattle, G Don't rattle, cause we rich in numbers Everyday see a couple of fresh newcomers Try to make a name of my demise And I always hit them up with the YT surprise Might not happen right away cause I lay in the weeds And I strike like a snake whenever I please And such is the life of most DG's You don't see it coming until you're on your knees Begging and pleading, \"please stop beefing\" You don't understand, we get mad and even But it ain't even fair because we leave them breathing Dealing with a shitstorm of digital treason Screaming, screaming, sowed not reaping End up as a blip on my Sidekick beeping Every time they try to weasel out of my trap I pull them right back put they head in my lap Little stressful, but I got enough cigs And I got enough proxies to shake the pigs Carton after carton of these 72's And I'm still pulling hits out of my Underoos I still bruise, pack up and DoS a server Sit back and act like a calm observer Call all the shots from miles away Sitting in the Starbucks at the break of day I don't play, so act like you think you know Cause I'm a fucking DG You're a fucking bitch yo Yeah\n\n24.\n\npaint (dicepticon remix) 03:09"
