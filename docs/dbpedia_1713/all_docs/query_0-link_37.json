The change – which has eschewed multiple releases across the week in favour of one singular day – will affect 45 countries, and was put in place by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The conglomerate currently represents 1300 various record companies around the world.\n\nFriday was chosen as the official day in an effort to curb piracy, as both physical and online stores peak with consumer traffic over the weekend. July was chosen in an effort to work out and fine-tune any kinks prior to the holiday season.\n\nFor more on the topic, you can head over here. But for now, as always…\n\nHere’s a list of major new releases for the week of July 10th, 2015.
