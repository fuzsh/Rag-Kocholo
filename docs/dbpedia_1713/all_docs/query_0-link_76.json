        "text": "Dolton Records\n\nLOCATION: Seattle, WA / Los Angeles, CA\n\nOWNER(s): Bob Reisdorff, Bonnie Guitar, Lou Lavinthal, Stan Solman, and Stan Jaffe.\n\nTIMESPAN: 1959-1961 (Seattle) / 1961-1967 (Los Angeles)\n\n\"DOLTON: THE NORTHWEST'S FIRST ROCK 'N' ROLL RECORD COMPANY\"\n\nby Peter Blecha [Courtesy & copyright, 2006, HistoryLink.org]\n\nThe Pacific Northwest has produced its fair share of pioneering record companies over the years including early ones like Seattle's Evergreen, Rainier, Linden, and Morrison Records; Portland's Rose City Records; and Spokane's SRC Records. Although such labels enjoyed a fair number of local sales by issuing discs of provincial pop singers, country roadhouse bands, or Scandinavian dance music in the 1940s and 1950s, each lacked either the savvy management, adequate capital, or effective distribution channels required to break out and score \"hits\" outside the region. It took the formation of Dolton Records in 1959 -- the region's first rock 'n' roll-oriented label -- to achieve that goal. And Dolton accomplished all that in a big way, issuing records by teenaged musicians from various Northwest towns including Olympia, Tacoma, Spokane, and Seattle -- and scoring a breathtaking series of six singles in a row (including an international Gold Record Award-winning No. 1 hit with their debut release), which all placed on the Billboard and/or The Cash Box magazine best-seller charts. [READ MORE...]\n\nMISC NOTES: This company's very first 45 rpm record was issued under their original name of Dolphin Records. It became a million-seller hit. Problem was, there already was an existing Dolphin Records back east. After legal pressure, the Seattle label was relaunched as Dolton Records - a choice that was driven by a goal of minimally altering an already successful record label / logo. Interestingly, that original Dolphin label - which was designed by UW student and bassist with The Frantics, Jim Manolides - featured a graphic representation of three fish (rather than dolphins). However, some specimens of Dolphin #1 (which were made at pressing plants across the country, rather than in California), do feature an identifiable dolphin design.\n\nDOLTON MILESTONES:\n\n2/1959: Dolphin Records debuts with its first and only 45 rpm release.\n\n5/1959: Dolton Records debuts with its next release.\n\n9/1959: The first stereo-labeled Dolton 45 issued.\n\n11/1959: Dolton moved its headquarters from 708 6th Avenue No. to 622 Union St., Seattle.\n\n11/1960: Dolton merged with Liberty Records and relocated from Seattle to Los Angeles. At that time the third label design implemented and word \"Records\" added to label name.\n\n1962: The Dolton name was purchased by Liberty. At that time the 4th label design change was made.\n\n7/1964: The fourth design promo (4PA) labels first begin to appear.\n\n09/1964: In USA, the last two digit # (99) were used on labels. Numbering jumps to the 300 series.\n\n09/64: Silver numerals and lettering begin to replace black on the fourth logo retail labels.\n\n??/????: The fifth label design adopted.\n\n12/1966 or 1/1967: The Dolton brand was retired.\n\nDOLTON (U.S.A.) 45 RPM DISCOGRAPHY LABEL DESIGN KEY:\n\nFirst Digit:\n\n1 = First logo label design\n\n2 = Second logo label design\n\n3 = Third logo label design\n\n4 = Fourth logo label design\n\n5 = Fifth logo label design\n\nFirst Letter:\n\nP = Promotional label\n\nR = Retail label\n\nSecond Letter:\n\nA = First discovered variation promo or retail label numeral/wording layout, etc\n\nB = Second discovered variation promo or retail label numeral/wording layout\n\nC = Third discovered variation promo or retail label numeral/wording layout\n\nEtc.\n\nNOTE: The above system was designed and implemented in April, 2018. Because of the manner in which different label designs are discovered and entered, 1PA/1RA, etc. on one disc is not necessarily the same as 1PA/1RA etc. on another. It is obvious, however, that label design patterns do exist. Maybe - some day - we will be able to organize them by their individual label assignment and distribution sequences.\n\nDOLTON (U.S.A.) 33 1/3 RPM DISCOGRAPHY LABEL KEY:\n\nThere were no album releases featuring the first 3-fish logo.\n\nAlbums through at least #17 featured the second 3-fish logo appeared.\n\nBeginning with original release of album # ? the multi-colored 3-fish logo emerged.\n\nThe capitol Dolton logo first appeared on album release #?.\n\nBeyond the first seven album releases, it is difficult to determine which logo design accompanied new album releases as it appears the label designs were often mixed and matched in factory pressing lots without any change to the design shown on the album jacket.\n\nAfter the demise of Dolton, a number of albums were re-issued on the Liberty label. Some of these carried a Liberty serial number, but without any change to the album title or jacket. Others featured the Dolton jacket while the disc featured the Liberty label accompanied by the old Dolton number.\n\nNOTE: Beginning in early 1961 (and with disc #34) Dolton Records -- with its headquarters now relocated from Seattle to Los Angeles -- shifts from its initial focus on producing and promoting recordings by Pacific Northwest-based artists to broadening its talent roster and product catalog to include numerous artists from California (and elsewhere). Those non-Northwest artists and discs are noted directly below, while the Northwest-associated artists and their recordings are detailed in the database further below that. [In addition, Dolton's original Serial Number sequence included some that, for unknown reasons, were ultimately never assigned to any particular release, and they are noted here as well.]\n\n9: Jerry Davis - \"Prove Our Love Is True\" [title cataloged but not released]\n\n12: Jerry Davis - \"To Prove Our Love Is True\" / \"My Very Best To You\" [1959-11] (Nebraska)\n\n11: [no artist or song titles cataloged or released]\n\n20: [no artist or song titles cataloged or released]\n\n21: [no artist or song titles cataloged or released]\n\n34: Vic Dana - \"Someone New\" / \"The Girl In My Dreams\" [1961-01]\n\n36: Chuck Roberts - \"That's How It's Gonna Be\" / \"Wo Wo Baby\" [1961-02]\n\n37: [no artist or song titles cataloged or released]\n\n39: [no artist or song titles cataloged or released]\n\n42: Vic Dana - \"The Story Behind My Tears\" / \"Golden Boy\" [1961-06]\n\n46: Teddy Ross - \"Water Boy\" / \"Ain't That Love\" [1961-09]\n\n48: Vic Dana - \"Little Alter Boy\" / \"Hello Roommate\" [1961-10]\n\n51: Vic Dana - \"I Will \" / \"Proud\" [1962-02]\n\n52: Miniature Men - \"Soupy's Theme (Soupy's Shuffle)\" / \"Miniature Blues\" [1962-03]\n\n53: Johnny Victor - \"Come To Me Johnny\" / \"The Tears You Never Cried\" [1962-04]\n\n54: [no artist or song titles cataloged or released]\n\n56: Hank Levine - \"Theme From Dr. Kildare\" / \"Theme From National velvet\" [1962-05]\n\n57: Miniature Men - \"Baby Elephant Walk\" / \"Bool-Ya-Base\" [1962-05]\n\n58: Vic Dana - \"(A Girl Needs) To Love And Be Loved\" / \"Time Can Change\" [1962-06]\n\n59: Wanderers Three - \"Cry I Do\" / \"Toro\" [1962-07] (Texas)\n\n61: Five Whispers - \"Midnight Sun\" / \"Moon In The Afternoon\" [1962-08]\n\n63: Hank Levine - \"Portrait Of A Blond\" / \"Theme From Hong Kong\" [1962-09]\n\n64: Vic Dana - \"A Very Good Year For Girls\" / \"Looking For Me\" [1962-09]\n\n64: Vic Dana - \"A Very Good Year For Girls\" / \"I Wanna Be There\" [1962-09]\n\n65: [no artist or song titles cataloged or released]\n\n66: Wanderers Three - \"My Glory land\" / \"Tuen Around\" [1962-11-12] (Texas)\n\n69: Five Whispers - \"Awake Or Asleep\" / \"Especially For You\" [1963-03]\n\n71: Hank Levine - \"Moon On My Pillow\" / \"Anything, Anywhere\" [1963-03]\n\n72: Three Wishes - \"Guiding Light\" / \"It's All Said And Done\" [1963-03]\n\n73: Vic Dana - \"Danger\" / \"Heart, Hand And Teardrop\" [1963-04]\n\n77: [no artist or song titles cataloged or released]\n\n79: Hank Levine - \"Tinga Tonga\" / \"Swingin' Village\" [1963-06]\n\n81: Vic Dana - \"More\" / \"That's Why I'm Sorry\" [1963-07]\n\n82: Wanderers Three - \"Wanderin'\" / \"Hi-De-Ink-Tum\" [ 1983-09] (Texas)\n\n83: Dodie Stevens - \"I Wore Out Your Record\" / \"You Don't Have To Prove A Thing\" [1963-09]\n\n84: Christopher Monte - \"Giants Of Bombora\" / \"My Paradise\" [1963-09]\n\n87: Vic Dana - \"A Voice In The Wind\" / \"The Prisoner's Song\" [1963-11]\n\n88: Dodie Stevens - \"Does Goodnight Mean Goodbye (Love Song From The Victors)\" / \"Sailor Boy\" [1963-12]\n\n89: Vic Dana - \"So Wide The World\" / \"Close Your Eyes\" [1963-12]\n\n90: Five Whispers - \"Can't Face The Crowd\" / \"Sleep Walk\" [1964-01]\n\n92: Vic Dana - \"Warm And Tender\" / \"Shangri-La\" [1964-03]\n\n95: Vic Dana - \"Love Is All We Need\" / \"I Need You Now\" [ 1964-06]\n\n99: Vic Dana - \"Garden In The Rain\" / \"Stairway To The Stars\" [1964-09]\n\n301: Vic Dana - \"Frenchy\" / \"It Was Night (Fol A Noite)\" [1964-11]\n\n304: Vic Dana - \"Red Roses For A Blue Lady\" / \"Blue Ribbons (For Her Curls)\" [1965-01]\n\n305: Vic Dana - \"Bring A Little Sunshine (To My Heart)\" / \"That's All\" [1965-05]\n\n309: Vic Dana - \"Moonlight And Roses (Bring Mem'ries Of You\" / What'll I Do\" [1965-08]\n\n313: Vic Dana - \"Crystal Chandelier\" / \"What Now My Love (Et Maintenant\" [1965-11]\n\n314: Gail Da Corsi - \"Touch Of Yesterday\" / \"I've Lost In Life\" [1966-01]\n\n317: Vic Dana - \"Love Kravezit\" / \"Hello Roommate\" [1966-02]\n\n318: [no artist or song titles cataloged or released]\n\n319: Vic Dana - \"I Love You Drops\" / \"Sunny Skies\" [1966-04]\n\n322: Vic Dana - \"A Million And One\" / \"My Baby Wouldn't Leave Me\" [19666-07]\n\n324: Vic Dana - \"Distant Drums\" / \"Love Me With All Your Heart\" [1966-10]\n\n326: Vic Dana - \"Grown Up Games\" / \"So What's New?\" [1966-12]\n\n8009: Roy Lanham - The Most Exciting Guitar [1961]\n\n8013: Vic Dana - This Is Vic Dana [1962]\n\n8015: Vic Dana - Warm And Wild [1962]\n\n8021: Wanderers Three - We Sing Folk Songs [1962]\n\n8024: Vic Dana - Shangri-La [1964]\n\n8026: Vic Dana - More [1963]\n\n8028: Vic Dana - Shangri-La [1964]\n\n8028: Vic Dana - Shangri-La [1964]\n\n8032: Vic Dana - Now!
