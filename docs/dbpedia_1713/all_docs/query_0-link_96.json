Riffs come in explosive layered packets. Leads, harmonies and melodies are more on par with wind-tussled mountain tops instead of sweaty bar shows and the band moves with finely honed, martial accuracy as conducted by Hannay’s rocket-in-the-pocket staccato swing and accents.\n\nSongs like “The Torch” blaze with the shirtless glisten of ‘70s stadium rock power. “Cloak of the Vast and Black” swirls and whirls with a combination of hardcore intensity, grunge groove and expansive six-string parries. “In the Absence of Wisdom” is a hurricane-sized maelstrom of classic and prog rock elevated to grandiosity by a return to their growling sludge/death early years as the song/album concludes. The album’s first single, “Melt the Crown” mixes cues from legendary fellow hosers Rush and Harlequin, turn-of-the-millennium post-metal and the most psychedelic corners of the Rise Above Records roster.\n\nAlbum opener “Forbidden Sanctuary” is the soundtrack to exploration, of new worlds and sonic arrangement as sine-wave guitars pull from vintage Mercyful Fate covens and Krautrock communes with synths opening up novel textural avenues, as they do on the ethereal wispiness and space rock/sci-fi soundscapes of the instrumental “Candescence.”\n\nMedia/Samples\n\nBandcamp\n\nLinks:\n\nWeb page\n\nFacebook\n\nProgarchives\n\nCountry: Russia\n\nGenre(s): Progressive Rock/Metal\n\nFormat: digital\n\nRelease date: August 16 , 2024\n\nTracklist\n\n1. Recurring Dreams\n\n2. Long Gone Years\n\n3. Break the Spell\n\n4. Where Nothing Exists\n\n5. Falling\n\n6. Light Pollution\n\n7. Reasonable Nonsense\n\n8. Unenviable Inevitable\n\n9. Shy-Hearted\n\n10. Bloodline\n\nCredits\n\nEgor Lappo - Vocals, Guitars, Synths, Programming, Mixing, Mastering\n\nDescription/Reviews:\n\nThe album's title is a play on the absurdity of life, reflecting on how major life events (such as death) can be explained easily with logic but are incredibly difficult to overcome in reality.\n\nOn this album Lappo returns to his prog metal roots, but folds in inspirations from 90’s industrial, 00’s pop and 2010’s prog. Tracks like the opener \"Recurring Dreams\" display Lappo’s familiar lush prog-metal leanings, while songs like \"Where Nothing Exists\" and \"Shy-Hearted\" are the most aggressive and energetic tracks he has ever done. The album goes full pop on the Britney/Max Martin-esque \"Break the Spell\" and the power-balladry of \"Bloodline\", while the song \"Light Pollution\" presents a modern take on 80s AOR. As a whole, Reasonable Nonsense is an eclectic and engaging listen.\n\nLyrically, the album highlights the contrasts between existentialism and nihilism. While \"Break the Spell\" is a triumph over anxiety, \"Unenviable Inevitable\" questions the meaning of life and doubts the ultimate value of existence. Other tracks take a more personal bend: \"Light Pollution\" is about excessive jealousy and \"Long one Years\" is a song about grief. On a lighter note, the twangy “Falling” celebrates letting old habits die and embracing the path forward. Reasonable Nonsense masterfully weaves its way through some of life’s contradictions over the course of its 10 eclectic tracks.\n\nLinks:\n\nFacebook\n\nProgarchives\n\nProggnosis\n\nCountry: Norway\n\nGenre(s): Instrumental Progressive Rock\n\nLabel: Apollon Records\n\nFormat: vinyl, CD, digital\n\nRelease date: September 6, 2024\n\nTracklist\n\n1.

It looms at a crossroads of genres and brings together elements taken from throughout the band’s discography. “Seam of the Heart” is a multi-movement composition whose lyrics resonate with their eerie concept album, Heron Leg. “Ritual Lite” competes for poppiest melody with both Congenital Fixation and Of Losing Interest. Throughout the album, the guitar work shapeshifts from jagged riffage to ethereal textures, offering a summary of decades of refinement.\n\nMedia/Samples\n\nBandcamp\n\nLinks:\n\nFacebook\n\nProggnosis\n\nCountry: UK\n\nGenre(s): Art Rock\n\nFormat: CD, digital\n\nRelease date: February 23, 2024\n\nTracklist\n\n1.

Fortune Favours The Brave (6:45)\n\nTotal Time 43:23\n\nCredits\n\nSharon Cannings and Martin Nicholls\n\nDescription/Reviews:\n\nI wouldn’t call it progressive “rock”, as it is quite reserved for the most part. It has folk character, but it’s not really folk music, either. You could call it experimental or progressive to some degree, but it also shares DNA with 70s soft rock. It’s almost like Renaissance and Fleetwood Mac had a baby, and they named it Pink Floyd. The guitar work is mostly acoustic, but electric guitars are brought in for effect and for some truly great solos. Sharon’s vocals are golden and passionate, and many of the songs hover upon her vocal exercises before slowly and surely adding layers until, before you even realize it, the song has become a flowing river of melody and various colorful sparks.\n\nRead the full review by Jason Spencer at theprogmind.com\n\nMedia/Samples\n\nBandcamp\n\nLinks:\n\nWeb page\n\nFacebook\n\nCountry: USA\n\nGenre(s): Instrumental Progressive Rock\n\nFormat: CD, digital, cassette\n\nRelease date: July 19, 2024\n\nTracklist\n\n1.

Bolder, overtly progressive songwriting is combined with a more pronounced virtuosity, yet it never loses the accessible elements that made the first album such a critical and artistic success.\n\nOnce again, Andreas’ former bandmate, electric harpist Nerissa Schwarz enriches the music with a wide range of sounds, from eerie ambient soundscapes to energetic outbursts. Lyrically the album deals primarily with the theme of impermanence and the way in which we are all affected by the knowledge of our own mortality. All these elements are combined in a unique cinematic, gothic and truly progressive album, that despite its musical complexities remains relatable and honest, and will linger in the listener’s mind long after the music stops.\n\nMedia/Samples\n\nBandcamp\n\nCountry: Netherlands\n\nGenre(s): Symphonic\n\nLabel: Spirit of Unicorn Music\n\nFormat: CD, digital, vinyl\n\nRelease date: July 5, 2024\n\nTracklist\n\n01.

Sadly, there is no yodelling but, on the plus side, band founder Thijs van Leer has refrained from indulging in the groaning vocals that marred one of the tracks on the previous album.\n\nRead the full review by Kevan Furbank at theprogressiveaspect.net\n\nMedia/Samples\n\nFjord Focus\n\nLinks:"
