        "text": "F&W String Band \"The Canterbury Country Orchestra Meets The F&W String Band\" (F&W Records, 1970-?) (LP)\n\nThis far-flung ensemble was a cross-pollination of several New England folk and dance groups, including the Canterbury Country Orchestra and the Fireside String Band, with interlocking memberships and a common devotion to odd, eclectic, and antiquated music, performed in kind of a grand, orchestral style. F&W took its name from the Farm and Wilderness camps, a summer camp program with roots in the Quaker movement. The group started out playing in the camp setting, and made its public debut at the 1969 Vermont Fiddler's Convention. The music really draws more on English and Celtic folk traditions than on actual country music... But what the heck. It's kooky and very 'Seventies, and this album pops up all the time. Worth checking out, though probably not that accessible for most casual listeners.\n\nF&W String Band \"2\" (F&W Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nThe Fabulous Backup Band/Various Artists \"God, Guts And Guns\" (Talon Records, 1984) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ron DiIulio)\n\nA patriotic, pro-gun country album from the Lone Star State, packed with iffy twang and cut-rate southern rock riffs... Producer Ron DiIulio plays keyboards and sings lead on about half the tracks, with other lead vocalists including guitar player Gene Bell, bassist Keith Davis and vocalist Laurie Douglas, and steel guitar provided by Gary Carpenter. Recorded in Fort Worth, this is an odd record, possibly one of those tax dodges you hear about. It was commissioned by executive producer \"E. Donzetta Talon,\" which as far as I can tell, was a fictional identity. Amid numerous cover songs is one original, called \"Gun Control,\" written by \"Fletcher\" and published by Donzetta Talon, it is sung by DiIulio and is one of the more pointedly political numbers on the record... Other songs seem fairly tame considering the album's artwork and title -- stuff like Charlie Daniels' \"In America,\" Merle Haggard's \"Fightin' Side Of Me,\" Johnny Cash's \"Ragged Old Flag\" and Barry Sadler's \"Ballad Of The Green Beret,\" and even more innocuously, tunes like the T. Texas Tyler chestnut, \"Deck Of Cards\" and Mel Tillis's \"Stateside.\" Bandleader Ron DiIulio definitely had an impressive career: he played piano in a fabled mid-1960s Denton, Texas garage band called the Chessmen, then moved through a series of other local bands before being tapped to train as a concert pianist, as a protege of international star Van Cliburn. He went on to work as an audio producer, jingle writer and film composer, and eventually, I believe, as an astrophysicist, among other pursuits running the planetarium in Fort Worth. Wow.\n\nThe Fabulous Beats \"...Go Country Style!\" (Design Records, 1964)\n\n(Producer not listed)\n\nHardy-har-har. The gag is having four mop-topped Beatles imitators sing country standards, with familiar harmonies, fake accents and surfy Fender guitars... The results are subpar but entertaining: these manic and anonymous lads sound more like Chad & Jeremy than John, Paul, George & Ringo, but it's still kinda funny. And of course, the real Beatles would have the last laugh when they demonstrated their love of twang and recorded actual country songs (such as their cover of \"Act Naturally\") which gave George Harrison a chance to perfect his Chet Atkins riffs. Anyway, this cheapo-label knockoff is a nice curio of the British invasion era.\n\nThe Fabulous Continentals \"Live At The Grain Bin - Weds. Fri. Sat.\" (Jerry Sparks Record Productions, 19--?)\n\n(Produced by Jerry Sparks)\n\nAn ultra-obscuro LP recorded at the Grain Bin Saloon, in Garden City, Kansas... I'm not sure if this band, which included Gary Batchelder, Jerry Wilcox, Carl Knaus, Jimmy Knight and Freddy Morales (on congas!) was connected to the early '60s Topeka, Kansas garage band, the Rockin' Continentals, but it seems possible. Anyway, apparently these guys showed up on the LAS VEGAS GRIND compilation series, though they are definitely playing some country stuff on this album. Let's hear it for the Free State! Ad Astra Per Aspera!\n\nThe Fabulous Rhinestones \"The Fabulous Rhinestones\" (Just Sunshine Records, 1972) (LP)\n\nProduced by The Fabulous Rhinestones & Michael Lang)\n\nThis one's added as more of a \"buyer beware\" listing: if you like early '70s groove and boogie rock, go for it, but if you're mainly into country-rock and twang, this is definitely too rock'n'roll for you. Formed in San Francisco, the Rhinestones are occasionally mentioned in connection to early country-rock because guitarist Kal David was previously in the Illinois Speed Press, a country-tinged band with Paul Cotton, and Paul Cotton later joined an early lineup of Poco. But this album is pretty strictly hippie-era heavy-rock and funky jam-band R&B, good for what it is, but not very country. Steel player Ben Keith plays on the record's lone acoustic tune, \"Big Indian,\" and electric blues legend Paul Butterfield blows harp on the opening track. They recorded two other albums, which I guess I'll check out if I get a chance, and I'll let you know if they ever got any twangier...\n\nJohn Fahey - see artist discography\n\nTommy Faile \"The Best Of Tommy\" (Peach Records, 1972) (LP)\n\nTommy Faile \"...Sings Brown Mountain Light\" (CMC/Clay Music Corporation, 1974-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Arthur Smith & Charles Andrews)\n\nAlthough his name might not be immediately recognizable, his music is... Born in South Carolina, songwriter Tommy Faile was an old-school Southern country'n'bluegrass musician who crossed the state line and made his home in Charlotte, NC, working in the bands of Snuffy Jenkins and Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith. He's best known for writing the mega-classic, trucker recitation song, \"Phantom 309,\" which became a huge hit for Red Sovine. Faile plays his own version of the song on here, along with several other originals and a few covers, including his version of \"The Legend Of The Brown Mountain Lights,\" a novelty number about a will-o-wisp phenomenon sometimes seen in rural North Carolina. Not sure who backed Faile on this album, but it's a pretty good bet that at least one of the pickers was Arthur Smith himself... Faile also released a slew of indie-label singles in the 1950s and '60s, though as far as I know they haven't been collected anywhere... yet.\n\nTommy Faile \"Full Moon Spell\" (Sapphire Records, 1984) (LP)\n\n(Produced by David Floyd)\n\nTommy Faile \"No Fool Like An Old Fool\" (Sapphire Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Tommy Faile & David Floyd)\n\nDave Faircloth \"The Man\" (Angela Celeste Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Gene Breeden)\n\nA retired rodeo rider and ex-Marine, Texas-born Dave Faircloth made his way out West and had settled down in Bakersfield by the time he cut this album. The sessions were recorded in Nashville, and included several songs written by Faircloth, along with tunes by Red Simpson, Charles Hinley, Len Wade and Jerry Ward (whose \"That Hat Don't Make You A Cowboy\" is an album highlight. The studio crew included Gene Breeden on lead guitar, Terry Crisp playing steel, and Bruce Watkins on fiddle and bass. The single released off this album says he's backed by \"his Jack Daniels Road Band,\" but I'm not sure how much touring Faircloth did, or how many of the guys backing him on this album were in a real-live band with him.\n\nFall City Ramblers \"Ain't Nothin' In Ramblin' \" (Vetco Records, 1975) (LP)\n\nFall City Ramblers \"Early Indiana Days\" (Palm Tree Records, 1976) (LP)\n\nThis free-flowing, dynamic stringband from Madison, Indiana mixed bluegrass and old-timey with a dash of classic jug-band blues and a hint of old-world European styles and even some hapa haole Hawaiian music, such as the oldie, \"The Old Palm Tree.\" Not sure how long the group was together, but they were pretty darn good!\n\nFall River Wranglers \"Fall River Country\" (Fall River Enterprises, 19--?) (LP)\n\nBabe Humphrey, Bob Minser and Paul Moyers formed a western trio connected to the Estes Park, Colorado dude ranch and its \"chuckwagon supper\" singalongs... They sang a lot of typical cowboy stuff, \"Ghost Riders In The Sky,\" \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" and the like, but also some saltier, more country material, such as \"Bayou Baby\" as well as a gospel tune or two. Unfortunately the voluble liner notes by Denver music critic Red Fenwick aren't terribly informative, other than to tell us the guys were midwesterners, from Colorado, Illinois and Iowa. At any rate, fans of old Gene Autry or Roy Rogers records should get a kick out of this relaxed, retrodelic session.\n\nRuby Falls \"Sweet Country Lady\" (Fifty States Records, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Charlie Fields & Johnny Howard)\n\nBertha Bearden Dorsey -- aka Ruby Falls (1946-1986) -- was a country gal from Jackson, Tennessee who worked for several years in the Midwest, most notably as a featured singer in the late 'Sixties Milwaukee soul band, Harvey Scales and The Seven Sounds. In 1974 she headed back to Nashville to devote herself to a country music career, enjoying a fair amount of success in the late 1970s, cutting a string of twangy singles and one full LP. Along with Linda Martell she was one of the first African-American female singers to break into the national market, albeit with limited commercial success. This album collects several singles recorded between 1975-80, including 1977's \"You've Got To Mend This Heartache,\" which was her only song to break into the country Top Forty. Unfortunately the liner notes don't list any of the musicians involved, though they were doubtless guys who were in the orbit of producer Charlie Fields, or possibly members of Justin Tubb's road band, as she sang backup with his group.\n\nFamily Jam \"Breadline\" (Gladstone Productions, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Richie Cicero)\n\nA hippie-era acoustic string-swing thing from Denver, Colorado, this group included vocals from Paul Conly, Dugg Duggan and Melody Duggan, with several original songs provided by Mr. Conly and one by Mr. Duggan. Paul Conly appears to have been the same Denver musician who was a founding member of the psychedelic rock band Lothar & The Hand People, and wrote many of the songs on this album around the time of that band's dissolution, while Duggan was a founding member of the 'Seventies country-rock group Timberline, which started in Omaha and decamped to Denver in the early 'Seventies. Family Jam seems to have started out as Duggan's side project, producing at least one earlier record, a 1972 single under the name Dugg Duggan & The Family Jam, with two of his songs \"Steppin' Out\" and \"You,\" and later recording this full album, with Conly stepping up as the primary songwriters. They jokingly called their music \"ragtime cowboy jam\" and \"neo-Depression swing,\" and seem to have played locally for a while, though eventually Timberline hit the highway, recording their LP, The Great Timber Rush out in Hollywood, then landed a gig working as Dolly Parton's opening act for about a year, before breaking up in '78. Melody Duggan was also active in Denver's theater and rock music scenes, working at the fabled Family Dog rock club before getting \"real\" job as a high school drama teacher, where she was much beloved by students and parents alike, retiring around 2016, when she won a statewide award as theater educator of the year.\n\nFamily Lotus \"Rendezvous\" (Full Circle Records, 1979) (LP)\n\nFounded in 1968, this puckish, eclectic, hippie-grass twangband was a mainstay of Santa Fe, New Mexico's 'Seventies music scene. The main drivers of the band were multi-instrumentalist songwriters Jim Bowie and Jerry Faires, who are pictured together on the back, although they had a huge supporting cast behind them, which ebbed and flowed in various permutations over the years, including a series of reunion gigs. Among the folks on this album is future folk-scene superstar Eliza Gilkyson, playing a minor role in the backup chorus. All the songs on here are originals, three of them written by Jerry Faires, and all the rest by Jim Bowie, including two co-written with pianist Dennis Culver.\n\nThe Family Portrait \"At Home\" (Sierra Nevada Recording Studios, 1981-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jody Peterson)\n\nThe epitome of an local, amateur-hour bar-band, Reno, Nevada's Family Portrait was a later incarnation of a folk duo formed by brothers Jim and Jerry Estes, who were originally from the Midwest but later settled in Nevada and worked at venues such as the King's Inn and the urban-cowboy oriented Shy Clown casino. They were joined on this album by Jim Estes' wife Jackie and pickers Bill Van Dyke (banjo and fiddle) and Ernie Hagar (dobro and steel) on dobro and steel, adding some nice instrumental ooompf to the sometimes-iffy vocals. This set shows a heavy influence from the Emmylou Harris Hot Band, with covers of Rodney Crowell's \"Song For The Life\" and \"Even Cowgirls Get The Blues\" as well as Guy Clark's \"She Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" and Paul Siebel's old chestnut, \"Louise.\" Perhaps the campy highlight on the album is a lo-o-o-o-ong version of \"The Devil Went Down To Georgia,\" which might not be as kooky as Don Bowman's word-for-word recreation of \"Alice's Restaurant,\" but it's in the same ballpark. Also included as interstitial ditties are a few of Mason Williams' \"Them Poems,\" as odd and entertaining here as they were the first time around. The Estes all worked day jobs as schoolteachers in Reno and perhaps weren't the world's all-time greatest country musicians, but there's a sincerity and guilelessness here that adds authenticity and charm... Worth a spin if you're really rooting for the locals.\n\nThe Family Tradition \"When The Juke Box Was Just A Nickel\" (Michigan Nickel Company, 19--?) (LP)\n\nMore of a bluegrass thing, methinks, but I'm a sucker for these wooden-plank stock-art album covers... This group included Tom Campbell (guitar and lead vocals), Dan Nelson (banjo), Darvin Scutchfield, Jr. (bass) and Burl Smith (fiddle) who lived in small towns around South Bend, Indiana. The group was together for several years, though this seems to have been their only album.\n\nThe Family Tree \"Branch One\" (Identical Productions, 1973) (LP)\n\nThis looks like it was a family band, apparently originally from Minnesota, with Dad, three brothers, one sister and included some brass instruments, although they definitely played country material. The repertoire was almost strictly covers of contemporary early '70s popular hits, mostly country songs, but with some crossover into the Pop charts. Their albums seem to have mostly been souvenirs of -- and advertisements for -- their live shows... They were a working band that played paid gigs and gave a Nashville street address for their business contacts, and as far as I can tell, they had moved to Nashville full time and released several albums in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe Family Tree \"Branch Two\" (Identical Productions, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by The Family Tree & Stan Kesler)\n\nThe Family Tree \"Branching Out\" (Identical Productions, 1976)\n\n(Produced by The Family Tree & Dana Thomas)\n\nThis one includes \"hip\" covers of rock songs by Neil Young (\"Love Is A Rose\") and The Eagles (\"Lyin' Eyes\") as well as big country hits from 1975, such as Ronnie Milsap's \"Day Dreams About Night Things,\" \"Wasted Days And Wasted Nights,\" \"Rhinestone Cowboy\" and \"I'm Not Lisa.\" They still had the same Nashville street address as on the last album, so I guess they stayed in Music City for a long time, doing private shows and other gigs... Pretty impressive, really! (It's worth noting that there was also a Family Tree band in Shreveport, Louisiana around the same time, who are sometimes lumped together with these guys, although I'm pretty sure they were a different band. They are infamous for the so-bad-it's-good cult classic album, \"Somewhere In Your Heart\" which came out in 1975, but that band didn't feature horns and seem to have had a much more rock'n'roll orientation...)\n\nFamous Artists \"Country And Western Hits\" (Somerset Records, 196--?)\n\nA pretty groovy country exploitation album, with a couple of easily identifiable \"soundalike\" covers (\"Only Daddy That'll Walk The Line,\" \"What Made Milwaukee Famous\") backed by a bunch of super-generic filler material that appears to be original to this album, and which makes this record interesting for obscuro-obsessed twangfans. And, yeah, I know \"Famous Artists\" isn't really the name of the band -- it's clearly Top Artists as printed on the back cover! Anyway, sometimes these cheapo albums are cobbled together from various sources, but as far as I can tell this record showcases the same mopey, unidentified hound-dog singer on most tracks, although though a brighter-voiced Merle Haggard imitator pops up at the end, on the last two songs, \"Only Cheaters Can Win\" and \"Tear For A Friend\" -- it's conceivable it's the same vocalist, though I think those two songs probably came out on a single somewhere. (The evidence seems to point to the second singer being SoCal sideman Dennis Hromek, who is credited as the singer on an earlier Somerset LP that also includes one of these songs; as with many of these budget records, the material was recycled through multiple releases...) Anyway, though not as wild as some similar hippie-era twangsploitation albums, this disc does have its gems, with weird arrangements and kooky riffs on a tune or two; the \"big beat\" instrumental \"Nashville Detroit\" is a highlight, though songs like \"Plan Of A Lifetime\" and \"Please Don't Go\" are worth having on our radar as well.\n\nEddie Fannon & The Calvary Singers \"After Calvary\" (Jewel Records, 1972-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Reggie Wallace)\n\nA hardcore country gospel set from Kentucky bluegrasser Eddie Fannon, backed here by Bruce Andrews (banjo and lead guitar), Hiram Andrews (rhythm guitar), Tim Cook (rhythm guitar), Paul Harkins (bass). Mr. Fannon was originally from Harlan, Kentucky, but was living in the Cincinnati suburb of Norwood, Ohio at the time this album was recorded.\n\nEddie Fannon \"The Bluegrass Side Of Eddie Fannon\" (American Heritage Records, 1981)\n\n(Produced by The Family Tree & Dana Thomas)\n\nI'm not 100% sure it's all the same guy, but as near as I can figure Eddie Fannon recorded at least one (really great) secular country single, in sort of a Moe Bandy-ish vein, as well as several gospel albums after he got born-again in 1981, and this bluegrass LP, which was recorded at the Vetco Studios in Cincinnati. Somewhere along the way he also cut a Hank Williams tribute song, \"Hank's Gibson Guitar.\" Fannon was originally from ultra-rural Harlan County, Kentucky but later moved to Newport, Kentucky, a Cincinnati suburb on the other side of the state. He's backed on this album by Duke Bellamy on dobro, David Pinson (guitar), Evelyn Reed (bass), Jeff Roberts (banjo), Dusty Rose (fiddle) and Jeff Terflinger on fiddle and mandolin. (Roberts and Terflinger were both members of the Katie Laur band; the others seem to have been Cincinnati-area locals as well, including Dave Pinson, who played with Buddy Griffin, another Laur alumnus...)\n\nFrank Fara & Patty Parker \"Frank Fara/Patty Parker\" (Comstock Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jim Rooney & Paul Solomon)\n\nA split LP by the founders of the independent Comstock label, which was located in Shawnee, Kansas, outside of Kansas City. Mr. Fara was a former teen idol from Arizona who relocated to Midwest, and co-founded Comstock in the 'Seventies, providing a new venue for many of the region's off-the-radar country artists. Almost all the songs are Frank Fara originals, with the exceptions being a couple of cover songs sung by Ms. Parker, versions of Elvis Presley's old hit, \"I Want You, I Need You, I Love You\" and Ernest Tubb's \"Walking The Floor Over You.\" This may have been the first full LP on their label, though they'd already put out a bunch of singles, starting in 1976.\n\nThe Farewell Party Band \"Country Plus\" (BRW Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Gene Watson, Larry Booth & Russ Reeder)\n\nA shaggy band from Spring, Texas whose main claim to fame was backing honkytonk legend Gene Watson, which all things considered, ain't bad. Watson returned the favor by helming this \"solo\" album, which I think may be the only one they recorded. (Other than the ones with him, of course...) The band took its name from his 1979 hit single, \"Farewell Party,\" a Lawton Williams composition that became known as Watson's signature song. The group grew out of the Larry Booth Band, an early 'Seventies outfit from centered around Tony Booth's brother Larry, who recruited a bunch of guys from the Southern California country-rock scene, including several pickers who played in the house band at the Palomino nightclub. In addition to Larry Booth on bass, the band included Doug Boggs on drums, Norm Cass (guitar), Joe Eddie Gough (piano), Tiny Olson (steel guitar), and Daniel T. Rainwater (guitar). This album includes several originals, such as \"Beg For It\" by Tiny Olson, \"610 Bypass\" by Daniel T. Rainwater, and \"Sad Songs\" by Doug Boggs.\n\nFargo \"I See It Now\" (RCA Victor, 1969) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Martin Cooper)\n\nDespite the rural-sounding band name (and the presence of country-rock pioneer Rick Cunha) this is not actually a very twangy album... Nor was the group from North Dakota! A short-lived psychedelic rock band from Salt Lake City(!), Fargo was more or less made up of the songwriting duo of Tony Decker and Dean Wilden, a couple of twenty-one year olds who had a major case of Brit-ophilia, sounding quite a bit like The Hollies, The Moody Blues and, on a song called \"A Castle In Wales,\" a lot like a Ringo Starr solo record. Decker and Wilden had been playing gigs in Junction City, Colorado but made the trek out to Los Angeles to record their big album under the auspices of Al Casey and some undetermined subset of Wrecking Crew-adjacent studio musicians, who pumped out some not-too-generic pop-psych arrangements in service to Fargo's groovy, evocative lyrics. I actually think this is a pretty good record, it's just not that country sounding. But if you like genuine, old-fashioned twee psychedelia, you might wanna check this one out. [Worth noting: producer Martin (Marty) Cooper did go on to record some groovy country-rock stuff under his own name, later on in the 1970s.]\n\nStan Farlow \"Hot Wheels\" (Checker Records, 1970) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Gary S. Paxton)\n\nSinger Stan Farlow (1941-2013) was kind of an odd artist. As you can hear on this album's title track -- first issued as a single -- he was a shameless Johnny Cash imitator; indeed, recording under the name \"Johnny Doe,\" Farlow recorded several albums that were specifically marketed as Cash soundalike sessions. Here, he's still got the whole Delta baritone sound going on, but the music loosens up a bit, and the liner notes pitch him as a Bakersfield Sound artist, with backing from Dennis Payne and Kenny Johnson of the California Poppy Pickers. The music is an odd amalgam of Cash-ian chunka-chunka and gritty, Haggard-style twang. (Farlow knew Haggard from his Bakersfield days, and there's a hefty dose of Hag's sound in him as well...) This album's title track, \"Hot Wheels,\" is a macabre trucker tune that ends with the Devil taking the singer's soul, and there's also a proto-outlaw edge to some of the other tracks, notably on \"Big City Hooker,\" a surprisingly raw song condemning a country girl for turning into a prostitute... I guess things never quite clicked for Farlow as a solo star -- he got religion in the '70s and backed out of the country bar-band scene. In later years he became an amateur bluegrass musician, and pretty much left his country years behind him.\n\nStan Farlow \"He Sounds Like Johnny Cash\" (Checker Records, 1970) (LP)\n\nThe Alshire label put out, like, a bazillion Cash-soundalike albums by Stan Farlow, recording under his Johnny Doe pseudonym... So, no surprise that Chess went down that route as well, probably just to fulfill some kind of contractual obligation; indeed this might just be a reissue of one of the Alshire albums. I would list all the Doe albums as well, but they're just so darn many of them, and they overlap in weird ways. This should be enough to satisfy your morbid curiosity.\n\nStan Farlow \"Farlow One\" (Vintage Records, 197--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Glenn Clarke & Art Snider)\n\n(Stephen And) The Farm Band \"Up In Your Thing\" (Farm Records, 1973) (LP)\n\nThe Farm Band \"On The Rim Of The Nashville Basin\" (Farm Records, 1975) (LP)\n\nReal-deal hippie sh*t. This fabled jam-band album came out of The Farm, which, if you haven't heard of it, is probably the most famous American hippie commune, founded in the early 1970s by Stephen Gaskin and a caravan of California emigres who headed East and bought a ton of land in Lewis County, Tennessee, settling in for the long haul. The Farm has remained in operation, in various permutations, over the decades, though in its longhaired heyday, the community spawned its own band, which recorded numerous singles and LPs. This might be more rock-oriented than most of the stuff here, but hey, it was the 'Seventies, and there was a little bit of twang in the air... along with a whole lot of pot smoke.\n\nThe Farm Family \"Five Bushels Closer To My Heart\" (Dupont, 1985) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dwight Marcus)\n\nIn a survey of ultra-obscure country stuff, you figure you're gonna get a ringer or two... For example, check out this industrial album of agriculturally-themed novelty songs, created to promote \"the proven record\" of the DuPont corporation's Benlate fungicide. There are goofy tunes such as \"Irrigation Irritations,\" \"Louisiana Losses,\" \"Five Bushels Closer To My Heart,\" and (I'm not making this up) \"Seedy Seeds.\" Although a coalition of enraged organic gardeners organized bonfire parties to destroy this disc, a few copies remain and are played in secret by the agribiz big boys during private parties held to celebrate the annual renewal of the federal farming subsidies. Funny stuff.\n\nJohn Faron \"Goin' Up To Country\" (Windi Records, 1972-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Rolf Erickson, John Lahmer & Gary Young)\n\nApparently this was the only album by an otherwise-obscure country singer who had kicked around Los Angeles in the early 1970s. The guiding force behind this album may have been Manhattan Beach music producer Gary Young, an Oklahoma transplant who tried his luck starting a rock band, and later a record label. Windi Records put out a short string of singles, as well as a few LPs, and later transmuted into something called Nova Sol Records, which involved some of the same people... This hard-to-find album includes one song credited to Gary Young, \"Kissin' My Memories,\" and two John Faron originals, \"It Keeps Me From The Cold\" and \"Your Love Sets Me Free,\" along with country oldies from folks like Roy Rogers and Hank Williams, and more contemporary material from John Denver (\"Country Roads\"), Kris Kristofferson (\"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\") and an intriguing cover of an early Red Steagall song, \"In A Jetway In Dallas,\" which was on Steagall's debut album early in 1972. John Faron was backed by Jack Armstrong (bass), Mike Brown (dobro), Jim Lenn (drums), Art Sanchez (steel guitar), Joe Webber (keyboards), and John Wilson (guitar and backing vocals), guys who seemed to have been kicking around the margins of the Los Angeles rock scene... Steel player Art Sanchez was an interesting figure, who worked on a few other projects related to the Windi Records label, but also was in a series of Chicano rock bands from East LA, including The Brew, and a later group called Yaqui, which both cut full LPs. John Faron, alas, remains a mystery -- I couldn't find any mention of him as part of LA's country scene, and he had a fairly common name, so I couldn't track down obituary or other information about him online.\n\nCandy Farr \"Make My Heart\" (Shostar Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Candy Farr & Jim Reynolds)\n\nThough born in Texas, country singer Candy Farr started performing regularly after he moved to Minnesota... He was apparently a protege of Marty Robbins, as well as a huge Elvis Presley fan. This album features all original material... Don't know much more about it than that, though.\n\nTony Farr \"Plays The Farr Out Of It\" (Farview Records, 1973) (LP)\n\nSteel guitar player Tony Farr was a veteran of the Twin Cities country scene, playing at local Minnesota venues such as the Flame Cafe and regionally at country fair gigs like the Cheyenne Days festival in the late 1960s. In the early '70s he moved to Nashville, where he recorded these two albums, but for a variety of reasons things never quite clicked for him in Music City. Of note on these albums is guitarist Gregg Galbraith, a session picker who toured with Nashville stars such as Bill Anderson and Gene Watson, playing here in a more laid-back instrumental mode.\n\nTony Farr \"Warm And Easy\" (Farview Records, 1974-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Gene Lawson)\n\nDan And Berde Farris \"Honky Tonk Mother And Dad\" (Far-Dell Records, 197-?)\n\nLiterally a mom'n'pop record, this disc spotlights the West Coast husband-wife duo of Dan and Berde Farris, who sing fun latter-day heartsongs and honkytonk tunes, in much the same style as other country couples such as Rose Lee & Joe Maphis, or Johnny and Jonie Mosby. It's nice stuff -- a style I really like and they do it pretty well... plus a lot of the songs are Farris originals. The Farrises were both from California -- she was born in Merced but grew up in Washington state -- and they were living in Rialto, CA (near Riverside) when they made this album -- later they moved to Hobbs, New Mexico, where they settled down for good. They seem to have started out in the orbit of Starday Records, although their singles and LPs were released under their own imprint. This disc was released at least twice, once with a hand-glued cover, and the second time with more professional artwork (and two extra songs.) The catalog number (FRLP-102) indicated that this was the second album they put out... I'd love to hear the first one, too!\n\nThe Fascinators \"Keep On Hummin' \" (Mega Sound Records, 1977) (LP)\n\nAn average, slightly plodding, pleasantly unpretentious, longhaired indie twang band from North Carolina. These folks probably did some weddings-parties-anything work, but as far as I know, this was their only album... Pinetops, North Carolina native Joe Webb was the group's lead singer, along with Ann Marie Lewis, who also managed the band. Indeed, this was something of a family group: Ann Marie's son Glenn Lewis was the Fascinators' drummer, and the lead guitarist was her son-in-law Rick Lewis (who was also working in comedian Cletus Maggard's band at the time...) The group was rounded out by bass player Ronald Fowler and pianist Jerry Wilder... They make an earnest go of it, but through a combination perhaps of limited experience and lackadaisical production, this is a less-than-electrifying album -- not bad, but a little on the soft side, with some iffy vocals, and fairly muffled sound. The repertoire was mostly cover tunes, though a fairly eclectic selection, with a couple by Kris Kristofferson, one from Chip Taylor, and a nice version of Bob McDill's \"The Door Is Always Open,\" with an album highlight being their cover of Kent Robbins' \"(I'm A) Stand By My Woman Man,\" an odd answer-song that was previously recorded by Ronnie Milsap. There's one song composed by singer Joe Webb, \"I've Got Hank's Love Sick Blues,\" which kicks off Side Two, though I think that's the only original material on here.\n\nFast Flying Vestibule \"Union Station\" (Rolling Donut Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Bergman)\n\nA cheerfully upbeat folkie stringband who appear to have been from Washington, DC. Named after a once-famous passenger train that ran from Ohio to New York, these guys had kind of a Red Clay Ramblers vibe, combining clattersome old-time stringband music (showing deep Celtic roots) along with sentimental country oldies, gospel and a bit of western swing. The group included Alan Oresky on fiddle and mandolin, Doug Pell (lead guitar), Joe Stork (bass), Jesse Winch (banjo, guitar and bodhran) and Terry Winch (banjo and accordion). Fans of the Ramblers, John McCutcheon, Norman and Nancy Blake, et.al., might dig these guys as well.\n\nFat City \"Reincarnation\" (ABC Records, 1969) (LP)\n\nAn early album from Bill and Taffy Danoff, Washington, DC folkies who championed Emmylou Harris back in her folksinger days, and who later formed the unctuous, chart-topping Starland Vocal Band, best known for the 'Seventies smash \"Afternoon Delight.\" Bill and Taffy were also tight with John Denver and co-wrote \"Take Me Home, Country Roads,\" one of the most widely-recorded country-pop songs of the decade. These Fat City albums date back to their DC coffeehouse days and are appropriately eclectic and idiosyncratic... definitely worth a spin if you're on the hunt for oddball twang.\n\nFat City \"Welcome To Fat City\" (Paramount Records, 1971) (LP)\n\nFat City Jug Band \"The Fat City Jug Band\" (Custom Fidelity Records, 1969) (LP)\n\nJug bandsters from Iowa City, Iowa, covering hip tunes that fit in with the work of folks such as David Bromberg, Jim Kweskin, Maria Muldaur and John Sebastian. According to an ad in the Daily Iowan when this came out, the band consisted of John Bean, Ron Hillis, Rick Smith, and Keith Dempster. Dempster (1932-2013) was owner of a music venue called The Mill, which opened as a coffee bar and folk club in 1962, then expanded into a full-fledged restaurant after a fire damaged its original location. According to the newspaper ad, the Mill was one of a handful of local businesses where you could purchase this album. For several decades the Mill was a keystone of the Midwestern roots music scene; the Dempster family ran it until 2003, then after they retired it was reopened under new management. I'm not sure when the Fat City Jug Band first formed, but I think they were probably the same guys who were listed playing a gig at a community festival way over in Neenah, Wisconsin in the summer of 1965. Anyone know how long this band stayed together, or if its members went on to other groups?\n\nFather And Son \"All Originals\" (Renee Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bud Comte)\n\nThis father-son duo was comprised of songwriter Tommy Johnson and multi-instrumentalist Jonny Johnson of Columbus, Nebraska -- Jonny played guitar, fiddle, banjo and mandolin, who also wrote two of the songs on this album... No release date on the disc, but I'm guessing mid- to late-'80s. The songs are all Tommy Johnson originals, issued under the Lari-Jon publishing imprint.\n\nDoyle Faubus \"Sentimental Country\" (19--?) (LP)\n\nThis indie album was written and recorded by songwriter Doyle Faubus, the brother of longtime Arkansas governor Orval Faubus, a figure most remembered for his refusal to integrate the schools in Little Rock, despite a Federal order to do so in the 1950s. Doyle Faubus had a real commitment to his music, performing locally and regionally for several decades, including a gig at the \"Lil' Ol' Opry\" that ran at least as late as 2011. He wrote all the songs on this album, though sadly I have no info on the musicians backing him.\n\nJim Fautheree \"Heaven Is Only Knee High\" (Lodema Records, 1979-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by John Wagner)\n\nA swell set of straightforward country gospel by hotshot picker Jimmy Lee Fautheree, ex-partner of \"Country\" Johnny Mathis, who helped him record this album. In the 1950s they were known as the fiery hillbilly duo of Jimmy & Johnny, an almost-rock duo that was in the orbit of songwriter Wayne P. Walker, and his patron, country chart-topper Webb Pierce. After their act broke up, they each did some solo work, with Fautheree recording under the name \"Jimmy Lee,\" and Mathis recording a series of excellent gospel records, with plenty of twang. Mathis contributes over half the songs on here, alongside classics by Fanny Crosby and Stuart Hamblen, and one by Tracy Dartt, a California gospel artist who had moved to Oklahoma earlier in the decade. Fautheree was living in Farmington, New Mexico when he cut this set; twenty-five years later he was brought out of retirement again to record an album for super-picker Deke Dickerson's Ecco-Fonic label. Early recordings by Jimmy & Johnny have been gathered on an ace bunny killer Bear Family collection, as well as a CD's worth of Jimmy Lee's solo stuff.\n\nDarren Fay & Jeff Wise \"Redneck Rock\" (Charter Records, 1975) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ellis Miller)\n\nJug-bandy, mostly acoustic hippie twang from the Pacific Northwest... The album title is definitely misleading, since the songs are packed with druggie references, and it sure ain't much of a rock record. Indeed, there's some pretty dorky, sorta-folkie stuff on here, along with some fairly fun twangtunes. Darren Fay and Jeff Wise were pals from Southern California who hoofed it up to Vancouver, Washington to party down and cut a record at Ripcord Studios, with owner-engineer Gene Breeden adding electric guitar and pedal steel to a track or two, his son Danny Breeden on drums, Ellis Miller on bass, and of course, Fay and Wise strummin' guitars and singin' up a storm. There's also some guy named Mark who adds fiddle, flute, or saxophone -- as well as vocals -- to all but two tracks, and you can totally just hear those two guitar dudes, being all, \"Oh, man, dude! You know we would put your name on the cover, too, just... like, y'know... you're not on those two tracks!\" And Mark was all, \"Well, can't we just come up with a band name?\" Not like he's pissed, or anything. Anyway, these two (or is it three?) longhaired guys were just about as 1975 as you could get... Dig those shirts, dig that chest hair, and how do you stay that thin?? The dudes returned home, with Jeff Wise being considered an \"unofficial mayor\" of his hometown of Harbison Caynon, a rural community outside of San Diego where he grew up... As far as I know, this was their only album. It's mostly pretty groovy, with highlights including \"Rainy Day Rag,\" \"413,\" \"Yodle Odle Lady\" and \"Country Catfish\" though it must be admitted a couple of tracks are truly dreadful, in a naive, zonked-out hippie kinda way. And of course, that's why many of you will want to check this one out!\n\nJ.D. Feelgood & The Nashville All-Stars \"Aerobics Country Style\" (Looking Good Records, 1982) (cassette)\n\nA country aerobics set from a business with an address in Providence, Rhode Island... Included are aerobic-friendly covers of \"On The Road Again,\" \"Great Balls Of Fire,\" \"Take This Job And Shove It,\" \"Red Neckin' Love Makin' Night\" and (most surprisingly!) Bill Phillips' late-career hit, \"Fadin' In, Fadin' Out.\" There's a pretty good chance this was a cassette-only release... But it also came with a workout poster! Dunno who the actual musicians were, but if you already own Irlene Mandrell's \"Texersize\" album, pick this one up and you'll have a collection!\n\nWayne Fehr \"Mood Country\" (Sunshine Records, 197--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ness Michaels & John Hildebrand)\n\nWayne Fehr \"Buckskin And Satin\" (Sunshine Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ron Halldorson & John Hildebrand)\n\nAn album's worth of all-original country stuff, recorded in Winnipeg, Canada by a twenty-eight year old songwriter... The liner notes include a testimonial from Jim Zeck, the program director of country station CKLQ, in Brandon, Manitoba. No info, alas, about Fehr's backing musicians...\n\nClint Felkner \"Caravan Records Presents Clint Felkner\" (Caravan Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dave Austin, Fritz Brading & Chuck Carson)\n\nThe first and I believe only album by a lanky, muttonchopped Midwestern baritone named Clint Felkner... Side One is all gospel, while Side Two spotlights covers of secular country hits such as \"BJ The DJ,\" \"He'll Have To Go,\" and Hank Williams' \"Lovesick Blues.\" The album ends with a pair of originals, \"She Loves Me When It Matters\" and \"House Husband's Lament,\" a feminist-era, battle-of-the-sexes novelty number co-written a guy named Dennis Standish. This set was recorded at a studio in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and while the backing seems fairly perfunctory, there's definitely a DIY charm... No info on the backing musicians, alas. Felkner's bio remains pretty obscure: a news story mentions him singing at a Minnesota funeral in 2013; around the same time he taped an interview with something called \"Old Men Stories,\" which was apparently appended to a venue called the Kentucky Opry, in Draffenberg, KY, though I'm not sure where Felkner himself was from.\n\nDick Feller - see artist discography\n\nDerrell Felts \"Favorites From The Derrell Felts Television Show\" (Felts Enterprises, 1974) (LP)\n\nBest known as a one-and-a-half-hit wonder of the rockabilly era, Derrel Felts recorded the songs \"Playmates\" and \"Lookie, Lookie, Lookie\" in the late 1950s, and for a while was in the orbit of promoter/producer Norman Petty, who surreptitiously hooked Felts up with legendary rockers The Crickets, not long after Buddy Holly passed away. Felts recorded a couple of singles, then receded into obscurity as the '60s unfolded. Like many former rockabilly firebrands, Felts gravitated towards mainstream country, and by the early 'Seventies he was the host of The Derrell Felts Television Show, a program based in Dallas, Texas that beamed out over much of the Panhandle and Southwest. This album is an interesting set of covers and originals with songs including the 1974 single, \"Calling Johnny Rodriguez,\" \"He Ain't Country\" and \"I Can Feel The Leavin' Coming On\" as well as covers of Bill Anderson, Conway Twitty and Porter Wagoner. (Note: as far as I know, this guy was no direct relation to country star Narvel Felts...)\n\nKenny Felts \"Sings Tribute To Red Foley\" (Jewel Records, 1970-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Rusty York)\n\nA country gospel set sung in homage to Red Foley... All but three of the songs were originally from Foley's extensive back catalog, with the exceptions being \"Downward Road Of Sin,\" written by guitarist Dennis Hensley, Oral C. Roberts' \"The Touch Of Heaven\" and a Dottie Rambo tune called \"The Next Step You Take.\" Mr. Felts hailed from Corbin, Kentucky and traveled to Cincinnati to record this at the Jewel Records studio, with help from Chester Barnett on bass, Junior Bennett (violin), Junior Boyer (steel guitar), Dennis Hensley (guitar), Gene Lawson (drums) and pianist Denny Rice. Kenny Felts also cut a few gospel singles in the early 'Sixties, though folks in the know place this disc as having come out around 1970.\n\nFence Walker \"Feels Right\" (Perdue Recording, Inc, 1987) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dean Elliott & Jim Perdue)\n\nA modestly accomplished band from Amarillo, Texas who made this album just as the alt-country \"Americana\" scene was gathering steam, though they seem to have been totally outside the popular wave of college-rock twang... I think their real roots were in rock'n'roll, since they start each side of this LP out with more rock-oriented numbers -- the surf-garage tinged \"Feels Right\" and the bar-band boogie of \"Dear John\" -- but then they devote themselves to twang, though they don't seem to be as comfortable with country, and it sounds a little awkward. The vocals are also iffy -- if you've heard folks like Dusty Chaps or Chuck Wagon & The Wheels, then you'll know what territory I'm talking about... I wouldn't say these guys were as distinctive as those better-known bands, but it's a similar vibe. Possibly the most interesting tracks are a couple of songs about their experiences as an obscuro-band, Archie Young's rambling \"Gone Again,\" and the more rockin' \"Dream And Watch It Grow,\" which kind of reminds me of Seattle's fabled Young Fresh Fellows... These guys probably could have made a better rock record than twang, but it was nice of them to give the country thing a try. Apparently the band continued to jam together through the early '00s, though it looks like this was their only album.\n\nElaine Fender & Missouri Rain \"Come On Home\" (History Records, 1981-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Brad Edwards)\n\nA singer and keyboardist, Elaine Fender played in a series of local Missouri bands, including a stint in Stan Hitchcock's short-lived opry, and later collaborations with other veterans of the Hitchcock show, notably multi-instrumentalist Larry Smith, who she later married. This solo album was made with bandleader Eddie Pangborn, who also worked in a variety of Ozark \"opry\" venues and formed his own band, Missouri Rain, in the mid-1970s. The group made two albums of its own before teaming up with Fender for this last hurrah, with Elaine Fender on keyboards and lead vocals, drummer Jerry Dooley, Jerry Ingle (also on drums), Eddie Pangborn (bass), and multi-instrumentalist Larry Smith on banjo, fiddle, guitar and mandolin. This album is self-consciously commercially-oriented, with Fender showing her vocal chops on covers of contemporary pop/country hits, and the boys in the band trying to craft rural power ballads. It's an uneven effort, though, as the male lead vocals (and the original songs) are a bit strained. Still, it's local as all get-out and fills in a few gaps in the Ozarks indie-twang scene. Ms. Fender also recorded with the group Jimmy Carter & Dallas County Green, on their 1977 album, Summer Brings The Sunshine, and on Stan Hitchcock's 1979 opry album, along with Larry Smith and others.\n\nThe Fenders \"Introducing The Fenders\" (Indian Arts of America, 1964-?) (LP)\n\nNot to be confused with any number of guitar rockers that named themselves after their Stratocasters, this was a Native American country band, first formed back in the late 1950s. Led by singer Ervin Becenti, the original Fenders were from Crownpoint, New Mexico, located in the Navajo Nation near Gallup, NM. They played together throughout the 1960s, recording at least four albums of classic honkytonk music, often given unique cultural tweaks that reflected their local tribal culture. According to ethnomusicologist Kristina Jacobsen, The Fenders was one of the earliest \"chapterhouse bands,\" known for their rough-edged authenticity and unpolished \"rez\" sound, a style that was emulated by other regional bands for decades to come. As with many of these bands, the Fenders albums are exceedingly elusive -- I've only seen this one and the second pictured on the back cover of their third album, Fenders On Steel, as well as at least one later album from 1969, also listed here. The group was managed by a guy named Clyde Duncan, an African-American who worked at the Santa Fe Indian School, who put his address in Thoreau, NM on their albums and helped the band find gigs in the area. The group's legacy is rather complicated: years after the original Fenders disbanded, another group with no direct connection was formed, calling itself Fenders II; in turn that band split in half, with one set of musicians still calling themselves Fenders II and the other taking the name Fenders On Steel (named after the original band's third album). The original band's lineup included lead singer Ervin Becenti, Johnny Emerson, Jr., Edward Gruber, Jr., Rubin Mason and Tom Pete, though sadly I can't tell you who payed which instruments. They were heavy into classic hard country -- Webb Pierce, Jimmie Rodgers, Hank Williams, as well as younger artists such as Johnny Horton and the Bakersfield Sound of Buck Owens and his gang. As noted in Ms. Jacobsen's research, the Fenders and other chapterhouse bands often gave eccentric tweaks to classics country songs, substituting tribal words, changing melodic notes, singing in an \"Indian accent,\" and the stylistic tics of the early bands of the 1950s and '60s became the foundation of their kind of country music, emulated by generations of bands to come.\n\nThe Fenders \"The Fenders -- Second Time Around\" (1966-?) (LP)\n\nWith the same lineup intact, The Fenders dig deeper into the classic country canon, covering songs by Johnny Cash (\"Folsom Prison Blues\"), The Carter Family (\"Wildwood Flower\"), Webb Pierce (\"I'm Walking The Dog\"), Buck Owens (\"Love's Gonna Live Here\") and perhaps most importantly, the late Johnny Horton, whose \"Honky Tonk Hardwood Floor\" was a favorite at tribal \"stomps,\" or live music shows. The World Cat website guesstimates a release date of 1966 on this one, which might be correct, although if they were inspired by Johnny Cash's At Folsom Prison album to cover that particular song, it would have been more like 1968 or after...\n\nThe Fenders \"On Steel\" (1968-?) (LP)\n\nAs implied by the album title, the group broadened its sound with the inclusion of steel player Bob Robertson, as well as a new drummer, Martin House. The rest of the lineup included Ervin Becenti, Johnny Emerson, Jr., Edward Gruber, Jr., Rubin Mason, and Tom Pete, with Becenti credited as the vocalist on Side One, and Mr. Emerson on Side Two. They dig even deeper into the West Coast/Bakersfield Sound, with songs by Merle Haggard, Buck Owens, Wynn Stewart and others, including a version of Charlie Walker's \"Pick Me Up On Your Way Down\" and another Johnny Horton oldie, \"I Got A Hole In My Pirogue,\" adapted here into \"I Got A Hold In My Pay Roll.\" The band's manager, Clyde Duncan, provides his home address in Thoreau, NM on the back cover, though the band itself lived on tribal lands nearby.\n\nThe Fenders \"Once More Around\" (1969) (LP)\n\nThe cover of this album was pictured inside the text of Kristina Jacobsen's highly informative essay, \"Rita(hhh): Placemaking And Country Music On The Navajo Nation,\" with a release date of 1969. Haven't seen it listed elsewhere, and I'm not sure how many other albums the Fenders released, as their music seems to be generally off the radar in the outside world.\n\nFernando Marvelous & Half Nelson \"What Happened To The Girls (That Willio And Hoolie Knew)\" (NLT Records, 1987-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by B. Fischer & G. D. Stinson)\n\nA lampoon of the 1980s super-duo of Julio Iglesias and Willie Nelson, whose brief popularity made them a ripe target at the time, though present-day listeners may be hard-pressed to get the joke. Songs include the title track, which was a parody of their 1984 single, \"To All The Girls I've Loved Before,\" and \"The Legend Of Half And Fernando,\" though not all the tracks are that on-the-nose. Deduct a few cleverness points for the fact that the \"Half Nelson\" pun had already been used when Willie himself used it as the title of the 1985 duets collection that anthologized the \"Girls\" song. Also maybe dock a few more, since \"Fernando Marvelous\" was a Billy Crystal reference.\n\nThe Fiddlin' Ferch Family \"Album Number One\" (Rosebud Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Rick Barrett)\n\nOh, come on... how could I resist? These fresh-faced folks were from microscopic Melstone, Montana, in the eastern end of the state, just north of Billings. It turns out, though, that the super-cute band name was a little bit of a bait-and-switch, as it's only the dad, Will Ferch, who played the fiddle, while the rest of the group plays fairly standard stringband accompaniment. The mom, Carole Ferch strums guitar, twelve-year old daughter Kimberly chimes in on the piano, and nine-year old Timothy picks the mandolin; they are joined on bass by Brett Barrett, who seems to have been the son of the guy who recorded the album. The set list is pretty bluegrassy, with a little gospel and western swing in the mix. According to Tim Ferch's online profile page, the group played local jam sessions and music festivals; before making this record Will Ferch had taken part in several fiddling competitions.\n\nThe Fiddlin' Ferch Family \"Album Number Two: The Wednesday Night Waltz\" (Music City Records, 1977-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Steve Forbis)\n\nI'm not sure of the dates on either of these albums, but the first seems to be from the early 'Seventies and this one from later in the decade. Here, the liner notes mention a couple of state fiddling championships, in 1974 and 1976, so I'd guess this came out in early '77... This was a studio album, recorded in Helena, Montana.\n\nBonnie Ferguson \"I'll Be There\" (Ovation Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dick Schory)\n\nSinger Cheryl (\"Bonnie\") Ferguson grew up in the Chicago surburb of Markham, Illinois as part of a musically-inclined family. She started performing in public as part of a family band that included seven(!) of her siblings, but broke out as a solo performer after winning a talent contest sponsored by the Coca-Cola company. By the time she graduated from high school in 1969, Bonnie Ferguson was a seasoned artist, touring regionally to Wisconsin, Indiana and throughout Illinois. She also landed slots on the local WGN Barn Dance TV show and later, around 1974, on the Porter Brothers TV Show. In Chicago she was perhaps best known for her industrial work, recording commercials for Schlitz beer and the Chicago Tribune newspaper. She may have recorded a single or two in her teens, as well as a string of singles for the Metro Country label, circa 1971-72, eventually leading to this album for the insurgent indie Ovation Records. Ms. Ferguson was pitched as a dual-genre country and AOR artist, and the ornate arrangements on this disc are notably short of twangy instruments such as fiddles or pedal steel. As with many other early signings to the Ovation label, her career may have been overshadowed by the runaway success of the Kendalls, who ate up most Ovation's promotional power. This appears to have been her only full album, and I'm not sure where she went from here, though she may have done some work in the film industry as well.\n\nThe Ferguson Family \"Fair And Tender Ladies, And Gentlemen\" (American Artists, 19--?) (LP)\n\nOzarks fiddler Woodrow Ferguson and his daughters -- Ann, Celia and Sandra - form the core of this old-timey stringband, which was based in their hometown of Warsaw, Missouri. Several other local and regional pickers pitch in, perhaps most notably Arkansas fiddler Donald \"Cotton\" Combs, who recorded an album of his own, along with guitarists Loy and Euna Sisemore, who also play on this album. Many of these musicians performed regularly at the Silver Dollar City amusement park near Branson City. Not sure when this disc came out; it looks like it might have been an early 'Eighties release.\n\nGary Ferguson \"Think For Yourself\" (American Music Heritage Corporation, 19--?) (LP)\n\nBorn in Canada, but raised in Montana, Gary Ferguson cut a few singles in the '60s, including the song \"There Is No Answer,\" originally recorded in 1966 and included here along with four other Ferguson songs... The remainder of the record is basically honkytonk standards, stuff by Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Harlan Howard and Kris Kristofferson. This album was recorded at the AMHC label in Caldwell, Idaho, though unfortunately the liner notes don't include any info on who was backing him up.\n\nJim Ferguson \"Slow Down The Pace\" (Jim An I Records, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Sharon K. Doherty & Jim Ferguson)\n\nUltra-indie DIY honkytonk country from Garden Grove, California (in Orange County, near Anaheim...) Ferguson wasn't the world's greatest singer, nor was this the world's greatest band, but he gets major points for taking it seriously, for writing good songs and for being more than a decade ahead of the crowd, recording the kind of rough-edged amateur twang that the \"Americana\" scene would become known for in the 1990s. There are several really good songs on here, including \"Cold Woman\" and \"The More I Try,\" all sung with an admirable amount of twang. Ferguson also had a track placed on the Johnny Burger-produced \"COWBOY COUNTRY DOZEN\" compilation... Anyone out there know if he recorded anything else, or was this it?\n\nRoy Ferguson & The Royals \"Stop Me\" (Galena Records, 196-?) (LP)\n\nHotshot picker Roy Ferguson (1936-2015) played guitar for western swing bandleader Johnny Lee Wills for over twenty years, and also fronted his own group, Roy Ferguson and The Royals, which often backed big-name country stars on tour through Oklahoma. This was probably his first solo album, though he also recorded several singles, including a few on the Galena label, circa 1964-65. Other than a cover of \"Make The World Go Away,\" all of the songs on here are credited to \"Ferguson & Duncan,\" including tunes like \"It Was A Lonely Night,\" \"Gonna Start All Over,\" \"Country Ago Go\" and \"Stop Me.\" (I don't know if this was singer Tommy Duncan we're talking about -- it's possible, since he was around until 1967, although I don't think he was particularly known for his songwriting. Still, could be, given the Wills connections.) Unfortunately, there are no producer or musician credits, though my guess is these were local Oklahomans backing him, or other members of the Wills band.\n\nRoy Ferguson & Candy Noe \"Roy Ferguson & Candy Noe\" (Benson Sound, 19--) (LP)\n\nThe husband-wife duo of Candy Noe and Roy Ferguson met in the 1960s when they were working in the Tulsa music scene. Singer Candy Noe originally came from Ohio, where as a teen she sang in the Marion Jamboree -- moving to Tulsa, she landed a job on country deejay Billy Parker's local TV show. Noe and Ferguson met in '65, got married in '66, released an album together, and opened Roy & Candy's music store in the 1970s, which for three decades was a fixture of the Tulsa, Oklahoma arts scene. The Fergusons played with the Wills band until 1984, when Johnny Lee Wills died, and continued to perform locally right up until Roy passed away in 2015. They both released an undetermined number of singles under their own names, but as far as I know, this was their only LP as a duo. Candy Noe also released a solo album in the late 'Seventies, and Roy Ferguson played guitar on a bunch of albums over the years, mostly with other local artists.\n\nTroy Ferguson & Sue Smith \"O'Lunney's Presents...\" (O'Lunney's Country Music City, 1975-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Steve Karliski, Dave Halbert & Art Polhemus)\n\nA souvenir of O'Lunney's, a New York City bar that went country in 1973, with the husband-wife team of Troy Ferguson and Sue Smith quickly becoming a long-term house band over the next few years... They are joined here by son Mark Ferguson on bass, Tommy Higgins (drums), and Butch Natale (steel guitar). Also of note is album producer Steve Karliski, who was a successful pop and country songwriter in the early 'Seventies, perhaps most notably writing the hit \"Yes, Mr. Peters\" -- he contributes two songs here, \"His And Hers\" and \"That's How It Always Happens In A Song.\" Other originals include \"The Band Backed Me Up (While I Cried)\" and \"You Are The One,\" complimented by a few classics (\"Crazy,\" \"Silver Threads And Golden Needles,\" Merle Haggard's \"Sing Me Back Home,\" and \"I Don't Love You Anymore,\" which had recently been a minor hit for Charlie Louvin, and Kris Kristofferson's \"Why Me Lord.\") Nice, eclectic set!\n\nRuss Fernlund & The Redwood Stage \"Many Miles From Nowhere\" (1985) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Russ Fernlund)\n\nA memento of one of Northern California's many long-lost longhair bands... In the late 1970s, songwriter Russ Fernlund was doing a solo gig in Big Sur, eventually giving that up so he could try his luck in Los Angeles. Like Nashville, LA can be a tough nut to crack, and after knocking his head against that particular wall, Fernlund moved back up North, this time to the sleepy but scenic town of Mendocino. Redwood Stage was a band he led from 1979 on, cutting this album in '85 to document their work. To be honest, I found his vocals a little lethargic, but he grew on me... There's definitely a nice reservoir of original twangtunes on here, and moments that remind me (a lot) of Chip Taylor and Dick Feller, with maybe a smidge of Larry Hosford in there as well... The songs didn't really grab me musically, but this disc is packed with NorCal hippiebilly history, particularly on songs like \"Big Sur River,\" \"California Country,\" \"Moonshinin',\" and \"Okie On Rollerskates.\" Definitely worth a spin if you can track a copy down.\n\nRuss Fernlund \"...And Just Wasting Time\" (2013)\n\nBen Ferrell \"Talkin' 'Bout Kentucky\" (Caravelle Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Tony Migliore & Jim Matthews)\n\nAlthough he sang about the bluegrass state, songwriter Ben Ferrell seems to have pitched his tent out in California, or at least he hooked up with the Hollywood-based Caravelle label, which bankrolled this disc. All the songs are originals, except for a version of Stephen Foster's \"Old Kentucky Home,\" and the backup band includes a lot of top Nashville talent, folks like Harold Bradley, Pete Drake, Lloyd Green, Johnny Gimble, Charlie McCoy and Pete Wade... and they definitely get pretty funky on this album! I mean that literally. The whole \"Area 615\" crew really let their hair down here, playing some wicked funk and almost acid-rock-like riffs on some of these songs. But it is for sure also twangy and country as well. Pretty frickin' cool, really. Perhaps even a \"lost 'Seventies gem. Apparently this was re-released in Australia under the same title, and with the same track sequence. By the early 'Eighties, Ferrell cut his hair and got religion... He still made records, including several in the CD era, but they were part of the \"worship music\" scene, as he calls it. He also moved to Tulsa... Not sure if he's a relative of Will Ferrell and his dad Lee, but it does seem likely.\n\nClyde Ferrell \"Clyde Ferrell\" (Delta Record Company, 1975-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Clyde Ferrell)\n\nOriginally from Texas, songwriter Clyde Ferrell was holding down a gig at the Pinnacle Peak Patio, a steakhouse near Scottsdale, Arizona when he recorded this debut album. About half the songs on here are Ferrell originals, along with covers of contemporary hits like \"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown,\" \"Polk Salad Annie\" and \"Help Me Make It Through The Night.\" It's quintessential lounge band material, with the band jamming a little and sort of farting around on songs they've played a bazillion times and Ferrell, it must be said, makes some interesting choices with the melodies and phrasing on some of these songs; his versions of \"I Can See Clearly Now\" and \"For The Good Times\" veer off in directions that border on the bizarre. But overall, this is a pretty likeable record -- the only track that's truly painful is his cover of \"You've Got A Friend,\" though that might be more James Taylor's fault than Mr. Ferrell's. (I'm guessing at the release date based on the song selection and liner notes, which inform us of Mr. Ferrell \"going professional\" in 1974 and \"soon after\" working at the Pinnacle Peak Patio in Scottsdale, Arizona...) Goofy, but good-natured.\n\nClyde Ferrell \"Brazos River Country\" (Clyde Music Company, 1983) (LP)\n\nLee Ferrell \"Hard Times\" (TMS Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Art Munson & Ernie Winfrey)\n\nYou know what would make this record even better? More cowbell!! Why, yes, my friends, this is in fact actor Will Ferrell's dad, aka Roy Lee Ferrell, Jr., a saxophonist and piano player who blew sax with Dick Dale and later signed up with the Righteous Brothers, at the peak of their late-'60s fame. Originally from North Carolina, Lee Ferrell moved to California in 1964, and became firmly embedded in the SoCal music business. He took some time away from standards and blues on this disc to croon some country, and pretty good stuff at that. Ferrell had kind of a... well, funny voice, pretty high, if not quite falsetto, and he sounds a little goofy at time. Indeed, I wonder if this record -- with its improbably slow tempo-ed ballad version of \"Ramblin' Man\" and a lush rendition of \"This Magic Moment\" -- was perhaps the occasion for a chuckle or two in the Ferrell household, and maybe even an indirect influence on his son's career. Seriously. I don't mean that as a joke or a slight: this is a professionally produced session, with several Nashville heavyweights on board and while Ferrell has distinct limitations as a vocalist, he also wields a what-the-hell aura of self-confidence that feels similar to Will Ferrell's approach to comedy. Sure, haters can hate, but that's not the Ferrells' problem. From a strictly twangfan perspective, the album highlight is probably \"Cross Bar Hotel,\" an amiable, Jimmy Buffett-flavored novelty number about a guy who gets thrown in the drunk tank and cops an unfortunate attitude with some of his cellmates. His version of \"Stolen Wine\" (a hit for Tommy Overstreet) is also a decent cheating song, not quite \"Third Rate Romance,\" but close. (BTW, producer Art Munson was also an alumnus of the Dick Dale band, the Del-Tones, and worked as a session guitarist on various 'Seventies pop and rock albums...)\n\nFestival \"Just Another Band From Skidmore\" (Max Stout Records, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Neal Rieffanaugh & Bill Schnee)\n\nDefinitely not your average, garden-variety southern rock band. This group was from Skidmore, Missouri, a microscopic hamlet in northeastern Missouri, halfway between Kansas City and Omaha. The band was the center of a large commune, originally based on a 300-acre farm outside of town, locally known as \"the Farm.\" Festival was led by songwriter Britt Small, an Army veteran who served as a paratrooper in Vietnam, and spent much of the war fantasizing about starting his own rock band. His dream came true in 1971 when Festival was formed, drawing on several late 'Sixties rock groups from Northwest Missouri State University, in nearby Marysville. It was, oddly enough, the push to make the band successful that led to the formation of the commune, which gave the \"family\" members a sense of cohesion, as well as a place to perform. Self-professed socialists, the communards raised animals and crops, and also decked the band out in shiny, glammy outfits worthy of Jethro Tull or Wizzard, and sent them on the road. Beginning in 1975, the group released numerous singles and LPs, including this one which is perhaps the most country-oriented of the lot, ending with a medley of oldies by the cowboy band, Sons Of The Pioneers. The group included Mr. Small on lead vocals, Stan Funston (guitar) Becky Reinig (keyboards), Mark Reinig (drums), arranger Don Struve on trumpet, and various and sundry others. Although they were mostly rockers, Festival considered themselves distinctly a rural band, and referred to themselves as \"the world's funkiest cowboy band.\" They toured throughout the United States and Canada, though in the early 1980s the tone of the group shifted from a party vibe to a more conservative political perspective, as Britt Small became consumed by POW-MIA issues, and the band's repertoire became almost entirely patriotic music. The commune and the band began to fray in the 1990s, and broke up entirely in the early '00s. [Many thanks to David M. Struve for his amazingly detailed history thesis, which provides extremely granular detail of the Farm, and of his dad's band.]\n\nThe Fiddle And Banjo Club Of Roanoke, Virginia/Various Artists \"The Sounds Of...\" (Rite Records, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by James H. Barrett)\n\nThis two LP set was the second release by this far-flung group of old-timey music fans from Roanoke and environs... The tracks are a mix of the greater \"Club\" musicians and tracks by specific artists and bands that were associated with the Club and its sponsors. These artists include Connie Brothers & The Floyd County Boys, Cecil Edwards, Paul Elkins, Marvin Harlow, Jim Hypes, Clinton King, The Knicely Family, Charlie Robertson, Wilton Shorter, Frank Turner, Betty Waldron, and Charlie Whitehead, as well as Lawrence Dodson & The Dreadful Snakes, who as far as I know had no direct connection to Bela Fleck's early '80s band of the same name. Although another album came out under the Club name was clearly a \"various artists\" set, this one includes more than half the tracks without naming any specific artists, which leads me to believe there was a larger, anonymous communal jam band that could legitimately be listed under the Fiddle And Banjo name. Please correct me if I'm wrong!\n\nFred Field \"...And Friends\" (Maranatha Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Neal Rieffanaugh & Bill Schnee)\n\nCalifornia Christian \"Jesus-freak\" hippie country-rock, with erstwhile Burrito Brother Al Perkins on steel guitar... Some of this is genuine Jesus-y twang, though many tracks have more of a sugary, folkie feel, and some even drift into subpar soft rock, saxophones and all. Fred Field had a pretty thin voice which may have been suited to the 'Seventies AOR sound, but he seems to have had a bluegrassy background, playing banjo, fiddle and mandolin, even though the arrangements are more of a glossy pop tint. This is an intriguing album for the genre, though most twangfans may want to avoid it; it's not all that country, after all. Field seems to have gotten into more jazzy stuff not long after this.\n\nShirley Field \"Two Sides Of Shirley Field\" (Banff Records, 1963) (LP)\n\nA Canadian cowgal from Armstrong, British Columbia whose career dates back to the 1940s -- in her early teens Ms. Field was a regional star, playing at rodeos and hosting her own radio show. She landed a gig playing with Evan Kemp's band, then started her own group, the Country Casuals, which she led through the 'Fifties. Later on she and her sister led an all-gal band called the Dartells, while Shirley formed several several long-term duets partnerships over the years. This was her first album, recorded in Ontario after she'd sojourned to Nashville, where she cut a few singles and even played at the Opry the year before. This album featured heartsongs on one side and yodeling on the other... [Many thanks to 45cat.com for their awesome Shirley Field biography, in addition to info about her singles.]\n\nShirley Field \"Yours Sincerely\" (Banff Records, 1969-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dougal Trineer & George Taylor)\n\nShirley Field & Billy G. French \"Together\" (Vintage Records, 1972) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Art Snider & Glenn Clarke)\n\nCurley Fields & The Kentuckians \"Live At The Showboat Lounge\" (Jo-Cur Records, 1969) (LP)\n\nA country covers band from Milwaukee, Wisconsin... Why they billed themselves as the Kentuckians, I have no idea. Vocals are split between Curley Fields, Karen Otis and Jack Abuya. Fields also cut several singles for the Cuca record label in Sauk City.\n\nJudy Fields \"Halfway To Paradise\" (Victory Records, 1985) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ken Mansfield, Judy Fields & Larry Cumings)\n\nAn independently released album by Northern California artist Judy Fields, who moved to Nashville and worked as a songwriter, successfully pitching songs to artists such as Lee Greenwood and Reba McEntire. She was briefly signed to MCA Records, but only released a single or two, with no chart action... Her earlier work can be heard on an uber-indie album called CONTRA COSTA COUNTRY, which was recorded with several other NorCal artists. Unfortunately, this solo debut is fairly dreadful -- she \"went pop\" in a big way, drenching her songs in tinkly keyboards and glossy early-'80s production. Also, she had a penchant for anthemic romantic refrains which she would repeat and repeat and repeat, unwilling to let any crescendo die a natural death. I guess if you're into this particular era of Nashville gals, this disc could be of interest... The Reba connection certainly makes sense once you've heard this album. Also, David Frizzell produced a couple of tracks on here, including one he co-wrote called \"You're The Magician,\" which also came out as a single.\n\nThe Fifth String \"Hawaiian Grown Bluegrass\" (Oshure Mountain Records, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Earl Hughes)\n\nStraight-up progressive bluegrass, with tips of the hat towards contemporary country folks like Emmylou Harris and the Flying Burrito Brothers... The group included Joe Dye (banjo), Marj Dye (bass), Sam Hayakawa (mandolin), producer Earl Hughes on fiddle and guitar, Don Staib (banjo, dobro and guitar), Vicki Staib (guitar) and everyone chiming in on vocals. The material is all mainland stuff, tunes like \"Fox On The Run\" and \"Rawhide,\" as well as some Emmylou classics like \"Blue Kentucky Girl\" and \"Roses In The Snow.\" Not that this reflects any failing on Fifth String's part, but does anyone know of any Hawaiian bands that did bluegrass versions of island music? You know, a lightning-fast \"Aloha Oe,\" or even a twangy \"Tiny Bubbles\"? Just wondering.\n\nJan Files \"What More Can I Say\" (1977-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Mike Schrimpf, Jerry Shook & Colin Walker)\n\nCrowned as Miss Jefferson City in 1975, Missouri teenager Jan Files made a serious bid to crack into Nashville -- or maybe move out to LA? -- truckin' down to Nashville to cut this shiny, well-produced countrypolitan/AOR album right after graduating from high school. It's a pretty impressive set, even if the songs and arrangements get to be a bit much... A fine singer, Ms. Files evokes comparison to '70s sirens such as Olivia Newton-John and Karen Carpenter (and even Loretta Haggers, on the twangier tunes) while the musical backing is pretty solid, too, smoothly shifting from disco-tinged pop to generic pop-country. She's backed by the house band at Mike Schrimpf's independent studio, which at the time still included future star Steve Wariner, who plays bass, acoustic and electric guitars, and sings backup. There's also an early song of his on here, \"Will You Still Love Me In The Morning,\" a hookup ballad that's not to be confused with Carole King's similarly-titled girl-group hit... Wariner was already under contract to RCA Records at the time, although hadn't yet released his own first single, and as far as I know, never released this song under his own name. Anyway, this slick-sounding custom-pressed album really coulda-shoulda-woulda made Jan Files a star, if the planets had lined up the right way... As it was, I imagine it mostly made the rounds at county fairs and Christmas parties, though fans of 'Seventies soft-pop (and Steve Wariner devotees) might enjoy tracking it down.\n\nKent Findlay \"Christmas Time In Luckenbach\" (Delta Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Kent Findley, Louis Jay Meyers & Darrell Staetler)\n\nAn acolyte of Luckenbach, Texas's \"Sunday mayor,\" Hondo Crouch, barkeep Kent Findlay was co-owner of the Cheatham Street Station, a lively venue in nearby San Marcos, which he bought in 1974, soon becoming a champion of the shaggy hippie/outlaw twang oozing out of Austin. He was also a musician himself, and threw a little early 'Eighties holiday party with backing from a buncha Lone Star locals: Stan Ashlock (bass), Clark Cordell (fiddle), Larry Eisenberg (harmonica), Roy Garcia (bass and guitar), Lynn Gathright (drums), Wayne Gathright (bass), Bill Grace (drums), Jeff Heckler (bass), Chris Lawrence (dobro and steel guitar), Betty Lu (fiddle), Louis Jay Meyer (guitar, banjo and steel guitar), Roy Rushing (drums), and co-producer Darrell Staetler on guitar. The songs are a mix of Christmas chestnuts like \"Blue Christmas,\" along with a hefty dose of newer compositions, including the title track, \"Christmas Time In Luckenbach,\" which comes in both edited and explicit versions. [Worth noting: Kent Findley was around in the glory days of the outlaw era, but kept running the Cheatham Street bar well into the 21st Century, when he also help usher in the red dirt revival, notably boosting the career of singer Randy Rogers, who moved from regional fame into the national Back Forty.]\n\nGerald Finley \"The Hurtin's Back Again\" (Crusade Enterprises, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Gerald Finley)\n\nA picker and singer from Flora, Illinois, leading an all-locals band in an almost-all covers set, including some interesting choices, such as \"Only Daddy That'll Walk The Line,\" \"Clap For The Wolfman,\" \"Southern Nights\" and \"Sixpack To Go.\" The title track, \"The Hurtin's Back Again,\" was a Gerald Finley original.\n\nLarry Finnegan \"My Kind Of Country\" (Svensk American, 1966) (LP)\n\nAmerican-born John Lawrence Finneran (1939-1973) was a teenpop/rockabilly singer from New York whose big hit, \"Dear One,\" came out back in 1961, during the Kennedy administration. \"Dear One\" almost cracked the Top Ten, but subsequent singles flopped, so though he started out on American labels, Finneran found his biggest fans in Europe, and soon signed to Sonet Records in Denmark. He cut numerous singles for Sonet before moving to Sweden and starting his own label, Svensk American, which was based in Stockholm, and also had some kind of licensing deal in the UK. The title of this LP is entirely accurate: all the songs were Finneran originals, part of his new career as a songwriter, with his biggest successes from pitching material to European artists. Though he released a slew of singles under the Larry Finnegan stage name, this seems to have been his only full album of English-language material; a posthumous double album was released several years after his death in 1973.\n\nLarry Finnegan \"Larry Finnegans Basta\" (Svensk American, 1968) (LP)\n\nMr. Finneran recorded a fair amount of Swedish-language material as well, with numerous songs written by or with Swedish collaborators such as Olle Bergman, Ingvar Hellberg and Rune Walleborn, who were all pop musicians with careers of their own. Not sure how much of a country vibe is in any of these tracks, though. (Note: this was re-released in the 1970s under the title Larry Finnegan Pa Svenska.)\n\nLarry Finnegan \"In Memoriam\" (Sonet Records, 1979) (LP)\n\nAfter living in Sweden for much of the 'Sixties, Finneran returned to the United States in 1970, retiring to South Bend, Indiana and passing away in 1973 as the result of a brain tumor. This posthumously-released, two-disc retrospective includes many (if not all) of his singles on Sonet and Svensk American, as well as earlier stuff like \"Dear One\" and his other American recordings; the last ten tracks were the entire My Kind Of Country album.\n\nJim Finneran \"The Road Ain't No Place For A Lady\" (Sea Port Records, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Neil Rush, Tex Hughes & Jim Finneran)\n\nSort of post-hippie country from featuring lanky Pacific Northwest local John Finneran, who also appeared on Wild Bill Oscher's Montana Power album... I'm not sure where Finneran was from; possibly SeaTac, as the label was located in Federal Way, near Tacoma, although a Montana connection seems likely as well. Co-producer Neil Rush, who also performs on the album, was Merrilee Rush's husband and manager in the 1960s, and a revered regional mover and shaker on the Seattle scene. Other musicians include Bill Bernard, Larry Fox, Doug Heath, pitching in on a pretty sincere set of modern-day country songs.\n\nMaury Finney \"Saxaphone Country\" (NSD/Soundwaves Records, 1972-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Larry Benson & Joe Lewis)\n\nA sax player from East Grand Forks, Minnesota, Maury Finney hoofed it down to Oklahoma City to record his first album at the Benson Sound Studio; he was helped in part by Joe Lewis, a member of Conway Twitty's band, as well as some unidentified studio musicians, presumably drawn from Larry Benson's seasoned staff... Pity they misspelled the word \"saxophone,\" though (at least on one edition of this album...)\n\nMaury Finney \"Sax Life In Nashville\" (NSD/Soundwaves Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Gibson & Lloyd Green)\n\nThere's no place like Nashville... Finney's second album was glitzy Music City production, with a slew of all-star super-pickers such as Tommy Allsup, Johnny Gimble, Lloyd Green, Dave Kirby, Hargus Robbins, Buddy Spicher and Bobby Thompson, et. al. Mostly covers of classic country oldies, though he does slip in a pop tune or two, such as his rendition of David Gates's saccharine smash, \"If...\" Maury Finney was a retailer by trade, owning an appliance store in his home town of East Grand, MN, but he had a run of success as a country musician in the late 'Seventies, charting several singles in the Back Forty, and earning a CMA nod as instrumentalist of the year in 1977.\n\nMaury Finney \"Country Sax Comes To Town (Nashville, That Is!)\" (NSD/Soundwaves Records, 1978-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Gibson)\n\nJohn Finnigan \"Way Up The Sky\" (Mid Ear Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by John Finnigan & Steve Cooper)\n\nThe duo of Maureen Finlon and John Finnigan -- who later renamed their act Silver Shoes -- were active on the Texas Americana scene 'way back when -- before the Americana genre even existed, as demonstrated by this disc. I'm not sure, but I think they came to Texas from Midwestern roots, and later relocated to Taos, New Mexico, sometime in the early '90s.\n\nMike Finnigan \"Mike Finnigan\" (Warner Brothers, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jerry Wexler)\n\nKeyboard player to the stars, Mike Finnigan is perhaps best known as a rock, pop and R&B player, and for his work with rock and pop elite such as Jimi Hendrix, Peter Frampton, and Crosby Stills & Nash, but he also had a country side, as heard in parts of this funky, eclectic album, which includes Texas fiddler Johnny Gimble and picker Pete Carr as part of an impressive studio lineup. At the time, according to the liner notes, his day jobs included backing Maria Muldaur and Dave Mason, and Muldaur sings on here as well... Mostly it's a white soul album -- I'm reminded of Bill Champlin on several tracks -- but on songs like \"Mississippi On My Mind,\" \"Southern Lady\" and \"Misery Loves Company,\" there's a subtle bit of twang. The Stamps Quartet provides some Southern gospel backup, ala the Oak Ridge Boys... Mostly this is too slick and pop-oriented for me, but it's a good slice of eclectic '70s musicmaking, for the more AOR-oriented among us.\n\nR.C. Finnigan \"Truck Drivin' Music\" (Spirit Music, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bob Baldori & Mark Stebbeds)\n\nEarly 'Eighties neo-trad by a guy from Okemos, Michigan, a rural township on the eastern side of Lansing. Plenty of songs about trucks, truckstops, waitresses and diners, and plenty of early 'Eighties country swagger. And of course, we simply cannot drive 55, not even in a fully loaded semi!\n\nFire Mountain Militia \"Edge Of The Night\" (Thunder Lizard, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bob Leep, John Altman & Dave Weil)\n\nA swell set of hippiebilly indie-twang from Carmichael, California (near San Jose...) This quartet showcased all original material, songs penned by singers Dean Agee or Bob Leep, with Leep's material being perhaps more decisively \"country\" and and uptempo, while Agee was fond of sagas of wasted nights and low-rent barroom flings. The sound is mostly plunky bar-band country, ala Chuck Wagon & The Wheels, though there's a trace of bluesy, Dead-like jam-band rock hinted at in a few of the performances. The group also had mixed male-female vocals, with bassist Sharon George mostly sticking to harmony, but also taking the lead on the appropriately-named \"Torch Song,\" which reveals a slightly jazzy undertone. You could pick these guys apart for their amateurism if you wanted to, or you could choose to be charmed by it, in which case you'd find this to be a pretty strong entry for the genre. Northern California strikes again!\n\nFireball Express \"Fireball Express\" (Casino Records, 197--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bart Curtis)\n\nWell, you know me, I'm always a sucker for any version of the 'Seventies oldie, \"Aime\" -- it's just such a great pop song! These guys seem to have been from around Ithaca, New York -- the album was made at a studio in Elmira, near the Pennsylvania border, and the band played gigs on both sides of the state line. At the time this album was made, the group included Rich Hawkins (lead guitar), Ron Earley (drums), Tom Caffo (bass) and Larry Bates on steel guitar. Although keyboardist Jim DePaul was considered a \"guest\" artist when they were in the studio, let's just be nice and say he was in the band, too. It was a while ago. Fireball Express was still together in the late '80s, though with a different lineup which still included Earley and Hawkins, as well as a gal singer called Linda Lee, who had experience singing of some regional \"jamboree\" variety shows. Any additional info about these folks would be welcome!\n\nFirefall \"The Greatest Hits\" (Atlantic, 1992)\n\nI suppose I am obliged to mention the super-slick Top 40 Boulder, Colorado 'Seventies band Firefall, which is perhaps really more of a \"soft rock\" band, but certainly had a respectable country-rock pedigree. Singer Rick Roberts was in an early lineup of the Flying Burrito Brothers (as was drummer Mickey Clarke) and co-founder Jock Bartley was briefly in Gram Parson's backup band, the Fallen Angels, as well as Chris Hillman's post-Burritos band in the mid-'70s. Et cetera, et cetera. Anyway, there was some residual twang, or at least an acoustic sensibility underneath their slick pop hits, though I suspect many twangfans will find a lot of their material pretty noxious, the very epitome of whiny '70s wimp-rock. (Though I have to confess I still have a positive Pavlovian response to some of these oldies, though I won't say which ones... I have to keep a few secrets!) At their best, they were Crosby Stills & Nash knockoffs (like on \"It Doesn't Matter,\" the first track on their first album...) At their worst, as heard on the later tracks of this best-of collection, they played some truly awful, tepid, heartless, semi-synthy stuff, kind of like Toto, but not even that good. Their early-'80s decline was not a pretty thing. So, yeah, part of the country-rock story, but not as interesting as, say, Pure Prairie League.\n\nThe First Nashville Jesus Band \"Welcome To Nashville\" (Lamb & Lion Records, 1973) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Billy Linneman & Jack Linneman)\n\nMan, what a great band name! This group, which may have had a shifting lineup, was formed primarily to back singer Pat Boone on some of his more country-flavored gospel outings, though they also backed Del Wood, and released some stuff \"solo\" under the band's name. Among the session players on this album are guitarist Jimmy Capps, Johnny Gimble, and steel player Jeff Newman. Although I think the sessions were cut in Nashville, Boone's Lamb & Lion label was headquartered in LA, and was associated with the budget-line Hilltop Records. A couple of the tunes were of newer origin, like their covers of \"Daddy Sang Bass\" and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" as well as an original, \"Why,\" which was composed by the group's pianist, David Reese.\n\nThe First Nashville Jesus Band \"Peace In The Valley\" (Lamb & Lion Records, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Billy Linneman & Jack Linneman)\n\nAnother album of gospel standards, recorded in Nashville with a top-flight studio crew including Jimmy Capps, Paul Charron (drums), fiddler Johnny Gimble, bassist Billy Linneman (who also played in Marty Robbins' band), Jeff Newman (dobro and pedal steel) and pianists David Reese and Jerry Whitehurst -- basically the same lineup as the previous album.\n\nMarty Firstenberg \"P.S. I Love You By Marty: In Memory Of Gloria Firstenburg\" (1985-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jerry Bradley & Gene Breeden)\n\nAw. This privately released album is a touching memento recorded by a guy whose wife died in an auto accident along the Oregon coast. The Firstenbergs were square-dancing enthusiasts who participated in and \"called\" events around Salem, Oregon in the late '70s and early '80s, as part of the Goodtimers dance group. She died in November, 1984, and not long after he booked time at a studio in Nashville and recorded a set of what I assume were some of her favorite songs, drawing mainly on country material, along with some pop tunes such as \"PS, I Love You.\" Many selections are nakedly forlorn and mournful, such as covers of Merle Haggard's \"Place To Fall Apart\" and \"What Am I Gonna Do,\" or Ken Wesley's \"We Never Ran Out Of Love.\" The backing band included Gene Breeden on guitar and Doug Jernigan playing steel. Sad, but sweet.\n\nChuck Fisher \"Visions Of Elvis/And Just Me\" (Thunder Bolt Records, 1981-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Gail Faught & Tommy Esian)\n\nYou'll be forgiven for assuming this is an Elvis Presley tribute album, or that Mr. Fisher might have been an Elvis imitator. Yes, he does tip his hat towards the King, and covers some classic Elvis songs, including \"Heart Break Hotel\" and \"Love Me Tender,\" but the rest of the record is a mix of country and pop oldies played by a pretty scruffy, redneck-y-lookin' band from Strongville, Ohio. The group was made up of Tommy Duty (bass), Gail Faught (lead guitar), Paul Haney (drums), Johnny Shaffer (steel guitar), and Gail Shephard (piano). Though mostly a covers set, the album ends with an original by guitarist Gail Faught, \"Don't Let It Slip Away,\" and may have some other original material as well.\n\nK. W. Fissell \"Freightliner\" (Rome Records, 1982-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jack Casey & K.W. Fissell)\n\nAn independent set of all-original material from Ohioan Ken W. Fissell, who is the lead vocals and plays guitar, along with Junior Bennett (strings), Steve Birrell (drums), Sonny Curtis (steel guitar), Jim Ebert (piano), Conrad Sarina (bass), and guitarist Audie Wykle, as well as backing vocals from Becky Brown and Susy Rose. It should be noted that this Sonny Curtis was an Ohio-based picker who did some session work for Rome Records, and should not be confused with the pop-and-country songwriter of the same name; also, Susy Rose was a former child recording artist who previously cut an album of her own for the label, and several of the other musicians also pop up on other regionally-produced albums.\n\nJohn Fitzwater \"In A Country State Of Mind\" (Out Of Town Records, 1984) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Johnny Maggard)\n\nSinger-guitarist John Fitzwater started out playing rock in an late-'Fifties/early-'Sixties band called The Tornadoes, playing regionally around Dodge City, Kansas. He moved into a series of country groups, including Don Pray's band, and eventually started his own group, Country Fever, which included guitarist Jerry Wilcox who had been playing with Fitzgerald since the early '70s. Around the time this album was recorded, Wilcox died in a parachuting accident, though Fitzgerald and the band -- which included Wilcox's son, Darrin, on drums -- kept plugging away despite the tragedy. Fitzwater seems to have left Country Fever by decade's end, although the band stayed together for several decades, with a lineup that has shifted over the years. This album was distributed by MCA, though it remained a regional release.\n\nThe Five Pennies \"Joe Paul Nichols Presents...\" (Bollman International Music, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Paul Nichols & Jerry Abbott)\n\nIntroduced in the liner notes as \"one of the finest traveling bands in the South,\" this group from Dallas, Texas was an archetypal working-man's band. Bassist Roy Tunney was the group's lead singer, along with fiddler James Roberson, steel player Carroll Parham, guitar picker Teddy Johnson and Joe Wayne Campsey on drums. The record includes only two vocal numbers, with Tunney singing lead on Red Steagall's \"Someone Cares For You\" and Ray Price's \"Release Me,\" with all the other tracks being instrumentals. The set list includes a lot of dancehall oldies, like \"San Antonio Rose,\" \"Westphalia Waltz\" and \"Cotton-Eyed Joe,\" with various bandmembers taking solos, including a version of \"Orange Blossom Special\" and an instrumental take on Merle Haggard's \"Working Man Blues,\" spotlighting Teddy Johnson. I'm not sure if they backed any particular artists, or if they were just their own, self-contained band.\n\nThe Flaherty Brothers Band \"FBB\" (Furry Records, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jerry Kirk & Lowell Varney)\n\nBrothers E. J. Flaherty and Paul Flaherty were from Charleston, West Virginia, though they recorded this album in Crum, West Virginia... Their \"rural rock\" repertoire includes covers of songs from the roots/country rock firmament: Rusty Weir's \"Don't It Make You Wanna Dance,\" Little Feat's \"Willin',\" and Buffalo Springfield's \"For What It's Worth.\" There's also a healthy amount of original material, such as \"Never Thought\" and \"Diane,\" written by Paul Flaherty, and two tunes by bassist Tim White -- \"Jack And Ginger\" and \"Brand New Seed.\"\n\nTerry Flannery & Mary Ann Marshall \"Little Bit Country\" (MTF Productions, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Sargon N. Yonan)\n\nThe lounge duo of Terry Flannery & Mary Ann Marshall -- also known simply as \"Terry & Mary Ann\" -- recorded this album at the Sargon Recording Studios in Skokie, Illinois and they give a shout-out on the cover to the folks working at the O'Hare-Kennedy Holiday Inn, where I'd assume they had a regular gig. Terry Flannery did the arrangements and plays most of the instruments -- guitars, bass and keyboards -- along with Ms. Marshall on 12-string and 6-string acoustic guitars and drummer Ron Baron rounding out the sound. They cover stuff like \"Me And Bobby McGee\" and \"The Gambler\" as well as oldies like \"Danny Boy\" and \"Ghost Riders In The Sky,\" and Flannery even gets all choppsy with a run-through of the Spanish guitar standard, \"Malaguena.\" The Kenny Rogers cover places this one at least 1979, if not later. They were not great, but this is a very authentic album from a typical '70s lounge act.\n\nNeil Flanz \"...Et Son Nashville Steel\" (Trans-Canada Records, 1962) (LP)\n\nThe first solo album by steel player Neil Flanz, who anchored the house band of a Canadian TV show called Star Route, which was hosted by Rod Cameron. Originally from Montreal, Flanz toured with Gary Buck and a number of other Canadian country stars before making the move to Nashville, where he worked with several older, more traditionally-oriented artists. Flanz may be best known to modern country fans as a member of Gram Parson's early-'Seventies band, The Fallen Angels, which backed Parsons and his then-protege, Emmylou Harris, on their fabled 1973 tour.\n\nNeil Flanz \"Get On The Star Route\" (Arc Music, 1964) (LP)\n\nA pleasant set of pedal steel instrumentals showcasing the steel prowess of Neil Flanz, who was still deeply embedded in the Canadian country scene. Of particular interest on this album are the low notes Flanz delves into, as opposed to the standard higher-end tonalities that typify pedal steel work.\n\nNeil Flanz \"Special Instructions Album\" (Sho-Bud Records, 1972) (LP)\n\nThis was an instructional album for learning to play pedal steel, sponsored by the Sho-Bud instrument manufacturers... Maybe not quite as much fun for the average listener, but I'm sure some of you Steel Guitar Forum types out there might get a kick out of it.\n\nNorm Flash & The Starfires \"Proud Daddy\" (Starfire Records, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Norm Flash & Joe Riccard)\n\nFlat Creek Revue \"Just For You\" (Flat Creek Records, 1979-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Rick Salyer)\n\nA country covers band from Kingsport, Tennessee, up in the far northeastern corner of the state... Although the album provides no exact information about where this band was from, the liner notes inform us they played regionally in East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia. Their album came out on a mostly-gospel label from Kingsport, which seems to be where several bandmembers lived as well. Flat Creek Revue included Bill Hass on bass, David Martin (steel guitar), Bobby Schaffer (lead vocals), Carter Stanley (lead guitar), Jane Cox Thompson (piano), and Darris 'Pop' Turner on drums; although some sources call them a bluegrass band, their repertoire was pretty solidly country, electrified instruments and all. Lots of covers, including late-'Seventies hits such as \"The Door Is Always Open,\" from Waylon Jennings' outlaw glory years, and George Jones' 1978 weeper, \"I'll Just Take It Out In Love.\" Alas, there are no songwriter credits, so it's difficult to tell if the album also contains any originals. This seems to be the only Flat Creek Revue album, although a couple of years later they backed another Kingsport musician, singer Ruth Cleek (aka \"Ruth E\") on her album Tonite I'm Missing You, which featured several songs written by members of the band.\n\nFlatbush \"Driver's Dream\" (Bush League Records, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Flatbush & Jerry Bruno)\n\nOne of the premiere country-rock bands from Cleveland, Ohio during the late 1970s... These guys apparently broke up in 1981, not long after recording this album...\n\nCliff Flatford \"Time With Cliff Flatford\" (Time Records, 1974-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bud Tido & Cliff Flatford)\n\nSinger Cliff G. Flatford (1939-2000) was born in Maynardsville, Tennessee, but living in Indiana when he cut this album with his own band, The Flatlanders [* not to be confused with Butch, Jimmie and Joe, of course...] The repertoire includes several countrypolitan covers, as well as a few originals by Cliff Flatford and by his brother Paul Flatford. Mr. Flatford was a factory worker who quit his day job to pursue a music career sometime around 1974, when he was profiled in a local newspaper article that also mentions him cutting his first record, with a little help from Nashville superstar Conway Twitty. This album is probably the record in question, though he may have cut a single or two as well. Anyone know more about this fella?\n\nFlatland Band \"Plainly Scene\" (Golden Rope Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Tom Deglman & The Flatland Band)\n\nNot to be confused with the legendary Texas band, The Flatlanders, this country-rock crew from Illinois had a guitar-centric sound with some pedal steel on top... All original material written by bandmembers Gordy Cotter, Jerry Reno and Sam Dean. If anyone knows more about these fellas, I'm all ears!\n\nThe Flatland Cloggers \"Dance, Children, Dance\" (Flatland Records, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bob Johnson & Dick Smith)\n\nA musical memento of a teenage clogging troupe from Tidewaters, Virginia, near Chesapeake. The group was formed in 1977 and performed locally as well as at live music venues as guests of established artists such as Lester Flatt, Kitty Wells and the Osborne Brothers. This album features four twelve-minute long sets with old-timey backing by bassist Gray Granger, Roher Gray (fiddle), Bill Gurley (banjo), Todd Jefferson (spoons) and Barry McLawhorne on guitar. Bill Gurley also played in a late-'Seventies edition of bluegrass traditionalist Jim Eanes' band, while Granger and Gurley also recorded together in the folk band Morning Flight; guitarist Barry McLawhorne later led a country rock band called Heartland, which made an album in 1985.\n\nThe Flatlanders - see artist discography\n\nAnsley Fleetwood \"Ansley Fleetwood\" (ACA Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nPianist Ansley Fleetwood is best remembered as the guy who wrote Moe Bandy and Joe Stampley's chart-topping 1979 duet, \"Just Good Ole Boys,\" one of the biggest country hits of the early '80s. Fleetwood was a member of Joe Stampley's band when the idea to have the two singers combine forces was first being batted around, and he penned the redneck novelty number as a showcase for their talents. Fleetwood had been knocking around Nashville since the early '70s, recording on tiny labels and writing several other (far less successful) songs, as well as producing a few singles for other, equally obscure artists. He also composed the song \"Finding You,\" which was a minor hit for Stampley in 1983... Later on Fleetwood worked in Jeanne Pruett's 1980's band and eventually seems to have dropped out of the Nashville scene and become a music educator. I'm not sure where this undated album fits into his career, although from the looks of it, I'm guessing it's a mid-to-late '70s record, made some time before the Moe & Joe thing took off. Maybe around 1977...?\n\nVirgil Fleming \"Let It Burn\" (Cova Records, 1978-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bobby Bradley & Harold Bradley)\n\nCountry singer Virgil Fleming (1953-2016) and his cousin, coal baron Charles Cova Elkins both seemed to be huge Elvis Presley fans and had the sideburns to prove it. Although they were totally into The King, this disc was a pretty straightforward honkytonk country set, recorded in Nashville with an all-pro, a-list studio band. I think it was Mr. Elkins who footed the bill for these Nashville sessions; he had been recording at Bradley's Barn for several years, starting back around 1971 and released several singles under his own name, as well as several others by Virgil Fletcher. They also formed a backing band called the Fallen Sta"
