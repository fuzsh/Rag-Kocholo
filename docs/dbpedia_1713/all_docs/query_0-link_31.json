        "text": "CATHOLIC GUILT (Melbourne, AUS) Return With Blissful New Single + Video \"Live For The Rush\"\n\n\"I want to create and destroy at the same time, I want to laugh and cry at once, I want to change the world but not impact mine, I want to feel everything, all at once, I want to live for the rush\"\n\n\"An anthem for the opposing feelings and beliefs that we carry inside of ourselves all the time. Hook-laden alt-rock that’s sure to thrill fans of 00’s scene heroes like The Ataris, Saosin, and Taking Back Sunday.\"- Tuned Up\n\nMelbourne alt-rockers Catholic Guilt mark their return with the new banger \"Live For The Rush,\" off their upcoming sophomore LP due out later this year on Wiretap Records.\n\nThe single is the band's first to feature new full-time guitarist/vocalist Megan Sidwell.\n\nStream \"Live For The Rush\" on Spotify: https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/catholicguilt/live-for-the-rush\n\nProduced by Ash Daws and Evan Lee at The Loud Noise Estate\n\nWatch the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytPt_ZbF2s4\n\nVideo Credit: @LUSE Media\n\nVocalist Brenton Harris says, ‘Live For The Rush’ is a song about wanting to feel truly ‘alive’ again, after a prolonged period of emotional paralysis. It is about holding an insatiable desire to experience the sensation of life, yet at the same time living in fear of the risks and changes that might be required to do so.\n\nIt is a very human thing to want to feel everything, all at once, to want to explore all that this finite existence can offer, yet it is also a very human thing to want to protect the status quo because the status quo offers the safety and the surety of knowing, even if what we know isn’t providing fulfilment. ’Live For The Rush’ is an anthem about rediscovering the joy of the unknown and in the process learning to feel again.\n\nGuitarist Dean Gordon adds, \"Being a kid of the 90s the word ‘Rush’ has strong ties to extreme sports like surfing & skateboarding, taking me back to my adolescence and the excitement and freedom of the summer holidays. An escape from the responsibilities of everyday life, and the opportunity to get out into the world, take risks and make new connections.\n\nIt seemed fitting that musically ‘Live For The Rush‘ should look to conjure those same nostalgic feelings for the listener. Attempting to mirror the contemplative internal dialogue of fear, tension and ultimately bliss, when you decide to get up, get out there and experience everything life has to offer.\"\n\nThe video depicts a day of activity for a Sauce bottle character which turns into an uplifting jam with their friends who need a bit of spark.\n\nThe clip's director Sophia Van Doorn says \"The premise of this video at first glance is silly, funny and kinda weird. But when you delve into the bright, shiny world that Sauce lives in, there’s a whole lot more to it. Given that Sauce is depicted in an overly saturated, orange-hued world, their life is a vibrant, action-packed and fulfilling existence. Its stark contrast to the initial band shots of gloomy, lackluster monotony creates a juxtaposition of light and dark. The band's jubilant facial expressions upon Sauce’s arrival are the hero of this video and really tie back to the incredible lyrics, uplifting the viewer. It was hilarious running around town shooting the Sauce scenes and the band nailed all their shots in every aspect - the fun and ridiculousness shines through in the video. As a first-time director of a music video, I’m thrilled with the outcome, it looks awesome. Awesomesauce.\"\n\nCatholic Guilt combines elements of punk, alt, folk and rock, resulting in a sound they describe as 'honest music.’\n\nFollowing the success of 2018's independently released debut EP Hymnbook Vol. 1 which saw the band sellout Melbourne's iconic Reverence Hotel, secure Spotify editorial playlisting and receive national radio airplay via triple j for singles \"Counterfeit Guitars\" and \"Paper & Ink,\" the band released a critically acclaimed follow-up This Is What Honesty Sounds Like via the Californian label Wiretap Records in August 2020. A musical exploration of five very different human experiences, isolation, frustration, love, anger, and loss, This Is What Honesty Sounds Like earned the band national and international airplay via over 130 stations and received widespread acclaim from outlets including Alternative Press, Music Feeds, Brooklyn Vegan and Pop Matters.\n\nThe band also achieved the rare feat of having all five songs on the release secure triple j 'first plays' and a coveted triple j unearthed feature artist spot. The release also saw Spotify editorial playlisting support via New Punk Tracks (\"Song Of The Renter\", \"The Awful Truth\", \"A Boutique Affair\", \"Life In Three Part Harmony\") and The Scene (\"The Awful Truth\").\n\nThe band built off the success of the release by signing with booking agency Destroy All Lines and playing a run of shows in Australia, including multiple sold-out shows in their hometown of Melbourne.\n\nCatholic Guilt has since gone on to appear on major Australian festivals Full Tilt and Knight and Day as well as stage a successful tour of the East Coast of Australia and secured the main support with Pure Noise Records act Real Friends and most recently landing a slot opening slot for Switchfoot. Off the back of the success of This Is What Honesty Sounds Like, they were invited to perform at the iconic Gainesville punk festival FEST in October. The band also contributed a cover of Saves The Day’s \"At Your Funeral\" to the Vagrant Records 25th Anniversary compilation Undercover On The Streets put out by Wiretap Records and Friend Club Records. This cover received Apple Music editorial playlisting on New In Rock.\n\nThe quintet recently welcomed guitarist/vocalist Megan Sidwell into the fold and released the single \"Talking Fake.\" A slow-burning, emotive rock song about the communication breakdown that occurs within fractured relationships, the song saw Catholic Guilt expand their sonic palette, incorporating a Hammond organ, a string section, congos and glockenspiel. The single was accompanied by an award-winning cinematic short, co-produced by Soft Focus Media and Taymaynari Productions, the film tells the story of a couple who are drifting apart, thrown into a fantasy-stylized world of the night they first met.\n\n+++\n\nCatholic Guilt is Brenton Harris (Vocals), Dean Gordon (Guitar/Vocals) Megan Sidwell (Guitar/Vocals), Ben Caruana (Bass), Michael Condello (drums)\n\n***\n\nPraise for Catholic Guilt:\n\n\"...a casually genre-defying fusion of punk, emo, indie rock, folk...\"- Brooklynvegan\n\n\" A beacon of light for anyone who finds themselves at the crossroads of pop punk and folk, Australian outfit Catholic Guilt blend the two seamlessly. Add prominent influences by bands as diverse as Against Me!, Thrice and the Menzingers and you’ve got sounds and styles that are as beautiful as they are varied.\"- Alternative Press\n\n\"...many moments that remind you of other bands/artists like Frank Turner, Pompeii, Against Me and The Menzingers...hugely melodic uplifting Rock n Roll, you are immediately aware that this is a band that will not leave you feeling flat, even when the subject matter cover such things as the feeling of isolation and social distance, they seem to be able to add an emotional uplift to it.\" (4.5 out of 5 stars)- ThePunkSite\n\n\"On the surface, their songs draw you in with catchy hooks and a welcoming Pop/Punk energy, however a closer listen will reveal a deeper emotional vulnerability hidden within their lyricism. 'This is What Honesty Sounds Like' is a triumph in songwriting from an up-and-coming band that revels in blazing a path that is clearly their own, all the while inviting us to walk alongside them.\"- Hunnypot\n\n\"Melbourne’s Catholic Guilt describe their sound as ‘honest music’ and on their latest EP we get to find out what that sounds like. Turns out honesty sounds like pop punk with folky undertones, thick with gorgeous melodies and slick hooks.\"- Punk Rock Theory\n\n\"...(the) tracks mix both pop-punk with the bonfire-style folk, an interesting but wonderful combo. The quintet is definitely a group to be watching for the rest of the year...\" (Rating: 4.5/5)- Musiqtone.com\n\n\"Catholic Guilt's \"A Boutique Affair\" taps into the zeitgeist of distance, isolation, while adding a spirit of uplift and community...deeply melodic, highly energetic rock 'n' roll...\"- PopMatters\n\n\"Catholic Guilt do that thing where they help you pick apart the seams of your barely held-together self worth but make it sound like a right fun time along the way.\"- triple J\n\n\"The group looks at the world with a mix of dismay and hope, as if they recognize that life is difficult but we don’t have to let it kill us.\"- Dusted Magazine\n\n\"Australian group of rockers delivering raw, emotional lyrics amid pounding drums, jangling guitars and sophisticated arrangement.\"- Artistic Echoes\n\n***\n\nwww.catholicguiltmusic.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/catholicguiltmusic\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/catholicguiltmusic\n\nwww.twitter.com/catholicguiltau\n\nWolverhampton, UK's DEARIST Debut New Track (\"Fool's Heart\")\n\nBand's Sophomore LP 'Sonder' Out April 27\n\nWolverhampton, UK rockers Dearist are premiering their new single \"Fool's Heart\" off their upcoming sophomore full-length, 'Sonder,' out April 27 on Spartan Records.\n\nCheck out the track on Substream: https://substreammagazine.com/2018/03/premiere-dearist-fools-heart/.\n\nGuitarist Chris Tucker says: \"This song was a lot of fun to write. Our process in writing has always been to craft the song instrumentally first, melody and lyrics to follow. Instrumentally, I personally wanted to lay a foundation that exploits (vocalist) Adam’s knack for an infectious hook in the chorus but still retain the Dearist sound. When the lyrics and melody were added to this song, we all knew we had something special in \"Fool’s Heart.\"\n\nPre-order 'Sonder' at: http://spr.tn/sonder.\n\nAll pre-orders include an instant download of the song “Drowning” and \"Fool's Heart\" as well as the band’s newly remastered debut album “This House Has No Windows.”\n\nDearist has announced a short run of UK co-headline dates with Leeds' The Lock & Keys, which run April 27-29. See dates below.\n\n4/27 - Leeds, UK - Temple of Boom (The Meatlocker)\n\n4/28 - Luton, UK - The Castle Tavern\n\n4/29 - Wolverhampton, UK - The Giffard Arms\n\nAbout Dearist:\n\nThe UK has always been a breeding ground for rock bands with unique sounds and massive hooks. Enter Wolverhampton's Dearist.\n\nDearist started life as a solo studio project in (lead vocals / guitars) Adam Binder's basement fueled by a creative need to put together an album of songs he wanted to hear. Hundreds of hours of writing and recording would lead to Adam putting together the current 5 piece line up and the 2015 debut album This House Has No Windows. The album gained the band some notable fans in Jeremy Bolm (Touche Amore) and Geoff Rickley (Thursday).\n\nThe band would go on to spend 2016 travelling the length and breadth of the British Isles playing to anyone that would give their unique blend of emo, grunge, and alternative rock the time of day. Regular touring saw the band cultivate a healthy fan base across the UK and their 3 guitar onslaught quickly gained themselves a reputation for being the loudest band on the scene.\n\n\"Coming from Wolverhampton is both a blessing and a curse\" says drummer Jimmy Taylor, \"Wolverhampton was once voted the 5th worst city to live in the world. On one hand it sucks that we live in this dying city where nothing ever happens and where there is no music scene. However on the other hand, because there is nothing going on in our local area, it has always forced us to go and look for music from every corner of the globe and from different eras. Those records then find their way into our songwriting. You’ll find nods to 90's alternative like Oasis and Stereophonics, you’ll hear influence from 2000's emo like Bayside and Taking Back Sunday, but then we're trying to mash that up with something more modern. Something you maybe haven't heard before.\"\n\nAlongside the live shows, Dearist spent 2016 penning ideas for album number two and in January 2017 Dearist hit the studio to record the drums for 12 songs that would make up their sophomore release. The boys then took those drum tracks back to Adam's home studio and spend the next 12 months teasing them and working them into the album that has become to be known as Sonder.\n\n\"The idea for the album title Sonder came really late in the process\" says Adam, \"I realized I was writing a lot of the lyrical content from other peoples perspectives. I had lyrics based on a friend that took his own life. I was singing about what it would feel like to be in a car accident, lying there waiting for the ambulance. I had a song about how my Dad must have felt when he suddenly got taken really ill. I came across this article about new words that came about in 2017 and the word 'Sonder' was in there. Basically it is the realization that everyone else is living a life as complex as your own, full of joys and sadness. It really encompassed the overall feel of the album.\"\n\n\"I had a really clear vision of how I wanted this album to feel and sound\" says guitarist Lee Jarratt. \"I love those albums, where you put them on and its non stop bangers. Albums like Take This To Your Grave by Fall Out Boy, Jimmy Eat World’s Bleed American, Bring Me the Horizon’s That’s The Spirit and the Taylor Swift 1989 album. I wanted to create an album like that, where it just didn't let up, full of choruses and hooks.\"\n\nDearist is a true DIY beast. Not only does singer Adam and drummer Jimmy take on the recording side of the band, but guitarist Lee shoots and edits all the band's music videos. Now armed with a strong sophomore release, a brand new label, and a thrust to tour, 2018 is looking to be a great year for Dearist.\n\nSONDER - \"the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own.\"\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nInstagram\n\nDon't Sleep Releases New Album 'See Change' Via End Hits Records; New \"20/20\" Animated Video Now Streaming\n\nBand consists of Dave Smalley (DAG NASTY, ALL, DOWN BY LAW, DYS) on vocals + bassist Garrett Rothman (Junction), drummer Jim Bedorf, and guitarists Tom McGrath (Very Americans) and Tony Bavaria (The Commercials, Very Americans).\n\n\"Keeping the classic combo of skating and hardcore music alive, Dave Smalley's punk band features a crew of park rippers in the new video for their song \"Dead On The Inside.\"\"- Thrasher Magazine\n\n\"There's a lot of hardcore punk pedigree within the group's ranks. But more importantly than that, Don't Sleep pen fantastic songs.\"- No Echo\n\nDon't Sleep have released their sophomore album, 'See Change' via End Hits Records. The 9-track LP was co-produced by the GRAMMY-nominated team of Carson Slovak and Grant McFarland (August Burns Red, Silverstein)\n\nThe band, made up of Dave Smalley (DAG NASTY, ALL, DOWN BY LAW, DYS) on vocals, bassist Garrett Rothman (Junction), drummer Jim Bedorf, and guitarists Tom McGrath (Very Americans) and Tony Bavaria (The Commercials, Very Americans), are debuting a new animated video for the track \"20/20,\" which is now streaming on PunkNews.Org.\n\nRothman says, “We are excited to introduce our new single “20/20” and the accompanying video. “20/20” is on our “See Change” LP, which drops TODAY on End Hits Records. “20/20” is truly a summer jam – it has a big, anthemic quality to it with an uplifting chorus that everyone can relate to – “someday I’ll be free!” Like any great summer jam, it’s the kind of song that you want to listen to while driving around town with your windows down.\n\nThe video for “20/20” is a montage of Don’t Sleep live shows, but interspersed with scenes from Harrisburg, PA, the hometown of 4/5 of Don’t Sleep. The video was beautifully edited by Josh Nesmith. Josh’s vision resulted in a dreamy, ethereal piece that we are really proud of and truly accentuates the song.”\n\nSmalley says, \"At peace with this reflection/No regrets, no introspection.\" Mortality is a reality of the human experience. We will all die. Some of us too soon (Hendrix, Keith Moon, John Stabb), some living shockingly long (Keith Richards, Willie Nelson). To quote Gandalf from Lord of the Rings: \"All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.\" In this life, we will all make huge mistakes, but most of us will also try hard, try to do better, and do good things that make those around us happier and this world around us a little brighter. So just know that is part of your story, inevitably. That contrast. Pain and redemption. As Eckart Tolle puts it, we need to realize that the pain body wants to define us, but it is not who we are. In life we are working toward true consciousness. \"Another lonely road...someday I'll be free.\"\"\n\nStream the new album 'See Change' HERE.\n\nStream the video track-by-track, featuring shout-outs from Ingo Knollmann (Donots / Duchamp), Tim McMahon (Mouthpiece / Hands Tied), Damien Moyal (As Friends Rust / Culture / Morning Again), Porcell (Youth Of Today / Shelter / Values Here), Greg Polard (Where It Went Podcast), Brett Rasmussen (Ignite), John Ross Bowie (Comedian / Actor), Scott Vogel (Terror / Buried Alive / World Be Free ) and Roger Miret (Agnostic Front) here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG48STX6iW0\n\nAbout Don't Sleep:\n\nWhoever said lightning only strikes once clearly has not met Dave Smalley.\n\nFrom being right in the middle at the birth of US hardcore punk with DYS to creating the blueprint of melodic hardcore with DAG NASTY, from helping to invent pop punk as we know it with ALL to finding himself in the middle of the west coast punk explosion of the 90s with DOWN BY LAW: Smalley was always on the forefront every time hardcore punk stretched its envelope.\n\nWhile others may use a legacy like that as an excuse to take it a little slower Dave Smalley has no intention to rest on his laurels and keeps writing new music and releasing records.\n\nWhen he founded DON’T SLEEP with fellow east coast punk rockers Garrett Rothman, Tony Bavaria, Jim Bedorf and Tom McGrath in 2017 the world was more than excited about seeing him front a fast yet melodic hardcore band again.\n\nBeing motivated by the immense positive feedback DON’T SLEEP was finally ready to release its debut album “Turn the tide” in 2020. And then the world came to a grinding halt. But after the dust settled all five members decided that DON’T SLEEP was too important to not overcome all obstacles thrown in their way.\n\nThe five piece went back into the rehearsal room, finished 8 original songs and added an amazing TOM PETTY cover to the mix. The result is DON’T SLEEP’s second full length “See Change” and it will see the light of day on JUNE 2nd, 2023 worldwide via End Hits Records.\n\nIt is a record that combines all elements you have liked about Dave Smalley’s music in the past while sounding incredibly contemporary in the here and now.\n\n“DON’T SLEEP is very much a combination of five distinct friends coming together and making a unique sound”, Smalley says. “It is a rare thing to have such cool synergy and energy and end up focused like a laser beam. It is powerful, melodic and purposeful. We respect and love the common roots we all grew up in and are coming together to make a sound with that as our foundation, but also looking to the future and growing.”\n\nBig help to make “See Change” sound so fresh and current came from an unlikely pair of producers, the Grammy award winning team of Carson Slovak and Grant McFarland.\n\nGuitarist Tony Bavaria explains the unusual choice:\n\n“While they've worked a lot in the metalcore world (i.e. August Burns Red, Polaris) they've also done some really great sounding rock records for bands like Live, Candlebox, and Everclear. But they are also local hardcore / punk guys we knew for almost twenty years. Knowing how talented they are and the diversity of their work, we really wanted to see what they would be able to bring to the table. It was awesome to have the opportunity to work with them in a world class studio that would probably not be available to a hardcore band like us!”\n\nThe end result couldn’t be more of a testament to the shared chemistry between band and producers. From the blazing hardcore opener “Harrisburg Graves” to the catchy mid-tempo punk rock of “Promise Made”, from the epic chorus of “20.20” to the subtle off beat and reggae leanings of “Love is the suture”:\n\nThere is something here for all Smalley and punk fans, no matter what of his projects you first fell in love with while the powerful modern production sounds very rooted in the here and now.\n\nAlong the catchiness and amazing musical energy DON’T SLEEP’s “See Change” is also full of lyrical inspiration – as you would expect from a band fronted by Dave Smalley.\n\nBassist Garreth elaborates: “I think we've always had the perspective of seeing music and punk/hardcore as a positive force, where the people involved can make a difference in the world around them. It's been reflected in our name and in our album title \"See Change\". If you see injustice or something that needs to change in your surroundings, make it happen, visualize it, \"See Change\", know it's possible, and work to make it better.”\n\nSo, let’s just hope that this lightning will strike again and again.\n\n“See Change will be released worldwide by End Hits Records on JUNE 2nd 2023 on limited colored vinyl with two different cover options (one for North America and one for Europe/UK). The digipack CD version will contain 8 bonus songs that have not been available on compact disc before.\n\nPreorder your copy now from the End Hits Store (EU/UK) or from Deathwish Inc (North- and South America).\n\nDON’T SLEEP are currently planning tours around the USA and Europe/UK to celebrate the release of “See Change.”\n\nwww.instagram.com/dontsleepband\n\nwww.facebook.com/Dontsleepband\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dontsleephxc\n\nhttps://endhitsrecords.com\n\nSeminal Little Rock DIY Queer Tweemo Outfit EVERYONE ASKED ABOUT YOU Releases \"Handsome Beautiful\" The Next Single Off Upcoming 'Paper Airplanes, Paper Hearts' Which Compiles The Cult Favorites' Complete Recorded Works\n\nAvailable As Vinyl 2xLP (+ Digital and Cassette) on September 8 via NUMERO GROUP\n\nIncluded Band's 'Let’s Be Enemies' LP and Their Two And A Half 7\"s Released Between 1997-2000\n\nRemastered from the original DATs for maximum nostalgic crunch, this deluxe 2xLP is housed in a gatefold tip on sleeve and includes a 20-page book crammed with flyers, photos, lyrics, and an extensive essay on this crucial missing link between Midwest emo and the Moog synthesizer.\n\nBand Playing Brooklyn Shows September 8 & 9 at Saint Vitus\n\nWatch The Visualizer for \"Handsome Beautiful\" Here\n\n\"There was never another band that was able to replicate Everyone Asked About You’s sound.

Built around the twin guitar attack of Chris Sheppard and Collins Kilgore, the band was held together by drummer Lee Buford’s pulverizing drums and dusted with Hannah Vogan’s twee-adjacent vocals. Channeling Rainer Maria’s earnestness, the Promise Ring’s knack for melody, and the Rentals’ penchant for synth, Everyone Asked About You the biggest secret to come out of Arkansas since Whitewater.\n\nThe History:\n\nBy 1997, emo was in the early throes of its first evolution since erupting out of the D.C. hardcore scene a dozen years earlier. This new wave was less concerned with its post-hardcore forebearers' political peccadilloes and blood curdling shrieks, favoring instead a light-weight, mix-tape friendly, and hyper-sensitive version of pop punk.\n\nBands like Promise Ring, Get Up Kids, Braid, Mineral, Christie Front Drive, and Rainer Maria were at the forefront of this evolving sound. Little Rock, AR had Everyone Asked About You.\n\nThe band formed in 1996 and consisted of Chris Sheppard, Lee Buford, Collins Kilgore, and Hannah Vogan, who bonded over a shared love for bands like Unwound. John Beachboard and Matt Bradley joined in 1998 contributing to the 1999 release of 'Let's Be Enemies.' Eventually, they incorporated synthesizers into their sound, influenced by bands like The Rentals and Rainer Maria.\n\nThey released their self-titled debut EP in 1997, which featured songs like \"Paper Airplanes, Paper Hearts,\" \"Me Vs. You,\" and \"It's Days Like This That Make Me Wish Summer Lasted Forever.\" The EP received mixed reviews, but the band's dedicated fans supported them.\n\nLyrically their songs explored the trials and tribulations of adolescence, as well as Sheppard's own journey in discovering his sexuality (\"Boston\") and coming out as a gay man.\n\nSheppard, says, “If there's a theme through all of our songs, it's an emotional and physical distance, challenging goodbyes and misunderstandings and terrible communication.”\n\nEveryone Asked About You broke up in 2000, but their music continues to be influential to emo fans around the world. With fewer than 2000 records across their entire recorded output floating around, fans flocked to YouTube and MP3 blogs to download needle-drop rips and sing the praises of Hannah and Chris’s adolescent poetry. And now younger generations have begun discovering the band through social media-- a lost chapter in emo’s pre-mainstream history.\n\nEveryone Asked About You reunited for their first show in 23 years in the winter of 2022, and plan to tour more in the months ahead.\n\nPhoto: @ danielbergeronphoto; Daniel Bergeron 2023\n\n+++\n\n'Paper Airplanes, Paper Hearts'_ 2xLP Tracklist / Credits\n\nA\n\n1.

Really loud.\"- Kansas City Star\n\n\"...the three-piece cut forlorn melodies with serrated guitars like Pennywise chomping after children in 'It'.\"- Chicago Reader\n\n\"From 1993 to 1997, (Scott) Hobart’s three-piece monster rock machine Giant’s Chair spread the gospel of the Kansas City scene across the nation, along with cohorts like Boy’s Life, Shiner and Germbox.\"- The Pitch (Kansas City)\n\nInfluential 90's midwestern emo band Giants Chair is back after a 23-year absence. A new album, 'Prefabylon' will be released on December 6 via Spartan Records.\n\nContemporaries and tour mates of bands such as Jimmy Eat World, Boys Life, The Dismemberment Plan, Hoover, Sweep the Leg Johnny, Cap’n Jazz, Shiner, Boilermaker, and more, Giants Chair released a pair of albums on Caulfield Records in the 90’s and were a part of the early emo scene with acts like Boys Life, Shiner, Christie Front Drive, and fellow Kansas City bands such as Molly McGuire and Season to Risk.\n\nAbout Giants Chair:\n\nIn the midwest in the early nineties, three musicians serendipitously found one another and began to power a sound. This sonic synergy charged not only the band’s own individually-heralded releases but would also influence decades of artists-to-come who would cut their rock-n-roll teeth on Giants Chair records. After years of writing and recording, after innumerable sweaty basement shows, after thousands of miles of highway blur, and a million fragmented memories, lives progressed, and the fire that fueled Giants Chair gave way to new responsibilities — but it never went out.\n\nIn the fall of 1989, Scott Hobart (guitar, lyrics, vocals) and Byron Collum (bass) both arrived to attend the Kansas City Art Institute. After a catalytic connection and several early band iterations in Kansas City, Hobart and Collum opted for a move to Collum's hometown of Green Bay, WI in the winter of 1993 to play with drummer Paul Ackerman. The trio relocated back to Kansas City the following spring as Giants Chair with their debut 7” Hot Boy on Caulfield Records. Soon after the band assembled enough songs to record their first full length album, Red and Clear, a cryptic epic - it was equal parts raw and refined. While many of the band’s peers trended toward post-rock deconstruction in the following years, Giants Chair returned with Purity and Control, the record that solidified the band’s signature balance of tight rhythms and forward melodies — deceptively simple hooks that collide with lush and layered sonic force.\n\nFor more than two decades now these records have lived on turntables, blasted through car speakers, rattled apartment walls, destroyed headphones, and have finally become recognized as the timeless artifacts of emotional experience and endeavor that they are for so many people. Yes, for many, each Giants Chair release serves as a time machine that can instantly transport them back to an earlier memory — a soundtrack for their wobbly path toward adulthood. As decades decay, the path remains, and it is no less mysterious for any of us. Now, in perfect time, 2019 marks the return of Giants Chair with the release of the bands highly-anticipated new album on Spartan Records, Prefabylon. ...and a soundtrack continues.\n\n\"I feel like the band kind of found US again,” says Hobart, “like a two-decade long slap-back echo, and I’m sitting on the couch playing guitar to it. Similar to a lot of people in the world right now, we’re feeling pretty anxious, and I think these songs come from that.”\n\nThematically, as a concept, Prefabylon is rooted in lyrics of their new song “Lost Again” — Lost between ghost towns — prefabulous ruins / makeshift intentions to shelter hope’s fools. “I was thinking about people building lives and meaning out of leftovers -- how hope springs eternal, but sometimes it’s ill-fated,” says Hobart. \"So the title/concept for me is kind of a double-meaning — it calls into question disposable means and values, but also respects that, really, that’s all humans have ever done -- made lives out of leftovers.”\n\nWith all of the the band’s original core components and members still intact (no small feat of itself!) listeners needn’t brace for any departure from the band's signature post-punk DNA. Equal parts early new wave, skate punk, prog, political folk, and 70’s and 80’s radio rock, Giants Chair’s influences can be traced across their now ‘era-transcending’ catalogue. “As a band,” Hobart says “I think we must sound ‘midwestern.' It’s essentially classic, no-frills, rock elements creating a big wall of melody. At turns, the music reminds me of rolling landscape, sky and highways, old factories and farms, distant street lights and radio towers - how these things make me feel. Kind of a lonely, but somehow-hopeful ache while looking west... then the sky shatters. I remember saying at some point early in the music writing that I was hearing AC/DC meets My Bloody Valentine, but I guess we’ve always erred, to some extent, on the side of AC/DC. And maybe more ‘D.C.'- as in District Of Columbia” by now” Hobart laughs.\n\nFans conquer, with Prefabylon, Giants Chair is simply picking up where they left off — the same guys, the same process, the same gear, and the same feel. After a year of intensive writing and focused pre-production, Prefabylon came to life at Weights and Measures Soundlab in Kansas City, MO. with the help of engineer Duane Trower. When the band was finally ready, drums, bass and foundational guitars were tracked live, lightning-in-a-bottle, in two sessions. Over the weeks that followed, vocals and the remaining guitar elements were meticulously added to the mix. “I’m hearing that we sound like we never stopped playing,” says Hobart. “I’d like to think that’s the timeless wonder of limitation that our minimal talents force us to work with. Guitar, bass, drums, mouth. Tape it all together and turn it way-the-fuck up.\"\n\nWhile most listeners will rest easy in the notion of sonic familiarity, those looking for artistic evolution will find it in Prefabylon’s lyrics. \"I didn’t want to write or sing or yell about growing old - as frustrating as it can be,” says Hobart, “so, at first, I think I was going down the old safe road of lyrical crypticism - but, ultimately, I found it hard to be passionate in sheer abstraction. I really felt like I wanted to be more coherent in all this emotionalism. But, while I don’t want to be middle-aged ranting, I also can’t help that the things I’m most passionate about by now, are things about being a 48 year-old father of 2 sons, married for 21 years to the same patient woman, living in a big, rich, wasteful commercial of a country on an ailing planet -- sometimes wishing I could just get in the van with my rock and roll brothers and head West forever.”\n\nWhile time passes for all of us, certain feelings and emotions have the ability to remain constant with the proper amount of stoking - and volume. It is through these feelings, these memories, that glimpses of refuge and hope still shine earnestly. The wheels spin, the cycles cycle, and we all tire, but there is enchantment in things, like these records, these sonic timestamps that point us back to who we were at our best — and our worst. And now we have another. While it’s unlikely that we head west forever, through records like Prefabylon, we can certainly keep that forward spirit alive and burning - maybe laughing back, from time-to-time, at our futures forgotten, before nostalgia kills us.\n\n***\n\nwww.facebook.com/GIANTSCHAIR\n\nKurt Baker Announces New Album 'Rock N Roll Club', Out September 29 on Wicked Cool Records; Pre-order and Stream The Title Track Now\n\n\"What a tune, and what a great freaking band!

Where the music is always loud, the drinks are cheap(ish), and there are always great bands to be seen and friends to meet. Unfortunately in this day in age, The Rock N Roll club is an almost dying institution and this is sad. These clubs are the places where we've grown up, discovered our world of music, and have always let us musicians use their stages to play our songs. We still go there as fans too, to watch our friends and discover new acts. Without them, Rock N Roll - Punk - Alternative culture wouldn't survive. I vividly remember my first time going to a real Rock N Roll club called The Skinny - now Geno's, which coincidentally, the cover of the new album was shot. My world was changed in the best way possible because I finally felt like I could go somewhere where I belonged. This song is dedicated to Kip Brown, who wrote the song but passed away before ever completing it and recording it himself. Groups like Mott the Hoople, Kiss, and the Stooges were the inspiration musically. Under his musical and spiritual guidance from above, I finished up the track with Little Steven and KB Band in the studio, and we are honored to present it to you now, the title track, from the upcoming record - \"Rock N Roll Club\". Peace and Love.\"\n\nOf the video, he says, \"The \"Rock N Roll Club\" is a collection of homemade and fan-shot footage from our incredible tour in Spain this past year. It had been 10 years since the KB Band had toured in Spain together and we were received so well by the amazing friends and fans we have in that country. Every night we'd play Rock N Roll clubs - wild nights filled with laughs, dancing, and more important, the rock n roll music that makes our world go round.

Their second single “Gold Rush” charted on KROQ’s Locals Only, reaching #1 and staying in the Top 5 for nine weeks straight. KROQ’s Locals Only also featured their song “Hijacked” which also took the #1 spot, their second song to top the chart.\n\nBest described as retro rock with a punk edge, Joker’s Hand songs are timeless, and their commercial accessibility reaches across the generations. The band’s explosive live shows coupled with their excellent vocal ability and musicianship has catapulted them above the noise floor of the Los Angeles rock music scene.\n\nThe Asian American duo has been active in the #StopAsianHate movement, recently performing at rallies across the Southland.\n\n***\n\nStream the single \"War Profiteer\" HERE: https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/jokershand/war-profiteer\n\nStream the song on Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/jokershand/war-profiteer/s-DAWz1k5fIA7\n\nStream on New Noise Magazine: https://newnoisemagazine.com/track-premiere-jokers-hand-war-profiteer/?fbclid=IwAR3QluGfYaejNn79DP5uutuIGNtjHjJ1039OINsZAeh76BMYvJAZiW_n8Ws\n\n++++\n\nJoker’s Hand's Kevin Kawano and Matt Lau are admittedly awkward in social situations. Raised with a rigid upbringing, the two rose above their anxieties and created one of alt-punk’s brightest bands.\n\n“Every deck of cards comes with two jokers in it,” Kawano says about the moniker. “The joker cards are cast aside. You don’t expect to use them in a game. I’m half-Japanese and half-white, but my upbringing was more akin to a strict Japanese household. Matt, who is full Chinese, grew up in a similar fashion so we were pushed toward a ‘normal,’ career-driven life. We weren’t raised to take chances or speak our minds.”\n\nAs Joker’s Hand, the duo took a chance with a mélange of genres that are, in turns, buoyant or devastating.\n\nWith their roots in punk rock, rock and hip-hop, the South Bay band explores those genres in their three forthcoming songs, the reggae-tinged “War Profiteer,” the guitar-heavy “Hibakusha” and “Devil’s Nest.”\n\n“These songs are very different sonically,” Kawano says. “‘Hibakusha\" is a harder, faster punk song. ‘War Profiteer’ is a new sound for us. It shows our reggae pop side.”\n\n“War Profiteer” is a sarcastic take on people who profit from others’ suffering.\n\nJoker’s Hand don’t hesitate to show their serious side. “Hibakusha” is a Japanese word that translates to “survivors of the bomb,” a nod to the atom bombs that fell on Nagasaki and Hiroshima.\n\n“That became a blanket statement for survivors plagued with everlasting effects of radiation,” Kawano says. “In the decades following, after the conflict ended, they were shunned by the Japanese who didn’t understand what radiation did.”\n\nThe survivors were unemployable and cast aside in a horrible, cruel fashion. Joker’s Hand covers the Americans’ subsequent visits to Japan when they forced survivors to strip naked in front of a roomful of people and succumb to experimentation, Kawano says.\n\nThe subject has such a grasp of the duo that they’ve played concerts to oppose Asian American violence. It’s a movement that Kawano and Lau are passionate about.\n\n“It’s messed up what’s going on,” Kawano says. “I get that people have been locked away for a year and this has not been easy for anybody. They’re looking for someone to blame because of where the virus came from and, frankly, it didn’t help with that president we had calling it the ‘Kung Flu’ and the ‘China Virus.’ We’re trying to help give a voice to people who may feel threatened by the current political climate and xenophobia.”\n\n“Devil’s Nest” is the oldest song of the three and visualizes hell, which, to Kawano and Lau, is social situations.\n\n“Growing up feeling socially isolated and unpopular from the herd led us to music, but also triggered a fear of letting people in,” Lau says.\n\nThat fear is something the two have worked hard to overcome. At the age of 16, Kawano had life-altering brain surgery.\n\n“That surgery was my first real brush with death,” Kawano says. “It taught me to live for me and not for other people. I started taking chances. My own personal hell is never taking a chance on anything and letting my life pass by.”\n\nThe two met at UC-Santa Cruz film school and released their first EP on March 5, 2020 — just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. It even had some of the top names in music behind it. Producers Steve Ornest and Wyn Davis met Joker’s Hand at Total Access Recording Studios (Sublime, No Doubt, Guns N’ Roses) in Redondo Beach. Despite the pandemic, the single “Gold Rush” hit No. 1 on KROQ’s Locals Only for nine weeks. They had a tour planned, which included several showcases at SXSW, as well as a festival with Sublime with Rome. They were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWith the pandemic waning, Joker’s Hand are proving their music is timeless and their commercial accessibility can reach across the generations.\n\n***\n\nWebsite: www.jokershand.com\n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/JokersHandBand\n\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/jokershandofficial\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jokershandband\n\nRock Ridge Music\n\nWebsite\n\nFacebook\n\nReel Big Fish was one of the legions of Southern California ska-punk bands to edge into the mainstream following the mid-’90s success of No Doubt and Sublime. The band was distinguished by their hyperkinetic stage shows, juvenile humor, ironic covers of new wave pop songs, and metallic shards of ska. The group cultivated an underground following that broke into the mainstream in summer 1997 when their single “Sell Out” became a modern rock radio and MTV favorite. Their appearance in the movie “Baseketball” as the halftime band also gained them more fans and helped the band's popularity to grow. Still fronted by original lead singer and songwriter Aaron Barrett, they continue releasing albums and touring relentlessly, playing more and more countries and bigger venues all over the world.\n\nReel Big Fish recorded its self-released debut album, “Everything Sucks”, in 1995. “Everything Sucks” became a word-of-mouth underground hit in ska-punk and college circles, which gave the band enough leverage to sign with the indie label Mojo Records.\n\nThe label’s president, Jay Rifkin, and former Oingo Boingo bassist John Avila co-produced “Turn the Radio Off”, which marked Reel Big Fish’s first album for Mojo. “Turn the Radio Off” was unleashed in August 1996, and over the next year, the group continually toured in support of the album’s release, expanding their fan base all the while. In spring 1997, the single “Sell Out” began receiving heavy airplay from several influential modern rock stations in the U.S., which soon translated into MTV support for the song’s quirky video. By summer, the song had become a moderate modern rock hit, and the album had charted in the Top 100.\n\nIn 1998 the song “Take on Me” from the “Baseketball” motion picture soundtrack was released as the promotional single for the movie and once again found the band in regular rotation on rock radio and MTV in the USA.\n\nThe Album “Why Do They Rock So Hard” followed a year later, once again enlisting Oingo Boingo Bassist John Avila as producer. The album was not as commercially successful but is still regarded by many fans as the bands finest work. The band filmed a music video for “the Set up (You Need This)”, the only single released from this album.\n\nThe guys wound up on Jive Records in fall 2001 when their current label, Mojo, was bought by Jive’s parent label, Zomba. Reel Big Fish’s first release for Jive, a more rock-oriented record entitled “Cheer Up!”, appeared in mid-2002. This album was very successful in Europe with the video for the single “Where Have You Been” receiving heavy airplay on many music video channels.\n\nLater that same year, RBF did a song for a Rice Krispies called “Snap, Krackle, Pop-punk” which was used in 3 separate commercials. Also that year, they recorded a cover of Toots and the Maytals “Monkey Man” for the Nickelodeon movie “The Wild Thornberrys.” The single for “Monkey Man” was also released in the UK and received heavy radio play as well as the music video being put on heavy rotation on Kerrang TV.\n\nThe band’s next album, the cynical yet catchy “We’re Not Happy ‘Til You’re Not Happy”, was issued in April 2005. Touring continued for the rest of the year, and Reel Big Fish happily parted ways with Jive in January 2006, having wished to be dropped from the label since the “Cheer Up!” release.\n\nIn August 2006, the group self-released a double-disc live CD (along with an accompanying DVD) titled “Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album”.\n\nBarrett said of this album: “We finally captured the energy, excitement, and humor of our live shows that we were previously unable to create in the recording studio environment. And it all sounds really good!”\n\nThe album was very popular with RBF fans and is sometimes referred to as “the Reel Big Fish Stand-up comedy album” because of all the silly stage banter.\n\nThe band returned with some new material in February 2007, splitting an EP “Duet All Night Long” with their friends in Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer. “Monkeys for Nothin’ and the Chimps for Free” followed several months later, marking Reel Big Fish’s first full-length studio release since leaving Jive’s roster, and 2009′s “Fame, Fortune and Fornication” found the band covering songs by the likes of Poison, the Eagles, and Tom Petty.\n\nIn 2010, the band released “A Best of Us for the Rest of Us”. It included a 22 song disc of re-recorded hits and classic fan favorites as well as a bonus disc of 14 Acoustic or “SKAcoustic” versions.\n\n2012 brought their 7th studio album, “Candy Coated Fury” (Rock Ridge Music), an inspired and infectiously catchy return to the hyperkinetic ska and biting wit of the band’s beloved early albums.\n\nIn 2014, RBF released their first Christmas Album, a six-song, digital-only album entitled “Happy Skalidays”. The album included 4 classic Christmas songs and 2 RBF originals.\n\nWith the late-2018 release of the band’s 8th studio LP, “Life Sucks...Let’s Dance” (Rock Ridge Music) Reel Big Fish are finding themselves with a new focus and a renewed sense of purpose, as well as a-- dare we say it-- happier outlook on life.\n\nBarrett says, “We started recording the album in January 2018 and really took our time with it. Our friend and engineer David Irish just finished building his new studio “Pot of Gold” in Orange, CA, and we loved how everything sounds there. There’s just really good energy and good vibes there, plus there’s a really adorable studio kitten named Iggy Fluff there, so we may have accidentally made a positive, happy record instead of a pissed off, hateful record, oops...well, there’s a little pissed off-ness in there and some sarcastic, funny lyrics as usual! Also, I just got married so there might be a few sappy love songs on the album too! Yuck!”\n\nHe adds, “Recording the album with this line up was really fun, we all get along really well these days and everybody was excited to make a new record. Everybody had lots of great ideas and really got creative with everything and I really think it shows.\n\nThe new single “You Can’t Have All of Me,” is a danceable sing-along, catchy, hooky good old Reel Big Fish song. We didn’t reinvent the wheel... We just painted more checkers on it!\"\n\nThe long-running ska heroes, fresh off a summer-long stint on the final cross-country Vans Warped Tour, and appearances at Scallywag! Fest (with Bad Religion, Pennywise, Less Than Jake and The Interrupters) and Sammy Hagar's Hightide Beach Party, remain as popular as ever, as they continue to tour non-stop, playing over 250 shows a year to thousands of loyal fans all over the world, gaining more and more underground popularity as the Ska scene continues to flourish.\n\nJason Blackmore (Molly McGuire) and Mario Quintero (Spotlights) Team Up With New Band SISTERS\n\nUpcoming Debut Album 'Leecheater' (Out August 25) Is A Tour-De-Force of Heavy, Atmospheric Rock\n\nNew Single \"Through The Cracks\" Out Now\n\n\"...very literally sounds like a massive wall of fuzz and distortion...has every bit of that analogue sound that we crave, with swells of guitar feedback and a bass line that is so dirty you’ll need a shower after it enters your ears.

I came up with the riffs for the song the morning of the day before I was flying home from our second recording session. Mario had come down to the studio that morning and I showed him the riffs. While he went upstairs to get coffee, I threw together the structure and then we just recorded it. I walked around the block to come up with the verse lyrics and melodies. We recorded my vocals after we recorded the music and while I was doing my vocals Mario came up with the chorus lyrics and melody. We slapped some vocals on the bridge and did a couple guitar overdubs and voila. Basically it’s a song about a person having a midlife crisis. Or that’s how I perceive it at least.\"\n\nThe album, 'Leecheater,' is a tour-de-force of heavy, atmospheric rock. Featuring powerful, distorted guitar riffs, driving rhythms, and Jason Blackmore’s distinctive vocals, 'Leecheater' is a gripping and immersive listening experience that showcases the band's ability to create big sonic soundscapes that push the boundaries of modern rock.\n\nWith its lush production and dynamic arrangements, 'Leecheater' is a must-listen for fans of heavy, atmospheric music and is sure to cement Sisters' place as one of the most exciting and innovative bands in the contemporary rock scene.\n\n++++\n\nPressing Information\n\nFirst pressing limited to 300 copies:\n\n• Parasite (Violet / Black Quintuple Stripe) (300)\n\nFull color jacket printed on reverseboard stock and full-color printed innersleeve.\n\nThis is a pre-order.

United under a new moniker, Sisters, Blackmore and Quintero have joined forces to bring the best elements of their respective previous projects together to create something new and menacing.\n\nNo stranger to the post-punk world, Jason Blackmore and his band Molly McGuire dominated the early 90's and were considered to be among the early pioneers of the post-punk Kansas City music scene. Frequently pushing boundaries of what was possible in terms of rock music, Blackmore and Molly McGuire helped to inspire a generation of bands (Shiner, Boys Life, Giants Chair) who would go on to become torchbearers themselves. Molly McGuire’s heavy and melodic sound was a precursor to the post-hardcore and emo genres that would emerge later, and their music has been cited as an influence by bands such as Deftones and Hum.\n\nSimilarly, Mario Quintero's lead up to Sisters was equally as prolific. His other primary (and still active) project Spotlights formed in Brooklyn in 2013, and is often described as a mix of shoegaze, doom metal, and post rock. The band has released several critically acclaimed albums and EP's and their music has been praised for its atmospheric soundscapes, heavy riffs, and haunting vocals.\n\nAnd now... Sisters, an amalgamation of brooding nuances, driving rhythms, and distorted guitar riffs that distinctly showcase the stylistic fingerprints of both Blackmore and Quintero. “Around 2008, I wrote a handful of Molly McGuire-esque tunes and hit up Mario to see if he would be down to record them for the hell of it at his San Diego-based studio, Black Box,” says Blackmore. “He was into it and Sisters was born.” Fast-forward. The world shuts down. “When the pandemic hit in 2020, we decided to pick five of our favorite jams and divvy up the lyrics and vocal duties,” Blackmore continues, “then Mario mixed and mastered the songs and we self-released the Make It Hurt EP. After it was released, we immediately agreed that we should make a full-length record. Recording is always fun, fulfilling and therapeutic – and our chemistry is undeniable.”\n\nThe duo's first full length, Leecheater, is a gripping and immersive listening experience that showcases the band's ability to create massive sonic landscapes that press the limits of modern rock. While hard to cleanly label, Leecheater pulls heavily from the more aggressive side of the nineties, but stylistically edges in the direction of bands like Neurosis, The Cure, or Robin Trower. “We really wanted the record to sound different,” says Quintero, “like if an old Minor Threat record was recorded through a Queens of the Stone Age machine – dry, dark, and chunky – I think we nailed it.”\n\nLeecheater is heavy and moody, but still with a strong melodic sensibility. Lyrically the record pulls few punches, taking huge and divisive topics straight on with ruminations on drugs, death, religion, and love. Produced at Quintero’s home studio in Pittsburgh, the majority of Leecheater was recorded live over the course of two sessions. “Recording has become much easier as I get older,” says Blackmore. “I used to get stressed out and uncomfortable because I wanted everything to be perfect, and I had everything pretty much musically orchestrated and mapped out in my head going into a studio [but] Mario is a genius. He is a natural. He has the technical side of recording down. Which I do not. So it's the definition of teamwork. I bring in the songs and he knows exactly how to get the right sounds – when you are recording with one of your best friends in his home studio it's effortless, stressless and magical.”\n\nThe band will be supporting the release with live dates starting on the West Coast in the Fall.

With a live show that is frenetic and intensely interactive, the band's chemistry has been cemented through years of fierce, persistent touring from the dingiest dives to the most massive amphitheaters, helping them attract a worldwide fanbase.\n\n+++++\n\nPersonal growth, rebirth, even revolution – such transformative concepts are the heart of what Soraia is all about. These heady themes inform the songs on Dig Your Roots, the band’s latest album, out March 13 on Wicked Cool Records.\n\n“I look at Dig Your Roots as a continuation of what was begun on Dead Reckoning,” says singer and frontwoman ZouZou Mansour of the new album’s relationship to their 2017 Wicked Cool LP. That record’s release prompted Rolling Stone/Mojo scribe David Fricke to write Soraia’s “searing guitars, burning soul and true CBGB grit…are the rock you need, in your face now.”\n\n“Dig Your Roots is coming to terms with the light and dark inside myself and in the world,” ZouZou shares. “I come from a diverse multicultural and multireligious background – my father was Muslim and Egyptian, and my mother was Belgian and Catholic. I was ‘different,’ and I hid some of my background from people, thinking I wouldn't be accepted. Digging my roots is being proud of who I am, letting it come before me even at times, being proud of where I come from, and asking the listener to do the same.\n\n“Dig Your Roots also refers to loving what grounds you: the people, the lifestyles, the places you live, where you grew up. It’s being willing to dig up your roots and re-plant if where you are no longer keeps you free – metaphorically, of course. Inherently, I want this to be the message of the record: if you're down, get up.”\n\nAs a spiritual descendant of iconic women in rock such as Patti Smith and Joan Jett, ZouZou’s Philadelphia-based band also embodies elements of kindred spirits of the ’90s and beyond - like PJ Harvey and The Kills, with more than a sprinkling of ’60s Garage Rock and Soul. Their primal sonic attack spreads a message of perseverance through trials of love, loss and letting go.\n\nBassist Travis Smith continues to be a crucial root of the Soraia tree, co-writing five of the album’s new songs with ZouZou, including “Superman Is Gone” and “Wild Woman.” “Travis delved into places on this album that we didn't go to on the last record,” she reveals. “That's scary. But he did it, which ultimately made me do it, too. It's like, ‘Hold my hand, we're going into this dark cave, and who knows what's going to happen…”\n\nRoots also finds drummer Brianna Sig with her first Soraia co-write, the enchanting “Don’t Have You.” “Her melody for the choruses reminded me of how The Sirens would lure sailors in Greek mythology,” ZouZou relates. “It was haunting and beautiful – and if Soraia isn't both of those things, then I don't know what we're doing here.”\n\nThe band faced an unexpected challenge when guitarist Mike Reisman, who co-wrote four Dig tracks, including 2019 single “Evergreen,” left the group. “Mike can’t tour for longer periods of time anymore,” says ZouZou. “It hurt. He still works with us and we still connect. But you grow closer with who remains, and grow yourself.” Going forward, Nick Seditious is handling guitar duties.\n\nFurther nourishing their roots is the continued support of Wicked Cool’s Stevie Van Zandt. The label head has been an advocate ever since naming their breakout track “Love Like Voodoo” the Coolest Song in the World on his syndicated radio show and SiriusXM channel Little Steven’s Underground Garage in 2013. In January 2020, Dig Your Roots' opening cut “Dangerous” becomes the tenth Coolest Song they’ve earned.\n\nVan Zandt has even become a creative collaborator, penning “Why” for Dead Reckoning and co-writing two Roots tunes: 2019 Coolest Song “Still I Rise” and forthcoming single “Darkness (Is My Only Candle).” “I trust him more than anyone in knowing what I'm trying to say and who I am,” says ZouZou.\n\nComplementing them in the studio once again is producer/engineer Geoff Sanoff, whose credits include notable work with Bruce Springsteen, Fountains Of Wayne and Dashboard Confessional. “He’s a member of the band when we’re in there,” ZouZou acknowledges.\n\nSoraia has come a long way since their punked-up cover of The Kinks’ “(I’m Not) Like Everybody Else” hit #1 on Rock radio in South America in 2015. Their independently released debut album In The Valley Of Love And Guns from 2013 features five songs co-written with Jon Bon Jovi.\n\n“I'm all about playing a fun song and throwing myself around, that's Rock ’n’ Roll at its heart,” ZouZou remarks. “But I'm also about telling the stories of resurrection and life and hope and darkness.”\n\nThe latest release in Wicked Cool Records’ ongoing partnership with The Orchard as distributor, Dig Your Roots kicks off another busy year for the label, following up the success of 2019 Billboard Heatseekers Top 10 albums by Jesse Malin and The Dollyrots. Both Malin and The Dollyrots are already slated to release new music for the label in 2020, as are Wyldlife, The Empty Hearts, Ryan Hamilton & The Harlequin Ghosts and many more.\n\nSoraia is:\n\nZouZou Mansour: lead vocal, tambourine\n\nTravis Smith: bass, backing vocals\n\nBrianna Sig: drums, percussion, backing vocals\n\nNick Seditious: guitars\n\n+++++\n\nAnd now, the songs of 'Dig Your Roots' in ZouZou’s own words…\n\n1. Dangerous\n\nI was listening to a ton of Jet and The Vines at one point, and just loved the recklessness – especially in the screams on those songs – and the pure Rock eruption of it all. It's less than three minutes and explodes the entire time. “Dangerous” was born from that specific decision to write a song with those kinds of explosive dynamics and lyrics – and as always – easy and passionate conversations about the things we love.\n\n2. Wild Woman\n\nI had been listening to this female preacher talking about being “born inside the wild” and not knowing where you were – but that strong women thrived in the wild. I fell in love with that idea of birthing yourself – which is one way to put it – over and over when you enter into situations you're uncomfortable in, or have never been in. An added bonus is the notion of being a “wild woman” in that way was a different take on the idea I think social consciousness has on being a “wild woman.” Empowering instead of denigrating. Travis had written this swampy, mysterious riff, so we took that and made it the forefront of the song, and took the subject matter – pieced them together – and VOILA! WILD WOMAAAAAAN!!!\n\n3. Evergreen\n\nMike played this riff that became the verses and said he heard this drumbeat like “Howlin’ For You” by The Black Keys for it. I had been watching the movie Black Snake Moan and heard this line that the main female character “had the devil in her.” That conjured up this old South feeling for me, so I wanted to put that in and give it that vibe. The story is told with a sometimes playful and teasing attitude, and sometimes aggressive and frustrated tone. It really felt freeing and gave the speaker the power back she didn't feel she had in the first place.\n\n4. Foxfire\n\nTravis had this intriguing idea of “foxfire” for a title line. I didn't know what it meant, so he told me all about it. It’s this phosphorescent light emitted by certain fungi on decaying timber. It’s beautiful when it glows, but it isn’t real, it’s a momentary thing. And when people would see it in the woods, many got lost being guided by it. We thought it would be interesting to write a song about depression from the standpoint of “foxfire” – or these glimmering thoughts that lead you astray and only give the illusion that everything's alright. The struggle to believe in any one thought, to characterize the confusion of that type of struggle from the speaker's point of view.\n\n5. Darkness (Is My Only Candle)\n\nAgain, a song written almost together in a room. There's a line of a Rumi poem, “Darkness is your candle.” At the time, there had been the Charlottesville riots, and lots of violence that seemed horrifically reminiscent of the racial injustices of the ’60s. I remember thinking “Where are we?” and being really upset about all the hatred and racial slurs. This song came as a result of anger, pain, sadness, worry, and ultimately the idea we can't be separate anymore or stay quiet. It took a few sessions to write because Travis and I were both so impassioned about making sure we told the truth and stayed with the times as we saw them.\n\n6. Nothing Compares 2 U\n\nI had always felt so strongly about the Sinéad O’Connor version of this song. But despite being a big Prince fan, I had never heard his version. When I did, and heard the first line lyric change – “It’s been seven hours and thirteen days” – I knew immediately this was the one. Those numbers alone and the darker, more soulful approach he took to the lyric and melody spoke to me in a different way than the more popular version by Sinéad. In the studio, Geoff Sanoff really wanted to bring this Mott The Hoople vibe to it like “All The Young Dudes” – which added a lot more to our style of approaching it.\n\n7. Superman Is Gone\n\nAnother Travis and I song, this one was specifically about the idea of being high and feeling like “Superman” when you did that first line of anything. I'm a recovering person, so it was important to me that I also tell the story of the anger I had at my father over being absent when I was going through that. I have already forgiven him and me about that, but I wanted to tell the story honestly. And there's a part of me that still questions where were a lot of different people in my life when I was busy getting high. That idea that you wonder where people were and what they were doing when you were hardcore in this addiction – with no feeling attached to it – just a human curiosity.\n\n8. Way That You Want It\n\nIt's really just about this guy who is frustrated by a girl he digs but can't have. It's based lyrically off the same idea as “I Hate Myself For Loving You” by Joan Jett & The Blackhearts, but from the viewpoint of another character – where I'm singing as the storyteller/observer instead of the person it's all happening to.\n\n9. Still I Rise\n\nBased on a Maya Angelou poem. I live my life in no particular time, almost in a time vacuum. And no matter what, you get up. Mike and I had originally written the song, and called it “I Am (Rise).” But Steven Van Zandt got a hold of it and loved the story of the song, so we rewrote the lyrics, and he rewrote the music to it, to really tell the story of people getting up after falling. I had taken a few lines from actual conversations or experiences I had. Then, Steven and I tried to pay homage as much as possible to the original poem. We rewrote it together in an afternoon – one of the best experiences I've had with him.\n\n10. Don’t Have You\n\nThis was officially the last song written for the album. Brianna sent me two separate song ideas that ended up becoming “Don't Have You.” This was also the last song recorded for the album, and Geoff knew right away the approach to the piano. It became something really beautiful, and I wanted to keep it simple and stripped in the front end, so the lyric could pull in the listener. This was about my own heartbreak, and that little feeling of hope and possibility still inherent in the relationship is really powerful in the middle of the song. It was Geoff's idea to speak that part instead of sing it, and I was thrilled with how it came out.\n\n11. Euphoria\n\n“Euphoria” was written by myself and Travis. I loved the bluesy and spacious riff he came up with. I felt it left a space for some sort of testimony – so I told the story of all these experiences smashed together. Though each line seems to stand alone in some parts, they weave a truthful story of this woman coming back from the dead. I love the lyric in this one.

Flexing his musical prowess yet again in a never-before-utilized way, FORGOTTEN SCIENCES showcases Doyle's many vocal and multi-instrumental talents. The songwriting and lyrical content delves into the darker side of human existence, yet the underlying message is a positive one.\n\nDoyle states, “This album is a note to self to stay in the moment and clear of the trappings of time. It is an affirmation that everything important happens in the present moment. Everything is an inside job, and there are no solutions to be found outside our indomitable spirit.\"\n\nForgotten Sciences is available on vinyl:\n\nhttps://mvdshop.com/products/thomas-andrew-doyle-forgotten-sciences-lp\n\nCD:\n\nhttps://mvdshop.com/products/thomas-andrew-doyle-forgotten-sciences-cd\n\nDigital Download Only and Exclusive Bonus Track:\n\nhttps://thomasandrewdoyle.bandcamp.com/album/forgotten-sciences\n\nAbout Thomas Andrew Doyle\n\nBorn Thomas Andrew Doyle in the 1960s in Boise Idaho by two army veterans in a lower-middle-class family, Tad is most widely known for being the frontman and leader of the band TAD. Tad was one of the founding members of the GRUNGE music movement.\n\nHe began his musical passion and career at the age of 5 years old when he would bang on oatmeal boxes and coffee cans trying to emulate his older brother who had a drum set. His formative years were spent first learning how to play the E-flat Tuba in grade five that his grandfather had played in the early 1900s.\n\nHowever, Tad's true passion was for drums and percussion. In grade six he took the next step in his journey by studying the vinyl records of the time and playing along on a set of drums given to him by his grandmother, which he still has and plays to this day.\n\nLater, Tad graduated high school, then continued his education by studying music composition and performance at Boise State University mentored by the nationally known and respected Dr. John Baldwin, a music professor. At the age of 18, he began playing drums in jazz bands and quartets in nightclubs around the Boise area.\n\nLater he played in rock and punk rock bands around the area before deciding to move to Seattle with his band H-Hour in 1986. Enter the story of TAD the band.\n\nTAD (Sub Pop, Giant, East West, Amphetamine Reptile) were one of the heaviest Seattle bands to emerge from the mid to late 80s, fashioning a loud, slow, lumbering grind that unlike many of their peers, was inspired far more by ’70s metal than punk. Devoid of melody and focused on their feral-pounding rhythm and primal-tonal-assault, TAD are still respected and revered as one of the most ferocious bands to come from the U.S. West Coast. Tad’s music simply steamrolled over everything in its way. The band's albums recorded with Jack Endino, Steve Albini, and Butch Vig helped usher in the \"grunge\" movement. A cameo in Cameron Crowe's 'Singles' and tours with the likes of Nirvana, Alice In Chains, and Soundgarden followed, with the band ultimately disbanding in 1999.\n\nIn 2017, Thomas Andrew Doyle (TAD, Brothers of the Sonic Cloth, Hog Molly, H-Hour) went back to his symphonic roots to begin a new musical chapter in his already impressively successful career. Roughly a year later, in April of 2018, INCINERATION CEREMONY was released to the universe as a fresh and very unexpected work. The result took what people thought they knew about the grunge/doom-metal legend and shattered all preconceived notions and perceptions about what he was capable of. Doyle had returned to his formative roots and came forth with a symphonic take on what was going on in his head. Spawned from the dark, tenebrous recesses of Doyle’s psyche, came an immense sound of textures, rhythms, and material suitable for film scores and stand-alone listening, disquieting all who are within an earshot.\n\nPeople who are familiar with his music should expect the unexpected. Doyle’s entry into the world of symphonic composition is no novice attempt. INCINERATION CEREMONY is a musical journeyman’s expression that is genuine, heartfelt, honest, uncompromising, and revelatory. It is superbly visceral in its delivery.\n\nHeralded by many as his finest work to date, Doyle has been called the “musician's musician” by his peers.\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/TadDoyle\n\nLegendary LA Band The Hangmen Releasing 'Stories To Tell' on September 8; First New Full-Length Since 2019\n\nEuropean Tour Dates Announced\n\nStream The Latest Single \"Midnight Riders\"\n\n“...dirty, sloppy, scuzz drenched, spilled beer, piss stained, rawk... They channel the Ramones, Gun Club, Cramps and the Rolling Stones and turn it all into a wild musical slop that gets stuck between your ears!” - Keith Morris (Circle Jerks, Black Flag, OFF!)\n\nPhoto Credit: Melissa Babasin / (L to R) Jorge Disguster: Drums, Vox / Angelique Congleton: Bass, Vox Bryan Small: Vox, Rhythm Guitar / Jimmy James: Lead Guitar\n\nAs musical trends come and go, The Hangmen have remained uncompromising since their formation in 1986. From big money major label deals to debilitating drug addiction, lead singer\n\nBryan Small has continued to charge forward with the headlong momentum of a runaway train.\n\nBridging the gap somewhere between The Gun Club and the Rolling Stones, the band’s latest offering, Stories To Tell smashes together Small's lurid love songs with unsparing, unsentimental blasts that shine a penetrating light into the dark and seedy corners of life. From the melodic “Midnight Riders” to the haunting “On The Outside,” Small delivers an album with a simplicity and depth of songwriting reminiscent of Neil Young and Tom Petty.\n\n_“Midnight Riders is a rite of passage song. It’s the way my friends and I lived in our early days navigating life, being in bands and coping with everything as kids in Hollywood. We didn’t have boundaries. We had mentors who were notoriously fucked up geniuses in our eyes. I’m not surprised by the path we took for ourselves - some made it, some moved home and some died.\"\n\nSmall himself recently relocated after 38 years in Los Angeles to his hometown of Missoula, Montana, so his kids could grow up around family.\n\n“We recorded in different studios over the course of about a year and a half, which is the way some of my favorite albums were made,” reveals Small, “This is the first record since Mike Ness (Social Distortion) produced In The City that I’ve kinda let go of the production and mixing to get a different view of these songs.”\n\nLongtime Hangmen fan Rob Schnapf (Elliot Smith, Beck, X) also stepped in to produce two tracks on Stories: “On The Outside” and “Last Time I Saw You,” a tribute to “Rontrose” Heathman, the former Hangmen and Supersuckers guitar player who passed away in 2020.\n\nStories To Tell also includes a raucous cover of Credence Clearwater Revival’s “Sinister Purpose.” “CCR has always been a part of The Hangmen’s DNA to some extent. It was a bit of an overlooked song that spoke to us. Jimmy James (guitarist) brought it to the band and it was a natural fit.”\n\nStories To Tell will be released September 8, 2023 on Acetate Records. A month-long European tour commences September 13 in Paris.\n\n+++\n\nSTORIES TO TELL PRE-ORDER\n\nLabel site: https://acetate.com/the-hangmen/\n\nBandCamp: https://thehangmen.bandcamp.com/album/stories-to-tell\n\n+++\n\nWHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID:\n\n“I find myself totally fixated by The Hangmen’s dirty, sloppy, scuzz drenched, spilled beer, piss stained, rawk crud noise stylings.

This record is so Hangmen, it hurts - this may just be the best record they’ve ever made. I’ve listened to it 35 times already and I can’t get enough. The hits just keep on coming! 6 stars out of five!!” - Eddie Spaghetti (Supersuckers)\n\n‘The Hangmen’s punk rock ferocity and country/roots music puts them in an artistic class with the likes of other Los Angeles greats X, Gun Club and Social Distortion.” - Vincent Jeffries, Allmusic.com\n\n'STORIES TO TELL' TRACK LISTING\n\n1.

In 1989 they released their self-titled debut produced by Vic Maile, (Motörhead, The Who “Live at Leeds”) before switching to the newly formed DGC Records whose roster included The Nymphs and Nirvana to name a few. That seemed like the perfect landing spot for the band, but unfortunately the Rob Younger (Radio Birdman) produced album Suicide Doors was never released and the band dissolved into addiction.\n\nNot one to be down for long, a newly sober Small started writing again, the result was 2000’s Metallic I.O.U. released on the Los Angeles-based indie, Acetate Records. The Hangmen found a willing accomplice and partner in crime in label owner Rick Ballard, who produced their follow-up, We’ve Got Blood On The Toes Of Our Boots, a live recording of their OOP Capitol Records debut and 2019’s Cactusville. Tours with longtime fans Social Distortion and the Supersuckers followed. Mike Ness would later produce The Hangmen’s 2007 release In the City. “I totally feel like we're kindred spirits,” Small says looking back, adding that both bands emphasize “simplicity, and doing what you do and staying true to that.”\n\nIn 2010, the popular Finnish record label Hype Records released Lost Rocks, an eighteen-song Hangmen retrospective. Shortly thereafter, former Supersucker Ron Heathmen joined the band for 2012’s critically acclaimed East Of Western. 2019 marked the release of Cactusville as well as a performance on legendary European television show, Rockpalast.\n\nDISCOGRAPHY:\n\n1989 The Hangmen\n\n2000 Metallic I.O.U.\n\n2002 We've Got Blood on the Toes of Our Boots 2004 Loteria\n\n2007 In The City\n\n2011 Lost Rocks: Best Of\n\n2012 East Of Western\n\n2019 Cactusville\n\n2020 Thunderhead (single)\n\n2023 Stories To Tell\n\n***\n\nTHE HANGMEN EUROPEAN TOUR 2023\n\n13/09 WED PARIS, FR @ LA DAME DE CANTON\n\n14/09 THU RENNES, FR @ LE NOKTAMBÜL\n\n15/09 FRI St. GUILLES CROIX VIE FRI, FR @ ROCK THE SEA\n\n16/09 SAT PERIGUEUX, FR @ LE MOULIN DU ROUSSEAU\n\n17/09 SUN ZARAGOZA, SP @ SALA Z\n\n19/09 TUE LIERGANES, SP @ LOS PICOS\n\n20/09 WED A CORUÑA, SP @ MARDI GRAS\n\n21/09 THU MADRID, SP @ CLAMORES\n\n22/09 FRI BURGOS, SP @ AMB\n\n23/09 SAT BILBAO, SP @ KAFE ANTZOKIA\n\n24/09 SUN TOLEDO, SP @ PÍCARO\n\n26/09 TUE GRANADA, SP @ LEMON ROCK\n\n27/09 WED BENIDORM, SP @ ROCKSTAR\n\n28/09 THU VALENCIA, SP @ LOCO CLUB\n\n29/09 FRI BARCELONA, SP @ SIDECAR\n\n30/09 SAT MONTPELLIER FR @ SECRET PLACE\n\n01/10 SUN COMO, IT @ JOSHUA BLUES CLUB\n\n03/10 TUE ZAGRED, HR @ HARD PLACE\n\n04/10 WED BELGRADE, RS @ KC GRAD\n\n05/10 THU PRAGUE, CZ @ VAGON\n\n06/10 FRI BERLIN, DE @ WILD AT HEART\n\n11/10 WED HAMBURGH, DE @ APOLLO CLUB\n\n12/10 THU KOLN, DE @ SONIC BALLROOM\n\n14/10 SAT MESSANCY, BE @ BACK TO THE PIPELINE\n\n***\n\nWebsite\n\nUK Garage Rock Trio The Len Price 3 Re-Releases Acclaimed 2007 Debut LP 'Chinese Burn'\n\nAvailable For The First Time On Vinyl with 4 Additional Songs (+ CD/Digital)\n\n\"A straight shot of garage pop, chased by some punk histrionics and gentle psychedelic leanings.

And no one in the 3 is named Len or Price\" - David Fricke / Rolling Stone\n\n'Chinese Burn' the 2007 debut album from acclaimed UK garage rock combo The Len Price 3, has been rereleased by Wicked Cool Records, for the first time ever on vinyl, with 4 songs previously not available on the digital/cd.\n\nOrder the Vinyl/Stream on DSPs:\n\nNorth America - https://orcd.co/chineseburnvinyl\n\nUK - https://orcd.co/chineseburnvinyluk\n\nFrontman Glenn Page says, \"We’ve been really excited about 'Chinese Burn' coming out on vinyl for the first time. A lot of people that come to our shows are vinyl heads - me and Neil are too! It’s great to finally have all our albums in this format and we’re really grateful to Wicked Cool for making it happen.\"\n\nAbout The Len Price 3\n\nWeaned on the raw, passionate, two-minute tunes of the Who, the Kinks, and the Clash, The Len\n\nPrice 3 are a high-energy garage combo from the Medway district of North Kent in the United Kingdom. Comprised of Glenn Page on guitar and vocals, Steve Huggins on bass, and Neil Fromow on drums (no; no one in the band is named Len Price), the Len Price 3 got their start at a bar in Maidstone where bands could pay for the privilege of rehearsing in front of the drinking customers.\n\nWhen the trio were banned for playing too loud, they simply changed their name and booked another gig under the new moniker a few weeks later. Eventually, the band found an audience for their revved-up, no-nonsense sound, and shared stages with a wide variety of noted acts, from the Libertines to The Lovely Eggs.\n\nIn 2005, the Len Price 3 came to the attention of the Australian label Laughing Outlaw Records, who signed the band and released their debut single, \"Christian in the Desert\" b/w \"Dorolea,\" as well as their first album, Chinese Burn. The album received strong reviews and the band toured extensively in the United Kingdom, with airplay and multiple live performances on Radio 2 and Radio 6 as well as going to America for the first time to play the 2006 South by Southwest Music Conference. During that trip, they met Steve Van Zandt who, unknown to the band, had come to see them play at a small bar in Greenwich Village on a Monday night in New York. They were headlining the evening but were disheartened when the entire audience left after the support band finished. Not to be beaten, the band took to the stage and delivered a blistering performance to only the sound man, or so they thought, because at the end of their set, Mr Van Zandt came out of the shadows and offered to sign them there and then to his label, Wicked Cool Records. They released their second LP, Rent a Crowd, in 2007 which was helped along nicely when Southern Comfort used ‘If I Ain’t Got You’ for a global advertising campaign, and was also featured as one of the free to use songs in the popular ‘Rock Band’ game. Their third album 'Pictures' was moving into a slightly slicker and less tethered-to-the-garage-territory. It arrived in early 2010, along with a support slot with Sir Paul McCartney at Hyde Park in London and a mention on the front cover of Rolling Stone Magazine – where David Fricke in his article said of The Len Price 3 ‘ Rock ‘n Roll Don’t Need Saving, The Cure’s Right Here.' Fricke had been to see the band a couple of times during their American travels. After a long break that included a perhaps unsurprising change in labels, the band returned in early 2014 with a new album, Nobody Knows. In an interview with Vice Magazine, Billy Childish described the Len Price 3 as a group who took his songs and simply added a pop edge to them. Angry at the unjust and flagrant untruth, The Len Price 3 shot back with a song about their accuser, \"Childish Words.\" It was the lead-off track on the band's 2017 album Kentish Longtails. At this time, the band also supplied the entire soundtrack for the independent film ‘Pubmonkey’, and the title track ‘Swing Like a Monkey’ was taken from the album. This was followed by extensive touring in the UK and Europe as well as a headline slot in Las Vegas to support both the album and the film. The film is now in the final stages of being approved for release by the streaming services such as Amazon Prime and Netflix.\n\nNow, with over 40K loyal global supporters on the Facebook page and regularly well-attended shows up and down the UK and Europe the band are back with a stripped-down, post-lockdown celebration of all things The Len Price 3 with their new offering, Ip Dip Do. The album was originally sold at gigs on the now retro format of CD as there was no way to get hold of Vinyl quickly enough. The band sold out of the original pressing almost immediately, followed by digital and vinyl releases later in 2022.\n\nNow in 2023, The Len Price 3 are celebrating the re-release of Chinese Burn on the Wicked Cool Label, this time including a gatefold vinyl release. The band did a sold-out launch show in February at the iconic Lexington venue in London to mark the occasion. The album that started the story is now available again, and a whole new generation of LP3 fans are enjoying it for the first time. The band will be promoting the album with shows in UK, Europe, and the US throughout 2023.\n\nFans of The Len Price 3 don’t just like the band, they love it and become loyal followers over many years.

It’s about seeing what you want to see in someone regardless of where it might lead you. Sometimes you find that you hold vastly different definitions of the same words you’re using with someone. Then gradually you realize you’ve been having conversations of pure insanity with them the entire time.\"\n\nStream the single \"The New Low\" on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOBtF5rv6T4&t=3s\n\nStream on DSPs: https://orcd.co/thenewlow\n\nLP available for pre-order here: https://spr.tn/traindodge.\n\nPre-save here: https://orcd.co/thealleyparade.\n\nWhile the band’s collection of canonized albums have become required listening for every budding heavy band since the 90s, and their legacy of hundreds of shows (sharing stages with the likes of Mudhoney, Cursive, Avail, and Botch, to name a few) has impacted thousands, perhaps the biggest mystery surrounding Traindodge is how under-the-radar this band has flown throughout its prolific career. Whether it be a nod to the band’s integrity or an unwillingness to conform for commercial success, as journalist Jason Heller put it, “Unlike the hordes of post-hardcore wannabes who think screams, noise and posing make the band, Traindodge synthesizes brainpower and horsepower into a contorted, rock-heavy wallop that’ll leave you scratching your head as much as banging it.”\n\nIn 1993, brothers Jason and Rob Smith joined bass guitarist Chris Allen in a pre-existing band. Over the next three years, the three musicians connected deeply over a shared love for the harder side of indie rock – Fugazi, The Jesus Lizard, Jawbox, and much of the already buzzing Kansas City scene. After endless amounts of writing and some natural lineup shifting, Traindodge was born.\n\n“At the time, the loftiest goal I had was to go on tour and if we were lucky, make one album. I figured we’d maybe last three to five years. That’s a long time when you’re 22. None of us knew anyone who’d had a band that long,” says Jason Smith (vocals/guitar). “One thing that shifted for me [early on] was realizing that the more I invested myself in the band, the more satisfying it got. Getting on the road and meeting like minded people confirmed for me that even the midwest can seem like a bigger place. Even through the flimsy ‘networks’ we were stumbling through in our first few years, I could gradually see the reality of being that band that traveled around and woke up some unsuspecting crowds. Maybe it’s a defect I have, but I just found that lifestyle really addictive. I still love it. Even in the down times we’ve had, I’ve always felt like I’m where I belong.”\n\nFast-forward twenty seven years later, The Alley Parade is the band’s eighth full length record, and first since 2016. The lineup also features second guitarist Ross Lewis who joined Traindodge full time in 2011. “We’ve been chipping away at writing this record more or less since the last one came out, which, with all of us not in the same city, and a global pandemic to boot, took a sec,” says Rob Smith (drums/synth). “Some of these songs were written in 2017, and some were finished weeks before we went into the studio last year. That gives the newer songs a more spontaneous feel, while the older ones feel a bit more ‘lived in,’ and I think that’s a strength of the record – it is the most imm"
