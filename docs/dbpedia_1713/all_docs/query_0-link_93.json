        "text": "There is something about the oud that awakens the deepest of emotions. Like the sound of an ancient temple gong, it resonates soulfully. It is primarily a modal instrument, using ‘Maqams scales’, a system as complex and varied as the modes used by Coltrane. So, when the chance arose to interview a Jazz oud player, I jumped at it.\n\nMauro Sigura was born in Turin, where he began his Jazz career playing the bouzouki and guitar. Later, he moved to the island of Sardinia where he found a uniquely ancestral form of music, one for which he developed a deep musical connection. Since then, he has performed throughout the world and participated in numerous festivals. His ensembles reach beyond the confines of genre. They have originality, depth, rhythm and groove. Younger listeners especially, are hungry for such music.\n\nI heard Sigura’s current Quartet while judging the Italian-based 7VirtualJazzClub competition. His entry enthused the judging panel and he deservedly picked up first prize in the Pros & Amateurs section. Shortly after, we exchanged contact details and set up the interview.\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nMauro, congratulations again on your, 7VirtualJazzClub Competition win. Your music has a rare beauty which pulls on the heartstrings. It is as if you have unearthed a forgotten memory from the distant past. This effect may be evident because the oud is the forbear of many stringed instruments like the guitar, mandolin, bouzouki, lute etc. It is like an echo flowing through time, bringing past and present together.\n\nQ. Could you tell me what the oud means to you, and why you chose it?\n\nA. First of all, thank you for your kind words! As you said, the oud is an instrument that somehow crosses time, has an ancestral link with the cultures of the past, [it] tells of trade exchanges, travels, and meetings between cultures. I came to oud through bouzouki and Greek music, where it is easy to listen to an oud. Then, I started studying Ottoman classical music.\n\nQ Your last album, Terravetro, paired the oud with a minimalist piano. On your recent album, Dunia, there was a Fender electric guitar and an electric bass. Did you have that relationship between ancient and modern in mind?\n\nA. Yes, all my music always tries to connect distant places not only in space but also in time. everything must tie together, but the challenge is to try to do it in the most natural way possible.\n\nQ. Your recent quartet is great. It could be viewed as either mainstream jazz or as World Jazz. The contrasts and textures are interesting. Especially so with ‘La Danza di Amarech’. Notable are the tight bass lines and edgy drum rhythms, the oud’s earthiness against the electric guitar’s brighter sounds, and that hint of funk over Middle Eastern rhythms and melodies. Could you tease that out and provide an insight into your compositional approach?\n\nA. It depends on the compositions. For example, in ‘La Danza di Amarech’ I started from the bass line and its connection with the drums, the theme came last. I often start from the bass line to then create the theme, then, once a basic theme has been defined, I intervene by inserting more jazz-like modulations. However, it is not a fixed rule, in fact sometimes I have an oud groove or a theme in my mind and that becomes the starting point, or it can start from a traditional rhythm of Ottoman music. For example, ‘Dunia’ is built on a traditional Ottoman rhythm in 10/8, [called] the ‘semai’.\n\nQ. Tell me about your current quartet drummer. She is amazing.\n\nA. Evita is amazing! She has ability,and creativity, she is an excellent composer, so she was able to give us useful advice in [the] studio. In Italy, she plays with the best musicians, such as Enrico Rava, but she often also plays with DeeDee Bridgewater. I saw her play in Sardinia in 2021 and I said: “this girl must play on my record at all costs!” and I succeeded. This year she released her first solo album as a singer-drummer, for Paolo Fresu’s record label. She has a great career ahead.\n\nQ. Do you have any ongoing projects with this particular quartet?\n\nA. It is a quartet that I created for Italy and Western Europe. In fact, with the acoustic quartet, I often play in Eastern Europe and I needed something more attractive to Central-Western Europe. So I’m working to try to propose it to these geographical areas. The album was released on October 8th, so we are still in a phase where Dunia is looking for the best direction.\n\nQ. You record on ’S’Ard’, a Sardinian label but I see you were born in Turin.\n\nAre your forebears from Sardinia?\n\nA. My father was born in Sardinia, but my mother was born near Turin. In 2005 I moved to Sardinia, retracing the path taken by my grandparents in the 1950s, when they left Sardinia to go work in Turin.\n\nQ. Sardinia has produced jazz greats like Paulo Fresu. It evokes an ancient past and a Phoenician connection. The bagpipes may have originated there, but is there an oud tradition?\n\nA. No, there is a tradition of the guitar, but not of the oud, although some elements of the traditional Sardinian guitar certainly have a North African origin.\n\nQ. You have a distinctive sound and approach. Different from Dhafer Youssef or Anouar Brahem. Part of that is due to the pairing of the instruments, but there appear to be regional influences too. Would you like to comment?\n\nA. Yes, certainly, Sardinia, with its ancestral atmospheres, has a strong influence on my compositions. The spaces, the light, the nature are much stronger here than in other parts of Italy and the musical tradition is also very strong, alive and wild and this more or less unconsciously influences me every time. My next challenge will be to look for the influences that Phoenician, Carthaginian and Arab music have left in the Sardinian musical tradition, in particular in the vocal tradition. I would like to start from there, building a Sardinian project that justifies the presence of oud.\n\nQ. Who are your musical influences?\n\nA. Obviously, the ones already mentioned by you Dhafer Youssef or Anouar Brahem influenced me a lot, but also Jan Garbarek and Eivind Aarset. I am used to listening to all good music, from rock, to jazz, to pop to metal and I let myself be influenced by everything without prejudice. I have listened to a lot of Pat Metheny, Miles Davis, Kenny Garrett, but also traditional Greek music (rebetiko), Ottoman classical music, Arabic and Kurdish music, but in general I like all the traditional music. I am very interested in music played with a few simple instruments, especially the music of nomadic people. My music comes out of all this.\n\nQ. I see you studied philosophy. Did any particular philosopher inform your approach to music?\n\nA. No. Perhaps philosophy has influenced my approach to the concepts of my albums. I try to create the album around a concept, but beyond this, no. No philosopher has influenced me by directing me to music.\n\nQ. You performed throughout Europe, but what grabbed my attention was that you performed in Petra, ‘the city that time forgot’. Tell me about that experience.\n\nA. It was an amazing experience! We were invited by the Amman Jazz Festival and the Dante Alighieri Society in Jordan. When they [approached] us about the option for a concert in Petra, I couldn’t believe it. We played for the Bedouin community that lives inside the site. It was a concert for a few close friends, in a unique atmosphere suspended in time. While I was playing I found myself in a sort of emotional trance and I lost the sense of the duration of the concert. It was a strange sensation, but it was as if those rocks were carrying the music forward independently of us [as the players].\n\nQ. Do you see yourself as being in or extending the Sufi oud tradition?\n\nA. I’m very flattered by your question, but I don’t know the Sufi tradition well enough and I always want to have a respectful approach towards those elements of traditional cultures that I don’t know in depth. So, to answer your question I would say no, even if a certain idea of ​​mystical-transcendent trance is present in many of my compositions. If we can take people to another, different, new place, where everyone is on the same level, then we can start talking again.\n\nQ. Who was the vocalist on Dunia and were there any guest artists?\n\nA. Her name is Elena Ledda and she is the most famous Sardinian singer and, also, one of the most famous in the Italian world music panorama. She gave me a great gift of herself by putting her splendid and unmistakable voice in the song. Elena is the only guest in Dunia.\n\nQ. I look forward to hearing more of your albums. Thank you for your time and for the detailed and illuminating answers.\n\nA. It has been my pleasure!\n\nYou can order these recordings from Mauro Sigura’s website, from S’Ard records, or locate them on Deezer, Spotify or Apple Music.\n\nJazzLocal32.com was rated as one of the 50 best Jazz Blogs in the world by Feedspot. The author is a professional member of the Jazz Journalists Association, a Judge in the 7VJC International Jazz Competition, and a poet & writer. Some of these posts appear on other sites with the author’s permission.\n\nKomeda is one of the most intriguing characters in the European Jazz Pantheon. A man referred to as the Chopin of modern Polish music. So, who was he and why did a musician who only released one ‘official’ Jazz album have such an outsized influence on European Jazz? The book I review here answers many of those questions, but it also adds to the mystique. He was an exceptional composer and an innovator but merely a ‘good pianist’. He was shy and hated interviews so the story of his life is mostly fleshed out by others. And, as the narrative unfolds we enter deep inside the creative life and times of Soviet-era Poland.\n\nKomeda died at a tragically early age. A quiet and often distant presence; as if he had some premonition of the difficulties and tragedies that were dogging his every footstep. Functioning as a musician in Soviet-era Poland was never easy; functioning as a jazz musician during an era when jazz was either banned or discouraged all the more so. And the fact that he was closely associated with Roman Polanski and by implication the Manson murders, gives the story a stranger-than-fiction tinge.\n\nThe first chapters of the ‘Komeda’ book begin with hilarious accounts of the first sanctioned Jazz Concert held at Sopot, Gdansk. Before the bands played, the compère had issued guidance to the audience; a how-to guide for jazz appreciation instructing the audience how and when to applaud. They were warned that the music could be challenging and offered various tips on how to react.\n\n‘You are expected to clap, even while the band is playing, but no cat-calling… (You) are also warned not to be alarmed if the musicians walk about on stage during a performance, hum, or even talk to each other while playing.\n\nThe narrator reports later:\n\n‘The authorities are putting their support behind the festival. In mid-July, Komrade Roman Kosznik, chair of the Sopot town council confided in a Przekroj journalist: ‘Personally’, I’ve been interested in Jazz for a while.\n\nAn official had suggested Swanee River as an excellent example of a Jazz tune and so it was played to open the festival. Years later the official was deeply embarrassed to learn that it was not a Jazz tune and that it was played by white men blacked up—the epitome of Western oppression and appropriation. (The tune opens Polish Jazz festivals to this day. It is played no doubt cognisant of the embedded irony.)\n\nThe running of the festival had been left to a tram driver, recently transferred to the Ministry of Culture and Arts and while the committee had planned for 10,000, an estimated 60,000 fans turned up. The word had spread like wildfire and soon there were no hotel rooms left in Gdansk and the tickets had sold out. What had been billed as ‘from Ragtime to Jitterbug’ was something else entirely and was getting badly out of control.\n\nAfter the repressive Stalin years the ‘Khrushchev Thaw’ let a cork out of the bottle and groups of unruly youths dressed in strange costumes converged on the event. There were alarming reports of semi-naked girls roaming the streets and drunken males carrying strange signs with DUPA emblazoned on them (the worst swear word in Polish meaning “arse”). Observing all of this was Komrade Zygmunt Wisniesky who had been sent by the central committee to write a report on the event.\n\nThe festival ran for three days with Komeda’s band stealing the show; the audience had been wildly enthusiastic. Many of the other bands though, were not so accomplished. An official report states that one of the trombone players finished half a bar behind the pianist.\n\nBecause the seating and tickets were sold out before the festival started, the fans who had missed out rioted. Fences were torn down and chaos followed. The officials soon gave up trying to bring about order and spent the next week writing official reports, each blaming the other.\n\nIt is somewhat of a mystery why the festival was allowed to proceed in the first place as it was the same year that the famous Poznan Bread Rebellion occurred and a few months after Khruschev’s astonishing denouncement of Stalin in the Dumas. Perhaps they needed a distraction.\n\nThe narrative jumps about a bit but it doesn’t matter. After the initial chapters on the first jazz festival, we start at the beginning and follow his life to its conclusion.\n\nKrzysztof Trzciński was born in Poznan, Poland in 1931. As a child he contracted polio, and when the war forced his parents to flee the advancing Nazi army, they carried him on their backs. As a disabled child, he turned to music, taught by a Jewish piano teacher (until she was discovered by the Nazis and sent to a concentration camp where she perished). When the Red Army drove Hitler’s army out a few years later, the dangers remained and the family learned that the Russians could be as dangerous as the Nazis.\n\nSections of the book will be of interest to those fascinated by postwar European history. I am. The Poles had long been accustomed to the liberators becoming the oppressors and what we learn in a fragmented fashion is drawn from first-hand accounts. Nevertheless, a vivid picture is painted. We know that Warsaw had been reduced to rubble and then rebuilt by determined Poles. Out of the countryside, they came, with wheelbarrows and picks. Proudly in charge of their destiny – until the Russians returned with their secret police and controlling ways. In those first two years following the war, jazz was allowed, and then, just as suddenly, it wasn’t.\n\nBecause Krzysztof showed an aptitude for music, he was permitted to join a school music programme. Later, he applied to a music academy, but the communist authorities declined the application. Denied that option he studied to become a doctor, but he never wavered from his desire to be a musician, sneaking into the family living room when everyone was asleep and listening to Radio Free America (the Jazz Show hosted by Willis Conover). He and his friends would transcribe tracks by Coltrane or Miles, gradually teaching themselves Jazz.\n\nWhile Jazz had been forbidden under Stalin, attracting harsh penalties, after Kruschev came to power, things became less restrictive (at least in Poland). In August 1956, a miracle occurred, and a Jazz festival was held in Sopot, a beach suburb of Gdansk (the bulk of the Russian advisers had just departed). At that point, Komeda stepped briefly out of the shadows with his student jazz band. The bandstand was a wartime Nisen hut and the fire brigade was sent to neighbouring schools to grab all the chairs available.\n\nAlso at the festival is a school friend of Komeda’s, Andrezj Trzaskowski. His school days recollection is as follows.\n\n‘’I was suspected of being one of a group of conspirators at Sobieski high school where I was a student. Two of my school friends had been planning to rescue one of their fathers from prison… the first one died during the chase; the other boy was executed”.\n\nAndrezj Trzaskowski was released from prison after three months. He passed his exams that year but for political reasons, he did not get a place at the university.\n\nWe don’t learn if the young Krzysztof was caught up in this horror.\n\nTrzaskowsky later became a brilliant and original Jazz pianist and the author of books on musicology. He and Komeda would sometimes swap places at the piano during gigs.\n\nThere is something mystical and otherworldly about Polish Jazz from the Soviet era. That vibe comes through in this book. It was a time when creativity was confined and perhaps because of that, forms of vibrant and original music (and film) flourished underground.\n\nThe book describes the difficulties faced by Jazz musicians and the determination with which they were overcome. The popularity of the 1958 Gdansk festival appeared to have alarmed the officials, but after a year of testy, to and fro debating, they allowed the festival to continue. Jazz was not yet encouraged and the authorities’ tolerance proved to have limits. This is known as the ‘jazz catacombs’ period.\n\nThere were Jazz performances before that first official festival (in the years between Stalin’s death in 1953 and 1956), but it was strictly an underground scene. During this ‘catacomb jazz’ era, musicians honed their skills well away from the public gaze and held invitation-only gigs in their reluctant parents’ basements. Lookouts would be placed in the street and if a policeman approached, they would switch to the Polish version of happy birthday.\n\n“The number of guests is increasing as time went by, with as many as fifty gathering in small thirty square meter rooms. Now and then the doorbell (would) ring unexpectedly. Upon which the musicians would burst into ‘Sto lat’ (happy birthday).\n\nKomeda had recently qualified as a doctor, although he only ever treated one patient. During this catacomb period, the book introduces us to the jazz musicians and friends who would surround him for the remaining years of his life. Most importantly, Jerzy Milian, Jan ‘Ptaszyn’ Wróblewski, Andrzej Trzaskowski and his girlfriend Zofia Lach (soon to be his wife and referred to variously as Zofia, Sosia or Zoska).\n\nIf the band sought permission to travel or lodged funding applications, the requests were usually declined. Zofia would then send a follow-up letter, co-signed by a senior party official (forged). The official who had initially declined the request would then hastily grant it. It was forgery and it was dangerous, but it worked.\n\nKomeda notwithstanding, Zofia gets the most attention in the book. Talented, beautiful and fascinating, but by all accounts troublesome. She managed most of the better Polish Jazz bands (and was on the board of several Jazz organisations). According to the musicians interviewed, she was a brilliant manager, brow-beating reluctant communist officials to get what she needed for the musicians (visas, tours, gigs etc). The musicians, however, were all scared of her as she could also be violent when drunk, especially if a female fan showed too much interest in Komeda.\n\nThe book examines her traumatising childhood years during the horrors of the Nazi regime and this is offered as an explanation of her subsequent behaviour. That sort of childhood would scar anyone.\n\nWhen the Rock era arrived in Poland, there was a clamour to experience it. Zofia had a plan, as she always did.\n\n“Zofia gets colourful shirts for the bands made out of curtains”, They still play Jazz.\n\n.We learn about concerts and festivals and the views of various critics, fans and musicians. There are more riots by DUPA hooligans and endless trouble with the officials, but against that background of poverty and struggle, Komeda is expanding his musical conceptions.\n\nAt one point, there was a cultural exchange festival in Moscow, but the band is denied permission to perform by the horrified bureaucrats. The students have other ideas and set up private gigs in the backstreets. Eager to hear the forbidden music the Russian fans mob the venue.\n\nIt is all worth reading, but I couldn’t wait to reach the chapter covering 1964, the year of the first Warsaw Jazz Jamboree, and most importantly, the year Astigmatic was recorded. I discovered Komeda through this album and it was love at first listening. I probably became aware of it as I browsed through the Penguin Guide to Jazz, my bible at the time.\n\n“We cannot recommend this album highly enough, and we can only envy anyone hearing it for the first time, and with no prior knowledge of Komeda”.\n\nIt was awarded the essential-listening crown in the guide and lauded by others.\n\nWhen Astigmatic was recorded, Tomasz Stańko had only recently joined, and Komeda had been gradually developing his unique free jazz style. While the tune Astigmatic has a basic structure, the piece follows its inner logic, vamps and recurring motifs, probing rhythms, slowing, speeding up and with long passages of ecstatic freedom. It was the beginning of a particular melodic approach to freedom that was very Northern European. Kattorna, the second piece is a model Slavonic masterpiece. Then Svantetic, named after the Swedish poet Svante Foerster (later an adviser to the ill-fated Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme).\n\nA couple of the tunes had been aired at the 64 Jazz Jamboree but with a different configuration.\n\n“All of a sudden Polskie Nagrania wanted to record Astigmatic, Svantetic and Kattorna, right here and now, pronto”.\n\nKomeda frantically gets a band together. Those playing with him at the moment were Tomasz Stanko (t), Zbigniew Namysłowski (as) Rune Carlsson (d) and a bassist from Albert Manggelsdorf’s band, a visiting musician. Immediately after finishing their festival performances, the Jazz musicians dashed over to an improvised studio at the Philharmonic.\n\n“There was no time for rehearsals, we learned it during the hundred minutes of recording. Astigmatic was pure Jazz”.\n\nThis was the only ‘official’ jazz recording that Komeda was to release. There were of course lots of recordings but they were classified as Ballet, theatre or film music, probably to obscure the jazz content. At the time of recording Astigmatic, Polish musicians had only been allowed to travel out of the country for a year (and that was only to Sweden, a neutral country).\n\nAn official invitation from Sweden was sent via the ZSP (The Polish Students Organisation) and this made the trip more acceptable to the authorities as it was viewed as a cultural exchange. The tour was a great success and the Gyllene Cirkeln Jazz Club reached capacity every night, turning away hundreds. A leading critic in Sweden wrote:\n\n‘Anyone who thinks that the Polish quartet are well received just because ‘they are Polish’ is badly mistaken. Komeda’s quartet is ‘really’ outstanding at an international level.\n\nTheir next gig is in the famous Jazzhus Montmartre in Copenhagen, where the fans had been waiting expectantly\n\n‘A week before they arrived at the Jazzhus Montmartre there had been a seven-day screening of Polish Films. The club walls are still hung with posters for (Polanski’s) Knife in the Water and Innocent Sorcerers. The Danish Jazz fans are waiting expectantly for ‘Ballad for Bernt’ and ‘Crazy Girl’.\n\nWhile in Denmark, Komeda records Ballet Etudes. He had been forbidden to record outside Poland but he ignored that instruction. The other event of note was the defection of the band’s bassist Roman Dyląg. Later the band purchases a diamond necklace with their performance fee as there was no ability to exchange Kroner for Zloty. When it was sold back in Poland, much of the money went to the authorities. On subsequent trips they purchased second-hand cars and recording equipment to ship home.\n\nWith a few months left on their visas, although forbidden, Komeda, with Zofia in tow, slips over the border and travels to Amsterdam, then Paris. He has received two film score commissions. This is an important focus in the book. Komeda’s film work offered him security.\n\nHe had once helped a second-year film student, who begged him to write a movie soundtrack. Unsure if it was something he could do, he cobbled together some music and the short film went on to win an award at Cannes. The student film-maker was Roman Polanski. He and Polanski remained close friends after that and Polanski repaid the debt many times over.\n\nPolanski:\n\n‘I was intimidated by him (at first), by his reticence. But he was a shy fellow, who spoke calmly. (He) didn’t make large gestures? He didn’t have a big smile but (it was) a gentle one.\n\nKomeda composed over sixty film scores during the remaining ten years of his life, and this cross-pollination enriched both genres. He worked fast and produced scores that made even average movies great. They were essentially jazz albums, often embedded inside well-written orchestral scores.\n\nBeing a largely self-taught Jazz musician, I wondered if the book would cast a light on where he picked up these arranging skills. No one interviewed can recall him being tutored, it just appeared to come naturally. The one exception is Rosemary’s Baby, where he subbed out a small section of the score to a Holywood arranger, in order to meet a deadline.\n\nThere is something extraordinary about Komeda’s compositions as they are endlessly amenable to interpretation. Edgy modern Jazz ensembles like EABS combine his Ballet Etudes with hip hop and it works perfectly well. Tunes like Rosemary’s Baby ‘Lullaby’, or Crazy Girl can be hummed and are appealing, but underlying that is a degree of complexity. Stańko played the Lullaby years later in his Komeda Tribute, Litania. He was surprised to find that there was an extra bar in the chorus that didn’t follow the form. It was not noticeable unless it was pointed out and slid by subliminally. This kind of device is where tension is created.\n\nI would have liked to learn more from the mouth of Komeda but he hated interviews and seldom spoke to anyone about his creative process. In this, he followed Miles, remaining enigmatic and trusting the musicians to step up and stretch themselves.\n\nFrom that first meeting onwards, Polanski was always in his life whether at work or play. He relied on Komeda to create magic and the musician delivered. As Polanski’s star rose so did Komeda’s and the awards and growing recognition eventually took both to Hollywood. While there, two scores were written, several more were begun, and then tragedy.\n\nAccounts of Komeda’s final days are as eerie a sequence of events as it is possible to imagine. He rented a place in Hollywood Heights and while partying to celebrate the success of Rosemary’s baby, he fell and injured his head. Soon after he slipped into a coma from which he never recovered.\n\nPresent at the fateful gathering were Roman Polanski, the actress Sharon Tate, Gabby Folger and Wojciech Frykowski. Tate, Folger and Frykowski were murdered months later by Charles Manson’s acolytes. Polanski would normally have been at home during the massacre but he was out of the country signing a film contract, in part to raise money for Komeda’s medical care.\n\nThe final short chapters deal with Komeda’s return to Poland by medivac flight and his death soon after. The flight was held up by authorities at the border and many believe this to have been deliberate.\n\nThe joy of being a Komeda fan lies in the musician’s open-ended legacy, and it keeps expanding; as if the cosmos can’t contain it. New compositions come to light and previously unknown recordings emerge. Bands all over the world discover his works and each one interprets the pieces differently, be it hip-hop or with orchestra. His compositions are so well-constructed that the possibilities are endless. And now, thanks to this fascinating biography, we can further appreciate him through the eyes and ears of those who knew him best.\n\nWritten by Polish author Magdalena Grzebałkowska and translated by Halina Maria Boniszewska.

Some of these posts appear on other sites with the author’s permission\n\nThis post is the first of two book reviews. The books I review dovetail as they are part of the same story. Tomasz Stańko and Krzysztof (Komeda) Trzciński were bandmates, but they were more than that. They were innovators and extraordinary musicians, leaving behind them a rich legacy. One that is rightly elevating them to positions of greater significance. Anyone who watched the Homeland series on TV will be familiar with Stańko’s music, even if they don’t know his name. With Komeda, it is the same as his film themes live on in memory.\n\nMy grandmother was Polish. She would probably have disliked the music these musicians created. That combination of melodicism edging on dissonance, but that said, she would have recognised the Slavic modes and rhythms underlying it. Their music draws on the themes and modes of Cold War Poland. You hear fragments of marches, eastern European rhythms, and mostly, you can detect a melancholic filmic quality\n\nI admit to an obsession with Komeda and an enduring one, but why? After all, he only officially released one jazz recording, Astigmatic. That single recording was enough to secure his place in the jazz pantheon, and, like so many others, I was bewitched at first hearing. It begged the question; how could such extraordinary music emerge from such difficult conditions? Jazz in Poland during the Soviet era was either forbidden or marginalised by the state apparatus. The two books I review here provide rare insights into those times by opening a window into the creative life of an extraordinary group of musicians and their willing enablers.\n\nFor years the only sources of information about this era were articles written for papers like the Guardian or Jazz magazines. Fascinated, I wanted to learn more about Krzysztof ‘Komeda’ Trzciński and Tomasz Stańko, so when the English language editions of these two books appeared, I ordered them immediately. They did not disappoint. Each has a different style; one an autobiography, a prompted stream-of-consciousness recollection, the other relying on interviews with musicians, fans and filmmakers (plus assorted private archives).\n\nTomasz Stanko, Desperado, an autobiography:\n\nThe compelling thing about this autobiography is the easy narrative flow. Throughout, Stańko responds fulsomely to the occasional prompts of interviewer Rafał Księżyk. He is a natural communicator, his responses taking us deep inside his creative process. And, unlike Komeda, who was shy and hated interviews, Stańko bares his soul, never dodging awkward topics.\n\nInterviewer: ‘What attracted you to jazz?\n\nStańko: I realise now that I have a penchant for the unstable, the anarchic…this is all nonconformist music.\n\nAnd on life in Soviet Poland,\n\n“The Vodka flowed like a river. During communism, people drank because what else was there to do?\n\nWhen he smoked a joint for the first time, he said: ‘Well, bugger me: that’s my thing”.\n\nHe was desperately poor during his early years as a musician and often homeless, but notwithstanding that, he was a deft navigator when it came to pursuing his musical dreams. He recalls sleeping in a basement storeroom underneath the Klub Hybrydy in Warsaw, where friends had painted a window on a wall to make it more bearable. Musicians were not considered productive and so were not entitled to the accommodation privileges provided to others by the state.\n\nHe began discreetly gigging while still in high school, as jazz was only tentatively emerging from the forbidden and moving into the ‘jazz catacomb’ era. He describes the jazz of that era as a hybrid Trad, rapidly moving towards modern. Like Trzciński (Komeda) he taught himself jazz by covertly listening to Conover’s Voice of America. When he joined the Komeda Quintet a few years later, he and many others had moved through the ‘modern’ styles to become free players (creating a Euro-free style). On this topic, he is illuminating.\n\nRegarding his free-jazz album TWET:\n\n‘I’d laid the groundwork for the quintet. Even the older musicians like Wojciech Karolak who didn’t like free, respected my music. And then playing free became widespread (in Poland). Nowadays, young musicians, whether they’re capable of it or not, are keen to play ‘free’. The less capable the keener they are. Not everybody does it well.\n\nLater\n\n‘Something that had begun in Europe, which they didn’t have in the States. It was a joining-together of melodic playing and free . . . A rather unconventional kind of scale and the particular application of two voices. My signature language is not so much based on scales as on a certain melodic atonality . . . my aesthetic imposes this otherness and accentuates it. I move into the realm of beauty, but at the same time, break it up completely, finding myself in a different world. All my compositions and ballads employ simple ideas, but sometimes a counterpoint will appear that knocks everything sideways. You don’t always hear it consciously, but it works underneath”.\n\nAnd this.\n\n“When we played (free) in the quintet, we completely switched off. Everything worked based on intuitive listening. We were sensitive to delicate nuances which gave us some kind of form to latch onto. Whole structures emerged: some sort of symphony began to take form. But there is a problem with pure improvisation. It is simply the best type of music – if it works. Only, unfortunately, it is beyond our control and so it doesn’t always work. I have had moments of complete freedom and played at my best, except the best moments playing free can’t be repeated. My style (today) uses free with some form.\n\nHe explains that, while they were not playing jazz exactly like the Americans, it came from a related set of circumstances. It may have been different, but of all the European nations, the Poles understand best what oppression means. Polish history can be summarised as a thousand years of suffering. The word Slav is the origin of the word slave.\n\n‘It was a different aesthetic and even though it was an American art form, we had been cut off from the black experience. We had another set of difficult conditions and it is those difficult conditions that created our artists. Free jazz was a kind of underground. It was theatrical as well and it appealed to young people. I sometimes felt a bit strange on the scene, with my romantic melodiousness, but I survived because of the quality of my sound.\n\nThere is no bitterness in these recollections, telling Księżyk that he found constant pleasure in the richness of life. He did not like Moscow-styled communism but considered himself a lifelong lefty.\n\n“I would argue about Communism (as opposed to Socialism) with John Surmon, Peter Brotzmann and Tony Oxley. I’d say it (communism) was all crap. The most interesting people in the West were those with leftist intentions. They were always my best friends and the finest people: intelligent, open, tolerant, and modern, artistically. They were lefties, and it’s still like that. The right in the artistic field is inextricably linked to failure, compromise, a lack of talent.”\n\nThroughout, he comes across as thoughtful and self-aware. As the reader, you are the privileged voyeur, almost holding your breath, not wishing to break the spell. Learning about the structure of his music, gaining insights into his motivations, and sensing what it was like to be an impoverished Soviet-era jazz musician.\n\nHe describes himself as definitely optimistic but with a melancholic nature. He goes on to explain that all Polish music of those times was melancholic. His fellow musicians give a name to this which is zal. Zal is a nostalgia for what you never had – a very Polish concept.\n\n‘(Music) deals with the order of things in its ‘own’ way. It doesn’t need any questions, any words or any conclusions. Creating new worlds and beauty… a state that is both mystical and deep… And which we celebrate without posing those big unanswerable questions.\n\n‘Magic is in the same domain as art. It exists in the mind, externalises itself, interacts with the outside world… Rhythm produces trance, and trance is a response to unease. So we create new worlds and artistic beauty. Improvising is about transcendence.\n\n‘I play motifs, maybe two and then open them out. I create (a) mood, then the magic arrives and I’m lost deep inside the music.\n\nStańko was a musical mystic, extremely knowledgeable about art, poetry, philosophy, the cosmos and science. He draws upon these themes constantly. We learn that he would often visit a galley and sit in front of a painting for weeks until a new tune or album emerged (Dark Eyes). Or contemplate a poem for a long time. An example of this is Wisława, dedicated to his friend the Nobel Laureate poet Wisława Szymborska. He was also fascinated by philosophy.\n\nHe had a fruitful, collaborative and enduring relationship with ECM as well, and his high regard for Manfred Eicher is evident throughout. For fans of ECM these accounts will be illuminating.\n\nI lingered over his every recollection. Chuckled when he described how the Polish free players improvised during the inaugural performance of Penderiki’s modern classical masterpiece, much to his consternation, but the last paragraph was the one I liked the best. The place where I felt that I glimpsed his essence.\n\n‘I am going to keep moving forward because there is a space ahead of me. Like those Portuguese sailors in Lisbon, who stood looking out at the ocean, knowing there is something out there but didn’t know what. They sailed not knowing what but believing that there was something wonderfully mysterious. I still have that sense of mystery knowing that musically something strange is going to happen, that I will be moving into areas (previously) unknown to me. And that is where I will be found.\n\nI have read a lot of Jazz autobiographies and biographies over the years but seldom has a biography spoken to me as powerfully as this. Maybe it was the geek in me, delighting in the words and thoughts of a musician I love. Whatever, I strongly recommend it. Play the albums as they are mentioned and follow a profound musical journey. A very Cold War journey towards freedom and release.\n\nThe English edition is published by Equinox (Series editor by Alyn Shipton, Royal Acadamy of Music, London.

Some of these posts appear on other sites with the author’s permission.\n\nThis interview took place while jazz trumpeter Dave Lisik was in London on study leave. It had been teed up for some time but our plans were interrupted by the chaos that trailed on the heels of Covid. Dave has many strings to bow and not least his role as Senior Lecturer, Coordinator of Jazz composition at the School of Music, Victoria University, Wellington. Among his disciplines, are teaching Jazz pedagogy, composition, theory and arranging. Born in Canada and completing his higher education in various US Universities, he arrived in New Zealand in 2010 and he has remained here ever since, involving himself in a variety of important musical projects.\n\nOn a personal note, there has been a long gap between posts and I appreciate the continued support and blog views during my absence. In July, I contracted a bad case of Covid, which has unfortunately been followed by debilitating Long Covid. I will endeavour to keep writing, my brain allowing, and I have reviews and interviews waiting in the wings. I can not attend live gigs at present, but I have access to various gig sound recordings and lots of review copies of new albums. Again, thanks to those who follow JL32. I appreciate you all. Improvised music is too good not to share.\n\nJL32 Thanks for giving me your time Dave:\n\nI am interested in the teaching connections between Canada and NZ. You, Ron Samsom, and Keith Price, all teaching Jazz studies at New Zealand Universities. A Canadian occupation seems to be occurring.\n\nDL Ha, yeah, Keith is from the same province I’m from and we were friends on FB. He saw the advertisement for Auckland University which I’d posted on my Facebook page. So in that case it was not random.\n\nJL32 Your bio says that your musical education began in the Canadian Education system and I gather that certain places in Canada have an enlightened musical education curriculum.\n\nDL Manitoba, the province where I’m from, has a really strong focus on music education. It was the first place in the world to have a government-sanctioned Jazz curriculum. So pretty much every high school and junior high school had a Jazz band and a jazz curriculum to follow, so I wouldn’t be doing anything that I’m doing now if it wasn’t for that system in place. A lot of people do what they do because they had parents, siblings or a relative exposing them to that, but it wasn’t my experience. My interest in Jazz arose out of the jazz curriculum.\n\nJL32 What was your first instrument?\n\nDL The organ, I took organ lessons from second grade and sixth grade. What we don’t see in New Zealand is elementary-school music. My experience was that in Kindergarten (year one here) we had a forty-minute music class which happened four times in a six-day cycle. So four classes a week from the first day at school. So when ‘band’ starts, everyone knows the basics of theory and practice.\n\nJL32 Learning music is essential no matter what field you’re going into. It gives you life skills, right?\n\nDL Music should be taught more than it is in NZ. I have two daughters and that is a concern, but in my case, what they don’t get in the system, I can supplement.\n\nJL32 In Europe, an appreciation of the creative arts is so embedded in the culture that it is not even a topic of debate. Do you see gradual change happening here?\n\nDL So, we’re running traditional university music programmes throughout the country but we don’t have that (early learning) foundational strength and we are drawing on a smaller base. I do have reason to be hopeful though. I have noticed a considerable uptick in the abilities of university-level students in the thirteen years that I have been here.\n\nIt often feels fragile though, as if it could disappear. Rodger Fox and I have been running the New Zealand Youth Jazz Orchestra for eleven years now but covid meant that we couldn’t run it during the last two years. You build things and it can be sort of precarious unless legislation is in place. Receiving quality students in an intake can depend on having a good teacher in a particular high school and unfortunately, those teachers come and go.\n\nJL32 It has been that way in Auckland as well. A few exceptional secondary school teachers bring on some amazing musicians, and then they leave.\n\nDL I have adjudicated the KBB Music festival for a couple of years and there are like 750 Jazz kids at that festival and 43 Big Bands which means that there are enough people interested in Jazz to proceed from there. If we could get the right material to those students we could create something miraculous in no time. So the bands are there but getting quality pedagogical instruction to those teachers is important, teaching improvisation skills for instance.\n\nJL32 What do think about hybridity because that is attractive to many Jazz students today? Maybe that has always been the case. By its very nature, I believe that jazz has always been open to other influences and forms.\n\nDL I have some students looking into this right now, but some stupid arguments rage on Facebook. You know, ‘what is Jazz’ arguments?\n\nJL32 Yeah, tell me about it, who fucking cares as long as it’s good music informed by Jazz right? There are some notable examples of Jazz students doing very well in the indie-pop or mainstream music world. The tag is less important among younger players. The French group Aquaserge do not tag themselves as Jazz at all, but when you listen it is all there in the harmonies, textured dissonant horn lines with bass clarinet etc,\n\nDL When Jazz trained people play other types of music, I’m thinking the Marsalis Brothers, Chris Potter, Donny McCaslin etc. They bring jazz to a classical or hip-hop project because it is part of them. It might be playing a classical piece slower, whatever.\n\nJL32 Mehldau interpreting Bach, or Jarrett.\n\nDL When someone at the highest level, trained in the Jazz discipline, does something like that, I am endlessly fascinated by it. I think, what can a brain like Brad Mehldau’s bring to bear here? As a composition teacher I look to see if it’s interesting and in the end, that’s all that matters. Every new note and every choice is a chance to be as interesting as possible. Everything else is a tool to that end.\n\nJL32 Any further examples?\n\nDL The best musicians I’ve had the opportunity to record with are New York musicians and most of them are very capable of undertaking projects that are very jazz adjacent, like Seamus Blake and Alex Sipiagin. They do not get enough credit for the capability they possess to play music outside of the genre norms. A restricted view some have.\n\nJL32 In classical, Glen Gould!\n\nDL He was an absolute genius, a Canadian.\n\nJL32 I didn’t know that he came from Canada.\n\nDL Yes, a brilliant and strange dude. Stylistically and in mentality, he was not a Keith Jarrett, but you could almost imagine he could have been with the right influence. Keith Jarrett is one of my absolute favourites and although it’s an overused term, if anyone could be called a genius it is Jarrett. I can listen to that trio for hours at a time, my concentration, unbroken. He didn’t invent the format and plays standards but in an endlessly captivating way. They don’t have to do the expected, it just draws you in.\n\nJL32 And the Sun Bear concerts cut deep.\n\nDL That’s a big box set for sure. I saw him do a solo concert in the Chicago Symphony Hall just before I came to New Zealand and I would have travelled anywhere in America to hear him. People say, what’s your favourite Jarrett but it’s difficult to choose, it’s the body of work.\n\nJL32 Some Jarrett lovers ignore the work he did with Dewey Redman and Charlie Haden and I think, why would you do that? As you say, it’s a body of work. So to get back to your musical journey, it looks like you then headed south, over the border.\n\nDL Yeah I headed just over the border, first to North Dakota. I did my undergraduate studies there and then I completed my masters in Iowa, again south, but not too far from Canada. Then I taught high school for a few years in Canada before heading to Memphis in 2003 to do my doctorate around that time. Post 9/11, I thought, what is it that I wanted to do? It was to write more music, study more and play more trumpet and Memphis was fantastic for that. I was very lucky as I got to study for my master’s and doctorate for free.\n\nJL32 You weren’t tempted by ‘McGill’ in Montreal which has a strong focus on trumpet?\n\nDL I did think about it seriously. I was probably a couple of steps below where I needed to be to deal with McGill as an undergrad. Now, I think about what it would take for my students here in NZ to take that giant leap and consider a McGill or New York. Those seemed pretty insurmountable concepts when I was 17yrs old. I was winning awards at school festivals but there was still a gap to get me to that next level. That was the gap and that is always the gap in Jazz. It goes back to what you learn in a school orchestra, say playing the violin. If you can read music and play then you begin to imagine that you could do that in university. It’s the same deal.\n\nWith a Jazz band, there is this whole other dynamic, being able to play solos and improvising, and if you don’t have that, doing a jazz major may not be on your radar. That’s one of the overlooked components in teaching Jazz at high school. It’s not that you are producing great improvisers, but setting them on that path. A city like Auckland is big enough and vibrant enough to have a vibrant high school jazz scene, involving serious tax dollars to get there, but it’s doable. But I am one step removed from solving that problem, I don’t live there.\n\nJL32 It’s dependent in Auckland, or New Zealand, on being lucky enough to find yourself with a gifted music teacher, one who grasps that (we discuss a few examples of gifted music teachers).\n\nDL Almost everyone in the Jazz world has had the same experience, that they had a great music teacher. And those people inspire, some of their pupils then realise the importance of becoming Jazz teachers and they say, I could be that person. But not many New Zealand Jazz students can imagine themselves as being the Jazz teachers of their younger selves.\n\nJL32 A similar country the size of New Zealand is Norway and they are producing so many great improvisers and probably underpinning that will be lots of great teachers. And they have shown innovation.\n\nDL Some places are more comfortable with a wider variety of improvised forms for sure. Following the more traditional path though. I am a bit cautious about what I advise students to do, a bit more traditionalist I guess. I had a student Henry Sherris, one of the more gifted students to come out of the high school programme. He plays on the recent CD that we released. He didn’t have a strong high school band to participate in, but I taught him trumpet privately for six years. He got a scholarship to the ‘Manhattan School of Music and he’s in his second year there. He left in the middle of 2020 with covid happening. He had a suitcase full of masks and just decided to do it. It was brave. I was very comfortable with where he was at and he has Scott Wendholt as a teacher in the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra.\n\nSo I can simultaneously be impressed with the variety of musical forms on offer (and teach more traditionally) and I am against the idea of a university being solely about training for employment opportunities, but that is still a legitimate concern. It’s an evolving situation and we will see where those who take a less conventional route end up. We have had a few students who got scholarships and ended up in places like the ‘Manhattan School of Music’. And, one has ended up subbing in the ‘Vanguard Jazz Orchestra’ and you are at that level at 23 years old, then I feel comfortable seeing what happens next, but with the knowledge that we didn’t steer them in the wrong direction. If your ambition is to compete with the New York guys, you need to be able to speak the language similarly.\n\nJL32 Do you think that there are less traditional or alternate avenues that allow students to progress to that higher level? Once upon a time, jazz musicians polished their skills on the road. Some say that you should learn the fundamentals and then put yourself in danger and learn by getting your arse kicked by better musicians. (this topic always elicits a variety of viewpoints during interviews).\n\nDL In the classical world there are many opportunities to reach a high level of competency, but I remain unconvinced that people can achieve that high level of competence or speak the language sufficiently unless they go to a New York Jazz school or a handful of other jazz schools. To think that you can do that another way, I’m a little sceptical. But the vast majority of Jazz musicians will maybe never end up with that as their goal (competing with top NY-based musicians).\n\nJL32 New York is certainly the acknowledged nexus, there is a New York sound, but I hear great musicians coming from places like Israel. They come to New York bringing their own thing and interacting and it rounds them. But there are other examples like Chicago, a distinctive sound but very different — a lot of free music. Groups like ‘Irreversible Entanglements’, so maybe it depends on where you think you should be heading.\n\nDL Sure.\n\nJL32 There are the Northern Europeans as well. Germany and the Nordic countries are centres for Jazz innovation. And the UK is often underestimated and I’m hearing some astonishing stuff from there.\n\nDL Oh yeah, My record label SkyDeck just released an album for a young guy who is going to do his master’s at the Royal Academy in London. He’s an alto saxophone player, a pretty interesting young player, an ad-hoc session that they recorded in France, but he’s a Londoner. Yeah, I agree, I’m going to Ronnie Scotts soon because the Mingus Dynasty will be there from New York. Some of the guys with who I did a recording session in December will be there, Alex Sipiagin who I work with a lot, Conrad Herwig and maybe Seamus Blake. I’ve done several recordings using the Mingus Dynasty rhythm section. The recording of Ryan’s that I did in December was probably three-quarters of the ‘Mingus Big Band,’\n\nit will be cool to see Alex again. He and I have done about fifteen CDs since he first came out, but not in person since covid.\n\nJL32 I love Ronnies. It is like the Village Vanguard, it defies conventional wisdom regarding layout etc, your knees are under your chin, and you recall Ronnie joking endlessly about the food, but it has history and magic. Sonny Rollins is said to have locked himself in there one night and composed the Alfy music there as he said the wall oozed the spirit of those who played there.\n\nDL I will be heading there in a day or so.\n\nThere is no clear career path in Jazz like being a doctor, where you study, graduate and get a job at the end of it. It’s more like putting together the pieces of a big puzzle and hoping that when an opportunity arises, you will have done the preparation and will know how to reach out and take it. And every student will have a different idea. Some will do exactly what you say and some will do nothing that you say. Some will come up with stuff you’ve never thought of, some will not go into music and some will, and that’s OK. It is really about preparing students for opportunities.\n\nJL32 Looking through your discography and projects is interesting to see the variety. I detect a direction of travel although there is diversity. I was drawn to the work you did with Richard Nunns and the Canadian pianist Amy Rempel.\n\nDL I arrived in New Zealand in 2010 and recorded that in the first couple of years. And other Rattle releases followed 15 or 16 CDs in one year.\n\nJL32 Oh wow I hadn’t realised it was that many.\n\nDL Rattle had been around for 20yrs at that point and we doubled the catalogue in 1 year. In all 40 releases\n\nJL32 Because you have these strong relationships with well-known trumpeters like Tim Hagens and Alex Sipiagin, you might be leaning more towards writing, arranging and producing.\n\nDL Yeah, I am doing many things at once and also having a young family influences what I do. And to top it off I broke both of my arms last year and I now have a plate in my elbow and a titanium plate in my wrist.\n\nJL32 That’s right, I recall seeing some gruesome FB pics.\n\nDL That made it hard to keep up the necessary practice required for the trumpet. My ability to play is fine but it was the time spent in a cast. The loss of 7 weeks can leave you with a lot of work to catch up on. I’m in London now on research leave so my plan when I get back, is to work on that. But I have some quintet projects coming up where I am the principal trumpeter. I am flexible, on certain projects when with Alex Sipiagin for example, who is one of the best trumpeters alive, I would rather listen to him than me (laughs).\n\nThe project that just came out with the ‘Endeavour Jazz Orchestra’ is something that I have put together specifically for New Zealand composers. Essentially for people who have been my master’s and doctoral students. A few projects are coming up that I will arrange, but these projects are about them, the students I taught. It is part of my contribution as a teacher, to teach them composition skills and to help them to document their work.\n\nThat project was Ryans’ (Ryan Brake) but the next one will celebrate Thad Jones’s 100th birthday. We will use some Thad Jones charts, which are fun to play, but with some peripheral projects that we will hopefully bring some attention to bear.\n\nJL32 With the Thad Jones charts, will you keep the original orchestration or re-orchestrate to suit a particular lineup that you have in mind?\n\nDL We will do what the Europeans do when playing such material. Not slavishly trying to sound like the Mel Lewis or Thad recordings but following the tradition. It will be a fun project and it will involve a few guest artists. Our aim with the ‘Endeavor Jazz Orchestra’ is to create a nice library of releases that are maybe attractive to a broader audience.\n\nJL32 Auckland’s AJO has a similar focus on NZ composers and arrangers, but getting the word out and finding opportunities to play is always a problem for big bands. Your focus is more on bringing on the younger players perhaps.\n\nDL An advantage that I have is that I am supervising the students from undergrad onwards, so we are producing the music and recordings in-house. I try to ensure that the playing is on a certain level and then having a few guest artists elevates the level of the playing. We just got a 4-star review in Downbeat for the album (‘Solipsis’, SkyDeck Music). I know that there are differing views, maybe it’s a tall poppy thing, but some ask, why are you bringing in non-NZ musicians on a project promoting NZ music? I think it elevates the project and I’m into promoting the compositions of the particular artist. That is my way. And other than John Riley, the entire thing was recorded in Wellington.\n\nAlso, locals Nick Granville and Roger Manins play a couple of numbers and they are great. So we certainly don’t think that there are no worthy Jazz musicians in NZ because that would be wrong. For example, Roger (Manins) plays several great solos on that album and in fact he plays great solos on every album he is on. We already know that and Nick (Granville) is a great guitar player and he plays a lot of great written parts as well solos.\n\nJL32 And comping can require skill too.\n\nDL Oh yeah, the role of the guitar, perhaps more so than the piano as a comping instrument, brings so much variety than what is on the written page. With the greatest players, it’s being appropriate for the moment and being able to respond quickly and sensitively. Like John Escreet, the piano player who played on a CD I did with Chris Potter and Alex Sipiagin a few years ago. He is British and I had not played with him before. What he adds to this album every second that he is playing makes you feel like, that’s the right choice every second of the way. On one of Alex’s albums, Chris Potter plays a ridiculous solo and later, at the mixing stage, John suggested that he transcribe it and play along on the keyboard. A week later he comes back and he lays down this technically difficult solo in one take. There is a video of it. So on the album, Chris Potter and John Escreet are playing this ridiculous solo in unison.\n\nJL32 And I see that you are about to release a ‘Porgy & Bess’ project. How is that preceding?\n\nDL We have recorded parts of that already and Alex (Sipiagin) is going to record all of the Miles Davis parts. That will be an interesting album because there are 5 woodwind players, but only one is playing the saxophone. There is a lead alto part, but then clarinets; not really doubling, just flutes and clarinets and there are trombone parts and three french horn parts. It has been a project in the wings for a while, but it is such a beautiful piece of music. It is my favourite of the Gil Evans and Davis albums.\n\nJL32 And it is the ultimate gift as it keeps giving and sounding fresh. I particularly love the Paulo Fresu version with the ‘Jazz Orchestra of Sardinia (featuring David Linx and transcribed from the Evans charts by Gunther Schuller) – and another version by Fresu, ‘Kind of Porgy & Bess’ with unusual instrumentation including Dhafer Yussef on Oud.\n\nDL There will always be people like that, no matter how often you tell them about how much money they will never make. The Chris Potters and others just push past that and achieve excellence. They fall in love with the music and determinedly seek out the information. They have to have that information and there will always be people like that. The impulse has no geographical boundaries. I get requests for trumpet information from places like Kenya.\n\nSome will succeed despite their circumstances but in musical education situations, you don’t want that. You want students to succeed because of the situation.\n\nJL32 Tell me more about your label SkyDeck. Was there a predecessor?\n\nDL I lived in Memphis for 7 years before I came to New Zealand and I released a few quintet CDs and a big band album on a label named Galloping Cow Music, which is still the name of my ASCAP publishing rights. Then I worked with Steve Garden after moving here (discussed earlier) and years later while I was in NY, I decided to push ahead with the Vanguard project, and other projects, many of which had some research funding; so I decided to form my label which is SkyDeck.\n\nMany Jazz artists are taking control of their work these days. I am not collecting any money from people to release their projects, and in some cases, I am paying for distribution, but I have a good job and I can do that. For example, Umar Zakaria’s album a few years ago, Roger Manins was on it and Leo Coghini’s solo albums (JL32 reviewed both). So it’s not about the money when recording these student or former student projects, but about providing the infrastructure.\n\nWe have a nice recording setup in the student union building, which is the big band rehearsal room. There is the essential isolation booth for the drums and we can make as good a recording as anywhere else in the country. The room is pretty dry which is ideal for rehearsing and recording. Some better-known performance rooms are great for chamber music but atrocious for anything with a drum set.\n\nJL32 The Auckland Uni Jazz school also has a good room, which was set up originally for radio orchestras, so ideal. Jazz recording certainly favours some rooms over others. I am more familiar with the old Massey room before you moved up to Victoria.\n\nDL That room wasn’t terrible, but it had some weird steel panels on the wall that would vibrate at certain frequencies. The Rattle recording with Richard Nunns was done there and it turned out well; he was close-miked and we got good sound capture. The one I like best from that era is his ‘Ancient Astronaut Theory’ which is only him. Sometimes up to 50 layers of his instruments; just him with me composing from his sound library.\n\nJL32 So how many albums has SkyDeck released? The Wikipedia page has a list but a few like Thad Jones and the ‘Porgy and Bess’ are still awaiting release.\n\nDL Some are released under my name, some under the Endeavour Orchestra and then there are various artist releases, but I am involved in the post-production work like the mixing, some editing etc. And there were a few duo CDs I released, Bonnie and Clyde, Joust and Nemesis. Those have Dave Kikoski and Alex Sipiagin playing, but my compositions. Then there’s the big band project with Rodger Fox and Michael Housten which I was involved and others. I am playing the trumpet and producing on the Endeavour Orchestra CDs like ‘The Hillary Step’.\n\nJL32 ‘Coming Through Slaughter, the Buddy Bolden album was released as The Dave Lisik Orchestra featuring Tim Hagans. That is so slick. I take it that the name derives from Michael Ondaatje’s book. Another Canadian.\n\nDL Tim Hagans was someone I admired, but I didn’t know him. When I graduated with my doctorate in 2006 I was asked, what was I intending to do with it (the Buddy Bolden project). There were trumpet solos, and the question arose, who would play them? As it was conceived with Tim Hagens in mind, a friend Luis Bonilla, who was in the Vanguard Orchestra knew Donny McCaslin, and he knew Tim Hagans and both agreed to become involved. And suddenly I had a CD which was beyond my expectations with these guys who played at a high level.\n\nUsing ‘Coming through Slaughter’ got me into a wrangle with Ondaaje’s publicist and lawyer, but after a few terse exchanges and a cease and desist letter (which was roundly rebutted by my lawyer), the problem just evaporated. I don’t know if he even knew about it.\n\nJL32 And how about ‘Donated by Cantor Fitzgerald’?\n\nDL That was my 9/11 project. Cantor Fitzgerald was an investment firm which occupied the top floors of the World Trade Centre and lost a whole lot of people. It was a niche story within a bigger story. The album has Tim Hopkins and Colin Hemmingsen on it. It needs a video to go with it and I will probably do that. It is challenging to listen to, like the event. One hour three seconds, one track.\n\nJL32 And can you tell me something about the ‘NZ Youth Jazz Orchestra’?\n\nDL That entity is specifically a youth Jazz Orchestra for high school students. The NZ Jazz foundation has been running that since around 1981. I am the chair of that now and Roger Fox and I have been directing it since 2011. Whereas the Endeavour Jazz Orchestra is the best NZ jazz musicians, Roger Manins, Mike Booth, also, former students of the NZSM like Louisa Williamson (readers should check out her album ‘What Dreams May Come).\n\nJL32 Yes she’s doing very well.\n\nDL So, former pupils like Partick di Somma the bass trombone player and Leo Coghini who you know of and reviewed. Depending on the project and the guest artists involved, the personnel can change. It’s not finalised yet, but we’re hoping to do a thing on Michael Brecker. My all-time favourite musician. He imprinted himself on me at a young age.\n\nJL32 And Randy Brecker are still doing amazing stuff too.\n\nDL Imagine having Michael as a younger brother – there must have been a lot of respect and healthy competitiveness. Sometimes students say to me, why do we have to compare ourselves to everyone else? But I say, not everything is equal. Getting a job in a symphony orchestra is competitive. Music is a craft and if you want to be good, you have to compare yourself to other people. You have to achieve a certain mastery of craft before anyone cares what you have to say as an artist.\n\nI can listen to Chris Potter play in any style because he has mastered his craft. Even the weirdest shit imaginable, but I’m in because I’ve bought into the brand. When I listen to a Jazz musician I can hear if they’ve done their (jazz) homework. The definition of Modern Jazz is music played by Jazz musicians who have emersed themselves in, or studied Jazz; not a particular style.\n\nThere are exceptions such as Jazz musicians playing classical music and deliberately not playing Jazz. But if they want to play some weird multi-metre fusion thing, then they bring their jazz sensibilities to that. Utilising the encyclopedia that’s in their brain. I don’t mind labels, I like labels. Some stupidly argue that we don’t know what bebop is, but we know exactly what bebop sounds like, or hard bop, postbop or swing. We know what instruments are involved, and we know what the melodic and textural content is.\n\nJL32 Lee Konitz or Paul Bley. You need to have some context regarding their journeys and all that preceded them before they arrived at what are atypical sounds. Running over the lines, unusual elided voicings etc.\n\nDL When I was young, it took me a while to understand Keith Jarrett and after listening to a ton of Charlie Parker I could gradually understand the lineage. And to understand Charlie Parker you need to understand Lester Young and swing. I give my students ‘The Complete Roulette Box Set’ of the Basie Band to study. Until you understand Basie you won’t understand Parker or Coltrane.\n\nJL32 And to get Prez you need to listen to earlier players like Bean.\n\nDL A book I helped edit a few years ago was titled ‘Body & Soul – the evolution of a tenor saxophone standard’ (recently up on YouTube). My friend Eric with whom I co-wrote the Village Vanguard Jazz Orchestra book had done a lot of transcription and the first was Coleman Hawkins ‘Body & Soul’, then Lester Young, then Dexter Gorden, Stan Getz, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, Michael Brecker, Chris Potter – nine in all. It is a great book in terms of the history of Jazz. So through this one tune, there is a history of Jazz evolution. What Colman Hawkins was doing had not been done before, that angular approach and change running.\n\nJL32 And notably, one of the most recorded tunes in the history of music.\n\nDL A lot of younger people, and I was the same, don’t want to listen to older music. Perhaps partly because people like Parker never made a Hi Fidelity record. You have to look past the technology to hear what a beautiful sound he had. Louis Armstrong. I mean WW2 movies look grainy and pretty shit, but the world was not actually in black and white then, so a mature evaluation requires you to look past that.\n\nJL32 It’s getting near wrap-up time so name those up-and-coming releases again.\n\nDL We intend to have the Thad Jones mixed by the New Year. The mastering will be done in NY – so we aim for a release in January 2023. Covid delayed the Hillary Step project. On that master’s students wrote many of the charts. I wrote one chart, but we missed the anniversary, but next year is the 70th anniversary of Hillary’s summiting of Everest.\n\nJL32 Anything Else?\n\nDL There’s a John Psathas piece and a Requiem Mass coming up which a student wrote for his father.\n\nJL32 Ok Dave, thanks for your time and commitment and I apologize if my Covid-fogged brain slowed me down. It feels like walking uphill through treacle some days.\n\nTo view Dave Lisik’s discography, go to www.davelisik.com\n\nJazzLocal32.com is rated as one of the 50 best Jazz Blogs in the world by Feedspot.

I mention this, because Dan is somewhat of a troubadour, frequently travelling from country to country and always absorbing the musical influences. He listens carefully, interprets, and then takes it to a new level entirely, and this\n\nbrings something essential to his music. It is not so much a sense of place but a sense of the world at large and its limitless possibilities. Nowhere is this more evident than in his second album ‘Skyness’. Check it out on the streaming platforms, and like me, you will return again and again. It is rare to encounter music with such heart-stopping beauty.\n\nCosta is an interesting interview subject, partly because he is so well travelled, but also because he is expansive and erudite. In fact, he speaks eight languages and judging by his English, many fluently. He is an internationalist and an environmentalist. He is also an advocate for animal rights. All of the above illustrates the point that a good musician is not just about the notes. Character and lived experience are the ‘finishing school. This is refreshing to encounter.\n\nCosta is deeply influenced by Brazilian Jazz, but I can detect other Latin influences like Flamenco and Fado. He is a thoughtful player who makes every note count. His voicings and time feel, especially at the slower tempos, are impeccable. It is no wonder that such fulsome praise is being heaped upon him by the likes of Jazziz, Jazz Word, Jazz Weekly, Musica Brasiliero, New York Music Daily etc.\n\nAnd his collaborations with the likes of Randy Brecker, Seamus Blake, Hermeto Pascoal and the wonderful Ivan Lins have crafted wonder upon wonder. He creates such open vehicles; composed and arranged so as to invite maximum participation. The musicians he has worked with are quick to say so and their praise keeps coming.\n\nHis prior recorded output has set him on an interesting journey, so his newest album ‘Beams’ will be eagerly anticipated. It is about light in its different forms. With him on ‘Beams’ his core trio, John Patitucci and Paulinho Vicente, with guests Mike Stern, Dave Douglas, Dave Liebman, Anne Bocatto, Hermeto Pascoal and Teco Cardoso. The album teaser is posted here and I can’t wait to hear the rest of it. For information on albums and tours, go to his website www.dancosta.net\n\nJL32 Good evening Dan. Thank you for giving me a few hours out of your busy schedule. As a traveller myself, I must say that I am impressed by how much of the planet you have covered to date.\n\nDC Hi John, nice to connect, Yes, I have lived in eight countries and travelled to around 60 as a musician or tourist, but there is still a lot to see. It is an interesting world and I hope to live in more countries and to keep travelling. One of my friends is buying a house but I am not interested in that for me. I think that you need to live in a country for at least two years. That’s how you get to know the culture. It removes the fear of the unknown when you do that.\n\nJL32 Increases empathy and negates racism right?\n\nDC Exactly, music is also a multinational language and one that has many dialects but it brings people together. I like to associate the sounds I hear with colours. Harmony is just colour. I am looking at the painting behind you as we speak and I am immediately thinking of the French impressionist composers.\n\nJL32 The painting is impressionistic and is of forest and sky. I love forests, the older the better.\n\nDC Then you should visit the Amazon. When I was living in Brazil I spent some nights in the Amazon rainforest and in fact the title of my first album ‘Suite Tres Rios’ is inspired by the meeting of two great rivers in the Amazon. These rivers meet but keep their different colours. It’s a fairly unique phenomenon and it is a bit like my parents who each kept their unique cultures intact. That was my experience as I grew up. It was like two rivers meeting and when we moved to France or England new colours were introduced. Each keeps its essence but interacts. So the tunes on that album were inspired by the Amazon. For instance, one track is about the stars above the rainforest, the clearest stars I’ve ever seen.\n\nAnd my album Skyness was inspired by the blue of Greek Island skies. The skies above the Greek Islands are different to other places. (We digress here into a long discussion on sky colours and rivers, so I recommend Cape Reinga where ocean and sea meet, as do the different colours touch each other)\n\nJL32 Tell me about the Brazillian singer-songwriter Ivan Lins. I love his voice and I first encountered him on a recording with trumpeter Paulo Fresu and the Sardinian Jazz Orchestra.\n\nDC I wrote to him asking him if he was interested in recording with me and I was pleased when he replied enthusiastically. He has written many great songs but we settled on ‘Love Dance’ which is one of the most recorded songs in musical history (everyone from Joe Pass, Quincey Jones, Sarah Vaughan and even Sting has recorded it). It is a love song and harmonically it has many interesting twists. He also has a house in Portugal so we recorded there and it was a nice experience as we recorded it in one or two takes. The studio was booked for two hours but most of the time was spent talking. He is a person who likes to be near different oceans or rivers. We had that in common, and we also connected because we like delving into musical styles.\n\nJL32 And you collaborated with Randy Becker (check out the teaser on YouTube). I love that, he is another musician who has an affinity with South American music. Brazilian music is sometimes referred to as the ‘other swing’.\n\nDC Yes, 1917 was the date of the first Jazz recording and also the first Samba recording. So with Randy Brecker, the tune was already recorded on my album ‘Skyness’ inspired by the feeling of closeness to Mediterranean skies and by the notion of international togetherness. I had originally recorded the tune solo, so I wanted to re-release it with Randy and he loved it.\n\nJL32 What a great tune ‘Iremia’ is and how beautifully you both improvise around the melody lines.\n\nDC So he came in on top and it was a special moment for me as he has played with some of the greatest stars in musical history. And many of the people who I recorded my first album with were also on his Grammy-winning album Randy In Brazil. The tune you mention is not Latin but the meaning of the name Iremia is peace in Greek. By coincidence, it was re-released at the moment the war started in Ukraine. It got quite a bit of attention, especially in Italy and it was featured on Sky News. This message of peace should be there at all times, but in times of war, more so. When I wrote it I was living on Paros in the Cyclades Islands, so it is about tranquillity and peace.\n\nJL32 I must ask here. Do you have a working trio or involve different musicians in each project? Or to come at it slightly differently, is there a configuration that you prefer working with, solo, trio, quartet, or larger unit?\n\nDC That is an excellent question. I am comfortable in all formats, in fact, the first concert will be in Hamilton with a big band. I have worked with orchestras but not with my music, but on every album, there is a different type of lineup. I enjoy that.\n\nJL32 I love the tune ‘Skyness’, it is the sheer beauty and architecture of it. Those voicings, the time feel like your left hand is gently pushing at your right hand, conversationally, and by the time Seamus Blake comes in we are mesmerised.\n\nDC My third album ‘Live In California’ was a solo album, my next album will be a trio with special guests. One month ago I recorded in New York with John Patitucci and I enjoyed that. But to answer your question, no particular format and I like to give a voice to everyone.\n\nJL32 I saw Patitucci in a Roman amphitheatre, Verona, with Wayne Shorter, Danilo Perez and Brian Blade. Not an experience that I will forget. What’s the album called?\n\nDC ‘Beams’ as in light, with John Patitucci and Paulinho Vicente as the core trio. The guests are Mike Stern, Hermeto Pascoal, Dave Douglas and singer Anne Boccato. Oh, and the saxophonist Tecō Cardosa, who is the only musician to appear on multiple of my albums. But I would record again with any of the above. I like the Brazilian percussionist Teco Cardosa very much. He is a multi-instrumentalist and plays flute, saxophone and percussion. There is really something special about him. He features in the piece ‘Compelling’ on the second album.\n\nJL32 Yes an amazing and energetic track. People who don’t know this album or that piece need to check it out ASAP (on streaming platforms. Sadly, the physical album is hard to find but I located one).\n\nDC I created a video for World Earth Day which is on my website. That was recorded with Teco on the flute. It is one of my favourite pieces as I really like the fusion of the flute and piano. What do you think about that combination?\n\nJL32 Flute and piano and flute over a modal groove interests me greatly. Although it was always a significant presence in Brazilian Jazz, in American Jazz over the second half of the twentieth century the flute was often regarded as an instrument lacking sufficient expression. People who said that were clearly not paying attention and had not listened closely to Yusef Lateef, or Bennie Maupin. It is now regarded as an essential primary instrument as a renewed interest in Spiritual Jazz is evident. Yes, I love the combination.\n\nDC I have several passions and interests beyond music. Things I have studied at University. I have worked as a language educator, I also studied philosophy for a time and history, both of which are interests of yours, I think. I’ve also worked a lot on environmental issues and especially animal rights. I am a vegetarian. Environmental aesthetics is extremely important and often overlooked. The environment and not only in the ecological sense but in everything that we do. And all of this is linked to my music. They are not separate worlds.\n\nThe new album is called Beams because it is a celebration of light in different forms, the light that shines too and from you. The album refers to physical light for example, the tune ‘Star Dial’ which I recorded with Dave Liebman. Then there is also the more metaphysical light. The light which shines from Animals. I wrote a tune called ‘Paw Prints’ when I was living on Pados, written for a dog that I saw mistreated (a homophone and play on the Shorter standard Foot Prints). And then a tune with Mike Stern called ‘Sparks in Motion’ which is about celebrating the city, the light of a city.\n\nJL32 When you release an album, do you have a preferred label?\n\nDC Self-release gives me my independence. Berkeley these days teaches musicians to do it for themselves and learn about the business that way, rather than waiting for a manager or a label to snap you up. Ethics and proper respect for music should be the impetus. Commodification makes an art form into something else.\n\nJL32 Well, we’ve been talking for hours and I know it’s late there. Thank you for your insights and for your music. I have enjoyed it and I hope that your tour goes well. I am sure that anyone listening to your music live will be as delighted with it as I am.\n\nDC I hope to see you at the concerts, John.\n\nJL32 Ki kite\n\nJazzLocal32.com is rated as one of the 50 best Jazz Blogs in the world by Feedspot.

I want you to have these photos and my story to tell the world – one teacher can grow a new generation’.\n\nThe teacher who the writer alludes to is Alexey Proshenkov and as I write this his exact whereabouts are unknown. Ukrainian men under sixty are unable to leave. He is a gifted Jazz educator. Lyudmila Shekera (who left me the above message), is the mother of three talented children who are musicians. All are being tutored by Alexey and the results of that tuition are noteworthy.\n\nLyudmila’s children are young. Two began lessons at the age of five, the other at age three. The above was Lyudmila’s last message to me. I have not heard from her recently and I worry about her every minute.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine caught most of us off-guard and it has severe consequences for the entire world. It is a living nightmare for those in Ukraine. What I have written arises from online interactions with Jazz industry people and musician friends from the Ukraine region. I write this at their request.\n\nEveryone and everything in Ukraine is adversely impacted by the invasion. It is an unimaginable horror in technicolour, playing out in front of their eyes. With missiles flying and landing amidst the civilian populations, communication is difficult and sporadic. For them, more immediate concerns must take precedence. I have omitted some names and altered a few details at my friends’ request. They are defiant and brave, but it is prudent to be cautious when confronted with a vengeful and tech-savvy superpower.\n\nI have long had contact with Baltic and East European Jazz people, but my contacts list grew bigger while judging the 7 Virtual Jazz Club International Competition. As the New Zealand judge, I was placed among a group of European and American judges: journalists, publicists, broadcasters, jazz educators and industry professionals. We introduced ourselves, participated in a Zoom call, read each other’s bios and friended each other on Facebook. Message comments would light up day and night as we were each oblivious of the other’s time zones. Out of that new friendships grew.\n\nThe entries were of a high standard and they came from every corner of the earth. I loved seeing entries from countries traditionally regarded as jazz outliers such as Belarus, Latvia, Ukraine, Estonia and Taiwan. Non-aligned multilateral diplomacy was at work, Jazz style.\n\nThe Jazz community is highly interconnected and as the covid peak faded, Jazz festivals reopened throughout Eastern Europe. Events were advertised, albums proliferated and the old rhythms of life seemed possible. Ukraine in particular has a growing Jazz community. Sadly, that is now under attack and the creative arts will soon struggle to function. Gigs and livelihoods are disappearing as the inhumane bombardment wrecks havoc.\n\nIn the days following the invasion, I contacted my Ukrainian Jazz friends, not to talk music, but to see how they were. The initial reaction was disbelief. That was soon replaced by anger and resolute defiance. I asked fellow judge Anna Russkevich if she was safe and thankfully she was. I asked her a day later if she was leaving and she informed me that she couldn’t, as a semi-paralysed parent is in her care. She has little option but to stay as the horror descends. Cluster bombs and other munitions regarded as unlawful are falling on schools and civilian populations in that region.\n\nAt another Ukrainian friend’s suggestion, I made contact with a Jazz promoter in Kyiv, who in turn suggested that I talk to a musician on the other side of the city. That interaction was no longer possible as the musician is now active in the citizen’s defence militia. The idea of a peace-loving musician having to put down his instrument and pick up a weapon filled me with unutterable sadness. I was saddened, but I understood.\n\nSome sent me clips of missiles destroying city buildings, the footage of a missile attack on a respected university is particularly horrifying. Nothing symbolises authoritarian aggression quite like an attack on culture and learning. I have many pictures but I have been asked to hide the geolocations. Screenshots will tell the story just as well.\n\nLyudmila is the mother of three extraordinary young Jazz musicians. She speaks eight languages (including Russian). Her family were holed up in a forest hotel outside of Kyiv with forty others, mainly musicians. Instruments had been left behind as there was little room for anything other than clothes and toiletries.\n\nOur exchanges have been extensive and often heartbreaking. She was keen for us to continue messaging as she said it gave her hope. It told her that the world was listening. She and her husband Alexander have sacrificed a lot to nurture their children’s talent and recently that has borne fruit. The children’s band, ShekBand, has a recording contract. I will post a clip or two.\n\nThe recording was organised by a fellow 7VJC judge Patricia Johnson. She is the co-founder of Taklit, a successful publishing and production company based in France. She has worked tirelessly on this project and thanks to her efforts an album will be out shortly. Patricia is not someone to mess about and it would take more than an invasion to stop her. She is irrepressible and it is impossible not to like her. When the album’s out we should all click through and listen, and more importantly, we should buy it. It will likely be a digital release. The project can best be characterised as the future voice of Ukrainian Jazz. It is a marker for promise and hope.\n\nIt is uncertain if the family will be able to escape as the roads are clogged, a curfew is in place and petrol is scarce. There is also constant and indiscriminate shelling. Patricia and I have been on Facetime calls and have messaged frequently as this unfolds. She told me a few hours ago that accommodation has been arranged for Lyudmila in Poland. My fervent hope is that this Jazz loving family reach their safe haven. They symbolise much of what the world needs right now. Music may not be front of mind in the heat of an invasion, but it should be. In music resides hope and sanity.\n\nJL32: Lyudmila, I have been worried about you, we care. Are you OK?\n\nLS: Thank you for checking. You and your country’s support gives me hope.\n\nJL32: You have left Kyiv?\n\nLS: We escaped Kyiv. I am now near (name of town withheld) at a forest hotel, with family, husband, kids and friends. We give shelter to music families and their friends. I stay in touch with Patricia from Taklit. She has all info about the ShekBand album which my children have completed. She helps me a lot. On the last evening before the invasion, we had completed recording and mastering the files for the album.\n\nNow we have a dream which will help us to be strong. You can use my name, my children’s and their music tutor. My children, study Jazz improvisation under Mr Alexey Proschenkov at State Music School #4 Kyiv. Siblings Artem. Anna & Maksym Shekera, Playing together as ShekBand since 2015.\n\nJL32: Hi again. Is all well with you? I fear that the invasion is intensifying.\n\nLS: While it is night here, I can tell you some stories. We gave shelter to some Turkish Journalists and they spread the word and now we get journalists from around the world to stay here as they pass through. We are happy to do that because it helps the world to learn the truth. They are very brave to visit Kyiv right now. John, please use my pictures but just make sure there is no geolocation. It is safer for us.\n\nIn Kyiv, my children have been studying music since five years old. The younger Maksym since he was three. He wanted to be with his brother and sister. My husband Alexander is also a jazz musician, but says, that is his hobby: he loves guitar, plays and sings always when we meet with friends. He is the soul of the company. He works hard every day to give a chance for our kids to have the best teacher. Sometimes he plays and puts compositions up on YouTube anonymously. Alexey Proschenkov the children’s teacher has his own teaching method, he teaches all modern trends, history, composition, children love him. His students win a lot of Ukrainian and international competitions.\n\nOne of my sons had been preparing to go to University this year, where my husband and I were students. But yesterday, the occupiers bombed the TV Tower of Kyiv and the University which was next to it. It was the first time that I cried.\n\nJL32: It is so dreadful and heart-wrenching.\n\nLS: I go and make some food. Thank you for listening.\n\nLyudmila and I had many more exchanges over the next few days and Patricia and I talked for an hour via Facetime about their plight. Over the course of those four days, she sent me 73 pictures. Mainly of her children and their interesting but interrupted Jazz journey. They connect me to the horror unfolding, but they also speak to hope.\n\nFootnote: Minutes before posting this I learned that the family had taken to the road again in a convoy of four vehicles. Because it was proving too difficult to reach Poland, they were now heading for Romania. At each stop, missiles force them to move again. And a piece of good news. Today the family learned that ShekBand has been invited to play in Dublin.\n\nGive Likes to ShekBand. Let the music play on.
