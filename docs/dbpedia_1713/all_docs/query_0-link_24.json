        "text": "This is part two of four. If you haven’t read part one yet, check it out here.\n\n2021 was the year many musicians showed us the works they created during the 2020 pandemic. And since the pandemic is still (somewhat) raging around the world, it’s giving musicians even more time to perfect their craft.\n\nIn 2022, we’re getting several great albums some several great bands and artists, but out of all the albums that are coming out this year, these are the ones you need to keep your eyes on. Here are the most anticipated albums of 2022, in no particular order.\n\nSilverstein\n\nAlbum: Misery Made Me (UNFD)\n\nRelease Date: 5/6\n\nPost-hardcore legends Silverstein are aiming to shake things up on their eleventh album Misery Made Me. Frontman Shane Told put it, “We went into this with no rules and no preconceived notions of what Silverstein is or what it could be. The results are bold. We somehow wrote the heaviest, saddest, catchiest, and most emotional songs in 22 years of being a band…all on the same album. I wanted to explore the meaning of ‘Misery’ as a main theme throughout the album. Despite the mountains climbed and boulders pushed during recent years, we were confronted by the weight and misery of staying relatively in the same place for a long period of time. Finding peace in the reality of this misery became important. The record is about the acceptance of a new reality and adapting to it.” Check out the misery when it drops May 6 via UNFD (Crossfaith, In Hearts Wake, Short Stack).\n\nHot Water Music\n\nAlbum: Feel The Void (Equal Vision)\n\nRelease Date: 3/18\n\nGainesville punk rockers Hot Water Music are planning on an electric return to form on album #9. With The Flatliners’s frontman Chris Cresswell now an official member and the band being on a new label, Equal Vision Records (And So I Watch You From Afar, Hail The Sun, Scary Kids Scaring Kids), HWM are ready to show that they haven’t slowed down for a band that’s nearly 30 years old. The record was produced by longtime producer Brian McTernan (Bane, In Fear And Faith, Strike Anywhere). When it album drops later this month, make sure to get the album New Noise called “a solid album.”\n\nPortugal. The Man\n\nAlbum: TBA (Atlantic)\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\n2017 was a massive year for Alaskan turned Oregonian psychedelic pop-rock band Portugal. The Man. Their eighth studio album Woodstock would become one of their most successful albums to date, selling over half a million copies, and even won them a Grammy for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for “Feel It Still”. Fast forward five years later and no word on a new record. But during the pandemic, they have been working hard on their ninth record, including some new tracks, one, a collaboration with deadmau5, being only available as an NFT. “We’ve been writing a lot of music,” bassist Zachary Carothers told Riff Magazine last April. “We’ve been working on an album for the last couple years and, once again, we just had to overthink it. We strip stuff away; we throw away sessions—kind of like we always do. But we are getting very, very close. We’re getting to the last few weeks. We’re still writing new songs and stuff. We have a real easy time starting songs and incredibly difficult time finishing songs. When it comes to something like this, nobody knows when the song is done. You just have to stop at some point. And we’re getting very close to the stopping stage. But no one can really tell when that is. I know that we do want to get a little bit more on the grid before we release anything, and … kind of figure out the world that we’re coming back to.” Only time will tell when the new record drops.\n\nDrug Church\n\nAlbum: Hygiene (Pure Noise)\n\nRelease Date: 3/11\n\nBack in 2018, I put their third album Cheer as the best album of the year. Will they be able to repeat that feat come years end when Hygiene hits stores this Friday? It’s hard to say right now, especially since we’re only three months in to 2022. Last year, the post-hardcore/grunge act dropped a stupendous EP called Tawny, bridging the gap between Cheer and Hygiene. And it did tie fans over, showing that the band aren’t ready to slow down yet. From what’s been released so far off of Hygiene, it’s gonna be a bonafide hit that no one should sleep on.\n\nEve 6\n\nAlbum : TBA (Velocity)\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nNo one expected Eve 6 to make a comeback. Nearly 20 years after their relevancy ended, the 90s alt-rock act known for their “heart in a blender song” meme’d themselves into popularity when frontman/bassist Max Collins started using Eve 6’s Twitter to create hilarious posts and memes. And somehow this shitposting got the band a deal with rebooted label Velocity Records (D.R.U.G.S., If I Die First, Nate Bergman), who released the band’s latest EP Grim Value last June. It was the band’s first batch of new material since 2012’s Speak In Code album which came out on another oddball label for the band, Fearless Records (Archetypes Collide, Grayscale, Oceans Ate Alaska). They’re gonna ride on this rebirth of fame by dropping a brand new album sometime later this year.\n\nPlacebo\n\nAlbum: Never Let Me Go (Rise)\n\nRelease Date: 3/25\n\nPlacebo are doing a bunch of firsts on their upcoming album Never Let Me Go. For starters, it’s the band’s first album recorded solely as a duo following the departure of drummer Steve Forrest in 2015. Second, it’s their first album under Rise Records (Angels & Airwaves, The Distillers, Merci). Third, it’s their first album in nearly a decade. Heavily inspired by Kanye West’s Yeezus, Rolling Stone called Never Let Me Go “Placebo’s strongest album in years,” packed with songs full of “metallic stoner rock, post-punk and gorgeous piano melodies.” Get this one at the end of the month.\n\nCharli XCX\n\nAlbum: Crash (Atlantic)\n\nRelease Date: 3/18\n\nMeet Charli XCX’s bad side. On her final album under her contract with Atlantic Records (100 gecs, Lizzo, Royal & The Serpent), the pop goddess is going all out, unleashing bangers left and right. The album follows her early pandemic release How I’m Feeling Now and features her “demonically talented” friends, with production Ariel Rechtshaid (Adele, Plain White T’s, Vampire Weekend), Lotus IV (Cash Cash, Ty Dolla $ign, Zedd), Ian Kirkpatrick (Breathe Carolina, Lauv, The Ready Set) and Justin Raisen (Joji, Sharon Van Etten, Yves Tumor), plus appearances by Christine And The Queens, Caroline Polachek, and Rina Sawayama.\n\nBleachers\n\nAlbum: TBA (RCA)\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nAlready? But they just released one! Yup. Apparently, Jack Antonoff, the man behind Bleaches, made a promise on Twitter that a new album would be out this year, tweeting, “i am going to put out a bleachers album this year.” That tweet was posted on New Years Day. If this is going to happen, it will be the shortest amount of time between Bleachers albums. Their third studio album Take The Sadness Out Of Saturday Night coming out last July.\n\nAlbum: THE UNRAVELING OF PUPTHEBAND (Little Dipper/Rise)\n\nRelease Date: 4/1\n\nRecorded over the span of five summer days last year with Grammy-award-winning producer Peter Katis (The Get Up Kids, Interpol, The National), PUP’s fourth album has the band trying some very experimental things. Due to the pandemic, Katis let the Canadian punks stay in his house during the making of THE UNRAVELING OF PUPTHEBAND. This let the band experiment with instruments like pianos, synths and horns. They even remotely collabed with several acts like NOBRO, illuminati hotties, Casper Skulls, and Remo Drive. So far from what we’ve heard, it’s gonna be a masterpiece.\n\nState Champs\n\nAlbum: Kings Of The New Age (Pure Noise)\n\nRelease Date: 5/13\n\nWith their fourth album, Albany pop-punkers State Champs are here to prove they’re the kings of the new age. The band in a press release, “Kings of The New Age is our fourth album, the one that we spent the most time on, and the one that makes the biggest statement. After writing over 30 songs, we narrowed it down to 11 that best represent our mission as a band, and sonically, match the energy level we wanted to captivate heading into this new chapter.” Continuing they add, “KOTNA is a reflection on the past few years during a very weird time,” they continue. “However, it is also a reminder that we’re only here for so long. Although we will always live and learn by trial and error in areas like friendships, family, careers, relationships, etc., there’s no time for toxicity and negativity when a certain opportunity presents itself. Never waste a moment that can be seized. Times are changing, culture is evolving, and we’re happy to provide the soundtrack and let you know that we’re here to stay. Welcome to The New Age.” It’s gonna be amazing.\n\nPart three will come out next week!\n\nPost-hardcore legends Silverstein are getting ready to unleash their eleventh studio album Mercy Made Me. The album drops May 6 through UNFD (Crossfaith, Like Moths To Flames, Yours Truly), marking this record as their second release on the Australian-based label. It was produced by Sam Guaiana (Between You & Me, Like Pacific, We Were Sharks).\n\nShane Told talked about the theme of the album in a press release, stating, “For the first time in our career, we truly put it all out there.\n\nWe went into this with no rules and no preconceived notions of what Silverstein is or what it could be. The results are bold. We somehow wrote the heaviest, saddest, catchiest, and most emotional songs in 22 years of being a band…all on the same album.\n\nI wanted to explore the meaning of ‘Misery’ as a main theme throughout the album. Despite the mountains climbed and boulders pushed during recent years, we were confronted by the weight and misery of staying relatively in the same place for a long period of time. Finding peace in the reality of this misery became important. The record is about the acceptance of a new reality and adapting to it.”\n\nAlong with the album’s announcement was the release of a new single, “Ultraviolet”. Guitarist Paul Marc Rousseau described the track’s meaning. “Ultraviolet being invisible felt like the right way to describe it – to get lost in this unseeable thing. Ultraviolet light also causes physical damage to our skin, so it serves as a sort of ‘proof’ that something invisible like anxiety can hurt us.”\n\nCheck out the music video below, directed by Wyatt Clough (Bearings, The Elwins, Safe To Say nka Locket).\n\nMisery Made Me has some interesting special guests, from Andrew Neufeld of Comeback Kid to R&B singer Trevor Daniel, who got big on TikTok in 2019 with his hit song “Falling“. Check out the track listing below.\n\n1. Our Song\n\n2. Die Alone (feat. Andrew Neufeld of Comeback Kid)\n\n3. Ultraviolet\n\n4. Cold Blood (feat. Trevor Daniel)\n\n5. It’s Over\n\n6. The Altar / Mary\n\n7. Slow Motion (feat. Mike Hranica of The Devil Wears Prada)\n\n8. Don’t Wait Up\n\n9. Bankrupt\n\n10. Live Like This (feat. nothing,nowhere.)\n\n11. Misery\n\nSilverstein will be hitting the United States next month with Beartooth on their Below Tour Part 2 with The Devil Wears Prada and ERRA. Later this year, the band will appear at When We Were Young Festival in October alongside Avril Lavigne, Story Of The Year and My Chemical Romance, and the Emo’s Not Dead Cruise in November with Dashboard Confessional, New Found Glory, and Emery.\n\nCongrats, you survived 2020.\n\nWhile we can talk about how bad last year was, let’s talk about one of the few positives that occurred: sweet albums. Throughout the past 12 months, several bands and artists dropped some stellar pieces of music, and today we will look at 10 of those records, as well as some honorable mentions.\n\nNote: before I continue, let me remind you that this list is my opinion. I haven’t listened to every single album that has come out in the past 12 months, no one has. These are just the albums I enjoyed throughout the year.\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s look at the best albums 2020 gifted us.\n\n10. Enter Shikari – Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible (SO)\n\nIt’s been a long time since I listened to an Enter Shikari record. 2017’s The Spark showed the band swapping their electronic post-hardcore sound for something alt-rock sounding, and they carry that same sound into Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible. While I disliked the change on The Spark, Nothing Is True was able to capture my attention throughout the 44 minute record by adding in some of their old post-hardcore tones. Tracks like “THE GREAT UNKNOWN”, “T.I.N.A.”, “Crossing The Rubicon”, “{ The Dreamer’s Hotel }”, and “thē kĭñg” are some of their finest songs to date. Glad to be a fan again.\n\n9. Four Year Strong – Brain Pain (Pure Noise)\n\nHoly shit this was so worth the five year wait. Worcester’s finest have returned with another heavy-hitter. On their fifth album Brain Pain, Four Year Strong have shown that if something isn’t broken, don’t bother fixing it. With heavy breakdowns worth breaking a bone to in the pit (“Brain Pain”), to pop-punk fueled jams (“Talking Myself In Circles”), Brain Pain is the band’s best album to date. I cannot wait to sing these songs live with a crowd.\n\n8. Taylor Swift – folklore (Republic)\n\nYeah, I’m shocked too. I put T-Swift on a best albums list. But my God is folklore beautiful. Ditching her pop persona for something more folky, Taylor channels in her inner singer-songwriter, making a record (scratch that, two records) that has her dwelling into alt-folk and chamber pop. And she pulls it off so damn well! Album opener “the 1” is a major departure from 2019’s Lover, and every single song blows you away, like the Grammy nominated “cardigan” and the kick ass “the last great american dynasty”. Color me impressed, Taylor.\n\n7. Dogleg – Melee (Triple Crown)\n\nMeet the new faces of emo. Michigans’s Dogleg have proven themselves on their debut record Melee that they are worth checking out. “Kawasaki Backflip” viciously grabs you and doesn’t give you time to breathe as the rest of the record takes you on one hell of a ride. Frontman Alex Stoitsiadis is an excellent songwriter and every song on the record shows how well he is at it. As Pitchfork put it, “It’s a record that’s as melodic as it is physical, where pent-up aggression turns into physical liberation.” Don’t sleep on Dogleg, there’s a reason I put them on last year’s Prenatt’s Picks list.\n\n6. Hot Mulligan – you’ll be fine (No Sleep)\n\nTo quote Pitchfork again, “Hot Mulligan are on that emo bullshit.” The Michigan emo act have grown so much since their debut Pilot back in 2018, but they still have some time to grow. While it’s not a solid record like Dogleg’s Melee, it is a fun record, with songs about cars, faded pictures, and not fucking up. It’s their finest album to date, and I can’t wait for what they have in store next. Shoutout to Hot Mulligan Tadesposting.\n\n5. Dance Gavin Dance – Afterburner (Rise)\n\n2020 was supposed to be Dance Gavin Dance’s year. With several festivals lined up and a tour with Bilmuri already being advertised, COVID-19 had to kill all of that. So the legendary post-hardcore act did a livestream show (with a second one in December for Tree City Sessions 2). And on those livestreams, we heard some songs off of their ninth studio album Afterburner. And wow, Afterburner is one of DGD’s most unique records to date. Mixing in elements of pop, Latin, funk, and rap, DGD created something that Kill Your Stereo put as “intricate, catchy, emotional and deceptively complex.” Plus, hearing Tilian Pearson scream again gives me Tides Of Man flashbacks (see “Lyrics Lie” and “Prisoner”). And don’t get me started on “Calentamiento Global”. Multiples stab wounds, yeah!\n\n4. Fiona Apple – Fetch The Bolt Cutters (Epic)\n\nThe queen is back. Fiona Apple has never made a dull record, and once again she shines on her first album in eight years Fetch The Bolt Cutters. Released early during the pandemic, many critics found that the record’s message of confinement to be timely. Critics also called this her finest album to date. Fetch The Bolt Cutters has appeared on so many albums of the year lists, with places like Good Morning America, The New York Times, Forbes, Entertainment Weekly, and Stereogum putting it at #1. Seriously, just give this album a listen to and you’ll see why everyone loves it.\n\n3. ♥ GOJII ♥ – ALL MY HEART (HyperPop)\n\nIf you told me years ago that I would put an electronic album on a best albums of the year list, I would’ve laughed. That was until a friend who used to be in the furry fandom introduced me to the world of ♥ GOJII ♥. The Floridian agendered musican crafts what can only be summed up as magic on their glorious return to the HyperPop record label. The 37 minute album is simply star stunning, throwing you into a world of bright colors and flashing lights. Songs like “CRUSH”, “SPELLBOUND”, “U HURT ME”, “GOODBYE” and “DISTANCE” are beautiful, and “DISTANCE” still somehow gets me misty eyed. ♥ GOJII ♥, if you’re reading this, never give up on music. You’re beyond talented and I’d kill to see you in concert.\n\n2. Jeff Rosenstock – NO DREAM (Polyvinyl)\n\nJeff, oh Jeff. You’re just full of surprises. On his fourth solo record (his second one released without any warning or press coverage), the former Bomb The Music Industry!/Craig Of The Creek composer creates a masterpiece that’s both fun and witty, “being packed to the brim but being so simple,” as Exclaim! puts it. “Scram!”, “The Beauty Of Breathing”, and my personal favorite “Monday At The Beach” are some of his best solo songs to date. Oh, and he dropped 2020 DUMP just recently, so check that one out, too.\n\nBefore we get to number one, let’s look at a few honorable mentions in no particular order.\n\nThe Used – Heartwork (Big Noise)\n\nInto It. Over It. – Figure (Triple Crown)\n\nRun The Jewels – RTJ4 (Jewel Runners)\n\nCro-Mags – In The Beginning (Mission Two)\n\nMachine Gun Kelly – Tickets To My Downfall (Bad Boy/Interscope)\n\nBroadway Calls – Sad In The City (Red Scare)\n\nHum – Inlet (Polyvinyl)\n\nSilverstein – A Beautiful Place To Drown (UNFD)\n\nThe Avalanches – We Will Always Love You (Modular)\n\nMundy’s Bay – Lonesome Valley (Pure Noise)\n\n1. Spanish Love Songs – Brave Faces Everyone (Pure Noise)\n\nThe fact that Luke Spencer, better known online as Rocked and I both put this record at #1 is incredible, and we both share the same reasons as to why. Released shortly before COVID-19 started running rampant in the states, before we started quarantining and wearing masks outside, L.A. punk rockers Spanish Love Songs dropped Brave Faces Everyone, and album that was already being hyped up by fans as incredible. But as time went on during the pandemic, the meaning of the record changed and every single song started hitting differently. Spencer put it quite bluntly in his video, saying, “I can’t stress enough that Brave Faces Everyone is the defining anthem of 2020 from front to back.” No album this year has hit me as hard as Brave Faces Everyone, and I can’t recall how many times I’ve cried screaming out the lyrics to “Losers”. Vocalist/guitarist Dylan Slocum is this generation’s Bruce Springsteen. His ability to turn his experiences into beautiful, emotional charged hits is goddamn incredible. A songwriter like this comes only once in a lifetime, and Slocum is a goddamn poet who deserves your respect. To quote myself, “Brave Faces Everyone is an album that we can expect from SLS, but it’s a fine one at best. The ten tracks on it are packed with lyrics that will relate to any Millennial, and it’s got the punk rock tendencies to get your sad ass moving on the floor.” Get this fucking album right the fuck now.\n\nTwo more weeks.\n\nHere at Punk Goes Prenatt, for the next 10 weeks, I’ll give you 100 artists that you need to tune your attention to throughout 2020. This list will feature numerous acts from numerous genres.\n\nThis is part eight of ten. If you didn’t read the previous list, click here.\n\nDogleg\n\nHometown: Detroit, MI\n\nOut Now: Melee (Triple Crown)\n\nFor Fans Of: Audio Karate, Heart Attack Man, Title Fight\n\nKnown for their wild and fun live shows, Detroit emo heartthrobs Dogleg are quickly making a name for themselves. Dogleg — vocalist/guitarist Alex Stoitsiadis, guitarist Parker Grissom, bassist Chase Macinski, and drummer Jacob Hanlon — got together in 2015 to create music for the sole purpose of “punch-dancing out our rage.” Catchy, fun, and full of energy, Dogleg’s material hits hard and will leave you feeling the the affect way later on. For example, their debut record Melee is a modern emo masterpiece, getting an 8.6 out of 10 fromÂ Pitchfork. The band have done tours with Worst Party Ever, Glass Beach, Seaholm, Monika, and Weldam, and played festivals like Bled Fest 2018 (Foxing, Norma Jean, Remo Drive) and the Excellency Music Festival 2019 (Car Crash Rhetoric, Jetty Bones, Rarity.) Oh, and if you beat Macinski at a game of Super Smash Bros. on a Nintendo 64 emulator on their merch table, you can win a free shirt. He hasn’t lost yet, but who knows reader, maybe you will be the person to break his winning streak and get that victory shirt. Wear that shit with pride.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Kawasaki Backflip”\n\nInnerlove.\n\nHometown: Long Island, NY\n\nOut Now: Fine By Me – EP (Know Hope)\n\nFor Fans Of: All Get Out, The Hotelier, Weatherbox\n\nWhen Long Island collective Table Talk ended in 2019, vocalist/guitarist Ryan O’Rourke and drummer Jon Argondizza wanted to branch into different directions musically. And thus, Innerlove. was born. Recruiting bassist Dan Sandoval and guitarist Joe Rom, the New York emo quartet began writing songs “with the intention of communicating feelings of hopefulness and self perseverance.” And in these trying times, we need songs like that. So far in their short career, they’ve done shows with Laura Stevenson, Vinnie Caruana, The Sidekicks, Worst Party Ever, and the next band on our list. Let’s move onto them now, shall we?\n\nSong to Listen to: “Enough”\n\ntwentythreenineteen\n\nHometown: Philadelphia, PA\n\nOut Now: XXIIIXIX (Know Hope)\n\nFor Fans Of: Death Cab For Cutie, Have Mercy, Jimmy Eat World\n\nPhilly’s twentythreenineteen are hard to describe. One second, they’re playing indie tracks, and the next, they dive into emo, pop-punk, and acoustic rock that’s borderline Dashboard Confessional. Named after a reference found in the animated classic Monsters Inc., twentythreenineteen (sometimes written out as XXIIIXIX, which is also the name of their debut album) are one of the most unique sounding bands on the list. Simply put, they’re in a completely different genre on their own, feeling like a Frankenstein’s monster created from acts like The Naked And Famous, Pentimento, and Bright Eyes. No matter what they sound like, there’s a song of theirs that I’m sure you’ll like. XXIIIXIX have done shows with Varials, Sleep In., Rich People, Nonfiction, and the previous band on this list (see above.) So if you like indie music, strange sounding bands, or Monsters Inc., then XXIIIXIX are the band for you.\n\nSong to Listen to: “You”\n\nMush\n\nHometown: Chicago, IL and Grand Rapids, MI\n\nOut Now: Thank You, We’re Mush (Skeletal Lightning)\n\nFor Fans Of: Dowsing, Pet Symmetry, Saves The Day\n\nThe members of pop band Mush are separated by one of the Great Lakes. Hailing from Grand Rapids and Chicago, the five-piece pop band craft some pretty fun, off-kilter jams that will make you reminisce old school Vagrant Records (think The Get Up Kids/Reggie And The Full Effect era.) It’s fun music made by fun guys for fun people. What’s else to say? They’ve performed with Good Brother, Telethon, and Giants Chair, and were at The Fest last year with Against Me!, Jawbreaker, and Less Than Jake. Check out Mush and you’ll have one hell of a fun time.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Shirt”\n\nRoses & Revolutions\n\nHometown: Rochester, NY\n\nOut Now: i don’t have feelings anymore – Single (Nettwerk)\n\nFor Fans Of: Bishop Briggs, K.Flay, VÉRITÉ\n\nIt’s not everyday that you can say you discovered an artist from your mom. That’s what happened to me last year when she showed me an acoustic rendition of Fall Out Boy’s “Sugar, We’re Goin Down” by Rochester indie pop natives Roses & Revolutions. Since then my eyes have been glued on the duo. As haunting as they are catchy, R&R have been one of the most underrated indie pop acts in the country. Still, that hasn’t stopped them from touring with big acts like Run River North, K.Flay, VÉRITÉ, Gin Wigmore (who’s married to Jason Aalon Butler of letlive. and FEVER 333,) and Daughtry. And their music has appeared in shows like black-ish, The Village, and Teen Mom OG.\n\nSong to Listen to: “i don’t have feelings anymore”\n\nFake Names\n\nHometown: Washington, D.C. and Umeå, Sweden\n\nOut Now: Brick – Single (Epitaph)\n\nFor Fans Of: All, Dag Nasty, Naked Raygun\n\nFake Names is the newest supergroup on the block. Made up of members of Bad Religion, State Of Alert, Girls Against Boys, Holy Fuck (touring drummer,) and Refused, Fake Names play old school punk rock for those who wanna relive the good old days of the ’80s and early ’90s. Led by Refused frontman Dennis Lyxzén, their music sounds like Dischord Records’s entire discography. Their debut record Fake Names comes out May 8 on Epitaph Records (Early Eyes, The Lawrence Arms, Smrtdeath.)\n\nSong to Listen to: “Brick”\n\nThe Abruptors\n\nHometown: Buffalo, NY\n\nOut Now: Love And Other Disasters (Asian Man)\n\nFor Fans Of: Deal’s Gone Bad, Madness, The Toasters\n\nThe first time I ever saw or heard of the ska/soul/reggae/rocksteady septet The Abruptors was at an unlikely place: UBCon. No, they weren’t performing, two members were helping out a vendor sell handmade Pokéballs filled with Pokémon in tiny environments (mine had Pikachu in it.) They formed back in 2015, but their story all began years prior when half of the group left their old band The B-Side Bastards to create more traditional, rocksteady music. The Abruptors have done shows with Mustard Plug, The Aggrolites, Big D And The Kids Table, The Living End, and Mephiskapheles. They were scheduled to perform at Pouzza Fest in Montreal this May, but with COVID-19 running rampant, the festival has been postponed to next May. No word yet if they’re still playing.\n\nSong to Listen to: “With My Luck”\n\nNudie Mag\n\nHometown: Pasadena, CA\n\nOut Now: Our Milk (Triple B)\n\nFor Fans Of: Drug Church, Pity Sex, Weezer\n\nCali dream rockers Nudie Mag are doing things they’ve never done before. Well, one of them, technically. Twitching Tongues frontman and God’s Hate guitarist Colin Young trades in his dark, heavy sound for something more upbeat and poppy, think of a mixture of Culture Abuse and Weezer. Stereogum said that “Nudie Mag make sparkling, beyond-catchy power pop; it’s not a reach to say that the songs on [Demo 2019] would’ve fit right at home on the first Rentals album. You might be able to hear a bit of evidence of the band’s hardcore connections in their guitar tones.” Little is known about the band since their formation last year, but what we do know is that their tunes are a good time.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Please Be The One”\n\nCharmer\n\nHometown: Marquette, MI\n\nOut Now: Ivy (No Sleep)\n\nFor Fans Of: Hot Mulligan, Pictures Of Vernon, Somos\n\nMeet “Emo’s Next Cult Act.” Michigan’s Charmer are currently riding high with their sophomore record Ivy, now out on No Sleep Records (Good Sleepy, Middle Distance, Stay Inside.) But that could’ve all changed a couple of years ago when vocalist/guitarst David Daignault thought about leaving. That’s when Modern Baseball changed his mind. “Before we signed with No Sleep I was originally ready to move on from the band and start pursuing other interests but we definitely wanted to record and release all the material we had laying around, we were really proud of the songs,” Daignault told Punk Rock Theory. “I emailed [Modern Baseball guitarist/vocalist] Jake [Ewald] on a whim because their music was a big reason I was inspired to write myself. The No Sleep thing happened and we ended up writing a completely new set of songs, drove 18 hours to Philadelphia and stayed for a week tracking it all. I learned a lot from watching Jake during that time and he helped guide us through the process making it a super relaxed recording experience.” Since then, it’s been the best decision he never made. The band have done shows with Free Throw, Kittyhawk, Hot Mulligan, Dowsing, and Pinegrove. Say hello to the new faces of emo.\n\nSong to Listen to: “VCR 666”\n\nYours Truly\n\nHometown: Sydney, New South Wales, Australia\n\nOut Now: Afterglow – EP (UNFD)\n\nFor Fans Of: Eat Your Heart Out, Paramore, Stand Atlantic\n\nYours Truly have everything they need to become Australia’s next breakthrough act. But don’t take my word for it, take The Noise‘s who claimed these Aussie pop-punkers have “the makings to be the next pop-punk breakout act similar to fellow Australians Stand Atlantic.” Just one listen to their second EP Afterglow and you’ll be hooked. Frontwoman Mikaila Delgado’s voice echoes old school Paramore. They’ve toured with Hellions, Senses Fail, The Faim, State Champs, and Tonight Alive, and attended festivals like Riot Fest 2019 (American Football, The Flaming Lips, Slayer,) Unify Gathering 2019 (Every Time I Die, Pagan, Taking Back Sunday,) and Good Things 2019 (A Day To Remember, Ice Nine Kills, Poppy.) They will be performing at Sad Summer Fest (All Time Low, Destroy Boys, Movements) and Slam Dunk (Basement, Sum 41, We Are The In Crowd) this year, well that is if Sad Summer Fest doesn’t get cancelled due to COVID-19.\n\nSong to Listen to: “I Can’t Feel”\n\nCome back next week for more artists!"
