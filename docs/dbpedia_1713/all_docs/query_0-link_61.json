        "text": "SOUNDGARDEN – “Badmotorfinger” (1991)\n\nBadmotorfinger wasn’t the first Soundgarden album I bought but it’s the only one of their albums I’m adding to my list, because it is, to me, their only truly “metal” album. Produced by Terry Date, who at the time had already produced Pantera’s ‘Cowboys From Hell’ and would go on to produce their next three, the album is a muscular procession of stomping drums, with Matt Cameron’s peerless flourishes and fills, overdriven bass and guitars, and Chris Cornell in full shrieking banshee mode fitting it all together. Many a stoned evening did I spend under the spell of Clive Barker and the Ouroboros, with this album as a chaser. Now ‘The Great And Secret Show’ and this album are utterly fused together in my mind. The dark, crushing, but melodic barrage from the opening call and response guitars of ‘Rusty Cage’ to the doomy, wailing finale of ‘New Damage’ hooked me from start to finish. From the morose, stomping ‘Outshined’, to the ominous, droning ‘Mind Riot’, to the galloping, jerking ‘Drawing Flies’, I still find myself singing along with every song. This is the album that turned me around to metal.\n\nKILLING JOKE – “Pandemonium” (1994)\n\nPossibly my favourite band of all time, the influence of Killing Joke over dark and heavy music across the past 30 years is oft repeated, but it wasn’t till ’94 that the band really went into full metal attack mode, with this full-blooded, chugging, bellowing, industrial tinged séance. From a career of repeated brilliance ‘Pandemonium’ doesn’t even make my top 5 KJ albums, but still it tramples over the competition of the time. Geordie Walker will never grace you with a solo, but you will bow down at the altar of his fluid, angular guitar lines. Usually Geordie’s guitars twist and insinuate their way across a marching, pummelling rhythm section; on this album he often sits more firmly on the beat, which takes away a little of what makes the band so unique on other albums, but it does add more artillery force, propulsion and heaviness to tracks like ‘Millennium’ and ‘Whiteout’. My favourite track ‘Pleasures of the Flesh’ is tucked away near to the end. To my ears it’s the best fusion on this album of Geordie’s more subtle and sinister style, with the thundering power of drums and bass and Jazz summoning whatever the fuck he’s dragging out of the underworld. Killing Joke never rest on their laurels and by ‘96’s ‘Democracy’ the sound had shifted again, but for 60minutes in 1994, they laid the marker down to Metallica, Ministry, Soundgarden, Nirvana and the rest. You think you know heavy? You don’t know the heavy that summons the spirits of the dead.\n\nTYPE O NEGATIVE – “October Rust” (1996)\n\nAround ‘99/ 2000 things start to get pretty muddled as the metal floodgates opened for me. I remember being in halls in Glasgow, during my first year at university and after a night of some debauchery, being woken from a fitful sleep on my floor (my friend had taken over my bed) by some horrible, funereal, drone… some time later I discovered it was the opening notes of ‘White Slavery’ from Type O Negative’s ‘World Coming Down’. Given my state that morning, I now appreciate my neighbour may have had a better sense of humour than I gave him credit for at the time. Actually growing to appreciate Type O must have come by some other route. I think I heard ‘Love You To Death’ somewhere and thought it was amazing. That echoing piano line and Peter Steele’s whispering baritone luring you in, before the rest of the band crash in with that unmistakable bass heavy, synth textured metal drone. I can still remember the second hand music shop in Glasgow and the moment that I bought the album that song appears on: ‘October Rust’. I’m yet to find another band that so successfully combine such a dark and depressive gothic outlook and sound with this tongue-in-cheek self-awareness and in ‘October Rust’ especially Peter Steele lays a deeply sexual tone to go with it. In the musical history of my life this album is the soundtrack to my first serious relationship. In all of it’s mournful, gothic sensuality it’s a fitting companion.\n\nTOOL – “Ænima” (1996)\n\nIn 2000/ 01 I was listening to a lot of music just outside the boundary of metal. I think I came to Tool via Rollins Band. I know I waiting for ‘Lateralus’ to come out, but between this album and ‘Undertow’ I can’t be sure now which I had first, but I figure it was the more recent. There was definitely a time when I thought Tool’s music had some kind of mystical insight; now I just enjoy some of their songs from time to time. Tool at this time are streamlined and smooth sound, but bludgeoning also. They felt like a natural continuation when I was listening to a lot of Rollins Band and Soundgarden. Ænima is a very satisfying album when I’m in the mood for it. I’ve often been drawn to bands that have really great drummers and sometimes the drumming on this album is the most interesting part of the music. Enough people have rhapsodised about this album. It is masterful, although it also all makes me feel like I’m twenty again. PRYING OPEN MY THIRD EYE!\n\nPANTERA – “Vulgar Display of Power” (1992)\n\nIt seems suspicious to me that my first 5 albums should all be music that I still think is great. I do remember one of my best friends properly exposing me to Pantera. When I’d listened to bits and pieces as a teenager, along with bands like ‘Slayer’ and ‘Metallica’, it was always too heavy and lacking in melody for me to really appreciate. Eventually, though I was ready. This was probably the first I owned. This became my favourite music for running or walking to and from work. I suppose that although this music seemed so inaccessible before I got someway into metal, Pantera do still show a melodic sensibility. And there are no blast beats to baffle the uninitiated. If I were ever able to consider myself a bad ass I’d probably be listening to Pantera at the time. Nothing could be more fit for working out than ‘A New Level’, motivational music when you want to be slightly angry at the same time. From the off, Phil Anselmo really nails not singing like Rob Halford at any stage of the proceedings and perfects his metal frown. There isn’t a moment that fails to make me nod my head and frown with satisfaction… and think of big bearded men eating hot sauce for money."
