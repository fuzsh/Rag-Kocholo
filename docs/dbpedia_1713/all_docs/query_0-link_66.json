        "text": "Congrats, you survived 2020.\n\nWhile we can talk about how bad last year was, let’s talk about one of the few positives that occurred: sweet albums. Throughout the past 12 months, several bands and artists dropped some stellar pieces of music, and today we will look at 10 of those records, as well as some honorable mentions.\n\nNote: before I continue, let me remind you that this list is my opinion. I haven’t listened to every single album that has come out in the past 12 months, no one has. These are just the albums I enjoyed throughout the year.\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s look at the best albums 2020 gifted us.\n\n10. Enter Shikari – Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible (SO)\n\nIt’s been a long time since I listened to an Enter Shikari record. 2017’s The Spark showed the band swapping their electronic post-hardcore sound for something alt-rock sounding, and they carry that same sound into Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible. While I disliked the change on The Spark, Nothing Is True was able to capture my attention throughout the 44 minute record by adding in some of their old post-hardcore tones. Tracks like “THE GREAT UNKNOWN”, “T.I.N.A.”, “Crossing The Rubicon”, “{ The Dreamer’s Hotel }”, and “thē kĭñg” are some of their finest songs to date. Glad to be a fan again.\n\n9. Four Year Strong – Brain Pain (Pure Noise)\n\nHoly shit this was so worth the five year wait. Worcester’s finest have returned with another heavy-hitter. On their fifth album Brain Pain, Four Year Strong have shown that if something isn’t broken, don’t bother fixing it. With heavy breakdowns worth breaking a bone to in the pit (“Brain Pain”), to pop-punk fueled jams (“Talking Myself In Circles”), Brain Pain is the band’s best album to date. I cannot wait to sing these songs live with a crowd.\n\n8. Taylor Swift – folklore (Republic)\n\nYeah, I’m shocked too. I put T-Swift on a best albums list. But my God is folklore beautiful. Ditching her pop persona for something more folky, Taylor channels in her inner singer-songwriter, making a record (scratch that, two records) that has her dwelling into alt-folk and chamber pop. And she pulls it off so damn well! Album opener “the 1” is a major departure from 2019’s Lover, and every single song blows you away, like the Grammy nominated “cardigan” and the kick ass “the last great american dynasty”. Color me impressed, Taylor.\n\n7. Dogleg – Melee (Triple Crown)\n\nMeet the new faces of emo. Michigans’s Dogleg have proven themselves on their debut record Melee that they are worth checking out. “Kawasaki Backflip” viciously grabs you and doesn’t give you time to breathe as the rest of the record takes you on one hell of a ride. Frontman Alex Stoitsiadis is an excellent songwriter and every song on the record shows how well he is at it. As Pitchfork put it, “It’s a record that’s as melodic as it is physical, where pent-up aggression turns into physical liberation.” Don’t sleep on Dogleg, there’s a reason I put them on last year’s Prenatt’s Picks list.\n\n6. Hot Mulligan – you’ll be fine (No Sleep)\n\nTo quote Pitchfork again, “Hot Mulligan are on that emo bullshit.” The Michigan emo act have grown so much since their debut Pilot back in 2018, but they still have some time to grow. While it’s not a solid record like Dogleg’s Melee, it is a fun record, with songs about cars, faded pictures, and not fucking up. It’s their finest album to date, and I can’t wait for what they have in store next. Shoutout to Hot Mulligan Tadesposting.\n\n5. Dance Gavin Dance – Afterburner (Rise)\n\n2020 was supposed to be Dance Gavin Dance’s year. With several festivals lined up and a tour with Bilmuri already being advertised, COVID-19 had to kill all of that. So the legendary post-hardcore act did a livestream show (with a second one in December for Tree City Sessions 2). And on those livestreams, we heard some songs off of their ninth studio album Afterburner. And wow, Afterburner is one of DGD’s most unique records to date. Mixing in elements of pop, Latin, funk, and rap, DGD created something that Kill Your Stereo put as “intricate, catchy, emotional and deceptively complex.” Plus, hearing Tilian Pearson scream again gives me Tides Of Man flashbacks (see “Lyrics Lie” and “Prisoner”). And don’t get me started on “Calentamiento Global”. Multiples stab wounds, yeah!\n\n4. Fiona Apple – Fetch The Bolt Cutters (Epic)\n\nThe queen is back. Fiona Apple has never made a dull record, and once again she shines on her first album in eight years Fetch The Bolt Cutters. Released early during the pandemic, many critics found that the record’s message of confinement to be timely. Critics also called this her finest album to date. Fetch The Bolt Cutters has appeared on so many albums of the year lists, with places like Good Morning America, The New York Times, Forbes, Entertainment Weekly, and Stereogum putting it at #1. Seriously, just give this album a listen to and you’ll see why everyone loves it.\n\n3. ♥ GOJII ♥ – ALL MY HEART (HyperPop)\n\nIf you told me years ago that I would put an electronic album on a best albums of the year list, I would’ve laughed. That was until a friend who used to be in the furry fandom introduced me to the world of ♥ GOJII ♥. The Floridian agendered musican crafts what can only be summed up as magic on their glorious return to the HyperPop record label. The 37 minute album is simply star stunning, throwing you into a world of bright colors and flashing lights. Songs like “CRUSH”, “SPELLBOUND”, “U HURT ME”, “GOODBYE” and “DISTANCE” are beautiful, and “DISTANCE” still somehow gets me misty eyed. ♥ GOJII ♥, if you’re reading this, never give up on music. You’re beyond talented and I’d kill to see you in concert.\n\n2. Jeff Rosenstock – NO DREAM (Polyvinyl)\n\nJeff, oh Jeff. You’re just full of surprises. On his fourth solo record (his second one released without any warning or press coverage), the former Bomb The Music Industry!/Craig Of The Creek composer creates a masterpiece that’s both fun and witty, “being packed to the brim but being so simple,” as Exclaim! puts it. “Scram!”, “The Beauty Of Breathing”, and my personal favorite “Monday At The Beach” are some of his best solo songs to date. Oh, and he dropped 2020 DUMP just recently, so check that one out, too.\n\nBefore we get to number one, let’s look at a few honorable mentions in no particular order.\n\nThe Used – Heartwork (Big Noise)\n\nInto It. Over It. – Figure (Triple Crown)\n\nRun The Jewels – RTJ4 (Jewel Runners)\n\nCro-Mags – In The Beginning (Mission Two)\n\nMachine Gun Kelly – Tickets To My Downfall (Bad Boy/Interscope)\n\nBroadway Calls – Sad In The City (Red Scare)\n\nHum – Inlet (Polyvinyl)\n\nSilverstein – A Beautiful Place To Drown (UNFD)\n\nThe Avalanches – We Will Always Love You (Modular)\n\nMundy’s Bay – Lonesome Valley (Pure Noise)\n\n1. Spanish Love Songs – Brave Faces Everyone (Pure Noise)\n\nThe fact that Luke Spencer, better known online as Rocked and I both put this record at #1 is incredible, and we both share the same reasons as to why. Released shortly before COVID-19 started running rampant in the states, before we started quarantining and wearing masks outside, L.A. punk rockers Spanish Love Songs dropped Brave Faces Everyone, and album that was already being hyped up by fans as incredible. But as time went on during the pandemic, the meaning of the record changed and every single song started hitting differently. Spencer put it quite bluntly in his video, saying, “I can’t stress enough that Brave Faces Everyone is the defining anthem of 2020 from front to back.” No album this year has hit me as hard as Brave Faces Everyone, and I can’t recall how many times I’ve cried screaming out the lyrics to “Losers”. Vocalist/guitarist Dylan Slocum is this generation’s Bruce Springsteen. His ability to turn his experiences into beautiful, emotional charged hits is goddamn incredible. A songwriter like this comes only once in a lifetime, and Slocum is a goddamn poet who deserves your respect. To quote myself, “Brave Faces Everyone is an album that we can expect from SLS, but it’s a fine one at best. The ten tracks on it are packed with lyrics that will relate to any Millennial, and it’s got the punk rock tendencies to get your sad ass moving on the floor.” Get this fucking album right the fuck now.\n\nHere it is folks, the final Prenatt’s Picks list of 2018. So far, we’ve looked at 40 interesting bands ranging in multiple genres such as rap, metalcore, pop-punk, rock, and even pirate metal. As I said in my previous lists, much like I did last year on my weekly list for The Record, I’ll be looking at 50 bands that I think you should add to your playlists. You might know some of these guys, or some of them might be fresh faces. Here’s the final ten.\n\nASHES\n\nHometown: Buffalo, NY\n\nOut Now: TBA (Self-Released)\n\nFor Fans Of: Crown The Empire, For Today, Memphis May Fire\n\nWhile most bands in the metalcore genre are busy trying to go the rock radio way, ASHES disregards that trend and does metalcore the way it should be: simply brutal. Originally known as A Rose Among Ashes, the Buffalo metalcore outfit went under multiple lineup changes before they settled on the unstoppable lineup of Jack Friend, Felix Cruz III, Bob Adams, Tyler Phipps, and Cody Boeve-McCormick. With a melody that sounds like early Issues meets later Attack Attack! and screams that rival former Of Mice & Men frontman Austin Carlile (listen to the 13 second scream on “Absence,”) ASHES are a force to be reckoned with in the metalcore scene. As frontman Jack Friend told me, “It’s definatley straight metalcore.” If you love early 2010s Rise Records bands like For The Fallen Dreams and Like Moths To Flames, you’ll love ASHES. The band will play a release show for their upcoming EP “Timelines” on April 8 at Stamps the Bar along with locals acts Winski, Livid Life, and Short Attention Span Theatre.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Absence”\n\nSuper Whatevr\n\nHometown: Costa Mesa, CA\n\nOut Now: Never Nothing (Hopeless)\n\nFor Fans Of: Catfish And The Bottlemen, Daisyhead, Have Mercy\n\nIt’s hard to call Super Whatevr a specific genre. They teether in between emo-pop and alt-rock and they do it so fine that it’s just fucking impressive for a band that’s only two years old. The Orange County band is formed up of vocalist/guitarist Skyler McKee (center, bottom) and his friends bassist Josiah Beason, guitarist Nate Wickander, and drummer Kenzo Cardenas and in their short amount of time have done some pretty impressive things. They signed to Hopeless Records (Bayside, Hands Like Houses, Moose Blood) in 2017 after releasing their EP “Good Luck” and are currently touring with Movements and Can’t Swim. The energy that Super Whatevr generates during their live shows is nothing but bubbly feelings and songs that will make you jump up and down. McKee’s vocals are nothing but expressive and theatrical. It’s only a matter of time until alternative radio stations play them. Their next show is Wednesday, March 21 at the Space Ballroom in Hamden, CT.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Bloomfield”\n\nVarials\n\nHometown: Philadelphia, PA\n\nOut Now: Pain Again (Fearless)\n\nFor Fans Of: Code Orange, Jesus Piece, Knocked Loose\n\nWhen Fearless Records (The Aquabats, Grayscale, The Word Alive) signs a heavy band, people pay attention. So why the hell are people ignoring Varials? The Philly based hardcore/metal band are one of the heaviest bands you’ll hear all year. Hell, they might rival Code Orange with how heavy and brutal they are. Varials’ newest album “Pain Again,” produced by Josh Schroeder (King 810, In Hearts Wake, For The Fallen Dreams,) legit brings the fucking pain. As soon as you hear the opening track “The New Damnation,” you know you’re in for a world of hurt once you see them live. They feel so out of place being on Fearless. I mean seriously, they would fit perfectly with Pure Noise, Victory, or even Roadrunner! What else can I say except “I’ll see you in the pit.” The band will come to Buffalo on Sunday, May 20 at the Town Ballroom with Emmure, King 810, and Counterparts.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Anything To Numb”\n\nBearings\n\nHometown: Ottawa, Ontario, Canada\n\nOut Now: Nothing Here Is Permanent – EP (Pure Noise)\n\nFor Fans Of: Handguns, Knuckle Puck, Seaway\n\nOur neighbors up north have graced us with another killer pop-punk band. From Ottawa comes this quartet (guitarist Tyler Nickel left the band back in February before their tour with Four Year Strong and Less Than Jake) that packs all the punches that we’ve grown to expect from Canadian pop-punk bands like Seaway and Like Pacific. Their melodies are nothing but sweet and bouncy. I can clearly see these guys growing in popularity as the year goes on. Expect their debut full-length to come out later this year on Pure Noise Records (Can’t Swim, Hawthorne Heights, Senses Fail.)\n\nSong to Listen to: “Letters Home”\n\nCigarettes After Sex\n\nHometown: El Paso, TX and Brooklyn, NY\n\nOut Now: Cigarettes After Sex (Partisan)\n\nFor Fans Of: Cocteau Twins, Julee Cruise, Red House Painters\n\nJust look at that name and tell me that you’re not intrigued enough to look into them. Formed accidentally a decade ago, guitarist/vocalist Greg Gonzalez was trying to find the right spacious sound to record his songs for what would become their EP “I.” which came out in 2012. The EP was recorded in a four-story stairwell at the University of Texas where Gonzalez was attending along with his ever-changing lineup. Now in Brooklyn, the group consists of Gonzalez, keyboardist Phillip Tubbs, drummer Jacob Tomsky, and bassist Randy Miller. CAS is the kind of band what you would listen to while smoking a cigarette after a night of love making, so the name is a perfect fit to match their dream pop sound. Their songs have some pretty impressive view counts on YouTube with their song “Affection” reaching over 41 million views and “Nothing’s Gonna Hurt You” having a whopping 67 million views! The band will be touring the U.S. starting March 23, Europe in May and will be playing several festivals such as Osheaga in Montreal on Friday, August 4 along with St. Vincent, Portugal. The Man, and James Blake, the In Bloom Music Festival in Houston, TX March 24 through the 25 with Beck, Lil Dicky, and T-Pain, and Pukkelpop in Hasselt, Belgium with Kendrick Lamar, La Dispute, and $uicideboy$.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Apocalypse”\n\nHi, Mom!\n\nHometown: Sacramento, CA\n\nOut Now: Maybe It’s Too Much To Ask – Single (Self-Released)\n\nFor Fans Of: Alkaline Trio, Green Day, The Menzingers\n\nDon’t confuse this trio for the Indonesian indie rock band of the same name. This Hi, Mom! band is from America, well, Sacramento, to be exact, and they’re even more catchier. Filled with riffs that scream old school indie and pop-punk like Weezer or Alkaline Trio, Hi, Mom! is a unique band that is just starting their blossoming career. They’ve released three songs in 2017 and have shot music videos for each one which aired on BVTV on YouTube. Guitarist/vocalist Bailey Zindel sounds like the 21st century’s Rivers Cuomo. Hopefully in 2018 we’ll hear more from Hi, Mom!\n\nSong to Listen to: “Maybe It’s Too Much To Ask”\n\nSuperorganism\n\nHometown: Everywhere\n\nOut Now: Superorganism (Domino)\n\nFor Fans Of: The Avalanches, Beck, The Go! Team\n\nNo, you’re not reading the wrong. This band has members that reach across the globe, from Maine to even the United Kingdom. The global septet started to make waves last year with their song “Something for Your M.I.N.D.” blowing up. The song currently has over two million views on YouTube. Superorganism mix in elements of art pop with synth pop and oh my god is it amazing! Filled with trippy imagery and songs that wreak of summer vibes, Superorgansim is the band that will lift your troubles away this year. The band is currently touring the U.S. on a mostly sold out tour with their next show being on Thursday, March 22 at the Doug Fur Lounge in Portland, OR and will play Lollapalooza this year along with Bruno Mars, All Time Low, and lovelytheband.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Everybody Wants To Be Famous”\n\nSYML\n\nHometown: Issaquah, WA\n\nOut Now: In My Body – EP (Nettwerk)\n\nFor Fans Of: Daughter, Kodaline, Oh Wonder\n\nSYML is only one person. That’s what the band’s Facebook page states. To quote the rest of his about page, “Brian Fennell wrote and recorded a collection of songs under the name Syml, which means simple in Welsh. Adopted and not knowing his history or connection to his Welsh roots, many of these songs were influenced by the complex feelings that come from unknown lineage.” Mixing in his Welsh roots with his style of songwriting, Fennell is able to write such beautifully haunting melodies under his two EPs “Hurt For Me” and his newest one “In My Body.” His most well-known song is “Where’s My Love” which first appeared on “Hurt For Me” as a piano ballad but was re-recorded with extra instruments on “In My Body,” including claps and a haunting choir that fills the chorus’ atmosphere. Keep your ears open, SYML might be the next James Blunt.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Where’s My Love”\n\nHoney And Salt\n\nHometown: Austin, TX\n\nOut Now: A Nihilist Takes Up Knitting – Single (Spartan)\n\nFor Fans Of: American Football, Braid, Tiny Moving Parts\n\nAre you a fan of Tiny Moving Parts and are looking for more bands that sound like them? Well, why not listen to Honey And Salt? Freshly signed to Spartan Records (American Opera, Man Mountain, Schematic) is this Texan math rock trio formed up of Wade Allen (guitar/vocals), Austin Sears (bass/vocals), and Benjamin Sams (drums/vocals). Since their formation in 2009, Honey And Salt have mostly stayed local and have done shows not that far from the Lone Star State, doing shows with local acts Football, Etc., DEZORAH, and Opposite Day. To quote Spartan Records’ page about them, “Honey and Salt revel in their differences, seamlessly blending their disparate influences into a sound that manages to be complex without sacrificing immediacy.” With a new album dropping April 6 called “Honey And Salt,” you can expect more greatness to come from these mighty Texans. The band will do a short tour in April starting Friday, April 6 at The Sidewinder in Austin, TX with A.M. feelgood, DEZORAH, SMiiLE, Glassing, and Tremble Out.\n\nSong to Listen to: “A Nihilist Takes Up Knitting”\n\nPlum\n\nHometown: Hamilton, Ontario, Canada\n\nOut Now: Division – Single (Self-Released)\n\nFor Fans Of: Beach House, Phantogram, Sylvan Esso\n\nCould you believe that this Canadian synth pop duo is formed up of one member of Counterparts? Yeah that’s right, the hardcore band. After leaving the band in 2016, Jesse Doreen decided to work with vocalist Rachael Kross, forming the pair in late 2017. The duo just played their first show back on March 8 at The Casbah with Crywank and chastity. Kross’ vocals just wreak of Lana Del Ray and POLIÇA and when it’s mixed with Doreen’s multi-instrumental abilities, it becomes the stuff that indie stations across the globe dream about. Combining the haunting talents of Lana Del Ray with the synth pop vibe of Sylvan Esso, the duo are out to make 2018 their year.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Division”\n\nNow before I finish this list, I have to say something. There was a band I put on the first list called Coldfront who unfortunately broke up this month after multiple issues. With that out of the way, I figured I should put a band that’s active on this list. I would hate to end this list only putting 49 active bands on here, so I’m gonna add one more. So here’s a little something extra for you guys.\n\nHobo Johnson & The LoveMakers\n\nHometown: Sacramento, CA\n\nOut Now: The Rise Of Hobo Johnson (Self-Released)\n\nFor Fans Of: The Front Bottoms, Hotel Books, twenty one pilots\n\nWho the fuck is Hobo Johnson? This guy just literally came outta nowhere. Last week, no one knew about him and now this week, people are going nuts about this guy and his band! Well, with some research, Hobo Johnson is actually named Frank Lopes and his band is made up of Jordan Moore, David Baez-Lopez, Derek Lynch, and Ben Lerch. According to an article from the Sacramento Bee, “The legend of Hobo Johnson began when Lopes was about 19, following a spat with his dad and stepmom that left him kicked out of the house. He opted to turn his [1994 Toyota] Corolla into a kind of makeshift apartment, sleeping in the back seat when he wasn’t working at a Rocklin pizza parlor or using a Roseville 24 Hour Fitness as a place to shower…Broke, and grappling with cramped legs from sleeping in his car, Lopes embraced a new persona: ‘Hobo Johnson.’ This rapper would celebrate the scrappy and keep his subject matter sincere, even to the point of awkwardness.” The project started in 2015 and continued to gain some ground, eventually leading to his peak in March of this year. Their 2018 NPR Tiny Desk Contest video for their unreleased song “Peach Scone” blew up online, right now having 1.2 million views on YouTube. Hell, he’s so popular that there’s fucking memes made after him and a group on Facebook called I Will Destroy Hobo Johnson. I still can’t tell if this is a major joke or if this is 100% real. While his rhymes and lyrics sound generic, it is nothing but fun. Listen to “Romeo & Juliet”, “Sex In The City”, and “Mario & Link” and maybe you’ll be a fan of this homeless poet.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Mario & Link”\n\nWell there you have it, 50 fresh bands to add to your Spotify playlists, or whatever you use for music. I think I had more fun writing this year’s than last year’s. If you wanna read my old list, go to this link and look for “Prenatt’s Picks”. I talked about artists like Creeper, the late Lil Peep, blackbear, Sir Sly, and Microwave, just to name a few. Thanks for sticking with me for the past five weeks. Hope to see you all soon!"
