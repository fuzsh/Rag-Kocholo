        "text": "Anthony Braxton\n\nFor Alto (1969)\n\nBraxton’s scores look like trigonometry and his sound embraces free-noise, warp-speed linear improv, mutated bebop, even a little Cool School airiness. This landmark 1969 set for Braxton’s unaccompanied alto sax breaks out from his hero John Coltrane’s legacy through influences from jazz, John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and serial music.\n\nMichael Brecker\n\nPilgrimage (2006)\n\nThe Last recording from the most influential contemporary saxophonist after John Coltrane – five months after this session he died of leukaemia – with Brad Mehldau, Herbie Hancock and Pat Metheny among the guests. Typically angular, hard-accented Brecker themes, inspired playing and a sensational impromptu collective jam on Tumbleweed.\n\nBreeders\n\nPod (1990)\n\nThe Breeders were an indie supergroup in a time that was culturally unsuited to such a thing. Fronted by Throwing Muse Tanya Donnely and Pixie Kim Deal, the group played fractured narratives and inspired covers – Happiness Is a Warm Gun – to join PJ Harvey and riot grrls worldwide in the ranks of top women in rock.\n\nAnne Briggs\n\nA Collection (1971)\n\nThe most unaffected, natural folk singer Britain has ever produced. Much of A Collection is a cappella, but Briggs – who first unearthed the Bert Jansch/Led Zeppelin standard Blackwaterside – infuses some of Albion’s oldest songs (Young Tambling, The Snow It Melts the Soonest) with pure, hypnotic beauty.\n\nBroadcast\n\nHa Ha Sound (2003)\n\nBroadcast blend pastoral 60s psychedelia with 21st-century urban electronica to create a graceful, dreamy sound evocative of rolling green hills and scudding skies. Heightening the mood of stately Britishness is Trish Keenan’s voice, wispy and cut-glass pure, especially on Ominous Clouds, a hymn to escapism for lost souls everywhere.\n\nThe Broken Family Band\n\nWelcome Home, Loser (2005)\n\nA country band from Cambridgeshire? Singing about falling in love with a satanist? Don’t be silly. In fact, the Broken Family Band are national treasures, and beneath the very black humour (it was released on Valentine’s Day) there’s a sense of life’s confusion. John Belushi is a deeply moving reflection on the realisation that drugs and parties do not equate to happiness.\n\nPeter Brotzman\n\nMachine Gun (1968)\n\nGerman tenorist Brotzman is part of a fearsome three-sax frontline – completed by theatrical Dutchman Willem Breuker and wry Englishman Evan Parker – who blast out an ear-shredding proto-punk sound that would be cited by every European free-jazzer and noisenik for decades to come. It also remains the coolest use of two drummers, bar Showaddywaddy.\n\nJames Brown\n\nLive at the Apollo (1963)\n\nThe best live album ever? In October 1962, Mr Dynamite defied his label to record a show at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem, knowing the Famous Flames and the amateur night crowd would be in full cry. There are seven acknowledged wonders of the world. This might be the eighth.\n\nRuth Brown\n\nThe Best Of (1996)\n\nRuth Brown married the sophistication of early jazz with the sultriness of blues and the sass of rock’n’roll: no wonder she was the leading female singer in the 50s R&B scene. This Rhino compilation swings in mood from flirty to lovelorn, outraged to carefree, her voice captivating with every turn.\n\nThe Dave Brubeck Quartet\n\nTime Out (1959)\n\nMillion-selling instrumental Take Five was on this breakthrough 1959 recording by the composer/pianist who brought classical music’s fugues, rondos and irregular time signatures to jazz. Saxophonist Paul Desmond, Take Five’s composer and the most inspired improviser in the band, gives the music much of its airy grace.\n\nJeff Buckley\n\nGrace (1994)\n\nThe only album completed before his death in 1997, Grace is a celebration of Buckley’s exquisite vocal talents. Although it feels like a precursor to a more coherent statement, its mix of cover versions of Leonard Cohen and Benjamin Britten alongside self-penned rock numbers adds to its unique atmosphere.\n\nTim Buckley\n\nDream Letter: Live in London 1968 (1990)\n\nBuckley père was little more than an afterthought in rock when a sensational live recording emerged in 1990 and catapulted him back into favour. With just a skeletal back-up band, Buckley essays a jazz-folk crossover that’s the equal of Astral Weeks, and his dazzling voice soars.\n\nBuena Vista Social Club\n\nBuena Vista Social Club (1997)\n\nA bunch of elderly Cubans were unlikely candidates to displace Portishead as the dinner party soundtrack du jour but, with Ry Cooder’s patronage helping the project to claim the column inches, the power and charm of its protagonists ensured theirs was a long-told tale. In sales terms, the world music equivalent of Thriller.\n\nVashti Bunyan\n\nLookaftering (2005)\n\nThere’s comebacks, and then there’s Vashti Bunyan. Disappearing from the music world after her 1970 hippy-folk debut Just Another Diamond Day, she re-emerged 35 years later and the lilting melodies, fragile vocals and air of innocence all remained intact. You wouldn’t believe a year had passed.\n\nBurial\n\nBurial (2006)\n\nThis concept album for a near-future flooded south London set a new gold standard for apocalyptic electronic music. The bass-heavy clamour of metal, static and rain and dark echoes of Joy Division and Massive Attack burned through tracks named after broken homes and prayers, underlining the remarkable power within dubstep’s heavy heart.\n\nRD Burman\n\nSholay OST (1975)\n\nIf the plot to the Indian blockbuster Sholay took a lead from Spaghetti westerns, then it was only natural that RD Burman’s score opened with Ennio Morricone-inspired harmonicas and flamenco guitars. But the Bollywood musical pioneer didn’t stop there: he threw in some western pop influences, a Gypsy dance number and a tribute to Demis Roussos.\n\nBurning Spear\n\nMarcus Garvey (1975)\n\nThe album that put the dread into dreadlock, Marcus Garvey is justifiably regarded as the keystone of the roots reggae phenomenon. Jack Ruby’s sonar-deep production and the horn-dappled grooves provide elemental ballast for the politicised sermons of Winston Rodney, whose sinuous wail makes communal singalongs out of devout Rasta theology.\n\nThe Gary Burton Quartet\n\nCountry Roads and Other Places (1968)\n\nGary Burton, a teenage vibraphone prodigy in the 60s who transformed the instrument’s textures and chordal potential, was also one of the early explorers of jazz-rock, particularly with country and classical inflections. Great melodies (some from the young Mike Gibbs), and gracefully punchy playing from a band including drum star Roy Haynes.\n\nKate Bush\n\nHounds of Love (1985)\n\nIn September 1985, Kate Bush unveiled an album that was astonishing in both its vision and its production. It found inspiration in sources as diverse as Japanese chanting, British horror films and the life of the ­psychologist Wilhem Reich, the man who invented a “cloudbusting” machine. Bush had been criticised for what some perceived as the wilful obscurity of 1982’s The Dreaming, her first entirely self-produced album and one that was not as commercially successful as her earlier work. This time she retreated to a home studio, again to produce the album herself, exploring ­sampling and vocal distortion.\n\nHounds of Love succeeded in being tremendously experimental and also commercially successful. Those seeking pop were directed towards the first side, the more immediately appealing of the two, featuring Cloudbusting, the title song and Running Up That Hill. The second side was the experimental one: a song ­cycle about a woman lost at sea, called The Ninth Wave. It took its name from a line in Tennyson’s The Coming of Arthur, from Idylls of the King: at the breaking of the ninth wave, according to Tennyson, King Arthur is delivered to the world. The songs of The Ninth Wave, beginning with the woozy And Dream of Sheep, grow progressively more intense as Bush explores fear and imagery, culminating in the furious, Celtic track Jig of Life. Hounds of Love was Bush’s masterpiece: it is ­daring, compelling and brilliant, and it secured her reputation as one of the most fiercely experimental artists in pop music’s history. Laura Barton\n\nBuzzcocks\n\nSingles Going Steady (1979)\n\nNo other record of the era epitomises punk’s hothouse impact on its best and brightest practitioners. The Buzzcocks realigned the parameters of the love song towards messy realism with these eight singles, plus B-sides. From Orgasm Addict to Something’s Gone Wrong Again, the philosophy is always sardonic, the melodies divine.\n\nThe Byrds\n\nThe Notorious Byrd Brothers (1968)\n\nHalf the band left during the turbulent sessions, but the Byrds’ fifth album showcased all their guises: psychedelic stargazers (Space Odyssey), hippie rebels (Draft Morning), country-rock pioneers (Change is Now), and interpreters par excellence (Goffin-King’s exquisite Goin’ Back). From an era when ambitious bands asked themselves “What next?” and answered: “Everything!”\n\nCabaret Voltaire\n\nThe Original Sound of Sheffield 83/87 (2001)\n\nThe 78/82 companion to this album traces the Cabs’ pioneering Burroughs/cut-up experiments in industrial/electronic music, but this traces their equally influential but more accessible dancefloor period. The 12in mixes of their singles are sinister, cold but deliriously sensual electrothrobs a few years ahead of techno.\n\nJohn Cale\n\nParis 1919 (1973)\n\nAfter a series of inconsistent solo albums, the Velvet Underground founder delivered his most lyrical work in Paris. With Cale’s love of pop music to the fore, his surreal lyrics – inspired by Graham Greene, Shakespeare and Dylan Thomas – are set here to pastoral acoustic guitars, full band blowouts and some stunning orchestral arrangements.\n\nCamille\n\nLe Fil (2005)\n\n“Le fil” – the thread – refers to the soft drone underpinning the whole album, and most of the sounds you hear are made by Camille Dalmais’s voice. It’s a neat art-pop conceit, but there’s nothing academic about the puckish pleasure that Camille, sometimes dubbed the French Björk, takes in outwitting these self-imposed restrictions.\n\nGlen Campbell\n\n20 Golden Greats (1976)\n\nThe pre-eminent country-pop balladeer, Glen Campbell’s smoked hickory tenor voice inhabits these songs so sensitively that every syllable becomes a bigger truth. The Jimmy Webb epics (Galveston, Wichita Lineman) drip existential gravitas, though no less affecting is Rhinestone Cowboy, a bittersweet rumination on the corrosive effects of fame.\n\nCan\n\nTago Mago (1971)\n\nThe essential story: four German musicians convene in Cologne and begin musical experiments that map out a future for rock as transcendent, improvisatory art, while usually avoiding prog-rock indulgence. With the aid of Japanese vocalist Damo Suzuki, their work arguably reached its high point here – though you could just as easily start with 1972’s Ege Bamyasi.\n\nVinicius Cantuaria\n\nSol Na Cara (1996)\n\nIt’s only the mid-90s, but New York-based songwriter Cantuaria can see the future of Brazilian music, while looking back to its bossa nova heyday. With the help of Ryuichi Sakamoto, he assembles an exquisite and beautifully tuneful collection, given an elegant, edgy twist by Arto Lindsay’s production.\n\nCaptain Beefheart\n\nClear Spot (1973)\n\nBy 1973, Beefheart wanted to shed his “freak” image and get a piece of the commercial pie he felt his talent deserved. So he hooked up with producer Ted Templeman and made this swaggering set of funky, soul-infused rock. In fact, Clear Spot failed to chart at all, but it contains some of his finest music.\n\nJohn Carpenter\n\nAssault On Precinct 13 OST (1976)\n\nTo keep to the strict $100,000 budget, the film director composed the score to this Howard Hawks action thriller homage himself. In the process, he created an early classic of minimalist electronica. Carpenter’s sparse main synth refrain, influenced by Led Zeppelin’s Immigrant Song, enhanced the atmosphere of menace and dread.\n\nThe Carpenters\n\nThe Singles 1969-1973 (1973)\n\nOne of the biggest-selling albums of the 70s, 1969-1973 was a mainstay of suburban stereos. Today, though, they have lost their reputation for saccharine, middle-of-the-road fare and are rightly revered for their dramatic rereadings (the Beatles’ Ticket to Ride), Richard Carpenter’s lush arrangements and Karen’s breathtakingly melancholy vocals.\n\nJames Carr\n\nThe Complete Goldwax Records Singles (2001)\n\nThat James Carr isn’t as celebrated as his contemporary and kindred spirit, Otis Redding, remains one of soul’s great mysteries. Fathoms deep and molten with emotion, his voice was never better than on his definitive version of Dark End of the Street, an infidelity classic burning with tragic dignity.\n\nBetty Carter\n\nDroppin’ Things (1990)\n\nBetty Carter’s merciless reinvention of famous melodies and lyrics could be personal to the verge of enigmatic, but she was an eloquently reflexive improvisatory singer. This fine 1990 session has the empathetic Geri Allen on piano and Freddie Hubbard guesting on trumpet.\n\nEliza Carthy\n\nRough Music (2005)\n\nMore songs about STDs and capital punishment. Breath in lungfuls of gothic air as the folk world’s best-connected offspring delivers her most attractively unvarnished record yet. Includes a melting reading of Billy Bragg’s King James Version, far more sublime than its author could ever have imagined.\n\nMartin Carthy with Dave Swarbrick\n\nByker Hill (1967)\n\nThis is the album that transformed the careers of singer/guitarist Martin Carthy and fiddle player Dave Swarbrick, and was rightly regarded as a turning point in the British folk music revival. The duo worked together from 1966-69, ­­reinterpreting traditional songs with brave new arrangements and virtuoso instrumentals – perhaps best heard on the classic title track.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\nAt San Quentin (1969)\n\nNow reissued with a DVD of the original Granada documentary about the famous live concert, San Quentin joined Folsom Prison as a classic confirmation of Johnny Cash’s outlaw-of-the-people stance. A Boy Named Sue became a novelty hit. Elsewhere, Cash’s reading of the situation is exemplary, as he dispenses empathy and humour by turn.\n\nCat Power\n\nThe Greatest (2006)\n\nLeaving her favoured cover versions behind, the softly, huskily sung indie diva Chan Marshall came into her own recording blue-eyed soul with the Memphis Rhythm Band, a group of session legends, on her first completely self-penned album. The liquor-flecked Lived In Bars and languid Love and Communication are nothing less than luscious.\n\nNick Cave and the Bad Seeds\n\nAbattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus (2004)\n\nTwo contrasting albums in one package offer Cave the tender, Nick the pulveriser. With James Johnston and a gospel choir in place of Blixa Bargeld, the Bad Seeds sound all-powerful. Cave is Prometheus, stealing fire from the gods, punished with an endless armageddon and laughing at the absurdity of it all.\n\nCe’Cile\n\nBad Gyal (2007)\n\nAmid the brouhaha surrounding homophobic dancehall stars, the genre’s best talents have gone sadly overlooked recently. Ce’Cile Charlton is a terrific role model. She is bold, brave and uncompromising; whether deftly, wittily puncturing male egos, shattering taboos or simply getting her groove on, her honeyed tones have a core of steel.\n\nCee-Lo\n\nCee-Lo Green Is the Soul Machine (2004)\n\nBetween Goodie Mob and Gnarls Barkley, Thomas “Cee-Lo” Callaway made a pair of stunning solo albums. In a world still lapping up OutKast’s Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, this should have been huge. But Cee-Lo’s wordy introspection, musical experimentation and pop suss was too far ahead of its time.\n\nCentral Line\n\nBreaking Point (1982)\n\nCentral Line, like their Brit-soul compatriots Hi-Tension and Light of the World, were trying to make slick synth-funk in the vein of Herbie Hancock or Quincy Jones, but anthems such as Walking Into Sunshine constantly betray their Englishness, with a pleasingly punky, clunky brand of funk and a raw dub sensibility.\n\nChairmen of the Board\n\nSkin I’m In(1974)\n\nA coup of sorts, with frontman General Johnson outflanked by George Clinton’s Funkadelic at the record label’s behest. A few old-style ballads placated Johnson but the album’s blazing heart is a four-part cover of Sly Stone’s Life and Death, a futuristic funk-rock monster that anticipates Primal Scream and the Chemical Brothers.\n\nThe Chameleons\n\nScript of the Bridge (1983)\n\nAlthough commercial success eluded this Greater Manchester quartet, their influence stretches from the Verve to Interpol to Coldplay. This timeless debut justifies the fuss with plangent, intertwining guitars and instantly anthemic songs that yearn for childhood innocence and rage powerfully against the world.\n\nManu Chao\n\nClandestino (1998)\n\nThe solo debut from the biggest world music star in Europe, this album sold nearly 3 million copies and remains his finest achievement. Based in Spain and France, and famous for his travels across Africa and Latin America, Chao created a glorious, slinky global collage with songs such as Welcome to Tijuana, Bongo Bong, and the title track.\n\nThe Charlatans\n\nThe Charlatans (1995)\n\nTriumph and tragedy at once for the north country boys of Britrock – their finest album, but also the last before the awful loss of keyboardist Rob Collins in a car accident. Here was where they added lashings of groovy, Stones-like soul to their indie-disco shuffle, and came up with some terrific songs full of bright little hooks and tousled, boysy romance.\n\nRay Charles\n\nModern Sounds in Country and Western Music (1962)\n\nWidely regarded as the godfather of modern soul, Charles was also adept at incorporating country elements into his music. On this, his best-selling album, he interpreted 12 country standards, from I Can’t Stop Loving You to You Are My Sunshine, to thrilling effect, offsetting the syrupy strings with his trademark grit.\n\nCheap Trick\n\nIn Color (1977)\n\nTake two geeks and two hunks from Rockford, Illinois, fuse the tunes of the Beatles and the riffs of Black Sabbath, and you’ve got In Color, the second album of hard-rocking powerpop from one of Kurt Cobain’s favourite bands. They recently re-recorded the whole thing with Steve Albini producing. Then left the new recording on the shelf.\n\nThe Chemical Brothers\n\nDig Your Own Hole (1997)\n\nWith their second album, Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons realised their sound and invented big beat in the process. The ululating Block Rockin’ Beats gave them their first No 1; they seduced the indie crowd with Noel Gallagher and Mercury Rev and raised their game with the nine-minute, bagpipe-laden epic The Private Psychedelic Reel.\n\nNeneh Cherry\n\nRaw Like Sushi (1989)\n\nNeneh Cherry’s socially conscious and beat-heavy debut heaved with a distinctly British attitude at a time when homegrown R&B and rap were largely viewed with suspicion. It’s a shame that Cherry is still largely remembered for appearing on Top of the Pops while heavily pregnant, rather than for what she was singing.\n\nChic\n\nRisque (1979)\n\nOn their third album, Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards, the Lennon and McCartney of the dancefloor, produced disco’s Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Featuring My Forbidden Lover and Good Times, a critique of recession-hit America disguised as a club classic and one of the most sampled songs ever, Risque is a rhythmic, rhapsodic revelation.\n\nThe Chi-Lites\n\nA Lonely Man (1972)\n\nEugene Record’s Chicago harmonisers epitomised soul’s shift from 60s grit to 70s smoothness; much of their sound was silkily arranged and updated doo-wop. This album runs the genre’s gamut from the harmonica-led hit ballad Oh Girl to the closing, windswept epic, The Coldest Days Of My Life.\n\nThe Chills\n\nHeavenly Pop Hits (1994)\n\nSet apart by geography, New Zealand produced a remarkable number of remarkable groups in the 80s. They all signed to the Flying Nun label, they all listened to a lot of 60s music, and their records were full of melancholy beauty. The Chills were the best of the lot, and their Best Of is near perfect.\n\nAlex Chilton\n\nLike Flies on Sherbert (1979)\n\nAfter Big Star disintegrated, Alex Chilton made music only for himself. His first solo album is a record that surely was not made with an eye on sales; it’s wracked, cacophanous and chaotic, seemingly as a test of the listener’s will. The writer Robert Gordon reckons it is the record truest to the spirit of Memphis.\n\nCharlie Christian\n\nSolo Flight (1993)\n\nThe first electric guitar hero and a founder of bebop, Charlie Christian died in 1942 at 25, but these 1939-41 recordings with Benny Goodman’s sharp sextet and big band show why he mattered. Christian’s pristine tone, harmonic sophistication and swing make these sessions glow very brightly, for all the pre-bop chug of the 1930s dance rhythms.\n\nLou Christie\n\nPaint America Love (1971)\n\nA teen heartthrob with a couple of hits grows up. But listen closely and you realise Christie’s songs always had a hint of weirdness, and not just at the far end of his glorious falsetto croon. The result is a lush, soft-pop masterpiece that flopped and has never yet been properly reissued.\n\nThe Church\n\nHeyday (1985)\n\nThe paisley-clad Australian guitar band – who are still making fine music today – excelled themselves with Heyday, one of the pinnacles of 80s psychedelia. Sumptuously produced by Peter Walsh, it comes across like an utopian world-in-song, full of billowing guitars and rich, dreamy melodies .\n\nGene Clark\n\nGene Glark With the Gosdin Brothers (1967)\n\nAfter helping create folk rock with the Byrds, Gene Clark was a man cursed with too many options. A man with pop-star looks but rooted musically in folk and country, Clark covered all the bases with his debut. In one track, So You Say You Lost Your Baby, he created a timeless classic.\n\nThe Clash\n\nClash on Broadway (1991)\n\nThe only way to comprehend the Clash’s giddying range is to survey their whole career. The best way to do that is with this three-CD set. All the classics are here, but – crucially – so are the experiments, diversions and mistakes that contribute so much to Clash mythology.\n\nPatsy Cline\n\nShowcase (1961)\n\nMarking Cline’s move from feisty cowgirl to contemporary pop star, her second album is awash with the string-adorned country of the Nashville Sound and the dulcet tones of the Jordanaires. On the likes of I Fall to Pieces and the peerless Crazy, Cline pours timeless class and tear-stained emotion into every sublime note.\n\nClipse\n\nHell Hath No Fury (2006)\n\nLike all great gangsta rap, the Clipse’s second album inhabits a kind of ethical no-man’s-land. Its protagonists seem unsure whether they are brazenly amoral or deeply troubled by their dexterously told tales of crack-dealing. Producers the Neptunes find the perfect musical accompaniment; sparse, disjointed, bleak and atonal, it’s grim and gripping in equal measure.\n\nClouddead\n\nClouddead (2001)\n\nThe trio of Doseone, Why? and Odd Nosdam, members of the West Coast Anticon hip-hop collective, are unlike anything else that genre has spawned. Their arch, surreal lyrics are delivered in raps that sound like a cartoon version of Cypress Hill over an eclectic and disjunctive mix of beats, drones and samples.\n\nCluster and Eno\n\nCluster and Eno (1977)\n\nEno’s other collaborator of 1977, David Bowie, may have reaped the bigger commercial reward, but Eno’s work with Dieter Moebius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius was just as good. With its spectral piano pieces, eerie drones, this great ambient LP held a microphone up to nature, to prove that less was more.\n\nEddie Cochran\n\nThe Legendary Masters Series (1989)\n\nMore than anyone, Cochran embodied the classic rocker; the perfect quiff, the Gretsch, the sly humour, the implicit menace. Titles such as lke Weekend, Teenage Heaven, Summertime Blues and Pink Pegged Slacks are 50s, fairground rock ‘n’ roll in a matchbox.\n\nCocteau Twins\n\nHeaven or Las Vegas (1990)\n\nIt took Cocteau Twins seven albums to climb to their creative peak on this set of other-worldly pop. Shimmering, multi-layered guitars provided the perfect bed for Liz Fraser’s ethereal vocals. Despite band turmoil (Robin Guthrie’s drug addiction especially), this became the Scottish trio’s biggest UK hit, reaching No 7 in 1990.\n\nLeonard Cohen\n\nI’m Your Man (1988)\n\nThe poet laureate of high-maintenance love affairs greeted his sixth decade by embracing synthesizers and geo-politics. From the prophetic terrorist fantasies of First We Take Manhattan to the wry self-reflection of Tower of Song, his voice was deeper, his humour blacker, and his pen sharper than ever.\n\nColdcut\n\nJourneys by DJ:70 Minutes of Madness (1995)\n\nIn a mid-90s market saturated with DJ mix albums, Coldcut’s CD seemed fresh and unique. It still does. A musical sum greater than its parts – which included hip-hop, techno, Harold Budd and Jello Biafra – it came with a dedication to William Burroughs, something absent from, say, Bonkers Happy Hardcore 2: Now We’re Totally Bonkers.\n\nColdplay\n\nA Rush of Blood to the Head (2002)\n\nAfter the winsome acoustic pleasantries of their first album, Chris Martin’s indie anthemists comprehensively upped their game for this follow-up. From the moment the album bursts to life with the pounding Politik, its songs are bigger, bolder and more affecting than its predecessor’s. Coldplay were bedwetters no more.\n\nLloyd Cole and the Commotions\n\nRattlesnakes (1984)\n\nNamechecking Simone de Beauvoir and Eva Marie Saint, Rattlesnakes drew romantic cultural references into spirited love songs that harked back to the Velvet Underground and Television, but playfully. This album, released when Cole was just 23, contains his finest moments, including Perfect Skin and the plaintive, folksy 2CV.\n\nThe Ornette Coleman Quartet\n\nThis Is Our Music (1961)\n\nJazz’s pose of super-cool hipsterdom was blown apart at the end of the 50s by the arrival of Ornette Coleman, who replaced a set of musical rules devised to exclude outsiders with his own more generous guidelines. Here, with Don Cherry, Charlie Haden and Ed Blackwell, he explores the expanded range of emotions.\n\nSteve Coleman\n\nMotherland Pulse (1985)\n\nAlto saxophonist and composer Steve Coleman was one of the founders of the 80s m-base movement, a mix of postbop and edgy funk that transformed jazz phrasing and rhythmic thinking, and still does. This was his imposing 1985 debut, with Geri Allen on piano and a young Cassandra Wilson taking the vocals.\n\nJudy Collins\n\nWildflowers (1967)\n\nElektra’s first lady takes on the best efforts of her contemporaries (Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, Jacques Brel) aided by Joshua Rifkin’s delicate, parlour-sized arrangements. Yet, most impressively, the best songs are a brace of Collins’ own: Sky Fell and Since You Asked are break-up songs as bleak as they get.\n\nLyn Collins\n\nMama Feelgood:The Best of Lyn Collins (2005)\n\nAfter replacing Vicki Anderson in James Brown’s revue, Lyn Collins became the first lady of funk and music’s most sampled female vocalist. Powering through Think (About It), purring over Take Me Just As I Am, Collins’ huge voice and sultry passion beats the godfather of soul at his own game.\n\nShirley Collins & Davy Graham\n\nFolk Roots, New Routes (1964)\n\nOne of the great fusion experiments of the 60s, matching British and US folk songs against settings that ranged from blues and jazz to North African styles. The exquisite vocals were provided by Shirley Collins, and her songs transformed by the inventive guitar of Davy Graham.\n\nJohn Coltrane\n\nA Love Supreme (1965)\n\nThis famous set became a cult hit for the new audiences for progressive rock when it was released – not that it used electric instruments or a backbeat, but because\n\nits chanting, meditational, rhythmic yet timeless feel chimed with the eastern-influenced spiritual pursuits of the era. Coltrane’s saxophone sermons, which could last up to an hour, brought the intensity and passion of a kind of manic trance to jazz. The music’s traditionally succinct song-based forms had not embraced such ­possibilities before, and the anguished beauty of ­Coltrane’s music conferred a kind of jazz sainthood on him: he is still revered 40 years after his early death.\n\nColtrane had come to the point of this revolutionary recording through the more everyday materials of 1940s R&B and bebop bands, but in the next decade he joined one of the great Miles Davis quintets, and then entered the 60s with Giant Steps – an awesomely virtuosic high-speed chord-chase to the edge of the bebop universe. Between that recording and A Love Supreme, the saxophonist found the ideal partners with which to shake off the formal trappings of bop: pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones. Jones had a dark, rumbling, elemental sound that was free yet unerringly focused, while Tyner gave the piano both percussive and choral qualities, and Garrison sometimes sounded like a flamenco guitarist.\n\nA Love Supreme is a four-part devotional work, based on little more than repetitive vamp-like hooks. But the spaces opened up by such simple materials are filled by a torrent of individual and collective improvising. The four-note chant of the title song is twisted, stretched and extended to blistering multiphonic variations by Coltrane, and the restless odysseys of Resolution and Pursuance close with the majestic finale of Psalm. It’s Coltrane’s mission, but the band is truly four spirits joined as one. John Fordham\n\nComets on Fire\n\nField Recordings from the Sun (2002)\n\nLet it be known that there are very loud guitars here, and you can pretty much divine the rest from the title. Santa Cruz’s psychedelic juggernauts upped the ante for cosmic-rock cacophony, taking the soul-and-fire thud of primitivist riffers such as Blue Cheer and making it faster, heavier and freer. A wild, refracted joy.\n\nThe Commodores\n\nThe Very Best Of (1995)\n\nIt’s sometimes difficult to remember that Lionel Richie’s group were as skilled at driving funk as they were at the smooth pop their leader is synonymous with. Easy, Three Times a Lady and Nightshift are present on this excellent collection, but so are early grit-in-the-groove sides such as Brick House and the Machine Gun.\n\nCommon\n\nElectric Circus (2002)\n\nLonnie Rashid Lynn has recently started selling records by curbing his experimental tendencies. The epic, Hendrix- and Clinton-inspired Electric Circus is his apogee and nadir; the maddest, biggest, best record he has made, and the least popular.\n\nCompany\n\nCompany 5 (1977)\n\nGuitarist Derek Bailey, the Frank Zappa of unpremeditated music and inspiration to John Zorn, formed Company in the 70s as an annually gathering, constantly changing all-improv ensemble. This is one of its most accessible encounters, including a powerful horn quartet of trumpeter Leo Smith and sax heroes Anthony Braxton, Steve Lacy and Evan Parker.\n\nThe Congos\n\nHeart of the Congos (1977)\n\nThe sweet voices of Cedric Myton and Roydel Johnson echo in the caverns of Lee Perry’s mind. Jamaica’s best session band lays down fathoms-deep roots reggae. The oarsmen of the Rasta faithful row on, chanting repatriation. A spiritual experience, with or without the best weed in town.\n\nRy Cooder\n\nChicken Skin Music (1976)\n\nThe stepping-off point for the guitarist’s exploration of music beyond the US, Cooder’s engrossing fourth album touches down in Hawaii and at the Mexican border, as well as flicking through the songbooks of both Jim Reeves and Leadbelly. Best moment? Surely Flaco Jiménez’s weightless accordion on the trembling version of He’ll Have to Go.\n\nSam Cooke\n\nNight Beat (1963)\n\nA successful sweet-toned gospel singer, Sam Cooke realised he could get more money – and girls – by wading into the burgeoning US pop market. He brought a spiritual intensity to every cute mainstream confection he recorded, but his beautiful voice was never more mesmerising than on this hushed and gracious final album.\n\nJohn Cooper-Clarke\n\nSnap Crackle and Bop (1980)\n\nThe effervescent Snap Crackle and Bop marked the peak of punk poet Cooper-Clarke’s idiosyncratic and erratic muse. The riled eye for detail and deadpan delivery of Evidently Chickentown out-Falled Mark E Smith and the nihilistic epic Beasley Street can still bring a tear to the eye of men of a certain age.\n\nJulian Cope\n\nFried (1984)\n\nDespite a reputation as a document of LSD impairment, encouraged by the cover image of the author naked under a giant tortoise shell, Fried is actually Cope’s most coherent crystallisation of Merrye Melodies psychedelia. The eccentric poise is exemplified by Reynard the Fox, a fugue for cor anglais and leather trousers.\n\nRuth Copeland\n\nSelf Portrait (1970)\n\nDurham girl moves to Detroit, records with Parliament, creates batty and bewitching album that encompasses funk, opera, folk, bagpipes and even a crying solo on the Motownesque Music Box. Most intense and quite unique. The singer’s current whereabouts are equally mysterious.\n\nThe Coral\n\nThe Coral (2002)\n\nLooking to Merseyside’s maritime heritage for inspiration, these Wirral teenagers produced a debut that was as unusual as anything in British indie rock that year. The album’s dual mainstays were lush harmonies and psychedelically infused jams, but each song was an individual flight of fancy. Sea shanties, rustic Brit-folk, Mersey skiffle – it’s all there.\n\nChick Corea\n\nLight as a Feather (1973)\n\nAlbums by ex-Miles Davis sidemen run into triple figures, but this is one of the more surprising; a sincere and affecting rewriting of the Latin jazz rulebook. Bassist Stanley Clark and flautist/saxophonist Joe Farrell solo brilliantly without breaking the spell of Corea’s magical compositions. And what tunes!\n\nThe Costello Show\n\nKing of America (1986)\n\nBefore King of America’s release, there was music press speculation that Elvis Costello had “lost it”. And while King of America may not have the reputation of the early Attractions records, it stands up rather better. His songwriting is melodious as well as mischievous, and in it you can hear the seeds of alt-country.\n\nCotton Mather\n\nKontiki (1998)\n\nFor a couple of weeks in 1998, some observers thought powerpop might be the sound of now. It wasn’t, but it bequeathed us this forgotten gem from Texas. Cotton Mather took the Beatles’ Revolver as their template, and stretched it in compelling ways. Had it come out in 1966, you’d never hear the last of it.\n\nCowboy Junkies\n\nThe Trinity Session (1988)\n\nOne autumn night in 1987, Cowboy Junkies ensconsed themselves in a Toronto church and communed with their version of the Great American Songbook, tying together Hank Williams, Lou Reed, Rodgers and Hart, and Michael Timmins’ own lonesome compositions. They emerged at dawn with a classic of after-hours Americana.\n\nKevin Coyne\n\nMarjory Razorblade (1973)\n\nKevin Coyne was a singular talent. His vocal delivery was raw and unsettling, but although his songs – often improvised in the studio – largely dealt with society’s outsiders and misfits, they were leavened by a warmth and earthy humour. This double album is his masterpiece, a generous serving of English blues.\n\nThe Cramps\n\nOff the Bone (1983)\n\nFormed in 1976, these Ohio weirdos combined punk, B-movies and obscure rockabilly, relocating rock’s primal howl while casually previewing psychobilly and goth. Culled from records with titles like Gravest Hits, this twang-packing compilation is the one to be seen dead with.\n\nCrass\n\nStations Of The Crass (1979)\n\nThe combination of rudimentary musical skills plus the intensity of their anarchist credo wrapped Crass’s records with an intimidating veneer. Those with strong stomachs are rewarded with a scalding social history of Britain on the cusp of Thatcherism. Stations’ proto-hardcore blasts have dated surprisingly well, though the live tracks are strictly for true believers.\n\nCrazy Horse\n\nCrazy Horse (1971)\n\nThere’s a reason why Crazy Horse are doomed to live in the shadow of sometime collaborator Neil Young – their albums without him are appalling. Their debut is the exception, thanks to Danny Whitten, a heartbreakingly acute chronicler of crumpled romance and also of the drug culture that would kill him within a year.\n\nCream\n\nDisraeli Gears (1967)\n\nThe album that invented hard rock and convinced even more graffiti artists to scrawl “Clapton is God”. With Jimi Hendrix rivalling him as top axe hero, Eric Clapton conjured up his most blistering fretwork on classics such as Sunshine of Your Love, while bassist Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger Baker set the standard for every subsequent power trio.\n\nThe Creation\n\nOur Music Is Red With Purple Flashes (1998)\n\nEddie Phillips predated Jimmy Page’s trick of taking a violin bow to his guitar, employing it on the Creation’s astonishing 1968 single How Does It Feel to Feel. The Creation took distorted R&B to new places in the 60s and became an inspiration to indie bands in the 80s. This is the best of the available compilations.\n\nCristina\n\nSleep It Off (1984)\n\nHarvard graduate and millionaire’s wife Cristina Palaci was the great lost pop star of the 80s, an avant-garde hybrid of Debbie Harry, Kurt Weill and Madonna. Her second album bursts at the seams with opulent New York disco, with Cristina’s elegantly tuneless vocal telling tales of quicksand lovers, stained sheets and suicide attempts in foreign hotels.\n\nDavid Crosby\n\nIf I Could Only Remember My Name (1971)\n\nThe sound of a Laurel Canyon meltdown. Assisted by Neil Young and the Grateful Dead, the cocaine-frazzled former Byrd mourned broken friendships, the death of lover Christine Hinton and the dissipation of the hippie dream, with tender, spooky, often wordless songs that hang in the air like smoke.\n\nJulee Cruise\n\nFloating Into the Night (1990)\n\nJulee Cruise made a cameo in Twin Peaks fronting a bar band, and here her sweet tones meet again with Angelo Badalamenti’s lush melodies and David Lynch’s vivid lyrics. The results are seductive yet unsettling, particularly the Twin Peaks theme Falling and the eerie Into the Night.\n\nCSS\n\nCansei De Ser Sexy (2006)\n\nThe debut from Sao Paolo’s CSS had the kind of qualities you’d expect to find in a lonely hearts listing: attractive; enjoys nights out; good sense of humour. Employing a refreshingly cavalier attitude to genre and style, this album proved CSS were fun, sure, and worth building a relationship with.\n\nCulture Club\n\nColour By Numbers (1983)\n\nOne of the biggest-selling albums of the year, Colour By Numbers was also Culture Club’s high-water mark, where their mix of exuberant soul, pop and confrontational sexuality really gelled. A pre-heroin Boy George was in the finest voice of his career, and the likes of Karma Chameleon still sparkle today.\n\nCulture\n\nTwo Sevens Clash (1977)\n\nWhile Bob Marley celebrated 1977’s youth culture with Punky Reggae Party, Culture frontman Joseph Hill adopted Marcus Garvey’s prediction of chaos when the sevens met. The 1977 apocalypse of the album title never arrived, but Culture’s light, melancholy tones, eclectic mix of styles and benchmark reggae songwriting defined the era as powerfully as the Sex Pistols did.\n\nThe Cure\n\nPornography (1982)\n\nFrom its opening line, “It doesn’t matter if we all die,” to its last, “I must fight this sickness,” Pornography exhibits in unflinching detail a mind singer Robert Smith’s – in collapse. Accompanied by majestic, churning guitars and chilling drums, this is gothic melodrama at its most introverted, oppressive and all-encompassing.\n\nCypress Hill\n\nCypress Hill (1991)\n\nThe debut from Cypress Hill played their Latino heritage and reefer madness against the hard-edged Californian gangsta rap template set down by NWA. The conspicuous violence and smooth funk beats of How I Could Just Kill a Man and Hand On the Pump broke new ground in commercial hip-hop, as did the fact that the record included a song entirely in Spanish.\n\nHolger Czukay\n\nMovies (1980)\n\nThe Can founder’s second solo album was a pioneering and widely copied adventure in fusing sampling and radio broadcasts with pop and world music. Although light and playful, Czukay’s use of sampled voices provided the framework for Byrne and Eno’s much darker, politicised My Life in the Bush of Ghosts a year later.\n\nDAF\n\nGold und Liebe (1981)\n\nThe fourth album from the German electro-punk duo was astonishingly predictive of future dance trends; no wonder John Peel called them “the godfathers of techno”. Acid house, new beat, electronic body music – it’s all in these rubbery, sequencer-driven grooves, seven years ahead of schedule.\n\nDaft Punk\n\nDiscovery (2001)\n\nFans of the crunching techno of their debut, Homework, were delighted to hear that Daft Punk had turned into robots, but surprised to find that they had followed up with an album scored with pop. Barry Manilow is sampled on Superheroes, while you can hear Buggles in Digital Love and you can play air guitar to Aerodynamic.\n\nKaren Dalton\n\nIt’s So Hard to Tell Who’s Going to Love You the Best (1969)\n\nArmed with a banjo and a voice that was sour, strange and spiritual, Dalton was a fixture on the Greenwich Village folk scene of the 1960s. This is her great debut record from 1969, and contains the bewitching Little Bit of Rain and It Hurts Me Too.\n\nThe Damned\n\nDamned Damned Damned (1977)\n\nThis was the first full-length British punk album. With the movement’s clarion call single, New Rose, at its nervy, sweaty core, it still sounds kinetic and vital. From the breakneck Neat, Neat, Neat to the gothic slur of Feel the Pain, its lyrics are infectiously spiky and caustic, and its feverish riffs remarkably undated.\n\nMiles Davis\n\nKind of Blue (1959)\n\nThere’s a moment on this album that is often cited by musicians and fans as the instant when they fell in love with jazz. After the quiet, almost preoccupied ­ensemble opening of the hook-themed So What, drummer Jimmy Cobb makes a split-second switch from brushes to sticks, Miles hangs a long single note out into empty space for a tantalising moment that seems never to end – and then Cobb sets the rhythm rolling with a shimmering cymbal splash. When Spike Lee said “do the right thing”, he could have been ­talking about the uncanny intuition of Miles Davis.\n\nFor most of the trumpeter’s life, he did the right thing in his music with an astonishing consistency for an ­improviser. Kind of Blue is one of the best-known and most enduring of all postwar jazz records, still steadily selling almost half a century later, untouched by fashion or passing time. Davis’s ­supergroup includes pianist Bill Evans and saxophonists Cannonball Adderley and John Coltrane, and the music has a lyrical spaciness quite ­unlike the preceding jazz of the 40s and 50s.\n\nThe contrast between the horn players remains ­gripping however many times you play this album – Davis’s plaintive muted trumpet and subtle ­manoeuvring around the beat, Adderley’s garrulous\n\nalto sax, and John Coltrane’s spine-tingling tenor, wheeling through thunderous runs from yearning high notes, through dolorous mid-range phrases, down to basement-register honks that make you jump. An ­album that turned the course of jazz, and turns on\n\nnew jazz fans still. John Fordham\n\nDe La Soul\n\n3 Feet High and Rising (1989)\n\nNamed after a Johnny Cash lyric (from one of the many tunes it samples), this NYC trio’s debut espouses humour and harmony via tunes as day-glo bright as the flowers on its cover. Released amid a sea of gangsta rap, it remains one of hip-hop’s most progressive, witty and broad-minded albums.\n\nThe Decemberists\n\nHer Majesty the Decemberists\n\nThe second album from the Oregon folk-pop group proved them to be true American originals, as Colin Meloy matched his unashamedly ambitious lyrical conceits with an unerring ear for melody. No band has written a love song stranger and more eloquent than Red Right Ankle.\n\nDeep Purple\n\nMachine Head (1972)\n\nThe epitome of 1970s heavy metal, Deep Purple’s best album combines Ian Gillan’s tinnitus-inducing vocals, Richie Blackmore’s paint-stripping guitar, a band that sounds like a jet engine and various male fantasies about girls, space and trucks. Smoke On the Water’s classic grinding riff is still the compulsory first step for anyone learning rock guitar.\n\nSam Dees\n\nThe Show Must Go On (1975)\n\nThe Birmingham, Alabama songwriter for everyone from Aretha to Whitney got to make only one album himself. It’s centred around two dark, ghetto-soul ballads, Child of the Streets and Troubled Child. But it’s the love songs – So Tied Up, Just Out of My Reach – that bring out the tears in his imploring voice.\n\nDef Leppard\n\nHysteria (1987)\n\nIt’s a rare band that owes conquering the world to the drummer losing an arm in a car crash. Had Rick Allen’s accident not delayed recording while he learned how to drum with one arm, producer Mutt Lange would have been unavailable – as would those choruses that could crush entire civilisations, and guitars polished until they gleamed. The unavoidable rock record of the late 80s.\n\nThe Delfonics\n\nLa La Means I Love You (1998)\n\nIt was with the Delfonics that Thom Bell, the pioneer of symphonic soul, did his greatest work. Influenced by Burt Bacharach, Bell used oboes, horns, cornets and violins to embellish the group’s ethereal falsettos and their loverman-subverting expressions of dependency and vulnerability.\n\nDestiny’s Child\n\nSurvivor (2001)\n\nDestiny’s Child were at their peak when Survivor ­appeared; its first single, Independent Women Part I (which had been the theme to the Charlie’s Angels movie), had spent 11 weeks at No 1 in the US, and the ­title track had reached No 2. The album obligingly sold 663,000 copies in America in its first week, and ended the year with 10m global sales, confirming their status as the world’s most successful female group.\n\nBut the statistics don’t convey its impact as a tract for aspiring teenage and twentysomething women. The ­empowerment message at its core – which counselled body-pride and financial and emotional self-reliance – wasn’t the usual “do as I say, not as I do” flannel. ­Beyoncé Knowles, the whirlwind who was the band’s first among equals, embodied it by producing and ­\n\nco-writing the album, as well as frequently singing lead. (Officially, all three members were “lead vocalists”.)\n\nThe reason the message reached as many ears as\n\nit did was that it came parcelled up in incredible tunes, starting with the one-two-three knockout of opening tracks: Independent Women, Survivor and ­Bootylicious. Unapologetically mainstream pop-R&B, the mood is ever upbeat. And in America, it didn’t do any harm that many of the tunes were underpinned by tradtional values (Fancy, for example, takes a ­negative view of competitiveness between women, while Nasty Girl wags a disapproving finger at promiscuity), or that the final track is a gospel medley. But you don’t have to be a midwestern Christian to appreciate what three ­ambitious women can do. Caroline Sullivan\n\nDamien Dempsey\n\nSeize the Day (2004)\n\nA burly figure known for his boxing skills, Dempsey is currently the best young singer-songwriter in Ireland. He mixes gutsy ballads with a dash of reggae and even rap in his treatment of life in contemporary Dublin. The best songs here are Celtic Tiger, a bleak analysis of the greed and damage caused by the city’s booming economy, and Ghosts of Overdoses, on drugs and the loss of community.\n\nDenim\n\nBack in Denim (1993)\n\nThe debut by former Felt frontman Lawrence Hayward’s band is the great unheralded album of the 90s. Part hilarious, heartbreaking memoir – like Jonathan Coe’s The Rotters’ Club set to thumping glam – and part anti-rock manifesto, it remains utterly unique, testament to its creator’s peculiar vision and inimitable genius.\n\nSandy Denny\n\nSandy (1972)\n\nThis was the second solo album that Denny recorded after leaving Fairport Convention, and was notable both for her exquisite, quietly emotional vocals and her increasingly confident, mature songwriting. She wrote eight of the tracks here, including the gently drifting It’ll Take a Long Time.\n\nDepeche Mode\n\nViolator (1990)\n\nEventually selling more than 7m copies, Violator saw four boys from Basildon become world-beaters. A moody but effortless update of their synth-pop sound, it is the band’s most coherent album, and spawned the evergreen Enjoy the Silence, which outstripped tracks by Prince and Madonna to become the biggest-selling 12in in the history of the band’s US label.\n\nDerek and the Dominoes\n\nLayla and Other Assorted Love Songs (1970)\n\nFronting a deliberately anonymous supergroup, Clapton’s career-defining masterpiece derived from his drug and alcohol problems and his unrequited love for George Harrison’s wife, Patti Boyd. Clapton’s playing led rock critic Dave Marsh to remark that the guitarist had reached so deeply into himself that hearing this felt like witnessing a murder or a suicide.\n\nDevo\n\nQ: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! (1978)\n\nOne of the most innovative debuts in American new wave: a jerky, robotic blend of synthezisers and guitars that could be from Planet Zog. The Akron, Ohio oddballs believed that mankind was regressing. Curiously enough, guitar and dance acts are still pilfering gems like Mongoloid and Jocko Homo some 30 years later.\n\nDexys Midnight Runners\n\nSearching for the Young Soul Rebels (1980)\n\nBritain’s greatest soul band was a bunch of lairy Birmingham lads, wearing working clothes and woolly hats, led by Kevin Rowland, a man so confrontational that he stole the master tapes from the label. Their first album, fiery and passionate, celebrated Irish novelists and old soul singers with equal vigour.\n\nNeil Diamond\n\n12 Songs (2005)\n\nProduced by Rick Rubin following his albums with Johnny Cash, this was a timely reminder of the songwriter behind the sequin-wearing, Las Vegas-entombed legend. It’s stripped-down, spiritual and surprisingly restrained, yet made Diamond sound more powerful than he had for decades.\n\nBo Diddley\n\nThe Story of Bo Diddley (2006)\n\nMany of Bo Diddley’s best songs were built around a single beat – and boy, what a beat. A jittery, shuffling syncopation of blues and African rhythms, it oozed sex and attitude, as did his brazen guitar-playing and outrageously self-promoting lyrics. Listen to this exhaustive compilation and marvel at his immodesty.\n\nDillinger\n\nCB200 (1976)\n\nPartial to arcane lyrical twists, Dillinger had a style as cavalier as one might expect from a man named by Lee “Scratch” Perry. This masterful example of the reggae DJ’s art boasts the hit single Cokane in My Brain, though his random cultural observations suggest that Dillinger’s recreational pursuits were strictly herbal in nature.\n\nDinosaur Jr\n\nYou’re Living All Over Me (1987)\n\nOne of underground rock’s great “why the hell not” moments. J Mascis and Lou Barlow here committed the fantastic non sequitur of using their amp-melting hardcore punk training to reclaim the melody, colour and, especially, guitar solos of classic rock. Tunes abound, as do fuzz, velocity and all kinds of forward possibilities for this wacky new “indie rock” thing.\n\nDion\n\nBorn to Be With You (1975)\n\nThis is what you would want a “lost classic” to sound like. With a backstory involving teen stardom and heroin, the last thing Dion DiMucci should have needed was to get involved with Phil Spector. In fact, this sedate and moving album is the sound of two elements that were made for each other.\n\nDischarge\n\nHear Nothing, See Nothing, Say Nothing (1982)\n\nIt’s the early 80s. Punk’s not dead – it just got angrier, faster and obsessed with nuclear war. Inspiring near-religious devotion from punk, metal and hardcore bands from Japan, Scandinavia and South America, this record, a document of the cold war paranoia of British youth, has become nothing less than an article of faith.\n\nThe Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy\n\nHypocrisy is the Greatest Luxury (1992)\n\nMichael Franti’s preachy, baritone-voiced pronouncements are easy to dismiss now as sounding like extracts from a social sciences module. But when this arty San Francisco outfit’s fusion of clanking industrial beats, jazz guitar, thrash metal and militant poetics gel – such as on the particularly stunning Language of Violence – they can work brilliantly.\n\nDizzee Rascal\n\nBoy in da Corner (2003)\n\nQuick-witted, fire-tongued Dizzee Rascal’s debut was a ferocious statement of intent that also stands as a landmark document of British society in the 21st century: a flare sent from the streets to the mainstream, lit by extraordinary production that did nothing less than reinvent pop music.\n\nDJ Shadow\n\nEndtroducing (1996)\n\nA pioneering album made entirely of samples by a kid from suburban California with vinyl-addiction issues. Endtroducing uses snatches of forgotten funk jams, horror movie strings and crashing beats to achieve a disorienting, dreamlike state. You won’t find this instrumental hip-hop classic in the bargain bin alongside its source material.\n\nThomas Dolby\n\nThe Flat Earth (1984)\n\nA forgotten classic of weird 80s pop, as the sound of sampling technology collides with a boundless imagination. The Flat Earth’s crepuscular blend of synth-pop, jazz and world music twists and turns while Dolby ruminates on mental illness, town planning and, on the sultry Screen Kiss, the fate of 50s Hollywood’s blacklisted screenwriters.\n\nEric Dolphy\n\nOut to Lunch (1964)\n\nOn Out To Lunch, the saxophonist/flautist and a band that featured vibist Bobby Hutcherson united two crucial strands in postwar jazz: Ornette Coleman’s emerging “New Thing” in free jazz, and Gunther Schuller’s classical-influenced “Third Stream” fusions. It’s a compelling document that is at once fractured, dissonant, deeply physical and profoundly lyrical.\n\nFats Domino\n\nThe Fats Domino Jukebox (2002)\n\nNew Orleans’ favourite son helped nudge the effervescent jazz of the 1930s that bit closer to rock’n’roll, in the process inspiring a generation of Jamaican reggae stars. His chummy voice and jaunty boogie-woogie piano beamed such bonhomie that even the break-up songs on this well-chosen compilation are cheeringly feelgood.\n\nDonovan\n\nSunshine Superman (1966)\n\nDropping acid on a Stateside trip transformed Britain’s Dylan-alike into a psychedelic visionary, three steps ahead of the pack. Guinevere brings sitar to King Arthur’s court; Celeste is a majestic drone; The Trip is a self-explanatory rave-up. Mellow Yellow was a jazzier and more rounded sequel, but this album still sounds fresh out of the box.\n\nThe Doors\n\nThe Doors (1967)\n\nThe debut that unleashed the leather-clad, shaman-obsessed Mr Mojo Risin’ on an unsuspecting world is a cyclical trip through LA psychedelia and apocalyptic rock’n’roll. The band never sounded as lean, nor Jim Morrison as wildly seductive, again.\n\nDave Douglas\n\nCharms of the Night Sky (1998)\n\nThe past quarter-century has seen the emergence of a more pastoral, reflective approach to improvisation, which some see as a sign of the inevitable shift towards Europe and elsewhere – except that one of the best examples was made by four Americans. The limpid, drummerless title track will melt your heart.\n\nDr Alimantado\n\nBest Dressed Chicken in Town (1978)\n\nA compilation of early singles that had caught the imagination of British punk rockers – Born for a Purpose is referenced by the Clash, for example – this is a terrific example of the DJ’s art. In the bizarre, poultry-themed title track is a wealth of producer Lee “Scratch” Perry’s genius.\n\nDr Dre\n\nThe Chronic (1992)\n\nDespite (or perhaps because of) its violence, misogyny and homophobia, Dr Dre’s post-NWA debut remains a defining album in music history. The Chronic introduced a host of soon-to-be-huge rappers (notably Snoop Doggy Dogg), established the prominence of the thrilling west coast G-funk sound, and catapulted gangsta rap to the mainstream.\n\nDr John\n\nGris Gris (1968)\n\nDr John’s adoption of voodoo mysticism should seem corny and gimmicky, but there’s something disquieting about his debut album’s stew of rattling percussion, gravelly vocals, female chanting and weird instrumentation. None of the umpteen covers of I Walk On Guilded Splinters can match the original for sheer marrow-chilling menace.\n\nDr Octagon\n\nDr Octagonecologyst (1995)\n\nAlthough at least one of its makers has sought to distance himself from it, this attempt to redefine rap’s boundaries ended up simply drawing new ones. Former Ultramagnetic MC “Kool” Keith Thornton’s acerbic wordplay and Dan “The Automator” Nakamura’s idiosyncratic beats (he samples Bartok on the standout Blue Flowers) became a template for “alternative” rap.\n\nNick Drake\n\nFive Leaves Left (1969)\n\nReleased when he was just 20 years old, Drake’s debut demonstrated the enormity of his talent with tracks such as Way to Blue and Cello Song. Infused with a sense of wonder and a lingering melancholy, it serves as a more subdued counterpoint to its follow-up, Bryter Later.\n\nThe Dramatics\n\nThe Best Of (1986)\n\nThe Dramatics were Stax’s great exponents of male-harmony soul. The contrasting gruff baritone of LJ Reynolds and soaring falsetto of Ron Banks combined to sublime effect on 1972’s million-selling In the Rain, a tragic-angst classic complete with strings and stormy sound effects.\n\nDream Syndicate\n\nThe Days of Wine and Roses (1982)\n\nLA’s “Paisley Underground” is a forgotten pop footnote, but at the time, little was hipper than the west coast’s attempt to meld the energy of punk with psychedelia and country. Dream Syndicate were the scene’s leaders, and their debut album showed the kids in black leather that guitar solos really could be exciting.\n\nThe Drifters\n\nThe Definitive Drifters (2003)\n\nMore members have passed through their ranks than managers at Man City, but from 50s R&B (a big influence on Elvis) through the Brill Building era to their 70s Indian summer (with hits such as There Goes My First Love), they remained the premier vocal group.\n\nDuran Duran\n\nRio (1982)\n\nThe sound of pantalooned New Romantics having it large, Rio made its creators household names. And justly so. Its sharply tailored, synth-washed pop, which included the definitive hits Hungry Like the Wolf and Save a Prayer, proved that Duran were more than just a bunch of heavily rouged faces.\n\nThe Durutti Column\n\nThe Return of the Durutti Column (1978)\n\nFormer punk turned avant-garde jazz-classical guitarist Vini Reilly and veteran jazz drummer Bruce Mitchell were one of music’s oddest but most inspired couplings. Their Factory debut combines fragility, melancholy, birdsong and electronic effects to produce soundscapes of breathtaking, fragile beauty.\n\nBob Dylan\n\nBiograph (1985)\n\nJust as the film director Todd Haynes needed six actors to play Bob Dylan in I’m Not There, so the only way to come to a proper appreciation of the great troubadour is to put his entire body of work on random shuffle. Freewheelin’,\n\nHighway 61 ­Revisited and Blood On the Tracks are individual masterpieces, each a unified piece of work that speaks most eloquently of its time and place, but none of them tells the whole story. ­Biograph, ­assembled almost a quarter of a century ­after ­Dylan first entered a recording studio, veers wildly from the Nashville crooner to the college folkie to the rock recluse to the amphetamined harlequin to the anti-war campaigner to the surrealist poet – and so on, across three CDs that follow no ­thematic or chronological logic but are all the more stimulating for their very randomness. As Dylan’s various selves parade by, we might find ourselves getting closer to an understanding of his insistence that they are not the products of an endless series of “reinventions” but instead all just one self: himself.\n\nIn 1970, with Self Portrait, Dylan created a half-hearted riposte to the bootleggers who had gathered up his studio-floor sweepings and established a market for anything to which he had ­contributed so much as a single harmonica toot. The 53-track Biograph is a more thorough, ­although still hardly rigorous, attempt to stitch ­together many of his best-known recordings – Blowin’ in the Wind, It Ain’t Me Babe, Mr ­Tambourine Man, Like a Rolling Stone, ­Positively 4th Street, Just Like a Woman, Lay Lady Lay etc – with B-sides, alternate takes and material previously ­familiar only on the black market. No one with any feeling of his work would want to be without Percy’s Song, one of his ­finest narrative ballads, the gorgeous New York studio version of You’re a Big Girl Now, or the incandescent, unstoppable version of Isis (“This is a song about ­marriage,” he spits) recorded in Montreal during the ­Rolling Thunder tour. It’s nowhere near a perfect ­anthology, by anybody’s standards, but a ­certain ­unevenness in itself makes the set\n\na more accurate ­reflection of ­Dylan’s often\n\nbemusing career.\n\nBiograph is also notable for Cameron Crowe’s lengthy sleeve essay and song notes, based on ­interviews in which Dylan spoke more frankly than ever before. No one who read this booklet properly could have been surprised when, 20 years later, the first volume of Dylan’s autobiography turned out to be more stimulating and enlightening than anything ever written about him by an outside observer. His description of pleading with his producer, Tom Wilson, to abandon the tendentious title of Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964 ­remains eloquent of his desire not to be packaged or marketed. “I knew I was going to have to take a lot of heat for a title like that,” he said. “It seemed like a ­negation of the past, which in no way was true … It doesn’t matter now.”\n\nEarl Brutus\n\nYour Majesty We Are Here (1996)\n\nThough it was released at the height of Britpop, this debut from Earl Brutus had more in common with conceptual Britart. The music provided glam-rock thunder, the personnel provided glamour – two guys at the front, just drinking – and the lyrics gave the enterprise a surprising lightness of touch.\n\nSteve Earle\n\nJust an American Boy (2003)\n\n“It is never, ever unpatriotic or un-American to question any-fucking-thing in a democracy.” The post-rehab Earle sings the post-9/11 blues at live shows across his homeland. The popular music equivalent of a Michael Moore film, but with more love songs and mandolins.\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire\n\nAll ‘N All (1977)\n\nMaurice White began his career as a drummer, and his band can sound like one enormous kit, where every crash and beat has its funky place. Songs such as Serpentine Fire and Jupiter run on sheer adrenaline; I’ll Write a Song for You is superior schmaltz; and the whole shebang is punctuated beautifully by Milton Nascimento’s Brazilian Rhyme.\n\nEcho and the Bunnymen\n\nOcean Rain (1984)\n\nThe Bunnymen never followed their contemporaries Simple Minds and U2 into full-blown stadium rock; this epic orchestral pop collection is as close as they ever wanted to get. The luscious strings, gently brushed drums and tremolo-laden guitars provide the perfect context for Ian McCullough’s crooning baritone.\n\nEdan\n\nBeauty and the Beat (2005)\n\nA rapper-producer of prodigious gifts, the Bostonian Edan Portnoy straddles the gap between bedroom genius and the slightly nerdy modes of white B-boy hip-hop creativity. His second LP is barely half an hour long, but it is packed with more and better ideas than most MCs can find to pad out three 74-minute plod-a-thons.\n\nEek-A-Mouse\n\nWa-Do-Dem (1981)\n\nNamed after a hopeless horse he persisted in betting on, Eek-A-Mouse helped reggae smile again following Bob Marley’s death. With its nonsense scat rhymes and tales of romantic misadventure, Wa-Do-Dem is a stunning early example of the dancehall sing-jay’s craft: malevolent rhythms leavened by Eek’s cheeky “biddy-beng-beng” croon.\n\n801\n\n801 Live (1976)\n\nFormed around the old Roxy Music buddies Brian Eno and Phil Manzanera, 801 promised to be one of the best groups of the 70s, but the original lineup survived for only a few months. Thankfully, their Queen Elizabeth Hall concert was recorded for posterity; it includes dazzling versions of Tomorrow Never Knows and Eno’s Baby’s On Fire.\n\n808 State\n\nEx:El (1991)\n\nTheir 1989 single Pacific State had an enormous impact on the development of acid house, techno and ambient. But it was Ex:El, released at the height of Madchester, that was 808’s electronic dance masterpiece, featuring vocal contributions from Björk and Bernard Sumner, and the hands-in-the-air Hacienda classics Cubik and In Yer Face.\n\nElastica\n\nElastica (1995)\n\nThe taut, knowing punk of Line Up and Connection, the giddy Vaseline, the harmonious clatter of Blue, the chugging new wave of Never Here: with their indelibly catchy debut, Elastica brought a tough, feminine edge to the smug lads’ club that was Britpop.\n\nDuke Ellington\n\nAt Newport 1956 (1956)\n\nEllington boldly mixed symphonic colours with the rhythmic punch of a Saturday-night dance band. By the mid-50s, though, this unique composer was out of fashion – until this thrilling live set. Saxophonist Paul Gonsalves’ marathon 27-chorus blues solo on Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue is one of jazz music’s legendary episodes.\n\nDuke Ellington/Charles Mingus/Max Roach\n\nMoney Jungle (1962)\n\nThe “triumvirate” of Roach, Mingus and Ellington produced a nervy classic, whose lessons were heeded by Medeski, Martin & Wood three decades later. It’s a one-off studio date in which everything came together like a dream: witness the energetic Wig Wise and the beautiful Fleurette Africaine.\n\nMissy ‘Misdemeanour’ Elliott\n\nSupa Dupa Fly (1997)\n\nIn collaboration with the producer Timbaland – whose signature sparse beats defined US urban music at the time – Missy Elliot made one of the most ambitious hip-hop records ever. Part Snoop, part Afrika Bambaataa, the album made Elliott the world’s highest-selling female rapper.\n\nLorraine Ellison\n\nStay With Me: The Best Of (1995)\n\nThis Philadelphia singer’s tune Stay With Me Baby has been covered by countless artists. Ellison was a huge influence on Janis Joplin, and this 23-track retrospective shows why: big-lunged, soul-baring rhythm’n’blues the way it was meant to be sung.\n\nEminem\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP (2000)\n\nOne long rant against US hypocrisy, The Marshall Mathers LP saw Eminem taking shots at everyone from Bill Clinton to Britney Spears, while mocking those who held him responsible for corrupting a nation. On the album’s masterpiece, Stan, the rapper revealed the tender, tormented side of America’s Public Enemy No 1.\n\nEn Vogue\n\nFunky Divas (1992)\n\nReinventing the Motown girl group format for the New Jill Swing era, En Vogue were an unstoppable force during the early 90s. Their weapons were a ton of attitude and some astonishing harmonies, and they wielded them with a flair that inspired a generation of R&B baby-divas.\n\nBrian Eno\n\nAnother Green World (1975)\n\nOn which Eno the prog-pop misfit passed the baton to Eno the avant-garde strategist. Here, his fragile vocals emerge sporadically out of the rippling, ambient haze. The album emerged two years after he left Roxy Music; it could have been a lifetime.\n\nBrian Eno & David Byrne\n\nMy Life in the Bush of Ghosts (1981)\n\nUnderloved at the time but hugely cherished since, this album sees Byrne and Eno travel into the heart of darkness, their art-rock fuelled and flavoured by African percussion, Egyptian pop singers and samples of crabby radio DJs and a real-life exorcism. An experiment, but utterly absorbing nonetheless.\n\nEric B & Rakim\n\nPaid in Full (1987)\n\nPaid in Full is one of hip-hop’s most innovative, influential records. Eric B broke new ground with his R&B and soul samples, while Rakim’s intricate, intelligent rhymes set standards to which many rappers still aspire. Few argued when in 2005 MTV crowned it the greatest hip-hop album of all time.\n\nESG\n\nA South Bronx Story (2000)\n\nA compilation that shows how three sisters from the Bronx in the early 80s tried to play slick funk but ended up sounding like a wonky African-American version of Joy Division. With congas. It nevertheless sounded hypnotically brilliant, and set the template for every subsequent strand of mutant disco and punk funk.\n\nEurythmics\n\nTouch (1983)\n\nTimeless synth-pop from Stewart and Lennox before they became a hoary rock act. They switch effortlessly from the melodrama of Here Comes the Rain Again to the blissful reggae lope of Right By Your Side. Jealousy is defined on Who’s That Girl?, where Lennox appears sweet when questioning her lover’s fidelity until she threatens, “Tell me!”\n\nBill Evans Trio\n\nThe Complete Village Vanguard Recordings 1961 (2005)\n\nThe piano trio is the string quartet of jazz, but it took the pianist Bill Evans, the virtuoso bassist Scott LaFaro (who died in a car crash a fortnight after these New York club recordings) and the drummer Paul Motian to uncover its true potential. Their interplay remains the template.\n\nGil Evans\n\nThe Individualism of Gil Evans (1964)\n\nJazz’s great colourist makes time stand still in his swirling, drifting recasting of Kurt Weill’s The Barbara Song, to which the young Wayne Shorter adds the most striking solo of his career, gliding wraith-like between the woodwind, French horns and harp. The rest, notably the Ravel-inspired Las Vegas Tango, is of the same order.\n\nEverly Brothers\n\nIn Our Image (1966)\n\nSouthern hoodlums with the voices of kissing angels, the Everlys took on and embraced the British beat invasion that threatened to destroy their career. Among the highlights are the violent folk-rocker Leave My Girl Alone, the hard-drinking The Price of Love (a UK No 1), and the deeply bereft It’s All Over.\n\nEverything But the Girl\n\nWalking Wounded (1996)\n\nDance snobs who dismissed EBtG overlooked how deeply the duo understood the capacity of deep house and drum’n’bass for melancholy and dislocation, and the devastating precision of Tracey Thorn’s lovelorn lyrics. Music for clubbers wondering where to go when the dancefloor clears.\n\nCesaria Evora\n\nCafe Atlantico (1999)\n\nThe greatest exponent of morna, the lyrical and exquisitely melancholic style from the Cape Verde islands, Cesaria Evora was already a grandmother by the time she became an international celebrity. Her third album showed off her gently soulful, languid but emotional voice on sad, haunting songs such as Desilusao Dum Amdjer.\n\nFaces\n\nA Nod Is As Good As a Wink … to a Blind Horse (1971)\n\nThe phrase “good time rock’n’roll band” could have been devised specifically for Faces. Boozy, deceptively ragged-sounding and of dubious moral character, Faces blurred the boundaries between business and pleasure, and recorded the consequences. The two Ronnies, Lane and Wood, are on form here – though it’s Rod Stewart’s Stay With Me that remains the high point.\n\nDonald Fagen\n\nThe Nightfly (1982)\n\nThe solo debut from half of Steely Dan had all the polish, wit and deceptively easy grooves of late-period Dan. One of pop’s first fully digital recordings, The Nightfly is a stereo buff’s delight, its songs about postwar optimism (I.G.Y.) and backyard fallout shelters (New Frontier) enhanced by rich detail and immaculate surfaces.\n\nJohn Fahey\n\nDays Have Gone By (1967)\n\nCantankerous guitarist, inventor of “American Primitive” and unwitting precursor of new age, Fahey makes innovative use of splicing and sampling. Locomotive sounds blend with his acoustic guitar to create a sparse, meditative atmosphere. A wide-open, pan-American travelogue.\n\nFairport Convention\n\nUnhalfbricking (1969)\n\nAn album that catches true pioneers at their key moment of transition: about to move away from the influence of American singer-songwriters and into the single-handed invention of British folk rock, as evidenced here by the epic A Sailor’s Life. Who Knows Where the Time Goes? is the jaw-dropping work of the late Sandy Denny.\n\nMarianne Faithfull\n\nBroken English (1979)\n\nAs startling a reinvention as pop has ever produced, Broken English was as much a document of survival as anything else. All trace of the sparrow-voiced 60s dolly bird has been extinguished here; in its place appears a gravel-throated cynic who had lived through drug addiction and infidelity and had harrowing tales to tell.\n\nThe Fall\n\nPerverted By Language (1983)\n\nHow do you choose one Fall album over another? This album is the maverick Mancunians’ career in microcosm, featuring one of Mark E Smith’s most satisfyingly complex, arch and spookily gothic prose-poems Garden), a clanking, badly recorded slouch epic (Tempo House), and a slogan-packed would-be terrace anthem (Eat Y’Self Fitter).\n\nAli Farka Touré\n\nSavane (2006)\n\nAli Farka Touré, who died in March 2006, was the finest and best-loved African guitarist of his generation. Often described as the godfather of the desert blues, he proved through his hypnotic instrumental work and singing that the blues must have originated from his home country of Mali, where he started out playing traditional instruments such as the lute-like n’goni. Born in Niafunke (where he would later become mayor) on the banks of the Niger river, he moved to the capital, Bamako, and worked at the radio station which then operated the countray’s only ­recording studio. With typical confidence, he sent his tapes to France, where he developed a following among the Malian community before establishing a r­eputation among African fans in Britain in the late 80s.\n\nHe recorded a series of classic albums, including the Grammy-winning Talking Timbuktu in 1994, but this ­album, released after his death, is arguably his finest. That’s certainly the way he saw it. The album was made when he had returned to music after a lengthy period of farming and performing civic duties. He was concerned that young Malians didn’t know enough about traditional music so he assembled a band including instruments such as the njarka fiddle and n’goni, played by the young virtuoso Bassekou Kouyate. On the opening track, Erdi, he showed the link between ancient Mali and contemporary blues by matching traditional styles with harmonica and saxophone. He produced some of the most compelling guitar work of his career on the album’s other songs, which mixed blues with Celtic-sounding influences or the sturdy reggae of the title track. Robin Denselow\n\nFatboy Slim\n\nYou’ve Come a Long Way, Baby (1998)\n\nNorman Cook’s second Fatboy Slim album defined the uplifting, breakbeat-driven Big Beat scene. But it was also a fantastic pop record. Few albums have more than one bona fide hit; in Gangster Tripping, The Rockafeller Skank, Right Here, Right Now and Praise You, this had four real belters.\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan\n\nMustt Mustt (1990)\n\nThe greatest exponent of qawwli, the devotional music of the Sufis, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan updated his songs to reach younger audiences, both in his native Pakistan and across the west. On this album, his extraordinary, soulful, rapid-fire improvised singing was backed by guitars as well as tablas and harmonium; Massive Attack rousingly remix the title track.\n\nFaust\n\nThe Faust Tapes (1973)\n\nFaust’s story beggars belief. In search of the next big thing, Polydor Germany gave them a sizable advance and installed them in a converted schoolhouse in Wümme, where they made some of the most radical music ever, edited here into the sonic equivalent of crazy paving and eventually put out by Virgin Records for 49p.\n\nFelt\n\nStains On a Decade (2003)\n\nLawrence Hayward’s Felt defined 80s British indie as well as any group. They were tortured by obscurity, yet capable of moments of baroque pop genius – the best of which are gathered on this retrospective. Hayward’s chart dreams were probably not helped by his habit of giving his best tunes titles such as Dismantled King Is Off the Throne.\n\nIbrahim Ferrer\n\nBuenos Hermanos (2003)\n\nBacked by Ry Cooder’s dream team – the jazz bassist Cachaito, the surf-rock guitarist Manuel Galbán and the Blind Boys of Alabama on backing vocals – Ferrer’s effortlessly soulful voice has never sounded better: crooning the boleros, rolling his Rs on the salsas and making staggering vocal improvisations sound as casual as clearing his throat.\n\nPedro Luis Ferrer\n\nRustico (2005)\n\nA true original and eccentric, Pedro Luis Ferrer is a Cuban singer-songwriter who plays the country’s small local guitar, the tres. He is backed here by the powerful and intense vocals of his daughter, Lena, on charming and thoughtful songs that range from the surreal to angry social commentary. Translations are thankfully provided.\n\nBryan Ferry\n\nThe Bride Stripped Bare (1978)\n\nAfter Jerry Hall left him for Mick Jagger, Ferry produced the most emotional music of his career. The Roxy frontman’s bleak, contemplative mood fires Sign of the Times and The In Crowd, and makes his third solo set – recorded in wintry Montreux- a rare combination of style, substance and anguish.\n\nLupe Fiasco\n\nLupe Fiasco’s Food and Liquor (2006)\n\nWith rap supposedly going to the dogs, Lupe Fiasco’s debut proved that there was plenty still left for the music to explore. Whether mind-melding his inner-city block into a giant toy robot (Daydreamin’), skewering hypocrisy in the so-called “war on terror” (American Terrorist) or telling tales of skateboard kids (Kick, Push), the Chicagoan’s complex songwriting has made him stand out.\n\nFiery Furnaces\n\nGallowsbird’s Bark (2003)\n\nNew York siblings Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger concocted that rare wonder: a bloody-minded debut album that sounded like nothing else released in a decade. A volatile cocktail of psychedelia, power-pop and punk, with disjointed lyrics floating like bittersweet cherries, it gets more intoxicating with every listen.\n\nElla Fitzgerald\n\nSings the Cole Porter Songbook (1956)\n\nFor those moments when life just seems drab, you need Ella’s ineffably buoyant readings of Cole Porter’s ineffably witty, romantic, naughty lyrics. Her voice is so mellifluous, the swooning, swaying arrangements so poised, that the album wafts sophistication like an expensive perfume. Listening to it feels like cocktail hour, every hour.\n\nThe Flaming Lips\n\nThe Soft Bulletin (1999)\n\n“I stood up and I said ‘Yeah!'” breathed Wayne Coyne on The Spark That Bled – an apposite motto for this vibrant, expansive and fantastically life-affirming set. The sunshine riffs and queasy keyboards were tremendous; the fecund imagination and candid, yearning humanity made it a modern psychedelic classic.\n\nThe Flatlanders\n\nMore a Legend Than a Band (1990)\n\nA supergroup in reverse, the Flatlanders were the short-lived, pre-fame plaything of Texan country dudes Joe Ely, Butch Hancock and Jimmie Dale Gilmore. Released 19 years after it was recorded in 1971, recording, this is a cheery salute to long-deceased, old-timey styles. Little in country music is as drop-dead gorgeous as the twinkle and twang of Tonight I’m Gonna Go Downtown.\n\nFleetwood Mac\n\nRumours (1977)\n\nOne of the biggest-selling albums of all time, Rumours captured the sound of a band literally falling out of love with each other: it’s a soap opera played out over 40 minutes. But rather than resorting to wracked dissonance, Fleetwood Mac laid bare their lives over guitar pop so shiny, so polished, that one would barely believe they had a care in the world.\n\nThe Flying Burrito Brothers\n\nOut of the Blue (1996)\n\nThe aim, as explained by Chris Hillman, was simple: “Young guys with long hair playing country music in the group format of the day.” The result shook up the west coast in the late 60s, thanks largely to the collaboration between Hillman and Gram Parsons. This retrospective includes their finest songs: Sin City and Christine’s Tune.\n\nCelso Fonseca\n\nNatural (2003)\n\nForget Barry White – there are times when the Brazilians have the edge in late-night seduction music. And Fonseca’s effortless skill as a guitarist, producer and songwriter means that his originals (Bom Sinai or Meu Samba Torto) and standards (The Night We Called It a Day) sound just as good in the morning.\n\nRoberto Fonseca\n\nZamazu (2007)\n\nAfter paying his dues with the Buena Vista Social Club, the Cuban pianist Roberto Fonseca made this great world-jazz album. He has a gift for melody, demonstrated in tracks such as Clandestino and El Niejo, plus a virtuosity that can hold its own on any jazz stage in the world.\n\nForest\n\nFull Circle (1970)\n\nDisciples of the Incredible String Band, this Midlands outfit were more melodically gifted and less scatty. Conjuring up will-o’-the-wisps and Jabberwocky ghosts, songs such as Hawk the Hawker, Graveyard and Bluebell Dance are as close to the songs of Bagpuss as to those of Fairport Convention.\n\nForever Amber\n\nThe Love Cycle (1968)\n\nThe songs were written by a vocally challenged lawyer, performed by an amateur Cambridge band he met in a record shop, and recorded in a Hitchin attic. So far, so DIY. But the songs are exquisite, and reside in the same English baroque cottage as the Zombies’ Odessey and Oracle.\n\nFour Tops\n\nReach Out (1967)\n\nThe Four Tops were diamonds in the Motown crown. This was their last Holland-Dozier-Holland production and their shiniest moment, spawning the hits Reach Out I’ll Be There, Bernadette and Standing in the Shadows of Love. Notable also for Smokey Robinson’s galloping Wonderful Baby and a jumpy take on the Monkees’ I’m a Believer.\n\nPeter Frampton\n\nFrampton Comes Alive (1976)\n\nA pretty neat encapsulation of the airbrushed radio rock that defined the musical appetites of post-Watergate America, perhaps best digested in combination with Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours. As proved by Show Me the Way, the ex-Humble Pie man wasn’t a bad songwriter – and any album featuring something called Doobie Wah can’t be all bad. There again …\n\nFranco and OK Jazz\n\nOriginalite (1999)\n\nCongolese music dominated African dance styles for three decades, and OK Jazz were the best-known, best-loved band in the country, thanks largely to their guitarist, composer and singer, Franco Luambo Makiadi. These mid-50s recordings, recorded when he was still a teenager, show his mature, driving guitar work on a typically cheerful selection.\n\nJackson C Frank\n\nJackson C Frank (1965)\n\nAfter escaping a fire that killed most of his schoolfriends, the Buffalo-born Frank used his insurance cheque to flee to London, where he recorded his only album. It remains a cornerstone of the 60s Soho folk scene: Carnival and Blues Run the Game are still staples for both Bert Jansch and buskers alike.\n\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood\n\nWelcome to the Pleasuredome (1984)\n\nFrankie’s debut hasn’t worn well. The high-shine homoerotic electro-pop (produced by Trevor Horn) that once seemed cutting-edge now sounds self-conscious and contrived, and Holly Johnson’s yappy vocals grate. But it’s worth hearing as a guide to a band who generated enormous controversy for a few giddy months.\n\nAretha Franklin\n\nNever Loved a Man the Way That I Love You (1967)\n\nThe title track gave the down-on-her-luck Franklin a hit; Respect and Do Right Woman – Do Right Man made her a feminist icon. Her debut for Atlantic oozes sex, but never strays far from her gospel roots, especially on A Change Is Gonna Come, a poignant homage to Sam Cooke.\n\nFranz Ferdinand\n\nFranz Ferdinand (2004)\n\nInjecting a welcome dose of snappy pop and Weimar glamour into the post-punk revival, this Scottish four-piece’s huge crossover success threw down the gauntlet, challenging indie pretenders to raise their game. The record’s feral, wiry basslines, sexually ambiguous lyrics and flirtatious vocals never fail to get pulses racing.\n\nFree\n\nFire and Water (1970)\n\nHome to All Right Now, Fire and Water – Free’s third album – is a prime cut of dirty, slow-burning UK blues rock. Only just out of their teens, Free cut rock’n’roll loose from psychedelia with hard-edged ballads such as Heavy Load and Oh I Wept.\n\nThe Free Design\n\nSing for Very Important People (1970)\n\nThis New York family band’s jazz-sparkled sunshine pop found its natural home in this gorgeous album for children. Bright, sugary harmonies, sprightly flutes and gently skittish drums accompany stories of little cowboys, scarlet trees and bubbles. There are plenty of psychedelic twangs and tics to swing the grown-ups, too.\n\nVon Freeman\n\nYoung and Foolish (1977)\n\nThe Chicago saxophonist Freeman’s extraordinary tone derives from an idiosyncratic mashing of Ornette Coleman, his long-time advocate Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Sonny Rollins and Coleman Hawkins. This set is an example of underrated performers – Freeman and his piano partner, John Young – sounding as good as the biggest stars in the heat of a live jam.\n\nBill Frisell\n\nHave a Little Faith (1993)\n\nJazz, folk, classical, pop – like a small-town electrical store, Frisell’s landmark album has it all. Made with an unusual jazz quintet that includes Guy Klucevsek’s accordion, it’s a kind of love letter to American music, with John Hiatt’s rolling title track and tunes by Copland, Ives, Foster, Rollins, Dylan and even Madonna.\n\nFugazi\n\n13 Songs (1990)\n\nIn Britain, the Pistols and the Clash begat PiL and Gang of Four; in the US, Minor Threat and Black Flag begat Fugazi. The “post-hardcore” tag is clumsy, but useful: here was a more musically complex, thematically broader strain of boiling-point punk, with a fascinating split-personality playoff between Ian MacKaye’s adrenalised anthems and Guy Picciotto’s artsy flounce.\n\nFugees\n\nThe Score (1996)\n\nOne of the biggest hip-hop albums of the 90s owed its success to a song that was anything but hip-hop. Fugees’ more-or-less straight cover of Roberta Flack’s Killing Me Softly allowed them to reach a crossover audience: with that song in people’s minds, the album’s pop-leavened rap found a huge and ready fanbase.\n\nThe Fugs\n\nThe Fugs’ First Album (1965)\n\nNot rock or folk, but rather a scabrous, foul-mouthed, unprovoked assault on both, by a gang of dissipated beatniks. Cheeringly unwilling to let the fact that they could hardly play a note impede the important business of upsetting people, the Fugs sound like punk’s truest precursors: thrillingly anarchic, iconoclastic and hilarious.\n\nFun Boy Three\n\nFun Boy Three (1982)\n\nIn which Terry Hall, Lynval Golding and Neville Staples flee the wreckage of the Specials, draft in as backup three good-for-a-laugh girls who can’t really sing (called Bananarama), and build a debut album around only percussion, horns and a melancholic slant on Thatcher’s Britain. Thoroughly addictive, it sounds even more eccentric now than it did then.\n\nFunkadelic\n\nMaggot Brain (1971)\n\nMixing hard rock with gospel and soul, James Brown funk jams with Hendrix guitar freak-outs, Funkadelic’s music was a kind of post-psychedelic cosmic slop. The title track is a classic showcase for the mind-bending extrapolations of Eddie Hazel, whom bandleader George Clinton ordered to play “like your momma just died”.\n\nNelly Furtado\n\nLoose(2006)\n\nAfter the failure of Furtado’s folky second album, eyebrows were raised at the news that the clean-cut Canadian popster was working with the super-producer Timbaland on an urban reinvention featuring tracks called Maneater and Promiscuous. Jaws then dropped when people heard it. Very few pop albums are as bold, original and consistent as this.\n\nBilly Fury\n\nThe Sound of Fury(1960)\n\nBilly Fury’s debut turned the one-time Ronald Wycherley into the British Elvis. The album was written entirely by Fury; its Sun Records sound, aching balladeering and raw blues provided his greatest moment before pop’s dreamboat era dulled his fire.\n\nFuture Sound of London\n\nAccelerator (1991)\n\nGarry Cobain and Brian Dougans became the Dr Strangelove of ambient techno, subjecting acid pulses and fractured breakbeats to strains of devilish experimentation. Their first, most straightforward album was the most fun. Special kudos for their majestic chill-out anthem, Papua New Guinea.\n\nPeter Gabriel\n\nPeter Gabriel 4 (1982)\n\nAlthough it contains the hit single Shock the Monkey, Gabriel’s fourth solo album was overshadowed by his third and the mega-selling So. But it is a pivotal release, marking his first foray into funky world-music grooves, which he has never explored with more energy than he does here.\n\nSerge Gainsbourg\n\nComic Strip (1996)\n\nIt’s possible that there isn’t an adult in the western world who hasn’t heard at least one song by Serge ­Gainsbourg. The trouble is, chances are equally high that the song most people have heard is Je T’Aime … Moi Non Plus, the duet he recorded in 1969 with girlfriend Jane Birkin, an erotic paroxysm that apparently plays in Nigella Lawson’s mind every time she turns on the hob. For all its merits – it gave the female orgasm some much-needed press, for a start – Je T’Aime doesn’t tell you what made Gainsbourg special, what made him not just an arch provocateur but a peerless pop radical who revolutionised his country’s music scene. For that, you need Comic Strip, the pop instalment of a three-CD collection gathering Gainsbourg’s forays into jazz and Afro-­Cuban music. It draws on the period ­between 1965 and 1969 when he soaked up US and UK pop ­influences and transformed them into a quintessentially French sound. Un Poison Violent, C’est Ça l’Amour isn’t just a pop song, it’s a philosophical tract thrashed out in a cafe ­frequented by Jean-Paul ­Sartre. Every facet of Gainsbourg’s pop personality shows. There’s the cheek of Les Sucettes, delivered so tenderly only those with an intimate knowledge of French would ­realise it’s about male appendages rather than lollipops. There’s the playfulness of Comic Strip, with Brigitte ­Bardot as a cartoon heroine. Bonnie and Clyde smoulders hypnotically and disdain pours from Requiem Pour un Con. It’s the kind of compilation that makes you wonder if the word “genius”, applied to such a songwriter, isn’t a touch mealy-mouthed. Maddy Costa\n\nGalaxie 500\n\nOn Fire (1989)\n\nThough their narcotic drone-rock clearly owed the Velvet Underground a debt, Galaxie 500 had a unique. smouldering way with power. On Fire is a delicate weave of downcast melodies and limpid rhythms. Dean Wareham’s hipster wail evinces poetry amid the mundane details of snowstorms and decomposing trees.\n\nGang of Four\n\nEntertainment! (1979)\n\nAn album of cerebral funk- and dub-inflected rock, Entertainment! was the startling debut from this Leeds four-piece, and signalled the shift to post-punk. Andy Gill’s slashing guitar style combined with Jon King’s hectoring lyrics about love as contract or disease, proving an inspiration for, among others, the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nGang Starr\n\nStep in the Arena (1988)\n\nPenfriends whose first compositions were put together over the phone, Keith “Guru” Elam and Chris “DJ Premier” Martin hit their stride on this second album. With Premier’s phenomenal flair for finding melodic but hard-hitting beats and Guru’s penchant for lyrical positivity expressed in a rich baritone, Step in the Arena began a run of records that made the duo hip-hop legends.\n\nJan Garbarek\n\n12 Moons (1993)\n\nIn Garbarek’s poignant and desolate timbre, with its evocations of wind-blown snowscapes and its quivering cries, there is a unique post-Coltrane saxophone voice. Twelve Moons beautifully balances those atmospherics with explicit references to jazz and folk.\n\nGastr del Sol\n\nThe Serpentine Similar (1993)\n\nArt rock doesn’t get much brighter or more accessible than this first outing as Gastr del Sol by the wayward experimental guitarist David Grubbs. The wonky, jagged melodies, the jazz-inflected rhythms and the meandering lyrics call to mind surrealist films in which people tilt and time accelerates: the album is that beguiling and strange.\n\nMary Gauthier\n\nFilth and Fire (2002)\n\nAfter a tough early life that included running away from home, jail and drug problems, Gauthier became one of the most compelling songwriters in America, drawing on her own experience to sing about losers, misfits and those just struggling to survive.\n\nMarvin Gaye\n\nWhat’s Going On (1970)\n\nPeriodically voted the greatest LP of all time, Gaye’s masterpiece is a benchmark soul album that transcends the genre. Provoked by the wars and social conflict of the day, the singer’s ethereal funk symphonies and anguished vocals carry social, political and environmental messages that continue to resonate.\n\nGenesis\n\nSelling England By the Pound (1973)\n\nWhen Peter Gabriel fronted Genesis in gloriously silly fancy-dress, they were the archetypal widdly-widdly prog-rock band with very long songs. Antichrists for anyone with punk fibre, the band’s impeccably crafted songs pining for medieval England are a guilty pleasure that must be experienced – if necessary, behind closed curtains.\n\nGenius/GZA\n\nLiquid Swords (1995)\n\nThe best Wu-Tang solo album. RZA’s production is on the money, the ready-made kung fu mythology is in full effect, and the rapping is, well, genius – by turns literate and menacing, the rhymes of a “child educator plus head amputator” who flows “like the blood on a murder scene”.\n\nBobbie Gentry\n\nThe Delta Sweete (1968)\n\nAn adept painter of musical pictures heavy with nostalgia, this Mississippi native and former Las Vegas showgirl oozed dreamy country-blues laced with a dose of churchy folk. Her southern-belle persona made the breezy, sultry Okolona River Bottom Band, the semi-yawning Mornin’ Glory and the swinging Penduli Pendulum all the more intimate.\n\nGet Carter\n\nOST (1971)\n\nMichael Caine on the train home to Newcastle with revenge on his mind and the hip menace of Roy Budd’s theme in his ears: film openings don’t get much better. But the likes of Getting Nowhere in a Hurry showed that the jazzman Budd could write a cracking pop song, too.\n\nStan Getz\n\nJazz Samba (1962)\n\nRecorded in a church in Washington, DC, this album introduced Brazilian music to the world, and showed how Stateside jazzmen had truly mastered the bossa nova. Charlie Byrd’s guitar provides the hypnotic pulse, but the star is tenor saxophonist Getz, sounding as though he’s out to charm every babe on the beach.\n\nGhostface Killah\n\nIronman (1996)\n\nSo named, according to his Wu-Tang Clan boss RZA, because he was “now you see him, now you don’t”, Ghostface Killah assumed more corporeal form on his astonishing solo debut. Building on the Wu’s imaginary dramas, but providing a surprisingly candid backstory, it confirmed that behind the theatrics of his flow lay a huge emotional range.\n\nRobin Gibb\n\nRobin’s Reign (1969)\n\nHis split from the Bee Gees led to talk of short-story writing, painting and musicals. This sombre album is the only evidence of his ambitions, built around epic string arrangements, lyrical Edwardiana and a wheezy drum machine – the first ever on a hit record.\n\nMichael Gibbs\n\nMichael Gibbs (1970)\n\nThe Rhodesian composer Mike Gibbs was a reluctant jazz hero. His richly nuanced debut album had an impact that resonated throughout the music, out of all proportion to its sales. Tunes such as Sweet Rain and Family Joy, Oh Boy sound as fresh as ever, with superb performances from an A-list team of British jazzers.\n\nGilberto Gil\n\nEarly Years (2004)\n\nNow Brazil’s minister of culture, in the late 60s Gil was jailed as a dangerous musical rebel by the military authorities, before being exiled to England. Many of his greatest songs are from this early Tropicalia era, including the classics Domingo No Parque and Bat Macumba. Also included is his exquisite treatment of Steve Winwood’s Can’t Find My Way Home, recorded in exile.\n\nBebel Gilberto\n\nTanto Tempo (2000)\n\nGilberto’s seductively intimate vocals, added to bossa nova and chilled electronic beats, created a pastel-shaded formula that reverberated through modernist bars and hotels worldwide. What makes Tanto Tempo work is the quality control.\n\nDana Gillespie\n\nFoolish Seasons (1968)\n\nWayne Bickerton produced the Flirtations’ Nothing But a Heartache and this psych-pop gem in the same month. Thunderous drums, harpsichords and fuzzy guitars embellish a dozen potential hit 45s. A glam/blues rethink in the 70s did her career more good.\n\nDizzy Gillespie\n\nCubana Be, Cubana Bop (2000)\n\nAfter Gillespie helped Charlie Parker launch the 1940s bebop revolution, he built a storming big band to play it – and spliced in the music of Cuba and South America. His stunning trumpet playing and audaciously exhilarating themes here define the postwar sound of modern jazz.\n\nGinuwine\n\nThe Bachelor (1996)\n\nAlong with Aaliyah’s One in a Million, Ginuwine’s debut helped invent modern R&B, thanks to the innovative beats of Timbaland. Smooth and slow, but dramatic and full of surprising rhythms, The Bachelor features the US Top 10 hit Pony, a cover of When Doves Cry and guest vocals from Missy Elliott.\n\nPaul Giovanni & Magnet\n\nThe Wicker Man OST (1973)\n\nRobin Hardy’s hugely influential cult horror film had a fantastic soundtrack, full of terrifying folk music that was composed, arranged and recorded by Giovanni’s impromptu band. Lecherous rabble-rousing drinking songs sway next to eerie jigs and reels, the mood darting wildly between innocence, danger and chilling erotica.\n\nGirls Aloud\n\nThe Sound of Girls Aloud: The Greatest Hits (2006)\n\nIn 2002, it did not seem likely that Popstars: The Rivals would add much to the sum of human happiness. But someone at Polydor broke the cardinal rule of reality-show pop and took a risk, entrusting the songwriting to a stubbornly maverick crew called Xenomania. The result shredded all expectations. Julie Burchill rightly gasped: “It’s as if pop music has been created from scratch all over again, this time perfectly.” Thus Xenomania rescued the idea of manufactured girl/boy-group pop from the dry cynicism of Westlife, restoring the labour-of-love principles of Motown’s hit factory. On their three albums together since, they have consistently asked how far you can push the sound and shape of pop while still hitting the Top 10. A multi-part romp with the abrupt verse-chorus ­disconnect of Franz Ferdinand’s Take Me Out? Try ­Biology. Cantering synth-skiffle? That would be Love Machine. Distorted electro-punk? Wake Me Up. But all Xenomania’s exertions would be wasted if Girls Aloud were mere trilling ciphers. They don’t have the distinct cartoon personae of the Spice Girls, but no matter – they are a unit, a team, a mob. Between Cheryl Cole’s quarrelsome candour, Nicola Roberts’ forbidding scowl and Sarah Harding’s falling-out- of-taxis antics, they radiate an appealing bloody-­mindedness. Years from now, when someone wants to know how bold and brilliant mainstream British pop could get in the noughties, play them this. Dorian Lynskey\n\nEgberto Gismonti\n\nSelected Works 2004)\n\nGismonti is one of those extraordinary characters who fits hardly anywhere, yet is welcomed everywhere – for his fiery, uncompromising piano playing, his extraordinary solo guitar performances and his creative collaborations.\n\nRobert Glasper\n\nIn My Element (2007)\n\nAlso known for his work with hip-hop heavyweights such as Jay Z, Kanye West, Q-Tip and J Dilla, this Blue Note set sees the Atlanta pianist in full-on jazz mode: subtly funky, deeply meditative and thrillingly inventive, mashing up Radiohead with Herbie Hancock and slyly replicating J Dilla’s cut-and-slash production sound acoustically.\n\nGlobal Communication\n\n76:14 (1994)\n\nThe West Country duo Tom Middleton and Mark Pritchard shunned song titles, lest they colour the listener’s response. This unfathomably beautiful out-of-time masterpiece, informed equally by Brian Eno, David Sylvian, Detroit techno and the Cocteau Twins, could be a soundtrack to anything or nothing. Two awestruck fans, Pete and Katrina Lawrence, were inspired to found the Big Chill.\n\nThe Go! Team\n\nThunder, Lightning, Strike (2005)\n\nThe Go! Team’s debut was the vision of Ian Parton, a bedroom boffin obsessed with cop-show themes, retro musicals and early hip-hop. Aided by Ninja’s cheerleader-style rapping, the Brighton sextet’s debut demanded to be danced to. And, for those of a geekier disposition, each listen harboured a fresh new game of spot-the-sample.\n\nThe Go-Betweens\n\nTallulah (1987)\n\nEvery Go-Betweens album is fantastic, but here Robert Forster and Grant McLennan’s songwriting partnership attained a perfect balance. McLennan’s romanticism and his startling ability to evoke his Australian homeland – both of which are audible on the remarkable Bye Bye Pride – are set against Forster’s dark, mysterious tales of brooding outsiders and relationship an"
