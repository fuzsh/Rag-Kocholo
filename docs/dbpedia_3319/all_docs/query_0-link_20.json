In July of 1997, my husband, daughter Lindsay, and I went to visit and we had a wonderful time. Both very loving people, we enjoyed several afternoons with them, looking at pictures, talking about bygone days and even went on a town tour with Uncle Pete, when he showed us many of the places that held significance in his youth.\n\nIn the months since that visit, Aunt Joanne and I spoke often on the phone. She would call me every month or so if I hadn't called and ask why I hadn't called her. We had great conversations and I felt that I had gotten to know her somewhat. She was a sweet woman, who was adored by her children and grandchildren. She was not well when I saw her, and her daughter Ann has said that she was sicker than she let on but she didn't let it keep her from having a get together at their home on Sand Bank Road and coming to Eric's house in Massachusetts for a good old fashioned meal of New Orleans gumbo and potato salad, courtesy of my husband Clint.\n\nShe knew of my trip in July 1998 to New York and said that she was looking forward to me coming to see her. I regret deeply that I will not see her or talk with her again. I feel her loss deeply and feel especially cheated by the years that passed when I did not know that they had returned to Berlin and could not find them.\n\nI continue to stay in touch with Uncle Pete and will spend as much time with him as I possibly can this summer.\n\nRest in peace, Aunt Joanne.
