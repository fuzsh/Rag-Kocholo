William Adams served in Dutchess 7th militia (from now Putnam area). He was the son of John Adams (called Sr.) and had siblings Jesse Adams (d. 1781 in the Williamsburg VA in Rev.), Mary (Adams) Tompkins and Pvt. Major Adams.

WILLIAM MATTHEWS, b. 1808 in Durham, married Mary Ann ALLEN of Schoharie County. Their children, born in Greene and Schoharie counties, were: John McCinsey, b. 1832, d.y.; William Tyler, b. 1834, d.y.; Albert P., b. 1835, to Carroll County, IL; Phebe Ann, b. 1837, to Ogle County, IL; Milissa E., b. 1839, d. y.; Calbert, b. 1841; John Watson*, b. 1844, to IL, IA, NE; William B., b. 1845, to Lee county, IL; and Charles, b. 1844, d. y.

Pamela Moore Leitt Libertina01@comcast.net\n\nLooking for information on these families: MOWER, CRAW, COLE, VANSTEENBURGH Doug Leary DE990561@aol.com\n\nIÂ’m looking for information on the marriage of Ezra Margison and Sally Brewer/Burns of Hunter. The Church Register of the Presbyterian Church of Hunter, NY lists the marriage of Ezra Magerson and Sally Brewer of Hunter in Nov 1839. The Hunter Presbyterian Church Minute Book lists the marriage of Ezra Margison and Sally Burns also in Nov. 1839. Her grave is in Evergreen Cemetery in Tannersville, but unfortunately lists her only as Â“Sally Ann, w/o Ezra Magerson, d. August 28, 1849, aged 28y10m17d.Â” There are other Brewers buried at the same cemetery, so I think her last name was Brewer. I havenÂ’t found EzraÂ’s grave yet, but think it may be somewhere in Sullivan County.

Any help would be great and will share my history. Gerry Reniger gerryreniger@modempool.com\n\nI am researching the above lines as follows: My great great grandfather was John A. MATTHEWS, b. 1803, d. 1859. He came\n\nfrom Columbia Co., and was father to my great grandfather Lauren A. Matthews. His other children were: Margaret, John Jr., George, William and Hannah Alice. He lived in Ashland. I am looking for his parents and ancestral line. He married Selina Hosford. My great great grandmother was Selina HOSFORD, b. 1804, d. 1884. I believe that her father was Pitt Hosford, because the Hosford genealogy lists a female born at the right time for her age and because I proved that Elizabeth Hosford, also listed as a female who was born at the right time for her age, was his daughter. Elizabeth named one of her daughters Selina, which was not a much used name even then. Also, they all lived in the same part of Greene Co. Pitt lived in Jewett and Selina married John, who lived in Ashland. Elizabeth married James Tompkins and they are buried in West Settlement in Ashland; therefore, they probably lived in Ashland too. There is some confusion between Pitt and Peter Hosford who lived in the same time period. In the register book, the handwriting is pale and hard to read, but\n\nwhen the Clerk looked up Hosford for Elizabeth's birth, what appeared to be Peter was actually Pitford. This has caused confusion, because Pitford was known as Pitt and without seeing the actual register, it would be easy to think the name Peter. The evidence I have found leads to the conclusion I have made, but any further proof would be good. Lois GROAT was my great great grandmother and was married to Lauren Matthews. She was b. 1841, d. 1861 of diptheria. She lived and died in Ashland. On census, she is named as daughter of John and Mercy Groat; however, they are too old to be her parents and I suspect that she is a grandaughter; but, not proved. I would like to prove that, but also to find the parents and ancestral line of John Groat. John came from Columbia Co., Mercy from Connecticut. In Beer's History of Greene Co., I found \"Asahel Disbrow, father of Ezra, the husband of my informant, Mrs. Disbrow, removed from Fairfield, CT, 1799 and found a house in West Settlement, to and from which he went by marked trees. Mr. Groat, father of John and\n\ngrandfather of Henry Groat, lived at the head of Sutton Hollow, and Mr. Disbrow lived in Mr. Groat's house till his own was built.\"\n\nI have no proof that is the same family, but it may be as there were very few Groats in the area. John lived in Ashland 40 years, Mercy 20.\n\nElizabeth P. SIMPKINS is also my great great grandmother, b. 1829 in Jewett, d. 1903 in Jewett. She married Asa Lord and their son, Collins, is my great grandfather. She had a brother named Daniel P. Simpkins, also b. Jewett. Daniel's death certificate gives that their father was Samuel Simpkins of Greenville and that their mother's name was Catherine and she was born in Jewett. There is speculation that the middle initial (P) that Daniel and Elizabeth share might stand for Parker, but not proved. Another supposition is that it was Catherine O'Brian of another old East Jewett family. Catherine probably died young, as Samuel later married Hepzabah Haines of Haines Falls and moved west. Any information will be most appreciated.Mignon\n\nN I would like to get in contact with researchers of Daniel NORTON and his wife, Sarah STONE.

He might be the son of Andreas Simon and Anna Margaretha Pulver Simon, of Columbia Co. NY??\n\n2) Lucinda SIMMONS (1815-1905) and husband Jacob GARRISON (1813-1885), of Cairo.

July 13, 1810 and died June 11, 1879. He lived in Ashland, Greene Co, NY and is buried in Pleasant Valley Cem in the same town. He married LAVINIA HANER ( 1826-1907) They had 5 children, but one died young. There is a strong possibility that Judah was previously married to HENRIETTA CLAFLIN from nearby Lexington ( and had 3 children ) . There was a GEORGE W. SPENCER from Prattsville, Greene Co, NY who claimed J.M SPENCER as his father when he was in the Civil War. The time frame is possible for Judah to have had another family before marrying LAVINIA HANER. Of course, this is only my theory , but also a very probable theory,.
