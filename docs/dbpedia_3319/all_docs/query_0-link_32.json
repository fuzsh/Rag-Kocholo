John MAGEE]\n\nAn enumeration of those men of the present generation who have won honor and public recognition for themselves and at the same time have honored the state to which they belong, would incomplete were their failure to make prominent reference to the one whose name initiates this paragraph, His business interests have been of a most important and extensive character, and his marked enterprise and extensive control of industrial and commercial interests have made him a leading factor in the Empire\n\nstate and one whose influence is felt even beyond its borders. He has been and is distinctively a man of affairs and one who has wielded a wide influence. A strong mentality, an invincible courage, a most determined individuality have so entered into his make-up as to render him a natural leader of men and a director of opinion. It is true that he became interested in a business already established, but in controlling and enlarging business enterprises many a man of even considerable resolute purpose, courage and industry has failed. Colonel Magee has demonstrated the truth of the maxim that success is not the result of genius but the outcome of a clear judgment and experience.\n\nOn the 2d of December, 1867, in the town of Watkins, Mr. Magee was born, his parents being General George and Emma S. (Stothoff) Magee. His distinguished father is mentioned in another page of this volume. At the usual age Colonel Magee entered the public schools where he pursued his studies for a number of years and for four years was a student it Lawrenceville, New Jersey, afterward completing his education in Europe under the direction of a private tutor. After his return to America he became identified with the Fall Brook Coal Company and for one year was located in Antrim, Pennsylvania. Although the son of a wealthy father he did not choose to become a simple looker on in the business world but desired to become a factor in controlling extensive business interests and to this end he closely applied himself to the mastery of the business in all of its branches both in principle and detail. Removing from Antrim to Corning, New York he was there identified with the shops of the Fall Brook Railway Company for a year and later he spent several months in the Schenectady Locomotive Works of Schenectady, New York, returning thence to Corning. He familiarized himself with the work of the many offices of the Fall Brook Railway Company gaining a practical knowledge of all branches of railroading and of the coal and coke business which was operated by his father General Magee. Subsequently the son was made secretary of the Fall Brook Railway and acted in that capacity until his father's death in 1897 when he was chosen to the presidency of the Fall Brook Coal Company, the Morris Run Coal Company, the Chest Creek Land and Improvement Company and the Tioga Improvement Company of which he was also a director. His previous thorough training well fitted him to take up the onerous and responsible duties which now devolve upon him. With broad foresight he looked over the business field, recognized its possibilities and became an active factor in directing the work. He was also elected the president of the Syracuse, Geneva & Corning Railroad. The extent and volume of his business interests indicate his marked capability and the workings of. a master mind. He is a director of the Knickerbocker Trust Company, of New York City; the Troy Trust Company, of Troy, New York; the North River Coal & Wood Company, the Philadelphia Dock and Terminal Company; the Elmira Trust Company, of Elmira, New York; the Clark Hoisting & Barge Company; the Beech Creek Coal & Coke Company of New York;\n\nthe Pocahontas Collieries Company of Pocahontas, Virginia; and is identified with many other business enterprises of broad scope and magnitude.\n\nOn the 4th of November, 1891. Colonel Magee was united in marriage to Miss Florence Wetmore Seeley, a daughter of Dr. N. R. and Mary (Stewart) Seeley, of Elmira, New York. He has many social relations, being connected with a large number of the\n\nmost influential clubs of the city, of which the following is but a partial list: The Union, Racquet, Tennis, Calumet, Midday, Jockey, Jekyl Island, Elmira City, Elmira Country, Corning City, Corning Country, Genesee Valley, Watkins City, Ardsley, Casino and many other clubs. While Colonel Magee. has never sought political prominence, he has figured to some extent in public affairs relating to the welfare of the state. In 1891 he was appointed state engineer for New York by Governor Flower, and later resigned that position to accept the position of aid de camp to Governor Flower, acting in that capacity for three years. Colonel Magee stands to-day as one of the best known men of New York and Pennsylvania, and his influence is felt in business relations throughout much of the east. His career has ever been such as to warrant the trust and confidence of the business world, for he has ever conducted all transactions on the strictest principles of honor and integrity. His devotion to the public good is unquestioned and arises from a sincere interest in his fellow men. He has a wonderful capacity for work and the supervision of the details as well as the principles in his extensive business affairs. What the world needs is such menmen capable of managing extensive concerns and conducting business on terms that are alike fair to the employer and to the employe. His personal characteristics are such as made him a social favorite and those who meet him in such relation are glad to number him as a friend.\n\nClarence Newell ELLIS\n\nBorn 12 Oct 1864 at Roaring Branch, PA. Son of Charles B. ELLIS and Lucy NEWELL. Charles B., the father, was born in Enfield, Tompkins co., NY on 26 Oct 1824 and was a teacher in Lycoming and Tioga counties in Pennsylvania. Clarence N.

GRAY of Newark, NJ on 24 Oct 1885; they had one daughter Marion F. and Fanny died in Roaring Branch, PA. Clarence was married second to Kathryn DeCOURCY of Roaring Branch, PA in Apr. of 1888; they had 2 children Hazel R., and Edna K. (the latter was born in Montour Falls). Clarence was transfered in 1892 to Montour Falls, then to Watkins. He was a Mason and attained the highest chapter office of high priest; he was also a Knight Templar.\n\nJohn Wesley TOWNSEND\n\nJohn W. Townsend, who is an honored veteran of the Civil war and upon the battlefields of the south manifested his loyalty to the Union, is a representative of one of he prominent families of Schuyler county. In days of peace he has been equally faithful to his country and is now regarded as one of the leading representatives and valued citizens of Schuyler county, making his home in North Hector, where he is capbably filling the office of justice of the peace and is also engaged in the real estate business.\n\nJohn Wesley Townsend was born in Hector, Schuyler county, June 11, 1838, and is a son of Jeremiah and Belinda (Bailey) Townsend. The father was a native of Delaware and when a young man came to New York, becoming one of the early settlers of Schuyler county. He was a soldier of the war of 1812 and was taken prisoner at Black Rock near Buffalo. He was married in Schuyler county to Miss Belinda Bailey, a daughter of John Bailey, who came here from Connecticut at an early day.\n\nOur subject pursued his education in the early subscription schools and when he had put aside his text books, he began learning\n\nthe wagon-maker's trade, which he followed continuously until after the Civil war broke out. Being unable to content himself longer at home while the Union was in danger, he offered his services to the government, enlisting as one of the boys in blue of Company A. Fiftieth Regiment of Volunteer Engineers. He was mustered in at Elmira as a musician. It was on the 18th\n\nof September. 1861, and he served continuously until June. 1865, in the meantime being promoted to the rank of corporal July 28, 1862. He was made sergeant on the 5th of January, 1863, and on the 22d of February. 1864, he re-enlisted at Washington, D. C., as sergeant, being mustered out with that company on the 13th of June, 1865, at Fort Barry, Virginia. He participated in the battle of Yorktown and those of the peninsular campaign under General McClellan. He took part in the battle of Fredericksburg under General Burnside, December 11, 1862; the battle of Chancellorsville; Franklin Crossing, June 5, 1863; the Gettysburg campaign; and the engagement at Harper's Ferry. After the battle of Fredericksburg a pontoon bridge was swung across the Rappahannock river, the Union troops being on one side, the Confederates on the other. One night at a council of the Union officers it was decided to send the Fiftieth New York Infantry to take this bridge, but before sending the whole regiment it was deemed advisable to send a dozen men as scouts into the hollow where the bridge spanned the stream to see what was to be seen, and Mr. Townsend was one of the brave men who volunteered. Before the battle of Fredericksburg Captain Perkins had been shot and killed on the bridge, and our subject was one of the four chosen for the daring undertaking of bringing the body to the shore. He was with the company and regiment in all of their campaigns, and was ever a faithful soldier, always found at his post of duty, whether in the thickest of the fight or on the lonely picket line. He then returned to Hector, where he engaged in wagon-making, following that pursuit for many vears, but for the past twenty years he has devoted his attention to the undertaking business, and has the patronage of many of the best families of this portion of the county.\n\nMr. Townsend was united in marriage to Miss Sarah Milliman, a daughter of Andrew and Cornelia (Henry) Milliman. Two children were born unto them: Bert M., who is now living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Walter J., who makes his home in New York City, so that Mr. and Mrs. Townsend are again as they were when they started out upon their married lifealone in their own home. In religious faith Mr. Townsend is a Methodist, belonging to the church at North Hector, in which he has served as steward for a number of years. He is a stanch Republicm in his political views, unswerving in his allegiance to the party and he has been honored with a number of local offices. For fifteen years he has held the office of justice of the peace and he discharges his duties without fear or favor his decisions being strictly fair and impartial. In 1898 he was appointed postmaster of North Hector so that he is holding the office at the present time. He was also appointed justice of the sessions and held that office for one year. Socially he is identified with Daniel B. Smith Post No. 423, G. A. R., of North Hector, and has served as officer of the day almost continuously since the organization of the post. Mr. Townsend is a gentleman of genuine worth of character and genial manner and of marked enterprise. His record as a soldier, as a private citizen and as a public official is above reproach and all who know him entertain for him warm regard. Both he and his wife have a large circle of friends in Schuyler county and the hospitality of\n\nthe best homes of North Hector and the community is extended to them.\n\nJohn HALWICK\n\nBorn in Ulster co., NY on 20 Apr 1825 and died in 1895.

He is now filling the position of county sheriff and no more worthy incumbent has ever held the office. Discharging his duties without fear or favor, such a man is regarded as a bulwark of safety by the law abiding citizens and is a menace to all evil doers.\n\nMr. Tucker was born in the town of Orange, Schuvler county, on tlie 17th of December, 1853, and is a son of Alonzo and Selecta (Matthews) Tucker. During his early boyhood his parents removed to Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, and in 1872 the father went to Monterey [Town of Orange, Schuyler co.], New York. He served as supervisor of the town of Orange and was elected county\n\nsuperintendent of the poor. He was a tinner by trade and for many years was engaged in the hardware business but at length met with disaster, his store being destroyed by fire. Widely known as an enterterprising, reliable mechant and as a capable official, he commanded the respect and confidence of his fellow men and at his death, which occurred in October, 1888, the community felt that it had lost a valued citizen. His wife died in February, 1900. They were the parents of three children: William J., of this review; Hattie, who is the wife of E. V. Moore, a business man of Beaver Dams; and Frank, who is engaged in merchandising in Odessa [Town of Catharine, Schuyler co.], New York.\n\nWilliam J. Tucker began his education in the district schools of the town of Orange and afterward continued his studies in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, to which place he had accompanied his parents during boyhood. For fourteen years he worked at the tinner's trade, having learned the business under the direction of his father, and later he went to Savona, where he embarked in the hardware business, conducting his enterprise there for some years. On the expiration of that period he removed to Beaver Dams and four years later to Monterey, continuing to successfully carry on that business until his election to the office of county sheriff. As a merchant he studied closely the needs and demands of the public and by his courteous treatment of his customers, his\n\nreasonable prices and his fair and honest dealing he won a liberal patronage.\n\nMr. Tucker's worth and ability being recognized by his fellow townsmen he has been frequently called to public office, and in the discharge of his official duties he has shown loyalty and public spirit. He is a Stalwart Republican and keeps well informed on the issues of the day, and is inflexible in his support of the principles of the party. He was first elected town constable and has since served as town clerk, constable and collector, and chairman of the board of supervisors for one year. He was elected supervisor by a majority of forty in a Democratic township. On the expiration of his first term he was again nominated, running against the man who had been his first opponent, and that he received the endorsement of the public is shown by the fact that he was once more elected, the second time receiving a majority of twenty-six. De Zeng Seaman was his opponent during his race for the office of sheriff, and at that election, which occurred in 1900, he defeated his opponent by a majority of three hundred and twenty-seven. He is now serving in the office in a manner that shows that the trust reposed in him is well placed. He displays neither fear nor favor in discharging his official duties but stands for law, order and justice.\n\nOn the 22d of June, 1882. Mr. Tucker was united in marriage to Miss Dorothy Moore, a daughter of Martin and Catherine (Putnam) Moore, natives of Fulton county, New York. Unto our subject and his wife have been born three children: Ola, who is now a student in the schools of Watkins ; Frank B., who is also attending school; and Clayton A., a little lad of four summers.\n\nWhen but twenty-two years of age Mr. Tucker was made a member of the Masonic fraternity, becoming a member of Orange Lodge, No. 621, F. & A. M. He passed all of the chairs and served as master in that lodge. After his removal to Steuben county, New York, he also served as master of Savona Lodge, No. 762, filling that position with marked ability until his return to Schuyler county. He raised forty-eight Masons in four years. He has passed all of the chairs of Orange Lodge and is one of the distinguished members of the craft in this portion of the state. He has also taken the degrees of the chapter and belongs to St. Omer's Commandery, No. 19, K. T. of Elmira, and to Kalurah Temple, of Binghamton. Mr. Tucker is likewise connected with Tomoka Lodge, No. 196, I. 0. 0. F. He is widely and favorably known throughout this portion of the state, his ability well fitting him for leadership in political, business and fraternal life. The terms progress and patriotism might well be considered the keynote of his character, for throughout his career he has labored for tlie improvement of every line of business or public interest with which he has been associated and at all times has been actuated by fidelity to his country and welfare.\n\nHon.

George Jefferson MAGEE\n\n[son of John MAGEE]\n\nHonored and respected by all, there has been no resident of Schuyler county who has occupied a more important position in industrial and commercial circles than did General George Jefferson Magee of Watkins, not alone on account of the brilliant success he achieved, but also because of the honorable, straightforward business policy he ever followed. He possessed untiring energy, was quick of perception, formed his plans readily and was determined in their execution and his close application to business and his excellent management brought to him a high degree of prosperity. In a large measure he pushed forward the wheels of progress, upon which rested the material and substantial upbuilding of the state. He controlled interests of vast magnitude with an ability that indicated a master mind a clear calm judgment, and accurate recognition of possibility.\n\nGeneral Magee was born in Bath, Steuben county, New York, March 17, 1840. His father was the late John Magee, a successful banker of Bath, who became the owner of extensive coal mines in Pennsylvania and was likewise interested in the organization and construction of railroads in New York and in the Keystone state. He also figured prominently in public affairs and for four years represented his district in the council chambers of the nation as a member of congress. His paternal ancestors came from County Antrim, Ireland, in 1756, and settled near Easton, Pennsylvania, and the family history is given more fully on another page of this volume- His mother's people came from Ayrshire, Scotland, and his mother from the north of England, settling in Loudoun county, Virginia, about the time the Magee family was established here.\n\nIn the public schools of Bath General Magee began his education, which he continued in Albany and in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, and in 1860 he was graduated in Princeton College. He then entered upon his business career as an employe of the Steuben County Bank at Bath, and later became connected with the mining interests at Fall Brook, Pennsylvania. Subsequently he spent about eighteen months in traveling in Europe, after which he returned to the office of the Fall Brook Coal Company in Watkins, New York, and became familiar with his father's extensive business investments and interests, so that he was well qualified to assume an important business relation in these connections, at his father's death. On the death of John Magee, the president of the Fall Brook Coal Company and of the Blossburg & Corning Railroad Company, General Magee became the vice president of each and upon the death of Duncan S. Magee, in June, 1869, he succeeded to the presidency of both concerns.\n\nAt the death of his father, on the 5th of April, 1868, General Magee inherited a large property and was thereafter occupied with the interests which engrossed his father's attention. He became a trustee of his father's estate, which included the entire ownership of the bituminous coal interests represented by the Fall Brook Coal Company in Tioga county, Pennsylvania, together with the railroad property connected with the mines. The development and extension of these interests formed the life work of General Magee. He was instrumental in the building of the Wellsboro & Lawrenceville Railroad, later a part of the Fall Brook Railway system and now a part of the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad, projected and secured the building of the Syracuse, Geneva & Corning Railway, also the Beech Creek Railway, and the Pine Creek Railway, so that beginning with the ownership by the estate of his father of a railroad line of fifteen miles in length, capitalized at less than five hundred thousand dollars, having an equipment of ten locomotives and a corresponding number of cars, the lines of railroad now owned by the same interests aggregate about one hundred miles with a capital stock of five million dollars and an equipment of seventy-six locomotives and three thousand three hundred cars used in operating two hundred and fifty miles of owned and leased lines. The old Blossburg Railroad, fifteen miles in length, the nucleus and later a part of through system of railroad known as the Fall Brook line, reaching from the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad at Lyons and from Geneva to Williamssport, Pennslvania, a distance of one hundred and eighty-five miles, connecting with the Philadelphia & Reading road. These extensions and connections were made during the presidency of General Magee and were planned and carried to a successful completion by him. The Cowanesque Valley branch of the same system was built in the same period from the main line to Ulysses in Potter county, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn connection with his railroad building General Magee had other extensive business interests, which proved of great value and importance to the state as well as contributing to his individual prosperity. He was the projector, contractor and first general manager of the well known Beech Creek Railroad, having one hundred and fifty miles of line and now a part of the New York Central system, reaching from Jersey Shore on the Pine Creek Railvvay to the coal mines in Clearfield and Cambria counties, Pennsylvania. He was also the president of the Fall Brook Coal Company, the Fall Brook Railroad, the Morris Run Coal Mining Company, the Tioga Improvement Company, and the Syracuse, Geneva & Corning Railroad Company; vice president of tlie Pine Creek Railroad: and a director of the Chest Creek Land & Improvement Company, of Cambria county, Pennsylvania, the Beech Creek Cannel Coal Company, of Clearfield county, Pennsylvania, the Beech Creek Railroad, the Central Dock & Terminal Company, of Buffalo, New York, the North River Coal & Wharf Company of Jersey City, and of the Knickerbocker Trust Company, of New York. These but serve to indicate the volume and importance of the business interests with which General Magee was associated.\n\nIn 1865 General Magee was united in marriage to Miss Emma STOTHOFF, of Burdett, Schuyler county, New York, and unto them were born seven children: Anna Stothoff, John, Kathleen, Stewart, Arabella Helen, Emma Marie, Lusyd and George J.\n\nTo a man of domestic tastes, such as Mr. Magee possessed, one of the greatest pleasures which came to him from his wealth, was in providing royally for his family. No other interest was so dear to his heart as the welfare of his wife and children. He had social relations, too, of a very pleasant character and was a popular and honored member of a number of the leading clubs of the Empire state, including the Lawyers, the University, the Manhattan and the Princeton Clubs of New York city. His military title was received in 1869 under appointment of Governor Hoffman to the position of paymaster general of the state of New York. It is almost impossible to summarize a life record such as that of General Magee, for so varied were his business interests and so active was he in lines of life, pertaining to the general progress of his native state. His career was ever such as to warrant the trust and confidence of the business word, for he ever conducted all transactions on the strictest principles of honor and integrity. His devotion to the public was unquestioned and arose from a sincere interest in the welfare of his fellow men. Moreover, in the community where he lived and in the localities where he was best known, there existed between him and his associates the warmer ties of friendship and of love. He was very charitable, never refusing any worthy person who applied to him for aid.\n\nFrederick DAVIS II\n\nWas a native of Newbury, England, born 22 Oct 1824 to Frederick DAVIS Sr. and Esther LAKE.
