        "text": "History of\n\nGreene County\n\nNew York\n\nwith\n\nBiographical Sketches of its Prominent Men\n\nJ.B. Beers and Co.\n\n1884\n\nCoxsackie\n\nby William S. Pelletreau, A.M.\n\nTranscribed by Dianne Schnettler, Arlene Goodwin, Al Albright and Annette Campbell\n\nThe Town of Coxsackie is bounded on the north by the town of New Baltimore, on the east by the Hudson River, on the south by the towns of Athens and Cairo, and on the west by the town of Greenville. Its length from east to west is about seven and three quarter miles, and its width is about five miles. A ridge extends along the river front, reaching its highest point about one-eighth of a mile from the waters edge. Beyond this is a wide extent of level land, known as the Coxsackie Flats, which extend from the lower part of the town of Athens, to a line running west from the mouth of Coxsackie Creek, in the town of New Baltimore. The ranges of rocky hills which divide these flats in Athens, terminate in the southern part of Coxsackie, and the low, flat land, the garden of Greene county, extends unbroken to the base of the Kalkberg, which runs entirely through the town. Beyond this range of limestone cliffs, the country is hilly, and the lofty elevation which begins so abruptly in the town of Athens, near the village of Leeds, and which is commonly called the High Hill or Potick Mountain, terminates as abruptly in this town, about a mile east of the village of Jacksonville. To the west of this the land is not so hilly, and to the western part of the town there is considerable level land, but not so low, or so fertile, as the Coxsackie Flats. The principal stream in this town is the Coxsackie Creek, which has its head waters in a spring that flows out of the Kalkberg, near the south end of the town, on the farm of Francis Cochran. This stream runs through the flat land, and empties into the Hudson River in the town of New Baltimore. Four small streams run into it. That farthest south is a small brook called the Fountain Kill, having its source in a large fountain or spring that comes out of the Kalkberg. North of this is a stream supposed to be the outlet of Bronks Lake, and called the Stony Kill. The third rises in the hilly country west of the Kalkberg, and through a devious course flows into the Coxsackie Creek, near the middle of the flats. To the stream has been given from early times the name of Murderers Creek. The fourth stream rises in a meadow on the farm of Hiram Miller, in the town of New Baltimore, and follows almost exactly the line which divides the two towns. It flows into Coxsackie Creek about three-quarters of a mile north of the upper village. This brook was called by the Dutch settlers Diep Kil, or Deep Brook, and was the northern boundary of the Houghtaling Patent. Still farther north there is a small brook rising in a spring on the farm of Peter Henry Whitbeck in New Baltimore. To this the Dutch gave the name of Maquaas Kill, or Mohawks Brook, and was referred to in old deeds as the most southernmost kill in Coeymans Patent.\n\nIn the western part of the town the only stream of importance is Potick Creek, which is the southwestern part divides into two branches. The east branch of Potick rises in New Baltimore, while the west brand has its origin beyond the limits of the county. The junction of these streams is near the turnpike which forms the southern boundary of the town. A very small brook which flows into the east branch about a quarter of a mile south of Jacksonville, touches at one point the eastern corner of the Stighkoke Patent, and was its starting point.\n\nSources of Title\n\nThe town of Coxsackie includes, or is included within the following Patents, granted by the English governors of the province of New York, as representative of the English crown:\n\nPeter Bronks Patent; the north part of the Loonenburg Patent; the south part of Coeymans Patent; the Houghtaling Patent; the Stighkoke Patent, and the Hundred Acres granted to Casparus Bronk; the Roseboom Patent; the eastern part of the First tract granted to John Morin Scott.\n\nPeter Bronks Patent\n\nOne of the first parcels of land laid out in what is now Greene county, was purchased of the Indians by Peter Bronk, a citizen of Albany, on January 13th 1662, by deed, of which the following is a copy:\n\nAppeared before me Johannes La Montague, in the service of, etc., two Indians, the one named Sisketas, and the other named Sachemoes, the son of Keesie Wey, owners, and having authority from the other owners, of the land upon the North River, on the west bank between Martin Gerritses [Van Bergen] island and the Neuten Hocck, among the Indians, named Koxhackung; the cleared land being a parcel away in the woods (together with the kill, extending from said kill, which lies over against Marten Gerritses island, westward unto the Katskill path, from thence southward along the path to the Stenekil, thence eastward until over against the Notan Hocck, and thence northward along the river to the aforesaid kill, which lies over against Marten Gerritses island; which land and kill the grantors declare they have sold, granted and conveyed, as they do by these presents, to Pieter Bronck, inhabitants of the village of Beverwyck, with all the right and title which they, the grantors, therein have, for a certain sum in goods to be paid to the, amounting to about one hundred and fifty guilders in beavers, of which sum the buyer promises to pay the half next May, when he shall come to live there, and the other half on the first of May, A. D., 1663.\n\nThus done in Forth Orange, the 13th of January, A. D., 1662, in presence of Jan Verbeeck, Frans Barentse [pastor] and Jan Dareth, as witnesses hereto invited.\n\nThis is the mark X of Sisketas with his own hand set.\n\nThis is the mark X of Slachemoes with his own hand set.\n\nPeter Bronck.\n\nThis purchase from the Indians was confirmed by a patent granted by Gov. Richard Nicolls, June 11th 1667, recorded page 237, vol. 2, of patents, in the office of secretary of State, Albany, from which the following extract is taken.\n\nA Patent Granted upon a Purchase made by Pieter Broncks with the Consent of lycence of the Dutch Governeur Petrus Stuyvesant of the Native Indian Proprietors of the Certain Pcell of Land near Albany by the River and being on the Westside thereof between Martin Gerritsens Island and a Certain Hooke of Land Commonly called Hoock and by the Indyans Koixhacking which sd Land reacheth into the Woods & hath a Creek or Kill thereunto belonging stretching on the other side of the Kill over agst Martin Gerritsens Island it goes Westward of the woods to Kats Kill path, and running along the sd path South wards it Comes to the Stone Kill from thence it runs Eastward over against the sd Noten Hooke and so Northward along the River to the forest Kill which lyes over against Martin Gerritsens Island Conteyning in all about two hundred and fifty two acres or one hundred twenty six Martgen and one hundred & tenn Rod as by the Deed bearing dater the 13th day of Jan. 1662 and the Certificate of the Measure of the 9th day of Jan. 1665, doth appear, Now for a Confirmacon &c. R. Nicolls.\n\nThe island called in the deed Martin Gerritsens Island, is situated at the mouth of Coxsackie Creek. The north line of this patent starts from the river, a little south of the mouth of the creek. It runs nearly west, and crosses the road to New Baltimore at a point about 15 rods north of the bridge over the Coxsackie Creek, where the stream, called by the Dutch the Diep Kloof Kill, empties into it. Its western end is a the road called the Kings road, which, at that point, runs under the line of hills on the western edge of the flats. The northwest corner of the patent is on the farm of Peter Henry Whitbeck, at a point five chains south of a large elm tree. This tree stands on the western end of a stone wall, on the eastern side of the road, and opposite Mr. Whitbecks house. This line crosses the West Shore Railroad four rods north of the rock cutting. The Catskill Path forms the western boundary of the Loonenburg Patent, and the patent of Peter Bronck. The southern boundary of this patent is a line running east from the point where the Catskill Path crossed the Stony Kill. The point is very near to, if not the exact spot, where the road which leads from the house of Robert Armstrong, to the plank road, crosses it. It is about half way between the place where Bronks grist-mill formerly stood, and the mouth of the kill, where it empties into Coxsackie Creek, and perhaps 40 rods from the old Bronk homestead. The subsequent divisions of the Coxsackie Patent, which will be noticed hereafter, have entirely obliterated the southern line, but it touched the rover at the place generally called, Reeds Landing. Nutten Hook is the rocky promontory which projects into the river from the eastern shore, where the ferry landing now is.\n\nThe great discrepancy between the amount of land as mentioned, and the quantity actually contained in the patent, may require some explanation. The Dutch settlers recognized as land only what was cleared and fit for cultivation; the woodland and rocky ridges were not taken into account.\n\nIt might gratify the curious to say a few words concerning the exact locality which, according to the Dutch settlers, the Indians called by the name Koixhacking, which has been changed into Coxsackie. The name is Algonkin and means literally owl place, probably from the number of those ill boding birds which must have found a congenial place in the dense pine woods that then covered the entire country. The exact locality where the first settlement was made is probably what is now the upper village. The name given to the flats, which form so conspicuous a feature in this town and Athens, was in the Indian language Coniskeek.\n\nWe have no knowledge whether Peter Bronk ever actually lived on the tract of land thus purchased. He died previous to the year 1687, and his land descended to his son Jan Bronk, whose name with that of Marte Gerritse Van Bergen, is among the most prominent in our early history.\n\nThe Loonenburg Patent\n\nThe history of this patent is very carefully given in the history of Athens.\n\nThe Fountain Flats\n\nMarch 28th 1681, Jan Cloet, Jurian Teunisse and Myndert Fredrickse, sold the north part of the Loonenburg Patent to Marte Gerritse Van Bergen, and we appended a copy of the deed, as an illustration of the form of early conveyances of land. The record may be found in vol. III., page 107, of deeds, in the county clerks office at Albany.\n\nAppeared before me Robert Livingston Seer of Albany Colony, Rensselaerwick and Schenectady & in presence of the honorable Heeren Mr. Cornelius Van Dyck and Mr. Dirk Wessels, magistrate of the same jurisdiction, Johannes Cloete, Juriaen Teunisse & Myndert Fredrickse, who declared in true rights, free ownership, to grant convey and make over to and for the behoof of Mr. Martin Gerritse [Van Bergen], in a certain parcel of land lying on the west side of Hudsons river, over against the little Newtenhoeck, beginning from the land of Peter Bronck on the Catskill path to the fountain, and from the fountain Eastward to the hill of Steefsink, Eastward to the river, and from the river side northwards up to the lands of Hillitie Bronck aforesaid, which they the grantors, to wit, Johannes Cloete and Juriaen Teunisse, do by virtue of patent to them given by the later Governor General, of date the 25th May 1667, and Myndert Fredrickse, by virtue of conveyance to him give by Jan Bruyn, of date the 7th August 1765, which made over to him one-third his inheritance in said Patent, to which reference is herein made, and that free and unencumbered, with no liens standing or issuing against the same (saving the Lords right), without the grantors making the least pretension thereto any more, likewise acknowledging to our being paid and satisfied therefore the first penny with the last, therefore given plenam actionem cessam, and full power the aforenamed Martin Gerritse his heirs successors or assigns to do with and dispose of the aforesaid parcel of land, as he could do with his own patrimonial estate and effects, promising the same to defend against all persons, and free from all liens claims and incumbrances which may be lawful, and further never more to do nor suffer any thing to be done there against in any manner under, pledge as by law provided therefore. Done in Albany the 28 March 1681.\n\nJohannes Clute.\n\nJurian Tunessen.\n\nCornelis Van Dyck.\n\nThe mark of Myndrit X Fredrickse.\n\nDirck Wessels, his own hand set.\n\nIn my presence\n\nRob. Livingston,\n\nSeer.\n\nThe tract of land thus sold was called Fountain Flats, which name it retained till the beginning of the present century. The northern boundary was the south line of Peter Bronks Patent, as before described. The south line commenced at the river on the farm formerly owned by Dr. John Ely, now in possession of Mrs. Lewis Lampman. The stone wall on the north side of the orchard, and about 10 rods north of the house, is the original line. Its present course is N. 88 degrees W. It runs some 15 or 20 rods north of the barn on the homestead of Peter Spoor (formerly Myndert Van Schaacks) and forms the boundary between the homestead of Henry Hallenbeck, and the farm of Isaac Conklin on the rocky ridge called Myneberg. The fountain mentioned is the large spring which comes out of the Kalkberg, on the line between the farms of Jacob Armstrong and Phillip and Edward Van Allen (formerly Phillip Colliers). The hill called Steefsink, or as it is more generally spelled in old deeds, berg Stevesink, is the high elevation next east of the Kalkberg at the south end of the flats, which forms so conspicuous a feature in the landscape. The course from the fountain to the hill is some degrees south of east, but from the top of the hill it was intended to run due east to the river. The whole tract contained 1732 acres.\n\nThe Coxsackie Patent\n\nWe have thus seen that Jan Bronk inherited the Bronk Patent from his father, Peter Bronk, and that Marte Gerritse Van Bergen bought the north part of Loonenburg Patent adjoining.\n\nThere was another tract of land called the Corlaers Kill Patent, which was owned jointly by Jan Bronk and Marte Gerritse. In 1687 the two united in petitioning for a patent from Governor Dongan, covering all of these three parcels of land. This patent is called the Coxsackie Patent. The tract mentioned in this document as being by land of Gisbert out the Bogard lies to the south of Athens.\n\nWhereas Peter Bronks did purchase a certain parcel of land near Albany on the west side of Hudsons river between Martin Gerritsens island and a certain hook called Notten hook, and by the Indians Kockhachingh which said land reacheth into the woods and hath a creek or kill thereunto belonging stretching on the other side of said kill over against Martin Gerrisens Island it goes west ward into the woods to Katskill path and running along the said path southward it comes to the Stonekill, from thence it returns eastward over against the said Notten hook and so northward along the river to the aforesaid kill which lies over against Gerritsens Island contain about 252 acres or 126 morgen and 120 rod, as by deed of date Jan. 13, 1662and whereas Gov. Richard Nicolls did June 11, 1667 ratify the sale of the above land to Peter Bronk---and whereas John Cloot, Jurrian Tunnisse and John Hendrick Debruyne by a patent of May 25, 1667 from Gov. Nicolls, became possessed of a tract of land lying on the west of Hudsons River over against the little Newtowne hook beginning from the land of Peter Bronks upon the Katskill path right south along sd Katskill path to the fountain and from the fountain eastwards to the hill of Stevensink eastwards to the river and from the river side, northwards land of Peter Bronk aforesaid---and whereas Myndert Fredrickse had transported unto him from the said John Hendrick D. Bruyn by deed of date Aug. 7, 1675 all his one-third part of the said land---and whereas the said John Cloot, Juraen Tunnisse and Myndert Fredrickse by deed of date 20 March 1681 made over to Martin Gerristen all that aforesaid parcel of land granted to John Cloot Jursen Tunnisse and John Hendric D. Bruyn by patent as aforesaid, and whereas there is a certain piece of ground beginning from the property of Gisbert out the Bogard northward from a hill called Piez to the flying corner in the Indian tongue called Machawanick stretching along the property of John Cloot, Jan Hendrick Bruyn and Juraen Tunnissen to the old Katskill Indian foot-path, which the said Martin Gerritsen had bought of the Indiansand whereas John the son of Peter Bronk and Martin Gerrit, have made application unto me for a comfirmation &c. now know ye that I the said Thomas Dongan &c. do comfirm unto John Bronks and Martin Gerritsen all the above recited tracts of land, to have and to hold &c., this May 23, 1687.\n\nSigned by\n\nThomas Dongan.\n\nIn the year 1670 Jurian Teunisse who owned one-third of the Loonenburg Patent, sold it to Abraham Staats and Johannes Provoost. As the Dutch language is fast fading out of memory, this document is given in full both from its great importance and to preserve a relic of the past.\n\nCompareerde voor my Ludovicus Cobes, Secret. van Albany, Colonie Rensselaersw ende Scaneghtede, ten overstaen van de E.

Morever, he claims as acknowledged for the satisfaction thereof that the first penny with the last is satisfied and paid by the hand of the aforesaid Abraham Staats and Johannes Provoost, given plenan actionem cessam their heirs and assigns, or whoever after them may obtain possession of said third part of land, with barn and appurtenances, and full power and right to do with the same and to dispose thereof as they might do with their patrimonial goods and effects would be able to do, promising to defend the said third part, with barn and appurtenances, against any and all persons, and to free it from every vexation, worry and charge as is right; and, further, that he will never do against this, or suffer it to be done, in court or out of it, in any manner, and will stand by this obligation as it may be lawful to do.\n\nJan Verbeck.\n\nJurian Teunisse,\n\nPhilip Pieterse Schuyler.\n\nKnown to me\n\nLudovicus Cobes, Secretary.\n\nIt is probable that the actual sale of the Fountain Flats was made some time previous to the time it was deeded which may account for the deed to Marte Gerritse, being dated subsequent to the above conveyance. After the sale of Fountain Flats Jan Hendrickse Bruyns share of the Loonenburg Patent came into the possession of Cornelis Machielis October 30th 1685. He sold it to Jacob Hallenbeck and Jochem Collier.\n\nThe first left his part to this oldest son, Jacob Casper, Hallenbeck. The second left his part to his oldest son, Teunis Dirck Van Vechten. The third transmitted his share to his sons Casper Jans Hallenbeck, and Jochem Collier let his part to his oldest son, Isaac Collier. A deed reciting the above facts is now in the possession of Jonas Collier. In this way the families of Provoost, Van Loon, Hallenbeck, Van Vechten and Collier first obtained land within the limits of the town of Coxsackie. Though the mention of the barn in the deed to Staats and Provoost in 1670 indicates an actual settlement, the first notice we have of a house is in a deed dated November 2d 1685, by which John Barker, as attorney for Cornelius Machielis, sold to Jacob Phenix the half of a farm called Klinkenberg with the barn and the house. The principal knowledge that we have concerning the early inhabitants is derived from ancient deeds and conveyances which have been preserved. From these we learn that the part of this town which was first occupied and improved, and upon which houses were built, was the portion of the Loonenburg Patent which lies in the southern part of Coxsackie. Among the earliest is a deed from Broer Jans to Jan Caspersen, which conveyed to him a piece of land situated near the Fountain Flats, to wit 17 morgen as the same was divided with the other partners and came to Broer Jans, being bounded with the utmost bounds of Martin Geritse. This same piece of land was sold January 18th 1711, by Jan Caspersen to Michael Collier and is spoken of as lying near the foot of the Hill called Stevesink. This is now the north part of the farm of Jonas Collier.\n\nOn the 6th of September 1694 Teunis Tappen, son of Jurian Teunisse, sold to Jacob Caspersen Hallenbeck:\n\nAll that tract of land over against Claverack called Klinkenburg, as the same was transported to him by the attorney of Cornelius Machealis on the 18th of June 1687, and by Teunisse Pieterse on the 8th of April 1689, stretching southward and westward as far as the Murderers Creek, and northward till over against the Little Nuttern Hook, together with all the right and title of said Jurian Teunisse in the house and barn, the whole of the new orchard and half of the old, namely, ¾ of all the land at the water side eastward of Loonenburg, except the place called Korst Veloren, belonging to the heirs of Maj. Abraham Staats.\n\nThe mention of the old orchard is a proof that the place had been occupied and improved for some years before. Klinkenberg, or Echo Hill, is the range of elevated land to the north of Four Mile Point. This tract of land, which extended along the river front as far north as the south bounds of the Fountain Flats, continued in possession of the descendants of Jacob Hallenbeck for several generations. The house stood near the present residence of George Houghtaling. The location of the new orchard is perpetuated by the fact that it was used as a burying place by the successive generations of the Hallenbeck family down to within the last fifty years. One of the first deaths recorded in the records of the Lutheran church of Athens, is that of the death of Anna Hallenbeck, who died February 25th 1711, aged 17 years and was buried at Klinkenberg in the new orchard. It is on the top of a small hill a short distance west of George Houghtalings house, and a few rude stones, without inscriptions, mark the last resting place of many generations.\n\nProbably one of the oldest homesteads in the town is the place near its southern border, now occupied by Warren Hallenbeck. This was originally the homestead of Jan Van Loon, grandson of the first settler of the name. He left it to his son Albertus, whose daughter married John C. Clow, from whose heirs it was purchased by John C. Hallenbeck, father of the present owner. A still older place is that of William Reed Adams, on the west side of the turnpike near Four Mile Point. This was the ancient dwelling place of Jan Van Loons father (Jan). The old store house, demolished many years ago, stood by the side of the road, at the southeast corner of the door-yard of Mr. Adams. On the east side of the turnpike, about ten rods from the road, is an old, neglected burying ground, where the early generation of this family rest.\n\nAnother of the ancient homesteads is the old Van Schaack place. This farm of 100 acres was given by Jan Van Loon, June 30th 1719, to his son-in-law Arent Van Schaack, who married his daughter Maria. Van Loon is his deed describes it as on the west side of his patent, by a small creek or spring of water that came out of a hill near his house. The annual rent to be paid for this land was one scheppel of wheat (about three pecks) and two fowls. This place continued in the family till the present generation. It is at the head waters of the Coxsackie Creek, under the high cliffs of the Kalkberg, and is owned by Francis Cochran.\n\nOn the Spoorenberg road from Coxsackie to Athens, and on the north side of Murderers Creek, and within sight of the West Shore Railroad, is an old stone house that has long been a landmark. This is the old Spoor place, and the dwelling place of that family from the earliest times. December 30th 1741, Jan, Albertus, Nicholas, and Matthias Van Loon sold to Johannes Spoor 45 acres of wood land in Loonenburg, now in his possession, and adjoining the land of Johannes Hallenbeck, Here he built his house and from him the locality took the name Spoorenberg. Johannes Spoor left the property to his son. It descended to his son, John D. Spoor, who died a comparatively young man. He was a very skillful surveyor, and his maps, of which many yet remain, are models of neatness. At his death the place descended to his son Derrick, who was the last of the family to inhabit the old homestead. It passed into the hands of strangers. But with a respect for the memory of his ancestors, which few of the descendents of the Dutch settlers seem to possess, he, although comparatively poor, had their graves enclosed with a substantial fence, and procured monuments to mark their graves. A respect for the sentiments so creditable to the man, prompts us to lend our aid to perpetuate their memories and his own by putting the inscriptions in a form more durable than marble.\n\nJohannes Spoor, died February 15th 1761, aged 60.\n\nEve, wife of Johannes Spoor, died September 7th 1786, aged 84.\n\nDerrick Spoor, died September 12th 1826, aged 85.\n\nJudith, wife of Derrick Spoor, died April 20th 1796, aged 58.\n\nSacred to the memory of John D. Spoor, Esq., son of Derrick and Judith Spoor, who died at Sacketts Harbor, December 13th 1812, aged 39.\n\nHe commanded a company of militia stationed at Sacketts Harbor, for the defense of that frontier.\n\nSophia, wife of John D. Spoor, died August 2d 1833, aged 57.\n\nDerrick Spoor, son of John D. and Sophia Spoor, died February 26th 1880. this stone is erected by his friends.\n\nAbraham D. Spoor, M. D., born March 14th 1791, died December 28th 1873.\n\nThere are several inscriptions on the stone walls of the old house, but from none of these can we determine when it was built. The highway that runs past, is very frequently mentioned in old deeds, as the road from Derrick Spoors to Athens. \n\nOld Settlers and their Homes\n\nMarte Gerritse Van Bergen and Jan Bronk seem to have held the land described in the Coxsackie Patent, including the land granted to Peter Bronk and the Fountain Flats, in equal proportion. In 1695 Jan Bronk conveyed to Marte Gerritse:\n\nA certain parcel of land, on the west side of Hudson River, right over against Little Nutten Hook commonly called Fountains Flats, lying to the north of the parcel of land which Marte Gerritse hast conveyed to the said Jan Bronk, which land runs north from the said land of Jan Bronk to Coxsackie Creek, being in breadth from the creek to the spruyt, with all his right, but that the said Jan Bronk shall have the privilege of hewing timber and wood for building fencing and burning, The said Marte Gerritse to have the privilege of sawing as such timber as he may fit at his saw-mill.\n\nThe word spruyt, which will be noticed in the above description, frequently occurs in old Dutch deeds, and denotes a low piece of land. The piece of land alluded to probably lies to the southeast of the Kings road not farm from the farm now owned by John Fiero.\n\nA deed from Martin and Gerrit to their brother Petrus, dated January 8th 1725, recites that a patent had been granted by Gov. Dongan to Jar Bronk and Marte Gerritse in 1687, for a certain tract to land at Coxsackie, and another piece of land therein named and that since the decease of Marte Gerritse a division had been made between Jan Bronk and the Van Bergens, and they had conveyed to each other a just half of the lands remaining undivided, except the land of Phillip Conyn and the land of Jan Caspersen.\n\nThe two brothers conveyed to Petrus Van Bergen all their right in the Coxsackie Patent, and by a deed of the same date, Petrus conveyed to his brothers all his right in the land at Catskill and Corlaers Kill.\n\nAt what time Petrus Van Bergen came to live on his land at Coxsackie, we have no certain knowledge. His father certainly never lived here. Jan Bronk lived and died in what is now the village of Leeds. The first intimation we have of any person actually settling on this tract of land is found in a deed by which Gerrit Van Bergen sold to Jan Caspersen Hallenbeck.:\n\nA certain parcel of land at a place or flats called Kaniskeek, nigh the bounds of Jan Bronks there, on the west side of a certain place called the Modder Kill, Beginning at the bounds of the land of Jan Bronk there, and stretching south along the said Kill, and by sundry lines, till it makes near upon a square 30 morgen of land as the same is now in fence, and it the possession of the said Jan Caspersen. And also one other piece of land situate lying and being on the east side of Coxsackie creek, where the house and barn of the said Jan Caspersen is, and not in the tenure of Jan Van Hoesen, containing 2 morgen. Which two pieces were sold to the said Jan Caspersen by Martin Gerritse father of the said Gerrit by deed April 14, 1683.\n\nThe consideration of this deed was an annual rent of ¾ bushels of good winter wheat. The date of this deed is May 24th 1717. The document is now in the possession of Edwin C. Hallenbeck. The land above described is the homestead which long remained in the possession of the Hallenbecks, and is now owned by John Fiero.\n\nThe next notice that we have of an actual settler, is a deed from Jan Bronk, of Catskill, to Philip Leenderse Conyn. This deed recites, that the Coxsackie Patent was granted by Governor Dongan, that Marte Gerritse was deceased, and that the estate devolved upon Jan Bronk as survivor, and that Philip Leenderse Conyn had been for several years, by virtue of grants made by Jan Bronk and Marte Gerristse, in peaceable possession of a certain farm:\n\nBounded on the north so as the same is in fence, on the west by the common highway, on the east by a valley or spruyt, and so far to the north till it completes and takes in 25 morgen, or 50 acres. Together with a piece of pasture land and Hoffestead with the house, so as the same now lies enclosed between the fence and Coxsackie creek or kill, containing 2 morgen more or less.\n\nJan Bronk by this deed, dated March 8th 1710, confirmed the same to him for an annual rent of 1 scheppel of wheat, or three pecks of winter wheat. * (*this farm now lies on the south side of the street in the upper village, and on the east of the Kings road. The homestead was on the opposite corner west, where the large double house of Peter Van Bergen now stands.) In 1731 Jan Bronk and Petrus Van Bergen sold to Philip L. Conyn, a piece of land, beginning at the southeast corner by a run of water which was the northeast bounds of land of Hendrick and Robert Vandenberg, (sons of Richard) at a rocky place in the run of water, and going from thence over the ridge of the first hill, that lay to the north of the bridge by Phillip Conyns, and so along to a swamp that run to Coxsackie Creek. We find that Jan Bronk sold or confirmed to Thomas Williams, who probably married his daughter, Hillietje:\n\nA piece of land beginning at a small slink or spruyt which comes into Coxsackie creek a little be south of the bridge behind the dwelling house of Phillip Conyn, and up along the spruyt as far as it runs, and thence west to the old Catskill path, and from thence south ward to the orchard of Petrus Van Bergen, now in possession of Richard Vandenberg, and so along on the north and east side of the fence of the orchard, to the middle fence between this tract and the land of Petrus Van Bergen, and thence easterly along the fence of Coxsackie Creek, and thence along the creek to the place where it begins except so much as has been heretofore conveyed to Conradt Houghtaling.\n\nThis is dated April 18th 1729, and the land was sold the next day by Thomas Williams to Richard Vandenberg. This land lies on the south side of the turnpike, west of the bridge, over Coxsackie Creek. The spruyt or slink is the low marshy piece of ground about 40 rods south of the road, extending west from the creek.\n\nThe exact time when the Vandenberg family came to Coxsackie is unknown. Tradition states that they were acquaintances or relatives of the Van Bergens, and at their invitation came here and settled. They were evidently here in 1729. Land was leased to Richard Vandenberg by Petrus Van Bergen. This tract is thus described in the deed as:\n\nLying on the west side of Koxhagkie kill, and beginning by a certain kill or creed, called Moodenaers kill, where it comes into Koxhagkie path. From thence northerly along the path till it takes in the Orchard now in possession of said Richard Van Den Brock, thence south by the land of Thomas Williams, and thence southeast ward along the fence to Koxhagkie kill, and along the same to the place of beginning, as it is now in possession of said Richard Vandenberg.\n\nThe annual rent was to be five scheppels of good merchantable winter wheat, to be paid on the 25th day of March. This rent continued to be paid till about 1820, when a satisfactory arrangement was made between the heirs of Van Bergen and Vandenberg, by which it was extinguished.\n\nThe original lease and the deeds to Phillip Conyn, and Thomas Williams are not in the possession of Walter Vanderberg of Amsterdam, New York.\n\nSeptember 14th 1737, a sale was made by Jan Bronk to Nicholas Egmont, which is described as:\n\nSituated on the Northwest side of Coxsackie kill, beginning at a black oak tree standing near the Kings road by a bridge on the spruyt of Saaren Crepel bosch. From thence along the road as the same runs northward to the foot of the hill near by the Diep kill, thence eastwards along the foot of the kill as it runs to the Koxhacksie kill, thence southerly along the same as far as the land of the said Egmont to the south of the spruyt of Saaren Crepel bosch, and along the land of said Egmont on the south side of the spruyt to the place where it begun.\n\nThis tract lies on the west side of Coxsackie Creek, some distance north of the turnpike which crosses the bridge over the creek in the upper village. The phrase Saaren Crepel bosch is translated in some deeds Sarahs Swamp, at that time the low land at that place was undoubtedly a marshy thicket. The Diep Kill is the first brook that crosses the Kings road north of the bridge over Coxsackie Creek. This tract was given by Nicholas Egmont in his will to his step grandson, Anthony Winne, 1772, and he sold it December 14th 1772 to Hendrick and Robert Vandenberg. The tract south of this which was sold by Bronk and Van Begen to Phillip Conyn in 1731, was left by him to his sons, Phillip and Johannes, in 1732. The latter sold his part to Hendrick and Robert Vandenburg October 10th 1754, and by these various purchases the Vandenberg family become the owners of the large tract of land to the west of the upper village. The old Conyn homestead is now owned by Peter Van Bergen. A tavern was kept there before the Revolution. On the south or east bank of Coxsackie Creek about half a mile above the bride in the upper village stands an old stone house, now in the possession of John Whitbeck. This was the old homestead of Peter Bronk, the oldest son of Jan Bronk, the first owner of the land, and his fathers will makes what would now be considered a strange discrimination in his favor because of his right of primogeniture, as will be seen in the following extract:\n\nImprimis I give to my eldest son, Rector Bronk, four morgen or eight acres of land near the deep kill at Coxsackie, in right of primogeniture, and to debar him of making any further pretence of Eldership or BIRTH RIGHT . Item I give to my five sons namely Peter Bronck, Leonard Bronck, Jonas Bronck, Phillip Bronck, & Casparus Bronck, the remainder of all my share in and to the undivided lands within the limits and Boundaries of the Patent of Koxsackie, formerly granted to me and Martin Gerritsen. That is to say to each son one equal fifth part, with the exception Namely Peter, Leonard, Jonas and Phillip Bronck, or either of them or their heirs or assigns shall not by any way whatever, cut down, destroy nor carry away any such tree or trees, that shall be standing or lying on any part of the undivided lands, that shall be suitable for saw logs, I having reserved, and do reserve them for the improvement of saw-mill of Koxsackie, So that it is my will, and I do order that Peter, Leonard, Phillip, & Jonas Bronck, or either of them or their heirs or assigns hall not molest nor hinder Casparus Bronck form cutting down or carrying away any such trees suitable for saw logs, for the improvement of saw-mill at Coxsackie, standing or lying on any part of the heretofore mentioned lands after Division be made between the said Peter, Leonard, Jonas, Phillip and Casparus Bronck.\n\nLastly I do appoint my son Casparus Bronck to be the sole executor of this my last will and testament. * * In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal in Catskill at the dwelling house of the testator, the day and year first above mentioned.\n\nJan Bronck\n\nIn presence of us,\n\nSilvester Salisbury,\n\nWilliam Salisbury,\n\nJacob Frese.\n\nThe above will was proved October 6th 1743.\n\nIn 1784 the place was the home of John T. Bronk, the son or grandson of Peter, and the old house now standing is a typical Dutch homestead.\n\nAbout thirty rods east of the Kalkberg range of hills, on the banks of Murderers Kill, is the old homestead of the Vandenbergs. The present stone house was built about 1764, by John R. Vandenberg, but the original house built by his grandfather, Richard, before 1725, stood a few rods east. The Catskill Path crossed Murderers Kill by the ridge of high ground west of the house, and the west line of the garden fence, north east of the house is exactly on the line of the path trodden by the wilden (as the Dutch termed the Indians), many years ago. The place is now owned by John M. Truesdell. In the list of ancient homesteads we must not fail to notice that the Collier family, under the Kalkberg, and next south of the Fountain Flats. The name of Michael Collier occurs as early as 1705, and a deed from Jan Caspersen Hallenbeck, dated January 18th 1711, conveys to him:\n\nA piece of land near Coxsackie at or near the Fountain Flats, 34 acres, being the same that fell to the share of Broer Jans, being bounded with the land of the heirs of Martin Gerritse, to wit, their utmost bounds, near the foot of the hill called Stevesink.\n\nThis land is now a part of the farm of Peter Collier, and has descended to him form his ancestors. At its northwest corner is the spring from which the Fountain Flats derive their name. On the old maps of Coxsackie patent, the Catskill Path is marked as diverging from its general course to reach the spring under the rocks, which must have been a source of much needed refreshment to travelers on their long journey.\n\nIt only remains to locate the homes of Petrus Van Bergen, the ancestor of all the Van Bergens in Coxsackie. This was on or near the site of the stone house now owned by William Farmer, on the north side of the street in the upper village, and next west of the stream pump of the West Shore Railroad. The following is probably a list of all the heads of families within the limits of Coxsackie, prior to 1725:\n\nPeter Bronk, Phillip, Bronk, Leonard, Bronk, Casparus Bronk, Phillip Conyn, Michael Collier, Jan Van Hoesen, Jan Van Loon jr., Jacob Hallenbeck, Jan Casperse Hallenbeck, Petrus Van Bergen, Thomas Williams, Nicholas Egmont, Anthony Winne, Aaron Van Schaack, Caspar Jans Hallenbeck, Hans Jurgen Clow, and Jonas Bronk.\n\nCoeymans Patent\n\nIn 1673 General Lovelace granted to Barent Pietersen\n\nA tract of land on the west side of Hudsons river to the north of a place by the Indians called Koxhaexy, stretching in length to the highest place where Jacob Flodder did use to roll down his timber, named by the Indians, Siekatoms, to the south of the Island belonging to Jan Reyersen, and into the woods as far as the said Indiana Sachems right goes, as also the wood land, kills, creeds, valleys and meadows, thereunto appertaining without any reservation as purchased by said Barent of the principal Sachems at the Katskill.\n\nThis grant is generally known as Coeymans Old Patent. In 1685 a patent was granted to Killian Van Rensselaer which conveyed to him.\n\nAll that tract of land called Rensselaerswyck lying upon the banks of Hudsons river in the County of Albany, heretofore known by the name of the Colony of Rensselaerswyck. Beginning at the south end or part of Beeren Island in Hudsons River extending northwards up along both sides of said river, unto a place heretofore called the Kahoos or the Great Falls of the said river, and extending itself east and west all along from each die to the said river backwards into the woods 24 English miles.\n\nIn 1714 Andries Coeymans, son and heir of Brent Pietersen, made application for a new patent of confirmation for the tract of land granted to his father by Governor Lovelace, and in compliance with this application a new patent was granted him August 16th 1714, which conveyed to him as follows:\n\nThe Lands in & near the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, of which his Father died seized & bounded as follows. Beginning at a creek called Peter Broncks creek or the creek of Coxsackie including the same creek, on the west side of Hudsons River thence up along the said River as it runs to over against the middle of Jan Ryersens Island to a small run of water, thence from the said River backwards up into the woods W & by N. half a point more northerly 12 English miles being the northern bounds of said land; & the southern bounds beginning at the north of the said Peter Broncks creek & thence up the same, including the same as aforesaid, until it comes to Coxsackie, and thence up into the woods by a due west course until it is 12 English miles distant from the mouth of said creek, from the west end of which distance last mentioned a straight line being drawn northerly until it meets and closes with the west end of the aforesaid northerly bounds makes the western bounds thereof, and the easterly bounds thereof in the said River, according to a grant made by Gov. Lovelace April 7, 1673, to said Barent Petersen, and an adjustment of boundaries made by deed dated Oct. 22,1706, between Killam Van Rensselaer, and the said Barent Pietersen and Andries.\n\nBeeren Island is the small rocky island below Coeymans Landing, and as the north bounds of the tract granted to Barent Pietersen were far beyond this, it will be seen that Van Rensselaers patent encroached upon it and made a tract of disputed lands. The contest which then arose between the parties claiming the land in dispute was settled by Killiam Van Rensselaers giving to Andries Coeymans a deed releasing to him all his right and title to the whole trace. This deed is referred to in the patent granted to Coeymans in 1714, and is recorded in book H of deeds, page 209, in the county clerks office at Albany.\n\nIn those early days large grants of land were frequently made, with boundaries that encroached upon prior patents or grants. In such cases the earliest grant was generally sustained, and, as land was of little value, one of the parties generally bought the claims of the others. The patent granted to Peter Bronk was of earlier date than any other in the part of the country. The north boundary, being a line running west from the south side of the mouth of Coxsackie Creek to the Indian foot-path, was established by arbitration, as stated in a description of the 12th allotment of Coeymans Patent, contained in the field book of the survey and division, in the county clerks office in Albany. The place which the Indians called Coxsackie was undoubtedly at the upper village, and a line running west from the bridge over the creek was always considered the south boundary of Coeymans Patent. That the land between the bridge and the Catskill Path was a part of the Bronk Patent was never disputed.\n\nDivision of The Fountain Flats\n\nThe tract of which was sold to Marte Gerritse Van Bergen at the northern end of the Loonenberg Patent, was held by him and Jan Bronk jointly, and although included in the Coxsackie Patent, was always considered a tract by itself. From time to time undivided shares were sold, and in 1783, the owners of the tract resolved to divide it among themselves. The facts connected with the division are stated in the partition deed, of which following is an extract:\n\nThis Indenture made the 9th day of January 1783, Between Isaac Provoost, Henry Provoost, Abraham Porvoost, Luke Kiersted, Goes Van Schaick, Myndert Van Schaick, Merte Hallenbeck and Leonard Bronk of the county of Albany, of the first part, And John L. Bronk, Phillip Bronk, Charlotte Bronk, Peter Bronk, Richard Bronk, John B. Bronk, Phillip P. Bronk, John Whitbeck, Anthony Van Bergen, Henry Van Bergen, Peter Van Bergen, Hermanus Cuyler, and Elisabeth, his wife, of the Second part. Whereas the parties of the first part are the owners of an undivided one-third part of a certain tract of ground commonly called the Fountain Flats, which is part of the Patent called Loonenburg, Beginning at the head of the spring near the hill in the land now occupied by Isaac Collier, and runs form thence easterly along the lots, into which part of the Patent has been divided, to the Hill Stevesink, and from thence east to Hudson river, and thence up along the river to the bounds of the Patent granted to Peter Bronk, thence westerly along the bounds of the Patent to the Stony Kill, and thence southward along the ancient Indian foot-path to the place of beginning. And whereas the parties of the second part are the owners of he remaining undivided two-thirds of the tract of land. And both parties having by articles of agreement appointed Robert Yates Esq. to survey and divide the same. And the said Robert Yates having established a partition line, which line begins at the foot of the hill, on the old Katskill Indian foot-path, by a Black oak tree, marked with the letters R. Y., and runs from thence, as the needle pointed in December 1781 S. 71 degrees, 20 minutes East 50 chains and 80 links, and then N. 89 degrees, 20 minutes East, 213 chains, to the banks of Hudsons River, thereby dividing the tract into two parts, the south part containing one-third, with the additions of 10 acres for the use of Marten Hallenback, and his heirs, and the north part containing two-thirds (excepting 10 acres). Now this Indenture witnesseth, that the parties of the first part release and convey to the parties of the second part all the land to the north of the line, excepting and reserving to Marten Hallenbeck, the right and title he has to the old farm whereon he now lives, and such title as he has under the Van Bergens for cutting wood on the land for fuel and fencing.\n\nAnd the parties of the second part also release all their clam to the land south of the line. \n\nThe original deed is now in possession of Robert Henry Van Bergen, of Coxsackie.\n\nThe south line of this tract has already been described.\n\nThe north lien of the Ely farm, now owned by Mrs. Lewis Lampman, and the highway that runs west by the evaporating establishment, are on the dividing line marked by Yates. The west end of the line is at a high ledge of rocks, at the corner between the farm of Robert Armstrong and the Van Allen farm. In 1788, the third south of the line was divided among its owners, by Leonard Bronk. It was divided into eleven lots. Lot No. 1 was the west end of the tract, from the Catskill Path to Coxsackie Creek. It contained 45 ½ acres, and belonged to John L. Bronk, who sold it to Phillip Collier, and it is now the property of his descendants, Phillip and Edward Van Allen. The piece of wood land belonging to Derrick Lampman, which is so conspicuous a feature in the landscape, is the west half of Lot. No. 9; and the north part of the Ely farm next to the river, is Lot No. 11.\n\nDivision of Coxsackie Patent\n\nAs has already been mentioned, several large tracts of land were sold to various persons in the early days. Only two others remain to be noticed. In 1730, Jan Bronk conveyed to his son, Leonard of Coxsackie, a piece of land next and opposite to the homestead of said Leonard, and also a piece called the ronde vlackie or round Flat. This fixes approximately the time of the building of the older part of the Bronk residence. The round flat is near the creek to the north.\n\nA tract of 160 acres, bounded west by the Catskill Path and north and east by Murderers Creek and Coxsackie Creek, was sold by Peter Van Bergen to Silas Rushmore October 21st 1789. Rushmore sold 12 acres of this tract at the junction of the two creeks to Martin Hallenbeck January 15th 1785. The remainder or the south portion of it, next to the Catskill Path, was sold to John L. Bronk the same year. It is now owned by Mrs. Lewis Lampman, and still bears the name of the Rushmore Lot. The part next to Murderers Kill was sold to Hendrick Vandenberg. That portion of the patent which remained undivided in 1784, and which was almost three-fourths of it, was in that year divided into 64 lots which were apportioned equally between the families of Bronk and Van Bergen. The work was done by James Van Rensselaer and G. Lansing. Duplicate maps were made which are fortunately still in existence. One of these is now in possession of Robert H. Van Bergen, the other of John B. Whitbeck. A map of the Fountain Flats, made by Leonard Bronk, was found among his papers, and a copy of it has been placed in the county clerks office.\n\nIt may be of interest to show the locations of some of the original lots, the whole of the active business part of Coxsackie Landing is on Lot No. 48, which belonged to the Bronks. The Upper Landing, the port of the town in years gone by, is on Lot No. 50, and the old Wells house stands on the northeast corner of it. The Lower Landing comprises Lots No.46 and No. 47. At the northwest corner of the patent were five large lots each containing 103 acres. Lot No. 18, which was bounded on the north by the patent line, is now the south part of the farm of Peter Henry Whitbeck. The road which runs east from the Kings road, opposite the house of Luman Miller in the town of New Baltimore, is on the dividing line between Lots 14 and 15. The New Baltimore line runs through Lots 14 and 19. Lot No. 45 is at the southeast corner of the map and is the land on the north of the Ely farm. It should be remarked that the map does not include the south third of the Fountain Flats, but extends only to the partition line fixed by Robert Yates in 1787. At the junction of Kings road and the road to Greenville, near the New Baltimore line, on the northwest corner, opposite the present residence of Henry Wolfe, stood during the Revolution, and for years after, the noted tavern kept by Peter Bronk, a grandson of the first settler. This house, which was on the north line of Lot No. 14, and a few rods east of the Catskill Path, in days of yore was a great resort for travelers on the road to Albany. A few remnants of brick and stone, in the corner of the orchard of Luman Miller, are all that is left of it now.\n\nOld Town of Coxsackie\n\nMarch 24th 1772, the northern par of what is now Greene county was formed into a district called the District of Coxsackie, and it was erected into a town March 7th 1788. Of the public records made during the time it was a district, scarcely a vestige remains, except the laying out of a few roads. The only document which is of a public nature, that has been found, is the assessment roll of the year 1787, and the importance of this, as being the only list of taxable inhabitants of this part of the county at that date, fully justifies us in giving it entire. It includes what are now the towns of Durham, Greenville, Coxsackie, New Baltimore, Athens and Cairo.\n\nA Tax List of the District of Coxsackie, agreeable to a warrant assigned to us the subscribers' assessors of said District, dated the 12th day of June 1787 by the Board of Supervisors for the County of Albany, at 2 1/2 d. on a pound:\n\nFIRST NAME LAST NAME TAX(£) GARRIT ABEEL\n\n15\n\nDR.

Thus in 1704 we find Jan Bronk and Jan Van Loon entering a petition that their quit rent might be remitted in consideration of their Services during the war.\n\nAt the time of the Revolution few portions of the county furnished a larger number of men in proportion to their population.\n\nAs early as April 28th 1740, John L. Bronk was commissioned captain of a company in a regiment, whereof Sybrant Van Schaick is colonel, as the old commission reads and October 20th 1775, he was commissioned 2d major of the 11th regiment, of which Anthony Van Bergen was colonel.\n\nTime had fortunately preserved the original commission granted to John L. Bronk by the Provincial Congress of New York, and as such documents are rare, a copy is appended as a relic of Revolutionary times.\n\nIn Provincial congress for the Colony of New York the Twentieth Day of Oct. 1775.\n\nTo John L.

Van Schaick.\n\nDuring the war both sides had sympathizers. While the Hallenbecks on the flats and in what is now Athens, were noted patriots, the Hallenbecks and Provoosts at Klinkenberg were equally noted tories. And the old stone house of Jacob Hallenbeck, by the side of the river, was a great resort to which the friends of the royal government were much more welcome than the agents of the Continental Congress. But their number was too small, and this influence too limited, to effect much in the great struggle, and although a few met their just deserts by the confiscation of their property, it is better that their names should not be brought forth from oblivion.\n\nA list of 9 months men of John Vanderberg, 1776:\n\nJohn Vandenberg, Robert Vandenberg, Richard Vanderberg, William Vandenberg, Peter Bronk, Peter Van Slyck, Albert Vanderzee, Peter Shaddon, Jeremiah Conine, Philip P.

This patent is recorded in book 7 of patents, page 127, in the office of the secretary of State of Albany. The description and extent of the land as found in the patent is as follows:\n\nA certain tract of land in our County of Albany, situated and being behind a place called Kockshacky, beginning over the path of Catskill, form the south side of the Diep kill or creek, on the north side of and along the path to the Stony kill to the back side of a lake, pool or pond of water, and from the said lake, pool or pone of water to the diep kill due north or northwest from the said lake, and along the Diep kill to the said Catskill path.\n\nThe Diep Kill crosses the Catskill Path almost exactly at the line between the towns of Coxsackie and New Baltimore. It was the custom of those times for the owners of a patent to claim all the land that could by any possible construction of its boundaries, be included in its limits. The northwest corner of the patent was held to be at the head waters of the Diep Kill on the farm now owned by Hiram Miller. The boundaries at the lake, pool or pond of water now called Bronks Lake, were somewhat indefinite, and occasioned a dispute with the owners of the Roseboom Patent on the south as to which party owned the lake. The extensive land purchases made by Leonard Bronk in after years included all the land around this lake, and a deed to him from Thomas Houghtaling seems to include the greater part of it. A map of the small tract of land in dispute between the two patents, near the lake, made by John D. Spoor, in 1807, is in the county clerks office in Catskill. The corner between this patent and the Roseboom Patent, west of the lake was originally a large tree, now replaced by a large black stone on the borders of the land of Rev. Lewis Lampman.\n\nThe west line of the patent which ran from the head of the Diep Kill to Bronks Lake, crossed the road from Coxsackie to Jacksonville, a short distance west of the old toll gate on the plank road, and is the dividing line between the homestead of William Thorn, and what is known as the Brownwell farm, no owned by the heirs of Amos Brownwell.\n\nMatthias Houghtaling, the patentee, died, leaving among other children, two sons, Conrad and Hendrick, and a daughter, Catrina, who married Richard Vandenberg. Conrad, the eldest son, conveyed to his brother Hendrick a small tract at the northeast corner, extending along the Catskill Path 710 yards. This was afterward the homestead of his son Thomas, and is now owned by Truman Mackey, of New Baltimore. The old burying ground to the east of the homestead on the land of Henry Wolfe contains a line, the graves of four generations of the Houghtalings. Thomas Houghtaling died February 1st 1824, aged 93 years 3 months. His wife Elizabeth, daughter of Andries Whitbeck, died July 29,th 1820, aged 82. Henry Houghtaling died October 15th July 1820, aged 70. John Staats Houghtaling died September 26th 1840, aged 52 years 9 months and 6 days. Henry J. Houghtaling died September 7th 1847, aged 30.\n\nThe old homestead of Thomas Houghtaling stood a few feet east of the house now owned by Truman Mackey.\n\nA deed from Hendrick Houghtaling to Hendrick and Robert Vandenberg, dated October 20th 1770, recites the fact that the land known as the Houghtaling Patent (excepting so much of it as had been conveyed by Conrad Houghtaling to his brother Hendrick and to Caspar Collier) was then owned by Hendrick Houghtaling, and Hendrick and Robert Vanderberg, and that Hendrick Houghtaling, for the sum of 10 shillings and other consideration, did convey to Hendrick and Robert Vanderberg,\n\nAll the southernmost just half of the whole tract * * * containing 1743 acres, exclusive of 10 acres lying by the three falls of water on Murderers Kill, and four acres lying by the Stony Kill * * * also another small piece of land lying near the small lake * * * donating 27 acres * * * also another small piece of land released to the said Hendrick Houghtaling * * *about 5 acres, Reserving one-half of the stream called Murderers Kill with 2 ½ acres of land by the first fall, and 4 acres by other falls * * *also 8 acres on the north side of Stony Kill * * *and one-half of all mines which may be hereafter found on the above lands.\n\nThe reservation of the mines on the tract of land, calls to mind an old tradition, that in the early days of the settlement at Coxsackie, the Indians were said to have gone out early in the morning to the hills somewhere in this region, and brought back quantities of lead before breakfast time. There have not been wanting rumors of silver mines in this same region, nor minds credulous enough to act upon these rumors and make repeated efforts to discover them, it is needless to say without success.\n\nThere is a tradition concerning a search for lead mines in this tract, that in the days of patentee, an Indian chief offered to sell him the secret to the place where this metal was found. Upon being refused the price demanded he declared, in a rage, that the mine should never be found while the land remained in the hands of any who bore the name of Houghtaling. This story of the Indians prophecy has often been given as an explanation of the failure of all attempts to discover the place whence the natives drew their supply. In recent times certain half crazed spiritualists have vainly endeavored to obtain from the sprits of the dead warriors, the secret they kept so well while living.\n\nThe tract of land thus set off the Vandenbergs is popularly known as the Vandenberg Patent, though it was not an original grant. At a subsequent period it was divided into lots, and by deed of December 21st 1745, Hendrick Vandenberg conveyed to Richard, Willhelmus, and John Vandenberg, 17 of the lots, each supposed to contain 50 acres, and of one of them the story is told, that by some reason it contained 60 acres. This fact becoming known to one of the Vandenbergs, he went to Leonard Bronk, its owner, and bought it as a 50 acre lot. The temptation to communicate the success of his shrewdness to the world, was too strong to be resisted, and Judge Bronk, who had strong objections to being overreached in this manner, promptly commenced a suit, which, after going to the Court of Chancery, resulted in his favor. Since that time it has gone by the name of Chancery Lot. The farm of William Steele is located on it. The turnpike leading to Jacksonville runs through the Lot No. 12. The place of beginning of this tract on the Catskill Path is a short distance north of the turnpike, near the house of Mr. Chase, and the line which separates it from the north half of the patent is now the north boundary of the farm of Robert Henry Van Bergen. The falls in Murderers Creek are where Van Bergens mill stands, on the road to Jacksonville. The north part or half of this patent was divided into lots, and some portion of it is now in the hands of the descendants of the patentee.\n\nRoseboom Patent\n\nApril 12th 1751 a patent was granted to Jacob Roseboom, John Jacob Roseboom and John G. Roseboom, for a tract of land which is thus described:\n\nAll the certain tract of land situated in the County of Albany, on the west side of Hudsons river, adjoining to the Patent of the Great Flats. Beginning at two small maple trees growing from one Root, and marked with three notches on four sides and X on the west side, standing on the Catskill Indian foot path, and on the west bounds of the Patent Loonenburg, and on the east side of a ridge or Rocky hill, and north side of a cave in the side of the hill, to the north of Joachem Jansens house. And this tract runs from the said place of beginning, North 65 degrees West 100 chains. Then North 29 degrees West 130 chains to a brook or creed called Potick Creek, thence up the stream to the corner of a tract granted to Abraham and William Salisbury and Casparus Bronk. Then along their line North 10 degrees West, 22 chains, to the South corner of a tract granted to Casparus Bronk. Then along his lines, North 40 degrees East, 160 chains, and then North 50 degrees West, 55 chains and then South 81 degrees East, 115 chains to a tract of land granted South Matthias Houghtaling. Then along his bounds and the bounds of a small tract of land granted to Casparus Bronk, to the said Old Catskill foot path on the bounds of the Patent of Loonenburg. Then along the same to the place where this tract first begun. Containing 4,530 acres with the usual allowance for Highways.\n\nThe annual quit rent to be paid for this tract was 2s. 6d. for each 100 acres.\n\nThe southern part of this patent is in the town of Athens and encroaches on the Catskill Patent. The south line is the same as the north line of Expense Lot No. 1 as marked on the map of Athens, the location of which is fully described in the history of that town. The whole of the 6th division of the Catskill Patent, although included in the bounds of the Roseboom Patent, was held by its former owners.\n\nThe north boundary of this tract was Bleeckers line or one of the lines run as the south boundary of Coeymans Patent. Its true north boundary was the Confirmation Line.\n\nJohn G. Roseboom obtained his share of the patent in behalf of John Henry Lydius, a prominent citizen of Albany, and transferred it to him by a deed, July 5th 1751. Jacob Roseboom, John Roseboom, and John Henry Lydius, sold one-eighth of the patent to Frederick Wormer, July 6th, and it was sold by him to John L. Bronk, September 17th of the same year, for the sum of £50.\n\nWhen the patent was obtained, it was agreed that Cadwalader Colden should have one-fourth of it, and that share was conveyed to him by Jacob Roseboom, May 3d 1753. Cadwalader Colden sold his share to Nicholas Paree and Dirck Van Vechten, August 15th 1759, for £250. The original deeds for these transfers are now in the possession of Mrs. Lewis Lampman, of Coxsackie.\n\nDirck Van Vechten sold his part to Isaac Collier and Gerrit Roosa, August 14th 1760.\n\nThe deed is now in the hands of Mr. Jonas Collier. Nicholas Paree transferred one-eighth to his sons Isaac and Daniel, March 10th 1761, and Isaac sold his part to Derrick Spoor, January 1st 1770. January 10th 1771, and agreement was made to divide the patent. At that time the owners were Martin Lydius, John L. Bronk, Derrick Spoor, Jacob Roseboom, William Hallenbeck, Arent Van Schaick, and Laurence Van Buskirk. Robert Yates, a lawyer of Albany, was employed to divide the tract into lots. It was also agreed that he should made four tickets, writing on each ticket the number of lot or lots intended to make one full fourth part of the whole patent, and four other tickets, writing on each the names of the proprietors of a fourth share. These tickets were to be put in separate boxes, and drawn out alternately by a disinterested person. After the drawing, mutual deeds of release were to be executed. The original articles of agreement are now in the hands of Robert Henry Van Bergen, with a copy of the map. The patent was divided into 12 lots, the three last being the disputed lands in the Catskill Patent. A line drawn south from the west side of Bronks Lake divided the rear of the tract into two portions. Lots 1, 2, 3, and 4, lay to the east, and Lots 5, 6, 7, and 8, to the west of the line. Lot No. 1 was on the south side of the Stony Kill and Bronks Lake, and Lot No. 8 was on the west of it. In the division, Lots 1 and 8 fell to Dirck Van Vechten and others, Nos. 3 and 6 to Hallenbecks, and Nos. 4 and 5 to Martin Lydius, who, with his wife Genevieve, sold to Dirck Van Vechten these lots, reserving the mill and stream of water where his mill stands, January 23d 1772. The mill was on the stream which flows out of the steep rocks of the Kalkberg, and which is the head waters of Coxsackie Creek, near of the house of Francis Cochran.\n\nThis patent, from the fact of its being granted at a later date than any of the patents around it, is frequently called in old deed, The new Patent. The whole is extremely rocky and hilly, the north end of the High Hill being within its limits, and upon the whole tract there are very few inhabitants, in proportion to its extent.\n\nStighkoke Patent\n\nThe bounds and extent of this patent are fully set forth in the following Indian deed to Casparus Bronk:\n\nKnow all men by these presents that we Herman Backer, Tanighsanow, Konghan, Aquahannit, and Tansaghoes, native proprietors of the tract of land hereinafter described, have for and in consideration of goods to the value of 13 pounds 10 shillings, to us in hand paid by Casparus Bronk. Have bargained and sold, and by these presents of bargain and sell unto his Majesty George the Second of great Britain France and Ireland Kind &c., and to his heirs and successors. All that tract of land called by the name of Stighkoke, situated and being on the west side of Hudson river, and in the County of Albany, and Province of New York. And also another smaller tract lying between said Stighkoke and Hudson river. The first tract begins at two small white teper wood trees, and a black oak, marked on four sides with three notches an a blaze, standing on the west side of a very small run or stream of water, where the same takes a short turn around the said trees. And the said tract runs form the place of the beginning along the line of trees blazed on two sides, South 40 degrees west, two English miles or 160 chains, to a spruce trees, marked with three notches on four sides, and C. C. on the west side thereof, standing on the east side of a small knoll. Thence North 50 degrees West, two miles. Thence North 40 degrees East, two miles. Thence South 40 degrees East, two miles, to the place of beginning, containing 2560 acres of land, The other of the said two tracts begins at a white teper wood trees, marked on four sides with three notches and a blaze standing on the north side of a run of water called the Stony Kill, and on the West side of the old Catskill path where it crosses the said kill, and runs from the said place of beginning along the said path southwards to a black oak tree marked with three notches and a blaze on four sides, standing under the east side of a high ledge of rocks. From thence North 38 degrees West, 82 chains to a dry tree marked on four sides standing on the north side of said stony kill, between a small walnut and tow iron wood saplings. Thence down along the north side of the kill as it runs to the place of beginning, containing 100 acres of land. * * to his Majesty and his heirs, for the uses and purposes mentioned in a license granted his Majestys Lieut.-Governor of the Province, to the said Casparus Bronk, Hendrick Remsen, Gerrit Van Bergen in Martin Van Bergen, dated 9th day of April 1742. In witness whereof we have set our hands this 6th day of January 1742-3.\n\nThe above deed may be found in vol. XIII. Of land papers, page 134, in the office of the secretary of State, at Albany. June 30th 1743 a patent was issued to Casparus Bronk, Martin Van Bergen, Gerrit Van Bergen, and Hendrick Remsen for the tract as described above. This patent is recorded in the book XII., page 198, in the office of the secretary of State, at Albany.\n\nThe first tract, which still bears the name of Stighkoke, is in the western part of the town. It will be seen that it is a square, two miles on each side, and with its corners coinciding nearly with the cardinal points. So completely has the knowledge and remembrance of the location of this patent passed away, that it has required the most persevering efforts to locate its boundaries. The east corner of the patent on the small run of water, where it took a short turn around the trees, is about half a mile east of the village of Jacksonville, on the east side of the farm lately owned by Amos Finch, and now in possession of Joseph Earl. The small runoff water is the little brook with crosses the road at the foot of the hill, a little east of the house, and making a turn to the west runs into the east branch of Potick Creek, a short distance below the village. A short distance south of the barn on the Finch farm are the remains of a dam, where a saw-mill stood in the latter part of the town, and it is marked on the map of the patent made in 1792 as Roosas mill. The corner of the patent is on this run of water, about forty rods north of the road. The west corner of the patent is not far from the Greenville town line, and is at the west end of the farm of John Halstead. The southerly lien of the patent is the division between this farm and that of Abel Waters, adjoining. The south corner is on the road from Jacksonville to Cornwalls mills, about a quarter of a mile north of the saw-mill. The north corner is short distance north of the school-house in district No. 12.\n\nDivision of the Patent of Stighkoke\n\nJune 16th 1744, Gerrit and Martin Van Bergen, and Hendrick Remsen, conveyed to Casparus Bronk their three-quarter share of the patent. The said Patent having been procured for the said Bronk, and the money having been procured for the said Bronk, and the money having been paid by him. The deed may be found in book G, page 70, county clerks office, Albany.\n\nIn March 1752, Casparus Bronk sold the whole patent to Teunis Van Vechten, and in the same month Van Vechten sold to Abraham and William Salisbury each one-fourth of the whole tract. By deed of November 6th 1770, Francis, Abraham and Wessel Salisbury, three sons of Abraham Salisbury (then deceased), sold to Johannes and Frederick Brandow one-fourth of the patent. The deeds, very beautifully executed, are now in the possession of Robert Henry Van Bergen.\n\nBy will, dated January 1786, Johannes Brandow left to his son William one-fourth of his share, and the remainder to his daughters, Elizabeth, Maria and Margaret. William Brandow, by will dated July 1788, left his one-fourth to his daughters, Sarah and Jane Brandow.\n\nFrederick Brandow, by will dated September 1787, left to each of his daughters, Elizabeth, Catharine, Sarah and Margaret, one-sixth of his share; one-sixth to his grandson, Peter Eckler, and the remaining one-sixth to Annatje, wife of Johannes Souser.\n\nTeunis Van Vechten left his share by will, August 1782, to his sons Teunis and Abraham.\n\nElizabeth, daughter of Johannes Brandow, married Johannes Conyn; Maria married Samuel Allen; Margaret married Wilhelmus Brandow; Elizabeth, daughter of Frederick Brandow, married Henry Webber; Margaret married Robert Vandenberg.\n\nBy means of these various sales, devises, divisions and sub-divisions, the patent in 1792 became the property of the following parties, and in the proportions stated: William Salisbury, Teunis and Abraham Van Vechten (sons of Teunis), each one-fourth part; the daughters of Johannes Brandow (Elizabeth, Maria and Margaret), each one-thirty-second part; the heirs of Frederick Brandow (Elizabeth, Catharine, Sarah, Margaret, Annatje and Peter Eckler, a grandson), each one-forty-eighth part; and the heirs of William Brandow (Sarah and Jane) each one-sixty-fourth part.\n\nOn the application of Robert Vandenberg, the husband of Margaret, daughter of Frederick Brandow, the Court of Common Pleas, in 1792, appointed Leonard Bronk, James Barker, and Elijah Yeomans commissioners to make partition of the patent among its several owners.\n\nThey began by dividing the tract into two parts by running a line, commencing at a point on the patent line, 27 chains south of the place where the patent began and running north 86 degrees 30west to the opposite side, which was at a point about four rods south of the west corner. More than half the tract encroached on the Coeymans Patent and the line thus run was supposed to be the south line of that patent and thus separated the disputed from the undisputed lands. This line at the west end is now the division between the lands of Washington Hill and John Halstead. The disputed lands on the north side of the line are divided into four lots of 384 acres each, of these Lot No. 1 was divided into 10 smaller lots, and fell to the Brandow family; Lot No. 2 fell to Abraham Van Vechten; Lot No. 3 to Teunis Van Vechten; and Lot No. 4 to William Salisbury. Lot No. 1, or the Brandow Lot, is on the northwest side of the tract, and part of it is now owned by their descendants. The undisputed lands south of the line were also divided into 4 lots of 266 acres each, and Lot No. 1 fell to Abraham Van Vechten, Lot No. 2 to William Salisbury, Lot No. 3 to Teunis Van Vechten, and Lot No. 4 to the Brandows. Lot No. 4 was subdivided into 11 smaller lots. A lot of 22 acres, situated at the east corner of the undisputed lands, fell to Peter Eckler. It lies on the sough of the road at the east end of the village of Jacksonville, and is now owned by Ambrose Green. A small barn is standing on the west end of the lot, a short distance west of the buildings on the Finch farm. The east line of the lot by the small barn is the original patent line. The village of Jacksonville is wholly within this tract and near the east corner.\n\nCoeymans Confirmation Line\n\nProbably few things have been so much both the cause and the prevention of hotly contended law suits as the line above mentioned. According to the terms of Coeymans Patent, its south boundary was to be a line to extend due west from Coxsackie till it reached a point 12 miles distant from the mouth of Coxsackie Creek. In 1749 Samuel Coeymans and David Verplanck employed John R. Bleecker to run the south line of the patent, which he did, and the line thus run was called Bleeckers Line. It is this line which was considered as the north boundary of the Roseboom Patent. In 1767 John Morin Scott and others petitioned the governor for certain lands which were said to be within the bounds of the Coeymans Patent, which they believed to be vacant. The owners of this patent then issued a caveat against the petition, upon which there was a hearing before the governor and council, and it was adjudicated that the boundary of the Coeymans Patent should be surveyed. The order of the council was issued to the surveyor general, and he directed his deputy, Nanning Visscher, to run and mark the south line of the patent and make report to him. This was done in 1768, and the line thus run was called the confirmation line, and was ever after considered the true south boundary of Coeymans Patent. Both this and Bleeckers line started from the bridge over Coxsackie Creek, but they were simply imaginary lines until they reached the west boundary of Houghtalings Patent, and from that they became actual boundaries. Now these lines were run with ordinary compasses, and apparently no attention was paid to variations, and the result was that when they reached the west boundary of Houghtalings Patent they were a long ways apart, and the distance continued to increase until they reached the end of the line. The location of the confirmation line is well established. It crosses the west line of Houghtalings Patent a few rods south of the road from Coxsackie to Jacksonville on the west line of the farm of William Thorn, and runs across the meadow which lies at the foot of High Hill. It crosses the road a short distance west of the school-house in district No. 8, and runs four rods north of the hotel in Jacksonville. Beyond the east branch of Potick it is the south boundary of the farm of Richard Cornwell. This is probably the line which divided the Stighkoke Patent into disputed and undisputed portions.\n\nThe Forestville Commonwealth\n\nOne of the most interesting episodes in the history of the western part of this town was the community established there about 60 years ago. In 1824, Robert Owen, an English socialist, came to this country, preaching the doctrine of communism, which name had then the baleful significance it has at the present time. It was his favorite theory that the welfare and happiness of mankind could be increased by unity in communities in which all property should be held in common, and it was claimed that this, with associated labor, would greatly enhance the welfare of mankind. Through the influence of his lectures district communities were started in various places, and, among them, one at Haverstraw, on the Hudson. The principals and object of the community was to better their own condition and that of their fellow-men, which they considered could be done by living in community, and having all things in common, giving equal rights to each, and abolishing the terms mine and thine. Thus organized, they attempted to exemplify their theories by practice, but by some means their affairs became disordered, and the experiment came to an end in about five months. After the breaking up of this concern some of the members came to Coxsackie, and, uniting with some persons who were already settled here, they formed a new community, to which they gave the high-sounding name of Forestville Commonwealth. The founders of this undertaking were Samuel and Nathaniel Underhill, William G. Macy, Jethro Macy, John Norbury, Jacob Peterson, John S. Quimby, Henry Dickinson, Jacob Dickinson, Henry C. Fosdick, and Robert Weeks. Of these, the Dickinsons and Quimbys were here before. The site of this community was at a place called Laphams Mills, on a tract of land at the north end of the Stighkoke Patent on the east branch of Potick.\n\nA. M. Lapham, who had a saw and grist-mill there is the latter part of the last century, was accidentally killed by his own machinery. The principles of this community were the same as those of the Haverstraw community, and met with no better success. Their capital was small and they were much in debt. They attempted to carry on an extensive business. Besides a large tract of land and their mill, they had a tannery, a wheelwright shop, and were engaged in shoemaking and other small manufacturing. From the little record they left behind, they seem to have had too many persons engaged in talking and law making, who did not work at any useful employment. The verdict of one of their number was, that There were few good men to steer things right. We wanted men and women who would be willing to live in simple habitations and on plain and simple diet, and be contented with plain and simple clothing, and who would work together for each others good. With such, we might have succeeded, but such attempts cannot succeed without such men. The experiment came to an end in a little more than a year, and on the 23d of October 1827, Henry Fosdick, Samuel Underill, and James Underhill, sold to John Norbury, James Underhill, and John S. Quimby, A tract of land, 315 acres, being the whole lands lately occupied by the Forestville commonwealth. Those who survived and retained the same views, went to Ohio, where they joined what was known as the Kendal Community, in Stark county. John S. Quimby remained for some years in Coxsackie, and had a son, Moses Quimby, the noted bee-keeper, whose work on bee-keeping is a standard authority on the subject. The principal house that was occupied by the community still stands, near the cemetery, and is owned by Amos Butler. The place still bears the name of the community, though not a man in all that region could give a definite account as to how it came by the name.\n\nThe Salisbury Patent, or 700 Acre Tract\n\nApril 20th 1749, a patent was granted to Casparus Bronk, Abraham Salisbury, and William Salisbury, for a tract of land which lies on the south of the Stighkoke Patent, and which is thus described:\n\nBeginning at two spruce pine trees, marked with three notches on four sides, standing on the northeast side of a creek or brook called Potick Creek, four chains below a large fall in said creek. And runs from the said tree north10 degrees west, 22 chains to the most southerly corner of a tract of land granted to Casparus Bronk, then along the line thereof north 50 degrees west, 160 chains to the most westerly corner of the same. Then south 106 chains to the most westerly corner of the same. Then south"
