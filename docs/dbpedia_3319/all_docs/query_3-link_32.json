        "text": "Commission on Acute Respiratory Diseases\n\nIncorporating Three Other Commissions: Commission on Air-Borne Infections Commission on Meningococcal Meningitis Commission on Pneumonia\n\nThis history is dedicated with grateful appreciation to Drs. John H. Dingle and Colin M. MacLeod. Dingle`s pioneering work was highly instrumental in ensuring success of the Commission on Acute Respiratory Diseases. MacLeod, his friend and associate, directed the first Commission on Pneumonia and made lasting contributions not only to a number of commissions, but to the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board. It is not possible to measure the impact of each of these two remarkable medical scientists in the whole field of preventive medicine.\n\nForeword\n\nThe annals of military preventive medicine provides a remarkable record of achievement extending from Beaumont to Billings to Sternberg, Reed, Strong, Siler, Simmons, and so many more. Their work was a culmination of intelligent thought and scientific innovation all aimed at solving problems that arose from those social forces and political upheavals that involve society as a whole. So often, there has been productive interaction between military and civilian scientists. Their combined opinions and collective funds of knowledge have helped determine just what should be done and how it might be accomplished, all with the aim to better maintain the highest standards of health in military personnel.\n\nWilliam S. Jordan, Jr., has carefully evaluated and addressed these principles in preparation of his history of four commissions of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board (AFEB). Each commission, in its own unique way, was involved in vital issues that required identity of cause, clarification of pathogenesis, and how best to prevent specific illness in the individual and throughout the military population.\n\nThroughout the AFEB`s illustrious history, no one has been more devoted and contributed more to the cause of prevention and control of infectious diseases in the U.S. military services than Dr. Jordan. He was in an admirable position to prepare this account of the activities of the Commission on Acute Respiratory Diseases (CARD) and three related, short-lived Commissions, having knowledge of them almost from their beginnings. John Dingle, first director of the CARD, was one of Jordan`s attendings in 1940 and 1941, when he was a medical student serving as a substitute intern on the Harvard Medical Service at Boston City Hospital (BCH). After graduation in 1942, he interned at BCH with such mentors as Drs. Chester Keefer and Maxwell Finland before active duty as a Naval Medical Officer. When home on leave in his hometown of Fayetteville, North Carolina, in the summer of 1944, he visited Dr. Dingle and the CARD laboratory at Fort Bragg. After World War II and more training at BCH, he joined Dr. Dingle`s new Department of Preventive Medicine at Western Reserve University, working there during the years that Dr. Dingle continued as director of the CARD and later as president of the AFEB. Dr. Jordan then moved to the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville to create his own Department of Preventive Medicine and to serve for 6 years as the CARD director. Subsequently, as dean of the College of Medicine at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, and as director of the Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Program at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, he continued to participate in the activities of the AFEB.\n\nNever have I known Bill to shirk a difficult assignment because of being \"too busy.\" Furthermore, the ultimate product always came as close to the best solution as possible. Although technically retired, he continues as an involved public servant performing with his characteristic alert, vigorous, and wise approach to problem solving.\n\n-Theodore E. Woodward, M.D.\n\nHistory of the Commission on Acute Respiratory Diseases, Commission on Air-Borne Infections, Commission on Meningococcal Meningitis, and Commission on Pneumonia\n\nWilliam S. Jordan, Jr., M.D.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFive of the first seven commissions formed at the first meeting (6 February 1941) of the Board for Investigation and Control of Influenza and Other Epidemic Diseases in the Army dealt with respiratory pathogens: Commissions on Influenza, Measles, Meningitis, Pneumonia, and Streptococcal Infections. At its third meeting 5 months later, the Board formed the Commission on Cross Infections in Hospitals, which was renamed the Commission on Air-Borne Infections shortly thereafter because the sterilization of air was a common problem for all groups seeking to prevent disease by limiting the dissemination of airborne organisms. Within 1 year, the Commissions on Acute Respiratory Diseases (CARD) and Neurotropic Viruses began. Thus, 7 of the first 10 commissions were concerned with airborne bacteria and viruses that cause respiratory infections.\n\nAs the Board gained experience with the commissions and as new problems were identified, new commissions were formed and existing ones merged or terminated. The Commission on Measles soon added Mumps to its title and eventually joined the Commission on Neurotropic Viruses to become the Commission on Viral and Rickettsial Diseases. The Commission on Hemolytic Streptococcal Infections was folded into the CARD in 1946 but was revived in 1949. The other three respiratory pathogen-related commissions were incorporated into the CARD after World War II,: Pneumonia in December, 1945, and Air-Borne Infections and Meningococcal Meningitis in April, 1946. These and subsequent administrative actions are listed in chronological order in Appendix 1. The research projects undertaken and observations made by the last four above-named commissions are listed in approximate order in Appendix 2.\n\nAs far as possible, study results are dated when they were reported to the Board or to the Commissions, rather than when they were published, to illustrate better the evolution of the problems explored, information gained, and control measures tested. Except for the items in Appendices I and II, the material related to streptococcal infections has been incorporated in the account of the Commission on Streptococcal and Staphylococcal Diseases (CSSD).\n\nThe following sections discuss the origins and organization of these four commissions, with emphasis on the longer-lived CARD. The scientific contributions made during their periods of service are then summarized, along with information as to the current knowledge of the etiology, epidemiology, prevention, and control of the diseases of concern to them. Lists of the publications of the Commissions are appended and will not be referenced here. Those interested in learning of the details of a particular study can do so by matching Appendix 2 with the list of publications and by consulting the supplemental references that cite the relevant and subsequent reports of others.\n\n6\n\nÂ\n\nADMINISTRATION\n\nAcute Respiratory Diseases\n\nThe specter of a repeat of the influenza pandemic of 1918 and 1919 and its attendant high mortality from pneumonia accounted for the inclusion of influenzas the only specific disease mentioned in the title of the Board for the Investigation and Control of Influenza and Other Epidemic Diseases in the Army. The structure of the Board and its commissions was similarly shaped by the experience in these years. In World War I, the Pneumonia Commission of 1917 had supplemented undermanned military staffs with civilian physicians, and the Pneumonia Board of 1918 had organized specialist groups on short notice to investigate pneumonia whenever the need arose.\n\nAmong the commissions formed by the Board at its first meeting 10 months before the attack on Pearl Harbor were those for Influenza and Pneumonia. The minutes of this meeting note that the Influenza Commission is to include \"related acute respiratory diseases,\" although a mission statement prepared after the third meeting of the Board just a few months later makes no mention of this fact.\n\nOne year later, at the fifth meeting of the Board in May, 1942, John H. Dingle, M.D. presented the report of a group appointed to investigate primary atypical pneumonia at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. In addition to discussion of that disease, the minutes emphasize the difficulty in characterizing respiratory disease, noting that \"advance requires a major effort in etiology and serology.\" There was prolonged and detailed discussion of the proposal, first outlined by Dr. Dingle in response to an informal suggestion by Colonel James Stevens (Steve) Simmons, that a permanent commission or group be established to study respiratory diseases. The Board recommended to The Surgeon General that provision be made for a permanent year-round study of respiratory disease by a specially selected group of investigators, provided details could be worked out satisfactorily. Such was the genesis of the CARD, a commission that differed from all others in that it was \"organized on a full-time or permanent basis for the purpose of making a continuing study of various types of acute diseases of the respiratory tract, particularly those of undetermined etiology.\"\n\nThe report that Dr. Dingle presented to the Board summarized studies of the Commission for the Investigation of Atypical Pneumonia and Other Respiratory Diseases at Camp Claiborne, the forerunner of the CARD. Dr. Dingle had been studying this recently described syndrome with Dr. Maxwell Finland at the Boston City Hospital and had earlier led a team of Harvard scientists to investigate simultaneous outbreaks of diphtheria, meningococcal meningitis, and scarlet fever at Halifax, Nova Scotia, an important wartime port for the British Commonwealth. He was already a member of the Influenza Commission. Drs. Dingle and W. Barry Wood, Jr. (Associate, Department of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins Medical School, Baltimore, Maryland), a member of the Commission on Pneumonia, were dispatched by the Board to Camp Claiborne to investigate an outbreak of an unusual \"acute pneumonitis.\" When the scope of the problem became obvious, the group of investigators was expanded by the addition of Drs. G. John Buddingh (Associate Professor of Bacteriology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee) and Alto E. Feller (Associate, Department of Internal Medicine, State University of Iowa, Ames, Iowa) of the Commission on Influenza, Drs. Theodore J. Abernethy (Associate Professor of Medicine, George Washington University, School of Medicine, Washington, D.C.) and James M. Ruegsegger (Chief, Pneumonia Service, Cincinnati General Hospital) of the Commission on Pneumonia, and consultants in biostatistics, Dr. George F. Badger(Associate in Biostatistics, School of Hygiene and Public Health, The Johns Hopkins University) and epidemiology, and Dr. Alexander Langmuir (Deputy Commissioner, Westchester County Health Department, New York). An Army staff member assigned to assist was Captain Norman L. Cressy of the Fourth Corps Area Laboratory.\n\nThe initial field team of Drs. Dingle (laboratorian) and Wood (clinician) was elected by Dr. Colin MacLeod (Professor of Bacteriology, New York University, New York, New York), Director of the Com-\n\n7\n\nCommission for the Investigation of Atypical Pneumonia and Other Respiratory Diseases at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana, 1942.\n\nFront row, left to right: Captain Norman L. Cressy, Dr. G. John Buddingh, Dr. James M. Ruegsegger, Dr. Theodore Abernethy, Dr. John H. Dingle, Dr. W. Barry Wood, Jr., and Captain Rappoport (Base pathologist).\n\nBack row, left to right: Dr. Edward Weiss, Dr. Alexander D. Langmuir, and Dr. George F. Badger.\n\n8\n\nmission on Pneumonia, at the request of Dr. Francis Blake (Professor of Medicine, Yale University, School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut), President of the Board; the team was supposed to include Dr. Langmuir, as recommended by Dr. Dingle. The members of the team were to be released on leave with pay by their respective institutions and paid as \"Consultants to the Secretary of War\" at the rate of $10.00 per day; however, Langmuir`s superior refused to recommend him for leave with pay. Dr. Blake then persuaded the National Academy of Sciences to fund Dr. Langmuir`s salary and travel, and he reported 2 months after Drs. Dingle and Wood to Camp Claiborne, where he and the others stayed for 3 months.\n\nWhen CARD was activated on 1 August 1942, with Dr. Dingle as Director, all members of the Claiborne Commission, with the exception of Drs. Buddingh and Wood, including Captain Cressy, became members of this permanent group. They were joined within the year by Drs. Elias Strauss(Research Associate in Epidemiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York), Charles H. Rammelkamp (Instructor of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine), and Hugh Tatlock, a National Research Council Fellow.\n\nThe CARD, like the Board, was a creature of the Boston-to-Baltimore axis, with a few extensions to the middle west, reflecting the dominance of the eastern medical schools in the early 1940s. Drs. Dingle and Badger were graduate students at The Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health at the same time. Dr. Dingle then went to Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, and met Dr. Wood when the latter was a fellow in bacteriology. Ten years earlier, Dr. Ruegsegger had done work on the pneumococcus with Dr. Finland at the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory of the Boston City Hospital before joining the Department of Medicine at the University of Cincinnati. Dr. Dingle knew Drs. Rammelkamp and Strauss at the Boston City Hospital, Dr. Langmuir at both that hospital and at Johns Hopkins, and Dr. Feller at Harvard before Feller joined Dr. MacLeod`s department at New York University. Dr. Abernethy had entered practice in Washington, D.C., after a residency with Dr. William S. Tillett at Johns Hopkins (before Tillett moved to New York University) and after 3 years at the Rockefeller Institute, New York, New York, where he met Dr. A. R. Dochez, a member of the Board. The youngest member to join the group in November 1943 was Dr. Irving Gordon, who had done work on the influenza virus with Dr. Frank Horsfall at the Rockefeller Institute before spending 1942 at Trudeau Sanatorium with tuberculosis. After leaving Trudeau, Dr. Gordon worked in the laboratories of the New York State Health Department in Albany, where he met Dr. Langmuir, who was then Deputy Health Commissioner of Westchester County. All of these relationships were of great value, for these friends and acquaintances became an extremely effective, productive, and congenial group of investigators.\n\nIn the interval between Camp Claiborne and Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the initial CARD members worked on the report of the Camp Claiborne studies at Johns Hopkins, accommodated through the kindness of Dr. Lowell Reed, while awaiting construction of facilities at the station hospital at Fort Bragg. A W-1 ward building at Fort Bragg was remodeled to serve as a laboratory, and an animal house was constructed as an addition to the hospital morgue. The staff reported on 19 October and lived for about 6 weeks in a nurses` barracks, while seeking housing in nearby Fayetteville. The rooms in the barracks were retained in subsequent years as on-call sleeping quarters. As the work expanded, a ward adjacent to the CARD`s laboratory was made available, and a new nine-room air-conditioned animal house constructed.\n\nAdditional facilities were obtained to house volunteers during attempts to transmit primary atypical pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses to them. A preliminary study was conducted at a Civilian Public Service Camp in the Great Smoky National Park near Gatlinburg, Tennessee in buildings formerly used by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Subsequent experiments were conducted in the Holly Inn in nearby Pinehurst, North Carolina, a hotel with facilities adequate for the isolation of volunteers in individual rooms equipped with a private bath. Volunteers were recruited from a group of conscientious objectors identified with the assistance of Selective Service, the National Service Board for Religious Objectors, and the American Friends Service Committee.\n\nWhen the establishment of a commission to be located on a military base was discussed at the fifth meeting of the Board, the Chief of Personnel Service, Colonel George F. Lull \"was of the opinion that it\n\n9\n\nStaff of the Commission on Acute Respiratory Diseases (CARD) Laboratory at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, May, 1943.\n\nKneeling, left to right: T / 4 R. L.

About this time, Ruegsegger left to accept a commission in the Navy because, \"I didn`t think I was contributing much to the war effort\" looking for unknown agents. During his 3 years as a Naval Preventive Medicine Officer, he helped make the diagnosis of pneumococcal endocarditis in President Franklin Roosevelt and to obtain penicillin for the President`s treatment. By the spring of 1944,the majority of the physicians were commissioned in the Army of the United States. Despite a limp attributed to poliomyelitis in childhood, Dr. Dingle was commissioned Major, as were Drs. Abernethy, Badger, and Langmuir. Dr. Tatlock was made a Captain; Dr. Cressy advanced from Captain to Major, and Dr. Strauss, from 1st Lieutenant to Captain. Despite the prior waiver statement, Drs. Feller, Gordon, and Rammelkamp were not commissioned because of their medical histories. The group did manage to stay together, although Dr. Langmuir received orders for detached duty (never executed) shortly before all were decommissioned and returned to civilian status. Dr. Dingle received a terminal commission as Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nFunds for the CARD budget were provided through a War Department contract with Yale University. The budget approved by the Board for the year beginning 1July 1943 was $4,000 short of the $100,000 requested by Dr. Dingle, as follows:\n\nThe major source of financial support was obtained from private foundations, presumably through the combined efforts of Commission Director Dingle and Board President Blake. Contributions to the Board on behalf of CARD were as follows:\n\nPrivate Financial Support for CARD\n\nÂ\n\nRockefeller Foundation\n\n$25,000\n\nW. K. Kellogg Foundation\n\n20,000\n\nCommonwealth Fund\n\n15,000\n\nJohn & Mary R. Markle Foundation\n\n10,000\n\nTotal\n\n$70,000\n\nBy November 1945, the budget for the Central Board and 10 commissions totaled$570,544, with the largest budget, $86,200, being that for the CARD. The available records do not make clear how the foundation funds were melded into the total or why the CARD budget appeared to decrease by $10,000 in 2 years. One possible explanation is that the fiscal year 1946 Board budget included an additional $14,330 for civil service employees at the CARD laboratory and $6,000for supplies. The field laboratory closed 8 months later, at which time the CARD budget consisted of all research contracts and CARD with its investigators and their institutions.\n\nSuch a contract was awarded to Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, on behalf of Dr. Dingle, to continue studies on acute respiratory diseases. Although the war was over, the military decided that it still needed the advice of the Army Epidemiological Board and the expertise of certain of its commissions. Dr. Dingle, who continued as CARD Director until 1955, and his colleagues at Fort Bragg, conceived the idea of applying the epidemiological and laboratory methods used to study recruits to the study of a civilian population. Dr. Dingle and three other members of the CARD, Drs. Badger, Feller, and Rammelkamp, were persuaded by Dr. Joseph T. Wearn, then Dean of the School of Medicine at Western Reserve, to come to Cleveland to undertake such studies using as a base a new Department of Preven-\n\n11\n\nStaff of The Commission Acute Respiratory Diseases (CARD) Laboratory, November, 1944.\n\nKneeling, left to right: Dr. C.

Hodges, a pediatrician, who had conducted the studies of pneumococcal vaccine at the Army Air Base Technical School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, with Dr. MacLeod of the Commission on Pneumonia. This nuclear group was joined later by William S. Jordan, Jr., who had known Dr. Dingle at the Boston City Hospital, Harold S. Ginsberg, also trained at Boston City and formerly Chief of the Medical Service at the Station Hospital at Fort Bragg; Floyd W. Denny, Jr., once assigned as a young medical officer to the Department for training before a tour of duty at the Streptococcal Diseases Laboratory at Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming; Harold B. Houser, who served as Field Director of the Laboratory on Housing and Illness, Robert Oseasohn, and others. When Dr. Dingle became President of the Board, Drs. Feller, Jordan, and Denny, in turn, became Director of CARD.\n\nDr. Dingle served as Chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Western Reserve until 1969. Despite a progressive disability, he maintained an interest in education and research until his death in 1973. Dr. Badger became Chairman of the Department of Biostatistics before retiring in 1972 to a community southeast of Cleveland, where he died on 30 November 1991 of a heart attack. Dr. Feller became Chairman of the Department of Microbiology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, but unfortunately died at an early age of coronary heart disease in 1946 while vacationing at Nag`s Head, North Carolina. Dr. Hodges died in Cleveland of myocardial infarction at an even earlier age. Dr. Rammelkamp, as Professor of Medicine, became Director of the Department of Medicine at the Cleveland City Hospital and played a major role in transforming it into the Metropolitan General Hospital of Cuyahoga County. He died in 1981 of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Dr. Denny served as Chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of North Carolina for 17 years and continued as a professor there in 1992. Dr. Ginsberg served sequentially as Chairman of the Departments of Microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, retiring in1993 to Bethesda, Maryland, where he continued studies of adenoviruses in the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).Dr. Houser became Chairman of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistic sat Case Western Reserve, the eventual successor of Dr. Dingle`s Department of Preventive Medicine, retiring in 1992 to Sun Lakes, Arizona. Dr. Jordan became, in succession, Chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine and Professor of Medicine at the University of Virginia, Dean of the College of Medicine at the University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, and Director of the Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Program at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH. Dr. Jordan retired in 1987, continuing as a member of the AFEB until 1992 and as a consultant to the National Vaccine Program Office in 1994. Dr. Oseasohn served sequentially as Chairman of the Department of Epidemiology and Community Medicine and Professor of Medicine at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico; Professor of Epidemiology and Associate Dean, University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston; Chairman, Department of Epidemiology and Health, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec; Professor of Epidemiology; and Associate Dean, University of Texas School of Public Health, Master of Public Health Program at San Antonio. In 1992, his wife having died the previous year, he retired to a nursing home suffering from Alzheimer`s disease. He died on June 7,1994.\n\nWorthy of note is Dr. Eli Gold. He was a Sergeant in the laboratory at Fort Bragg and followed the senior staff from there to Western Reserve to enroll as a medical student. After graduation, he was an intern and resident of the Children`s Medical Center in Boston, before returning to Cleveland as Dr. Frederick Robbins` Chief Resident in Pediatrics at the City Hospital. He advanced through the academic ranks to become Chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of California, Davis, Medical Center at Sacramento. He retired in 1987 to Mercer Island, Washington, from where he recalled the occasion of Dr. Dingle`s marriage to Doris Brown in June of 1946, when the 6 x 6 truck used to transport the enlisted men got mired in the mud on the grounds of her parents` house. The new Mrs. Dingle, a native of Fayetteville, which was also Dr. Jordan`s hometown, had worked as a secretary for CARD at Fort Bragg, and followed her husband`s activities with the CARD and the AFEB for many years.\n\nThe other original CARD members` careers continued as follows. Dr. Abernethy returned to private practice in Washington, D.C., retiring after over 40 years to Baltimore, where he died on 4 January\n\n14\n\nDIRECTORS OF THE CARD\n\nALTO E.

Dr. Strauss maintained an active practice in Texas until his death in 1988. Dr. Tatlock ended his Army career as Chief of Infectious Diseases at Walter Reed General Hospital and then spent 35 years in the practice of internal medicine in North hampton, Massachusetts, becoming Chief of Medicine at Cooley Dickinson Hospital before retiring in 1981 to devote himself full time to photography. Dr. Gordon returned to the New York State Department of Health in Albany to head its virology laboratory before moving to California as Chairman of the Department of Microbiology at the University of Southern California, where he continued to teach in 1993, even after retiring. Dr. Langmuir returned to Johns Hopkins as Associate Professor of Epidemiology before moving in 1949 to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, where he founded the Epidemic Intelligence Service and from which he retired in 1970 to teach at The Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health until his death from kidney cancer on 22 November 1993 at age 83.\n\nDuring the postwar life of CARD, the major investigators and their associates supported by the AFEB, in addition to Dr. Dingle at Western Reserve, included Drs. Harry F. Dowling and George G. Jackson at the University of Illinois, Chicago; J. Thomas Grayston, Hjordis M. Foy, and E. Russell Alexander, University of Washington, Seattle; Floyd W. Denny, Wallace A. Clyde, and Gerald W. Fernald, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Carl G. Harford, Washington University, St. Louis; Harry A. Feldman, State University of New York(SUNY)-Syracuse; Lewis Thomas, New York University; Charles E. Smith, initially at the School of Medicine of Stanford University in San Francisco, then later at the University of California at Berkeley with Demosthenes Pappagianis; Alto E. Feller, William S. Jordan, Jack M. Gwaltney, and Owen Hendley, University of Virginia, Charlottesville; Harold S. Ginsberg, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. An important group of investigators supported by another source of federal funds was housed at the NIH Laboratory of Infectious Diseases under the leadership of Dr. Robert M. Chanock, an associate member of the CARD.\n\nAmong the members of this group not previously mentioned, Dr. Dowling retired to Northern Virginia to author a book, City Hospitals, to add to his earlier ones, The Acute Bacterial Diseases and Medicines for Man. Dr. Jackson served with distinction as Editor of the Journal of Infectious Diseases , moved to England to become Director of Virology at the London Hospital Medical Center, and then retired to his home state of Utah. Dr. Grayston became, in succession, Chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Medicine; Dean of the School of Public Health; Vice President for Health Science, all at the University of Washington Medical Center before returning to research in 1984 as Professor of Epidemiology. Dr. Harford remained active at Washington University after his official retirement, but 1992 found him in a nursing home suffering from Alzheimer`s disease. Dr. Foy continued at the University of Washington; Dr. Alexander moved to the University of Arizona and then to the CDC, before returning to Washington; both were still active in 1993. Dr. Feldman served for many years as Chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at SUNY Syracuse and as President of both the American Epidemiological Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, each of which established awards in his name after his death in 1985. Dr. Thomas authored delightful and insightful notes as an observer of biology and medicine (The Lives of a Cell, The Medusa and the Snail, The Youngest Science), while en route from medical school deanships at NYU and Yale to the Chancellorship of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, retiring to continue as Scholar-in-Residence at Cornell University Medical College. Thomas died of Waldenstrom`s disease on 3 November 1993, at age 80. Smith continued to work oncoccidioidomycosis while serving as Dean of the School of Public Health at Berkeley. After Dr. Smith`s death in 1967, Dr. Pappagian is moved these studies to the University of California at Davis when he became Chairman of the Department of Microbiology at its medical school.\n\nAmong noncontractor members who made significant contributions were Drs. Robert Austrian, Professor of Medicine, University of New York, Downstate Medical Center, who became Professor of Research Medicine at University of Pennsylvania, where he continued to study the pneumococcus in 1994; Theodore E. Eickhoff, who was at the CDC when recruited to serve on the Committee on Meningococcal Infections, and was to become Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and Chief of Medicine at Presbyterian/St. Luke`s Medical Center in Denver, continuing there in 1994; and Jay P. Sanford, initially at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, who\n\n16\n\nserved as Dean and Vice President of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences before returning to Texas. Worthy of special mention is another non contractor and loyal associate member, Dr. Finland, who consistently refused to become a member because he didn`t want to participate in contract reviews. Dr. Finland trained many CARD investigators on the wards of the Harvard Medical Service or in the laboratories of the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory at the Boston City Hospital during his 50 years at that institution. He died in 1987 at the age of 85.\n\nAn outstanding feature of the structure and function of the AFEB and its commissions was the interchange that occurred when these investigators met periodically, along with those from military laboratories, to review work in progress and to learn of current problems in the armed forces. Between meetings, commission members and associates could respond to calls for assistance more effectively than might otherwise have been the case because of their knowledge of each other and of three military services. The major annual CARD meeting was held in the spring, usually in tandem with the Commission on Streptococcal and Staphylococcal Diseases (CSSD), so that the two groups could share an overlapping agenda for a day. In the fall, CARD and the Commission on Influenza took advantage of the meeting of the Central Society for Clinical Research in Chicago to meet for 1 day before the Society meeting. Drs. Dowling and Jackson often arranged a dinner for the attendees at a convenient university facility. At the 1959 fall meeting, Dr. Thomas Francis labeled the challenge resulting from the explosive identification of new viruses as \"viral smog,\" and the suggestion was made that CARD sponsor the preparation of a laboratory guide for the isolation and characterization of the new respiratory viruses. Dr. Jackson enlisted the help of Drs. Chanock, Karl Johnson, and Robert Muldoon to produce a loose-leaf Manual of New Viruses Causing Respiratory Illnesses in Man. The first 100 copies of this manual, prepared at a cost of $377.66, exclusive of the authors` time and effort, were distributed in June 1961. The publication was widely acclaimed, with requests for copies coming from the World Health Organization, and laboratories in many countries.\n\nConcurrently, the use of cell cultures had resulted in the discovery of a host of enteric viruses \"in search of disease\" or \"orphan viruses.\" Investigators who sought to relate these enteroviruses to clinical syndromes and to distinguish them from polio viruses needed appropriate antisera and antigens. Because this was also true of those working with respiratory viruses, the AFEB sought the support of the NIAID, which, like the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, also had recognized the need for standardized reference reagents. NIAID had created an adenovirus committee for this purpose. The committee was initially chaired by Dr. Jerome Syverton, Chairman of the Department of Microbiology, University of Minnesota, with Drs. Ginsberg and Jordan of CARD and Dr. Edwin Lennette of the Commission on Influenza among the members. Dr. Syverton died of a heart attack in a New York taxi on his way to another meeting, after an early meeting of the adenovirus committee. He was succeeded as chairman by Dr. Jordan.\n\nAt a meeting at NIAID on 16 February 1960, representatives of the Public Health Service (PHS) and AFEB agreed to seek mechanisms to expand the scope of the adenovirus committee. Those in attendance were Drs. Dorland Davis, Scientific Director (subsequently Director), Paul Peterson, Associate Director, and Robert Huebner, Chief, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, all of NIAID; Dr. Francis, President, AFEB; Dr. Fred Davenport, Commission on Influenza; Dr. William Hammon, Commission on Virus Diseases; Dr. Ralph Hogan, Chief, Laboratory of Virology, CDC; Dr. Harvey Scudder, Division of Research Grants, NIH; and Dr. E. H. Arnold, affiliation not recorded. Out of this meeting grew the Reference Reagents Program of NIAID that was to provide high quality antigens and antisera to investigators for many years before its repository and distribution functions were transferred to the American Type Culture Collection in the 1980s. The contributions made by CARD investigators and others to the dispersal of the etiologic smog are summarized in the research section.\n\nAir-Borne Infections\n\nThe Commission on Air-borne Infections (CABI) began life in June 1941 as the Commission on Cross Infections in Hospitals. The investigations required by The Surgeon General, at that time, were to \"carry on work pertaining to the prevention of cross-infections in Army Hospitals. Cross-infections\n\n17\n\nMAXWELL FINLAND, M.D.\n\nAs a Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Chief of Infectious Diseases at the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory at Boston City Hospital, Dr. Maxwell Finland, long a student of pneumonia, conducted pioneering studies of the sulfonamides and penicillin. He trained many members of CARD and served it faithfully as a Associate Member for over 12 years.\n\n18\n\nhave been an important problem for many years and it is now believed that their control can be brought about through the installation of air filters on sterilizing lamps. These studies will involve the purchase of extensive equipment and very close observation by highly-trained specialists and technicians over extended periods of time.\"\n\nDr. Oswald H. Robertson, Professor of Medicine at the University of Chicago and already a member of the Commission on Influenza, was named Director. He had just published the results of studies of the effectiveness of propylene glycol vapor as an aerosol against a number of organisms, including influenza A virus. Three other members also represented liaison with other Commissions: Drs. C. Philip Miller, also a Professor of Medicine at the University of Chicago (Meningococcal Meningitis); Wilson G. Smillie, another former research fellow at the Rockefeller Institute, Chairman of the Department of Public Health, Cornell Medical College (Influenza); and Joseph Stokes, Jr., Professor of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania (Measles and Mumps). Two other physician members were Drs. Clayton G. Loosli, who had done research with Dr. Robertson and had advanced to Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Chicago, and Dr. Francis F. Schwentker, Staff Member, International Health Division, Rockefeller Foundation (Director, Commission on Hemolytic Streptococcal Infections). Undoubtedly at the suggestion of Dr. Stokes, Mr. William F. Wells, Associate Professor in Air-Borne Infection, an expert from the University of Pennsylvania, completed the roster. This group, with the exception of Dr. Schwentker who was added later, met in Chicago the following October to plan how to exploit air sterilization methods to reduce the number of pathogenic bacteria and viruses in operating rooms, hospital wards, and barracks. A field study was initiated at the Station Hospital at Chanute Field, Illinois, and research with animals begun in laboratories at the University of Chicago and the University of Pennsylvania. During the following year, the CABI program was designed to include the following:\n\n(1) Study of the effects of ultraviolet light, under varied conditions of radiation, for its bactericidalaction on air-borne microorganisms and for the prevention of spread of bacteria from patient to patient.\n\n(2) Investigation of the pharmacological effects of propylene glycol vapor on animals and the ability of this vapor to destroy pathogenic microorganisms and viruses.\n\n(3) When satisfactory evidence is obtained showing that propylene glycol vapor is not toxic, study of the activity of the vapor in the same manner in which ultraviolet light is being investigated.\n\n(4) Study of the comparative effectiveness of both ultraviolet radiation and propylene glycol vapor on dust-borne bacteria.\n\n(5) Investigation of the bactericidal and viricidal properties of other glycols.\n\n(6) When deemed appropriate, the application of these measures for the control of air-borne infection to relatively isolated and fairly large non-hospitalized groups.\n\nThe first budget found in the records is for $53,705.00 in fiscal year 1946, by which time two other members had been added to the commission: Morton Hamburger, Jr., M.D., and Theodore T. Puck, Ph.D., both members of the Department of Medicine, University of Chicago. Hamburger, who had worked in Robertson`s laboratory in 1938, was named Field Director. In addition, Captain Henry M. Lemon participated in CABI studies as they were transferred to Camp Carson, Colorado, and later to Fort Lewis, Washington. After development of an apparatus for dispensing glycol vapor, its use was tested at the Harriet Lane Home, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, and laundry methods were sought for the application of an oil emulsion to bedding.\n\nIncreasing attention was being paid to the physical aspects of housing prompted by the decision of the Commanding General, Services of Supply, in October 1942, to reduce the space allowance for troop housing to 40square feet per man. At the request of The Surgeon General, 10 members of the AFEB and its commissions visited 19 Army posts and camps during December to consider the current and expected incidence of acute respiratory disease in troops. The survey called particular attention to inadequate provisions for proper ventilation and recommended that steps be taken to ensure that ventilation of 1,800 cubic feet per man hour be provided in barracks at night. Members of the AFEB were critical, of the overcrowding that existed but did not consider double bunking undesirable because it created more floor space and airspace and less actual contact of men while sleeping.\n\n19\n\nDR. OSWALD H. ROBERTSON, M.D.\n\nDr. Oswald H. Robertson served as Professor of Medicine, University of Chicago, and Director of the Commission on Air-Borne Infections from 1942 to 1946. He was one of the first to study the effectiveness of propylene glycol vapor as an aerosol against influenza virus.\n\n20\n\nDr. Kenneth F. Maxcy, in his report on Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, noted that\n\nAttention is particularly directed to defects in design and operation of the heating systems installed in standard two-story barracks (Plans 700-1165 and 800-443). From the point of view of comfort and spread of infection improvement could and should be made. This is a very practical and important problem which might receive more extended attention from Dr. O. H. Robertson and his Commission on Cross Infections in Hospitals.\n\nAt a special meeting on 29 January 1943, the AFEB transmitted the following resolution to the Surgeon General:\n\nIn view of the increasing incidence of acute respiratory diseases and meningococcal meningitis during December 1942 and January 1943 and based upon an inspection of camps by members of the Board and its Commissions, the Board desires to go on record as emphasizing the influence of crowding in barracks, mess halls, and recreation halls on the spread of meningitis, acute respiratory and other epidemic diseases. Crowding is only one factor in this situation but a highly important one. In general terms it can be positively stated that the greater the crowding the greater is the risk of an epidemic of serious proportions. The order reducing the minimum floor space per man in barracks from sixty (60) square feet to forty (40) square feet, while a military necessity, is in an undesirable direction from the standpoint of maintenance of health. The effect of this provision not only results in overcrowding in barracks but also an equally undesirable overcrowding in mess halls, wash rooms, latrines, post exchanges, etc., and overloads all existing facilities. The Board especially emphasizes the greater susceptibility of recruits to acute respiratory and other epidemic diseases and the greater risks of epidemics during the winter months (December through March), particularly under conditions of crowding.\n\nIn May 1943, the name of the Commission was changed from Cross Infections in Hospitals to Air-Borne Infections in keeping with the emphasis on housing and the search for methods to limit the spread of respiratory pathogens in barracks. The CABI and CARD addressed these problems for the next 3 years, in collaboration with the Commission on Hemolytic Streptococcal Infections. A report in 1945 noted that significantly lower rates were observed during an epidemic of acute respiratory disease among men living in barracks with double bunks than in control barracks. At the same meeting of the AFEB on 15 April 1946, at which the CABI was terminated, the AFEB reaffirmed its position of being opposed to the use of double bunking unless over crowding is avoided.\n\nIt is recommended that double bunking is justified in barracks, but should not be used to accommodate more than one man per sixty square feet of floorspace (i.e., per one hundred and twenty square feet of floor space for each double bunk).\n\nThe notes of this meeting called for the Commission on Environmental Hygiene to continue the studies of the CABI. In truth, that Commission focused on occupational health and toxicology, studying the adaptation of a human to his environment, the medical aspects of clothing, cold, heat, ventilation, and the disposal of waste. Yet, a need existed for additional studies of the effect of housing on the occurrence of disease, both infectious and neuropsychiatric. An ad hoc committee of CARD on space allocation in troop housing recommended that a Laboratory on Housing and Illness be established at Sampson Air Force Base, New York.\n\nAt the time of organization of this Laboratory in January 1954, Sampson Air Force Base had been a recruit training center for about 3 years. The Air Force had established the Epidemiological Detachment, 1141st Medical Service Squadron of the 1070th Medical Activity Group at Sampson in 1951 to study streptococcal infections and methods of prophylaxis. In addition, the Epidemiological Detachment was cooperating with the Commission on Influenza in influenza vaccine trials. The stated ap-\n\n21\n\nproach of the new laboratory was fundamental study of the problem of military housing on a long-term basis, rather than simple determination of the ideal number of square or cubic feet per man. The work of the Epidemiological Detachment was to be coordinated with and under the direction of the director of the housing studies. Initial support of the Laboratory was by contract with the School of Aviation Medicine. Drs. Feldman (SUNY-Syracuse) and Houser (on assignment from Western Reserve University) were the responsible investigators, with Dr. Houser designated as Field Director. Planning and conduct of the studies were under the aegis of CARD. From 1 August1955, the laboratory was supported through Department of Army contracts, with Hr. Houser as the responsible investigator.\n\nField, laboratory, and clinical studies were well underway by February 1954. The deficiencies of the original laboratory space for virological work and the increased volume of bacteriologic and other laboratory procedures necessitated remodeling of the laboratory; this remodeling was completed in September 1955. In December 1955, input of recruits to Sampson was markedly reduced and the decision to close the base was announced. In June 1956, the base officially closed. Dr. Houser transferred records and selected biological specimens to the Upstate Medical Center at Syracuse. There, a new laboratory was completed and in operation by late fall of 1956. Work continued at Syracuse on the collected material and specimens until June 1958 when the contract and certain materials were transferred to Western Reserve University, where work on the contract continued until 31 July 1960.\n\nThe subsequent careers of Drs. Feldman and Houser have been recorded earlier. Of the original CABI members, Dr. Robertson retired to California in 1949 to devote himself to the study of the endocrinology of salmon and trout; he died in 1966. Dr. Miller became Professor Emeritus in 1960; he died in 1985. Dr. Smillie continued as head of the Department of Pubic Health at Cornell until 1955, during which time he coauthored a textbook on preventive medicine with Dr. Edwin D. Kilbourne, then a member of his department and a long-time member of the Commission on Influenza. Dr. Smillie died in 1971. Dr. Stokes died in 1972 after a distinguished career in academic pediatrics. Dr. Loosli moved from Chicago to Los Angeles to become Dean of the School of Medicine of the University of Southern California; he died in 1976. Dr. Schwentker, the first Director of the CSSD, had been the first to report, along with coauthors Drs. Sidney Gelman and Perrin H. Long in 1937, that sulfanilamide was effective in the treatment of meningococcal meningitis. Suicide shortly after the commissions were formed ended Dr. Schwentker`s promising career.\n\nDr. Hamburger became Professor of Medicine at the University of Cincinnati and was a continuing contributor to the CSSD, until he drowned in1970 while fishing in the Snake River in Wyoming. Dr. Puck, who had received his doctorate only 1 year before joining CABI, remained at the University of Chicago until 1947, spent 1 year at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena and then became Professor of Biophysics and Chairman of the Department at the School of Medicine of the University of Colorado, Boulder. A recipient of many awards for his work in genetics and immunology, he retired as department chairman in 1967, but continued as Director of the Eleanor Roosevelt Institute of Cancer Research. In 1972, he authored The Mammalian Cell as a Microorganism: Genetic and Biochemical Studies In Vitro. Although his contribution to the control of airborne infections is not evident, of interest is the fact that he listed his brief CABI membership in Who`s Who.\n\nMeningococcal Meningitis\n\nThe Commission on Meningococcal Meningitis was the seventh of the eight commissions created by the Board in March 1941. The Surgeon General \"determined\" that:\n\nThe Meningitis Commission will study the incidence, treatment and prevention of cerebrospinal meningitis. In the control of meningitis, it is necessary to determine the type of germ causing the disease. For this purpose, typing laboratories Will be set up and a more efficient means of typing will be studied. Through work with small groups of individuals, an attempt will be made to develop effective administrative methods for the control of meningitis carriers. Such carriers are apparently normal individuals who harbor the germ in the nose or throat and who disseminate the infection through their secretions during contact, or in sneezing or coughing.\n\n22\n\nHAROLD B. HOUSER, M.D.\n\nDr. Harold B. Houser is shown here (in lab coat) in 1955 with USAF (MSC)Officers at Sampson Air Force Base, where he served as Field Director of the Laboratory on Housing and Illness from 1954 to 1960. Left to right: Captain James Murphy, Houser, Captain Norbert Schalet, 2nd Lieutenant Kenneth W. Sprague. Dr. Houser also served as Field Director of the Influenza Study Group in Santiago, Chile, in 1957.\n\n23\n\nDr. Long, who, like many others, had trained for 2 years at the Rockefeller Institute before becoming Professor of Preventive Medicine of the School of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University, was named Director. An organizational meeting held in Washington on 19 March brought together Dr. Mary C. Kirkbride, Associate Director, Division of Laboratories and Research, New York State Department of Health; Dr. Miller, Professor of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Chicago; Lieutenant Colonel Arthur P Hitchens, U.S. Army, retired, Professor of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania; and Dr. John J. Phair, Associate in Epidemiology, School of Hygiene and Public Health, The Johns Hopkins University. Drs. Long and Miller were charged with reviewing the therapy of the disease, Lieutenant Colonel Hitchens and Dr. Phair were to act as epidemiological consultants, and Drs. Miller and Kirkbride were to set standards for bacteriologic and immunologic studies.\n\nA tentative program for study and control of meningococcal meningitis was formulated and submitted to the AFEB on 26 April. A recommendation was made that a central laboratory be established at The Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health to act as a focal center for interim laboratory studies, preparation and distribution of meningococcal typing sera, and analysis of case data for correlation with strain characteristics. An investigative team was planned to carry on the necessary field studies and to evaluate therapeutic and prophylactic measures. In addition, the importance of a specialized consultation service for the Office of The Surgeon General, Commanding Officers of Army posts, and medical laboratories was recognized and provided.\n\nThe organization and these plans were approved at the third meeting of the AFEB held on 19 June. After this action, the laboratory and personnel of the Department of Epidemiology of the School of Hygiene and Public Health, The Johns Hopkins University, under the direction of Dr. Phair, were made available through the courtesy of Dr. Maxcy, Professor of Epidemiology. Additional personnel and funds were provided by Dr. Long`s Department of Preventive Medicine. The work of the central laboratory was begun late in May 1941 under the supervision of Dr. Phair.\n\nA contract between the Army and The Johns Hopkins University, effective 22November 1941, and totaling $25,000 in 1942,provided support for the Central Laboratory. In addition to the work of the central laboratory, two other studies were financed from November 1941 through June 1943 by contracts, one at the University of Chicago, under the direction of Dr. Miller, the other at Columbia University, under the supervision of Dr. Elvin A. Kabat.\n\nAnticipating an increasing demand for consultation, the personnel of the CARD were augmented in August 1942 by the addition of Drs. Robert W. Graves, Assistant Professor of Neurology, Duke University School of Medicine; Lowell Rantz, Assistant Professor of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Smith, Professor of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, also a member of the Commission on Epidemiological Survey (CES); and Wood, Professor of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, also a member of the Commission on Pneumonia. On 31 August 1942, Dr. Long resigned to accept a commission in the Medical Corps of the Army, and Dr. Phair was chosen to replace him as Director.\n\nIn February 1943, Dr. Emanuel B. Schoenbach, who had been a member of the CES, received a commission in the Medical Corps and was assigned to The Johns Hopkins University. He was appointed to the Commission on Meningococcal Meningitis and took charge of the field investigations. He served as Acting Director during the two brief absences of Dr. Phair between 1 August and 1 November 1943 and between 15 August and 15 November 1945.\n\nAfter not quite 3 years of existence, the Commission on Meningococcal Meningitis was terminated at the meeting of the Board in April 1946. Although the minutes of this meeting refer to the assignment of responsibility for streptococcal infections and pneumonia to CARD, no such assignment was recorded for meningococcal infections. Such infections were to be a continuing problem in the postwar years because an increasing proportion of meningococcal strains became resistant to sulfadiazine, rifampin was yet to be introduced for chemoprophylaxis, and an effective vaccine was still under development.\n\nThe personnel of the wartime CARD continued to make major contributions to infectious diseases and to other commissions. Dr. Long became Professor of Preventive Medicine and Chairman of the\n\n24\n\nPERRIN H. LONG, M.D.\n\nDr. Perrin H. Long served as Professor of Preventive Medicine, School of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University. He was the first Director of the Commission on Meningococcal Meningitis, serving from March 1941 to August 1942 before joining the Army Medical Corps as a Colonel for service as a medical consultant to the Chief Surgeon of the Mediterranean Theater. He made major contributions to the early study of sulfonamides, the first effective antibacterial agents.\n\n25\n\nJOHN J. PHAIR, M.D., M.P.H.\n\nDr. John J. Phair served as Associate in Epidemiology, School of Hygiene and Public Health, The Johns Hopkins University. He was a charter member of the Commission on Meningitis, succeeded Dr. Perrin Long as its Director in August 1942, and served in this capacity until April 1946. He contributed to developing new knowledge of meningococcal, streptococcal, and respiratory tract diseases.\n\n26\n\nDepartment at SUNY Downstate, before retiring in 1961. He died in 1965. Dr. Phair left Johns Hopkins in 1946 to join the faculty of the School Medicine of the University of Louisville before becoming chairman of the advisory committee to the Commissioner of Health of the City of Cincinnati and then Commissioner. He died in 1970. Dr. Schoenbach became Professor of Medicine at College of Medicine, SUNY-New York City and Director of Medical Services at Maimonides Hospital. He died of coronary thrombosis in 1952. Dr. Smith became a member of CARD while also serving as a member of the AFEB. The date of his death and that of Dr. Miller are recorded in earlier sections. After a distinguished career as chairman of the Department of Medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, Dr. Wood returned to Johns Hopkins as Vice President for Medical Affairs, a position he held for 3 years before returning to research as Professor of Microbiology; he died of myocardial infarction in 1971. Dr. Rantz continued his studies of hemolytic streptococci, but he too died of a heart attack at age 53 in 1965.\n\nWhen CARD assumed responsibility for meningococcal meningitis, Dr. Feldman, Professor of Preventive Medicine, SUNY, Upstate Medical Center-Syracuse, was asked to head its Committee on Meningococcal Infections. He was well-qualified to do so. He (with Drs. Dowling and Sweet) was among the first to confirm, in1942, the effectiveness of sulfadiazine in the treatment of meningococcal meningitis, reported the previous year by Drs. Dingle and Thomas (with Morton).When he entered military service in October 1942, Dr. Feldman was assigned to the Fourth Service Command Laboratory located at Fort McPherson, Georgia, a reference center that served more than 100 Army hospital laboratories. Meningococcal infections were prevalent from Florida to North Carolina, from the Atlantic to the Mississippi. Feldman developed methods for the identification of strains, for testing their sensitivity to sulfadiazine and participated in carrier surveys and field trials to evaluate sulfadiazine as a prophylactic agent. After the war, his laboratory at SUNY-Syracuse became a national and international reference center for meningococci, tracking the increasing resistance of strains to sulfadiazine and the eventual ineffectiveness of that drug for treatment or prophylaxis. Other members of the committee included, at various times, Drs. Denny, Dingle, Eickhoff, Finland, and Jordan of CARD, Malcolm S. Artenstein, WRAIR, Captain James Kingston, USN, John Y. Bennett, CDC, and Richard Roberts, Commission on Streptococcal Infections.\n\nAlthough penicillin became available for treatment, the inability to eliminate the carrier state heightened the consternation and frustration that accompanied any outbreak of meningitis. At such times, largely for reassurance and public relations, members of the Committee on Meningococcal Infections were asked to visit bases experiencing epidemics. One such visit was made to Fort Ord, California, in September 1964 by Drs. Feldman, Austrian, Eickhoff, Finland, and Jordan with Dr. Gold representing Dingle, along with Drs. Ross L. Gauld, WRAIR, and Arthur W. Frisch, University of Oregon.\n\nThe incidence of meningococcal meningitis in California had shown a gradual increase since 1959, the case rate rising from 1.4 per 100,000 in 1959 to 3.0 in 1964. The build-up of cases at Fort Ord was as follows: 2 in 1960, 6 in 1961, 38 in 1962, 64 in 1963, and 108 in 1964. The first fatalities occurred in 1963, and it was in this year that Dr. Feldman was called to visit San Diego Naval Training Station to consult about the occurrence of meningitis. The call came while he was attending a meeting of the American Epidemiological Society in Washington. With the encouragement of Dr. Jordan, CARD Director, and the assistance of the AFEB Office, Dr. Feldman promptly headed west with little more than his toothbrush. He had a little more time to prepare for the visit to Fort Ord the next year.\n\nAs expected, most cases of meningitis at Fort Ord occurred in basic trainees in the first 8 weeks of training. No meningitis was noted in cadre men who were instructors and had daily contact with trainees or in physicians and nurses. A survey of Monterey County in which Fort Ord is located revealed only one case of meningococcal meningitis in the civilian population in January through September, 1964. This was the only case in that county in 1964,whereas 89 cases occurred in military personnel and 10 among civilian dependents. The carrier rate in new inductees was the same (20%) as in University of California students and was believed to reflect the current carrier rate in the male civilian population of California in ages 17 to 24. All of the strains of Neisseria meningitides were either serotype group B or C, with 90% being group B.\n\n27\n\nThe occurrence of cases on the base had attracted growing media attention, with frequent bulletins on television and scare headlines in the press. After the Committee had assessed the situation and confirmed that meningococci were widely disseminated throughout the civilian population, Dr. Feldman appeared on television to point out that the safest place for a civilian in California to reside was in the vicinity of Fort Ord and that it was doubtful that military personnel posed any greater hazard to the civilian population than the hazard encountered by civilians in their daily exposure to civilian carriers. The public, press, and politicians were not convinced, and an episode the following month forced the closure of the base.\n\nA basic trainee spent a day on leave with his fiancee. After his return to the base, she developed fulminant meningococcal meningitis caused by a group B organism and died. He remained well; a culture of his throat yielded a group B meningococcus. Not until after the assumed connection between the soldier and his girl had increased public anxiety further was it shown that the meningococci were probably different strains. The military was forced to suspend the intake of new basic combat trainees and Army Reserve personnel in support of a governor pressured and harassed by a frightened electorate.\n\nIn December 1964, the Board adopted the following recommendation:\n\nThat, in view of the epidemiological behavior of meningococcal infections with cyclic recurrences of epidemics at approximately 10-year intervals, thought and planning be given now for studies to be carried out, especially at military posts, approximately 8 to 10 years from now.\n\nFortunately, group C meningococcal vaccine became available before this time(1972), just before CARD and its Committee on Meningococcal Infections were terminated.\n\nPneumonia\n\nThe Commission on Pneumonia was listed third among the first seven commissions formed by the Board at its first meeting on 6 February 1941. Its first meeting took place in May 1941, a month before the memorandum that stated the investigations required by The Surgeon General of the then eight commissions listed it fifth, with the shortest of charges:\n\nThe Commission on Pneumonia will study the causes, prevalence, treatment and control of pneumonia. It will study epidemics in certain localities and will carry on work concerning the types of pneumonia caused by all the various kinds of germs and also the nonbacterial pneumonias.\n\nThe fact that the Commission on Cross Infections now had been added as the eighth commission was a result of the program of interim and field investigations drafted by the Commission on Pneumonia in May and submitted to the Board in June. The program, as outlined then, was divided into the following sections: prophylaxis by nonspecific measures, therapy of pneumonia and its complications, and recommendations for field investigations. It was realized at the outset that the personnel and facilities available to the Commission could not possibly include all these activities. A recommendation was made that the question of air sterilization by ultraviolet irradiation and germicidal aerosols should become the province of a special commission to be composed of one member from each of the commissions already set up, because the sterilization of air was a problem common to all. As previously noted, the AFEB agreed.\n\nThe members in attendance at the organizational meeting were the Director, Dr. MacLeod (Professor of Bacteriology, New York University College of Medicine; Dr. Abernethy, Associate Professor of Medicine, George Washington University School of Medicine; Michael Heidelberger, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Biochemistry, College of Physician and Surgeons, Columbia University; Dr. Edward S.\n\n28\n\nHARRY A. FELDMAN, M.D.\n\nDr. Harry A. Feldman served as Professor of Preventive Medicine, State University of New York at Syracuse. He served the CARD in many ways, especially as Chairman of the Committee on Meningococcal Infections, and by providing a university base for the Laboratory on Housing and Illness when Sampson Air Force Base was closed. Highly respected for his extensive knowledge of infectious diseases, he was much admired for his willingness to assist in the investigations of outbreaks at military bases. One of the first to demonstrate that some meningococcal strains had become resistant to sulfadiazine, he used his laboratory to test isolates sent to him from throughout the world.\n\n29\n\nPress Accounts of 1964 Meningitis Outbreak.\n\nNewspaper headlines reflect the public concern and subsequent political pressure occasioned by an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis at Fort Ord, California, in 1964. Panel 2 reproduces an account of a interview with Dr. Harry A. Feldman, Chairman of the CARD Committee on Meningococcal Infections ,who visited the base with other members of the committee. Feldman also appeared on local television. His reassurances were to no avail; the Governor forced suspension of recruit training.\n\n30\n\nRogers, Assistant Commissioner for Medical Administration, New York State Health Department; Dr. William S. Tillett, Professor of Medicine, New York University College of Medicine and a member of the Commission on Hemolytic Streptococcal Infections; and Dr. Wood, Associate, Department of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins Medical School and, later, Professor of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, already a member of the Commission on Meningococcal Meningitis. The records note that Drs. Dochez and Oswald T. Avery represented the AFEB at this first meeting. Original members not in attendance were Dr. Joseph F. Sadusk, Instructor in Medicine at Yale, and Dr. James Ruegsegger, Department of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, who also served briefly as a member of CARD before leaving both commissions to join the Navy Medical Corps. Dr. Sadusk also resigned to join the Army Medical Corps.\n\nIn subsequent years, four other members were added: Drs. Jacob Furth, Associate Professor of Pathology, Cornell University Medical College, Ithaca, New York; Clayton G. Loosli, Assistant Professor of Medicine, University of Chicago, who was commissioned a Captain in the Army Medical Corps; Wheelan D. Sutliff, Acting Director, Bureau of Laboratories, New York City Department of Health; and, in 1941, Paul B. Beeson, Assistant Professor of Medicine, Emory University Medical School, Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nThe CARD participated in its first field study in October 1941. Beginning in the summer of that year, a large number of cases of primary atypical pneumonia had been occurring at Camp Claiborne. Colonel Lucius Wright, Commanding Officer of the Station Hospital, was aware early of the nature of the disease, because he had previous clinical experience in Hawaii with a similar disease. A survey of the epidemic at Camp Claiborne was made in October by Drs. Dochez of the Army Epidemiological Board, Yale Kneeland, Jr. of the Influenza Commission, and MacLeod of the CARD. After this survey, a recommendation was made that a special commission be sent to Camp Claiborne to investigate the clinical and laboratory aspects of this disease. As detailed in the section on CARD, the commission for the study of atypical pneumonia at Camp Claiborne was under the directorship of Dr. Dingle of the Influenza Commission, assisted by Drs. Abernethy, Ruegsegger, and Wood of the Pneumonia Commission and others. Studies of a comprehensive nature were carried out through the winter and spring of 1942, when the group of investigators became the nucleus of CARD. Drs. Abernethy and Ruegsegger remained with the field staff of that CARD.\n\nDr. MacLeod`s final report for the Commission on Pneumonia noted\n\nthat prior to the original survey at Camp Claiborne, only a very small number of cases of atypical pneumonia were reported from Army installations in the United States. Based on the cases previously observed in civilian hospitals and the original survey at Camp Claiborne in October 1941, an official statement was prepared on the subject of primary atypical pneumonia by the Pneumonia Commission and issued by the Surgeon General`s Office early in 1942. Following this description and despite the cumbersome name of primary atypical pneumonia, etiology unknown, the number of reported cases of the disease took a remarkable upswing, and throughout the whole period of the war, the incidence of atypical pneumonia far exceeded pneumonia caused by all other agents combined. It was apparent that the vast majority of cases had gone unrecognized until this clinical description was circulated and opportunity afforded to use the term as a specific diagnosis.\n\nThe proposed budget of the Pneumonia Commission for 1943-1944 was $27,380.The actual budget recorded for 1945 was $27,100. This funded a $19,800 contract with New York University for Dr. MacLeod, and two subcontracts, one with Cornell University Medical College ($3,900) and one with Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons ($3,400). The latter was for the \"Work of Dr. Michael Heidelberger on the polysaccharides of pneumococci, particularly in connection with preparation and use of these polysaccharides in immunization against pneumonia.\" This modest investment yielded a great dividend.\n\nThe major contribution of the Commission on Pneumonia during its 4.5 year life was the development of an effective vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia in young adults. At the outset, as Dr. MacLeod reported, \"the Commission felt that it could fill an important need by athor-\n\n31\n\nCOLIN M. MACLEOD, M.D.\n\nDr. Colin N. MacLeod served as Professor of Bacteriology, New York University College of Medicine. He was the first and only Director of the Commission on Pneumonia, May 1941 to December 1945, and subsequently served as President of the AFEB from 1947 to 1955. He used his administrative skills and scientific knowledge to champion the AFEB and its commissions, and to strengthen the effectiveness of this consultant system. At the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, he teamed with Drs. Oswald T. Avery and Maclyn McCarty to demonstrate the genetic transformation of inheritable traits in pneumococci, the first demonstration that DNA was linked to genes. As Commission Director, he encouraged Dr. Michael Heidelberger`s research on pneumococcal polysaccharides, and had the satisfaction of conducting the first study to show that a multivalent polysaccharide vaccine would prevent pneumococcal pneumonia.\n\n32\n\nough analysis of immunization with specific capsular polysaccharides of pneumococcus.\" A survey of previously recorded epidemics of pneumonia, both in the United States and abroad, showed that in all instances, types 1, 2, or 5 had been responsible. For this reason, it was proposed that attention be devoted specifically to these types and that the immunologic response of immunized subjects be assayed by quantitative methods. It was considered important to have on hand large amounts of the purified polysaccharides of these three types. Accordingly, in the event that immunization on a wide scale might be deemed necessary in case of an epidemic,100 g of each were obtained commercially, the preparation being controlled by Dr. Heidelberger.\n\nThe opportunity to test a multivalent pneumococcal vaccine containing polysaccharides for these three serotypes, and in addition, type 7, was found at the Army Air Base in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Lieutenant Richard G. Hodges, MC, had been assigned to Sioux Falls as epidemiologist in the summer of 1943,and he remained there for the next 2 years. The detailed epidemiological analyses of respiratory infections that he made in collaboration with the Pneumonia Commission contributed greatly to knowledge of pneumococcal pneumonia and its relation to other respiratory diseases. These analyses and the results of the pioneering vaccine trial are summarized in the section on scientific contributions. The Commission on Pneumonia was terminated in December 1945.\n\nAfter the war, Dr. MacLeod served the AFEB as a member and President from his academic base at New York University and later from other positions as follows: Professor of Research Medicine, University of Pennsylvania; Professor of Medicine, New York University; Deputy Director of the Office of Science and Technology of the White House; Vice President for Medical Affairs of the Commonwealth Fund; and President of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. A strong supporter of international health research, he died suddenly in London in1972 while on his way to visit the Southeast Asian Treaty Organization Cholera Research Laboratory in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The subsequent histories of Drs. Abernethy, Hodges, Loosli, and Wood have been recorded in earlier sections.\n\nDr. Beeson became Professor of Medicine and Chairman of the department at Emory University Medical School, moving to the comparable position at Yale in1952. From 1965 to 1974, he served as Nuffield Professor of Clinical Medicine at Oxford University before returning to the United States as Professor of Medicine at the University of Washington. Dr. Tillett continued as Professor of Medicine at New York University and Director of the Third Medical Division at Bellevue Hospital until becoming Professor Emeritus in 1958. He died in 1974.\n\nDr. Furth rose to Professor of Pathology at Cornell in 1945, leaving in 1949to become Chief of the Pathology and Physiology Section of the Biology Division of the Atomic Energy Commission, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee. He then held sequential appointments as Associate Director of Research, Children`s Cancer Research Foundation, Harvard Medical School; Director of Experimental Pathology, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, New York; and Professor of Pathology, Columbia University, becoming Professor Emeritus there in 1967.\n\nDr. Heidelberger advanced to Professor of Biochemistry at Columbia University`s College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1945 and to Professor of Immunochemistry there in 1948. Although he became Emeritus in 1956, he remained active in the field of polysaccharide immunochemistry, becoming the recipient of numerous awards and medals for his contributions before celebrating his 100thbirthday in 1988. Often referred to as the \"father of modern immunology,\" he died of a stroke on 25 June 1991. Dr. Rogers became Professor of Public Health and Medical Administration, School of Public Health, University of California at Berkeley in 1946, also serving as Dean of the school until 1951. He became Professor Emeritus in 1971 and died shortly thereafter.\n\nDr. Sadusk served as Assistant, then Associate Clinical Professor of Medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine for 13 years; Professor of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, George Washington University School of Medicine 1962 to 1966, during which time he was Medical Director of the Food and Drug Administration; and Professor and Associate Dean for Community Medicine at The Johns Hopkins University, 1966 to 1967. He then served as Group Vice President for Medical and Scientific Affairs for Parke-Davis& Co. from 1967 to 1972 and Senior Vice President and Director of Medical and Scientific Affairs for Warner-Lambert Co. He died in 1978.\n\n33\n\nDr. Sutliff left the New York City Health Department to become chief of the Infectious Diseases Section of the Veterans Administration Hospital in Memphis and Professor of Medicine at the College of Medicine of the University of Tennessee. He, became Professor Emeritus in 1971. He died in 1983.\n\nSCIENTIFIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\nRespiratory Diseases\n\nIn 1942, the bacteriology laboratory was able to assist the clinician in the diagnosis of infections caused by meningococci, pneumococci, and streptococci. The virology laboratory could assist in the diagnosis of influenza, but that was all. Except for influenza, attempts to infect the chick embryo and other animals, including the mongoose, with secretions from persons with common colds or more severe nonbacterial respiratory diseases were unsuccessful. However, these nonbacterial, presumed viral, diseases were causing most of the hospital admissions and sick cell visits. Of necessity, clinical descriptions and epidemiological patterns were developed to separate cases into clinical syndromes that might indicate specific etiologies.\n\nThis was not easy. The first CARD annual report for 1942 and 1943 reflected the frustration experienced at Fort Bragg:\n\nData which have been collected indicate that, in the differential description of respiratory disease of supposedly different etiology, a summation of symptoms and signs present at any time during the illness is inadequate. By the time of recovery, most patients with a respiratory disease have presented such a variety of signs and symptoms that their mere enumeration does little to aid in classification.\n\nNevertheless, an attempt was made to separate cases into clinical syndromes that might indicate specific etiologies. Although no sharp clinical distinctions on the basis of symptoms, physical findings, laboratory results, or the clinical course of the diseases had been observed, it was possible to separate patients into three groups, namely, primary atypical pneumonia, exudative pharyngitis, and acute respiratory disease. However, the epidemiological studies in the first year failed to show any relationship between cases or to elucidate any factors of importance in the spread of these diseases.\n\nFor subsequent special studies, the investigators developed the following classifications.\n\n1. Acute undifferentiated diseases (ARD): This category [also termed acute respiratory disease (ARD) of recruits] included acute illnesses, usually febrile, with respiratory symptoms or generalized constitutional symptoms, or both, ordinarily lasting fewer than 2 weeks. Patients having exudative tonsillitis or pharyngitis, specific contagious diseases, antibody responses to influenza viruses A or B or to streptolysin O, or pulmonary infiltration demonstrable radiographically were excluded from this classification.\n\n2. Non streptococcal exudative tonsillitis or pharyngitis: This diagnostic category included patients with respiratory illnesses characterized by exudative lesions on the tonsils, palate, or oropharynx without either b-hemolytic streptococci or an increase in titer of antistreptolys in antibodies during convalescence.\n\n3. Primary atypical pneumonia: This diagnosis indicated a respiratory illness accompanied by roentgenographic evidence of pulmonary infiltration but not by clinical and laboratory evidence of bacterial pneumonia, bronchiectasis, or other causes of pulmonary consolidation.\n\n4. Hemolytic streptococcal infection: This diagnosis was made only when the illness was clinically compatible with such infections and, in addition, when b-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from the throat and a significant rise in antistreptolys in titer was demonstrable during convalescence.\n\n34\n\n5. Other illnesses: A small number of patients admitted with tentative diagnoses of respiratory disease proved to be suffering from other types of illness, such as immunization reactions, contagious exanthemas, meningococcal infection, or acute or chronic allergic disease. Such cases were excluded from further consideration.\n\nThe above is from a retrospective review of the CARD studies at Fort Bragg prepared 25 years later by Drs. Dingle and Langmuir. This was published first in the American Review of Respiratory Disease and then as a monograph with a foreword by Dr. MacLeod in which he stated \"because of the meticulous epidemiologic studies, enough was learned about the behavior and natural history of these diseases so that when putative etiologic agents were isolated during the next dozen years one could move quickly and confidently to test their causative role.\"\n\nThere is no better background for consideration of these etiologic agents and what has since been learned about the diseases they cause than the \"synoptic view\" of the Commissions work prepared by Drs. Dingle and Langmuir:\n\nLeads as to possible etiologic entities were sought from the clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory observations, separately and collectively. Thus, the segregation of ARD as a possible entity was made primarily on the basis of the epidemiologic data supported, of course, by clinical and laboratory observations, whereas delineation of primary atypical pneumonia and non-streptococcal exudative tonsillitis and pharyngitis came principally from the clinical and laboratory data. Much effort was devoted to attempts to isolate agents from materials obtained from representative cases in these diagnostic categories, to induce illness or identifiable lesions in a variety of laboratory animals, and to obtain serologic indications of possible infectious agents. These attempts were unsuccessful because either nothing unusual was found or the results could be duplicated with what were thought to be appropriate control materials.\n\nThe decision was therefore made to attempt to transmit some of these types of respiratory disease to humans, and volunteers were enlisted for this purpose. The results may be summarized as follows: (1) Primary atypical pneumonia, together with minor illness without radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltration could be transmitted to volunteers using filtered bacteria-free secretions of the respiratory tract of patients having the naturally occurring disease and could be transmitted in second passage. (2) ARD could be similarly transmitted, and the volunteers were immune to a second challenge with the same inoculum. (3) Illnesses characteristic of the common cold could likewise be transmitted. (4) Volunteers who had experimentally induced ARD or common colds, or both, were not immune to primary atypical pneumonia. The clinical characteristics and incubation periods of the induced illnesses were in general consistent with what was known about the corresponding naturally occurring illnesses. No presumptive or definitive causative agents were isolated in the laboratory from any of the specimens obtained from either the donors or recipients of the in ocula in these studies.\n\nDrs. Dingle and Langmuir noted that it was then possible to make some inferences and interpretations and to draw certain conclusions, as follows:\n\n1. An acute respiratory disease (ARD) was the predominant respiratory infection at military training posts, and affected recruits almost exclusively. Clinically, it was an acute, febrile or \"grippe-like\" infection resembling influenza, from which it was indistinguishable, at least in the individual patient. It was not a \"coryzal\" disease.\n\nEpidemiologically, it had a distinct pattern of behavior. Like most other respiratory diseases, its prevalence was higher in the winter than in the summer. The level of incidence, however, depended on the time and rate of influx of recruits into the training center. Those units of men inducted in summer months usually did not experience outbreaks of the disease until fall, and the outbreaks were rather prolonged and less abrupt, although the total number of men affected was approximately the same as in acute outbreaks. Those units inducted in fall or winter usually experienced an outbreak within the first 4 to 5 weeks of training, following which both the individual men and the unit seemed to be immune. During such outbreaks, from one quarter to one third of the men required hospitalization. A high turnover rate of recruits resulted in high prevalence of the disease. Thus, ARD seemed to behave as an epidemiology entity.\n\n35\n\nNo then known and identifiable bacteria, viruses, fungi, or rickettsiae could be associated etiologically with the disease, nor could any new agent be isolated and shown to play a causative role. The infection could, however, be transmitted to volunteers by inoculation of filtered, bacteria-free secretions of the respiratory tract from a typical patient with the naturally occurring disease. The incubation period ranged from three to nine days with a median of five to six days. The resultant illnesses were similar to the \"spontaneously occurring` infection. After recovery the volunteers were immune to challenge with the same inoculum. No cross immunity could be demonstrated between ARD and the common cold or primary atypical pneumonia as transmitted by inocula from the donors selected as having illnesses characteristic of these infections.\n\nThe conclusion was thus reached that the cause of ARD was most probably a virus or one or more of a closely related group of viruses.\n\n2. Epidemic influenza A had an epidemiologic pattern that was distinctly different from ARD in that it affected both seasoned men and recruits simultaneously and to an almost equal extent.\n\n3. Although the incidence of primary atypical pneumonia, which by definition required radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltration for diagnosis, roughly paralleled that of ARD in a ratio of approximately 1 to 10, the relationship was not seasonally constant. Cold hemagglutinins developed in only about one-third of the patients during convalescence. In volunteer studies, ARD did not appear to confer immunity to primary atypical pneumonia. These findings suggested that some, but by no means all, of the cases diagnosed as primary atypical pneumonia could have been caused by the agent or agents responsible for ARD.\n\n4. The occurrence of exudative tonsillitis and pharyngitis, not attributable to infection with group A b-hemolytic streptococci, was infrequent and in general correlated more closely with the incidence of ARD than with any other recognizable factors.\n\n5. The occurrence of minor respiratory illness and symptoms among men on duty, as determined by weekly platoon surveys, at times correlated with hospital admissions for acute respiratory disease, but at other times, particularly in the fall, showed a definite divergence and suggested different etiologies.\n\n6. The epidemiologic behavior of other infections and entities, such as group A b-hemolytic streptococcal infections, bacterial pneumonia, and rubella, was typical of those diseases and did not appear to be dependent on the occurrence of the acute respiratory diseases such as ARD.\n\nSimilar diagnostic limitations persisted when CARD investigators transferred their studies from the military population at Fort Bragg to a civilian population in the \"Heights\" suburbs of Cleveland, within a few miles of their laboratories at Western Reserve University. The study began in July 1947, with the recruitment of five families, all with children, to test the feasibility of data and specimen collection procedures. In addition to assessing the commitment of the parents, particularly the record-keeping mothers, to a long-term study, this meant enlisting the cooperation of the children in welcoming visits to their every illness by physicians and weekly visits by a field nurse. To this end, Dr. Rammelkamp sometimes arrived with a guinea pig in his pocket or with a number of white mice, and, at least once, with a goat(in his pocket!). The staff eventually recruited 86 middle-class families, with443 individuals, to participate in the Cleveland Family Study.\n\nAs at Fort Bragg, this longitudinal study of the occurrence of illness in families with young children was largely descriptive. Apart from influenza, few respiratory viruses could be isolated or used for serologic studies until adenoviruses were isolated in the mid-1950s to be followed by respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza viruses. However, by this time, the10-year study was nearly over. As a consequence, the investigators used a term -\"common respiratory diseases\" - previously used at Fort Bragg to classify respiratory admission based on weekly reports prepared by the hospital registrar. In the Cleveland Family Study, this designation included all nonbacterial illness except influenza, nonstreptococcal exudative tonsillitis and pharyngitis, and primary atypical pneumonia, these three accounting for only approximately2.5% of total illnesses.\n\nCommon respiratory diseases included the common cold, rhinitis, bronchitis, and other acute respiratory illnesses of undifferentiated type. This group, now known to be caused by multiple viral agents, was responsible for 95% of all illnesses, of which the common cold accounted for approximately 60%, or\n\n36\n\nabout 40% of all illnesses. An average of slightly over six common respiratory illnesses occurred per person-year. Incidence rates for children increased until the age of 3 years and then decreased progressively. In the absence of serologic studies, the decline appeared to be related more to the aging process than to the development of active immunity. Among children, males had higher incidence rates than females, but the reverse was true for adults. The highest attack rates for respiratory disease were found in young schoolchildren. Preschool children with siblings who attended school had consistently higher attack rates than did comparable children without school siblings, presumably because of increased exposure. In general, the larger the family, the greater the individual and family attack rates for common respiratory illnesses. No syndrome comparable to ARD in military recruits was observed, although cases of nonbacterial pharyngitis, some with exudate, that were seen during an epidemic in July and August 1954, were related to the then recently described type 3 adenovirus.\n\nARD?Adenoviruses\n\nAcute respiratory disease of recruits (ARD), a major cause of morbidity in all military training camps, during and after World War II, and as defined clinically and epidemiologically at Fort Bragg, is a specific etiologic entity caused by several adenovirus types. The first adenovirus associated with ARD was isolated by WRAIR investigators Drs. Maurice R. Hilleman and J. H. Werner from cases that occurred during an influenza-like epidemic at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, during the winter of 1952 and 1953. One of the five strains, RI-67, isolated from the pharynx of a patient with the clinical diagnosis of primary atypical pneumonia, was used to demonstrate rises in neutralizing antibodies in the majority of patients studied, most of whom did not have pulmonary infiltration. This finding confirmed the prior observation at Fort Bragg that the percentage (10% to 25%) of patients with infiltrates, and therefore labeled atypical pneumonia, paralleled the incidence of ARD.\n\nIn the same year, investigators at the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases of the National Microbiological Institute, NIH, reported the isolation of three immunologically distinct agents from human adenoid tissue undergoing degeneration in tissue culture. They were termed adenoid-degenerating (AD)agents, becoming types 1, 2, and 3, with RI-67 becoming type 4. By the following December, six types had been observed, and the name was changed to adenoidal-pharyngeal-conjunctiva) (APC) agents to reflect the clinical manifestations of cases caused by type 3 that were seen in northern Virginia in association with swimming pools. The adenovirus name for the group was adopted in 1956.\n\nBecause sera collected from the donors of respiratory secretions and the volunteers who received them in the human transmission experiments in 1945 had been stored in Cleveland, it was possible to titer them for neutralizing antibody to the RI-67 virus (type 4). Two donors, one diagnosed ARD and one diagnosed bronchitis resembling atypical pneumonia, developed antibody rises. A donor classified as primary atypical pneumonia and two classified as common colds did not. Of recipients of ARD secretion, 20 of 24 developed antibody rises; 40 recipients who received either atypical pneumonia or common cold secretions did not. Tests with these and other sera that used the AD agents(types 1, 2, and 3) showed that they were not associated with ARD. Many subsequent studies have established type 4 adenovirus as a major cause of ARD. Curiously, type 4 infections are rare in civilian populations, and a search for such infections among young men in college or at the U.S. Military and Naval Academies found none.\n\nOver 30 adenovirus serotypes are now known, most of the higher types being inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract. The most prevalent types among military groups have been types 4, 7, 14, and 21 and, to a lesser extent, type 3. Types 4 and 7 are the predominant types in the United States; types 14 and 21 are prevalent in Europe. In civilian populations, most children become infected with types 1, 2, and 5 early in life. Type 3, as noted, may produce epidemics of pharyngitis or conjunctivitis or both. Perhaps 50% of childhood adenovirus infections result in disease, with 2% to 7% of lower respiratory tract disease in young children seeking medical care being attributed to adenoviruses, particularly type 7. The frequency of these illnesses is not great enough to justify immunization of children. Immunization of recruits, however, is a major success story.\n\n37\n\nCHARLES RAMMELKAMP, M.D., AND WILLIAM S. JORDAN, JR., M.D.\n\nTo encourage continued participation in the Cleveland Family Study (eg, frequent examinations and throat swabbing) Drs. Charles Rammelkamp (left) and William Jordan entertain the four sons of Mrs. John Marshall while their most cooperative mother looks on.\n\n38\n\nAs a continuation of their studies of type 3 adenovirus, Dr. Huebner and his associates at NIH prepared a killed type 3 vaccine in 1955 that induced neutralizing antibody and prevented illness in volunteers challenged with homologous virus by the conjunctival route. That serum antibody may be protective was suggested in 1956 by studies at Sampson Air Force Base that showed that doses at 5 to 15 mL of gamma globulin prevented illness caused by adenovirus types 4 and 7. With the demonstration that these serotypes were mainly responsible for respiratory disease in military recruits, Dr. Hilleman and his associates at WRAIR developed a killed bivalent types 4 and 7 vaccine with the use of viruses adapted to growth in monkey kidney cell cultures. When evaluated at Fort Dix in 1956, a single dose effected a 98% reduction in hospitalized cases of ARD caused by these agents. Subsequent trials were less successful, apparently attributable to the variable potency of different production lots. Then the oncogenic simian virus 40 (SV40) was found to be present in the killed adenovirus vaccine as well as in viral seed stocks, including adenoviruses and Sabin live polio viruses. A second deterrent to vaccine development was the demonstration of the primary oncogenicity of certain adenovirus types for newborn hamsters, particularly types 12 and 18, and a series of scientific articles reporting the recovery of adenoviruses from a variety of human tumors. Furthermore, the discovery was made that a portion of the SV40 virus genome could become incorporated into the type 7 adenovirus virion, resulting in the formation of a hybrid virus that possessed the oncogenic potential of SV40 virus. In consequence, the Division of Biologics, NIH, acted in 1961 to prevent the distribution of vaccines containing viableSV40 virus and in 1964 to ban additional studies of live adenoviruses in humans until the problem of oncogenicity had been resolved.\n\nThe NIAID successor to the National Microbiological Institute contracted with Dr. Maurice Green of the Institute of Molecular Virology, St. Louis University School of Medicine, to search for evidence of oncogenic adenoviruses in a wide variety of human tumors. Green found none. NIAID scientists could not implicate adenoviruses in serologic surveys of human cancer patients for antibody to adenovirus T antigens. Next, adenovirus seeds were obtained free of SV40 and propagated in human cells. When Dr. Chanock and associates at NIAID capitalized on the observation that human adenoviruses exhibit a predilection for infection of the lower intestinal tract, the stage was set for the development of live oral vaccine.\n\nThe NIH investigators, using virus grown in human embryonic kidney cell culture, showed that type 4 or type 7 adenovirus could selectively infect the lower intestinal tract when virus was administered in enteric-coated capsules. Virus did not spread from the lower intestinal tract. Selective intestinal adenovirus infection stimulated moderately high levels of neutralizing antibody and was not associated with any signs or symptoms of illness. Because h"
