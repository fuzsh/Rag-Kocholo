        "text": "2024: Earth Scientist Naomi Oreskes's Commencement Address\n\nRenowned earth scientist Naomi Oreskes addressed Bard graduates on Saturday, May 25, 2024.\n\nText (unedited) of commencement address by earth scientist Naomi Oreskes\n\nPresident Botstein, academic colleagues, parents, friends, and most of all students, thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts with you on this important day.\n\nI’d like to start by extending my heartfelt congratulations to everyone here. And I mean everyone. To the graduates of the Bard class of 2024, of course. This is your day. But also to everyone here—parents, friends, professors, staff—who worked to make the promise of your college education into a reality. It takes a village to raise a child, and it takes a college or university to raise a graduate. Congratulations to all of you for a job well done.\n\nAnd, to my fellow honorary degree awardees, this is your day, too.\n\nThis is what in my tradition we call a “shehecheyanu moment:” a moment when we pause to appreciate the fact that we have come to a point in time, this place in the world, this moment of success and happiness. Shehecheyanu literally means “we are alive,” and moments like these are worth savoring and remembering. So, while I am not a comedian, I will try not to be boring, in the hope that you may remember some part of my comments.\n\nIn this moment of joy, I’d like to talk today about something slightly difficult: the problem of conflict and contradiction.\n\nWe all know—and to some degree understand in our hearts—that joy and sadness can reside in the same place, even at the same time. Today, you graduates are happy to be graduating, but probably sad to be leaving friends. You may be excited about what comes next, but also anxious. This sort of contradiction—the bittersweet quality of many of life’s milestones—is obvious. Less obvious is how we manage the conflict and contradictions in everyday life.\n\nAs we gather here today to celebrate your accomplishments, we gather against a backdrop of tremendous tension in our world, our country, and even in our academic communities. We feel divided in ways that most of us who are old enough to remember would say we have not felt for sixty years.\n\nWhat do we do with this contradiction? Is it fair to celebrate—to be joyous—when others are suffering? Many of us felt this way during COVIDcovid. I know I did. For me, COVIDcovid was an oddly precious time. With my husband in the next room, our adult daughter down the hall, my dog at my feet, and two cats that our daughter brought home from Tennessee, I loved working at home. It was a relief to travel less, to talk less, and to think and write more. Yet, my contentment sat alongside heartbreak: that my students were losing an important part of their college experiences. And that everywhere, people were struggling, suffering and dying.\n\nOr consider this. We are at Bard College, home of the Hannah Arendt Center, the place where Arendt found an intellectual home after the horrors of the Holocaust and devastating destruction of World War II. World War II destroyed tens of millions of lives, thousands of cities, and countless dreams. Arendt was one of the century’s great witnesses to this destruction, reified in the trial of the Nazi Adolf Eichmann. More cogently than almost any other thinker, she confronted the question of how evil comes to dwell in our midst. She coined the term “the banality of evil” to describe the ways in which extreme evil can insinuate itself into daily life and be perpetrated by people who in other respects seem ordinary. Evil—Arendt made us see—rarely announces itself. More often it creeps up upon us.\n\nYet, Arendt—one of the century’s most acute observers of Nazis—was the student and lover of the Nazi, Martin Heidegger. Martin Heidegger was a Nazi. He was a member of the Nazi party. His private notebooks contain numerous unequivocally anti-semitic comments. He subscribed to a belief in heroic violence. In the words of one recent commentator, Heidegger’s “outlook reflects a clear and deep-seated commitment to the worldview of Nazism.”\n\nYet, at the same time, Heidegger was a great philosopher, in fact one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. Many concepts that we take for granted today—and in particular, concepts that people who consider themselves to be progressives—have their origins at least in part in his work.\n\nMartin Heidegger was a great philosopher and a great fascist. That’s a hard thing to get your head around. We want our great thinkers also to be great people. We want ourt heroes to be entirely good, and our villains to be entirely bad. But often they are not. Good people sometimes do bad things. Bad people sometimes do good things. After all, Hitler was a vegetarian, something my students are almost always disturbed to learn. Nazi scientists were also pioneers in understanding and documenting the hazards of tobacco use.\n\nOr consider John Locke. A man who owned stock in slave trading companies, Locke justified the appropriation of Nnative American lands on the grounds that Nnative peoples who did not farm could not be said to own the land on which they lived. Property rights, he believed, arose from labor of a particular sort that was eligible to Europeans like himself. As the philosopher Charles Mills wrote, Locke’s social contract “could…be regarded as founded on an exclusionary intra-white ‘racial contract’ that denies equal moral, legal, and political standing to people of color.”\n\nPeople are contradictory. That is a fact as surely as the claim that the Earth is an oblate spheroid and that e=mc2. In fact, the foundations of modern physics rest on a contradiction: that light is neither a wave nor a particle, but in some way neither and both. Physics tells us that in certain circumstances, Schroedinger’s cat is both dead and alive.\n\nBard is proud of its status as a liberal arts college, and rightly so. But liberalism has its own well-known contradictions—or at least tensions—such as the oft-remarked tension between our cultivation of expert knowledge and our commitment to democratic decision-making.\n\nIt's an instinct for many of us to want to resolve contradictions. To conclude that Heidegger must be either a great thinker or a fascist—because how could he be both? To say that Locke, as a racist, cannot be an inspiration to us today. To insist that Schrodinger’s cat must be either alive or dead.\n\nKnowing that Heidegger was a Nazi, we could “cancel” him. We could decide that his ideas do not merit consideration. We could expunge him from our philosophy classes. But to do so would be to deny the course of history, to deny the impact his ideas have had, for better or worse. The same goes for John Locke. Locke’s ideas on governance and natural rights were so central to Thomas Jefferson and the framers of the U.S. Constitution, that we would be hard pressed to understand the creation of this country—again for better or for worse—without understanding Locke.\n\nSo what I’d like to suggest today is that not resolving contradiction is actually central to intellectual life, and the core mission of great colleges and universities like Bard.\n\nThe answer to many problems is indeed both/and, and many conflicts arise in part because we insist that there must be an answer. We succumb to the fallacy of the excluded middle: It’s either capitalism or communism. It’s either individual rights or the common good. It’s either censorship or free speech absolutism.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill is another “great” thinker whose legacy is mixed, but there is one point upon which I think he was absolutely right. To paraphrase just slightly: Mill said that in many conflicts, both sides are right in what they affirm and wrong in what they deny.\n\nIt seems to me that Mill’s idea is central to what we, as intellectual communities, need to keep front and center: the idea that it’s rare for any one thinker—or any one position in a debate—to be entirely right and the other entirely wrong. We all prioritize the aspects of a problem that seem most salient to us. Had we come from a different place or had different life experiences, we would very likely view the matter differently. And down the road, in a few years, or months or even a few weeks, we may view the matter differently still.\n\nThis is one of the central arguments for diversity: that people see things differently, based on their backgrounds and life experiences. This is the moral of the old fable of the blind men and the elephant, as well as of the great Kurosawa film, Raoshomon: that we all only see partially. And for this reason—because vision and perspective is always partial—as isolated individuals we never apprehend the whole truth. When we bring diverse perspectives together, it does not guarantee that we find the truth, but it does make us more likely to see and appreciate the whole.\n\nIf we think for a moment about the word—university—it’s immediately obvious that its root is the same as universal, and universe. While the universities of mediaeval Europe were not, of course, universal, they did seek to comprehensively cover the major areas of learning recognized at the time: the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy).\n\nToday, universities and liberal arts colleges cover far more ground than these seven subjects. At Bard, students are offered 35 different degree programs, as well as numerous interdivisional programs and concentrations. Why do we have so many different things for students to study? Why so many different programs and degrees?\n\nThe obvious answer is that, because the world is complicated and contradictory, we need to look at it from many angles. To meet people’s needs and solve the world’s problems, we need to embrace a wide range of disciplines, approaches, methodologies, and perspectives. All these different disciplines—most of which did not exist 1000 years ago—are a response to the recognition that we need many ways of thinking.\n\nAs members of a living and learning community, it is our job to explore ideas, and where necessary doing the hard work of explaining why certain claims are false, harmful, or otherwise problematic. It is our job not to suppress bad ideas, but to expose them as bad. And, especially in these times when it sometimes seems that everyone is yelling at each other, to find the capacity to listen, and, where appropriate, just be quiet.\n\nNot everything that can be said should be said. Civility, decency, and just plain kindness sometimes require us to hold our tongue. Sometimes the right answer in the face of a problem is not to do something, but just to stand there. To wait, to watch, to listen.\n\nWe’ve heard a lot in recent months about free speech. We’ve heard a lot less about listening. Indeed, we don’t even have an equivalent phrase. “Free listening” doesn’t even make syntactic sense. But what use is free speech if no one is listening?\n\nI’d like to close with the thought that in this difficult moment, a key role that we can play, at colleges and universities, is to find ways to create opportunities to listen, as well as to speak. And to watch as well as to act. Because one way to help to resolve contradictions—to find what is right in divergent views—is by listening. Really listening.\n\nThe world needs both speaking and listening. If no one spoke, there would be nothing to listen to. But if no one listens, then there isn’t much point in speaking.\n\nThank you for listening to me, and once again, congratulations to the class of 2024.\n\n2023: US Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock’s Commencement Address\n\nThe United States Senator from Georgia addressed Bard graduates on May 27, 2023.\n\nText (unedited) of commencement address by U.S. Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock of Georgia\n\nHello, Bard College! Blessings on all of you. How are we doing today?\n\nLet’s take a moment to give a big hand to all the incredible graduates here today!\n\nLet’s hear it for our graduates. Young leaders who have crossed the threshold and deserve our love and our recognition. Today is about you. This is your day.\n\nWhat a warm greeting from President Leon Botstein! Let’s give him a great big round of applause. Come on, the man has been here almost a half-century; give him a great big round of applause.\n\nThank you for all that you do to maintain the standards of excellence for which Bard is known.\n\nI want to recognize my friend, Jim Chambers, the President of the Board, as well as the Executive Vice President and Vice President for Academic Affairs, Jonathan Becker, for all the tireless work you do. To the entire leadership team, the faculty, and the staff.\n\nBut most of all, the graduates who have crossed this amazing threshold. And while we celebrate you, we know that you understand that you have not done this alone. We are grateful for the village: the mothers and the fathers, the grandmothers and the grandfathers, the aunts, uncles, sisters, brothers and neighbors—and so, let’s hear it for the whole village!\n\nDr. King said we are tied in a single garment of destiny, caught up in an inescapable network of mutuality. That whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. You have arrived, but you didn’t get here by yourself. We got here together.\n\nThe Reverend Doctor Samuel DeWitt Proctor, one of my late mentors, used to say that if you see a turtle on a tree stump, you know somebody put him there—he didn’t get there by himself.\n\nBut I’m especially grateful—and I do a few commencement addresses each year—but I’m especially grateful to be here at Bard College.\n\nI’m grateful because Bard College carries with it a deep sense of mission.\n\nThis is a community that carries with it the burden of Benjamin Elijah Mays, that great schoolmaster and president of Morehouse College when Martin Luther King, Jr. was a student there. He said I’m disturbed—in the language of that day—he said I’m disturbed about man. I’m disturbed about the human. I’m disturbed about the humankind, because he said, when we train a person’s head, we don’t have any guarantee that we train your heart. That there is no correlation between knowledge and goodness.\n\nAnd we are seeing in this very moment a kind of perverse genius at work that in many ways is waging an assault on our democracy. We need the spirit of Bard College throughout this nation, of faculty and the staff that understands that we must not only train the head, but we must tune the heart and ready the hands for service. That education ought to have a purpose. You ought to use your education to make a difference for the human race, particularly the most marginalized members of the human family. Thank you, Bard College, for your commitment to that mission.\n\nI’m grateful for those who share with me today in receiving the honorary degree. That each of you in your own way embody that hope and that commitment.\n\nSo graduates, today is an important milestone. You have crossed the river, but the ocean lies in front of you.\n\nAnd may you take with you the words of Howard Thurman, who said, “I'm tired of sailing my little boat far inside the harbor bar. I want to go out where the big ships float, out on the deep where the great ones are. Should my frail craft prove too slight for those waves that sweep the billows, I'd rather go down in the stirring fight than drowse to death by the sheltered shore.”\n\nWe send you not just into the world; we send you not just out of these academic halls. We send you into “the stirring fight.”\n\nIt is our hope that you will go into the world, and that with head and heart and ready hands, you will get yourself ready for service. The village has been preparing you. The village has been helping to build the boat. But as you set sail, as you leave this place, don’t forget about the people who helped to get you ready.\n\nThank God for your professors. Thank God for the faculty. But thank God also for the administrators and for those who attend to this place.\n\nYou have to thank the whole village. You have to thank the folks who prepared the grounds upon which you walk out into the world. And so we send you into the world with a great sense of hope because we know that’s what Bard College is all about. Head and hearts and hands, ready for service.\n\nIt was the scourge of fascism that descended on Europe in the 1930s that drove Bard to stand up and provide sanctuary to intellectuals fleeing the Nazis.\n\nAnd in the 1950s, Bard stood up again and took in Hungarian students who opposed their country’s oppressive, Stalinist government. This is who Bard College is.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Bard stood up again to provide safe refuge for fleeing students as the authoritarian regime in Belarus clamped down on academia and free thought. Recently, Bard has stood up and taken in refugees from Afghanistan and Ukraine.\n\nYou have remained true to your mission to be safe haven for those escaping tumult, to come learn in one of America’s shining institutions.\n\nAnd now, Class of 2023, the latest graduates from this great institution. There are among you classmates who had to literally cross oceans and flee terrorism and brutality. And yet they are here today, thriving and graduating and ready to make the world better.\n\nBut the truth is, all of you have had to overcome obstacles never before seen in our history. Your journey was interrupted by the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, learning in isolation from your peers—and in that isolation, you had to begin the journey of discovering what you wanted to become.\n\nAnd in the midst of dealing with COVID-19 we were struck as a nation with the latest iteration and expression of an age-old pandemic I call COVID 1619, as we woke up one day, and saw another Black man named George Floyd with his body beneath the knee of law enforcement—something to which I’ve dedicated my life fighting and addressing time and time again. What I love about this generation is that we saw a multi-racial, multi-faith, multi-generational coalition of conscience, mask up to protect themselves from one virus, COVID 19, and you went to the streets waging war against that age-old pandemic, COVID 1619, that showed up as slavery, and then showed up as Jim Crow segregation, and then showed up in America’s prison industrial complex, and you said we’re better than this.\n\nSo for those of you who expressed those concerns, I’m on your side. This is the work I was doing long before I came to the Senate. And that’s why I’m most proud of what Bard is doing in this moment as you deal with the Bard Prison Initiative.\n\nBecause as we stood up protesting what happened to George Floyd—but not only George Floyd, but Ahmaud Arbery down in Georgia, and Rayshard Brooks, whose eulogy I preached. And Renisha McBride. And the list goes on, and on, and on. What you understand is that we are dealing with not only physical death on the streets, but social death in our increasing, privatized carceral state.\n\nThe United States of America, four percent of the world’s population, warehouses twenty-five percent of the world’s prisoners. It is a scandal and a scar on the soul of our country. No other nation comes even close in both the number of people we incarcerate and the percentage of our population that we incarcerate. It’s a scandal and a scar on the soul of our nation that a greater percentage of the Black population is in prison in America today than was in South Africa during the era of apartheid. That’s a scandal and a scar on the soul of our nation.\n\nAnd so we have to stand up in this moment. We have to bear witness to freedom. And so I hope, graduates, that you will go out from this place and that you will stir up good trouble, that you will challenge the systems.\n\nFirst time I got arrested, first time—and to be clear I've only gotten arrested in acts of civil disobedience—but the first time I got arrested, I was a young seminary student not far from here, at Union Theological Seminary in New York City.\n\nAnd there was a young African immigrant named Amadou Diallo who was standing on the stoop of his own home. And he was shot multiple times by the so-called “elite unit” while reaching for his own wallet. And I was arrested as a young seminary student in the late 1990s, before you were born, many of you. So when I saw [them] standing up for George Floyd, I said, here we go again, addressing this age-old challenge—but don't you dare lose hope. Don't you dare give in to despair. Bard, in a real sense, has set up for you a blueprint for how we address this issue. This college could have said, well, we are an elite institution; we graduate people within the pristine halls of academia. But not only are they graduating people under this tent, they’re graduating people in prison right now.\n\nSo a few years ago, I decided that when asked to speak publicly, in any occasion, no matter what they asked me to talk about, before I left, you were going to hear something about America's prison industrial complex—the fact that the land of the free warehouses twenty-five percent of the world’s prisoners.\n\nAnd so my church decided a few years ago, that we were going to get engaged in this fight. So we managed through our moral witness to pull together the constituent parts of our local government. And we had an event at the church. It was [the] proudest moment in my ministry. Because it was a small way of addressing this issue. We were clearing people's records, people who had been indicted, some of them never convicted. People who could not get a job, could not get an apartment, because they had a record. One of the proudest moments in my ministry is when I walked into our sanctuary one day and saw a sea of people in front of me, and literally everybody in front of me had a record. But it occurred to me that that's true every Sunday morning. All of us have a record. In other words, each of us has something, some area of our lives that we're not proud of, and we don't want to be judged indefinitely by our worst moment. There's human promise and possibility in every human being.\n\nAnd so we got engaged in the work. And all I'm trying to say to you graduates, is I want you to find a place to get involved in the good fight. And I know as you sit here—perhaps 21, 22, 23 years old—you say, well, what should I do? What is it that the world needs? My answer again are the words of Howard Thurman: Ask not what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. In other words, I challenge you to find your passion. I challenge you to find that thing in the world that feels like such a deep moral contradiction that you cannot be silent. You have to express yourself; you have to stand up and try to make the world better. Find anything that you would do for free except that you have to pay the rent or the mortgage.\n\nAnd chase after it with all of your might. Pursue the good life. Find your life’s project. Jesus put it this way—you invited a preacher—Jesus said if you seek to save your life, you’ll lose it. But if you would lose your life, he said, for my safe, you'll find eternal life. In other words, the way to find yourself is to give yourself over to something bigger than yourself. And if your life’s project can be completed in your lifespan, I submit to you that is too small. You ought to find a life project that is bigger than your lifespan and seek to continue the important work.\n\nI'm a living witness that you can make a difference in the world, and you never know when, you never know how. Here I stand as the first Black United States Senator from the great state of Georgia. And while I am the first Black senator from the state of Georgia, don’t say it like Georgia is a lagging indicator. I'm only number eleven in the whole history of the country. But I grew up in public housing, one of twelve children; I'm number eleven. I had to stand up and celebrate those first-generation college students because I was you not long ago; first college graduate in my family. I grew up in public housing, now I serve in the Senate—only in America is my story possible.\n\nWe got work to do. The great thing about America is we always have a path to make America greater. And so my life is a testament to our grand democratic experiment, to people who stood up to keep our society reaching towards its highest ideals.\n\nI had a high school teacher who told me that service is the price you pay on space you occupy. Before that I had a mother and a father who poured a lot of love into me, and they nurtured me in the faith that sustained me, and they passed on to me a fierce work ethic. We were short on money, but we were long on faith.\n\nMy dad was a preacher and a junk man, literally. During the week he lifted old broken cars on the back of a rig that he built himself with no engineering degree, no formal training in physics; he’d load one car on top of another on the back of an old rig, and take it to the steel yard—and that’s how he took care of his family. But on Sunday morning, the man who lifted broken cars lifted broken people, and reminded them that there is a God who sees the people that other people have thrown away.\n\nMy mother grew up in Waycross, Georgia. You know where that is? It’s “way ‘cross” Georgia. She grew up picking somebody else’s cotton and somebody else’s tobacco. But because this is America, hands that used to pick somebody else’s tobacco and somebody else’s cotton, picked her youngest son to be a United States Senator. Anything is possible in this country.\n\nSo when I made my way into the halls of the Senate, I brought with me their story and my story. Yes, I've worked hard, but I wouldn't be here if someone hadn’t helped me along the way. You're not just looking at a graduate of Morehouse College. I'm an alum of Headstart. A good federal public program. I’m a graduate of Upward Bound, another good federal program that put me on a college campus as a high-school student so I could imagine myself there. And then it was Pell grants, and low-interest student loans, that made my journey possible. That’s why I keep pushing for student loan debt relief. I keep pushing for it because I don't believe that our children should have a mortgage before they have a mortgage. And if we would free them up, we free the American entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nSo that's all, graduates; that's all I really want to say. Make an impact. Leave a legacy.\n\nWhen you see me fighting for children, I'm trying to make an impact and leave a legacy. When you see me passing legislation that caps the cost of insulin, and other prescription drugs, know that I'm trying to leave a legacy and make an impact. Because I believe that health care is a human right.\n\nWhen you see me standing up for a woman's right to choose, know that I'm trying to make an impact and leave a legacy. Because I believe that a patient’s room is too cramped and narrow a space for a woman, her doctor and the United States government. That’s too many people in the room.\n\nAnd if we really want to make a difference for women, we ought to address the issue of maternal mortality; if you want to preserve life, address the fact that there are too many women dying trying to have babies in our country. And Black women are three to four times more likely to die.\n\nWhen you see me challenging my colleagues to do more to rescue us from the terrible scourge of gun violence, I’m trying to make an impact and leave a legacy. Because I do not buy the lie that mass shootings are the necessary cost of freedom. It’s a strange freedom that sends our children on lockdowns, every single day in this country.\n\nWhen you see me fighting for voting rights, know that I'm trying to make an impact and leave a legacy. Because I believe that democracy is the political enactment of a spiritual idea; that your vote is your voice, and your voice is your human dignity. That we’re all created in the Imago Dei, the image of God—if you aren't given to that type of language, put it this way, we all have value. And if we have value, we ought to have a voice. We ought to have a vote in the direction of our country and our destiny within it.\n\nAnd when you stand up, my beloved, you never know the difference that it will make. I didn't know that when I flipped the Senate, that I would be able to stand one day and confirm the first Black woman to the United States Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThe day we confirmed here, the chamber table was full. Everybody was there. I'm standing there with my colleague, Cory Booker. We were standing next to the chair of the presiding officer and the Vice President was sitting in the chair, because it was such a moment. The Vice President looked at me and Senator Booker and she said, you know, guys, this is quite a moment. I said yes. She said, you know what you ought to do? You ought to take this moment and write a letter to somebody who comes to mind in this moment. She made that suggestion to us the way the Black women in my life make suggestions. And then she handed each of us distinguished United States Senators a piece of paper. But it wasn’t just any sheet of paper, it was the letterhead of the Vice President of the United States of America.\n\nDidn’t take me long to know who I should write that letter to because the only thing I love more than being Georgia’s Senator and Ebenezer’s pastor is being Chloe and Caleb’s dad—my six-year-old daughter, and my four-year-old son. And I sat down and I wrote a letter to my daughter as I thought about a woman named Ketanji, who would serve on the Supreme Court. And I said Dear Chloe, today we confirmed to the United States Supreme Court Ketanji Brown Jackson. The long history of our nation she is the first Supreme Court Justice who looks like you, with hair like yours. And while we were confirming her a friend of mine, the Vice President, suggested that I write a letter. By the way, she's the first Vice President who looks like you, with hair like yours. I write this letter just to say that in America, you can be and you can become anything you set your head and your heart to do. Love, Dad. I was so moved that I couldn’t wait to get home. I called my daughter, who was then five years old, on FaceTime, and I read a letter to her. She’s five-years-old, she listened to the letter. She was not the least bit impressed. She said, can I go play now? She didn't understand the letter now, but she'll understand it later. But it occurred to me in the weeks after that, that in a real sense, the work I do as a legislator is a letter not only to my daughter, but to all of our children. But not only that, the work that you do as a citizen, the work that you graduates will do after this day, is a letter to the future generations.\n\nSo I want you to start his day writing a letter to the future. I want my letter to say that I stood up in this defining moment in America. I want my letter to say that I stood up against fascism. I want my letter to say that I stood up for women, that I stood up for members of the LGBTQ+ community. I want my letter to say that I stood up like somebody who understands that there's no such thing as equal rights for some, there must be equal rights for all.\n\nI want my letter to say that I used my gifts, and I used every opportunity to make a difference in America and to build a better world—and what Dr. King called the beloved community.\n\nNow it is your turn. Now is your time. All of us are standing on tiptoe to see just how great you shall become. God bless you. Keep the faith.\n\n2022: United States Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland’s Commencement Address\n\nThe United States Secretary of the Interior addressed Bard graduates on May 28, 2022.\n\nGood evening, President Botstein, faculty, staff, and the Class of 2022! I am honored to be with you and the people who love you on this beautiful afternoon for this important step on your life’s journey.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nI acknowledge that we are on the ancestral homelands of the Mohican and Iroquois Tribal Nations, who have stewarded these lands for millennia, and I thank the ancestors for giving me space here, and thus the profound opportunity to have this time with all of you.\n\nDu hino meh, Idz ah dyu ee dza, suwimi hanu.\n\nI am a member of the Pueblo of Laguna. I am who I am because of the people who raised me. My maternal grandparents were boarding school and assimilation survivors. I identify as a Pueblo woman, and my pronouns are she/her.\n\nYou should all be proud—I know that getting to today wasn’t easy, but you did it. You did it!\n\nYour Bard education will not only lead you into the next chapter of each of your lives, but I also believe that it has instilled in you the power to change the world for the good.\n\nWe should all believe in that possibility and always work to make the world a better place for everyone. An education, and specifically a college education, is a unique gift. None of us are born to be naturally afforded a higher education. It takes hard work and every support system to succeed in it, and along the way, you have recognized the value you bring to this endeavor.\n\nI don’t have to tell you that the college experience is about more than just gaining an education—it’s about the connections you make, the new ideas you share, and exposure to a new world beyond the one you were nurtured in by your parents and your communities.\n\nHere, you have had opportunities to think about our country and our world from the different perspectives of this beautifully diverse class of students.\n\nAs I look out over this sea of mortar boards, I think about the professors at my alma mater, who didn’t just teach me how to string complex sentences together or to analyze English literature, they also cared that I needed to get out of an apartment lease because it was an unsafe environment. They counseled me when I mourned my father’s death, and they never ceased to inspire me because of their combined decades of dedication to teaching and their commitment to a better world for all of us.\n\nHearing from people at Bard tells me that the community that has been cultivated here over the past four years is similar to what I experienced. You all are more than classmates—you’re each other’s problem solvers, support systems, and friends. You share the experience of getting through first year seminar together, learning Citizen Science, completing a strenuous Senior Project, and going to the Bard Farm stand on campus (and by the way, I will say I’m sad that not every college campus has a farm and a market to go with it).\n\nAll this, in the midst of a deadly pandemic that had early and terrifying consequences for New York State. The world will never be the same, but you all are prepared to take on new challenges and achieve tremendous success because of—not in spite of—the experiences you have had together. You and your classmates will be bonded by the collective experience of getting your degrees during the pandemic.\n\nThese are moments and circumstances that leave an indelible mark.\n\nHowever, it’s also the small things that tighten the bonds that you created here—searching for a shuttle that never seems to be on time, eating DTR sliders, and organizing trips to the “old gym” or “SMOG” for music. Eventually these connections will become your professional networks.\n\nMany of the people I went to college or law school with went on to become incredible lawyers, nonprofit leaders, advocates, organizers, and elected officials.\n\nWhen I was younger, I helped many of those pursuing public office to get elected, because I believe that leadership matters. Because representation matters. And it would take me another decade or so to recognize my own potential as a leader. Needless to say, we learn by doing.\n\nNow, this is the part of the speech, where I say that your college degree is just the beginning of yet another journey. The hard work is not over yet! Even though you have your degree in hand, your educational journey is, in some ways, beginning again.\n\nSome of you will or already have secured a place in graduate or professional school, or perhaps you are traveling, or steeping yourselves in the outdoors and nature for a while. Regardless of what you decide to do, I believe that your passion for fighting the good fight will still be viable whether in a few months or a few years, and that your Bard education is something that will get you there.\n\nIn 1978, on the day I graduated from high school, I had no college applications in the queue and not a thought about a career or a future—neither of my parents nor their parents graduated from college, and I had to figure that out on my own. I went from part time to full time at the local bakery where I had worked since I was 15, and I had early and very long hours... until one morning I looked in the mirror and asked myself if I would be doing this for the rest of my life. The following day, I called my sister to ask how to fill out a college application.\n\nI started my first semester at the University of New Mexico when I was 28 years old. I had 13 years of experience as a retail salesgirl and later as a cake decorator.\n\nFor the record, I can still decorate some pretty awesome cakes, but when I think about how far I’ve come, I also remember that at times I was doubtful about what I could actually accomplish. Though, I never gave up thinking that I could make a positive difference for people who often don’t have a voice. So, to you I say: trust your inner voice, know your strength, and follow your heart.\n\nIf you do those things, it will be nearly impossible to not live a fulfilled life through making a positive difference in the world.\n\nI know that your experience at Bard has allowed you to fine-tune your passions, develop critical thinking, and has empowered you to move forward with purpose. Part of that purpose and the privilege of a college education is the responsibility to open doors for others.\n\nWhen I won my election and became one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress alongside Sharice Davids, it was incredibly clear that people looked up to us and that we had the means to leave the ladder down for future leaders.\n\nLeaving the ladder down for those who follow you, and for the next class of students to climb is one of the most important things you can do.\n\nNow, I made plenty of mistakes before I set on the road to Capitol Hill. I was not perfect, I wasn’t groomed from a young age to go to college, run for Congress, or be a cabinet secretary. My work experiences, my work navigating life for my child and me, and my mistakes, good and bad, led me to my life’s purpose.\n\nNo one finds success alone.\n\nWe all have family and community who have said a kind word, given us $20 for our birthday, and even the smallest tokens of support have helped you all get to this point.\n\nI’m here today, a 35th generation New Mexican, not because I have done anything on my own, but because centuries ago, my ancestors worked hard, fought drought and famine, reclaimed their land, and had the intelligence and foresight to protect our culture and traditions against all odds.\n\nYou never know how one’s journey will inspire their future.\n\nMy father was a 30-year career Marine, who won the Silver Star Medal for saving the lives of six Marines in Vietnam. My mother was a Navy veteran who went on to spend 25 years as a federal employee working in Indian Education. As a child, my dad’s military career took us to military bases on the East Coast and throughout Southern California on the west. I went to 13 public schools before graduating from high school. I raised my child Somáh as a single mom, and there were many times when I had difficulty paying for rent and even basic necessities. In fact, because times were sometimes so hard, I am still paying off my student loans.\n\nAll of these experiences and especially the struggles, have made me who I am today.\n\nWe need more people in leadership positions across the board who understand the struggles that people face. We need leaders who understand persistence and know what it means to be fierce in the face of adversity.\n\nIt’s why representation matters. It’s why I’m so impressed by the work Bard does to ensure the doors of opportunity are open to a broad group of students who bring their whole selves to this institution–their experiences, perspectives, and struggles.\n\nThis is part of the big picture. It’s part of who you are and who you will become.\n\nTo the parents, family, friends, supporters and other members of the Bard community—we all know that any educational endeavor is a family affair. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank YOU for all that you do to support these amazing graduates. Let’s give them a round of applause.\n\nAnd I want to sincerely congratulate all of the graduates on a job well done, and this community for creating a place of learning that challenges students to rise to the occasion in addressing, head on, our changing world. There is a transition to a clean energy future, a climate crisis, and true equity that need to be embraced by fresh hands and minds, and you are the ones suited to this mission.\n\nBut most importantly, never discount the perspective that you bring.\n\nI never thought that the times I spent with my grandfather in his corn field, in the still summer air, irrigating, hoeing weeds, and picking worms off of corn, would mean something to a career in public service—that I never dreamed I would have; until it did.\n\nYour life and your experiences matter greatly, and I wish you all the joy in the world in seeing that value come to fruition in ways you may least expect. I have hope for the future, because you all will lead it.\n\nI know my generation and even past generations haven’t entirely lived up to our end of the deal, otherwise you would be inheriting a country where every individual and every ecosystem is thriving.\n\nI know you all have the intelligence and foresight to move our world in a loving direction of progress, and for that, I thank you.\n\nThank you all for the tremendous honor of being your Commencement speaker today, and be fierce.\n\n2021: Former OSF President Patrick Gaspard’s Commencement Address\n\nThe former president of the Open Society Foundations addressed Bard graduates on May 29, 2021.\n\nChairman Chambers; Board of Trustees; august faculty and staff; fellow distinguished honorees; the Annandale community; and the graduating class of 2021!\n\nWhat an overwhelming honor to join you in celebration—and to join you in person!\n\nPresident Botstein. Thank you, President Botstein, for that too generous an introduction. Thank you for the gifts of your scholarship and the gifts of your friendship. I’ve had the distinct pleasure of knowing President Botstein and spending meaningful time with him, but never in his sanctum sanctorum. Even away from campus and without the trappings of ceremony, President Botstein always seems to be wrapped in the garbs of ritual. That effect is greatly enhanced in academic regalia, which you wear quite well, sir. Hannah Arendt, whose grave lies near to us here on this campus, described friendship as “one of the most active modes of living.” Maestro, you embody that in the personal and in the political, and I see that ethos extends throughout this community.\n\nPlease be forewarned, Mr. President, that I have this belief that one should never waste the privilege of a public platform, and my inclination is to provoke and interrogate even at a tea party. Furthermore, while one might look for some practical directives from a commencement speaker, I’m oriented toward the impracticalities of the unapprehended poetry in our midst. I hope I won’t give you occasion to regret your generous introduction and welcome.\n\nGraduates, I have yet one more confession that I want to make here at the start. The address I’m delivering now was crafted late last night, after I completely rejected the arc of my original draft. Commencement addresses are bracketed by such traditional expectations of exhortative language that one tends to bury the desire to express any sincere sentiments that don’t fit neatly in that rubric. There’s a liturgical order to these things. I’m supposed to look out upon you, ordain your absolute greatness, acknowledge your brilliance, lift up the example of a great alumnus, and command you to go forth amidst the uncivilized herd to shine your light. If I were following the traditional pattern, I would pull down some appropriate quotation from the classics—something like Pindar from the Pythian Chronicles. I’d say, “O my soul, do not aspire to immortal life, but exhaust the limits of the possible,” and I would tell you then to exhaust the limits of the possible. All of this would all have the expectation being punctuated by raucous applause from all of you all. There wouldn’t be much room left for any nagging doubts about your accomplishments or your destinies.\n\nWhile your parents and loved ones, who paid dearly for the privilege, can trust that I’ll do some version of all of the above, there’s a different sensation and focus that quickens my reflections this afternoon. I want to interrogate the very notion of your exceptionalism and the broader question of our national exceptionalism at this moment when history is balanced on a knife’s edge.\n\nLet me start, though, with a note about the ground that we stand on. Contrary to my wariness about praising exceptionalism, we can all say an amen to the notion that Bard is a special place! Might I get an “Amen!” for that? It is indeed one of the essential spaces for those of us who care about the promotion and the protection of our open society. Graduates, please know this and hold on to that essentiality as you move on from this hamlet. It has been a year of acute struggle and profound isolation as you’ve attempted to endeavor to complete your studies during this pandemic season. I know that the siren song of early summer and the confidence that we all have now because we have vaccines in our arms—all of that compels us to get back to the excitement of worshipping the combustion of matter in motion that comprises contemporary civilization. But graduates, be still, and know that not all movement is toward meaning. Sit in this place. In the beatitude of it. Be present and imbibe the hard-won lessons of this traumatic year, but also take stock in the permanent ownership of the armature that you’ve acquired in this special place. Bard is an institution that we all should defend—fiercely! When I was asked to take up this honor, I didn’t hesitate for one second—first of all, it was because it would give me the opportunity to feel fabulous in a flowing robe. But mostly, because this is a nexus of thought and action that speaks to my core sense of democracy, justice, inclusion.\n\nThere are scholars who are joining us today who are graduating through the Bard Prison Initiative, which is one of our great Redemption Songs in higher education, in a society that imprisons people who look like me at disproportionate astronomical rates. As someone who grew up in financial hardship, I will praise-sing a college that opens its doors to a student population that’s 26 percent Pell eligible. And I’m awed by students who managed to not only be resourceful enough to conduct scientific research, artistic performances, and scholarly work under the strain of COVID but also participated in a yearlong President's Commission on Racial Equity and Justice. You asked the hard questions. You didn't accept the usual answers. You demanded positive change, and, critically, you took up the responsibility for the work that comes with change. This college, that has survived on the hustle and audacity of creative administrators, has far outpaced universities with deep endowments on the investments that you all have made on social justice and the building of a more perfect union. And that is deserving of self-applause.\n\nBard is also essential as an idea because the humanities and not only STEM are vital to remake the world in its broken places. We must learn how to understand, and not only how to have impact, to invest in meaning and not only in harnessing resources. We must be guided by the compass of our soul’s curiosity aligned with the ballast of our reflective moral equilibrium. These are the bricks and mortar of a Bard education, and the tent poles for a society that promotes the rights of the most vulnerable. This is clearly why George Soros, the great champion of open societies, saw fit to place an unprecedented big bet on the ideal of Bard. We should all do the same.\n\nAnd now, graduates, can we talk a little bit about you?\n\nI have to admit to being slightly intimidated by the notion that I’ve been asked to frame and define your triumph and to impart some vision as you take the next brash steps in your journeys. I feel poorly equipped to do that, mostly owing to the enormous wall that stands between our generations. I like to think of myself as somebody who is still relatively young. Clearly, I have an active imagination. But, in truth, I’m three decades older than you all, and share the same follicle challenge as your much-esteemed president. And, I’m on the verge of being fatigued by experiences that you don’t even have names for yet.\n\nBut as I considered what I might have to say to you today I realized that there is some strength and advantage in my infirmities. Now, I’ve always been one to advise that one should be profoundly suspicious of the agendas and the generosities of the previous generation. But please know that, while I might not have an intimacy with your music, your fashion, or with your tech, I do have the ability to look back on the arc of my own journey, which I’ve traveled from the seats you currently occupy right now to this perch at this podium, with this embarrassing notion that titles I’ve worn uneasily or the marbled halls that I’ve accessed somehow grant me some bizarre exceptionalism that compels you to have to suffer through my poor musings. But oddly, my confidence in our kinship grows as I realize—with apologies to your loved ones and these extraordinary educators—how spectacularly ordinary we all are. Yes, I said ordinary. I know it’s customary to extoll your genius on a day like today. But ultimately, the diploma that you’re going to receive on this stage does little to distinguish you from the nearly 117 billion homo sapiens who have devoured oxygen before you. Heck, there are four million students who are receiving some form of college diplomas in the United States this year alone!\n\nAll of our beauty, brilliance, essentialness, all of our genius, was all greatly exaggerated. This is true of us all, perhaps with the exception of your honorary recipient Audra McDonald, who is as brilliant and as genius as advertised. There are ways though that you may yet elevate your soul’s highest song and the greatness that your families aspire to for you. But I’ll get there momentarily.\n\nIn many ways, I’m still very much the person that I was when I reached your mark. But there are ways that life alters you far beyond your ability to even recognize yourself. I had an Odyssean greed for experience that was set against the very real limitations of economic degradations and the lived challenges of institutionalized racial animus. Those impositions stirred in me an anger that could have been dangerously self-destructive. My salvation came in the form of involvement in movements far greater than myself that pulled down my vanities and channeled whatever few gifts I had. I learned, in my wilderness journey, what President Barack Obama articulated with such precision, that “thinking about only yourself, fulfilling your immediate wants and needs, betrays a poverty of ambition.”\n\nThis poverty of ambition and all-consuming certitude about the significance of one’s own navel extends from the individual to the nation-state—to this nation-state. I’ve been involved in the work of politics my entire life. From solidarity work in my Haitian American diaspora community, to my true awakening in the anti-apartheid era, to my work as an organizer for low-wage workers, to my efforts in electoral politics which culminated in my service in the White House and my foray into diplomacy and international advocacy through philanthropy. You might say that I’ve been in the business of history. And I’ve done it with a religiosity, a faith in functional cooperative behaviors and structures that enable us all to impose our will on history for progressive outcomes. The central notion in my unpacking of it is that history is in all of what we keep. What we choose to preserve. What is in the service of a coherent humanitarianism. And in what advances justice. As an immigrant who had to carve out his own sense of Americanness, I can appreciate the words of Vaclav Havel, who wrote that “he tried to hold in a single thought ‘reality’ and ‘justice.’”\n\nThere’s a struggle in that for those of us who are not part of the orthodoxy, who sit outside the traditions of power in this nation. This sense that justice is a transcendent thing that is ever elusive.\n\nJustice has been historically elusive in our nation. And so has truly inclusive representative democracy. I won’t here recite our innumerable challenges and our most recent traumas, though the recent insurrections in our nation’s Capitol and the ensuing lack of national examination remind us that violence and authoritarianism have more enablers than instigators. I raise this here to extend my interrogation of exceptionalism—in this case, American exceptionalism—and to wonder aloud what a recasting of America’s place in the world might mean for this graduating class and your generation, both those who are U.S.-born and based and the 10 percent of your cohort who are international students.\n\nWe are emerging from a devastating health and economic crisis greatly exacerbated by the ignorance of ill-equipped leaders who insisted on our exceptionalism in the face of the shocking death tolls, the stunning job loss and resulting hunger and deprivations. The essential nation, essential America, was exposed as a fragile state, despite the resilience of our truly essential workers and the deep pockets of wealth. We suffered from that poverty of ambition—an inability to see ourselves in the world and a failure to count up the cost of isolation and America Firstism.\n\nWhat might a different ambition look like now? How might we look beyond our own navels?\n\nThe great writer Ralph Ellison was an instructor here at Bard in the late 1950s, a time when, surely, he must have been one of the few Black people on this campus. Ellison wrote that “Americans give but a limited attention to history. Too much happens too rapidly and before we can evaluate it, or exhaust its meaning or pleasure, there is something new to concern us. Ours is the tempo of the motion picture, not that of the still camera, and we waste experience.”\n\nWe waste experience. How do we advantage ourselves from the great toll of experiences that we’ve just had? We must begin with a deexceptionalization of the self and the nation. America is of course an overwhelming planetary force. But we need to help repair the world and protect against future calamities by being one of many players in it. We can and we must tackle the great challenges cooperatively, not through a winner-takes-all race to the bottom. Any diplomat will tell you that confrontation alone mostly fails. For instance, we can appreciate that in order to reinvigorate the global human rights movement while also solving for our climate crisis we need to be able to hold the reality of the injustice endured by the Uighur community and confront China, whilst recognizing the enormity of the scale of carbon emissions while we work in partnership with China. We have to appreciate the singularity of the American experience of systemic racism while reaching for the lessons that we might draw from the resistance to police abuse in the favelas in Rio, where there are countless George Floyds every day.\n\nWhat America does best is lead with the capacity for reinvention. Right now, the world needs the spark of that and not the poverty of an ambitious hegemony.\n\nI’ll conclude by returning to the individual. To you all. And to your exceptional opportunity to be great. Now coming out of our long quarantine, it’s easy to slide into a lazy decade of youthful waste, where the health of your generation will be judged by all of what you consume. That would be a poverty of ambition. We need to look up from our navels and look up from our phones and realize at last that service to others is the only leadership that has legacy.\n\nIn my pocket and now placed on this podium, I have this treasured photograph of my father from the 1950s. My later father. He’s resplendent in a graduation gown replete with satin flourishes. He matches you in style, President Botstein. In his hand he’s clutching, seemingly for dear life, his law diploma, which he had just received from the finest university in Haiti. The world was very much in front of him, with his exceptionalism assured, but even in that moment this diploma was losing all value as a brutal dictatorship, supported by the United States, was taking hold in that proud island nation and dismantling the very concept of justice. He never got to practice his profession. Our ideals of peace and justice are ephemeral, fragile things without sustainable institutions like Bard and without servant leadership. My father’s degree was printed on stock equal to yours, but what he learned is what you need to learn, that you need to prove the value of that degree every single day. Every day. And you do it with service to others.\n\nThat’s a lesson that I’ve had to learn and to take up over and over because sometimes your ego can kind of get in the way. I learned this lesson a few years ago when I was down in Atlanta, Georgia. I had to give an address, not dissimilar to this one, at a conference in Georgia, and I was feeling pretty good about myself. My ego was walking into the door before I arrived, and I was feeling rather exceptional. As I’m wont to do whenever I’m in Atlanta, I went off and visited Dr. King’s old church. And, as I went in there, as I sat in the pews and I looked at the podium that he used to command, there was a loop tape that was playing, and his oceanic voice swept over the room:\n\nHe who is greatest among you shall be a servant. Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve.\n\nYou don't have to have a college degree to serve.\n\nYou don't have to make your subject and verb agree to serve.\n\nYou don't have to know Einstein’s theory of relativity to serve.\n\nYou don't have to know the second theory of thermonuclear dynamics to serve.\n\nAll you need is a heart full of grace, a soul generated by love.\n\nYou can be that servant.\n\nMy ego was put in check.\n\nYes, you can be that servant. Service begins with the recognition of the greatness of others and the desire to lift it up. Look at the student that’s sitting next to you. Exalt in their greatness. Forget your accomplishments for a moment. Think about what’s been sacrificed by others to get you to this moment. There’s exceptionalism in those who washed floors to pay for your brilliance. Be present in that goodness. Revel in that greatness. Elevate it. Celebrate it. Be in the service of it and your own brilliance will shine on through. You can be that servant.\n\nHere I’m reminded of the hymn by the Indian poet Tagore:\n\nI slept and dreamt that life was joy.\n\nI awoke and saw that life was service.\n\nI acted and behold, service was joy.\n\nTake up the joy of your exceptional service, Class of 2021. We await your greatness!\n\n2020: Musician David Byrne’s Commencement Address\n\nThe Talking Heads frontman addressed Bard graduates in a virtual ceremony on August 22, 2020.\n\nThank you. Congratulations to the brass ensemble. It’s very difficult to play together when you’re distanced. I heard a story from a musician the other day. There was a socially distanced orchestra that was playing, and some of the musicians said, “You have to gesture bigger, we can’t see you.” So, the conductor had to make it bigger than before, so that everybody could see.\n\nThis is certainly my first time talking to a live audience … performing, alright, to a live audience in many, many months. It’s kind of strange. It’s kind of wonderful. It’s strange and wonderful to actually be gathered in a group of people this much. I’m encouraged by this institution. I was invited to come here. I have some familiarity with this place. I understand what Bard stands for.\n\nI recently worked with a Bard alumnus named Alex Kalman ’06 on a book. I’ve written about the Bard Prison Initiative, which I think some of you will be familiar with. And, I’ve read some pieces that Mr. Botstein wrote about music.\n\nThis place is special. I’ve been here, visited here a few times over the years. I saw an exhibition at the gallery in 2008. The gallery had been turned into a re-creation of the artist Keith Edmier’s parents’ house, with all its extreme ’70s décor. It was like walking into a movie set. And, you know, as you walk into a movie set, you know that it’s all fake, but part of you is still seduced into feeling that you’re in that place. There’s this kind of wonderful tension in something like that where you know it’s fake, but you kind of feel like you’re in the place at the same time, between the real and the artificial. We are in a world that someone has made that is just like this world that this artist made of his parents’ house.\n\nHis world, like our world, is unreliable. It’s based on unreliable memory and imagination. We all do this. We make these artificial worlds. The difference is, we have to live in them. A world that’s made like this, it can be a seductive lie, or it can be a revealing truth. On a thing like this, a commencement, I imagine it’s common to ask oneself, “Well, what comes next for me? What comes next for me as I leave this place? Will I be a different person? Will I be a different person than I was a month ago?” Well, I think we’re all different than we were last week. Things are changing incredibly rapidly. And then you ask, “What person am I now, and how should I be as that person? What do I love? What does that entail? What, if any, are the … obligations? Obligations to myself? Obligations to a larger community? How does one reconcile oneself, between one’s personal rights, one’s personal desires, and those of the community and the collective? What have I learned here? Has the world changed? Has the world changed [laughing] since the spring? It probably has. Has it changed into something far different than the world that I knew? Is that a good thing? Is everything I learned here, at this institution, now meaningless?” I don’t think so.\n\nI’m very sorry for the world you inherit. We’ve left you a mess, the one that we made, the world that we made. But, there are reasons to be cheerful. The pandemic has pulled back the curtain, which has revealed both the worst and the best of what and who we are. Arundhati Roy, the writer, referred to this moment as a portal when we have unprecedented opportunity to change things, to cross into another world. In this moment, we have been both cursed and blessed. This is one of those moments that occur once in a while. Ideas that were taken as given, economic ideas, cultural ideas, etc., are being questioned, reconsidered. An era based on a set of biases and assumptions is ending. In a sense, we’re lucky. The portal that she mentions is opened and we have a chance to go through it.\n\nI’m as a guilty as anyone else for waking up in the morning and feeling that nothing really changes very much. I have moments of despair and anger and frustration. No surprise. Martin Luther King Jr.’s quote, “The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice,” some mornings that feels like an empty platitude when I look at the news that morning. It sometimes feels like, oh, you know, same as it ever was. But that’s not really true. The real constant is change. We often forget or overlook the momentous changes in our thinking that we now accept as obvious, inevitable. But, in truth, nothing was inevitable. The changes that have happened, that we live with now, for better or worse, they’re here because we made them so.\n\nOkay, here’s a few of them: slavery is now universally considered unacceptable. Two thousand years ago, Aristotle thought slavery was natural and necessary, but even then his contemporaries argued that it was unacceptable. These changes don’t happen overnight. Okay, here’s another one: women should be allowed to vote. If I said to anyone now that if you heard someone else say, “No, women shouldn’t be allowed to vote,” you would think that was completely ridiculous. It happened in the United States, state by state, one hundred years ago. In Saudi Arabia it happened five years ago, but it happened. Education, primary and secondary education, I think everyone accepts that it should be free, it’s a right for everyone to have it. This was not always true. Children were considered cheap labor. Eventually, maybe higher education will be considered a right as well. Interracial marriage: I think we all accept this now. We all accept this. It seems like, what’s the big deal? The Supreme Court made a ruling legalizing interracial marriage in 1967—not that long ago. Alabama has some laws on the books that counteracted the Supreme Court ruling, and those were overturned 20 years ago. Okay, gay marriage, we all know that this is now law, this is now legal. When I was a young person, if someone had told me that this would be legal and generally accepted, I would have said, “You’re crazy, this should happen, but it’s going to take forever.” But, just five years ago, in 2015, it was recognized as legal in all 50 states.\n\nI can go on—infrastructure, clean air, clean water, things that don’t exist for us entirely now, but we do think of them as our right, and these ideas that we consider as part of our lives and how it is to live and how it is to be, it didn’t always have to be that way. It wasn’t always that way. This is something new in the world, and the world has changes. These changes weren’t predictable, and they weren’t inevitable. I’m a little older than some of you, and I can say that some of these changes, they weren’t expected. They weren’t expected to happen as soon as they did, and when they did, then they seemed inevitable. People make these changes. Things that seemed impossible have happened, and they will continue to happen. Try and imagine what radical and momentous changes in our thinking might happen next, and they will! We can imagine what they might be.\n\nOkay, make no mistake, things can go wrong, things can go the other way. This country was ever so closely inching towards democracy, but, as in many other countries around the world, there’s been some serious backsliding. There’s no guarantee that change will be good. That part is up to us. And, so I ask myself, “How did these changes happen? Where’s the levers? Where’s the buttons? What’s the process? What can we, as a lone individual or with a little group of people, what can we do to have an effect?” I supposed you might ask yourselves the same questions. “Does my line of work have any wider resonance?” Not that every line of work has to focus directly or solely on social justice. I believe that the meaning of what we do, in our work and our lives, is more subtle than that. I’ll use myself as an example, okay? Most of the time I’m a performer and a musician, and it seems to me that music and performance affects people’s view of the world, not directly, not by me writing a song about climate policy or housing inequities, although I might like to do that. Rather, it works in a less didactic and not kind of text-based ways. It’s kind of a language without words. Music creates community. When I was young, I heard music on a little radio that was about the size of a phone. And, I realized when I heard this music that there was a world out there that was very different and wider than the little suburban town that I lived in. You’ve heard people say things like, “That song saved my life” or “That DJ saved my life,” and these are kind of clichés, but there’s a truth to it. Music can have that kind of effect. It reveals a larger world, and it brings people together because they know that there are other people out there like them. For someone else, it might not be music that has this effect. It might be the visual arts, theater, cooking, dance. It might be ways of thinking in education, sustainability, even economics can touch people about a new idea and it changes their thinking.\n\nI also think that one discipline needs to influence all the others. There needs to be a lot of curiosity about what’s going on in other disciplines, and one discipline can, in surprising ways, affect another one. When I heard the music of James brown, as a young man, I came to realize that here is music where no one part is more important than any other. The melody is not played by one instrument, but it emerges out of the interlocking parts played by all the instruments. The groove is not just played by the drums, but it comes into being as a result of what everyone is doing. I sensed that, unlike traditional Western music, Brown’s music is nonhierarchical. In his musical model, we’re given an audio metaphor. We hear, metaphorically, a model of social organization and cooperation that makes us feel joyous and transported. We’re not kind of intellectually going through all of this, but I feel that we sense it. Here I sense is a social and economic argument made with music, and the transcendent feeling it brings, when you hear and experience it, is more persuasive that language. Music proposes a world. Metaphorically, it gives evidence of that possibility. An economist hearing James Brown might possibly see the world the same way. Of course, my model for cross-disciplinary influences comes from music, but it can go the other way as well.\n\nI’m going to mention the first abstract artist, Hilma af Klint, who was influenced by spiritualism that was prevalent over a hundred years ago, turn of the last century. It had been proposed that one of the reasons for the wide enthusiasm for this spiritualism was because of the scientific discoveries that were happening at that time. The science was showing that there were invisible forces in our world. Electromagnetism, radiation, radio waves, X-rays. The entire world, ourselves included, are affected by these invisible and pervasive forces. Science proposed this world, a world that hadn’t previously existed in our imagination, and this affected how these artists worked. They realized that what we with see with our eyes is only part of what is there, and artists like af Klint and others began to attempt the abstractions to represent this world, a world of energy that go through buildings and go through our bodies. So, with art and science, we conjure worlds, and, over time, we who conjure these worlds, we ourselves change, and then worlds that we conjure, those change as well.\n\nA couple of years ago, after I finished a music tour that lasted almost a year, I decided to go to India. I wanted to catch a traditional music festival in Chennai. It was wonderful. I saw a kid, this young kid in a kind of Elvis outfit playing Carnatic music on a saxophone. I saw singers communicating with drummers with their hands. And, I also went to Kerala, which is another state in the south, and there’s a kind of performance there called Kudiyattam. It’s an ancient form of dance drama. It’s about a thousand years old. In this dance drama, the performer begins the performance by metaphorically dancing into existence and kind of proposing a world. This will be the world that the story will take place in, kind of like Star Wars or Game of Thrones. It’s complete, it has a cosmology, it has a history, every detail. In the dance drama, the world building is not made with sets and props and computers. It’s conjured in the audience’s imagination, via singing and dancing and gesture. Like the actors in this drama, we, in whichever field we endeavor, we also dance a new world into existence—not just in music or theater, every kind of work and activity we engage in proposes a world. In the end of the Kudiyattam performance, the actors dismantle the world that they have made. Likewise, we destroy an old world, a worn-out world, the one we ourselves and others before us have made, so that a new one can be imagined and brought into existence.\n\n2019: New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s Commencement Address\n\nThe mayor of New Orleans addressed Bard graduates on May 25, 2019.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you. And congratulations!\n\nMy heart is so full to be here with you at this time. It is truly an honor and a privilege. I want to begin by thanking, of course, our president, Leon Botstein. To our first lady, Miss Barbara, I cannot miss you or leave you out. The board of trustees. Very important. Faculty, staff, parents, but most importantly, each and everyone of you who are graduates on this afternoon. Thank you so much. We’re proud of you.\n\nFirst, I would like to begin by describing how my path truly reflects the kind of unconventional leadership that Bard instills and the values of this institution that each and everyone one of you have embraced. To its fullest, you have. Now, as mentioned, I came to New Orleans as an undergraduate student to attend Xavier University of Louisiana. Even at that time with applying to colleges, I did tell a little lie, and I told my people I was applying to schools all over. I only applied to Xavier University. I felt it in my heart an in my soul. Thank God, I was accepted.\n\nYou know when I started Xavier, it was on the back of Mother Katharine Drexel. But today, Katharine Drexel is a saint. So, she was looking out for me then. I began working in the Broadmoor community, really in the community as a whole. Because while attending Xavier, I saw the stark differences, the disparities that exist in my city, and the love and the culture of her people. It got me grounded and rooted in the community, but in the City of New Orleans. What I say is that my soul found its home in the city. So, I began to work at the grassroots level. My husband and I bought a home in Broadmoor. Settled there, and you know what, one day woke up and my community was devastated. Eighty percent of the city was under water. The community of Broadmoor has 10 to 12 feet water that sat in our community for over a three-week period. 2,400 homes, all of our civic institutions and facilities, our schools, our library, our churches, you name it, our people, our families. Working on the ground and working with community and the power of community, which led the City of New Orleans to recovery. It did happen. But this led me to become a council member of the city and then later mayor. Non-traditional all the way.\n\nA couple of reasons for things that are associated with being a non-traditional leader. First, as mentioned, being the first female elected as mayor in New Orleans’ 300-year history. And the most gratifying thing about that is knowing that I will not be the last. Considered an outsider, non-native New Orleanian with roots in California. This had not been done, and, quite frankly, the powers that be felt that it just could not even happen. I didn’t come with a background into politics through that legal profession route. It was that grass roots route. But, like many of my peers, that was that path, right, to elected office. But my style was more on the side of civil disobedience, not so much upholding the law, not trying to tear it down, but when you see government telling you “no” every step of the way, you have to find that non-traditional path.\n\nAnd so like in Broadmoor and me and my residents, like Hal Rourke, who was with me this afternoon, and Lily Rourke and Laurie, who are here. We had a green dot over our community. Our community was being recommended to government not to be rebuilt, not to return. Government was telling us, “no, your public school isn’t coming back; no, your public library isn’t coming back; quite frankly, you’re not coming back.” We did not accept that at all. And, not accepting that as an answer. And, so what you have to do in those situations, you have to create partnerships with non-traditional thinkers like Bard. You change government and the status quo in that process. Bard is an institution that seeks to grow that same non-traditional leader. This is exemplified through a college president who was the youngest ever to serve in this role right here. Through civic engagement programming that empowers young leaders like yourselves who have truly big, big ideas. Also, out of the array of private liberal arts colleges, Bard has been able to advance because of its credibility it has built in the community and not its connections to wealth and privilege and prestige.\n\nThis is a parallel truly to my own story of coming into leadership through hard work, through values and tapping into people around me, as opposed to political connections. Also, unconventional leadership means being committed to doing what is right even if it may be politically unpopular. It’s a big deal. Or, even aligned with profit, right? That’s not who we are, it’s not who Bard represents, and it’s certainly not you. Bard established education programs in prisons and set up the first dual-degree program with a Palestinian university. Bard has received criticism and political blowback for these actions, but this hasn’t stopped the College from stepping out and doing what’s right when it’s the right thing to do and the right time to do it, in spite of the naysayers. These parallels really do reflect my own story and something that I’ve accomplished as mayor as relates to, I call it, #fairshare. Now as being mayor over the past year, I had to face not only infrastructure challenges, but again with the powers that be to say, no, no we will not rededicate revenue generated from hospitality in the State of Louisiana, but truly the revenue based off of the backs of the hard-working people in the City of New Orleans that drives the economy of the State of Louisiana. But I was faced with our governor even at the time saying, no way that cannot happen. But, the reality has been that although the City of New Orleans absolutely is a world class city, and is a destination city, and drives the economy of the State of Louisiana, the City of New Orleans had no received her fair share based off of that revenue that she’s been generations. So pushing the envelope a little bit further and saying, you know what, it’s time. If we have these issues in the city relative to infrastructure, basic city services, an economy that drives over $200 million and even into the billions into the economy, but only the City of New Orleans receiving less than ten cents on every single dollar that it generates. Educating the public, saying that, you know what, when we do have these big Super Bowls and we have all these great events, the City of New Orleans doesn’t benefit in ways that she deserves.\n\nBut, taking on that spirit of Bard, ensuring and not accepting no for an answer. Today, I have to tell you that we claimed a real victory in the City of New Orleans, because, today, it has been passed at the state legislature where the City of New Orleans will now receive a little bit more of what she generates, and that’s because we, collectively, won’t take no for an answer. We can accomplish great things by pushing that envelope and pushing back on government at times even when they’re telling you no. That’s a big deal for the City of New Orleans. It’s a big deal. She will now receive over $50 million up front and some recurring revenue off of the industry of an upward of $28 million a year. Folk said it could not be done, but we did it. You can do it too.\n\nThere are so many stories of Bard students who have come down to New Orleans and how they reflect this unconventional leadership. Whether that’s Stephen Tremaine ’07. Absolutely. I met Stephen as an undergraduate student. He was volunteering at First Presbyterian Church in Broadmoor, post-Katrina. He stood up at one of our neighborhood meetings and told Hal and I. He said, “you know, I have students who would love to volunteer. Do you think they can come down for spring break?” And, we were like, “of course!” He organized hundreds of Bard students who came down year after year after year. Stephen is now leading the (Bard) network of early colleges in cities across the U.S. Thank you, Stephen, and thank you to the class of 2007.\n\nMilo Daemgen ’10. He’s another example of non-traditional leadership. We found that Milo was able to tell stories through film. So, he told our community stories, the stories of our recovery that would really lead us to green pastures, meaning, as a community being able to implement the redevelopment plan that we created. But Milo helped us tell our stories. And, then Milo went on to work on my campaign for mayor, and he was able to tell stories, not of my leadership, but it was a real reflection of the people that I was stepping up to lead. And, the stories of the residents and the people of the City of New Orleans were always front and center, but Milo continued to shine and shine New Orleans light forward. And, I want to say thank you, Milo, and thank you to the class of 2010.\n\nEmily Wolff ’10. I remember Emily as a 19-year-old woman when she first came to Broadmoor. She was young and inexperienced, but she was so eager to put her education to work and help us when we needed it most. She organized volunteers after Stephen graduated. Later, she became invaluable as she transitioned into a neighborhood leader as the executive director of the Broadmoor Improvement Association. Really, she stepped in my role once I became a councilwoman. She began to lead the Broadmoor Improvement Association. A neighborhood that prides itself in recognizing but also asking for leadership from unconventional sources. Today, this woman, Emily, she serves the City of New Orleans and is now the head of the city’s first office of youth and families, under my leadership. Thank you, Emily, again and the class of 2010.\n\nAnd I know that Charlie Barnes ’09 is out there somewhere. He was my counterpart as we had to gut our public school, Wilson Public School in Broadmoor. But, that didn’t stop Charlie B. He came on back. A year ago he was teaching our young people coding. And he continues to thrive, and we love you, Charlie, wherever you are. I know you’re here.\n\nBut, these stories reflect that building back my community better than before meant turning to places you haven’t turned to before. And, one of the of the places was a small liberal arts college in Upstate New York. Bard. I’ve also learned some unconventional things from Bard, I have to say, like using organic deodorant. Now, I have to say, I tried this out. Couldn’t stick with it. I had to go back pH balance and Secret. But, I did try y’all. I used Tom’s. It didn’t work for me. But, regardless, these stories reflect paths that are completely unconventional. But, it was also innovative, and it was necessary.\n\nI want you all to hear three things I want to leave with you. Number one, you will not get there one your own. It just won’t happen. You don’t get there by yourself. You didn’t get this far by yourself. You won’t move forward without the people you surround yourself with. And, you need to ensure that you keep surrounding yourself with people who share your values, who build you up, who don’t tear you down. So, you’re about to take another leap forward into this world. Sometimes it’s kind, and sometimes it’s not. But, if you stay close to people who support you, you will get there. It’s not about an individual accrual of power or going it alone. It’s about the power of many voices, many people rowing in that same direction. This is a healthier and more sustainable way of thinking about leadership versus the idea that any person, any one person, a single president, a mayor, can accomplish great things all alone. It doesn’t happen that way. Bard pushes you. It pushes you to get outside of your own bubble, understanding the experiences of others. It’s very important. It allows you to think differently and understand why people do what they do or think the way that they think. It allows you to be more inclusive, more intentional about everybody and understanding that we truly all matter. This is important.\n\nBard pushes you again. Getting outside of that bubble, and that spirit of diversity always seems to shine through with the spirit of Bard. This is a bold way of thinking about leadership in this American moment. As college graduates, embarking on your next chapters, continue to be bold. I’m encouraging you to do that.\n\nNumber two, be impatient with injustice. As graduates of this prestigious college, I hope that you will be impatient about combatting the injustices that we know exist, and we see them every single day. There are examples of the College being impatient with injustice, like the Trustee Leader Scholar Program, the (Bard) Prison Initiative, and the Early College programs across the country. Eager to lean in in, lean forward and find solutions, but also understand that it’s a marathon, it’s not a spring. You will come up against seemingly insurmountable challenges. It’s just inevitable. And, you will need to find a way to go in, around, under, or straight through every single challenge that’s before you. You will inevitably get into a situation where you are like damned if you do, damned if you don’t. But, I’m going to tell you about that, my approach to it. I always seem to find myself of damned if I do because I’m going to do, and for Bard students, that’s what you’re all about, and I know it. I know it from experience, from encountering these great relationships that I’ve been able to build with this wonderful, wonderful institution. Bard has shaped you to be doers. Keep doing, despite what the naysayers will say because they will, but who cares. We will always look to solutions, and, literally, who cares. We don’t care. Like I tell my people, “bring it on!” But, understand again, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. Perseverance is the key.\n\nWhich leads me to the last and, maybe, the most important piece of my advice. Really figure out a way and truly understand what it is that you draw your strength from, and every single time you kind of have to go back to it. Now, for me, and this is me personally, it’s my faith. It really is. I have a little altar in my office, I buy my candles, I light ‘em, sometimes I let those suckers burn all night long. But, it gives me the faith in the power that I need to continue to stand. But, whatever that is for you, whatever that is for you, you continue to lean on it every single day because it will not disappoint, but you have to determine what that is for you, that strength, because it’s there.\n\nSo, in closing, when you step out, you will be looking for those future Broadmoors, I’m hoping. Whatever, wherever they may be, I know for a fact that you truly can make a difference. I want you to make a difference. I want you to take advantage of those opportunities that you create, that you find. We have a changing world, and we need dynamic, unconventional leadership every step of the way. You’ve been equipped with all the tools that you need in your toolbox. Now, it’s simply time to use each and every one of them. But, you have been built to last. You are a tough piece of leather that’s well put together, and it’s because of all the support that’s around you this afternoon. So, you keep on standing, and you stand tall, and you be unconventional because that’s what we’re called to do. So, God bless you, each and every one of you. God bless Bard College. God Bless the United States of America, and, more importantly, this entire world that we live in. And, this world needs you. We need you. We need your unconventional leadership that I know you possess. So, thank you so much for what you mean to me, what you mean to the City of New Orleans, and what you mean to this world. God bless you.\n\n2018: Entrepreneur Megan J. Smith’s Commencement Address\n\nThe award-winning tech entrepreneur addressed Bard graduates on May 26, 2018.\n\nHello, it’s so incredible to be here with all of you. Thank you, President Botstein, and also Chairman Chambers.\n\nI first just want to say welcome to all of you, the parents and family and friends and everybody who supported this incredible class; to you, the faculty who have worked with them; and of course to all of you, the incredible class from Bard 2018. Congratulations.\n\nBard is just this incredible, extraordinary learning community. You’re a group of doers. Yesterday, I got to sit with a group of students and learn about their Senior Projects. This is an active learning community, a global community. We’re joined by not only your core group but also high schoolers who got to go early, who were ready; those who were stuck in incarceration, who were ready; those who are former refugees now living in new places, who were ready. Bard is a place that welcomes everybody. And, it’s an extraordinary thing to come to this community. I’m proud of all of you, and I’m happy to be here in the right kind of place for social justice because I want to talk to you about is, there is nothing that’s more powerful than all of us together.\n\nSo, sometimes if I talk about technology, you kind of feel like—remember back in third grade, some people got pulled into technology and some people thought that what you’re teaching me is making me really bored and really intimidated? So how is it that we can use these power tools, these tools of Hogwarts per se, to make extraordinary things happen and reduce what is going on now—some weaponization, right, that happened this past year or two.\n\nThe chief technology officer is a new job that President Obama added into our government. The job is to help the president and their team harness the power of data, innovation, and technology on behalf of the American people. We as a country and as a world have always used science and technology, and, in fact, they say that President Washington was the first one to begin this as he started what became the Army Corps of Engineers. So, we have a long tradition of science and technology, but this new idea that the digital age, as we move from the Industrial Age into the digital age, which you are entering and you are a big part of, was very important to the president to add that capability to our government. And so we began to work together. And, I just note across the time that you have been in school, from high school and college, if you think back, just a vignette, Secretary Foxx was a secretary of transportation with us. During his committee hearings with Congress, during the confirmation hearings, there was no mention in detail of technology. And yet, by the time Secretary Foxx finished, we had worked together with him on all of the policy for UAV flying; all of the policy for smart cities and a smart-city competition that saw hundreds of cities across our country working together; the next generation of air traffic control; self-driving cars—you name it. Really, the Department of Transportation is a technology department. And, in fact, every agency of our government turns out to be a technology department, and every organization has technology in it. And so my hope for you is to think very broadly about tech.\n\nAlso, when I came to the government, I had the chance to sit with President Obama at first as we were figuring out the agenda, and I had brought him a present. For me, sometimes the oldest technology is the most profound. And I had brought a sailcloth, something from Hawaii, I don’t know if there’s anyone here from Hawaii, but the Hōkūle‘a is an extraordinary sailing vessel, and if you’ve seen the movie Moana, you know about Polynesian sailing. What I’m here to tell you is that the Hawaiians and the Polynesians are actually able to do that. And so I’m going to talk today a little bit about artificial intelligence and very advanced technologies, and yet sometimes the oldest technologies are the most profound. And, I had brought a sailcloth from the Hōkūle‘a to President Obama, who is from Hawaii, as a gift because, as his chief technology officer, of course we look to the future, but really sometimes these old technologies are the most significant. And what I love about the Hōkūle‘ais that what the people of Hawaii did, is that they sailed around our planet in a small Polynesian canoe using zero instruments. No compass. Nothing. Can you imagine, just the front row, we’ll all go on this boat in the middle of the Pacific, and which way shall we go? Right, imagine that. And we humans—humans did that. So think about how incredible each of you are, and what you’ll bring. So it’s not about technology; it’s about you. And, it’s about what you would manifest using these tools of the world.\n\nSo, I want to touch on three things, three things in my hopes to encourage you, all people, to think about using technology for what you would want to engage with—not what agenda someone else already has, what they’re interested in, but what would you do with these tools? And the first point is about the internet. The internet is not technology, it’s just really us. It’s just us, connected, right? Humanity connected and the extraordinary things that we can do, and let’s talk about the opportunity. We’re connected across people, we’re connected across data, we’re connected amongst machines. The whole world has this interconnection that is happening, so we’re able to do things that were not possible before, and the democratization of tools—for example 3D printing, the Internet of Things, CRISPR, synthetic biology—all these tools that none of us could have ever dreamed of having, these are tools, you know, millions and billions of dollars of lab equipment, now available to a sixth grader. That’s an extraordinary thing. What would we make? And how do we think about human values in that context? There’s an idea that I have always about scouting and scaling and looking for what’s out there, and so I might bring forward just a couple of technologies just to have in mind with all of you.\n\nWhen we were with the president and the end of his administration, we had a conference in Pittsburgh, and we talked about human frontiers, and we chose five to look at, and I’ll just touch on them quickly.\n\nThe first one: personal frontiers. Personalized medicine, brain research, personalized learning—all the things that could come to help each of us individually with our health, with our lives, with our learning.\n\nLocal frontiers. How could we not only have smart cities and deal with logistics and utilities and those things but also wise communities and more just societies in the spirit of Ida B. Wells? One of American’s greatest data scientists, Wells used data and journalism to stop us from lynching people. What might we do to use data science in our communities to help those who would not go hungry if we did that, to help those be in a more just place, to help those out of poverty with data science?\n\nWe looked at national frontiers, and, for us, we looked at artificial intelligence and how we were working together with our natural systems. And, on a global level, we looked at climate change, at the move to green energy, at the move to green chemistry. Why can’t we have a thriving ecosystem and think about healthy designs? It’s interesting. I mentioned Hawaii and the Hōkūle‘a. Today, they pull a tanker of oil to Honolulu every two days and burn it. And yet they are so abundant with sun and wind, and so they’re working together today on global change and becoming a green island, a green set of places. They also have geothermal.\n\nAnd then interplanetary was the last one, and the Rodenberry family opened that [?]. So think of SpaceX, Blue Origin—you are the Mars generation. People in this class will be working on those missions, and some of you will probably leave this planet and live in other places. What an extraordinary thing to think about.\n\nSo as we think about this, how is it that we can use all of these technologies for opportunities, not just for the agenda that we currently see—self-driving cars, precision medicine—but for poverty and for justice and those areas? One of the things we got to work on in the administration was that we looked around for who had already solved things. When you’re in Silicon Valley working with that venture capital community, the VCs and the funders don’t make the companies; they find extraordinary entrepreneurs. So, who are the Clara Barton, the Henry Ford, the George Washington Carver, the Gandhi of today that we might come up underneath and support? Some of the ones we encountered were people like Beno Juarez, who was from the Amazon. He grew up there until he was nine, and then he left and became an expert in advanced manufacturing. Now, he’s back home, and he’s actually doing advance manufacturing, floating makerspace FabLabs in the Amazon. So, instead of having a job of cutting down trees, you can bring your indigenous knowledge forward and have the same kind of advanced manufacturing you might find in Boston, or in Silicon Valley, or in a top lab, but floating in a river right next to you—so, this democratization of technology.\n\nWe started doing a thing called the Tech Jobs Tour that my friend Leanne started, who’s married to Pia here, who’s a graduate. We went 25 places all over the country—Memphis, Mississippi, Cheyenne, across Appalachia—and we found doers and innovators everywhere, so people are getting it done and solving problems in their communities.\n\nBut the second thing I want to talk to you about is not just this opportunity and encouraging you to think of what you are passionate about working on, how you can solve issues using these tools, but also how they can be weaponized. So, technology is not good or bad. We are, right?
