        "text": "Thursday, August 3, 1752 – This morning we bade farewell to our brethren, and at 8 o’clock went with our things on board the sloop which is to take us to Albany. We set sail immediately. The captain’s name is Egbert Egbertse, a low Dutchman by birth, who showed us much civility, offering us his private cabin. We sailed today upwards of twenty miles.\n\nSaturday, August 5, 1752 – Fair winds all day. The Captain continues his kindness towards us, and he has not asked us who we are, which is otherwise not the way of the Low Dutch in this country. ‘Tis probable he knows that we belong to the brethren. At noon we arrived off Cornelius Beekman’s where Bro. Martin left us to go on to Rhinebeck to buy a horse, and then to follow us by land to Albany. Bro. David and Rundt arrived at Albany about 11 o’clock at night and remained on the sloop until morning.\n\nSunday, August 6, 1752 – Today Bro. Martin visited in Rhinebeck. Bro. David and Rundt lodged with the Captain.\n\nBy Friday, August 11th they had left Albany to continue their missionary journey to the Indians.\n\nThey returned to Bethlehem, PA in December of 1752.\n\nWednesday, January 31, 1753 – Bro. Van Vleck must have credit for cash which he paid on account of Zeisberger & Rundt to Captain Egbertse at Albany, which they borrowed of the latter on their return from Onondaga, £2, NY currency.\n\nWhat remains of the cemetery is the present private burying ground of the Adams family. I am informed by Dr. A.W.Van Slyke that according to tradition the old cemetery extended west from the present site to Coxsackie Creek, covering several acres. It was behind the church, parsonage and house of Benjamin Eaton (1884). The elders sold a small lot to Herman C. Adams of 2,160 sq.ft. being part of the parsonage land; included in the lot sold was a strip of 9 f. wide along the east bound to …..to the Coxsackie Creek. It must have covered…now preserved. When the deed of sale for the first lot was made out in 1882(?) it covered about 3 acres, most of which, if not all,…the former cemetery site. If a deed could be found covering the parsonage land, in the church in 1816, the description might enable…to approximate just how much John R Vanderbilt sold.\n\nAs has been said before, the old cemetery was behind the church, that is to say, it was behind the parsonage and house of Benjamin Eaton (1884). by deed dated October 8, 1871, the Minister, Elders, and Deacons of the First Reformed Church sold to Herman C. Adams a small lot containing 2160 sq. ft. being part of the parsonage land; including the lot sold was a strip of 9 feet in width, along the east bounds, extending south to the turnpike for an entrance; the consideration was $100. What Herman C. Adams did, after acquiring this land, has been the subject of more or less caustic comment from some of the old settlers in Coxsackie. But they overlook, or do not realize, what the Consistory had already allowed to happen to the markers and the graves which lay to the westward and northward, extending to the bank of the creek. They had allowed them to crumble and to sink and pass away into oblivion. Herman C. Adams restored his part of the cemetery to suit his own ends.\n\nThe real culprits, if any are to be blames for the so-called desecration, are the Consistory which conveyed the land. Perhaps it is unjust to censure the Consistory. Perhaps that Board of 1871 had in mind the fact, that their predecessors had already, through neglect, allowed a substantial part of the cemetery to disappear! Perhaps, they could foresee the calm and somnolent attitude of their successors, when 10 years or more later, they allowed also, the burying ground on the Globe land, back of the blacksmith shop, midway between the present church site and the West Shore railroad, to disappear! In my opinion, that Board of 1871 is to be commended for their foresight, in the realization that a quarter (or even an eighth) of the burying ground, is better than none! And for the benefit of the descendants of the old settlers of Coxsackie who regard Herman Cuyler Adams as a malefactor of great wealth, I will say that I have found the Adams burying ground a peaceful and delightful spot, neatly kept and carefully preserved. Very much in contrast to certain factory site, public dumping grounds, chicken yards, hog runs, and cattle pastures, formerly in use for the decent and respectful burial of our ancestors, that it has been my misfortune to view during the past seven years.\n\nMr. Adams oversaw the restoration of the burying ground. He selected such grave…as…the graves of his immediate family and his relations and set them aside for future use. He then caused a table or plateau to be raised in the form of a rectangle, which probably covered these graves. The raised ground brought the level of the graveyard about four or five feet above the waters of Coxsackie Creek, which winds its way on the west and north sides of the old cemetery site. In old days, no doubt the cemetery site was covered with trees, and which doubtless served to keep the creek within its bounds. Possibly when raising this mound, the earth was taken from the surrounding land. In any event, as I viewed it, I could see very little to keep the creek within its present bed, in case of a spring freshet. Thus, raising the level of the graveyard was very necessary to preserve it from future inroads of the creek. It was related to me that some of the old gravestones were buried, or covered with earth; and that others were used in the foundation of the mound, though I could see no evidence of this at present. The old driveway leading south to the turnpike was bordered by cedar trees; likewise cedar trees were set out along the edge of the restored rectangle. These trees are not about 50 years of age and have reached their full growth.\n\nThe whole burying ground and driveway are now surrounded by a substantial fence. The gravestones reserved for preservation were set up in three neat rows, due regard being given to secure the best arrangement as to relationships and family groups. A monument was erected to the memory of Henry Adams and his wife Agnes Egberts, whose graves probably were not disturbed; the gravestones of some of their children were set up in a trim row, before the monument. There have been but a few burials made in the graveyard, through which entrance is obtained. I made two attempts to copy the inscriptions on the gravestones, but was prevented from completing the work, by rain. Such as were copied in the extreme northwest corner, isolated; 4 and 5 are in the southwest corner, south of the curbed plot surrounding the Adams monument. There appears to be no reason why these stones were left as they were, unless it was because they marked undisturbed graves. I think it is extremely doubtful, if many of the remaining stones mark the original graves, unless there was a general disinternment and rearrangement of the bones and coffins, at the time that the plateau was constructed.\n\nInscriptions from cemetery:\n\nHenry Adams M.D. (7/6/1787-7/6/1857) my father\n\nAgnes Egberts (wife of Henry Adams M.D.) (4/5/1793-1/13/1861) my mother\n\nChildren of Henry & Agnes Adams\n\nEgbert Egberts, b. 11/20/1832 d. 7/24/1848\n\nEveline Maria (wife of Rev.
