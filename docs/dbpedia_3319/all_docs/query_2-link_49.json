        "text": "No news from the class this month.\n\nMy daughter, Abby, attended her 40th reunion and I’ll paraphrase her thoughts about Dartmouth. The campus looked great. She had not visited the College for the last 10 years and was impressed with all the new buildings, including the athletic facilities, dorms, and educational buildings. Her good friend Mary Conley stayed at one of the newer dorms and was impressed with the bedrooms and particularly the nice common spaces. Abby toured the new Class of 1982 Engineering and Science Center and thought it was fabulous and with 160,000 square feet had space for effective communications between these two disciplines.\n\nThey went to listen to a talk by Dartmouth’s new president, Sian Beilock, who was only in her sixth day on the job. She covered a number of goals, one of which was to work with the faculty and students to encourage more debate. Instead of “safe spaces,” President Beilock wants to develop “brave spaces” where people feel comfortable and confident in debating ideas.\n\nThe golf course has been converted in part to Pine Park, which you can see on your website under PinePark.org. Abby walked on several well-maintained trails, one of which went down to and along the Connecticut River, circling back to what used to be the third tee near Occom Pond.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nLansing G. Brisbin died January 1 in Naples, Florida. After completing a semester at Dartmouth in 1944, Lany joined the U.S. Marine Corps, completed basic training at Parris Island, and enrolled in a course of intensive Japanese language school, whereupon I believe he told me he was transferred to Germany in typical military style. At war’s end he resumed his studies at Dartmouth and met the love of his life, Joan Metzger, who was attending Middlebury College. They were married in 1949 and settled in Huntington, West Virginia, where Lany worked alongside his father in the family soft drink business until its sale in 1986.\n\nHe had many interests and pursuits and was a natural athlete, excelling in multiple sports, including skiing, football, baseball, badminton, golf, polo, and others, but his lifelong passion was tennis. With Joan, also a ranked player, Lany competed in many tournaments throughout his life, winning his last singles title at age 90. He was the coach of Marshall University men’s team and a mentor and teacher to many players, young and old, and a driving force beyond the growth of tennis in the local community. He loved the outdoors and could often be found exploring, hiking, and whitewater canoeing anywhere nature called.\n\nWhile at Dartmouth he received training in archaeology that instilled in him an inquisitiveness that culminated in his discovery of the ceremonial stone structure Serpent Mound in Catlettsburg, Kentucky.\n\nMusic was a thread through his years since childhood. With a beautiful tenor and baritone voice, he regaled everyone with songs across numerous genres, and he knew all the verses. He taught himself to play several instruments, including the guitar, concertina, and banjo. His favorite was a harmonica, which he always carried with him, and could strike up a tune anytime anywhere. But he didn’t always need an instrument and he loved to whistle and could even yodel. He also dabbled in sketching and watercolor painting and even tried his hand at writing poetry, perhaps influenced by working for the poet Robert Frost while at Dartmouth. He would surround himself with intellectuals to discuss his various interest or help to work on his foreign language skills, including Spanish, French, and German in addition to Japanese.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nNo new news to report, but I regret we have recently lost two class members.\n\nHenry H. Woodward Jr. died October 31, 2022, of complications from Covid. Hank was commissioned in 1945. He was called back for Korea and finally released as a lieutenant. At Dartmouth he was a premed major and stayed on campus for an M.A. in geology. He joined the U.S. Geological Survey and became the geologist for the State of Maine Development Commission in 1950. He earned a geology Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1955. He moved to Beloit College, where he soon advanced to chairman of the geology department, a position he held from 1957 to 1987. Hank and his wife, Helen, had two children and three grandchildren. He remembered good times at Dartmouth, including intramural hockey and baseball, skiing, and some hunting. He said that Dartmouth made possible many of the good things that made up his life. He was supportive of the College, and I had several pleasant conversations with him during recent years.\n\nEdward C. Curtis died October 1, 2022. Ed joined the class in 1944 and subsequently went into the Navy. Returning to campus, he became a member of Gamma Delta Chi, the band, Barbary Coast, and the Handel Society and majored in music. Following graduation he got into the consumer finance business and made it his career. He and his wife, Henrietta, had three children and four grandchildren. They moved to Florida in 1957 and remained there the rest of his life. He enjoyed golf and fishing.\n\nHope you all had happy holidays. While we miss our home in Clinton, New York, living outside of New York City we see much more of the family, which is a convenience to them and nice for all of us. We gather in July at Joyce’s family house in Ocean City, New Jersey, where we rent a couple of condos and average about 17 for dinner during a week or so. It has gotten to be a tradition and it’s nice the family wants to be together.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nWhile it’s hard to get class information for our notes, they are scanned and I hear back from time to time. I had a nice note from Dick Ruston, who wrote, “I am a 1973 Dartmouth alumnus living in Alaska and just finished reading your 1948 July-August 2022 Class Notes in the alumni magazine (devoted to notable humorous exchanges 60-odd years ago). Wonderful quotes and indeed better reading about them living in retirement homes. Thanks for brightening my day. I am a mostly retired business lawyer in Anchorage who remains active hiking, skiing, reading, and traveling. I have been ski patrolling for more than 50 years, which all started at the Dartmouth Skiway. Have a wonderful day.”\n\nHaving no news from the class I’ll touch on some points Bud Munson brought up in his very interesting September class newsletter.\n\nDartmouth joins Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Amherst as the only academic institutions in the United States to grant scholarships to all national and international students as needed to cover all costs (tuition, board, and room) for all four years of study. The administration will assess how much each family can reasonably contribute, then grant scholarships to cover the financial shortfall. Dartmouth’s Call to Lead campaign at this reading has raised $3.3 billion in gifts and pledges. Very remarkable.\n\nThe massive renovation and expansion of Hopkins Center is scheduled for completion in 2025. The main auditorium will remain open for musical events, although much of the Hop will be closed during construction. As of this reading alumni and friends including theater and film personalities have already contributed $50 million toward an estimated $88-million cost.\n\nWe currently have 34 classmates still with us. As Bud indicated regretfully, the three class officers—Bud, myself, and Warren Daniell—agree that it would be wise to close 1948 as an active class after the 75th reunion next September.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nOur class president Bud Munson is doing well and handling all the details required by the College to sustain a class. Following are his comments on what’s going on at Dartmouth in Hanover. Utilizing land from the golf course approximately 1 mile north of campus, the College plans to build housing for 400 students, probably in three dormitories. This would not be suitable for freshmen, who need to absorb more of the college and town environment. It will require shuttle buses. Although Thayer Hall will continue to be fully engaged, the residential units will have kitchenettes available, which Bud says it is a trend in colleges today. The approximate $40-million internal renovation of Dartmouth Hall should be completed by your reading. The next major renovation in the same order of magnitude will be for Hopkins Center.\n\nAfter 46 years as a coeducational college, Dartmouth has a new president, Sian Leah Beilock. She is a cognitive scientist with a strong administrative background as a provost and then as president of Barnard College, which is affiliated with Columbia University. She sounds like a great choice.\n\nAlvin Everett Gilbert died July 11, 2006, in South Paris, Maine, we have just learned. Al joined the Navy and trained as a pilot during World War II. He studied at the University of North Carolina and Dartmouth (probably V- 12) and in 1950 graduated from the University of Maine, Orono. He joined the U.S. Department of Agriculture, serving 30 years, 17 as a diplomat in the U.S. Foreign Service traveling and working throughout Latin America, Africa, and Asia. After retiring in 1982 he returned to his hometown of Danville, Maine, with his wife, Jane, and family of five children and became actively involved in the nearby Auburn community.\n\nDonald J. Graham Jr. died October 8, 2021, in Seattle at the age of 98. At Dartmouth Don was a member of Phi Delta Alpha/Phi and received his A.B. in 1949. In 1952 he earned his J.D. from the University of Washington. He is survived by sons Donald III and Frederick.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nWith the passing of John VanRaalte on May 7, the class and Dartmouth lost a stalwart supporter. He attended virtually every class reunion and was past president and class secretary for many years and a member of the executive committee at his death. At an early age John became an expert equestrian, excelling at jumping, polo, dressage, and hunt competitions, interests he pursued for a lifetime. He attended St. Louis Country Day School, served in the U.S. Navy, then took his degree at Dartmouth. John played varsity tennis and squash and was the best golfer at all our outings. He worked for a number of investment firms on Wall Street and was active well into his 80s.\n\nFollowing are comments from my daughter, Penny ’77, from her class reunion, where she attended only the outside events except for the Hood Museum, which she thought was great. It has a wider selection of prominent works of art, including several paintings by Frank Dial, a prominent Black painter, two Rembrandt drawings, and a Georgia O’Keeffe landscape. The Dartmouth campus looks good, and all the new buildings work well with the older architecture. After years of negotiations the Occom papers were returned to his tribe. As coincidentally confirmed in The Wall Street Journal, Dartmouth is eliminating student loans and replacing them with grants. For Saturday evening a huge stage was built in the center of the Green for performers singing and dancing. There were closing fireworks. The band was called the Dartmouth Idol All Stars and was terrific. While everybody had a great time most had not brought any winter clothing and wore multi layers. (I remember coming out one night from a hockey game at our unheated Davis rink and reading the thermometer at minus-30 degrees.) Rooms were available at the government house for disparate interest groups. Women from the first three classes of 1976 through 1978 met there to reminisce and discuss their trials and tribulations during that transitional period, for which Dartmouth really wasn’t prepared.\n\nGive me your thoughts. I’ll use everything that’s fit to print.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nUnder the heading of “When insults had class,” John Price was kind enough to pass along to me “these glorious insults from an era before the English language got boiled down to four-letter words.” I thought they were more fun than talking about living in retirement homes.\n\n“He had delusions of adequacy,” said Walter Kerr.\n\n“He had all the virtues I dislike and none of the vices I admire,” said Winston Churchill.\n\n“He has never been known to use a word that might send a reader to the dictionary,” said William Faulkner about Ernest Hemingway.\n\n“Thank you for sending me a copy of your book; I’ll waste no time reading it,” said Moses Hadas.\n\n“He has no enemies, but is intentionally disliked by his friends,” said Oscar Wilde.\n\n“I am enclosing two tickets to the first night of my new play: bring a friend if you have one,” said George Bernard Shaw to Winston Churchill. “Cannot possibly attend the first night, will attend second if there is one,” said Winston Churchill in response.\n\n“I feel so miserable without you; it’s almost like having you here,” said Stephen Bishop.\n\n“He is a self-made man and worships his creator,” said John Bright.\n\n“Some cause happiness whenever they go, others whenever they leave,” said Oscar Wilde.\n\n“He used statistics as a drunken man uses a lamppost for support rather than illumination,” said Andrew Lang.\n\n“He has Van Gogh’s ear for music,” said Billy Wilder.\n\n“I’ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but I’m afraid this wasn’t it,” said Groucho Marx.\n\nPlease send me any information you might have that you think will be fun or of interest to the class.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nWarren Daniell advises, “Everything is okay here, if you can call being 95 and 93 okay. We are both using walkers when out of our two-room ‘suite,’ canes while in it. The atmosphere in Newbury Court is great, despite the fact that a healthy majority of the 80 or so male residents claim degrees from either Harvard or MIT. We’re here, of course, because it’s only three miles from our Concord, Massachusetts, home of 50 years and we still enjoy many local contacts. Like many others, moving in involved a healthy down payment, but with 90 percent to be returned upon departure.”\n\nFoster J. DeGiacomo, a longtime Concord, New Hampshire, resident died February 16. Fos enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in March 1943, did his boot camp training on Parris Island, and went to an advanced aviation radio school and then to an officer training program at the University of Rochester. Discharged in 1946, he earned his degree at Dartmouth and took advanced work at Boston University College of Engineering, concentrating on aerospace. He spent the next 25 years with Raytheon in the Boston area designing and building missiles before moving to California with North American Aviation to work on the Apollo space program. Fos then returned to the Boston area to work with Raytheon and then the U.S. Air Force at Hanscom, Massachusetts, for 18 years with the Army-Airforce joint stars airborne ground surveillance program. He was an instructor at Northeastern University for many years and a long-term member of the Concord Rod and Gun Club and the Hanscom Aero Club. His wife, Nancy, died in 2016. He is survived by his second wife, Christine, and several children and grandchildren.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (791) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nJohn Price was nice enough to send me an email, which I’ll quote to you. “Barbara and I have been together for 27 years. We got married four years ago and find that we’re even closer than before. Barbara is a retired teacher and now a docent at our local art museum. Her work is very limited because of the pandemic. Last year I retired after 64 years of practicing child and adult psychiatry. I’m playing tennis several times a week with a bunch of 80-year-olds who should know better. It’s good exercise.\n\n“We have a large flower garden, and I specialize in growing and hybridizing daylilies. Here they bloom mostly from mid-June to the end of July. I wanted more to bloom in August so I started to hybridize them with that goal in mind. Fifteen years ago I began making crosses starting at the end of July and continuing through August so that most of their offspring would bloom in August. Now my daylilies bloom all summer long! When I want to make a cross between two daylilies, I snip off a stamen from one (at the end of the stamen is the anther, which is covered with pollen) flower and rub the pollen against the tip of the pistil of a flower on the other plant. Amazingly, cells in the pollen extend down the pistil to the base of the flower, where the eggs are. If they fertilize—about half the time—egg seeds develop. I then harvest the seedpods about six to eight weeks later and plant the seeds outdoors the next spring.\n\n“Lastly, we play bridge. During the pandemic we started playing with friends on the internet on a site called Bridgebase. What a tough game! We both have our booster shots and are beginning to play bridge in person and go to restaurants. We are both very troubled by the increasing polarization in our politics and hope our country can become more reasonable.\n\n“I look forward to our 75th and hope to see many of you there!”\n\nI look forward to hearing from you on anything you would like to talk about—from Dartmouth to daylilies. Silence is not golden!\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Unit 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nDick and Dottie Dahl have moved to a large retirement community in Skillman, New Jersey, just north of Princeton. They are both doing well and getting their regular exercise walking. They are located close to family and friends, who read to Dottie, who has trouble with her short vision. As well as two great-grandchildren, they have grandchildren in a nearby grammar school from a late-blooming family with a 50-year-old father.\n\nThese large assisted living and continuous care communities have a variety of financial structures. Dick’s requires a sizable fee up front and a monthly rental with no ownership. The Kendal developments sell the condos with your equity reduced monthly until it zeros out in a few years. Ours in New Providence, New Jersey, is run by Erickson, which operates nationally and like the others charges a monthly fee but agrees to return 90 percent of the price charged for the unit when you leave. This goes through a third-party and there is no ownership involved. Financial responsibility is very tricky.\n\nHarland Hoisington of Norwich, Vermont, died August 12, 2021. While we lost touch in later years, Bernie was very active in our class through 1989 and was a class officer, newsletter editor (1974-88), and reunion chairman (1984-85). Sons Steven and Paul were Dartmouth 1970 and 1976, respectively. Bernie graduated from Dartmouth after an interruption from the U.S. Army, which initially planned to send him to Japan and taught him Japanese, though sent him to Germany instead. He spent many years in investment advising and became one of the first financial officers at Columbia University. Later he became director of financial aid at Dartmouth. Son Paul and his wife, Mary, currently live in Hanover.\n\n—David Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 233, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nI was able to reach John VanRaalte at the Becher Nursing Home in Ossining, New York (914-941-730), where he is recovering from a broken hip. He is doing well but will be there for some time. John’s probably our most versatile athlete lettering in squash and tennis at Dartmouth, best golfer at our reunions, and most remarkably an accomplished polo player. Bobo Russell’swidow, Barbara, called to send the class a film she had just found of our 10th reunion that she had been asked for years ago. She is still living in the same old house and enjoying the view over the Hudson River. Her daughter lives nearby and does all her shopping and her two sons visit occasionally. She is doing well and walks every day.\n\nBud Munson, Ellie Huke, and Judy Cross, who was John Hatheway’scompanion for a number of years, are the last Hanover area residents involved with our class and still get together for an occasional monthly lunch. Judy broke her hip this year but sounds fine and is handling this and her balance problem with “lots of physical therapy.” The best way to reach her is using Kendal’s base number, 603-643-8900.\n\nRonald I. Spiers died June 24 in Exeter, New Hampshire. He was a distinguished career diplomat who had a long involvement with the Dickey Center. He retired in 1992 with two Presidential Distinguished Executive Service awards and the honorary rank of career ambassador awarded by the president and the U.S. Senate that is reserved for a small number of career officers who have served with distinction in the highest positions of the foreign service. He was the highest-ranking American citizen in the UN secretariat. I covered his remarkable career in more detail in recent Class Notes.\n\nGordon K. Mann died July 1 in Meredith, New Hampshire. He graduated from Milton (New Hampshire) High School, received an A.B. from Dartmouth and an M.Ed. from Boston University. He also studied mathematics at the University of New Hampshire, University of Vermont, and Louisiana State University. He served in the U.S. Army in 1945 and 1946. Gordon came to Conway, New Hampshire, in 1950 and taught mathematics at Kennett High School for some 30 years. He also coached baseball, football, basketball, and softball and was inducted into the N.H. Coaching Hall of Fame. Hiking, travel, and photography became his hobbies and during his lifetime he visited 73 countries.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nJoyce and I had a very nice visit with Caroline Hall ’24, the granddaughter of one of our condo neighbors. She entered Dartmouth in the fall of 2020 and completed her freshman year this spring. I was told, and she confirmed, that she loves Dartmouth and considers it “a happy place,” despite all the pandemic restrictions that were in place. Contacts were kept to an absolute minimum and when she arrived at Fayerweather, her assigned dormitory, she was told she had 15 minutes to be upstairs in her room with all her belongings. She was allowed only one visitor at a time. New arrivals were quarantined for two weeks. All classes were virtual through the spring quarter, and she met only a couple of professors when they were outside on the grass. She felt the classes were still interesting and there was a good verbal interaction between the professors and the class. The former were available by computer during their office hours. Freshmen attended Dartmouth in person in the fall and spring quarters, and at the end of each term had to move everything out of their rooms so the College could juggle incoming students from other classes. Space is still a problem and, as of this writing, the College is looking to encourage 200 students with a $5,000 offer to live off campus this fall term. Only half of the students have been on campus during the last several quarters, but the College is hopeful to have campus fully reopened this fall. When asked what she liked about the college, Carolyn mentioned the rural location and the excellent integration between Dartmouth and the town of Hanover. Interestingly, as the shops and restaurants opened there were some restrictions on students shopping and dining in town. She enjoyed kayaking on the river and taking a number of short DOC hikes. She liked the classes and the people.\n\nNo news from you guys or widows, whom I always like to hear from, but I look for some contacts for my next notes.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nConsidering incorrect addresses, we are now down to around 30 reachable, active class members. Class Notes are probably our best means of reaching them and others who scan these notes. After some 10 years on the job, I am no longer reaching out to contact class members for detailed information, which is mostly redundant as we are now doing little traveling. I am very interested in hearing from you guys on any subject you would like to touch on regarding you and your progenies, thoughts on the College, or anything else you would like to cover. Using the below addresses you can send me a message, just dictate an email, or give me a holler on the phone. You don’t have to do any of the high-tech stuff with which your children and grandchildren are so comfortable. I also read letters with enthusiasm.\n\nIn November 2019 Joyce and I moved into a retirement community to be near our family, and a week or two later flew down to our winter golfing community in Naples, Florida, where we still are at this writing. With our two shots behind us we should be home shortly. Understandably, the difference between the two communities in handling the Covid are remarkable. While both require masks and spacing, the golfing community is much more aggressive in providing meals with entertainment. During the epidemic they have built courts and established strong programs for pickle ball, bocce, and croquet. Tennis and golf are normal except for allowing single golf carts.\n\nGlen B. Peck Jr. died December 26, 2020. A lifelong resident of Cambridge and Belmont, Massachusetts, he was a graduate in 1944 of Cambridge High and Latin School, where he was president of the class and a member of the hockey team. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II in the Pacific theater. After graduating from Dartmouth he went to the Northeastern Law School, where he received his J.D. After a brief law career he pursued his passion to teach children. He taught elementary school in the Cambridge school system for more than 40 years. Glenn was a tireless teacher, sub master, and president of the Cambridge Teachers Association. He is survived by his wife, Maureen, and their four children. Daughter Carolyn and husband Marco live in Hanover.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave, Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nMort Smith advised that he and Nan are doing well and are reasonably mobile but staying closer to home. They are used to traveling and following the sun in the winter. They spent two months a year for 15 years in Marco Island, which is just off the coast of Naples, Florida, and subsequently three months for seven years in Green Valley, Arizona, between Tucson and Nogales, Mexico, which is blessed with a cooling altitude of some 3,000 feet. Mort stressed they both were great places to walk in the winter. Their current home for 23 years is Melvin Village, New Hampshire, just nine miles from Lake Winnipesaukee, where there is a family home where everyone gathers in the summer. They have a continuing Dartmouth tradition with a son and grandson in the classes of ’73 and ’01.\n\nIn his January letter to me, our head agent Warren Daniell had some interesting comments that I would like to excerpt and pass along to you: “With the class now numbering only 36, it is heartening that the gifting of you and others (including as many widows as classmates) shows that we are still valued members of the Dartmouth community and even more than that we respect what Dartmouth has meant to us through the years. The 75th reunion will arrive in a couple of years. I would like to be there, but both Dot and I have had recent operations which, along with Covid-19, currently restrict our mobility. My father, Dartmouth class of 1922, was able to enjoy his 75th and it would be nice to be able to do the same.” Warren, we certainly hope you can and look forward to seeing you there.\n\nRobert F. Wieler died January 2 this year. Bob came to Dartmouth during World War II and left to serve as a Navy radio operator in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters. His ship participated in the landing at Okinawa. After the war he attended Stetson University, graduating in 1949. He earned a master’s in personnel administration at the University of Pittsburgh and then joined the Royal Insurance Co. for a long career, retiring as vice president of personnel in 1988. He was active in the U.S. Air Force Reserve for many years, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. He and Sally married in 1960 and settled in Long Island, New York, to raise their family until her death in 2018. Bob was an enthusiastic sportsman and played tennis singles until well into his 80s.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nNot much going on in our class right now with our diminishing vigor and with Covid, traveling and visiting is at a minimum. Our fully funded scholar-athlete award is suspended until the Ivies resume competition. Our president, Bud Munson, hopes to keep the class operative until the 75th reunion, which reminds me of some of the nice physical things we have left the College. We continue to support our rocking chairs on the porch of the Hanover Inn for the next five years and, I hope, in perpetuity. The program we established with the Hood Museum is noted by a plaque there. We have a recent chair on the north end of the campus south of Hitchcock. Last and probably least, but one of my favorites, is a little garden in front of Crosby that gets overgrown and which I weeded out on two mini-reunions.\n\nNeil Gilbert, professor emeritus at University of California Davis (UCD), passed away last April. He completed his A.B. at Dartmouth, where he enjoyed hiking and camping with the Outing Club, and a Ph.D. at Columbia in the history of philosophy. Neil went on to teach at North Carolina State College, Cornell, Columbia, the University of Buffalo, and UCD, where he helped establish a religious studies major. In 1968 he received a Guggenheim fellowship, which he considered one of his life’s highlights, to research manuscripts and ancient libraries of Europe.\n\nJerome H. Zins died October 4, 2020, with his wife of 68 years, Edith, at his side. After graduating from Dartmouth, where he was a member of Pi Lambda Phi, and New York University Medical School, Jerry joined the U.S. Air Force. He went on to a fulfilling career in private practice as an internist specializing in cardiology. He raised his family of four children in Short Hills, New Jersey. While he had strong instincts and opinions, he was always open-minded in lively discussions and willing to listen and learn.\n\nDonald H. Smith died November 12, 2019. He was a member of the French Club and Jack-o-Lantern at Dartmouth, where he earned his A.B. before earning an M.C.S. at Tuck in 1949. He subsequently earned an M.B.A. at Stanford in 1954.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nAnn Briggs lives in Rochester, New York, and was able to attend a number of our mini-reunions. She sent us a nice note advising how much she enjoyed them and always felt the widows were welcomed by the class. They indeed were, and it was good to hear from her.\n\nHugh Ettinger wrote, “Nothing much going on in New Orleans. I’ve been sheltering in place with a bull’s-eye upon the back. I suppose everybody in late middle age (a nice euphemism) is doing the same thing.” Hugh was V-12 at Dartmouth and I’ll quote an abbreviated version of his fun remembrances: “Seeing the obituary of William B. Enright ’47 took me back. The Navy assigned us to dorm rooms by the first letter of our last names. In my room at Massachusetts Hall and in the next rooms were Eberly, Enright, Ettinger, Eddy, Elmer, and jolly Carl Evans from Nashua, New Hampshire. He was one of our linemen when Dartmouth played Notre Dame. He had barely been first string in Nashua and here he was staring up at a large fresh-faced gorilla on every play. I remember Don Alvarez, a guard from Chicago, who lived down the hall. They called him ‘watch-charm guard.’ Here we were, fresh out of high school, 17 to 19 years old, never having been much away from home. My home was on the south shore of Long Island. Eddy came from New Jersey, Bill Enright from Queens, New York. He had a good buddy from Queens, Al Kaplan, who later commanded a ship of some sort. We all wound up in the Pacific; Bill Enright on a cruiser, I think, where he served with a guy named Weld who was a big man on campus at Dartmouth after the war. Bill Enright was a charismatic guy. The atmosphere in a room would light up when he walked in. It’s hard to pin down but there are people like that. After college Bill went to California and enrolled in law school. He worked in one of the district attorney offices in southern California and then President Nixon made him a federal judge. He was a skinny guy in college. I visited him in his office in San Diego maybe 30 years ago. He had put on weight but was still the same guy—charismatic and fun to be with.”\n\nJoyce and I are still hunkered down at our Naples, Florida, condo and plan to come back north in April, I hope properly vaccinated. While I enjoy the golf, summer in southern Florida is difficult. Every day is the same, even as of this writing in mid-October, with temperatures in the upper 80s or low 90s, high humidity, and thunderstorms forecast every afternoon.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nI had a nice chat with Bud Munson, our president and general factotum and only class member still living in the Hanover area. He received a nice note from Bob Herrick’s widow, Margaret, who says she is still active living in their house in La Jolla, California, and just this year was having someone handling the gardening. Pete Foster told Bud he and Anne are very satisfied with their retirement home in Haddam, Connecticut, but commented most of the residents were widows.\n\nAt this writing apparently half the classes at Dartmouth will be virtual. Tricky, particularly for foreign students. Thayer School has completed its major construction, and Bud’s reaction is that the last building looks like a medieval fortress. That area reminds me of the main campus at Duke, which is one large building after another around a rectangular mall with a little grass on which you’re not allowed to walk. Dartmouth says the shortage of land and an annual seven-figure loss are causing the closing of the golf course. We are purportedly a rural campus in a charming town and this diminishes the school. It’s a shame.\n\nI have talked about Jerry Wensinger in this column and know he is only recently retired as professor emeritus of German and the humanities at Wesleyan College. He is shown on the internet as having written 33 works (including several books) in 100 publications in three languages. He met Wallace Bradway ’47 at Dartmouth and they became close friends until Wallace died this year and left his estate to the College, which asked Jerry for his written comments, which I am briefly excerpting. Wallace had the highest grade-point average in his class at Dartmouth, was an avid reader, and joined the Chicago Art Institute later in his career. Wallace and Jerry kept in touch, as they both had summer homes in New Hampshire, and in the 1970s and 1980s traveled to Italian apartments in Florence, Venice, and then Rome. Wallace retired earlier than Jerry and for the last 25 years entertained friends in his large apartment just outside of Yale University. Jerry comments, “Wallace was a kind, modest gentleman; a person of abundant good cheer, deep intelligence, simple tastes; a brilliant conversationalist; someone for whom the guest invariably came first; and generous to a fault. It took a while to get to know him, but the wait was invariably repaid in manifold ways.“\n\nThis indeed speaks well of both parties.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nWe moved last November to a retirement community in northern New Jersey and a couple of weeks later went down to our winter golf condo in Naples, Florida. Due to Covid-19, we’re still there at this writing. Best way to reach me is through our email and cell phone number below.\n\nSonny “Rem” Drury died from Covid-19 in May. He enjoyed talking with people and as our chronicler handled Class Notes for many years. He and Colin Stewart, who went on to the Olympics, were brought up in Hanover and anchored the championship Dartmouth ski team.\n\nSonny traveled the world for Gulf Oil, ending up in Houston, where, virtually blind and tapping his cane, he commuted from home to work by bus until his retirement. His wife, Joan, passed away last year. His daughter, Susan, was able to spend some time with him before he died and noted how, as always, he was uncomplaining, patient, and appreciative of others.\n\nBob Pilsbury died of Covid-19 May 12 in the Bedford, Massachusetts, VA hospital. He was brought up and went to school in Newton, Massachusetts, and was drafted into the Army during his freshman year at Dartmouth. He went to officer candidate school and served with valor as a lieutenant during the Korean War, during which he was awarded three Bronze stars.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his father and a cousin, Bob was a natural-born piano player. At family outings the three of them would play one after the other their own improvisations of popular and older songs and melodies. Music was his passion, and after Dartmouth he went on to study at the New England Conservatory of Music and then take a master’s from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. During these years and while he was establishing a psychotherapy practice, he was a part of the jazz scene in Boston. He then joined the nationally known Black Eagle Jazz Band for the mainstay of his music career.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nI received a thoughtful note from Chip Gedney ’70 that his mother, Ginny, passed away April 3 in her sleep at the Greenwich (Connecticut) Nursing Home, where she lived for the past five years. For many years she and Bud Gedney hosted Sunday brunch at our annual mini-reunions. Joyce and I remember their home in the country outside of Hanover off a very rural road in the woods with a lovely meadow replete with a huge and fortunately very friendly dog. They served a grand repast and the get-together was always a highlight to our weekend.\n\nI’d sure like to hear from any of you guys or gals on what you may be doing, what your progeny are doing, and any memories you’d like to pass along. You can reach me by phone, cell message, or email as listed below. Not the latest technology, but adequate for our generation. During the years I have avoided listing recently deceased class members because they are listed in DAM, but because my phone calls to active members are becoming redundant, I’ll comment on personal aspects on some of these obituaries.\n\nRobert D. Eckerson died January 27. He joined the Navy at age 17, learned to fly a Stearman biplane, and was a member of the Navy V-5 and V-12 at Dartmouth, earning his Thayer degree in 1949. His sister, Margaret, introduced him to Arlene Linder, a beautiful Swedish girl from New York City whom he married in 1948. They had two children and were married for 66 years until her death in 2014. They loved to explore the world together, traveling to six continents and memorably, with their children in the back of a newly purchased Volkswagen Beetle, driving across Germany, France, Sweden, and the winding roads of the Alps. In addition to his engineering career, Bob was a meticulous woodworker and built furniture and beautiful trim work. He also designed one of their houses.\n\nJeremy M. Copleston died December 11, 2019. He enlisted in the Navy in 1945 and, after graduating from Dartmouth, found his calling as a self-taught engineer. He and Joyce were married for 65 years. After retirement he served as a Coxsackie, New York, councilman and worked on building the Vedder Library. He was a lifetime member of the Coxsackie Yacht Club. He thoroughly enjoyed tending to the farm, hunting, flying, skiing, snowmobiling, and boating. Bob showed a great love for all animals, large and small.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nI had a cheerful conversation with John VanRaalte and his son and daughter. John doesn’t have his usual vigor but is hanging in there. It reminded me of a fun letter I received from Jim Field ’45. He remembers playing John in a challenge match set up by coach Red Hoehn for tennis team position the day before the first match in 1946. Showing how mixed our ages were due to the war, Jim was no callow youth at that point. He had been at Dartmouth for 18 months and then spent three years in the Army Air Corps as a fighter pilot, returning to William & Mary because, “I didn’t want no boys college no more.” After one year, however, he called Dean Neidlinger, who allowed him to come back to Dartmouth, where he graduated from Tuck School in 1948.\n\nI noticed in Frederic “Tad” Comstock’s obituary that he joined the U.S. Marine Corps, where he served with an engineering demolition unit during the battle of Iwo Jima, where, with Okinawa, more than 20,000 troops were lost in 1945. By then our submarine fleet had virtually eliminated Japanese shipping and their Air Force was history except for the kamikaze attacks. Nonetheless, our military had made plans to invade Japan. As part of the occupying forces, I walked the beach where I was told my outfit, the 112th Regimental combat team attached to the 1st Cavalry Division, was supposed to land. It was enfiladed on both sides by high cliffs honeycombed with gun emplacements.\n\nWe also recently lost Foxy Parker, a very nice, modest man who was class treasurer, member of the executive committee, and attendee of all our reunions. He regularly visited his daughters in Colorado, who noted, “The Parker family first went to Vail [Colorado] for a spring break ski trip in 1968 and Foxy fell in love with March’s bluebird skies and deep powder. His swooping descents in Stein Erickson style were a treat to watch. He took his last runs at the age of 89, swooping a little more carefully but with the same joy as ever.”\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Unit 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nClass of 1948 scholarship-athlete awards for 2019 were James Foye ’20 for basketball and Cha’Mia Rothwell ’20 for track. James started all 30 games as a junior and was one of the top three scorers for Dartmouth. He is an economics major with a 3.96 GPA. Cha’Mia is a psychology major and an academic all-American with a 3.67 GPA. She was two-time Ivy League champion in the long jump and six-time champion in the hurdles. She was twice named most outstanding performer in the Ivy indoor championships. Winners used to join us at our mini-reunions, but we may have had our last mini, as it was cancelled last year for lack of attendance. Pat McAllister has been an honorary member of our class and run a very active and successful widow’s program for many years, with widows representing an increasing portion of our reunion attendees. She is no longer able to handle this program, which apparently will not continue without her. On behalf of the class and myself I would like to extend our appreciation of all the time and effort she has extended for us. Pat, you’ve been great!\n\nThrough the years I have casually kept abreast of class members downsizing into retirement communities. Last year Joyce and I decided to do it, as all four of our daughters were 250 miles or more away from Clinton, New York. Sorting out all the details and coordinating various responsibilities was extremely time consuming. While we ended up outside of New York City, we spent some time in Boston and had a great time at the Harvard-Dartmouth game, where to our pleased surprise we were late because they had an estimated attendance of more than 20,000. We bought tickets and without looking at them walked up to the last row of the stadium and over to about the 35-yard line. It turned out that by the end of the first half much of the Dartmouth student body had the same idea and we were in the middle of the noisiest rooting section. It was like being back in the 1940s, and while we had to stand up in the second half, it was great fun. The ending was incredible. We turned the ball over twice in the last five minutes and with about two or three minutes to play, Harvard had first and 10 on our 4-yard line. With no timeouts left we got the ball back on the 8-yard line. Getting the ball to about the 50 with a couple of fourth-down passes was as remarkable as the final six-second hail Mary. Unfortunately, we lose our 250-pound running quarterback next year. I guess his injury caused us problems at both Cornell and Brown. However, a half a loaf is better than none.\n\nSend me stuff. I don’t review basketball games.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nI received a very nice note from John Price, who wrote, “On our drive home from Florida in April we stopped in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to see Sam Katz and his wife, Kathy. I hadn’t seen Sam since Dartmouth Medical School 69 years ago. Kathy, who is also a retired pediatrician, mentioned that she had traveled to Africa 60 times in her work with children. Barbara and I got married two years ago. We had been together for 22 years and figured it was about time. Barbara is a retired teacher and has been a docent at our local art museum for several years. I continue my private practice of psychiatry two days a week. The rest of my time in the summer is divided between tennis and gardening. I specialize in hybridizing daylilies. In the winter I play tennis and paint abstract art. I chose abstract because I can’t draw people worth a damn. I have many fond memories of Dartmouth and look forward to our next reunion.”\n\nWarren Daniell advises that he and Dot regularly visited their daughter, Beth ’77, twice a year but were unable to do so in 2019. Beth recently retired after a successful career with the Oregon Department of Revenue and was able to visit with her parents for 10 days last October. They moved to Newbury Court retirement home in Concord, Massachusetts, last year and went through the daunting task of selling and downsizing their residence after 50 years from 10 rooms to two rooms. Warren said it was time to make the move, which was successful in every way. His new hip has decreased his mobility and eliminated his customary golfing and jogging. Warren has been a very successful head agent for the Dartmouth College Fund since 2008. Warren noted that he came to Dartmouth from Millinocket, Maine, in the summer of 1944 for one semester, then spent two years in the Navy studying and becoming an electronics technical mate. He returned in 1946 to complete his education at Dartmouth and Thayer in 1949 and 1950. He married Dot in 1951 and then joined Anderson-Nichols, a Boston-based architectural engineering firm where he eventually became co-partner. They sold the business in 1999 to Dewberry, a large national company. Warren continued as a consultant for six years before retiring.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 603 Mountain Ave., Apt. 331, New Providence, NJ 07974; (781) 801-2716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nReceived a lovely note from Ellen Springstreen.She heard from Bob Eckerson that he had recently fallen and had to move to an assisted living facility. He is slowly on the mend and looking forward to our 75th reunion, as does Ellen, who enjoyed the 70th. Her granddaughter, Jess Menville ’16, is a first lieutenant in the Marine Corps and was recently home after a seven-month deployment. Ellen didn’t know Lou until his time as a student at New Brunswick Seminary, but understood his love of Dartmouth and commented on his activities there from letters she recently uncovered. Like many of us he came to Dartmouth in the summer of 1944. It was broiling, and he and his roommate, Bob Kirkpatrick, moved from room 302 to 114 at Wheeler at an increase of $10 a month because it was lower and cooler. Lou attended a lecture by Robert Frost and commented, “First half very interesting, but the second half I spent petting his Collie.” He sent the laundry home weekly and enjoyed the goodies that were always in the returned crate. He was drafted in January 1945, served in the Army in Germany, and returned to Dartmouth in the fall of 1946.\n\nI got a call from Mort Thalhimer ’46 (graduated in 1948, Navy V5 flier), who said my recent comment on the Army shirt (explained below) reminded him of a recent visit he got from a woman who had a Navy summer jacket with his name on the collar that she wanted to keep as memorabilia. To make it more complete he found a set of shoulder boards and wings for her. As for my Army shirt tale: Army always kept its squash courts very hot because this made for longer, exhausting rallies. In our match at Dartmouth, the unheated courts were well below freezing. If you dropped a ball from your waist it wouldn’t bounce above your ankle. I kept the points short, made lots of finishing shots, and the match was over before my opponent or the ball warmed up. Following Army-Navy custom, he offered me his shirt and said it was the first match he had lost. I declined the shirt and observed with only a little poetic license that it was the first I’d won.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nAlthough he formally retired in 1994, Jerry Wensinger still has anoffice at Wesleyan University, where he was the Taft Professor of German Language and Literature and also a professor of humanities. He has continued to translate numerous books, mostly in art history, from German to English. Every other year he attends and submits articles in English and German to a literary symposium in Austria. With his godson-in-law he founded the Candlewood Farm (where he lives) Arts Foundation, which offers architectural seminars and classical music concerts specializing in guitar works. When I spoke with him he was attending a performance that evening with musicians from Holland and China. Jerry tends a large vegetable garden and works on his 100-acre property, which is a mixed blessing, as he had just come down with a case of poison ivy. He has set up a conservation easement for his land so that it will remain in its present state and not be developed. He said he has enjoyed his life and considers himself lucky and happy.\n\nMelvin and Helen Neisloss are doing well except that his travel is curtailed by arthritic knees and they missed their niece’s wedding in Portugal this year. Coincidentally, two of their three daughters, Emily ’81 and Liz ’83, were at Dartmouth together with our daughter, Abby ’82. (Except for one in Washington, D.C., our four daughters are about 260 miles away, and we are moving to New Jersey to be near family.) Their daughters are scattered, their house is too big, and they plan to downsize. While based in Boston, Liz has traveled mostly in the Far East with her husband, David Grubman ’83, for his work with AIG and Amazon. He loves to sail and at this writing was held up by the weather in the Bering Sea on the way to Anchorage, Alaska, in his 47-foot boat. Liz, writing under her surname, has been an award-winning correspondent for CNN since 1990, covering assignments in India, Singapore, and internationally generally. For many years she was the executive producer and occasional host of its global issues program, Diplomatic License.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nSam Katz, who is still collecting honorariums, was selected as one of the “25 Most Influential Alumni” in the Dartmouth Alumni Magazine’s 250th anniversary issue that led off with Daniel Webster. Sam pioneered and promoted the widespread use of the measles vaccine, which wiped out the disease in the United States and transformed global children’s health. He and his pediatric infectious disease specialist wife, Dr. Catherine Wilfert, were the first in the United States to treat children with AZT, the first FDA-approved AIDS medication.\n\nFoxy Parker is hanging in there, but comments that the ski poles are now used for walking. Their two daughters, who live in Colorado, now come east to visit with him and Helen.\n\nJohn VanRaelte’s heart problems keep him from driving, but he is coping well and he has a woman who comes in three times a week and leaves meals and food in the refrigerator. Let me reminisce. John was a fine golfer with an eight handicap at one time, an excellent equestrian and polo player, and he and I competed vigorously for ladder position on the Dartmouth varsity squash and tennis teams. No. 1 was a dubious honor in the latter instance, as in my senior year we faced leading amateur players ranked nationally, including Charlie Oliver at Army, ranked eighth; Dick Savitt at Cornell, who won Wimbledon in 1951; and Rolla Wray at Yale, who, while not ranked nationally, was in the same category of competence. My father saw only my match with Rolla. I was adjusting my Ace bandages (broken ankle skiing at, of all places, Oak Hill) after warmup, and he came over to offer some advice. I liked my dad; he always told it like it was. He said, “Son, I hope you are not under the illusion this is going to be a match.” I wasn’t—and it wasn’t.\n\nIf you want these Class Notes to continue, we really need some input. If what you’re doing is negative or boring, send me some reminiscences or stuff about your progeny by email, message, or cell phone. Next issue I’ll tell you how I got a not-so-sweaty Army shirt.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nDartmouth athletics director Harry Sheehy sent the class a letter advising that the 1948 Scholar Athlete Award last year for athletic performance and academic achievement honored Remy Borinsky ’19 (women’s soccer) and Jack Traynor ’19 (football).\n\nBorinsky was selected to the All-Ivy League first team for two years and named All-New England. She is a neuroscience major with a 3.6 GPA. Traynor was second in the conference with 98 tackles and earned a unanimous selection to the All-Ivy League first team at linebacker. Historically, awardees have joined us for cocktails and dinner at our reunions and given brief talks, which were much enjoyed and gave us a chance to meet the players and hear more about the College.\n\nThis is no longer feasible due to the diminished size of our reunions, and we should give consideration about involving a younger class to carry this tradition forward. John Hatheway encouraged our annual gifting to Dartmouth athletics. Sheehy commented, “On the strength of endowment giving, Dartmouth can offer more competitive coaching salaries and bring in high-caliber teacher-coaches whose skills and experience truly make a difference. In the last six years we have hired 16 new head coaches who have infused our department with renewed passion, energy, and expertise. Thank you for being a game-changer for Dartmouth, our coaches, and our student-athletes.”\n\nHugh Ettinger notes that after selling his composting company he worked as a consultant studying the operations of the big material recovery facilities (MRFs) that operate in virtually every county in California, processing as much as 3,000 tons of garbage a day. The Folsom prison has an MRF that processes the city’s garbage as well as its own and has the highest recyclables recovery rate in California. Why? If you are a prisoner who works in the MRF, you work in the picking lines and get special housing and meals outside the main prison.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nBob Eckerson tells an interesting story about his relationship with our late classmate Lou Springsteen,who became a minister and presided over several of our reunion ceremonies in Rollins Chapel. His wife, Ellen, attended our 70th reunion. Bob writes: “I grew up in Old Tappan, New Jersey, a farm town for New York City. Within one month of my 17th birthday I was sworn into the Navy V-5 program, was sent to Dartmouth, and eventually learned to fly. After discharge I returned to Dartmouth in the engineering program (A.B. and master’s from Thayer) and had little contact with other undergraduates. After World War II it was decided to subdivide the Eckerson farm into pieces for the four children. When my sister received her piece, she chose to subdivide it for a church. The officers of the church realized they needed space for a manse and parking and contacted me for my adjacent piece of land. An agreement was reached and the land belonged to the church, which built a home for the minister. The church had several ministers as the years went by and in 1958 there was a call for a new minister. Who was knocking at the door but Lou Springsteen. He was accepted and was its minister for 35 years until he retired. In this way, I had contact with Lou each time there was a baptism, wedding, or funeral in my family.”\n\nSissi Shattuck advised that that she and Gil are both active, he with the Manahan photo collection and research of his family history and she with painting. She has sent several images of her recent work, from portraits to landscapes, reflecting a distinct and interesting style. Bud Munson thoroughly enjoyed a river cruise down the Rhine last summer. Rather than it being sedentary, he said that he had more than enough exercise walking through the villages and castles every day. Hugh Ettinger is still working regularly as a “jack of all trades” for a New Orleans private company owning thousands of apartment units in several states. More information on his doings in my next notes.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nOur 70th reunion held at the Hanover Inn, with the gracious hospitality of the College for the classes of ’43, ’48, and ’53, was a grand success. We had a group of some 50 people, including 10 alumni, 13 widows, wives, and guests, attending. At our Friday evening reception and dinner we were entertained by the Dartmouth Aires, a very cheerful and accomplished group. President Hanlon spoke and expurgated speech notes are as follows: “A sense of place, a tight-knit community, commitment to the liberal arts, an adventuresome spirit—these are the heart and soul of Dartmouth. Broad knowledge of the world, the experience of having done a deep dive into one subject, and a suite of timeless, generally applicable intellectual skills, such as the ability to communicate, critical thinking, a well-developed creative mind, the ability to work effectively with others, leadership skills—these are the goals of a liberal arts education. Dartmouth believes that these habits of mind are the best preparation to lead with creativity and confidence in today’s increasingly volatile and complex world.”\n\nAt our annual meeting class president Bud Munson advised that we now have only three active class members on the executive committee and, although we are performing all necessary functions for an active class and looking forward to our mini-reunion next year, we need to consider what actions should be taken when the class becomes inactive. As we have adequate funds in the treasury, it was agreed to cancel future dues requirements. If no action is taken, residual funds in the treasury would simply go to the College without further recognition to the class of 1948. Our 1948 scholarship athlete is funded and requires no action for perpetuity. It’s a popular program, and each awardee gets a plaque and written confirmation. We agreed to search for a way to pass the residual funds along that will keep remembrance for the class of 1948. The only other ongoing program we have is for the Hanover Inn rocking chairs, which typically costs $2,000-$3,000 annually, which does not go through the College. Warren Daniell advised that we were given the Harvey P. Hood 1918 Award for setting a participation record of 53.2-percent gifting to the College fund for a class celebrating its 70th reunion. His goal is to increase this rate for Dartmouth’s 250th this year.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315) 853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nRegional family get-togethers are a lot of fun and from a generational point of view there is a nice sense of continuity watching cousins relate to each other. Pete Foster’s annual gathering—45 people this year–is held in July at the Charter Hotel near Vail, Colorado. He and I remonstrated that when our children start to retire it’s a clear sign we are aging. His oldest son, Michael, is retiring after a career working with psychologically disturbed students in the Middletown, Connecticut, school system. His other two children, Susan and David, are continuing interesting careers. Dr. Sue Foster has been the pastor of the East Woodstock (Connecticut) Congregational Church for the last 30 years. She completed her doctor of ministry degree at the Hartford Seminary in 2014. She comments, “I am a writer, preacher, retreat leader, counselor, wife, mother, volunteer chaplain, daughter, sister, friend.” Her new book, Retreats to Go: Twelve Creative Programs that Renew and Refresh, is available on Amazon. David Foster, who got his Ph.D. in ecology from the University of Minnesota, is a faculty member at Harvard, where he teaches ecology and is director of the Harvard Forest, the university’s 4,000-acre ecological laboratory and classroom in central Massachusetts. He is the principal investigator for its long-term ecological program. Sponsored by the National Science Foundation, its more than 100 scientists and students investigate the dynamics of New England’s landscapes and the effects of climate change, human activity, and natural disturbances. His latest book, Meeting of Land and Sea, published in 2017, reviews the ecology and future of Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nSince we have a preliminary list of attendees for our 70th, including new and old faces, a little background information for both may be helpful cognition. After their earlier years at Harvard, doctors Cathy and Sam Katz were faculty pediatricians at Duke for 43 years. Cathy worked to eliminate the transmission of HIV from millions of infected mothers in Africa to their newborns. Sam’s work was principally with vaccines. Both have received international honors. Nan and Mort Smith have lived in the Sugar Hill Retirement Community just nine miles north of their summer home on Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire, where their three sibling families, now including five great-grandchildren, get together. Nan and Mort love to travel and last year took two American Queen paddle-wheel cruises, following the Lewis and Clark trail up the Columbia River to Washington and on the Mississippi from New Orleans to Memphis, Tennessee. Dorothy and Dick Dahl are bringing their son, daughter in-law, and two children to join us and look over the College. Dick has had a sacrum problem, but is improving and walking with a cane. He was our class photographer and wrote the newsletter for many years. Warren (married to “Dot”) Daniel,who as head agent writes all the thoughtful and courteous solicitations and acknowledgments, is recovering well from a hip replacement. Our president and general factotum Bud Munson is now our only active alumnus living in the Hanover area and should be treated with tender, loving care. After all, he spent most of his working life for us in the CIA and other government agencies. Pete (Ann) Foster,whom I’ll discuss in my next notes, spent his working career with the Bell System and was an avid flyer, holding a commercial license for land and sea planes. Bob Eckerson’swife, Arlene, died two years ago, and his daughter, Lynn, is accompanying him to our reunion. She is a physical therapist, and Bob stays active going to a fitness center “using all of the equipment” three days a week and swimming two days.\n\nDr. John (Barbara) Price is still a practicing psychologist, seeing patients two days a week. He says that he plays tennis on the other five days. John also is an enthusiastic gardener, hybridizing and raising his own types of daylilies. Your secretary, Dave (Joyce) Kurr, acquired and ran a specialty packaging company for his last 12 working years. We enjoy golfing, walking, and our view into the woods adjacent to Hamilton College. Nine widows plan to join the reunion, including Pat McAllister, who is a member of the executive committee and runs our widows program, and Judy Cross, who was John Hatheway’s companion for a number of years.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315) 853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nDon Smith is no longer driving, but is mobile, healthy, still “mean and nasty,” and enjoying the weather in Los Angeles. He was very sorry to hear of John Hatheway’s passing, and we reminisced about when he, I, and Sonny Drury lived in the Tuck School dorms in 1949. He stayed in close touch with John and would get together for dinner with him and Judy during their annual visits to the L.A. area. He met with Sonny and Joan on occasions in Houston and commented on Sonny’s remarkable memory. Carl Felsenfeld joined the Fordham Law School faculty in 1983 and was teaching commercial law courses fulltime until he suffered a stroke two or three years ago. He now lives mostly indoors on Riverside Drive and says he has trouble remembering words (who doesn’t), but sounded vigorous and articulate over the phone. Incidentally, Judith’s name does not appear on our ’48 directory or the College list, but they have been happily married for nearly 40 years. I told Hank Woodward he could not join my LinkedIn network because I don’t have one. I casually asked what he was doing and found out one heck of a lot! In the past year he’s had a book titled Up River, Down River, Out to Sea published by Nook Press and available on Amazon. The story is about growing up in a commercial fishing community at the mouth of the Merrimac River, which flows southeast from New Hampshire into the Atlantic at Newburyport, Massachusetts. Undaunted, he has finished writing another book whose publication is only delayed by being digitalized (whatever that means). It’s to be titled Canoeing Guide to the Geology of the BWCA Quetico, which is a wilderness area in northern Minnesota and Canada. Tad and Georgette Comstock live in the same very attractive assisted care retirement community in Exeter, New Hampshire, as Ron Spiers. Tad uses a walker, enjoys the community, and plays some duplicate bridge to stay sharp. They are visited by lots of family and had 17 for Easter. Don’t forget the 70th and the Hanover Inn hospitality.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nThe 2017 male winner of our scholar-athlete award was soccer player Wyatt Omsberg ’18 of Scarborough, Maine. He earned All-American honors and was named first-team All-Ivy and Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year in both his junior and senior years. The female award winner was field hockey player Morgan Philie of West Friendship, Maryland. She was an academic All-American and All-Ivy in both her sophomore and junior years and is a member of the Dartmouth ROTC. Another ongoing, high-profile program is the maintenance of the ’48 rocking chairs on the Hanover Inn porch, which we pay for out of the class treasury, now funded with some $21,000. We need to plan how to handle these programs after our class is no longer active.\n\nTwo major issues facing the College include the question of whether to increase the undergraduate body by some 750 students and the problem of large deficits run by the Hanover Country Club. President Hanlon has set up committees to study both issues and come up with recommendations later this year. Bud Munson discussed the class size question in substantial detail in his newsletter, and I agree with his priority: “to ensure that the scope of Dartmouth’s academic programs and financial base matches the high-quality levels of other Ivy and top national educational institutions.” Currently we have the smallest student body in the league. Space for a housing complex is available only in the College Park wooded area and may eliminate Shattuck Observatory. The Bema ambiance, however, is precious. As for the other issue, the golfing facility is losing some $500,000 annually and membership recently has dropped from 400 to 300. The golf course is a significant asset that should be preserved.\n\nCorrecting my previous column, Sonny Drury’s phone number is (281) 531-8608.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (781) 801-6716; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nWarren Daniell had a successful hip replacement and an operation to untangle his prostate and says he is “Back to normal except for the use of a cane, which will, I hope, stop before the end of 2017.” With that behind them, he and Dot, encouraged by a long overdue Alaska Airlines direct flight from Boston, last August visited their daughter, Beth ’77, outside of Portland, Oregon. They then drove down to their annual family gathering of some 20 relatives in Ashland, a pleasant college town just north of California and home of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, where they have met since 1982 and almost feel as if it were a second home. They are near the top of the list for a retirement home in Concord, “but the move is going slow.” Foxy and Helen Parker have stayed close to home the last two years. Foxy was pretty well immobilized and had orthopedic back surgery with vertebra fusion in late 2016 from which he continues to recover. Helen has had a heart problem, which with rehab has been brought under control. At this writing they are planning to resume their annual Christmas visit with their two daughters living in Vail, Colorado. Helen and I both observed how family who move to the western mountain area tend to stay there. Foxy, a superb skier, is hoping to get on the cross-country boards. Historic regulars, they expect to attend our big 70th, where, I’m told, we’ll be guests of the Hanover Inn. Pete and Anne Foster have moved to a retirement home in Haddam, Connecticut. Their new phone number is (860) 345-0954. Similarly, Bud Munson’snew number is (603) 442-5782. Everyone at the mini liked his new condo. I am pleased not to have seen those black football uniforms worn at the Penn game last year. The Indian symbol and Eleazar Wheelock were fun, but a problem; the Big Green, blah, but okay; “Go Black”—come on. I would much appreciate hearing what’s going on with you or your progeny. Contacting me at the email below is the easiest way.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315) 853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nOur regular annual mini-reunion was held October 6 and 7 and was attended by Bud Munson,Dotand Warren Daniel,Anne and Pete Foster,Judy Cross, who was John Hatheway’s companion for a number of years before he died last summer, and widows Ellie Huke, Jean Guthrie, Marilyn Greene, Alice Becker and Marian Page. Pat McAllister, who has done such a grand job working with our widows, arranged the Friday night dinner that was held in the Winship Room of the Blunt Alumni Relations Building (old Crosby Hall) and catered with sandwiches by the Hanover Coop. Since it was alumni weekend, there was a good view of the bonfire and the circling freshmen. Several sat on the steps of Robinson Hall to better view the fun. As Judy put it, “The next day we sat through a drizzle to watch a miserable first half then a glorious second half, where we defeated Yale by one point in the very last minute. Happy but wet, we all went to Bud’s house in Quail Hollow in Lebanon [New Hampshire] for drinks and supper.” At an informal class meeting Warren advised the College credited the class of 1948 with gifting $42,000 to the Alumni Fund, with a participation rate of 44 percent. The class has set a goal of 60 percent for FY 2018, which he thought was reasonable for our 70th reunion. Bud advised the class has about $22,000 in the bank, sufficient for our Hanover Inn porch chairs maintenance program and other commitments. Our annual athletes’ scholarship awards program for one male and one female student is fully funded and awards will be selected by the College for 2017-18.\n\nI subsequently had a very nice chat with our class chronicler, Sonny Drury, and his wife, Joan, still living in Houston. Sonny is pretty much fully blind, but is otherwise physically healthy, cheerful and enjoying life. Joan says he is able to hear all of Dartmouth’s football games over the radio and is now deeply involved listening to Churchill’s memoirs. He enjoys hearing from his Dartmouth friends and can be reached at (281) 531-8606.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315) 853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nRonald I. Spiers spoke with me from River Woods Retirement Home in Exeter, New Hampshire, that he and Patience find “very nice.” Ron is coping with Parkinson’s disease but staying in touch with associates in the U.S. State Department, where he spent nearly 40 years. He came to Dartmouth under Navy V-12 and served as a U.S. Navy officer from 1943 to 1947, where he learned Japanese and was stationed in the Marshall Islands. He returned to Dartmouth for his A.B. and attended the Princeton University Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs in 1950 and earned a master’s in public affairs, specializing in foreign affairs.\n\nRon and Patience Baker married in 1949 and had three daughters and one son. He went to work for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Agency as a foreign affairs specialist and developed the proposal that gave birth to the International Atomic Energy Commission. He joined the State Department in 1955, when he worked in a variety of assignments, typically involving arms control. He served at the U.S. mission to the United Nations as a negotiator for the statute of the International Energy Agency and similarly with the Soviet Union on several treaties.\n\nHis career highlights chronologically included serving as director of NATO affairs, political counselor and charge d’affaires and U.S. embassy deputy chief of mission in London, assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, first U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas, U.S. ambassador to Turkey, assistant secretary of state of intelligence and research, U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, undersecretary of state for management through the Reagan administration and undersecretary general of the United Nations for political affairs, where he became the highest-ranking American citizen in the UN secretariat.\n\nThe Hon. Ronald I. Spiers retired in March 1992 with two Presidential Distinguished Executive Service awards and the honorary rank of career ambassador he was awarded by the president and the U.S. Senate in 1984 that is reserved for a small number of career officers who have served with distinction in the highest positions of the foreign service. Ron said I could flesh out his comments on the Internet and I’ve taken that liberty.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315) 853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nLouis Springsteen’s widow, Ellen, sent the following note, which reflects how meaningful Dartmouth is to so many of us. “I just received acknowledgement of my husband’s 69 consecutive years of giving to the Dartmouth College Fund. What a record, and how he loved Dartmouth. I shall share this acknowledgement with our granddaughter, Jess Menville ’16, who is now a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps, and hope she will continue the tradition.” We well remember the Rev. Springsteen’s memorial services in Rollins Chapel at our annual reunions. Joyce and I had a very pleasant lunch at our golf club in Naples, Florida, with Joan and Lany Brisbane and the girls discovered a remarkable coincidence: both went to Middlebury College one year apart, married their Dartmouth swains their junior years, to be with them finished their senior years in a different college and have put up with them for nearly 70 years. Lany came to Dartmouth the summer of 1944 and after one semester joined the Marine Corps, where he spent three extraordinarily intensive weeks at Camp Lejeune learning to speak and write Japanese (he’s also fluent in Spanish and French) and ended up in Washington, D.C., translating Japanese transmissions. He returned to Dartmouth in 1946 and after graduation jointed RC Cola, remaining with them until his formal retirement. A tennis enthusiast, he has had a number of related business endeavors, most particularly with products of the Wilson Sporting Goods Co.\n\nBud Munson had trouble selling his farm because Dartmouth owns some 240 acres of land on a hill across the road, where the Medical School dumped rubbish in the 1960s and 1970s that contaminated streams in the area and which the College has a five-year program to clean up. They made a “fair and reasonable” offer to buy the property, which Bud accepted, and he is moving to Quail Hollow, a senior living community with rental apartments and private homes in West Lebanon, New Hampshire, just two miles from Hanover. He has a roomy townhouse with two bedrooms and baths and a porch for grilling. He’s a great cook.\n\nNo details as of this writing, but we’re planning a fall reunion at approximately the first home game.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315) 853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nI had a cheerful chat with Jim Hudson,who was born in New York in 1927, brought up in Brooklyn and matriculated at Dartmouth, where his schooling was interrupted by a two-year stint in the U.S. Army at the end of World War II. After graduation he earned a doctor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine. In 1961 he joined the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta with the responsibility of strengthening its nephrology program. He and Janet, who died in 2003, had three daughters and he now has nine granddaughters. Jim retired in 1990 and he and Julia married about 12 years ago. Still living in Augusta, he says they are both doing fine. He’s an avid “lousy” golfer, playing a couple of rounds a week. When I confessed my golf playing incompetence he suggested I try using my muscle memories and not my brains. Jim has had tickets to the Masters for years, but now gives them to his girls.\n\nRay Richard lost his wife, Gloria, earlier this year and I wondered how the social environment was at the Woodlands in Lebanon, New Hampshire. He couldn’t have been more positive, stating there were a lot of nice, interesting people, including Dartmouth alumni, faculty and administrators; lots going on; good company for dinner; and great cuisine. He concluded, “I’m blessed to be here.” Ray says he’s completely over his debilitating neck problem and his “congestive heart failure” condition is medicinally controllable and improving with exercise. With the loss of John Hatheway this past May, our monthly class luncheons are reduced to Ray, Bud Munson,Pat McAllister and generally another widow. Before and after his retirement from a 49-year career at Young and Rubicon, John was involved in innumerable Dartmouth alumni affairs including service as class president, chairman of multi-class reunions, board member and president of Dartmouth Club of New York City, board member of the Hanover Inn and Dartmouth’s public affairs advisory committee. At his death he was class vice president, Dartmouth Life board member and Tuck School class secretary.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315) 853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nGlen Peck came to Dartmouth with most of our class the summer of 1944, then joined the U.S. Marine Corps and returned after his discharge. He completed his bachelor’s at Northeastern University, where he also earned his law degree at night school and passed the Massachusetts Bar. Glen said he had a long and satisfying career as a teacher, lawyer and real estate broker before retiring in 1995. He keeps busy with his family and large lawn and house and said he was buried under leaves when we chatted last fall. He and Maureen have two boys and two girls with a substantial generational involvement with Dartmouth. One of his sons graduated from Dartmouth and the other went to Tuck School after graduating from Princeton. One daughter worked at the College for some time as a director of alumni research. Glen has fond memories of the people he knew at Dartmouth and would like to stay in touch with the class.\n\nDick Dahl has been a stalwart member of our executive committee, written our newsletter for many years and been our designated photographer at class reunions. Unfortunately, we missed him in 2015 because of an automobile accident and last year because he took a bad fall and broke his sacrum. When I spoke with him recently, he sounded vigorous and said he was feeling perfectly fine with no pains. Dorothy has some painful neck problems and the trip to Dartmouth is a stretch for them now. Dick said they are looking at three retirement homes in the Princeton, New Jersey, area and expect to make a choice shortly.\n\nWe all were so sorry when Bud Munson’s wife, Barbara, passed away last fall. Her hospitality running a bed and breakfast with Bud for some years and hosting our class at their lovely farm was a treat we won’t forget. Fortunately, Bud is a good cook and so enjoys the farm that at this writing he’s postponing moving to a retirement home. More power to him.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315) 853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nCompleting my last notes covering our mini-reunion, Martha Beattie, vice president of alumni relations, gave a very positive and informative dinner speech. She stressed her concern and responsibility that all living alumni are kept informed of all aspects of Dartmouth. She said President Hanlon was committed to a liberal arts education where professors teach, where there is a “sense of place,” where adventuring and risk are stimulated and where there is a feeling of “the community of Dartmouth.” Summarizing her comments on the new housing system: All freshmen are assigned to a housing cluster where they will remain affiliated for their undergraduate years. Twelve such clusters are planned, with six now operative, each with a house professor and now handling a total of some 670 students. Students can move to Greek and affinity houses and living learning communities that are now consolidated in the McLaughlin cluster. Martha sees the development of intramural sports, social and other programs between the housing communities.\n\nGil Shattuck writes, “Sissi and I are both busy. I joined her for four weeks in Austria in June and July. She had several painting commissions to finish up and deliver. While she was doing this I spent a few days in Prague, did several day trips and visited with friends and relatives. We had a week together in the mountains. I took about 1,000 photos with my new iPhone.” Gil is still busy on his photographic collection from a defunct, historic studio, with 97,000 conserved and less than 20,000 to go. He ran unsuccessfully for his sixth term as a member of the N.H. House of Representatives, but plans to continue working behind the scenes. Sissi was relieved, as it is a long trip for him to Concord in the winter and this is less stressful.\n\nAs a result of our Class Notes column, Warren Daniell renewed his acquaintance with Ken Carpenter, whom he knew well at Thayer.It seems they both got into the Navy by passing the famous Eddy Test, which qualified them for a rigorous nine-month program to become electronic technician mates, a coincidence they had not realized until now.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315) 853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nOur mini-reunion was held during the Dartmouth-Penn football weekend and, while diminished compared to previous events, was attended by Bud Munson, Warren and Dot Daniel, John Hatheway and Judy Cross, Pete and Ann Foster, your secretaryand Joyce Kurr and loyal widows Pat McAllister, Ellie Huke, Alice Becker, Marion Page and Lynn Greene. We had a very nice lunch and class meeting at the Zimmerman Lounge in the well-accoutered and convenient Blunt Alumni Center (formerly Crosby Hall).\n\nOf note, the class is financially sound and we have 87 active members and 118 active widows. Our annual giving participation record for 2016 was 51.7 percent.\n\nThe Saturday night dinner was attended by our award-winning scholar-athletes Taylor Ng ’17 of women’s tennis fame and Spencer Furey ’17 from the varsity eight rowing crew and our speaker was Martha Beattie ’76, vice president for alumni relations. An economics and anthropology double major, Taylor was named First-Team All Ivy for singles and doubles, received the International Tennis Association Arthur Ashe Jr. Leadership and Sportsmanship Award and was part of the first Big Green duo to qualify for doubles at the NCAA tournament. She didn’t start her tennis career until her early teens, when she was spotted by Dartmouth in a New Jersey tournament. She’s impressed by the sense of community at Dartmouth and her experience in the outreach program she attended in her junior year. Her interests are varied and she expressed a real enjoyment in creative cooking, while not yet sure where her career will take her.\n\nSpencer is pursuing a dual major in English and history. After being told he would not make the varsity tennis team, he was a freshman walk-on and became a staple in the number four rowing position, where “all I have to do is row hard,” he said. He did to the point he holds two team training records and was invited to the U.S. Under 23 National Team Selection Camp. He hopes to stay with rowing and try out for the next Olympics. Both athletes found their Greek experience rewarding.\n\nI’ll cover Martha’s interesting comments in my next notes.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315) 853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nJohn Hatheway,John Jr.and Judy Cross attended the graduation of John’s grandson, Patrick, at Hobart and William Smith colleges, located in the heart of the Finger Lakes in upstate New York. Judy has been a trustee and vice chairwoman of the board of trustees of William Smith and was previously given an honorary doctor of humane letters degree by Hobart, which enabled her to wear a “beautiful orange, purple and white hood.” Following his father’s footsteps, Patrick majored in architecture, and Hobart professors set up an interview in Rome so he could take an intensive course in Italian and continue his studies next year in Italy, where his girlfriend will also be located. Tom Byrnes ’55, who represents classes on the Alumni Council that graduated 55 years or more ago, commented about the spring council meeting that, “Both the administration and trustees are strongly behind the new plan for residential housing and expressed confidence that it would significantly improve the social life on campus by providing a four-year home for students.” While not negative, Tom wondered if it might lead “to more pressure on the Greek organizations or affinity housing to disband.” He observed, “The College’s firm commitment to diversity and inclusion was quite evident in both committee and plenary meetings, almost to the exclusion of other desirable considerations.” John VanRaalte,one of our fittest alumni, had some chest pains April 19 and went to see his doctor, who checked him out on the treadmill. John promptly had a severe heart attack and was rushed by ambulance to the nearby White Plains, New York, hospital, where he was immediately operated on and had four stents implanted. He was then transferred to the Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, one of the finest in the country and specializing in heart care, where he spent 10 days for evaluation and treatment. At this writing, he’s doing well and is active as the treasurer of his condo and writing all of the checks. Another fit athlete, Lanny Brisbane, is back in form and was planning to play in the tennis seniors 90 and over nationals with a possible No. 1 seeding.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315) 853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nUpdating our class directory, last year Walt and Joyce Baker moved from Yarmouth, Maine, to a retirement community with an address of 54 Mathew Drive, Brunswick, ME 04011; (207) 373-1945. Walt came to Dartmouth in June of 1944 and graduated in 1947. He married Joyce in 1949 and they raised a family of four children, two of whom, Tim ’74 and Wendy ’77, went to Dartmouth. Wendy married Brant Healey ’75 and both stayed in Hanover for a few years after graduation. She worked at the Hanover Savings Bank while Brant worked for Dartmouth in the development office.\n\nAfter graduation Walt worked for a savings bank in Connecticut for 20-plus years, leaving when his family acquired a boat yard and marina in South Freeport, Maine. After he ran into health problems that required an artificial heart valve implant, the boat yard was sold in the mid 1980s and he eased into retirement by serving part time as executive secretary of the Marine Trade Association for several years. After 35 years the valve is still working fine and he is “doing well.” Coincidentally, Wendy and my daughter, Penny, were in the same class and both spent time in the Foley House, an offbeat, non-sorority house with vegetarian leanings. Six foot-plus Penny was caught downtown eating a hamburger, which she claimed she needed because “my bones are growing.”\n\nSince my last Class Notes the mini-reunion has been moved back a week to October 1 and a newsletter sent out accordingly.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315) 853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nKen Carpenter came to Dartmouth from Medford, Oregon, in the summer of 1944 and then joined the U.S. Navy for 15 months before returning to receive his degrees from Dartmouth in 1949 and Thayer in 1950. He went to work in the San Francisco area and was programming test systems for Lockheed Martin before retiring in the early 1980s, when he and his wife, Barbara, moved to 12 acres in the hills outside of the unincorporated village of Honeydew in the northwest corner and the most undeveloped portion of the California coast. Honeydew is only a spot on the map with a general store and post office, one house and an elementary school. Residents live in the surrounding hills. The climate is remarkable. The village is in the Mattole River valley, where temperatures typically reach the upper 90s in mid-summer and mid-50s in the winter, with annual rainfall of 100 inches. While only 15 miles from the Pacific Ocean, it is on the eastern edge of the King Range, which has 4,000-foot peaks. Ken is quite self-sufficient. He is off the power grid and gets his electricity from solar panels, supplemented by a gas generator, has a Vermont Casting wood stove as a primary heating source, purchases local produce, favors organic and avoids genetically modified foods and watches no TV. He is very active on the Internet and was working on two computers when I called. He likes where he’s living, despite “an occasional forest fire, earthquake and rattlesnake.” He adds, “Then there are the pot farmers dotting the landscape with their greenhouses.” Now a widower, Ken’s not reclusive and is treasurer of the Mattole Grange, near Petrolia, where he is past treasurer of the local community center. John Hatheway advises that the mini-reunion is scheduled for September 23 and 24. You should have more information by the time you read this column, but give me or John a call if you have questions. John recently attended a Williams-Wesleyan double-header, where his grandson, Kollen Hatheway, the Williams shortstop, hit a home run in the last inning to win the first game and another to start the second. Grandchildren are fun.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315) 853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nBud and Barbara Munson flew out to Boulder, Colorado, last July to see their first great-grandchild. Our first was due in February at this writing and there have already been two showers. I remember our eldest daughter, who is a research doctor in Boston, had her last child while she was writing up a National Institutes of Health grant. She simply changed rooms at the hospital and was home with her baby and notes in 24 hours. Helen and Foxy Parker flew to Reykjavik last August for a 12-day visit to Iceland, where they toured the country with a small group. A bit of history: It was settled by the Vikings in 874 AD, a commonwealth in 930-1262, ruled by Norway and then Denmark from 1262 to 1814, independent in 1918 and a republic in 1944. With a population of some 130,000, it is the smallest member of NATO. Very similar to Ireland, the Iceland banking system was flooded with toxic international debt packages and systemically failed in 1980. Both countries have made remarkable recoveries and Iceland enjoys economic, political and social stability. It recently was ranked as the 13th most developed country in the world by the United Nations Human Development Index. Helen and Foxy found the scenery spectacular, full of rivers, waterfalls, glaciers, fjords and volcanos. The landscape was covered with sheep of all colors, including black. They found the people approachable, friendly and, with English as the second language to Icelandic, easy to talk with. They seemed upbeat and comfortable with their lifestyle. The weather was cool to occasionally cold. With the midnight sun in the summer and aurora borealis in the winter, they had a little of both. Regular travelers, they said it was the best trip they have taken. I chatted with Bill and Margie Scott, who missed our mini-reunion because Bill had knee replacement surgery. Bill said there was virtually no subsequent pain and the postoperative exercises were easy to handle. They hope to join us this year.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315) 853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nThis issue is excerpted from Rauner Library’s The War Years at Dartmouth. Sonny Drury’s dad came back to Dartmouth from Cleveland for a couple of years to get his civil engineering degree, but the family loved Hanover so much that he put his shingle over Main Street, “Dan Drury, Civil Engineer,” and he and his wife lived there for the rest of their lives. When President Hopkins walked down the street, “People would pour out of the stores to shake his hand.” While he was quite elderly and was not visible, “He met privately in his office with every student.” Sonny felt the town-and-gown relationship was very close. Most of the College officers were citizens of the town and had children in Hanover High School who knew they were going on to Dartmouth. Skiing was paramount to Sonny, and he and Olympian Colin Stewart anchored the high school and Dartmouth teams. The Dartmouth Outing Club was a major attraction to Sonny from his first hike over Mount Washington the July 4th weekend in 1944 immediately after he entered Dartmouth. Warren Daniell has a strong memory of John Sloan Dickey, who became president in the fall of 1945. He commented: “Dickey was a mover and a shaker and basically he picked the College up from the Depression and war years and started going ahead. One of the very positive impressions I had of the College was the ‘Great Issues’ course, where he was able to bring in practically everybody of positive notoriety in the government. It was a tremendous experience to listen to all those people.” Pete Foster commented: “One of the things I have always appreciated about Dartmouth is that there was no segregation or distinction difference made by anyone, either in the administration, faculty or other undergraduates. It was as if we were all brothers together.” John Van Raalte and Iboth enjoyed playing varsity squash and tennis and remember coach Red Hoehn as a good friend.The students really supported the athletic teams. As John said,“When Joe Sullivan was going through the line he had the whole school behind him.”\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315)-853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nOur annual mini-reunion class meeting and dinner, where we were joined by 12 widows, were held September 25 in the Vermont Room of the Coolidge Hotel in White River Junction, Vermont. The Coolidge is a charming, old hotel with a mixture of regular and semi-permanent rooms primarily for Dartmouth faculty and graduate students. The walls were covered with pastoral murals by Peter Michael Fish and innkeeper and owner David Briggs gave us an interesting presentation of their meaning and history. The class continues to be financially healthy. Our participation rate for annual fund gifting was a record 51 percent. Our scholar-athlete award-winners, Jacqueline Friedman ’16 and Dovydas Sakinis ’16, joined us for dinner. Jackie, from Del Mar, California, is a psychology and brain studies major with a 3.6 GPA and an All-Ivy first team selection as a top defensive player for a soccer team that gave up just 11 goals while recording nine shutouts. She worked with Goldman Sachs in San Francisco during the summer, but is unsure where her interests lie. Dovydas comes from Lithuania and has a double major in economics and Russian with a 3.67 GPA. He was named Ivy League tennis player of the year, qualified for the NCAA singles championship and was asked to try out for the Lithuanian Davis Cup. He has worked in the summer with Morgan Stanley, but is uncertain as to his career and country. Both winners made us feel good about Dartmouth. Joyce and I had a very pleasant dinner and bridge with Judy Cross and John Hatheway,although their bidding and making two small slams in the first rubber was a bit much. John suffered a cardiac arrest in San Francisco, was hospitalized for several days and had to fly back with oxygen. He’s recovering nicely and played his first golf last fall. Most of us had a delightful dinner Saturday at Bud and Barbara Munson’shouse Saturday, skipping the football game with its ridiculous 7 p.m. starting time. Foxy and Helen Parker had a fascinating trip to Iceland last summer that I’ll cover in detail next notes.\n\n—Dave Kurr, 4281 Indian Field Road, Clinton, NY 13323; (315)-853-3582; djkurr@verizon.net\n\nJohn Boggia came to Dartmouth in 1944 as part of the U.S. Navy V-12 and V-5 programs and completed his service in air training before returning to Hanover. While at Thayer School he recalls climbing from his fourth-floor room at Middle Mass to the roof during a night snowball fight, falling off, losing his spleen and breaking a variety of bones. More productively, he supplemented his G.I. bill working at Wards Department Store. He married Dorothy, whom he dated for 10 years, in 1948. In 1950 they moved to Lexington, Massachusetts, where he spent his business career with the New England Candy Co. (NECCO), retiring as VP about 20 years ago. Dorothy worked for the New England Telephone Co., to whom I used to sell packaging. NECCO’s roots go back to 1847, when a founding company invented the first American candy machine, a lozenge cutter, to make chocolate wafers, still"
