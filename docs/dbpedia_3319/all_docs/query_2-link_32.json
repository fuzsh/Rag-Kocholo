        "text": "1\n\nFIRST DAY\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION, HELD AT CHICAGO, MAY 16, 17 and 18, 1860.\n\nAt 12 o'clock on Wednesday, the 16th day of May, 1860, the delegations from various states of the Confederacy, appointed in pursuance of a call issued by the Republican National Committee, assembled in the Wigwam, at Chicago.\n\nHON. EDWIN D. MORGAN, of New York, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, called the Convention to order. He said:\n\nOn the twenty-second of December last, the Republican National Committee, at a meeting convened for the purpose in the city of New York, issued a call for a National Convention, which I will now read:\n\n\"A National Republican Convention will meet at Chicago, on Wednesday, the 16th day of May next, at twelve o'clock, noon, for the nomination of candidates to be supported for President and Vice-President at the next election.\"\n\n\"The Republican electors of the several states, the members of the People's Party of Pennsylvania and of the Opposition Party of New Jersey, and all others who are willing to cooperate with them in support of the candidates which shall there be nominated, and who are opposed to the policy of the\n\n2\n\npresent administration, to federal corruption and usurpation, to the extension of slavery into the territories, to the new and dangerous political doctrine that the constitution of its own force carries slavery into all the Territories of the United States, to the opening of the African slave trade, to any inequality of rights among citizens; and who are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas into the Union, under the constitution recently adopted by its people, of restoring the federal administration to a system of rigid economy and to the principles of Washington and Jefferson, of maintaining inviolate the rights of the states and defending the soil of every state and territory from lawless invasion, and of preserving the integrity of this Union and the supremacy of the constitution and laws passed in pursuance thereof against the conspiracy of the leaders of a sectional party, to resist the majority principle as established in this government even at the expense of its existence, are invited to send from each state two delegates from every congressional district, and four delegates at large, to the Convention.\"\n\nEdwin D. Morgan, New York, Chairman.\n\nJoseph Bartlett, Maine.\n\nGeorge G. Fogg, New Hampshire.\n\nLawrence Brainard, Vermont.\n\nJohn Z. Goodrich, Massachusetts.\n\nGideon Welles, Connecticut.\n\nThomas Williams, Pennsylvania.\n\nGeorge Harris, Maryland.\n\nAlfred Caldwell, Virginia.\n\nThomas Spooner, Ohio.\n\nCassius M. Clay, Kentucky.\n\nJames Sherman, New Jersey.\n\nCornelius Cole, California.\n\nJames Ritchey, Indiana.\n\nNorman B. Judd, Illinois.\n\nZachariah Chandler, Michigan.\n\n3\n\nJohn H. Tweedy, Wisconsin.\n\nAlexander Ramsey, Minnesota.\n\nAndrew J. Stevens, Iowa.\n\nAsa S. Jones, Missouri.\n\nMartin F. Conway, Kansas.\n\nLewis Clephane, District of Columbia.\n\nWilliam M. Chace, Rhode Island.\n\nO. P. Schoolfield, Tennessee.\n\nE. D. Williams, Delaware.\n\nIn compliance therewith, the people have sent representatives here to deliberate upon measures for carrying into effect the objects of the call.\n\nUsage has made it my duty to take the preliminary step toward organizing the Convention--a Convention upon the proceedings of which, permit me to say, the most momentous results are depending. No body of men of equal number was ever clothed with greater responsibility than those now within the hearing of my voice. You do not need me to tell you, gentlemen, what this responsibility is. While one portion of the adherents of the National administration are endeavoring to insert a slave code into the party platform, another portion exhibits its readiness to accomplish the same result through the action of the Supreme Court of the United States [applause]; willing by indirection to do that which, if done directly, would bring a blush even to the cheek of modern Democracy. [Cheers and laughter.]\n\nWhile these and other stupendous wrongs, absolutely shocking to the moral sentiment of the country, are to be fastened upon the people by the party in power, if its leaders are able to bring the factious elements that compose it into any degree of unanimity, there seems left no ray of hope except in the good sense of this Convention. [Great applause.]\n\nLet me then invoke you to act in a spirit of harmony, that by the dignity, the wisdom and the patriotism displayed here you may be enabled to enlist the hearts of the people, and to\n\n4\n\nstrengthen them in the faith that yours is the constitutional party of the country, and the only constitutional party; that you are actuated by principle, and that you will be guided by the light and by the example of the fathers of the republic. [Renewed cheers].\n\nFortunately you are not required to enunciate new and untried principles of government. This has been well and wisely done by the statesmen of the revolution. [Applause.] Stand where they stood, avowing and maintaining the like objects and doctrines; then will the end sought be accomplished; the constitution and the Union be preserved; and the government be administered by patriots and statesmen.\n\nFor temporary President, I now nominate Hon. David Wilmot, of Pennsylvania. [Great and prolonged applause.]\n\nThe nomination was acceded to by the unanimous voice of the Convention, and the Chairman appointed Hon. WM. L. Marshall, of Maryland, and Hon. C. F. Cleveland, of Connecticut, to conduct the temporary President to the Chair.\n\nThe appearance of Mr. Wilmot was made the opportunity for loud and prolonged manifestations of applause.\n\nIn introducing the temporary President to the Convention Gov. Cleveland said:\n\nGentlemen of the Convention: I have now the high honor of introducing to the Convention a gentleman whose name is known to every lover of liberty throughout this land, the Hon. David Wilmot, of Pennsylvania--a man who dares to do the right, regardless of consequences. With such men for our leaders and spokesmen, there is no such word as fail. [Loud cheers.]\n\nOn taking the Chair, Mr. Wilmot said:\n\nI have no words in which properly to express my sense of honor--and the undeserved one, I think it is--of being called upon to preside temporarily over the deliberations of this Convention. I shall not attempt a task which I feel\n\n5\n\ninadequate to perform. Be sure, gentlemen, that I am not insensible to this high and undeserved honor. I shall carry the recollection of it, and of your manifestation of partiality, with me until the day of my death. It is not necessary for me, gentlemen, delegates, to remind you of the importance of the occasion that has called this assemblage together; nor of the high duties which devolve upon you. A great sectional and aristocratic party, or interest, has for years dominated with a high hand over the political affairs of this country. That interest has wrested, and is now wresting, all the great powers of this government to the one object of the extension and nationalization of slavery. It is our purpose, gentlemen, it is the mission of the Republican party and the basis of its organization, to resist this policy of a sectional interest. It is our mission to restore this government to its original policy, and place it again in that rank upon which our fathers organized and brought it into existence. It is our purpose and our policy to resist these new constitutional dogmas that slavery exists by virtue of the constitution wherever the banner of this Union floats. It is our purpose to restore the constitution to its original meaning; to give to it its true interpretation; to read that instrument as our fathers read it. [Applause ] That instrument was not ordained and established for the purpose of in trenching slavery within the limits of this country; it was not ordained and established for the purpose of giving high guarantees and securities to that institution. Our fathers regarded slavery as a blot upon this country. They went down into their graves with the earnest hope and confident belief that but a few more years and that blot would be extinguished from our land. [Much applause.] This was the faith in which they died. [Applause.] Had the proposition been presented to them in the early conflicts of the revolution, or outside of that grand movement, that they were called upon to endure the hazards, trials and sacrifices of that long and perilous contest for the purpose of establishing on this continent a great slave empire, not one of them would have drawn his sword in such a cause. [Great\n\n6\n\napplause] No, citizens! This republic was established for the purpose of securing the guarantees of liberty, of justice and of righteousness to the people and to their posterity. That was the great object with which the revolution was fought, these were the purposes for which the union and constitution were formed. Slavery is sectional. Liberty national. [Immense applause.] Fellow citizens: need I remind this intelligent and vast audience--need I call to mind to the intelligent gentlemen who represent the various states represented upon this floor--manifestations of lawless violence, of tyranny such; is the world never saw in a civilized and Christian land that is manifested by this spirit of slavery. Whose rights are secure where slavery has the power to trample them under foot? Who to-day is not more free to utter his opinions within the empire of Russia, or under the shadow of the despotism of Austria than he is within the limits of the slave states of this Republic? Will their tyranny be confined to those states when they have the power to enforce it upon us? [Voices--\"No! never!\" We owe the liberty which we to-day enjoy in the free states, to the absence of slavery. And, fellow citizens, shall we, in building up this great empire of ours, in fulfilling that high and sacred trust imposed upon us by our fathers--shall we support this blighting, this demoralizing institution throughout the vast extent of our borders? [Voices, loudly--\"No!\"] Or shall we preserve this land as a free land to our posterity forever? These are the principles for which the Republican party is struggling. Fellow citizens, the safety of our liberty, the security of all we hold valuable, demands that we should take possession of this government and administer it upon those broad constitutional doctrines that were recognized for the first sixty years of the existence of our government -- that were recognized by Washington, by Jefferson, by Adams, by Madison, by Monroe, by Adams the younger, by Jackson, by Van Buren, even down to the time of Polk, when this new dogma was started that the constitution was established to guarantee to slavery perpetual existence and unlimited empire. Invoking, fellow\n\n7\n\ncitizens, a spirit of patriotism and harmony, and trusting that that spirit will guide us to a fortunate result in our deliberations, I will now enter upon the discharge of the duties which have been assigned to me. [Great applause.]\n\nHon. Thomas Spooner, of Ohio, moved that Frederick Hassaurek, of Ohio, Theodore M. Pomeroy, of New, York, and Henry T. Blow, of Missouri, be elected temporary Secretaries.\n\nThe motion was carried unanimously.\n\nThe President then introduced the Rev. Z. H. Humphrey, Pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, of Chicago, who addressed the Throne of Grace in the following prayer:\n\nOh, Lord God! Thou art great and greatly to be praised. We come before Thy Throne to worship and also to learn Thy will. We invoke Thy presence and Thy blessing, as we gather beneath this roof to-day. We praise Thee for what Thou art, and for what Thou hast done for us. Verily, \"our lines have fallen to us in pleasant places, and we have a goodly heritage.\" Thou hast strengthened the bars of our gates, and placed our children within them. Thou hast made peace in our borders, and filled us with the finest of the wheat. Thou hast not dealt so by any nation. As for Thy judgments we have not known them; and yet we confess that we have deserved to suffer for we have sinned against Thee. We entreat Thy forgiveness for all our transgressions, and Thy protection from all consequences of sin. We pray for our common country. We ask that Thou wilt deliver us from all the evil to which we are exposed, and that Thou wilt make us to shake off and put away all those evils which we are too apt to cherish. Wilt Thou bless our rulers, and teach them to govern in the fear of God, and in the love of man. Wilt Thou deliver us from corruption, from oppression and from selfish ambition. Show us Thy way of rescuing the oppressed from the house of bondage, and of making this country truly and consistently free. We crave Thy blessing upon this Convention, and pray that Thou wilt enable all those who are\n\n8\n\nhere gathered to act, amid the excitements of the hour, as feeling their responsibility to their fellow men, and as knowing that they will one day stand before Thee. Wilt Thou bless us in all that we do? Wilt Thou rule amid all the conflicts of opinion and the strifes of parties; and may the issue be for Thy glory, and for our good. May there be no strife, but that of brethren loving, while yet in opinion disagreeing. Let not the ploughshare of division be permanently driven through our fair land. May we live as a Christian country; and though we put not our trust in princes, may we be that happy land whose God is the Lord, which we ask through Jesus Christ, our Saviour: Amen!\n\nMr. Norman B. Judd, of Illinois, moved that a committee, consisting of one delegate from each state and territory represented in the Convention, or selected by the delegates thereof, who should report officers to the Convention for its permanent organization.\n\nThe motion was carried.\n\nMr. Judd moved that the roll of both states be now called for the purpose of selecting the committee.\n\nThe motion was carried.\n\nThe states were then called, and the committee constituted as follows:\n\nMaine, Leonard Andrews. Vermont, Hugh L. Henry. New Hampshire, Aaron H. Cragin. Massachusetts, Linus B. Comins. Connecticut, Arthur B. Calef. Rhode Island, Simon H. Greene. New York, Henry H. Van Dyck. New Jersey, Ephraim Marsh. Pennsylvania, T. J. Coffey. Delaware, Joshua T. Heald. Maryland, James Jeffries. Virginia, Edward M. Norton.\n\n9\n\nOhio, V. B. Horton. Indiana, P. A. Hackleman. Illinois, William Ross. Michigan, Walter W. Murphy. Wisconsin, John P. McGregor. Iowa, James F. Wilson. Minnesota, Simeon Smith. Missouri, Allen Hammer. Kansas, A. C. Wilder. California Samuel Bell. Oregon, Frank Johnson. Kentucky, Allen A. Burton. Texas, M. T. E. Chandler. Nebraska, O. H. Irish. District Columbia, George B. Hall.\n\nA delegate from Kentucky suggested that the names of all the states of the Union be called.\n\nThe President then proceeded to call Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nNo responses were made to the calls.\n\nHon. Jacob Benton, of New Hampshire, moved that a committee, consisting of one delegate from each state and territory represented in the Convention, be selected by the delegates thereof, to act on the credentials of delegates, rules and appointments, and that they be instructed to make a report of the number, name and post office address of each delegate, together with rules for the government of the Convention.\n\nA delegate from Indiana suggested that the motion of Mr. Benton be divided--that two committees be appointed, one on credentials, and the other on the order of business.\n\nMr. Spooner, of Ohio: If I understand, it is intended that we should have two committees, or it was so suggested by\n\n10\n\nthe Executive Committee, and we had acted in accordance with that suggestion. I would suggest that there be simply a Committee on Credentials.\n\nMr. Benton accepted the amendment proposed by the delegate from Indiana, and the President called the will of the states, and the committee was constituted as follows:\n\nMaine, Rensselaer Cram. New Hampshire, Jacob Benton. Vermont, Edward C. Redington. Massachusetts, Timothy Davis. Connecticut, E. K. Foster. Rhode Island, Benedict Lapham. New York, Palmer V. Kellogg. New Jersey, Moses M. Webb. Pennsylvania, J. N. Purviance. Delaware, Lewis Thompson. Maryland, William E. Cole. Virginia, Jacob Hornbrook. Kentucky, Charles Pendley. Ohio, Samuel Stoksley. Indiana, John R. Cravens. Illinois, Stephen T. Logan. Michigan, Frank Quinn. Wisconsin, H. L. Rann. Iowa, C. F. Clarkson. Minnesota, John McCusick. Missouri, James G. Gardenhire. Kansas, William A. Phillips. Nebraska, John R. Meredeth. California, Charles Watrous. Oregon, Joel Burlingame. Texas, D. Henderson. District Columbia, James A. White.\n\n11\n\nMr. Noble, of Iowa, moved that a committee, consisting of one delegate from each state and territory, represented in the Convention, be selected by the delegates thereof, to prepare the order of business for the Convention. The motion was carried.\n\nOn calling the roll of the states by the president, the following gentlemen were constituted such committee:\n\nMaine, John L. Stevens. New Hampshire, B. F. Martin. Vermont, Edward D. Mason. Massachusetts, Samuel Hooper. Connecticut, George H. Noble. Rhode Island, Nath. B. Durfee. New York, A. B. James. New Jersey, H. N. Congar. Pennsylvania, William D. Kelly. Delaware, John C. Clarke. Maryland, William P. Ewing. Virginia, John G. Jenks. Ohio, R. M. Corwine. Kentucky, Louis M. Dembitz. Indiana, Walter March. Michigan, Austin Blair. Illinois, Thomas A. Marshall. Wisconsin, Elisha Morrow. Minnesota, S. P. Jones. Iowa, Reuben Noble. Missouri, Thomas G. Fletcher. California, J. C. Hinckley. Oregon, Eli Thayer. Kansas, A. G. Proctor. Nebraska, Samuel H. Elbert. District Columbia, Joseph Gerhard. Texas, G. Moyers\n\n12\n\nA delegate from Pennsylvania moved that the rules of the House of Representatives be adopted for the government of the Convention until otherwise ordered. The motion was carried.\n\nHon. Ephraim Marsh, of New Jersey, moved that the Secretary call the names of the respective States in the order in which they are called in the Congress of the United States, and that as they were called the delegates from each State present their credentials.\n\nMr. Carter, of Ohio: I supposed that we had just constituted a Committee on Credentials, and my purpose for voting for that committee was to get rid of all the labor of doing their work. Now it is proposed to take the labor out of their hands and do it here in the Convention. Having voted it once to be done by the committee I do not want it brought back here, and I shall vote against any such proceeding. I move to lay the motion on the table.\n\nMr. Marsh: I withdraw the resolution.\n\nMr. Greeley, of Oregon: I would like to move a substitute to that resolution. In place of it I move that the roll of the States be now called over, and as each is called the chairman of that delegation present the credentials of that delegation, and if any question arises as to the credentials, or right of any to sit here, let it be referred to the Committee on Credentials.\n\nMr. Carter: I move an amendment. I move to amend the proposition of the gentleman from Oregon, or New York, (Mr. Greeley,) I am not sure which [Laughter], that instead of each delegation presenting their credentials here, they present them to the Committee on Credentials.\n\nMr. Greeley: I accept the amendment of the gentleman from Maryland, or Rhode Island, I am not particular which. [Laughter and applause.]\n\n13\n\nThe motion of Mr. Greeley was then carried.\n\nMr. Carter inquired if the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Greeley) adopted his amendment.\n\nMr. Greeley replied that he had.\n\nA gentleman from Pennsylvania inquired who the chairman of the Committee on Credentials was.\n\nThe President stated that the committee would be announced soon.\n\nMr. Greeley: Now I trust that the Convention sees the propriety of the course I suggested, of producing the credentials at once, here, and referring disputed questions to the Committee on Credentials.\n\nMr. Evarts, of New York: Upon this Committee of Credentials each state and territory has a member; why should not, then, each state and territory commit, its credentials to its member of that committee, to be presented to it?\n\n[Voices: That's the way.]\n\nMr. Evarts: I move accordingly, that the credentials of each delegation be handed to its member of the Committee on Credentials, to be presented to that body.\n\nA delegate of Ohio: A resolution has already passed requiring that the credentials be committed to the chairman of the Committee on Credentials, and I rose to suggest that what is done by an agent is done by the party, and without this motion at all they can pass them through their committee man to the chairman of the committee.\n\nThe President: Is the gentleman from New York satisfied that his resolution is covered by the one passed?\n\nMr. Evarts: Undoubtedly, if it is understood that no call of the states is necessary.\n\n14\n\nThe President: No call is necessary under any resolution yet passed.\n\nThe President announced the reception of the following invitation:\n\nChicago, May 16, 1860.\n\nTo the President of the Republican Convention: The Board of Trade of this city hereby invite the delegates to your Convention, and other visitors to our city, to a short excursion on Lake Michigan; the excursion to leave the dock at Bush Street bridge, near the Richmond House, at five o'clock this afternoon.\n\nSigned, J. S. RAMSEY,\n\nChairman of the Committee.\n\nHon. Aaron Goodrich, of Minnesota: I have been requested, in behalf of the Board of Trade of this city, to elicit, so far as may be by a mere remark and not a speech, what shall be the sentiment of this Convention touching that proposition from the Board of Trade. When I cast my eye about this vast tabernacle, that has been reared by the skill, the taste and the munificence of the ladies and gentlemen of Chicago, and which has been tendered to the great Republican cause without money and without price [great applause], I apprehend that every delegate in this Convention will respond aye to the invitation. I have nothing more to say. [Great applause.]\n\nMr. Dudley, of New Jersey: I move, Sir, that there be a committee of five appointed to inform the Board of Trade that we accept the invitation for five o'clock, and that the committee be appointed by the Chair.\n\nA delegate from Iowa: I move you that it be embraced in that resolution that the thanks of this Convention be tendered to the Board of Trade for their very liberal offer.\n\nAmendment accepted, and resolution as amended adopted.\n\n15\n\n[Three cheers for the ladies of Chicago were called for and heartily responded to.]\n\nMr. Greeley: Have we provided for the Committee on Platform?\n\nThe president: We have not.\n\nMr. Greeley: Then I move we have a call of the states for the purpose of appointing a Committee on Platform.\n\nThe President: Will that be in order until after the permanent organization?\n\nMr. Carter, of Ohio: I move the appointment of a committee of one from each state by the respective delegations from the several states, to report resolutions and a platform, and that the committee be made up in the ordinary manner by calling the roll of the states.\n\nThe President: The gentleman from Oregon has already moved that.\n\nMr. Greeley: I withdraw mine.\n\nMr. B. Oyler, of Indiana: I move to lay the motion on the table, until after the permanent organization.\n\nGov. Reeder, of Pennsylvania: Will the Chair inform the Convention what motion is before it?\n\nThe president stated the motion of Mr. Carter.\n\nGov. Reeder: I rise to oppose the motion. It is the business of this Convention now to perfect its organization. You have appointed a Committee on Credentials, on the Order of Business, and on Permanent Organization, and because we are not organized it seems to me improper.\n\nA voice (on the opposite side of the house): Speak louder--we cannot hear you.\n\n16\n\nGov. Reeder: All I have to say is not worth talking to those at the other end of the platform. I merely desire to say, that I think this motion, at this time, is out of place. It will be time enough to provide for a platform and resolutions when we shall have organized this Convention, and we are appointing committees now simply because we are not organized. This matter of a platform and resolutions is not a preliminary affair. It is not at all necessary to our organization, and therefore it is upon the same footing with the Domination of a candidate, and should wait until the permanent and perfect organization of the Convention before it should be entered upon.\n\nMr. Carter: I made that motion with the view of putting the Convention at work; whether the resolution is passed to-day or to-morrow, it will be passed by the same body of men, and with the view to the declaration of their sentiments. It is a laborious work, and ought to be performed while the Convention is in its vigor. The Chairman cannot fail to have remarked the indisposition to labor, when within fifteen minutes after getting together, a pleasure excursion is voted here. I hope it will be a pleasant one, but I think before we take it, we had better designate those who will enter upon the performances of the sphere of labor in this Convention, and we can do it as well now as at any time.\n\nMr. Eli Thayer, of Oregon: I am opposed to the amendment which has been offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania. I do not consider that the mere appointment of this committee is at all inconsistent with the preliminary business of this Convention. It is not proposed and it is not expected that this committee will report to-day. It is important, as the gentleman who preceded me has said, that this committee should have ample time to consider what shall be the platform of the Republican party in the coming campaign. This, sir, is the great burden of the work of this Convention, and I hope there will be no time lost in appointing\n\n17\n\nthis committee, and that they themselves will lose no time in the labor that is entrusted to their hands. I am, therefore, opposed to this amendment, which proposes delay. The states and territories are ready to name the man who shall constitute for each a member of this committee. The State of Oregon is ready now. [Cries of \"Question.\"]\n\nMr. Hazard, of Rhode Island: The gentlemen who advocated the postponement are right in theory, but it is obvious that the practical operations of this Convention would be retarded by a postponement. I hope, therefore, the motion to postpone will be withdrawn.\n\nGov. Reeder: The gentleman says we are right. If we are right why should we be voted down? It seems to me that when gentlemen concede that we are right, there is generally nothing remaining to do but to carry out the right. We are transgressing the right here, and for the purpose of what? For the purpose of convenience, and because it can make no difference. It may make no difference now, but the time may come, and will come, when it will make a difference, and then this action will be cited as a precedent. I am opposed to making bad precedents. I believe that the only way to pursue is to do it right and in order. If you appoint a committee, what is to prevent that committee from reporting to this Convention before, you have made a permanent organization? And if they do so report, what is to prevent a majority of this Convention passing upon the resolutions and platform before you are organized? Do the gentlemen desire to see that? Do they desire to establish a precedent such as that, which may be used at some great crisis in the future for purposes of evil? It is admitted that we are right, and it seems to me that there the question ends.\n\nMr. Carter: The gentleman from Pennsylvania is begging a little more than I am willing to grant. I do not feel that the first movement is right. There is no such concession in\n\n18\n\nthis quarter of the hall. [Loud cries of \"Question,\" which interrupting the speaker, he took his seat.]\n\nThe motion of Mr. Oyler, of Indiana, to lay over the motion to appoint a Committee on Platform and Resolutions until after the permanent organization of the Convention, was then put to vote and lost.\n\nHon. J. T. Hogeboom, of New York: I move to amend the motion to appoint a Committee on Platform and Resolutions, by adding, \"that the committee report as soon as convenient after the permanent organization of the Convention.\"\n\nMr. Carter: I accept the amendment.\n\nMr. Oyler: We have already appointed a Committee on Credentials, and for what? To know authoritatively and legally who have a right to a seat upon this floor. Now, sir, we are going on to provide for the most important thing that this Convention will do, except the designation of the man who shall bear our standard. I shall not attempt to say that there is one man on this floor not legally entitled to his seat; but we have no evidence of the fact. It is true, we have entered upon this floor, and have arranged ourselves at the different points which we designated by the names of the states, and the fair presumption is, that the men who fill these seats are honestly entitled to them; but that is no proof of the fact, and I undertake to say that this proceeding is against all precedent, and a bad precedent to be set by a Republican Convention. Why this haste? We will \"work in haste and repent at leisure.\" What harm can be done by deferring this until after the Committee on Permanent Organization report, and the Convention organizes itself as a Republican National Convention? We are not that yet. I hope the delegates will consider--that they will stop. Let us be organized before we do, or undertake to do, the most important work we have met to accomplish.\n\n19\n\nMr. Greeley: If there is any question here as to the right of any delegation on this floor, I am willing that this matter should not be urged. But if there is none, then let us have this committee appointed. It will take thirty-six hours for the committee to prepare their report, and the committee should be appointed now so they can have full opportunity. If there is any question as to the right of any delegates, we will waive it.\n\nGov. Boutwell, of Massachusetts: The first thing for us is to be right. We are assembled not for deliberation, but for organization. Let us organize and then deliberate; and until we have perfected our organization, it will be a dangerous precedent to set up here, with reference to a new party that is organized for the government of this country, through a generation, to establish a precedent which, when contestants come here from the Pacific and the South, will lead to difficulties on the floor. We have time enough. Better devote it to the organization of this convention rather than to an. excursion; thankful as we are for the hospitality of the city, we have a greater duty to perform to this country. I move to lay this (Mr. Carter's) resolution on the table.\n\nThe motion of Gov. Boutwell to lay on the table was carried. [Loud cheers.]\n\nMr. Sweetzer, of Massachusetts: I move that when this convention adjourn, it adjourn to meet at 3 o'clock this afternoon. The reason why I move this is, that it seems to me desirable that we should sometime proceed with the business of the convention. If we are going to take up the time in excursions on the lake, I do not know when we will have time for business. I am willing to change the time, if anybody can tell us that we can return from the excursion in time for a meeting of business this evening.\n\nMr. Ben. Eggleston, of Ohio; I move to amend by making the time 10 o'clock to-morrow morning. Now, Mr.\n\n20\n\nPresident, I am very well satisfied that the motion just voted down, in reference to the resolution, will make the convention one day longer, and we delegates from Ohio, some of us, are running out of funds. [Laughter.] It will take a day or two longer. It takes an hour and a half to seat the delegates, and to seat outsiders from two to four hours. [Laughter.] I want it understood that I came here to work, and am not going on the lake; nor is any delegate who came here to work. But I am willing to amend my motion by making it 5 o'clock if desired.\n\nHon. A. B. James, of New York: If we had appointed the Committee on Platform and Resolutions, then we could have with safety adjourned until to-morrow morning; but we have voted that down. We want to make a permanent organization in order that the committee may be appointed, so that it may have the resolutions ready to present to us tomorrow morning.\n\nMr. Judd, of Illinois: It seems to me, sir, if you undertake to assemble this Convention at three o'clock, the business for which the Committee on Credentials and the Committee on Permanent Organization have been appointed will not be accomplished.\n\nA delegate from Minnesota: Make it four, five or six.\n\nMr. Judd: My reason for making the suggestion is, I believe every man here wants his dinner, and they are scattered over the entire city of Chicago, and if they are hungry, as I think they are, before they can get their dinners and meet at the committee room the time will have expired, and the duties will not be performed by the committees unless some gentleman has in his pocket a programme to be followed without consulting anybody in regard to what is to be done by the committee. I say, sir, you must give them time if you expect them to act understandingly; and there is no time now,\n\n21\n\nbetween two and three o'clock, to accomplish the purposes for which these committees have been appointed.\n\nMr. Goodrich, of Minnesota: I would ask the gentleman to name the hour of seven this evening.\n\nMr. Judd: I accept the amendment.\n\nHon. W. D. Kelley, of Pennsylvania: This hall is engaged for to-night, as I observe by a notice in the city papers this morning, for an exhibition of the Zouave drill.\n\nMr. Judd: I beg leave to say that this hall is under the control of this Convention whenever they want it, day or night. [Applause.]\n\nMr. Eggleston: I accept the amendment to meet at 7 o'clock this evening.\n\nMr. Kelley, of Pennsylvania: There is a large portion of this Convention who cannot be got out to a night session. The number is too large to get together for a deliberative Convention at night. I am opposed to a night session, and I hope the proposition for it will be voted down. I am in favor of 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.\n\nMr. James, of New York: If any gentleman who voted for the resolution that was last passed against appointing a Committee on Resolutions will move to reconsider that vote, there will be no difficulty in making an adjournment until tomorrow morning, unless the motion to reconsider is voted down. We will lose less time by this course. I cannot make the motion as I voted against laying on the table.\n\nA delegate: I move to take the resolution from the table.\n\nThe President: I understand the motion to be to reconsider the vote by which the resolution to appoint a Committee on Platform was laid upon the table.\n\n22\n\nA delegate from Michigan: I rise to make that motion. I move that the motion to lay on the table be reconsidered, and the appointment of the Committee on Resolutions be now taken from the table.\n\nMr. Oyler, from Indiana--[Amid cries of \"Question!\" \"Question!\"]: I rise to a point of order. The point I make is this: Is a motion-to reconsider the last resolution passed while there is a motion pending for our adjournment that has not been withdrawn.\n\nMr. Carter, of Ohio: I rise to make an inquiry, if it is in order, whether it is in order to reconsider the vote of this Convention when there is a Lake Excursion pending. [Laughter.]\n\nThe President: It is the opinion of the Chair that the motion to reconsider is not in order, for this reason: That there was pending before this Convention at the time a resolution to adjourn until 7 o'clock this evening, and to that there was an amendment that the hour be fixed at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.\n\nA Voice: That motion is now withdrawn.\n\nThe Chair: Then the other is in order.\n\nA Delegate: I renew the motion.\n\nThe Chair: The question is, shall the vote to lay on the table be reconsidered.\n\nMr. Preston King, of New York: I am satisfied that one of the difficulties in the progress of our business is this excursion on the lake; a very pleasant one, and for which I feel, and I have no doubt the entire Convention feels indebted to the hospitality and generosity of the citizens of Chicago. But our object here is business, and not pleasure. I trust, therefore, that we may make an adjournment which will conform\n\n23\n\nto the convenience of all. If we have old gentlemen here, or others, who, from any cause, do not desire to have an evening session, let us adjourn to meet again at 5 o'clock, and we can, between that time and dark, perform the acts necessary to a complete organization, and thus save at least a day's time of the Convention. If we adjourn until to-morrow we lose certainly an entire day. There is no doubt of that. This Committee on Platform and Resolutions ought to have this evening to sit; and while I did not regard it as material whether that committee was appointed before or after organization, I am willing to concede that it is more regular and more in accordance with the parliamentary usage that we should take the course that was suggested here. Let us now act with a spirit of conciliation and unanimity if we can. I think if we adjourn to 5 o'clock we may get together and then organize and appoint our committees and be prepared to-morrow morning to go to work. That will make it, of course, impossible or inconvenient to go on this excursion, but that we must defer. I move we adjourn to 5 o'clock.\n\nMr. W. E. Coale, of Maryland: I hope members of this Convention will not stultify themselves by first accepting the invitation so kindly tendered to us and then immediately declining it.\n\nMr. King: I am going to move that the proposition in relation to this excursion be referred to our Business Committee, between whom and the Board of Trade an arrangement can be made convenient for both sides.\n\nThe President: The gentleman from New York will please understand there is still pending a motion to take from the table the resolution heretofore laid upon the table.\n\nMr. King: If that is insisted upon we must take the voice of the Convention upon it. My object in making this motion was to see if we could not come to some understanding or reach some conclusion with unanimity. [Cries of \"Question,\" \"Question.\"]\n\n24\n\nThe President: The question is, shall the resolution laid upon the table respecting the platform be now taken from the table?\n\nGov. Reeder: Does it not require a two-third vote under the rules of the House of Representatives to do that?\n\nThe President: I think not.\n\nMr. Sweetzer, of Massachusetts: I moved to adjourn until 5 o'clock; somebody else moved to amend, and adjourn until 9 or 10 o'clock to-morrow morning. My original motion has never been withdrawn.\n\nThe Chair: I understood it to have been.\n\nMr. Sweetzer: The gentleman withdrew his motion. I still ask to have my motion put.\n\nThe Chair: The question is, shall this Convention when it adjourns, adjourn to meet at 5 o'clock this afternoon; and the amendment is to 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.\n\nGov. Cleveland, of Connecticut: I am sure, gentlemen, that you are all disposed to act as you look, as gentlemen. I desire to say to you that we have a very polite and gentlemanly communication from the Board of Trade, and we have by a vote, accepted it. Now, I agree with my friend from New York [Mr. King] that we had better not do it, but to get out of it and treat them fairly, we have only to make a motion to reconsider, and then we can dispose of it in such a manner as the Convention shall see fit, and in such a manner as is consistent with the gentlemanly character of those who made the invitation. In passing a motion to accept it, and then voting to adjourn till 5 o'clock, we seem to throw contempt upon their very civil invitation. If the gentleman will withdraw his motion for the purpose of making a motion to reconsider, I will make that motion, and then we can get out of the trouble.\n\n25\n\nMr. Sweetzer: I withdraw the motion only for that purpose.\n\nThe President: The difficulty is here: If you withdraw your motion touching the hour of adjournment then comes before the Convention, as I understand it, the motion to take from the table the resolution concerning the platform. The motion before the Convention is that we adjourn, when we do adjourn, until to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.\n\nMotion to adjourn was put and lost. [Applause.]\n\nThe President: Now the proposition before the Convention is that when this Convention adjourns, it adjourns to meet at 5 o'clock this afternoon.\n\nHon. Joshua R. Giddings, of Ohio, appeared on the platform amid loud cheers. He said: I rise for the purpose of moving a reconsideration of the vote accepting the invitation received from the Board of Trade to meet there at 5 o'clock for a pleasure excursion I do this, sir, from a sincere conviction that every gentleman who has come here, has come impressed with the solemnity of the business before us. Knowing that we are here to perform high and solemn duties to our country and ourselves, and in justice to our own position and the cause in which we are employed, we should be zealously engaged in the business before us; and here I will take leave to say we have had a precedent recently set before us, far south of this, which should caution us about spending our time here to the wearying of the public mind in witnessing our discussions. If we can close up our business to-morrow by two or three o'clock, it will tell upon the community with a moral force that is incalculable. [Loud and prolonged applause.] Now, Mr. Chairman, I will labor from this time until three o'clock to-morrow in order to attain the object of a final adjournment at that time. [Renewed cheering.] Then, sir, I am willing to accept the kind invitation of the Board of Trade here, and enjoy the pleasure of going upon the proposed excursion.\n\n26\n\nFor the purpose of reconsidering this vote, and then referring it to a committee that they shall make the arrangements with the Board of Trade, so that at our adjournment we will meet them and accept cordially the invitation and take this excursion, I now move that we reconsider the vote by which that motion was carried, accepting the pleasure excursion.\n\nThe motion of Mr. Giddings to reconsider was then put to vote and carried.\n\nMr. Lowey, of Pennsylvania: I move you, sir, that a committee of one from each State be appointed by the Chair to confer with the Board of Trade.\n\nVoices: Make it a committee of five.\n\nMr. Lowry: I will modify my resolution and make it a committee of five.\n\nMr. Hopkins, of Massachusetts: We have already a committee of five appointed upon the order of business, and I suggest that this matter of the invitation of the Board of Trade, of Chicago, can be referred to it. I will make the motion that that reference be had.\n\nA delegate from Vermont: I hope that the committee will at once notify the Board of Trade, as they are already making their preparations for the excursion.\n\nMotion of Mr. Lowry to appoint a committee of five to confer was adopted.\n\nThe chair then appointed the following gentlemen to act as such committee:\n\nMorrow B. Lowry, Of Pennsylvania\n\nAaron Goodrich, Of Minesota\n\nJoshua R. Giddings, Of Ohio\n\nF. P. Blair, Of Maryland\n\nC. F. Cleveland, Of Connecticut\n\n27\n\nThe Convention then, on motion, adjourned until 5 o'clock, P. M.\n\nAFTERNOON SESSION.\n\nThe Convention was called to order at 5:15, P. M., by the temporary President.\n\nTHE INVITATION.\n\nMr. Lowey, of Pennsylvania: In behalf of the committee appointed to confer with the Board of Trade, I would ask leave to make a report. The committee have called upon our friends, the Board of Trade, who invited us to the excursion. They extended to us an invitation and we accepted it. They left immediately and prepared themselves to carry out the arrangement that they had proposed for our enjoyment. They have a perfect fleet down there now in readiness. Before I could get there--before I could find the committee and the parties who have invited us, they had their fleet ready to carry us and large enough to carry us all. They say that if we are so pressed with business we can hold the Convention on the decks of their vessels, if we desire it--and we can, so they say, have their cabins for rooms to caucus in. They are very much disposed to press us and will wait one hour, that will make it six o'clock. We can have ample time to do here this afternoon all that is necessary and then go on the excursion. Now, inasmuch as the people of Chicago extend to us this invitation, I hope it will be unanimously accepted for 6 o'clock.\n\nMr. Carter, of Ohio: I rise to a question of order. There is one question already before the house.\n\nMr. Goodrich, of Minnesota: Say \"as soon thereafter as possible.\" We may, perhaps, have to wait fifteen or twenty minutes thereafter. I hope that we shall go on and perfect our organization, and I believe that can be done within the\n\n28\n\ntime named. I hope the Convention will get ready at once to take the excursion.\n\nMr. Hazard, of Rhode Island: The proposition now made as I understand it, differs only from that of the morning in this: it is now said that it will not interfere with the progress of the meeting--that we may go on and complete our business just as well as not, and take this excursion. [Cries of \"Never mind,\" and much confusion.] But it does not meet the case. I suppose that we are here on important business. We are here, believing as was said this morning [much confusion], believing that the government is pressed on both sides, one half of the Democratic party threatening us with annihilation--and the other [amid loud cries of \"Question,\" the remainder of the sentence was lost.] Suppose you were standing by the sick bed. [Cries of \"Question,\" and great confusion, amid which the speaker took his seat.]\n\nThe question to adjourn to 6 o'clock being submitted, was lost amid much applause.\n\nThe President announced that the reports of the committees were in order, and asked for the report of the Committee on Permanent Organization. [Cries of \"Good.\"]\n\nMr. Hinckley, of California: I ask if it is not in accordance with usage that the Committee on Credentials be called, so that we may know who are members of the Convention.\n\nThe President: I do not know that there is any special order in which committees should report.\n\nMr. Kelley, of Pennsylvania: I move that the report of the Committee on Credentials be called, so that we may know who are members of the Convention.\n\nThe motion of Mr. Kelley was carried.\n\nMr. Comins, of Massachusetts stated, that the Committee\n\n29\n\non Permanent Organization had agreed upon a report, and that its Chairman would be present very soon to present the report to the Convention.\n\nThe President called for the report of the Committee on Credentials, if the Chairman was present.\n\nJudge Tracy, of California: I understand that the Committee on the Order of Business are ready to report in part; and inasmuch as no other committee seems to be ready to report, I propose that the Chair call for the report of that committee.\n\nThe President: I think that if the Committee on Permanent Organization is ready to report, it would be best to receive that.\n\nJudge Tracy: Certainly, if they are in a state of crystallization. [Laughter.]\n\nThe President: I understand that they are ready. Mr. Horton, of the Committee on Permanent Organization, makes a report in part that they have agreed upon Mr. Ashmun, of Massachusetts.\n\nA voice: George?\n\nThe President: Hon. George Ashmun [a voice, \"Good boy\"--Laughter], of Massachusetts, for President of the Convention. [Prolonged cheers.]\n\nThe report in reference to the selection of Permanent, President was unanimously adopted.\n\nA Voice: Nary a \"no.\" [Laughter.]\n\nThe Temporary President appointed Hon. Preston King, of New York, and Carl Schurz, of Wisconsin, to wait upon and conduct the President to the chair. The appearance of Mr. Schurz was the signal for loud cheers.\n\nThe President was conducted to the chair amid enthusiastic\n\n30\n\napplause. When this had subsided he addressed the Convention. SPEECH OF HON. GEORGE ASHMUN.\n\nGentlemen of the Convention--Republicans, Americans:\n\nMy first duty is to express to you the deep sense which I feel of this distinguished mark of your confidence. In the spirit in which it has been offered I accept it, sensible of the difficulties which surround the position, but cheered and sustained by the faith that the same generosity that has brought me here will carry me through the discharge of the duties. I will not shrink from this position, at the same time the post of danger as well as the post of honor. [Applause.] Gentlemen, we have come here to-day at the call of our countrymen from widely separated homes, to fulfill a great and important duty. No ordinary call has brought us together. Nothing but a momentous question would have called this vast multitude here to-day--nothing but a deep sense of the danger into which our government is fast running could have rallied the people thus in this city to-day, for the purpose of rescuing the government from the deep degradation into which it has fallen. [Loud applause.] We have come here at the call of our country, for the purpose of preparing for the most solemn duty that freemen have to perform. We are here in the ordinary capacity as delegates of the people, to prepare for the formation and carrying on of a new administration, and with the help of the people we will do it. [Applause.] No mere controversy about miserable abstractions has brought us here to-day; we have not come here on any idle question. The sacrifice which most of us have made in the extended journey, and in the time devoted to it, could only have been made upon some solemn call; and the stern look which I see, the solemn look which I see on every face, and the earnest behavior which has been manifested in all the preliminary discussions, shows full well that we all have a true and deep sense of the solemn obligation which is resting upon us. Gentlemen, it does not belong to\n\n31\n\nme to make an extended address; it is for me rather to assist in the details of the business that belong to the Convention. But allow me to say that I think we have a right here to-day, in the name of the American people, to say that we impeach the administration of our General Government of the highest crimes which can be committed against a constitutional government, against a free people, against humanity. [Prolonged cheers.] The catalogue of its crimes it is not for me to recite. It is written upon every page of the history of the present administration, and I care not how many paper protests the President may send into the House of Representatives [Laughter and applause], we, here, the grand inquest of the nation, will find out for him and his confederates, not merely punishment terrible and sure, but a remedy which shall be satisfactory. [Prolonged cheers.] Gentlemen, before proceeding to the business of the Convention, allow me to congratulate you and the people upon the striking feature which, I think, must have been noticed by everybody who has mixed in the preliminary discussions of the people who have gathered in this beautiful city. It is that brotherly kindness, and cordial and generous emulation, which has marked every conversation and every discussion, showing a desire for nothing else but their country's good. Earnest, warm and generous preferences are expressed, ardent hopes and fond purposes are declared, but not within the three days I have spent among you all, have I heard one unkind word, uttered by one man towards another. I hail it as an augury of success, and if, during the proceedings of tins Convention, you will unite to perpetuate that feeling, and allow it to pervade all your proceedings, I declare to you, that I think it is the surest and brightest promise of our success, whoever may be the standard bearer in the contest that is pending. [Applause.] In that spirit, gentlemen, let us now proceed to the business--to the great work, which the American people have given into our hands to do. [Applause.]\n\n32\n\nTHE OFFICERS OF THE CONVENTION.\n\nMr. Marsh, of New Jersey: The Committee on Permanent Organization having reported in part, desires to complete its report.\n\nThe committee appointed to recommend officers for the permanent organization of this Convention, have attended to that duty, and report that the officers shall consist of a President, twenty-seven Vice-Presidents and twenty-six Secretaries; and the following gentlemen are recommended to fill the offices respectively named:\n\nVICE-PRESIDENTS. Maine, Samuel F. Hersey New Hampshire, William Haile. Vermont, William Hebord. Massachusetts, Ensign H. Kellogg. Rhode Island, Rowland G. Hazard. Connecticut, Chauncey F. Cleveland. New York, William Curtis Noyes. New Jersey, Edward Y. Rogers. Pennsylvania, Thaddeus Stevens. Delaware, John C. Dark. Maryland, William L. Marshall. Virginia, Richard Crawford. Ohio, George D. Burgess. Indiana, John Beard. Illinois, David Davis. Michigan, Thomas W. Ferry. Wisconsin, Hans Crocker. Iowa, H. P. Scholte. Minnesota, Aaron Goodrich. Missouri, Henry T. Blow. Kentucky, William D. Gallagher. Texas, William T. Chandler. California, A. A. Sargent. Oregon, Joel Burlingame. District of Columbia, George Harrington. Kansas, William W. Ross. Nebraska, A. S. Paddock.\n\n33\n\nSECRETARIES. Maine, Charles A. Wing. New Hampshire, Nathaniel Hubbard. Vermont, John W. Stewart. Massachusetts, Charles O. Rogers. Rhode Island, Rowland R. Hazard. Connecticut, H. H. Starkweather. New York, George William Curtis. New Jersey, Edward Brettle. Pennsylvania, J. Bowman Bell. Delaware, Benjamin C. Hopkins. Maryland, William E. Coale. Virginia, A. W. Campbell. Ohio, H. G. Beebe. Indiana, D. D. Pratt. Illinois, O. L. Davis. Michigan, William S. Stoughton. Wisconsin, L. F. Frisbie. Iowa, Wm. B. Allison. Minnesota, D. A. Secombe. Missouri, J. K. Kidd. Kentucky, Stephen J. Hawes. Texas, Dunbar Henderson. California, D. J. Staples. Oregon, Eli Thayer. Kansas, John A. Martin. Nebraska, H. P. Hitchcock.\n\nOn motion of Mr. Stone, of Iowa, the report of the Committee on Permanent Organization was adopted.\n\nHon. F. P. Tracy, of California, moved that a, committee, consisting of one delegate from each state and territory represented in the Convention, be selected by the delegates thereof, to report resolutions and platform.\n\nMr. Carter, of Ohio, moved to amend, by requiring that\n\n34\n\nall resolutions submitted to the Convention be referred to the proposed committee without debate.\n\nJudge Tracy accepted the amendment.\n\nMr. Judd, of Illinois: I ask the gentleman to suspend for one moment while I make a presentation to the President of the Convention. I am directed, Mr. President, on behalf of one of the working mechanic Republicans of Chicago, to present to you, sir, this emblem of your authority. [Exhibiting a beautifully wrought oak gavel, finished and ornamented with ivory and silver.] It is not, sir, the wood and the ivory and the silver--\n\nMr. Hinckley, of California: [Interrupting.] I rise to a point of order. [\"Sit down;\" \"Go on with the presentation,\" and great confusion.] The Committee on Order of Business has not yet reported; when that committee reports perhaps the Convention will find the adoption or rejection of that report will settle the controversy in reference to the appointment of the Committee on Platform and Resolutions.\n\nThe Chair: The chair holds that that is not a point of order. [Applause.] It may be a ground for the rejection of the proposition of the gentleman from California (Judge Tracy).\n\nMr. Judd: I would not, sir, have attempted to have made this presentation, if I had not supposed that I had the unanimous consent at this time of the Convention. [Applause and cries of \"Go on,\" \"Go on.\"] I was saying to you, sir, that it was not the wood or the ivory, or the silver, of which that little instrument is composed, that renders it valuable. It has, like the Republican party, a history. It is a piece of oak taken from Commodore Perry's flag ship--the Lawrence. [Applause.] It is not from its size that its power is to be felt. It is like the Republican rule, strong but not noisy. [Great enthusiasm.] It is not, that the Republicans require\n\n35\n\na noisy and violent government, or that they require riotously to put down the sham Democracy; but they require and intend to apply to them, and to all those persons who seek disunion, and keep up a cry about destroying our government, the little force necessary to control and restrain them, like the little force which will be necessary for you, Mr. President, to use in presiding over the deliberations of this Convention. [Great cheers.] There is a motto, too, adopted by that mechanic, which should be a motto for every Republican in this Convention--the motto borne upon the flag of the Lawrence--\"Don't give up the ship.\" [Great applause.] Mr. President, in presenting this to you, in addition to the motto furnished by the mechanic who manufactured this, as an evidence of his warmth and zeal in the Republican cause, I would recommend to this Convention to believe that the person who will be nominated here, can, when the election is over in November, send a dispatch to Washington in the language of the gallant Perry: \"We have met the enemy, and they are ours.\" [Terrific cheering.] Voices, \"Name, name.\" Mr. President, in the beginning I should have named Mr. C. G. Thomas, of Chicago. [Hearty applause.]\n\nThe president: In behalf of the Convention, I accept from the hands of the gentleman from Illinois the present made by the Chicago mechanic; and I have only to say today that all the auguries are that we shall meet the enemy and they shall be ours. [Loud cheers.]\n\nMr. Dembitz, of Kentucky, announced that the Committee on Rules and Order of Business, had matured a partial report, defining the manner in which votes should be taken in the Convention. He moved that that report be now taken up.\n\nThe President announced that the question on the appointment of a Committee on Resolutions and Platform was pending.\n\nMr. Dembitz moved that the question on the appointment\n\n36\n\nof a Committee on Platform and Resolutions be postponed until the report of the Committee on Rules and Order of Business had been received.\n\nThe motion of Mr. Dembitz was lost.\n\nThe president: The question is now on the appointment of a Committee on Resolutions and Platform, to whom to refer, without debate, all resolutions or propositions.\n\nGov. Reeder: Mr. President-- voices: \"Name.\"\n\nThe president: Gov. Reeder, of Pennsylvania. [Prolonged cheers.]\n\nGov. Reeder: I understand the resolution before the Convention to be that a committee of one from each state be appointed for the purpose of drafting a Platform and Resolutions. Am I right?\n\nThe president: You are, substantially.\n\nGov. Reeder: Then I move to amend so that it may include the territories.\n\nJudge Tracy: That is the language of the motion. The motion to appoint a Committee on Platform and Resolutions was then carried.\n\nThe President suggested to the Convention the propriety of having a roll of the Convention, arranged under the heads of the different states, made out by the Secretaries, and to be printed for the use of the Convention. He then proposed to call the states for the appointment of a Committee on Resolutions and Platform.\n\nMr. James, of New York: Before that is put, I would suggest that the Committee on Credentials report. We refused to adopt this very resolution before dinner.\n\n37\n\nThe Chair: The Chair is about to call the roll of the states, for the purpose of receiving the names of gentlemen to constitute a Committee on Resolutions.\n\nCOMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS, &c.\n\nThe roll was then called, and the committee constituted as follows:\n\nMaine, George F. Talbott. New Hampshire, Amos Tuck. Vermont, Ebenezer Briggs. Massachusetts, George S. Boutwell. Rhode Island, Benjamin T. Eames. Connecticut, S. W. Kellogg. New York, H. R. Selden. New Jersey, Thomas H. Dudley. Pennsylvania, William Jessup. Delaware, N. B. Smithers. Maryland, F. P. Blair. Virginia, Alfred Caldwell. Ohio, Joseph H. Barrett. Kentucky, George D. Blakey. Indiana, William T. Otto. Michigan, Austin Blair. Illinois, Gustavus Kaerner. Wisconsin, Carl Schurz. Minnesota, Stephen Miller. Iowa, J. A. Kasson. Missouri, Charles L. Bernays. California, F. P. Tracy. Oregon, Horace Greeley. Texas, H. A. Shaw. District of Columbia, G. A. Hall. Nebraska, A. Sidney Paddock. Kansas, John P. Hatterscheidt.\n\nMr. R. H. Corwine, of Ohio: The Committee on Business have a report prepared, but it will be necessary for them to\n\n38\n\nmodify their report in consequence of the action of the Committee on Credentials.\n\nMr. Hopkins, of Massachusetts: In response to the suggestion from the Chair, I move you that the Secretaries of this Convention be directed to prepare a full list of the delegates to this Convention.\n\nA Delegate from Missouri: I would move, as an amendment, that it contain their post office addresses.\n\nThe Chair: That, I suppose, will be attended to. It will be done under the direction of the Secretaries. Motion to print adopted.\n\nThe President then announced the reception of the following communication, which was read to the Convention:\n\nArmory of the Zouave Cadet Guard, May 16, 1860.\n\nTO THE HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.\n\nGentlemen: In compliance with the wishes of the citizens, we are, through the courtesy of the Committee, permitted to occupy the \"Wigwam\" this evening for an exhibition drill, to which we beg to return an invitation to the members of your honorable body. We shall feel highly honored by the presence of all who can find leisure to attend. Tickets of admission will be found at the head-quarters of the different delegations. I have the honor to be,\n\nYour obed't servant,\n\nE. E. ELLSWORTH,\n\nCommander U. S. Zouave Cadets.\n\nOn motion, the invitation to be present was accepted with thanks.\n\nMr. Kaufmann, of Pennsylvania: I would suggest to the\n\n39\n\nCommittee on Platform, before they present to the Convention their report, that they have a large number printed and distributed to all members, so that they can see it. It will be impossible to have it read here so that we can understand it clearly, and members will not know if they are in favor of it or against it. I will make a motion to that effect. The motion was carried.\n\nMr. Voorhies, of Indiana: I move that when this Convention adjourns, it do adjourn until to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.\n\nMany voices--\"Make it ten.\"\n\nThe Chair: It is moved to amend by substituting 10.\n\nMr. Tracy, of California: Nine o'clock is too early. I have come a long way, many thousand miles, to attend this Convention, and am tired, and I can't get up so early.\n\nMr. Kelley, of Pennsylvania: There are several committees who have business to attend to; one of which I know meets at eight, and another at half past eight, and it will be impossible for them to get through their business by nine o'clock. In endeavoring to save an hour, I think the Convention will waste much more time. I think that it would be more judicious to meet at 10 o'clock, when the committees can come in with their reports.\n\nThe motion to fix 10 o'clock as the hour for re-assembling prevailed.\n\nMr. Rollins; of New Hampshire, offered the following resolution:\n\nResolved, That the delegations from each state and territory, represented in this Convention, be requested to designate and report the name of one individual to serve as a member of the National Republican Committee, for the ensuing four years.\n\n40\n\nMr. Nourse, of Iowa, moved to amend the resolution so that the delegations should be left to select members of the National Committee who were not members of the Convention.\n\nThe amendment was accepted, and the resolution adopted.\n\nThe Convention then, on motion, adjourned to Thursday morning, at 10 o'clock.\n\nSECOND DAY.\n\nThe Convention re-assembled at 10 o'clock, pursuant to adjournment. After some time spent in securing to delegates the possession of their seats on the platform, many of which had been taken by persons not delegates, Rev. W. W. Patten, Pastor of the Second Congregational Church, of Chicago, offered the following prayer:\n\nGreat God! Thou art the blessed and the only potentate, King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Thou only hast immortality. Thou dwellest in light that no man can approach unto Thee, whom no man hath seen nor mortal vision can see. We are Thy weak and Thine erring creatures, and we draw nigh unto Thee in all our dependence, that we may avail ourselves of Thine almighty strength and boundless wisdom. We thank Thee that Thou hast given us the great boon of existence; that Thou hast created us in Thine own image; that Thou hast sent us into this world to work out our destiny and to do Thy will; privileging us with the opportunity of being co workers with Thee in Thy benevolent and wise plans. We thank Thee that we had our birth and residence in this land; and that we have come into the world to act our part in these latter days of its history. We pray Thee to qualify us to act that part aright, as men should act who live in this nineteenth\n\n41\n\ncentury. And we pray Thee, oh God, that Thy blessing may rest upon our country. We thank Thee that our fathers who came over here, and laid the foundations of our country in prayer and in faith, desiring here to serve God and benefit their fellow men. And we pray Thee that that same spirit may dwell in their children; and may lead them to bring forth the fruits of righteousness. Help this great people to remember that it is righteousness that exalteth a nation, while sin is a shame unto any people. We thank Thee that Thou hast permitted us to witness this great convocation of the friends of freedom and humanity. We pray for Thy blessing to rest upon all in this Convention who have come hither to represent the friends of freedom in this nation. We beseech of Thee that Thou wilt give them the wisdom which is from above, which begins in the fear of God. Grant that they may be saved from the fear of man, which Thy word declares bringeth a snare; and we pray Thee that they may be enabled to act in manner worthy of the responsibility which has been committed to them. Grant that in their deliberations they may be aided by the spirit, and may be brought to such conclusions as shall be for the furtherance of the cause of liberty and of humanity in this great nation, so that they shall not only acquit themselves to the commendation of their fellow men. but shall be prepared to meet God, and that slave, whose friend God is, at the great day of account. And these mercies we ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen!\n\nThe President announced the reception of the following communication, which was read to the Convention: Chicago, May 17, 1860.\n\nHon. George Ashmun, President of the Republican Convention, Chicago.\n\nDear Sir: The members of the Convention are invited to an excursion over the Chicago and Rock Island railroad, to the City of Rock Island, crossing the Mississippi river bridge to the City of Davenport, Iowa, any day during their stay in Chicago which the Convention may designate. The hour of\n\n42\n\nleaving Chicago and returning subject to the wishes of the Convention. I am respectfully yours,\n\nHENRY FARNUM, President.\n\nOn motion the communication was laid on the table, to be taken up and considered at a later stage of the proceedings.\n\nThe Chair announced the reception of the following communication, which he read to the Convention:\n\nTo the Honorable president of the Republican National Convention.\n\nSir: Can you arrange to send out some effective speakers, to entertain 20,000 Republicans and their wives, outside the building? [Great applause, and cries for \"Gorwin,\" and others.]\n\nThe President announced that the first business in order would be to hear the report of the Committee on the Order of Business.\n\nMr. R. H. Corwine, of Ohio, chairman of the Committee on Rules and the Order of Business, reported the following rules, which were read to the Convention:\n\nRule I. Upon all subjects before the Convention, the states and territories shall be called in the following order: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Michigan, Illinois, Texas, Wisconsin, Iowa, California, Minnesota, Oregon, Kansas, Nebraska, District of Columbia.\n\nRule 2. Four votes shall be cast by the delegates at large of each state, and each Congressional district shall be entitled to two votes. The votes of each delegation shall be reported by its chairman.\n\nRule 3. The report of the Committee on Platform and Resolutions shall be acted upon before the Convention proceeds\n\n43\n\nto ballot for candidates for President and Vice-President. [Applause.]\n\nRule 4. Three hundred and four votes, being a majority of the whole number of votes when all the states of the Union are represented in this Convention, according to the rates of representation presented in Rule 2, shall be required to nominate the candidates of this Convention for the offices of President and Vice-President. [ Applause and cries of \"No! no!\"]\n\nRule 5. The rules of the House of Representatives shall continue to be the rules of this Convention, in so far as they are applicable and not inconsistent with the foregoing rules.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nMr. James, of New York: Before we proceed to act on those rules, I wish to say, that when this committee met there were but seventeen out of twenty-three members present. That the Fourth Rule, which has been adopted, was only adopted by one majority, and as a member of that committee I propose to offer a substitute, which I will now read, as follows:\n\nThe President: Will the gentleman waive it until the Fourth Rule, comes before the meeting?\n\nMr. James: I suppose the amendment should be submitted before we enter upon the duty of considering the report.\n\nThe President: It will be much more convenient for the gentleman to present his amendment when it comes up.\n\nMr. James : It is a minority report.\n\nThe President: Then it is in order.\n\nMr. James: The minority of the Committee on Business and Rules, propose the following amendment to the Fourth Rule, as a minority report:\n\n4. That a majority of the whole number of votes represented\n\n44\n\nin this Convention, according to the votes prescribed by the Second Rule, shall be required to nominate a candidate for President and Vice-President. [Applause, and cries of \"No! No! \"]\n\nThe President: The first question is upon the first rule.\n\nMr. Reeder, of Pennsylvania: I desire to ask this House a question.\n\nThe President: Mr. Carter, of Ohio, has the floor.\n\nMr. Reeder: I beg the gentleman's pardon; I had not seen him.\n\nMr. Carter, of Ohio: We are approaching a labor that is going to involve our constituencies in this Convention, and there is no report from the Committee on Credentials. [Voices: \"We can't hear you.\"] Before entering upon the consideration of this report, which I perceive is to be litigated, I propose to go into the battle with the army organized. [Voices: \"That's correct,\" \"Good,\" and so on.] Therefore, I move the postponement of the consideration of the report of the Committee on the Order of Business, until we have a report from the Committee on Credentials.\n\nMr. Reeder: That is precisely the suggestion I was going to make.\n\nMr. Carter: I knew you were thinking just about right.\n\nThe motion of Mr. Carter, to postpone the consideration of the report of the Committee on the Order of Business, was carried.\n\nMr. Benton, of New Hampshire, and the Chairman of the Committee on Credentials, ask leave to submit the following report:\n\nThe Committee on Credentials report herewith the names and number of delegates from the several states as being elected, and deem it proper to say that the States of Pennsylvania\n\n45\n\nand New Jersey have appointed four delegates from each Congressional District, and eight Senatorial delegates, instead of appointing delegates and alternates; and Iowa has appointed eight delegates from each Congressional District, and sixteen Senatorial delegates. [Laughter.] The Committee also present the names of the delegates present and duly elected from the District of Columbia and the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska, leaving it for the Convention to decide whether they shall be permitted to vote in this Convention.\n\nAll of which is respectfully presented in behalf of the Committee.\n\nMr. Benton: The states and territories are specified, and I can read them if the Convention desire it, although the chairman did not deem it necessary, as they are in the specification accompanying the report.\n\nGov. Reeder: I desire to know if this committee has reported what states are represented and entitled to a vote in this Convention. Have they so reported?\n\nMr. Benton: They have so reported.\n\nMr. Davis, of Massachusetts: I desire to have that portion of the report read, stating which states are represented and entitled to a vote in this Convention, with the number of votes to each.\n\nMr. Benton: In accordance with the suggestion, I will read:\n\nMaine, 16 New Hampshire, 10 Vermont, 10 Massachusetts, 26 Rhode Island, 8 Connecticut, 12 New York, 70 New Jersey, 28 Pennsylvania, 54\n\n46\n\nMaryland, 10 Delaware, 6 Virginia, 20 Kentucky, 24 Ohio, 46 Indiana, 26 Missouri, 18 Michigan, 12 Illinois, 22 Texas, 8 Wisconsin, 10 Iowa, 8 California, 8 Minnesota, 8 Oregon, 5 Kansas, 6 Nebraska, 6 District of Columbia, 4\n\nHon. Timothy Davis, of Massachusetts, moved that so much of the report as related to the delegation from Texas be referred back to the committee.\n\nMr. Wilmot, of Pennsylvania: I move to amend the motion of the gentleman from Massachusetts, so as to include the States of Maryland, Kentucky and Virginia. I had foreseen, before I came to this Convention, that the question would very properly arise as to the propriety of admitting those states to a full vote in this Convention. We are a Convention of delegates representing a party having constituencies at home. This is not a mass convention, in which each man's voice is to be heard, and in which a mere numerical majority of all who choose to attend controls the result, but this is a Convention of delegates representing a constituency, and having constituents at home to represent. [Great applause.] Now, sir, can it be possible that those gentlemen who come here from states in which they cannot maintain an\n\n47\n\norganized party--is it possible that they are to come here and by a full vote control the action of the Convention? I can see nothing better calculated to demoralize a party, and to break it up, than just such a proceeding. Why, sir, this nomination is to be the nomination of the Republican party in the Union, not the nomination of respectable gentlemen who may belong to the Republican party in Virginia, Maryland or Kentucky. What are the facts in Maryland? In Maryland, thirty gentlemen assembled in Baltimore for the purpose of sending a delegation to this Convention. Did they assemble as the representatives of a party? Not at all. They have never had a Republican party in Maryland, and, in my judgment, there will be no such party there until the people of the free states shall place this government in different hands, and relieve them from the tyranny which now weighs them down. There are respectable gentlemen in Maryland, many of them who sympathize with us and our cause; and so there are in every Southern State; but they have not the power to maintain a party organization. These gentlemen are not here as the representatives of any organized party at all. If this thing is to be done, the result of the deliberations of this Convention, respecting its nominee, may be anything other than such a result as would be produced by the voices of those only who are properly represented upon this floor. Admit this precedent, sir, and hereafter some candidate, or rather the friends of the candidate, may, in their anxiety to procure a result favorable to their wishes, at the next Convention we shall have, carrying this thing still further, delegates not representing any party--but there will be gentlemen, excellent gentlemen, no doubt, coming in here from every state of the Union, brought here by influences from the North, but not sent here by a party at home. That will be the result. [Applause.] Sir, they may possibly come here in this manner, in a situation of this kind. I cast no imputation upon the gentlemen who come here to this Convention. I have full confidence in their integrity and in the earnestness and zeal with which they are enlisted in the cause;\n\n48\n\nbut, sir, in another Convention that may assemble here, gentlemen may come from South Carolina, from Alabama, from Arkansas, and from Mississippi, for the express purpose of controlling, demoralizing and breaking up the Republican party. [Loud cheering.] Now, sir, if this is not stopped, there is no help for us. The true policy of the Republican party is to allow all its members a voice, but in proportion to their numbers. The committee have reported here that three hundred and four votes shall be necessary to a choice--a majority of the votes of all the states, when a large portion of those states are not represented here. Why have they done that? Why have they broken down the plain old Republican rule, that the majority--the real majority--shall control? Because they know it is necessary for the accomplishment of some object. That rule, if adopted, would establish one precedent in the admission of men here to vote who are not representatives of a party; and then they adopt another mischievous rule for the purpose of rectifying the first. What we want is, that the representatives of the Republican party here should vote for a candidate for President, and that the majority should control. [Tremendous cheering.] That is what we desire. The rule that is proposed, would introduce upon us thirty or forty votes that do not represent any party whatever. They are gentlemen of character, gentlemen of worth, gentlemen who sympathize in this movement heartily; but they represent no organized party--they have no constituency at home. You admit them here, and then to avoid the consequences of your first wrongful act, you require three hundred and four votes for the nomination of a candidate. I, therefore, move that this question respecting Texas, embraced in the first motion, embrace, also, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, the territories of Nebraska and Kansas, and the District of Columbia, and all be referred back to this committee.\n\nMr. Ewing, of Pennsylvania: I deprecate the sentiment of my friend from Pennsylvania. [Voice--\"That's the talk.\" Applause.] We all come here as Republicans, and those men\n\n49\n\nwho came here from the slave states named deserve tenfold more credit than those who come here from the free states. Why, sir, disfranchise our friends from Virginia, a border state--a free state so far as concerns Western Virginia--my neighbors! Sir, shall they be disfranchised in this Convention of Republicans, [voices--\"No, no!\"] by Pennsylvania, New York or New England, because they have the courage to stand up in a slave state for Republicanism and for free thought? [Applause] While, sir, we may not be willing to give those states the full power of the whole delegation of the whole state, yet in the name of God shall they not represent their immediate districts? It cannot be that a Convention of Republicans, assembled here from the whole United States, will ever adopt such a doctrine as to disfranchise our friends that come from the Southern States. Why, sir, I was mortified at such a sentiment coming from my distinguished friend from Pennsylvania, that these gentlemen who have come here in defiance of the sentiment which prevails in their own states; have come here as bold and independent Republicans, and who are as good Republicans at home as here, should be voted out. They are representatives of the party so far as there is a party in those states, and we wish to build up the party in these states. I hope that this Convention never will adopt the principle to exclude these gentlemen who come here from the Southern States, because we may yet take a candidate from one of those Southern States. I know not what may be the result.\n\nMr. Armour, of Maryland: Mr. Chairman, I stand before this Convention and this assembled host of freemen a representative from the State of Maryland. [Applause and three cheers for Maryland.] I claim to be as true a Republican as the distinguished member of the \"People's\" party from Pennsylvania. [Laughter and much applause.] I have dared more than he has ever dared. [Applause.] I have periled more than he has ever periled. He lives in a free state; he breathes the pure air of the gallant old Keystone State, and\n\n50\n\nyet they have not arrived at a condition in which they are willing to avow themselves Republicans. [Great applause.] I faced the mob in Baltimore; I faced the mob urged on by the aristocracy of the custom house, menial hirelings of this corrupt administration. I went to my home and found that I had been burned in effigy and suspended by the neck because I dared to avow myself the friend of freedom. We met in Baltimore in obedience to the call of the National Committee. We have a party in Maryland, and we can poll from three to four thousand votes, [a voice, \"good for you,\" and applause,] and if ever we expect Republican principles to prevail all over this land, we must organize, and you who live in the northern states must fraternize with us, and not despise the day of small things. [Applause.] There is the coat of arms of my grand little commonwealth, \"CRESCITE ET MULTIPLICAMINI,\" and that shall be the motto of the Republicans of Maryland. We will grow, and we will increase, until Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and all the states of the northwest will welcome our gallant little commonwealth to the band of states which have ever been unshrinking in their devotion and their loyalty to the cause of human freedom. I scorn the idea. I am proud to despise the sentiment which says that northern influences have been brought to bear upon us. We are unpurchased and unpurchaseable. [Loud applause.] And we tell Pennsylvania to put that in her pipe and smoke it. [Laughter and applause] Exclude us from the Convention if you will--turn us out of these doors; [cries of \"No,\" and \"we won't,\"] we will go home, notwithstanding, and nominate an electoral ticket, and under the blessing of Heaven we will do all that we can do to advance the common cause of humanity. I beg not for northern votes to sustain us here. I am sure there will be a spontaneous outburst of the free sentiments and the true sympathy of the people here. And if this Convention attempts to exclude us, that large assemblage of people will frown it down. [Applause.] I have vindicated myself. I have vindicated my co-delegates.\n\n51\n\nI have vindicated my state. Your applause assures me of the fact, and I will give way. [Three cheers for Maryland.]\n\nMr. James Wyse, of District of Columbia: Mr. President, I come from the capital of this great and mighty republic, and like my friend, I am descended from old Maryland. [Applause.] I stand in this mighty Convention congregated in the queen city of the great west, the representative from the District of Columbia, of the great Republican party. [Loud cheers.] I stand here the representative of the persecuted and down-trodden and disfranchised people that have no vote for President, no voice in Congress, and no voice anywhere to legislate for us, and yet our territory contains a hundred thousand freemen. I came to this city as a representative of the Republican party for no sinister purpose, but for the people of that disfranchised district. We claim from the people of this country the right of franchise; we claim the right of citizenship; we claim to be heard in this discussion, and not to be silent longer in this republic. We have no legislature. We ask of Congress a legislature, and we intend that they shall give us a territorial legislature and a representation in Congress--that we shall have our own laws, and that Congress will confirm them--that we will be a people, and have a voice in this great republic. I come here to tell this people that they have trodden down the Republican party with the iron heel of despotism, worse and more tyrannical than that of Russia or the Austrian Empire. What has the Buchanan administration done? Why sir, they have gone into the workshops of the government to seek out a Republican, and then turn him out to grass, taking the bread from his family if he did not bow down to the slave power. But thanks be to God, we come here like the gentleman from Maryland, daring to be Republicans; and we will baptize that District of Columbia over again; and, by the help of God, we will exclude slavery from it in less than two years.\n\nMr. Blakey, of Kentucky: Having just arrived from a meeting of the Committee on Platform, I understand that a proposition\n\n52\n\nhas been made that this Convention shall exclude the delegates from the state which in part I represent. I should not have been more surprised had I been told that a proposition had been gravely made that the ashes of Washington should have been placed without the pale of this continent. [Cheers.] I should not have been more surprised had I been told that a proposition had been gravely made that the remains, the precious remains, now silently resting under the shade of Ashland, be removed from the precious soil of Kentucky; nor should I have been more surprised had I been informed that it had been gravely proposed that Cassius M. Clay [Applause.] should be buried. Who dare propose, I say, to institute a proposition here that the free born sons of Kentucky and of Virginia, and of Maryland, and of the District of Columbia, or even of Georgia, or any southern state, have not just as good a right to be Republicans and breathe free air, and be free men upon American soil as the old Keystone State. [Applause.] Gentlemen, I have but one word more to say, and I want it to be heard, and I wish it could be heard from one end of the continent to the other. I had the honor of a seat and a prominent position, it was a position of which my children and their children will be proud, in the Republican Convention of 1856. [Applause.] When the vote of Kentucky was called for, for candidate for the Vice Presidency I had the honor then and there to announce that Kentucky had been experimenting; that we had held up the Declaration of Independence before the mirror, and saw reflected the platform of the 17th of June, 1856; that we held up the precious ordinance of 1787, and saw reflected the Wilmot proviso; [applause,] and that Kentucky cast her vote for David Wilmot. [Laughter and applause.] Thus stood Kentucky in 1856 ! Can I be forgiven for that sin? [Applause and laughter.]\n\nMr. Wm. A. Phillips, of Kansas: Mr. President and gentlemen of the Republican Convention, I stand here with my fellow colleagues to represent the people of Kansas. The\n\n53\n\nRepublicans of Kansas, whom we have the honor to represent upon this floor, sent us here expecting that we would have several grave issues to meet, but they did not expect that the representatives of Kansas would have to appear upon this floor with proof that Kansas is an integral part of the Republican party. Kansas and the Republican party were born together. [Hearty applause.] Its first impulses were stirred by the wrongs of her people; the party was baptized in her blood. [Rapturous applause.] The people of Kansas in 1856 appeared in the National Republican Convention and threw a vote for the then Republican nominee. The people of Kansas throughout the whole of their struggle have vindicated in Kansas the Republican party, their cause and their principles. It may be said to-day that Kansas is not a state--Kansas is not a territory--it is scarcely a state; but the cause of liberty is identified with her history. She has a history and a glorious one. This administration, whose duty it was to foster this infant state, has dealt with Kansas with a harsh rule. The hand of the administration, that she has felt so often, has been a hard, stern hand; and all has been done to keep her back, and prevent her from rising and bearing aloft the banner of Republican liberty. If Kansas had accepted the Lecompton bribe she would have been a state to-day. If Kansas had not been one of the strongest and best united organizations in the Republican party, she would have been received into the Union years ago by the Democrats at Washington. [Applause.] But Kansas scorned the Lecompton bribe, and stands there to-day, and will stand forever, a Republican state. [Great cheers.] Mr. Chairman, Kansas does not expect to come into this Convention and be alienated from the Republican party. She stands now a territory because she would not share or accept the spoils of the Democratic party. She has alienated herself from everything to identify her people and her destiny with the cause of the National Republican party; and now I don't think the time has come when the Republicans can alienate her from them. [Loud cheers.] I do not wish to consume the time of this\n\n54\n\nConvention by arguing this point. I do not think the gentlemen of this Convention will demand that Kansas shall be excluded. She has come here to say if she have preferences she will exercise these preferences or leave this hall. Kansas believes in the right, which has carried her through many a dark hour; and she believes that it is principle alone which will carry the Republican cause through in triumph.\n\nMr. Wilmot, of Pennsylvania: I regret exceedingly that I was misunderstood by the gentlemen who have responded to me in behalf of the States of Maryland, Virginia and Kentucky. I made no proposition to exclude those gentlemen from a fair representation upon this floor--[Applause]--none at all. I proposed that certain states be referred back to the committee for the purpose of an investigation, to see what vote they are entitled to on this floor.\n\nMr. Blakey: I was not present when the proposition was made.\n\nMr. Wilmot: In the course of my argument, for the purpose of enforcing the propriety of my amendment, I presented certain considerations that seemed to me to be entitled to weight, to wit: that gentlemen who come here representing no party--having no constituencies--were not entitled to vote for their states upon this floor. That was the simple proposition that I made. Now, I desire that the facts be inquired into. Will it be pretended that thirty gentlemen meeting at the city of Baltimore, not delegates from the counties of the state, but gentlemen assembling together--have a right to represent and select twenty delegates?\n\nMr. Armour: Will you allow me to correct you?\n\nMr. Wilmot: Certainly.\n\nMr. Armour: There has existed in Baltimore city, for a number of years, a Republican association. That association, in obedience to the call of the National Executive Committee,\n\n55\n\nissued calls for the Republicans of Maryland to meet in Baltimore, at such a time specified in the call, for the purpose of nominating an electoral ticket and sending delegates to this Convention. When that Convention met every Congressional district in the State of Maryland was represented. [Applause.] There were gentlemen from the eastern shore and the western shore--from the extreme east to the extreme west. There were, perhaps, only thirty-five or forty delegates; but there were at least 150 or 200 Republicans in the Convention. Baltimore city sent only eleven delegates, and therefore she was entitled to only eleven votes, yet the hall was full of Republicans. My town is full of Republicans, and I wish to say in reference to the remark of Judge Wilmot, that we have no party in Maryland, I have the assurance of a gentleman, and know it to be true, that in my town--which polls only about 900 votes--we can poll 300 votes at the next election, nearly half the votes of the town--not of the district. That is all I have to say.\n\nMr. Wilmot: The explanation that the gentleman has made, if it does anything, would enforce the propriety of my motion. What I have desired is that the committee should investigate this subject and report the facts in respect to these states. That is what I have desired. If Maryland be properly represented here; if there be a party in Maryland, whether great, large or small, that stands as an organized party in the field, that is the point; not that there maybe Republicans scattered over the state. There may be a majority in the town in which the gentleman lives. There may be individual Republicans scattered over that state in every county, but have they combined together in a Republican organization, and do they come here representing an organized party? This is the question I desire this committee to inquire into, and that is the very object of the motion. The committee might report that Maryland was entitled to her senatorial votes on this floor, and that she was entitled to a vote from such and such a district. If they so reported upon the facts\n\n56\n\nbefore them I shall be willing to accept that report. So too, as to Virginia, if the committee reported that certain districts in Virginia took regular action as an organized party and elected their delegates, and were entitled to so many votes in virtue of the delegates from such districts, I should be willing to accept that report, and in addition, I should stand ready to give them the two electoral votes of their state. So in respect to Texas. But what are the facts about her, gentlemen? I speak of it upon nothing but rumor and as a rumor --I don't assert the fact, for I know nothing about it--but I am told that the gentlemen who are here from Texas, or a majority of them, are not residents of the state at all, and that they have no Republican organization in that state. It may be said that the delegates of Oregon are not residents of that state. But we know that Oregon has a formidable party--a minority it is true; but we know that they held a regular State Convention, and that they elected their delegates regularly, and that some of those gentlemen have given deputations to certain distinguished gentlemen here, and that these gentlemen are entitled to their seats; so if Texas has held a regular convention and elected her delegates, and they find it inconvenient to attend as delegates, and they have deputed others to represent them, then, gentlemen, they are entitled to seats upon this floor. But if there has been no convention --no movement in Texas, if nothing having the semblance of a party has taken action in the State of Texas, and certain gentlemen are here for the purpose of controlling this result, then I say it is mischievous, it is demoralizing; it will break up any party under God's Heaven. Will the distinguished gentleman, a candidate before this Convention, or rather his friends, consent that they shall be overslaughed or defeated by the votes of gentlemen representing no party, by gentlemen having no constituents? Will the friends of the candidate which Pennsylvania will present submit to such a procedure? If they do, it would be extremely hard--it would be difficult to enforce submission. This was the object of my proposition. I wish, gentlemen, instead of indulging in\n\n57\n\ndeclamation and rhetorical flourishes, in appeals to the ashes of Washington, had consented to meet the question fairly by argument. I raised no question with the good gentleman from Maryland as to who has dared more or suffered more in this cause. I concede to him and his associates the palm of victory in that. But if every Republican who has suffered in the cause of freedom is to come in to settle this question, then the little territory of Kansas can control this Convention-- under that rule she has the right to control it. She has poured out her blood freely in this cause. The graves of our murdered sons are scattered all over her territory. If the question is as to those who have suffered in the cause of Republicanism, who have been mobbed, and those are to come here and control this Convention, then let us adjourn and invite Kansas to come here in a body, man, woman and child, and let them say whom the Republican party shall nominate as candidate for President. The simple question is, are all the \"good men\" here from Virginia, Maryland, Texas and certain other districts as representatives, or are they here as individual Republicans? I don't question their Republicanism. I have no doubt upon that point. I did not intimate that they had been purchased by money; I cast no imputations upon their integrity; but this I do assert, that if this precedent be adopted, that at the next Convention the sympathies or the anxiety of friends to secure their candidate may be employed to secure delegations here from every state of the Union, not because there is a party there to represent, but because the anxiety of the friends of candidates will bring men here. Would it be difficult to find twelve men in the State of Tennessee who are Republicans? I doubt not if inducements were held out to them they could come here from Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and all the southern states. Then what would be the result? Instead of requiring 304 votes, you would have to require that there should be 400 votes. Why require 400, or why require 304, except that you have already virtually demoralized the Convention? If you have men here who do not represent an organized party at home, they should\n\n58\n\nnot cast votes for their states for a Republican President. It was for the purpose of inquiry, not to proscribe or disfranchise anybody, that my motion was made.\n\nMr. Montgomery Blair, of Maryland: Will you permit a delegate from Maryland to say one word. I wish merely to say to the Convention--[Voices \"Louder!\"] I can only make myself heard over a small space. But I must say one word, and that is, so far as my feelings are concerned, and of a large majority of those with whom I am associated on this floor, the sentiments uttered by the honorable gentleman from Pennsylvania meet our entire accord. [Applause.] We wish no larger voice in this deliberation than the gentlemen of the Convention with whom we are associated shall deem our members and those whom we represent entitled to have on this floor. [Cheers.] We do not come here, (and I speak for myself and, I believe, a large portion of those representing slave states on this floor,) we do not wish to stand here as dictating to those who have to elect the candidates. We are willing, we ask only to be heard, and if permitted we will give our votes in the direction which we think ought to be taken by the Convention; but we do not wish, and we will endeavor so to act--and I am sure I represent the sentiments of those who are associated with me--upon this point as not to give any controlling voice in the Convention. [Applause.] That is all I have to say upon the subject. I would be glad to have some action, if the Convention deem it necessary, taken upon the point which the honorable gentleman from Pennsylvania has, I think, timely made before this body, and I therefore second his motion. [Applause.]\n\nGov. Cleveland, of Connecticut: I regret exceedingly the remarks of the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Mo"
