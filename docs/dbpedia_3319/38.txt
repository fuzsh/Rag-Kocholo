Hon. Alanson BARLOW

Aug. 28, (1858) ae. 77, Ashland, N.Y., (father of Allen Barlow, of Binghampton), and Mrs. MARY ANN BARLOW, wife of Hon. A.B., May 11, ae. 70. Mr. Barlow belonged to a family whose members have done the state some service. He was a nephew of Joel Barlow, of revolutionary memory, who deserves honorable mention among the statesmen and men of letters of that period. His âColumbiadâ is still the only American national epic, the only example of a poet daring to celebrate in heroic verse contemporary or recent historic events. As a politician he ranked among the leading men of the organizing epoch of this government. He was the friend and coadjutor of Madison and Jefferson, to whose school of politics he belonged, or rather helped to found. His death was occasioned by the fatigue of a forced journey to join Napoleon, in council at Wilna, in Poland. In personal appearance Alanson Barlow much resembled his uncle, judging by the portrait in the Cyclopedia of American Literature. There was inherited, also, the diplomatist's inflexibility of purpose, his profound reserve of manner and of expression â a man of more thought than speech, giving one the impression of a plain, solid cast of character, in keeping with his robust and iron frame; a man whose word was a bond; trespassing a hair's breadth upon no man's rights; not wearing his heart upon his sleeve â a friendly but deep-seated heart. Though rarely expressing personal interest in spiritual truth, unless drawn to it by others, yet his manual of devotion was found in many places literally worn away, though it had not been long in use. The biography of Mrs. B., in its main features, would be that of the early inhabitants of this region, a generation of energetic men and women, exchanging the refinement and culture of New England for lonely homes in this then wilderness. They derived from their frugal and simple habits a hardiness of constitution, an elastic vigor of frame, a power of enduring the rigors and changes of this austere climate â nature's compensations to the pioneers of civilization. They are gone. The husband, the father, venerable judge â the friend, the wife, the mother, the Christian â have bowed to the common lot. The torn fibers of the disturbed soil have knit together again above their place of rest. Thus the links that bind us to the past are broken. The outlook is toward the future, and the future is eternity. [Source: Annual OBITUARY NOTICES OF EMINENT PERSONS who have died in the United States FOR 1858; BY HON. NATHAN CROSBY; BOSTON: JOHN P.

Martha BENNETT

Green Co., N.Y., Aug. ___, ae. 76, widow of P.W. Bennett, mother of T.R. Bennett, inspector of the 18th precinct police, New York city. Mrs. B. was a noble-minded woman, and much beloved by a large circle of friends. She was born in Newark, N.J. At the commencement of the revolutionary war her father, John Chesters, was seized by a gang of bandits in England, and brought to New York city against his will, for the purpose of fighting the Americans. His father, William Chesters, despatched a man to America with $200 to ransom the captive; but the British officer to whom the application was made detained both money and agent, and gave John 25 lashes on the bare back for asking to be set at liberty. Young Chesters then deserted, taking with him his horse and such things as he could conveniently carry; and, sympathizing with the Americans in their struggle for liberty, lost no time in joining the American army. He was one of Gen. Washington's main men, and, after faithfully serving his adopted country for seven years, received an honorable discharge, with a medal. During the struggle for liberty by the Americans, young Chesters, then only 19 years of age, with four others, was watching one night for smugglers on the banks of the Passaic River, when they were surprised by a body of British soldiers, who had landed with the intention of taking Newark. Chesters and his companions, seeing that resistance against such powerful odds were useless, fled for their lives; but three of them were overtaken and murdered. John succeeded in gaining the court house, and, while entering the door, three bullets were fired at him; but, fortunately, they lodged in the door without doing further damage. Chesters sounded the alarm to Generals Ray, Knox and Cummings, then asleep in a hotel near by, who instantly marshaled their forces, and saved the town. Incensed at their defeat, the British offered a large reward for young Chesters's head, which, however, they did not get. He died in Newark, when only 30 years of age.

Ezekiel EADS

A Man Without Ears

Ezekiel Eads, who died in Greene county New York, in the spring of 1885, was surely a fit subject for a dime museum, even though he never descended to that level. Strictly speaking, Eads was in several respects a most remarkable creature. He was born without ears, not even having apertures where his ears should have been. His deformity, sad as it was, may be said to have been partly alleviated by the [undecipherable] construction of the inner portion of his head, which enabled him to hear common conversation through his mouth.When addressed he would instantly open his mouth and readily give answers to interrogations put to him in an ordinary tone of voice. But Ezekiel's lack of ears was not his only distinction. He had a heavy crop of black hair spotted with white, the spots themselves being in the exact shape of human ears, feet, hands, etc. When he was quite a small baby it was noticed that his black hair was interspersed with oddly shaped spots of white, which, however, did not take on their distinctive shapes until after he had passed his fifteenth year.When Mr. Eads died he left one son, aged forty-five, whose hair was as black as coal, not a single gray hair being discernible, and another son, thirteen years of age, whose hair was as gray as that of a man of seventy.âWheeling (W.

Rufus H. KING

Hon. RUFUS H. KING, of Catskill, New York, died there at his home on Broad Street, September 13, 1890. His ancestry may be traced as follows: Elder Thomas King, the founder of the family in New England, was a resident of Scituate, Mass., as early as 1634. He was thrice married. By his first wife, Sarah, he had six children. He left an interesting will dated 1691. Deacon Thomas King, second son of Elder Thomas, born 1645, married (1) Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Clapp, by whom he had five sons and four daughters. She died in 1698, and the next year he married (2) Deborah Briggs, who died in 1711. Thomas died the same year, leaving a will. Ichabod King, fourth son of Thomas, was born in Scituate in 1680, and died in Rochester, Plymouth County, Mass., in 1753. He had three wives, (1) Hannah ââ, (2) Judith, widow of Job Gibbs, and (3) Mary Barlow, and ten children. Ebenezer King, second son of Ichabod, had by his first wife, Sarah, three children. Consider King, son of Ebenezer, was born in Freetown, Mass., May 13, 1738, and married Sarah Palmer, September 1, 1760. He died March 16, 1786. Reuben King, third son of Consider, was born in Rochester, Mass., March 22, 1765; married Elizabeth Frisbee, and had eight children. Rufus King, the eldest son of Reuben, born June 1, 1791, in Rensselaerville, Albany County, New York; married January 6, 1818, Mary, daughter of Nicholas and Hannah (Sisson) Cornell, and died May 21, 1821. He had two children. Hon. Rufus H. King, the subject of this memoir, was the only son of Rufus preceding, and was born in Rensselaerville, January 20, 1820. He was a graduate of the Wesleyan University at Lima, New York, and began the study of law with an uncle in Michigan, continuing the same with Danforth K. Olney at Windham, later on with Peter H. Sylvester at Coxsackie. Mr. King was admitted to the bar in 1845, and began the practice of law at Coxsackie in partnership with J. C. Van Dyke. He was married the same year to Lucia H. Dwight, of Windham, who survives him. They had no children. In 1847 Mr. King removed to Catskill, where he entered into partnership with John Adams. Upon the death of Mr. Adams, Mr. King became associated with Peleg C. Mattoon, and afterward with D. K. and J. B. Olney. After J. B. Olney's death, the firm became Olney & King, and later on King & HallockâJoseph Hallock having taken the place made vacant by the death of D. K. Olney. This partnership continued until April 19, 1880, when Mr. King withdrew from the practice of law. He did not cease, however, to take an active interest in business affairs, and became trustee of a number of large estates, President of the Catskill Savings Bank, and Director in other institutions. Mr. King was in politics a Whig and afterward a Republican. In 1854 he was elected to the 34th Congress from his district. In 1860 he was one of the Presidential electors of Lincoln and Hamlin. In 1865 he was made President of the Catskill National Bank, and served for two years. In 1880 he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention, and supported the nomination of General Grant for President. Mr. King was greatly interested in the affairs of his own town, and ever ready to aid any plan for its improvement. He was a member of the Presbyterian church, and the funeral services were held there, the Rev. Dr. Johnson, of Cohoes, an old friend of Mr. King's, with others, conducting the service. The interment was in the village cemetery. Members of the Greene County bar met at the court house on September 16, to honor Mr. King's memory, and many tributes were paid to his acknowledged worth. The Trustees of the Catskill Savings Bank and the Directors of the Tanners' National Bank also passed appropriate resolutions. The particulars of ceremonies have been preserved in a memorial pamphlet, a copy of which has been placed in the library of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society. â R. K.

William B. SMITH

Death of William Burr SMITH

Remains Brought to Batavia (IL) for Interment ,Sat. Dec. 1st.

We glean the following obituary from the Chicago Inter Ocean, which will be of interest to our many readers, as deceased was well known and highly respected by a large number of our citizens, who tender their sympathy to the bereaved wife, who was a former resident of this city. The remains were brought here for burial beside those of other loved ones:

Wm. Burr SMITH, died at his home, No. 2909 Wabash Ave., Nov. 28, 1894. He was born in Green Co., N. Y., Feb. 3, 1835; son of Nathan, the only one of five brothers â H enry, Elijah, Orson, and Hiram â who did not come to Chicago from Mich., where his f ather had settled, July 20, 1851, and for a time resided with his uncle, Orson at No. 181 Wabash Ave. He was a valued member of the Markley Alling & Co., from 1864 until his death.

He was married July 12, 1861, to Irene A., daughter of Rev. M. N. LORD, who survives him; their three children being dead.

Mr. SMITH was one of the substantial members of the National Guard Cadets organized in McCarthy's Building, on northeast corner Washington and Dearborn Sts., March 19, 1856, of which he was first lieutenant. Its first captain, the late Colonel Joseph R. SCOTT, of the Nineteenth Illinois Volunteers, and he, were roommates for years. He continued with the Cadets of the Sixtieth Regiment, and later, as one of the most efficient members of the United States Zouave Cadets, commanded by the late Colonel ELLSWORTH, that made a tour of the Eastern cities in July and August, 1860. Among the members he was the most popular, always a great favorite, and was usually endearingly addressed by the sobriquet as âPowhattan,â or âPow,â for short. His strict integri ty and social qualities made him popular among his business associates, and to his friends whom he considered less successful in life he was liberal to a fault.

A few years ago Mr. and Mrs. Alfred removed to Chatsw orth, where they resided until recently. About two years ago she was seized with a cancer and has been a severe but patient sufferer ever since. Yet through all her afflictions she never lost her reason, and her mind was unimpaired until the last moment of her life, and while dying spoke of it as placidly as if she were going on a pleasant journey. Death had no terror for her and she passed away in the peaceful and happy hope of a brighter life beyond this world of sorrow and suffering. For 20 years she was a faithful adherent of the New Church (Swedenborgian) and a consistent and devout receiver of its doctrines. Her disposition was quiet and gentle, humble in her tastes and habits, display and worldly vanity were repugnant to her. She was a great lover of books and flowers and her happiest moments (if we accept her love for children) were spent in their company. She leaves in our midst a husband and only daughter to mourn her loss. The f uneral services were held at the house, Rev. Homer McVey of Chatsworth officiating. The remains were interred at Oak Ridge cemetery on the same lot where repose the remains of her son-in-law, the late Judge M. B. Wright.
