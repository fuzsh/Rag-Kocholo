        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nTheseus, duke of Athens, is planning the festivities for his upcoming wedding to the newly captured Amazon, Hippolyta. Egeus arrives with his daughter Hermia and her two suitors, Lysander (the man she wants to marry) and Demetrius (the man her father wants her to marry). Egeus demands that Theseus enforce Athenian law upon Hermia and execute her if she refuses to marry Demetrius. Theseus threatens Hermia with either lifelong chastity or death if she continues to disobey her father. Lysander and Hermia make plans to flee Athens. They reveal their plan to Helena, Hermia’s friend, who is in love with Demetrius. To win Demetrius’s favor, Helena decides to tell him about Lysander and Hermia’s planned elopement.\n\nEnter Theseus, Hippolyta, ⌜and Philostrate,⌝ with others.\n\nTHESEUS\n\n0001 Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour\n\n0002 Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in\n\n0003 Another moon. But, O, methinks how slow\n\n0004 This old moon ⌜wanes!⌝ She lingers my desires\n\n0005 5 Like to a stepdame or a dowager\n\n0006 Long withering out a young man’s revenue.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\n\n0007 Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;\n\n0008 Four nights will quickly dream away the time;\n\n0009 And then the moon, like to a silver bow\n\n0010 10⌜New⌝-bent in heaven, shall behold the night\n\n0011 Of our solemnities.\n\nTHESEUS 0012 Go, Philostrate,\n\n0013 Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments.\n\n0014 Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.\n\n0015 15 Turn melancholy forth to funerals;\n\n0016 The pale companion is not for our pomp.\n\n⌜Philostrate exits.⌝\n\n0017 Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword\n\n0018 And won thy love doing thee injuries,\n\n0019 But I will wed thee in another key,\n\n0020 20 With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.\n\np. 9\n\nEnter Egeus and his daughter Hermia, and Lysander\n\nand Demetrius.\n\nEGEUS\n\n0021 Happy be Theseus, our renownèd duke!\n\nTHESEUS\n\n0022 Thanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?\n\nEGEUS\n\n0023 Full of vexation come I, with complaint\n\n0024 Against my child, my daughter Hermia.—\n\n0025 25 Stand forth, Demetrius.—My noble lord,\n\n0026 This man hath my consent to marry her.—\n\n0027 Stand forth, Lysander.—And, my gracious duke,\n\n0028 This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.—\n\n0029 Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes\n\n0030 30 And interchanged love tokens with my child.\n\n0031 Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung\n\n0032 With feigning voice verses of feigning love\n\n0033 And stol’n the impression of her fantasy\n\n0034 With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,\n\n0035 35 Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats—messengers\n\n0036 Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth.\n\n0037 With cunning hast thou filched my daughter’s heart,\n\n0038 Turned her obedience (which is due to me)\n\n0039 To stubborn harshness.—And, my gracious duke,\n\n0040 40 Be it so she will not here before your Grace\n\n0041 Consent to marry with Demetrius,\n\n0042 I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:\n\n0043 As she is mine, I may dispose of her,\n\n0044 Which shall be either to this gentleman\n\n0045 45 Or to her death, according to our law\n\n0046 Immediately provided in that case.\n\nTHESEUS\n\n0047 What say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid.\n\n0048 To you, your father should be as a god,\n\n0049 One that composed your beauties, yea, and one\n\np. 11\n\n0050 50 To whom you are but as a form in wax\n\n0051 By him imprinted, and within his power\n\n0052 To leave the figure or disfigure it.\n\n0053 Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.\n\nHERMIA\n\n0054 So is Lysander.\n\nTHESEUS 0055 55 In himself he is,\n\n0056 But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,\n\n0057 The other must be held the worthier.\n\nHERMIA\n\n0058 I would my father looked but with my eyes.\n\nTHESEUS\n\n0059 Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.\n\nHERMIA\n\n0060 60 I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.\n\n0061 I know not by what power I am made bold,\n\n0062 Nor how it may concern my modesty\n\n0063 In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;\n\n0064 But I beseech your Grace that I may know\n\n0065 65 The worst that may befall me in this case\n\n0066 If I refuse to wed Demetrius.\n\nTHESEUS\n\n0067 Either to die the death or to abjure\n\n0068 Forever the society of men.\n\n0069 Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,\n\n0070 70 Know of your youth, examine well your blood,\n\n0071 Whether (if you yield not to your father’s choice)\n\n0072 You can endure the livery of a nun,\n\n0073 For aye to be in shady cloister mewed,\n\n0074 To live a barren sister all your life,\n\n0075 75 Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.\n\n0076 Thrice-blessèd they that master so their blood\n\n0077 To undergo such maiden pilgrimage,\n\n0078 But earthlier happy is the rose distilled\n\n0079 Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,\n\n0080 80 Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.\n\np. 13\n\nHERMIA\n\n0081 So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,\n\n0082 Ere I will yield my virgin patent up\n\n0083 Unto his Lordship whose unwishèd yoke\n\n0084 My soul consents not to give sovereignty.\n\nTHESEUS\n\n0085 85 Take time to pause, and by the next new moon\n\n0086 (The sealing day betwixt my love and me\n\n0087 For everlasting bond of fellowship),\n\n0088 Upon that day either prepare to die\n\n0089 For disobedience to your father’s will,\n\n0090 90 Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,\n\n0091 Or on Diana’s altar to protest\n\n0092 For aye austerity and single life.\n\nDEMETRIUS\n\n0093 Relent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield\n\n0094 Thy crazèd title to my certain right.\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0095 95 You have her father’s love, Demetrius.\n\n0096 Let me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him.\n\nEGEUS\n\n0097 Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;\n\n0098 And what is mine my love shall render him.\n\n0099 And she is mine, and all my right of her\n\n0100 100 I do estate unto Demetrius.\n\nLYSANDER, ⌜to Theseus⌝\n\n0101 I am, my lord, as well derived as he,\n\n0102 As well possessed. My love is more than his;\n\n0103 My fortunes every way as fairly ranked\n\n0104 (If not with vantage) as Demetrius’;\n\n0105 105 And (which is more than all these boasts can be)\n\n0106 I am beloved of beauteous Hermia.\n\n0107 Why should not I then prosecute my right?\n\n0108 Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,\n\n0109 Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,\n\n0110 110 And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,\n\np. 15\n\n0111 Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,\n\n0112 Upon this spotted and inconstant man.\n\nTHESEUS\n\n0113 I must confess that I have heard so much,\n\n0114 And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;\n\n0115 115 But, being overfull of self-affairs,\n\n0116 My mind did lose it.—But, Demetrius, come,\n\n0117 And come, Egeus; you shall go with me.\n\n0118 I have some private schooling for you both.—\n\n0119 For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself\n\n0120 120 To fit your fancies to your father’s will,\n\n0121 Or else the law of Athens yields you up\n\n0122 (Which by no means we may extenuate)\n\n0123 To death or to a vow of single life.—\n\n0124 Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?—\n\n0125 125 Demetrius and Egeus, go along.\n\n0126 I must employ you in some business\n\n0127 Against our nuptial and confer with you\n\n0128 Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.\n\nEGEUS\n\n0129 With duty and desire we follow you.\n\n⌜All but Hermia and Lysander⌝ exit.\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0130 130 How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?\n\n0131 How chance the roses there do fade so fast?\n\nHERMIA\n\n0132 Belike for want of rain, which I could well\n\n0133 Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0134 Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,\n\n0135 135 Could ever hear by tale or history,\n\n0136 The course of true love never did run smooth.\n\n0137 But either it was different in blood—\n\nHERMIA\n\n0138 O cross! Too high to be enthralled to ⌜low.⌝\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0139 Or else misgraffèd in respect of years—\n\np. 17\n\nHERMIA\n\n0140 140 O spite! Too old to be engaged to young.\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0141 Or else it stood upon the choice of friends—\n\nHERMIA\n\n0142 O hell, to choose love by another’s eyes!\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0143 Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,\n\n0144 War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,\n\n0145 145 Making it momentany as a sound,\n\n0146 Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,\n\n0147 Brief as the lightning in the collied night,\n\n0148 That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and Earth,\n\n0149 And, ere a man hath power to say “Behold!”\n\n0150 150 The jaws of darkness do devour it up.\n\n0151 So quick bright things come to confusion.\n\nHERMIA\n\n0152 If then true lovers have been ever crossed,\n\n0153 It stands as an edict in destiny.\n\n0154 Then let us teach our trial patience\n\n0155 155 Because it is a customary cross,\n\n0156 As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,\n\n0157 Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0158 A good persuasion. Therefore, hear me, Hermia:\n\n0159 I have a widow aunt, a dowager\n\n0160 160 Of great revenue, and she hath no child.\n\n0161 From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,\n\n0162 And she respects me as her only son.\n\n0163 There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;\n\n0164 And to that place the sharp Athenian law\n\n0165 165 Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me, then\n\n0166 Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night,\n\n0167 And in the wood a league without the town\n\n0168 (Where I did meet thee once with Helena\n\n0169 To do observance to a morn of May),\n\n0170 170 There will I stay for thee.\n\np. 19\n\nHERMIA 0171 My good Lysander,\n\n0172 I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow,\n\n0173 By his best arrow with the golden head,\n\n0174 By the simplicity of Venus’ doves,\n\n0175 175 By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,\n\n0176 And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen\n\n0177 When the false Trojan under sail was seen,\n\n0178 By all the vows that ever men have broke\n\n0179 (In number more than ever women spoke),\n\n0180 180 In that same place thou hast appointed me,\n\n0181 Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0182 Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.\n\nEnter Helena.\n\nHERMIA\n\n0183 Godspeed, fair Helena. Whither away?\n\nHELENA\n\n0184 Call you me “fair”? That “fair” again unsay.\n\n0185 185 Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!\n\n0186 Your eyes are lodestars and your tongue’s sweet air\n\n0187 More tunable than lark to shepherd’s ear\n\n0188 When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.\n\n0189 Sickness is catching. O, were favor so!\n\n0190 190⌜Yours would⌝ I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.\n\n0191 My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye;\n\n0192 My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet\n\n0193 melody.\n\n0194 Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,\n\n0195 195 The rest ⌜I’d⌝ give to be to you translated.\n\n0196 O, teach me how you look and with what art\n\n0197 You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!\n\nHERMIA\n\n0198 I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.\n\nHELENA\n\n0199 O, that your frowns would teach my smiles such\n\n0200 200 skill!\n\np. 21\n\nHERMIA\n\n0201 I give him curses, yet he gives me love.\n\nHELENA\n\n0202 O, that my prayers could such affection move!\n\nHERMIA\n\n0203 The more I hate, the more he follows me.\n\nHELENA\n\n0204 The more I love, the more he hateth me.\n\nHERMIA\n\n0205 205 His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.\n\nHELENA\n\n0206 None but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!\n\nHERMIA\n\n0207 Take comfort: he no more shall see my face.\n\n0208 Lysander and myself will fly this place.\n\n0209 Before the time I did Lysander see\n\n0210 210 Seemed Athens as a paradise to me.\n\n0211 O, then, what graces in my love do dwell\n\n0212 That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0213 Helen, to you our minds we will unfold.\n\n0214 Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold\n\n0215 215 Her silver visage in the wat’ry glass,\n\n0216 Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass\n\n0217 (A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal),\n\n0218 Through Athens’ gates have we devised to steal.\n\nHERMIA\n\n0219 And in the wood where often you and I\n\n0220 220 Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,\n\n0221 Emptying our bosoms of their counsel ⌜sweet,⌝\n\n0222 There my Lysander and myself shall meet\n\n0223 And thence from Athens turn away our eyes\n\n0224 To seek new friends and ⌜stranger companies.⌝\n\n0225 225 Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,\n\n0226 And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.—\n\np. 23\n\n0227 Keep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight\n\n0228 From lovers’ food till morrow deep midnight.\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0229 I will, my Hermia.Hermia exits.\n\n0230 230 Helena, adieu.\n\n0231 As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!\n\nLysander exits.\n\nHELENA\n\n0232 How happy some o’er other some can be!\n\n0233 Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.\n\n0234 But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so.\n\n0235 235 He will not know what all but he do know.\n\n0236 And, as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,\n\n0237 So I, admiring of his qualities.\n\n0238 Things base and vile, holding no quantity,\n\n0239 Love can transpose to form and dignity.\n\n0240 240 Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind;\n\n0241 And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.\n\n0242 Nor hath Love’s mind of any judgment taste.\n\n0243 Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.\n\n0244 And therefore is Love said to be a child\n\n0245 245 Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.\n\n0246 As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,\n\n0247 So the boy Love is perjured everywhere.\n\n0248 For, ere Demetrius looked on Hermia’s eyne,\n\n0249 He hailed down oaths that he was only mine;\n\n0250 250 And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,\n\n0251 So he dissolved, and show’rs of oaths did melt.\n\n0252 I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight.\n\n0253 Then to the wood will he tomorrow night\n\n0254 Pursue her. And, for this intelligence\n\n0255 255 If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.\n\n0256 But herein mean I to enrich my pain,\n\n0257 To have his sight thither and back again.\n\nShe exits."
