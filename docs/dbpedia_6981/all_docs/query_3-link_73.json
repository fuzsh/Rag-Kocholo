        "text": "Absences\n\nStudents who have unexcused absences will not be able to make-up missed assignments and quizzes.\n\nOn the student’s ninth unexcused absence, their grade will be deducted according to the following policies:\n\nOne point will be deducted off the final semester average. An additional point will then be deducted with each additional absence. The eight allowed absences include only unexcused absences.\n\nAbsences are excused for the following reasons: student illness, death in the family, medical or dental appointments, or any other reason excused by the principal BEFORE the absence occurs.\n\nStudents will not be allowed to make up an assignment unless an absence is excused.\n\nA note is required for admission to school after any absence. You can also email: Absent@gracechristianschool.com to submit a note to be excused or request permission before an absence. All notes must contain a reason for the absence.\n\nPre-arranged absences must be pre-approved by the Administration, unless it is school business.\n\nMake-up work- Students will have two days to complete all make-up work. This is not a per class policy. It is the student’s responsibility to collect these assignments, and students need to schedule a time (outside of class) with the teacher to make-up tests, quizzes, etc. Students will not be allowed to make up work during class time.\n\nTeachers are instructed to issue zeros for all unexcused absences as it permits to make-up work.\n\nSchool Business Absences- If a student misses class due to school business (i.e.-athletic event, fine arts event, etc.), he must turn his work into the appropriate teacher on the day of the absence before he/she leaves school.\n\nIt is also the student’s responsibility to get the next day’s assignment from the teacher and have it completed the following day he is back in class.\n\nExceptions can be made for tests and quizzes per administration.\n\nExtended Absences- Students who miss three consecutive days must bring in a doctor’s note for an excused absence. Extended vacations during academic times are strongly discouraged. Any absences from family vacations (including excused/pre-arranged absences) will be subject to our absences policies regarding grade deductions.\n\nExcessive Absences- A student who is absent more than 25 days during the school year will be required to repeat the entire school year at the same grade level.\n\nStudents absent 20-24 days during the school year may be required to attend summer school or perform additional hours of in school attendance in order acquire the necessary hours for grade promotion or for awarding of academic credit on the high school transcript. (The Administration may waive this requirement only if the student has received approval.)\n\nTardy: A student who is tardy to a class more than twice in the quarter, will serve a two hour detention for each tardy they receive in that class. Students will pay $10 to attend the classroom detention, or there is a work detention option If a student fails to appear for a scheduled detention, they will be suspended from school for one day.\n\nAny middle/high student that has an unexcused tardy and is more than 3 minutes late will receive automatic detention for skipping.\n\nExcused Tardy: Parents may only excuse their student for four tardies per quarter to homeroom. Each subsequent tardy will be considered unexcused, even if the parent walks the child into the office. A doctor’s note is needed to be considered an excused tardy after 4 in the quarter."
