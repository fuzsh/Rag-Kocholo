        "text": "Dear God, I thank you for your promise that you give more grace to the humble. I confess that at times I have been prideful and self-reliant, but I now choose to humble myself before you. I ask for your grace to overflow in my life, to empower me to live a life that honors you. Help me to resist the temptation of pride and to continually seek your will and your ways. Thank you for your unfailing love and grace. In Jesus’ name, Amen.\n\nVerse: But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”\n\nJames 4:6\n\nThis is a Promise.\n\nThe verse promises that God gives grace to the humble, but resists the proud."
