        "text": "Below is a full list of our 2023 Official Selections. This list is organized in alphabetical order. First by category, then by the film title. We strongly suggest that you use the find feature on your computer by pressing Command + F (For MAC users) and Control + F (For PC users). After pressing this combination of keys enter the name you are looking for. PLEASE NOTE: AAHSFF may change a submission category if we feel a film is a better fit or has a better chance of being selected in a different category - so your film may not appear in the original category you submitted to.\n\nWhat is an Official Selection? Official Selections are films that will be screened at the 2023 All American High School Film Festival from October 20th to October 22nd, 2023 at the AMC Empire 25 Theaters in Times Square, NYC. Every year we receive thousands of films submitted by student filmmakers from around the world. All of our Official Selections are the best of the best, and have been selected by our panel of industry judges. All Official Selections are eligible to be nominated for an award. All award nominees and winners will be announced at the Teen Indie Awards on Sunday, October 22nd at The Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nWant to know more about festival events? Follow us on social media at @hsfilmfest and check out our 2023 Festival Page featuring: complete festival schedule of events, screening schedule, planning guides, maps, FAQ and more...\n\nIf your film was selected, congratulations! Please be sure to review the information below carefully. If you see any information that is incorrect please let us know as soon as possible by emailing info@aahsff.com. Friday, August 18th is the deadline to inform us of any errors before we lock in our festival programs for publishing.\n\nPlan on coming to the fest to see your film? Get your tickets, find out when your film will be screening, and check out our Festival Planning Guide.\n\nIf your film was not selected, know this: We started this festival ten years ago, and every year it gets more competitive. Every year we receive more submissions that illuminate higher quality storytelling and film technique and we simply cannot screen them all. Of course, this reinforces our belief that the future of film is brighter than ever before and we know you want to be a part of it. But stay focused, not getting in is just another moment in your journey. If you really love filmmaking (and we know you do!) the best thing you can do to improve is to attend the festival and soak in all of the resources we bring together... See what other high school students are creating and where the bar is set, attend panels and workshops designed to specifically help you grow, learn what colleges and universities are looking for, explore the latest technology, and most importantly, form relationships with other young filmmakers that share your dreams and who can help you as you develop your skills. Whatever you decide, don’t give up on your passion.\n\nKeep filming.\n\nKeep following your dreams.\n\nNever Stop Creating.\n\nSee you in New York City!\n\nBest,\n\nTom Oliva & Andrew Jenks\n\nFestival Co-Founders\n\nBroadcast Journalism Feature Story\n\n\"A World of Pink\" by Jacqueline Nicole Franco from Armonk, NY\n\n\"Allen High School Robotics\" by Kaitlyn Morris from Allen, TX\n\n\"Bettering our corner of the world\" by Melanie Coombs, Sarah Conner from Maize, KS\n\n\"Black Student Union Feature\" by Alessia Lavayen from Weston, FL\n\n\"Chillin' With the Cops\" by Drew Bank from Plantation, FL\n\n\"Climb Higher: Lyza Bull's Story\" by McKay Grange from Lehi, UT\n\n\"Dia De Los Muertos\" by Adrian Perez from Miami, FL\n\n\"Diwali 2022\" by Diya Patel from Madison, AL\n\n\"Girls Who Code\" by Santiago Salazar from Pembroke Pines, FL\n\n\"Hangar Kafe\" by Emerson Smith from Springfield, MO\n\n\"Infectious Smiles Here and There\" by Melina Silvestro from Mamaroneck, NY\n\n\"KC Pet Project\" by Ava Williams from Stilwell, KS\n\n\"LemonAid\" by Riley Gibson from Park Ridge, IL\n\n\"Making A Difference One Memory at a Time\" by Drew Bank from Plantation, FL\n\n\"Marando Farms\" by Clara De Luca, Samantha Duarte from Weston, FL\n\n“Middle School Crosswalk\" by Emma Baxter from Cody, WY\n\n\"PatriotsTV Christmas Special\" by Drew Bank, Ty Holifield, Andrew Rollins and Patriots TV Crew from Plantation, FL\n\n\"Peace on Earth: The Coffee Shop for the Community\" by McKay Grange from Lehi, UT\n\n\"Pickin’ Patch\" by Emerson Smith from Springfield, MO\n\n\"Pickwick Theater Closing Spurs New Beginning\" by Tyler DeMott, Dylan Sarsany from Park Ridge, IL\n\n\"Rebuilding Southwest Florida\" by Drew Bank & Silvia Santana from Plantation, FL\n\n\"Sarah Bolja: The Artistic Dream\" by Alexa Cepero, Kirra Reid from Ft.
