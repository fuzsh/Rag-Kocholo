Introduction\n\n1.1 What is Grace?\n\nGrace is a WYSIWYG tool to make two-dimensional plots of numerical data. It runs under various (if not all) flavors of Unix with X11 and M*tif (LessTif or Motif). It also runs under VMS, OS/2, and Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP). Its capabilities are roughly similar to GUI-based programs like Sigmaplot or Microcal Origin plus script-based tools like Gnuplot or Genplot. Its strength lies in the fact that it combines the convenience of a graphical user interface with the power of a scripting language which enables it to do sophisticated calculations or perform automated tasks.\n\nGrace is derived from Xmgr (a.k.a. ACE/gr), originally written by Paul Turner.\n\nFrom version number 4.00, the development was taken over by a team of volunteers under the coordination of Evgeny Stambulchik. You can get the newest information about Grace and download the latest version at the Grace home page.\n\nWhen its copyright was changed to GPL, the name was changed to Grace, which stands for ``GRaphing, Advanced Computation and Exploration of data'' or ``Grace Revamps ACE/gr''. The first version of Grace available is named 5.0.0, while the last public version of Xmgr has the version number 4.1.2.\n\nPaul still maintains and develops a non-public version of Xmgr for internal use.\n\n1.2 Copyright statement\n\nCopyright (©) 1991-1995 Paul J Turner, Portland, OR Copyright (©) 1996-2007 Grace Development Team Maintained by Evgeny Stambulchik All Rights Reserved This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

Installation guide\n\n2.1 Installing from sources\n\nConfiguration\n\nRequirements. Grace usually compiles out of the box in a regular Unix-like environment. You need an ANSI C compiler (gcc is just fine), the X11R5 or above libraries and headers, and an implementaion of the M*tif API, version 1.2 or above. If you want to compile your own changes to certain parts of Grace, you will need a parser generator (yacc or, better, bison).\n\nExtra libraries. Some features will be available only if additional libraries are installed. Those are:\n\nThe JPEG backend needs the IJG's ( JPEG library), version 6.x.\n\nThe PNG backend needs the ( libpng) library (version 0.96 or above).\n\nThe PDF driver requires the PDFlib library of Thomas Merz to be installed, which is available here, version 4.0.3 or above.\n\nIf your computer has the FFTW library installed when Grace is compiled, Grace will link itself to this, and drop all conventional FFT's and DFT's. All transforms will be routed through this package. Note that there is then no difference between pushing the \"FFT\" button and the \"DFT\" button, except that FFT will complain if the length isn't a power of 2, and DFT will not. For more information on this package, see the FFTW Home page. In short, this package allows one to do non-power-of-2 length FFT's along with the normal ones. It seems to work very efficiently for any set length which factors into 2^a 3^b 5^c 7^d for integer a, b, c, d. The great feature here is that set lengths which are powers of 10 (e.g. 1000, 10000) and integer multiples of these (500, 2000, 2500, 5000, etc.) can be computed with no significant penalty (maybe 20%) over power-of-2 transforms. Very often, real datasets come in these sizes, and not in powers of 2.\n\nIn order to read/write sets in the NetCDF data format, you will also need the NetCDF libraries.\n\nDecide whether you want to compile in a separate place (thus leaving the source tree pristine). You most probably would want it if compiling Grace for more than one OS and keeping the sources in a central shared (e.g. via NFS) location. If you don't need it, skip the rest of this paragraph and go right to the next step. Otherwise, assuming the sources are in /usr/local/src/grace-x.y.z and the compilation will be performed in /tmp/grace-obj, do the following:\n\n% mkdir /tmp/grace-obj % cd /tmp/grace-obj % /usr/local/src/grace-x.y.z/ac-tools/shtool mkshadow \\ /usr/local/src/grace-x.y.z .\n\nThe configure shell script attempts to guess correct values for various system-dependent variables used during compilation. It uses those values to create Make.conf in the top directory of the package. It also create config.h file containing system-dependent definitions. Finally, it creates a shell script config.status that you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file config.cache that saves the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring, and a file config.log containing compiler output (useful mainly for debugging configure). If at some point config.cache contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.\n\nRun ./configure --help to get list of additional switches specific to Grace\n\nRun ./configure <options>. Just an example:\n\n% ./configure --enable-grace-home=/opt/grace --with-extra-incpath=/usr/local/include:/opt/include \\ --with-extra-ldpath=/usr/local/lib:/opt/lib --prefix=/usr\n\nwould use /usr/local/include and /opt/include in addition to the default include path and /usr/local/lib and /opt/lib in addition to the default ld path. As well, all stuff would be put under the /opt/grace directory and soft links made to /usr/bin, /usr/lib and /usr/include.\n\nNote: If you change one of the --with-extra-incpath or --with-extra-ldpath options from one run of configure to another, remember to delete the config.cache file!!!\n\nCompilation\n\nIssue make\n\nIf something goes wrong, try to see if the problem has been described already in the Grace FAQ (in the doc directory).\n\nTesting\n\nmake tests\n\nThis will give you a slide show demonstrating some nice features of Grace.\n\nInstallation\n\nmake install\n\nmake links\n\nThe later (optional) step will make soft links from some files under the Grace home directory to the system-wide default locations (can be changed by the --prefix option during the configuration, see above).\n\n2.2 Binary installation\n\nGetting pre-built packages\n\nInstallation\n\nRunning tests\n\n2.3 Alternative packaging schemes (RPM, ...)\n\nNot written yet...\n\n3. Getting started\n\nFor a jump-in start, you can browse the demos (\"Help/Examples\" menu tree). These are ordinary Grace projects, so you can play with them and modify them. Also, read the Tutorial.\n\nO.k. Here's a VERY quick introduction:\n\nStart the GUI version: xmgrace (return).\n\nSelect/check the output medium and canvas size in File/Device Setup.\n\nIf needed, set the graph size ('Viewport' in Plot/Graph Appearance).\n\nLoad your data with Data/Import/ASCII. 'Load as': 'Single set' for two-column ASCII data, 'Block data' for multi-column ASCII data.\n\nAdjust the scales, axis labels and tick marks in Plot/Axis properties. Acknowledge all changes with 'Apply'.\n\nAdjust lines, symbols, legends in Plot/Set appearance.\n\nAdjust titles, plot frame and legend display in Plot/Graph Appearance.\n\nData can be manipulated in Data/Transformations. To shift a data set by 20 to the left, e.g., in 'Evaluate Expression' select the same set on the left and the right, and say Formula: y=y-20. As you'll probably notice, Grace can do MUCH more than that. Explore at your leisure.\n\nWhen you like your plot, select File/Print. That's it!\n\n3.1 General concepts\n\nProject files\n\nA project file contains all information necessary to restore a plot created by Grace, as well as some of preferences. Each plot is represented on a single page, but may have an unlimited number of graphs.You create a project file of your current graph with File/Save,Save as.\n\nParameter files\n\nA parameter file contains the detailed settings of your project. It can be used to transfer these settings to a different plot/project. You generate a parameter file with File/Save menu entry selected from the \"Plot/Graph appearance popup\". You can load the settings contained in a parameter file with File/Open.\n\nInput file formats\n\nGrace understands several input files formats. The most basic one is ASCII text files containing space and comma separated columns of data. The data fields can be either numeric (Fortran 'd' and 'D' exponent markers are also supported) or alphanumeric (with or without quotes). Several calendar date formats are recognized automatically and you can specify your own reference for numeric date formats. Lines beginnig with \"#\" are ignored. Blank lines indicate new dataset. Grace also has a command language (see command interpreter), you can include commands in data files using lines having \"@\" as their first non-blank character, though this is not recommended. Depending on configuration, Grace can also read NetCDF files (see configuration).\n\nGraphs\n\nA graph consists of (every element is optional): a graph frame, axes, a title and a subtitle, a number of sets and additional annotative objects (time stamp string, text strings, lines, boxes and ellipses).\n\nThe graph type can be any of:\n\nXY Graph\n\nXY Chart\n\nPolar Graph\n\nFixed Graph\n\nPie chart\n\nThe idea of \"XY Chart\" is to plot bars (or symbols in general) of several sets side by side, assuming the abscissas of all the sets are the same (or subsets of the longest set).\n\nDatasets\n\nA dataset is a collection of points with x and y coordinates, up to four optional data values (which, depending on the set type, can be displayed as error bars or like) and one optional character string.\n\nSets\n\nA set is a way of representing datasets. It consists of a pointer to a dataset plus a collection of parameters describing the visual appearance of the data (like color, line dash pattern etc).\n\nThe set type can be any of the following:\n\nSet type # of num. cols Description XY 2 An X-Y scatter and/or line plot, plus (optionally) an annotated value XYDX 3 Same as XY, but with error bars (either one- or two-sided) along X axis XYDY 3 Same as XYDX, but error bars are along Y axis XYDXDX 4 Same as XYDX, but left and right error bars are defined separately XYDYDY 4 Same as XYDXDX, but error bars are along Y axis XYDXDY 4 Same as XY, but with X and Y error bars (either one- or two-sided) XYDXDXDYDY 6 Same as XYDXDY, but left/right and upper/lower error bars are defined separately BAR 2 Same as XY, but vertical bars are used instead of symbols BARDY 3 Same as BAR, but with error bars (either one- or two-sided) along Y axis BARDYDY 4 Same as BARDY, but lower and upper error bars are defined separately XYHILO 5 Hi/Low/Open/Close plot XYZ 3 Same as XY; makes no sense unless the annotated value is Z XYR 3 X, Y, Radius. Only allowed in Fixed graphs XYSIZE 3 Same as XY, but symbol size is variable XYCOLOR 3 X, Y, color index (of the symbol fill) XYCOLPAT 4 X, Y, color index, pattern index (currently used for Pie charts only) XYVMAP 4 Vector map XYBOXPLOT 6 Box plot (X, median, upper/lower limit, upper/lower whisker)\n\nSet types\n\nNot all set types, however, can be plotted on any graph type. The following table summarizes it:\n\nSet type XY Graph XY Chart Fixed Polar Pie XY + + + + + XYDX + - + - - XYDY + + + - - XYDXDX + - + - - XYDYDY + + + - - XYDXDY + - + - - XYDXDXDYDY + - + - - BAR + + + - - BARDY + + - - - BARDYDY + + - - - XYHILO + - - - - XYZ + - + + - XYR - - + - - XYSIZE + + + + - XYCOLOR + + + + + XYCOLPAT - - - - + XYVMAP + - + - - XYBOXPLOT + - - - -\n\nGraph/Set type connection\n\nRegions\n\nRegions are sections of the graph defined by the interior or exterior of a polygon, or a half plane defined by a line. Regions are used to restrict data transformations to a geometric area occupied by region.\n\nReal Time Input\n\nReal Time Input refers to the ability Grace has to be fed in real time by an external program. The Grace process spawned by the driver program is a full featured Grace process: the user can interact using the GUI at the same time the program sends data and commands. The process will adapt itself to the incoming data rate.\n\nHotlinks\n\nHotlinks are sources containing varying data. Grace can be instructed a file or a pipe is a hotlink in which case it will provide specific commands to refresh the data on a mouse click (a later version will probably allow automatic refresh).\n\nDevices\n\nGrace allows the user to choose between several output devices to produce its graphics. The current list of supported devices is:\n\nX11\n\nPostScript (level 1 and level 2)\n\nEPS (encapsulated PostScript)\n\nMetafile (which is Grace format, used at the moment mostly for debugging purposes)\n\nMIF (Maker Interchange Format used by FrameMaker)\n\nSVG (Scalable Vector Graphics, a language for describing two-dimensional vector and mixed vector/raster graphics in XML)\n\nPDF (depends on extra libraries, see configuration)\n\nPNM (portable anymap file format)\n\nJPEG (depends on extra libraries, see configuration)\n\nPNG (depends on extra libraries, see configuration)\n\nNote that Grace no longer supports GIF due to the copyright policy of Unisys. Grace can also be instructed to launch conversion programs automatically based on file name. As an example you can produce MIF (FrameMaker Interchange Format) or Java applets using pstoedit, or almost any image format using the netpbm suite (see the FAQ).\n\nMagic path\n\nIn many cases, when Grace needs to access a file given with a relative pathname, it searches for the file along the following path: ./pathname:./.grace/pathname:~/.grace/pathname:$GRACE_HOME/pathname\n\nDynamic modules\n\nGrace can access external functions present in either system or third-party shared libraries or modules specially compiled for use with it. The term dynamic refers to the possibility Grace has to open the library at run time to find the code of the external function, there is no need to recompile Grace itself (the functions already compiled in Grace are \"statically linked\").\n\nCoordinate frames\n\nThere are two types of coordinates in Grace: the world coordinates and the viewport coordinates. Points of data sets are defined in the world coordinates. The viewport coordinates correspond to the image of the plot drawn on the canvas (or printed on, say, PS output page). The transformation converting the world coordinates into the viewport ones is determined by both the graph type and the axis scaling.\n\nActually, there is yet another level in the hierarchy of coordinates - the device coordinates. However, you (as a user of Grace) should not worry about the latter. The mapping between the viewport coordinates and the device coordinates is always set in such a way that the origin of the viewport corresponds to the left bottom corner of the device page, the smallest of the device dimensions corresponds to one unit in the viewport coordinates. Oh, and the most important thing about the viewport -> device transformation is that it is homotetic, i.e. a square is guaranteed to remain a square, not a rectangle, a circle remains a circle (not an ellipse) etc.\n\n3.2 Invocation\n\nOperational mode\n\nWith respect to the user interface, there are three modes of operation that Grace can be invoked in. The full-featured GUI-based version is called xmgrace. A batch-printing version is called gracebat. A command-line interface mode is called grace. Usually, a single executable is called in all cases, with two of the three files being (symbolic) links to a \"real\" one.\n\nCommand line options\n\n-autoscale x|y|xy\n\nOverride any parameter file settings\n\n-barebones\n\nTurn off all toolbars\n\n-batch batch_file\n\nExecute batch_file on start up (i.e., after all other options have been processed and the UI initialized)\n\n-block block_data\n\nAssume data file is block data\n\n-bxy x:y:etc.\n\nForm a set from the current block data set using the current set type from columns given in the argument\n\n-datehint iso|european|us|days|seconds|nohint\n\nSet the hint for dates analysis\n\n-dpipe descriptor\n\nRead data from descriptor (anonymous pipe) on startup\n\n-fixed width height\n\nSet canvas size fixed to width*height\n\n-free\n\nUse free page layout\n\n-graph graph_number\n\nSet the current graph number\n\n-graphtype graph_type\n\nSet the type of the current graph\n\n-hardcopy\n\nNo interactive session, just print and quit\n\n-hdevice hardcopy_device_name\n\nSet default hardcopy device\n\n-install\n\nInstall private colormap\n\n-legend load\n\nTurn the graph legend on\n\n-log x|y|xy\n\nSet the axis scaling of the current graph to logarithmic\n\n-maxpath length\n\nSet the maximal drawing path length\n\n-mono\n\nRun Grace in monochrome mode (affects the display only)\n\n-netcdf file\n\nAssume data file is in netCDF format. This option is present only if the netCDF support was compiled in\n\n-netcdfxy X_var Y_var\n\nIf -netcdf was used previously, read from the netCDF file X_var Y_var variables and create a set. If X_var name is \"null\" then load the index of Y to X. This option is present only if the netCDF support was compiled in\n\n-noask\n\nAssume the answer is yes to all requests - if the operation would overwrite a file, Grace will do so without prompting\n\n-noinstall\n\nDon't use private colormap\n\n-noprint\n\nIn batch mode, do not print\n\n-nosafe\n\nDisable safe mode\n\n-nosigcatch\n\nDon't catch signals\n\n-npipe file\n\nRead data from named pipe on startup\n\n-nxy nxy_file\n\nAssume data file is in X Y1 Y2 Y3 ... format\n\n-param parameter_file\n\nLoad parameters from parameter_file to the current graph\n\n-pexec parameter_string\n\nInterpret string as a parameter setting\n\n-pipe\n\nRead data from stdin on startup\n\n-printfile\n\nfile Save print output to file\n\n-remove\n\nRemove data file after read\n\n-results results_file\n\nWrite results of some data manipulations to results_file\n\n-rvideo\n\nExchange the color indices for black and white\n\n-safe\n\nRun in the safe mode (default) - no file system modifications are allowd through the batch language\n\n-saveall save_file\n\nSave all graphs to save_file\n\n-seed seed_value\n\nInteger seed for random number generator\n\n-settype xy|xydx|...\n\nSet the type of the next data file\n\n-source disk|pipe\n\nSource type of next data file\n\n-timer delay\n\nSet allowed time slice for real time inputs to delay ms\n\n-timestamp\n\nAdd timestamp to plot\n\n-version\n\nShow the program version\n\n-viewport xmin ymin xmax ymax\n\nSet the viewport for the current graph\n\n-wd directory\n\nSet the working directory\n\n-world xmin ymin xmax ymax\n\nSet the world coordinates for the current graph\n\n-usage|-help\n\nThis message\n\n3.3 Customization\n\nEnvironment variables\n\nGRACE_HOME\n\nSet the location of Grace. This will be where help files, auxiliary programs, and examples are located. If you are unable to find the location of this directory, contact your system administrator.\n\nGRACE_PRINT_CMD\n\nPrint command. If the variable is defined but is an empty string, \"Print to file\" will be selected as default.\n\nGRACE_EDITOR\n\nThe editor used for manual editing of dataset values.\n\nGRACE_HELPVIEWER\n\nThe shell command to run an HTML viewer for on-line browsing of the help documents. Must include at least one instance of \"%s\" which will be replaced with the actual URL by Grace.\n\nGRACE_FFTW_WISDOM_FILE and GRACE_FFTW_RAM_WISDOM\n\nThese flags control behavior of the FFTW planner (see FFTW tuning for detailed info)\n\nInit file\n\nUpon start-up, Grace loads its init file, gracerc. The file is searched for in the magic path (see magic path); once found, the rest of the path is ignored. It's recommended that in the gracerc file, one doesn't use statements which are part of a project file - such defaults, if needed, should be set in the default template (see default template).\n\nDefault template\n\nWhenever a new project is started, Grace loads the default template, templates/Default.agr. The file is searched for in the magic path (see magic path); once found, the rest of the path is ignored. It's recommended that in the default template, one doesn't use statements which are NOT part of a project file - such defaults, if needed, should be set in the gracerc (see init file).\n\nX resources\n\nThe following Grace-specific X resource settings are supported:\n\nXMgrace.invertDraw\n\nUse GXinvert rather than GXxor for rubber-band lines. If the rubber-banding for zooms and lines, etc. doesn't appear on the canvas, set this resource to yes.\n\nXMgrace.allowDoubleClick\n\nWhen Yes, allow double clicks on the canvas to bring up various popups depending on the location of the pointer when the double click occurs.\n\nXMgrace.toolBar\n\nEnables button toolbar\n\nXMgrace.statusBar\n\nEnables status bar\n\nXMgrace.locatorBar\n\nEnables locator bar\n\nIt is also possible to customize menus by assigning key accelerators to any item.\n\nYou'll need to derive the item's X resource name from the respective menu label, which is easily done following these rules:\n\nAll non-alphanumeric characters are skipped\n\nStart with lower case; each new word (if any) continues from the capital letter\n\nAdd the item's type to the end - \"Menu\" for pulldown menus, \"Button\" for menu buttons.\n\nFor example, in order to make Grace popup the Non-linear curve fitting by pressing Control+F, you would add the following two lines\n\nXMgrace*transformationsMenu.nonLinearCurveFittingButton.acceleratorText: Ctrl+F\n\nXMgrace*transformationsMenu.nonLinearCurveFittingButton.accelerator: Ctrl<Key>f\n\nto your .Xresources file (the file which is read when an X session starts; it could be .Xdefaults, .Xsession or some other file - ask your system administrator when in doubt).\n\nSimilarly, it may be desirable to alter default filename patterns of file selection dialogs. The recipe for the dialog's name is like for menu buttons outlined above, with \"Button\" being replaced with \"FSB\". E.g., to list all files in the \"Open project\" dialog (\"File/Open...\"), set the following resource:\n\nXMgrace*openProjectFSB.pattern: *\n\n4. Guide to the graphical user interface\n\n4.1 GUI controls\n\nThis section describes interface controls - basic building blocks, used in many popups.\n\nFile selection dialogs\n\nWhenever the user is expected to provide a filename, either for reading in or writing some data, a file selection dialog is popped up. In addition to the standard entries (the directory and file lists and the filter entry), there is a pulldown menu for quick directory change to predefined locations (the current working directory, user's home directory and the file system root). Also, a \"Set as cwd\" button is there which allows to set any directory as you navigate through the directory tree as the current working directory (cwd). Once defined, it can be used in any other file selection dialog to switch to that directory quickly.\n\nList selectors\n\nVarious selectors are available in several popups. They all display lists of objects (graphs, sets, ...) and can be used to perform simple operations on these objects (copying, deleting, ...). The operations are available from a popup menu that appears when pressing mouse button 3 on them. Depending on the required functionality, they may allow multiple choices or not. The following shortcuts are enabled (if the result of an action would contradict the list's selection policy, this would be ignored):\n\nCtrl+a select all\n\nCtrl+u unselect all\n\nCtrl+i invert selection\n\nGraph selector\n\nThe operations that can be performed on graphs through the graph selector's popup menu are:\n\nfocus to\n\nhide\n\nshow\n\nduplicate\n\nkill\n\nswap\n\ncreate new\n\nAll this operations are not available in every instance of the selector. For example in the \"read sets\" popup only one graph can be selected at a time, and the swap operation is disabled.\n\nDouble-clicking on a list entry will switch the focus to that graph.\n\nSet selector\n\nThe operations that can be performed on sets through the set selector's popup menu are:\n\nhide\n\nshow\n\nbring to front\n\nsend to back\n\nduplicate\n\nkill\n\nkill data\n\nswap\n\nedit\n\nin spreadsheet (see Spreadsheet data set editor)\n\nin text editor\n\ncreate new\n\nby formula\n\nin spreadsheet (see Spreadsheet data set editor)\n\nin text editor\n\nfrom block data\n\npack all sets\n\nselector operations\n\nview set comments\n\nshow data-less\n\nshow hidden\n\nselect all\n\nunselect all\n\ninvert selection\n\nupdate\n\nDouble-clicking on a list entry will open the spreadsheet editor (see Spreadsheet data set editor) on the set data.\n\n4.2 The main window\n\nThe canvas\n\nCanvas hotkeys\n\nWhen the pointer focus is on the canvas (where the graph is drawn), there are some shortcuts to activate several actions. They are:\n\nCtrl <Key>A: Autoscale the current graph\n\nCtrl <Key>D: Delete an object\n\nCtrl <Key>L: Move current graph legend\n\nCtrl <Key>M: Move an object\n\nCtrl <Key>T: Place timestamp\n\nCtrl <Key>U: Refresh hotlinks\n\nCtrl <Key>V: Set the viewport with mouse\n\nCtrl <Key>Z: Zoom\n\nCtrl Alt <Key>L: Draw a line\n\nCtrl Alt <Key>B: Draw a box\n\nCtrl Alt <Key>E: Draw an ellipse\n\nCtrl Alt <Key>T: Write a text string\n\nClicks and double clicks\n\nA single click inside a graph switches focus to that graph. This is the default policy, but it can be changed from the \"Edit/Preferences\" popup.\n\nDouble clicking on parts of the canvas will invoke certain actions or raise some popups:\n\non a focus marker: move selected viewport corner\n\non an axis: \"Plot/Axis properties\" popup\n\non a set: \"Plot/Set appearance\" popup\n\non a legend: \"Plot/Graph appearance\" popup\n\non a (sub)title: \"Plot/Graph appearance\" popup\n\non an object (box, line, ...): a popup for editing properties of that object\n\nThe double clicking actions can be enabled/disabled from the \"Edit/Preferences\" popup.\n\nToolbar buttons\n\nAlong the left-hand side of the canvas (if shown) is the ToolBar. It is armed with several buttons to provide quick and easy access to the more commonly used Grace functions.\n\nDraw: This will redraw the canvas and sets. Useful if \"Auto Redraw\" has been deselected in the Edit|Preferences dialog or after executing commands directly from the Window|Commands interpreter.\n\nLens: A zoom lens. Click on the lens, then select the area of interest on the graph with the \"rubber band\". The region enclosed by the rubber band will fill the entire graph.\n\nAS: AutoScale. Autoscales the graph to contain all data points of all visible (not hidden) sets.\n\nZ/z: Zoom in/out by 5%. The zoom percentage can be set in the Edit/Preferences dialog.\n\nArrows: Scroll active graph by 5% in the arrow's direction. The scroll percentage can be set in the Edit/Preferences dialog.\n\nAutoT: AutoTick Axes. This will find the optimum number of major and minor tick marks for both axes.\n\nAutoO: Autoscale On set. Click the AutoO button, then click on the graph near the set you wish to use for determining the autoscale boundaries of the graph.\n\nZX,ZY: Zoom along an axis. These buttons work like the zoom lens above but are restricted to a single axis.\n\nAX,AY: Autoscale one axis only.\n\nThe following buttons deal with the graph stack and there is a good example under Help/Examples/General Intro/World Stack.\n\nPu/Po: Push and pop the current world settings to/from the graph stack. When popping, makes the new stack top current.\n\nPZ: Push before Zooming. Functions as the zoom lens, but first pushes the current world settings to the stack.\n\nCy: Cycles through the stack settings of the active graph. Each graph may have up to twenty layers on the stack.\n\nExit: Pretty obvious, eh?\n\n4.3 File menu\n\nThe file menu contains all entries related to the input/output features of Grace.\n\nNew\n\nReset the state of Grace as if it had just started (one empty graph ranging from 0 to 1 along both axes). If some work has been done and not yet saved, a warning popup is displayed to allow canceling the operation.\n\nOpen\n\nOpen an existing project file. A popup is displayed that allow to browse the file system.\n\nSave\n\nSave the current work in a project file, using the name that was used for the last open or save. If no name has been set (i.e., if the project has been created from scratch) act as save as.\n\nSave as\n\nSave the current work in a project file with a new name. A popup allows to browse the file system and set the name, the format to use for saving data points (the default value is \"%16.8g\"), and a textual description of the project. A warning is displayed if a file with the same name already exists.\n\nRevert to saved\n\nAbandon all modifications performed on the project since the last save. A confirmation popup is fired to allow the user canceling the operation.\n\nPrint setup\n\nSet the properties of the printing device. Each device has its own set of specific options (see Device-specific settings). According to the device, the output can be sent either directly to a printer or directed to a file. The global settings available for all devices are the sizing parameters. The size of the graph is fixed. Changing the 'Page' settings changes the size of the canvas underneath the graph. Switching between portrait and landscape rotates the canvas. Make sure the canvas size is large enough to hold your graph. Otherwise you get a 'Printout truncated' warning. If your canvas size cannot easily be changed because, for example, you want to print on letter size paper, you need to adjust the size of your graph ('Viewport' in Plot/Graph Appearance).\n\nPrint\n\nPrint the project using the current printer settings\n\nExit\n\nExit from Grace. If some work has been done and not saved, a warning popup will be displayed to allow the user to cancel the operation.\n\n4.4 Edit menu\n\nData sets\n\nUsing the data set popup, you can view the properties of datasets. This include its type, length, associated comment and some statistics (min, max, mean, standard deviation). A horizontal scrollbar at the bottom allows to get the two last properties, they are not displayed by default. Also note that if you find some columns are too narrow to show all significant digits, you can drag the vertical rules using Shift+Button 2.\n\nUsing the menu on the top of this dialog, you can manipulate existing sets or add new ones. Among the most important entries in the menu, are options to create or modify a set using the spreadsheet data set editor (see Spreadsheet data set editor).\n\nSpreadsheet data set editor\n\nThe dialog presents an editable matrix of numbers, corresponding to the data set being edited. The set type (and hence, the number of data columns) can be changed using the \"Type:\" selector. Clicking on a column label pops up a dialog allowing to adjust the column formatting. Clicking on the row labels toggles the respective row state (selected/unselected). The selected rows can be deleted via the dialog's \"Edit\" menu. Another entry in this menu lets you add a row; the place of the new row is determined by the row containing a cell with the keyboard focus on. As well, just typing in an empty cell will add one or several rows (filling the intermediate rows with zeros).\n\nTo resize columns, drag the vertical rules using Shift+Button 2.\n\nSet operations\n\nThe set operations popup allows you to interact with sets as a whole. If you want to operate on the data ordering of the sets, you should use the data set operations popup from the Data menu. The popup allows you to select a source (one set within one graph) and a destination and perform some action upon them (copy, move, swap). This popup also give you a quick access to several graph and set selectors if you want to perform some other operation like hiding a graph or creating a new set from block data.\n\nArrange graphs\n\nThis entry fires up a popup to lay out several graphs in a regular grid given by M rows and N columns.\n\nThe graph selector at the top allows one to select a number of graphs the arrangement will operate on. If the number of selected graphs isn't equal to M times N, new graphs may be created or extra graphs killed if needed. These options are controlled by the respective checkboxes below the graph selector.\n\nThe order in which the matrix is filled in with the graphs can be selected (first horizontally then vertically or vise versa, with either of them inverted). Additionaly, one may choose to fill the matrix in the snake-like manner (adjacent \"strokes\" are anti-parallel).\n\nThe rest of the controls of the dialog window deal with the matrix spacing: left/right/top/bottom page offsets (in the viewport coordinates) and relative inter-cell distances, vertical and horizontal. Next to each of the vertical/horizontal spacing spinboxes, a \"Pack\" checkbox is found. Enabling it effectively sets the respective inter-cell distance to zero and alter axis tickmark settings such that only bottom/left-most tickmarks are visible.\n\nIf you don't want the regular layout this arrangement gives you, you can change it afterwards using the mouse (select a graph and double click on the focus marker, see clicks and double clicks).\n\nOverlay graphs\n\nYou can overlay a graph on top of another one. The main use of this feature is to plot several curves using different scales on the same (apparently) graph. The main difficulty is to be sure you operate on the graph you want at all times (you can hide one for a moment if this becomes too difficult).\n\nAutoscale\n\nUsing this entry, you can autoscale one graph or all graphs according to the specified sets only. This is useful if you need either to have truly comparable graphs despite every one contains data of different ranges, or if you want to focus your attention on one set only while it is displayed with other data in a complex graph.\n\nRegions menu\n\nStatus\n\nThis small popup only displays the current state (type and whether it is active or not) of the existing regions.\n\nDefine\n\nYou can define a new region (or redefine an existing one), the allowed region types are:\n\nInside polygon\n\nOutside polygon\n\nAbove line\n\nBelow line\n\nLeft of line\n\nRight of line\n\nIn horizontal range\n\nIn vertical range\n\nOut of horizontal range\n\nOut of vertical range\n\nA region can be either linked to the current graph only or to all graphs.\n\nClear\n\nThis kills a region.\n\nReport on\n\nThis popup reports you which sets or points are inside or outside of a region.\n\nHot links\n\nYou can link a set to a file or a pipe using this feature. Once a link has been established, you can update it (i.e., read data again) by clicking on the update button.\n\nCurrently, only simple XY sets can be used for hotlinks.\n\nSet locator fixed point\n\nAfter having selected this menu entry, you can select a point on a graph that will be used as the origin of the locator display (just below the menu bar). The fixed point is taken into account only when the display type of the locator is set to [DX,DY].\n\nClear locator fixed point\n\nThis entry is provided to remove a fixed point set before and use the default again: point [0, 0].\n\nLocator props\n\nThe locator props popup allows you to customize the display of the locator, mainly its type and the format and precision of the display. You can use all the formats that are allowed in the graphs scales.\n\nPreferences\n\nThe preferences popup allows you to set miscellaneous properties of your Grace session, such as GUI behavior, cursor type, date reading hint and reference date used for calendar conversions.\n\n4.5 Data menu\n\nData set operations\n\nThis popup gathers all operations that are related to the ordering of data points inside a set or between sets. If you want to operate on the sets as a whole, you should use the set operations popup from the Edit menu. You can sort according to any coordinate (X, Y, DX, ...) in ascending or descending order, reverse the order of the points, join several sets into one, split one set into several others of equal lengths, or drop a range of points from a set. The set selector of the popup shows the number of points in each set in square brackets like this: G0.S0[63], the points are numbered from 0 to n-1.\n\nTransformations menu\n\nThe transformations sub-menu gives you access to all data-mining features of Grace.\n\nEvaluate expression\n\nUsing evaluate expression allows you to create a set by applying an explicit formula to another set, or to parts of another set if you use regions restrictions.\n\nAll the classical mathematical functions are available (cos, sin, but also lgamma, j1, erf, ...). As usual all trigonometric functions use radians by default but you can specify a unit if you prefer to say cos (x rad) or sin (3 * y deg). For the full list of available numerical functions and operators, see Operators and functions.\n\nIn the formula, you can use X, Y, Y1, ..., Y4 to denote any coordinate you like from the source set. An implicit loop will be used around your formula so if you say:\n\nx = x - 4966.5\n\nyou will shift all points of your set 4966.5 units to the left.\n\nYou can use more than one set in the same formula, like this:\n\ny = y - 0.653 * sin (x deg) + s2.y\n\nwhich means you use both X and Y from the source set but also the Y coordinate of set 2. Beware that the loop is a simple loop over the indices, all the sets you use in such an hybrid expression should therefore have the same number of points and point i of one set should really be related to point i of the other set. If your sets do not follow these requirements, you should first homogenize them using interpolation.\n\nHistograms\n\nThe histograms popup allows you to compute either standard or cumulative histograms from the Y coordinates of your data. Optionally, the histograms can be normalized to 1 (hence producing a PDF (Probability Distribution Function).\n\nThe bins can be either a linear mesh defined by its min, max, and length values, or a mesh formed by abscissas of another set (in which case abscissas of the set must form a strictly monotonic array).\n\nFourier transforms\n\nThis popup is devoted to direct and inverse Fourier transforms (actually, what is computed is a power spectrum). The default is to perform a direct transform on unfiltered data and to produce a set with the index as abscissa and magnitude as ordinate. You can filter the input data window through triangular, Hanning, Welch, Hamming, Blackman and Parzen filters. You can load magnitude, phase or coefficients and use either index, frequency or period as abscissas. You can choose between direct and inverse Fourier transforms. If you specify real input data, X is assumed to be equally spaced and ignored; if you specify complex input data X is taken as the real part and Y as the imaginary part.\n\nIf Grace was configured with the FFTW library (see configuration), then the DFT and FFT buttons really perform the same transform (so there is no speed-up in using FFT in this case). If you want Grace can to use FFTW wisdom files, you should set several environment variables to name them.\n\nRunning averages\n\nThe running average popup allows you to compute some values on a sliding window over your data. You choose both the value you need (average, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) and the length of the window and perform the operation. You can restrict the operation to the points belonging to (or outside of) a region.\n\nDifferences\n\nThe differences popup is used to compute approximations of the first derivative of a function with finite differences. The only choice (apart from the source set of course) is the type of differences to use: forward, backward or centered.\n\nSeasonal differences\n\nThe seasonal differences popup is used to subtract data from a period to data of the preceding period (namely y[i] - y[i + period]). Beware that the period is entered in terms of index in the set and not in terms of abscissa!\n\nIntegration\n\nThe integration popup is used to compute the integral of a set and optionally to load it. The numerical value of the integral is shown in the text field after computation. Selecting \"cumulative sum\" in the choice item will create and load a new set with the integral and compute the end value, selecting \"sum only\" will only compute the end value.\n\nInterpolation/Splines\n\nThis popup is used to interpolate a set on an array of alternative X coordinates. This is mainly used before performing some complex operations between two sets with the evaluate expression popup.\n\nThe sampling array can be either a linear mesh defined by its min, max, and length values, or a mesh formed by abscissas of another set.\n\nSeveral interpolation methods can be used: linear, spline or Akima spline.\n\nNote that if the sampling mesh is not entirely within the source set X bounds, evaluation at the points beyond the bounds will be performed using interpolation parameters from the first (or the last) segment of the source set, which can be considered a primitive extrapolation. This behaviour can be disabled by checking the \"Strict\" option on the popup.\n\nThe abscissas of the set being interpolated must form a strictly monotonic array.\n\nRegression\n\nThe regression popup can be used to fit a set against polynomials or some specific functions (y=A*x^B, y=A*exp(B*x), y=A+B*ln(x) and y=1/(A+Bx)) for which a simple transformation of input data can be used to apply linear regression formulas.\n\nYou can load either the fitted values, the residuals or the function itself. Choosing to load fitted values or residuals leads to a set of the same length and abscissas as the initial set. Choosing to load the function is almost similar to load the fitted values except that you choose yourself the boundaries and the number of points. This can be used for example to draw the curve outside of the data sample range or to produce an evenly spaced set from an irregular one.\n\nNon-linear fit\n\nThe non linear fit popup can be used for functions outside of the simple regression methods scope. With this popup you provide the expression yourself using a0, a1, ..., a9 to denote the fit parameters (as an example you can say y = a0 * cos (a1 * x + a2)). You specify a tolerance, starting values and optional bounds and run several steps before loading the results.\n\nThe fit characteristics (number of parameters, formula, ...) can be saved in a file and retrieved as needed using the file menu of the popup.\n\nIn the \"Advanced\" tab, you can additionally apply a restriction to the set(s) to be fitted (thus ignoring points not satisfying the criteria), use one of preset weighting schemes or define your own (notice that \"dY\" in the preset \"1/dY^2\" one actually refers to the third column of the data set; use the \"Custom\" function if this doesn't make sense for your data set), and choose whether to load the fitted values, the residuals or the function itself. Choosing to load fitted values or residuals leads to a set of the same length and abscissas as the initial set. Choosing to load the function is almost similar to load the fitted values except that you choose yourself the boundaries and the number of points. This can be used for example to draw the curve outside of the data sample range or to produce an evenly spaced set from an irregular one.\n\nCorrelation/covariance\n\nThis popup can be used to compute autocorrelation of one set or cross correlation between two sets. You only select the set (or sets) and specify the maximum lag. A check box allows one to evaluate covariance instead of correlation. The result is normalized so that abs(C(0)) = 1.\n\nDigital filter\n\nYou can use a set as a weight to filter another set. Only the Y part and the length of the weighting set are important, the X part is ignored.\n\nLinear convolution\n\nThe convolution popup is used to ... convolve two sets. You only select the sets and apply.\n\nGeometric transforms\n\nYou can rotate, scale or translate sets using the geometric transformations popup. You specify the characteristics of each transform and the application order.\n\nSample points\n\nThis popup provides two sampling methods. The first one is to choose a starting point and a step, the second one is to select only the points that satisfy a boolean expression you specify.\n\nPrune data\n\nThis popup is devoted to reducing huge sets (and then saving both computation time and disk space).\n\nThe interpolation method can be applied only to ordered sets: it is based on the assumption that if a real point and an interpolation based on neighboring points are closer than a specified threshold, then the point is redundant and can be eliminated.\n\nThe geometric methods (circle, ellipse, rectangle) can be applied to any set, they test each point in turn and keep only those that are not in the neighborhood of previous points.\n\nFeature extraction\n\nGiven a set of curves in a graph, extract a feature from each curve and use the values of the feature to provide the Y values for a new curve.\n\nFeature Description Y minimum Minimum Y value of set Y maximum Maximum Y value of set Y average Average Y value of set Y std. dev. Standard deviation of Y values Y median Median Y value X minimum Minimum X value of set X maximum Maximum X value of set X average Average X value of set X std. dev. Standard deviation of X values X median Median X value Frequency Perform DFT (FFT if set length a power of 2) to find largest frequency component Period Inverse of above Zero crossing Time of the first zero crossing, + or - going Rise time Assume curve starts at the minimum and rises to the maximum, get time to go from 10% to 90% of rise. For single exponential curves, this is 2.2*time constant Fall time Assume curve starts at the maximum and drops to the minimum, get time to go from 90% to 10% of fall Slope Perform linear regression to obtain slope Y intercept Perform linear regression to obtain Y-intercept Set length Number of data points in set Half maximal width Assume curve starts from the minimum, rises to the maximum and drops to the minimum again. Determine the time for which the curve is elevated more than 50% of the maximum rise. Barycenter X Barycenter along X axis Barycenter Y Barycenter along Y axis X (Y max) X of Maximum Y Y (X max) Y of Maximum X integral cumulative sum\n\nExtractable features\n\nImport menu\n\nASCII\n\nRead new sets of data in a graph. A graph selector is used to specify the graph where the data should go (except when reading block data, which are copied to graphs later on).\n\nReading as \"Single set\" means that if the source contains only one column of numeric data, one set will be created using the indices (from 1 to the total number of points) as abscissas and read values as ordinates and that if the source contains more than one column of data, the first two numeric columns will be used. Reading as \"NXY\" means that the first numeric column will provide the abscissas and all remaining columns will provide the ordinates of several sets. Reading as \"Block data\" means all column will be read and stored and that another popup will allow to select the abscissas and ordinates at will. It should be noted that block data are stored as long as you do not override them by a new read. You can still retrieve data from a block long after having closed all popups, using the set selector.\n\nThe set type can be one of the predefined set presentation types (see sets).\n\nThe data source can be selected as \"Disk\" or \"Pipe\". In the first case the text in the \"Selection\" field is considered to be a file name (it can be automatically set by the file selector at the top of the popup). In the latter case the text is considered to be a command which is executed and should produce the data on its standard output. On systems that allows is, the command can be a complete sequence of programs glued together with pipes.\n\nIf the source contains date fields, they should be automatically detected. Several formats are recognized (see appendix dates in grace). Calendar dates are converted to numerical dates upon reading.\n\nThe \"Autoscale on read\" menu controls whether, upon reading in new sets, which axes of the graph should be autoscaled.\n\nNetCDF\n\nThis entry exists only if Grace has been compiled with support for the NetCDF data format (see configuration).\n\nExport menu\n\nASCII\n\nSave data sets in a file. A set selector is used to specify the set to be saved. The format to use for saving data points can be specified (the default value is \"%16.8g\"). A warning is displayed if a file with the same name already exists.\n\n4.6 Plot menu\n\nPlot appearance\n\nThe plot appearance popup let you set the time stamp properties and the background color of the page. The color is used outside of graphs and also on graphs were no specific background color is set. The time stamp is updated every time the project is modified.\n\nGraph appearance\n\nThe graph appearance popup can be displayed from both the plot menu and by double-clicking on a legend, title, or subtitle of a graph (see Clicks and double clicks). The graph selector at the top allows to choose the graph you want to operate on, it also allows certain common actions through its popup menu (see graph selector). Most of the actions can also be performed using the \"Edit\" menu available from the popup menubar. The main tab includes the properties you will need more often (title for example), and other tabs are used to fine tune some less frequently used options (fonts, sizes, colors, placements).\n\nIf you need special characters or special formatting in your title or subtitle, you can use Grace escape sequences (the sequence will appear verbatim in the text field but will be rendered on the graph), see typesetting. If you don't remember the mapping between alphabetic characters and the glyph you need in some specific fonts (mainly symbol and zapfdingbats), you can invoke the font tool from the text field by hitting CTRL-e. You can change fonts and select characters from there, they will be copied back in the text field when you press the \"Accept\" button. Beware of the position of the cursor as you enter text or change font in the font tool, the character or command will be inserted at this position, not at the end of the string!\n\nYou can save graph appearance parameters or retrieve settings previously saved via the \"File\" menu of this popup. In the \"Save parameters\" dialog, you can choose to save settings either for the current graph only or for all graphs.\n\nSet appearance\n\nThe set appearance popup can be displayed from both the plot menu and by double-clicking anywhere in a graph (see Clicks and double clicks). The set selector at the top allows to choose the set you want to operate on, it also allows certain common actions through its popup menu (see set selector). The main tab gathers the properties you will need more often (line and symbol properties or legend string for example), and other tabs are used to fine tune some less frequently used options (drop lines, fill properties, annotated values and error bars properties for example).\n\nYou should note that despite the legend string related to one set is entered in the set appearance popup, this is not sufficient to display it. Displaying all legends is a graph level decision, so the toggle is in the main tab of the graph appearance popup.\n\nIf you need special characters or special formatting in your legend, you can use Grace escape sequences (the sequence will appear verbatim in the text field but will be rendered on the graph), see typesetting. If you don't remember the mapping between alphabetic characters and the glyph you need in some specific fonts (mainly symbol and zapfdingbats), you can invoke the font tool from the text field by hitting CTRL-e. You can change fonts and select characters from there, they will be copied back in the text field when you press the \"Accept\" button. Beware of the position of the cursor as you enter text or change font in the font tool, the character or command will be inserted at this position, not at the end of the string!\n\nAxis properties\n\nThe axis properties popup can be displayed from both the \"Plot\" menu and by double-clicking exactly on an axis (see Clicks and double clicks). The pulldown menu at the top allows to select the axis you want to operate on. The \"Active\" toggle globally activates or deactivates the axis (all GUI elements are insensitive for deactivated axes). The start and stop fields depict the displayed range. Three types of scales are available: linear, logarithmic or reciprocal, and you can invert the axis (which normally increases from left to right and from bottom to top). The main tab includes the properties you will need more often (axis label, tick spacing and format for example), and other tabs are used to fine tune some less frequently used options (fonts, sizes, colors, placements, stagger, grid lines, special ticks, ...).\n\nIf you need special characters or special formatting in your label, you can use Grace escape sequences (the sequence will appear verbatim in the text field but will be rendered on the graph), see typesetting. If you don't remember the mapping between alphabetic characters and the glyph you need in some specific fonts (mainly symbol and zapfdingbats), you can invoke the font tool from the text field by hitting CTRL-e. You can change fonts and select characters from there, they will be copied back in the text field when you press the \"Accept\" button. Beware of the position of the cursor as you enter text or change font in the font tool, the character or command will be inserted at this position, not at the end of the string!\n\nMost of the controls in the dialog should be self-explanatory. One that is not (and frequently missed) is the \"Axis transform\" input field in the \"Tick labels\" tab. Entering there e.g. \"-$t\" will make the tick labels show negates of the real coordinates their ticks are placed at. You can use any expression understood by the interpreter (see command interpreter).\n\nOnce you have set the options as you want, you can apply them. One useful feature is that you can set several axes at once with the bottom pulldown menu (current axis, all axes current graph, current axis all graphs, all axes all graphs). Beware that you always apply the properties of all tabs, not only the selected one.\n\n4.7 View menu\n\nShow locator bar\n\nThis toggle item shows or hides the locator below the menu bar.\n\nShow status bar\n\nThis toggle item shows or hides the status string below the canvas.\n\nShow tool bar\n\nThis toggle item shows or hides the tool bar at the left of the canvas.\n\nPage setup\n\nSet the properties of the display device. It is the same dialog as in Print setup.\n\nRedraw\n\nThis menu item triggers a redrawing of the canvas.\n\nUpdate all\n\nThis menu item causes an update of all GUI controls. Usually, everything is updated automatically, unless one makes modifications by entering commands in the Command tool.\n\n4.8 Window menu\n\nCommands\n\nCommand driven version of the interface to Grace. Here, commands are typed at the \"Command:\" text item and executed when <Return> is pressed. The command will be parsed and executed, and the command line is placed in the history list. Items in the history list can be recalled by simply clicking on them with the left mouse button. For a reference on the Grace command interpreter, see Command interpreter.\n\nPoint tracking\n\nNot written yet...\n\nDrawing objects\n\nNot written yet...\n\nFont tool\n\nNot written yet...\n\nConsole\n\nThe console window displays errors and results of some numerical operations, e.g. nonlinear fit (see Non-linear fit). The window is popped up automatically whenever an error occurs or new result messages appear. This can be altered by checking the \"Options/Popup only on errors\" option.\n\n4.9 Help menu\n\nOn context\n\nClick on any element of the interface to get context-sensitive help on it. Only partially implemented at the moment.\n\nUser's guide\n\nBrowse the Grace user's guide.\n\nTutorial\n\nBrowse the Grace tutorial.\n\nFAQ\n\nFrequently Asked Questions with answers.\n\nChanges\n\nThe list of changes during the Grace development.\n\nExamples\n\nThe whole tree of submenus each loading a sample plot.\n\nComments\n\nUse this to send your suggestions or bug reports.\n\nLicense terms\n\nGrace licensing terms will be displayed (GPL version 2).\n\nAbout\n\nA popup with basic info on the software, including some configuration details. More details can be found when running Grace with the \"-version\" command line flag.\n\n5. Command interpreter\n\n5.1 General notes\n\nThe interpreter parses its input in a line-by-line manner. There may be several statements per line, separated by semicolon (;). The maximal line length is 4 kbytes (hardcoded). The parser is case-insensitive and ignores lines beginning with the \"#\" sign.\n\n5.2 Definitions\n\nName Description Examples expr Any numeric expression 1.5 + sin(2) iexpr Any expression that evaluates to an integer 25, 0.1 + 1.9, PI/asin(1) nexpr Non-negative iexpr 2 - 1 indx Non-negative iexpr sexpr String expression \"a string\", \"a \" . \"string\", \"square root of 4 = \" . sqrt(4) vexpr Vector expression \"2*x\"\n\nBasic types\n\nExpression Description Types Example GRAPH[id] graph id indx id GRAPH[0] Gnn graph nn nn: 0-99 G0\n\nGraph selections\n\nExpression Description Types Example graph.SETS[id] set id in graph graphindx id, graphsel graph GRAPH[0].SETS[1] graph.Snn set nn in graph graphnn: 0-99, graphsel graph G0.S1 SET[id] set id in the current graphindx id SET[1] Snn set nn in the current graphnn: 0-99 S1 S_ the last implicitly (i.e. as a result of a data transformation) allocated set in the current graph- S_ S$ the active set in the current graph- S$\n\nSet selections\n\nExpression Description Types Example Rn region n n: 0-4 R0\n\nRegion selections\n\nExpression Description Types Example COLOR \"colorname\" a mapped color colorname - COLOR \"red\" COLOR id a mapped color with ID id nexpr id COLOR 2\n\nColor selections\n\nExpression Description Types Example PATTERN id pattern with ID id nexpr id PATTERN 1\n\nPattern selections\n\nExpression Description Types Example X the first column - X Y the second column - Y Yn (n + 2)-th column n = 0 - 4 Y3\n\nData column selections\n\nNot finished yet...\n\n5.3 Variables\n\nVariable Description datacolumn data column of current (\"active\") set set.datacolumn data column of set vvar user-defined array vvariable [i:j] segment of a vector variable (elements from i-th to j-th inclusive, i <= j)\n\nVector variables\n\nVariable Description vvariable[i] i-th element of a vector variable var user-defined variable\n\nScalar variables\n\n5.4 Numerical operators and functions\n\nIn numerical expressions, the infix format is used.

Advanced topics\n\n6.1 Fonts\n\nFor all devices, Grace uses Type1 fonts. Both PFA (ASCII) and PFB (binary) formats can be used.\n\nFont configuration\n\nThe file responsible for the font configurations of Grace is fonts/FontDataBase. The first line contains a positive integer specifying the number of fonts declared in that file. All remaining lines contain declarations of one font each, composed out of three fields:\n\nFont name. The name will appear in the font selector controls. Also, backend devices that has built-in fonts, will be given the name as a font identifier.\n\nFont fall-back. Grace will try to use this in case the real font is not found.\n\nFont filename. The file with the font outline data.\n\nHere is the default FontDataBase file:\n\n14 Times-Roman Times-Roman n021003l.pfb Times-Italic Times-Italic n021023l.pfb Times-Bold Times-Bold n021004l.pfb Times-BoldItalic Times-BoldItalic n021024l.pfb Helvetica Helvetica n019003l.pfb Helvetica-Oblique Helvetica-Oblique n019023l.pfb Helvetica-Bold Helvetica-Bold n019004l.pfb Helvetica-BoldOblique Helvetica-BoldOblique n019024l.pfb Courier Courier n022003l.pfb Courier-Oblique Courier-Oblique n022023l.pfb Courier-Bold Courier-Bold n022004l.pfb Courier-BoldOblique Courier-BoldOblique n022024l.pfb Symbol Symbol s050000l.pfb ZapfDingbats ZapfDingbats d050000l.pfb\n\nFont data files\n\nFor text rastering, three types of files are used.\n\n.pfa-/.pfb-files: These contain the character outline descriptions. The files are assumed to be in the fonts/type1 directory; these are the filenames specified in the FontDataBase configuration file.\n\n.afm-files: These contain high-precision font metric descriptions as well as some extra information, such as kerning and ligature information for a particular font. It is assumed that the filename of a font metric file has same basename as the respective font outline file, but with the .afm extension; the metric files are expected to be found in the fonts/type1 directory, too.\n\n.enc-files: These contain encoding arrays in a special but simple form. They are only needed if someone wants to load a special encoding to re-encode a font. Their place is fonts/enc\n\nCustom fonts\n\nIt is possible to use custom fonts with Grace. One mostly needs to use extra fonts for the purpose of localization. For many European languages, the standard fonts supplied with Grace should contain all the characters needed, but encoding may have to be adjusted. This is done by putting a Default.enc file with proper encoding scheme into the fonts/enc directory. Grace comes with a few encoding files in the directory; more can be easily found on the Internet. (If the Default.enc file doesn't exist, the IsoLatin1 encoding will be used). Notice that for fonts having an encoding scheme in themselves (such as the Symbol font, and many nationalized fonts) the default encoding is ignored.\n\nIf you do need to use extra fonts, you should modify the FontDataBase file accordingly, obeying its format. However, if you are going to exchange Grace project files with other people who do not have the extra fonts configured, an important thing is to define reasonable fall-back font names.\n\nFor example, let us assume I use Hebrew fonts, and the configuration file has lines like these:\n\n... Courier-Hebrew Courier courh___.pfa Courier-Hebrew-Oblique Courier-Oblique courho__.pfa ...\n\nMy colleague, who lives in Russia, uses Cyrillic fonts with Grace configured like this:\n\n... Cronix-Courier Courier croxc.pfb Cronix-Courier-Oblique Courier-Oblique croxco.pfb ...\n\nThe font mapping information (Font name <-> Font fall-back) is stored in the Grace project files. Provided that all the localized fonts have English characters in the lower part of the ASCII table unmodified, I can send my friend files (with no Hebrew characters, of course) and be sure they render correctly on his computer.\n\nThus, with properly configured national fonts, you can make localized annotations for plots intended for internal use of your institution, while being able to exchange files with colleagues from abroad. People who ever tried to do this with MS Office applications should appreciate the flexibility :-).\n\n6.2 Interaction with other applications\n\nUsing pipes\n\nUsing grace_np library\n\nThe grace_np library is a set of compiled functions that allows you to launch and drive a Grace subprocess from your C or Fortran application. Functions are provided to start the subprocess, to send it commands or data, to stop it or detach from it.\n\nFunction Arguments Description int GraceOpenVA (char *exe, int buf_size, ...) launch a Grace executable exe and open a communication channel with it using buf_size bytes for data buffering. The remaining NULL-terminated list of options is command line arguments passed to the Grace process int GraceOpen (int buf_size) equivalent to GraceOpenVA(\"xmgrace\", buf_size, \"-nosafe\", \"-noask\", NULL) int GraceIsOpen (void) test if a Grace subprocess is currently connected int GraceClose (void) close the communication channel and exit the Grace subprocess int GraceClosePipe (void) close the communication channel and leave the Grace subprocess alone int GraceFlush (void) flush all the data remaining in the buffer int GracePrintf (const char* format, ...) format a command and send it to the Grace subprocess int GraceCommand (const char* cmd) send an already formated command to the Grace subprocess GraceErrorFunctionType GraceRegisterErrorFunction (GraceErrorFunctionType f) register a user function f to display library errors\n\ngrace_np library C functions.\n\nFunction Arguments Description integer GraceOpenF (integer buf_size) launch a Grace subprocess and open a communication channel with it integer GraceIsOpenF (void) test if a Grace subprocess is currently connected integer GraceCloseF (void) close the communication channel and exit the Grace subprocess integer GraceClosePipeF (void) close the communication channel and leave the Grace subprocess alone integer GraceFlushF (void) flush all the data remaining in the buffer integer GraceCommandF (character*(*) cmd) send an already formatted command to the Grace subprocess GraceFortranFunctionType GraceRegisterErrorFunctionF (GraceFortranFunctionType f) register a user function f to display library errors\n\ngrace_np library F77 functions.\n\nThere is no Fortran equivalent for the GracePrintf function, you should format all the data and commands yourself before sending them with GraceCommandF.\n\nThe Grace subprocess listens for the commands you send and interprets them as if they were given in a batch file. You can send any command you like (redraw, autoscale, ...). If you want to send data, you should include them in a command like \"g0.s0 point 3.5, 4.2\".\n\nApart from the fact it monitors the data sent via an anonymous pipe, the Grace subprocess is a normal process. You can interact with it through the GUI. Note that no error can be sent back to the parent process. If your application send erroneous commands, an error popup will be displayed by the subprocess.\n\nIf you exit the subprocess while the parent process is still using it, the broken pipe will be detected. An error code will be returned to every further call to the library (but you can still start a new process if you want to manage this situation).\n\nHere is an example use of the library, you will find this program in the distribution.\n\n#include <stdlib.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <grace_np.h> #ifndef EXIT_SUCCESS # define EXIT_SUCCESS 0 #endif #ifndef EXIT_FAILURE # define EXIT_FAILURE -1 #endif void my_error_function(const char *msg) { fprintf(stderr, \"library message: \\\"%s\\\"\\n\", msg); } int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { int i; GraceRegisterErrorFunction(my_error_function); /* Start Grace with a buffer size of 2048 and open the pipe */ if (GraceOpen(2048) == -1) { fprintf(stderr, \"Can't run Grace. \\n\"); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } /* Send some initialization commands to Grace */ GracePrintf(\"world xmax 100\"); GracePrintf(\"world ymax 10000\"); GracePrintf(\"xaxis tick major 20\"); GracePrintf(\"xaxis tick minor 10\"); GracePrintf(\"yaxis tick major 2000\"); GracePrintf(\"yaxis tick minor 1000\"); GracePrintf(\"s0 on\"); GracePrintf(\"s0 symbol 1\"); GracePrintf(\"s0 symbol size 0.3\"); GracePrintf(\"s0 symbol fill pattern 1\"); GracePrintf(\"s1 on\"); GracePrintf(\"s1 symbol 1\"); GracePrintf(\"s1 symbol size 0.3\"); GracePrintf(\"s1 symbol fill pattern 1\"); /* Display sample data */ for (i = 1; i <= 100 && GraceIsOpen(); i++) { GracePrintf(\"g0.s0 point %d, %d\", i, i); GracePrintf(\"g0.s1 point %d, %d\", i, i * i); /* Update the Grace display after every ten steps */ if (i % 10 == 0) { GracePrintf(\"redraw\"); /* Wait a second, just to simulate some time needed for calculations. Your real application shouldn't wait. */ sleep(1); } } if (GraceIsOpen()) { /* Tell Grace to save the data */ GracePrintf(\"saveall \\\"sample.agr\\\"\"); /* Flush the output buffer and close Grace */ GraceClose(); /* We are done */ exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); } else { exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } }\n\nTo compile this program, type\n\ncc example.c -lgrace_np\n\nIf Grace wasn't properly installed, you may need to instruct the compiler about include and library paths explicitly, e.g.\n\ncc -I/usr/local/grace/include example.c -L/usr/local/grace/lib -lgrace_np\n\n6.3 FFTW tuning\n\nWhen the FFTW capabilities are compiled in, Grace looks at two environment variables to decide what to do with the FFTW 'wisdom' capabilities. First, a quick summary of what this is. The FFTW package is capable of adaptively determining the most efficient factorization of a set to give the fastest computation. It can store these factorizations as 'wisdom', so that if a transform of a given size is to be repeated, it is does not have to re-adapt. The good news is that this seems to work very well. The bad news is that, the first time a transform of a given size is computed, if it is not a sub-multiple of one already known, it takes a LONG time (seconds to minutes).\n\nThe first environment variable is GRACE_FFTW_WISDOM_FILE. If this is set to the name of a file which can be read and written (e.g., $HOME/.grace_fftw_wisdom) then Grace will automatically create this file (if needed) and maintain it. If the file is read-only, it will be read, but not updated with new wisdom. If the symbol GRACE_FFTW_WISDOM_FILE either doesn't exist, or evaluates to an empty string, Grace will drop the use of wisdom, and will use the fftw estimator (FFTW_ESTIMATE flag sent to the planner) to guess a good factorization, instead of adaptively determining it.\n\nThe second variable is GRACE_FFTW_RAM_WISDOM. If this variable is defined to be non-zero, and GRACE_FFTW_WISDOM_FILE variable is not defined (or is an empty string), Grace will use wisdom internally, but maintain no persistent cache of it. This will result in very slow execution times the first time a transform is executed after Grace is started, but very fast repeats. I am not sure why anyone would want to use wisdom without writing it to disk, but if you do, you can use this flag to enable it.\n\n6.4 DL modules\n\nGrace can access external functions present in either system or third-party shared libraries or modules specially compiled for use with Grace.\n\nFunction types\n\nOne must make sure, however, that the external function is of one of supported by Grace types:\n\nGrace type Description f_of_i a function of 1 int variable f_of_d a function of 1 double variable f_of_nn a function of 2 int parameters f_of_nd a function of 1 int parameter and 1 double variable f_of_dd a function of 2 double variables f_of_nnd a function of 2 int parameters and 1 double variable f_of_ppd a function of 2 double parameters and 1 double variable f_of_pppd a function of 3 double parameters and 1 double variable f_of_ppppd a function of 4 double parameters and 1 double variable f_of_pppppd a function of 5 double parameters and 1 double variable\n\nGrace types for external functions\n\nThe return values of functions are assumed to be of the double type.\n\nNote, that there is no difference from the point of view of function prototype between parameters and variables; the difference is in the way Grace treats them - an attempt to use a vector expression as a parameter argument will result in a parse error.\n\nLet us consider few examples.\n\nExamples\n\nCaution: the examples provided below (paths and compiler flags) are valid for Linux/ELF with gcc. On other operating systems, you may need to refer to compiler/linker manuals or ask a guru.\n\nExample 1\n\nSuppose I want to use function pow(x,y) from the Un*x math library (libm). Of course, you can use the \"^\" operator defined in the Grace language, but here, for the sake of example, we want to access the function directly.\n\nThe command to make it accessible by Grace is\n\nUSE \"pow\" TYPE f_of_dd FROM \"/usr/lib/libm.so\"\n\nTry to plot y = pow(x,2) and y = x^2 graphs (using, for example, \"create new -> Formula\" from any set selector) and compare.\n\nExample 2\n\nNow, let us try to write a function ourselves. We will define function my_function which simply returns its (second) argument multiplied by integer parameter transferred as the first argument.\n\nIn a text editor, type in the following C code and save it as \"my_func.c\":\n\ndouble my_function (int n, double x) { double retval; retval = (double) n * x; return (retval); }\n\nOK, now compile it:\n\n$gcc -c -fPIC my_func.c $gcc -shared my_func.o -o /tmp/my_func.so\n\n(You may strip it to save some disk space):\n\n$strip /tmp/my_func.so\n\nThat's all! Ready to make it visible to Grace as \"myf\" - we are too lazy to type the very long string \"my_function\" many times.\n\nUSE \"my_function\" TYPE f_of_nd FROM \"/tmp/my_func.so\" ALIAS \"myf\"\n\nExample 3\n\nA more serious example. There is a special third-party library available on your system which includes a very important for you yet very difficult-to-program from the scratch function that you want to use with Grace. But, the function prototype is NOT one of any predefined types. The solution is to write a simple function wrapper. Here is how:\n\nSuppose, the name of the library is \"special_lib\" and the function you are interested in is called \"special_func\" and according to the library manual, should be accessed as void special_func(double *input, double *output, int parameter). The wrapper would look like this:\n\ndouble my_wrapper(int n, double x) { extern void special_func(double *x, double *y, int n); double retval; (void) special_func(&x, &retval, n); return (retval); }\n\nCompile it:\n\n$gcc -c -fPIC my_wrap.c $gcc -shared my_wrap.o -o /tmp/my_wrap.so -lspecial_lib -lblas $strip /tmp/my_wrap.so\n\nNote that I added -lblas assuming that the special_lib library uses some functions from the BLAS. Generally, you have to add all libraries which your module depends on (and all libraries those libraries rely upon etc.), as if you wanted to compile a plain executable.\n\nFine, make Grace aware of the new function\n\nUSE \"my_wrapper\" TYPE f_of_nd FROM \"/tmp/my_wrap.so\" ALIAS \"special_func\"\n\nso we can use it with its original name.\n\nExample 4\n\nAn example of using Fortran modules.\n\nHere we will try to achieve the same functionality as in Example 2, but with the help of F77.\n\nDOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION MYFUNC (N, X) IMPLICIT NONE INTEGER N DOUBLE PRECISION X C MYFUNC = N * X C RETURN END\n\nAs opposite to C, there is no way to call such a function from Grace directly - the problem is that in Fortran all arguments to a function (or subroutine) are passed by reference. So, we need a wrapper:\n\ndouble myfunc_wrapper(int n, double x) { extern double myfunc_(int *, double *); double retval; retval = myfunc_(&n, &x); return (retval); }\n\nNote that most of f77 compilers by default add underscore to the function names and convert all names to the lower case, hence I refer to the Fortran function MYFUNC from my C wrapper as myfunc_, but in your case it can be different!\n\nLet us compile the whole stuff:\n\n$g77 -c -fPIC myfunc.f $gcc -c -fPIC myfunc_wrap.c $gcc -shared myfunc.o myfunc_wrap.o -o /tmp/myfunc.so -lf2c -lm $strip /tmp/myfunc.so\n\nAnd finally, inform Grace about this new function:\n\nUSE \"myfunc_wrapper\" TYPE f_of_nd FROM \"/tmp/myfunc.so\" ALIAS \"myfunc\"\n\nOperating system issues\n\nOS/2\n\nIn general the method outlined in the examples above can be used on OS/2, too. However you have to create a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) which is a bit more tricky on OS/2 than on most Un*x systems. Since Grace was ported by using EMX we also use it to create the examples; however other development environments should work as well (ensure to use the _System calling convention!). We refer to Example 2 only. Example 1 might demonstrate that DLLs can have their entry points (i.e. exported functions) callable via ordinals only, so you might not know how to access a specific function without some research. First compile the source from Example 2 to \"my_func.obj\"\n\ngcc -Zomf -Zmt -c my_func.c -o my_func.obj\n\nThen you need to create a linker definition file \"my_func.def\" which contains some basic info about the DLL and declares the exported functions.\n\nLIBRARY my_func INITINSTANCE TERMINSTANCE CODE LOADONCALL DATA LOADONCALL MULTIPLE NONSHARED DESCRIPTION 'This is a test DLL: my_func.dll' EXPORTS my_function\n\n(don't forget about the 8 characters limit on the DLL name!). Finally link the DLL:\n\ngcc my_func.obj my_func.def -o my_func.dll -Zdll -Zno-rte -Zmt -Zomf\n\n(check out the EMX documentation about the compiler/linker flags used here!) To use this new library function within Grace you may either put the DLL in the LIBPATH and use the short form:\n\nUSE \"my_function\" TYPE f_of_nd FROM \"my_func\" ALIAS \"myf\"\n\nor put it in an arbitrary path which you need to specify explicitly then:\n\nUSE \"my_function\" TYPE f_of_nd FROM \"e:/foo/my_func.dll\" ALIAS \"myf\"\n\n(as for most system-APIs you may use the Un*x-like forward slashs within the path!)\n\n7. References\n\n7.1 Typesetting\n\nGrace permits quite complex typesetting on a per string basis. Any string displayed (titles, legends, tick marks,...) may contain special control codes to display subscripts, change fonts within the string etc.\n\nControl code Description \\f{x} switch to font named \"x\" \\f{n} switch to font number n \\f{} return to original font \\R{x} switch to color named \"x\" \\R{n} switch to color number n \\R{} return to original color \\#{x} treat \"x\" (must be of even length) as list of hexadecimal char codes \\t{xx xy yx yy} apply transformation matrix \\t{} reset transformation matrix \\z{x} zoom x times \\z{} return to original zoom \\r{x} rotate by x degrees \\l{x} slant by factor x \\v{x} shift vertically by x \\v{} return to unshifted baseline \\V{x} shift baseline by x \\V{} reset baseline \\h{x} horizontal shift by x \\n new line \\u begin underline \\U stop underline \\o begin overline \\O stop overline \\Fk enable kerning \\FK disable kerning \\Fl enable ligatures \\FL disable ligatures \\m{n} mark current position as n \\M{n} return to saved position n \\dl LtoR substring direction \\dr RtoL substring direction \\dL LtoR text advancing \\dR RtoL text advancing \\x switch to Symbol font (same as \\f{Symbol}) \\+ increase size (same as \\z{1.19} ; 1.19 = sqrt(sqrt(2))) \\- decrease size (same as \\z{0.84} ; 0.84 = 1/sqrt(sqrt(2))) \\s begin subscripting (same as \\v{-0.4}\\z{0.71}) \\S begin superscripting (same as \\v{0.6}\\z{0.71}) \\T{xx xy yx yy} same as \\t{}\\t{xx xy yx yy} \\Z{x} absolute zoom x times (same as \\z{}\\z{x}) \\q make font oblique (same as \\l{0.25}) \\Q undo oblique (same as \\l{-0.25}) \\N return to normal style (same as \\v{}\\t{}) \\\\ print \\ \\n switch to font number n (0-9) (deprecated) \\c begin using upper 128 characters of set (deprecated) \\C stop using upper 128 characters of set (deprecated)\n\nControl codes.\n\nExample:\n\nF\\sX\\N(\\xe\\f{}) = sin(\\xe\\f{})\\#{b7}e\\S-X\\N\\#{b7}cos(\\xe\\f{})\n\nprints roughly\n\n-x F (e) = sin(e)·e ·cos(e) x\n\nusing string's initial font and e prints as epsilon from the Symbol font.\n\nNOTE: Characters from the upper half of the char table can be entered directly from the keyboard, using appropriate xmodmap(1) settings, or with the help of the font tool (\"Window/Font tool\").\n\n7.2 Device-specific limitations\n\nGrace can output plots using several device backends. The list of available devices can be seen (among other stuff) by specifying the \"-version\" command line switch.\n\nX11, PostScript and EPS are full-featured devices\n\nRaster drivers (PNM/JPEG/PNG):\n\nonly even-odd fill rule is supported\n\npatterned lines are not implemented\n\nPDF driver:\n\nbitmapped text strings are not transparent\n\nMIF driver:\n\nsome of patterned fills not implemented\n\nbitmapped text strings not implemented\n\nSVG driver:\n\nbitmapped text strings not implemented\n\n7.3 Device-specific settings\n\nSome of the output devices accept several configuration options. You can set the options by passing a respective string to the interpreter using the \"DEVICE \"devname\" OP \"options\"\" command (see Device parameters). A few options can be passed in one command, separated by commas.\n\nCommand Description grayscale set grayscale output color set color output level1 use only PS Level 1 subset of commands level2 use also PS Level 2 commands if needed docdata:7bit the document data is 7bit clean docdata:8bit the document data is 8bit clean docdata:binary the document data may be binary xoffset:x set page offset in X direction x pp yoffset:y set page offset in Y direction y pp mediafeed:auto default input tray mediafeed:match select input with media matching page dimensions mediafeed:manual manual media feed hwresolution:on set hardware resolution hwresolution:off do not set hardware resolution\n\nPostScript driver options\n\nCommand Description grayscale set grayscale output color set color output level1 use only PS Level 1 subset of commands level2 use also PS Level 2 commands if needed bbox:tight enable \"tight\" bounding box bbox:page bounding box coincides with page dimensions\n\nEPS driver options\n\nCommand Description PDF1.3 set compatibility mode to PDF-1.3 PDF1.4 set compatibility mode to PDF-1.4 compression:value set compression level (0 - 9) patterns:on enable use of patterns patterns:off disable use of patterns\n\nPDF driver options\n\nCommand Description format:pbm output in PBM format format:pgm output in PGM format format:ppm output in PPM format rawbits:on \"rawbits\" (binary) output rawbits:off ASCII output\n\nPNM driver options\n\nCommand Description grayscale set grayscale output color set color output optimize:on/off enable/disable optimization quality:value set compression quality (0 - 100) smoothing:value set smoothing (0 - 100) baseline:on/off do/don't force baseline output progressive:on/off do/don't output in progressive format dct:ifast use fast integer DCT method dct:islow use slow integer DCT method dct:float use floating-point DCT method\n\nJPEG driver options\n\nCommand Descriptio"
