        "text": "Someone asked me to address all of the passages in Scripture that deal with baptism. One of the most important passages is the one in John 3:5 where Jesus said the following:\n\nVerily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\n\nThe best way to approach this passage is to ask yourself a few questions.\n\n1) Can physical water (H20) lead to salvation? 2) Can repentance lead to salvation?\n\nI am sure we can all agree that #1 cannot lead to salvation whilst #2 can lead to salvation. Combine the two – water and repentance – and you have what Paul said of John’s baptism: “John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.” (Acts 19:4).\n\nNicodemus, like every Jew, knew exactly what Jesus meant when He referred to water as a requirement to enter the Kingdom of God. It couldn’t have been physical water of which he spoke because He made it abundantly clear that washing ceremonies couldn’t produce spiritual purity. Ponder these passages for a moment.\n\nThen came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. (Matthew 15:1-11).\n\nWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. (Matthew 23:25)\n\nHaving established that Jesus couldn’t have referred to physical water as a requirement to enter God’s Kingdom (to be saved), it must have been something else to which He referred. And indeed, it was. The “water “refers to the repentance ministry of John the Baptist. Jews were very particular about signs (Matthew 12:38-39; 16:1). With John’s baptism the Jews expressed their change of mind (metanoia) in regard to Jesus Christ.\n\nIn a nutshell then; the water points to the repentance ministry of John the Baptist and the “Spirit” to the application by the Holy Spirit of Christ to an individual. As such the water baptism of John was a preliminary and anticipatory baptism (Matthew 3:4) making it clear that repentance (a change of mind) was necessary before a repentant sinner could be saved. So Jesus was actually saying that Nicodemus, in order to enter the Kingdom of God, needed to turn to Him (repent) (Matthew 11:18) in order to be regenerated by the Holy Spirit. As such it does not follow salvation (the baptism with the Holy Spirit) as a signal or sign that the repentant sinner has died, been buried and raised with Christ but actually precedes it. Therefore, repentance (expressed in the rite of John’s baptism) leads to salvation.\n\nRepentance (a change of mind) is of itself not salvation. There is nothing man can do of his own accord to be saved. This is where Calvinists miss the boat when they argue that man is unable to do anything to be saved. They presume that anyone who has repented (changed his mind) for the remission of his sins (the message John preached in the wilderness – Matthew 1:4) is assisting God in his redemptive work. Therefore God must sovereignly and irresistibly regenerate the elect only so that they may repent which amounts to a kind of “the elect must first be saved before they are able to repent.” They have reversed the order of salvation, i.e. from “repentance leads to salvation” to “sovereign election and regeneration leads to repentance.” Jesus gave us the order of salvation — “water” (John’s baptism of repentance) and then the baptism of the Holy Spirit (salvation proper). It is impossible to reverse the two. In fact, those who believe water baptism by immersion is a sign or symbol of a believer’s immersion into the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ are doing the very same thing. They are saying: “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of the Spirit and of water, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” “Water now becomes the sign or symbol of salvation itself (no longer of repentance as in John’s water baptism) and therefore must be administered after salvation (baptism with the Holy Spirit), making it a so-called Believer’s Baptism.\n\nTo reiterate what I said earlier, I need to remind you that the believer’s baptism (immersion) into the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ is not constituted by a once-off symbol bearing sacrament but a continual and obedient reckoning (rational) that we are indeed dead to sin and alive to God.\n\nFor in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin (and NOT, look back in retrospect to your once-off baptism by immersion in water), but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:10-11)\n\nImportance of Baptism\n\nFaith that isn't tested isn't faith. We are indeed saved by faith and not works, but a faith without works is a dead faith and that won't save anyone. If I say I have 1 million pounds in the bank, you can say you believe me as much as you like, but how do I know you really do believe me without some sort of test? So here's the test: I give you a cheque for 1 million pounds. And by the way you happen to be living in a country where you owe a debt of 1 million pounds, and the penalty for failing to pay is death (actually eternal death in the lake of fire). Now you can tell the judge you believe that some kind benefactor (not me actually, but God) has given you a cheque for 1 million pounds as much as you like and you're not lying at all. (Aside: the benefactor is the judge, and that's God). You didn't earn the 1 million pounds. God did. But if you don't pay the cheque into your bank (get baptised), you won't be able to use a single penny of that money, and so you'll be condemned to death. Paying the cheque into the bank (getting baptised) didn't earn you the money and the faith to believe that you needed to pay the cheque into the bank as well as the strength to do so are both gifts of God. Grace and works are not enemies, but friends:\n\n10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.\n\n(1 Cor 15.10)\n\nDoing work (i.e. being baptised means that the grace is not in vain i.e. faith isn't woolly, but concrete. It accomplishes something. The word which is sown bears fruit if the hearers have a root and receive it, as the Lord explains in the parable of the sower:\n\n18 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. 19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. 20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. 22 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. 23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.\n\nIt is faith in something, or rather someone: in God and His Word: His Son. If we believe His words, this means we act accordingly, or else how can we believe? In this case, we're believing the opposite of God' words, just like Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. Now, if you don't pay the cheque into the bank and you say you believe you have a cheque for 1 million pounds and God's paid your debt, there are only 2 conclusions:\n\nYou are lying and you don't believe the cheque for 1 million pounds in genuine.\n\nyou don't understand how the banking system works. This is true of many, as The Lord warned us in the first verse of the parable of the sower (which I repeat) and 2 other places:\n\n18 “Therefore hear the parable of the sower: 19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, then the wicked one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is he who received seed by the wayside. (Matt 13.18-19)\n\n46 “But why do you call Me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do the things which I say? 47 Whoever comes to Me, and hears My sayings and does them, I will show you whom he is like: 48 He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently against that house, and could not shake it, for it was founded on the rock.[h] 49 But he who heard and did nothing is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream beat vehemently; and immediately it fell.[i] And the ruin of that house was great.”\n\n(Luke 6.46-49)\n\n48 He who rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him—the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day. 49 For I have not spoken on My own authority; but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say and what I should speak. 50 And I know that His command is everlasting life. Therefore, whatever I speak, just as the Father has told Me, so I speak.”\n\n(John 12. 48-50)\n\nYahshua's words:\n\n16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. (Mark 16.16)\n\nDon't allow the devil to deceive you into thinking you will be ok if you ignore God's words spoken by His Son on baptism as he deceived Eve into thinking it was a good idea to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, against God's express command, which she even quoted (you can quote God's Word as much as you like. If it's a command, and you disobey it, it won't help you in the slightest to quote it. What's required is obedience):\n\n3 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? 2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: 3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. 6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.\n\n(Genesis 3.1-6)\n\nRemember also this:\n\n21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. 22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? 23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. 24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: 25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. 26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: 27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. 28 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine: 29 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.\n\nThe subject of the thief on the cross and Yahshua forgiving people 'without the need for actions on their part' is very interesting.\n\n39 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? 41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. 42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. 43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.\n\nNotice the following:\n\nthe thief on the cross did do something. He challenged the other thief who was deriding The Lord. These words obviously came out of the abundance of his heart. In his heart, he believed The Lord had done nothing wrong and even that He was a king, but much more importantly:\n\nThe thief on the cross and the other people referred to were forgiven before Yahshua died on the cross, before He'd risen and issued the following command \"...Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.\" (Mark 16.15-16)\n\nEven the man let down through the roof who was healed and forgiven was instructed to do something:\n\n2 And again He entered Capernaum after some days, and it was heard that He was in the house. 2 Immediately[a] many gathered together, so that there was no longer room to receive them, not even near the door. And He preached the word to them. 3 Then they came to Him, bringing a paralytic who was carried by four men. 4 And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. So when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying. 5 When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven you.” 6 And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 7 “Why does this Man speak blasphemies like this? Who can forgive sins but God alone?” 8 But immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, He said to them, “Why do you reason about these things in your hearts? 9 Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Arise, take up your bed and walk’? 10 But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins”—He said to the paralytic, 11 “I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.” 12 Immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went out in the presence of them all, so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”\n\nNote that it was when Yahshua saw their faith, that He responded. It's impossible to please God without faith, and faith is something God can see, because what we believe is shown by how we act. It wasn't the man's strength that healed him. It was the grace of God that gave him the power to walk, but nevertheless he walked! In the same way, it isn't our strength which gives us forgiveness and strength when we get baptised, but we still get baptised and thereby appopriate what Yahshua did on the cross! It's the grace of God that made the man walk and it's the grace of God that makes people get baptised. If we could be saved without being baptised, then why in Mark 16.16 are we told that Yahsua said \"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned\"? Not because God's contradicting Himself (He's not), but because it's perfectly true that he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. Never disagree with anything Yahshua said: your eternal salvation depends on it. Getting baptised doesn't mean we saved oursleves by our own work, since it's the goodness of God which leads us to get baptised and the grace of God which empowers us to. Grace doesn't mean you don't do anything. It means you do impossible things and you don't get the glory: God does, but you still do the stuff and you feel great beacuse God has glorified you too (Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified, (Romans 8.30)), as you are abiding in His Son, who has been, is being and will be glorified. I ask people who think that noone's perfect so we can just sin as we please and still get to heaven this question: did The Son of God die on the cross to make us imperfect? Of course not:\n\n21 For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.\n\n(1 Cor 5.21)\n\nWhat does righteousness mean? Clearly it means doing what is right, not what is wrong. That doing what is right takes place by the grace of God, but it still takes place.\n\n9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals,[a] nor sodomites, 10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.\n\n(1 Cor 6.9-11)\n\n13 For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.\n\n(Romans 8.13)\n\nTo respond to the note that the question is about GRACE rather than FAITH, I quote Paul again:\n\n5 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 2 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. (Romans 5.1-2)\n\n1. If we are saved by grace, then why does Jesus say we must be baptized in both spirit and water?\n\nJesus requires us to be born of water and Spirit to enter into His Kingdom(John 3:5), to refuse to listen to His commands is not wise. To have faith in Jesus is to obey His commands. Faith without love is worthless(\"Three things will last forever—faith, hope, and love—and the greatest of these is love.1 corinthians 13:13), to love your God with all your heart, soul and mind is the greatest commands(just as loving your neighbor as yourself),if you really loved Jesus, you would obey His commands(John 14:21) which is to be baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit(Matthew 28:19). The doers of the word are blessed in what they do(James 1:25), but the hearers of the word are deceived(James 1:22). Jesus tells us to be born of the water and Spirit and He even ordained his disciples to go around the world baptizing people and telling them what He has commanded them(Matthew 28:19). Again, if Jesus commands us to be born of water, why would anyone object to it? Jesus commanded his disciples to baptize people, why would anyone object, getting baptized? Remember, Jesus's words are Spirit and Life(John 6:63), anyone who listens to Jesus's words and refuses to act on it(E.g: refuse to get baptized) is like a person building his house on sand(Matthew 7:24).\n\nSpecial circumstances : *Nailed: The thief on the cross didn't have an option to go down and be baptized, he was nailed on a cross, he could only ask Jesus to save him(that was his only option). *If someone lives in a hostile environment, they can always ask Christian friends to baptize them in a bathtub, pool or anything that can be filled with water. (Tip: If you have true faith in God, you can always ask Jesus to make a way for you to get baptized. Nothing is impossible for Him, He is LORD)\n\n*If someone has a disease: Just because someone has a disease, doesn't mean they can not go in the water. Again, I would get some gloves or buy a hazmat suit, if it is what it takes. I would certainly use my own resources and meet anywhere, to baptize someone who really wants to be a child of God(by obeying Jesus's commands)(Tip:If you have true faith in God, you can always ask Jesus to make a way for you to get baptized.Nothing is impossible for Him, He is LORD)\n\n*Allergic to water: This is a very special circumstance. In this case, I would intercede for this person, I would ask Jesus to spiritually baptize this person or that person could ask Jesus directly. (Tip: If you have true faith in God, you can always ask Jesus to make a way for you to get baptized. Nothing is impossible for Him, He is LORD)\n\nMost people aren't nailed on a cross, living in a hostile environment or allergic to water, they have no excuses to not get baptized in the name of The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit(Matthew 28:19). There are Christians, who have the love of Christ that can baptize you anywhere, but if you want excuses, you will find them.\n\nBeing born of water\n\nWater: Being born of water isn't being born from the amniotic fluid. If it was, we have billions of unbelievers that are born of the water. The amniotic fluid is unscriptural and has no basis. Again why would Jesus tell Nicodemus to be born of the water, if the amniotic fluid symbolizes being born of the water? (Nicodemus came from the amniotic fluid just like all humans).Nicodemus wasn't born of the water that's why Jesus told him to get born of the water. To be baptized is to be born of the water, Jesus didn't tell the disciples to go around the world, baptizing people for nothing(Matthew 28:19). The requirement to be a disciple of Jesus is to get baptized(\"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\") not faith alone.\n\nBaptism: Even Jesus was baptized, why would anyone who professes to be a follower of Christ refuse to get baptized? No servant is greater than his Master(John 15:20),if Jesus was baptized, we must surely get baptized also. What kind of faith is it, to willingly refuse to do what your Master did? Jesus says that baptism is necessary, to fulfill all righteousness(Matthew 3:15). Why would anyone then, go around saying that faith alone(without baptism and being born of the Spirit) is enough?\n\nThen Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” Jesus replied, “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John consented. As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. Matthew 3:13 Notice how the Spirit descended after Jesus was baptized, coincidence? I don't think so\n\nBaptism in Jesus time/Were his disciple baptized or baptizing people in his time?:\n\n*Andrew was a disciple of Jesus but before that, he was a disciple of John the Baptist(John 1:40) and he was baptized. Remember, John the Baptist was there to prepare the way for Jesus by baptizing people, he even baptized Jesus.\n\nThis is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: “A voice of one calling in the wilderness,‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’” Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. Matthew 3:13\n\n*Jesus's disciples were baptizing people in his time, I don't know why people keep lying that the disciples didn't baptize people before his death on the cross. Is it really a coincidence that Jesus disciple were baptizing people while Jesus was with them(on earth)? It isn't a coincidence, baptism is a requirement, if it wasn't, Jesus wouldn't have told them to baptize people while He was still on earth and even after He ascended into heaven.\n\nIf they were baptizing people, it means they were also baptized, someone who isn't baptized cannot baptize\n\nAsk yourself this question, are you greater than your Master(Jesus was baptized)? are you greater than the 12 disciples(who were baptized and baptized people in Jesus' time)? If your Master is baptized and his disciple baptized, what makes you think you are going to be in the kingdom with them by faith alone?(willingly refusing to get baptized, which is not hard at all. Again, special circumstances do not apply to most of you)\n\nWhen Jesus realized that the Pharisees were aware that He was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John (although it was not Jesus who baptized, but His disciples), He left Judea and returned to Galilee.John 4:1\n\n2. Therefore, we are saved when we put our faith in Christ alone, realizing that it was by His blood alone that we have forgiveness of all our past, present, and future sins. This is known as being \"baptized in the Holy Spirit./\"So in this passage, Jesus is saying that we must be \"born of the spirit\" (putting our faith in Jesus alone, as mentioned above)\n\nFaith alone isn't being born of the Spirit. Ephesians 2:4-9 talks about faith in Jesus(which is good, since someone has to believe, before being born of the water and of the Spirit).Ephesians 2:4-9 do not talk about being born in the Spirit, you do not see any mention of being born of the Spirit in that verse. If anybody has a verse that shows that being born in Spirit is faith alone, please show it to me and I will make amends\n\nBeing born in the Spirit is about receiving the Spirit of Christ(The Holy Spirit)in you. Jesus tells us that if we love Him and obey His commands, the Father and Him will come and make a home in us(aka being born of the Spirit or receiving the Holy Spirit).\n\n\"Jesus replied, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make Our home with him.Whoever does not love Me does not keep My words.\" John 14:23\n\nAgain, how could anyone be born of the Spirit if they do not keep Jesus's words? (which is to be born of water/get baptized in the name of the Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit)\n\nTo obey Jesus' commands is the way through in and throughout.Let's look at this verse from Romans 8:9\n\nThose controlled by the flesh cannot please God. You, however, are controlled not by the flesh, but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness.\n\nYou see being born of the Spirit is having the Spirit of Christ in you, this change do not happen when you confess Christ with your lips, it happens when Jesus put His Spirit in you. For it to happen you have to obey his commands(refer back to John 14:23). No pastors can see through you, they can't know if you have the Spirit or not(only Jesus who give you the Spirit can know), therefore I wouldn't put too much mind in what they say.\n\nWhen you receive the Spirit, there is external and internal signs.\n\n1.Internal signs: How could anyone receive the Spirit of God in him(refer back Roman 8:9 and John 14:23)and not know it? I wouldn't put my salvation in the words of men who can't see through me but I would put my salvation in Christ by obeying His commands and asking for His Holy Spirit. Remember nobody can enter through the Kingdom of God without being born of the water and of the Spirit(John 3:5). Jesus's words are Spirit and Life(John 6:63), His commands are not optional, fools who hear His words and do not act on them will collapse(Matthew 7:27), faith alone won't keep a fool from collapsing(Faith without love is worthless, loving Jesus and obeying His words will lead to eternal life and you cannot receive the Spirit of truth if you don't keep His Commands(John 14:15))\n\nLove is above all.\n\nIf I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 2 If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 3 If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast,[b] but do not have love, I gain nothing.1 corinthians 13\n\nKeeping Jesus's commands(not faith alone) lead to you receiving the Spirit of Truth\n\nIf you love Me, you will keep My commandments. 16And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Advocate to be with you forever— 17the Spirit of truth. The world cannot receive Him, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. But you do know Him, for He abides with you and will be in you John 14:15\n\n2.External signs: There can be external signs when people receive the Holy Spirit. Speaking in tongues is one of them(acts 10:46),external signs like the dove coming down from heaven and resting on Jesus(John 1:32), tongues like flames of fire(Acts 2:3).\n\nWhile Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard his message. All the circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. For they heard them speaking in tongues and exalting God. Then Peter said, “Can anyone withhold the water to baptize these people? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have!\"So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for a few days. Acts 10:44\n\nCan't people see that being born of the Spirit goes hands in hands with baptism? Do you notice what Peter say \"Can anyone withhold the water to baptize these people? \", if those guys were saved through faith alone, why did God give them the Holy Spirit(notice the external signs that show that you received the Holy Spirit)? and why did Peter insisted on baptizing them, if baptism is optional? Faith alone isn't enough, if it was enough, those gentiles wouldn't have received the Holy Spirit and Peter wouldn't have insisted on baptizing them.\n\nAgain, how can a pastor see that the Holy Spirit fell on you or is in you? If you do not feel anything, nothing probably happened. But if you want to be really sure if you have the Holy Spirit, ask Jesus and He will reveal it to you, He is the One who sends the Spirit(John 15:26) on his beloved servants.\n\nWhen the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father— the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father— He will testify about Me. And you also must testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning. John 15:26\n\nConclusion:\n\n*Baptism(being born of water)is not optional, Jesus ordained his disciple to go to all the nations baptizing people(Matthew 28:19), He Himself was baptized(Matthew 13:15) and His disciples were baptizing people(which means they were baptized, anyone who isn't baptized, can not baptize[John 4:2]),if you think you are above your Master, you are deceiving yourself, if you think that faith alone trump Jesus's commands you are deceiving yourself. Again, what is so hard about letting yourself get baptized? Why do people grumble about it and invent hurdles that do not exist?\n\n*Receiving the Holy Spirit: If you receive the Holy Spirit, you will know it through internal signs(How can anyone receive the Spirit of God in Him and not feel it?) and through external signs(speaking in tongues, prophesying and more). Remember your pastors can't see in you, he can't tell if you have the Spirit or not, he might see those miraculous signs as you see them but if it happens internally, he won't know it but you will know.\n\nReferences\n\nBeing born of water and Spirit:\n\nJesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. John 3:5\n\nHaving faith by loving Jesus\n\nWhoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them.” John 14:21\n\nBeing born of the Spirit by having the Spirit in you\n\n\"While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard his message. All the circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. For they heard them speaking in tongues and exalting God.\"Acts 10:44\n\nJesus replied, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make Our home with him. John 14:23\n\nthe Spirit of truth. The world cannot receive Him, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. But you do know Him, for He abides with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. John 14:17\n\nAnd if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. Romans 8:9\n\nBeing born of water by getting baptized\n\nBut John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?”Let it be so now,” Jesus replied. “It is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness in this way.” Then John permitted Him. As soon as Jesus was baptized, He went up out of the water. Suddenly the heavens were opened, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and resting on Him. Matthew 3:15\n\nWhen Jesus realized that the Pharisees were aware that He was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John(although it was not Jesus who baptized, but His disciples), He left Judea and returned to Galilee. John 4:2\n\nTherefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age. Matthew 28:19\n\nWhile Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard his message.All the circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. For they heard them speaking in tongues and exalting God. Then Peter said,“Can anyone withhold the water to baptize these people? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have!”So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for a few days. Acts 10:44\n\nNot listening to Jesus's words(E.g: Refusing to get baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit)\n\n“Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.” Matthew 7:24\n\nHmmm, I wonder what His words are?\n\nBut John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?”Let it be so now,” Jesus replied. “It is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness in this way.”\n\nTherefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” Matthew 28:19\n\nEphesians 2:4-9 says:\n\nBut God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. (NASB)\n\nJohn 3:1-5, we see this:\n\nNow there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews; this man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.” Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.” Nicodemus *said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?” Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. (NASB)\n\nHow do the above two verses correlate with one another in teaching, and why did Jesus say what He did in the Gospel of John if it is only by our faith in Him that allows us to enter into Heaven?\n\nThe confusion seems to be in interpreting the second passage to be teaching that faith plus baptism in water (a work) is required for salvation.\n\nTo answer you, salvation requires only belief. The works SHOW you believe.\n\nIt all goes back to the question of how people are saved. Salvation is given to people who are loyal to God, faithful. Israel was a beneficiary of the covenant God made with Abraham in which all the descendants of Abraham world be blessings to the world. At that point of time all she had to do was believe Abraham's descendants would be having the privilege of being blessings to the world. That was the only condition. Israel was worried about being destroyed by God because of transgression, infraction, sin, so she asked for a covenant which offered protection in return for work. So the Sinaitic covenant was added to the Abrahamic covenant, but it did not abolish it.\n\nLet's see what the situation became. Originally, God gave Israel the gift of being blessings to the world, Israel being people who believed God's promise to bless those who so believed. Insecure Israel asked for a different arrangement: God should spare those who performed visible works.\n\nSince nobody performed all the works, all were deserving of death. Of these condemned group, some unilaterally twisted the requirements to be saved, limiting it to just tithing mint and cumin and other superficial observations, deciding on their own that God never really meant what he said, repeating the sin of Eve:\n\nGen 3:1Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, \"Indeed, has God said, 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden '?\"\n\nThe remnant believed all 613 were required and tried to observe them. In other words the first group were not faithful, while the second group observed the hybrid Sinaitic Abrahamic covenant, which required Israel to believe God wanted all works to be observed. Those who did all works would live by them, those who believed all works were required would be saved by that belief.\n\nIt's obvious that only the second group was saved. Whenever the wrath of God came upon Israel as a result of covenant infraction, the remnant were always spared. They were not saved by compliance, other wise salvation would have been by works. They were saved by grace, the favour of God towards those who believed His word was true.\n\nI repeat: how were the remnant saved? By believing all the law had to be observed. How did they show they believed? By trying to observe all the law.\n\nThis explains why John refused baptism to those who did not show acts reflecting change of mind from not believing God to believing God. Those who did change mind, meta noia-ed, repented, were baptised. Their baptism was a recognition of their hating the world system and believing God wanted them to live by His law. Like Noah. Like Israel. The baptism picturised the waters closing worldly life behind them. That is why it is called born of water. They agreed with what the water symbolised, hatred of the world.\n\nJohn offered salvation from God's wrath. Jesus offered salvation from eternal death. John taught his disciples to believe Jesus to be the one through whom the revelation of eternal life, the ability to be blessings to the world, would come. Those who did believe were baptised in the name of Jesus. They received the Holy Spirit which taught them that becoming blessings to the world could be fulfilled by giving up all they possessed, rejection of depending on the world. People who believed were called born of the Spirit.\n\nI repeat: baptism in Jesus's name leads to the giving of the Holy Spirit which teaches believers must give up all their possessions to become blessings to the world.\n\nThose who believe were called born of the Holy Spirit.\n\nWe need to be born both of the water and, a stronger commitment, of the Spirit too, to become blessings to the world. We must have belief in the requirement, and have acts to show that belief.\n\nAll Scripture from the NASB."
