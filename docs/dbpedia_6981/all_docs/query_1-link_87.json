        "text": "For the Grace Kelly Blogathon this year, I wanted to do something a bit special and review a recently published novel involving her called Meet me in Monaco by Hazel Gaynor and Heather Webb.\n\nI was a bit skeptical about reading the book, as I didn’t particularly enjoy Ms. Gaynor’s novel, The Girl from the Savoy but there was something that magnetized me into reading this novel: The presence of Grace Kelly.\n\nMeet me in Monaco is set against the 1950s French Riviera. Our main character Sophie is a perfumer who learned the trade from her beloved, but deceased father, while the leading man is James (Jim) Henderson, a British photographer who is re-adjusting to life after WWII. It’s a chance first meeting for Sophie and James when Grace Kelly hides in Sophie’s shop trying to evade the paparazzi- and it sets off a chain of events that connect these three characters for over 30 years.\n\nThe narrative in the book begins during the 1955 Cannes Film Festival with the main portion taking place during 1956 with Grace’s courtship and wedding to Prince Rainier. Grace fans are in for a real treat as several things are mentioned that her fans will get a kick out of: her dog Oliver (a gift from Mr Cary Grant!), her taste in French perfume, the first meeting of Rainier, and even the voyage to Monaco. However, readers will also come to love the fictional characters in this novel that really drive the romance plot. James to me, in my view of fictional characters, is the dream guy- a British photographer who’s a romantic at heart. He’s a WWII vet and there’s a bit of a backstory with that along with his ex-wife, Marjorie, and his daughter whom he adores (Her name is Emily- so personally, that was awesome). Sophie was also a likable character and someone you can identify with; I just wish she would have been more courageous at making some business decisions. However, what I enjoyed most about her was that she always kept her father’s memory alive- it was sweet that whenever she was down, she always remembered his advice.\n\nWhat makes this book believable is the focus is not on Grace Kelly. We are not getting the inside details of her voyage to Monaco or her wedding plans, rather we are hearing about it through the perspective of the main characters. This style of writing makes Grace’s presence very real. Because she only pops up in person about 4 times, the reader becomes just as excited to see her as James and Sophie do. Its really fun too because there are some passages that appear in letter or telegram style. There’s even a few magazine and newpaper sections written in the book, and that makes it really authentic.\n\nSLIGHT SPOILER: The one problem I have with the novel is the 26 year time jump. There are so many questions that never get answered because of this, and it makes the ultimate ending feel short changed.\n\nMeet me in Monaco was given a bunch of accolades this year with a reviewer calling it a “French bon-bon of a book”. I can’t say I argue and even if your not into “lite” historical fiction books, you can appreciate the Grace Kelly connection. It’s a very breezy read and just an overall cute book!\n\nClick here to go to the Author’s website and learn more about the book!\n\nBe sure to check out my co-hosts pages of Day 2 and Day 3 and check out Day 1 of the Grace Kelly Blogathon! I want to thank Ginnie for hosting and coming up with this marvelous event! I am always happy to be invited to co-host with you! To Samantha- It was so fun joining you this year for this event! I love being part of this with you two fabulous ladies and I say it every year, but I truly believe Grace Kelly would be flattered with all of the love!!\n\nAnd to all my readers and fellow writers- Thanks again so much for participating. Without the audience there is no reason for me to write- you all keep me going!!!\n\nThe year 1929 was a stand out year in world history. Prohibition was still on, flappers were dancing, and silent movies were waning as talkies were rising. Not only was it the end to a roaring decade, it also saw the birth of some of the most prominent woman in the world: Audrey Hepburn, the future Jacqueline Kennedy, and of course the dazzling actress-turned- princess, Grace Kelly.\n\nThis year Grace would have been 90 years old, and one has to wonder: what would she be like today? Its hard to think of Grace being, “an old lady”, as of course she would have still been a serene woman. But I think being a doting grandmother; and now, great-grandmother would have been most important to her.\n\nTo celebrate Grace’s 90th birthday: Ginnie (The Wonderful World of Cinema), Samantha (Musings of a Classic Film Addict) and I (Emily; The Flapper Dame) have decided to bring back the Wonderful Grace Kelly Blogathon for its fifth year.\n\nThe rules and guidelines are the same as last year, but here they are again as a refresher:\n\n– You can write about any topic relating to Grace- her movies, Hollywood relations/ friendships, collaborations with Hitchcock and Edith Head, her time as Princess of Monaco, her family- possibilities are endless- just make sure Grace is the center of the topic (naturally!)\n\n-The blogathon will run November 10-12, 2019\n\n-Duplicates are allowed, since her filmography is only 11 movies!\n\n-Blog posts must be new material\n\n-Maximum of 2 entries per person\n\n-You CAN participate if you don’t have a blog- a guest post is acceptable!\n\nand REMEMBER\n\n1– Don’t participate if you don’t like Grace Kelly- in the past, Ginnie had participants who BASHED Grace- that’s not acceptable! AND\n\n2- If you want to participate, YOU MUST subscribe first.\n\nYou can subscribe to to the. Blogathon with Ginnie, Samantha, or me on Twitter or by email- just let us know and we will mark you down!\n\nTHE ROSTER AS FOLLOWS\n\nThe Flapper Dame: The Bridges at Toko- Ri (1954) and Review of the Novel Meet Me in Monaco by Hazel Gaynor and Heather Webb\n\nThe Wonderful World of Cinema writing for Three Enchanting Ladies : TBD\n\nMusings of a Classic Film Addict : Grace‘s Ratatouille Nicoise\n\nPoppity Talks Classic Film– Personal Tribute\n\nThe Stop Button – The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954)\n\nScreen Dreams – To Catch a Thief (1955)\n\nPale Writer – Grace Kelly and Alfred Hitchcock’s Collaborations\n\nThoughts All Sort – Rear Window (1954)\n\nDown These Mean Streets – Rear Window (1954)\n\n4 Star Films – Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly part II\n\nRearl Weegie Midget Reviews – Dial M for Murder (1954)\n\nCrítica Retrô – Grace Kelly Interviews\n\nOverture Books And Film – The Country Girl (1954)\n\nThe Classic Movie Muse- High Society\n\nCan’t wait to hear your choices as we celebrate 90 years of this remarkable woman!! Be sure to grab a delightfully cool banner designed by Ginnie (they turned out to be absolutely alluring, Ginnie!)\n\nThis year for the Grace Kelly Blogathon Day 2 I made the daunting decision to write up on Alfred Hitchcock’s Rear Window (1954)– which is arguably not only The Master’s best film, but also Grace’s best role.\n\nBut before I get into some of the technicalities, I will say that instead of giving a boring bloated analysis of it- Id like to focus on some of the stand out pieces that I feel make the picture brilliant\n\nGrace plays Lisa Carol Fremont in this role- a model and independent woman. Her boyfriend is a photographer LB “Jeff” Jefferies (maybe that’s how they met!) played by Jimmy Stewart. Jeff breaks his leg and is holed up in his apartment with nothing to do but stare out and “spy” on his neighbors. Its all people watching until one night he suspects his neighbor Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) murders his wife. Jeff, Lisa, along with Jeff’s nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), then investigate the truth.\n\nOne element that I feel goes overlooked is the scene in which Lisa turns on the lights and introduces herself to the audience. Everyone focuses on her kiss entrance scene- but the scene that follows is just as brilliant.\n\nLisa goes over and turns on three lights- and with each light says a part of her name. But note the framing- the first light, Lisa- the camera is a close up; the second light, Carol- its a medium shot- and finally the third light, Fremont, the camera zooms out to a long shot in which we get to see her gorgeous black and white frock.\n\nIts pieces like this in which I feel Hitchcock’s tiniest details of framing and dialogue go great with each other. And Grace- she’s the only actress who could make an entrance as simple as this super sophisticated and elegant.\n\nAnother element in this movie that I feel may be under rated is Hitchcock’s use of sound. Except for the opening credits, all sound in this film is diegetic sound. Its an interesting choice for Hitch, as usually his soundtrack scores are a key focus of his films. Take a look at the intro to the film (don’t worry no spoilers)\n\nI’m not a fan of Jazz- but there is something so infectious about this piece of music that sets the scene for the film. You automatically thing New York, the 50s, glamour, but business of the city. Also note how in the title sequence there are shades opening almost as if the audience is the voyeur for this picture.\n\nNext- lets talk about the under rated and often taken for granted set of this movie- its a whole neighborhood in a sound stage- and that’s something you rarely see anymore (as its too expensive!). This is a set with no green screen, or digital apartments- they are really there and they are built. From what I know- they used two sound stages and the apartments were the street level while places like the courtyard were actually the basement.\n\nAll apartments were made livable, and Hitchcock would give direction through an earpiece that all the actors had. Watch the video for the opening scene of the neighborhood and courtyard- just mind blowing on how that was all created!!\n\nFinally- Lets discuss Grace Kelly in this movie!! This is her ultimate glamour role, her ultimate Hitchcock role and her most well known role. I feel only she could be Lisa Carol Fremont and if someone else like Vera Miles or Kim Novak would have played the role- this picture would not have been as believable or memorable. Lisa Fremont is so proactive, more than just the “girlfriend”and sidekick- as she’s the one doing the action scenes that Jeff can’t. I believe Hitch spent the rest of his career trying to find another actress to create a role such as this- but naturally and utterly failed, finding good, but somewhat sub-parr actresses for big roles in his pictures. Its so easy to take for granted how phenomenal Grace is in this role!!!\n\nIn Sept 2017 (the day of Grace’s death) I had the pleasure of viewing Rear Window on the big screen and I can say that it absolutely changes your experience. Seeing every moment play out on the big screen makes it all more thrilling and dazzling.\n\nClick here to read a post I did concerning the fashions of Rear Window.\n\nTo Grace I will say that on this happiest day her birthday-I hope we can all pay her a great tribute, and I hope she is thrilled and perhaps touched that there are so many young people who still adore her and her movies!\n\nIts that time of year again everyone!! Its time to celebrate the Wonderful Grace Kelly- with a Wonderful Blogaton hosted by my fellow Grace enthusiast at The Wonderful World of Cinema- First off Ginnie, as always, thanks for hosting to honor our amazing Gracie!!\n\nThis year- I’ve decided to do a personal post about why I just love Grace Kelly- as an actress, princess and as a person. To the wider world of classic Hollywood- Grace is a small snippet. She only made 11 movies and was in films only from 1951-1956. She doesn’t have longevity in the business nor did she have a wide ‘acting career’- However Grace had Talent. Style. Class- all things that most actors either had to A- fake or B- had to work a long time to achieve- Grace had all of that and more straight from the get go. The fact she was a top star, worked with some of the most dazzling leading men, was directed by the master of suspense, and won an Oscar- all within a mere 5 years is amazing and unbelievable- I mean who else worked with all of these handsome men- Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Gary Cooper, Clark Gable, and William Holden? Someone like Bette Davis was in tinsel town for decades and never even worked with all of them!!\n\nAs an actress Grace was great in all her roles even if the picture was forgettable (a la– Green Fire) she wasn’t- she gave her best with what she had- and she had a natural ability to make the audience interested in her character and what she was doing.\n\nI often wonder what would have happened if Grace continued her career- what would have Marnie been like with her in the lead? Or The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) – would Kim Novak still been cast in Vertigo? Would we have seen Grace in more comedic roles? I’m not sure what would have happened in any of these situations- but one thing’s for sure is that Grace did leave Hollywood at the peak of her popularity- and had she stayed -I believe she would have kept favor with the audience- maybe yes she would have had a flop or two- but I think she would have remained popular and positive in people’s minds. I even think she could have been a great broadway star given that theater was her first love- perhaps a Tony could have been in her future.\n\nOn the other hand- I do believe Grace was the most marvelous princess. She cared so much about her new adopted country yet she never lost touch with her American roots- she pushed Monaco into the 20th century and put it on the map for the world to see. She was really the first Cinderella story before Diana and before Kate. I only do wish she would have found a real way to return to her love of acting while still maintaining her image of Princess Grace.\n\nMaybe the best part of what remained in her life in Monaco was her ever constant style- to me Grace seemed like one to never follow fads- she knew what she liked, and she knew what types of clothes worked for her and she stuck with it- and for that – she never looks dated. On a personal level- I believe that is the ultimate secret to being a fashion icon- and that is what I go by when I put together outfits or go clothes shopping.\n\nToday Grace has been gone for 35 years- yet I think she’s more well known now more than ever. To me Grace Kelly’s style and mannerisms are what the world lacks today. In my own life I don’t try to ‘Be’ Grace Kelly- that’s impossible- but what I do try to do is follow her example- and remember what it means to be classy like her.\n\nIn her final interview Grace expressed her wish to be remembered as “a kind and loving person” and I think that’s just how she remains in the hearts and minds of people today. I certainly see her that way and I think you all do too!\n\nHappy Birthday Dear Grace! You may be gone, but you are never forgotten!\n\nA lot of you who read my blog may know that I love Grace Kelly– as not only is she a princess and an old Hollywood actress, but she is also lovely, wonderful, classy, elegant, serene, and one of the most magnificent ladies ever to walk the earth. For every great lady, there is a designer for whom they act as a muse to. For Grace Kelly, that designer was none other than the talented and gifted Edith Head. So when it came time to do a Blogathon hosted by Christina (over at her awesome blog) about character costumes, I had to participate to write about Grace and Edith!!\n\nYes, Edith Head dressed practically everyone in Hollywood during her amazing and impressive career, but to me, Grace and Edith together is the definition of “designer and client.” They go together just like The Duchess of Cambridge and Alexander McQueen or Audrey Hepburn and Herbert de Givenchy.\n\nAlthough Grace wore her most famous outfit (her wedding dress!) by the MGM designer Helen Rose no one knew how to dress Grace better than Edith. Ms. Head designed the wardrobe for Grace in two of her Hitchcock films (which were her best performances!) as well as The Country Girl and The Bridges at Toko-Ri.\n\nIn Rear Window, Grace’s character Lisa Carol Freemont wears this amazing black and white chiffon number- and even today, its stylish- the heels, the A-Line skirt, and the top and bottom design that is made to look like two separate pieces- it’s absolutely timeless.\n\nAnother outfit I just adore to death is the Black dress in Rear Window– again timeless, and it may not be flashy but it doesn’t need to be! It’s simple, yet extremely stylish- its my definition of a little black dress.\n\nAnd finally my other favorite from Rear Window is the printed dress Grace wears while examining Thorwald’s apartment. It’s an unusual dress Edith designed as she normally chose not to use prints for fear of the print becoming aged as people looked back on it, but yet again, Edith proved her eye for style, for it hasn’t aged a day- it’s fabulous!!!\n\nIn To Catch a Thief, Edith perfectly matched Grace’s (well Frances Stevens!) eyes in this wonderful blue gown. However, the real eye catching winner in my view was definitely the white ensemble (I do realize the gold ball gown is the favorite of many but I believe it’s this white one that does it for me!)\n\nAide from the movies, Edith also designed some wonderful personal outfits for Grace including her legendary teal Oscar dress, as well as her suit she wore when departing for her honeymoon.\n\nOnce Grace left for Monaco, the two did stay close as evidenced by this picture below (thanks to Grace and family Tumblr, left and Oscars.org, right)\n\nThanks for Oscars.org there is also this darling note from Grace to Edith!\n\nHas there ever been a more charming friendship between an actress and designer? I think not!\n\nThis entry is part of “The Wonderful Grace Kelly Blogathon” hosted by Virginie at “The Wonderful World of Cinema”. I would personally like to thank her for allowing me to participate at such short notice. This is officially my first blogathon- I entered at the last minute- its Grace Kelly, my favorite actress so I couldn’t let it pass me by! For me, Mogambo was the second Grace Kelly picture I saw, and I watched for the first time on my 17th Birthday.\n\nMogambo… what is Mogambo? According to the trailer, Mogambo means “The Greatest”. And maybe that’s because MGM really had the “greatest” elements going for the film- Technicolor, location shoot, and the “greatest” actor in all of Hollywood, the king of himself, Mr. Clark Gable. Of course, MGM also had the “greatest” source material for the picture, as Mogambo was to be a remake of their own 1932 Jean Harlow pre-code Red Dust (which also had Gable as the leading man- Only Gable can replace Gable folks, even if its twenty years later!)\n\nLike its predecessor, Mogambo was to have the same plot- two women (one married, one single) vying for the affections of Clark Gable in an exotic location- but instead of taking place on an Indochina rubber plantation, Mogambo was to be set in the African jungle. To cast the female leads, MGM turned to some of Gable’s former co-stars: Ava Gardner, who had previously worked with Gable on both The Hucksters and Lone Star; and Gene Tierney, his leading lady from Never Let Me Go. With Gable, Gardner, Tierney and veteran western/ action director John Ford all attached, Mogambo was set to be a smash even before it hit the big screen.\n\nSo how does the wonderful Grace Kelly fit in of this? It actually turned out to be a twist of fate, as right before filming began, Gene Tierney dropped out due to illness. Needing to find a new actress for the part, John Ford went to MGM executives and showed them Grace’s 1950 screen test from the film Taxi. Of her test, Ford said Ms. Kelly had “Breeding, Quality and Class” (I agree Mr. Ford, I agree!!!)\n\nAt the time Grace only had two films to her name, (14 Hours and High Noon) but MGM execs clearly agreed with Ford when they offered her the role of Linda Nordley (the married woman; Donald Sinden played her husband), as well as the traditional 7 year studio contract. Grace accepted, but careful as ever, signed on the conditions that A– she was able to live in New York and B– every two years she could get time off to work in the theater.\n\nFilming took place from Fall 1952- Winter 1953. During the duration of the shoot, Grace naturally got along with all her co-stars (she found a life-long friend in Ava Gardner; with Clark, while on location, she joined him on hunting trips ) and even impressed everyone at dinner one night by ordering in Swahili! On the downside, behind the scenes, there were also some problems- Frank Sinatra and Ava’s deteriorating marriage (and her abortion during a filming break), Ford’s nasty treatment to all the stars, and of course the alleged “affair” between Gable and Grace.\n\nIn the end, however, Grace’s hard work prevailed, as was she was nominated both for a Golden Globe and an Oscar with both noms in the category of Best Supporting Actress. I think Grace gave a good performance and her character proves glamour can exist even in the most un-glamourous of places. Her scenes with Gable and Gardner are well acted and it’s easy to believe she’s falling for Gable, even though she’s a married woman. The costumes are also wonderful as Helen Rose made Grace to be “Safari Chic”.\n\nToday, Mogambo may not be regarded as a “classic” classic, however, it still is a fan favorite and is considered by many to be John Ford’s most under rated work. I think Grace herself summed it up well as to why we still watch the film today, when she later said,“Mogambo had three things that interested me-John Ford, Clark Gable, and a trip to Africa.”\n\n(photo- DVD Beaver)\n\nWhat I like about Mogambo is even though it’s a re-make- it’s a good one that’s worth watching. It’s different to Red Dust and is not a shot by shot, word for word re-make. The film also has nice parallel between Grace and Mr. Gable, in regards to their careers- his last real success and a breakout performance for her. My favorite scene has to be the lake scene with Clark, Grace, and their embrace- it’s just so pretty and it’s really the moment Grace’s character falls for Clark’s (seriously who can blame Grace!!)\n\nAfter all everyone, with talent like that Mogambo truly is “The Greatest”!\n\nSources\n\nSpoto, Donald.
