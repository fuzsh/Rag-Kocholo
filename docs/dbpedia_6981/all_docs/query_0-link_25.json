        "text": "If you have chosen Germany as your next destination, whether for your profession, education, exchange programs, or simply a brief holiday, this article is for you. Aside from carefully picking locations to stay or visit, dressing appropriately for the season, and making a grocery list, another important step would be to learn to speak German.\n\nWith over 15 million learners globally, German is one of the top four foreign languages, after English, French, and Mandarin. Assuming you want to study German and you stay in Nagpur, the best approach is to enroll in German-language classes in Nagpur.\n\nYou may enhance your German abilities just by viewing German films. It will help you comprehend how words are pronounced and will also help you improve your listening abilities. Only German movies can teach you about German culture and tragedies. There are several masterpieces in German cinema.\n\nFrom Goodbye, Lenin! to The Lives of Others, we've selected some of the finest German films of the last century. Laugh Gala screened as part of the BFI London Film Festival since its Cannes premiere in 2016. It has been a favorite of audiences and critics alike since its premiere at Cannes in 2016.\n\nGerman and European film awards named it the best film of 2016 and Sight & Sound magazine. In addition, the film won the Oscar for best foreign-language picture.\n\nWhile everyone has labeled Ade's picture as a comedy, it is also a tremendously detailed character study of a father and his attempts to reclaim his estranged daughter's love. It will make you laugh (guaranteed), but it will also make you think as it raises profound concerns about the pursuit of happiness and, yes, the purpose of life.\n\nIt's a dramatic film about the generation of 1968 and their capitalist children. As its director pointed out in an interview, it's not a comedy but a film about humor.\n\nGet the most recent news from the BFI. Subscribe to BFI news, features, videos, and podcasts. Her second film, Everyone Else (2009), tragically never distributed in the UK, propelled Ade to the forefront of the emerging generation of daring and diverse German filmmakers.\n\nIn the recent history of German films that have achieved international acclaim, most directors have been men. I would also mention Nicolette Krebitz, Anne Zohra Berrached, Sonja Heiss, and Maria Schrader as other interesting modern female directors. However, many of their best works are still unavailable in the UK.\n\nWith Toni Erdmann now accessible to watch online on BFI Player, 10 of the best German films have been made since the millennium's turn.\n\n1. Farewell, Lenin! (2003)\n\nWolfgang Becker is the director.\n\nLenin, farewell! (2003) This tragicomedy by filmmaker Wolfgang Becker was a significant hit in Germany and the English-speaking world early this century. It's the moving story of a young man (Daniel Brühl in his breakout performance) growing up in East Berlin whose socialist mother has a heart attack and falls into a coma.\n\nWhile she remains unconscious, political events accelerate:\n\nThe Berlin Wall is down.\n\nThe East German government was demolished.\n\nCapitalism invades the west.\n\nAlex resolves to keep the vital news a secret to not cause any worry for his mother when she wakes up.\n\nHe and his sister pretend that nothing has occurred, and they embark on an odd attempt to keep the GDR alive within the four walls of their flat, complete with TV news and food.\n\nBecker creates an intricate and amusing hoax around the breakdown of socialism, cleverly mixing a parody of the communist state with the narrative of a boy's love for his mother.\n\n2. Front-on (2004)\n\nFatih Akin is the director. Akin, Fatih\n\nHead-on was the first German film in 18 years to win the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival, and its victory marked a significant step forward in the growth of German auteur filmmaking.\n\nAs a second-generation German immigrant born to Turkish parents, Akin frequently discusses issues of ethnic identity and has become a voice for second-generation immigrants in Germany.\n\nHe created a picture that, in many ways, lives up to its title, Head-on. Cahit and Sibel had both tried suicide when they met in a mental ward in Hamburg. After learning that Cahit is also of Turkish descent, Sibel asks him to join her in a marriage of convenience to escape her strict Muslim family.\n\nFalse sentiments gradually become true, but their love tale will collapse. Akin provides an emotionally powerful and graphically explicit experience in this raw, slightly harsh, highly provocative picture. Rather than giving answers, he exposes issues of identity and cultural preconceptions.\n\n3. The Edukators (2004)\n\nHans Weingartner is the director.\n\nEducators are educators (2004). This striking film on generational conflict focused on young people who uniquely challenge capitalism. Jan, Peter, and Jule steal into wealthy people's homes while the owners are away, meticulously rearranging their belongings and leaving a letter indicating that their days of luxury are numbered.\n\nThey had no choice but to abduct the homeowner when they were caught in the act. The gradual disintegration of their ideological worldview begins. Hans Weingartner, a former activist, shoots with a handheld camera and asks how fear might limit freedom.\n\nWeingartner adds a fun dimension to a contentious matter by teaching the imagined adversaries. The film features two of Germany's most considerable talents, Daniel Brühl and Matthias Schoenaerts. Jentsch, Julia The Edukators became a cult picture\n\nfor a new political generation after being the first German film in 11 years to debut in competition at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe Edukators are available on BFI Player.\n\n4. Requiem (2006)\n\nHans-Christian Schmid is the director.\n\nCrazy (2000), a coming-of-age picture about friendship and falling in love, and Distant Lights (2003), about life on the German-Polish border, have established Hans-Christian Schmid as one of the great German storytellers of recent times.\n\nHe has a rare ability to blend the symbolic with the actual. He concentrates on the implications of religious fanaticism and exorcism in Requiem.\n\nIn another outstanding performance, Michaela (Toni Erdmann as Sandra Hüller in another exceptional performance) grew up in a strongly religious home. She found herself divided between two worlds when she departed for university. Following a mental breakdown, a priest confirms her belief that demons possess her.\n\nHans-Christian Schmid portrays Michaela's horrific tragedy with stunning realism. This movie is a compelling and frightening drama as it tells the story of a woman trying to find her place in a morally ambiguous society. There is never a dull moment in this movie.\n\n5. Other People's Lives (2006)\n\nFlorian Henckel von Donnersmarck is the director.\n\nOther People's Lives (2006) Winning the Oscar for the best foreign picture with a first feature is impressive, but so is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's GDR-set spy thriller centered on a famous couple from the theatre world.\n\nVon Donnersmarck's film on morality, love, and trust in times of surveillance leads the audience progressively more profound into a spiral of ethical issues from which it is difficult, if not impossible, to escape. We see a slow change from faithful regime follower to the human being as we accompany Stasi commissar Wiesler as he immerses himself in \"the life of others\" — a transition that questions our ordinary conception of good and evil.\n\nVon Donnersmarck assembled an extraordinary group of skilled performers straight out of film school, and the result is a tremendously riveting thriller of dramatic and psychological depth, one that is equally demanding of our emotions and brains.\n\n6. Pina (2011)\n\nWim Wenders is the director.\n\nThis video is a tribute to the late Pina Bausch, the famous German choreographer who revolutionized the nature of live performance with her combination of dance and theatre. When she died unexpectedly soon before production began, Wim Wenders persuaded her cast that there was an even greater urgency to finish the project.\n\nHe blends performances and interviews on and off stage in the documentary, taking the audience on a visually spectacular trip. Although the story behind her choreography isn't always evident, its feelings are so universal that we can all connect to them.\n\nWenders' picture, initially filmed in 3D, successfully generates an intimacy that draws you into a beautiful blend of dance, music, and cinema.\n\nThe ensemble will be performing live at Sadler's Wells in February 2017 if you enjoy this film.\n\n7. Stuck on the Track (2011)\n\nAndreas Dresen is the director.\n\nStopped on the Road (2011) Andreas Dresen is a filmmaker who prefers to take on issues that other filmmakers see as taboo. He did it in Cloud 9 (2008), a rather graphic and poignant film about senior sex, and he did it again in Stopped on Track, a film about dying.\n\nFrank's life appears to be on Track until he is diagnosed with a deadly brain tumor in his mid-40s and learns he only has a few months to live. We see the difficult days ahead in his family's house, and Dresen depicts every step of this sad journey.\n\nHe provides an agonizingly accurate representation of Frank's deterioration without a set screenplay and solely spontaneous dialogue. While dealing with a grim subject matter, this film celebrates life.\n\n8. A Cup of Coffee in Berlin (2012)\n\nJan-Ole Gerster is the director.\n\nA Cup of Coffee in Berlin (2012) Jan-Ole Gerster's debut film, A Coffee in Berlin, is shot in black and white and deals with the desire to participate in life and the challenge of finding one's position. It revolves around Niko, a late-twentysomething who dropped out of law school two years ago and lived each day as it came.\n\nWhen his father reduces his stipend, he is suddenly unable to afford a cup of excellent coffee. The film depicts Niko's aimless wandering across Berlin in episodic sequences, as he has a series of fortuitous contacts that have a lasting influence on his destiny.\n\nA Coffee in Berlin, effortlessly entertaining and with a jazz background, remarks on an entire generation just by watching this young man attempt to sort things out. This tragicomedy about millennials was an unexpected triumph at the 2013 German Picture Honors, earning six awards, including best film and best director.\n\n9. Barbara (nine) (2012)\n\nChristian Petzold is the director. Petzold, Christian\n\none of Germany's most acclaimed directors is a master at dramatizing human quandaries and emotional betrayals. Barbara (Nina Hoss, who appears in most of his films), a doctor, adjusts to her new existence in the East German countryside, where she was sent as punishment in the summer of 1980.\n\nPetzold's fascination with society's boundaries and his characters' ambiguous circumstances keep the audience in the dark throughout the majority of the film as to what the offender's offense may have been. On the other hand, Barbara isolates herself from any social engagement that is not strictly professional. André (Ronald Zehrfeld) is her new employer who piques her interest. Are her intrigues misconstrued as affection?\n\nPetzold masterfully crafts a narrative of trust and distrust under the continual observation of East Germany's secret police, intertwined with a love story — or two.\n\nHe received the Berlin Film Festival's best director award, and Barbara represented Germany in the 2012 foreign-language Oscar competition. Phoenix (2014), Petzold's similarly brilliant follow-up, is available to watch on BFI Player.\n\n10. Victoria (2015)\n\nSebastian Schipper is the director. Mr. Sebastian Schipper,\n\nWith this audacious, absolutely compelling thriller, actor-turned-director pulled off a coup: he shot the entire film in one unbroken take. When Victoria (Laia Costa), a Spanish classical pianist, meets Sonne and his friends outside a bar in the early hours, she is curious about what else Berlin has to offer.\n\nWhat begins as a flirting late-night excursion quickly escalates out of control as Schipper transports the audience on a thrilling journey through a city that never sleeps.\n\nBased on a 12-page script and wholly improvised dialogue, Schipper abandons the traditional and subverts the director's role: once the camera rolled, the performers were entirely in command."
