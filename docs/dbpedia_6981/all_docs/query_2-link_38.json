        "text": "#10: Eau de Nil Suit\n\n“Rear Window” (1954)\n\nThe eau de nil suit worn by Kelly’s character in “Rear Window” has to be one of the most iconic moments a skirt suit has ever had on film. Lisa Carol Fremont shows up to the main character’s house wearing this impeccably tailored green skirt suit with a white silk halter neck shirt. The accessories are really what take this outfit over the top, from the pearl necklace to the white pillbox hat and veil making it appear oh so expensive. The look was created by the acclaimed costume designer Edith Head, who later used a similar eau de nil suit on Tippi Hedren for another Hitchcock movie, “The Birds.”\n\n#9: Black & White Beachtop with Capris & Skirt\n\n“To Catch a Thief” (1955)\n\nNot many people can make beachwear look so refined, but most people don’t have this actress’ natural grace. Sporting a black halter swimsuit paired with rolled up capris and a full white skirt, this look could be worn poolside as well as in a fine dining establishment, giving the ensemble a sense of duality most outfits don’t have. And while the clothing itself is striking, it’s the wide-brimmed white hat over a black turban that takes the whole look to another level of chic that only Grace could carry. It’s a look that demands the attention of everyone in the room.\n\n#8: White Dress\n\n“To Catch a Thief” (1955)\n\nMany women tend to shy away from wearing all white since the color is notoriously unforgiving and runs the risk of looking like a bridal gown, but Grace Kelly looks like absolute perfection in this structured, white strapless gown. The woven bodice and slight sweetheart neckline give the gown some visual interest before the cinched waist billows out. The dress elongates her frame while the color gives a nice contrast to her golden skin and locks in “To Catch a Thief”. Finally, the diamond necklace elevates the look, and gives it a breathtaking effect.\n\n#7: Silk Nightgown\n\n“Rear Window” (1954)\n\nSleepwear isn’t usually cause for a major sartorial moment, but the silk nightgown Grace Kelly wears in “Rear Window” shows that you don’t have to look like a slob when going to bed. The gown’s deep V-neck cut and its tight waist show off her curves, while the floor-length skirt keeps the look modest. Paired with a see-through robe, the extra material gives it some movement that makes it perfect for twirling. Grace calls the look a “preview of a coming attractions,” which is a witty line of banter that a look like this deserves.\n\n#6: Embellished Tulle Dress\n\n“High Society” (1956)\n\nThis frock worn in “High Society” is a classic example of 1950s feminine style that will make any woman look timeless. In the film, Grace Kelly’s character wears the Helen Rose-designed gown after she drunkenly escapes her bachelorette party and runs into Frank Sinatra. He takes her into his arms and serenades her while they dance. Each twirl, spin, and dip shows off the beautiful shimmering gray gown. The sheer overlay with the silver flowers looks gorgeous in the lighting and the tulle of the skirt moves like a dream as she completes each step.\n\n#5: Black Dress\n\n“Rear Window” (1954)\n\nEvery woman needs a perfect little black dress and this ensemble in “Rear Window” is the perfect one to show off a shift in the film’s narrative when it gets a little darker and the characters start to believe they’ve witnessed a murder. It’s a little more dangerous and daring than the other looks Kelly wears in the film, while still keeping that same tailored look. The pleated organza is expertly done and adds visual interest to skirt. Meanwhile, the sheer cap sleeves and twisted knot in the bodice are the kind of little details that make the dress stand apart from other similar outfits.\n\n#4: Gold Dress\n\n“To Catch a Thief” (1955)\n\nBy the end of “To Catch a Thief,” the main characters must attend an elaborate masquerade ball. Many of the looks in the film are already so epic, but Edith Head outdid herself when she dressed Grace Kelly in this over-the-top Marie Antoinette-inspired gown. The costumes for this scene were some of the most extravagant Head ever made. The dress looked like a work of art with the 3-D detailing making it seem as though the butterflies could fly off the gown, with the fan and golden wig adding to the decadent feel.\n\n#3: Red Dress\n\n“Dial M for Murder” (1954)\n\nGrace Kelly was usually clothed in more subdued, lighter shades, but this red dress makes us wish we saw her in bolder colors all the time. In head-to-toe red from her lipstick to her dress to her shoes, she looked like a woman to be reckoned with in “Dial M for Murder.” The red lace of the gown was an exquisite touch for the back and sleeves, which made it appear so feminine and chic. The whole look screams the 1950s in the best possible way, which was a time when elegance was at its height.\n\n#2: Blue Dress\n\n“To Catch a Thief” (1955)\n\nEveryone knows that blondes look good in blue, but we didn’t know they could look quite as good as Grace Kelly does in this Grecian style ensemble. The sky blue dress is a feat of draping, a style that can look quite sloppy if not done correctly. But that’s definitely not the case with this gown, which makes Kelly look regal and in command whenever she’s on screen. All that material could easily have overpowered her if the balance wasn’t struck just right, but instead the chiffon frock is feminine and the fabric highlights her frame.\n\nBefore we unveil our number one pick, here are a few honorable mentions:\n\nBlue Dress\n\n“High Society” (1956)\n\nWedding Dress\n\n“High Society” (1956)\n\nYellow Swimsuit\n\n“To Catch a Thief” (1955)\n\n#1: Black & White Dress\n\n“Rear Window” (1954)\n\nGrace may have become real-life royalty later in life, but she already looked the part in this black and white evening gown seen in “Rear Window.” Edith Head did some of her best work when she concocted this look. The top is simple and streamlined, but the double-v of the bodice shows off her chest, back, and the elegant slope of her shoulders. The white chiffon and tulle skirt make her look like a modern ballerina, and the black leaf detailing gives the look some flair. Paired with white gloves, a pearl necklace, and a tulle wrap, it was a look fit for a queen."
