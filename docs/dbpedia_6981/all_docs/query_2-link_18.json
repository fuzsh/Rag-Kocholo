        "text": "Paris Zarcilla’s Raging Grace is a powerful, occasionally funny, and dark exploration of how whiteness impacts the lives of immigrants, particularly Filipino immigrants living in the United Kingdom.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Apr 7, 2024\n\nThe film is shrewdly directed, intelligent and entertaining, from a director who knows how to play his audience’s nerves like a piano, and its funny bone like an idiophone.\n\nFull Review | Mar 7, 2024\n\nThe story in Raging Grace gets a bit messy, and some of the acting is too stiff, but it's a genuinely unique horror movie that succeeds in offering many effective jump scares along with astute observations about immigrant exploitation.\n\nFull Review | Jan 3, 2024\n\nGrace is the film’s hidden ace — almost its mascot, playful and mischievous, with more to her than meets the eye.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Jan 2, 2024\n\nPeel back the cliches and there’s something interesting here: a gnawing sense of injustice and biting social commentary.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Dec 31, 2023\n\nZarcilla strains so hard to match the politics of the premise with the parameters of horror that he ends up diluting both — imagine Roma meets Poltergeist, or The Maid meets Insidious.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Dec 29, 2023\n\nZarcilla may have more ideas than this film can easily accommodate, or the viewer easily swallow, but he is a distinctly stylish and confident director to keep an eye on.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Dec 28, 2023\n\nThere is ingenuity here, and good acting, but the film for me feels flawed by its strained melodrama, an absence of scares and by a very odd scene of almost unreal, farcical absurdity.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Dec 27, 2023\n\nThe final act doesn’t quite hold together, but the overall intent is more than effective.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Dec 24, 2023\n\nThe horror films that hold the biggest, lasting cultural impact hold a mirror up to society, and Raging Grace (which understandably won several awards at SXSW this year) does it better than most.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 9/10 | Dec 20, 2023\n\nUsing elements from gothic horror, writer/director Paris Zarcilla gives us a film with tension, haunted house atmosphere and for some, a few jump scares while also addressing some socio-political themes head on.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Dec 17, 2023\n\nA strong central performance and relevant themes related to the hardships immigrants regularly confront will command your attention, even if the mystery at the center of the plot isn’t entirely satisfying.\n\nFull Review | Dec 12, 2023\n\nRaging Grace is a breath of fresh air and does things that are difficult to pull off in movie making, like showcasing a story that’s not often told, do it in an engaging and satisfying way...\n\nFull Review | Dec 9, 2023"
