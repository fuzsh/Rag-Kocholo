        "text": "That shift towards more human interfaces is even transforming the world of programming itself. Of all the intriguing new developments in artificial intelligence of the past few years, one of the most strikingâto anyone who has spent any time developing softwareâis the rise of or AI agents who can actually write functional code on their own. Instead of forcing you to learn the intricacies of a language like C++ or Python, the latest tools offer a radical new proposition: you simply tell the computer in ordinary language what you want your new program to doâcreate a to-do-list manager, re-create the classic video game Pongâand the AI agent will write the code for you automatically.\n\nGrace Hopperâs legacy lies in the simple fact that she made these remarkable new machines more human.\n\nProgramming âco-pilotsâ may be one of the hottest areas in AI research right now, but the underlying idea behind them belongs to a tradition that dates back more than 80 years to the very origins of the computer age. The central premise is that digital computers require layers of translation, converting human concepts and instructions into the underlying zeroes and ones that all digital computation depends on. A machine that can only âthinkâ in machine language is not nearly as powerful as a machine that can process and express itself in statements that resemble human languages. That idea seems almost obvious to us now, but it was a controversial proposition when it was first proposed by one of the most charismatic and influential figures in the early years of software: Grace Hopper. Her career involved a number of milestones in technological history; she programmed one of the very first computers ever made, and helped design one of the first programming languages. But more than anything else, Grace Hopperâs legacy lies in the simple fact that she made these remarkable new machines more human.\n\nâIt was no use trying to learn math,â she would tell her perplexed students when they complained that they were not taking an English composition course, âunless you can communicate it with other people.â\n\nIn the early 1940s, Hopper found herself increasingly bored with the routines of teaching and unsatisfied in her marriage. After the Japanese invaded Pearl Harbor, and the United States entered World War II, Hopper decided the time was right for a change. She parted ways with her husband and began plotting a scheme to be helpful to the war effort. One promising opening appeared in the middle of 1942, when Congress passed the Navy Womenâs Reserve Act, which opened up a range of non-combat positions in the Navy for female recruits.\n\nInitially, Hopper was rejected from the service for physiological reasons: she weighed only 105 pounds, a full 15 pounds below the Navyâs minimum for a woman of her height. But her brainpower ultimately secured her a special exemption. A new class of machines with odd names, like The Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, were suddenly becoming crucial to the war effort. These machines promised to perform complex calculations like logarithms and trigonometric functions, crucial for creating ballistic tables or solving engineering problems like the propagation of radio waves. But the machines were so new they lacked anything even resembling a manualânot to mention a customer support deskâand figuring out how to operate them required advanced mathematical skills. A math PhDâeven one that only weighed 105 poundsâcould be invaluable to the Allied cause. And that is how Navy Lieutenant Grace Hopper found herself assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University. There she would work on one of the very first computers ever made, the Mark I.\n\nLt. Hopper with her comrades from the Navy, 1944 or 1945. 15 pounds below the Navyâs minimum weight for a woman of her height but her brainpower secured her a special exemption.

It weighed almost five tons and featured 750,000 moving parts. The massive machineâs most noteworthy feature,â Beyer notes, âwas . The tape was pre-coded with step-by-step instructions that dictated the machineâs operation and guided it toward a solution without the need for further human intervention.â Those rolls of paper-tape instructions didnât look like much at the time: just a random-sequences of holes punched into a long roll of paper, like something you might have seen attached to a cash register. But they were a kind of signal from the future. Understanding how to structure those paper-tape instructions so that they elicited the desired behavior from the machine required an entirely new form of expertise, one that would soon become one of the most lucrative and influential skills in the world: programming.\n\nShe studied the machineâs blueprints and circuit diagrams, trying to build a mental model of the functions behind each switch and relay. Working closely with the Mark Iâs inventor, , and a colleague Richard Bloch, Hopper improvised a set of ingenious coding strategies to cajole the temperamental computer into generating reliable calculations. Because the Mark I was astonishingly slow by modern standardsâit could only execute three instructions per second, billions of times slower than the microprocessor in a modern smart-watchâHopper and Bloch were forced to invent techniques to maximize the efficiency of their programmed instructions. They began borrowing snippets of each otherâs code. âIf I needed a sine routine, angles less than five over four,â Hopper later recalled, âIâd call over Dick Bloch and say, âCan I copy your sine routine?ââ Over time the practice would develop into the now ubiquitous custom of shared software âlibraries,â where certain common functions can be easily inserted into a specific program without having to write every single instruction from scratch.\n\nEven in those early days, Hopperâs skills as a conceptual translator came in handy. A military officer would relay a new problem that required the Mark Iâs computational prowess to solve, but wouldnât be able to express the nature of the problem in the form of precise equations. âI learned languages of oceanography, of this whole business of minesweeping, of detonators, of proximity fuses, of biomedical stuff,â Hopper said in an interview. âWe had to learn their vocabularies in order to be able to run their problems.â The pressure was relentless. While they were far from the front lines, feeding paper-tapes into the whirring mechanical behemoth in Cambridge, Hopper knew that the calculations they were generating were translating directly into lives and deaths on the battlefield. There was little time to sit back and reflect on the technological revolution they were witnessing first-hand. âThe whole thing was the war, the end of the war, getting a job done, terrific pressure,â Hopper recalled near the end of her life. âWe didnât think ahead at all.â\n\nIronically, the one moment during that period where Hopper began to contemplate the long-term implications of the computing revolution came during a brief holiday leave in December of 1944. Back on the Upper West Side with her family, she described her work on the Mark I to her insurance executive father, who instantly grasped that the corporate world would find immense value in such a machine âparticularly a data-intensive business like insurance dependent on calculating probabilities. âNow whether he had gone to New York and mentioned that to any of the insurance companies, Iâll never know, but that was the first mention that I ever heard of using the computer in industry,â Hopper recalled. âIt was from my own father.â\n\nEventually, Aiken decided that Hopperâs language skills made her the ideal candidate to write a proper instruction manual for using the Mark I. While Hopper resisted initially, she ultimately threw herself into the project, creating a document that was both an intellectual history and a how-to guide. She introduced the Mark Iâand the notion of programmable computers generallyâvia a sweeping survey of calculating devices, from the abacus technology developed in the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the philosopher Blaise Pascalâs âarithmetic machine.â She also paid tribute to the Victorian inventor Charles Babbage, whose âfirst sketched out in the 1830s but never builtâwas a close analogue of the Mark I itself. With that context established, Hopper then delivered another 300 pages of detailed instructions, with chapter headings like âHow the electromechanical counters workâ and âInterpolators and value tapes.â Today there are entire sections of bookstores devoted to how-to guides for the latest programming platforms: TensorFlow, Unreal Engine, blockchain, JavaScript. Hopperâs manual for the Mark I marked the origin of that publishing nicheâand to this day, it remains one of the most literate, historically-grounded examples of the genre.\n\nOn its own, Grace Hopperâs role as one of the worldâs first software programmers would have earned her a prominent spot in the pantheon of computer history. But her tenure with Bloch and Aiken at Harvard was only the beginning. Influenced by her fatherâs early insight about the commercial potential of digital machines, Hopper left the Navy in 1949, and after turning down offers from IBM, Honeywell and RCA, she took a job as âSenior Mathematicianâ at the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation, later known as the Sperry Rand Corporation. Once again, her fixation with making code intelligible to humans would lead to breakthrough ideas that changed computing forever.\n\nCompilers marked an enormous step forward in terms of making programming easier and less error-prone, but it also opened up a radical new possibility that would not become apparent for several years: the idea that you could write a single program and then compile it to run on entirely different hardware. âHer instinct that programming should be machine-independent was a reflection of her preference for collegiality; even machines, she felt, should work well together,â the tech historian Walter Isaacson wrote in his book, The Innovators. âIt also showed her early understanding of a defining fact of the computer age: that hardware would become commoditized and that programming would be where the true value resided. Until Bill Gates came along, it was an insight that eluded most of the men.â\n\nEmboldened by her success, Hopper embarked on a new project designed for the kind of back-office accounting uses that her father had initially envisioned. She created a compilerâeventually called FLOW-MATICâthat could trigger instructions based on 20 English-language statements, mostly revolving around common calculations used in billing and payroll. âThe systems and procedures analysts, the accountants, operating management can use the UNIVAC FLOW-MATIC SYSTEM with little training,â the user manual promised. âFamiliarity with detailed computer coding is not necessary.â FLOW-MATIC offered a glimpse of a future where software was integrated into every aspect of corporate life, a world where you didnât have to have an advanced math degree to get something useful out of a digital computer."
