        "text": "Jules Gabriel Verne (1828 – 1905) was an acclaimed French author who is regarded by many (along with H G Wells) as the “father of science fiction”.\n\nHe is best known for his novels “A Journey to the Center of the Earth” (1864), “From the Earth to the Moon” (1865), “Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea” (1869–1870), “Around the World in Eighty Days” (1873) and “The Mysterious Island” (1875).\n\nVerne wrote about space, air, and underwater travel before navigable aircraft and practical submarines were invented, and before any means of space travel had been devised.\n\nJules Verne is the second most translated author of all time, only behind Agatha Christie, with 4223 translations, according to Index Translationum.
