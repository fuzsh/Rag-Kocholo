The 2014 edition of this story, for example, a superior translation was published in USA with a title variant, but won't automatically be grouped on adding to the database. Obviously we need to enter the title on the book for accuracy of entry and can't enter by title of its original language as searching will be hampered accordingly.\n\nAnother option would be to link as a comment, in a similar way to some of the series titles are, for example how ppint did for the Man From U.N.C.L.E. paperbacks."
