        "text": "April 20, 2013\n\nreview of\n\nJules Verne's The City In The Sahara\n\nby tENTATIVELY, a cONVENIENCE - April 20, 2013\n\nThus ends my spree of reading 8 Verne bks. The 1st 7 were The Demon of Cawnpore ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17... ), The Begum's Fortune ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17... ), Carpathian Castle ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17... ), For The Flag ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17... ), The Village In The Treetops ( http://www.goodreads.com/story/show/3... ), Yesterday And Tomorrow ( http://www.goodreads.com/story/show/3... ), & Into the Niger Bend ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17... ). This latter being the 1st novel that this one is the conclusion of. The other 3 novels that're the most germane to this one being The Begum's Fortune, For The Flag, & The Village In The Treetops.\n\nThe Begum's Fortune is about 2 men who construct cities 'from scratch' using a vast fortune' - one w/ utopian intentions, the other w/ destructive ones. The City In The Sahara's city is closer to the latter. For The Flag has an insane inventor who creates a super-weapon that he sells to pirates. The City In The Sahara has a super-inventor who creates weapons & other things that're used by a master-criminal. The Village In The Treetops has a Frenchman & an American traveling thru Africa. The City In The Sahara has a French delegation w/ a British woman traveling thru Africa. SO, The City In The Sahara is hardly w/o precedent in Verne's work.\n\nThis was good but I wish it had been better. Verne has a way of making some 'surprises' be a little too obvious. As I've noted before, I'm not sure whether this obviousness wd've been so obvious in the early 20th century when this was written & published but it sure seems obvious to me 100 yrs later.\n\nIn the introduction here from translator I. O. Evans, the reader is brought up-to-date on how this succeeds Into the Niger Bend: \"The events which followed the kidnapping of the Barsac Mission and of Jane Blazon are described in the present volume. They illustrate Jules Verne's inventive genius as well as his ability to keep abreast of the latest scientific and technical advances and to weave them into his narrative. Unpublished until after his death in 1905, the story incorporates inventions made towards the end of his life, notably that of wireless telegraphy.\" - p 6\n\n\"In those orderly days the notion of a super-scientific community ruled by criminals seemed beyond the bounds of possibility. We have seen such communities - not mere cities but nations - compared to which the City in the Sahara seems almost tame.\" - p 7\n\nPresumably Evans refers here to Nazi Germany who certainly had a technically advanced military society w/ completely vicious motives. Otherwise, one cd also mention Las Vegas, an oasis in the desert made by gangsters - fortunately w/ a less destructive bent.\n\n\"His Blackland typifies much in our civilization, its triumphs of technology and its material advances compared with its backwardness - indeed with its retrogression - in moral and spiritual development\". - p 7\n\nVerne having been largely a prophet of technology it's nice to see him warning about the dystopic side.\n\nAs w/ the 1st volume, The City In The Sahara distinguishes itself w/ at least a little multi-lingualism: \"If the hypothetical traveller had asked the name of the town, and if one of its inhabitants had been willing to tell him, he would perhaps have said in French \"Le nom de cette ville est Terre-noire\": but he would be just as likely to reply in Italian \"Questa città è Terra nera\"; in Bambara, \"Ni dougouba ntocko a bé Bankou Fing\"; in Portuguese, \"Hista ciudad e Terranegra\"; in Spanish, \"Esta ciudad es Tierranegra.\" But no matter in what the language, all the answers would have meant: \"The name of this city is Blackland.\" - p 10\n\n&, as I wrote about For The Flag: \"The villains in general are described thusly: \"In them I can distinguish no common stock - not even, indeed, that bond which will be found among North Americans, or Europeans, or Asiatics. The colour of their skins varies - from white, to copper and black, and it is the black of the Australasian rather than that of the African. Most of them seem to belong to the East Indian races; Count d'Artigas certainly belongs to that race found in the Dutch East Indies: Serko comes from the Levant, and Spade seems of Italian origin.\" (p 101) Seems pretty good to me.\" In other words, it's interesting that the most multi-cultural societies in Verne are the criminal ones. Here, however, the multi-culturalism is cleanly along the lines of: whites = slavers, blacks = slaves - for wch Verne has no sympathies - even tho his heros are mostly 'whites'.\n\nEven the standard of living in the criminal city of Blackland is high: \"For the rest, Blackland was kept perfectly clean, and well maintained, and was provided with every possible commodity. Not a house of the Merry Fellows or the Civil Body which did not have its own telephone. Not a street, not a house - not even a hut in the slaves' quarters - which did not enjoy water from the mains, and which was not lighted by electricity.\" (p 16) Granted, this remarkable state of prosperousness was the result of the genius of an inventor completely unaware of the murderous & thieving nature of the city's ruler.\n\nAs w/ For The Flag: \"is it not a very small distance, indeed, between super-intelligence and insanity? Does not genius border on madness?\" (p 20) I wonder if that cliché originated w/ Verne? Probably not.\n\n\"A remarkable device able to produce rain was then among his imaginings. he did not hesitate to describe his dreams to anyone who would listen to them, and Harry Killer, with some others, had heard of this invention while it was still a mere theory. But, while the others only laughed at such madness, Harry Killer had taken it seriously, so much so that he had made it the basis of his schemes.\" (p 21) The villain, as an outsider, is capable of thinking outside the box. Again, I'm reminded of Vegas.\n\nAs w/ the villain's factory town in The Begum's Fortune: \"They found themselves in a wide open space surrounded on all sides by unscaleable walls.\" [..] \"Behind them, more than a hundred yards away, was a wall two hundred and fifty yards long with neither door nor window, above which appeared a tall factory chimney\". - p 24\n\nAs w/ all Verne protagonists, there're servants - & black people are mostly honored when they're 'faithful servants': \"I, too, feel distressed, and I give a pitiful thought to the brave and faithful Tongané.\" (p 3) \"the prisoners were agreeably surprised at the arrival of Malik. As soon as she saw Jane Blazon, Malik fell at her feet and kissed, with touching warmth, the hands of her good mistress, who was equally moved herself.\" (p 62) Blazon, a 'white' woman, might've been \"equally moved\" but she DIDN'T fall \"at her feet and kiss\" Malik (a 'black' woman) 's hands.\n\nBlacks are called by various names. I'd like to see what the original French was b/c here we have the murderous Killer call blacks \"Negroes\", a strangely non-racist term coming from the mouth of a man willing to kill blacks w/o the slightest compunction:\n\n\"\"You see those Negroes,\" asks Harry Killer, pointing to two widely separated stains. \"Suppose they took it into their heads to escape. They wouldn't get far!\"\n\nWhile speaking, he has picked up the telephone transmitter. \"Hundred and eleven circle. Radius fifteen hundred and twenty-eight.\"\n\n\"Then, turning towards us, \"Look carefully at this,\" he tells us.\n\n\"After a few minutes wait, during which nothing special happens, one of the patches is obscured by a cloud of smoke. When this has cleared, the patch has vanished.\n\n\"\"What's happened to the man working there?\" asks Mlle Mornas in a voice trembling with emotion.\n\n\"\"He's dead,\" Harry Killer replies coldly.\n\n\"\"Dead! . . .\" We exclaim. \"You've killed that poor fellow for no reason at all?\"\n\n\"\"Don't worry, he's only a Negro,\" Harry Killer explains with perfect simplicity. \"Mere trash. When there aren't any of them left we can get more. That one was wiped out by an aerial torpedo. It's a sort of rocket which carries up to fifteen miles, and you've seen its accuracy and speed.\" - p 50\n\n'Smart missiles', eh?! While the heros are generally sympathetic, they're not exactly free of the prejudices that Killer demonstrated above. Take, eg, Dr. Chatonnay's analysis of Killer:\n\n\" [..] \"Unable to tolerate the slightest opposition, he passes without transition from fury to calmness and back again, and he shows a profound contempt for human life, as others understand it.\"\n\n\"\"Such a character is not uncommon in Africa,\" Dr. Chatonnay explained. \"To live continually in the company of men generally inferior to themselves, to be able to order them about uncontrolled, too often makes cruel satraps out of Europeans who haven't a firm enough character and lofty enough ideals to keep them from being seduced.\" - p 62\n\nVerne has a supporting character be a statistician, who he parodies: \"\"At the moment I'm working out problems,\" he said portentously. / \"\"Bah!\" said the reporter. / \"\"Yes, Monsieur. I'm trying to solve this: 'A is twice as old as B was when A was as old as B is now. When B is as old as A is now, the total of their ages will be N years. How old are A and B?\" - p 58\n\nThe absent-minded inventor takes the escaped prisoners of the Barsac Mission into his factory shelter: \"He pressed a button and a bell rang. A black servant appeared. \"Jacko,\" Camaret said, as though it were the simplest thing in the world, while the Negro rolled his startled eyes. \"Show these gentleman and this lady to their rooms.\" (p 85) I don't know what \"Jacko\" wd've signified in early 20th century France, nor do I know what name the character originally had in French but I found this in the \"Urban Dictionary\" online: \"a word created by the tabloids to use instead of using the name Michael Jackson to make every news about him sound bad and sell more copies to fill their buckets with money even if it means destroying other people's reputation and lives Wacko Jacko dead at 50\" ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define... ) It seems appropriate somehow.\n\nThe inventor strikes me as a cross between Leonardo da Vinci &, even more so, Nikola Tesla - by having him generate power that's sent out as waves picked up by special receivers.\n\n\" [..] \"I'm certain, that they can be employed for a hundred different purposes. For example, it would be possible to communicate with the whole surface of the earth, by telegraph or telephone, without needing a wire to link the respective stations.\n\n\"\"Without a wire!\" exclaimed his hearers.\n\n\"\"Without a wire, What would we need for that? Very little. I've only got to think out a suitable receiver.\" - p 104\n\n& an incredible (as in truly NOT-credible) coincidence links the inventor to another one in Africa:\n\n\"wireless telegraphy\n\n[..]\n\n\"\"Yes, two men have appeared on this terrestrial globe at the same instant of history. One, an italian called Marconi, has found a method of radiating into space the waves known as Hertzian\".\" - p 111\n\nOf course, Marconi is generally so credited but some favor Tesla. Verne, being French, has to mention the 2nd responsible person as a Frenchman:\n\n\"Doctor Branly. It was he who discovered the receiver\".\" - p 111\n\n&, gee, not only does Killer torture a prisoner, but so does the absent-minded 'good guy' inventor:\n\n\"\"I ought to warn you,\" the engineer said gently, \"that I'm going to make you talk.\"\n\n[..]\n\n\"Camaret shrugged his shoulders. Then, without insisting, he placed on the thumbs and under the feet of the recalcitrant four little metallic plates, and connected them up to some terminals. This done, he suddenly threw a switch.\n\n\"The man at once twisted in frightful convulsions. The veins on his neck were swollen as though about to burst, and his empurpled face displayed intolerable suffering.\" - p 130\n\nThis torture brings about almost immediate 'positive' results. I think it wd've been better if Verne hadn't made it seem so easy. He just reinforced the idiots who think torture is ok. If this were a novel written today, it wd be the genitals & the eyes (or some such) that were wired.\n\nThe inventor, Camaret, after learning of Killer's despicable activities, is nonetheless, loath to use the destructive capabilities at his easy disposal to attack & kill Killer & to, therefore, save himself & his people. Instead, he goes thru ridiculous other plans to try to help them escape from Killer's destructive intentions. These plans fail & the French reporter, Amédée Florence, comes up w/ the 'bright' idea of fomenting a slave revolt: \"\"There must be at least four thousand of them, not counting the women, who ought to be as good as two men when they're set free.\"\" (p 137) The thing about this idea is that there doesn't seem to be much concern about the slaughter that the slaves will undergo as they're poorly armed for fighting. SO, while on the surface, it seems that the Europeans have the slaves' freedom in mind, they're really just using them in a casual way for irresponsible ulterior motives. Far more people are likely to die this way than if Camaret had just blown up Killer & his palace & cronies to begin w/. Oh well..\n\nIn the end, Barsac's mission to prove that blacks in French West Africa are deserving of voting rights is somewhat justified by having most of the bad guys be white. But does Barsac conclude that voting for the blacks is a good idea? Read this & find out."
