        "text": "SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, XXIII:2 #69 (July 1996): 171-187.\n\nArthur B. Evans\n\nLiterary Intertexts in Jules Verneâs Voyages Extraordinaires\n\nContrary to popular belief (in America, at least), Jules Verne was neither a scientist, nor an inventor, nor a geographer. He was a writer. During the 1850s, Verne was an aspiring young dramatist with a degree in law, a passionate love for literature, and a job at the Paris stock market. He began his professional writing career by penning short articles on scientific and historical to../pics for the lucrative journal MusÃ©e des Familles in order to supplement his meager income. Verne culled the facts he needed for these articles from long sessions in the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale poring over various reference books, scientific magazines, and newspapers. In so doing, the young author came to envision the possibility of incorporating all this documentation into a new and innovative type of novel whose narrative format would simultaneously blend fiction with fact, adventure with didacticism, and literary motifs with scientific data. Some ten years later in 1863 (following his publisher Hetzelâs rejection of his first attempt at such a novel in Paris au XXe siÃ¨cle), Verneâs Cinq semaines en ballon [Five Weeks in a Balloon] appearedâthe first example of a new literary genre dubbed the roman scientifique and the first work in what would ultimately become the series called the Voyages Extraordinaires.1\n\nOne much-discussed trademark of Verneâs writing style is that he continually cites famous scientists, geographers, and historiansâsometimes quoting sizable portions from their works and inserting them directly into his narratives. I have argued elsewhere, for instance, that Verne used this particular strategy to help increase the authoritative credibility of the scientific pedagogy contained in his novels, to bolster the verisimilitude of his fictional plot-structures, and to experiment stylistically with the juxtaposition of scientific and literary terminology.2\n\nHowever, a much less-discussed aspect of Verneâs oeuvre (perhaps because of its pervasiveness) is his repeated allusions to well-known literary figures and their worksâallusions which function so as to firmly anchor his narratives to a recognizable cultural tradition, and thereby broaden Verneâs own literary authoritativeness by identifying his novels more closely with those of the canonical literature(s) of his time. It is this aspect of Verneâs unique narrative recipe that I wish to investigate in the following essay.3\n\nVerneâs literary tastes and training are easily discernable by the selection of authors whom he chooses to cite most frequently. Although, from French literature, he sometimes quotes âclassicalâ writers like Rabelais,4 Cyrano de Bergerac,5 HonorÃ© dâUrfÃ©,6 Corneille,7 Racine,8 Voltaire,9 Diderot,10\n\npage 172\n\nFÃ©nelon,11 and La Fontaine12 when he is making a rhetorical point, Verneâs preferences generally run to more Romantic writers such as Rousseau,13 Dumas pÃ¨re,14 Victor Hugo,15 Alfred de Musset,16 Michelet,17 and Baudelaire18 when he is fleshing out fictional characters or portraying emotional states. And, although (like most educated 19th-century hommes de lettres) Verne is seemingly well-read in the Bible19 and in the writers of antiquity such as Ovid,20 Aristotle,21 Homer,22 Horace,23 and Virgil,24 he is nevertheless much more likely to cite or quote certain English and German authors with whom he apparently felt a certain spiritual kinship: novelists, poets, and dramatists like Shakespeare,25 Dickens,26 Wordsworth,27 Swift,28 Defoe,29 Pope,30 Byron,31 Goethe,32 and Hoffmann.33\n\nIn addition to their presence as overt literary citations, these authors and works can also be discerned in many of Verneâs habitually used themes, moral biases, and stylistic idiosyncracies. An exhaustive investigation of these (undoubtedly) thousands of intertextual phenomena would, of course, exceed the limits of this study. But pointing out and discussing a small number of them should suffice to highlight the broad scope of Verneâs borrowings and to suggest the omnipresence of these literary intertexts at all levels of his narration.\n\nFor example, the very goal of Verneâs Voyages Extraordinaires as outlined by his publisher Hetzelââto outline all the geographical, geological, physical, and astonomical knowledge amassed by modern science and to recount, in an entertaining and picturesque format...the history of the universeâ34âcan be seen to closely resemble that of Verneâs friend and mentor Alexandre Dumas pÃ¨re as the latter once described the goal of his unfinished Isaac LaquÃ©dem:â...all this makes for a universal epic, which is nothing less that the history of the worldâ35 And there are a number of surprising parallels between Dumasâs epic novel and Verneâs own Voyage au centre de la Terre [Journey to the Center of the Earth]. For example, in Isaac LaquÃ©dem, the hero LaquÃ©dem is guided to the center of the Earth by Tyane, a scientist and disciple of Pythagoras. During the long subterranean descent, the former is obliged (much like Verneâs young Axel) to âbuild up an entire arsenal of Scienceâ36 by examining the geological history of the planet as shown in the successive strata of rock through which they pass. At the Earthâs core, he is told:\n\nâ... there where the compressed air has, due to the pressure of the upper levels, acquired a greater density...exists an enclosed, spherically-shaped cavern which is illuminated by two pale stars known as Pluto and Proserpine.\"37\n\nSimilarly, in Verneâs Voyage au centre de la Terre, as his three explorers discover an unknown world inside the Earth, Axel exclaims:\n\nâThen I remembered this theory about an English captain who compared the Earth to a huge, hollow sphere where, in its interior, the air stayed luminous because of the pressure, and where two stars, Pluto and Proserpine, circled there in their mysterious orbits. Could he have been right?â38\n\nFurther, in his Voyages et aventures du capitaine Hatteras (published the following year), Verneâs scientist Dr. Clawbonny explains to the crew of the British ship Forward during their voyage toward the north pole:\n\npage 173\n\nâFinally, it has recently been claimed that, at the poles, there was an immense opening, which was the source of the lights of the aurora borealis, and by which one could penetrate into the interior of the world. Then, inside this hollow sphere, it was imagined that there existed two planets, Pluto and Proserpine, and that the air was luminous because of the strong pressure exerted on it.â\n\nâThey said all that?â asked Altamont.\n\nâAnd wrote about it, and very seriously. Captain Synness, one of our countrymen, even proposed to Humphry Davy, Humboldt, and Arago that they attempt an expedition. But these scientists refused.â39\n\nBoth Dumas and Verneâs fictional speculations on this matter have been noted by scholars, who invariably attribute them to a common 19th-century source. In 1818, a certain Yankee (not British) infantry captain named John Cleves Symmes (not âSynnessâ) attracted world-wide attention, sparked international controversy, and inspired numerous hollow-earth stories both during his lifetime and after40 when he made the following appeal:\n\nTo All the World! I declare the Earth is hollow, and habitable within; containing a number of concentrick [sic] spheres, one within the other, and that is it open at the poles 12 or 16 degrees; I pledge my life in support of this truth, and am ready to explore the hollow if the world will support and aid me in this undertaking.41\n\nTwo years later, in 1820, a certain Captain Adam Seaborn published one of the first American utopias called Symzonia: A Voyage of Discoveryâa supposed chronicle of his voyage to the interior of the Earth via an opening at the pole and his discovery of an idyllic subterranean civilization therein42. Subsequently, in 1826, Symmesâs hollow-Earth hypotheses were published in a âscientificâ treatise entitled Symmesâs Theory of Concentric Spheres.43\n\nBut, contrary to accepted belief, nowhere in Seabornâs novel nor in Symmesâs various texts does one find any mention of the center of the Earth containing the two planet/stars âPluton et Proserpineâ or of a luminous âcompressedâ atmosphere supposedly surrounding them. Verne, who normally gleaned his scientific documentation from newspaper reports, journal articles, and reference books, appears to have culled the details of this particular theory directly from the imaginative fiction of Alexandre Dumas.\n\nA great many other French littÃ©rateurs haunt the pages of the Voyages Extraordinairesâsome quite explicitly, others more implicitly. Let us take the unlikely example of the French symbolist poet Charles Baudelaire, for instance. Although traditionally categorized at opposite ends of the literary spectrum, echoes of Baudelaireâs Les Fleurs du Mal can often be heard in Verneâs texts. In fact, the first few verses of the Baudelaireâs poem titled âLeVoyageâ could be viewed as emblematic of both the implied reader and the thematic scope of the Voyages Extraordinaires as a whole: âFor the child who loves postcards and stamps, the universe is equal to his vast appetite...â44 But more specific baudelairian intertexts are also embedded in the narrative fabric of several Vernian novels. For example, when viewed in the context of the opening verses of Baudelaireâs poem âLâHomme et la Merâ [âMan and the Seaâ]ââFree man, you will always cherish the sea!â45âCaptain Nemoâs empassioned praises of the sea in Vingt mille lieues sous les mers [Twenty\n\npage 174\n\nThousand Leagues under the Sea]ââAh, monsieur, to live in the bosom of the seas! There alone is independence! There I recognize no masters! There I am free!â46âseem doubly suggestive. And Baudelaireâs obsession with the passage of time, often anthropomorphized into images such as the one in his poem âLâHorlogeâ [âThe Clockâ], reappears in a surprisingly similar fashionin Verneâs short story âMaÃ®tre Zachariusâ [âMaster Zachariusâ] which is a rather fantastic tale about a Faustian Geneva clockmaker whose soul, bartered for fame and fortune, is consumed by a living incarnation of his handiwork.Lastly, in attempting perhaps to give the flying machine a greater degree of poetic amplitude, Verne conferred upon the ship-like helicopter of Robur-le-conquÃ©rant [published in English as Robur the Conqueror and as The Clipper of the Clouds] the name âLâAlbatrosâârecalling the famous allegorical poem of the same name by Baudelaire, a poem which ends by explaining:\n\nThe Poet is similar to this prince of the clouds\n\nWho haunts the tempest and laughs at the archer;\n\nExiled on the ground amidst hoots of scorn,\n\nHis giantâs wings prevent him from walking.47\n\nVerneâs narrative strategy seems clear. The function of his literary citations as credibility-builders has been noted. But, in this case, Verneâs use of the term âLâAlbatrosâ (with the many literary connotations that it carries, from Coleridge to Poe and from Michelet to Baudelaire) serves to complement his portrayal of the fictional hero of this novel, Robur himself. For Robur, a true âprince of the cloudsâ (as Captain Nemo might be calledâquite literally, as we discover in LâIle mystÃ©rieuse [The Mysterious Island]âa âprince of the seasâ), also found himself to be an âexileâ on land and jeered at by his contemporaries. But, once aboard his powerful airship, this technological gÃ©nie braves the worst of storms and soars far above the bullets fired at him, exulting in his supremacy over his earthbound rivals. Baudelaireâs poetic allegory is thus clothed in new scientific regalia; it is now the scientist who becomes the poet, and it is now the machine (and the knowledge that created it) which becomes the symbol of earthly transcendence.\n\nIntertexts from English, German, and American literature are also abundant in Verneâs Voyages Extraordinaires. The floating island-utopia of LâIle Ã hÃ©lice [Propeller Island], for example, is reminiscent not only of those mobile sail-propelled cities described by Cyrano de Bergerac in Les Etats et empires du soleil [The States and Empires of the Sun] but also of Swiftâs Laputa in Gulliverâs Travels. Certain scenes and characters in Verneâs Pâtit-Bonhomme [Foundling Mick] and Le Rayon vert [The Green Ray] strongly resemble their counterparts in certain novels by Dickens such as David Copperfield and Oliver Twist48. Daniel Defoeâs Robinson Crusoe seems almost omnipresent in the dozens of shipwreck, castaway, and colonization motifs that proliferate throughout the Voyages Extraordinaires. Shakespeareâs Shylock of The Merchant of Venice is duplicated in Isac [sic] Hakhabut of Verneâs Hector Servadac [in English as Hector Servadac and as Off on a Comet]. And E.T.A.Hoffmannâs The Sandman is the thematic touchstone for Verneâs gothic Le ChÃ¢teau des Carpathes [The Carpathian Castle], among other novels.49\n\npage 175\n\nBut three foreign authors in particular seem to have exerted a powerful influence on Jules Verne during his early career and, as a result, are truly ubiquitous in Verneâs work: James Fenimore Cooper, Walter Scott, and Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nJames Fenimore Cooperâs exotic tales of the New World in his so-called âLeatherstockingâ seriesâThe Pioneers (1823), The Last of the Mohicans(1826), The Prairie (1827), The Pathfinder (1840), and The Deerslayer (1841)âas well as in his sea-faring novels like The Pilot (1823), seem to have fired the imagination of young Verne and prompted him to consciously imitate this author in his earliest short stories for the MuseÃ© des Familles. Concerning the first of these, Un Drame au Mexique [A Drama in Mexico]âoriginally titled âLes Premiers navires de la marine mexicaineâ [âThe First Ships of the Mexican Navyâ]âVerne confided to his father in 1851: âMy article for Pitre-Chevalier is but a simple adventure-story in the style of Cooper which I am locating in Mexico.â50 Pitre-Chevalier, the editor of MusÃ©e des Familles, introduced the secondâentitled Martin Pazâsaying: â...our readers will undoubtedly appreciate once again an example of this very different genre wherein all of Peruâits history, races, customs, landscapes, national dress, etc.âwill be revealed to them by M. Jules Vernes [sic] through this exciting story Ã la Cooper.â51 And, as his repeated references to Cooper throughout this later novels clearly indicate,52 Verne apparently never lost his taste for these adventure tales of early America. In an interview in 1895, at the age of 67, he confirmed: âI never tire of Fenimore Cooper; certain of his romances deserve true immortality and will, I trust, be remembered long after the so-called literary giants of a later age are forgotten.â53\n\nNot only are Cooperâs name and literary works frequently mentioned in the pages of the Voyages Extraordinaires, but a number of direct âborrowingsâ are also quite evident (sometimes credited, sometimes not). For example, note the striking similarity of plot structures between Verneâs LâIle mystÃ©rieuse and Cooperâs little-known novel The Crater, or Vulcanâs Peak.54 The latterâpublished 27 years prior to Verneâsâtells of a castaway on a volcanic island who, after his rescue, returns there with a group of homesteaders to colonize it, succeeds in establishing a prosperous colony, defends it against attacking pirates, and is forced to flee at the end as the island paradise explodes and sinks into the sea. Other obvious examples include Cooperâs memorable characters of Hawkeye and Chingachgook, undoubtedly the source for Nic Deckâs woodsmanship and survival skills in Verneâs Le ChÃ¢teau des Carpathes55 as well as this exotic frontier foodââan Indian preparation called âpemmicanâ which contains a great many nutritive elements in a small volumeâ56âoften carried by a number of Vernian explorers. Or, as an even more direct reference to Cooper, consider the following passage from Les Enfants du capitaine Grant [Captain Grantâs Children] where Verneâs protagonists are on the Argentine Pampas and discussing what to do in the event of a prairie fire:\n\n... Paganel exclaimed with visible satisfaction. âThat happens sometimes and, as for me, I would not be at all unhappy to witness such a spectacle.â\n\npage 176\n\nâThere goes our scientist again,â answered Glenarvan. âHe would pursue scientific inquiry so far as getting himself burned alive.â\n\nâMy heavens no, my dear Glenarvan. But in having read oneâs Cooper, one would know how Leatherstocking saved himself from a prairie fire by pulling out the grass around himself for a dozen meters or so. Nothing could be simpler. Therefore, not only do I not fear the approach of such a fire, I look forward to it!\"57\n\nPassages such as this one are very representative of how Verne often mixed didacticism and adventure in his narratives in a way that was both utile and dulce (as Horace would say). Integrated directly into the plot structure and mediated through the novelâs protagonistsâas opposed, for example, to a de-personified lecture by an external narratorâthe pedagogical lesson enhances rather than distracts from the flow of the fictional narrative itself. Typically, Verneâs heroes almost always escape in the nick of time from an impending catastrophe by utilizing some tidbit of practical knowledge remembered by the scientist of the group. Most often, such knowledge (and, implicitly, the lesson to be learned by the reader) is scientific in nature, providing happy outcomes to the various cliff-hanging episodes in which Verneâs protagonists seem to repeatedly find themselves. Here, the lesson was gleaned from having read Cooper. And, by inserting such a passage into the plot (almost gratuitously, since the fire was never to occur), Verne adroitly fulfills a number of narratological needs: he not only instructs his readers, in boy-scout fashion, about what to do if they are caught in a brush fire on the prairie, but he also underscores the educational and authoritative value of âoneâs Cooperââi.e., a text which, ostensibly, everybody must (or should) both own and refer to for such useful tips. Further, in citing Cooper in this manner, Verne not only increases the verisimilitude of his fictional charactersâwho have read these ârealâ booksâbut also implicitly identifies his own novels with those of Cooper and, as a result, augments his own pedagogical credibility and literary standing. And finally, by making use of such an intertextual reference, Verne also succeeds in adding an element of âNew Worldâ exoticism to his narration while indirectly pointing out the many parallels between the on-going adventures of Paganel, Glenarvan, and company and those of the legendary âBas de Cuirâ [âLeatherstockingâ].\n\nAnother English-language author whom Verne uses for similar purposes is Walter Scott, whose historical romances were to leave a deep and lasting imprint on the novels of the Voyages Extraordinaires. In a 1895 interview, Verne explains:\n\nAll my life I have delighted in the works of Sir Walter Scott, and during a never-to-be-forgotten tour in the British Isles, my happiest days were spent in Scotland. ... Of course, to one familiar with the works of Scott, there is scarce a district of his native land lacking some association with the writer and his immortal work.58\n\nAnd, as might be expected, Verneâs references to Scott and his works are indeed frequent in his Voyages Extraordinaires,59 and many of Verneâs fictional characters are closely patterned after those in Waverley (1814), Rob Roy\n\npage 177\n\n(1818), and Ivanhoe (1819). But, more often, Scottâs works seem to serve as an intertextual filter through which Verneâs Romantic âvisionâ of Scotland is expressedâmost particularly in his two novels Les Indes noires [The Black Indies] and Le Rayon vert. Consider, for example, the following passage from the latter novel describing Fingal Cave:\n\nâWhat an enchanting placeâ Miss Campbell quietly said, âand what person would be so prosaic as to not believe that it wasnât specially created for sylphs and water spritesâthese spirits for whom the sounds of this huge wind harp would play whenever the wind blows? Wasnât it this heavenly music that Waverly [sic] heard in his dreams, this voice of Selma whose chords our novelist used as a lullaby for his heros?â\n\nâYou are right, Miss Campbell,â answered Olivier, âand doubtlessly when Walter Scott was searching for a perfect image for his poetic history of the Highlands, he thought first of Fingalâs cave.â60\n\nIn this passage, Scottâs novel Waverley serves as a rich cultural touchstone that is obviously quite familiar to the fictional protagonists. This literary reference enables them (and Verne) not only to articulate more clearly their impressions of the geographical site itself but also to express more poetically their emotions when viewing it. Apart from the pedagogical intent of this passageâi.e., the geographical âsourcesâ of Scottâs inspirationâVerne once again succeeds intextually associating himself with a famous author while using him in stepping-stone fashion to deepen the poetic overtones of his descriptions. It is important to note that portraying certain emotions (like love) was often quite difficult for Verne, by his own admission.61 One could therefore argue that, in addition to the many other narratological functions of such persistent literary name-dropping we find in his fiction, another role they seem to play is to provide an acceptable (albeit second-hand) vehicle for foregrounding sentimentality. Consider, for example, the following passage from Les Enfants du capitaine Grant:\n\nOne day they would stroll in a birch and tamarack wood, among vast fields of yellowish heather; another day, they would climb the steep hills of Ben Lomond, or ride horseback across the wild glens, studying, understanding and admiring the famous sites of this poetic land still named âthe country of Rob Royâ and sovaliantly immortalized by Walter Scott. In the evening, as the sun went down and âMacFarlaneâs lanternâ burned on the horizon, they would wander along the âbartazens,â an ancient circular gallery which formed a circle of battlements around Malcolm Castle, and there, pensive, alone, and as if they were the last people on Earth, they would sit on a piece of broken stone in the middle of Natureâs silence, beneath the pale shafts of moonlight, watching the falling night darken the mountaintops, and quietly savouring this pure rapture that only those whose hearts are filled with love can ever understand.62\n\nThe Romantic exoticism of this passage is constructed around three basic focal points: the technical and local-usage lexicon (which serves a pedagogical function as well as adding a measure of âothernessâ), the Ã©tat dâÃ¢me Nature-Man leitmotif (which valorizes and gives literary credibility to the fictional rÃªverie portrayed), and the name of Walter Scott himself (who stands, literally, in the center of this passageâacting as a catalyst to all those rich literary associations\n\npage 178\n\nevoked by the mention of his name), an allusion which also facilitates the readerâs assimilation of the somewhat long series of typically Romantic clichÃ©s that follow him. Thus, in the case of Walter Scott at least, Verneâs repeated use of such author-references in his Voyages Extraordinaires seems triply strategic: they augment the âauthor-ityâ of his didacticism, they enhance the âliterary-nessâ of his narration, and they provide a credible conduit for portraying emotion in his fictional characterizations.\n\nFinally, Edgar Allan Poeâs substantial influence on Jules Verne is amply illustrated by the many fine studies devoted to this topic during the 20th century.63 How, after reading Baudelaireâs translation of Poeâs works, Verne developed his first notions of what would eventually become the Voyages Extraordinaires is an oft-repeated observation in Vernian criticismâto the extent, one might say, that it has become common knowledge. And the facts do indeed seem to speak for themselves. From his article written on Poe early in his career for the MusÃ©e des Familles to his masterful Le Sphinx des glaces [The Ice Sphinx] where he completes Poeâs Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, Verne was a life-long admirer (and imitator) of this particular American author. But, as with many other aspects of Jules Verneâs life and works, a number of myths and misconceptions continue to exist about his literary debt to Edgar Allan Poe, and the record needs to be set straight.\n\nAlthough no solid documentation is available to prove it, Verneâs initial discovery of Edgar Allan Poe (or âEdgard PoÃ«â as he always persisted in spelling it) probably first came through Nadar,64 who was a mutual acquaintance of both Verne and Baudelaire, the latter since the mid-1840s. It was Baudelaire who wrote an article on Poe in 1852 entitled âEdgar Poe, sa vie et ses oeuvresâ [âEdgar Poe, His Life and Worksâ] for the Revue de Paris,65 and later in 1856 he published the first French translation of Poeâs works which he called Histoires Extraordinaires [Extraordinary Stories]âa title of some significance when considering that of Verneâs own series. The noted Vernian biographer Allotte de la FÃ¼ye places the Verne-Poe encounter in 1851, saying: âDuring this period, Jules Verne, an avid reader of English fiction, must have already read Poeâs Extraordinary Tales [sic] in the original.â66 But this statement is extremely doubtful on two grounds: first, because Verne could not read English (it was his biographers who invented this myth about him) and, second, because it was not until 1862 that Verne first began to mention Poe in his correspondenceâreferences which multiplied rapidly after this date and which culminated, two years later, in his own article for the MusÃ©e des Familles entitled âEdgard PoÃ« et ses oeuvres.â [âEdgard PoÃ« and his Works.â]67\n\nBefore examining Verneâs article on Poe, however, it is interesting to take note of the following book review of Verneâs then newly-published novel called Cinq semaines en ballon. This review appeared (anonymously) in the MusÃ©e des Familles in 1863:\n\nM. Jules Verne is of the same school as the American novelist Edgard PoÃ«. Like PoÃ«, he knows how to link fiction to reality in proportions so exact that one does not know where one begins and the other leaves off. Whatâs more, Verne has the\n\npage 179\n\nadvantage of being clearer and, if I might express it thus, more logical in his inventiveness.68\n\nAlthough such an assertion may at first seem surprising, the evidence suggests that Verne himself was responsible for writing this review of his own novel. First, such a practice was (and continues to be) rather commonplace in the publishing industry. Second, note the spelling of âEdgard PoÃ«.â And third, compare the two statements concerning Poeâs alliance of fiction and realityâas well as the lack of logic in his inventionsâwith certain views expressed by Verne in his later article âEdgard PoÃ« et ses oeuvres.â\n\nVerne begins his 1864 article praising Poe, explaining some aspects of Poeâs life, and analyzing lengthy excerpts from Poeâs works. Verne then goes on to say: â... they occupy an important place in the history of imaginative works because PoÃ« created a distinct literary genre all his own. One might call him the leader of the School of the Strange.â69 And speaking of Poeâs âThree Sundays in a Week,â Verne continues:\n\n... Then the third individual would accomplish the same voyage, under the same conditions, but in the opposite direction, going east, and after his circumnavigation of the world, and he would be behind by one day. What would happen if all three travellers met one Sunday at their starting point? For the first, it would beyesterday, for the second today, and for the third tomorrow. So you see, this is truly a cosmological joke told in very curious terms indeed...70\n\nContrary to most scholarship on the subject, it would not be unreasonable to see in this passage the inspiration for Verneâs future Le Tour du monde en 80 jours (1873) [Around the World in Eighty Days]. In similar fashion, one might easily discern the origins of Verneâs much later Le Sphinx des glaces (1897) from his comments on the conclusion of Poeâs Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym:\n\nAnd the narrative is left hanging at this point. Who will ever complete it? Surely someone more audacious than I and someone more willing to explore the realm of the impossible.71\n\nBut it is especially those attributes of Poeâs narrative style which Verne singles out for praise or for criticism that are the most intertextually suggestive. For example, while lauding the exotic ânewnessâ of Poeâs subject matter and fictional portrayals, Verne nevertheless attacks his apparent lack of concern for the role of Providence in human affairs, the rampant materialism of his vision, and the manner in which Poe twists natural laws to suit his fictional needs (a criticism Verne later would level against his British rival H.G. Wells):\n\n... what one must admire in the works of PoÃ« are the novelty of situations, the discussion of little-known facts, the observation of the compulsive faculties of Man, the choice of his subject-matter... Allow me also to draw attention to the purely materialistic aspect of his fictions. One never witnesses any kind of providential intervention; PoÃ« seems not to admit it and claims to explain everything by physical laws which he invents whenever he needs them; one does not feel in him any sort of faith which the incessant contemplation of the supernatural should give him. He works in a kind of âcold fantastic,â if I might express it thus. He is a fervent disciple of materialism; but I imagine that this is less the fault of his temperament\n\npage 180\n\nand perhaps more the influence of this purely practical and industrial society of the United States in which he lived.72\n\nThese observations are significant not only as critical commentary on Poeâs own narrative practices, but also on Verneâsâin understanding, for example, the importance that religion will have throughout the Voyages Extraordinaires, in grasping Verneâs Taine-like views of the American social psycheâvividly portrayed in several of his Yankee protagonists like those in De la Terre Ã la lune [From the Earth to the Moon] or LâIle Ã hÃ©lice [Propeller Island]âor inappreciating Verneâs intransigence about using only ârealâ science in his fictions. And it also becomes clear why Verne, although claiming to be of the same literary âschoolâ as Poe in his book review of 1863, saw fit to qualify that statement as he did. As one critic was later to express the similarity between these two authors: âPoeâs use of scientific detail must have attracted Verne ... But where Poe is the doomed poet of the Inward, Verne is the supreme celebrant of the Outward.â73\n\nAlthough it is true that Edgar Allan Poe stands as the most frequently cited authorâforeign or domesticâin all of Verneâs Voyages Extraordinaires, this quantitative fact is somewhat deceptive: the number of times that Poe is mentioned or quoted at length in Le Sphinx des glaces alone is enough to skew all comparisons. Of more intertextual consequence are Verneâs many concrete borrowings from Poe. In terms of the formerâs character portrayals, for instance, a comparison of Poeâs âThe Man That Was Used Upâ with the Gun-Club members of De la Terre Ã la Lune suggests more than simple coincidence. And, in addition to those probable sources mentioned earlier, certain themes and plot structures in Poeâs tales tend to reappear quite regularly (albeitin slightly modified form) throughout a great many of Verneâs novels and short stories. Compare, for example, the cryptograms of Poeâs âThe Gold Bugâ with Verneâs Voyage au centre de la Terre, La Jangada [The Giant Raft], and Mathias Sandorf; the maelstrom of Poeâs MS Found in a Bottle and A Descent in the Maelstrom with Verneâs Vingt mille lieues sous les mers and âUn Hivernage dans les glacesâ [âWintering in the Iceâ]; the âacceleratedâ populace of Poeâs âThe Devil in the Belfryâ with Verneâs âLe Docteur Oxâ; the maritime cannibalism of Poeâs Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym with Verneâs Le Chancellor [The Wreck of the Chancellor]; the discussions of mesmerism in Poeâs âThe Facts in the Case of M. Valemarâ and âMesmeric Revelationâ with Verneâs Mathias Sandorf and LâIle mystÃ©rieuse; the study of hoaxes in Poeâs âThe Balloon Hoaxâ with Verneâs âLe Humbugâ and the list goes on. Further, there are sometimes striking parallels between the two authorsâ writing styles: the passages of pure pedagogy intercalated into the narrative; the shipâs log as a device for first-person narration; the frequent use of technicisms, neologisms, and foreign languages; a penchant for surprise and/or cliff-hanging chapter endings; and the repeated use of the âdetective storyâ format as a means to valorize scientific inquiry, among other similarities. A limited number of these intertextual phenomena have been identified and discussed in the critical scholarship devoted to these two authors of the\n\npage 181\n\nextraordinaire. But most have yet to be fully explored, and the potential for detailed comparative exegesis remains very rich indeed.\n\nBefore leaving the realm of Verneâs literary sources, one last group of cited intertexts must be discussed: those of Verne himself. Throughout Verneâs works, repeated reference to characters, plots, and actual titles of previously-published novels of the Voyages Extraordinaires is astonishingly frequent. This practice of textual self-citation performs many useful narratological tasks: it acts as a sort of âbinderâ which adds a measure of continuity and unity to the series, it tends to increase the verisimilitude of the fictional events portrayed, and it helps to insert Verneâs own works into the same dimension of extra-textual referents occupied by those authoritative scientific and literary works which he constantly cites.\n\nThe most obvious manifestation of this intriguing practice are the many âplugsâ of his own novels that Verne incorporates into his narratives via footnotes, parenthetical anecdotes, prefaces, and even the dialogues of his fictional protagonists. Note, for example, the âtheatreâ conversations between M. and Mme Caterna in Claudius Bombarnac74 where casual mention is made of the fact that Jules Verneâs Michel Strogoff [Michel Strogoff, Courier of the Czar] was currently playing at the ChÃ¢telet theatreâit was during this period, of course, that the play was actually being performed thereâor the many footnotes in Verneâs Sans dessus dessous [Topsy-Turvy]75 (perhaps added by Hetzel?) that catalogue previously-published novels in the series such as De laTerre Ã la Lune, Autour de la Lune [Around the Moon], LâEcole des Robinsons [The School for Crusoes], and Hector Servadac. One hypothesis which might explain such references could be the sluggish sales of Verneâs later novels: these âadvertisementsââinserted directly into the narratives themselvesâseem to occur only in those works published after 1889. And three historical developments taking place in France during this period would appear to lend some credence to such an assertion. First, promulgating a radical change in the nationâs educational policy (previously controlled by the Catholic Church), the Third Republic now mandated access to the instruction of science in the public schools. Second, the French publishing industry throughout this period was witnessing a massive influx of Verne-like novels of scientific fiction into the French marketplace. And third (perhaps as a direct result of the previous two), the until-then booming sales of Verneâs Voyages Extraordinaires suddenly began to taper off dramatically.76\n\nA final variant of Verneâs auto-intertextuality consists of the three groups of âserialâ novels in the Voyages Extraordinaires: the two trilogies of Les Enfants du capitaine Grant/Vingt mille lieues sous les mers/LâIle mystÃ©rieuse and De la Terre Ã la Lune/Autour de la Lune/Sans dessus dessous and the two-novel series of Robur-le-conquÃ©rant/MaÃ®tre du Monde. In these texts, the same characters reappear and continue the saga in a new setting, or one character provides the link between an earlier novel and a subsequent one. For example, Robur is the hero and the anti-hero respectively, Barbicane and his Gun-Club continue their (literally) world-shaking ballistic experiments, and Ayrton is discovered on the South Sea island where he was marooned, etc. In one\n\npage 182\n\ninstance, the published text itself provides the physical link: the heroes of LâIle mystÃ©rieuse recognize an aging Captain Nemo and his Nautilus because they have previously read Professor Aronnaxâs book on the subject entitled Vingt mille lieues sous les mers. Verneâs narrative strategy thus proves to be doubly effective: not only does such a reference provide the fictional framework (and credibility) necessary for the story to unfold, but it also serves to further blur the boundaries for the reader between the real and the unreal, between fiction and non-fiction, between imagination and reality.\n\nNeedless to say, this practice of ârecyclingâ always takes as its point of departure only those novels which initially enjoyed a huge commercial success. But one interesting attribute of these sequels is that they invariably present some form of reversal when compared to their predecessors. Roburâs case is exemplary, but a host of other examples confirm this observation: Ayrton the arch-villain and convict is rehabilitated and becomes a hero in his own right; Nemo the mysterious, powerful, and rebellious wanderer of the seas becomes a repentant old man on his deathbed (the Nautilus having for some time been imprisoned inside an island sea-cave) who reveals his true identity while confessing his past sins; Barbicane, Maston, and company not only fail in their ambitious engineering enterprise but become laughable caricatures of their former selves as Verne satirizes both them and their positivistic hubris. These later novels clearly portray Verneâs own personal evolutionâhis rapidly changing views on the intrinsic value of scientific and technological growth versus that of social responsibility and ecological preservation. That is to say, Verne continually and deliberately undermines the ideological foundations upon which his earlier (and more popular) texts were constructed.\n\nTo briefly conclude this overview, if one wished to locate a kind of one-stop-shopping catalogue of the various scientific and literary sources and intertextual references in Jules Verneâs Voyages Extraordinaires, an excellent place to begin would be Captain Nemoâs impressive library aboard the Nautilusâreminiscent (albeit on a much more sumptuous scale) of the library that Verne had installed aboard his own yacht while completing the rough draft of a novel later to be called Vingt mille lieues sous les mers:\n\nIt was a library. High pieces of furniture made of black violet ebony inlaid with brass supported upon their wide shelves a great number of books, uniformly bound. The shelves followed the shape of the room and terminated at the lower part in huge couches, covered with brown leather, which were curved to afford the greatest comfort. Light, movable desks, made to slide in and out at will, allowed one to place oneâs book down while reading. In the center stood a large table, covered with pamphlets, among which were some newspapers that were already old. Electric light flooded this harmonious ensemble from four unpolished globes half-sunk into the vaulted ceiling. ...\n\nAmong these works I noticed masterpieces of the ancients and the moderns, all the finest works that mankind has produced in history, poetry, the novel and science, from Homer to Victor Hugo, from Xenophon to Michelet, from Rabelais to Madame Sand. But works of science, in particular, held an important place in the library. Books on mechanics, ballistics, hydrography, meteorology, geography, geology, etc., were just as prominent as works of natural history. ... I saw there\n\npage 183\n\nall the works of Humboldt, Arago, Foucault, Henri Sainte-Claire Deville, Chasles, Milne-Edwards, Quatrefages, Tyndall, Faraday, Berthelot, the AbbÃ© Secchi, Petermann, the commander Maury, Agassiz, and more. Also included were the memoirs of the Academy of Sciences, the bulletins of various geographical societies, etc.77\n\nThis imaginary library78 aboard the Nautilus represents a rich locus of Verneâs actual source materialâa kind of ambulatory BibliothÃ¨que Nationale, if you will, devoted to the worldâs recognized masterpieces of science and literature. As such, it seems to aptly embody the two-fold goals of the Voyages Extraordinaires themselves: âinstruction which entertains, entertainment which instructs...â79 But it is also fascinating to note that there is one glaring lacuna in Captain Nemoâs collection. As Professor Aronnax observes: âThere were works on science, ethics, and literature in many languages. But not one single book on political economy. That subject seemed to have been strictly proscribed.â80 In Nemoâs underwater utopia, no books by political economists are permitted. Which is perhaps as it should be...but thatâs another story.\n\nNOTES\n\nFor a more detailed study of the life and works of Jules Verne, see Charles-NoÃ«l Martin, La Vie et lâoeuvre de Jules Verne (Paris: Michel de lâOrmeraie, 1978), William Butcher, Verneâs Journey to the Centre of the Self (London: Macmillan, 1990), Andrew Martinâs The Mask of the Prophet (NY: Oxford UP, 1990), and my own Jules Verne Rediscovered (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1988).

Note also the dedication in Mathias Sandorf in which Verne honors both Dumas pÃ¨re and fils saying: âI dedicate this book to you while dedicating it also to the memory of that storyteller of genius who was Alexandre Dumas, your father. In this work, I have tried to make of Mathias Sandorf the Monte-Cristo (sic) of the Extraordinary Voyages.â It is also significant that Verne describes Dumas pÃ¨re here as a âstorytellerââa title he always preferred for himself\n\npage 184\n\nduring his latter years (v. Jules Verne, âCorrespondance avec Mario Turiello.â Europe 613 [1980], 108-35).\n\nBy far the most cited and quoted French author throughout Verneâs works, Victor Hugo is mentioned in Vingt mille lieues sous les mers (107, 569), Autour de la Lune (78), La Maison Ã vapeur (128), Le ChÃ¢teau des Carpathes (91, 115), Le Testament dâun excentrique [The Last Will of an Eccentric] (Hachette, 25), and LâEtonnante aventure de la mission Barsac [The Amazing Adventure of the Barsac Mission] (Les HumanoÃ¯des associÃ©s, 368-69), among other novels. Verneâs fervent admiration for âLe PoÃ¨teâ is also visible in his correspondence with his family (v. Jules Verne, âJules Verne: 63 lettres.â Bulletin de la SociÃ©tÃ© Jules Verne 11-13 [1938], 47-129). But, purely in terms of textual dynamics, Verneâs constant quoting of Hugoâparticularly during this period in Franceâconstituted a powerful device for strengthening the âreader-identificationâ dimension of his fictions.\n\nLe ChÃ¢teau des Carpathes (140) and Le Rayon vert (140).\n\nLe Rayon vert (213) and Vingt mille lieues sous les mers (107, 379), and quoted in Mathias Sandorf (Hetzel, 271).\n\nClovis Dardentor (â10/18,â 17), slightly misquoted in Le Village aÃ©rien (Les HumanoÃ¯des associÃ©s, 17), and mentioned in his article on Edgar Allan Poe, âEdgard PoÃ« et ses oeuvresâ MusÃ©e des familles (avril 1864), 113.\n\nDe la Terre Ã la Lune (338), Les Enfants du capitaine Grant (846), Claudius Bombarnac (Agora, 182), Le Village aÃ©rien (Les HumanoÃ¯des associÃ©s, 138-39), and Le Secret de Wilhelm Storitz [The Secret of Wilhelm Storitz] (Les HumanoÃ¯des associÃ©s, 49).

In an interview with an English journalist in 1904, when asked who was his favorite author of all time, Verne replied: âFor me, the works of Charles Dickens stand alone, dwarfing all others bytheir amazing power and felicity of expression. What humor and what exquisite pathos are to be found contrasted in his pages! How the figures seem actually to live, and their printed utterances to become transformed into audible speech! I have read and reread his masterpieces again and again...â (Gordon Jones, âJules Verne at Home,â Temple Bar 129 [1904]: 669).\n\nQuoted in Le Rayon vert (15).\n\nCited in Autour de la Lune (132).\n\nDaniel Defoeâs masterpiece Robinson Crusoe could well be considered the most omnipresent literary intertext throughout the Voyages Extraordinaires, given the number and variety of ârobinsonadesâ which continuously appear in the series.

See, for example, his reference to Hoffmann in the novel Voyage au centre de la Terre: âWe resembled this fantastic character of Hoffmannâs who lost his shadow.â(316). To my knowledge, Hoffmann never wrote of such a personnage (although he did, in one short story, tell of a man who had his mirror image stolen from himâa theme later developed by Offenbach in his Les Contes dâHoffmann [The Tales of Hoffmann] in 1881). Verne was most probably thinking of a story by another German\n\npage 186\n\nauthor with whom he was undoubtedly familiar: Adalbert Von Chamisso, a scientist-explorer-writer who portrayed just such a fictional character in his Peter Schlemihls wundersame Geschichte [Peter Schlemihlâs Fantastic Story] (Nurnberg: J.L. Schrag, 1814), a fable which became very popular during the Romantic era in France. One French translation of this text is of particular note in this regardâLa Merveilleuse histoire de Peter Schlemihl, enrichie dâune savante prÃ©face oÃ¹ les curieux pourront apprendre ce que câest que lâombre [The Marvellous Story of Peter Schlemihl, enriched with a scholarly preface where the curious can learn what it is to lose oneâs shadow](1860)ânot only because of the date of its appearance in France (i.e., during Verneâs period of library research when he was accumulating interesting scientific data for his journal articles) but also because the French publishing house who marketed this particular edition was named A.G. Hoffmann! A mere coincidence? Or did Verne mistakenly attribute this tale to Hoffmann because of the French publisherâs name on the title page? [Many thanks to Drs. Edith Welliver and Darryl Gibson of DePauw University for helping me to track down these references.]\n\nLetter dated March, 1851.

These literary references function so as to firmly anchor Verneâs romans scientifiques to a recognizable cultural tradition, thereby broadening Verneâs own literary authoritativeness by identifying his novels more closely with those of the canonical literature(s) of his time. Verneâs intertextuality takes many forms: overt literary citations, passing authorial nods, thematic parallels, ideological biases, etc. And the sources come from many historical periods, genres, and nationalities: e.g., from Ovid and Virgil to Defoe and Dickens, and from Baudelaire and Victor Hugo to Goethe and Hoffmann. But the works of three writers, in particular, appear to have exerted a powerful influence on Verne and seem especially ubiquitous throughout the Voyage Extraordinaires: James Fenimore Cooper, Sir Walter Scott, and Edgar Allan Poe.
