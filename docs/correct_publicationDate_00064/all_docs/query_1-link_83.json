How is it going?\n\nScience fiction' cool, but, for me personally, the most valuable are works, which predicted things. There are a lot of examples, I guess, the last significant one in my life was the video game Death Stranding, which predicted isolation and even dinosaurs with umbilical cord (not a word-to-word prophecy, but still close enough to reality to be noticed by news agencies and people, and call Kojima genius again ).\n\nWith all of this in mind, what's the literary work you can remember with something, that in time appeared to be real? Not just technologies themselves, but their influence on humanity too.\n\nOrcadian\n\nLover of hard science fiction\n\nJoined\n\nApr 3, 2022\n\nMessages\n\n379\n\nLocation\n\nNW Europe\n\nMay 22, 2023\n\n#2\n\nA book I loved as a young adult, and read many times, was A.C. Clarke's The City and the Stars. The book opens with Alvin and his pals engaged in an immersive virtual reality game. From memory it seems to them that they are battling creatures in a jungle. None of the kids has ever seen a jungle IRL, for they have never left their city, Diaspar - a city-in-a-bubble in the middle of a vast desert. This sort of 3D, immersive VR is almost upon us now - not bad for a book published 67 years ago. And I suppose the role the tech plays in the future world of Disapar is that of allowing people to 'experience' environments that have been lost to humans for countless aeons. This VR system is thus a memory bank of sorts.\n\nLast edited: May 23, 2023\n\nPaulMmn\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nOct 19, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n519\n\nMay 23, 2023\n\n#3\n\n20,000 Leagues Under the Sea - the submarine Nautilus, Captain Nemo... novel by Jules Verne.

It may have predicted the internet & social media, but IMO it was predictive more in the sense of people becoming more house-bound, less active, more insular. We are never told why people now live in their rooms but clearly sthg has happened that has made this necessary. Today, it's more like internet/social media is what is making us want to conduct our social lives at a distance from others. Even when they're in public places, many people spend most of their time 'elsewhere' as they stare into their phone. So even though they are physically 'in the world', in a social sense it's as if they are in their room.\n\nBrian G Turner\n\nFantasist & Futurist\n\nJoined\n\nNov 23, 2002\n\nMessages\n\n26,556\n\nLocation\n\nUK\n\nMay 28, 2023\n\n#10\n\nThe Iliad, from before 750BC.

Emphasizes Five Weeks In A Balloon, From The Earth To The Moon, Round The Moon, Adventures Of Captain Hatteras, Journey To The Center Of The Earth, Captain Grant's Children, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, Around The World In 80 Days, Mysterious Island, and to a lesser degree The Begum's Fortune, Propeller Island, The Barsac Mission, Carpathian Castle, Robur The Conqueror, Facing The Flag, Diary Of An American Journalist and Invasion Of The Sea.

But I could be wrong.\n\nEver hear of the Bitting Sperm Whale ? it named Livyyan Melville in honor of Hermann Melville It lived in the oceans roughly about the same time as the Megalodon shark. It was the same size a Sperm whale but unlike a sperm whale it had teeth in both upper and lower jaws and each tooth was over a foot long , It hunted on other whales and some have conjectured that it may have battled Megladon."
