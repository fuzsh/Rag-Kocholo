It seems he is the only living descendant of a Frenchman who married a begum – “a Muslim lady of high rank” – and, through her wealth, became rich.\n\nAs it would happen, another claimant to the fortune shows up, a German professor by the name of Schultze. To avoid an expensive court case, they agree to split the money in half and each spend it on the projects of their dreams. These projects turn out to be two new cities, both highly regulated but as different from each other as the masterminds who founded them. Away in the wilds of Oregon state, the cities are built and populated, thriving till one man’s sinister ideals threaten to undermine both topias."
