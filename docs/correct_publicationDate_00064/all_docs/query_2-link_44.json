        "text": "As so often, science fiction came first.\n\nIn 1879, Jules Verne wrote a story called \"The Begum's Fortune\" in which a Frenchman and a German inherit the fortune of a relative, a Begum in India.\n\nThe Frenchman sets up a town called Frankville in the state of Oregon in the United States. The German also founds a town, Steeltown, nearby.\n\nThe Frenchman's town is an ideal community (Verne was French of course). The German, however, makes a large gun and plans the destruction of Frankville at one blow.\n\nTo cut the story short, when the gun fires, the shell goes so fast that it misses Frankville and goes into orbit. It is still there - so they say.\n\nCivilian targets\n\nJules Verne had identified the desire of a \"terrorist\" to hit an enemy population and cause the maximum damage possible.\n\nAttacks on civilians are not new. The very word \"terrorist\" implies that civilians are put in fear, though it must also be remembered that one person's \"terrorist\" is another's \"freedom fighter\".\n\nThe primary purpose of terrorist groups is to create terror in the population at large\n\nColonel Mike Dewar, security analyst\n\nBut whether they are called guerrillas or terrorists or freedom fighters, armed groups have often attacked civilians. Many, though not all, wars against colonialism were based on them - by the FLN in Algeria against the French, or Mau Mau in Kenya against the British, for example.\n\nOther groups like the Irish Republican IRA and the Basque separatist ETA have used a combination of tactics against both civilian and military or official targets, both in the homelands they seek to champion and in the strongholds and watering holes of their enemies. The Chechen rebels do the same, as we've seen in Moscow.\n\nIndeed, the tactic of attacking civilians helps to determine whether a group is terrorist or not, according to Colonel Mike Dewar, a former British army officer and now security analyst in London.\n\n\"Your methods determine if you are a terrorist,\" he said.\n\nLarge scale attacks\n\n\"Targeting civilians is not a new phenomenon. The primary purpose of terrorist groups is to create terror in the population at large. The military should not, by definition, be terrorised.\"\n\nWhat is new perhaps is the scale of the attacks on civilians. Part of this is a product of technology.\n\n\"It is easier to get hold of explosives. There are better communications. Someone invented the car bomb. Somebody thought of flying planes into buildings,\" said Col Dewar.\n\nJust as civilisation has progressed, it seems, so has terrorism along with it.\n\nWhat is also new is a shift from a local and particular event to a wider, even the global, arena, according to William Hopkinson, a former senior official at the British Ministry of Defence and an Associate Fellow at the Royal Institute for International Affairs in London.\n\n\"In earlier conflicts, civilians in one place might not have been safe. Now the threat is widespread and can crop up anywhere. The Bali bomb was a way of getting at the West not to further some local objective\", he said.\n\nGovernments, these days, adds William Hopkinson, are better protected. \"I suspect that the Dutch royal family does less bicycling these days,\" he remarked.This leaves civilian targets as an easier option.\n\nReligious aspect\n\nAnother factor driving the modern style of terrorism is ideology or religion. Attacks from such sources have been daring and audacious. And cruel both to the victims and the participants. Al-Qaeda, with its emphasis on anti-Western Islamic fervour, is the prime example.\n\nHamas, the Islamic specialist in suicide or martyr bombings against the Israelis, is another. Both attack civilians as an openly declared policy. Both rejoice in the deaths of their own.\n\nThere has also been a threat from cults. The Japanese Aum Shinrikyo let off sarin nerve gas on the Tokyo subway in 1995 in an apparent effort to precipitate a doomsday scenario in which it would survive triumphant. Civilians were the victims.\n\nAnd ideology feeds on another modern phenomenon - publicity. The 9/11 attacks convulsed large parts of the world mesmerised by the television pictures.\n\n\"In attacks to destroy a civilisation,\" notes William Hopkinson, \"attacks on civilians can contribute to wrecking the economy and producing paralysis.\""
