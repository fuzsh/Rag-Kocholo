        "text": "Jules Verne's stories have been translated many times. The purpose of this page is to help identify which title a publication should be placed under or if a new title record is required.\n\nIf the actual text is available, the first paragraph can be used to identify the translation in one of the tables below. If the title matches, then the link for that title can be used to select the title record page and add a new publication.\n\nIf the text matches but there is no matching title, then a new title record should be created. Please copy the translation information in the title note from one of the listed titles to the new title and remember to variant the title back to the original French title record.\n\nIf the text is not available, but the translator is known, a match may still be possible using the same approach as for the translation text.\n\nAs a final check, some translations are identified by the original publisher. That information has been included to help in such a case.\n\nIf a translation cannot be identified, the last entry in the table may be for unidentified translations. The title records here should be used as a base for such publications. They should be migrated to the correct translation / title if the translation is later identified.\n\nThe term Translation text is not known has been used in titles where the translator is known, but the text has not been provided. At some future point this may be entered. Publications should only be placed under these titles if the translator matches. The term Publication text is not known has been used for titles that include publications that have given no indication of their translation. This makes them generic 'bit-buckets', useful for sources which do not provide the necessary information to identify the translation.\n\nNOVEL\n\nAutour de la Lune\n\nThis book was published as a single part, but billed as the second part of De la Terre à la Lune.
