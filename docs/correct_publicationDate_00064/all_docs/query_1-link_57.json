Evans\n\nA Bibliography of Jules Verne’s English Translations\n\nThe following bibliography lists the most common English translations of Jules Verne’s Voyages Extraordinaires. The opening passages from Verne’s original French texts and their different English translations are provided for purposes of identification and comparison. For those novels originally published in two or three parts (where, in translation, each part was often published as a separate volume), the opening passage for each part is indicated by the symbol [○].\n\nIt is important to note that serializations in periodicals (e.g., The Boys’ Own Paper), abridged versions of previous translations (e.g., the Sampson Low “Junior Books,” among others), unpublished typescripts, theater adaptations, screenplays, and comic book editions are not included in this listing. All the English translations published in the popular “Seaside Library” series by George Munro, in the 1911 Vincent Parke collection (ed. Charles F. Horne), and in the many “Fitzroy” editions (ed./trans. I.O. Evans) are included. A selection of modern reprints and electronic versions are listed for many of the translations.\n\nFor each Verne novel, the best English translations in terms of completeness, accuracy, and style are marked with a star (☆); those of relatively good quality are marked with a check (✔); and the poorest ones are marked with a black ball (●). Those left unmarked are of either mediocre or unknown quality. Occasional lexical variants in the opening passages are included in brackets.\n\nThis bibliography would not have been possible without the generous help of many Verne scholars, but especially Stephen Michaluk, Jr. (co-author with Brian Taves of the Jules Verne Encyclopedia), Jean-Michel Margot (current president of the North American Jules Verne Society), and Clark Evans of the Rare Books and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress, to whom I am very grateful.\n\nCinq semaines en ballon - 1863\n\nIl y avait une grande affluence d’auditeurs, le 14 janvier 1862, à la séance de la Société royale géographique de Londres, Waterloo place, 3.

Je suis né en 1761, à Grattepanche, un village en Picardie. Mon père était cultivateur. Il travaillait sur les terres du marquis d’Estrelle. Ma mère l’aidait de son mieux. Mes soeurs et moi, nous faisions comme ma mère.\n\n○ Ils étaient là de sept à huit cents, à tout le moins. De taille moyenne, mais robustes, agiles, souples, faits pour les bonds prodigieux, ils gambadaient sous les dernières clartés du soleil qui se couchait au delà des montagnes échelonnées vers l’ouest de la rade.\n\nFlight to France (1888, London: Sampson Low, trans.?) - reprint: abridged and edited by I.O.

My father was a farm labourer. He worked on the estate of the Marquis d’Estrelle. My mother did her best to help him. My sisters and I followed our mother’s example.\n\n“Gil Braltar” (July 1958, Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, trans. I.O.

Par cette annexion, le territoire de la République s’accrut de soixante-sept mille milles carrés. Mais l’astre floridien ne brille que d’un éclat sécondaire au firmament des trente-sept étoiles qui constellent le pavillon des états-Unis d’Amérique.\n\n○ « Texar! ... » tel était bien le nom détesté que Zermah avait jeté dans l’ombre, au moment où Mme Burbank et miss Alice arrivaient sur la berge de la crique Marino.\n\nTexar’s Vengeance, or North Versus South (1887, New York: Munro, trans.

By this annexation, the territory of the United States was increased sixty-seven thousand square miles, but the star of Florida glitters with only a secondary light in the constellation of thirty-eight stars that adorns the flag of the United States.\n\n○ “Texar!”—such was the well-hated name that Zermah had shouted into the darkness at the moment Mrs. Burbank and Alice reached the bank of Marine Creek.\n\n✔Texar’s Revenge, or North Against South (1887, London: Sampson Low, trans.?) - reprint: abridged and edited by I.O.

By the annexation the area of the republic was increased by some 67,000 square miles. But the star of Florida shines with second-rate brilliancy in that constellation of thirty-eight which spangle the banner of the United States of America.\n\n○ “Texar!”—such was the well-hated name that Zermah had shouted into the darkness at the moment Mrs. Burbank and Alice reached the bank of Marino Creek.\n\nDeux ans de vacances - 1888\n\nPendant la nuit du 9 mars 1860, les nuages, se confondant avec la mer, limitaient à quelques brasses la portée de la vue.\n\nSur cette mer démontée, dont les lames déferlaient en projetant des lueurs livides, un léger bâtiment fuyait presque à sec de toile.\n\n✔A Two Years’ Vacation (1889, New York: Munro, trans.?). NOTE: this edition also includes a translation of Verne’s preface to this novel.\n\nOn the night of the 9th of March, 1860, the heavy, lowering clouds, which seemed almost a part of the sea, completely concealed from view even objects that were but a few yards off, as a small vessel with furled sails flew along over the fierce and angry waves, upon which occasional flashes of lightning cast a lurid glare.\n\nAdrift in the Pacific (1889, London: Sampson Low, trans.?) - reprint: abridged and edited by I.O.

The sea and sky were as one, and the eye could pierce but a few fathoms into the gloom. Through the raging sea, over which the waves broke with a livid light, a little ship was driving under almost bare poles.\n\n●A Long Vacation (1967, Holt Rinehart and Winston, trans. Olga Marx).\n\nOn the night of March 9, 1860, the clouds scudded so low they seemed to be lying on the ocean.

Edward Baxter).\n\n“What a sorry sight the human race is,” remarked the philosophers at the end of the eighteenth century, “cutting each other’s throats for the sake of a few ice-covered acres of land.” It was not their wisest observation, for they were referring to Canada, over which the British and French were then at war.\n\nCésar Cascabel\n\n« Personne n’a-t-il quelque autre monnaie a me donner?...

Mais ils ne se préoccupaient guère de cette éventualité, les marins qui faisaient leurs préparatifs d’appareillage à bord de Franklin, dans la matinée du 15 mars 1875.\n\n✔Mistress Branican (1891, New York: Cassell, trans. A. Estoclet)\n\nWhen you part with friends on the threshold of a long journey, there are at least two chances of your never seeing them again; those whom you leave behind may not be there on your return, and you, who go away, may never come back. Such calculations, however, were far away from the thoughts of the sailors who were preparing to get under sail on board the Franklin, on the morning of the 15th of March, in the year 1875.\n\nMistress Branican (1892, London: Sampson Low, trans.?) - reprint: Melbourne: Sun Books, 1970.\n\nThere are two chances of never again seeing the friends we part with when starting on a long voyage; those we leave may not be here on our return, and those who go may never come back. But little heed of these eventualities were taken by the sailors who were preparing for the departure on board the Franklin in the morning of the 15th of March, 1875.\n\nLe Château des Carpathes- 1892\n\nCette histoire n’est pas fantastique, elle n’est que romanesque. Faut-il en conclure qu’elle ne soit pas vraie, étant donné son invraisemblance ? Ce serait une erreur. Nous sommes d’un temps où tout arrive, — on a presque le droit de dire où tout est arrivé. Si notre récit n’est point vraisemblable aujourd’hui, il peut l’être demain, grâce aux ressources scientifiques qui sont le lot de l’avenir, et personne ne s’aviserait de le mettre au rang des légendes.\n\n✔The Castle of the Carpathians (1893, London: Sampson Low, trans.?) - reprint: abridged and edited by I.O. Evans as Carpathian Castle, London: Arco/Westport, CT: Associated Booksellers, 1963.\n\nThis story is not fantastic; it is merely romantic. Are we to conclude that it is not true, its unreality being granted? That would be a mistake. We live in times when everything can happen—we might almost say everything has happened. If our story does not seem to be true to-day, it may seem so to-morrow, thanks to the resources of science, which are the wealth of the future.\n\nClaudius Bombarnac - 1892\n\nClaudius Bombarnac reporter XXe siècle Tiflis (Transcaucasie)\n\nTelle est la suscription de la dépêche que je trouvai le 13 mai, en arrivant à Tiflis.\n\nVoici le texte de cette dépêche:\n\n« Toute affaire cessante à la date du 15 courant Claudius Bombarnac se trouvera au port Ouzoun-Ada littoral est de Caspienne.

There he will take the train by the direct Grand Transasiatic between the European frontier and the capital of the Celestial Empire.”\n\nP’tit-Bonhomme - 1893\n\nL’Ireland, dont la surface comprend vingt millions d’acres, soit environ dix millions hectares, est gouvernée par un vice-roi our lord-lieutenant, assisté d’un Conseil privé, en vertud’une délégation du souverain de la Grande-Bretagne.\n\nFoundling Mick (1895, London: Sampson Low, trans.?)\n\nIreland, which has an area of 31,759 square miles, or 20,326,209 acres, formerly formed part of the insular tract of land now called the United Kingdom.\n\nMirifiques aventures de Maître Antifer - 1894\n\nCe matin-là,—9 septembre 1831,—le capitaine quitta sa cabine dès cinq heures et monta sur la dunette.\n\nLe soleil pointait déjà à l’est, ou, plus exactement, la réfraction l’élevait au-dessus des basses couches de l’atmosphère, car son disque se traînait encore au-dessous de l’horizon.\n\nCaptain Antifer (1895, London: Sampson Low, trans.?) - reprint: Amsterdam: Fredonia, 2001.\n\nIt is September 9th, 1831. The captain left his cabin at six o’clock. The sun is rising, or to speak more exactly, its light is illuminating the lower clouds in the east, for its disk is still below the horizon.\n\nL’île à hélice - 1895\n\nLorsqu’un voyage commence mal, il est rare qu’il finisse bien. Tout au moins, est-ce une opinion qu’auraient le droit de soutenir quatre instrumentistes, dont les instruments gisent sur le sol. En effet, le coach, dans lequel ils avaient dû prendre place à la dernière station du rail-road, vient de verser brusquement contre le talus de la route.\n\n●The Floating Island, or the Pearl of the Pacific (1896, London: Sampson Low, trans.

Evans as Propeller Island, London: Arco/Westport, CT: Associated Booksellers, 1965 (rpt. of this edition: London: Panther, 1965); Amsterdam: Fredonia, 2002.\n\nWhen a journey begins badly it rarely ends well. At least that ought to have been the opinion of the four instrumentalists whose instruments lay on the ground, the carriage in which they were riding having suddenly upset against a mound by the side of the road.\n\nFace au drapeau - 1896\n\nLa carte que reçut ce jour-là-15 juin 189..—le directeur de l’établissement de Healthful-House, portait correctement ce simple nom, sans écusson ni couronne:\n\nAu-dessous de ce nom, à l’angle de la carte, était écrite au crayon l’adresse suivante:\n\n« A bord de la goélette Ebba, au mouillage de New-Berne, Pamplico-Sound. »\n\nFacing the Flag (1897, New York: Neely, trans.?) - reprint: Amsterdam: Fredonia, 2001.
