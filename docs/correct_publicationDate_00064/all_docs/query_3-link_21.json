        "text": "I would argue he mostly was not. \"From Earth to the Moon\", its sequel, and \"20,000 leagues under the sea\" were definitely SF, but most of Verne's books were what we would today call technothrillers -- adventure stories with emphasis on existing, albeit cutting-edge, technology. \"Five weeks in a balloon\" and \"Mysterious Isalnd\" are good examples. \"Beguma's Fortune\" may qualify as SF, as it involves some impossible technology (although Verne may not have realized it was impossible). And quite a few of his books, such as \"Captain Grant's Children\" and \"Fifteen-year old Captain\" are straight adventure stories, without even technothriller aspect.\n\nI broadly agree., although I would add a couple of titles that were definitely SF. Journey to the Centre of the Earth was a purely speculative tale of exploration, and so it counts. The less-well-known Carpathian Castle was a ghost story on the surface, but the supernatural events were rationalised by technology, not all of it available at the time of writing IIRC.\n\nIt's funny how that works- Clive Barker is and will always be a horror writer, but by now he's probably written more books in the fantasy genre.\n\nAs for Verne, Paris in the 20th Century is certainly sci-fi, and a cursory examination of his work suggests that about a quarter to a third of his books were science fiction, with the rest being \"hard speculation\" in some form, usually, geographic."
