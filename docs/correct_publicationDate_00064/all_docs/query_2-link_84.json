        "text": "Jules Verne’s family life\n\n“Having lived in Amiens with my family at 23 Boulevard Guyencourt since summer 1871, I decided to buy a house here. In September 1873, I moved into this property at 44 Boulevard Longueville (the present-day Boulevard Jules-Verne). I wrote The Mysterious Island (1874-75), Michel Strogoff (1876), The Begum’s Fortune (1879) and The Steam House (1880) here, as well as other novels.\n\nI moved again in October 1882, to 2 Rue Charles-Dubois, the house on the corner of Boulevard Longueville, now home to the House of Jules Verne museum.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, I was finding it increasingly difficult to get to my main residence. As a result, I returned to my old house in October 1900. There, I set up my white-wood table in a room next to my bedroom. My intellectual activities did not slow down and I put the finishing touches to my final books, including The Chase of the Golden Meteor in 1901 and Master of the World in 1902.”\n\nJules Verne died on 24th March 1905 in this house where he had lived for 14 years. He was buried on 28th March in La Madeleine Cemetery. His funeral was attended by more than 5,000 people and the family received hundreds of messages of condolences. The entire world was in mourning."
