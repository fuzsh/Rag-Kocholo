        "text": "Hardcover. Condition: Fair. 1st Edition. Dated 1887 on the title page, though the book was post-dated 1887, and was actually published in late 1886 in time for the Christmas market, with a publishers catalogue dated October 1886, this is the First Edition of this one of the scarcest of Jules Verne's British Firsts to find, an adventure set in Norway, bound in pictorial cloth covers, titled in gilt, page edges gilded all-round, with the cover illustration in silver and blue, title page states 38 illustrations, but it is noted in Taves & Michaluk's Jules Verne bibliography that there are only thirty seven, all 37 are present, though another point is the illustration listed as being at page 140, is actually at page 149. The covers are rubbed and worn with noticeable dulling to the gilt on the spine, some fraying at spine ends, the lower corner of the upper board is noticeably rubbed and worn with some loss to cloth (see pictures) internally the book does have a forward slight lean, frontispiece tissue guard is foxed with a small piece missing (pictured) wear to a few page edges, and surface wear to some inner page edges, with a few small marks, the illustration at page 129 is worn at edges and has a fairly neat repair to a horizontal tear, also there is a piece missing to top inner plain margin of the same illustration which does not affect the printed area, else contents are in good general condition. Showing some obvious signs of wear and age else remains an acceptable example of one of the harder to find Jules Verne books in First Edition form.\n\nCondition: Good. First edition of the new and cheaper edition. Bound in green cloth with gilt lettering and black illustration of a shipwreck and the drowning hero, Ole who has posted the lottery ticket in a bottle. Gilt lettering to spine. Spine and edges are bumped.38 engravings by A Roux of Norwegian scenes. This is a rare and attractive copy of Jules Verne's Norwegian adventure story.The binding is beginning to crack and the pages are age tanned with occasional foxing but otherwise in good condition. One illustration is detached but present. Good.\n\nAuthor's Copyright Edition, as stated on the titlepage. Publisher's pictorial binding, chipped at ends of the spine, which is also lightly sunned. pp 192 + 198; twelve plates including the frontispiece, which is lightly foxed. Scattered foxing to endpapers and early pages also. Titlepage a touch embrowned. Bookseller's label of George Philip, Fleet Street, laid in at the foot of the front pastedown. Paired with The Archipelago on Fire. This is a rare pairing, apparently not see by the Jules Verne Encyclopedia, nor Myers (M52) or Galagher's (A60) bibliographies, with no copies cited in the JISC holdings or BL: In February 1919, Sampson Low published two works bound in one volume entitled The Lottery Ticket; and the Begum's Fortune, crown 8vo., priced at 2s6d. Also, about the same time Sampson Low published The Lottery Ticket; and Other Stories, which contained the title story and The Flight to France. [Jules Verne Encyclopedia] The JVE also cites a copy paired with The Vanished Diamond. But a copy paired with The Archipelago on Fire it does not reference. Book.\n\nLeatherbound. Condition: NEW.
