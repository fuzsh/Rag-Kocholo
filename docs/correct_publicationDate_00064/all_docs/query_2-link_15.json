        "text": "‘The Begum’s Fortune’ follows the plans of two scientists, the French\n\nphysicist, Sarrasin, and German, Schultz. Each has a share in inheriting a\n\nvast fortune and sets about spending it on the project of their dreams. A\n\nhumanitarian, Sarrasin builds the city, Frankville, dedicated to upholding the\n\nhealth of its citizens. Schultz, however, constructs Steeltown, which is\n\ndevoted to the creation of weapons of war. Astonishingly prescient, ‘The\n\nBegum’s Fortune’ predicts a number of technological advances, including\n\nincendiary bombs, satellites, and even mobile phones. A taut and thought-\n\nprovoking read for those with an interest in dystopian futures.\n\nJules Verne (1828-1905) was a French novelist who became known as the ‘Father\n\nof Science Fiction.’ He wrote more than 60 novels, including ‘Journey to the\n\nCenter of the Earth’ (1864), ‘Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea’ (1870)\n\nwhich was also released as a film, starring James Mason, and ‘Around the World\n\nin Eighty Days’ (1873), which has been released as a TV drama, featuring\n\nformer Dr Who star, David Tennant."
