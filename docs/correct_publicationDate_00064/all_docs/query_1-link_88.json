        "text": "Jules Verne, the Fitzroy editions edited by I. O. Evans and their Jerome Podwil cover illustrations for Ace Books\n\npart 1 of 2 parts\n\nby Steven Williams\n\nJules Verne (1828-1905) was a prolific and highly regarded French writer who is best known to contemporary readers for the his science fiction.\n\nNadar was the pseudonym of Gaspard-Félix Tournachon (1820–1910), a French photographer, caricaturist, journalist, novelist and balloonist. He was an innovator in photography and in 1858 became the first person to take aerial photographs. He also pioneered the use of artificial lighting in photography. His experiments with balloons lead him to the decision that the future of flight was in heavier-than-air machines. In 1863 he founded 'Société d’encouragement de la navigation aérienne au moyen du plus lourd que l’air' (The Society for the Encouragement of Aerial Locomotion by Means of Heavier than Air Machines), with Nadar as honorary president and Verne as secretary. The society's meetings were held at Nadar's photo studio. In addition producing noted photographic portraits of Verne, Nadar's exploits with baloon experimentation inspired Verne's Cinq Semaines en Ballon (Five Weeks in a Balloon) as well as providing the inspiration for Verne's character Michael Ardan in De la Terre à la Lune (From the Earth to the Moon). Nadar is also associated with the development of the Impressionist movement by providing access to his photo studio for the world's first Impressionists exhibit in 1874.\n\nThe publisher Bernard Hanison signed a contract with I. O. Evans (Idrisyn Oliver Evans) in 1958 for a re-introduction of a series of the lesser known Jules Verne books. This contract was signed in the publisher's offices were at 10 Fitzroy Street, London. Fitzroy Street is a very famous street in central London in the heart of Bloomsbury. In the 1920s and 1930s 10 Fitzroy Street was the meeting place of the \"Fitzroy Group\" group of English artists. Unfortunately the building was demolished in the early 1960s. It was this building and street which gave the name The Fitzroy Editions to the Jules Vern novels edited and mostly translated by Evans under the contract with Hanison.\n\nThere are sixty-three titles in the complete Fitzroy Edition series of Verne novels. The initial hardcover printings, with dustjackets, were published by Bernard Hanison (London), ARCO (London), and Associated Booksellers (Westport, Connecticut). There are also ten Fitzroy Edition titles also published in the a paperback series by ACE (New York) notable for their fine and captivating cover artwork by Jerome Podwil.\n\nJerome Podwil, aka Jerry Podwil, is an American artist and illustrator born in New York City in 1938. Podwil attended the Pratt Institute School of Art and Design and the Art Students League from 1955 through 1960. He graduated from the Pratt School in 1960. His cover artwork for fantasy and science fiction, as well as westerns and Gothic thrillers, almost exclusively in their paperback editions, began with the 1960 MacFadden Books' Shannahan's Feud by Al Cody.\n\nAlong with providing art for paperback publishers and various major science fiction magazines, he also sold art to 'Playboy', 'Penthouse' and other major, general interest magazines. His illustratios Playboy and Penthouse for magazine articles is especially notable and includes the artwork for 'The Unholy Alliance' by Thomas de Baggio (Penthouse, February, 1985), an article about then recently declassified documents from World War II revealed links between American big business, particularly Du Pont and General Motors. For an especially relevant and interesting book, see IBM and the Holocaust: The Strategic Alliance Between Nazi Germany and America's Most Powerful Corporation by Edwin Black (Crown, 2001). Podwil's career includes professional recognition in the form of a Gold Medal from the 1970 Society of Illustrators Annual Exhibition, his first prominent national exposure. Podwil went on to receive an Award for Excellence from Chicago shows of the Society of Illustrators in 1974 and another in 1976 as well as a medal from the Communication Arts Annual.\n\nResources\n\nJerome Podwil's Page at BrooklynArtProject.com\n\nJerome Podwil's gallery postings at BrooklynArtProject.com\n\nJerome Podwil's home page at MySpace.com\n\nPublished books with cover art by Jerome Podwil:\n\nShannahan's Feud by Al Cody (1960, MacFadden Books paperback) (western)\n\nThe Coming of the Strangers by John Lymington (1961, Manor Books) (scifi)\n\nThe Desert Killers by Bradford Scott (1961, Pyramid Books paperback) (western)\n\nThe Gun from Nowhere by Tom West (1961, Ace Double paperback) (western)\n\nBorn to Trouble by Nelson Nye (1962, MacFadden paperback) (western)\n\nThe Dying Breed by John Shelley (1962, Berkley Medallion paperback) (western)\n\nGay Girl by Joan Ellis (1962, Tower Publications paperback) (fiction)\n\nOn the Dodge by D.
