        "text": "For those who‚Äôve taken the time to read some of my posts on here, you may know that one aspect of what I do is bring Asian films to theaters in North America. üôå I‚Äôve been doing it for a few years now, and although some aspects of it has gotten easier, for the most part, every international/independent film comes with its own set of challenges. Probably one of the biggest struggles is getting our Asian community to understand that every time we bring an Asian film into mainstream theaters, we‚Äôre competing head-to-head with Hollywood films for screens. So as you can imagine, if theaters are given a choice to play a Hollywood film or an independent/Asian film, I think you can guess the outcome. üòÄ I‚Äôm very motivated to support our international and independent creative voices and 3388 Films and I consistently take lots of risks to try to make this happen on a frequent basis for our communities. But I need your help. We can bring Asian films to North America theaters, but need people to come out and watch them in theaters. As most everything, it‚Äôs a numbers game. If theaters don‚Äôt see the numbers, there‚Äôs really no reason for them to continue to play Asian films. What we have coming to theaters tomorrow, Friday Dec 8, is The Last Wife, directed by Victor Vu, widely considered the most prolific modern-day director in Vietnam. This film is a period drama and is an exquisite ode to the beauty of 19th century Vietnam and the strength of Vietnamese women. The Last Wife will play in over 50 theaters across the U.S and Canada starting tomorrow, Friday Dec 8. I always ask myself: if we don‚Äôt support our communities, who will? I hope to have your support and look forward to seeing you in theaters this opening weekend (Dec 8 - 10) for The Last Wife. ü§û #TheLastWife #NguoiVoCuoiCung #NowPlaying #Distributor #3388Films\n\nIs it time for the international market to reign supreme over domestic? With no end in sight for the SAG-AFTRA/WGA strikes, professionals at Toronto International Film Festival believe that it is. Production has taken a halt (aside from productions who received interim agreements) across the USA and could continue this way well into next year. Several distributors are looking to use international English-speaking films to fill their 2024/2025 roster, leaving those in the USA who are bound to the SAG guidelines to step out of the light. Francesco Rutelli, president of the Italian national audiovisual association Anica, believes that ‚Äúif supply decreases with Hollywood on strike, we need to be ready with our products for the international market as well.\" I believe that the market will be able to fill the gaps with UK and Canadian films, but there are far too many American stars for this to suffice for much longer. This opens an intriguing conversation as to how the industry will look after the strikes end, and if the international market will continue in this direction when the USA is able to produce again.

The lack of experimentation and risk-taking is stifling creativity and holding us back from producing films that truly resonate with global audiences. We need to challenge ourselves to tell more nuanced, complex, and visually stunning stories that showcase the depth and diversity of African experiences. The comfort zone is a seductive trap, and it's easy to get stuck in it. But complacency is the enemy of progress. By embracing new ideas, techniques, and collaborations, we can elevate the standard of African filmmaking and make a lasting impact on the global cinematic landscape. So, let's take a step back and assess our approach. Are we merely replicating the same formulas and styles, or are we pushing the envelope and exploring new frontiers? Are we prioritizing artistic expression over commercial success, or are we sacrificing creativity for the sake of box office returns? It's time to break free from the comfort zone and challenge the norm. Let's collaborate with international filmmakers, experiment with new genres and styles, and invest in innovative storytelling techniques. Let's create films that not only entertain but also educate, inspire, and challenge our audiences. The future of African cinema depends on our willingness to take risks and push the boundaries. So, let's do it. Let's challenge the status quo and create a new wave of African films that will be remembered for generations. #filmmaking #Africanfilms #Africanstories #Africancinema #Africanfilmindustry\n\nIncredibly insightful thoughts about the current situation in the industry and the changes that need to be made. Take some time to read the latest Nostradamus report. If you follow Ted Hope‚Äôs newsletter, you‚Äôll enjoy the insight he adds into this report. Film i Vast‚Äôs Tomas Eskilsson has enlightening thoughts on the current film funding models and the theatrical ecosystem. I enjoyed Robert Franke insight on the creator industry within the film/tv industry. Joanna Szymanska comments on choosing collaborators with smaller budgets because of their qualities as human beings as opposed someone not so friendly who gives you money. Hannah Reifgerst is spot on with her analogy of the opera for adults to the cinemas for teenagers. For many it‚Äôs only affordable for a once a year type of experience. There is so much more wisdom and insights to ponder in the report from: Angela Chan Fatima Djoumer Guillaume Esmiol TABITHA JACKSON Kjersti Mo Gaia Tridente I would have pulled quotes from everyone, but then I would have just copy & pasted the whole report on this post.\n\nRethinking Distribution: A Lesson from \"Everything Everywhere All At Once In today's fast-paced media landscape, timely access to films is crucial for maximizing revenue. Yet, despite the best efforts by the distributors, producers, and filmmakers, the traditional distribution system fails to reach the film‚Äôs maximum audience in an efficient and timely manner. \"Everything Everywhere All At Once,\" the acclaimed 2023 Oscar winner, serves as a prime example. Despite its popularity, it reached only 40% of US theaters at its peak and faced delays of 3-8 months in key international markets like India, leading to a significant loss in audience interest and revenue. MovieSaints research reveals a striking fact: \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" could have seen an additional $170 million in global revenue if it reached the maximum audience at the right time. This isn't just about one film; it's a trend we've noticed across 30 years of Oscars Best Picture winners. Our innovative hybrid model promises to bridge this gap, ensuring films are available to the widest audience at the peak of demand. Take a look at our research and let us know what you think about it - \"Everything Everywhere All At Once‚Äù: https://lnkd.in/eD7QC_jB If you‚Äôre curious about how we are trying to change the film distribution, shoot us an email at - contact@moviesaints.com #FilmDistribution #GlobalCinema #RevenueGrowth #MovieSaints #OscarWinner A24 #EEAAO"
