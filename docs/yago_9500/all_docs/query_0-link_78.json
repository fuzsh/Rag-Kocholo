        "text": "Last Updated on July 28, 2021\n\nToday Montreal’s\n\nFANTASIA FILM FESTIVAL Press Conference\n\ntook place and all the goodies were revealed! For those who don’t know, the\n\nFestival runs from\n\nJuly 7th to July 25th in my home town of hot\n\nchicks/good beer heavy Montreal, Canada and is basically a genre fans wet dream come to\n\nmoist reality. Read below to find out what’s up this year, straight from the Official Fantasia Press\n\nRelease.\n\nINTERNATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n2001 Maniacs, USA, Tim Sullivan,\n\nCanadian Premiere Hosted by Director Tim Sullivan\n\nCo-produced\n\nby Cabin Fever director Eli Roth, Tim Sullivan’s gore soaked and blackly\n\ncomic updating of HG Lewis’ 60’s grindhouse classic 2000 Maniacs has been\n\ndropping people’s jaws wherever it’s unveiled. Travelers take a wrong turn and\n\nwind up in a strange little town comprised of Civil War ghosts from the south –\n\nwho enact a series of outrageously gruesome South Vs North assaults – in this\n\nodd satire that trashes both red states and blue states alike. Features Robert\n\nEngland doing a feature-length George W. Bush impersonation as the town’s\n\nhomicidal mayor!\n\nAntibodies, Germany, Christian Alvart, Canadian Premiere\n\nA dense, involving, and horrific\n\nserial-killer tale from that evolves into a series of chilling religious\n\nparables over the course of its running time, Antibodies ranks one of the\n\nmost unsettling selections of this year’s festival. In spite of featuring one\n\nof the vilest screen villains ever burned into light, the real subject at hand\n\nis the importance of closure and the thin line between madness and normalcy.\n\nStunningly well-directed, there are images and moments in this film that will\n\nhaunt you for a long, long time.\n\nBreaking News, Hong Kong, Johnnie To, Montreal\n\nPremiereThis spectacular film from the great\n\nJohnnie To (a former guest at Fantasia) has deservedly won heaps of prizes on\n\nthe international festival circuit as well as a 2005 Hong Kong Film Critics\n\nSociety Award. Desperate to regain their credibility and newly convinced of the\n\npower and influence of television, a group pf shamed police officers co-opt the\n\nmedium in order to convey their well-intentioned but totally fallacious message.\n\nWaging a simultaneous war on crime and credible news reporting, the police\n\npropaganda machine goes into overdrive. Things go apocalyptically wrong –\n\ncomplete chaos erupts and Hong Kong watches it all unfold on TV! Breaking\n\nNews is a timely and scathing dose of social commentary and a must-see aria\n\nof soulful, tour de force filmmaking.\n\nDevil’s Rejects, USA, Rob\n\nZombie, Canadian Premiere\n\nFantasia is proud to be the site\n\nfor the special Canadian premiere of Rob Zombie’s highly anticipated 2nd\n\nfeature, Devil’s Rejects, a ferocious production that rests halfway\n\nbetween The Wild Bunch, House of 1000 Corpses and Badlands.\n\nThis visceral film, which several prominent journalists have described as what\n\nmight have happened had Sam Peckinpah chosen to direct a visceral horror road\n\nmovie, stars Bill Moseley, Sheri Moon Zombie, Sid Haig, William Forsythe, Ken\n\nForee and Michael Berryman and was made possible by the brave, good people at\n\nLions Gate, Maple Pictures and Christal Films.\n\nEye 2, Hong Kong-Thailand, Danny Pang and Oxide Pang, North\n\nAmerican PremiereThe Pang Brothers’ sequel\n\nto their supernatural mega-hit takes every possible risk and scores powerfully\n\non all counts. Eye 2 bravely bears no relation to the original and\n\nactually manages to surpass much of that film’s nightmarish impact. It is a\n\npoetic, stylish and unsettling mix between Buddhist philosophies and shrieking\n\nsurrealistic terror. For several reasons, it is a film perhaps best avoided by\n\nthe pregnant…\n\nLive Freaky!\n\nDie Freaky!, USA, John Roeker, Canadian Premiere\n\nThere’s no polite way to put this.\n\nLFDF is an ultra-twisted, two-years-in-the-making, very x-rated,\n\nstop-motion animation musical comedy retelling of the Manson crimes (!),\n\nfeaturing more assaulting bad taste than the entire John Waters canon! This\n\ninsane little ditty is the inaugural production of Rancid/Operation Ivy frontman\n\nTim Armstrong’s Hellcat Films. Armstrong also did voice acting – as did members\n\nof Blink 182, AFI, The Lunachicks, Good Charlotte, X, The Transplants and The\n\nGoGo’s, not to mention Kelly Osbourne and Asia Argento! The snarling voice of\n\nGreen Day vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong stars as Manson (now called Hanson)!\n\nYou simply will not believe what you’re seeing. Social taboos and sacred cows\n\nare torn limb from limb, with virtually every frame being calculated to outrage.\n\nNo matter how relaxed you may consider yourself, you will be shocked. The\n\nheight of antisocial punk rock puppet perversity!\n\nNightwatch (Official Closing Film), Russia,\n\nTimur Bekmambetov, Canadian premiere\n\nThe official closing film of Fantasia 2005. Adapted from the popular novel by\n\nSergei Lukyanenko, Night Watch is far and away the biggest domestic\n\nbox-office success in post-Soviet Russia, and was that country’s 2004 contender\n\nfor the Oscar. It boasts action, special effects and production values to match\n\nwhat Hollywood has to offer, a wicked streak of Russian black humor throughout,\n\nand moreover a cast of faces familiar across Russia, pop stars and Soviet-era\n\nicons alike. Night Watch has also redefined the external possibilities of\n\nRussian cinema­. Picked up by Fox Searchlight, this is in fact the first part\n\nof an impressive trilogy, the final episode of which, Twilight Watch,\n\nwill be co-produced by Fox.\n\nPopaganda: The Art & Crimes of Ron English, USA, Pedro Carvajal, Montreal\n\nPremiere\n\nPopaganda\n\nis a priceless documentary on Ron\n\nEnglish, father of Agitpop and a genuine “illegal artist”. Blessed with a\n\nsubversive wit, English takes his art to the billboards of America, replacing\n\nexisting advertisements with his own political and pop-cultural parodies. While\n\nEnglish’s name might not be instantly recognizable to everyone, you’re almost\n\ncertainly familiar with his imagery. One example of many: English designed the\n\nmorbidly obese Ronald McDonald art so memorably featured in Super Size Me.\n\nShot, fittingly, guerilla-style over a span of nearly 10 years, Pedro Carvajal’s\n\ndocumentary covers all phases of English’s eccentric, ongoing career. On the\n\nsubject of confrontational American art, be sure to take a look at the Spoken\n\nWord / Performance Art events we have lined up this year, which includes shows\n\nby Joe Coleman and Stephen R. Bissette\n\nThe Roost, USA, Ti West,\n\nCanadian Premiere, hosted by director Ti West\n\n25-year-old Ti West’s acclaimed\n\nfeature debut is a spookshow love letter to yesterday’s American exploitation\n\nfilm culture, designed to play as if you tuned into it on a late night TV\n\nbroadcast, complete with charming horror host segments featuring Tom Noonan (Manhunter)!\n\nIntervals are comic but West plays all horror elements straight. Gritty and\n\nunusual stuff. It was a huge success at this year’s South By Southwest film\n\nfestival.\n\nStraight Into\n\nDarkness, USA, Jeff Burr, Canadian premiere, Hosted by Director Jeff Burr\n\nA different kind of war film, independently made on a low budget, that\n\nevokes Malick with the contemplative imagery of Robert Frost and the darker\n\nponderings of Edgar Allan Poe as a group of AWOL soldiers seek recluse in the\n\ncenter of madness. Moody, atmospheric, and completely enigmatic, Straight\n\nInto Darkness is a genre-bending work with tremendous conceptual audacity.\n\nWITH BLOOD ON MY HANDS: PUSHER II\n\nDenmark North American Premiere\n\nNine years after exploding onto the Danish film scene with his seminal\n\nnew-wave crime drama Pusher, Nicolas Winding Refn has returned to that\n\nfilm’s shadowy universe with this gripping existential successor.In spite of\n\nfeaturing several A-list stars among its cast, With Blood… was shot quick\n\nand dirty, in an engrossing verité style that adds enormously to the film’s\n\ngrit. Refn is a screenwriter who cares about his characters and with this film,\n\nhe has made a compellingly human entry in the annals of crime cinema, strapped\n\nwith flashes of tragicomedy and a melancholic sense of vulnerability spread wide\n\namongst virtually every figure that walks within its frames. Star Mads\n\nMikkelsen’s intense and honest performance justly won him the 2005 Danish Film\n\nCritic’s Award.\n\nDARK HOURS\n\nCanada MTL Premiere\n\nDirector\n\nPaul Fox, screenwriter Will Zmak and producer Brent Barclay will be present.\n\nAn amazing film – from Canada, no less – that might prove to be the single most\n\npowerful horror production to emerge from any country this year. The Dark\n\nHours depicts the ordeal of a criminal psychiatrist and her family being\n\nheld hostage by a vicious former patient. We dare not spoil a frame more in\n\nsynopsis. Dark Hours is a harrowing portrait of psychological mutation in\n\nthe face of physical decay, anchored with strong, authentic characters. At\n\ntimes, the film is almost unbearable in its intensity. Director Paul Fox is a\n\nhuge emerging talent. Not since the arrivals of John Fawcett and Vincenzo\n\nNatali has there been such an exciting new voice in Canadian horror cinema.\n\nEL LOBO\n\nSpain CDN Premiere\n\nThis edgy period thriller, Spain’s 2nd top grossing film of last\n\nyear, blasts cleansing light on the true story of Mikel Lejarza, a small-time\n\nfelon who, under the code name Lobo (\"wolf\"), infiltrated the fierce Basque\n\nterrorist group ETA’s highest level and caused more damage to the outfit then\n\nthe entire Spanish police force were ever capable of. Stars Eduardo Noriega (Open\n\nYour Eyes, Devil’s Backbone…), was co-produced by journalist Melchor\n\nMiralles, and was directed in the best Costa Gavras tradition by French\n\nfilmmaker Miguel Courtois, famous for having been publicly threatened by right\n\nwing maniac Jean-Marie Le Pen.\n\nKARAOKE TERROR\n\nJapan MTL Premiere\n\nThis supremely subversive social satire, based on a novel by the notorious Ryu\n\nMurakami (director of Tokyo Decadence, writer of Audition),\n\ndepicts a bloody, escalating street war between angry young \"droogs\" and\n\nwealthy, middle-aged women! Far from what the title might imply, this is a very\n\nsmart, introspective and often whisper-quiet work. Its humour is tinged with\n\nmelancholic poetry, its cruelest and most provocative blows are delivered in a\n\ntone of near-hypnotic tranquility. Just the same, the film is perfectly at ease\n\nwith exploding into absurdist set-pieces and ultra-violence whenever it feels\n\nlike it, making for a consistently surprising and ultimately apocalyptic viewing\n\nexperience.\n\nSURVIVE STYLE 5 +\n\nJapan CDN Premiere\n\nEasily the wildest and most inventive film of Fantasia 2005. Former cult\n\nadvertisers Gen Sekiguchi & Taku Tada’s already-legendary feature debut hits\n\nhome with five highly bent stories of rampant crime, undying love, hypnotism\n\ngone wrong and failed body disposals, all criss-crossing into one another..\n\nVisually dazzling, daringly experimental and wittily scripted, this eccentric\n\ncomedy masterpiece plays like a blender crush between the sensibilities of Sabu,\n\nTodd Solondz, Takashi Miike, Monty Python, Vermillion Pleasure Night and Gregg\n\nAraki. An absolute must-see!\n\nSHUTTER\n\nThailand CDN Premiere\n\nOne of the most commercially successful productions in the history of Thai\n\ncinema. Fox-Regency have already signed up for a US remake! Without giving too\n\nmuch away, Shutter concerns a photographer and his girlfirned haunted by\n\nghostly apparitions in photographic work, after a recent hit and run accident.\n\nAside from using the familiar for calculated misdirection in order to take its\n\nthemes to surprising, unexpected places, the film is notable for having\n\nincorporated actual examples of spirit (or ghost) photography in several key\n\nsequences. It is Thai horror in the grandest tradition.\n\nTROUBLE\n\nBelgium North American premiere\n\nWriter / Director Harry Cleven will be present\n\nGripping existential horror with spikes of perverse, dark wit .is the order of\n\nthe day in this baroque chiller from veteran Zulawski actor-turned-director\n\nHarry Cleven. What would you do if you were informed out of the blue that you\n\nhad a long-lost identical twin? This is the creepy situation that successful\n\nphotographer Matyas (La Pianiste’s Benoît Magimel), freshly settled into\n\na new family life, finds himself in. The mere revelation brings back\n\nuncomfortable childhood memories and cracks begin to form in his seemingly\n\nperfect home life. Upon meeting Thomas, his twin, Matyas becomes disoriented and\n\nslightly delusional. Thomas seems like a calmer, more perfected and much more\n\ncontrolled version of himself. The twin instantly wins over Matyas’ pregnant\n\nwife Claire (Criminal Lovers’s Natasha Régnier), and their son Pierre.\n\nMatters gradually evolve into an understated dream tone. Identities begin to\n\nblur. A chilling series of events are set into motion. Trouble is a\n\nfascinating, disquieting piece of work that should be of particular interest to\n\nfans of early Polanski.\n\nWITH BLOOD ON MY HANDS: PUSHER II\n\nDenmark North American Premiere\n\nNine years after exploding onto the Danish film scene with his seminal\n\nnew-wave crime drama Pusher, Nicolas Winding Refn has returned to that\n\nfilm’s shadowy universe with this gripping existential successor. In spite of\n\nfeaturing several A-list stars among its cast, With Blood… was shot quick\n\nand dirty, in an engrossing verité style that adds enormously to the film’s\n\ngrit. Refn is a screenwriter who cares about his characters and with this film,\n\nhe has made a compellingly human entry in the annals of crime cinema, strapped\n\nwith flashes of tragicomedy and a melancholic sense of vulnerability spread wide\n\namongst virtually every figure that walks within its frames. Star Mads\n\nMikkelsen’s intense and honest performance justly won him the 2005 Danish Film\n\nCritic’s Award.\n\nThis year at\n\nFantasia, national representative director Im Kwon-Tack returns to his\n\naction-flick roots with Low Life: In the early days after WWII, an\n\nangry, fearless youth from a broken home raids a rival high school to settle a\n\nscore with his fists. Low Life follows the vibrant life and times\n\nof a remarkable man, but it’s no hagiography, nor is it an attempt to have a man\n\nstand in for his nation in trying times. Low Life was\n\ninvited into official competition at the 57th Cannes festival.\n\nMaverick\n\nKorean director Ryoo Seung-Wan\n\nis behind one of this year’s opening films, Crying Fist, which\n\ntreads turf familiar to fans of his\n\nearlier efforts Die Bad and No Blood No Tears. Relentlessly tough\n\nand emotionally raw and accurate, Crying Fist is built upon a brilliantly\n\nsimple device—tell the separate stories of two desperate men, and then devote\n\nthe third act to their confrontation, from which only one can emerge victorious.\n\nCrying Fist won a jury prize in the section of Director’s Fortnight at 58th\n\nCannes, 2005.\n\nTwo social action films from Kang\n\nWoo-Suk, the director who brought us the inimitable Public Enemy, are\n\nAnother Public Enemy and the powerful true story Silmido:\n\nin 1968 the South Korean intelligence\n\nservice press-ganged 31 men, mostly convicted criminals, into a fierce training\n\nregimen for their intended assignment—punch deep into North Korea and kill the\n\n“Great Leader” Kim Il-sung. Unit 684, as they were called, had become a\n\ndangerous burden to the South Korean leadership as the mission was scuttled by\n\npolitical changes. They’re trapped on the isolated island Silmido...\n\nFrom\n\nthe same director of Crying Fist, Ryoo’s previous film, Arahan,\n\nis bellylaughs and fisticuffs—a\n\npotent mix of comedy and fantasy action, taking the\n\nconcept of the philosophical kung-fu comedy and putting a distinctive Korean\n\nspin on it.\n\nFighter in the Wind,\n\nfrom director Yang Yun-ho, is\n\nbased on\n\nthe true-life story of Choi Baedal, also known as Masutatsu Oyama, a fierce\n\nfighter from Korea who stunned and excited Japan by winning 270 martial-arts\n\nfights in a campaign to be the nation’s greatest, and later established the\n\nKyokushin Karate school, training Sonny Chiba among others. But it’s actually\n\nadapted more directly from a popular Korean comic strip, and just the right\n\nliberties have been taken with Choi’s tale.\n\nCheck out the chilly Three…\n\nExtremes, R-Point, Some (Director Jang Yun-Hyun, from the film Tell\n\nMe Something) and Spider Forest by the renowned director Song\n\nIl-Gon, a modern-day fairy tale for\n\nadults, perhaps even a love story, though one with a number of shocks and an\n\neerie, constant atmosphere of foreboding. TV producer Kang Min comes to in a\n\nforest, not far from a desolate cabin. There, he finds the brutally butchered\n\nbody of a middle-aged man, and in another room, his girlfriend Su-yeong, on the\n\nverge of death and gripped by nameless dread…\n\nA groundbreaking and important film in the\n\nhistory of Asian cinema, as it marks the first theatrical animation\n\ncollaboration between Japan and Korea is Phantom Master: Dark Hero From\n\nRuined Empire.\n\nThere’s also the delightful romantic comedies Please Teach Me English,\n\nGhost House, the modern\n\nAsian gangster film Marrying the Mafia,and\n\nfinally, get a kick out of… Spin Kick!\n\nFor the first time ever, Fantasia\n\nwill present a Korean television drama. Most of Asia and Europe have already\n\nbeen introduced to Dae Jang-Geum, AKA A Jewel in the Palace.\n\nOne of the most popular dramatic series in Korean history, it gained notoriety\n\nafter its phenomenal impact in Hong Kong. Restaurant owners cried that they were\n\nlosing business because nobody went out to eat while the show was on! Based on\n\nthe true story of a 16th-century woman who became the supreme royal\n\nphysician, it stars Lee Young-Ae, who played the leading role in JSA\n\n(Fantasia 2001) and now stars in Park Chan-Wook’s new film, Sympathy for Ms.\n\nVengeance. As a gift to our loyal audience, Fantasia will present\n\nHighlights of Dae Jang-Geum, four back-to-back episodes specially packaged\n\nby MBC (Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation). While some scenes have been cut for\n\nthe sake of narrative clarity, the story maintains its originality and charm.\n\nIn a broader view of Korean\n\ntelevision drama, Fantasia knows that Dae Jang-Geum was not the only\n\npopular series in 2002. The soap opera Winter Sonata broke ratings\n\nrecords in Japan and Korea. The star of that show, Bae Yong-Jun, is said to have\n\nsurpassed Brad Pitt’s celebrity status. The setting of the series, Nami Island\n\nand the village, Chuncheon, have become major tourist attractions; every day\n\nmore than 300 people visit the area.\n\nThe new wave of Korean television\n\ndrama isn’t subsiding yet. New and increasingly sensational stories are being\n\nintroduced, including the soap opera Fall Story (which Hollywood has\n\nacquired the remake rights to), the epic martial arts fantasy Damo and\n\nHeo Jun, the touching true-life story of a traditional Korean doctor.\n\nPopular throughout Asia, Korean television has recently been influenced by and,\n\nin turn, influential on the film industry in terms of visual quality, production\n\nscale and international marketing.\n\nJAPANESE\n\nFILMS:\n\nAshura,\n\nJapan, Yojiro Takita, 2005, InternationalPremiere\n\nThis visually rich and captivating film is a\n\ndirect adaptation of a tremendously successful recent stage play which drew on\n\nboth the classic kabuki theatre and contemporary trends in Japanese pop culture.\n\nThe result is a magnificent, exciting and ultimately heartbreaking spectacle.\n\nFierce action and tragic romance, myth, magic and magnificent visual splendour—Ashura\n\noffers it all!\n\nGodzilla:\n\nFinal Wars, Japan, Ryuhei Kitamura, 2005, Canadian premiere\n\nWhat better way to celebrate the 50th\n\nanniversary of Godzilla than to go all the way. With 15 monsters in one single\n\nfilm, Godzilla: Final Wars features all the favourites. To helm the\n\nmagnum opus, Toho hired the sensation of the moment Ryuhei Kitamura (Versus,\n\nAragami: The Raging God of Battle and Azumi).\n\nIzo, Japan, Takashi Miike, 2004\n\nFrom the hyper-prolific,\n\ngenre-jumping, deliberately challenging, always surprising bad boy of Japanese\n\npop-art cinema, Takashi Miike, comes Izo—a mind-blowing, metaphysical rumination\n\non the never-ending cycle of life and death and the unshakable drive to violence\n\nin our species that just happens to be a ferocious, unpredictable barrage of\n\nsurreal, gory Japanese action that shifts in time and space as though God\n\nhimself is channel-surfing.\n\nKaraoke\n\nTerror, Japan, Tetsuo Shinohara, 2004\n\nWhile hilarious in places and extreme in others, Karaoke Terror is a very\n\nsmart, introspective and often whisper-quiet work. the film is perfectly at ease\n\nwith exploding into absurdist set-pieces and ultra-violence whenever it feels\n\nlike it, making for a consistently surprising and ultimately apocalyptic viewing\n\nexperience. It also boasts the most shockingly nihilistic ending of anything at\n\nthis year’s fest.\n\nMind Game, Japan, Yuasa Masaaki, 2004\n\nA Japanese anime film\n\nunlike any other, Mindgame is closer to Yellow Submarine and Waking Life than to\n\nanything with giant robots and big-eyed schoolgirls. Its wild, free-association\n\nnarrative swings vertiginously from one tangent to the next, from a noodle bar\n\nto heaven (where God appears in infinite guises) to the belly of a whale to a\n\nfantastic planet in the far reaches of space—and right back to modern Japan,\n\nwhere the whole thing ties up gracefully with a solid point. The crew\n\nresponsible previously did the excellent shorts “Cat Soup” and “Noiseman Sound\n\nInsect.” Colourful, shocking, beautiful, hilarious and philosophical—a\n\npsychedelic animation masterpiece.\n\nTaste of Tea, Japan, Katsuhito Ishii, 2004\n\nKatsuhito Ishii (Shark Skin Man and Peach Hip Girl, Party 7) is\n\nresponsible here for an outlandish and entirely unexpected work, a magical, mind\n\nbending auteur film that didn’t fail to stun and surprise when it opened the\n\nQuinzaine des Réalisateur at the prestigious Cannes festival in 2004. Somewhere\n\nbetween magic realism, an inspired humanism and unhinged comedy as funny as it\n\nis weird, The Taste of Tea is a strangely distracting film of such\n\nhaunting quality.\n\nHONG KONG FILMS:\n\nOne Night in Mongkok, Hong Kong, Derek Yee,\n\n2004, Canadian Premiere\n\nThe Mongkok\n\nneighbourhood is one of Hong Kong’s most\n\nfascinating corners. Now it’s the turn of Derek Yee (Lost in Time,\n\nDouble Tap, Viva Erotica) to pay homage to this edgy, nocturnal\n\nenvironment, famous for being one of the most densely populated places in the\n\nworld. With Yee’s decision to have the film take place in a very concentrated\n\narea, over a very limited span of time, Mongkok becomes, in a way, a character\n\nin itself. The neighbourhood’s chaos bears witness to the anonymous tragedies of\n\nits inhabitants—behind this breathless film noir, intersecting with a desperate\n\nromance, there lies a vivid sociological assessment of those who survive as they\n\ncan on the fringes of modern Hong Kong. At the last Hong Kong Film Awards (Hong\n\nKong’ “Oscars”), One Nite in Mongkok took home prizes for both best\n\ndirection and best screenplay.\n\nBreaking News,\n\nHong Kong, Johnnie To, 2004\n\nThis lively and energetic film has everything\n\nyou could want from a Johnnie To film, including satirical social commentary,\n\nrelentless camerawork, split-screen shenanigans, and playful camera movements of\n\nevery kind. Even at the age of 50, Johnnie To offers excitement and hope for the\n\nfuture of Hong Kong action cinema. Winner, Hong Kong Film Critics Society Award\n\n2005.\n\nWhite Dragon, Hong Kong, Wilson\n\nYip, 2004, Canadian Premiere\n\nA lighthearted, smirking kung-fu farce,\n\nWhite Dragon is mixing the modern and the classic in a wild and\n\nhigh-spirited way while running roughshod over the clichés of the\n\nsilk-and-swords genre (the famous “Wu Xia Pan”). Featuring Francis Ng, White\n\nDragon is directed by Wilson Yip, who previously delivered the memorable\n\nBullets Over Summer and Juliet In Love, also with Francis Ng.\n\nLove Battlefield, Hong Kong, Cheang Pou-soi,\n\n2004, Canadian Premiere\n\nEarning a special mention at this year’s Hong\n\nKong Film Critics’ Society Awards, Love Battlefield lies somewhere\n\nbetween drama, romance and the post-Johnnie To police movie. Love Battlefield\n\nis a straightforward, sentimental work that mixes the aesthetic compositions of\n\nHong Kong cinema with the social realism of China’s. An agreeable surprise, far\n\nfrom the glitzy baubles of Hong Kong’s tendencies these days.\n\nThree Extremes,\n\nHong Kong, Japan, Korea, Fruit Chan, 2004\n\nThree… Extremes\n\nis a transgressive trilogy of medium-length short films from South Korea, Japan\n\nand Hong Kong, each an assaulting exploration of egoism, with shared imagery\n\nrevolving around destruction/rejuvenation of the flesh, and a shattered\n\nentertainer at its core. The most disturbing entry is Fruit Chan’s Dumplings,\n\nwhich proved so strong that the filmmaker released a longer, feature-length\n\nversion in his homeland. Hong Kong’s art house auteur has delivered what might\n\nwell be the most confrontational horror fable in recent memory.\n\nFollowing the wild success of the last two\n\nyear’s Shaw Brothers special presentations, The Fantasia Festival is proud to\n\npresent 3 new remastered copies of some of Shaw Brothers’s golden gems.\n\nNew One Armed Swordsman,\n\nHong Kong, Chang Cheh 1971\n\nHeroes of the East,\n\nHong Kong, Liu Chia-Liang, 1975\n\nShaolin Temple,\n\nHong Kong, Chang Cheh, 1976\n\nFinally, Fantasia will present 1973’s Way\n\nof the Dragon, which represents\n\nLee‘s\n\nonly venture as a director, with a new remastered video copy restored here in\n\nMontreal by Vision Globale.\n\nSPECIAL GUESTS\n\nOn July 8, the Japanese director\n\nand screenwriter Masaaki Yuasa, whose experimental Nekojiro-so was\n\na big success at Fantasia 2001, will present his animated masterpiece Mind\n\nGame.\n\nSeung-wan Ryoo\n\nwill present another film on July 9, the Canadian premiere of Arahan,\n\nwhich was completed in 2004 and has since received the Jury Prize for Best\n\nFeature at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival.\n\nTim Sullivan,\n\nthe American screenwriter and director of 2001 Maniacs, will be in\n\nattendance for the Canadian premiere on July 9.\n\nScreenwriter and director Jeff\n\nBurr will introduce the Canadian premiere of his American feature\n\nStraight Into Darkness on July 11.\n\n06 Tiros, 60 ml,\n\npart of the short-film show International DIY, screening on July 11, will\n\nbe introduced as an international premiere by its Brazilian screenwriter and\n\ndirector, André Kapel, who is also one of Brazil’s top FX artist.\n\nClark Balderson,\n\nproducer of Firecracker, will present this American movie, winner of the\n\nJury Prize, Best Actress (Karen Black) at Fantasporto 2005 festival.\n\nThe co-director of the Thaï\n\nfeature Zee Oui, Buranee Rachjaibun, will be in attendance for the\n\nscreening of the movie on July 13.\n\nThe Dark Hours,\n\na Canadian feature, will be introduced on July 14 by its director, Paul Fox,\n\nits producer, Brent Barclay, as well as its screenwriter, Wil\n\nZmak.
