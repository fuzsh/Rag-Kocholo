        "text": "April 18, 2023\n\n(Note from 4/17/2023 So someone reported this for unmarked spoilers even tho I prefaced it lol so the spoilers will be marked where they are, even though they really aren't spoilers at all because they do not significantly affect the plot in any way but oh well. It's either do this or have the entire review hidden bc of spoilers)\n\n(Note from 2/21/2023 because I apparently have to spell it out: For those of you who don't read comments or check dates read, I read and reviewed this book in 2018. It has been about 5 years; as I have stated in a number of comments, I will not continue this series. In the intervening years since reading this, my feelings on the matter have not changed nor have I desired to continue. Please refrain from commenting about how I need to continue the series or that I did not understand the book. I receive too many of those comments and I'm tired of replying the same thing over and over again. This review is for me first and foremost, not you. Please move on if you do not like my take.)\n\nMe to Sarah J Maas:\n\n\"Do you lie awake at night to come up with all your witty replies for the following day?\"\n\nOh dear, this is awful.\n\nThe Writing\n\nThe title of this book is stupid. It's stupid and flashy and unrelated to the actual content of the book. It's solely for the ~wow~ factor. The quotable line, \"I love you... Thorns and all\" is wholely ineffective because \"thorns\" had not been established as a motif and was only used in that context in that very scene, more than halfway through the book. The word \"thorn\" was only used a grand total of 9 times in this book. The original Beauty and the Beast story had established rose motifs—you can't borrow good writing, even for a retelling. That's just lazy.\n\nThe writing itself was inconsistent and poorly done.\n\nI pushed and pulled, but the mud was too slick, and held fast.\n\nAre you aware of the definition of \"slick\", Sarah J Maas? I do not think it means what you think it means.\n\nBesides that, Amarantha's hair drastically changed color after about 90 pages:\n\nHer red-gold hair\n\nHer black hair\n\nWhich is it, Maas? It can't be both unless she has unmentioned magical hair dyeing abilities.\n\nThe atmosphere and the opening chapter were excellent and I was intrigued by the idea that was offered me, but the actual book did not deliver at all.\n\nThis next point is a spoiler, but because I am disgusted with Sarah J Maas for including this, I am not going to mark it as such, since everyone should know what kind of morals this book is supporting before they read it especially when they are as filthy and vulgar as this was.\n\nThe attempted rape of Feyre by Tamlin was brushed off as no more than a mere romantic, steamy encounter to further their lukewarm love story. The only conclusions I can logically draw from this are all rather victim blamey, tbh—she was warned several times to stay inside with the doors locked until dawn, but she leaves her room not once but twice before dawn because she ~wants to go to the party~ and then later, after she almost gets gang-raped and is saved and then creeped out by Rhysand the sociopath, she thinks she is totally safe to go eat a bunch of cookies because, well the drums stopped, so it's probably okay now, and then she gets sexually assaulted by Tamlin, who was still high with lust magic.\n\nI was about to pass out when he grabbed me, so fast I didn't see anything until he had me pinned against the wall.\n\n\"Let go,\" I said as evenly as I could.\n\nI [pushed] him away. He grabbed my hands again and bit my neck. I cried out as his teeth clamped onto the tender spot where my neck met my shoulder. I couldn't move—I couldn't think.\n\nBefore, during and after the attack, she's thinking, Wow, he's really hot. I'm kinda uncomfortable with this, but I guess it's okay that he's drunk on lust magic, because I wanted to sleep with him anyway. That is a very wrong and dangerous way of thinking. No matter what, it is never okay for anyone to make someone else sexually uncomfortable or afraid, especially when they've given verbal disapproval. This entire scene left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nAnd then there's Rhysand's behavior. He repeatedly violates her personal space and comfort, drugging her and forcing her to \"dance\" for him in front of a large crowd for weeks on end after stripping her all but naked. Like all Fae males, apparently, he uses brute force to get her to comply with his sexual wishes.\n\n\"But he didn't actually touch her; he kept his hands just on her waist!\" you say. Yeah, but did she say he could touch her at all? Did she actively encourage him to touch her? No, she did not.\n\nI pulled away, but his hands were like shackles.\n\nI would not have such an issue with this if Sarah J Maas didn't give the impression that she supports such behavior. That is what I find unconscionable.\n\nBesides that, the plot made no sense, even after exposition-Alis gave us the lowdown—in fact, it almost made less sense then. It was cheesy and cliché and frankly, boring. The \"riddle\" was extremely easy and only proved that Feyre is an absolute idiot with no logical abilities, as I was able to figure it out before Amarantha had even finished saying it, and I'm notoriously bad at riddles.\n\nThe sex scenes were almost Empire of Storms levels of bad, cringey, and gross. I think Sarah J Maas doesn't know what YA means and isn't aware she's actually writing for NA.\n\nThe Worldbuilding\n\nThe Fae were, for one thing, almost exactly the same (primarily in appearance and personality) to the ones in the Throne of Glass series, and tbh I was disappointed. They're not even cleverly unique faeries. They're just Tolkien-esque elves that are actually vampires: fangs and biting, immortality, aetherial beauty, animalistic tendencies, superiority complex. They don't have any distinct differences from humans in their thought processes or emotional capacities—only the same degree of variety that exists in humans.\n\nThe religious system and creation story was very interesting and I really liked that aspect.\n\nThe Characters\n\nFaerie aka Belle: Sarah J Maas decided to try something new and have a first-person fixed perspective, but it didn't really work, because Feyre was a bland complacent character without much substance passed the surface level, and most of the interesting action took place where she couldn't see it. She suffered, like Celaena did in Crown of Midnight, from what I call Nehemia syndrome: the character that the MC has grown to trust, despite obvious suspicious behavior, turns out to be manipulative, and yet the MC completely overlooks that fact in favor of idolization of their lying friend. In this case, everyone in Prythian is keeping secrets from her and after almost getting her questions answered by the Suriel, Feyre decides to \"Stay with the High Lord. He will keep you safe,\" and just completely forgets that she wants answers about the blight. Also, whereas Belle left the Beast in the original story because her father was in mortal danger, in this book, Feyre leaves because Tamlin impies that she's gonna get ganked by Rhys or Amarantha, the evil Faerie Queen. She is not an active protagonist. Also, her painting skills aren't a part of her characterization; it just feels tacked on to make her ~cool~ and ~unique~\n\nTampon aka the Beast: I don't even care about this guy tbh. He's a confusing character who just feels like a Chaol-Rowan merge on steroids. He's violent, obsessive, and abusive, but also sweet, understanding, and caring, because that's not a contradiction. There's a difference between a complex character and a poorly written character.\n\nLucien aka Lumiere/Cogsworth (his steampunk eye suggests Cogsworth but his personality suggests Lumiere): So apparently he \"hates\" Feyre even though I almost shipped them more since they consistently had better chemistry than her and Tammy, and that's saying a lot, because they didn't have chemistry.\n\nexposition-Alis aka Mrs Potts: She was okay. Just okay. She was fine.\n\nReese's Cups aka also the Beast and kinda Gaston too: Is he supposed to be her love interest for the rest of the series or something, because the fan art definitely suggests that, but, uh, did everyone forget that he's a dangerous sociopath with a history of violence?? He has no regard for her emotional well-being and sees her body as literally nothing beyond a sexual plaything. He's a horrible person.\n\nAmarantha: Why did there have to be a \"big bad evil Faerie Queen\" in this at all? There's already one in the Throne of Glass series and I can only take so much female-against-female hate from a supposedly feminist fantasy writer. Amarantha was bland and predictable, and her motivations were extremely surface-level.\n\nHer fam: Nesta was like, supposed to have some kind of implied character arc but lol it wasn't very good. Elain was nice and I liked her. The dad was okay, I guess. Pretty forgettable tbh\n\nIsaac Hale aka fake-out Gaston: This character wasn't important at all, but I just wanted to say that I think this is the dumbest name choice in a high fantasy book that I've ever seen. Isaac Hale?? Really, Sarah J Maas? Really? That's the Jason of fantasy names. This is a the-guy-who-went-to-high-school-with-my-older-sister kind of name. It's not a fantasy name.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile I managed to read it fairly quickly, I had to dnf it for several days before deciding to trudge through. It was horrendous. I may pick up the sequel at some point, idk, but for now, from what I predict and understand from various spoilers I've encountered on the internet, I don't really care about this series very much. Frankly, it's not good.\n\nMay 5, 2021\n\nThat was both horrible and incredible at the same time, and my thoughts are a whirlwind.\n\nNote: The first part of this review is spoiler-free, but the second half is most definitely not. The spoilery section is blocked off by siren emojis (🚨). Skip to the end for bonus content, including an ACOTAR rap written by yours truly.\n\nThis is the story of a mortal girl, Feyre, who kills a Fae in the woods one day. She’s whisked away to Prythian, home of the Fae, where she will live the rest of her days as punishment for murdering the wolf.\n\nWhoever said this was a Beauty and the Beast retelling is clearly not okay. This is far from a retelling, because it takes all the important themes out and leaves just the bare plotline:\n\n1. The Beast (Tamlin) is not ugly or even a beast at all. He just has a mask stuck to his face forever as part of a curse that I will get into more in the spoilery section.\n\n2. We are not aware of any good reason for Tamlin to keep Feyre until the very end, and it’s still a flimsy reason (this relates back to the curse).\n\nThe problem with the plot is that the foreshadowing is so faint. The plot in the beginning and up until the 75 percent mark makes no sense at all. Tamlin takes Feyre to live in luxury, with good food and nice clothes and freedom, because she killed his fellow Fae? It’s just nonsensical. How is that a punishment at all? She no longer has to care for her spoiled sisters, she’s away from the poor village.\n\nHowever, it does make sense in the end, but Feyre is very naive for believing all of this. Something doesn’t add up. People who DNF this book will be very confused indeed.\n\nIn Beauty and the Beast, we know of the curse beforehand, so we can find a good reason for the Beast to be kind to Belle. But Tamlin? It’s a mystery.\n\nSo anyway, Feyre gets taken to a land of luxury to live out the rest of her days in comfort as “punishment,” but she’s still not happy because for some reason she misses her sisters, even though they treated her like dirt.\n\nShe falls in love with Tamlin, which was expected because he’s not a Beast. There’s no barrier to overcome here. She isn’t forced to look past his ugly exterior because he has no ugly exterior.\n\nAlong the way, another Fae named Lucien conveniently reveals everything Feyre needs to know right before it happens. This is supposed to be foreshadowing? I think? But in the end, he makes things so easy for Feyre and there’s no conflict whatsoever. The only problems arise from Feyre’s own stupidity.\n\nTheir exchanges basically go like this:\n\nLucien: The Suriel are super dangerous and even hard for the Fae to trap so stay away.\n\nFeyre: *makes simple snare* *kills chicken* oOpS I caught one, what a coincidence!!\n\nEverything is far too easy for Feyre.\n\nShe’s supposed to be a responsible hunter, but instead she makes stupid, reckless decisions that don’t line up with her character. She follows an illusion of her father despite being told it’s fake, she goes outside on Fire Night, she chases the Suriel, she goes after Tamlin… etc. If you tell her not to do something, she will do it.\n\nLucien: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.\n\nTamlin: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.\n\nLiterally everyone ever: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.\n\nFeyre: *gets a midnight snack*\n\nFeyre is trying to figure out the details of this blight that’s supposed to be taking over Prythian, but luckily for her, Lucien and Tamlin give everything away with no struggle whatsoever.\n\nThe result is that the danger does not feel genuine. It feels like a cheesy way to add angst to the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin.\n\nSpeaking of Tamlin, everyone hates him so much but he’s such a sweetheart. I know that he gets worse in ACOMAF, but there’s nothing wrong with him in this book. He may be a little bland, but he’s much better than Rhysand. More details in the spoilery section.\n\nAnd then we have the writing, which is just bad. “...” is used in every other sentence, the poor em dashes are abused, and Feyre’s bones bark. A lot. Like, every time she falls down, she describes her barking bones. And what’s up with the phrase “my bowels turned watery?” It’s used at least twice and I don’t like it at all. This is not Shatter Me.\n\n🚨🚨🚨SPOILER ALERT🚨🚨🚨\n\nSo, what’s up with Amarantha?\n\nI really do like her. She’s a compelling villain because she’s (somewhat) realistic. Sure, she tortures people for fun, but her backstory makes this seem (somewhat) reasonable. (Somewhat.)\n\nBasically, she kidnaps Tamlin and Feyre runs after them because she has no self-preservation instinct. She challenges Amarantha, and in return, she is given three trials. If she wins them all, she and Tamlin will be free and his powers will return. If she loses… well, Amarantha keeps saying that there wouldn’t be enough left of Feyre to burn.\n\nHowever, Amarantha gives her a different option. She could solve a riddle.\n\nThis is when things go downhill. First of all, why would Amarantha bet all her power and might on a simple riddle? It’s not even that hard to solve. The riddle itself is bad. The rhyming pattern isn’t great. And worst of all, the answer?\n\nIt’s love.\n\nThe answer is love.\n\nHow does this make sense? Amarantha is a brutal, sadistic villain, so why would she write such a cliche, cheesy riddle? She should have made it oddly specific so Feyre would never get it.\n\nAnyway, Feyre answers it correctly at the last minute, Amarantha loses all her power, and Tamlin kills her.\n\nIt was far too easy.\n\nMoving onto Rhysand. I hate him with a burning passion. He’s a greasy, crusty, dusty, musty old man. I can’t believe Feysand is the endgame ship. I’m suing. This is ridiculous. I don’t understand how people love him. He’s abusive, uncomfy, and weird.\n\nPeople keep telling me that I will love Rhysand in ACOMAF and hate Tamlin. First of all, I highly doubt it.\n\nSecond of all, if you have to rely on making one character a villain just to get people to like the other character, that’s bad writing.\n\nFinally, the curse is so specific and random. Tamlin has to fall in love with a mortal girl who hates the Fae so much that she killed one in cold blood, and he has to wear a mask, and she can't know it's a curse.\n\n🚨🚨🚨END OF SPOILERS🚨🚨🚨\n\nIn conclusion: Feyre is an idiot, Tamlin is precious, and Rhysand deserves to rot in a hole.\n\nAlso, I wrote a rap. It’s called *prim coughing fit* Feyre Darling.

DNF at 30% because I just got fed up with things moving at a snail's pace and NOT MAKING SENSE AT ALL. This was one of the most uncompelling versions of Beauty and the Beast that I have ever read. The writing is nothing outstanding, there was nothing that moved me. I felt Cruel Beauty among other B&B retellings I've read this year and last have done a far superior job at moving me emotionally.\n\nLook, I'm sure by the end of the book, all the things tie together and everything's just dandy and things will make sense, and I'd be like \"ooooooh, so that's why ____.\" Me, I don't care. Ain't nobody got time for that. I have so many questions and I'm just fed up. This is not a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. This is a book about a girl who gets to live an easy life with a guy who's implied to be a gorgeous Fae underneath his mask.\n\nThe original story makes sense: here's roughly how it goes. Handsome prince is cursed to be ugly unless he gets a chick to fall for him. Flash forward, there's Belle's dad. Belle's dad wanders into Beast's castle and touches his stuff. Beast doesn't like the fact that Belle's dad touched his stuff. Beast is going to kill Belle's dad unless he gets Beast some pussy. Belle's valiantly steps in to save dad, Beast is as nice to her as much as a hairy ugly, self-conscious, socially ostracized monster can be. Belle is treated like a princess because Beast really, really fucking needs her to save him and his people before the curse runs out!\n\nThere's a reason Belle is treated like the queen! Things make sense! They have to learn to trust one another. Things are slowly developed an built over time. There is a hideous beast who is scarred emotionally, and a beauty who needs to look past the exterior. There is a point. Not so with this book. Things are far, far too easy with this book.\n\nNow here's this version of Beauty and the Beast, a retelling that tries to be bad-ass and fails completely, from the little that I have read.\n\nThere's Feyre who has a pretty crappy life with an absentminded, worthless, spineless dad, and two of the most bitchy, ungrateful sisters in the entire world. She slaves for them, she hunts food for them, she works her ass off for them. Without her, their family would starve. They don't care. I feel some pity for her, but she acts like so much of a martyr that there's only so much I can take.\n\nWhile hunting one day, Feyre kills a wolf, well, surprise, surprise, that wolf turns out to be a Fae in disguise. In return for this kill, Feyre is taken by a wolf (who's a Fae in disguise) away from her family.\n\n“What is the payment the Treaty requires?”\n\nHis eyes didn’t leave my face as he said, “A life for a life. Any unprovoked attacks on faerie-kind by humans are to be paid only by a human life in exchange.”\n\nA life for a life! Oh, no! Is she going to die?! That's what a life for a life means, right? WRONG. Feyre is taken off to magical Fairyland to live in luxury for the rest of her life while her family is taken care of back in their little village.\n\n“Some would say it’s unwise to insult a Fae in his home,” Tamlin ground out. “Some would say you should be grateful for me finding you before another one of my kind came to claim the debt, for sparing your life and then offering you the chance to live in comfort.”\n\nSo what?! Why?! This makes no sense at all. Feyre kills one of their kind. A beloved brother. In exchange, there is absolutely no punishment whatsoever. She gets to live in a fantastically fabulous castle, waited on by servants. She gets beautiful clothes and delicious food.\n\nAnother useless answer. I dug into my breakfast, savoring each rich sip of tea, and she slipped into the bathing chamber. When I was done eating and bathing, I refused Alis’s offer and dressed myself in another exquisite tunic—this one of purple so deep it could have been black.\n\nClearly there is some kind of a setup involving The Treaty, since there seems to be a lot of secrecy between the Fae...but wait, whatever information she wants, the Fae reveals...they're revealing their own weakness to Feyre, who is constantly plotting her own escape. It doesn't make any sense!\n\n“There is … a sickness in these lands. Across Prythian. There has been for almost fifty years now. It is why this house and these lands are so empty: most have left. The blight spreads slowly, but it has made magic act … strangely. My own powers are diminished due to it. These masks”—he tapped on his—“are the result of a surge of it that occurred during a masquerade forty-nine years ago. Even now, we can’t remove them.”\n\nOver and over and over, the Fae reveal their secrets to her, including one that might help her escape.\n\n“So there are faeries who will actually answer any question if you trap them?” Maybe they’d know how to free me from the Treaty’s terms.\n\n“Yes,” he said tightly. “The Suriel. But they’re old and wicked, and not worth the danger of going out to find them.\n\nAnd then pretty much the next chapter, she goes out AND IMMEDIATELY FINDS THESE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES. WHAT THE FUCK.\n\nI do not like it when things come so easily to a main character, and everything comes easily to Feyre. There is no consequence whatsoever to her actions. There is no punishment to her deed of killing. The Fae are supposed to hate her...it doesn't feel like it, because she is \"inconsequential.\" In fact, they're more of her playmates than her wardens. The Fae seem to have no other things to do besides play with her and hunt with her.\n\n“My morning work was postponed,” he said. Indeed, his usual tunic was off, the baldric gone, and the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to the elbows to reveal tanned forearms corded with muscle. “If you want a ride across the grounds—if you’re interested in your new … residence, I can take you.”\n\nAnd teach her how to read and write...because Feyre cannot read or write, an ironic twist to the Disney Belle's love for reading.\n\n“I could help you write to them, if that’s why you’re in here.”\n\nFeyre is irreverent, ungrateful and insulting to her wardens...in a way that gets her no punishment whatsoever.\n\n“Do you ever stop being such a prick?” I snapped back.\n\nDead—really, truly, I should have been dead for that.\n\nBut Lucien grinned at me. “Much better.”\n\nAs I said, I'm sure this book improves in the end, but from what I've read, this book makes no sense, the writing is emotionless, the characters are flat, the main character unrealistic, and I do not care to continue.\n\nSeptember 19, 2015\n\nINITIAL REACTION: WILL UPDATE WITH REVIEW LATER BUT KNOW I LOVED THIS. IT KILLED ME AND BROUGHT ME BACK TO LIFE Y'ALL.\n\nA REVIEW IN GIFs :\n\nMe when I received the book:\n\nWhen I started reading:\n\nWhen Feyre was introduced:\n\nWhen Tamlin as introduced:\n\nFEYLIN/TAMEY:\n\nLITERALLY ME WHENEVER THEY SPOKE TO/LOOKED AT EACH OTHER:\n\nTHE PLOT WAS BASICALLY EVERYTHING I WANTED IT WAS...\n\nTHEN THERE'S CHAPTER 27!!!

Maybe my rating comes as a surprise or even - if you care - a disappointment, but let me assure you: no one is more surprised or disappointed than I am.\n\nI've had this book on my TBR ever since it appeared on Goodreads without a title, cover or description. I started reading it as soon as it became available and the array of positive reviews from my friends and strangers alike made me feel sure I would love it. But I didn't. It is possible I expected all the wrong things from A Court of Thorns and Roses, and maybe my review can prevent others from doing the same.\n\nHere's what I expected: an intricate fantasy world, supernatural politics and alliances, fast-paced action, a sensual romance - perhaps similar to Cruel Beauty and other Beauty and the Beast retellings, and a flawed but likable heroine.\n\nBut this book is, if you ask me, nothing more or less than softcore erotica. Which is fine, if that's what you're looking for.\n\nI personally thought that the fantasy aspect felt like trimmings around a story that was all about a romance between Feyre (the narrator) and Tamlin (a High Lord of the Fae). There are some titillating scenes where Tamlin bites Feyre's neck and they have sex - undoubtedly the best bits of the book and I won't pretend I didn't feel a little hot under the collar myself. But the \"ancient wicked shadow\" promised in the blurb is only really a source of more romantic angst for Feyre and Tamlin.\n\nHowever, I *do* like a good romance as much as anyone, so there are other reasons this book didn't quite work for me. In order to express what I mean, I'm going to compare A Court of Thorns and Roses to Cruel Beauty, which is, in my opinion, a better book.\n\nIn CB, I felt the chemistry between Nyx and Ignifex as soon as their loaded banter started to fill the pages. They were sexy together, Ignifex was an evil ruler (which was a real problem for their relationship) with blood-red eyes, and the supernatural part of the book was creepy, weird and completely unique. Despite enjoying the actual non-PG scenes in A Court of Thorns and Roses, I never felt any real chemistry between Feyre and Tamlin or any realistic challenge to their relationship.\n\nWhat makes Beauty and the Beast such a compelling romance? One that demands to be told over and over again in so many different ways? I'll tell you what it is: it's the obstacles, the challenges, the improbability... how can a young woman come to love an ugly beast? We ask. I'll prove it's possible! The author replies. That's why readers fall in love with the beast again and again, even when he is furry and has horns like the Disney version. I loved the Disney beast. And that badass fox in Robin Hood so it's possible I have issues.\n\nTamlin is not a beast.\n\n“Even as he bit out the words, I couldn’t ignore the sheer male beauty of that strong jaw, the richness of his golden-tan skin.”\n\nOh my, how could a poor young woman ever love a pretty-faced, golden-haired, completely not evil Fae prince? How weird.\n\nMaas is a good writer and the beginning - before Feyre is taken to the Fae world - made me believe a great book was on the way. When Maas writes action, she writes action really well. But there was far too little of it in this book. It came in behind the descriptions of beautiful Fae men and the Fae palace.\n\nIn short: It just wasn't nasty enough. In truth, this felt more like an extended Cinderella retelling than what it was supposed to be. A girl lives in poverty and looks after her rather annoying sisters until one day she is swept up by a prince who takes her to his beautiful palace (after about three chapters). I just find it hard to recommend this when I think Cruel Beauty is similar and yet so much better.\n\nBlog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr\n\nNovember 24, 2023\n\n4.45/5 ⭐\n\nFull review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf 🐺\n\nThis book’s mood song match – Fix You by Coldplay\n\nmum: *enters kitchen at 3 am* What the hell are you doing?\n\nme: *with a bowl of ice cream in one hand and ACOTAR in the other* I'm starting another SJM series\n\nmum: Hang on, I have a bottle of vodka here somewhere\n\n*\n\nAnd if this is not some relatable shit when facing Sarah J. Maas’s books then I don’t know what to tell you anymore. You puzzle me.\n\nSo, there you go – another great universe erected by SJM just in front of our humble eyes. She is building her own fucking multiverse and we are here to witness the power of a goddess at work. I will make three sacrifices for that.\n\nThis is, so far, for me, the best Beauty and the Beast reimagination.\n\nHER EXECUTION STYLE IS THE AIR TO MY LUNGS.\n\nAnd this one is not even the best of her works.\n\n“Magic – everything was magic, and it broke my heart.”\n\nMainly, our action is happening at the Spring Court where our main character finds herself in front of a new intriguing life. Or at least as intriguing as a Court of flowery gardens can be.\n\nAs I always say about SJM’s books, the characters are the ones who make the action. It’s like they are the very engine of a plot.\n\nI kind of like Feyre. She definitely has her own personal issues, mainly because she is broken and lonely and desperate to beat her status. She is human and miserable, mainly because her family is horrible. Her whole family was created to look like the typical fairytale family – an absent coward of a father, an uninterested mother, a sister full of wicked hatred and another one caught up in her own world, sensitive and naïve. Until her sisters do something worthy of my affection, I ain’t changing my mind about them.\n\nLucien (the Emissary of the Spring Court), I must say, I liked from the very beginning, but he somehow managed to grow on me. There was something likeable about him at first and he only proved that to me more as the action went on.\n\nTamlin, the High Lord of the Spring Court, on the other hand, seemed a bit stiff the whole book, even though I sometimes appreciated the occasional softness of his heart.\n\nBut full-on honesty now – the best thing about this book, the one thing that made it 110% better was Rhysand. He won for this book a full star from me with all of his domineering prick moves. He played the bad boy role so good that my traitorous heart enjoyed him whole. I might have a problem but oh, what a perfect problem he is.\n\n“His voice was a lover’s purr that sent shivers through me, caressing every muscle and bone and nerve.”\n\nSexy.\n\nRhysand and Feyre certainly have a sort of total chemistry that it seems Feyre doesn’t have with Tamlin; not even after they supposedly fell in love with each other. I don’t buy that love for more than a second and by the end when everything seemed to try to make me believe their relationship I was still not convinced.\n\nI recognise fabulous chemistry when I see one and that ain’t it. Rhysand, you’d better act up, love, I have expectations. You’re more than just a cruel, beautiful ruffian, I know it.\n\nThere’s a certain cruelty in this book, so very Maas. I sometimes feel like I’m reading the words of a psychopath, but then I remind myself how much I enjoy this cruelty in these books and I temperate myself.\n\nThat crazy wretch Amarantha is definitely the embodiment of cold murder and torture in this book and this is visible when it comes to how much her actions affect the other characters’ moods and movements. It’s terribly interesting though to see how terrified all of them can become when facing her.\n\nBut by the end, there was this sliver of hope that lingered. And that broke the evil to pieces.\n\n“This wasn’t music to dance to – it was music to worship, music to feel in the gaps of my soul, to bring me to a place where there was no pain.”\n\nEven though I think this is not the best of SJM’s works, I still believe is so very good that just makes you want to know more. It leaves you craving. And in my humble opinion, that’s a bonus factor in books.\n\nAll and all, my first step into the ACOTAR universe has been a success. More steps to come. Until I fall in love. Wholly and irrevocably.\n\nJuly 18, 2015\n\nI cannot remember ever being this conflicted over a book. There are parts of A Court of Thorns and Roses I really loved, but a lot of parts I really hated.\n\nI went into this book fully expecting to love it. Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite fairy tales, and I was interested to see how SJM made the story her own.\n\nFirst off, my biggest problem with this story was Feyre as a character. I have never been so irritated. Her character development and personality, for the most part, didn't make sense to me. She was the caretaker of her entire family for years, supposedly a hunter with a strong survival instinct. And yet, she proceeded to make the stupidest decisions and put herself in danger time and time again. I didn't get the sense that she did this out of bravery, but more out of stupidity. It didn't mesh with what her character was supposed to be. Examples of these idiotic choices:\n\n1. Repeatedly plotting to escape into a faerie land that she knew to be deadly, when she was asleep on the way to the manor and obviously wouldn't know her way back to the mortal lands\n\n2. Running after the illusion of her CRIPPLED father at NIGHT, when she has been told and witnessed how deceptive fae can be\n\n3. Trapping a Suriel with little more than a snare, in the deadly part of the forest, after she has been told, and AGAIN, SEEN how dangerous these creatures are\n\n4. Going to Fire Night after being told how dangerous it is, not leaving after being almost raped by 3 faeries, and then proceeding to leave her room AGAIN afterwards\n\n5. Drinking the faerie wine at the Solstice, even after Lucien of all people warned her not to\n\n6. Leaving the manor when the Suriel flat out TOLD her not to and that she would be safe with Tamlin, and deciding to not mention that to ANYONE before he forced her to leave\n\nIn addition to all of these idiotic choices, she also is incredibly inconsistent. She'll go from hating Fae to sympathizing with them to loving them back to fearing them at the drop of a hat. These inconsistencies are probably the most irritating, as there are scenes that I absolutely adore with Feyre, but then she goes back to doing the next pain in the ass thing on the next page.\n\nI also found her relationship with Tamlin to be problematic. Yes, I do enjoy problematic things (especially ships from time to time) but there were a lot of things I couldn't excuse with them. Again, more inconsistencies in characters' behavior. Tamlin's hot and cold behavior was eventually explained, but not until 70% of the way through the book. It was too little too late. Also, I found the Fire Night scene to be a problem for me. I do enjoy volatile relationships and bad boy characters. But only when we are told from the beginning that one of the characters is \"bad\". Tamlin we are led to believe is a saint, then he bites her and gets possessive, but all is forgiven the next morning. Because he's a \"nice guy.\" No.\n\nThe world building I found to be lackluster in a lot of ways. While I really enjoyed the wide variety of Fae creatures we got to see, I thought that a lot of the back story was revealed in a lazy way. Instead of having Feyre figure anything out for herself, important things are told to her through long monologues from a number of characters throughout the book. This happens numerous times.\n\nAdditionally, few side characters have any development and most felt like blank slates. With that being said, the ones that were developed I adored. Lucien and Rhys saved the book for me in a lot of ways. I found them both to be complex and interesting characters.\n\nThe last 10-15% of the book saved it for me. I found the plot to finally be interesting, and I found Feyre's decisions in those chapters to actually make sense. A lot of things were set up for future books that have me very intrigued, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. Many things that I disliked in this book, may in fact be remedied due to some of the occurrences in this last small section of the book.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed by this first installment. While there were elements I really enjoyed, they didn't make up for the elements I didn't. I'm hoping future installments will prove to be better.\n\nI will also be doing a full video review and spoiler-filled discussion on my channel in the future if you want to know more of my thoughts.\n\nDecember 9, 2020\n\nIf you've ever wondered which literary world would be the best to live in, wonder no longer, cause there's a BookTube Video to answer that!\n\nThe Written Review :----------\n\nUpdate - 12/6/19\n\nShould I cross the insurmountable TBR? Or reread this series again?\n\nI think you know the answer\n\n----------\n\nHere's the original review: Feyre is hunting in the middle of the woods to keep her useless starving family alive (Hunger Games, anyone?).\n\nA chance encounter with a wolf - who wasn't entirely a wolf - leaves Feyre on the wrong end of an ancient treaty.\n\nShe is forced to go to the fairy realm to live out the remaining years of her human life - no friends, no family and no freedom.\n\n“Has anyone ever taken care of you?” he asked quietly.\n\n“No.” I’d long since stopped feeling sorry for myself about it.\n\nAt first, she cannot think of anything but escape. Slowly (but surely), she is swept into the fairy realm - in its magic & intrigue, in its danger & hopelessness, and in its wonder & glory.\n\n“Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Dawn, Day, and Night,” it mused, as if I hadn’t even answered. “The seven Courts of Prythian, each ruled by a High Lord, all of them deadly in their own way. They are not merely powerful—they are Power.”\n\nFeyre lands in the Spring court - which is under a masquerade curse for nearly fifty years.\n\nThe court is being attacked by all manner of terrible creatures and there is a blight upon the land .\n\nThis blight will soon cross to the human realm - threatening everyone Feyre holds dear.\n\nThe first half sucks but keep reading\n\nThere's no way around it. From page 1 to about 200, Feyre is annoying and obstinate.\n\nI nearly put this book down half a dozen times (it was like reading Red Queen).\n\nBUT, there was something about it that kept me interested.\n\nAND THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT.\n\nBecause wow. Seriously wow.\n\nMidway through the book, things turned around magnificently. It was like a whole new book.\n\nSarah J Maas is a devious little thing.\n\nSuddenly, all the plot holes, nonsensical actions of her fairy captors (Tamlin and Lucien) and Feyre's complete idiocy flipped on their heads.\n\nEverything makes sense now. I literally could not put this down.\n\nThough, and maybe it's just me, but the Tamlin-Feyre arc felt a bit rushed/forced. Her constant love declarations really had me questioning their relationship. But then again, I had a friend who accidentally spilled the beans on that one.\n\nWithout giving any spoilers, I sure hope book 2 does a complete character shift on you-know-who (NOT voldemort) because I am not pleased with the way the love interest was hinted at during the end of the book. (He's such a jerk!)\n\nOverall, I am amazed by how much effort Sarah J. Maas put into constructing this story. I'm this close || to rereading the book solely to better appreciate all those little clues that I must have passed over.\n\nSo, if you pick this up and just aren't feeling it - keep reading - trust me.\n\nThe Finer Books Club - 2018 Reading Challenge: A book recommended by a friend\n\nYouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads\n\nMarch 29, 2019\n\n4.8/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️\n\n“Don't feel bad for one moment about doing what brings you joy.”\n\nI'm speechless. What am I supposed to say after this? Am I supposed to write a coherent review with vital points as to why this book WAS FUCKING AMAZING??? I CAN'T EVEN TALK RIGHT NOW I'M SPEECHLESS. I WANT THE SECOND BOOK IN MY HANDS BUT MY ORDER STILL HASN'T COME. I'M READY TO GO TO FUCKING ENGLAND MYSELF AND PURCHASE IT. KIDS I'M LITERALLY DYING HERE.\n\nThe Beauty and the Beast-esque fantasy drama tells the story of Feyre, who finds herself entwined with faeries after unknowingly killing one. When the 19-year-old huntress kills a wolf in the woods, a beast-like creature arrives to demand retribution for it. Dragged to a treacherous magical land she only knows about from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not an animal, but Tamlin, one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled their world. Feyre must find a way to stop it or doom Tamlin and his world forever.\n\nI'm not a fantasy fan. I love fantasy in film and tv but not in books. I picked up this book cause I wanted to use it for my thesis for uni (don't even ask) and now after I graduated I decided to give it a go. My favorite genres to read are historical fiction and contemporary, and fantasy falls on a very different category. But the fantasy in this book man... it gripped me tight and didn't let me go.\n\nFirst I started off this book a bit confused. The language confused me a bit, the terms, all the information. I'm reading books in English while my native language is Greek so fantasy fell a bit harsh on me. As I said, I'm not a fantasy fan, and with fantasy comes many weird words and shit like that. But I kept going and after a while I got used to everything and started to enjoy the plot and the characters. I enjoyed very much the factor that there weren't many characters in this book. I don't like when a book is crowded with characters, it doesn't give me the space to love them all. This book succeeded in making all the characters lovable for me... even Rhysand. I fucking love Rhysand man. Unexpected feelings happening.\n\nThe world Sarah J. Maas created is so rich and dark and gloomy but also happy and hopeful and full of light, I truly enjoyed reading about it. I always get bored, to be honest, with descriptions and politics of different worlds but this one excited me. Even the fucking politics were exciting. I want to delve more into this world wHEN MY FUCKING BOOK ARRIVES.\n\nNow to the juicy shit... the romance. Holy fucking shit. I ship these two so hard I can't even breathe. When he sent her away I wanted to scream! He gave her a good fucking and left her hanging. Why am I laughing at this? But honestly, the romance was amazing. At first, I felt like the entire book was only gonna be about the romance and I didn't quite enjoy that but after all the revelations and the twists in the plot, the romance was used wisely. And I didn't expect that, because I have heard lots of things about this book. And now we have Rhysand... this dark, handsome motherfucker who has a gloomy past. This will become a triangle, I can feel it in my bones. But I'm here for it, for some reason. I love the heat Maas's romances convey in me.\n\nTo sum it all up, this book took me a while to get into but it was all worth it. Maybe after this book I will start reading more fantasy. Maybe. Maybe not. As I'm waiting for the sequel to arrive, I will drawn my sorrow into crying about how amazing this first book was. Or maybe reread some parts. Maybe. Anyway, till the next one K BYE!!!\n\nMay 18, 2018\n\n2.5 Stars\n\nOnce again, I find myself the odd man out when it comes to a massively popular book...\n\nI went into this really excited and and really wanting to love this thing.\n\nAfter seeing this book and its successors paint my feed with its courts and thorns and wings and ruin, I knew there was a lot of hype surrounding this series in general.\n\nAnd this first installment just didn't live up to it for me, sadly.\n\nThere, there, Court Thornians...\n\nQuite frankly, the first 60% of this book dragged like a U-Haul trailer with no wheels.\n\nNothing really happened and the things that did didn't even make sense until after the book was over.\n\nAnd I'm just not a fan of that. I like to enjoy books while I'm reading them, not only for the last 25-35% when everything that was murky throughout the whole book becomes clear.\n\nI also found myself WAY more interested in Rhysand than the actual love interest, Tamlin. Whoops!\n\nTHAT SAID.\n\nI did enjoy the writing and the ending.\n\nAnd while those things aren't enough to prompt me to rate this thing any higher, I AM going to read the second book.\n\nI trust my peeps and all of you are saying that, while the first book drags, the second book is \"OMG amazeballs.\" And I have faith in ya'll.\n\nPlus, I am getting it free from the library, so why not, no?\n\nMarch 12, 2019\n\nI approached this book with an open mind and wanted to enjoy it. Despite not being a fan of the superfluous writing style or the lackluster world-building, I was still willing to rate it 3 stars by viewing it as an easy guilty pleasure romance book. The relationship seems harmless and I still don't see how it's as problematic as people dramatize it to be. The first half of the book is a standard Beauty and the Beast retelling — not awful, but not special either — and then the second half really dips in quality, which lowered my rating to 2 stars.\n\nA couple glaring issues that stood out to me:\n\n1) The background story of the curse is literally told instead of shown via a side character's lengthy monologue. This was disappointing since I was intrigued to find this out by piecing clues together, not by being told it straightforwardly like a regurgitated wikipedia article.\n\n2) The main character seems relatively smart but consistently has leaps of logic that are clearly there for the sake of plot. 9 out of 10 times she won't follow the advice of another character.\n\n3) The antagonist is SO cartoonish — like mustache-twirling cartoonish. She gives a bunch of arbitrary challenges and rules for no reason other than for the sake of stringing along a story. It feels like she's hosting a game show or some overly complex scavenger hunt. There's no reason why she'd bother setting up any of these superfluous rules. I think this is the worst antagonist I've ever read.\n\nI'm willing to overlook the writing style and bland romance, but once I got to the part where Feyre answers the riddle, I had to drop it down to 2 stars because it was so ridiculous and lazy. I've heard that the sequel is much better though, so I am willing to give it another try, just not any time soon haha.\n\nSeptember 7, 2023\n\nFirst read: May 2015\n\nSecond read: May 2016\n\nThird read: April 2017\n\nFourth read: February 2018\n\nFifth read: June 2019 — I think this is my most read series alongside Harry Potter and Mistborn.\n\nSixth reread: Feb 2021\n\nSeventh reread: September 2023\n\nEvery reread of this book has somewhat differed but nothing too drastic. It’s still my least favourite in the series. There’s nostalgia involved since this was my first book by Sarah J Maas. I’ve become really familiar with these books now. Or maybe I should say attached.\n\nIt’s a great Beauty and the Beast retelling. It’s a great setup for the books to come, especially where Feyre is concerned and her character development, which is where Maas excels at.\n\nI quite frankly hated how loyal Feyre was to her family, though it’s understandable. But it’s this level of loyalty without any concern for her own well-being that leads to her downfall. Her loyalty to Tamlin when it came to the events that happen towards the end of the book destroy her. It was uncomfortable to read and see Feyre come to this realisation herself.\n\nThis seems to straddle the line of YA and NA fantasy, which is why I’m assuming the world-building feels so lacklustre, and at times, juvenile. Amarantha read like a spoiled child, though she’s the villain. I just didn’t care for the magic and world-building in this book because of how underdeveloped they felt.\n\nThank the stars this improves leaps and bounds in the sequels. Everything improves drastically in the sequels.\n\nJanuary 17, 2024\n\nAn illiterate 19 year old straight up kills a guy and is outraged when there are consequences. Her punishment is living in a mansion with a hot mayor and hanging out with his friend, the nicest guy in the world and the only character I care about in this series. This is a tragic turn of events for Feyre, as it separates her from her life as an indentured servant to her shitty family. Who’s going to take care of her deadbeat dad, her personality-proof younger sister, and Nesta, Satan’s apprentice? One day a generically handsome man appears and all of BookTok developed a bat fetish overnight. Some stuff happens as Feyre ends up in the Tri-Wizard Tournament from hell where she has to outsmart a worm. Feyre struggles but eventually triumphs due to severe interference from outside sources. This goes on for five books. The fanbase for this series is the size of a large-ish army and if you say something negative about Cassian, they will hunt you down and ruin your life. And honestly, good for them.\n\n1/17/24:\n\nI have just reread this book and stand by my 3 stars with the addition of how on earth did she figure out the Tamlin-heart thing and not the riddle, which could have appeared on a Bazooka Joe wrapper meant for children? And she fell in love with Fiddle Boy when Lucien is RIGHT THERE? HE’S RIGHT THERE. Whatever Feyre, learn to read.\n\nMarch 31, 2015\n\n4.5 stars Tamlin is going to set your loins aflame. Phew! My cheeks are still flushed.\n\nI'm also fairly confident this book is going to help change the face of new adult fiction. How awesome to see gifted writers shaping non-contemporary stories that have the coming of age/youthful perspective and vibe of YA books and combine that with the freedom that writing for an older target audience affords them. If you liked the mood and romance of (the excellent) CRUEL BEAUTY but perhaps mourned the missed opportunities of such a seductive premise, ACOTAR more than satisfies. BITE MY NECK SOME MORE, SIR.\n\nPlus stunning action and gorgeous imagery and interesting characters, including a fascinating anti-hero I'm looking forward to learning more about. Serious Darkling vibes, my friends.\n\nMaybe more of a review closer to release. If I can calm my racing pulse before then.\n\nDecember 8, 2022\n\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to the\n\nACOTAR Drinking Game\n\nWhat you need\n\n∙ a copy of ACOTAR\n\n∙ an alcoholic beverage of your choice\n\n∙ one or more friends to play with (seriously, don't do this alone)\n\nHow it works\n\nDrink every time you read the words:\n\n∙ a shiver went down my spine\n\n∙ my knees buckled\n\n∙ in a heartbeat/a heartbeat later\n\n∙ I would never be able to paint it\n\n∙ male/female\n\n∙ smirk/snarl/prowl/purr\n\nTake a shot every time:\n\n∙ Tamlin or Rhysand's overwhelming sexiness is mentioned\n\n∙ the word 'claim' is used in connection to sex\n\n∙ Feyre uses ableist slurs or blames her dad for being disabled\n\nBonus - finish your drink when:\n\n∙ Feyre is harassed by Tamlin or Rhysand (but in a sexy way, so it's okay)\n\n∙ Feyre complains about how difficult that ridiculous riddle is\n\nFeel free to add new rules as you go!

I'm really interested to see where things go. I did find a few things to be a bit questionable, but I can't say what they are because HELLO SPOILERS. I'll be doing a full review/discussion on this sooooooon!\n\nFebruary 6, 2024\n\nwow. Just wow. Sarah has done it again! This book was amazing! The romance was borderline new adult which I loved but it was also greatly paced. The plot was so well thought out and executed as well. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES!\n\nJune 11, 2022\n\nOh my God I want to cry this was so bad and that cringey Tamlin made me want to double cry.\n\n\"I was as unburdened as a piece of dandelion fluff, and he was the wind that stirred me about the world.”\n\nGet outta here, dumbass.\n\nMay 13, 2023\n\nAnother day, another SJM reread to escape reality.\n\nJanuary 26, 2020\n\ni'm just gonna stick with my 2017 rating. i am a girl of simple, slutty tastes.\n\nMarch 22, 2017\n\nThis is it. This is the stupidest book I've ever read.\n\nJune 1, 2020\n\nI take back every bad thing I've said about Rhys.\n\nOctober 27, 2021\n\nI’m a second away from dousing myself in gasoline and lighting myself on fire just so I never have to look at this book again.\n\nNovember 19, 2023\n\nrhys really just said: i could be a better boyfriend than him\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\nthis is howl’s moving castle fanfiction and no one can convince me otherwise\n\nFebruary 24, 2017\n\nAs others mentioned this feels like Bella Swan trying to act like Katniss Everdeen so basically, this was Twilight with fairies instead of vampires and some cringy love/sex scenes...\n\nIn the beginning, I was giving it a shot, trying to focus on the world that was intriguing but not even half way through the book I couldn't stop rolling my eyes. I literally said \"oh come on\" a couple times out loud...\n\nI have honestly no idea how to review this book.\n\n*Adding here that YES I will read the second book since everyone is saying it's much better but to be honest I don't have very high expectations.*"
