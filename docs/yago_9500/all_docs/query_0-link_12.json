        "text": "[E’Tzaintes] + A Wicked Tale1 min read\n\nReading Time: < 1 minute\n\nA Wicked Tale (NC16)\n\n2006 | English | 45 mins\n\nDirector: Tzang Merwyn Tong\n\nA Wicked Tale is a psycho-erotic re-imagination of the Little Red Riding Hood story. It relates a little girl’s fascination for the forbidden and deals with the theme of seduction and manipulation. This thriller made its World Premiere to a full house crowd at the 34th International Film Festival Rotterdam and was a surprise hit at the 2005 Montreal Fantasia Film Festival.\n\ne’Tzaintes (NC16)\n\nDirector: Tzang Merwyn Tong\n\n2005 | English | 50mins\n\ne’TZAINTES! – the made-in-Singapore underground film is dedicated to the misfits and dreamers of the world. The film was shot in three weeks with 18 hours of footage; 30 in the cast and only three in the crew. Using almost zero budget, and with an experimental attitude, Tzang creates a spirited underdog story like nothing you’ve ever seen before."
