        "text": "Review - Dissecting the Scares in 'Afterimages' by Tony Kern\n\n'Afterimages', a local horror film from the makers of 'Haunted Changi', has opened islandwide. It promises a kaleidoscope of scare with its 5 mini stories. SINdie writers Jeremy Sing and Joseline Yu dissect them and discuss the hits and misses of these scares in 'Afterimages'.\n\nJeremy Sing is the editor of SINdie and Joseline is a final year English Literature student at NTU.\n\nJeremy: Hey Joseline, sorry I almost left you sitting alone in the cinema, thinking you were not afraid of horror but to my surprise you are. So...... any 'afterimage' after watching 'Afterimages?’\n\nJoseline: Some of the gorier parts did made me resort to your suggested method of only peering at the screen. But to be honest, the more interesting bits are the ones free of blood and impending violence. Shall we dissect the scares we remember the most, both the gruesome and non-gruesome ones?\n\nJeremy: Oh! Did the peering at the screen work? Would love to know! Lol. It always works for me because you fear it yet you want to watch a bit of it.\n\nJoseline: It made the viewing more bearable, and afterwards I didn't really feel like I missed much since I know that basically bloods will spurt, mutilation will happen etc. Even viewers who don't come for the visual violence can still be interested in watching horror films if only for the narrative. As long as the violence isn’t the plot point itself, not fully taking in it isn't that detrimental to the experience.\n\nStill, not to detract the enjoyment of those who watch horror for those kind of scenes and the people who make them...where else to enjoy gratuitous violence, if not in horror films?\n\nJeremy:Haha. Some logic there. And yes, I think as much as creating an arresting story, many horror filmmakers love to create scares, an exercise sometimes totally separate from the story. I have seen the director Tony's previous works. And yes, despite him being an American, he has a wide vocabulary of Singaporean tales from the dark. But of course, whether he knows to milk them to the best effect is another question. So yes let’s examine the scares.\n\nThe first scene that spooked me was actually not a scare. In story one, Ghost Pool Leg, the pervert has his telescopic view of this lady across the block who had just emerged from the shower. The blurriness of it and the unsuspecting nature of that moment actually made it a bit spooky. I felt like, perhaps the director has something up his sleeves in this scene.\n\nMaybe its because when I was younger, I also sometimes was curious at night and would use my binoculars. (by the way.... curious in a general sense haha!)\n\nJoseline: Aha! Most people nowadays would keep their curtains tightly drawn though, since estates nowadays are packed closer than ever. I didn't really think much about the expat being a pervert...but on second thought the shot did set up a sort of transition from the blurriness of the naked woman to the dripping lady swimmer, as if some erotic link is established. Feminine beauty or desirability is often presented as a precursor to violence in this film, but we can delve into that later on.\n\nSpeaking of the unexpected, I was pleasantly surprised that the security guard caricature turned out to be a ghost himself!\n\nJeremy: Actually that got me a little confused at first. Maybe it is because his emergence as a ghost was shadowed by the frenzy that was happening in the water. Your eyes are on the woman and what surprises she will unleash on the pervert. Otherwise, the passer-by ghost warner being also a ghost himself is quite common in the horror formula.\n\nJoseline: I think I saw the actor before playing the same kind of stock character, perhaps even in a TV drama. So do you think that the ghost of the woman and the security guard will move on in peace once they have sacrificed the pervert?\n\nJeremy: Actually this is where I would mention a fundamental flaw in the whole movie 'Afterimages' - the lack of a substantial back story. The movie concentrated too much on the scares and tactics, it tends to neglect the most important part of horror, the context and background. We know nothing about why the girl drowned in the swimming pool and we care even less about the security guard. So whether they move on after sacrificing the pervert or not, is inconsequential to me.\n\nJoseline: Yeah, and what's there to lose with the pervert drowning? Anyway, since there are 5 films, we can excuse this one as those of the quickly made B-genre. The film wants us to not take this one so seriously too as shown by the meta discussion of the students in the frame story regarding the ambiguous ending. The next film though, about the suicide, incorporates context and background. Do you think it makes the central character more sympathetic in any way?\n\nJeremy: Yes, I think so. And strangely, the scares and moments and details in this filmlet were more meticulously executed. And when I say details, one example I am referring to is the girl trying to delete the photos she had taken, which contain that of the girl who just jumped. I think if I were her and for no scientific reason, I get an error message about being unable to delete, I would leap off my chair!\n\nJoseline: Indeed. I nearly expected her to try to burn her phone and CPU, but that would be more painful than horrifying. Why the neat ending for this one, though? I'm guessing from the sepia tone that it might be meant to replicate a student film, and those tend to end with closure.\n\nJeremy: Hahaha you just insulted student films! But good point on the neat ending, which was different from all the other films.\n\nJoseline: Noo...I was not! Just said that it looked like one >__<\n\nIn contrast to the first film, this one has an underlying message to it, that the dead haunts the living for a specific reason and not just for spooks.\n\nJeremy: Personally, I quite like the subtle touch in this closure. It was literally touch and go. If you blinked an eye you would have missed that closure moment. So, yes I agree with you.\n\nJoseline: We can even read a bit of character development to the central character as she got over her own fear and find out more about her ghostly tormentor's previous life. As the film ends with it teaching us something, I guess this can be another way in which we can consider it as a student film in spirit.\n\nJeremy: Any other memorable moments or scares for you in this filmlet?\n\nJoseline: For a moment I was scared that something terrible will happen to the cats! Thankfully, they were left alone.\n\nJeremy: Are you a cat lover?\n\nJoseline: Yes! As of late I've even warmed up to black cats...it's not their fault that certain cultures perceive them as ominous symbols due to the coat colour they are born with.\n\nJeremy: I see. That reminds me of a recent news I saw in which a cat was thrown down the flat. The newspaper photo showed a pool of blood. Same predicament as the girl in the story, different body weight. Which also reminds me the split second moment when we saw some black and heavy thing just drop across the screen, partly shrouded by the curtains, a pretty scary moment.\n\nJoseline: Yeah, now I wish we hadn't seen the mutilated corpse so that will be the image of the dead woman that will stick with us.\n\nJeremy: Haha. Afterimage. That's what it is! Remember the opening scene?\n\nJoseline: Yeah, with the reference to Hamlet that went nowhere. That was effective because it relied on putting the audience in the students' place, in which they are required to use their imagination to see the invisible.\n\nJeremy: I loved that scene and the idea. I generally like simple ideas with huge extensions and I felt the simple close-up shot of the skull prolonged had a very unsettling effect on me. For one, of course, there was this nagging suspicion that there would be some scare in ambush waiting to emerge. But the idea also outlives the duration of the visual because it's like being transplanted into your brain and it germinates on its own.\n\nJoseline: Exactly...straightforwardly scaring the audience would make the viewing experience more passive. It's like the opening scene gets the audience to scare themselves.\n\nWithin the confined space of the 3rd film, the one in the elevator, do you think it's still possible to direct it in such a way that the audience still has room (pun unintended) to exercise their imagination?\n\nJeremy: Yes, but I think to achieve that, the effort is more in the scripting. So many ways you can make an elevator spooky. Actually, what's even better, is if the director can play up more the unknown and unseen. Make the characters in the lift panic about something that will not even rear its face in the film. But alas, the one and only scare in the film was very literal and flat. What do you think?\n\nJoseline: Indeed...I did not need to see a woman cut her face open nor did the film make me want to. The twist of her being a zombie all along took away most of the sympathy I had for her as well.\n\nJeremy: So was there anything in the 3rd film that spooked you at all?\n\nJoseline: At one point, one of the male characters started filming the conflict in the elevator with his phone and the events being filtered through the grainy screen made me feel like there's something else in there with them. However, he was so unessential to the story that I can't even be sure if this happened.\n\nJeremy: Hahaha. I dont even recall this portion. For me the only scary moment was this particular shot of the lift. It was an infinity reflection shot of the mirrored interiors of the lift and it seemed like there was a message in that shot or something I could spot.But..... not important it seems. Moving on, the fourth film should be quite interesting to discuss. What spooked you and what didn't?\n\nJoseline: Spooked me: Everything to do with the hawker's friend until the twist of the hawker's repressed memory. What didn't: Everything to do with lady's fingers... It's like...an increased preference for the food happened to coincide with the chopping of literal lady's fingers. It would be more relevant if the hawker is a seller of lady's fingers, or if the food is the thing to jog his memory instead of the ring.\n\nJeremy:I was like, trying to jog my memory if chicken rice hawkers sold ladies fungers alongside chicken rice........ and only Nasi Padang came to mind.\n\nWhat about the hawker friend spooked you?\n\nJoseline: As for the hawker friend, the script gives him more action than what is usually allocated to bit characters. For example, teasing the Caucasian lady and taking the extra step to paste directions to the lady finger's stall on the front of the hawker's stall. It seems then that he has a larger role in the murder, especially his insistence that the victim has fled for China.\n\nHis story about the ring that can't be knocked down made it seem like he's attempting to mislead the hawker as well.\n\nJeremy: Yeah, I agree mystery and horror go together and there was something mysterious about him.\n\nMy next scary moment is rather obvious one. It was when the hawker saw the ring come to live by itself, and something knocked on the door as if on cue. I think it's especially scary because we just saw a severed palm moving on its own in a previous scene!\n\nJoseline: It took me some time to make the connection though, that the hand wants the ring to return to it. But then again, the victim hated that ring in the first place...Were you confused in the last bit when the body parts were put back together again? Like who was in charge of the corpse?\n\nJeremy: I have to say the story rules were not set very clearly and much was lost in the scare frenzy. Somehow, at several points in the film, there were good build-ups, though they often ended in poorly-executed climaxes. This monster that appeared in this fourth story was a let-down for me. Feels like suddenly, we are all in a Universal Studio ride!\n\nJoseline:Speaking of monsters, it just occurred to me that 4 out of 5 monsters feature female monsters. And for the fifth, the ghost of the haunted house never takes a visible form. I shudder to think of the implications...*not monsters, films\n\nJeremy: Well, you know what they say about how hell hath no fury like a scorned women? Yup, women make scarier ghosts (challenge me on that!). haha,\n\nJoseline: Aha, but then again, quite a few horror icons are men! See, it's when we attempt to seek a thematic connection among the films that we notice this underlying gender bias. Another missed potential to provoke thoughts on top of inducing fears.\n\nJeremy: haha yes. Sadako, Carrie, Pontianak......\n\nJoseline: Overall, I'm still ambivalent on how to approach this film on its own terms.\n\nbe one thing if we're expected to be casual watchers, but then that contradicts it starting with the definition of 'afterimage' and expecting us to remember it without explicit call-backs.\n\nJeremy: My next talking point of horror is a different kind of horror. Its the horror of native Chinese-speaking characters speaking in English like a Channel 5 drama.\n\nJoseline: Aha! I took it as unintentional humor. It would make more sense if the kept woman is of any other non-Chinese race.\n\nJeremy: Case in point, it's strange enough that the hawkers are conversing in English. Name me one coffeeshop where this happens! The ultimate horror surfaced when his PRC wife tried to do a 'lulu' form Channel 5's The Noose - i.e. speak in English with a heavy accent. For whatever markets this film is aimed for, that really made me shudder.\n\nJoseline: We can always pretend this is a dubbed film and the English is conveyed through voiceover. Don't think it's relevant to the storytelling, anyhow.\n\nJeremy: Still! Alright, we have different thresholds.\n\nJoseline: An image that ought to be relevant to the storytelling is the short scene of the Asian female student in the white dress looking through the previous owners' things. The symbolism was so blatant! And yet it went nowhere.\n\nJeremy: Yeah, there was some expectation built in there but, like I mentioned, did not take off. In fact, a lot of things were happening in the final segment very rapidly, almost signalling the lack of time to finish telling the story. Again, there were some excellent build-ups to the screening of the final film.The idea of the film strips foretelling their fate is potentially a creepy one, though it was not milked for maximum effect.\n\nJoseline: I'm still confused on whether it is truly 'fated'. What does the ghost have to gain from burning all of them?\n\nJeremy: It would have nice to support that with a back story but alas, the film succumbed to a 'all-ghosts-are-blood-thirsty-don't-need-a-reason-to-kill' justification.\n\nJoseline: To wrap this conversation up, I would like to finish up with a question.\n\nJeremy: Sure, fire away.\n\nJoseline: Among the plagiarist students, who did you initially think would be the first to die?\n\nJeremy: Mmmmmm.....there are a few equally likely as prime targets, either due to their curiosity, their arrogance, their devil-teasing ways. Instead, perhaps I will tell you who I thought was least likely to die - the Chinese boy.\n\nJoseline: Shucks, I expected him to be the first to die, just because the film is so much like a typical Western horror film.\n\nJeremy: Hahaha. Where the Western guys survive and save the day?\n\nJoseline: Yes! But then again, the girl in white who I mistakenly thought would be the Final Girl is Asian and also died.\n\nJeremy:True. Like I said, this film likes to 'overkill'. So no one lives. (evil laugh!)\n\nWritten by Jeremy Sing and Joseline Yu\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n11th Singapore Short Cuts (1st Weekend Highlights): Ben, Orbits, The Sri Lanka Diaries, Corners\n\nBEN\n\nDirector/Writer: Paddy Jonathan Ong\n\n2014 / 18 min\n\nYou should watch this if: You'd enjoy a breezy feel-good effort by a self-assured debut filmmaker. \"Ben\" doesn't break new ground with its tale of a boy trying to impress a girl (complete with grand master plans, training montages, embarrassing failures, wise sidekicks and humble seconds), but the film is shot and edited with such pizzazz and energy that it doesn't need to strive for more. Added plus, too, that the film's main characters are themselves refreshingly plus-sized, rather than boilerplate magazine-cover types.\n\nAvoid this if: You might be let down by the Short Cuts programme's Wes Anderson comparisons. \"Ben\" doesn't quite offer the visual idiosyncrasies and exacting production design linked to the director of The Grand Budapest Hotel, but it remains impressively polished for a first-time effort.\n\nORBITS\n\nDirector: Martin Hong\n\nCinematographer and Set Designer: Shane Lim\n\nCostumes: Ian Kong\n\n2012 / 14 min\n\nYou should watch this if: You would like to see an early (still impressive) film made by a young local talented filmmaker. \"Orbits\" was written and directed by Martin Hong (he even did some of the Director of Photography work himself), before he entered film school in NTU. A wonderful exploration on young unrequited love, \"Orbits\" is a film that Martin said was borne out of his own personal experience, and was a story that he felt compelled to tell. With an unconventional set design (the inside of a spaceship being entirely made out of cardboard) and a pet dog “King William” playing the key supporting cast member, this short is capable of touching heartstrings and is a definite must-see for hopeless romantics who can possibly gain insight on closure where it comes to affairs of the heart. Creativity at its best, in the usage of the cosmos within the plot, one also has to give absolute credit to the costume designer for helping to create a convincing world of the galaxy out there.\n\nAvoid this if: You are sappy and dislike the risk of shedding a tear or two. \"Orbits\" stands out with its somewhat mawkish script, but that also means that the overly sentimental may require a tissue at the lines Martin’s character, Tom, utters as he comes to terms with his loss.\n\nTHE SRI LANKA DIARIES\n\nCinematographer/Editor: Tan Jingliang\n\n2013 / 22 min / view entire film\n\nYou should watch this if: You're a fan of authenticity in your travelogues. \"Sri Lanka Diaries\" was shot by Jingliang entirely on her iPhone, guerrilla-style, as she travelled with a friend through Sri Lanka. But she did not intend from the beginning to make a film for the public eye. The result is a personal gift to her travel companion, cobbled together from her footage and recorded conversations with native guides and fellow travellers. Experience, through this film, a sliver of contemporary Sri Lanka: ochre dirt paths, distant glimpses of Mt Everest, couples steadying each other on a crowded railroad train. Listen in, too, on an intimate voiceover conversation at the film's end, when Jingliang shares some of her difficulties working on an earlier thesis film and reflects on her ethic as a director.\n\nAvoid this if: You like your films briskly cut. \"Sri Lanka Diaries\" meanders as much as Jingliang & co. probably travelled, and a tighter edit might have yielded a more consistently engaging experience for the viewer. (View the entire film)\n\nCORNERS\n\nDirected by: Edward Khoo and Kwok Li Chen\n\n2014 / 4 min\n\n(Warning: spoilers for the film's ending.)\n\nA technique that has been recurring among many of the films screened at the 11th Singapore Short Cuts is the overlaying of a voice over long stretches of meditative visuals. Tan Jing Liang's \"The Sri Lanka Diaries\" was an entire exercise in this marriage of voice and visuals. This is sometimes an experimental hit and miss, where some directorial control would have been favoured. At other times, you get something like Edward Khoo and Kwok Li Chen's well-executed \"Corners\".\n\nThe film takes the audience on a visual excursion through a hotel’s interiors in the dark of the night when the crowds have left and the chairs have been stacked up. As the camera tracks through empty corridors and ballrooms, we are guided by a security guard’s narration of his dream, in which his friends, family and relatives have gathered to celebrate a happy occasion at the hotel. The juxtaposition of his sense of yearning as he recounts the occasion, with the cold, morgue-like reality the rooms present, accentuates the sense of loneliness the security guard feels. It also establishes an ironic relationship between him and the space he patrols. In fact, there is another layer to this – the accounts are that of one of two security guards who are playing chess to while away time while on duty. Between them, while one has been vocalizing his story, the other has been the silent listener. A twist at the end reveals that there has only been one security playing chess with himself. I would downplay any supernatural inkling in the mind of the director, but rather interpret this as saying we sometimes do not address our feelings directly but rather through the people around us who serve as mirrors to our own lives.\n\nReviews written by Gwen, Colin and Jeremy\n\n↧\n\nYOLO or 'You Only Live Once!' - Yahoo's latest 2min Video Contest\n\nTwo minutes to tell a story on film.

It will center around a group of transgender men in their various stages of transition, including one of the production team members, \"creative content guy\" Christopher Khor, as he prepares for surgery.\n\nSINdie spoke with Chris and producer Geraldine Lee about their team's motivations for making this film, audience engagement both online and offline, and the ups and downs of crowdfunding.\n\nWe understand that Some Reassembly Required will follow transgender men—who are in various stages of transition—in Singapore, and will be documenting Christopher's surgery. This is likely a very personal journey, yet one whose outcome may have a wider impact. Why did your team choose to make a documentary film? Did you have to take into consideration any matters such as privacy of the individuals featured? How did you build up trust and rapport with them?\n\nGeraldine: I think the idea of doing a documentary came very naturally to us. We had been interning together in San Francisco at Bay Area Video Coalition (BAVC) where we interviewed lots of documentary filmmakers and learnt a lot from them in the process as well, from crowdfunding, to organising events, to even ethical issues such as the right of an individual to choose to appear in a documentary, versus the potential repercussions of their appearance. Our interviewees’ privacy was definitely an issue we discussed a lot.\n\nChristopher: Privacy has always been a huge consideration for us, especially since some of the guys who are in the film aren’t out to their families yet. So we never want to put them so far out of their comfort zone (seeing as being in a film is already out of the comfort zone of many) that they are afraid to see themselves on the big screen. As for building up trust, I think it was much easier because I’m a transgender man, and some of these guys I’ve known for a long time. Others were willing to be in the film because 1) they trusted us with their stories, 2) I was visible, open with my transgender status, and they knew they would not be alone, and 3) honesty and transparency with what we intended to achieve was another thing that really helped, and they knew that their stories would (treated with care and consideration) be well-told.\n\nAnd our crowdfunding is up!! Find us at http://igg.me/at/srr\n\n#scaredproducer #srrdocu #TRANSpire #crowdfunding #documentary #film #filmfunding\n\nGeraldine, on your team's blog, you wrote that crowdfunding is the \"scariest thing I've ever done\". Was the team clear from the start that crowdfunding was the way to go? Did you consider other options such as applying for grants? Why or why not?\n\nGeraldine: When we first decided that we were going to do this documentary, the first thing we thought of was grants, haha. But we knew there was a possibility that we might not receive any local grants because this wouldn’t be considered “family-friendly”, so the idea of crowdfunding was a natural progression. We did apply for the MDA grant, but so far we haven’t gotten back a response to our application.\n\nGroup #selfie #wefie after #pinkdotsg 2014! #srrdocu #goteam\n\nYou have an active social media presence—website, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, blog—and have also held events such as a crowdfunding launch party. Have you found one avenue (online publicity vs. \"real life\" events) more effective than the other in raising funds and awareness? Or do you think both are necessary?\n\nGeraldine: Both are necessary for us to raise funds and awareness, and they function differently in terms of audience outreach and engagement. For example, events are better at putting a face to a name (i.e. Chris). We knew we could not do this without the support of the community, and y’know, we thought, what better way to engage them? Let’s have a launch party where people can meet us one-to-one and chill out to a night of great music.\n\nBut...not everyone is able to be there in person, and that’s where social media can come in. You can talk to someone who’s 10,000 miles away; or they can follow your Facebook page for interesting and relevant news they want to hear about. So there’s two very different ways of promoting and marketing, and they’re both good to do, but it’s not a must-do because your mileage may vary.\n\nDo you feel Singapore is ready for such a story to be told? Do you feel now is the right time? Why?\n\nGeraldine: Definitely. Since last year, there has been increasing awareness about LGBT issues in general, from the Wear White campaign to the recent book-banning controversy. Things are not always painted positively, but the upside is the dialogues that people are finally having. Be it for or against, we are moving away from sweeping things under the rug. If you really think about it, Singapore’s kind of going through her teenager phase now, haha. It’s a good thing. We’re no longer content to just take in information we’re fed, because we want to make our minds up for ourselves.\n\nChristopher: What’s great is that we intend to show that we are much more than just the fact that we’re transgender. We are sons and brothers, lovers and friends. We travel to work on the same public transportation networks, struggle with the same working hours, have the same hopes and dreams for the future. It’s just a different sort of journey to get there, you know?\n\nThe very wonderful people at the #barclayspectrum #lgbt networking event!\n\nMet and talked to a lot of people, thank you for having us -- really appreciate your support 3>\n\nIf you feel comfortable sharing, has there been any backlash? What has been the most upsetting response?\n\nChristopher: We’ve actually had minimal backlash, and I’m almost a little bit disappointed about that, haha! So with that in mind, I think the most upsetting thing for me was a fellow transman who said that he didn’t want “a transgender 101”, so that “anybody can tell who a transman is with one glance”. I understand where he’s coming from—many transgender men have gone \"stealth\", which is, in essence, having the privilege of not telling anyone who did not know them before their physical transition, know that they have undergone said transition.\n\nThat sentence is a little bit convoluted, but it’s the best way to put it, I think. And I get that—it’s one of the reasons we had to sit on this documentary idea before I agreed to do it. It is easier to never have to explain yourself to anyone (besides your future partner). But I decided to be open about this because I realised I never had any openly-transgender male role models when I was figuring myself out, and that feeling of being alone is awful. Hopefully we can bring hope to those who are struggling, like I was, with this documentary.\n\nWhat has been the most encouraging response to your efforts to date? Have your crowdfunding campaign backers been mostly family and friends so far, or people you don't know personally? Have you had backers from outside of Singapore?\n\nGeraldine: While we definitely have friends and family who are supporting us, a large number of our backers are fans and supporters who learnt about us organically. We have backers from the United States, Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Ireland, and even as far as Spain! It’s been very encouraging to receive their support, and knowing all that, it pushes us on to make sure that we do our supporters right by producing this well.\n\nShoot shoot shoot! #shoot #video #crew #srr_docu #documentary #intro\n\nWhat is your hope for the documentary? What message would you like to convey to the community at large? (Anything else you would like to add as well?)\n\nChristopher: Wow. I really hope this documentary will be successful, not only here in Singapore, but across the globe. By that, I mean that (making money and winning awards aside, hur) we give hope to transgender people, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, because there are many more documentaries made in America and Europe about transgender people. I also hope that we can educate families, move parents who may be struggling with accepting their transgender children, and even win the hearts of those who have never even thought about transgender people before. We may be transgender, but we are also wholly human. And I hope people learn to see past the labels, because really, we are just like you.\n\nGeraldine: Adding on to what Chris said, as filmmakers, we would love for our films to really reach out to people internationally. Getting into film festivals would be the first step—I want to be part of a generation that can say, y’know, we helped make our industry into what it is today. I’m quite an idealist, if you couldn't tell, heh, but really, if this film could help someone out there who’s struggling to find him or herself, or a partner or family member who is trying to understand but doesn’t know how, then all the hard work we’ve been putting into this film would have been worth it.\n\nSome Reassembly Required's five-week crowdfunding campaign ended on 24 August and raised about US$9,300—about 60% of their goal.

A look at the website www.bothsidesnow.sg gives an immediate idea of what the initiative is about – tombstone, coffin and wreath ‘stick figures’, drawn to ‘humanising’ effect. In a similar fashion, ‘Departing’ by twin brother Henry Zhuang and Harry Zhuang, and ‘Swing: An interview with Sally’ by Tan Wei Keong (picture on left), blunts the gravity of the issue of death and offers us a dreamy glance through the use of 2-D drawing-animation.\n\nDEPARTING\n\nDirector: Henry Zhuang, Harry Zhuang\n\nProducer: Jasmine Ng\n\n2013 / 4 min\n\nI guess there is a purpose 2-D drawing serves. It sets a distance and dilutes the emotional rawness of the issue. Both shorts, in fact, are built on heavy-going accounts of encounters with death. In ‘Departing’, Dr Wong Sweet Fun, lets us in on her personal reflections on her father’s last hours and the conflicts in her dual role as daughter and doctor. The poignant account is tinged with regret and dilemma, yet when juxtaposed with the dreamy stylistics of a children’s book (think pencil sketchings), the campaign has achieved its aim of lending death a less frightening face. In fact, the rather pared down approach to the sketching seems to serve the narrative well, with the empty white spaces mirroring the unanswered in the film and the simple pencil strokes serving to help the story manifest itself but for us to complete the details in our mind.\n\nSWING: AN INTERVIEW WITH SALLY (picture above)\n\nDirector: Tan Wei Keong\n\n2013 / 3 min\n\nSimilarly for ‘Swing’, drawings that remind you of a Roald Dahl novel are used to subvert your typical notions of hospital drama. A nurse, Sally Pang Ai Cheen, gives an account of her difficult experience in the emergency room in which a life was on the edge and how she later had to break the news of the man’s death to his wife who was pregnant. The short opens with the face of the nurse in textured colouring. It is a little unsettling at first putting a voice with a strong everyday Singaporean accent to a ‘Roald Dahl-esque’ drawing. But the genius in this combination was of course, how this made us view death through a different microscope and left spaces for us to imagine it in flesh and blood through only showing us lines and shadings.\n\nTHE BOY IN THE WHALE SUIT\n\nDirector: Marie Toh\n\nTexture Painter, Dress Simulation, Composition and Lighting: Teo Kiki\n\nAnimator: Michelle Wong\n\n2014 / 9 min\n\nRustic colours with gradient shading on objects of distorted proportions, that’s the cabbage-patch-kids world filmmakers Marie Toh, Teo Kiki and Michelle Wong want to transport you to. In this 9 minute animation, two characters exist in what seems like a world when the sun is up at 3am and no one is out. Of course I gave the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt that some suspension of disbelief is needed in animation viewing. Some.\n\nThe story is about a little girl who is intrigued by a boy who keeps making his rounds near her alley in whale suit. When her curiosity is fanned to the breaking point, she decides to get down from her balcony and follow him. It then becomes a stalking game around town. What really matters in this simple tale is really the aesthetic details. As one of the filmmakers Teo Kiki shares – she now works as a texture painter at Lucas Films, you get the point of the piece – a real visual achievement with unflinching attention to details. The two characters are so richly imagined and finely airbrushed that you feel like plucking them out of the scene and taking them to bed.\n\nThe piece is symptomatic of many graduation show pieces, which display good structure, concerted execution, pleasing aesthetics and most important of all, closure. This makes them sometimes inherently boring. But of course, formula, when applied with precision, can produce vivid results and the spectacle in this short film is clear for all to see.\n\nCURRY FISH HEAD\n\nDirector, Writer & Animator: Srinivas Bhakta\n\nMusic and Sound: Teo Wei Yong\n\n2014 / 8 min\n\nLink to film here\n\nThe traditional style of the pencil sketching frames in ‘Curry Fish Head’ belie the progressive territory the animation film covers. The first few minutes of the film will make you feel like you are reading a social studies textbook. You see a mother instructing her daughter on the wet market shopping items she needs to get for her to cook curry fish head. But the real fun begins when the central character of the while playing hopscotch, falls into a time-warp that puts her on a life-cycle kind of a journey.\n\nWhat follows are a touch and go drive through a woman’s lifetime from dating a man to marrying to having kids to, having your man stray when your kids are in their teens (gasp!), to having your kids or rather daughters grow up and marry. What is delightful is veteran animator Srinivas Bhakta’s acute jabs at the myths of progress through stylistic representation of life’s episodes which bear the speed of television commercials yet also the acerbic wit of opinion section cartoons in newspapers. There is also an unmistakable demonizing of icons associated with Singapore.Inc. like MBS and other skyscrapers through linking them to the de-nucleation of the protagonist’s family. While the film jogs our visual memory of these ubiquitous symbols of Singapore-on-modernisation-steroids, it takes the opportunity to subvert our connection with these familiar icons, making it a strong anti-eulogy on time and progress.\n\nReviews by Jeremy Sing\n\n↧\n\nShoutOUT! : Watch 5 local feature films including this year's Singapore Oscar Entry\n\nHere is your chance to catch Singapore's entry to the 2015 Oscars in the Foreign Language Category 'Sayang Disayang'.\n\nFor the 3rd year running, Objectifs will host free rooftop screenings as part of the Singapore Film Commission’s WATCH LOCAL campaign.

His films have travelled and won several awards. 'A Wicked Tale' premiered to a sold-out crowd at the 2005 Rotterdam International Film Festival. 'V1K1', a Sci Fi short film won the Gold Remi Award at the Houston WorldFest 2011.\n\nHe is back with another 'faery-tale' called 'Faeryville'. To be more accurate, it is Dystopian Teen movie.\n\n'Faeryville' is a film 8-years-in-the-making, made on an Indie Budget. It is a coming of age film, set in a fictitious college, about a group of teenage misfits who were often bullied, and how they struggle to find themselves in an increasingly surreal world. A movie dedicated to the misfits and the dreamers, the rebels, the thinkers, and most importantly, the believers.\n\nCheck out this teaser of Faeryville.\n\nWe caught up with Tzang to find out more about the making of 'Faeryville'.\n\nTell us something about Faeryville (2015) we don’t already know. What is its true impetus? Or rather what is the ambition of the film?\n\nI wrote Faeryville to address my own fears and concerns about what’s happening in the world today, with the youth of this generation, dealing with issues kids of the 60s-90s, never had to deal with. What’s it like growing up in the Post 9-11 world where nothing is right or wrong anymore? Has idealism become a dangerous thing?\n\nNow that Faeryville (2015) is awaiting its big reveal; tell us about the rollercoaster of a ride in script changes. How many drafts did you rummage through before nailing down the perfect screenplay prior to shoot?\n\nApproximately 14 draft rewrites. I didn’t want to make an omnibus of short- stories-type feature film, or based it of a structure of another film, and spice it with local flavour. I have a story in my head. My own story that I want to tell. So it was harder, trying to put an original tale in writing, my first original feature length screenplay.\n\nFirst two drafts were like 200 pages and 160 pages, themes were heavy and difficult to process. It said what I wanted to say, but I hated it. Third draft came out well, and I sent my fourth draft to a Hollywood Script Consultant. His feedback was that Faeryville has the potential to really rock the boat, and I must be careful with how I handle the material.\n\nSo I spent about 2 more years, working and reworking the script. At the same time trying to keep a day job, so I can pay the bills. I got my later drafts reviewed again, and again, one in London and another one in New York by a veteran script consultant, and both feedbacks were spectacular, which made me want to make Faeryville on my own, so it doesn’t get watered down.\n\nThe protagonists of Faeryville (2015) seem to take on ‘anti-hero’ personas. Do you believe the world is full of misunderstood “villians”? Are you a misunderstood “villain”? Tell us about the portrayal of these characters.\n\nNot a villian, but a misfit. I’ve always found it difficult to fit in, and I consider myself an outcast, sometimes, a willing one. I’m comfortable that way.\n\nFaeryville takes you to this world too, but in our case, our heroes are losers, brave enough ‘not to try’, brave enough to be a Nobody. In a way, I hope to make a film that speaks to dreamers and misfits of the world, and tell them that it is alright to be different, to be awkward, to not fit in.\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong? I feel that Faeryville(2015) is representative of a fable. They are simple, enchanting stories however it has dramatic depth. Is Faevryville(2015) more of a fable applied to a dystopian context or does its essence originate from a perceived existing reality?\n\nIt’s a fable I hope people can relate to.\n\nIn the overlying arch; what does Faervyiile condemn and what does it render fashionable?\n\nThe tagline for the film says it all, be afraid of what you fight for.\n\nPersonally, I do not believe in the ‘Genre-disation’ (coined by myself) of films but for the benefits of our readers and audiences- what genre would Faeryville(2015) fall under and why?\n\nA dystopian teen movie. Dystopian, because it’s set in a fictious alternate establishment with issues not too different, yet not quite like ours, with its own rules and oppressive elements, that makes it fun for teenagers to rebel to.\n\nTeen movie, because that’s what it is. Teenage-hood is one of the best moments of our life, because everything is unreal. Everything is amplified. We fall in love for the first time. We read books, we listen to music, and we believe we can change the world. It’s a wonderful feeling.\n\nI wish I’ve watched the film so that I could ask more compelling questions but it seems I would have to fly over to Los Angeles to catch the premiere. With that said; who is the intended audience for Faeryville(2015)? Is this a film relatable to local (Singaporean) audiences or is it geared for an international crowd?\n\nFaeryville is made for youth of the world. You don’t have to be a film lover to relate to Faeryville. You just need to know what it’s like to be oppressed, to be put down, yet defiant enough to say, you are still gonna dress up, mess up, have your fun and kick shit up, regardless. It doesn’t matter if you’re from Singapore or Los Angeles, South Africa or Mexico, Faeryville is a film to be enjoyed by people who want to live and believe.\n\nWith diverse distribution channels, why have you resorted to a box office premiere instead of something a little more progressive and accessible such as NetFlix, Sundance Channel or any other local Video on Demand (VOD) platforms? Do you feel a theatrical premiere would maintain that privilege and prestige? Or do you feel Video On Demand (VOD) model dilutes the spectacle of the premiere?\n\nThere’s a part of me that’s still old-school, especially when it comes to presentation. I love the experience of being in a cinema, to be in the dark, and to be overwhelmed by sound, light and moving images, and have the emotions come off people in a public space. I want my audience to experience Faeryville with other people. Doesn’t have to be people you know. Just people.\n\nAnd have a film that travels from city to city, discovering new audiences, till it reaches your city.\n\nLet’s talk about the main actor, Lyon Sim. I have heard a lot of things about him especially about his ability to neutralize the cynical of minds. Is he the future or rather the new breed of Singapore actors? What is this new breed?\n\nI can only speak about my own experience with Lyon. He plays POE, a tom-sawyer type sensitive new age punk. He really respects the material that’s given to him, and he doesn’t try to act. He performs by being there with you, and making you believe everything is real to him.\n\nHe helps me to believe the problems are real, that Poe is real, and Faeryville exist.\n\nLyon Sim is second from right\n\nI’ve saved the best for last; is Faeryville(2015) a philosophical warning, conundrum or a potential reality? From a purist perspective, independent films unravel and explore social and political issues, in and around a socio-geographical structure. Does Faeryville(2015) debate such issues, rights, freedom and hypocrisy?\n\nThat’s why society needs independent cinema. So alternative voices for alternative issues can be explored and heard, so we can be ‘there’ before the ‘industry’ is ready to go there; and yes, alternative cinema can explode to mainstream consciousness too.\n\nIt’s never about being ‘indie’ so that we can be ‘obscure’. That’s bullshit.\n\nI have one more question for you. Will there be pyrotechnics?\n\nYes. There will be bombs. We want the danger to be real. It’s not CGI. The bombs we deal with are homemade, not michael bay stuff, and they explode for real.\n\nOne more note, thank you for NOT asking me, how hard it is to make a film is Singapore.\n\nThe film has not been screened in Singapore but will make it to our screens very soon. Meanwhile, 9th Nov is the worldwide premiere of its official trailer. Watch out for it!\n\nAlso find out more about the film in these following pages:\n\ninristudio.com/writing\n\n↧\n\nProduction Talk with Raihan Halim on 'Banting'\n\nThink 'Bend it like Beckham', but Singapore-style. A girl in jihab wants to pursue her dream of becoming a professional wrestler. That's one notch up from kicking soccer balls! 'Banting' is a feature film by filmmaker Raihan Halim and is the first commercial Malay film to be made and released in Singapore for a very long time, since 1975 in fact. Raihan has made quite a leap in his filmmaking endeavour since his early short film 'Sunat' which means circumcision. Here is the story.\n\nRaised in a strict household, Yasmin finds the missing passion in her life when she begins to secretly take professional wrestling lessons. But when her secret is threatened to be revealed, Yasmin will have to clothesline, pile-drive and slam her way through to keep her dream going and realize what she’s really meant to do in life!\n\nSet in the exciting rough and tumble world of professional wrestling, Banting chronicles a young Malay woman’s struggle to live her dreams.\n\nWe catch up with Raihan himself to learn more about his first feature film journey.\n\nCould you explain the movie plot in 140 words or less?\n\nBanting is about a girl in hijab who wishes to pursue her lifelong dream of being a professional wrestler. In the course of her adventures (and misadventures), she'll have to contend with her strict mother who wishes her to forget her ridiculous dream.\n\nWhere do you draw your inspirations from? Any particular catalyst that fuelled this film idea?\n\nI draw my inspirations from many, many sources — real life or otherwise. I am mostly inspired by the hijab girls in my life, friends who pray five times a day, living life as a good Muslim but are still being \"normal\" by listening to punk music and watching Michael Bay movies. One of my influences was a book called \"Does My Head Look Big In This?\" It's a YA fiction but features a lead character who wears the hijab. I loved it so much that I wanted to make something like that. Add my lifelong passion for professional wrestling in and voila: Banting was born!\n\nAny secret (or not so secret) unconventional passions of your own?\n\nI love watching food shows! Love it! Love it! Love it! Food shows like Chopped, Diners, Drives In and Dives, Iron Chef -- man! I love them all! I scour the internet for any chance to see some sort of food shows. And I enjoy having a meal watching a food show before me. It's weird but man… that's one unconventional passion of mine. Yep, you read it right. It's a passion!\n\nCould you share some interesting anecdotes of the production process?\n\nProduction was tough. Some interesting anecdotes including Izyan Mellyna's (Banting lead actress) audition process. As my audition room was booked for another meeting, Izyan was forced to audition in the middle of a working office. There she was, acting her whole heart out and there are phones ringing, fax machines whirring and people talking. But somehow, she held our attention. She was that awesome. She's probably one of the best decisions we've ever made for the film. We grew really close since I first casted her. Today, Izyan is no longer my star. She's my sistah!\n\nBanting went through over 8 months of editing. And the people who were there with me every step of the way include my Producer, Asra Aman, Associate Producer Sulaiman Salamon and the awesomus maximus editor Huda Azzis. They helped me crafted the story and whittling the running time down from 2.30hrs down to the film's current running time. In every single edit for any of my TV shows, we'll have what we call: Newton Night. On Newton Nights, I'll go down to Newton Circus to get epic BBQ seafood and we'll feast. This is a mini celebration of sorts for either a long night ahead or something awesome had happened. We have about 4 Newton Nights with Banting. It's really epic!\n\nAre there stereotypes — about one’s country, culture, religion, gender, or even about niche sports — that you hope to question or dispel?\n\nMy greatest wish is to dispel stereotypes about Muslim women in the world. I am pissed that every time I catch a \"Muslim\" film, they always revolve around terrorists, wife-beating, rape and such. Blech! I wanted to show a different side of Muslim women. One who is fun loving, funny and has a lot of positive attributes. I saw an episode of No Reservations where Anthony Bourdain went to Iran and he met this awesome lady who wears the hijab. She brought Bourdain home to meet her family and she introduced him to her flatscreen TV, collection of Grey's Anatomy and other modern fixtures. She basically dispelled Bourdain's preconceived notion that Iranian women are docile and are backward thinking in their ways.\n\nFor me, Banting is more than just a Malay film. It's a Singaporean film. Anyone who watched Banting would clearly see that the cast is extremely diverse. We have Chinese, Indian and even a Japanese! This is extremely important to me. I always get upset when I watch some of the Singapore films and I keep on seeing Chinese in every single scene. Come on, man! This is Singapore! There are so many opportunities to cast non-Chinese actors for roles but somehow, the minorities are relegated to ether 1) Comic relief or 2) Quota for the filmmakers to say: \"See! I have a non-Chinese there, leh!\" I am extremely upset when I watched some local movies where the filmmakers clearly have the chance to cast non-Chinese for the roles but decide not to. Singapore is a melting pot of races, culture and language. I want to embrace this.\n\nHow do you feel this film will be something the community at large will be able to connect to?\n\nI do believe that audiences — Malay or otherwise — can connect with the film. I mean, I didn't grow up in a middle-class Chinese family and I didn't have a maid. But holy crap did I connect with Ilo, Ilo. That film is just so epic! For Banting, the film is about chasing your dreams. It's not a groundbreaking story. In fact, the oft-treaded story lines can be traced to films like Bend it Like Beckham, Billy Elliot and even Cool Runnings. Dreams are worth pursuing and you should not let anything stop you from achieving them. My wish is for audience to look beyond the language of the film and see the film as what it is: A movie about reaching for your dreams.\n\nHow did you stay true to capturing the spirit of pro-wrestling? Was it ever a consideration to cast a pro-wrestler?\n\nNope. I never once wanted to cast a pro-wrestler. For me, it's all about casting the best damn actors and then send them for professional wrestling training to make them \"look\" like wrestlers on screen! We stayed true to the sport by hiring the awesome people of Singapore Professional Wrestling who helped trained all the girls to be ready for their big fight scenes. It's so painful to see the girls get battered day in and out but I'm telling you: these girls are just so damn power, man! They just look so pro at it. I tried to perform a wrestling move. And I had a headache for a week. So for them to actually do it time and again, without complaining. It's so awesome!\n\nAny underlying message you want to convey to audiences?\n\nI made Banting not because I want to inspire people. But if the course of the film, someone — just one person — decides, \"Hey! I have a dream! I want to pursue it!\" Then I'm a very happy man. For me, the film started out as a story about dreams but ended as a story about mothers and daughters. The final scene of the movie never fails to make me feel emotional. And I hope that the audience sees the power of that scene, all thanks to Izyan and Mastura Ahmad's acting. For the young ones, I hope that the film inspires them to pursue their dreams. And for the parents, I hope the film give them a sense to allow their children to make their own mistakes and give them the leeway to pursue what they want in life.\n\nWhat are your hopes for this film?\n\nI had always hoped that with Banting, I get the chance — as small as it is — to show that we have different kinds of stories to tell here in Singapore. If I could — and I did — make a different kind of Singapore film, I'm sure that there are hundreds of others who are looking to make different kinds of stories too. So come on. Only Jack Neo can make a Jack Neo movie. Only Anthony Chen could make an Ilo, Ilo. And only Raihan could make Banting. So I hope that new filmmakers would stop emulating other filmmakers and just come out with their own original material and kick as while they're doing it.\n\nWhat has been different about this experience, as opposed to that of your previous works? What can we expect next?\n\nBanting just takes a damn long time to complete! We took a year to write it and go through pre-pro. We shot for 23 days. And we edited for 8 months! That's a marathon. And this is coming from a guy who makes a drama series, man! It's tough and it took a lot of stamina. Most of all, it took a lot of discipline to not second guess myself. Watching the film close to a thousand times now, I got very sick of my own work. But it's just a testament of the people that I get to work with: Asra, Sulaiman, Huda and especially my wife who was there cheering me on. I love my collaborators and I can't wait to start on a new adventure with them again.\n\nNext? I'd be lying if I told you that I have nothing in mind for my next film. I have a rough plan of what's coming up for myself and Papahan Films. But we are trying to push ourselves to do something different. There's no point in repeating your success (or failure for that matter), right? I've said this in an interview before. Though I've yet to confirm it, there is a chance that my next film would be another \"Ban\". \"Ban\" something else.\n\nFind out more about 'Banting on its\n\nFacebook page www.facebook.com/bantingfilm\n\nOfficial website www.bantingfilm.com\n\nCompany website www.papahanfilms.com\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nReview - 'Wayang Boy' and his silat brothers\n\n‘Wayang Boy’ began as this.\n\nA rudimentary tale about taking the plunge into something new, in this case, an Indian boy learning Chinese opera. It was born in the short film format, also almost the length of an Okto channel kid’s show episode and bore a good old-fashioned formula with morsels of life lessons.\n\n‘Wayang Boy’, the feature film, is ‘Wa is for Wayang’ on steroids. Chua Enlai, a comedic heavyweight, is the school principal, Channel 8 veterans like Kym Ng and Chen Tianwen are anchors to the show that up the entertainment quotient. Hong Kong veteran actors like Law Kay Ying and Michelle Yim take the film to a new level, and pulls ‘Xi Wang Primary School’ out of its heartland status. To top it all, the ‘FT’ (foreign talent) issue takes centrestage, stealing the thunder from the simple laughs and bite-sized takeaways of the film’s former short-form incarnation.\n\nA bit of a long shot? But it passes the entertainment test. ‘Wayang Boy’, by first time director Raymond Tan, who also directed ‘Wa is For Wayang’, appears to be a formulaic comedy that is hard to distinguish from some of Jack Neo’s works but delivers some laughs. Raja is a foreign student from India (who hardly sounds like one, because of his Singaporean accent) who is trying hard to fit into the school’s community and culture. Even, worse, he has to deal with an obnoxious Chinese stepmother who is trying to force-assimilate him into Singapore by speaking to him only in Mandarin and keeping the phone away from him so that he cannot contact his father. Not sure if it is allergorical in any sense but the sino-cisation of Raja comes across rather unsettling and yet familiar.\n\nRaja is only allowed access to his father once he obeys his stepmother and makes 3 new friends in school (again, sounding like an allegory to a foreign worker employment contract). Expectedly, it leads to Raja joining the school’s Chinese Opera Club and almost too conveniently, fulfilling those conditions set by his stepmother. Through these conspicuous plot devices, the film begins to feel like a children’s programme where the plot points are laid out all too clearly and the movie becomes more like a collection of personality-driven skits – Chua Enlai doing the Chua Enlai, Kym Ng doing the Kym Ng and Michelle Yim desperately doing a ‘younger’ version of herself.\n\nThe story moves on in the Chinese Opera Club and the principal opportunistically wants Raja to be cast in the lead role of a school performance to be staged for the Queen of England who will be visiting the humble ‘Xi Wang’ Primary School, for sensational reasons. So the kids, under the strict tutelage of one of the school’s senior teachers (Chinese language HOD? Disciplinarian?), played by Law Kar Ying (below), get into the hang, strokes and kicks of Chinese Opera.\n\nMeanwhile, another story moves in parallel, and in a big way, to the children’s journey. While, awkwardly transplanted into the film, its segments turn out to be the most enjoyable. This is the locals versus FT struggle. Chen Tianwen, one of the kid’s parents, sprouts xenophobic sentiments at every opportunity and loves using the word ‘aliens’. Kym Ng, the mother of another student in the school, bears feelings of rivalry against the native Chinese and Indian colleagues, whose superior performance is showing her incompetencies up. Completing the xenophobic loop is of course Raja’s own culturally-imperialistic stepmother.\n\nThe situations are exaggerated but they function to deliver some laughs. Bobby Tonelli, a new ‘Ang Moh’ boss comes in to replace an outgoing ‘Ang Moh’ boss, much to Chen Tianwen’s dismay and it does not take long before some open animosity is being displayed. What’s funnier is that Bobby Tonelli surprises with his use of Mandarin (plus some highly colloquial Hokkien) and up the ante on the game between him and Chen Tianwen.\n\nMeanwhile, Kym Ng plays the ‘Ugly Singaporean’ and personifies much of the ugliness your see on social media – aunties terrorizing commuters into giving up their seats and being sore losers in all senses of the word. Speaking of losing, all that xenophobia culminates in an all-too-familiar ‘car-touch-challenge’ in which one’s palm must remain in touch with the prize car in order to win it. A heavy dose of slapstick and toilet humour with an unabashed play on stereotypes makes this challenge segment quite a hearty laugh.\n\nThe scriptwriters of the film, by now, have demonstrated quite a masterful grasp of local current affairs, through its satirical depiction of the employment struggles, overcrowding and the titular concept of ‘Wayang’ (putting up a show) own by executives at the top, in this case the school principal. Some of its jabs at familiar viral incidents are priceless, like when the principal explained how the student Qigong players enjoy practicing in the hot sun regularly, parodying the miraculous burst of sports activities created for the real visit by Queen Elizabeth two years ago.\n\nAfter a journey of physical and emotional struggles, the kids took to the stage for the queen in the ‘payoff’ Chinese Opera performance everyone was waiting for. In a predictable end to a conventional feel-good film about identity and fitting-in, everyone’s learnt something about living with people who are different from you. The film at first glance is undoubtedly flawed, rigid in its storytelling and skittish all over. But what saves it is really its ‘street creds’, an intelligent look at the cliché of ‘racial harmony’, that makes this film not feel like an MOE or MYCS ad. And whoever conjured this line in the film is quite a genius – when asked by the school principal to stage a silat performance, Malay teacher, played by Suhaimi, quips, ’Just because I am Malay does not mean I can teach Silat.’\n\nReview by Jeremy Sing\n\n↧\n\nReview - 'Banting' by M Raihan Halim\n\nBanting tells the story of a teenage girl who desires to break conservative barriers in pursuit of her unconventional passion in wrestling.\n\nYasmin, played by Izyan Mellyna Ishak, knows that there are two choices she has to make: fight or flight. Indeed, she chooses to fight through the battles – keeping this conquest a secret at home and at work – and comes out as a winner proving the old time saying 'when there's a will, there's a way'.\n\nEven though her “way” can be dare-devilish, Yasmin later became instantly famous when her power move was leaked on social media. This further propelled her will of becoming a professional wrestler in spite of her 'headscarf and modesty' issues.\n\nHer night-time wrestling journey uncovers her inner perseverance, tenacity and determination to be included in an all-female troupe under the guidance of a tough has-been coach, Harry (Jimmy Taenaka).\n\nHer efforts as “Zarith Blade” pays off when she was offered a professional wrestling gig overseas. Her disapproving mother supports her towards the end and even begin to take lessons from her. This mother-daughter acceptance is definitely one of the beautiful and tender parts of the film.\n\nThere was this epiphanic moment when a wrestler accidentally removed Yasmin's head gear and revealed her long dark hair in slow motion which seems contradicting. It is a shock factor but does little to swing the motion in Yasmin's favor.\n\nThe plot does seem plain but manages to counter with larger-than-life characters like Queen Kong, The Sisters, Pretty Baby and Killer Bride that add much needed laughable moments to Yasmin's state of tension with her family and best friend.\n\nOverall, this debut film is a comedy treat that is enough to entertain, invoke and make audience leave with a feel-good sensation.\n\nReview by Haswani\n\n↧\n\nProduction Talk with Lei Yuan Bin for '03-FLATS'\n\nAmy Tashiana in 03-FLATS\n\nIn October 2014, 03-FLATS had its world premiere at the Busan International Film Festival, where it was also selected for competitive standing in the documentary category. Early excerpts of 03-FLATS have been shown in London (Singapore Season, September 2012) and Singapore (Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, January 2013; ETH Future Cities Lab, March 2013; NUS Museum March 2014). In these screenings, it has generated intellectual debate, provoked contrasting views, and received invitations for return screenings. An exhibition curated around external responses to the film is planned for Fall 2015 at the NUS Museum.\n\nSINdie had the pleasure to have a quick chat with film director Lei Yuan Bin about his latest feature, 03-FLATS.\n\nQ: How did the film project and the collaboration with NUS and Dr Lillian Chee come about?\n\nDr Lilian Chee approached me to collaborate on the project. I have always been interested in architecture and thus the combination of film and architecture was very intriguing for me.\n\nQ: This film seems to be negotiating the tensions and stuggles of individual identities within the very landscape that epitomizes the nation's \"politicized\", and seemingly opposing, ambitions. Why were you attracted to this issue and what were your own sentiments leading up to this project?\n\nOur approach to the themes of the film is from the interior to the exterior, quite literally starting from home making in the interiors of the flats. From the observation of the small details in everyday living, we can learn much about our society and nation. I thought this is a very refreshing point of view to start with.\n\nTang Ling Nah in 03-FLATS\n\nQ: It was mentioned that the film was shot over 9 months and edited from 200 hours of original footage. Out of this large archive of data, what informs your decisions over your editing in the end and was there anything you were consciously trying to present in this documentary?\n\nThe editing of the film was to give the materials a structure that conveyed the patterns and rhythms of everyday life inside the flats. With the use of repetition and motifs of home making by the three women, the editing structure reveal similarities, as well as differences that reveal their unique personalities. The editing conveys a sense of time experienced by the three women inside the flats as well, which can carry different emotional nuances.\n\nQ: How did you come across your subjects and keeping in mind the common thread of them being all \"single\" and \"female\", why and were there any other reasons for choosing these particular three to be in your documentary?\n\nThe three women could have been three single men. It was difficult to approach participants because of issues of privacy and we are very grateful that these three women agreed to participate in the film project. The three women span across different age groups and one of them, of a different ethnicity, so it was interesting to compare and contrast their experience of home making. Their different life stories highlight different aspects of living alone in HDB flats.\n\nSim Boon Ngoh in 03-FLATS\n\nQ: 03-FLATS is your 2nd feature after WHITE DAYS. Just like your debut, you took on multiple roles like directing, cinematography and editing for example.\n\nCan you tell me more about your approach and your preference for keeping things more \"in-house and intimate\"? And is your working style and methodology synonymous to the kind of films you like to make so far?\n\nI value simplicity in my approach to filmmaking. The filming process I designed was very minimal and 'small', which would probably be the opposite of most filming process with big film crews and complex camera equipment. With the advancement of digital video technologies, I can now use the video camera like a writer with a pen, exploring what cinema can do with portability, lightness and an intimate creative process. The results can be seen in the film, where the camera achieves a certain invisibility, there and not there. This kind of 'small' working method is a different way to use the camera in film, which perhaps enables us to see different things.\n\nTang Ling Nah in 03-FLATS\n\nQ: Lastly, how can we get to watch this film?\n\nThe film will be having its Singapore Premiere at the 25th SGIFF on 8 Dec 2014, 715pm, National Museum, Gallery Theatre.

Add a wish list of acclaimed talented actors. Set against a comedic storyline with a soul, and the result is a truly memorable film that instantly grabs your attention from the first frame.\n\nWhile 'A Fantastic Ghost Wedding' marks the first collaboration between Sandra Ng and Mark Lee, there is already a sizeable buzz of anticipation. With great honour we managed to grab some time with director Meng Ong for his thoughts,\n\nFirstly, huge congratulations for having been nominated for the New Talent Award at the Hong Kong Asian Film Festival – did you feel any pressure to get a good reception for the movie especially after your previous success with Miss Wonton and the increased interest in Singapore made film with Anthony Chen’s Ilo Ilo last year?\n\nYes at first there was pressure to make a picture that will garner awards and there is also pressure to make the money back for our investors. But as I went into production and post production, the only instinct was to make the best film that I could. It has been a challenge juggling all the elements together. I'm glad that I finally achieved my dream of making a local movie.\n\nWith increased interest in Singapore film, do you feel there is a unique angle to Singapore’s film industry?\n\nI think our film industry is still evolving. I feel that there are two groups of filmmakers here: those who made short films and progressed to make feature films, and those who crossed over from Mediacorp to movies. But their common link is stories taking place within the HDB landscape.\n\nYou have been quoted in the papers as saying that ‘The plot is more realistic and dramatic, in addition to having more human, funny moments’ – having finished the movie do you feel this has been achieved?\n\nYes, the plot is still definitely grounded dramatically. The comedy is just the colours of the story. When it was at the Sundance labs, it was actually even more dramatic. But over many drafts of writing, it became more comedic. Ultimately, I wanted the movie to start off light - to make people laugh and connect with the characters. But when the drama takes over, the film becomes moving. I'm sure there will be tears flowing, as in the case with our test screenings. I'm pleased with these aspects.\n\nWhat would you like audience to take away as they finish watching the movie?\n\nThere is a strong message of love in the movie. Love between father and son, love between mother and son, love between two people (does not matter if it is between a man and a woman or a man and a man). Love transcends the boundaries of life and death. I hope the message of acceptance comes through in the movie. Sandra's character's denial of her son's sexual identity only brought about pain and guilt, and disability to reconcile with it especially aggravated her grieving process. She had to overcome the boundary of death in order to connect with her son so that she could come to terms with who he really is. And her tool to do that is her undying love as a mother.\n\nThe film is also about dealing with death, and how different people deal with it differently. It reminds one of treasuring your loved ones when they are alive, and not to end up with regrets. It is an entertaining movie but one that has meaningful messages.\n\nI have watched the trailer and the signature comedy moments are there with dramatic elements that I love – but additionally, I noticed that there seems to be a mix of Hong Kong Cantonese comedy, Mandarin dramatic dialogue mixed with Singapore local language and humour (especially from Mark Lee’s character) – was this intentional? Would this be a reflection of the mixed cast?\n\nI think the mixed languages reflect the reality of how we live here in Singapore: switching from dialect to Mandarin and then to English, and the back and forth. My mother used to speak to us in Hainanese and then spoke to my Dad in Cantonese. When she got mad with the children, sometimes she would jump back to Cantonese to scold us. Also nowadays you get to hear less and less dialects. There is certain nostalgic feel to it. Even our set design seems to suggest an unspecific time period, mixing the old with the new. It is my approach to filmmaking. I did that also with \"Miss Wonton\", the film I shot in New York.\n\nFrom news articles, I have read of the great professional working relationship between yourself, Sandra Ng and Mark Lee – did you feel any pressure having to juggle such established colleagues? Are there any anecdotes that you can share about working together?\n\nI've known Mark Lee for a long time - about ten years - we worked on Police and Thief together - I was the executive producer and a director of the series. I'm quite familiar with Mark's way of working, and knew his strength and the other things we needed to work on. I have to admit I was worried about handling Sandra. I wasn't familiar with how Hong Kong actors work. I've heard that they are used to a very quick way of shooting, and that she had a reputation for walking off sets. Thank God that didn't happen! She was very professional throughout and I really appreciate her contributions, and her audacity to work in an unfamiliar environment. Must have been daunting for her. The other thing I was very concerned for her was shooting in our hot and humid climate, and it turned out to be really tough for her.\n\nI knew both actors would be good at the comedic parts of the movie, but I wasn't sure with the dramatic parts. I must say I'm impressed with both of them. My jaw dropped during one of the scenes which Sandra and Jim Chim (who played her husband) acted - a dinner scene where husband and wife are shooting blame at each other for their son's death - it was really powerful. I'm also very proud of Mark in his dramatic scenes - he had come a long way - I think this a new high for him.\n\nWhat are your favourite moments in the movie or the filming experience? What was the most difficult part about making this film?\n\nI must admit executing the overall look for the film is the most enjoyable part for me: the set design and props. The most challenging part was finding locations for the shoot. Nobody would loan us places to shoot as it is a ghost themed movie. In general, I thought shooting in New York locations were easier. Sometimes you would get free locations to shoot, and there is support from the Mayor's office.\n\n10 years from today, what do you feel would remain in your mind about this film and this experience?\n\n10 years from now, I would probably say to myself that when you shoot a ghost movie, there are 'laws\" which you have to abide with! Cannot anyhow ignore those \"laws\" (Smiles)\n\nHaving been in the Singapore industry for a number of years, how would you like to see the local community develop?\n\nI wish Singapore is able to do more artistically adventurous films. Most of all, I hope our censorship will ease. It is tough to be a filmmaker and to have your voice constantly monitored and censored - how to make a product when you can't talk about anything or re-examine yourself ? - we are just going to have bland products that won't be able to compete in the international marketplace.\n\nWhat is the next project for Meng Ong?\n\nMy latest project is \"White Snake\". A sequel and reinvention of the folklore. This time I'll be working with a New York producer.\n\nWhat advise would you give to our readers made up of young film-makers in Singapore?\n\nMy advise is study as much as possible the works of master directors like Akira Kurosawa, Ingmar Bergman or Fellini. Also do short films - they are the best way to learn the craft and pave the way into features. And have faith.\n\n***\n\nWith this movie, the Singapore film industry may have just found another milestone and feather to add to its cap.

The feature had its world premiere in the Asian Future Competition at the Tokyo International Film Festival 2014. Here’s what the director had to say about his inspirations on the film, and some reflections on what a filmmaker reflects about in relation to the landscapes and narratives in Singapore.\n\n'As You Were' Film still\n\n1. You mentioned in your interview with the National Arts Council that\n\nyou draw your inspiration from everyday life. What was the starting\n\npoint for the story of the couple in 'As You Were' and how did the\n\ncharacters come to be what they are in the film?\n\n'As You Were' Film still\n\n\"As You Were\" begin as a short film that I shot in 2012 titled \"Song of Tomorrow\". It was inspired by a poem of the same name I had to memorize for Chinese dictation in primary 5. The basic premise was about a boy Guohui who succumbed to peer pressure and bullied a girl Peiling in his class; they were childhood sweethearts who grew distant because of this one incident and they never saw each other again after graduation. The poem talks about how if we always only look ahead into the future, we will never truly live in the present, which for me epitomized Guohui's guilt towards Peiling and his lack of courage to apologize to her, thinking that there will always be another opportunity to do so. While doing pre-production for the short film, I realized that the story which was set in the 90s has the potential to develop into a longer film, and hence came \"As You Were\" - which basically explores Guohui and Peiling's relationship as grown-ups living in a post-millennia Singapore.\n\n2. How do environments play a role in the story of your film? How do\n\nchosen landscapes inform the narrative of your film?\n\nThe film used three distinctive landscapes as a means to describe the idea of 'change' - which is a key motif in the film. First, there is St. John's Island, an offshore island that remains largely unchanged for decades, with many infrastructures from its history of imprisoning people (quarantine center, penal colony, drug rehabilitation) still remaining on the island. Second, there is the typical Singapore heartlands where we see HDB flats, neighborhoods, schools, etc. Third, there is Singapore as a modern metropolitan city with its towering skyscrapers and futuristic skyline. To me, these three important landscapes represent the historical facade of Singapore, the Singapore I've known as a child and the present-day futuristic monster the city had evolved to become.\n\n'As You Were' Film still\n\n3. You mentioned that your artistic inspiration has been Krzysztof\n\nKieslowski, Andrei Tarkovsky, Hou Hsiao Hsien and Ozu Yasujiro. As your\n\nartistic practice matures, how has your key influences changed?\n\nWell to put it this way, there are many film directors I admire over the course of my artistic career, from my days as a student to the present. My inspirations also evolve as I develop my craft as a filmmaker. There are directors whom I admire in my early days which I don't appreciate that much any more. There are films which I found boring as a student, but slowly developed a taste to appreciate as a more mature movie watcher. Maybe I would just like to quote one film - Andrei Tarkovsky's \"The Mirror\", which I've seen so many times in the course of the past ten years, but never felt the same emotions, grasp the characters in the same way, or able to outline the story in all of my viewings. It is a film which I will spend time to appreciate and understand - that is the kind of movies I want to make.\n\n'As You Were' Film still\n\n4. You mentioned once that you prefer focusing on creating the work\n\nand letting the work find its audience, rather than the other way\n\nround. Has your philosophy remained the same or has this shifted since\n\n2 years ago?\n\nI still believe in making the films the way I intend it to be, and letting it find its own audience later. Someone once mentioned that film watching should be perceived as an act of labour, which I agree to a certain extent. Film watching should be tiring and exhausting! Audiences should ponder, contemplate, learn, discover and reflect upon the films they saw. Or perhaps if the film is so utterly boring and meaningless that this supposed two way communication should cease - the audience should probably leave the theater (I do that sometimes).\n\n'As You Were' Film still\n\n5. What are your ambitions for 'As You Were'? How far in the\n\ninternational circuit would you like to take it?\n\nWell I like to take it one step at a time. The film opened in Tokyo International Film Festival, and will travel to Italy (Torino Film Festival) and France (Nantes 3 Continents International Film Festival) before hitting the big screen at home in the Singapore Panorama section of the Singapore International Film Festival. I hope that we will find the opportunity to do a small release in Singapore theaters, so that more Singaporeans have the opportunity to see the film.\n\nBehind-the-Scenes: 'As You Were'\n\n6. A theme in the film is constancy amidst an environment of change,\n\nbrought about by the motif of the water and the pool. What would you\n\nsay is the constancy in real life singapore that singaporeans can draw\n\nstrength from?\n\nThis is a big question! I think that diversity is probably an important attribute in Singapore's culture and life. Which is why we have so many different kinds of literature and films, telling different stories of different communities, embracing and celebrating differences.\n\nBehind-the-Scenes: 'As You Were'\n\n7. Do you tend to cast performers who are not necessarily trained\n\nactors? What are some of the opportunities or challenges that arise\n\nfrom such a decision?\n\nI think that every actor (professional or amateur), is first and foremost an individual that comes with his/her own lived experiences. The difference in every actor's lived experiences as a person (whether it is as a father, a teacher, a lover, a daughter, or any other role he or her carries in life) is what interests me. I like to tap into it as a source of creativity for both performance and story. I think of the director-actor relationship as an intimate collaboration. Take for example Cheryl Tan, who acted as a singer in \"As You Were\". I asked her to perform a few songs in the film (and wrote these into the script after casting her) because I believe that as a performer, Cheryl communicates differently when using her singing voice. It is something that is beyond mere emotions, it cannot be written or simply visualized, it has to be experienced.\n\nBehind-the-Scenes: 'As You Were'\n\n8. If there were an opportunity to collaborate with another fellow\n\nartist (filmmaker or not), who would it be and why?\n\nA successful collaboration always require a lot of synergy (in taste, artistic sensibility, intention, etc). Rather than quoting people I am interested to collaborate with (there are plenty in my wish list but I rather not list them here), I will like to give credit to a few people I've worked with in the past few years - Bee Thiam my producer, Wan Ping my cinematographer, Gladys my co-writer, Ting Li my sound designer, and the list goes on... I think that my films are as much their labour of love and I truly appreciate their professional partnership and friendship.\n\nBehind-the-Scenes: 'As You Were'\n\n9. How was your experience shooting in St John's Island. Anything\n\ninteresting you discovered about it in the process of shooting your\n\nfilm?\n\nDuring the shoot on the island, we met many Indian migrant workers who lived in dormitories on the island; they are workers who serviced St. John's and many of the outlying islands like Kusu, Sisters, etc. For me, it was an interesting contrast to how the island was first used as a quarantine center for Chinese and Indian migrants - basically our forefathers - who have to spend a couple of days on the island undergoing vaccinations and medical checkups before heading to Singapore. The comparative images of early 20th century and 21st century migrants, both of whom came to Singapore for its economical prospects and spent time on the island, became part of the context of the place as depicted in \"As You Were\".\n\nBehind-the-Scenes: 'As You Were'\n\n10. Are there plans for a next upcoming feature? Could u divulge a\n\nlittle teaser for the readers at SINDIE?\n\nNo concrete plans yet for a next feature film, although there are many ideas swimming in my head. I prefer to share a current project that I recently completed in an artist residency in Aomori Contemporary Art Center, Japan. It is a 16mm film installation titled \"Something from the Ocean, something from the hills\", best viewed during sunset.

It is bigger, more varied, more concerted in its organization, it’s got stars, but most importantly, it is back with a very important mission, to help us relate films to our lives. If one would call 2013 a KPI-attaining year, with the success of ‘Ah Boys to Men’ and ‘Ilo Ilo’, then 2014 would be a year we remind ourselves ‘why watch films and make film?’\n\nThe #LifeReframed campaign, launched in conjunction with SGIFF, is a series of initiatives aimed at inspiring both film-going and film-making. This year's festival is about celebrating people, and honouring the spirit of empathy, inclusion and the importance of individual points-of-view. As Karen Wai, Marketing Manager of SGIFF puts it: “Films, like literature, are important works of art that address moral dilemmas, social atrocities, utopic/dystopic alternatives to the lives we inhabit….it is an art form that can speak directly to our individual lives.”\n\nThe highlight of this campaign is the featuring of 12 inspiring personalities who reflect empathy, humility, and wisdom through the course of their lives and career, and how film has reframed their perspectives on life. Here they reveal a page in their book of life and how films have affected them.\n\nDaniel Ee, Board Member of Companies\n\nPhilip Jeyaretnam, Senior Counsel & Managing Partner of Rodyk & Davidson LLP\n\nShiao-Yin Kuik, Co-founder & Director of The Thought Collective and Nominated Member of Parliment\n\nPann Lim, Creative Director of Kinetic Singapore\n\nLeslie Low, Musician at The Observatory\n\nEunice Olsen, Producer & Actress and Founder of WomenTalkTV.Asia\n\nBenny Se Teo, Founder of Eighteen Chefs\n\nJosephus Tan, Criminal Lawyer and Pro Bono Ambassador\n\nRoyston Tan, Filmmaker at Chuan Pictures\n\nDr. William Tan, Neuroscientist, Medical Doctor and Paralympian\n\nDr. William Wan, General Secretary of the Singapore Kindness Movement and\n\nChairman of Prison Fellowship Singapore\n\nXiang Yun, Veteran Actress at Mediacorp\n\nA street campaign will run from November 17 to end of December, where audiences are invited to share insightful lessons they learnt from film through the hashtags#LifeReframed and #sgiff2014. Selected stories and photos from the Singapore community will be collected and posted on the festival’s social media platforms.\n\nAbout the Singapore International Film Festival (4 to 14 December 2014)\n\nThe Singapore International Film Festival (SGIFF) is the largest and longest-running film event in Singapore.
