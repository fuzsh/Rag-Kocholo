        "text": "One of the oldest moral stories, The Lion and The Mouse, is everyone’s favourite. The story teaches the importance of friendships and that regardless of how big and powerful you are, you can always end up in trouble. Moral education is best taught in the form of these stories that children can empathise with. Little details in the story are important to teach kids big lessons. Here, we present the lion and mouse story with a moral for children of all ages.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS\n\nOrigin & History Of The Tale Of The Lion And The Mouse\n\n‘The Lion and The Mouse’ story originated from Aesop’s Fables. Also called Aesopica, this is a collection of short moral stories told by a storyteller named Aesop. These fables belonged to oral traditions- which means they were told orally from one generation to another. Aesop’s fables have slightly different versions in every culture but still retain their originality in modern times.\n\nThe Lion And The Mouse – Short Story In 10 Lines For Children\n\nHere is ‘The Lion And The Mouse’ story for nursery students in short form:\n\nADVERTISEMENTS\n\nOnce upon a time, a lion was sleeping in a forest.\n\nA playful mouse saw the sleeping lion and jumped on him to play with his mane.\n\nThe lion woke up from the disturbance and caught the mouse. He was about to crush the mouse to death.\n\nThe mouse apologised for disturbing him and promised he would help the lion in the future if he spared his life.\n\nThe lion accepted the deal and did not kill the mouse.\n\nOne day the lion got caught in a hunter’s net.\n\nHe couldn’t free himself and pleaded for help from anyone who could hear him.\n\nThe mouse heard the lion’s cries and came for his help.\n\nThe mouse chewed through the net’s wires with his sharp teeth to free the lion.\n\nThe lion thanked the mouse, and they became best friends.\n\nThe Tale Of The Lion And The Mouse\n\nHere is the full story of ‘The Lion and The Mouse’:\n\nOnce upon a time, a ferocious lion lived in a dense African jungle. The lion always took his afternoon nap under the shade of a big tree in the bushes. One day, a small playful mouse saw the lion and decided to investigate closer. The mouse found the lion’s mane enticing and jumped on his head to play in the lion’s dense mane. This annoyed the lion as he woke up from his slumber. He caught the mouse and roared at him for being a pest. The lion was about to crush the little mouse to death when the mouse began squeaking, pleading with the lion to spare his life. He told the lion that if he spares his life, the mouse will help him in return someday. The lion was amused at the mouse’s words and decided to spare his life.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS\n\nOne day when the lion was strolling through the jungle, he got caught in a hunter’s net. The lion frantically tried to tear the net apart or bite through it. But, he was unsuccessful as his claws and teeth were not sharp enough to cut through the net. The lion begins to roar, pleading for help from anybody who might be passing by. The mouse who lived nearby heard the lion and rushed to help him.\n\nWith his sharp teeth, the mouse nibbled through the net. He freed the lion, and both of them fled the place. After a while, they reached the spot where they first met, and the lion thanked the mouse immensely for his help. He confessed that he underestimated the mouse’s offer before but now understood that everybody needs support at some point. Since then, both the lion and the mouse became best friends.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS\n\nMoral Of The Story\n\n“A good deed never goes to waste. The kindness you show has a way of coming back to you in unexpected ways”.\n\nThe lion shows kindness to the playful mouse by not killing him for disturbing his sleep. His act of kindness comes back to him in the form of the mouse’s help. It is also essential to understand that regardless of how big and powerful you are, you can also get into trouble and sometimes help can come from the most unexpected places.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS\n\n‘The Lion and The Mouse’ fable has been a moral story for hundreds of years. Also, this popular story is meant to teach children that help can come from even the smallest places.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nADVERTISEMENTS"
