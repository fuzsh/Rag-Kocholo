        "text": "Production company Circle of Confusion (“The Walking Dead”) has picked up a horror script written by Dan Kay titled A Wicked Tale, Deadline reports tonight, described as a contemporary horror take on the classic Brothers Grimm tale, Hansel & Gretel. And they’re thinking big here, planning on using the film to kickoff a shared universe of horror fairytales!\n\nIn Deadline’s words, “Producers are aiming to build a shared universe franchise of horror films based on reimagined versions of classic fairytales and public domain characters.”\n\n“A Wicked Tale follows two college students who stumble upon something sinister in the local woods after an altercation with a fellow student leads to deadly consequences.”\n\nZack Andrews and Bobby Roe (The Houses October Built) will be rewriting the Wicked Tale script, with Roe on board to direct the film.\n\nAndrews will produce with Circle of Confusion’s Matt Smith and Lawrence Mattis, alongside Seasmoke Entertainment’s Josh Weinstock."
