        "text": "Faeryville is a film 8-years-in-the-making, made on an Indie Budget. It is a coming of age film, set in a fictitious college, about a group of teenage misfits who were often bullied, and how they struggle to find themselves in an increasingly surreal world. A movie dedicated to the misfits and the dreamers, the rebels, the thinkers, and most importantly, the believers of the new world.\n\nThe director, Tzang Merwyn Tong, approached me to design their official movie website that will consist of their synopsis, information on the movie, the cast and even videos of their sneak peeks and trailers. This website was designed on Adobe Muse, with no codings involved, and exported after through an external hosting site.\n\nWritten and Directed by Tzang Merwyn Tong. With Lyon Sim, Aaron Samuel Yong, Tanya Graham, Farid Assalam, Jae Leung, Kris Moller & Jade Griffin. Director of Photography, David Foo. Produced by Tzang Merwyn Tong and David Foo. Faeryville is a dystopian teen movie, due to make its World Premiere in Los Angeles on 14 January 2015.\n\nYou can check out the actual website at: www.faeryville.com"
