        "text": "I self-financed my first film, \"The Very Last Day,\" in 2018 for $250K, and the film has since made only 1% (let me repeat that for effect: 1%) of its budget back. If there ever was a book about indie film failures, I should be on the cover! BUT, it was also selected in 30+ festivals, including the A-list Shanghai IFF, and it won a dozen awards including best film, best director, best of fest, etc. PLUS I've learned more doing it than in 3 or 4 years of film school. I personally consider the film an economic disaster and an artistic success and, to be honest, as long as it's not the other way around, I'm okay with it. One of the reasons, I think, the film didn't do better business is that we lacked marketing appeal. For instance, my actors were all wonderful, and I'd work with them again in the blink of an eye, but they were complete unknowns, and combined with the difficult subject of the film itself, that certainly didn't help. Anyway, fast forward to now, and you can see me putting together a cast for my second feature ahead of finding a distributor, and then we'll look for the budget. Basically, everything is in reverse compared to the first one because I figure it's okay to make mistakes, as long as you don't make the same one twice. Like many filmmakers my age, I admire the likes of Coppola, Lucas, De Palma, etc., but I'm also well aware of the rocky paths they went through to get to where they are. And because of this, whenever I hit a bump in the road, I just dust myself off and keep going. Filmmaking isn't a speed race; it's a marathon. Oh, and \"The Very Last Day\" is available on Tubi, iNDIEFLIX Group Inc, Plex, Inc., and many more streamers worldwide: https://lnkd.in/geaDrzp #filmmaking #inspiration #myjourney\n\nWhile distracted by the release of iPhone 15 and a potential BLM sequel (Seattle #police officer recorded joking about woman killed by police car), there is something happening in the background: The question concerning #Haiti paralyzes the #UN Security Council. The #US puts forward a U.N. resolution to authorize a Kenyan-led police mission to fight street #gangs in Haiti, but #China and #Russia block the resolution because Dr. Ariel Henri, a neurosurgeon presiding over Haiti, did not clearly request for an #intervention. Was it an honest mistake or an intentional catch-22? Regardless, the confusing proposal from Dr. Henri gives China and Russia room to bargain with US and #EU, in order to drop some #sanctions and resolve the territory dispute in #Ukraine. There are also other issues. President #JoeBiden is dealing with a lot of re-election headaches on top of #Trump's viral mugshot. Additionally, evidence suggests #Biden is, in fact, secretly suffering from dementia. Now Biden can no longer hide the signs of his mental decline. It is obvious that Biden's mental health is getting worse. #KamalaHarris is unpopular. The #DemocraticParty sucks. So does the #RepublicanParty. The government within the U.S. government is a crime family. Right now, there is no credible strongman in the race, other than the populist Trump, that can dismantle and reform the federal government of the United States of America. US as a country does not want to directly lead another military intervention in Haiti. Other countries step back because they don't believe the gangs are going to fear their soldiers. Haiti's gangs are comparable to and perhaps affiliated with MS-13, one of the largest street gangs in the United States. Therefore, the opposition to the US-led UN resolution is pushing for US itself to send its own soldiers to dismantle the gangs in Haiti. Do you remember when the #Clinton administration had to send U.S. soldiers to stop a #coup in Haiti by the U.S. government? Yes, history is repeating itself. How do we stop it? There flows the path for the logline of the hypothetical film title 'Made In Miami.'"
