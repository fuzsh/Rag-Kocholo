        "text": "Review-'3 Peas in a Pod' by Michelle Chong\n\nWarning: Major spoilers ahead pertaining to the twist of the film.\n\nThe titular “3 Peas in a Pod” are Penny, Perry and Peter; three twenty-somethings who have became close friends during their undergraduate years in an Australian college. Penny likes Peter, but thinks that Perry likes her. As the date of their graduation looms near, Peter wishes to delay their inevitable separation and invites the three to go on a road trip across Australia. There are two likely ways to make this plot original: 1) the three somehow end up in a polyamorous relationship or 2) someone is gay all along. Considering that all three main characters are Asians, it is not hard to predict which direction the film will take.\n\nHaruki Murakami stated in an interview that his work presents women as mediums and that “the function of the medium is to make something happen through herself”. Penny, the supposed protagonist of this movie, is arguably less of a dynamic character and more of a medium for the character arcs of her male friends. As the film is chiefly told through her perspective as the witness of the increasing tension between the two men, the audience is easily misled that she is the source of the conflict between Peter and Perry. It is after the revelation that the two men were in love all along when we come to question the true nature of the conflict. More significantly, it becomes clear that the awkward gestures of affection directed towards Penny are actually meant for each other. Regardless of the genuineness of their friendship with Penny, Penny as a character is nevertheless on one level a means of an end to facilitate the relationship of the two men throughout the film.\n\nOne may perceive the “chick flick” tropes used to characterize Penny as hints that it is okay to not be emotionally invested in her own character arc. While most films take the audience’s emotional investment in their female lead for granted, this film shows a hint of self-awareness that makes the obligatory love triangle plot less frustrating. Like a typical “chick flick” heroine, Penny introduces herself through voiceover as just an ordinary girl, yet is shown to perceive a stranger alerting her to an administrative error as an attempt at flirting. Penny’s act of voluntarily doing her crush’s homework may seem like a comical portrayal of the extents of a young woman’s infatuation; but as any university freshman who have faithfully attended their mandatory Academic Integrity lectures would know, this is a form of academic misconduct known as collusion. When Penny’s snooping of the contents of Perry’s phone leads to the film’s grand revelation, we come to wonder if the lead up to this grand revelation requires a protagonist who has no qualms with snooping.\n\nThe sense that the twist is absolutely gratuitous is alleviated through the rearrangement of previous clips into a straightforward love story between the two men. The film goes all the way to give the audience a preview of the unconventional romance that it could have been while undermining the romantic drama that it has painstakingly set up for most of the film. Through doing so rather than outrightly subverting genre conventions, the film is arguably more effective in showing how an attachment to tired tropes could dampen the emotional resonance of a love story.\n\nWhile the heavy application of romantic tropes may lead viewers to be more interested in the scenic Australian landscapes than the characters, “3 Peas in a Pod” ultimately redeems itself through juxtaposing in its final act what the conventional audience wants it to be and what it could have been. The film’s hints of self-awareness makes its depiction of young adult angst more ironic and thus, more bearable.\n\nReview by Joseline Yu\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSingapore Biennale 2013 Special: Liao Jiekai & Boo Junfeng\n\nThe year 2013 has been an eventful year for Singaporean cinema and filmmakers, not least for two very special filmmaking talents. Both Liao Jiekai and Boo Junfeng had a memorable year to date, notching up accolades that saw them being credited as joint winners of the President's Young Talents Awards, as well as being commissioned and invited to be part of the prestigious Singapore Biennale this year.\n\nAs the Biennale season is upon us, SINdie took the chance to sit down with the both of them to look back at their achievements, reflect upon each other's successes and chat with them about what is in store for their near futures as the year draws to a close.\n\n(From left to right front): Liao Jiekai, President Tony Tan & Boo Junfeng\n\nPresident's Young Talents Credit Suisse Artist Commissioning Award ceremony\n\nPhoto courtesy of Artitute™\n\nKay Wee (K): I think looking back at the year 2013, as filmmakers and artists, both of your milestones and trajectories feel very similar, as if they were running on parallel lines. Belonging to the same generation of prominent Singaporean filmmakers, both of you were selected to be in the President's Young Talents (PYT) exhibition this year, were the two winners of the subsequent PYT Credit Suisse Artist Commissioning Award, got invited to participate in the Singapore Biennale, had both of your two art works exhibited in the same compounds concurrently, and both of you are also developing your sophomore feature films at the moment. Let’s go back to the beginning first. How did your involvement in the PYT awards actually come about?\n\nJiekai (LJK): For the PYT awards, basically…I think Junfeng and I are probably quite similar la, because it's the same type of exhibition. So we were invited to a portfolio presentation to a selected external panel that were not from the Singapore Arts Museum. And then, I don’t know how they nominated us or chose us, they just asked us to come and we went, presented and later they told us we are chosen to participate in the PYT show this year. And then, we were given a budget and a very, very short run up time to present a new work at the arts museum.\n\nJunfeng (BJF): So what happened is…for me it was Cheo Chai Hiang (Visual Artist and Local Conceptual Art Pioneer), he saw 'Sandcastles' (Boo Junfeng, 2010) and he liked it and he thought it might be interesting for me to explore a different realm, because I’ve just been concentrating a lot in narrative filmmaking. So I think after that, he made the recommendation and I was invited to the panel presentation. It was really just to present my short films, talk about the thought processes behind them, the ideology behind them and to see if they are suitable for visual arts or their showcase. I thought it's quite interesting because you know, the both of us are filmmakers and they chose us to be involved. So that was the first time I was ever actually even involved in anything visual arts related. I enjoy going to museums and all that, but I've never done anything for a gallery space before.\n\nK: So how were the experiences of exhibiting in a museum, as compared to maybe the cinemas, different for you? Does it change the way you work, in terms of your approach towards your ‘museum works’ this year?\n\nBoo Junfeng and his PYT work 'Mirror'\n\nPhoto courtesy of SAM\n\nBJF: Well, for 'Mirror', I wanted to create something that was still cinematic, because that was what I knew or something that I understood. But it was maybe the idea of…expanding it to just two screens, and allowing both screens to sort of interact with one another. And it's inspired by the idea of a ‘split’, in history and in the two realities of these characters, playing with the idea of that. It’s conceptual. It was more conceptual than what I’m used to. Usually when I start with a film I start with a character or a subject matter. But in this case I had to force myself to look at it in a more conceptual level: how the idea can be represented in a space rather than it being simply within the frame of a film.\n\nLiao Jiekai and his PYT work 'Brothers Quarters'\n\nPhoto courtesy of SAM\n\nLJK: The context of showing the work definitely affects the way I conceive of the project. The moving-image is a durational medium. When I make a work, I craft an audio and visual experience for the audience through time. When I make work for the cinema, I focus on the film itself, to create that 4th dimension for the viewer to engage in. In a museum, space becomes another factor other than time, because the audience can walk around the space, interact with different elements, something that won't happen in a cinema.\n\nFor 'Brother's Quarters', I look at my work as a form of intervention. Firstly, I intentionally isolated my work from the rest of the exhibition by building a wall with a sliding door (which really is a door because of safety protocols, if not I rather it be a wall), making it difficult for the audience to locate the piece, so when they found it, it became some form of a hidden chamber that they walked into. I used many elements to create the installation: wall texts, audio, archival floorplans, 16mm film running on loops, lighting and even a making-of video of the work. For me, 'Brother's Quarters' is about laying bare my process of creating the work, the interviews I did with formal SJI students (one of which includes improvisational music by Leslie Low), the process of working with 16mm celluloid film - a dying medium, and the durational aspect of having to maintain and transform the work over the nine months long exhibition. At the end of the show, only one projector is working, there is a new corner of the room dedicated to broken projectors and burnt film strips, and I opened up the sliding door to create an open passageway to link up Brother's Quarters to the rest of the exhibition.\n\nJeremy (J): Jiekai, how about your approach to your Singapore Biennale piece, 'Bukit Orang Salah'?\n\nLJK:The title of my work is 'Bukit Orang Salah', which means “Island of Misfits”. A few years ago I started writing a screenplay for a film to be made about islands, but not specifically about St John’s Island. I’ve always been interested in all these outlying islands.\n\nAt first I was thinking about Pulau Ubin because I used to go there very very often, like ten, twenty times a year, to camp or to do various things. But St John’s Island is still kind of a mystery; in fact it’s become like a memory, because I remember going there when I was in primary school. I still have very vivid memories of the place.\n\nStill from 'Bukit Orang Salah' (Liao Jiekai, 2013)\n\nPhoto courtesy of artist.\n\nSo I just went to do like a recce trip, to find out whether it was a possibility, to just see the place. So I went, and I was very fascinated by how it hasn’t changed. What I remember it being in the 90s still remains the same, unlike many parts of Singapore—even Pulau Ubin is completely different from what it used to be, but St John’s Island never changed, from what I remember.\n\nWell actually, one thing did change, it was merged together with three islands. So after more research I found out that there was actually a proposal to turn the entire chain of islands into something like Sentosa Cove. In fact their reference was Venice. But it didn’t become like that. In fact, they built a very nice harbour and then they renovated the roads and they connected all three islands together and everything, but they just left it there and it didn’t happen la, basically. So I thought that place becomes a very interesting meeting point between what could have been and also what was in the past, and also because the island has such a strong and important history in our country, being a quarantine centre, so most of our forefathers were imprisoned there, or quarantined there for some time.\n\nLiao Jiekai on set for 'Bukit Orang Salah'\n\nPhoto Credit: Looi Wan Ping\n\nJ: So can I say your idea for St John’s Island was actually already kind of in your mind before the Biennale came about, and it was always a part of your—\n\nLJK: I think it was something I always wanted to…it was a point of interest but it didn’t really become a work until I had to come up with something for the Biennale. It was during the PYT exhibition that they asked us each to submit a proposal, and they gave us something like two weeks. So I just made a trip to the Island, went to the National Library and did all this research, and then I put together something.\n\nJ: How about you, Junfeng? Was your Singapore Biennale piece 'Happy and Free' something that you conceptualised from scratch or is it something that—I wouldn’t say it’s part of an agenda—but are these themes that you’ve always wanted to present, and perhaps this was a convenient platform for you to realise this?\n\nBJF: I remember they were also asking me to come up with an idea, I can’t remember at which stage, but I was in Jerusalem for a film lab, and in between the mentorship sessions and writing and all that, I was forced to come up with this idea. So I was just staring at the screen and because the Biennale theme is “If the world changed”, I was just toying with the idea of…I guess for me the starting point is always Singapore, so what, how different might this place be. It was actually from the theme that this “what if” concept came about, and of course then I was looking at the different points in Singapore’s history; what, which specific point did I want to cover, which I thought was interesting…\n\nStill from 'Happy and Free' (Boo Junfeng, 2013)\n\nPhoto Credit: Wilfred Weegee\n\nSo I thought of independence, and most obvious thing was between 1963 and 1965 there’s actually a period that is still quite under-represented in how we understand history. If you think about it, it’s essentially the most crucial period of Singapore right? How Singapore came to be, because we were supposed to be part of Malaya and that didn’t work out. So when I submitted the proposal “What if Singapore was different, was still a part of Malaysia, what would a propaganda video today look like?” and this was tied in to the idea that if we hadn’t separated, 2013 would be the 50thyear of merger, so then it must be a big year, right. This year would have been such a big, big year for the golden jubilee and since the Biennale is to happen around the same time I though it’d be interesting to explore that.\n\nAs I was working on the idea I started asking people about what Singapore might look like and all that. A lot of people seemed to feel, the overwhelming response I got was that \"Oh, we will be worse off! We will at most be like a Penang\". We tend to see ourselves being lesser if we had remained. While there might be some truth in that I can’t help but feel that believing in that is also subscribing to what I call the “1965 narrative” because after this separation, we want to believe that we can make it. “There was a time when people said that Singapore can’t make it but we did”, right? So that comes in a song that was written and so I can’t help but feel that this belief is also a part of that narrative.\n\nBoo Junfeng on set for 'Happy and Free'\n\nPhoto Credit: Wilfred Weegee\n\nSo how do I want to break that down, and suggest something that perhaps challenges people’s idea of what Singapore is and what it has become, and then on top of that, I remember Alfian Sa’at, a good friend of mine, once telling me about this album of songs that a friend of his passed to him, and when I got that album of songs and I heard all these songs that celebrated merger, in 1963, and how this album basically vanished after 1965, and this was commissioned by the Ministry of Culture in Singapore. So if that narrative from 1963, which I’m hearing from the songs, was to continue till today, what that might be? It just opens so many possibilities but again in defining this alternative history, I had to really, really narrow it down and it helped that I was framing it as propaganda, I was framing it as something like a National Day type of thing so I could very narrowly define this narrative and then inadvertently it kind of then subverted the idea of national, our national day celebrations and the idea of nation, the construct of a nation and what it is.\n\nSo it was a very, very interesting process for me. On September 16 I went to KL on the day of merger. It was Malaysia Day and I heard from people what their idea of Malaysia Day was, and to a lot of people there, Malaysia Day was the more inclusive day, because it was the day when Sabah and Sarawak also came to be a part of Malaysia. Malaysia Day became almost a reaction to Merdeka Day, which was actually the independence of Malaya, which was for a long time the national, the independence day of Malaysia, but Malaysia Day only in recent years came to prominence because people wanted something more inclusive and so now they sort of have two national days, Merdeka Day and Malaysia Day and of course in Singapore apart from August the 9thwe don’t celebrate or we don’t talk about any of these other days, which were actually a part of our history, especially Sept 16. So, these are some of the things that came to my mind as I was researching for the piece.\n\nK: So in terms of both of your Biennale works, I observed these “audio-centric extensions” out from the frame of the moving visuals into the physical space itself. Like for example, in terms of Junfeng’s work, there’s this whole participatory and interactive aspect of the karaoke element in place. So, tell me why did you choose to make it as such, or make your installation more “fun”, so to speak? What was your intention?\n\nBJF:I wanted people to sing the song and perhaps feel how awkward and funny it is to utter those lyrics, to sing those lyrics out loud. To say lines like “happy and free, in a bigger family, equal and free, with merger and Malaysia”, how awkward it feels to sing lyrics like that today, and why. I think the complexity of just that sentiment is very interesting and that is actually at the core of my work, what the piece is about.\n\nK: As for Jiekai, in your 'Bukit Orang Salah', you added three different sound design layers, on top of the one imbedded into the film itself. Why this decision to experiment with different audios from different channels in the gallery space?\n\nLJK:Actually one of my initial proposals to the Biennale was that I wanted to hear different sounds in different parts of the room but it’s quite technically difficult to achieve that and in fact I wanted something like you go close to the wall, you hear different sounds in different parts of the room, because I wanted to explore the more interactive components to showing a video work in the gallery space. So I approached Bani Haykal (Sound Artist and Musician) to do the sound design, and he actually suggested something very similar to my initial proposal, which was having different sounds in different parts of the room.\n\nWe had a very short incubation time. We had only a bit more than one month lead up to work on the sound. And actually Bani is very busy, so most of our dialogue happened via email. He sent me an email questionnaire, like 30 interview questions, very, very long, and at that time I was in Indonesia and I wrote a reply and from these email conversations he gleaned about three or four different themes, in which he used to compose different soundtracks to the film and those different themes are presented in the different headphones that you can pick up at the three different stations.\n\nThe filmmakers and the SINdie correspondents during the roundtable interview\n\nK: So I’ve chanced upon some articles and interviews on the both of you and Jiekai, you’ve always been termed as both a filmmaker and visual artist, but interestingly for yours Junfeng, you are usually termed as simply a filmmaker, even in the PYT or Biennale context this year. So what do you guys think of these labels and where do you guys think you stand in between being an artistor/and filmmaker now? Should there even be a distinction in the first place?\n\nBJF: I’ve never been called an artist until this year. Haha. Even in my engagements with say, Arts Engage, and all these organisations where we talk about arts policy, about art making, about the art making community in Singapore, it’s quite often artistsand filmmakers, so it’s always sort of a slight separation but only this year because my work is in a gallery I became an “artist”. To me it doesn’t really matter. At the core of what I do…I see myself making films in whichever form. I don’t really care. My interest is still in narrative films but doing works like that actually opens my mind and broadens my view of what art is and what filmmaking can be as well so it’s been very educational.\n\nLJK: For me these labels are not important also. My background is in visual arts. I paint, and my first video was actually not a film, it was a video installation, at the Singapore Arts Museum also. So I kind of move in between different ways of showing the world, whether is it in a gallery or whether is it in a cinema. I mean sometimes I call myself a filmmaker or I call myself an artist and it’s really out of convenience, so people don’t get—it’s really subscribing to a way that people box up or people label things but personally I don’t believe in that. I think that’s not important. But I think it’s important to understand the expectations of the audience when they come into an art show and when they come into a cinema, because they’re very different.\n\nBJF:Actually, I mean…among the filmmakers in Singapore, a lot of them, whom I have respect for, they tend to be rather multi-disciplinary, people like Ho Tzu Nyen, Brian Gothong Tan, Jiekai, even like Tan Pin Pin also. If filmmaking is but a medium of expression, then you know…we wouldn’t narrow that field of vision so much. We would be keen to explore if given the opportunities.\n\nJ: Speaking about labels, do you ever feel pressured by the manner you wish to present yourself as a filmmaker, with regards to aligning and marketing yourself between the so-called distinctions of “arthouse” and “commercial” for example? Let’s say five, ten years down the road you want to make a commercially successful film, do you think it’s important for you to present yourself in the theme / agenda of a certain label?\n\nBJF: I don’t think so. I mean, first of all I’ve never believed that something critically acclaimed and something with mass appeal has to be mutually exclusive. If you take Ilo Ilo (Anthony Chen, 2013) as an example, it is a good film, and of course I think the Singapore public—to many in the Singapore public—they’re only starting to be exposed to films that are perhaps different from the usual mainstream fare that they get but I think that’s precisely the function—okay, not the function but one of the functions—of films like that, it helps in raising cultural literacy, it helps in opening people’s minds so that film doesn’t have to be just about entertainment, there can be other forms of films to watch and if you’re talking about being like an artist vs. being a filmmaker and all that. The labels aren’t really so important, personally I just let the press go with whatever they want to call me, or whatever the PR company / marketing team wants to call me / the work or whatever. I mean, if I don’t agree with it I might resist it, but I don’t really care la.\n\nJ: For me, it’s interesting to note that for Ilo Ilo when the posters first came out in Cannes, they looked more art-housey. But when the poster was then modified to give it a more heartland commercial movie look (with the cartoon drawings and all), that to me was a form of succumbing to the market and fitting into labels to make the movie look more accessible.\n\nBJF: I think that exercise was an interesting one. When I first heard they were going to do that, I thought that was interesting because what you want to have is a foot in the door. To have a Cannes label on it, for the masses, may not mean anything. In fact, sometimes it might mean, “Oh, this must be a boring art house film”. So what if we break it down, what if we market it to be a more ‘palatable’ film and see what kind of audiences it attracts. It is an interesting exercise but it is also a double-edge sword, because ultimately it is not a Jack Neo film. If people went in with these expectations, they could either be pleasantly surprised or disappointed. And the word of mouth from that may not be good, because we might be targeting the so-called ‘wrong’ audience, as much as we do want this ‘wrong’ audience to give it a try.\n\nJS: (To LJK) What’s your view on this?\n\nLJK: I certainly liked the original poster more. But like what Junfeng said, it’s a marketing tool. It’s like trailers. Trailers don’t represent the film at all. I made my 'Red Dragonflies' (Liao Jiekai, 2010) trailer using many out-takes. I mean, there were several out-takes that I liked but could not put it in the film. So I think a film can be very different from all the devices, means and labels from how people try to market it.\n\nBJF: For some of us, where the ‘mission’, so to speak, is to really expand the audience to different kinds of cinema, these steps are ultimately necessary. Because otherwise you would always just have that split between what is art-house and what is so-called commercial. And the audience will also be split and clearly, the art-house audience will always remain that minority and you will never be able to make films that are critically acclaimed with a sizeable audience. So in that endeavour to expand our audience, these steps are necessary. So even if people walk out of the cinema feeling they were short-changed for whatever reasons, at least there is a film that they have seen and judge for themselves, and hopefully in the future they can give films like that another chance.\n\nK: As an observer and an audience, I actually find lots of similarities between both of your works. Referencing both your first feature films (Sandcastles & Red Dragonflies) and the two works presented at PYT (Mirror & Brothers Quarters) and the Singapore Biennale (Happy and Free & Bukit Orang Salah), there was to me this common theme of “looking back” and always this heavy historical element attached to them. So can you tell me more about what drives you to make your works and what are both of you normally inspired by?\n\nBJF: I don’t think it’s just confined to us. I mean in general, if you look at a lot of filmmakers in Singapore, there is always a desire, whether consciously or not, to look back. Perhaps, it speaks of a kind of society we live in and the kind of changes we are going through and the kind of physical changes we experience and the things, places and the memories that have been lost as a result. It’s just reclaiming a lot of that and an attempt to immortalize some of these either places, or sentiments, or emotions. (pause) I was also hearing from the curators of the Biennale that in fact, it’s not just confined to filmmakers. A lot of the works from the Singaporean artists are about the past, like Lai Chee Kien has a work on the National Theatre reconstructed and Royston Tan’s one is also about the Capitol Theatre, so it’s always about these things that we have lost.\n\nAditi (A): I observed that most of your works look at the past but they don’t necessarily take a sentimental view at it. But I feel like there is a national obsession with nostalgia at the moment. Do you have any takes on this and do you consciously try to be more objective when dealing with the past?\n\nLJK: I actually think that nostalgia can be dangerous because you cannot always be dwelling and thinking that the past is better than the present or the future. So, I don’t want to sentimentalise the past. That’s never my intention. I agree with Junfeng that it’s not just us who are dealing with these narratives of the past. Even if you look Singapore films in the past ten years, there were a lot of nostalgic elements. Even when we make films that are contemporary, the production designer will always like to find things that are vintage, cause things that are old attract us? But I will be quite careful with how I deal with it. I don’t like to evoke nostalgia just for the sake of sentimentalizing it.\n\nK: Okay, so now if you have to ask each other one question, what would it be?\n\nLJK & BJF: (awkward smiles) Haha…erm…\n\nLJK:Maybe I ask first la. I think one thing that I thought about when I looked at 'Happy and Free' was that it resembles some kind of an imagined National Day video but you were also involved in NDP before. So how do you see these two different experiences? Because when you were involved in the real NDP two or three years ago, you were constructing a certain narrative that was relevant to present day Singapore or that kind of, say…propaganda. So how do you balance with what you think Singapore is and what the organisers want the public to think, and then comparing it to this particular work that you made?\n\nBJF: I actually didn’t do the National Day videos. I did the multimedia for National Day Parade (NDP) 2010. When I was doing that, I laid it out quite clearly to the committee that I wanted to present something that felt real. I wanted sentiments that were real. For example, I posed a question of what the five stars represent, actually I had a whole chunk of people who went blank and they got it all wrong. Apparently, several people think ‘prosperity’ is one of the 5 stars. So that to me was an interesting exercise because I interviewed a lot of people. And subsequently when I did the multimedia for the 'Fear of Writing', a play by Tan Tarn How under Theatreworks, I did exactly the same thing. I asked very similar questions and that was when I was allowed to put in all the wrong answers people gave. Like I had a lot of people saying ‘prosperity’. So for the NDP version, I showed that people didn’t know and they laughed. When you have 30,000 over people laughing at the same time at how they also didn’t know, it binds people la, if you know what I mean. Because there is some truth and it was the truth that I was interested in.\n\nStill from 'Pink Dot 2013: Home' (Boo Junfeng, 2013)\n\nPhoto courtesy of pinkdot.sg\n\nPerhaps the closest I have come to in making something that looks like a National Day music video was actually this year’s Pink Dot campaign video with the song ‘Home’ performed by Dick Lee. I was examining what home means to these characters in the video (who are LGBT) and how that is presented with a song like ‘Home’ means and resonates with people. So, I would say these videos are like part advertising, because we are ultimately trying to evoke something, trying to pull some kind of commonality, in order to propagate an ideology from whoever is commissioning this piece. So in doing ‘Happy and Free’, I was also toying with the idea of how a song like this, with lyrics that sound so awkward in today’s Singapore, when matched with a National Day type of video or even campaign (I even came up with a fictitious Ministry of Culture and 50thanniversary event), how is it unimaginable? And if I were to imagine the unimaginable, how would people respond to it? It’s always an interesting exercise working on these projects, whether it is NDP or Pink Dot...because ultimately it is an understanding of the pervading sentiments in society and how to make use of that to fulfil a certain agenda. That’s what NDP is about, right?\n\nK: Haha. Okay, your turn to ask Jiekai a question now.\n\nBJF: Hmm…well, my favourite works of yours are the ones that seem very deeply personal and I think I mentioned to you before, 'Before the Wedlock House' (Liao Jiekai, 2012), that piece to me was one of the best short films I have seen from Singapore because it is so deeply personal and yet it is not indulgent. I could see things from your perspective and see that love that the video was made for. So it is always fascinating to see how you present something so personal in a piece of work. Do the works that you do always come from a very personal place? And how do you find the balance between what you choose to present and what you choose not to indulge in?\n\nLJK: For most of my works, the starting point is always personal. But the more personal it is, the more difficult it is for me to confront. For instance, for ‘Before the Wedlock House’, it was done very spontaneously. I didn’t even think about making a film. The night before, I just decided that I was going to make a film. The night after I shot it, I shelved it. I did look through the footages but I didn’t know what to do with it. Then I saw some films that lent me ideas and strategies that I could use on these. So I thought I could put something together with them. And that’s how the film came about.\n\nStill from 'Before the Wedlock House'(Liao Jiekai, 2012)\n\nPhoto courtesy of artist\n\nI think there are some things that, because they are so personal to you, nobody else can see them except you. So I think it is also about finding that balance, because if not, it will look like a video that you made for your own indulgence, compared to something that can speak to the larger audience. I also think that sometimes the more personal you get, the more universal it is. This is because everyone experiences the same things in their own unique environment in their own way.\n\nBJF: If you watch a wedding video. Unless they are close friends, you usually do not feel much for the people inside. But I felt something for your cousin. It was a happy occasion, but at the same time, you also feel something very poignant about everything that she said, about your childhood together and the bond you had.\n\nLJK: I shot it as a reaction to many wedding videos I see. At some point in time, I got a bit disillusioned with wedding videos because they are so formulaic. At one of my other cousin’s wedding, the videographers were actually staging things. For instance, they said ‘Now we need the bride to thank the parents’. It was not planned for and they needed the shot and it seemed they already had a story to tell already.\n\nK: One last question. I know you guys are in the midst of developing your second features now, so from an audience point of view, what can we expect from them?\n\nBJF:For mine, we have not officially started pre-production but we have started casting for six months now. Hopefully, we can shoot next year, if everything goes according to plan. But the earliest the film will be out will be early 2015. We first presented it two years ago at Rotterdam and subsequently it was invited to the Jerusalem Film Lab, so I went to Jerusalem three times to develop the script with the script analyst. That was very helpful. And back and forth...I feel that this back and forth is really what film development should be, like I really properly went through the process and quite often it is very challenging. Well, writing is a very solitary process, but then to have these people enter this world of yours, dissect everything, analyse everything, put everything back for you and help you discuss it through...it really, really does something quite magical to the script. It's always a learning process.\n\nLJK: In my case, I've already shot the film, am editing it right now and it's been an editing hell la. The analogy I have been giving people is that it's like a 50,000 piece jigsaw puzzle that has only seen the sky. You know, when you do jigsaw puzzles, the sky and the forest and the sea are the most difficult parts right? So I think I am still trying a lot of permutations, but I am also working with two other editors so we are trying out different ways of cutting it together. I realize for my longer projects I could never...after I shoot it, I can never really edit it to the script. Somehow it just transforms beyond the pages. Because sometimes when I shoot I deviate a lot, so it feels like I am finding the film in the sea of footages. So it can be quite painful.\n\nBJF: Haha. But when it emerges it can be quite beautiful la.\n\nLJK: Hahaha. I don't know, haven't seen the light yet. Very far away still. The film's setting is very similar to my Biennale piece, but it is also very different. It is a romance story that takes place in two different eras, that's all I will say for now.\n\n(From left): Aditi Shivaramakrishnan (SINdie), Thong Kay Wee (SINdie), Boo Junfeng, Jeremy Sing (SINdie), Liao Jiekai\n\nThe \"Singapore Biennale 2013: If The World Changed\" will be running till the 16 February 2014.\n\n(Both 'Happy and Free' and 'Bukit Orang Salah'can be viewed at SAM8Q as part of the event.)\n\nLiao Jiekai's 'Before the Wedlock House' is available for viewing here, courtesy of SG Film Channel.\n\nBoo Junfeng's 'Pink Dot 2013: Home' is available for viewing here, courtesy of Pink Dot SG.\n\n↧\n\nThe 2013 Gala Behaviour (and Misbehaviour) Report\n\nGala premieres in Singapore are becoming big affairs.

She decided she wanted to be a film critic in Junior College and save the world from bad movie reviews. She doesn't like holding a camera but enjoyed every moment losing herself in film theory when writing her thesis entitled Docufiction in the Digital Age. She still cherishes the first time she watched Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful (1997) with her mother on Arts Central one night, and being completely devastated and swept away by the film.

Yiz has been writing with SINdie since 2011.\n\nColin Low\n\nColin is one of the pioneer members of SINdie, having joined the team in 2009. Bringing with him a point of view way beyond his years, he has been instrumental in shaping the 'personality' of the writing seen on SINdie in its early years. He is currently studying English LIterature at the University of Chicago and would occasionally contribute his writings to SINdie.\n\nJeremy Sing\n\nJeremy is the founder and editor of SINdie. He started SINdie in 2008 as a platform for local films, including short films to be seen and heard about. He's always loved cinema but picked up the camera and started making short films in 2005. He's since been involved in several local film productions in various capacities including producer, assistant director and production assistant. The films include 'Ah Boys to Men' (Part 1 & 2), The Lucky Seven Project, Keluar Baris and several others. Not known to some, he actually holds a full-time office job in Public Relations. Work and SINdie aside, the dream to make a feature film is still very much alive and he hopes to cross his first hurdle of finishing his script soon.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nIndependent Filmmaking in Singapore - A Brave 10 Years\n\nAn 'all-stars' shot on the set of The Lucky Seven Project, taken in 2007, that features some of the most active figures and voices in independent filmmaking today\n\nSingapore went into a filmmaking coma from the late 70s into the early 90s. And to think Singapore used to be busily making 200-300 films in 50s and was ahead of Hong Kong in the game then. Looking at the current flurry of filmmaking efforts, begs the question of when we woke up from the coma. ‘Mee Pok Man’ was almost a buzzword in the late 90s when it signaled the existence of filmmaking activity then. ‘Money No Enough’ seemed like the next sign of a resurgence. Then came ’12 Storeys’. But all in all, it seemed like the efforts of a few men (Jack Neo, Eric Khoo or Glen Goei) who saw the possibility of filmmaking in Singapore earlier than many others. There was still a nagging thought: how about ‘normal’ people like us? Can we make films too?\n\nThe year 2003 marked the beginning of a few platforms that seemed to help surface new names in independent filmmaking. The Substation started its monthly programme called First Takes, where anyone could air their first films to the public. The rule was ‘don’t judge, just air’. First Takes stood the middle-ground between film practitioners and hobbyists. It offered film practitioners a chance for a quick public feedback while it also gave film hobbyists who didn’t feel confident enough to submit their films to film festivals a chance to screen their finished product without hiring a venue.\n\nIn the same year, the ‘Fly By Night’ video challenge was started by film curator Yuni Hadi and filmmaker Tan Pin Pin. This brought many people, particularly of a young age, together to make a video based on a theme over a weekend. Over the years, it soon became a ‘social-leveller’ in filmmaking, telling the man-on-the-street that you can create your own cool videos without a big crew and a lot of time. Not to mention, the Objectifs Centre of Photography and Film was also started in 2003, providing an opportunity for wannabe-filmmakers to get basic level knowledge of filmmaking, and in particular, digital filmmaking.\n\nNaturally, ‘Fly By Night’ and Objectifs signaled the start of the digital-filmmaking revolution which lowered the barriers to filmmaking and allowed anyone with a story to tell to pick up the camera and just shoot. Till today, filmmaker Kan Lume sets the record for making a feature length film on DV camera with just under $1000. That film was ‘The Art of Flirting’.\n\nFinally, also in 2003, Singapore Short Cuts, a more selectively curated screening of Singapore short films, was launched. This was like a ‘Best of Singapore Shorts’ showcase which brought prominence to several names in independent filmmaking over the years like Victric Thng, Eva Tang, Boo Junfeng and Wee Li Lin.\n\nSo in fact, one can argue that the current movement that we see in the film community or even film fraternity is roughly 10 years old. David Lee, Vice-President of the Singapore Film Society, recalls that when he returned from university in Australia in late 2002, ‘filmmakers like Sun Koh, Han Yew Kwang were just starting out, and so were a slew of other filmmakers like Tzang Merwyn Tong who continue to be active today.’ Sun Koh won the Silver Hugo Award with her first short film ‘My Secret Heaven’, Han Yew Kwang won ‘Best Short Film’ at the Singapore International Film Festival in 2002. At the same time, Royston Tan’s seminal short film ‘15’ (picture below) also surfaced in the scene, having won several awards overseas. David adds, ’You can feel there's a burgeoning film community with a new generation of filmmakers, a 2nd wave of filmmakers whom I will refer to as the post-2000 wave.’\n\nIndeed, there was a newly-found courage imminent in the scene and the name Royston Tan (in the rabbit suit above) somehow had embodied this courage. His short films won him numerous awards from various film festivals. He was named TIME magazine’s Top 20 Asian heroes in 2004. While being hailed as the new poster boy of Singapore cinema then, he was also tagged as being the L’enfant terrible of the scene, for being unflinchingly straight-talking in his style, unabashedly ‘obscene’ and honest in his depiction of street kids and in general, eschewing traditional cinematic storytelling rules with so much gusto. This was important for the filmmaking movement then as it bestowed it with a spirit of experimentation and adventure that went hand in hand with the new opportunities presented by ‘Fly By Night’, ‘Singapore Short Cuts’, ‘First Takes’ and the digital revolution in general.\n\nThe film ‘Ilo Ilo’ was certainly the story of the year in 2013 and needless to say, Anthony Chen was 2013’s poster boy. Anthony really emerged in the scene in the middle of this 10-year resurgence. In 2007, his short film ‘Ah Ma’ was the first Singapore short film to be competing in the Cannes Film Festival Short Film section and he won a Special Mention Award. He belongs to a generation of filmmakers who dug a little deeper into society, going beyond the sensation and mood that earlier filmmakers may have sought to explore. Boo Junfeng (pictured below), who earned his following from winning awards at the Singapore International Film Festival, was like a generational companion to Anthony. His films often peered into sensitive social, and sometimes, political issues. Despite his young age, his films often displayed a maturity beyond his years. David (Singapore Film Society)calls them part of the 3G (third generation) of Singapore filmmakers, with Jack Neo and Eric Khoo being part of the first; Royston Tan, Sun Koh, Wee Li Lin and Tan Pin Pin being part of the second.\n\nThis ‘3G’ class is a thoughtful, almost pensive class. They explore issues hard and deep, have very individualistic takes on things and delightfully, they vary greatly in their artistic approaches. Anthony and Junfeng aside, there is Liao Jiekai whose well-travelled first feature film ‘Red Dragonflies’ took a meditative view on change and growing-up in Singapore. There was also Loo Zihan who pushed the boundaries on sexuality in film with films like Solos and Pleasure Factory and also spoke for artistic integrity in his valedictorian speech, which was a protest against the school authorities asking him to change his final year film poster.\n\nWhile the bold strides these films made in the cinematic craft did not always find a sizeable audience in Singapore, there was always the film festival circuit audience willing to soak up these films and give due recognition to their works. Yuni Hadi, film curator, founder of Objectifs and Producer of ‘Ilo Ilo’ said, ’The interest film programmers have taken in Southeast Asian films in the last decade have created an international audience for us and opened up the world of critics and festival awards which have helped boost the interest in stories from our region. I remember sending out Singapore short films on VHS to festivals and cultural institutions overseas more than 10 years ago and very few people wanted to collaborate or even knew where Singapore was.’\n\nAlongside this ‘3G’ emergence, from 2007, Singapore seemed to be seeing a start of the ‘professionalisation’ of filmmaking with the ‘mushrooming’ of educational institutions offering formal courses in film. NTU emerged with a filmmaking programme, comprehensive enough to compete with Ngee Ann Polytechnic even though it was not focused on using actual film, but more digital. Then came the NYU Tisch School of the Arts as well as the La Salle College Putnam School of Film (pictured below) which both offered graduate programs in film. At the secondary school level, filmmaking groups emerged as CCAs replacing the relatively unsexy cousin, the AV (audio-visual) club. Evidently, there has been a greater demand for a proper film education. If a teenager was to tell his or her parents that he was going to film school, chances are, they may not nag about the impracticalities of a film career and actually be rather accepting.\n\nThe spreading of film education seemed to the second ‘leveller’ after the digital filmmaking revolution. In the last few years, film competitions like cine65, the 48 Hour Film Project, the New Paper First Film Fest and a dozen other mini film contests from a bevy of government statutory boards and corporations have lured entries from a widened pool of people, and in particular students (not just film students). In 2011, 13-year old Amos Yee took the top prize at the New Paper’s First Film Fest, suggesting how kids these days in Singapore may be starting to harbour Steven Speiberg or Martin Scorsese dreams. Aishah Abu Bakar, Programme Manager of the Substation’s Moving Images programme, remarks that ‘everyone, including secondary and primary school students can make films now’. Having been at the receiving point of film submissions for First Takes and the Singapore Short Film Awards for the past 4-5 years, she testifies to seeing how filmmaking is no longer the exclusive turf of a handful of individuals, ‘I think the scene is very vibrant. I'm particularly encouraged seeing younger filmmakers' works, from SOTA, some ITEs, and some polytechnic final year projects. They can surprise you with their depth, and the ideas or concepts behind these films, and I think it's so great that they feel empowered to try their hand at filmmaking as a form of expression.’\n\n10 years on in 2013, it seems we have arrived at the point where the big boys no longer have the best ideas and a generation whose sensitivities and sensibilities are honed on Facebook and Twitter are giving the occasional wise cracks in our film lingo. They just don’t have the experience, equipment and possibly the entourage (of the usual collaborators like DOP, sound etc). David (Singapore Film Society) quips, ’I can already see signs of a 4G - Singaporeans below 25 years old, becoming active in film screenings and talking about films, and most importantly starting to make films. What's interesting to note is that the younger generations are all if not primarily graduates from film schools, the film schools brats if you would, and coming from quite different backgrounds from the 1st generation early pioneers.’\n\nAnthony (pictured above), who won the Camera d’Or at Cannes and the Best Feature Film award at Golden Horse for ‘Ilo Ilo’ could be considered a product of a comprehensive film education, having gone from Ngee Ann Polytechnic to the National Film and Television School (in UK). And the disciplined approach to filmmaking was rather evident in ‘Ilo Ilo’. Therefore, with a 4th generation of new filmmakers, properly schooled, well-grounded in theory, are we ready to expect a Singapore New Wave of cinema? According to Yuni (producer of ‘Ilo Ilo’), ‘We’re in a good time because we are surrounded by a generation of practitioners who believe that we have a chance to grow beyond what we already have.’\n\nOne must not forget that Anthony’s success is also the success of relentless conviction to a dream, where textbooks and theory are only half the formula, where the journey to making the film is most of the time lonely. The fact that filmmaking has been ‘democratised’ to the wider population, resulting in more people pursuing the dream, may not necessarily increase our chances of winning more awards in the future. But it cannot be denied that there is a certain camaraderie that has been developed among the currently active independent filmmakers in which Anthony’s win was almost seen as everyone’s win, and that surely has a mutually-galvanising effect on each other to bring the bar higher. Yuni adds, ‘It is more important now more than ever that we stand together as community to move forward’.\n\nThe article is written by Jeremy Sing, editor of SINdie and he dedicates this article to Bertrand Lee, who is making a comeback in filmmaking this year with a Mandarin film called ‘The Abandoned’. Bertrand Lee was a pioneering filmmaker who belonged to the post-2000 class of filmmakers. His career was interrupted when a truck mowed him down in Mumbai in 2005 and he lost his left leg.\n\n↧\n\nReview - 'I Hugged The Berlin Patient' by Edgar Tang\n\nThe first man cured of HIV had walked out of the operating theatre alive and there is no stopping for a spritely young Singaporean, Edgar Tang, to find the one and only, Timothy Ray Brown. Edgar dreams to meet his American “idol” in person so badly that he decide to take a leap of faith and buy a ticket to the Berlin, where Timothy previously lived.\n\nWith limited information and clues in hand, Edgar remains determined and establishes connections with new friends he meet in the city. Despite the struggles at the start, he soon finds his way to meet Timothy's old friend, Christina, and Timothy's doctor who cured him using the stem cell transplant, Gero Hutter. However, his strongest connections do not lead him to Timothy immediately.\n\nHis luck takes a turn when he discovers that Timothy will be speaking at an event in Amsterdam. Edgar quickly contacts the conference manager but finds out that he has to work around the no-camera and privacy issues at the event venue. Surprisingly, the conference manager obliges to grant backstage interview and that means, he will finally be able to converse face-to-face with Timothy.\n\nWith chanceful glimpses of Timothy in the hotel prior to the interview, the big day arrives. Edgar is beyond ecstaticbut remains his composure and charm during their conversations at the restaurant and outside. They share moments of insight and discovery which certainly helps Edgar to understand the true man behind the 'Berlin patient' headlines.\n\nThe film portrays an honest and earnest depiction of Edgar's curious quest to find Timothy and put his unique case in a bigger spotlight. The story itself is special but its ending comes off as predictable, with title of film being a big giveaway. Ultimately, everyone loves a happy ending so, it is a win-win. One scene with Edgar going to the hospital to check on his flat foot appears trivial but it does enforce his point on doctor-patient relationship being impersonal and intimate at the same time.\n\nSome parts in the conversation between Edgar and Timothy are a little dry, but good enough to keep audience peeled to the end. Edgar tries to splice a fictitiousfeature as an analogy on HIV as an unsuspected “serial killer” showing a romantic couple wining and dining but ended with a brutal murder. This was confusing at first, with extended frames that make audience go what-has-this-got-to-do-with-the-quest, but able to piece the message eventually.\n\nAudience will be taken by Edgar's quirky and child like nature in the film. His search for Timothy resembles his personal journey in seeking hope and, indeed, hope finds him in the least expected way.\n\nReview by Haswani\n\n↧\n\nNotes from the Lab : 13 Little Pictures in Bangkok\n\nWe catch up with Daniel Hui (pictured right) of 13 Little Pictures who shares what happened at the 13 Little Pictures Film Lab held in Bangkok end of last year.\n\nCan you give us a refresher on what 13 Little Pictures is?\n\n13 Little Pictures is a collective of independent filmmakers bound by a spirit of collaboration and comradeship. We believe in making films and friends at the same time, because filmmaking is ultimately most refreshing when it is achieved collaboratively. By challenging, inspiring, and supporting each other, we hope to build a community of distinct individuals who share a similar spirit of adventure and love.\n\nThere are 24 participants from 7 countries , where are they from and what genres of films did you all receive?\n\nWe had participants from all over the region and the world. This year, we had participants from Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, the U.S., and Portugal. At the end of the lab, the participants made films ranging from narrative fiction, experimental documentary, essay film, dance film, to sound collage. The films were all mind-blowing and I am extremely proud that 13 Little Pictures played a part in bringing all these astounding filmmakers together.\n\nCan you elaborate more on the happenings at the film lab and it's goals?\n\nThe first three days of the lab consisted of intense workshopping sessions, where participants critiqued each other's film ideas and shared their opinions on cinema. We also had sharing sessions by filmmakers from 13 Little Pictures (Chris Yeo, Liao Jiekai, and myself) and Electric Eel Films (Anocha Suwichakornpong and Soros Sukhum). Over the next two days, the participants had to shoot and edit their films. There was a final critique of the rough cuts before the films were finally presented on the very last day. Two films were then awarded post-production prizes sponsored by Technicolor Asia.\n\nOur goal for this lab was to open up a space where people from vastly different backgrounds, experiences, political and artistic views could come together and make work collaboratively. We believe in creative tension, the sparks that fly when the minds of distinct individuals collide, because this reflects the spirit of 13 Little Pictures. I have personally learned so much from the participants of this lab. They have shown me that differences can not only be transcended, but also be used to augment one another, creating something that is much bigger than all of us.\n\nSince this is the 3rd edition , how did the films differ from the previous 2 editions ?\n\nThis year, we asked all the participants to submit a film idea revolving around the theme 'The Uncanny' along with their applications. This allowed us more time to interrogate each other's film ideas, which, I think, resulted in a greater variety of films in different genres. It also placed a greater emphasis on the films that were made at the end.\n\nHow is the indie film industry in Thailand? Could you elaborate more on the recurring themes/genre that is very often portayed in Thailand?\n\nMeeting the independent filmmakers in Thailand - many of whom were involved in the lab in one way or another - was absolutely inspiring for me. Never before have I met so many people who are both visionary and humble in equal measure. From an outsider's point of view, there seems to be a veritable filmmaking and film-watching community that is very receptive to new ideas and modes of expression. Sure there is still no money involved in independent filmmaking, but to me - and of course I run the risk of romanticizing things - there is a very precious flame there that cannot be easily extinguished by the demands of money and commercialism. I am especially excited by the fearlessness with which independent Thai cinema confronts sociopolitical issues.\n\nHow did you guys came about with the theme \"The Uncanny\" ?\n\nWe wanted a theme that sets a tone, a color, but also one that is broad enough to invite varied interpretations. More importantly, we wanted to give the participants room for imagination, and since \"The Uncanny\" marries both the strange and the familiar, we felt it would work best.\n\nCould you tell us what you'll be expecting from next year's 13 Little Pictures?\n\nThis year will be our fifth anniversary so it will be a very exciting year for us. For one, we are producing Glenn Goei's Yellow Flowers with mm2 Entertainment. The film will be written by Haresh Sharma and shot by Christopher Doyle. We have also just finished shooting Fundamentally Happy, a feature film directed by Tan Bee Thiam and Lei Yuan Bin. I will also have a new feature this year entitled Snakeskin.\n\nWhere is it possible for audiences to catch these films?\n\nSome of the participants are still putting their finishing touches to their films. Once the films are ready, we will put them up on our 13 Little Pictures YouTube channel. We are also excited to see them in film festivals around the world soon!\n\nInterview by Mohan Deitrich\n\n↧\n\nReview - \"Revealed\" by Michelle Yao & Tan Yun Ting (Viddsee Series)\n\nSINdie continues with its regular weekly reviews of selected short films from Viddsee, an online platform for filmmakers and viewers of Southeast Asian films.\n\n\"Revealed\" is the story of Brandon (Bobby Tonelli) and Jamie (Debra Teng), a good-looking, newly engaged yuppie couple living together. When Brandon's secret is suddenly revealed to his fiancée, the couple's domestic bliss suddenly unravels.\n\nIn its first half, \"Revealed\" suffers from a weak build-up. The film opens on a small party. The television plays a video montage of Brandon and Jamie's friends wishing them a happy engagement. Brandon officially proposes to Jamie in front of their guests. A tipsy friend, searching for the bathroom, instead chances upon a locked door. The film warms up slowly, with this opening sequence feeling rather artificial, obviously constructed to set in motion the plot. It is as though the leads take a while to warm up on screen, with the dialogue delivery initially rather stilted -- it does not quite come across as the mundane, comfortable chatter of lovers familiar with each other but feels like lines are being recited.\n\nThrough belaboured exposition Brandon is shown to be a lawyer, ostensibly a successful one given his crisp shirts, high-rise office and flashy sports car. However, this seems rather at odds with the work he is actually shown doing. His interactions with a fussy client seeking a divorce are mined for laughs, but do not elicit many, for the sullen tai tai with her nail polish, condescending attitude and exaggerated accent is neither charmingly flighty nor outlandishly annoying. Only in a second appearance does her character's purpose become apparent; it is hinted that Brandon is agitated—even disturbed—when someone shouts at him, even if that person is so obviously a caricature of petulance.\n\nYet, \"Revealed\" is worth persisting with as it improves considerably in the second half, once the plot is properly set in motion with Jamie's accidental discovery of Brandon's secret. It is suspenseful, and then touching, to watch as Jamie opens the now unlocked door, switches on the light, and goes through a range of emotions: curiosity, then confusion, and then surprise, delight and tenderness as she sees what she assumes is evidence of her fiancé's nurturing desires, of his wish to start a family together. Of course, the truth is far darker, stemming from something far longer unresolved. The sense of urgency is successfully built up with effective editing that cuts between the frantic shots of Brandon rushing home and Jamie's cautious exploration of the room.\n\nThe scenes that follow within the confines of the storeroom build up far more convincingly to a tense climax. Set design is a strong feature of \"Revealed\", with the limited physical space effectively used in this sequence in particular. The amount of white used—the white walls, the actors' white shirts—upon which a sickly yellow glow is cast by the lighting, with the garishly coloured toys scattered around the tight space, makes everything feel more sinister.\n\n\"Revealed\" began awkwardly, but is not a wasted watch for the actors, Tonelli in particular, do eventually ease into their characters sufficiently that they evoke sympathy. Ultimately, \"Revealed\" is a creditable effort that does make its point—about a serious subject, no less—but it would be stronger with tighter editing that omitted unnecessary scenes intended to inject humour for the sake of it.\n\nWatch \"Revealed\" here on Viddsee.\n\nReview by Aditi Shiva\n\nAditi Shiva works as an editor and is partial to semicolons. If her life were a movie, it'd be an animated indie Bollywood rom-com.\n\n***\n\nAbout Viddsee\n\nViddsee is an online video platform for filmmakers and audience of Southeast Asian short films. Built and designed by engineers and filmmakers, Viddsee enables users to easily discover, watch and share stories from Southeast Asia on their desktop and mobile devices.

Principal photography started in October 2013 in the city of Sanya, Hainan Island and wrapped up in 17.5 days .\n\nWe interview Yee Wei and Eric to find out more about their experience working on the film.\n\nAddressed to Chai YW -\n\n‘I want you’ will open in cinemas this March. How do you think the Singaporean audience will respond to the film oppose to the audience in China?\n\nI am not sure how they will respond to the film, as the Voice of China is not even shown on TV here. But what I am sure they will love the music in the film. For their fans, I am sure they will be glad that there are many songs new and old that will bring a smile to their face.\n\nWhat compelled you to take up directing ‘I want you’, despite being solely engaged as “Director-for-hire” and not being involved in casting, screen writing etc.?\n\nFor me, it is the opportunity to work with these group of artists. They are very popular in China, and to be able to work on this level is very exciting for me. A challenge it may be, because they are after all non actors, but the chance to work on the project that is purely a Chinese production with Chinese crew, will be good experience to have.\n\nOnly two other Singaporeans (Derrick Loo as Director of Photography and Eric Ng as Music Director) were involved in the production team of ‘I want you’, and thus filming plus post-shooting processes must have been very different from what you have been used to. Would you kindly share with us your experience?\n\nIn terms of the process of filmmaking, it is really not that much different. You get the material (script) and you work with what you have (cast, crew, art). You do script analysis, shots list and so on. What’s really challenging was the time given to execute the entire project. We had no rehearsal time, 17.5 days for shoot and only 2 days to get a final cut. The editor wasn’t someone I was familiar with and I didn’t get to have the final say on the final cut. So I didn’t even get to see the final results until the grading process. Many things wasn’t in my hands.\n\nDid you have to overcome a cultural barrier to direct this well and how did you overcome it?\n\nThere was, but it really wasn’t that big of a deal. Just go with the flow. Language wise was something I was worried about initially, but like I said, it didn’t take too long to get into their lingo.\n\nHaving worked on this, what are the differences between what the china audience likes and Singapore audience?\n\nI think eventually, I try to think universal. Emotions are universal, happiness, sadness, disappointments, etc. I wouldn’t say there are that much differences. When making the film, you go with your instinct more often than not and hope it transcends.\n\nYou have dabbled in horror, comedy, youth drama, and now, music drama. Which is your personal favourite so far and which genre can we be expecting from you in your next film?\n\nI love to work on anything that interests me, and I have lots of interests! I personally prefer things with a darker tone to it, and I think you will see me returning to dealing with heavier and darker materials in my future works.\n\nAddressed to Eric -\n\nHi Eric, you mentioned before that you had an epiphany writing Paper Plane, about the difference between a song and a hit song. Could we be so bold as to ask, what was the direction you initially had in mind for the tracks in ‘I want you’?\n\nSimple. I want ALL….the….songs….to be hit songs!\n\nYou had only 8 days to arrange 14 songs and write 2 of them. What inspired you during those 8 days that enabled you to accomplish this mean feat?\n\nPassion. Nothing is impossible without it.\n\nHow is the song writing for the film different from the ones you usually do?\n\nAnother reason what inspired me to work with these guys is I've watched them on the competition and know what they can accomplish, in terms of song writing, there's not much difference as it's a pop music film.\n\nThe only difference I guess is I can write or arrange the songs more musically challenging as I know they will be able to do it well!\n\n\"I want you\" will be opening in local cinemas come March 2014.\n\n↧\n\nReview - The Lion Men by Jack Neo ( J Team Productions )\n\nThe Lion Men ,\n\nLets welcome the latest production from J Team productions and the cast of Ah Boys to Men (1 & 2) back onto the big screen. With the locally successful army adaptation on National Service in the perspective of the young cohort of Generation Y, the director and cast has returned yet again to bring you another round of their trademark comedy style with a blend of emotions mixed up in the bunch.\n\nWith Jack Neo's decision in Ah Boys to Men to cast non-trained actors to form a band of boys who would helm his previous films, he has brought back the boys once again for a 2nd round of buddy films. With the inclusion of more newly cast actors and actresses, will this second round be a fresh idea for the audiences to accept or will audience be reminded too much of J Team's previous production...\n\nThe film revolves around a Lion dance troupe named \"Tiger Crane\" with the main plot focused on the 5 main cast members. A string of incidences causes a rift in the group and thus leading the creation of a new Lion Dance troupe named \"Storm Riders\". With the rival Lion Dance troupe \"Black Hawk\" joining the fray to compete in the Biggest Lion Dance Competition, all 3 Lion Dance troupes whips out all their skills in order to win the competition.\n\nWithout revealing much of the film, let’s talk about the various characters. The characters lack real motivation towards the competition. The finale of the competition seems to be undermined by all the sub plots being thrown into the film to in order to extend the length of the film. Audiences aren't looking for their money's worth by siting longer in a cinema but rather be entertained during the entire duration of the film.\n\nTruly Singapore may not excel in the field of CGI effects in film but the highlight of \"The Lion Men\" resides in the intricate choreography of Lion dance stunts. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, stunt men/women being hung on iron wires performing aerial feats and poses. Looks like that nostalgic feeling has returned after a long hiatus. No Hollywood CGI effects of actors performing stunts on a monitor screen, this is real people performing real stunts and getting hurt in the process. Having a real stuntmen perform these lion dance stunts showcase an authenticity in film that has been slowly lacking in the years. This is probably why we still go back to Youtube to watch Jet Li do the Lion dance fight in \"Once Upon a Time in China 3\" or Jackie Chan in his heydays performing superhuman stunts which would send shivers down your spine. Truly a highlight to gawk and be amazed , although it helps if more detail was paid towards avoiding camera shots that reveals the stuntmen instead of the actors (IMO takes away some of the film's magic).\n\nA true delight to view is to watch the opening scene to \"\"The Lion Men\". Aerial shots to capture the traveling Lion Dance troupe in their lorry to well angled shots to capture the stunts of the Lion dance on stilts presents a wondrous insight to present the emphasis on Lion dance culture in Singapore.\n\nRegarding the cast, apart from the main 5 boys that are at the centre of the film, they each brings forth a different flavour to the plate and present themselves as uniquely as possible. I appreciate the effort of trying to act to the best of their abilities but it could have been more animated especially trying to setup comedic moments or puns. With a new young cast of non-professional actors and actress part of the film, the fresh new faces presents the film in a new light but sadly the acting skills becomes too apparent on screen and it reeks of awkward reactions and uneasy line executions. It seems Chen Tian Wen is truly pulling off all the acting skills he has been amassing over the years. Portraying as the Lion dance troupe master, father figure and friend to his disciples, he captures all the stereotypical traits perfectly especially pulling off the expressions and line exposition for the various scenes, definitely stole the show.\n\nA true delight to view is to watch the opening scene to \"\"The Lion Men\". Aerial shots to capture the traveling Lion Dance troupe in their lorry to well angled shots to capture the stunts of the Lion dance on stilts presents a wondrous insight to present the emphasis on Lion dance culture in Singapore.\n\nIn conclusion, J team has placed the film at the perfect occasion to open the film. As the nation goes into a full blown Chinese New Year mood, \"The Lion Men\" is in for a huge crowd of film audience ready to catch movies over the long weekend. Although my suggestion is try to give a blind eye towards the over the top blatant product placements in the film which became more of an eye sore as the film progresses, go ahead and break out in laughter with some well-timed funny moments and gravity defying stunts might alleviate the pain of paying a full priced weekend movie ticket.\n\nReview by Deitrich Mohan\n\nPhoto Credits : J Team Productions\n\n↧\n\nProduction Talk with Ler Jiyuan and Lee Thean-jeen on 'Gone Case'\n\nSynopsis\n\nBased on the critically acclaimed novel by Dave Chua (winner of the Singapore Literature Prize Commendation Award), Gone Case is a heartfelt, coming-of-age story that revolves around twelve-year-old Yong, who struggles to cope with the tumultuous events that take place in his life as he approaches his PSLE exams - the death of his grandmother, the decaying relationship of his parents, the rigorous demands of school, run-ins with a neighborhood gang, his first crush and taste of heartache, and the tensions between him and his dysfunctional best friend, Liang. Like the HDB estate that the main characters reside in, Gone Case features a myriad of characters that weave in and out of Yong’s life, forming a poignant mosaic of Singapore heartlands in the 90s.\n\nDirected by Ler Jiyuan and produced and adapted for television by Lee Thean-Jeen, SINdie's Thong Kay Wee took the opportunity to chat with them about their thoughts on taking on one of Singapore's acclaimed literary novels, right before its premiere on the small screens.\n\nQ: Why take on Dave Chua's 'Gone Case'? What is it about the novel and project that attracted you?\n\nTJ:\n\nI got my start in TV/Film adapting works by local authors to the screen with AlterAsians (2000 & 2001) and The Singapore Short Story Project (2003, 2004, 2007). Quite frankly, I'm surprised it didn't occur to me to adapt Gone Case much earlier. But it was Ler who suggested the book one day over coffee. Coincidentally, I had adapted another work of Dave's - The Drowning - not for screen, but for stage, a couple of years back and in the process had the opportunity to reconnect with him. So I messaged him and told him we were interested in adapting his book. His response was, go ahead and good luck!\n\nLer:\n\nWhat immediately attracted me was the \"realness\" of Gone Case. This novel was not a caricature of what it was like growing up in the 90s. It was a very authentic portrayal of the life and times of that era. And it is a great story.\n\nI grew up in the 90s, and under very similar socio-economic circumstances as Yong, the protagonist: three-room flat, living with my grandmother, studying in a neighborhood school, the devil-discipline master, an absent father. I really connected with whatever was happening in the book, and I hope many people will too. Many of us would know how it feels to lose a grandmother, get bullied by the neighborhood Ah Beng, the pangs of first love, lose a best friend, bear witness to bickering parents.\n\nThe book has it all. Like Yong, I even climbed to the rooftop of HDB blocks with my friends, smoking and drinking E33s. When I read Gone Case I thought …this shit is so real. The only difference was, most of us possibly had these experiences over a period of time as we grew up, but Yong had to experience all this in the span of one year, and during his PSLE year!\n\nIt was a tough journey for Yong, and I really felt for him and wanted to tell his story. So when the call-for-proposals came along [the telemovie is funded under MDA's Contestable Funds Scheme], I brought the idea to TJ. We had previously worked together on several other projects (The Pupil, Code of Law, Zero Calling) and enjoyed very good chemistry. I am in awe of his screenwriting ability.\n\nQ: How did you negotiate the difficulties and go about adapting a novel to a screenplay, considering the pressures of the book's success and the challenges plaguing ink-to-screen adaptations usually?\n\nTJ:\n\nI think the main challenge of adapting Gone Case the novel into a telemovie was its episodic structure. It's a tapestry of people and events that weave in and out of the protagonist's life over the course of one year. So I had to focus on one throughline - in the end, it was Yong's relationship with Liang (his dysfunctional best friend) - and then try and weave in the other threads (the deteriorating relationship of his parents, Yong's crush on Liang's sister, the boys' interaction with Gao the neighbourhood ganglord) as organically as possible.\n\nAs for the pressures of the book's success, sometimes when you transform a work from one medium into another (and a mainstream one like television), you have to try and start with a blank slate. For every person who has read the book and will be looking out for his favourite moments in our adaptation, there will be someone coming into Gone Case with fresh eyes. It's a fine line to walk on, but it can be quite liberating as well.\n\nOne remarkable aspect of the novel is its simplicity and honesty in the way it tells the story of Yong. It's very observational, and lucidly so. That's one aspect I tried to bring across in the adaptation.\n\nQ: How big was the graphic novel adaptation (illustrated by Koh Hong Teng) an influence on this project visually, or can the audience expect a new visual perspective in your screen adaptation?\n\nLer:\n\nI believe it will be a new visual interpretation. Film also combines different disciplines and elements: spoken word, performance, cinematography, music, sound design, and so on. Each element impacts and works in tandem with the others, stewing in the same pot and resulting in the final film. The universe we are creating is very different from that of the Graphic Novel, which has its own rules of storytelling and aesthetics.\n\nI actually read Koh Hong Teng's Graphic Novel before the book. In fact the graphic novel was what made me interested to read Dave's book. It's really great stuff. Koh Hong Teng captured the soul of Dave's book in the graphic novel medium so well.\n\nHowever, I didn't actively refer to the graphic novel when I was approaching Gone Case. My inspiration for the visuals I finally developed were Dave's book and TJ's screenplay. There were some kickass frames in Koh's graphic novel, like those of the boys at the rooftop and it was raining like mad. I wish I could have replicated those, but we didn't have the time and resources to do so. Another distinct difference was how Yong wore glasses in our telemovie and not in Koh's graphic novel. It was only mentioned briefly in Dave’s novel, but since Chu Yeang wore glasses, we thought, why not stick to that.\n\nQ: Did Dave Chua, the original author, give you guys any advice or suggestions before the start of production?\n\nTJ:\n\nWe sat down once with Dave before we started the production, just to pick his brains. But he was very cognizant about how different mediums - novels, film, television, even graphic novels - have their own way of telling the same story. So he effectively gave us his blessing and a free hand. In the end, however, we ended up sticking very closely to the novel!\n\nLer:\n\nDave was pretty chill about it. He knew TJ from way back and trusted him to do a good job. Dave didn't know me then, but I guess he trusted TJ's trust in me, haha. TJ is an amazing director and writer who is in many ways also my 'shi fu' (master). So I guess Dave felt pretty safe to let us do whatever we wanted.\n\nOne thing I remember though....Dave said not to make the telemovie too happy because, well, it's not a happy story. And I was like, hell yeah. I know exactly what he's talking about.\n\nI liked him immediately.\n\nQ: With the trend of notable local films like 12 Storeys, Singapore Dreaming and most recently, Ilo Ilo, depicting a realistic portrait of Singaporean HDB heartland living, how do you think Gone Case as a project compares and what do you think it has to offer?\n\nTJ:\n\nEach of the films you mentioned depict a different aspect of Singaporean HDB living in the 90s, and each filmmaker brings their own perspective to the table, even when the subject matter might seem similar. 80% of Singaporeans live in HDBs, so naturally there are many stories to be told, and from different eras. These stories form part of the collective memory of who we are.\n\nI think Gone Case is ultimately a story about what it meant to be an average twelve-year-old kid, living in an average HDB flat in an average HDB estate in the 90s.\n\nLer:\n\nGone Case is a telemovie, while the rest were films made for the big screen. The craft involved is same same but different.\n\nFor Gone Case, we had to work within the parameters of TV. Resources were more limited than if it was a big screen production. The way it plays out on screen is different as well, because of the commercial breaks. We had to streamline the story due to time constraints. We also had to be aware of the pacing because in television, viewers can switch you off the minute they get bored. There were also several moments in the story that I felt would have been more authentic in Singlish, or even dialect, but that is not permitted on Singapore television.\n\nHowever, all things being said, I look at it this way: the parameters you work with are part and parcel of our job as storytellers. We work with the medium and the genre. Our job is to tell the story and express it in the most truthful, most awesome way possible, within the framework of the medium we inherit. And for Gone Case, our challenge was to keep the heart of the story intact, despite the challenges of the medium. I believe we have done so.\n\nWith Gone Case, we had a special story to tell, and we had our own way of telling it. We really tried hard to close the divide between film and with this one, I hope people will like what we've done.\n\nQ: How was it like working with acclaimed local musical talents like Joe Ng and Leslie Low (from The Observatory)? How did you convince them to come on board this telemovie project and what did you feel they bring to your work?\n\nLer:\n\nAWESOME. Joe is a very good, personal friend of mine. We used to play in the same band together. So, it was easy to court him to do this job. We just bought him a pint at Harry's and he was on!\n\nJoking aside, Joe is a very seasoned film composer whom I deeply respect. I learned a lot from him. We were most fortunate to have him compose the music and sound design for Gone Case. His score elevated the story to new emotional heights which I didn't even foresee. I took his lead when it came to music. His dedication was also amazing.\n\nMe and a few other buddies privately call Leslie Low \"The 神\" (The God). We've been huge fans of his since his Humpback Oak days. I also did a couple of experimental videos for his band The Observatory. Till today, we still play his songs on the guitar during house parties. \"West Coast\" is a heartfelt song that recounts Leslie's younger days, the times he spent in the West Coast, where his grandmother stayed until she passed away. The lyrics are beautifully simple and share similar themes with the story we were telling. So, it was a natural choice to marry the two.\n\nTowards the end of audio post, Joe suddenly came up with an idea to add additional string arrangements to the song. I was like ... yes! I secretly wanted to do this Miss Misery thing all along. The results were so cinematic.\n\nQ: How does this telemovie project differ from your normal television work in terms of the approach taken?\n\nTJ:\n\nThis telemovie took almost a year to produce! From the time we sat down with Dave to tell him we were doing it till just last week, when we were just putting the finishing touches on it. Granted, it was not a year's worth of continuous work, but I think the novel struck a chord with all of us working on it, and I believe we worked very hard to try and retain its essence.\n\nLer:\n\nTV or not TV, my personal approach to storytelling is always the same: it's about bringing out the heart of each story. This always helps me focus when I get lost in the whirlwind of production. So in that respect, my storytelling approach towards Gone Case didn’t differ much from other projects.\n\nThe main difference, compared to my other TV work, was the amount of attention to detail we gave this project. I believe this was a special project for many of us, including our Producer Wenn, my longtime AD Tiffany Ng, Sound Recordist Jenn Hui, Production Manager Cecilia Koh and Editor Andy Tseng. All of them were very passionate about this project and gave it an important energy.\n\nTJ and I were pretty much on the same page when we started. Dave’s story guided us on how it needed to be shot and treated. We went for naturalistic performances and a grittier style of camerawork, predominantly handheld. Glenn Chan, who also shot Code of Law, was our DOP and he added so much to it. For him, the shots had to mean something, and was always asking me what I wanted to say with each shot. This process disciplined me to shoot in a more meaningful way for Gone Case as well. I was grateful to have him on board.\n\nOur editor, Andy Tseng, also deserves a big mention for meticulously putting Gone Case together. A lot of people don't realize it, but the editor spends a lot more time with a project than most people, and is probably the only member of the team who knows every single frame of the show. Andy insisted on watching the edit again and again - I told him I was going to vomit if I saw it one more time. Like Joe, he is a meticulous man (same star sign in fact), who cuts with his 'fewling'.\n\nQ: How was the experience like working with seasoned actors Yvonne Lim, Zheng Ge Ping and Sunny Pang and then a new kid actor like Lim Chu Yeang?\n\nLer:\n\nTo be honest, I do not like directing kids. I did one kid’s drama very early in my career and I swore I wouldn’t do another one ever again! So when Gone Case came along, I was secretly terrified.\n\nI decided we had to have a number of rehearsals with the kids before we started shoot. As a result I also grew close to them. This made directing them on set a lot easier. In the end, I am satisfied with their performances. I am especially thankful for Chu Yeang, who was a really unique kid. He has a maturity way beyond his years, which made things a lot easier. He could understand the deeper and darker themes we were trying to express, although in his own special way.\n\nWith Yvonne and Ge Ping Da Ger, it was a breeze. There were no airs to them. Like all great seasoned actors, they slipped into their roles and the genre of the film effortlessly. They acted naturally, with subtlety and sophistication. I really respected them and their professionalism, as well as their ability to evolve and adapt based on each story.\n\nSunny had a small scene in this show, playing Yong’s uncle. His role was originally bigger, but as TJ wrote the script we realized this was a story thread we couldn’t indulge in. Working with Sunny was, of course, easy. We worked together in two seasons of Code of Law! This guy is one of my favorite actors to work with and a friend who looks after you.\n\nQ: What do you think of such cross platform collaborations between the local literary and cinematic / television scenes? Could that be a direction local television and films can consider taking more?\n\nTJ:\n\nThere is so much published work by local authors, I'm actually quite amazed that we don't see more of this. Perhaps it's the challenge of doing an adaptation. Or maybe filmmakers here just want to do their own thing. But it's very rewarding to find a book or short story that you can really connect with and transform it into another medium, like with Gone Case.\n\nLer:\n\nPersonally, I really dig adaptations for one reason: the characters are deeper and more multi-dimensional.\n\nA novelist, in all likelihood, does not face the same time constraints that TV, or even film, writers face. You can take years to write a novel, but for mediums like the big and small screen, you are always working to a deadline if you are a professional writer. Gone Case the novel came to us already populated with rich characters, possessing individual quirks, histories, dreams, aspirations. Bringing it to the screen was made more efficient in the process. We were in a position to enhance, breathe life into and bring meaning to what was already good. So should we do more adaptations? Hell yeah!\n\nCatch Gone Case on Feb 2 (Part One) and Feb 9 (Part Two), 10pm, on MediaCorp Channel 5.\n\nTrailer for Gone Case (Part One)\n\nBy Thong Kay Wee\n\n↧\n\nShoutOUT!: Nominees for the 5th Singapore Short Film Awards\n\nThe Annual Singapore Short Film Awards is here again.

Unassuming and with no airs, she tried to rest while waiting for her call to set. It was obvious she had been working hard so I did not approach her. Cut to 30mins later, now waiting for my call to set, I watched as the magic started - lights, camera, action - it"
