        "text": "Olivia Colman is a national treasure, a critically acclaimed actor who has portrayed everyone from Queen Elizabeth II to Les Misérables' Madame Thénardier. She's clearly got range. That said, you wouldn’t expect to hear her cursing someone, suggesting \"the cakes you make look like they’ve fallen out of some f**king sheep’s f**king a**ehole\".\n\nYet, that's exactly what audiences can expect from her latest comedy, Wicked Little Letters.\n\nBilled as \"scandalously sweary\", the profanities aren't even the wickedest thing about the upcoming film. Although it's hard to believe once you've heard the rollercoaster plot, Wicked Little Letters is based on a true story.\n\nIntrigued? We bet you are. Turns out, \"the runaway British comedy of the year\" (as Deadline has dubbed it) follows the story of a sleepy little English town and a scandal that rocked the nation.\n\nSet in 1920s Sussex, the film tells the story of two neighbours. One is a \"deeply conservative local Edith Swan\" (Olivia Colman) and the other, a \"rowdy Irish migrant Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley)\", as per the filmmakers.\n\nWhen residents, including Edith, start receiving very rude letters, Rose finds herself in trouble with the law. Once charged, a trial ensues, but not everything is as it first seems.\n\nHere's what happened IRL (consider this your spoiler alert).\n\nIs Wicked Little Letters based on a true story?\n\nTrouble started for the real-life Rose Gooding after she moved to Littlehampton in 1918. There, she formed a friendship with her neighbour, Edith Swan.\n\nThe two women soon became fast friends, exchanging recipes and knitting patterns… until they came to a head over their communal garden and Edith plotted her revenge.\n\nEdith started sending foul-mouthed postcards, getting Rose in trouble, while she remained above suspicion.\n\nLater, Edith even went on to launch a private prosecution against her former friend, who appeared before Littlehampton magistrates in September 1920, charged with criminal libel, according to the Daily Mail, which covered the case at the time.\n\nBut Rose’s persecutor was not done yet. When Rose returned home after spending three months behind bars, Edith resumed her plot, sending letters once more. Unsurprisingly, Rose ended up back in court.\n\nShe was jailed for 12 months with hard labour, despite the efforts of her barrister, who drew a comparison between the handwriting used in the letters and Edith’s penmanship, visible on the aforementioned recipes and knitting instructions, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nHow was Edith Swan caught?\n\nThe truth did eventually prevail – but only after Rose had endured much hardship.\n\nWhile Ruth was locked away the second time, Edith decided to write even more rude notes, which she reportedly sent to the police, claiming a notebook had been found on a street. Historians have since suggested Edith may have been struggling with mental health issues.\n\nFortunately, police soon noticed similarities between the notebook and the accompanying letter from Edith, and Rose was released three months into her sentence.\n\nEdith, who’d also been spotted leaving one of the foul notes, was trialled in 1921, but she avoided prison, as the judge said he \"would not convict\" and the jury followed suit.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1923 that police came close to uncovering the truth. Detectives marked a set of postage stamps with invisible ink, before instructing the post office to sell the set to Edith. The next summer, Edith's masterplan was uncovered after she struck once more, and she was sentenced to 12 months in prison, making a shocking end to a shocking tale.\n\nHow the movie will play out the scandal remains to be seen, but we can expect lots of fun, frivolity, and F words along the way."
