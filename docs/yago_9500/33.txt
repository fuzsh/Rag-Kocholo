e’TZAINTES! – the made-in-Singapore underground film is dedicated to the misfits and dreamers of the world. The film was shot in three weeks with 18 hours of footage; 30 in the cast and only three in the crew. Using almost zero budget, and with an experimental attitude, Tzang creates a spirited underdog story like nothing you’ve ever seen before.
