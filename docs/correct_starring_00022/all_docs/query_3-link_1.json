        "text": "Lucas Stephen Grabeel (born November 23, 1984) is an American actor, singer, dancer, songwriter, director and producer. He is perhaps best known for his role as Ryan Evans in Disney Channel Original Movie's 2006 High School Musical and its sequels, High School Musical 2 (2007) and High School Musical 3: Senior Year (2008), and as Ethan Dalloway in the third and fourth installments of the Halloweentown series, Halloweentown High (2004), and Return to Halloweentown (2006).\n\nEarly life and work[]\n\nGrabeel was born in Springfield, Missouri on November 23, 1984, the son of Jean (née Harman) and Stephen Grabeel.[1] He attended Logan-Rogersville elementary, middle and high school before transferring to and graduating from Kickapoo High School in Springfield in 2003. He also played drums for a local church and initiated a mens a cappella singing group at Kickapoo High school. He can also play the guitar and accordion; and can dance in the styles of jazz, ballet, hip-hop and tap.[2] While in Rogersville, Missouri, he regularly attended Harmony Baptist Church, where he was a part of the children’s and youth groups.[3] During the summer of 2002, He attended the Missouri Fine Arts Academy at Missouri State University. In a letter written to protest eliminating MFAA, Grabeel stated, \"I wouldn't be where I am at if it weren't for my time at MFAA.\"\n\nFollowing graduation, he moved to Los Angeles to become an actor. Two months after moving from home to L.A., Grabeel landed his first TV role in a commercial for toothpaste, and then eventually went to star in other commercials for Lego and Hot Wheels, and soon after, he landed his first film role in the third installment of the Halloweentown series; the Disney Channel Original Movie: Halloweentown High as the character Ethan Dalloway (he reprised his role in the fourth installment, Return to Halloweentown).\n\n2006–2008: High School Musical[]\n\nHis biggest, and his best known, role was playing the part of Ryan Evans, the fraternal twin brother of Sharpay Evans (played by Ashley Tisdale), in the Emmy Award-winning made-for-television Disney movie High School Musical. He reprises his role in the sequels High School Musical 2 and the motion picture High School Musical 3: Senior Year. In 2007, he joined co-stars Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Corbin Bleu and Monique Coleman on the 51 date High School Musical: The Concert. In early 2009, Billboard believed that Grabeel and Tisdale’s track I Want It All should be nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category however, the song did not make the final shortlist.[4] During his time in High School Musical, Grabeel (along with his co-stars) had a total of six tracks chart in the Billboard Hot 100.[5][6][7][8] Furthermore, he and Tisdale are the first artists to debut in the Billboard Hot 100 with two simultaneous new entries in one week.[9]\n\nMusical projects[]\n\nApart from his involvement in the High School Musical soundtracks, Grabeel also recorded a track called You Know I Will for the Fox and the Hound 2 soundtrack. He also recorded his own version of the Michael Bolton track Go the Distance, from Disney's Hercules, for DisneyMania 5. In 2007 Grabeel co-wrote and recorded a song called You Got It.[10] The song was released on iTunes on August 19, 2007[11] and a music video was released on his official website. Grabeel also recorded the song Trash Talkin' (another original song) which was released November 15, 2008 on YouTube.[12] Grabeel also sings in the iTunes show I Kissed A Vampire in which he stars.\n\nOther appearances[]\n\nGrabeel has made Television guest appearances on TV series such as Boston Legal, 'Til Death, Veronica Mars and Smallville, where he portrayed a young Lex Luthor. In 2006, he was offered a guest role on an episode of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody but when the script called for him to kiss co-star Ashley Tisdale, the role went to High School Musical co-star, Zac Efron, due to Grabeel and Tisdale’s brother-sister dynamic established in High School Musical. In 2007, he filmed the movie, The Adventures of Food Boy with Brittany Curran, as the lead Ezra. Other film projects Grabeel was involved with includes the animated film, At Jesus' Side, where he voiced a dog called Jericho.[13] He also filmed the independent film, Alice Upside Down,[14] as the character of Lester McKinley, based on the \"Alice book series\" by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. In 2008, he also appeared in the movie Milk, a biopic about the slain gay rights activist Harvey Milk. Grabeel played a friend and supporter of Milk, photographer Danny Nicoletta. He also appeared in the 2008 Walt Disney Pictures film College Road Trip as Scooter, which features other Disney stars Raven-Symoné, Brenda Song and Margo Harshman. He also stars in the independent movie Lock and Roll Forever alongside Ore Ska Band.[15]\n\nHe also participated in the first ever Disney Channel Games and co-captained the green team along with Ashley Tisdale, Mitchel Musso, Miley Cyrus, Emily Osment and Kyle Massey. In June 2007, he returned to repeat his captaincy of the green team with Dylan Sprouse, Miley Cyrus, Monique Coleman and Brandon Baker.\n\nIn early 2009, he appeared at the Southland Theatre Artists Goodwill Event (S.T.A.G.E.), an AIDS charity event, in Beverly Hills performing George and Ira Gershwin’s I Can't Be Bothered Now.[16][17] Grabeel also guest starred in an episode of The Cleveland Show.\n\nOther projects: 14341 Productions[]\n\nIn 2007 Grabeel founded a production company called 14341 Productions. His role within involves overseeing many projects from writing, directing and executive producing.
