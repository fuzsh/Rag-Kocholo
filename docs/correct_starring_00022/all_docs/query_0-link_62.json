        "text": "In 2006, Disney was churning out more popular tween series than your average AIM-addicted 14-year-old could keep up with. The success of Thatâ€™s So Raven and Hannah Montana, which inadvertently gifted us with some of the most controversial former Disney stars, opened up the doors for what would be one of the network's most successful films of all time. High School Musical premiered on January 20, 2006, and broke records. It remains the only Disney Channel Original Movie to have a theatrical release. So, where is the cast of High School Musical now?\n\nHigh School Musical defined a generation, from the best-selling album filled with teen anthems to some of the worst (and most copied) fashion of the early '00s. Sharpay may be the only person on the planet who can pull off metallic fabrics, feathers, and statement hats all in the same outfit. High School Musical also made way for the Disney nude picture scandal of the decade and Zac Efron's 12-pack abs."
