        "text": "Have you ever wondered about the net worths of the main cast of High School Musical? After all, it is one of the 00s most important pop culture entities and something with all that magnitude leaves one wondering about their current net worth since its debut on the Disney Channel.\n\nWith 18 years passing since the first movie, there has been a lot of time for the alum of East High’s bank balances to have grown. There have been ample opportunities as it developed into a trilogy. The final instalment of High School Musical 3: Senior Year was released in cinemas and raked in more than $252 million at the box office globally, according to official figures.\n\nHere are the eye-watering net worths of the main cast of High School Musical, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\n6. Lucas Grabeel – $800,000\n\nLucas brought to life the theatre kid Ryan Evans, living in his sister Sharpay’s iconic shadow and gone to grow his nest egg to a respectable amount. Thinking about him again does leave one wondering just where he has gone. Recent cameos include the very meta High School Musical: The Musical: The Series and various bits on Netflix and Disney Junior. His main showbiz focus seems to be his music career, and he recently performed in Brazil.\n\n5. Monique Coleman – $2 million\n\nMonique played Taylor McKessie, the beautiful and bossy BNOC of the scholastic decathlon team. Her character went on to get into her dream school while Monique continued her acting career. Prior to High School Musical, she appeared on TV shows such as Gilmore Girls, Malcolm in the Middle and Boston Public. Since the movies wrapped, she has been on Dancing With The Stars, starred in the Netflix movie A Christmas Dance Reunion and even did a guest spot on High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.\n\n4. Corbin Bleu – $4 million\n\nCorbin went on to star in another Disney Channel Original movie, Jump In, which obviously didn’t have the cultural impact of the trilogy where he played musical theatre cynic Chad Danforth. He began his career as a child star in New York, acting in commercials and on Broadway. Since High School Musical, he has explored a music career along with roles across TV, theatre and film. In 2013, he was the runner-up on that year’s Dancing With The Stars.\n\n3. Ashley Tisdale – $14 million\n\nAshley, who began her Disney days as Maddie Fitzpatrick on the Suite Life of Zack and Cody, managed to parlay playing the diva Sharpay Evans into many avenues. This included pop princess with her albums Headstrong and Guilty Pleasure. After lending her voice to the Disney Channel animated series Phineas and Ferb and reprising Sharpay in the 2011 spinoff Sharpay’s Fabulous Adventure, Ashlet pivoted towards becoming a lifestyle guru with her brand Frensche. Ashley also became a mother when she welcomed her daughter Juniper in 2021.\n\n2. Vanessa Hudgens – $18 million\n\nVanessa got her breakout role as bookish math whizz Gabriella Montez. After the trio of musical movies, she established herself as a mainstay of late 00s Hollywood with a singing and acting career. After starring in a number of films like Bandslam, Beastly and Sucker Punch, Vanessa has become one of Netflix’s favourite talents to return to again and again following the success of The Princess Switch trilogy. She’s also returned to musicals again with Tick Tick… Boom and NBC’s Grease Live in 2016.\n\n1. Zac Efron – $25 million\n\nZac went from playing the poster boy of range Troy Bolton (a teenage boy who could win the basketball championship and lead the school musical) to being one of Hollywood’s most desirable leading men. They didn’t even use his real singing voice in the first one! He redeemed himself in the following two and the Hairspray movie musical. His other credits, which are almost too many to name, include 17 Again, The Greatest Showman and the upcoming wrestling movie The Iron Claw.\n\nRelated stories recommended by this writer:\n\n∙ Jen Shah to Teresa Giudice: Here are all the biggest Real Housewives legal dramas\n\n∙ Taylor, Miley, Lana and Leo: Celebrities who love a cheeky vape and their favourite flavour\n\n∙ This is what the cast of High School Musical is up to now\n\nPhoto credit via Ashley Tisdale/The Iron Claw/Vanessa Hudgens"
