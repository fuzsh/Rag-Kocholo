The musical film ranked as the most-watched Friday night telecast on any network in more than five years. The original High School Musical TV movie drew 7.7 million viewers in January 2006.\n\nHigh School Musical 2 reunited original cast members Zac Efron who plays Link Larkin in the big-screen version of Hairspray and Vanessa Hudgens as sweethearts Troy and Gabriella, Ashley Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel as crafty siblings Sharpay and Ryan, and Corbin Bleu and Monique Coleman as best pals Chad and Taylor. Set during summer vacation at a ritzy country owned by Sharpay and Ryan's parents, the film features high-energy musical numbers set on a golf course and baseball diamond, among others. High School Musical 2 was directed and choreographed by Kenny Ortega."
