        "text": "It has been 14 years since Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens and the rest of the musical lineup burst onto screens as the cast of Disney Channel's High School Musical.\n\nThe iconic movie, that centred upon the story of a high school jock falling for the smart, quiet girl, was an instant hit and saw the creation of some truly catchy tunes.\n\nThe show was so popular that two sequels swiftly followed and the dance moves of Troy and Gabriela were copied by excited viewers around the world.\n\nThe legacy of the movie franchise has also lived on in a new TV series, of which The Holiday Special dropped on Disney+ today.\n\nFollowing the movies, the cast were then seen to be breaking free into several iconic Hollywood roles and other TV shows.\n\nBut almost a decade and a half later, where are our favourite High School Musical stars now?\n\nZac Efron\n\nZac was a relatively unknown actor before he was propelled to global fame when he played Troy Bolton in the High School Musical movies.\n\nThe star played several teen heartthrob characters at the time in 17 Again and showed off his vocal skills in Hairspray.\n\nMore recently, he has landed roles in The Greatest Showman and The Disaster Artist and has continued with steady work in the movie industry.\n\nThe actor also switched up more light hearted roles and even played serial killer Ted Bundy in the 2019 crime drama Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile.\n\nWhile Zac dated co-star Vanessa after the movies, the couple eventually parted ways.\n\nIt also hasn't been smooth sailing for Zac since his role and alongside his ascent to stardom, Zac's lifestyle also spiralled into drug use.\n\nReflecting on his party lifestyle he once told The Hollywood Reporter: \"I was drinking a lot, way too much.\n\n\"It's never one specific thing. I mean, you're in your 20s, single, going through life in Hollywood, you know? Everything is thrown at you.\"\n\nIn 2013, Zac found himself in a rehab facility for a cocaine addition.\n\nFollowing his rehab stint, Zac has been very open about his recovery.\n\nHe went on to sign up to Alcoholics Anonymous and also enlisted the help of a therapist, which \"changed [his] life.\"\n\nAs well as being sober since his trip to rehab, the actor is now an avid traveller and often shares videos of his trips and fitness tips to his 1.2 million subscribers.\n\nZac is currently in Australia and has recently been linked to model Vanessa Valladares.\n\nVanessa Hudgens\n\nVanessa's character Gabriella Montez stole the show with her epic duets alongside Troy Bolton.\n\nAfter appearing in the three movies, Vanessa actually went onto release to music albums and also pursued several acting gigs.\n\nHudgens has starred in some hard hitting roles such as Spring Breakers and also had reoccurring roles in TV shows such as Powerless.\n\nOff screen, Vanessa has also appeared on Broadway in shows such as Grease Live! and was even a judge on So You Think You Can Dance.\n\nIn 2007, Vanessa was also rocked by a nude photograph leak after her phone was hacked.\n\nSpeaking to Cosmopolitan about the scandal at the start of this year, the actress admitted that it had been very traumatising for her.\n\n“It’s really f***ed up that people feel like they are entitled enough to share something that personal with the world,” she said.\n\nThe actress has also been in hot water this year after she was forced to apologise after making some brazen and \"insensitive\" remarks about the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn a bizarre video recorded in March, Vanessa told fans: \"Even if everybody gets it, like yeah, people are going to die, which is terrible... but inevitable?\"\n\nFans were far from happy about the message, and the actress has since apologised and admitted it had been a \"huge wake up call\" about the significance of her words.\n\nVanessa has been most recently linked to rumoured boyfriend and baseball star Cole Tucker.\n\nAshley Tisdale\n\nOne half of the pesky yet endearing sibling performers, Ashley played the sassy character Sharpay Evans in the HSM trilogy.\n\nHowever, she was already well known in the Disney world for her role in The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.\n\nThanks to her High School Musical success, Tisdale was quickly signed and released a studio album called Headstrong in 2007.\n\nShe also landed herself a spin-off movie called Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure and has also starred in several other movies since such as Scary Movie 5.\n\nIn the last few years, Ashley has also stepped into the fashion world and released a clothing line with the brand Signorelli.\n\nAshley has also been very open about going under the knife at the age of 22 and tweaking her nose as well as having breast implants.\n\nHowever over the summer, Ashley explained that she had her breat implants removed in an attempt to better her health.\n\nIn September 2020, Ashley revealed that she was expecting her first child with husband Christopher French.\n\nCorbin Bleu\n\nSporting star and Troy's best friend Chad Danforth was played by hunk Corbin Bleu.\n\nThe actor went on to star in several movies, TV shows and ,and several guest appearances before stepping into Broadway on productions like Godspell.\n\nCorbin was also runner up on Season 17 of ABC's Dancing With the Stars.\n\nAs for his singing talents, he also released two albums.\n\nAnd as for his personal life away from the screen, the actor also married Sasha Clements in 2016.\n\nLucas Grabeel\n\nSharpay's excitable brother Ryan Evans was played by the actor Lucas Grabeel - who is now 36.\n\nLucas also landed several other acting gigs after his High School Musical success and even played the young Lex Luthor in Smallville.\n\nThe actor also ended up landing voice over work and even reappeared in the High School Musical series where he played himself.\n\nIn recent years, Grabeel was also part of a folk-rock band called Midnight Holler."
