        "text": "Though the original High School Musical trilogy remains an iconic time capsule filled with nostalgia, it would make sense that those involved in bringing East High to life might want to update it accordingly for the modern era. Among those changes? Lucas Grabeel, who played Ryan Evans in the movies, might opt out of playing that character if he could do it all over again.\n\nIn a recent interview with TMZ, Lucas reflected on the way he and director Kenny Ortega navigated Ryan’s identity when the first movie debuted in 2006: According to Kenny, Ryan would probably come out — or as the director put it, let “his true colors come forward” — in college. And while Lucas loved playing Ryan, he also knows that the opportunity to provide such representation could and probably should go to a gay actor. As he put it, “as a straight white man, I know that even without trying, I have taken opportunities away from other people.”\n\n“There’s so many amazingly talented gay actors that could do it as well, so if High School Musical was made today – I don’t know if I would play Ryan,” he added. “I would love to, but the last thing I want to do is take an opportunity away from other people.”\n\nThe fight to create multifaceted representations for LGBTQ+ characters in movies and on TV has been an uphill battle, and there’s still a long road ahead for true equity. A study of the top 100 movies released in 2017 found that 81 of those films did not feature an LGBTQ+ main character, and of those that did, 67.7% of those roles were played by white actors. (The study did not examine whether actors’ sexual or gender identity matched that of the LGBTQ+ character they played.) In 2018, Darren Criss said he “[wants] to make sure I won't be another straight boy taking a gay man’s role,” and now it seems Lucas is joining the effort to pass the baton to the talented LGBTQ+ actors waiting for their star-making turn.\n\nMoreover, Lucas sees a lot of power in creating characters like Ryan in Disney programs — and including storylines in which they are fully their authentic selves. “We need to start educating everyone at the youngest age possible,” he told TMZ. “And that’s why it will fall into the hands of Disney who create so much great programming for the developing minds of our future country. We in the film industry have a duty to educate as well as entertain.”\n\nIn 2017, Disney Channel’s original show Andi Mack featured a storyline in which one of the characters, Cyrus, came out to his friends — marking the first time the channel had featured an openly gay character.\n\nLet us slide into your DMs. Sign up for the Teen Vogue daily email."
