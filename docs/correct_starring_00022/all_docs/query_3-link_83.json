        "text": "Two days after Ashley Tisdale and Vanessa Hudgens had a mini High School Musical reunion at the Billboard Music Awards, the 31-year-old decided to keep the HSM feels alive by hanging out with her on-screen twin Lucas Grabeel. And to really make the HSM fans go crazy, the two teamed up for a new rendition of their song “What I’ve Been Looking For.”\n\nBefore Tisdale and Grabeel began their piano-based version of the tune, they reminisced on their days of being castmates — which apparently weren’t initially as fun as it may have seemed for the pair.\n\n“We hated each other, not kidding,” Tisdale laughs. Grabeel further suggested that Tisdale really wasn’t joking: “We didn’t get off on the best foot.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nBut as insinuated by their interactions during their reunion, their relationship grew over time the way that a real-life brother and sister relationship does. “I think we just didn’t know each other. I was definitely a lot like Sharpay, and Lucas was like ‘Who is this person?'” Tisdale explained. “I have to say, after we wrapped, though, I’ve always had a love for you. You’re literally like my twin brother.”\n\nWatch Grabeel and Tisdale’s performance of “What I’ve Been Looking For” — their first time in 10 years — below."
