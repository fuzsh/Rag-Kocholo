        "text": "An old email in my outbox from September 2005 to my family reads: “These are pictures of the two boys from the Disney Channel movie High School Musical (directed by the director of Newsies!) trying to teach me to dance. I don't think they were very successful!!!”\n\nYes, those two “boys” were Zac Efron and Corbin Bleu and, at the time, it was clearly my obsession with the 1992 movie musical Newsies directed by Kenny Ortega that sparked my interest in a set visit to a tiny television movie filming in Salt Lake City while I was a reporter for the teen entertainment magazine (or “fanzine” as I’d be ashamed to call it back in the day) Popstar!\n\nThere hadn’t been much interest in the project and I was the only press member on the set. And it felt like a production of a, well, high school musical.\n\nBut with its stupendous overnight success after its debut on January 20, 2006, with 7.7 million viewers, the standalone TV movie turned into a bonafide Disney franchise and went on to become a trilogy — with the final chapter turning into a theatrical release.\n\nAnd tonight, the first episode of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series debuts on ABC, Disney Channel and Freeform simultaneously, ahead of its Disney+ release on November 12 as a 10-episode scripted series about the real high school where it was filmed putting on their first production of High School Musical (yes, so meta).\n\nAnd as the sole journalist on all three sets (by the second two films, I was the CosmoGIRL! entertainment editor), I had a front-row seat to the evolution of what has become one of the most beloved Disney series.\n\nThe Start of Something New: On the High School Musical 1 set in Salt Lake City\n\nBetween the heavy sounds of the basketballs and the stuffy air that penetrates any high school sporting venue, the gym at Salt Lake City’s East High — which kept the same name in the film (I figured to cut back on set dressing costs) — wasn’t exactly the most pleasant room to be in. But this cast of unknowns had been meticulously preparing for a number that mixed basketball and dance, so I watched. Over and over and over again.\n\nAnd boy was it done meticulously. While the first few takes were impressive, the young cast was eager to impress the veteran director and get everything right. In fact, it took so many takes that I ended up sitting outside in the misty weather thumbing through a newspaper while one of the most iconic scenes in pop culture history was being filmed on the other side of the wall.\n\nBut that’s exactly how nondescript the production was. It had definitely taken over the school, but it wasn’t a huge deal. And the cast was still eager to talk to a reporter of a teen magazine. I had breakfast with Vanessa Hudgens and Monique Coleman in our hotel, the Kimpton Hotel Monaco Salt Lake City. Efron and Bleu demonstrated the Wildcats dance and took me through each move, step by step. I interviewed Ashley Tisdale and had more time than I even needed with any one I wanted to talk to. I even got to know their parents — after all, they were just teens.\n\nIn between takes, Efron — who I had already known from interviewing him during his time on The WB’s Summerland — hung out and chatted. This was a big breakthrough role for the then-gapped tooth teen. He was fresh-faced and anxious to learn about the world of teen entertainment.\n\nBy the following January, after the premiere, Efron and his five cohorts definitely didn’t need my primer in teen fame — they were getting their own crash course.\n\nBut Disney Channel remained loyal. After two months of being recognizable faces — and now staying at hotels like the JW Marriott Essex House on Central Park South in New York City — I still was able to get all six of them to come over and have a Central Park picnic for a Popstar! story. We climbed up a secluded knoll and ate. A few of them climbed rocks.\n\nAnd in a pre-cell phone age, I switched my digital camera from photo to video and Efron and Bleu came up with an impromptu rap, sparking the first teen magazine “shout-out video,” which all of five of the competing teen magazines soon also soon started doing.\n\nThat summer, I went down to Walt Disney World for the opening of Expedition Everest and chatted with the whole cast again. By now they had to be fenced off in a tent so that autograph seekers (yes, we were still in an autograph age!) wouldn’t interrupt us. (Sidenote: the Jonas Brothers were also on the same trip and when I ran into Joe Jonas at my hotel, he took a candy notepad and wrote “Rachel is the best” and told me to eat it.)\n\nAt another time, Efron came up to me and said he and his mom had just been talking and realized I was the first person to ever interview him (we had done a phone interview even before my set visit to Summerland). I didn’t have the heart to tell him that he wasn’t my first interviewee.\n\nBetting On It: Poolside with High School Musical 2 in St. George\n\nThings were different by the time the second Disney Channel Original Movie was being filmed. I didn’t find out until 7 p.m. on a Friday that I’d be flying from New York City to the Utah set on Sunday. The cast had graduated and was now living in their own casitas at the Inn at Entrada in Ivans, Utah (Coleman gave me a tour of hers) — and I had also graduated from “teen entertainment magazine” to “teen lifestyle magazine,” now working as the CosmoGIRL! entertainment editor.\n\nLogistics were far more involved for both sides, but we had a very specific plan — since CosmoGIRL! was going to break tradition and try doing a flip cover with Efron, as well as a special High School Musical 2 mini magazine.\n\nUnlike the first film, I definitely couldn’t go wandering around like before. Where I sat during the takes was even calculated. But the upside of that was that Ortega wanted me to see what it was like from his lens and had me sit in his assistant’s chair and observe him in action as they filmed some pool scenes (and I finally got to spill what a Newsies fan I was — receiving a hug in response).\n\nWe had been told that Sharpay’s dog Boi was a big part of the plot and thought it would be a fun twist to “interview” the dog, played by Ortega’s real dog, Manly. Everything was set up and Ortega’s assistant was going to be Manly’s translator. Just as we found a corner of the resort to quietly do our interview, we were told to stop. Ortega himself wanted to be Manly’s translator. So I got a second interview with the famous movie musical director, this time from the mind of his beloved Yorkshire Terrier.\n\nThe set was more restricted overall — Efron and Hudgens were dating at the time and Hudgens had a pin of Efron’s HSM character Troy Bolton her personal handbag. At one point, huge boards were lifted up so no one could see a scene being filmed. Turned out, they did one shot of a sequence with Efron shirtless, just to have in case. No wonder I’d seen him doing push-ups just before that.\n\nBut I tried to gather every detail I could, even asking what they ate on set. Apparently this question was amusing enough coming from a teen magazine for the Salt Lake Tribune writer to include in his write-up (Answer: it was wiener schnitzel).\n\nThe second film ended up breaking records for the Disney Channel, breaking cable ratings records with 17.24 million viewers when it aired in August 17, 2007. Right then and there, I knew if there was a third set visit, I’d probably be on a leash.\n\nWe’re All in This Together: Arms Distance to High School Musical 3\n\nWhen the third film went from Disney Channel Original Movie to Walt Disney Pictures behemoth, I knew it would be a challenge to get any access. But I had my history with both the studio and the franchise — and CosmoGIRL! wanted to do a cover story on Hudgens, so it made sense to send me.\n\nSo I flew out out the set in Salt Lake City — kind of. I wasn’t actually allowed to go to the “set” itself, but Hudgens came to us for our cover shoot in April 2008. And since I was in town, I was put in a booth at a dining area at the Little America Hotel Salt Lake City, while available cast members were brought over to me, including Bleu, Kaycee Stroh, Chris Warren Jr., Ryne Sanborn, Oleysa Rulin, Matt Prokop and Justin Martin. The marquee names were unavailable.\n\nBut while I was at our cover shoot, Hudgens got a phone call — and a few minutes later, Efron showed up unofficially. I knew better than to press for an interview, so we just chatted.\n\nShortly there after, I got an email from his publicist: “When I told Zac you were in SLC to interview Vanessa he said, ‘I know Rachel well, I have to go say hello.’ I am glad you go to see him.”\n\nSo while the quaint little production blossomed into a blockbuster movie grossing $252 million globally and the access to the cast and changed from in-person hangouts to messages through publicists, what always remained has been the loyalty and authenticity of what made the movie musical so endearing from the beginning."
