        "text": "With the overwhelming success of the original High School Musical, it was only a matter of time before Disney delivered what the millions of fans were begging for - the highly anticipated sequel, High School Musical 2 which debuts on the Disney Channel on Friday, August 17th. BroadwayWorld sat down with Lucas Grabeel who is better known to the HSM fans as drama club die-hard, Ryan Evans. Here's what he had to say about making the original, the sequel, going on tour, and more!\n\nHaving previously done a made-for-Disney Channel movie (\"Halloween Town High\") - did you have any notion going into the original High School Musical how BIG it was going to be?\n\nNo, I was actually still working at Blockbuster after I finished filming \"Halloween Town High\" (and had been recognized there for that movie) and you know, because I didn't have enough jobs to keep me afloat before \"High School Musical,\" I still had to have my regular job. So I figured I would do that after \"High School Musical.\" I was set up at Blockbuster, but I was still thinking I would have to get a job somewhere else…but, I didn't.\n\nWhy do you think HSM is resonating so much with its audience?\n\nYou know, that's a hard question and a lot of people ask me that. It's just one of those pop culture things. Now this is all my opinion but I think it's just one of those pop culture iconic phenomenons that come about every now and then – like \"Full House,\" \"Saved by the Bell,\" and \"Friends.\" It's something that kind of clicks and, like you said, resonates with the audience. But you know, there's a lot of things that go into it, there's a lot of people who put their hand into the process of creating it, so no one's really able to take credit for it solely…it's kind of a conglomerated effort.\n\nHSM has clearly exploded onto the scene - how has it changed and affected your life and career?\n\nPersonally, it hasn't changed a whole lot of things. Obviously, monetarily I don't have to work another job now, and it kinds of bleeds into my career life because I have been able to get a lot of work from \"High School Musical.\" I get an audition because I've been in a movie or something like that. It's gotten my face out there, I suppose. Ryan is a lot different than who I am. The person that I kind of have to be with Disney is all me - but you know - when you're standing in front of 15,000 people that are all 9-12 year olds - you're kind of walking on eggshells. You don't want to offend anybody. I kind of have to…not censor myself, I'm not a horrible person or anything…I'm just kind of an introverted person who stays away from everything…so I don't do a lot of the publicity, etc. I don't really go to too many premieres, parties, events or anything. I just kind of keep low-key. Occasionally, I'll get recognized by a kid, which is great, because they're smiling and so happy to see you. I have no idea why. I've never understood getting pictures or getting autographs from people, but you know…if I can make a kid happy, I'm not going to turn that down!\n\nYou went on tour all around the US and world - what was that experience like?\n\nI had done a lot of growing up, so I felt that I was prepared. Doing the live show is different from working on the film set in the sense that you have a lot more responsibility – you take care of your own things, you make sure that your costumes and your props are in the right place, you know your whole show, and you know what you're supposed to do. Especially with me - I was the emcee of the show and I introduced all the acts. I was onstage a lot, changing clothes a lot, and always had to be on top of my game…which is exciting! There's a sense of adrenaline that feeds you when you've got a lot to do in a very short time; when you go out and are facing 15,000 screaming fans, it kind of boosts your adrenaline even more. It's really an indescribable experience as far as the energy you feel when you're onstage. Especially when we went to South America and got to perform in stadiums with crowds up to 65,000. I've never even been to a concert that's had 40,000 people, I think. So the first time going to a concert that big and being on the stage as the only person with a microphone - and talking to people in Portugese - I never thought that would happen. That's a pretty cool experience to mark on the \"10 Things to Do Before I Die\" list!\n\nHow did you keep your endurance up for the entire tour?\n\nIt's tough, but you just eat well and try to sleep as much as you can…which is tough. I got sick at the end. I didn't get sick on the American tour. But flying to all these different countries, constantly on the move and being in tight and close spaces with all these other people..you get sick...it happens.\n\nWhat was your audition process like for the original \"HSM?\"\n\nJust a normal movie audition except for the final callback. That was kind of like a what you might see when auditioning for Broadway or Off-Broadway or something like that. It was seven hours long, and there was a giant group of people that were called there to prepare a song or scene. We also danced. We would go in as pairs to audition, and they'd switch us around. We also did a mix-and-match, which is common for movies, but with the music and the dance aspects, they kind of changed up things a bit. It was fun to do a different audition for once because a lot of them get very similar for a while. It was cool. They finally told some people to leave and it dwindled down to the last few, and then, they sent us all home and I think a month later they called me.\n\nWere you always auditioning for the role of Ryan?\n\nNo, I originally went in for Troy. I got called back for Troy and when I met Kenny Ortega at callbacks, he said I'd be a perfect Ryan. And so I was like, \"Okay, I'll try.\" I went outside, learned the sides for Ryan, came back and I did it. I got called back for that again, and the next time was the BIG callback.\n\nDid you base your portrayal of Ryan on anyone in particular?\n\nYeah, I actually talked about this with a couple of my buddies from high school. There's a lot of people that fed into him, but really, my high school experience was High School Musical in a nutshell. I think Ryan represents my high school very well. I went to a pretty normal school, and maybe not being the best thing – you know, it's not really bad but not really good either – we were like really good in all of the sports; we had the jocks and the geeks and the skater dudes. It was just like the stereotypical high school. So we were very proud – overly proud – and boastful most times. We thought there was only way to believe. I grew up in the Bible Belt, so to some degree, it was very close-minded in a way.\n\nHow soon were you and your castmates approached about doing the sequel?\n\nThey were talking about it on the set of \"High School Musical\" but I didn't believe them. And then we finished the movie in July...in November, I think, they called us about the sequel. But we didn't make a deal until after the movie came out so that was January. So tell us about Ryan and his role in the plot of HSM2...\n\nWell, the movie starts right where the last one left off. Basically, it's the end of the year, after the winter musical and spring musical. They go to Ryan and Sharpé's country club for the summer and all the Wildcats are there. Basically, Ryan has kind of an epiphany, if you will; he kind of sees the error of his sister's ways and moves away from being in her shadow all the time. At the same time, he sees the goodness of, and opens his mind to new people – like the Wildcats or all the kids in school. Ryan's a little step behind always. In the second movie, he really holds true to the values of the first film in the sense of not really worrying about who you're hanging out with, in light of what they do or what they're all about. You can hang out with all walks of life, you can do whatever you want to do and you don't have to be held down. Just express yourself. So I think that's kind of how he breaks out of his shell a little bit. So yeah…it's kind of exciting! I like that he has an arc.\n\nCan you share any humorous on-set stories that took place during the filming of HSM2 - or something audiences should make sure to watch for?\n\nYou know, I don't know. I haven't seen the movie yet, so I don't even know what it looks like. I can't remember anything funny happening on the set. We were under a time crunch every day and had a very short schedule to shoot a lot of movie. We shot a lot that I'm sure is not even going to make it to the final cut because, well we just shot so much. So, a lot of the time we were very serious about getting stuff done. Yeah, we were having fun, but it was pretty hardcore. With the choreography, getting everything right... I'm usually pretty quiet and serious on-set. I'm a goofball off-time.\n\nWhat's next for you - are there talks of a HSM3? Do you have your sights set on Broadway?\n\nEventually, I'd like to do everything! Right now, I'm really trying to focus on my original goal. When I moved out to LA, I wanted to be an actor and really not have another job. I was lucky enough to get that soon after I moved out here. So now I really want to start a production company. I want to start making films on my own and to start producing. I'd like to find a group of people that I really enjoy working with on projects that we all really believe in without really worrying about if they're blockbuster masterpieces or phenomenons or if they break any records or anything. If we make a cool, fun, crazy or weird movie that at least one person likes, then I'll be okay with that.
