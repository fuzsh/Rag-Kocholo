        "text": "Now THIS is what we've been looking for!\n\nNo matter your age, you will at some point or another have come across High School Musical. Whether you were obsessed when it came out in 2006, or your kids watched it - or you're being forced to discover it for the first time right now in self-isolation through Disney+ - no-one can deny the phenomenal popularity of the franchise.\n\nSo the news that the original cast are all going to reunite for the 'Disney Family Singalong' this week is HUGE.\n\nThe original film's director Kenny Ortega told Deadline that former CEO of Disney Bob Iger asked him to get involved in the special, which is due to air in the USA tomorrow (Thurs 16th) and will star some of the biggest Disney stars of all time performing our favourite tunes from the comfort of their homes.\n\nKenny was immediately interested, and got most of his old HSM cast to join in as well - with Vanessa Hudgens (Gabriella), Corbin Bleu (Chad), Monique Coleman (Taylor), Lucas Grabeel (Ryan) and Ashley Tisdale (Sharpay) all agreeing to take part.\n\nAlthough Zac Efron (Troy) - who didn't sing in the first film - wasn't as quick to agree, he has now apparently sent a message along for the singalong.\n\nKenny admitted that it was Ashley who had sparked the idea for the High School Musical reunion, after sharing a TikTok video of herself performing the dance routine to 'We're All In This Together'.\n\nHe said, \"I think Ashley started this whole movement with her home video. I canâ€™t imagine that Matthew Gerrard and Robbie Nevil, who wrote this song, had any idea that it would have the legs and perhaps mean more now than when we first did it.\"\n\nHe added, \"I feel really good that we have an opportunity to do something like this â€” itâ€™s good medicine.\"\n\nVanessa even shared a photo on Instagram at the weekend of herself on a video call along with Kenny, Ashley, Corbin, Lucas and Monique along with the caption, 'Guess whoâ€™s back...'\n\nThe Disney Family Singalong will air on Thursday 15th April at 5pm (PT) on ABC, and will be hosted by Ryan Seacrest. Although there are no plans to air it in the UK yet, we'll keep you up to date with any news on the matter!\n\nScroll through to see Zac Efron's complete transformation through the years...\n\nREAD MORE: Here's the real reason Zac Efron didn't sing in High School Musical\n\nTurn it up with Hits Radio!
