        "text": "Let's face it, my fellow Wildcats, we are living in some unprecedented times. Thankfully, in a musical blessing for the entire world, two High School Musical cast members held a virtual reunion to remind us that \"We're All In This Together.\"\n\nAs much of the world continues to practice social distancing in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19 â€” a highly infectious respiratory disease causing a global pandemic â€” Ashley Tisdale and Vanessa Hudgens took the time to share a gift with their followers.\n\nIt started when Ashley created her version of a virtual workout, which featured a flawless re-creation of the choreography from HSM. \"If you need to work out while on #selfquarantine try this ðŸ˜‚ hopefully this will brighten your day a little,\" she wrote.\n\nThe video was a treat for longtime HSM fans, but then Vanessa got in on the fun, joining TikTok to create a duet. For the duet, Vanessa captured herself singing along with Ashley. \"Well. Itâ€™s come to this. Lol @ashleytisdale maybe I start getting into tik tok? Username is vanessahudgens not vanessahudgens0 okay byeeee,\" she wrote of the video.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe unexpected virtual HSM reunion left many fans in their feelings. \"Iconic,\" one fan wrote. Meanwhile, Wells Adams had his own theory on the videos, writing, \"This looks like a 90â€™s montage where you convince Ashley to sign away her soul for sold out tickets to lollapalooza.\"\n\nBut the cast reunions didn't stop there. Following Ashley's lead, High School Musical members Kaycee Stroh (who played Martha Cox) and Bart Johnson (who played Coach Bolton) also got on in the fun â€” each posted their own duet with Ashley via TikTok.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nOur fingers are crossed that Zac Efron joins in on the challenge next. In the meantime, now would be a great time to take a cue from the girls and spend a little time re-learning the HSM dance.\n\nLet us slide into your DMs. Sign up for the Teen Vogue daily email."
