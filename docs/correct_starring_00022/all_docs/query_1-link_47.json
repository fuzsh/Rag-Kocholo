        "text": "One of the stars of the Disney Channel's hugely successful television movies High School Musical and High School Musical 2, Lucas Grabeel was a multi-talented performer who scored a couple of hit singles in 2006, both duets with High School Musical co-star Ashley Tisdale. Born November 23, 1984, Grabeel made his first Disney Channel movie appearance in Halloweentown High. The duets with Tisdale -- both from the first High School Musical film and soundtrack -- \"What I've Been Looking For\" and \"Bop to the Top\" placed in the Top 50 of the Billboard Hot 100, and his first solo single, \"You Got It,\" was featured in the sequel. ~ Chris True"
