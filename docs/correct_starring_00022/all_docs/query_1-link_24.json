        "text": "Peter, Chris, & Brian\n\nPeter gets a check in the mail from the sale of his motherâs home and he remembers that all of his old porn is still in there. When he returns to retrieve his stash, he finds a âto Peter from Peterâ tape and realizes that his life has amounted to nothing. Reeling from his own failures, Peter then attempts to fix Chris before itâs too late, and forces his son to spend time with Brian.\n\nCarter and Tricia\n\nCarter buys the Pawtucket Patriot brewery and decides to cut some corners to save a few bucks. Peter overhears the plan and runs and tells investigative journalist Tricia Takanawa about Carterâs plan to use toxic chemicals in the beer cans. Meanwhile, Brianâs driversâ license has expired and he enlists Stewie as an instructor.\n\nGronkowsbees\n\nRob Gronkowski, of the New England Patriots, moves into the house behind the Griffins, and the guys enjoy partying with him until his antics become overwhelming.Â Meanwhile, Stewie begins beekeeping and gives his bees steroids to produce more honey, but instead they become aggressive.\n\nTurkey Guys\n\nOn the night before Thanksgiving, Brian and Peter drunkenly devour the holiday bird, and then must go out to find a replacement. In Peter absence, Chris attempts to step up and become the man-of-the-house."
