        "text": "Was “High School Musical,” the Disney Channel sensation that rocked the tween nation, the start of a blockbuster franchise — or just a one-hit wonder? We’re about to find out.\n\n“High School Musical 2” debuts Friday night, and if it comes anywhere close to approaching the success of its predecessor, it will bop to the top of multiple media platforms and send dollars streaming out of Disney’s mouse ears.\n\nProducers have insisted that the goal coming into “HSM2” was not to replicate the original, but to let the story evolve and toss in a few surprises along the way. Consider their mission accomplished.\n\n“HSM2” reunites the entire impossibly cute cast, including Zac Efron as hunky hoop star Troy Bolton and Vanessa Hudgens as his main squeeze, brainy Gabriella Montez. But now the action shifts from clique-riddled East High to the posh Lava Springs Country Club, where most of the gang conveniently lands summer jobs and a rigid social hierarchy comes into play.\n\nLava Springs is owned by the parents of scheming drama queen Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale), who hatches a plot to wrest Troy away from Gabriella. The bait? A potential college basketball scholarship, courtesy of daddy’s well-connected friends. Will Troy fall for the ploy, or will he stay true to his heart?\n\nYes, it’s simplistic, sincere and more than a little sappy, but that’s missing the point. Like the film that spawned it, “HSM2” is all about having squeaky-clean, G-rated fun — the kind of fare you rarely find anymore amid a pop-cultural world that has abandoned class for crass. Push the envelope? Oh, gee whiz, this film has all the edge of a Nerf ball.\n\nIt also has a great beat. What instantly jumps out about “HSM2” are the song-and-dance sequences, which are much more elaborate than the original. The opening number, “What Time Is It, ” sets an exuberant, toe-tapping tone as scores of giddy kids rush from East High toward their summer vacations, bouncing off walls (and one another) along the way as if on a great big sugar high.\n\nDirector Kenny Ortega keeps things moving with “Fabulous,” which has Sharpay doing the poolside diva thing in all her pink-hued and sparkly glory. Warning to parents: Be ready to hear your kids belting out these lyrics well into winter.\n\nOh, and there’s also the start of something new as the romance between Troy and Gabriella begins to heat up. Content to do little more than gaze trancelike into each other’s eyes a year ago, they’re now getting just a tad more touchy-feely.\n\nNot to worry, though. It’s all done in a wholesome Disney sort of way. What did you expect from this franchise anyway — dirty dancing?\n\nChuck Barney is the Times TV critic.
