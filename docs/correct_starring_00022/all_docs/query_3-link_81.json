        "text": "Highest Rated: 93% Milk (2008)\n\nLowest Rated: 12% College Road Trip (2008)\n\nBirthday: Nov 23, 1984\n\nBirthplace: Springfield, Missouri, USA\n\nWith his Midwestern, fresh-faced sincerity and his talent for singing and dancing, Lucas Grabeel was seemingly a born natural for the Disney 'tween empire. He was barely out of high school himself when the Missouri transplant was cast in \"High School Musical\" (2006), becoming an instant teen idol for his role in the mega-hit film series and for his vocals on the best-selling soundtracks. His profile remained high with the three \"HSM\" films and several other Disney TV movies, but rather than risk being typecast in family films, Grabeel wisely got to work experimenting with a range of different material. Supporting roles in broad comedies and even dramas like \"Milk\" (2008) starring Sean Penn, indicated that there was more to Grabeel's onscreen appeal than just musical numbers, and that his charisma could easily translate to larger, more varied audiences.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n93% Milk 83% High School Musical 2\n\n67% High School Musical\n\n64% High School Musical 3: Senior Year\n\n30% Little Women\n\n12% College Road Trip\n\nPhotos\n\nSwitched at Birth, Vanessa Marano (L), Lucas Grabeel (R), 06/06/2011, ©KSITE Switched at Birth, Vanessa Marano (L), Lucas Grabeel (R), 'Between Hope and Fear', Season 4, Ep. #13, 09/07/2015, ©FREEFORM Switched at Birth, Vanessa Marano (L), Lucas Grabeel (R), 06/06/2011, ©KSITE LITTLE WOMEN, L-R: MELANIE STONE, ELISE JONES, LEA THOMPSON, SARAH DAVENPORT, ALLIE JENNINGS, LUCAS GRABEEL, 2018. © PURE FLIX ENTERTAINMENT Switched at Birth, Katie Leclerc (L), Lucas Grabeel (R), 'Your Body is a Battleground', Season 3, Ep. #2, 01/20/2014, ©FREEFORM MILK, from left: Sean Penn, Alison Pill, Emile Hirsch, Lucas Grabeel, 2008. ©Focus Features Switched at Birth, Vanessa Marano (L), Lucas Grabeel (R), 'Yuletide Fortune Tellers', Season 3, Ep. #22, 12/08/2014, ©FREEFORM Switched at Birth, D.W.
