Early life and work[]

Grabeel was born in Springfield, Missouri on November 23, 1984, the son of Jean (née Harman) and Stephen Grabeel.[1] He attended Logan-Rogersville elementary, middle and high school before transferring to and graduating from Kickapoo High School in Springfield in 2003. He also played drums for a local church and initiated a mens a cappella singing group at Kickapoo High school. He can also play the guitar and accordion; and can dance in the styles of jazz, ballet, hip-hop and tap.[2] While in Rogersville, Missouri, he regularly attended Harmony Baptist Church, where he was a part of the children’s and youth groups.[3] During the summer of 2002, He attended the Missouri Fine Arts Academy at Missouri State University. In a letter written to protest eliminating MFAA, Grabeel stated, "I wouldn't be where I am at if it weren't for my time at MFAA."

Following graduation, he moved to Los Angeles to become an actor. Two months after moving from home to L.A., Grabeel landed his first TV role in a commercial for toothpaste, and then eventually went to star in other commercials for Lego and Hot Wheels, and soon after, he landed his first film role in the third installment of the Halloweentown series; the Disney Channel Original Movie: Halloweentown High as the character Ethan Dalloway (he reprised his role in the fourth installment, Return to Halloweentown).

2006–2008: High School Musical[]

His biggest, and his best known, role was playing the part of Ryan Evans, the fraternal twin brother of Sharpay Evans (played by Ashley Tisdale), in the Emmy Award-winning made-for-television Disney movie High School Musical. He reprises his role in the sequels High School Musical 2 and the motion picture High School Musical 3: Senior Year. In 2007, he joined co-stars Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Corbin Bleu and Monique Coleman on the 51 date High School Musical: The Concert. In early 2009, Billboard believed that Grabeel and Tisdale’s track I Want It All should be nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category however, the song did not make the final shortlist.[4] During his time in High School Musical, Grabeel (along with his co-stars) had a total of six tracks chart in the Billboard Hot 100.[5][6][7][8] Furthermore, he and Tisdale are the first artists to debut in the Billboard Hot 100 with two simultaneous new entries in one week.[9]

Musical projects[]

Apart from his involvement in the High School Musical soundtracks, Grabeel also recorded a track called You Know I Will for the Fox and the Hound 2 soundtrack.

In 2006, he was offered a guest role on an episode of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody but when the script called for him to kiss co-star Ashley Tisdale, the role went to High School Musical co-star, Zac Efron, due to Grabeel and Tisdale’s brother-sister dynamic established in High School Musical.

Other film projects Grabeel was involved with includes the animated film, At Jesus' Side, where he voiced a dog called Jericho.[13] He also filmed the independent film, Alice Upside Down,[14] as the character of Lester McKinley, based on the "Alice book series" by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor.
