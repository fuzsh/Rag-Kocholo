Spoetzl Brewery

About Shiner and the Spoetzl Brewery The Spoetzl Brewery was founded in Shiner, Texas (population 2,069), in 1909, brewing beer with old-world traditions and recipes for the many German and Czech settlers in Central Texas. Since then, the brewery has grown to be one of the largest independent craft brewers in the country, available in all 50 states and Mexico. But every drop of our award-winning beer is still brewed right where it all started 110 years ago.
