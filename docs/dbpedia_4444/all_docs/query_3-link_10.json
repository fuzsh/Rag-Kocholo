        "text": "Part 1: Define\n\nEvery Drop of Shiner\n\nWith one brewery, 54 brewery workers, and a town with a total population of 2,070, things have to go pretty far awry before you’re accused of being too big. But that’s exactly what was happening with Shiner.\n\nWhen we started working with Shiner in 2003, the brand was in a tough spot. There were widespread rumors that they had sold out to a mass corporation like Bud or Miller.\n\nAnd there were more than a few things fueling the rumor mill:\n\nShiner’s recent packaging redesign looked like a mass beer brand’s packaging, leading to questions about recipe changes and cut corners.\n\nBock’s near ubiquity in Texas gave the impression that the brewery was far bigger than it actually was.\n\nErratic pricing gave conflicting quality cues and made it difficult to compete with specialty beers.\n\nPeople in Texas knew Shiner was from Texas, but not much else about it. And whatever small amount drinkers in Texas knew, those outside of the state knew even less.\n\nThe Shiner brand had lost its story.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, it wouldn’t have been enough to prove to people that Shiner was still small, that it hadn’t sold out. Those were just facts; they lacked grit, momentum, perspective.\n\nWe dug into why people were disappointed to think Shiner was big. We heard the expected reasons — big means corporate, big means lower quality — but we also heard something more. It was the early stages of social media’s prominence, and everything became a context clue for who you were, including what beer you drank. People sought out brands that reflected the values they cared about, that made them feel connected to something real. And beer drinkers were no different. Sure, small was shorthand for quality, but it also meant community.\n\nBefore the rumors started, Shiner had been a brand many could relate to. For decades it was a staple for those who wanted something local, who weren’t swayed by slick advertising, who liked to do their own thing.\n\nAnd so Shiner’s first positioning was born, which guided the brand for 10 years: “Champion for Small.”\n\nIt was a celebration of the underdogs, of normal people running on perseverance and pride. Nothing could have better reflected the town of Shiner, or the brewery, or the brewers themselves.\n\nStraight out of the brewery\n\nTo communicate Shiner’s “small” values, we started with the people who live those values every day. The print ads featured Shiner brewery workers, celebrating the people, hard work, and pride that make each bottle of Shiner Bock possible. Some even received extra special placement in well-loved bars and local music venues.\n\nIndie beer, indie music\n\nBeer and music are an easy fit. And Shiner had been supporting live music since the brewery opened, first in the form of impromptu beer hall songs and later on stage. The “Champion for Small” positioning set the vision for a stronger connection between Shiner and music: as a proudly small, proudly independent brewery making it without the resources of bigger breweries, Shiner sought to support the independent musicians doing the same.\n\nOne of our early initiatives around Shiner and music centered around the Austin City Limits music festival.\n\nShiner is not an Austin brewery, but it is an Austin beer. Just 79 miles away from Shiner, TX, Austin is the setting for many of Shiner’s best stories, the place Bock first took off, and home to some of Shiner’s most passionate fans. For these reasons and more, it made sense for Shiner to be present at Austin City Limits, but there was no chance the brewery could write a formal sponsorship check for half a million. So we did what a scrappy underdog brand does, and became the unofficial beer sponsor. That situation led to three happy years of non-sponsorship.\n\nYear One: Heineken sponsored the beer. Shiner sponsored the koozies.\n\nYear Two: Heineken sponsored the first beer. Shiner sponsored the second one.\n\nYear Three: Budweiser sponsored big artists on the big stages. Shiner sponsored local artists on a stage so independent it was in the air, literally.\n\nCan’t buy love\n\nIronically, as we continued to work against the rumors that Shiner sold out, we were at a slight disadvantage: Shiner’s biggest competition was outspending us by 150 to 1. But we had an asset the competition didn’t. Shiner Bock still had an incredibly passionate fanbase. So we created the Bock Love campaign to rally Shiner’s fans and share their enthusiasm to influence others.\n\nA Bock Love page on the site served as the campaign hub. We created confessional-style “Ram Cams,” a traveling photo booth, and turned banner ads into click-to-enable webcams. We asked Shiner Bock fans to speak for themselves, and what they said spoke volumes.\n\nThe tight brand story we told around the “Champion for Small” positioning worked — we were able to dispel the misperceptions about Shiner with with a fraction of the budget of their biggest competitors.\n\nOnce the name “Shiner” again had strong brand connotations among drinkers across Texas and in neighboring states, it was time to reach for more. The next phase of our relationship with Shiner was about expanding, entering new territory without losing what made Shiner special in the first place.\n\nPart 2: Grow\n\nA heyday for breweries was beginning as we entered into the second decade of the 2000s.\n\nIn 2010 alone, retail sales from craft beer increased by 12%. Though craft beer represented a relatively small portion of the overall beer market, the energy and excitement brought by the increase of brewers and beer styles was palpable.\n\nShiner had been independently brewing a variety of beer styles for over 100 years, and there was finally a national audience seeking out breweries doing exactly that.\n\nIn conjunction with the growing craft beer industry, Shiner began its own growth spurt. For the first time, Shiner began branching out from old-world Czech and German beer styles. The brewery doubled production, twice. And the little Spoetzl Brewery from Shiner gained national distribution.\n\nShiner’s expansion extended to new geographies, new people, and new beers. Each was an opportunity to tell different parts of Shiner’s story.\n\nOver the course of our partnership with Shiner, we were proud to design the look and feel for nearly 50 new brews. We designed Bock and Light Blonde, both of which today boast distinct packaging that has changed very little from our original designs, as well as a multitude of new seasonals, limited-release rotating lines, and new year round beers that varied from developing a standard Shiner design template to truly one-off designs.\n\nTwo beers we designed during this growth period for Shiner warrant special mention: Wild Hare and White Wing. Each of these beers was a truly blank slate and an opportunity to develop unique sub-brands and personalities within the larger Shiner Beers portfolio. The campaigns were unlike other beer advertising at the time, resonated with Shiner fans in a new and fresh way, and, frankly, were a ton of fun to work on.\n\nWild Hare\n\nIt was the first ale from Shiner, brewed in a recently added section of the Spoetzl Brewery. It was also one of Shiner’s first departures from more recognizably Czech-German beer styles. In a season of firsts, and a spirit of trying new things, it became the first Shiner beer to get its own personality, look and feel that was distinct from Bock. And personality it got in spades (or technically, in rabbits) along with a campaign inspired by the nature channel.\n\nWhite Wing\n\nThis was one of those projects that got off to an odd start for a few reasons, but mostly because it was a Belgian White. Rather than shy away from the fact that the style felt like a bit of a departure for Shiner, we leaned into the difference. We partnered with The Onion, created a “catch and release” tagging program for fans who came across the new beer in the “wild,” and even created a custom cuckoo clock for bars. Sure it was odd, but it was delightfully so.\n\nNew market expansion\n\nDuring this period, Shiner entered multiple new markets including New York, Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia. All four are large markets with crowded beer landscapes, where it’s tough to make noise with a limited budget and distribution is brutally competitive. As with most major markets at the time, larger breweries like Bud, Miller and Coors were outspending Shiner by 100 to 1.\n\nWe embraced Shiner’s smallness, looking around these big cities with a small-town perspective. We focused on hyper-targeting, reached out to neighborhoods and communities with Texas ex-pats, and got creative with outdoor placements. But perhaps most importantly, we didn’t change who Shiner was based on which market we entered — there is no New York version of Shiner or Chicago version of Shiner, there’s just Shiner. And in the middle of a bustling city, Shiner stands out.\n\nMeanwhile, among the constant stream of newer, ever smaller breweries, Shiner became relatively big. Shiner was distributed in 48 states, with 8 year-round beers, a rotating seasonal line, and a rotating small batch line.\n\nShiner’s expansion succeeded, but with that success came a new challenge.\n\nPart 3: Defend\n\nBetween 2008 and 2016 alone, the number of breweries in the US expanded by a factor of six. Robust craft beer assortments in grocery stores and at bars were no longer a specialty, they were expected.\n\nAt the same time, and somewhat paradoxically, overall beer consumption in the US was slowing down. Mid-sized breweries like Shiner were in a tough spot. They didn’t have the money to compete with big breweries on advertising and sponsorships, but they also didn’t have the cache of the experimental brewery that just opened around the corner.\n\nThe abundance of beer in the market highlighted the need for a strong brand. Messages about flavor or ingredients would be quickly lost among a hundred others. But, among so many new craft breweries, the “Champion for Small” positioning no longer fit. Shiner’s values hadn’t changed, but their size and reach had: Shiner was no longer small.\n\nThe positioning needed to evolve to reflect the new realities of both Shiner and the industry.\n\nThe most interesting thing about Shiner\n\nTo help Shiner find new footing in the evolving beer industry, we first needed to understand how drinkers were thinking about beer in general and about Shiner specifically.\n\nWhen it came to beer in general, we found many beer drinkers were overwhelmed. All the new beer options contributed to selection anxiety in bars and grocery stores alike. Those who readily described themselves as “not a beer snob” found it hard to remember which beers they’d tried, much less which they’d liked. Sometimes the revolving selection struck them as exciting and fun, but many times they just wanted a good beer they didn’t have to research first.\n\nWhen it came to Shiner, this same group called it the beer equivalent of a favorite pair of jeans. It’s not the newest, it’s not the most exciting or adventurous, but it’s reliable and it’s always good. They also associated Shiner closely with being Texan, giving the brand credibility outside of the usual craft beer considerations.\n\nThere’s a mythic element to Texan-ness, and it goes further than geography. It’s a fierce independence. It’s good-natured rebelliousness, irreverence accompanied by a warm smile. It’s the fire and perseverance that kept the the Spoetzl Brewery’s doors open for 109 years. It’s the sense of humor that moved the brand forward — when life doesn’t give you a delivery truck, use a hearse!\n\nThat ineffable “Shiner-y-ness” that was so hard to define? Our fans thought it was quite the same as the values that make someone a Texan, the values that give someone pride in place. Shiner is the beer Texas would be if Texas were a beer.\n\nAnd so the Shiner positioning evolved to reflect this simple truth.\n\nAfter all, the most interesting thing about Shiner is Shiner, Texas."
