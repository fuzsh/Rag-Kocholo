        "text": "Bulleit Frontier Whiskey and Shiner Beer announced a partnership on June 20, which kicked off with an event held in Dallas, Texas, to celebrate Shiner’s newest limited-time offer barrel-aged beer, Brewer’s Pride Barrel Aged Imperial Red Ale.\n\nAged in Bulleit Bourbon barrels, the wood imparted flavors of vanilla to compliment the ale’s toasty caramel malt character. The ale is well-rounded with toasty biscuit flavors and strikes a balance between medium hop bitterness and malt sweetness. Shiner fans in Texas can find this limited-run beer at select retailers, bars and restaurants statewide.\n\nBulleit is excited to partner with the historic Spoetzl Brewery, the family-owned, independent makers of Shiner Bock. The Spoetzl Brewery was founded in Shiner, Texas in 1909 and has since become one of the largest craft brewers in the country. 114 years later, every drop of the award-winning beer is brewed in Shiner, Texas.\n\n“At Shiner, we’re always inspired by bartenders who pair Shiner beers with great whiskies like Bulleit,” says Jimmy Mauric, Shiner’s Head Brewmaster. “It’s a special moment for us to bring this to life by marrying these flavors in our bold, new special Brewer’s Pride release.”\n\nThe event honored the timeless tradition of a beer and a shot by offering attendees exclusive first tastes of the Brewer’s Pride Barrel Aged Imperial Red Ale, accompanied by a shot of Bulleit Bourbon.\n\n“At Bulleit, we believe that businesses have a great responsibility to take ownership of their environmental, social and human impact,” said Johannah Rogers, Global Brand Director at Bulleit Frontier Whiskey. “We’re proud to upcycle our barrels by giving them to breweries through the Bulleit and Beer program, and we’re excited to support local markets and celebrate the amazing partnerships that the program creates.”\n\nAs one of the fastest growing bourbons in the United States, Bulleit is honored to bring its growth to the local level, and partner with community-driven breweries. To date, Bulleit has partnered with over 25 breweries across 30 states, and over 20 limited run beers have come out of the program.\n\nSycamore Brewing brings back Drippy, debuts Juicy Lager\n\nSycamore Brewing, the largest Charlotte-born brewery and top three craft brewery in North Carolina, is debuting the brand new Juicy Lager (7.2% ABV) IPA alongside the return of tropical fan-favorite Drippy (7% ABV). Juicy Lager is a one-off distribution mainly in Charlotte and surrounding areas, whereas Drippy has a larger distribution in select stores spanning several states including North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia and Ohio.\n\n“Juicy Lager and Drippy make perfect sense for summertime sipping,” says Sycamore Brewing Co-Owner, Sarah Taylor Brigham. “Both these easy-drinking, crushable beers are packed with fruity, refreshing flavors for lager lovers and IPA fans alike.”\n\nJuicy Lager’s upfront tangerine and Valencia orange flavors are intertwined with bright grapefruit for a light finish. The hazy beer is brewed with lager yeast, preserving its lager-like characteristics while delivering an abundance of hop flavor, low bitterness and soft mouth feel.\n\nDrippy’s bright mandarin orange, lime, grapefruit and tangerine notes combine with vanilla and melty creamsicle for a fresh and fruity drinking experience from first sip to last drip.\n\nLord Hobo teams with The Sausage Guy for 617 Day\n\nLord Hobo Brewing is celebrating 617 Day this year with The Sausage Guy. The two Boston brands have teamed up to brew an amber lager that is crisp and refreshing with a touch of malt sweetness, making for an incredible pair when enjoyed with a sausage from The Sausage Guy. The 617 Day Amber Lager will only be available at Lord Hobo’s locations with bigger distribution plans in the near future.\n\n“We worked together to brew the perfect beer that brings out each distinctive flavor of our savory sausages,” stated David Littlefield, owner of The Sausage Guy. “Lord Hobo has been a great partner, and together, we’ve captured a true Boston beer.”\n\nIn addition to this limited release, Lord Hobo plans to celebrate the big day at their Boston and Woburn locations. All day they will be serving The Sausage Guy Sausages topped with Grillo’s Pickle de Gallo as an extra special addition. Lord Hobo will have a specialty flight with their whole 617 lineup, as well as a pop-up from Diversity Consign at Lord Hobo Boston from 3-6pm. Lord Hobo is also taking over Hub Hall in Boston for the day with a DJ, Hall games, giveaways, and beer samplings starting at noon.\n\nIn even bigger news, Lord Hobo announced that they are bringing back their 6.17k Charity Run this year on August 12, 2023. “We were elated to celebrate with the community of Woburn and our loyal fans last year on 617 Day. This year, we have even bigger and better plans and cannot wait to celebrate with everyone,” states Kate Ballenger, Director of Customer Experience. The 6.17k tickets will go on sale this Wednesday, June 21st, with a portion of the proceeds going to a local charity.\n\nBig winners at NW Cider Cup\n\nCidermakers from Oregon, Washington, Idaho , Montana and British Columbia took home awards from the Northwest region’s most stringent cider competition – NW Cider Cup – now in its 10th year.\n\n“Every year the competition offers consumers and buyers a guide for finding quality ciders, and this year really showcased how creative and dynamic this industry has become,” said Emily Ritchie, Executive Director of the Northwest Cider Association (NWCA), the trade non-profit that organizes the NW Cider Cup. “The number of cideries in our region has increased from around 10 to 200 in a little over a decade – that’s nearly a 2,000% increase. To say that we’ve seen some growth would be an understatement.”\n\n2023 was a record breaking year, receiving 279 entries from 51 unique commercial cider and perry makers, across the country’s largest apple growing region.\n\n“This year was the first time in the competition’s history that a red-fleshed dry cider took Best of Show, which was thrilling,” added Ritchie. “Not only does it show how far both cidermaking practices and consumer palates have come, but the pink apple varietal that won was originally discovered in Oregon. To me, this shows that we are developing unique regional styles that are terroir driven. This is how far we’ve evolved.”\n\nThe big winners were …\n\nBest of Show – Alpenfire Cider (WA) I Glow-Airlie RedFlesh single varietal I Red-Fleshed Cider Dry Category\n\nBest of Show Runner Up – Yonder Cider (WA) Barrel Aged Perry I High-Tannin Perry Category\n\nBest New Cidery *TIE* Empyrical Orchards (WA) and Cidery and Heartland Ciderworks (OR)\n\nBest Small Cidery – Puget Sound Cider Company (WA)\n\nBest Medium Cidery – Bauman’s Cider (OR)\n\nBest Large Cidery – 2 Towns Ciderhouse (OR)\n\nFor a full listing of winners visit www.nwcider.com/nwcc2023\n\nSan Diego Wave FC, NOVA collab on signature hard kombucha\n\nNOVA and San Diego Wave FC have unveiled their signature hard kombucha La Ola Dragon Fruit, which will be available for the first time Saturday at Snapdragon Stadium when the National Women’s Soccer League club takes on Angel City FC. NOVA is the Official Hard Kombucha of Wave FC.\n\nLa Ola is Spanish for “The Wave”, and it was brewed at NOVA’s facility in Chula Vista. Wave players, coaches, support staff, and front-office personnel collaborated with NOVA brewers to choose the exclusive flavor and artwork.\n\nLa Ola will be available on the top level of The Sycuan Piers at the south end of the stadium above sections 118 – 120, as well as at the NOVA container bar on the east concourse behind sections 103 – 105. Beginning next week, the hard kombucha will be available on draft, in 16-oz single cans, and in six packs of 12-oz cans at NOVA (and NOVO Brazil Brewing) locations. Retail stores throughout San Diego County will also carry the canned beverage (store locator).\n\n“We are proud to brew and create all our beverages here in Southern California,” said NOVA founder Tiago Carneiro. “The opportunity to collaborate with the Wave and bring our locally-brewed beverage to Snapdragon Stadium and across San Diego for fans to enjoy allows soccer fans to have the perfect beverage for watching the world’s game.”\n\n“We are delighted to be a part of this collaborative effort with our partners at NOVA Kombucha,” said Wave President Jill Ellis. “Our players and staff were thrilled to be included in the creation of La Ola Dragon Fruit, as it truly is a drink as unique as our club.”\n\nOriginal 40 Brewing asks the important question\n\nSan Diego’s The Original 40 Brewing Company released Can We Kick It? West Coast IPA last week. The limited release is available on draft and in four packs of 16-oz cans.\n\nCan We Kick it? is double dry hopped with Strata, Mosaic, Mosaic Cryo, HBC 586, and HBC 586 Cryo hops. It has a 6.6% alcohol-by-volume (ABV) and aromas of pine, orange blossoms, and citrus.\n\n“We proudly present our latest homage to old-school West Coast IPAs, but one that uses our newest tricks and techniques,” said Head Brewer Zack Kaplan. “It’s a great, drinkable beer this weekend and beyond for dads, grads, and everyone in between.”\n\nCan We Kick It? pays tribute to the song “Can I Kick It?” from the hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest, which originally released the track in 1990. The song appeared on New Musical Express’s “100 Best Songs of the 1990s” list.\n\n“I guess you can say Zack made this latest brew with hip hop hops,” said Original 40 founder Steve Billings. “The only thing better than great beer is great beer that’s fun and might just get your feet tapping.”"
