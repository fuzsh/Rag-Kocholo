        "text": "Author: Marshall Schott\n\nAs we approach the second quarter of 2023, I can’t help but think back to what we’ve all been through over the last few years, and how happy I am to be able to go out in the world again. While I admittedly developed a bit of an obsession with Call Of Duty during the pandemic, I’ve loved getting back out to breweries, hanging out with friends, and travelling to rad places.\n\nOddly enough, there seems to be general consensus among those I communicate with in the world of homebrewing that interest in the hobby is trending downward. I’ve heard speculation that this is due to the state of the economy, though it’s my understanding that historically homebrewing does well during rougher times. I personally feel there’s likely more at play, I’m just not entirely sure what that is.\n\nEither way, one thing I trust everyone reading this agrees on is that homebrewing kicks ass and we want as many people to experience it as possible. This is a our driving motivation here at Brülosophy– by publishing 2 articles, 2 podcasts, and a YouTube video every week, we hope to demystify the brewing process and make it more approachable while also honoring the great work of those who came before us. Whether boom or bust, we’ll be here doing our thing!\n\n2023 General Homebrewer Survey\n\nI’m curious like a cat, which is why soon after starting Brülosophy I had the idea to collect data to get an idea of what the modern homebrewer looks like. After sharing those first results, it occurred to me that by collecting the same data annually would be an interesting way to track temporal changes, which could potentially provide various insights. While there have definitely been some changes over the years, there’s unfortunately been some very consistent trends, and it’s our hope that this survey might help to incite some positive movement.\n\nNaturally, not every brewer out there loves Brülosophy as much as we tell ourselves during our morning affirmation rituals, and seeing as as our goal is to capture the broadest set of data possible, we’d like to ask that you share this survey with all of you brewing friends, regardless of their feelings about. Rest assured, this is a completely anonymous survey where the raw data does not get shared with anybody outside of Brülosophy\n\n(more…)\n\nAuthor: Cade Jobe\n\nLess commonly used in modern brewhouses, 6-row barley malt was quite popular among early American brewers not only because of its general availability, but it also possesses a higher diastatic power than its 2-row counterpart. Put simply, diastatic power refers to the amount of enzymes available in malt to convert starches into fermentable sugar, which is especially important when using non-diastatic adjunct grains such as corn and rice.\n\nIn addition to the differences in enzymatic content, 6-row barley also tends to have more carbohydrates and less protein than 2-row barley, which many believe has a perceptible impact on flavor. Indeed, tasters in a past xBmt were able to reliably distinguish a pale lager made entirely with 6-row malt from one made with 2-row malt, indicating each may contribute unique organoleptic characteristics.\n\nIn discussing the aforementioned xBmt on a recent episode of The Brülosophy Podcast, I found it interesting how similar the beers were in terms of original and finishing gravities, as I expected the version made with 6-row to have better conversion. This made me wonder how things would’ve looked had both beers included a dose of non-diastatic adjunct grain, so I designed an xBmt to test it out!\n\n(more…)\n\nAuthor: Jordan Folks\n\nLiving in the craft beer mecca that is Portland, OR for over a decade now, it’s easy to take my bountiful access to world class brews for granted. However, I didn’t always have it this easy. During my undergrad years in the aughts in Oklahoma, there were very few craft options at the time, which could have been because they didn’t think it would sell, or they were horrified by the law prohibiting the commercial refrigeration of any packaged beer above 4% ABV.\n\nOne of the few reliably available craft options at the time is what is widely viewed as one of the original American craft beers– Shiner Bock, a dark lager made by Spoetzl Brewery from Shiner, TX. While American-made, Shiner Bock is a glorious example of an International Dark Lager, which the BCJP describes as:\n\nA darker, richer, and somewhat sweeter version of international pale lager with a little more body and flavor, but equally restrained in bitterness. The low bitterness leaves the malt as the primary flavor element, and the low hop levels provide very little in the way of balance.\n\nFor the past 10 years, I’ve ravenously consumed all the brewing science I could get my eyes and ears on, then meticulously applied it to my brewing. Short & Shoddy is the antithesis to my brewing philosophy, especially for lagers, which is why for my inaugural Short & Shoddy batch, I figured I would go back to my roots by brewing an International Dark Lager using this painfully abbreviated approach.\n\n(more…)\n\nAuthor: Mike Neville\n\nThe term “lager” is unique in that it’s both a noun, referring to a general type of beer, and a verb, describing the way in which beer is treated. In essence, lager is lagered, meaning after being fermented cool, they go through an extended period of cold conditioning before they’re ready to be served, or at least they’re supposed to go through such a step.\n\nOver the last few years, brewers have started experimenting with fermenting lager styles at warmer than recommended temperatures, the goal being to reduce the overall turnaround time, which also tends to involve a drastic reduction in lagering time. While certain lager yeast strains do appear to be more sensitive to the temperature at which they’re fermented, others seem to be more robust, producing beers that are largely indistinguishable even when fermented upwards of 20°F/10°C apart.\n\nDescribed as “a northern European lager yeast famously used in Pilsner style beers that complement significant hop additions,” Imperial Yeast L25 Hygge was first released as a seasonal strain in the winter of 2022 with a recommended fermentation temperature range of 46 – 56°F/8 – 13°C. While I personally have no issues taking a more traditional approach to lager fermentation, I was curious how this novel strain would react to different temperatures and designed an xBmt to test it out.\n\n(more…)\n\nAuthor: Steve Thanos\n\nAfter cutting the ribbon in January 2012, Plainfield, IL’s Werk Force Brewing rather quickly earned a reputation for crafting uniquely delicious beers. As a local, I’m proud to say I’ve been a regular patron of Werk Force since their inception, and more recently, they granted me Brülosophy data collection privileges in their taproom.\n\nAs much as I enjoy the crisp, clear IPA originating from the West Coast and the soft, hazy IPA stemming from the East Coast, my Midwest roots are obvious in my preference malt-forward hoppy ale. One of my favorite local commercial beers that I feel beautifully exemplifies this is Werk Force Brewing’s Bad Polaroid, which they describe as “a double red brewed with a boatload of Citra, Columbus, and Cascade hops in the mash, boil, and the fermenter.” Speaking my language!\n\nI recently had the opportunity to chat with Amanda and Brandon Wright, owners of Werk Force Brewing, and mentioned my love of Bad Polaroid, at which point they offered to share the recipe with me. Excited to try my hand at making a personal fave, I took detailed notes, scaled the recipe down to 5 gallons/19 liters, and got to brewing!\n\n(more…)\n\nAuthor: Will Lovell\n\nRich in both tradition and controversy among American brewers, corn is a New World ingredient with evidence of use in the production of alcoholic beverages that stretches back to pre-Incan times. As thirsty Europeans who’d arrived to the shores of the Americas began brewing the beers of their homeland, they often relied on corn to supplement more difficult to come by barley malt. These days, corn is perhaps most notably used in mass-produced yellow lager, which likely explains the less-than-positive views some hold on this historic grain.\n\nWhile flake corn, also referred to as maize, is the form that’s likely most familiar to modern brewers, it can also be malted in a similar fashion as barley, giving it the quality of being able to self-convert. For robust styles, corn is typically used to increase alcohol content while contributing minimal aroma, flavor, or body, and even for more delicate beers, the overall perceptible impact of corn is often noted as being rather subtle.\n\nI’ve brewed many batches of beer using flaked maize, and in my experience, it’s done pretty much what I expected it to. I recently picked up a sack of TexMalt Texas Blue Corn Malt, which they say “gives notes of sweet tortilla dough and homemade grits.” With a few past xBmts producing conflicting results on the perceptual impact flaked maize has on beer, I designed an xBmt to see how this unique malted corn product impacts a simple pale lager.\n\n(more…)"
