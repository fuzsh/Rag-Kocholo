        "meta_description": "The Spoetzl Brewery was founded in Shiner, Texas (population 2,069), in 1909, brewing beer with old-world traditions and recipes for the many German and Czech settlers in Central Texas. Since then, the brewery has grown to be one of the largest independent craft brewers in the country, available in 49 states and Mexico. But every drop of our award-winning beer is still brewed right where it all started 108 years ago. Visit us at www.shiner.com.",
