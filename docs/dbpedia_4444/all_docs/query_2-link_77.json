        "text": "The independent, family-owned brewers of the iconic Shiner Bock Beer, announce the release of Tall ‘Tails, a mixed 12-pack of all-natural, cocktail-inspired hard seltzers. Each flavor, Ruby Red Paloma, Watermelon Margarita, Texas Mule and Mexican Martini, riffs on a classic Texan favorite.\n\nSince its founding in 1909, every drop of Shiner is proudly brewed and bottled in the original brewery in Shiner, Texas. While widely known for their beers, Shiner also offers premium hard seltzers. Tall ‘Tails builds on Shiner’s hard seltzer portfolio by bringing craft cocktails down to earth and giving them a uniquely Texan character.\n\nEach artistically designed can features a “tall tale” of the drink’s origin—for example, the Watermelon Margarita can tell the story of Margarita the ghost, a mysterious Watermelon Maid who can be seen wandering at night. Legend has it, Shiner’s brewers camped out to find her, and when they did, she offered an ancient Watermelon Margarita recipe. Of course, the Shiner brewers would never tell a tale… would they?\n\nThe Watermelon Margarita combines juicy watermelon with tart lime for a sweet spin on a traditional favorite, while Shiner’s Texan Mule mixes a burst of lime with a zip of zesty ginger. The Mexican Martini is a lime and agave cocktail is topped off with just a hint of brine for a sweet and slightly salty treat. Another Texan favorite, the Ruby Red Paloma takes the bold grapefruit flavor that the Rio Grande Valley is known for and adds a kick of lime.\n\n“With the launch of Tall ‘Tails, Shiner is sharing the lore of Texan culture far and wide. These unique cocktail-inspired cans are best when enjoyed in the company of good friends while telling (or creating) tall tales of your own,” shares Matt Pechman, Spoetzl Brewing’s Head of Marketing.\n\nThe Tall ‘Tails 12-pack (4.5% ABV) is available now at retailers nationwide. Each can is gluten-free with just 100 calories with 1g of sugar and 3g of carbs. For more information on Shiner Beers and its full portfolio, visit www.shiner.com.\n\nPhoto courtesy Nick Simonite"
