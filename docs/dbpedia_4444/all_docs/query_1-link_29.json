        "text": "The Flying Monkeys were restless and wanted to explore some new place, so off we went to Shiner, Texas\n\nShiner is located in Lavaca County.\n\nIt all began in 1887 when Henry B. Shiner donated 250 acres of land for a railroad right of way.\n\nAs of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 2,069.\n\nTo our amazement there are no hotels in Shiner! So we booked a room at the Shiner Country Inn..\n\nNot the lap of luxury, but clean\n\nShiner is the home of the Spoetzl Brewery, the oldest independent brewery in Texas. The brewery is most well known for producing Shiner Bock, a dark German/Czech-style beer that is now distributed in 41 states.\n\n………..but more about that later.\n\nWe explored the entire town to plan our itinerary………okay that took 10 minutes,\n\nso we went to Snowflake Donuts for breakfast…\n\nUpon entering we found a table of about 20 locals, all of whom ceased conversation and stared at us the entire time we were in the place…….okay weird!\n\n………..now back the the Spotzl Brewery……\n\nA group of businessmen incorporated Shiner Brewing Association\n\nand placed Herman Weiss in as the company’s first brewmaster.\n\nIn 1914 a German immigrant brewer named Kosmos Spoetzl co-leased with Oswald Petzold\n\nwith an option to buy in 1915.\n\nSpoetzl had attended brewmaster’s school and apprenticed for three years in Germany, worked for eight years at the Pyramids Brewery in Cairo, Egypt, and then worked in Canada. He moved to San Antonio in search of a better climate for his health, bringing with him a family recipe for a Bavarian beer made from malted barley and hops.\n\nDuring Prohibition in the United States, Kosmos Spoetzl kept the brewery afloat by selling ice and making Low-alcohol beer “near beer.” After Prohibition only five of the original 13 Texas breweries were still intact. When the Prohibition laws were repealed, larger beer plants, such as Anheuser-Busch, moved to Texas making life harder on the smaller independent breweries, but Spoetzl kept things small and simple, never going more than 70 miles for business.\n\nThe owner’s daugher, Miss Cecelie took over operations in 1922\n\nand became the only woman in the United States to be a sole owner of a brewery in 1950.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s the brewery’s ”Shiner Beer” and ”Shiner Bock” had less than 1 percent of the Texas market. In 1983 Spoetzl produced 60,000 barrels of beer; in 1990 only 36,000. Sales improved after Carlos Alvarez of San Antonio acquired the brewery in 1989: Production grew to 100,000 barrels in 1994, and over the next ten years, production nearly tripled.\n\nAs of 2012, it was the fourth-largest craft brewery and tenth-largest overall brewery in the United States. Spoetzl currently produces eight beers year round and four seasonal brews per year.\n\nWe were so lucky to have the Brewmaster, Jimmy Mauric, conduct a personal tour!\n\nThe brew house was so very beautiful with the copper brew tanks…\n\nThe view of the bottling room was amazing……..many thousands of bottles whirling around…..\n\nThe tour over it was time for a late lunch……….where should we go…..oh yes the only restaurant in town….\n\nThe Shiner Restaurant and Bar..\n\nThe place was empty! The bar was quite beautiful and ornate\n\nThe dining room sported wonderful old cabinets…\n\nThe food was great….we began with the Shiner Beer Bread and Shiner Black Butter\n\n…..then on to the Pulled Pork Sandwich and the “World’s Best Sandwich”……that was really the name!\n\nIt was a Club Style BLT with a Chicken Fried Steak thrown in for Good Measure…….don’t tell my Cardiologist about this post!\n\nWell that was Shiner a quiet, quiet, quiet little Texas Town\n\nSo until next time…………PROST!"
