        "text": "Shiner Beer’s Hard Seltzer\n\nSpoetzl Brewery, the over-100-year-old Texas brewery behind Shiner beers, is making its own hard seltzer. The Shiner Straight Shooter, which is being made with water sourced from the brewery’s hometown of Shiner, will be produced in four flavors: wild cherry, lemonade, mango, and grapefruit/lime. Available formats include a variety 12-can pack, and six-can packs dedicated to the lemonade and wild cherry options. The hard seltzers will be available in the state only at the end of August.\n\nSimilarly, Topo Chico, which now operates under the Coca-Cola umbrella, recently announced it was launching its own hard seltzer, though it will only be available in Latin America sometime later this year.\n\nBagel Schmear Collaboration\n\nAustin bagel shop Rosen’s is creating collaborative schmears, spreads, and toppings with local restaurants and food shops. Each item will be available for a month through the bagel shop’s website (alongside its frozen bagels), as well as its physical location within East Austin cafe and beer bar Brew & Brew. August includes the peach jam and toasted pecan schmear with the Austin Jam Company, and the caramelized kimchi schmear with Chi’lantro (the latter will be added permanently to Rosen’s menu). September will feature a chili relish and cilantro schmear with Old Thousand, and October has a to-be-announced lineup of spreadable cheeses picked out by Antonelli’s Cheese Shop."
