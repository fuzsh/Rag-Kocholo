        "text": "Description\n\nWhat a fascinating history there is behind the Spoetzl Brewery! Immigrant Czech and German farmers settled the little town of Shiner, Texas (some eighty miles Southeast of Austin), in 1887. Longing for the old-world taste of their homeland, they quickly formed the Shiner Brewing Association, in 1909.\n\nKosmos Spoetzl was born, grew up, and earned his Brewmasters degree in Germany. After years of working at various breweries in Europe and Canada, he moved to the United States and, in 1915, bought \"The Little Brewery in Shiner.\" Not a whole lot ever changes in Shiner and that's the way we like it. To this day, we still use Kosmos' original recipes and painstakingly handcraft each brew one at a time making sure that every beer is naturally aged before it leaves the Brewery.\n\nEven our Brewmaster and General Manager, John Hybner, hasn't changed in nearly a quarter of a century. In fact, we still have less than fifty employees. But one thing that has changed is our willingness to share. There was a time when you could only get Shiner Beer in Texas. Now we distribute to 20 other states. So if you live outside Texas, you can drink a toast to Carlos Alvarez, owner of the Brewery, who's responsible for our recent building and market expansion. Cheers, Carlos!"
