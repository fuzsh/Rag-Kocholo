        "text": "Shiner Brewing Association opened in 1909 and closed in 1913 it was open for 4 years. Breweries that are only open for a couple of years like this did not have a long time to produce advertising and collectibles so they tend to be more scarce than breweries with more longevity. As a Pre-Prohibition Brewery, any advertising items or collectibles are likely to be valuable and desirable to collectors as they tend to be hard to find. Our information indicates that Shiner Brewing Association was the only brewery that was located in Shiner, TX sometimes this means that items from a brewery will have extra value in the area it comes from because there are not other sources for local breweriana."
