        "text": "Who owns SHINER BEER?\n\nSHINER BEER is owned by\n\nTHE GAMBRINUS COMPANY\n\nWebsite\n\nShiner Beer was created in 1909 in Shiner, Texas, United States. It was originally owned by the Shiner Brewing Association, a collective of German and Czech immigrants who settled in the area. Looking to increase their clout after growing some popularity in the area, the Shiner Brewing Association began looking for a world class brewer. They found a Bavarian named Kosmos Spoetzl, who was trained as a brewmaster in Germany. In 1914, they offered him the job, which included an ownership stake, and in 1915 he took over the brewery and renamed it The Spoetzl Brewery.\n\nIn 1989, Spoetzl was purchased by The Gambrinus Company. The companyâ€™s owner, Carlos Alvarez, was at the time a long-time beer distributor in the region, and was largely responsible for the popularity of Corona in the United States. Sales improved under the new ownership, reaching 100,000 barrels in 1994. In 2012, it was the 4th largest craft brewery in the country. The Gambrinus Company also owns the Trumer Brewery in Berkeley, California.\n\nPopular Beers by this Brand\n\nShiner Bock\n\nLight\n\nGolden Ale\n\nLemon Pils\n\nAgua Fresca\n\nLight Blonde\n\nPremium Lager\n\nWeisse N Easy\n\nFamily Reunion\n\nWhite Wing Ale\n\nWicked Ram IPA\n\nSea Salt & Lime\n\nWicked Juicy IPA\n\nHoliday Cheer Ale\n\nRuby Redbird Lager\n\nHomespun Cream Ale\n\nWild Hare Pale Ale\n\n1909 Heritage Lager\n\nBohemian Black Lager\n\nBrewers Pride Series\n\nTexhex Brujas Brew IPA\n\nDay Quencher Session Ale\n\nOrale Mexican Style Cerveza\n\nSea Salt & Lime Summer Lager\n\nTexhex Twin Dream Double IPA\n\nHill Country Peach Wheat Ale\n\nTexhex Desert Mirage Hazy IPA\n\nOktoberfest Marzen Style Beer\n\nPride Balcones Barrel Aged Bock\n\nStraight Shooter Hard Seltzer Lemon\n\nWicked Juicy Pineapple & Coconut IPA\n\nCerveza De Verano Mexican Style Lager\n\nStraight Shooter Hard Seltzer Wild Cherry\n\nStraight Shooter Hard Seltzer Juicy Dill Pickle"
