        "text": "We love brewing our beers for all to enjoy. In recent years, we have dedicated ourselves to making the homeplaces of our brands a special experience for our fans. Our brewery and hospitality teams have worked endlessly to showcase our brands and make our fans feel a part of our family. As the culmination of that hard work, we have two exciting updates to share! After brewing in Berkeley for nearly 20 years, Trumer Brewery has unveiled a new Taproom. Located onsite at the Brewery on 4th street, the Taproom features a variety of new beer styles, brewed right on-site in our new pilot system as well as a menu inspired by our European heritage. Our family friendly and dog friendly taproom and beer garden is finally open and we can‚Äôt wait to welcome you! While Shiner Beers has been independently brewing for the last 114 years down in Shiner Texas, our Spoetzl Brewery team has worked rigorously to enhance the hospitality experience and bring our story to life. Our brewery‚Äôs new enhancements have attracted fans, friends, and families from all over and even allowed us to be named as USA Today‚Äôs #2 brewery tour in the country and #1 in Texas. Come see for yourself and enjoy the best Texas has to offer! We firmly believe it's one thing to enjoy an ice cold beer in your hands, but it's another to see what goes into making the beer. Come see us in Berkeley, CA and Shiner, TX to taste the best in the business. üçª"
