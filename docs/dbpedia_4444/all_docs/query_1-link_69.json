But in the world of craft breweries, who is king?\n\nAccording to the Brewers Association,craft breweries as a group sold approximately 9.12 million barrels of beer in 2009, compared to just over 8.5 million in 2008. The 10 largest US craft breweries account over 4.5 million barrels annually, according to the association’s annual rankings by volume. However, even some of the largest craft breweries have distribution limited only a handful of US states and are only widely available in certain regions.\n\nWith craft breweries taking off in production, it pays to know which brewers are making the most beer. Click ahead for the largest craft breweries in the US by production volume. Figures are for 2009.\n\nBy Paul ToscanoPosted 17 Sept 2010\n\n10.
