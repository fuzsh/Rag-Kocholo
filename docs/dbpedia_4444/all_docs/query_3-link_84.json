        "text": "While visiting Texas a couple of weeks back, my wife and I decided to break from family obligations in San Antonio for a day or two and go exploring. Our travels took us to the wonderful painted churches in the small towns established a century ago by immigrant Germans and Czechs. Texas wildflowers carpeted the roadside everywhere we drove.\n\nWe also stumbled across one of my many “must visit” Texas destinations: the Spoetzl Brewery.\n\nIf that name doesn’t ring a bell, perhaps its famous product will: Shiner.\n\nI have fond memories of Shiner beer. When I first started visiting my in-laws more than 20 years ago, the only thing that sustained me during those hot, dusty Texas summer days were the big shade trees of San Antonio’s River Walk and a couple (or more) tall, frosty bottles of Shiner Bock. To my young taste buds, it seemed pretty exotic – full-bodied, slightly nutty, thoroughly thirst-quenching.\n\nSo it was a thrill to round a corner in tiny Shiner, Texas, population 2,000, and see the quaint white building whose product, manufactured since 1909, had kept me from melting down so many times over the years.\n\nThe Shiner tap parlour is all spit and polish – you can see the huge brewing tanks through a window to the right as you enter – but you’d never mistake the place for one of those la-de-da Napa tasting rooms.\n\nTastings are free, and they’re generous – you get to try up to four pours that look to be about 6-8 oz. each. But don’t overstay your welcome or ask for more, pardner – they give you wooden tokens when you sidle up to the counter, and when they’re gone, you’re done. Git!\n\nA sign behind the tasting bar lays down the law, Texas style. Something tells me the locals have abused the brewery’s generosity a few too many times over the years.\n\nBut the beers themselves were wonderful. A few of our favorites:\n\n– Shiner Bock, the company’s biggest seller by far (80 percent of its total output), has been brewed pretty much the same way since 1913. It has a dark amber color but is well-balanced and not bitter or overly hoppy. 4.4 percent alcohol.\n\n– Shiner Black Bohemian Lager: Don’t let its almost jet-black color fool you: This is a schwarzbier, or bottom-fermented German-style dark lager, so it’s not nearly as heavy or filling as a stout. The color comes from imported Czech Saaz, Styrians Hops and selected malts which are roasted longer than usual, creating the distinctive dark color. Surprisingly refreshing, even in summer. 4.9 percent alcohol.\n\n– Shiner Blonde. This beer follows the original recipe that founder Kosmos Spoetzl brought with him from the old country, virtually unchanged since 1909. It’s a classic Bohemian lager that’s got a light, lemon-y finish, with a little more body than most American-style lagers. 4.4 percent alcohol.\n\nI like supporting independent brewers such as this one, which employs 66 people and is, I’m guessing, the largest employer in Shiner. There’s a folksy pride about the place that you probably don’t feel when visiting one of those cavernous mega-breweires that crank out pale, tasteless product by the ton.\n\nYou can get Shiner’s reasonably priced beers at various O.C. retailers, including BevMo and Hi-Time.\n\nBeer Fest Alert\n\nThe Orange County Beer Fest will be held this Saturday at Irvine Lake in Orange. For $40, participants get to sample 60 various domestic and international brands, as well as local craft brews.
