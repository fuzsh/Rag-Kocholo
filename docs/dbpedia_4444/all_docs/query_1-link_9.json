        "text": "Today was a special day for a few reasons, and putting those reasons together gave me and my good buddy W a chance to do something that all good Texans must do at some point:\n\nVisit the Spoetzl Brewery in Shiner, Texas. Makers of Shiner Bock and other Shiner-brand beers.\n\nW drove in his new car (Pontiac G8 GXP‚Ä¶ oooo so nice). We arrived early so we ducked off to a little restaurant in town for lunch. Very good food. I forget the name of the place, but it‚Äôs right by the train tracks in the history Green building (something like that). The lemonade was fresh squeezed and so tasty. W had one of their burgers. I had their pulled pork sliders. Mmmm‚Ä¶ good stuff.\n\nThen back to the brewery and went on the free tour. Got to see how things were done. I was surprised to find out the company is small: only 65 employees. It‚Äôs technically still a ‚Äúfamily owned/run‚Äù business, private, with a lot of employee retention; currently the longest employee has been there 42 years and that‚Äôs far from the company record (which I forgot). They have only one ‚Äúline‚Äù. One set of big brass tanks where all the beers are brewed. Of course, a great number of storage/fermentation tanks. Then just a single bottling/labeling/packaging line. With as much beer as they produce you‚Äôd think it was a bigger operation, but it‚Äôs not. Just seems to run very efficiently, but yet they don‚Äôt sacrifice for it‚Ä¶ neither in the quality of the beer, nor the quality of the employee lives. That is, they‚Äôre not running 24/7. They are closed on weekends, and the only thing that runs 24 hours is the brewing. It‚Äôs quite a nifty operation. Quite cool to see the bottling area‚Ä¶ all those bottles whirring around, lined up, ‚Äúmarching‚Äù through. Yes, everyone had the Laverne and Shirley opening credits in their head.\n\nAfter that, in the gift shop you‚Äôre given 4 wooden nickels that you can redeem for 4 samples of their beer. I kept one of them as a souvenier and traded in 3 for the Shiner Black (which is awesome), a Shiner Blonde (don‚Äôt tell my wife I like blondes!), and one of their new Shiner Smokehouse. I actually got to try the Smokehouse this past weekend and wasn‚Äôt too thrilled by the gimmick, but tasting it on tap both W and I could taste the smokiness much better. It‚Äôs not a bad beer, but honestly I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd normally drink it. I mean, if I‚Äôm already eating smokey BBQ brisket, do I really want to add more smoke to the equation? I do think its a neat beer, and I love the label, but I‚Äôm still most high on the Shiner Black and their famous Bock.\n\nWhen I first came to Texas back in 1994, one of the first things I was told about was that I had to have a Shiner Bock. Then I recall the other grad students and even some of the professors and staff, we all talked about doing a trip to the brewery to take the tour. Well, finally 15 years later I got around to it. Glad I did. Good time, and gosh if it doesn‚Äôt make me want to drink more Shiner. Not a bad thing at all. üôÇ"
