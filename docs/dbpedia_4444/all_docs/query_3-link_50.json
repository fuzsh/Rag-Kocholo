        "text": "Shiner’s Rode0 line introduces the Golden Brew, a non-alcoholic offering that promises the signature Shiner taste. This brew is described as a light and refreshing choice, characterized by crisp and malty notes harmoniously balanced with delicate esters and a subtle hop profile. Crafted to mimic the familiar flavors of Shiner, the Golden Brew stands out despite its absence of alcohol.\n\nSet for release in January, the Rode0 Golden Brew arrives at an opportune moment. This period often sees regular beer enthusiasts opting for a temporary break from alcohol, a practice popularly known as “Dry January.” This timing positions the Golden Brew as an appealing alternative for those seeking to maintain their beer experience without the alcohol.\n\nThe Golden Brew is just the beginning of Shiner’s non-alcoholic venture. It marks the first in a planned series of three distinct non-alcoholic beers. Slated for release in 2024, this series will include a red amber beer and culminate in the launch of a non-alcoholic variety pack, offering a diverse range of flavors for non-alcoholic beer aficionados.\n\nThe Spoetzl Brewery in Shiner, Texas, a small town with a population of 2,069, stands as a testament to a rich brewing legacy that has flourished since 1909. For over a century, every single drop of Shiner Beer has been meticulously crafted within the walls of this historic brewery.\n\nToday, the Spoetzl Brewery’s influence extends far beyond the small town of Shiner. Annually, it distributes over 6 million cases of its beloved Shiner beer to various states across the country, a remarkable feat for a brewery that started from such humble beginnings.\n\nThis impressive growth and enduring commitment to quality would undoubtedly fill the brewery’s founder, Kosmos Spoetzl, with immense pride. His vision and dedication have been pivotal in shaping the brewery’s success, making the Spoetzl Brewery a cherished icon in the world of beer brewing."
