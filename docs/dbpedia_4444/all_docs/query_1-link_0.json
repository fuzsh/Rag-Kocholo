        "text": "Craft brewery located in Shiner, Texas\n\nSpoetzl Brewery (originally Shiner Brewing Association) is a brewery located in Shiner, Texas, United States. It produces a diverse line of Shiner beers, including their flagship Shiner Bock, a dark lager that is now distributed throughout the US. The brewery is owned by the Gambrinus Company, a family-owned company based in San Antonio, which also owns Trumer Brewery in Berkeley, California.[1]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Spoetzl Brewery started in 1909.[2] It was originally named The Shiner Brewing Association (SBA) and was founded by German and Czech immigrants who had settled around the central Texas town of Shiner. Unable to find the type of beer they had known in their home countries, they decided to brew their own. It is the oldest independent brewery in Texas,[2] and one of the oldest independent breweries in the U.S.[3][4] The leaders of the SBA named Herman Weiss of Galveston as the company's first brewmaster.[5] Shiner beer was originally available only in the spring per the German Lent tradition (Lentenbock).[6] Bock beers have a long history of being brewed and consumed by Bavarian monks as a source of nutrition during times of fasting.[7]\n\nAs the brewery gained popularity in the area, the SBA began to look for a trained professional brewmaster. They found one in Bavarian-born Kosmos Spoetzl,[6] a onetime soldier who had trained as a brewmaster in his native Germany.[5] Part of the package that lured Spoetzl to Shiner was potential ownership of the brewery. In 1914, he co-leased it with Oswald Petzold with an option to buy in 1915,[5] which he did, giving the brewery his own name, but continuing to call the product Shiner Beer. Spoetzl had attended brewmaster's school and apprenticed for three years in Germany, worked for eight years at the Pyramids Brewery in Cairo, Egypt, and then worked in Canada. He had moved to San Antonio in search of a better climate for his health, bringing with him a family recipe for a Bavarian beer made from malted barley and hops.[5]\n\nDuring Prohibition, Spoetzl kept the brewery afloat by selling ice and making near beer.[5] 13 Texas breweries in total had to close down with Spoetzl being one of a few local breweries that stayed open.[8] Following Prohibition, Spoetzl kept things small and simple, never going more than 100 miles (160 km) for business.[5]\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the brewery's Shiner Premium Beer and Shiner Bock accounted for less than 1% of the Texas beer market. In 1983, Spoetzl produced 60,000 US beer barrels (7,000 m3) of beer; in 1990, only 36,000 US beer barrels (4,200 m3). Sales improved after Carlos Alvarez of San Antonio[9] acquired the brewery in 1989. Production grew to 100,000 US beer barrels (12,000 m3) in 1994, and over the next 10 years, production nearly tripled. The company now has 120 employees.[9] As of 2012, it is the fourth-largest craft brewery in the United States.[6]\n\nProducts\n\n[edit]\n\nSpoetzl created \"Devil Beer\" in 1987, sold to fans of the Arizona State Sun Devils.[5] The brewery also licensed the Boulder Brewery of Colorado to sell its \"Boulder Sport\" in the late '80s.[5] Spoetzl currently produces 9 Shiner beers year-round and four Shiner seasonal brews per year.[10]\n\nActive beers\n\n[edit]\n\nShiner Bruja's Brew – An IPA brewed with Amarillo hops and cactus water, it was released in 2022 under Shiner's TexHex series.\n\nShiner Desert Mirage - A hazy IPA brewed with cactus water and Strata hops, it was released in 2022 under Shiner's TexHex series.\n\nShiner Wicked Haze - A double IPA brewed with cactus water and cryogenically enhanced Idaho 7 hops, released in 2022 under Shiner's TexHex series.\n\nShiner Twin Dream - A double IPA brewed with cactus water, Idaho 7 and Citra hops, it was released in 2022 under Shiner's TexHex series.\n\nShiner Storm Caster - A juicy IPA brewed with cactus water, it was released in 2023 and is the latest in the TexHex series.\n\nShiner 1909 – A pre-prohibition lager, it was inspired by the ingredients Shiner used in 1909, their founding year, and was released in 2021 as a celebration of the brewery's 112-year anniversary.\n\nShiner Bock – Spoetzl's flagship beer,[6] it has been brewed since 1913, almost as long as the Spoetzl Brewery has been in business. Shiner Bock was considered a Lenten beer, so was only made around that season, until a few decades ago. Today, 73% of the beer made at the Spoetzl Brewery is bock beer.\n\nShiner Premium is the direct descendant of Spoetzl's earliest brew. Although Premium has carried numerous names, such as Shiner Special, Shiner Texas Special, and Shiner Blonde, the recipe has been virtually unchanged since it was first brewed in 1909. Premium was reintroduced in March 2013, featuring Shiner's famous \"Cotton Boll\" logo and distinctive gold packaging.\n\nShiner Bohemian Black Lager – Originally a limited edition Schwarzbier for the Spoetzl Brewery's 97th anniversary, it became a permanent part of the brand portfolio in late 2007.

Popular demand led the brewery to introduce it year-round in 2015. This beer uses Munich malt and Mt Hood, Citra, and Cascade hops and it is 4.01% ABV. A repackaging as of late 2018 highlights the beer as a 95-calorie offering per 12-ounce serving.\n\nShiner Órale - A Mexican-style cerveza, it was introduced in 2022.\n\nSeasonal beers\n\n[edit]\n\nHoliday Cheer – Cheer is an \"Old World Dunkelweizen\" brewed with Texas peaches and pecans.

The brew is a renamed version of Shiner Fröst, and was released as the new spring seasonal in 2011.[15]\n\nFröst – Shiner Fröst uses two-row malted barley, malted wheat, and Munich malt for a full-bodied flavor. Hallertau Tradition and Spalter select hops contribute to the aroma. Fröst has an alcohol content of 5.5% by volume, a bitterness of 25 IBU and color of 8 SRM.\n\nSmokehaus – Spoetzl's smoked Sommer beer is brewed with pale malt that has been smoked with native mesquite. Smokehaus has a 4.89 ABV and an IBU of 16.\n\nShiner FM 966 – A farmhouse-style ale brewed with Golding, Sterling, and Meridian hops, it was released as Shiner's new spring seasonal in 2013.

The centennial program developed and produced one yearly special beer in small batches. The name of each such specialty beer corresponded to the age of the brewery: Shiner 96 was the specialty beer of 2005, Shiner 97 for 2006, etc. For the first two years, Spoetzl brewed Shiner 96 and Shiner 97 only from September through mid-December. In 2007, Shiner 98 was released four months earlier – in May – while Shiner 99 (2008) entered the market another two months earlier, in March.\n\nShiner 100 had the longest run of all the anniversary beers, seeing production all year long in 2009. After each beer's specified production run has ended, that year's beer is retired. However, Shiner 97 proved to be so popular that in 2008, Spoetzl brought the beer back as Shiner Bohemian Black Lager and made it a permanent offering. The Spoetzl Brewery originally intended to conclude its centennial beer production in 2009, but decided to continue the annual program indefinitely.\n\nFor 2009, Spoetzl changed the neck label for all their beers. The labels proclaimed Spoetzl's 100th anniversary and include the tag line \"Here's to a century of independent brewing. Prosit!\"\n\nThe annual brews and their respective styles are:\n\nShiner 96 – Märzen/Oktoberfest\n\nShiner 97 – Bohemian Black Lager\n\nShiner 98 – Bavarian Style Amber\n\nShiner 99 – Munich Style Helles Lager\n\nShiner 100 Commemorator – Starkbier\n\nShiner 101 – Czech-style Pilsner\n\nShiner 102 – American Style Double Wheat Ale\n\nShiner 103 – Wild Hare Pale Ale\n\nShiner 104 – White Wing Belgian White Ale\n\nShiner 106 Birthday Beer – Chocolate Stout\n\nShiner 107 Birthday Beer – Hoppy Pilsner\n\nShiner 108 Birthday Beer – Cold-Brew Coffee Ale (a collaboration with Chameleon Cold-Brew of Austin, Texas)\n\nShiner 109 Birthday Beer – Farmhouse Rye\n\nShiner 110 – S'more Chocolate and Marshmallow Ale\n\nShiner 111 – Rerelease of Shiner 110's S'more Chocolate and Marshmallow Ale\n\nMarketing\n\n[edit]\n\nShine On is a coffee table book by Dallas author Mike Renfro, which documents the little brewery's history in photos as well as story. The book follows the brewery from 1909 to 2008. In addition to the history on the brewery, Shine On also includes the history of the town, as well as a look at some of the people responsible for making Shiner beer.\n\nWorking with their Austin-based advertising agency, McGarrah Jessee, Shiner's guerilla marketing efforts at the Austin City Limits Music Festival have consistently promoted their brand.[16] In 2010, the company created the \"Shiner Beer Local Stage\", which featured a two-day lineup of local bands performing on a custom stage constructed under two billboards near Zilker Park. In 2012, a beer garden, complete with a replica of the Spoetzl brewery facade, was added.[17]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2012, country artist Jason Aldean changed a reference to Shiner Bock a few weeks after releasing the song \"Take a Little Ride\". The original lyric, \"grab a little Shiner Bock\" was replaced with \"grab a couple Rocky Tops\" when Aldean signed a sponsorship contract with Coors Brewing Company.[18]\n\nImages\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main patron entrance is through the hospitality room and gift shop.\n\nNew brewhouse\n\nCloseup of new brew kettles\n\nA Texas historic marker was placed on the site in 1971.[5]\n\nRetired paper-thin brew kettle\n\nDetail of a Shiner van\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nTexas portal\n\nCompanies portal\n\nBeer portal"
