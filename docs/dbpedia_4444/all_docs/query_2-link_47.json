        "text": "In 1909, the German and Czech immigrants living in and around the small Texas town of Shiner decided to build a brewery. The Shiner Brewing Association produced small batches of beer for local consumption until brewmaster Kosmos Spoetzl bought the company in 1915 and increased quality as well as capacity.\n\nIn this installment of the Texas Story Project, Jimmy Mauric tells the tale of how a little brewery in nowhere Texas survived Prohibition and stiff competition to produce more than half a million barrels of beer per year and be sold in 48 out of the 50 United States. Jimmy joined the firm at the tender age of 17 and worked his way up to the position of brewmaster. He's only the sixth person to fill that role since the company was founded more than one hundred years ago.\n\nEditor's note: Editor's note: This story was produced by the Bullock Museum for the Texas Story Project. It complements the exhibition American Spirits: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition, on view September 2, 2017 to January 7, 2018.\n\nJoin 5 others and favorite this"
