        "text": "Shiner is located between San Antonio and Houston in Lavaca County, Texas. The city was founded by German and Czech emigrants, and currently has a population of a little over 2,100 residents. The now-famous Spoetzl Brewery opened over 100 years ago in 1909, brewing beer with old-world traditions and recipes for Central Texas. Even though Spoetzl has grown to become one of the largest independent craft brewers in the country, every drop of the 6 million cases of beer that is distributed across the country is still brewed in Shiner.\n\nAs the cooler weather rolls in, Shiner is rolling out two beers. The first is a new brew called Storm Caster. It is the sixth addition to the Tex Hex IPA line. The second is Shiner’s Black Lager, an iconic brew that has been around for over 15 years. It is recognized as the #1 craft dark beer of Texas.\n\nStorm Caster\n\nStorm Caster is the newest addition to Shiner’s Tex Hex IPA line. This thirst-quenching beer continues the tale of the fabled La Bruja, a mysterious and powerful sorceress with electric eyes who roams the desert. When a drought threatened to destroy her domain, La Bruja used her mystical abilities to summon the waters of West Texas to cast a mighty storm. Her arcane knowledge of alchemy and her otherworldly powers saved the region from ruin. Storm Caster is a wickedly refreshing IPA that was born from sin and forged in fire to provide relief from the relentless forces of nature.\n\nWhen we cracked open a can of Storm Caster, we awoke La Bruja, and poured a crisp, golden beer from the can. The juicy IPA was brewed with cactus water and experimental hops. It was enchantingly flavorful and remarkably refreshing. The beer wasn’t overly hoppy (35 IBU) or too fruity, so it would be suitable to drink during any season of the year. It also had an intriguing quality that made it ideal for washing down a hearty burger or some choice comfort food. With a 5.5% ABV, it was just strong enough to round the edge off a vexing day.\n\nStorm Caster is a satisfying IPA that will make you a thirst-quenching legend when you bring it to your next event.\n\nBlack Lager\n\nThis award-winning offering is a smooth Bohemian black lager that is brewed with roasted malts, Czech Saaz (a Noble hops used in Bohemian lagers and pilsners), and Styrian hops. It has a 4.9% ABV, and is also known as Shiner 97. Shiner 97 was first crafted by Spoetzl Brewery to celebrate the company’s 97th anniversary in 2006. The lager was so well received that it became a permanent offering the following year. Its dark, chic recipe makes it a fashionable choice for fall and winter months.\n\nTo be honest, when we poured Shiner’s Black Lager into a glass, it looked like a heavy, dark beer that might be a little too overwhelming for such an unseasonably warm October. Although it was best for sipping, the smooth, lighter taste surprised us. It wasn’t overly aromatic or fizzy, but it had a wonderfully rich flavor that lingered on your tongue. It was purely by chance that we were eating hot mac-and-cheese bites at the time of our tasting, but Shiner’s Black Lager paired excellently with the wintery comfort food. The warm wash of coffee flavors was invigorating while the sweet undertones of caramel were delightful.\n\nShiner’s Black Lager is obviously brewed for the chilly months, but it doesn’t clobber you with its intention. It is a friendly brew that can quickly become a cherished seasonal companion.\n\nShiner Beer is available in all 50 states and Mexico.\n\nLinks"
