        "text": "Hardship Grants\n\nLina, a human rights activist from Afghanistan, was threatened and detained by the Taliban after protesting against their repression of women’s rights. For months afterwards she lived in hiding, fearing for her and her family’s lives.\n\nPrisoners of Conscience provided Lina with an emergency grant which enabled her to flee to a neighbouring country and continue her human rights work.\n\nFamily Reunion Grants\n\nReny is an engineer and pastor from the DRC. In 2017, he reported on human rights violations by the government during a military conflict. This open reporting led him to be questioned and tortured by the Intelligence Service for over a week. Fearing for his life, Reny decided to flee alone to the UK after the ordeal.\n\nPoC awarded Reny a grant to help him bring his wife and children to the UK allowing them to rebuild their lives together.\n\nRequalification Bursaries\n\nMohamad is a solicitor from Syria who advocated for the release of those prosecuted for expressing their political views. Syrian security forces detained him for doing so, and tortured him for over a week. Mohamad was forced to escape the country after being released.\n\nAfter arriving in the UK, Mohamad was keen to rebuild his family’s life, and continue legal practice. With the help of a PoC requalification bursary grant, Mohamad completed his legal conversion studies and has managed to secure a training contract to qualify as a solicitor.\n\nJoin our Cause\n\nBy signing up, you’ll join a community of human rights champions standing up against injustice.
