        "text": "Between “A Cop Movie” and “Procession,” documentary-fiction hybrids are having a major moment, and there’s another remarkable one coming out in theatres this Wednesday: “Uppercase Print,” a Romanian film. Directed by Radu Jude, who’s best known for his fiction films (notably “Aferim!”and “Scarred Hearts”), “Uppercase Print” expands the practice of nonfiction filmmaking into ingeniously imaginative dimensions. The movie is centered on Jude’s filming of a play, which is performed in the conspicuously theatrical setting of a stage-like studio. Yet the play itself, by Gianina Cărbunariu, is a work of nonfiction, and an extraordinary, haunting one. She derives the text from the archives of Romania’s Communist-era secret police, the feared Securitate, to reconstruct a local event of grand symbolic moment that took place forty years ago in the Romanian town of Botoșani: the appearance of graffiti that demanded justice and freedom, insisted on the right to independent trade unions such as Poland then had (namely, the anti-Soviet union Solidarity), and made many other sharp but reasonable criticisms of politics and life in Romania.\n\nThis public political critique, of course, was a crime in the Soviet-satellite one-party regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu, and Cărbunariu’s play chronicles the extensive investigation that the incident sparked. The Securitate discovered that the perpetrator was a seventeen-year-old high-school student named Mugur Călinescu (played by Serban Lazarovici); he, his classmates, his family, and their acquaintances appear in Cărbunariu’s play based on the Securitate’s interviews with them—and, all the more, based on surveillance recordings of Mugur and his family that the government secretly made (by planting microphones in Mugur’s home, a story that’s integrated into the film). The details of the investigation have a hallucinatory quality, blending Kafkaesque labyrinths and Orwellian jargon, that captures the normalization of the state’s terrifying, soul-crushing machine of oppression.\n\nYet it’s that very mechanism of normalization which provides Jude with his grandest, most visionary act of fanatical archival culling: he rummages through the extant recordings of broadcasts from Romanian TV (state TV, of course—there was no other kind) from the time and intercuts the declamatory production of the play with a fascinating and enticing selection of four dozen clips. In contrast to the hyperactive and snip-crazy conventions of documentary filmmaking, he presents the clips at length, sometimes for two minutes at a time uninterrupted. Some of them show the kind of patriotic propaganda that’s the stock in trade of dictatorships everywhere: parades of young people marching in lockstep with chilling precision as a voice-over asserts their allegiance to nation and Party; mass rallies featuring fulsome praise for the dictator and his self-sacrificing devotion to the people and the nation; saccharine kitsch of postal workers delivering the adoring people’s New Year’s greetings to Ceaușescu and his wife, Elena.\n\nWhat’s most fascinating—and even more disturbing—in Jude’s selection of clips are the ones that do a remarkable job of simulating the ideals and values of an open society. Musical-variety numbers blend folkloric pop in the Lawrence Welk vein with elaborate Busby Berkeley-esque video manipulations, or feature a truly chilling call by a rock-like singer for adults to return to childhood. News reports range from the blandly cheerful (the increased production of new-model refrigerators) to the brazenly propagandist (Western Europe depicted as being in the iron grips of Nazism and awaiting a chance to invade Romania), from the trivial (the displacement of a garden by a merry-go-round) to the obliviously oppressive—notably, a sort of authoritarian “Candid Camera,” in which drivers caught honking, a crime, are secretly recorded by police officers who interrogate them on film.\n\nJude’s canny montage suggests a powerful idea: for all the distortions and deceptions practiced by the broadcasts of official Communist Party media, the propaganda of the time has an essentially documentary element. Somehow, it crucially reflects basic realities of Romania at the time—namely, the endurance of some kind of civil society and the varied range of activities, personal relationships, and initiatives (albeit circumscribed) that are an inescapable part of it. This picture of the social complexity underlying Romania’s political strictures, in turn, meshes with the story of Mugur’s secret protest and eventual capture to evoke both the complicity that any participation in that society demands and the secret flames of conscience that ultimately caught widely and brought the regime down.\n\nThe investigation that led to Mugur’s arrest has an air of satirical comedy that’s suggested in the film’s title: it involved the solicitation of vast numbers of handwriting samples from the region. What’s more, the entire case pivoted on a pre-Internet variety of the Streisand effect, in which the inscriptions, which might have simply been washed away (as they were by some minor supervisors, who eventually apologized for the oversight), grew in importance as people, seemingly terrified even to have read their contraband content, reported them to officials. It turns out that Mugur’s greatest crime, in the eyes of the state, was that he occasionally listened to Radio Free Europe. Some of his friends, under interrogation, admitted to doing so as well, but only for the music—as teens here might have admitted to reading Playboy for the articles. Mugur listened to the news and he believed it, and as a result he was accused of being an enemy of the people and of the state—even of encouraging Western countries’ military invasion.\n\nInterrogations of Mugur’s parents (they’re divorced; he lives with his mother) and friends, along with the surveillance records of their ostensibly private conversations, indicate how a regime of terror distorts even the closest personal relationships. His mother, a department-store clerk, wanted to take the blame for her son’s crime, saying that she’d been too busy, as a single mother, to properly parent him. His father merely wanted Mugur to prostrate himself with repentance and patriotic vows. His friends said whatever they could to remain untainted by their association with him. As for the Securitate agents themselves, even the transcripts available to Cărbunariu don’t make them look so menacing; their convocations and their questioning seem nearly avuncular (and I won’t spoil the upshot of their patient approach).\n\nUnfortunately, Jude and Cărbunariu, who co-wrote the screenplay, push their observations into the blatant with another dramatized sequence, labelled “Today (an image),” in which Mugur’s parents look back at the events and then Securitate agents do so, too—the latter, in a scene staged as an absurd parody of the Last Supper. Moreover, Jude’s very staging of Cărbunariu’s play is something of a misstep—its power is vitiated in the rehearsed and prepared elaboration, the colorful yet abstract sets, the distance that this production creates from the text itself. The play may have been very effective when staged in such a way in the theatre. As a movie, a simple table read in a modest context would have conveyed the documentary force of the archival secret-police texts better than décor and actorly posture. Their power comes through strongly, nonetheless. Jude, with his multiple dimensions of inquiry and imagination, poses philosophical questions about conscience and consciousness, media consumption and social order, that reach far beyond the case and era at hand to challenge the deceptions and delusions of ostensible present-day democracies."
