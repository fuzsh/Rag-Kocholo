        "text": "Do films really change the world? Do films about changing the world make any money? To the first question, the Hollywood answer is probably a shrug, but to the second, for the moment at least, it would appear to be yes.\n\nThe idea that a film could be a summons to revolution was widely believed during the 1960s, so it is appropriate that with the 1968 anniversary, agitprop is back in vogue. In Chicago 10, recently released in the United States, the director Brett Morgen has cleverly animated the trial of the Chicago Seven (the title refers to the original eight defendants and two lawyers who were imprisoned for contempt) in an effort to bring the radical historical moment to young audiences. They were accused of fomenting revolution during the ill-fated Democratic convention in Chicago in 1968.\n\nThe trial was appallingly handled (one of the defendants, Bobby Seale, was gagged in the courtroom) by judge Julius Hoffman and it gave a platform to Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin - the 'yippie' faction of the new left who believed that the world would be saved by performance art impacting on the media. In Morgen's film, you find out next to nothing about the truth of such notions, nor are you told that 1968 ended anticlimatically with the election of the left's hate figure, Richard Nixon. But the animated courtroom sequences are cleverly spliced with archive and interviews of the time and the film conveys, for the benefit of young audiences, a strong sense of the short-lived but intoxicating right-on feeling of those days.\n\nAnother fictional film on the same subject, by Steven Spielberg, with Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman, is in the works. Those seeking a larger helping of counterculture will soon be treated to biopics of Che Guevara (which premieres at Cannes next month and is directed by Steven Soderbergh) and Harvey Milk, the San Francisco gay politician who was murdered in 1978.\n\nMeanwhile, the flow of conspicuously engaged documentaries continues unchecked. Last month, Leonardo DiCaprio's eco-horror essay The 11th Hour opened. Next month is the turn of Errol Morris's SOP (Standard Operating Procedure), an account of the Abu Ghraib horrors, and Morgan Spurlock's Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden?, his story of an abortive search for the al-Qaeda terrorist leader.\n\nPoetry, Auden famously declared, makes nothing happen, but one can be almost certain that something happens, just occasionally, when we go to see films. However, many allegedly earth-shaking films merely register the changes before our eyes or appear to stretch out to us by influencing each other. Exactly how, considered individually, films leak from the screen into our lives is hard to measure and it's something I've pondered for many years while producing or commissioning feature-length documentaries for the BBC.\n\nI've often regretted the fact that factual films appear to have become the near-exclusive property of the progressive conscience because it makes for a narrowness of approach, restricting films to audiences of the long converted. Among those who make documentaries, claims are made that, like a written piece of journalism or a book, a film did have an effect and this is most of all true of some of the many films examining miscarriages of justice where someone has been sentenced to death. But documentary films tend to swim in shoals, often with the current; they seem frequently to address things once they've been aired in the written press.\n\nI've also noticed how it is no longer possible to isolate the impact of a film and how the way it is written about generates its own effect. I'm no longer even sure that documentary films affect the world in a different way from fiction or that people are interested in how fiction differs from investigation. Sitting in the dark watching documentaries, it's easy to reflect that this mixture of the real and the fake has its downside. But more people have access to the great documentaries being made at present, and I suspect that they do change lives, often dramatically.\n\n'A film can have either a very specific result or a vaguer attitudinal one,' says Nick Broomfield. 'The fact that the result isn't easily quantifiable has no bearing on the film's importance.' Early Broomfield expos√©s were directed at specific abuses. Battle for Haditha, which was shown on Channel 4 recently, is a fictionalised account of a massacre in which non-actors play the Marines involved and the Iraqi victims and insurgents. 'People say to you, \"That's what is happening in Iraq.\" Marines appreciate it because it shows what they went through. So do Iraqis,' says Broomfield. 'But you can't say, except in the most general terms of altering views about the conflict, that the film has had a tangible effect.'\n\nThe growth of film festivals in the past decade means that films such as Broomfield's can be launched rapidly all over the world. Like Sundance, begetter of all progressive docfests, London, Sheffield and Edinburgh are venues for the crusading conscience. This has led to a subtle downgrading of the TV broadcasters. 'I don't personally care so much how a film does on television,' a senior broadcasting executive told me recently. 'It's so much more interesting to see these campaigning films with an audience and the film-makers present.'\n\nMy feelings about the decoupling of documentaries and television are overwhelmingly negative, because television, though it is getting harder, is where you can still find a big audience for such work. If television channels cease to care about difficult, edgy work in Britain, how will it be funded? Not by cash-strapped, insecure movie investors, I suspect.\n\nBut the flight from television to cinema has already happened in the United States, where television has been risk-averse and entertainment-based for many years. Activist Hollywood comes squeaky clean and earnest, with a desire to save the world. 'We all owe George Bush tremendously,' says film-maker Eugene Jarecki. 'Hollywood hasn't changed fundamentally. But you can be taken seriously now - you're more than a lunchbreak item. George Bush has become a get-out-of-jail card for political film-makers.'\n\nNot long ago, I spent an afternoon in a New York hotel with Jeff Skoll, chairman of Participant Media. Born in Montreal, Skoll was eBay's first president and he has used a portion of the billions he made from online auctions to further his passion - setting the world to rights by financing at least four socially improving films each year.\n\n'We aim not to lose money on any production,' says Skoll. 'But we have become convinced that people want films that address the problems of the contemporary world responsibly, with a point of view.' Skoll has funded his own foundation (he paid for the subtitling of Richard Attenborough's Gandhi into Arabic when it was shown on the West Bank) and he funds 'social entrepreneurs' - film-makers from all over the world who want to make films about worthy subjects. But his company works like a normal business, producing mainstream films such as Syriana and Good Night, and Good Luck.\n\nParticipant Media's biggest success is An Inconvenient Truth, which cost around $1.5m and earned more than $49m in cinemas. The film won an Oscar and, most probably, a Nobel Prize for Al Gore, who is now seen not as a has-been but a green prophet. It is recommended viewing for German and British schoolchildren. Skoll explains how such apparently marginal films can make an impact on the world.\n\n'We take a blank sheet of paper,' he says. 'A film has to perform successfully in a variety of markets and media. So we just tick off how it will do - through DVD release, television, in the print coverage it receives. Movie houses are not the only place where you can influence people.'\n\nI left my meeting with Skoll impressed by so much commitment, but faintly alarmed too. You watch films in the dark and emerge blinking from the cave, your life mysteriously altered. You feel different afterwards - more alert, more informed. None the less, I have a confession to make: I do not always wish to sit among those with whom I agree. Instead, I prefer to be won over by films. If the encounter is accidental and provocative, challenging my views, I'm happiest.\n\nThis is how I watched The Sorrow and the Pity, Marcel Oph√ºls's long and perturbing documentary about the occupation of France, in a tiny cinema on Paris's Left Bank in the Seventies, where the audience hissed at the screen in anger at successive revelations. I have viewed the film many times without ever forgetting this first experience. In Belgrade, I sat through a screening of a film about the Srebrenica massacre of Bosnian Muslims perpetrated by Serbs in 1995. The audience didn't interrupt the film and appeared overwhelmed. No newspaper or magazine article could have had a similar impact.\n\nSetting out to do something uplifting with narrative, as many have pointed out, often leads to nothing but boredom. 'You should never know quite what you are getting into with a film,' says director Stephen Frears. 'And that means you can never be certain what you have got or what effect, finally, the film will have.'\n\nFrears is a doughty defender of the power of feelings in films. He believes that what people remember in films are not facts, but emotions. Good films are graphs of contemporary sensibility. As we talk, I realise that in most of the films I like best, the question of whether it altered a mood or cause has been rendered irrelevant, because some mysterious identification of life and art has long ago taken place. So I am wholly receptive when Frears begins to explain, with characteristic modesty, how he 'merely stumbled' into The Queen, a film that has done more to restore the reputation of Her Majesty than the most expensive PR campaign might have accomplished. I ask him about My Beautiful Laundrette (1985), a film that rates as political only with a very small 'p', but which, none the less, appeared to establish the reality of the new multicultural Britain. He insists that it was all a bit of an accident.\n\n'Hanif Kureishi knew about these people and he took me around. I made the film because I didn't know about any of that world. I felt there was no reason why a skinhead and an Asian shouldn't have an affair. But I never thought about the impact of the film at all.'\n\nIn Soviet culture and in Hitler's Third Reich, many films were produced with propagandist intent. The commissars assumed that audiences could be made to leave cinemas not just enlightened but politically engaged. The most hilariously inept agitprop films are, perhaps inevitably, the Eastern Bloc musicals devised as an alternative to Hollywood's offerings. Early Hollywood ventures into agitprop appear similarly stilted. The many anti-Nazi or anti-racist films funded in the 1930s and Forties were composed of 'issues' uneasily translated into the language of advertising slogans or Broadway plays.\n\nFilm critics fought long and hard to liberate American culture from the tyranny of trite, moralistic messages and no one was more effective than the late Pauline Kael, film critic at the New Yorker. 'A good movie can take you out of your dull funk and hopelessness that so often comes with slipping into a theatre,' Kael said.\n\nIn the Seventies, the diminutive, pugnacious Kael would assemble around her a group of admirers, known as 'Paulettes', each week, often at the Algonquin hotel. At one of these impromptu sessions, I asked Kael whether it was impossible to sway audiences through the medium of film. Perhaps because I was young and English, she took my question seriously.\n\n'I'm not saying it's impossible to make a film that has everybody going out of the movie house saying, \"We must do something about X\", but where are the films like that?' Asked about documentaries, however, Kael conceded that some did change the way people thought. She regretted the influence of Leni Riefenstahl while admiring her work. She, too, proved to be a near-insane fan of The Sorrow and the Pity\n\nKael wrote criticism at a time when it was still possible to regard film as the great contemporary art form. She fought hard to ensure that films such as Citizen Kane were recognised as masterpieces, but she refused to hand them over to curators, insisting that they belonged to anyone capable of entering a cinema. Almost alone among critics, she did justice to The Deer Hunter, a film reviled for its treatment of the Vietnamese and its violence. For Kael, however, seriousness remains a miraculous and rare byproduct of the more basic entertainment function of films.\n\nBut Kael's world of masterpieces ready each week for passionate examination is long gone. As David Denby, a one-time 'Paulette', now New Yorker film critic, argued recently: 'The movie culture has changed', making it hard to contemplate the 'heroic' view of films expressed by Kael. Driven by the imperatives of commerce, most movies are no more than product. Denby is no doubt right, but he appears to have underestimated the resilience of the rickety system of funding great films. No great gulf in quality separates the Oscar winners of this year from their antecedents in the Seventies - both There Will be Blood and No Country for Old Men are films that Kael would have admired for their mix of pulp and intelligence and doom-filled contemporaneity.\n\nThe same goes for the best European films. 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days tells the story of an abortion in communist-era Romania, when the procedure was insanely interdicted as a means to increase the birth rate. I suspect that Kael might also have enjoyed Persepolis, a French film version of a graphic book that wittily describes being a young woman in the fundamentalist Iran of religious bullies.\n\nMore and more, however, intelligent films are made for niche audiences. A niche of sorts, liberal and frustrated by what is offered on television, has been found in America for documentaries. It doesn't matter that the audiences are relatively small. As Alex Gibney, who made the Oscar-winning documentary Taxi to the Dark Side about American use of torture (which opens in British cinemas on 30 May), explains, these films do find the right audience. 'I heard about a special screening in Iowa attended by a bunch of retired generals,' he says. 'They wanted to know about how the US army tortured in Iraq and Afghanistan.'\n\nJarecki went on the road with his film Why We Fight, even screening it at West Point. 'There is a hunger for controversial, provocative material, non-fiction and fiction,' he says. 'It doesn't mean that anything basic has changed in the way big movies are financed and shown. But it's a hopeful development.'\n\nMeanwhile, Gibney applauds what appears to be the increasing overlap between fiction and non-fiction. 'Fiction films are more dependent on documentaries for their subject matter,' he says, 'while documentaries have successfully adopted the strong plots and characters of traditional Hollywood.' At Sundance each year, you can see how documentaries are capable of arousing passion among audiences more used to watching fiction.\n\nHowever, not all of these well-meaning efforts have been successful. Jonathan Demme's Man From Plains, a profile of Jimmy Carter (another Jeff Skoll venture), following the ex-President as he tours America promoting a book in which he criticises Israel, proved to be a flop. So too did Brian De Palma's Redacted and the dismal Lions for Lambs (starring Streep, Redford and Cruise, all to no avail). 'You have to hit the zeitgeist at the right time,' says Gibney. 'That doesn't always happen. But the audience is there when you do. It's not a big audience, but it's large enough.'\n\nMaybe a new President will prove to be a 'back-to-bed card' diminishing the interest of Hollywood in difficult, controversial material, but I somehow doubt it, because the alteration in taste appears more than fleeting and the sums are anyhow quite small. In the style pioneered by Jeff Skoll, we should perhaps start to think of films changing the world in multiple different ways.\n\nIt will no longer happen, if indeed it ever did, with a big bang. There will be more blood and more big box office, feeding the Hollywood machine. Films will still be lavishly funded and promoted. But it will be easier to reach large audiences throughout the world with small-scale offerings. Marketing styles will change; even the way films are viewed will be altered as they are shown on the internet. Indirectly, therefore, the power of films will be further enhanced. In a strange, wholly unforeseen way, something of the promise of the Sixties still holds sway: if we want the world to be shaken, we should start by watching."
