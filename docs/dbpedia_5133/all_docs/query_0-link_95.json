        "text": "I tucked the essay inside my jacket, pulled up my hood, and set out walking. My shoes and pants legs were soon soaked. Eventually, the rain let up, its patter fading like the dying away of applause after a concert, and then it ceased. I continued on through puddled streets gleaming with late afternoon light until I reached my favorite spot for brooding, a small park on a bluff overlooking the railroad yards and office towers of Providence. One of the park’s attractions for me was a giant statue of Roger Williams, gazing out over the city, his arm uplifted in benediction. The man it commemorated had fled in the 1630s from the Massachusetts Bay Colony after being threatened with imprisonment for questioning Puritan dogma, and had founded Rhode Island as a haven for others seeking freedom of conscience. I drew close to the statue, leaned against a steel fence at the edge of the bluff, and watched streetlights begin to glitter, block by block, across the city.\n\nAlone except for the imagined company of Roger Williams, Thomas Merton, and the fictional Frenchman Berenger, I listened for the inner voice that the chaplain had spoken of. What I eventually heard, as my mind cleared, were the voices of my upbringing—the words of parents and teachers, Bible verses and favorite books. But I also heard a voice that seemed to arise from a source older than my private history, deeper than my own small self. Call it conscience, call it nature, call it God. Whatever the source, it was compelling. I made my decision. I would forsake my first academic love, and turn from physics to history, philosophy, literature, or some other field that attracted no funding from the Pentagon. After graduation, if called by the Selective Service, I would volunteer for civilian work—as a tutor in an elementary school, perhaps, or an orderly in a hospital, whatever job they chose for me—but I would not wear the uniform of my nation’s armed forces, not even in a noncombat role.\n\nThe military jets that Merton heard cruising overhead signified more than preparation for war; they signified the industrial order, with its scorn for natural limits, its assault on land and sea and sky, its harnessing of technology to serve human appetites. “[P]erhaps our scientific and technological mentality makes us war-minded,” he suggested in Faith and Violence. “We believe that any end can be achieved from the moment one possesses the right instruments, the right machines, the right technique.” The hubris that has led us to devastate our home planet now prompts us to imagine we can continue our plundering and pollution by employing even more grandiose technology—by dumping powdered limestone in the oceans to counter acidification, by covering deserts and glaciers with reflective plastic sheets, by orbiting giant mirrors to reflect the sun’s rays, by mining asteroids or colonizing Mars.\n\nSoon after the 1962 publication of Silent Spring, Merton wrote in his journal: “I have been shocked at a notice of a new book by Rachel Carson on what is happening to birds as a result of the indiscriminate use of poisons. . . . Someone will say: you worry about birds. Why not worry about people? I worry about both birds and people. We are in the world and part of it, and we are destroying everything because we are destroying ourselves spiritually, morally, and in every way. It is all part of the same sickness, it all hangs together.”\n\nIn his writings from the 1960s, Merton traced this sickness to our false sense of separation from nature and our unchecked appetite for power and possessions. His diagnosis was grounded in the teachings of Jesus and the Hebrew prophets, with their stern warnings against greed and the piling up of material wealth; it drew on the Christian monastic tradition, with its devotion to poverty and simplicity; and it was informed in his later years by Asian philosophy, especially Zen Buddhism. Beginning with “Rain and the Rhinoceros,” his work has helped me understand that our ecological crisis is, at root, a spiritual crisis. We abuse and exploit Earth for the same reason we abuse and exploit one another: because we have lost a sense of kinship with our fellow human beings, with other species, and with our planetary home.\n\nMerton felt this kinship keenly. “Here I am not alien,” he wrote from his cabin in the woods. “The trees I know, the night I know, the rain I know. I close my eyes and instantly sink into the whole rainy world of which I am a part, and the world goes on with me in it, for I am not alien to it.” His experience as well as his faith convinced him that the waters and woods and fields and their myriad creatures, human and nonhuman, all arise from the same divine source. “[T]he whole world is charged with the glory of God,” he exulted in The Sign of Jonas, “and I feel fire and music in the earth under my feet.” We are sparks of that primordial fire, notes of that music, each of us, all of us, along with birds and butterflies, maples and monkeys, frogs and ferns. Whatever power gave rise to the cosmos, to life, to consciousness, still infuses and sustains all things. What we call nature is simply this grand, evolving flow, which brings each of us into existence, bears us along, and eventually reclaims us. Knowing this vividly, as Merton did, how can we desecrate Earth? How can we keep from crying out in wonder and praise?"
