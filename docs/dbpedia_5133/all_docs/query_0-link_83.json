        "text": "Introduction\n\nOver 50 years after his assassination, Malcolm X remains one of the most polarizing figures in American history. To many, he is a symbol of the enduring struggle for equal rights for all human beings; for others, his legacy is tainted by his association with the Nation of Islam (NOI) and his remarks about \"white devils\" and President Kennedy's death. Any film that does his story justice would have to be complex and controversial, and Spike Lee's eponymous 1992 film, based on The Autobiography of Malcolm X and clocking in at 202 minutes, does not disappoint.\n\nMuch like the man himself, Malcolm X has distinct phases. Through an extraordinary performance from Denzel Washington, Lee presents his subject at different points of his life, going in varying directions. The Malcolm Little we meet in early-1940s Boston is a completely different character than the Malcolm X who emerges from prison in 1952 or the el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz who dies in Harlem in 1965. But to Lee's credit, Malcolm's evolution is portrayed organically and considers how thoughtful, sensitive, and troubled the icon always was, despite how he portrayed himself to the outside world.\n\nMalcolm's Journey\n\nThe first part of the film illustrates the contradictions in Malcolm's life that were probably there for most African-American men in his era. He struts around in an almost comical zoot suit, straightens his reddish hair, and even dates a white woman; but this belies the fact that white people have terrorized him emotionally and physically for his whole life. Malcolm's outspoken preacher father was most likely murdered by white supremacists in Michigan after his family was run out of Nebraska and Wisconsin. His mother was committed to a mental institution and his siblings were scattered to foster homes. Malcolm, though he excels at school, is called \"n*gger\" so many times that he almost becomes immune to it and willingly takes his teacher's advice when he tells him that as a Black kid, he should learn to work with his hands.\n\nSo, Malcolm Little ends up working as a porter on a train, which leads him to Harlem where he falls in with gangsters and becomes addicted to cocaine. He eventually ends up in jail for burglary and the Malcolm X that we all recognize is slowly born. After enduring nightmarish beatings, solitary confinement, and drug withdrawal, he converts to the NOI with the help of a prisoner named Baines (a composite character made up for the film played by Albert Hall). Malcolm begins to see his interactions with white people in a new light, and sheds the name of the family who enslaved his ancestors. He comes to believe that \"the true nature of a white man is wickedness\" and the races should be separate. His convictions are hardened when he leaves jail after six-and-a-half years and becomes one of NOI leader Elijah Muhammad's (Al Freeman, Jr.) favorite ministers.\n\nUnder the tenets of his new religion, this Malcolm disavows drugs, alcohol, pork, and white women. He eventually marries Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett) and has six daughters. He seemingly has no time for anything fun or frivolous and single-mindedly preaches Elijah Muhammad's teachings, opening mosques across the country. Washington's Malcolm is reserved and methodical as his profile grows, but he overflows with charisma and intelligence. He advocates for a separate Black state, the right to self-defense, and viciously attacks other, more \"mainstream\" civil rights leaders (e.g. Martin Luther King, Jr.), calling them \"Uncle Toms.\" You may disagree vehemently with what Malcolm is preaching in these scenes, but you can't look away.\n\nThe narrative changes again after Malcolm X proclaims that he is \"glad\" after the assassination of John Kennedy. This is too radical for even the NOI and he is suspended from speaking publicly on behalf of the organization. Around the same time he realizes that Elijah Muhammad has had a series of affairs with his young secretaries. He breaks from the group, enraging Muhammad and the other ministers; embraces Sunni Islam; and travels to Mecca for his Hajj where he prays alongside white Muslims, people he once considered wicked.\n\nMalcolm returns to America and, with the FBI following him and the NOI plotting his downfall, it is clear he doesn't have much time left. Still, he speaks of reconciliation with white people and says, \"The true practice of Islam can destroy the cancer of racism.\" But the NOI is relentless, as the film tells it, and with his family in attendance, Malcolm is murdered by multiple assailants while on stage at the Audubon Ballroom in New York City.\n\nThe film ends on a hopeful note with a cameo from the newly free Nelson Mandela in front of a class of kids repeating Malcolm's words: \"We declare our right on this earth to be a man, to be a human being, to be given the rights of a human being . . .\" The real Malcolm, though, pointedly finishes the speech with his incendiary tagline: \"by any means necessary.\"\n\nThe Lure of Black Nationalism\n\nBehind Malcolm's fiery rhetoric before his conversion to Sunni Islam was his earnest belief that integration was dangerous for Black people in America. In prison, Baines asks Malcolm to think of all the white people he had ever known and reflect on their inherent wickedness. Out of prison, Malcolm quips, \"The only thing I like integrated is my coffee,\" but he also says this in more intellectual terms. Perhaps the most famous line from the film is, \"We didn't land on Plymouth Rock, Plymouth Rock landed on us.\" Malcolm's point is that Africans did not come willingly to the United States, so this nation can never truly be a land of opportunity for them as it is for white people. \"You're not an American; you're an African in America,\" he explains.\n\nWith injustice and brutality an everyday occurrence for Black Americans, it is easy to see the appeal of separate nations, separate businesses, separate destinies. Of course, the irony was that the Jim Crow laws had already made this somewhat of a reality in the South, with horrific outcomes for all. As Mandela would say of apartheid, the white people being sold the lie of white supremacy were oppressed ideologically alongside the physical oppression of Black people. This was something that King understood as well, realizing that the Civil Rights Movement would only be successful if progressive white people were involved in the struggle.\n\nMalcolm, though, had a different view. One scene, based on a real-life encounter, clearly illustrates the limits of separatism. On his way to a talk at a university in Boston, a young white woman approaches Malcolm and his entourage. She earnestly asks what a white person who isn't bigoted can do to further his cause. Malcolm barely even breaks his stride as he says, \"Nothing,\" leaving the woman behind, who in reality broke into tears after being brushed off. After his awakening in Mecca, though, Malcolm thought back on this encounter. \"I've lived to regret that incident,\" he said. \"Something like this kills a lot of arguments.\" It is clear that in America the races will never be separate and the conversation, however difficult, must continue on all sides.\n\nThe Cult of Personality\n\nAs a minister for the NOI, Malcolm X said indefensible things. He habitually branded an entire race as \"devils\" and said of President Kennedy's assassination that the United States would \"reap what it sows\" and that \"chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad; they've always made me glad.\" But to actor Denzel Washington's great credit, even as his Malcolm is saying these vicious words, there is always a vulnerability, or even an innocence, to him. Despite his transgressions before his prison stint, he emerged from custody a loyal and pious man, arguably to a fault. In the film, Betty had to scream and explicitly spell out the fact that his idol Elijah Muhammad had been engaged in scandalous affairs. Furthermore, Malcolm lived as he preached. FBI agents listening in to his phone calls say at one point, referencing another religious civil rights leader's well-known and exploitable infidelities, \"Compared to King, this guy's a monk.\" He also lived frugally, as Betty pointed out, while Muhammad literally sat on a throne during his rallies.\n\nStill, it can be dangerous to build up any human, even one as exceptional as Malcolm, into a living symbol. In one scene, Malcolm leads a group of NOI adherents to a hospital to support a Black man who had been beaten unconscious by the police. When he finally hears what he wants to hear, Malcolm simply lifts his hand up and the group marches away in lockstep. As a policeman says, \"That's too much power for one man to have.\"\n\nThis power is further shown with the cult of personality surrounding Elijah Muhammad. At a rally celebrating him, the mood turns cult-like as thousands of his followers chant his name as he sits on his throne. Indeed, Muhammad had been abusing his power in the worst way: impregnating his young secretaries because he believed it was his divine right. Baines attempts to explain away his leaders' sins, telling Malcolm, \"The deeds of a great man far outweigh his personal weaknesses.\"\n\nBut that was not nearly good enough for Malcolm as he soon left the NOI and never looked back. Sadly, by most accounts (there are still some who question when the NOI was fully or party to blame for his murder), this would be the one battle that he would lose completely.\n\nMalcolm in 2017\n\nWriting this less than a month after the Charlottesville rally and terrorist attack, it is tempting to look at Malcolm X's legacy in a different light and remark upon how much work America still needs to fix its racial issues. But Malcolm probably would not be at all surprised that structural racism still exists and that there has been a resurgence in outright bigotry in the last two years. While King was working, in a straight line, toward a future where Black people and white people had the same opportunities, Malcolm, as the film told it, was focused on the present and making sure his brothers and sisters had opportunities, by any means necessary.\n\nWhat is clear, after watching the film, is that el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz, Malcolm's last incarnation, would want to talk and learn in 2017. As someone who experienced hatred from all sides, he would not have been shocked by the rise of the \"alt-right.\" Instead, he would have gotten right back to work and been in Emancipation Park in Charlottesville praying for the souls of white supremacists alongside other clergy; he would be speaking to young people, on all sides, at universities; and he might even be looking for ways to engage with the president, even though Trump built his political career by embracing a racist conspiracy theory and a majority of the country has already written him off. This is a moment that calls for Malcolm's open mind and thoughtful nature, the version he settled on after decades of struggle, as a way to make sense of the hate and vitriol that has taken far too many of us by surprise.\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\n1. Was there any justification for Malcolm X calling white people \"devils\" and advocating for a separate Black state during his NOI days? How about his comments about President Kennedy?\n\n2. What did Malcolm X mean when he compared Kennedy's assassination to \"chickens coming home to roost\"?\n\n3. Knowing how Malcolm X felt in his heart at the time, what should have been his reaction to the white woman when she asked if he could help?\n\n4. Was the policeman right when he said that nobody should have as much power as Malcolm X? Was Elijah Muhammad too powerful?\n\n5. Although his words might have been offensive to many, was Malcolm X right to criticize Martin Luther King, Jr. and his approach to fighting for civil rights?\n\n6. Should we be willing to look past a leader's misdeeds if they are working towards a positive goal?\n\n7. What should the be the role of religion in civil society movements? Did Malcolm X, or even King or Gandhi, rely too much on spiritual arguments in their movements?\n\n8. Why did the young Malcolm Little want to straighten his hair to \"look white\"?\n\n9. What would Malcolm X say about President Trump and his views on race? How about the \"alt-right\"?\n\nSelected Carnegie Council Resources\n\n#Republic: Divided Democracy in the Age of Social Media Cass R.
