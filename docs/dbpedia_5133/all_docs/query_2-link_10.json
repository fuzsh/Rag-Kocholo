        "text": "Reviews\n\nFixed poses thoughtful, unsettling, compelling and complicated questions to students and educators in an engaging way. Any educator who wants to equip their students with knowledge and skills to think creatively and deeply about the issues of bioethics, justice and emerging technologies should integrate this film into their Humanities or Science curriculum.\n\nEran DeSilva\n\nDirector of Faculty Professional Development and Social Studies Teacher, Notre Dame High School\n\nFixed brilliantly places the voices of disability, queer, and critical race scholars and social justice advocates who would have us pay attention to inequality and discrimination and common humanity next to the voices of transhumanists and prosthetic and enhancement enthusiasts who believe that their work portends a desirable more than human future in a way that does justice to each position. This is exactly the kind of conversation that all of our students should be exposed to as we navigate a world of new technologies. Highly recommended for classes in Sociology, Science & Technology Studies, Anthropology, Gender and Women's Studies, and American Studies.\n\nCharis Thompson\n\nChancellor's Professor & Chair of Women's & Gender Studies at UC Berkeley\n\nFixed: The Science/Fiction of Human Enhancement is a rare combination of balance, passion, and erudition. What sets this film apart is that it gives space to both sides of an important discussion, allowing protagonists intimately involved with the consequences of contemporary technology as it relates to different bodies to have their say, while never letting go of the director's point of view. From now on, I will use Fixed in my classes. Once you see it, you will, too.\n\nKenny Fries\n\nauthor of The History of My Shoes and the Evolution of Darwin's Theory; Faculty, MFA in Creative Writing Program, Goddard College\n\nAs we bid good riddance to outdated, stigmatizing and controversial disability awareness programming such as 'disability etiquette', disability simulations, and 'cripspirational' speakers, this documentary is a breath of fresh air. Independent filmmaker Regan Brashear goes beyond the blurred lines of ability/disability, biology/technology and advantage/disadvantage to critically explore the flow above, below, and beyond the slashes of our familiar false binaries. Posing the important questions of 'Where does disability live?' and 'Who gets to decide?', the film offers input from scholars, scientists, social justice activists, creators and end-users of cutting-edge technologies and more to explore new and changing ways of being human in the world. An opportunity to transform your stale campus disability awareness programming--even better with opportunities for Q&A with director Regan Brashear!\n\nMargaret M. Camp\n\nMEd, Director of Disability Services, ADA Coordinator, USC Upstate\n\nThe film marked an absolutely pivotal moment in my own students' understanding of the stakes of enhancement, as well as disability and embodiment. We found it engaging and enchanting.\n\nTammy Berberi\n\nPresident of the Society for Disability Studies & Director of the Honors Program, University of Minnesota, Morris\n\nThis film is extremely important and will be very valuable for faculty from dozens of different disciplines from the biological sciences to disability studies to the humanities and social sciences, precisely because it confronts one of the central issues of our time: how to make sense of variations among human beings and how to make sense of our capacity for radical technological innovation that will change our entire futures.\n\nClark Miller\n\nChair, PhD Program, Human and Social Dimensions of Science and Technology, & Associate Director, Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes, ASU\n\nI screened Fixed in a disability studies-focused course I co-taught this past semester... The students absolutely loved the film; they found it compelling and complicated, and it helped transform their understandings about bodies, disability, technology, ethics, economic justice, disability rights, etc. I *highly* recommend it.\n\nJoan M. Ostrove\n\nProfessor, Department of Psychology, Macalester College\n\nFor those unfamiliar with either disability studies or enhancement, Fixed remains a highly entertaining, as well as visually and intellectually stimulating presentation, making it ideal as introductory material for classroom use. As a way of visualizing and personalizing a difficult, multi-faceted debate, it is highly recommended both to academics and the general public.\n\nDr. Stevienna de Saille\n\nUniversity of Sheffield, Journal of Responsible Innovation\n\nRead more at: tandfonline.com\n\nAwarded \"Top 10 DVD of the Year\" The thoughtful and probing Fixed: The Science/Fiction of Human Enhancement (New Day Films; Gr 9 Up) challenges viewers' ideas of what it means to be physically fit, as well as what it means to be human, by tackling head-on the assumptions of ableism. The documentary deals with the history of disability rights up to the 21st century, with bionic arms and other enhancements becoming more common. An excellent means to provoke discussion in biology and ethics classes.\n\nKent Turner\n\nSchool Library Journal\n\nRead more at: SLJ.com\n\nAn authoritative exposé on the use of technology in the quest for physical perfection.\n\nFariba Houman\n\nDirector, Human Research Protections Program, Mass. Eye and Ear Hospital\n\n***1/2; stars, Video Librarian: \"Filmmaker Regan Brashear's remarkable documentary focuses on the intersection of disability and science. We often hear about various achievements in helping people with disabilities through prosthetics, brain implants, eye implants, and drug therapies, but Fixed argues that the real cutting edge in these fields is not approximating normalcy but rather in extending human capability. State-of-the-art leg prosthetics, for example, can make someone stronger and faster, while bionic arms with robotic capabilities can do more than human arms. Memory can also be enhanced, while computers can be controlled by a person's thoughts. Fixed introduces viewers to the world of the extra-abled, or trans-humans, along the way exploring some of the ethical and philosophical quandaries that are accompanying progress. While various advocates for human enhancement are interviewed here, there are equally strong points-of-view that there is nothing wrong with accepting a disability and living with it. Others foresee a time when a rat race for extra-abilities overtakes more traditional advocacy for issues such as access to buildings. Still others anticipate a wide range of people pursuing extra-abilities in order to get an edge on the job or in school. Debates will carry on, but Fixed offers a powerful introduction to this provocative subject. Highly recommended.\"\n\nT. Keogh\n\nVideo Librarian\n\nAn ethical and philosophical mind-bender...\n\nCPH:DOX Copenhagen International Documentary FIlm Festival\n\nCPH:DOX Copenhagen International Documentary FIlm Festival\n\nAccessible, balanced…there is something entirely new here to help students stretch their thinking. It is perfect for the classroom.\n\nStacey Wickware\n\nU.S. History and Medical Ethics teacher, Dozier-Libbey Medical High School\n\nFascinating, humane, and provocative reframing of conceptions of 'normal' bodies and 'disability.\n\nGina Maranto\n\nProfessor, Ecosystem and Science Policy, University of Miami\n\nGr 9 Up--The tone is set from the opening sequence, as a woman in a wheelchair in scuba diving gear navigates gently through an underwater reef, her hair and the air bubbles trailing hypnotically upward. Fixed explores the science and ethics of enhancements, from therapeutic restorations that allow a father to kick a ball with his children, a paralyzed man to mentally direct a robotic arm to hold his partner's hand, to the benefits anticipated by transhumanists, who embrace technology to extend mental and physical abilities beyond what is today defined as normal. The men and women interviewed are thoughtful, deeply committed, and well spoken as they present their points of view.... The film addresses the economic aspects of who benefits from enhancement technology, the issues arising when parents can select genetic traits in offspring, and the degree to which society is responsible for designing a world that's accessible for everyone. (The film incorporates lilting dance segments by artists of with a variety of mental and physical differences.) In a non-judgmental way, it touches upon many thoughtful questions germane to almost any subject, and would be particularly well suited to classes in biology, robotics, ethics, counseling, and leadership. Director Regan Pretlow Brashear gives viewers much to consider and discuss.\n\nMaggie Knapp\n\nSchool Library Journal\n\nRead more at: SLJ.com\n\nOur class focuses on the ethical dimensions of new biotechnologies and the ways these biotechnologies are challenging our established ideas of what it means to be human. Fixed was, clearly, a perfect fit. What I—and I think my students—found most valuable about the film was its introduction of the perspectives of disabled individuals. Disability is too often overlooked in the grandiose discussions of human enhancement. Fixed provided my students with new, critical approaches for questioning what normal means and what aspirations drive our desire to be super-human. Moreover, it did so in a way that really opened up the conversation and invited them to identify with this new perspective as one very valid perspective among diverse others. Because they weren't being told what to think, they were far more willing to re-evaluate their own assumptions.... Having Regan join our class discussion was an excellent precursor to my students seeing the film. Regan was able to lay out the key questions of the film in ways that helped them to begin their own processes of self-inquiry before the film continued that important work. Regan brought the key figures in the film to life for my students, helping them to appreciate the unique backgrounds that have contributed to their diverse perspectives. The students were also fascinated by the filmmaking process itself and Regan's own story of bringing the film into being. Having these insights made my students even more open to, and invested in, the film and its message.\n\nErin Gentry Lamb\n\nDirector, Center for Literature and Medicine, Hiram College"
