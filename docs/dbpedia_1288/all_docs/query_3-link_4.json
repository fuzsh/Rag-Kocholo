        "text": "Zouzou feels like a French version of a pre-code Hollywood film, though I don’t believe French filmmakers ever had the equivalent of the Hays Code inflicted upon them. It has bawdy dialogue, scantily clad women, a silly plot, and an alluring star in Josephine Baker. Of course, the fact that Baker was an African-American and simply allowed to be a leading lady, without a lot made over her skin color, is something that was unthinkable in America at the time. There are a couple of other things you wouldn’t see in an American film; the F bomb is dropped in one scene, and there are a couple of instances of near toplessness. The film is light in tone and rather…\n\nJosephine Baker was a star like no other. She grew up poor in St. Louis and moved to New York at the height of the Harlem Renaissance when she was only 13 years old. Through incredible determination and drive, she achieved some early success in the chorus lines of “Black-cast” musical revues in the United States, but it wasn’t until she emigrated to Paris in 1925 that her career took flight. By 1926, she was the main attraction at the Folies Bergère. Hobnobbing with the likes of Hemingway, Picasso and Jean Cocteau during the heyday of Parisian Café Society, she vaulted into international stardom over the next few years. And her story only gets more interesting from there.\n\nWhen considering…\n\nBogged down by bad directing and a very convoluted plot. Gabin and Baker are great, and as a backstage musical showcasing Baker's charisma and talent, this should work. The first hour is fun and breezy, with Josephine Baker's delightful manic pixie dream girl giving even Audrey Hepburn a run for her money. Baker isn't trying to be the film's scene stealer, but every time she's on screen she's too radiant to look away from. Gabin is still perfecting his romancing charms but they make for a fun team. The last act is just such a mess! The musical numbers, clearly inspired by Busby Berkeley, are so utterly mediocre, both due to direction and poorly prepared dancers. Baker is great in…\n\nThe film follows the life story of a young black woman from her childhood in a circus to adult success in the musical theater.\n\nZouzou, a black girl, and Jean, a white boy, are displayed as twins in the side show of a circus. As adults Zouzou (Josephine Baker) and Jean (Jean Gabin) still regard themselves as sister and brother. Jean is a seaman, and Zouzou works in a laundry. Zouzou loves to sing and dance for her friends at the laundry but has no thought of a theatrical career. After Jean is arrested for murder, Zouzou needs money for his defense. At a theater, she displays her singing and dancing talents to the impresario who immediately hires her. Her…"
