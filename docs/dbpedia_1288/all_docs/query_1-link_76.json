        "text": "Spring is in the air, and French fashion chains and Princesse Tam Tam are lightening up their outfits, and their retail prices. the women's ready-to-wear and lingerie markets are slumping (they lost 1.5% and 3.8% respectively in 2023, according to the French Fashion Institute), and the two brands owned by Japanese group have decided to cut prices in an attempt to revitalise their business, after undergoing a reorganisation in 2023. A more affordable strategy designed to tap a wider clientèle, as Kunii, named president of the two chains in 2019, has told .\n\nIn 2024, 40% of apparel brands in France are planning to raise retail prices by up to 5%. The strategy that Comptoir des Cotonniers and Princess Tam Tam are instead gradually implementing is to cut prices by as much as 30% on average, said Kunii.\n\nWomenswear chain Comptoir des Cotonniers was founded in France in 1995, and was acquired by the Fast Retailing group in 2005. The brand is aiming to retain its casual Parisian style but has set itself new price ceilings: all its items will stay below the €100 mark, except for the more voluminous ones, whose maximum price is set at €200. At Princesse Tam Tam, no underwear or loungewear item will be priced above €50. The brand is still currently selling bras priced at €59 on its e-shop, but it is also introducing new models at €49.\n\n“The rising cost of living and related decline in purchasing power has made us reconsider our brands’ positioning on the European market,” said Kunii. “[…] It is in our brands’ DNA to offer excellent quality at the right price. The current economic situation has prompted us to emphasise this feature,” he added.\n\nAttracting 25 to 35-year-olds\n\nBoth chains are aiming to give their existing customers “a wonderful surprise” with their new prices, while also attracting new followers. “In March, we launched a digital video campaign for each brand that will run for six months, and will continue with the winter collections,” said Kunii. The campaign was released on the brands’ e-shops and social media, as well as in-store. The goal was “to let it be known as soon as possible” that the brands are deploying a new pricing policy. Kunii is hoping that store footfall will increase, especially by attracting new customers in the 25 to 35-year-old segment.\n\nKunii was close-mouthed about the elements the brands are leveraging to lower prices, simply saying that “manufacturing optimisation” is on the agenda. “We will benefit from ’s supply chain and know-how, while sticking to the same design quality we like to offer,” he said.\n\nIf Comptoir des Cotonniers and Princess Tam Tam wish to reach revenue levels similar to those prior to the reorganisation, they will have to sell many more units at the new, lower prices. Fast Retailing’s recent financial reports did not include detailed revenue results for the two brands. In the latest report, for Q1 2023-24, the group indicated that Comptoir des Cotonniers experienced a “decrease in revenue” while at the same time “reducing losses.”\n\nIn May 2023, the two brands introduced a cost-cutting plan, as they were “faced with serious difficulties.” For Comptoir des Cotonniers, the plan involved closing down 28 of its 67 stores, and cutting 101 out of 272 jobs. While Princesse Tam Tam planned to close 27 of its 69 stores, and cut 84 of 235 jobs. The operation is still in progress, and it came two years after a first restructuring effort was carried out in 2021.\n\nComplementary collections with Uniqlo\n\nComptoir des Cotonniers and Princess Tam Tam are sharing good practices with Uniqlo also in terms of capsule collections, a strategy they first deployed last year. For Spring/Summer 2024, both brands are launching 10-item capsule collections developed in collaboration with Uniqlo. The objective is “to commercialise via Uniqlo collections that are complementary to our brands, featuring basic essentials that integrate our range at very attractive prices,” said Kunii. It is also a way of “expanding” the reach of both brands worldwide, as these collaborations are sold in Uniqlo stores across more than 26 countries."
