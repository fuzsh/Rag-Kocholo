La Sirene des Tropiques (1927) was co-directed by Henri Etievant and Mario Nalpas, with the help of assistant director Luis Bunel. The silent film tells the story of an innocent girl from the tropics who does the Charleston and eventually brings the dance to Paris. Based upon an idea suggested by her manager and lover Giuseppe \"Pepito\" Abatino, who also costarred, the production was considered by most critics nothing more than a curiosity even upon its release. (1) Many involved with the film, such as Bunel, characterized the finished product as a joke exemplified by tasteless moments featuring the star falling into a flour bin, thus becoming \"white,\" and later suggestively bathing herself to restore her color. Baker found the entire experience humiliating, stating that the \"'film brought tears to my eyes. Was that ugly, silly person me?'\" (Rose 120). When she once again ventured before the cameras in the 1930s, Baker and Abatino made certain that her first sound production reflected a star persona that the famous dancer could comfortably embrace. Of all her motion picture appearances, Marc Allegret's Zouzou (1934) became Baker's personal favorite. During its production, she said, \"'The film enchants me.... Everything seems easy, because I feel the story so very strongly. It all seems so real, so true, that I sometimes think it's my own life being played out on the sets'\" (Wood 182).\n\nSuch sentiments seem more than just groundless publicity since the film contains a plot purposely reflecting Baker's personality and life story. Zouzou (Baker), a Creole laundress, grows up in the circus along with her foster brother Jean (Jean Cabin). She yearns for stardom onstage and longs for the love of Jean, whom she eventually saves from a false murder charge. Despite her inevitable rise to stardom as a revue singer, Zouzou is left heartbroken as Jean falls in love with her white best friend Claire (Germaine Aussey). The story, based on an idea by Abatino, was tailored for Baker's talents and stage persona. Oddly enough, much of this storyline's construction with its \"rags-to-riches\" dynamic heavily resembles American musicals, especially the backstage musicals popular at Warner Bros. during the period. Baker's love of the production as a reflection of herself, something definitely not the case with La Sirene, exemplifies Zouzou's position as a star vehicle of a distinctive sort. Typical of many French motion pictures of the early 1930s, the film basically was independently produced, with Arys Nissotti, a Tunisian casino owner, funding the majority of the production. Most likely, Abatino and his client also invested in the film--which, along with its follow-up Princess Tam Tam (1935), showcases specifically how they wished Baker to be seen onscreen. The production intends to redefine how the famous dancer and singer would transition into motion pictures, thus specifying her persona for future star vehicles by correcting the mistakes of La Sirene.\n\nRecent critical responses to Zouzou often focus on the text as an illustration of complex colonial, social, and communal issues prevalent within Paris during the early 1930s. Elizabeth Ezra sees the film as a reflection of a Parisian society in flux between traditional and new communities. By questioning French national identity through multiple presentations of exhibition and theater, the venues depicted in the film establish how \"traditional structures of community were being threatened by both the right and left; between the right-wing leagues and the Popular Front.\" She ties this concept to how cinema was rapidly refashioning \"new representations of community as well as new communities of spectators\" that ultimately \"played into the debate of national identity, eliciting some hostile reactions that fed into a more general nostalgia for a community perceived to be on the wane. This nostalgia is at the heart of Zouzou\" (Colonial 102). (2) Dina Sherzer's reading also considers the film as primarily an exploration of the boundaries of national identity. She views the motion picture as a rather conservative plea for nationalism--primarily a colonialist commentary against miscegenation, something appearing in the rejection of Zouzou as love interest and the pairing of Jean and Claire as a racially \"pure\" and \"'natural' match\" (233). Kelley Conway, with her examination of the film in a book-length study of French revue stars, sees it as a showcase for Baker as a distinctly French \"grande dame du musichall\" (139). While French national identity certainly plays a part in Zouzou, what many of these responses overlook are the complexities involved when examining the text as a transnationally-influenced star vehicle. The sometimes contradictory American and French influences at play within the film must drastically redetermine how we approach its complicated views of race and miscegenation.\n\nZouzou proves fascinating not only by illustrating the ethnic and social boundaries of 1930s Paris, but by forcing us to reconsider of the star vehicle as a filmic construct. The production's expressed reason for being is to showcase Baker, thereby it exists primarily as a version of, to use the phrasing of Patrick McGilligan, \"actor as auteur.\" (3) Despite significantly being an Allegret production, the intention behind the film remains to showcase Baker above story, locale, and, to a lesser extent, even the musical sequences where the star fails to appear. Yet this distinction does not simply designate the text as a theatrical type of showcase cinema, though it does bare some resemblances to other early sound productions heavily influenced by variety and music stage shows. Instead, by examining 1930s French attitudes toward race within an often American-influenced musical style, the film poses a problematic question. How do we reconcile popular conceptions of \"star\"--often heavily motivated by the films produced through the American star system--within a text distinctly French in its presentations of race and nationality? To consider this problem, the significant casting choice of Baker's male costar must also be examined as contributing to this confrontation between the racial and the national. Zouzou casts French leading man Jean Gabin opposite of Baker in the key role of Jean, the object of the lead character's romantic preoccupation. Gabin remained just one year away from making La Bandera (1935), which progressed him toward exemplifying the role of \"flawed populist hero\" in the French cinema of the 1930s. Despite preceding some of the actor's more famous appearances in such films as Pepe Le Moko (1937) and La Grande illusion (1937), his presence in Zouzou still acknowledges a persona of a French \"every-man\" by casting him within a workingman role projecting \"charming ordinariness\" that serves to counter his costar's appealing otherness.\n\nBy showcasing Baker and, to a lesser extent, Gabin within a musical heavily resembling American productions, the film exists as a transnationally-influenced star vehicle that bases its construction in racially distinctive boundaries. These social perimeters also determine how the text reconfigures the star vehicle as a construct through transcending the popular definitions based in American systems. In what follows, I will examine how this reconfiguration emerges in the shifting stylistics of the production between Americanized musical and a poetic realist French style of filmmaking. These fluctuations provide a complex web of Hollywood, French revue, and realist performances showcased in both musical and dramatic styles. Emerging from a distinctly French gaze upon the racial Other, Zouzou provides a surprisingly empathetic, yet ultimately problematic, attempt at reconciling a possible miscegenation within its star paring. As a result, while the film presents the \"actor as auteur,\" it shows how such a production changes its dynamics through an overwhelming transnational and racial influence found within the personas of the stars themselves.\n\nACCESSING THE FRENCH MOVIE STAR BEYOND AMERICAN DEFINITIONS\n\nBefore examining a text like Zouzou as a musical star vehicle, we must recognize that the theoretical discourse of the star defines itself heavily in American performers. This distinction especially appears in the early serious critical work on movie stars. Edgar Morin's 1960 book The Stars discusses these figures in various social roles as living and dead icons, economic products, and objects of lust. Like other French critics of the period, Morin particularly idolizes the American star system and does not make much distinction between the seductive powers of James Dean, Charlie Chaplin, or Marilyn Monroe in comparison to Jean Gabin or Brigitte Bardot. Proceeding generations also theorized the star primarily as an American construct. Richard Dyer's Stars bases the majority of its examples in American film, closely analyzing multiple popular figures as social phenomena, cinematic images, and signs. James Naremore's Acting in the Cinema gives close readings of seven specific star performances in individual films, all American productions. Such a theoretical slant toward one country would normally seem biased when considering most other aspects of the cinematic text. But this particular distinction has significant historical merit since the early construction of the star system exists primarily as an American creation founded on economic need.\n\nRichard DeCordova confirms this assessment in Picture Personalities, his study of the emergence of this figure through productions made between 1907 and the early 1920s. Significantly, DeCordova also approaches the star not simply as an Americanized economic force, but something ultimately more complex. When discussing the problematic relationships between individualizing and systemizing the star, he writes:\n\nIt is not surprising that the star system seems much more amorphous and indistinct than its product, the individual star. The star system is made up of both discursive practices and economic practices.... The star could become the point of economic exchange only by virtue of its identity as constructed in discourse. Thus ... the star simultaneously changed the status of film as discourse and commodity. (11)\n\nThis observation proves crucial to understanding how discussion of the star can both exist in and transcend its historical roots as an Americanized commercial construct. While the figure's place as an economic identity might base itself heavily in the American star system and its commercial influence in other countries, the star as a social force can shape a film's discourse through various specifications particular to non-American cultures. This distinction heavily characterizes a film like Zouzou, which ultimately commodifies its stars in a manner unknown to the American productions of Hollywood's Golden Age--distinctions I will later illustrate as being racially-determined.\n\nWhile understanding that there are many French film stars, Ginette Vincendeau poses the question if there is actually a \"French star system.\" His answer consists of two parts that correspond with the distinctions specified by DeCordova in that it allows for a discourse of stardom to exist outside the American industry. Vincendeau writes that the 'French Star System' does not exist \"if by this is meant the highly ordered management of stars developed by the American studios in the classical period or the Rank stable of British stars and starlets of the 1950s.\" Despite this rejection of heavily structured systems, he stresses how the importance of the French film performer should never be underestimated. A star system of sorts still appears \"in the sense that stars are crucial to the economy of French cinema: most mainstream films feature stars who in turn organize its narrative hierarchy and publicity\" (1). The significance of this figure in early sound cinema proves especially important when considering the nature of 1930s French production, which greatly differs from the powerful Hollywood studio system. The French film industry of this period favored performers in that it differed in design from Hollywood, where a few major studios concentrated the stars, money, and power--in that particular order. (4) Instead, numerous smaller production companies existed in France, an atmosphere that allowed performers such as Baker to create personal showcases in a less exploited atmosphere. Often, these companies simply produced one or two productions, essentially resembling American independent films with specific financial backers--as seen with Nissotti's financing of Zouzou.\n\nIf the French system contains a different manner of economic practice than America, which popularly defines the idea of \"star,\" does this distinction create a different type of star? To consider this question, we must understand what a star vehicle particularly consists of as a cinematic construct. Naremore describes this type of cinema as attempting \"to foster a harmonious and undisturbing relationship between the three ways an actor may be regarded by audiences: as subject in the culture, as professional thespian, and as literary character\" (192). Of course, these three forces do not always successfully coexist especially in films heavily concentrating upon creating theatrical venues for performers--something prevalent with the technological innovation of sound in early 1930s French cinema. As Dudley Andrew summarizes, sound created an enthusiasm in the film-going public in \"its ability to present notable acts and actors to a populace that either was in the habit of diverting itself at vaudeville and music hall houses or wished to be able to do so\" (118). This stage aesthetic could even influence moments in the most sophisticated of productions, such as the displays of music hall performer Julien Carette's theatrics in Jean Renoir's La Grande illusion, Le Bete humaine (1939), and La Regle du jeu (1939). (5) Such cinema succeeded to develop a dichotomy within the types of performers. As Vincendeau outlines, \"two strands of stage spectacle-comic, singing, and more proletarian on the one hand and culturally respectable on the other ... continued throughout the history of French cinema and shaped film genres as well as performance styles\" (5). In this first category of stage spectacle, the star vehicle heavily showcases a persona created off-screen--or, in Naremore's words, favoring the figure as a \"subject in the culture\" (192). This aspect of the persona overshadows the literary character or even the actor's abilities as a thespian. Therefore, the subject him or herself can change the dynamics of the text. With Zouzou, the French star vehicle as a discursive practice becomes more of a concern through the heavily nationalistic approach to the issues surrounding the showcasing of Baker. In this manner, such a film can alter the definition of \"star\" developed within America, which, in turn, creates a star vehicle construct specific to early 1930s France.\n\nCONSIDERING BAKER AS SHOWCASED STAR\n\nTo understand Zouzou as a star vehicle, we must first examine Josephine Baker as a subject within French culture as it pertains to the formation of the film's lead character. Dyer writes how filmmakers often employ the star image \"in the construction of a character in a film.\" This design proves powerful since \"audience foreknowledge, the star's name and her/his appearance (including the sound of her/his voice and dress styles associated with him/her) all already signify that condensation of attitudes and values which is the star's image\" (126). With Baker, these elements of her filmic persona, mostly developed offscreen, derive from her history on the French stage beginning with her debut in 1925 at La Theatre des Champs-Elysees in La Revue negre. Much of the popularity of Baker's 1920s stage work appears within an era of postwar French negrophilism, a time often celebrated for its tolerance toward black performers. Many of these artists were African American writers, painters, and jazz musicians enjoying a freedom unknown to them in their home country. Yet the true dynamics of this period of French history proves considerably more complex, as illustrated by the critical responses to La Revue nEgre's performances. Andre Levison wrote of the show in 1925:\n\nThere seemed to emanate from her [Baker's] violently shuddering body, her bold dislocations, her springing movements, a gushing stream of rhythm.... In the short pas de deux of the savages, which came at the finale of the Revue Negre there was a wild splendor and magnificent animality. Certain of Miss Baker's poses, back arched, haunches protruding, arms entwined and uplifted in a phallic symbol, had the compelling potency of the finest examples of Negro sculpture. (quoted in Kear 53-4).\n\nAs illustrated by such accounts, a romanticization of \"the primitive\" as a figure often defined much of Baker's initial appeal. This concept certainly materializes throughout the artwork and promotion affiliated with her stage performances, where everything from programs to Paul Colin's famous lithographs inspired by La Revue negre highlight distinctive primitive imagery and stereotypical caricatures. As Bert A. BerlIner stresses about the negrophilia movement in general, while many black performers gained more celebrity, the popular figure of the exotic black was often still viewed as a primitive other. Also, born out of colonial myth, there existed \"another more powerful and prevalent French narrative of the negre in the 1920s. It was of the grotesque, primitive, even derisively savage black other\" (236). In essence, representations of blackness could still demean, as seen within many of the even more so caricatured and exploitive performances less frequented by the bourgeoises found in the audiences of La Revue negre. In contrast to this harsher racial fascination, Baker's show with its nudity and wild dances appealed to a sexualized fantasy of blackness, one that eroticized the idealized Modernist concept of primitivism, something certainly evident in Levison's assessment of Baker's appeal. As Berliner summarizes, the image of the exotic negre \"seemed to offer to increasing numbers of Frenchmen a source for renewal and a means for celebrating life and sexuality\" (206). (6)\n\nWhile Baker became grande dame du musichall through an initial appeal to such a fascination toward erotic primitivism, she secured this position through a self-aware redefinition of this popular persona. Kelley Conway provides two distinct categories of the stage-established singer in French cinema: a revue star (epitomizing class mobility and glamour) and a realist singer (expressing the tragic lives in the marginal landscapes of Paris). Baker's role on the stage complicates itself because she initially appealed to a fantasy of exotic otherness that embraced blackness, primitivism, and an animalistic sexuality--an image that at first appears irreconcilable with Conway's distinctions. Yet during the late 1920s and early 30s, she increasingly appeared more as a glamorous parisienne--something more akin to Conway's classification of the revue star. This identification grew throughout the remainder of her career, as international acclaim continued and the primitivism of her past image faded away. Conway explains this development:\n\nBaker utilized the intertext of her own life to construct an appealing star image that dovetailed with French fantasies of social transcendence and exotic \"otherness.\" First, she incarnated the poor girl from the slums of St. Louis who astounded Paris at the Revue negre. Next, in the late 1920s, she metamorphosed from the girl in the banana skirt to the grande dame du musichall. Elegant, French-speaking, and in possession of a trained singing voice, she became the glamorous parisienne heading up revues at the Folies-Bergere and the Casino de Paris. (139)\n\nFor Zouzou, she created a persona that incorporated multiple facets of the public's fascination toward her, thus employing elements of the revue star, realist singer, and exotic black Other in defining her persona. As illustrated by her negative reaction to La Sirene des Tropiques, Baker keenly understood the complexity surrounding the development of her image. Upon writing the screenplay for Zouzou, Carlo Rim visited Baker at Le Beau Chine to capture her essence, something reflected in some of the story's inclusions of biographical elements such as her laundress position her actual mother's job--and the adoration of her stage persona by the French. Upon these visits, Baker informed him that she did not want to dance nude anymore, something tastelessly highlighted in her silent film debut yet, for much of the 1920s, defined her onstage persona. (7)\n\nRim's \"rags to riches\" storyline (or, more specific to Baker's image, \"'primitive' to parisienne') allows for varied aspects of her persona to emerge. For example, Zouzou's first actual onstage appearance appeals to her perceived exotic otherness, yet less so than found in La Sirene. While delivering laundry to the music hall, Zouzou cavorts backstage along with some friendly chorus girls, who dress her in a skimpy and sparkly costume. When she runs to show her outfit to Jean, who works as an electrician for the theater, he asks her to stand onstage so he can adjust the floodlights. She does so as Jean informs her, \"Don't worry. The curtain is down.\" Zouzou turns and notices her large projected shadow, a silhouette that nearly appears of a nude body since Baker's costume is so skintight. During this lighting test, the orchestra also rehearses its jazz music, which results in Zouzou quickly performing a wild dance that contorts her body into various shapes--including standard Baker moves such as comically stretching her neck out in the fashion of a bird and, at one point, impressively bending her body to walk on her hands and feet. Projected on the wall behind her, her shadow resembles exotic animal-like formations. Jean and a stagehand jokingly raise the curtain, which puts Zouzou's theatrics into the full view of the theater. Once under the still-unnoticed gaze of various male onlookers (the orchestra, the producer, and the backer), she now dances even more frantically. She kicks her legs, rhythmically flings her arms before her, and does the Charleston--during which the camera significantly focuses upon her silhouette, sometimes even filling the frame with it as Baker dances offscreen. Suddenly, Zouzou notices that the curtain has risen, reacts with a shocked response to her onlookers (situated off-camera in the position of the viewer), and runs offstage in fear. As Conway suggests, the highlighting of a large black \"nude\" shadow could illustrate \"an extreme, potentially dehumanizing abstraction of a black woman\" under the gaze of white males--\"a literal enactment of the mechanism explored fruitfully by feminist film theory\" (142). (8)\n\nThe framing of the sequence with its frequent foci upon the shadow in animalistic poses does suggest some of the distressing \"primitive\" aspects of jazz-era negrophilism. Something important to consider while admitting the feminist connotations of the scene (where a white male gaze literally becomes inflicted upon Zouzou) is how aggressively it also imposes a commentary upon this enactment. Through an explicit equivalency between Baker's body (illustrated through a \"nude\" black shadow) and jungle animals, the entire scene harkens back to the now-rejected stage persona highlighting nude dancing. But now the \"nudity\" only appears in the form of a misleading shadow. Thus, the dance negotiates between both an appeal to her previous exotic positioning as sexualized black Other and an ironic commentary about performing that role under the white male gaze. The sequence displays the playfulness of a star examining her popular appeal as it sits in flux, using the construct of the star vehicle to mock her previous position as exotic body.\n\nOutside of this sequence, Baker distances herself from such sexualized wild dances in Zouzou. In a scene that counters the shadow dance, the film presents another important musical number which again provides an ironic commentary on the white male gaze. Further along in the narrative, Zouzou performs as the star of the theater's ritzy musical show. The number begins with a collection of white men dressed stylishly in tuxedos awaiting Baker, whose entrance is met with this male chorus excitedly gathering around her. As opposed to the skimpy skintight outfit of the shadow dance, she now dresses in a glamourous gown adorned with sparkling sleeves and (never completely abandoning the animal motif) a heavily feathered neckline. She also wears ornate jewels from her ears and even a tiara. Now, the white male gaze seems in her control, since it materializes as a supporting chorus corresponding with her every move. As she begins signing \"C'est Lui,\" they encircle and look upon her in a type of awe. Unlike the shadow dance, which focuses upon an abstracted and sexualized silhouette, the frame centralizes the now glamorized star in the flesh. As she walks down a long white staircase lined with even more glaring white males, the camera follows her. Later, the men sway in unison behind her, yet never divert their eyes from Baker as she moves across the stage. While she sings of her one true love in Paris (a possible reference to Jean), Zouzou laments \"I'd crawl through a mouse hole for him. Each day I adore him more.\" Here, the white male chorus adjusts their bow ties in hopes of being that individual. In essence, this sequence rearranges the components of the shadow dance, with the representational male gaze of the dancers idolizing Baker through the different criteria of a glamorous revue star--where race still remains a factor of her appeal, but significantly less so. As Conway writes, \"her [Zouzou's] star appearance in the music hall revue evokes the 'real' 1930s Baker: the elegant meneuse de revue who has conquered Paris\" (143). As such sequences display, the film ultimately illustrates a progression of Baker's career. Despite this attempt, her changes in image do not disregard the racial dynamics of her persona. One of the most striking visual components of the staircase sequence remains the intense gaze of the white male chorus. Throughout the number, white men in black coats basically engulf Baker. Despite her control over the gazers' movements, her racial and sexual difference still manages to be an obvious point of fascination for the chorus and the camera. An elegant sheen has been added, but this gloss does not completely discount her persona as an exotic racial Other.\n\nThis complexity of image challenges how we place Baker into the position of \"star\" in a traditional cinematic sense. To once again refer to Naremore's terminology, Zouzou remains a vehicle heavily favoring Baker as a \"subject in the culture'--a figure defined by a fame established through a stage career as opposed to previous film roles (192). In Stars, Dyer explores and counters some of the popular perceptions of star/audience relations partly through examining a model created by Andrew Tudor. Here, four classifications emerge in defining how an audience responds to popular movie stars: emotional affinity, self-identification, imitation, and projection. (9) Dyer recognizes the following through examining this model:\n\nWhat is clear from this account of the star/audience relationship is that the audience's role in shaping the star phenomenon is very limited. That is, the account tells us what audiences do with the star image that they are offered and hence indicates the sources of the success of stardom, but it does not tell us why the offered images take the form they do. (18)\n\nDyer's observation proves especially significant when considering the placement of Baker into the role of movie star. Possibly, her lack of cinematic success could be explained by Tudor's model since she failed to actually fit into any of his categories--instead initially establishing herself onstage through an appeal to exotic racial other ness. (10) Yet this distinction never successfully answers why her filmic persona adopts the form it does in Zouzou. This mystery can only be examined through questioning her complex position as a cultural subject and its influence on her filmic image. To fully understand her positioning in this role, we must also examine the placement of her costar as a key textual counterpoint.\n\nJEAN CABIN AS COUNTERPOINT TO BAKER\n\nJean Cabin's popularity as an actor certainly appeals to the qualities outlined in Tudor's model. Within many notable films of the 1930s, his stardom emerged as heavily defined by this identification or emulation-based schema through his persona as a French populist hero and working-class every-man. Vincendeau explores this popularity as being based in \"his performance of 'charismatic ordinariness.' His parts and extra-cinematic image repeatedly emphasized 'ordinary' working-class values ... especially through associations with popular leisure, work, and the land\" (70). In this manner, Gabin resembles many of the American actors who so often theoretically define the concept of \"star.\" Much of this connection not only arises out of analysis of his image, but in how he affiliated himself to the working-man persona, something also common among Hollywood stars of the period. As Vincendeau illustrates, similar to how James Cagney presented his acting \"not as an art but as a 'job to do,'\" Gabin \"put the accent on 'le turbin\" ('hard grind'): 'I am an artisan.... I work as a proletarian'\" (71). (11)\n\nYet such correlations fail to discount Gabin as a truly French filmic persona, an image that plays an important role in Popular Front representations of the period. Various films, such as Pepe Le Moko, La Bete humane (1938), and Remorques (1940), exemplify this position with their ultimately tragic endings for a criminal hero. His ability to simultaneously epitomize both French populism and an American-like stardom should not be viewed as contradictory. To once again reference Naremore, his role as \"a professional thespian\" bases itself in concepts from the American star system, especially the discursive practices of vulnerable tough guys who project a similar 'charming ordinariness.' Much of his role as a \"subject in the culture\" generates from a distinct place within pre-World War II French society. The Foreign Legion drama La Bandera, released one year after Zouzou, catapulted him into superstardom and cemented his cinematic image as a distinctly French vulnerable tough guy. The film also blatantly epitomizes an imperialist text where the Moroccans sometimes are simply called \"bastards.\" Vincendeau explains how such views of otherness exemplify a trend in Gabin's films where \"his French identity is affirmed against racial or ethnic 'others'--Josephine Baker in Zouzou, the inhabitants of the Casbah in Pepe Le Moko or the city of Genoa in Au-dele des grilles, and all the Angelos and Pepitos of the 1950s policiers\" (68).\n\nWhile these roles illustrate a trend in the actor's career, the inclusion of Zouzou in the list becomes problematic. Firstly, the production was produced before the more clearly-defined establishment of Gabin's populist persona, even though he developed a certain amount of stardom during this period (seen as his name appears before the title after Baker's credit). Therefore, only elements of the myth emerge, mainly his position as an every-man projecting \"charming ordinariness.\" This appeal to a working-class ideal appears in his jobs as a sailor and, later, an electrician in the film. Other aspects of the persona, such as the flawed heroics of the populist hero, do not necessarily materialize. Secondly, Zouzou exists as a musical text featuring a showcasing of music hall and realist singer performances. Gabin's casting acknowledges his own background as a music hall performer. And finally, Gabin's display of \"charming ordinariness\" appears in what essentially remains a supporting role to Baker's \"charming otherness.\" This position proves less imperialist and, instead, appeals more to the jazz-era negrophilism defining much of Baker's popularity. The text highlights how Gabin affirms Baker's racial otherness as opposed to significantly having her defining his Frenchness.\n\nThis contrast appears during Gabin's only musical number in Zouzou, a sequence distinctly based in the category of the \"realist singer\" performance. Jean, Zouzou, and Claire spend the evening at a working-class bar where an accordion band plays a lighthearted waltz called \"Viens Fifine.\" As the scene begins, we see Zouzou sitting alone at a table and bouncing in her chair to the music. She turns and wiggles her finger to somebody offscreen, positioned toward the dance floor. The film cuts to reveal Jean and Claire happily dancing to the waltz as Gabin begins singing. The two look over to Zouzou at one point, to which she again playfully wiggles her finger at them. The camera then focuses upon Jean and Claire as the number continues now with backup vocals provided by the surrounding bar patrons. When the brief song ends, the couple returns to the table to meet Zouzou, who has been tracing the name \"Jean\" in the tablecloth with her dampened finger. She embarrassingly covers the writing when they arrive. The movement of Gabin among the working-class citizens helps to affirm his placement as a French every-man at home among the populace of the city. The accompaniment of the bar patrons exemplifies him as a performer who, unlike Baker, is tied directly to the proletariat Paris community. This closeness illustrates a motif throughout the film of linking national identity with performance venue. As Elizabeth Ezra writes, \"different entertainment forms depicted in Zouzou represent different modes of community based on varying degrees of intimacy between performers and spectators, ranging from a formal distinction, in the case of the music hall, ... to complete identification in participatory forms such as the bal populaire\" (Colonial 102).\n\nBut beyond highlighting Gabin's developing populist persona, the sequence also notably illustrates a distinctive segregation of its actors, with Baker existing as observer to the dancing white couple. Dina Sherzer writes about the sequence:\n\nWhen Claire and Jean dance together, the camera focuses on the perfect fit, the togetherness of their bodies. Indeed, spectators are given the message that Claire, the laundry girl, and Jean, the electrician, the two French individuals, typical characters of films of the Popular Front, are made for each other. They are a \"natural\" match; their names, their bodies, and their looks fit. (233)\n\nWhile the proposed racial and national \"compatibility\" of Jean and Claire characterizes much of the scene, Sherzer neglects to explore Zouzou's crucial positioning as an observer to the dancing. Countering the multiple sequences of being gazed upon, Baker becomes spectator to the white couple--which serves as a tragically ironic foreshadowing to her eventual losing of Jean to Claire. The sequence remains primarily about the positioning of Baker as racial Other, a tragic and charming outsider obsessively writing her true love's name onto the tablecloth. Her centralization within this sequence and the text in general seems especially significant considering the briefness of Gabin's musical number (well under a minute in length). As this scene illustrates, he functions within the text primarily as a counter to Baker's femininity and racial otherness. Yet, as the film attempts to reconcile its alternate images of \"charming ordinariness\" and \"charming otherness,\" the larger question arises of how this struggle challenges the text's dimensions as a star vehicle. How can racial difference and national identity upset and, possibly, reconcile the pairing of two \"incompatible\" popular personas?\n\nZOUZOU, POETIC REALISM, AND THE AMERICAN BACKSTAGE MUSICAL\n\nWhen examining the text as star vehicle, we must also recognize the genre influences at play within Zouzou. Partly, the film fits into the aesthetic distinction of poetic realism, especially with its tragic depictions of Zouzou's unrequited love for Jean. Such a tone follows many of the descriptions attributed to this period of French cinema by critics, as outlined by Dudley Andrew in his book-length study of poetic realism. He writes that with early critical response to such films, \"Adjectives like 'romantic,' 'moody,' 'pessimistic,' cropped up. Understandably, poetic realism became a concept to latch on to\" (12). Zouzou's focus upon the working-class population of Paris also associates the text with this aesthetic. Additionally, the mise-en-scene illustrates a style common to other films of this period of French cinema. As Conway writes, \"The film's treatment of Parisian urban space is similar, in some ways, to that of other 1930s French realist films\" (143). (12) This influence especially materializes in scenes of everyday life in Montmartre that range from detailed sunny market places to noir-ish nighttime shadows, seen when Zouzou witnesses Jean being wrongly implicated in a murder. Along with obvious associations with poetic realism, the film also heavily bases itself within a Hollywood tradition of the backstage musical. Developed at Warner Bros. during the period, this subgenre was structured around the \"show within a show\" concept that also runs throughout Zouzou. In fact, Baker's film incorporates cliches from these motion pictures in the forms of comically panicked producers and chatty chorus girls. In an explicit reference to an American backstage aesthetic, in one sequence the show's choreographer speaks American English to the chorus girls as he explains the steps of the routines. As Zouzou incorporates this form of musical cinema, its backstage story showcases the consummate Paris revue star, Baker.\n\nProduced the year before Zouzou, Lloyd Bacon's 42nd Street (1933) features remarkable choreography and direction over many of the musical scenes by Busby Berkeley. This enormously popular film was the first of Berkeley's Warners Bros. series to fully employ the backstage structure where rehearsal and smaller numbers lead to multiple elaborate musical sequences that overtake the last quarter of the text, essentially the structure employed in Zouzou. Martin Rubin writes on the Berkeley backstage musical as basing itself in a tradition of the American revue, which he defines as \"a mixture of self-contained acts, with a general emphasis on music and comedy. However, the format of the revue is more solid and 'anchored' than that of its predecessor, vaudeville.\" This \"anchoring\" usually, but not always, is linked together by \"some sort of continuity\" in the form of a possible tenuous plot, theme, or selected performers (26). (13) The backstage musical incorporates a revue impulse that extends to a \"range of adulterated forms that incorporate narrative while at the same time maintaining a pronounced autonomy of the musical passages\" (33). Rubin outlines three interlocking levels of how production numbers segregate from the body of the film in the Warners/Berkeley backstage musicals: \"narrative (they bare little relation to the surrounding plot); spatial (the space of the musical numbers is a separate domain from that of the narrative); and discursive (the 'impossible' discourse of the musical numbers does not impinge on the 'realistic' discourse of the narrative).\" These separations were crucial in the creation of \"a sense of gratuitousness\" and \"rampant excess\" in the Berkeley spectacle as removed from the rest of the film--or as \"an end in itself\" (41).\n\nFor the most part, Zouzou follows this scenario in many of its transitions to elaborate musical sequences. The employment of the chorus girls adopts an obviously Berkeleyesque treatment throughout many of their numbers, which fail to actually incorporate Baker and focus on a more abstract form of cinematic spectacle. The first of these scenes highlights the disjunctive narrative, spatial, and discursive elements common within the musical transitions discussed by Rubin. Now a headliner at the theater, Zouzou appears worrisome as her costumer attempts to comfort her in the dressing room. From this scene, the film cuts to a shot of the audience of the theater and then to the curtain raising to reveal an elaborately spacious stage. We see an oversized bed where two chorus girls rest their head's upon giant pillows. They awake and pull the covers back, revealing multiple dancers who begin prancing in unison upon the giant bed. The set is adorned with other enormous pieces, such as a telephone and a window with vertical blinds. Male chorus members later appear and more elaborate dancing takes place, utilizing other giant props like a telephone and comb. Oddly enough, this elaborately Berkeleyesque sequence leads to a Baker appearance that essentially fails to incorporate her into the spectacle of movement common to such films. As the dancers all elaborately fall to the ground in anticipation, the removal of a large cloth reveals another giant object in the form of a birdcage. Here, Baker sits upon a perch and woefully sings \"Haiti.\"\n\nHer appearance now exemplifies exoticism, primitivism, and, once again, animalism as she wears a tight outfit that exposes a great amount of skin. Large white feathers also protrude from her back to make her resemble a bird. In fact, at one point, she simply sings by chirping, forgoing words. The lyrics of the song stresses her exotic, yet tragic position as a displaced racial object. She sings, \"You're my only country, Haiti.\" \"Far from your shores, the most beautiful cage is nothing but a jail.\" (14) The scene adopts a curious mixture of a Berkeleyesque stage design, the glamour of the French revue, and a heartfelt recognition of Baker's position as exotic Other--something linking itself in its tragic tone to the poetic realist moments of the text. Therefore, these multiple dimensions are caused by both her star image and the genre influences. The complex layers become even more problematic as the scene ends with Baker joyfully emerging from her cage and leaping into the arms of a group of male chorus members. She then raises her arms as the cheers from the audience fill the soundtrack. Baker ends the sequence reminding us of her position as a revue star. While she never completely incorporates herself into the Berkeleyesque spectacle, elements of this aesthetic bleed into the sequence in the form of the production design's giant birdcage. Thus, when considering the placement of Baker in the text, a more complex reading incorporating and transcending the genre influences must be utilized. What ultimately emerges is the star dictating the design of the film. Zouzou becomes a complex star vehicle through the showcasing of a complex star.\n\nNEGOTIATING CHARMING OTHERNESS WITH CHARMING ORDINARINESS: \"STAR\" AS DEFINING THE TEXTUAL CONSTRUCT\n\nAs illustrated earlier, the progression of Baker's musical sequences correlates with the stages of her own career--from the exotic body of the shadow dance to the glamorous revue star seen later in the film. This parallel also determines how the text contains tones of poetic realism through employing more of a realist singer motif. One of the sequences Conway believes heavily conveys realist (singer) tendencies occurs before Zouzou's eventual rise to stardom when she parodies the musical hall style of Barbara (Lla Merry), the blonde star she will eventually replace. While working in the laundry, Zouzou's female coworkers pressure her to do \"your Barbara impersonation.\" She eventually agrees when they all start chanting, \"Barbara, Barbara, Barbara.\" Zouzou performs a mocking version of \"C'est lui,\" the number she later sings to a chorus of white males as a revue star. In comparison to that scene, the performance once again places Baker center frame, though her behavior has none of the revue style glamour found later. Instead, she joyfully plays with the laundresses who encircle her as she throws clothing in the air and mockingly sways her body. The scene is then cut short to show Barbara joylessly rehearsing the same number in the theater, illustrating the passion she lacks in comparison to Zouzou. This moment counters the other performances of Baker though the inclusion of an all-female spectatorship that, as Conway summarizes, privileges, \"if only briefly, a noncontrolling [female] gaze at the female performer\" (141). This dynamic incorporates even more irony to the later performance of the same song within the show, since she again controls the gaze of the chorus--yet manages to never fully escape the racial and sexual objectification. Also important to the laundress sequence when considering Baker as \"star\" is how aggressively the tone proves realist. By singing the song in a lower-class social sphere, Baker echos the style found in Gabin's number and, once again, illustrates the communal and theatrical correlations materializing throughout the film. Yet it proves significant that the film cuts this performance short, ultimately failing to truly identify Baker with the white Parisian proletariat in the same concrete manner as Gabin. (15)\n\nOverall, Baker and, in other scenes, Gabin's roles as subjects within French culture greatly inform the text, especially when considering the racial connotations of their pairing. The issue central to considering the Baker/Gabin relationship is the missed opportunity for the miscegenation of a black and white star. According to Phyllis Rose, Baker had wished for Zouzou to end up with Jean, but Abatino insisted on there being no union because he \"liked the story of the female star who has given up the emotional side of her life as the price of stardom\" (162). Conway also suggests that the eventual heartbreak of Zouzou illustrates a parable commenting on the emotional emptiness of the glamorous revue stage. She writes, \"The 'tragedy' of the film is that, in the end, Zouzou is relegated to the artificial, joyless universe of the music hall, leaving Jean in the arms of another laundress and in the warm 'authentic' realist world\" (140). Such readings of the final outcome of the Baker/Gabin pairing tend to neglect the spectacular aspects materializing earlier in the text. While the \"lonely at the top\" message certainly appears, the visual spectacle of the revue scenes that overtake the film's last quarter leaves the universe of the music hall feeling rather appealing. What strikes the viewer as tragic is the loss of Jean itself, something inescapably associated with the race of the two lead actors.\n\nDespite this failure to truly overcome racial boundaries, the film succeeds within its ability to provide a tragically ironic commentary on its inability to miscegenate. Similar to Zouzou's other acknowledgments of the popular racial objectification of Baker, the sorrowful outcome of the paring keenly recognizes the two stars' roles as subjects in the French culture. This ironic recognition of their \"incompatibility\" transpires relatively early within the film. During the opening, Zouzou and Jean are shown as children living with the friendly Papa Mele (Pierre Larquey) in the circus sideshow. Mele ironically places the two children under the truly impossible category of twins within a venue showcasing them to a fascinated crowd--a scenario similar to Baker and Gabin's placement into a musical star vehicle. Of course, this blood relation is false since the two simply live as foster children with the kindly Mele. Yet, to the circus crowds, he makes their existence as a pair even more improbable by stating that \"these twins, ladies and gentlemen, were born ten years ago today on a Polynesian island. Their parents, a Chinese woman and Indian, didn't want to acknowledge them because their skin had a different color.\" While the film blatantly wrestles with its failure to romantically pair Baker and Gabin, their stardom--their classification as the 'charming Other' and the 'charming ordinary'--never allows for a straightforward anti-miscegenation message to emerge. Instead, a complex interplay between their racial roles as popular personas, characters, and subjects in the culture transpires throughout the film.\n\nNot surprisingly, when the narrative finally does fail to romantically pair Baker with Gabin, the text adopts a distinctly poetically realistic tone. After excitedly receiving a curtain call for her successful performance as a revue headliner, Zouzou rushes off to see Jean--whom she managed to successfully clear of bogus murder charges. From a distance, she spots Claire pacing before the large metal doors of the prison awaiting Jean's release. When he emerges, the white couple affectionately hold each other and walk away. This ending might seem to confirm Sherzer's critique that the film promotes the racially \"pure\" pairing of Jean and Claire as \"a 'natural' match\" (233). But Zouzou manages to complicate this colonialist impulse through its showcasing of Baker as \"star.\" What becomes a key focus within the scene is not the pairing of Gabin and Aussey, but the reaction of Baker. Much like when witnessing the pair's dancing in the barroom, Zouzou remains the tragic outsider. She provides the ultimate gaze upon the lovers, essentially affiliating the view of the camera with the point-of-view of the racial Other. The melancholic tone of this moment continues as the film transitions into a succession of shots of a despondent Baker slowly wandering then running the streets of Paris, finally arriving to the theater that is now adorned with posters featuring her face and name. A worker plasters onto an advertisement a banner stating, \"100th Performance.\" Then, the film cuts to an idealized faux Paris landscape and pans the camera to reveal Baker, once again adorned with feathers, perched in her gilded cage, and singing \"Haiti.\" This time, no Berkeleyesque chorus appears and the curtain simply closes to end the film. As the final transition between narrative and elaborate musical number occurs, the sequence adopts a strange hybridization of tones by maintaining the poetically realistic tragic ending in the visual context of an elaborately designed musical set piece. Significantly, to accentuate the loneliness, the film has no chorus members appear (no representational white male or even female gazers). In fact, the final scene exists without even the theater audience present and, instead, as a melancholic dream state for Zouzou or, more precisely, the Baker star image. Through the tragic tone of its final moments, the film devolves into a spectacle of pure stardom--a highly personalized world of the glamorous racial Other. The only gaze left now remains that of the motion picture audience who determines the appeal of Baker as a cinematic persona.\n\nNotes\n\nAll of the illustrations appear courtesy of the Belknap Collection for the Performing Arts, Department of Special Collections and Area Studies at the University of Florida.

One columnist, reflecting on Baker's acting, stated that, if produced in America, the performance \"would cause the director to hit her in the head with the camera\" (164).\n\n(2) Ezra's reading of \"community\" in the film appears in both the article \"Silents are Golden: Staging Community in Zouzou\" and in a revised version for a chapter of her book The Colonial Unconscious: Race and Culture in Interwar France. Since the latter was published more recently, I employ her revised analysis for this essay.\n\n(3) In Cagney: The Actor As Auteur, McGilligan stresses that while approaching an actor's presence in a film in this manner, many previous auteur approaches of cinema that focus on the director as artist do not necessarily apply. He writes, \"Whether or not an actor can be a genuine 'auteur,' in the widely-accepted critical sense, is really a moot, provocative point in many ways.\" McGilligan states that the approach simply exists as \"a model against which to explore an explanation of the actor's influence.\" He finds this revised approach necessary because \"under certain circumstances, an actor may influence a film as much as a writer, director, or producer\" (199). Keeping this distinction in mind, my interest in Zouzou does not focus on Baker as a creative force behind the film- which historically appears to be the case and informs elements of this article--but rather, on the text as a form of vehicle for a culturally specific star image.\n\n(4) Overall, large organized studios with a contractual hold over stars have been rare in France. Though, as Vincendeau points out, there are exceptions to this rule. Pathe and Gaumont contractually held early film comics and, in the 1930s, Pathe-Natan attempted to create a stable of stars. Despite these exceptions, the collapse of Pathe-Natan and Gaumont-Franco-Film-Aubert in 1933-4 essentially had French cinema functioning as a \"cottage industry\" (11).\n\n(5) This mode of cinema did not confine itself to France, as seen in the American equivalent of the strong vaudeville influence on many studio productions of the same period. This vaudeville aesthetic heavily emerges in musical and, especially, comedy films of the 1930s. See Jenkins's What Made Pistachio Nuts ?: Early Sound Comedy and the Vaudeville Aesthetic.\n\n(6) 1920s France's fascination with African and African American culture often is studied through the intense national obsession with Baker as a music-hall icon and, more specifically, as a \"body object.\" In many ways, she came to nationally represent the exotic racial Other in French popular culture. To read more on her position within this social role see Archer-Straw's Negrophilia: Avant-Garde Paris and Black Culture in the 1920s, Stuart's Showgirls, Burt's Alien Bodies: Representations of Modernity, 'Race' and Nation in Early Modern Dance, Kear's \"Venus noire: Josephine Baker and the Parisian Music-Hall,\" and Lyon's \"Josephine Baker's Hothouse.\" For more on Paul Colin's work as an important Modernist illustrator of Baker's popular image, see Archer-Straw 107-33, Dalton & Gates, Jr.'s \"Josephine Baker and Paul Colin: African American Dance Seen Through Parisian Eyes,\" and, of course, Colin's own published collections of lithographs.\n\n(7) For more of Rim's remembrances on writing Zouzou with Baker's input, see Baker & Chase's biography Josephine: The Hungry Heart, 183-84. Other significant biographical works on Baker, which also illustrate how she progressively became more image-savvy, include Wood's The Josephine Baker Story, Rose's Jazz Cleopatra: Josephine Baker in her Time, Haney's Naked at the Feast: A Biography of Josephine Baker, and Baker's own autobiography Josephine.\n\n(8) Though not explicitly stated, Conway suggests the sequence presents a scenario first theoretically outlined in Laura Mulvey's landmark \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,\" with its discussion of a male gaze projecting \"its phantasy on to the female figure which is styled accordingly\" (27). Conway summarizes the mechanism at play in the sequence as \"the production of female spectacle orchestrated by a man for the desiring gaze of (presumed) male spectators\" (142).\n\n(9) Taken from Tudor's Image and Influence, Dyer outlines the four classifications in the second chapter of Stars. As the weakest category, emotional affinity has the spectator feel \"a loose attachment to a particular protagonist deriving jointly from star, narrative, and the individual personality of the audience.\" Self-identification has a viewer placing him or herself in the position or situation of a certain star. Most common among younger filmgoers, Imitation has the star serving as a model for behavior. Projection becomes an extreme version of imitation with intense mimicking of a star. Dyer also points out that \"Tudor warns against our taking examples of extreme projection as being widespread\" (18).\n\n(10) Baker made only four films as \"star\"--La Sirene des Tropiques, Zouzou, Princess Tam Tam, and Fausse Alerte (1939). She never found the same success in films as she did on the stage.\n\n(11) Part of the reason for his association to American stars might be due to Gabin's popularity as a truly international star through such productions as Pepe Le Moko and La Grande illusion, both of which proved influential to American films of the studio era. During World War II, Gabin lived in Hollywood and made two American productions, Moontide (1942) and The Imposter (1943). Also, much of the popular discourse surrounding Gabin often mentions his similarity to such American actors as Gary Cooper and Spencer Tracy--something especially prevalent in the television documentary Remembering Jean Gabin (1978), where interviewees alternate between stressing the actor's distinct Frenchness and his similarities to popular American male stars. For more on the life and career of Gabin see Brunelin.\n\n(12) Conway lists such productions as Faubourg Montmartre (1931), Couer de Lilas (1932), and Le Crime de Monsieur Lange (1936) as providing visual counterparts to specific settings in Zouzou (143).\n\n(13) For a brief overview of the revue's transnational history, see Rubin 26-32. For more specifically on the artistry of Berkeley see Thomas & Terry, Pike & Martin, and Hoberman.\n\n(14) The linking of Haiti to Baker proves especially interesting when considering her image's development within the negrophilism of the jazz-era. While it received official independence from France in 1820, upon Zouzou's production, the country was in the final days of its occupation by the Americans--who left during the year of the film's release, 1934. While Baker herself actually came from St. Louis, Missouri, her character has a more mysterious (i.e. exotic) ethnic heritage. By linking her to Haiti during this number, the film associates her persona to the complicated imperialist histories of both France and the United States. See Lawless and McKissack.\n\n(15) Also significant is how the film is nodding to Baker's own family background, since her mother had worked as a laundress. In other words, Baker's reputation as \"a subject in the culture\" dictates the adoption of a realist style within the sequence."
