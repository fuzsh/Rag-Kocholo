        "text": "Leading fashion stylist-come-designer, Elisa Nalin has collaborated with French swimwear and lingerie brand, Princesse Tam Tam.\n\nThe capsule collection, which will be available from June, has all the promise of summer featuring a cheery color palette in cheeky swimwear silhouettes. Fun one-pieces and wafty, oversized shirt dresses are offered along with sweet bikinis and pajama-esq items with contrasting details - epitomizing a stylish summer holiday.\n\nBorn in Italy, in the city of Verona, Elisa studied Fashion Design at the European Institute of Design in Milan. After graduating she worked for Costume National and later joined Samsonite, where she headed the men and women’s shoe collection. With a move to Paris she concentrated on her freelance designer and stylist career, which she has been doing for the past 15 years.\n\nHow did the collaboration come about? It’s funny cause Princesse Tam Tam is one of the only French brands I’ve been buying since I moved to Paris 17 years ago. I always liked their products and the image of the brand, the positivity and joyful mood they always communicated so well. So, one morning when I received an email from Princesse Tam Tam, at the beginning I thought it was a spam, but looking in to it I saw it was from Julia their Creative Director asking me if I was interested in meeting them for a possible collaboration...it immediately made sense for me and so it started.\n\nDescribe the line... The line is full of summer so I would describe it as a super light wardrobe for a summer holiday. My kind of summer holidays precisely in Sicily. It’s like my ideal suitcase already packed for the holiday. So you’ll find my essentials like men’s shaped shirts with a feminine slit in the back, in a stripy or flowal print light cotton, as well as a slip dress, a flowery maxy dress, a shirt dress and pyjamas (I always travel with my pajamas) and loads of cute bikinis and one pieces with sexy details in the back.\n\nHow have you put your own spin on it? I really enjoy creating a collection, I started my career as a designer so I have put myself 100% into this, starting from the choice of color palette, from the choice of the prints and a very particular attention to all the details. So, for example, you will find colorful beads at the end of the straps of the swimsuits and the dresses, and the straps of the one pieces appear as if they are twisted - like little braids. Or where the swimsuit is in printed fabrics, the straps are in full colorful lurex. I wanted to maintain the Princesse Tam Tam mood but putting in a little twist that resembles me. I wanted it to be a happy collection and a feel-good summery kind of wardrobe."
