        "text": "Preface\n\nIn 1981-82 I took a six-month sabbatical from my teaching job in Philadelphia to travel around the USA meeting homeopaths. The purpose of the trip was twofold: first, to meet homeopathic practitioners in an effort to find out if I should change the course of my life and become a homeopathic physician and second, to meet homeopaths of all stripes in an effort to bring them into the National Center for Homeopathy. In the spring of 1981 the National Center had an acrimonious split from the American Foundation for Homeopathy. Almost all of the membership records were lost. I offered to look up those study groups that were known to the NCH and to get them \"back in the fold.\" In retrospect, my job was bigger than that; it was to meet all the factions and to get them talking to each other again. I was an \"unknown.\" I had no baggage with either organization. I treated all as equal.\n\nDuring my time on the road I met and talked to 100 people and spoke to 405 people in study groups.\n\nUpon my return, I wrote a 50 page paper for the NCH outlining who I saw, and commenting upon what I saw.\n\nConsidering this trip happened almost 25 years ago, my conclusions are surprisingly contemporary. I guess that not much has changed in the last 25 years. The issue of then are still the issues we have now.\n\nOver the years a number of people have asked for copies of my paper. What appears here is the whole text of that paper I wrote in 1982.\n\nIn several places I have added notes (in italics) to comment upon, or update the information presented. I have decided to delete the individual addresses, first for reasons of privacy, and second because many of them are way out of date.\n\nI hope that you, the reader, find this work useful.\n\nJulian Winston\n\nTawa, New Zealand\n\nDecember 2004\n\nHomeopathy: Some Notes and Observations\n\nOctober 1981- April 1982\n\nWho I met and where\n\nMy observations\n\nForeword\n\nIn 1972, I was given the name of a homoeopathic doctor in Philadelphia. That visit to Raymond Seidel, MD, D(hom), turned my life around. My relationship with Dr. Seidel turned from that of a patient to that of a friend. It was with his sanction, I was able to attend the Millersville Course in 1980. Since my background is in education (I am an associate professor at a College in Philadelphia), I wrote an evaluation of the program and sent it to the National Center for Homoeopathy. By the next year, I was working as the Registrar of the school.\n\nThe following paper was written as a result of my decision to take a year long sabbatical from my teaching and use the time to visit the homoeopathic community around the country. As I am writing this, I have been informed of my election to the Board of Directors of the National Center for Homeopathy and my appointment to the editorial advisory board of the American Institute for Homeopathy's Journal. It has been an interesting 10 years since I stepped into Dr. Seidel's office on Porter Street!\n\nI would like to dedicate this report to the memory of Ray Seidel.\n\nJulian Winston\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nApril, 1982\n\nIntroduction\n\nFor six months - from October 1, 1981 to April 1, 1982, I traveled 20,000 miles around the United States and through one Canadian Province. I was on a one year sabbatical from my regular job as a professor of design at the Philadelphia College of Art. I was ostensibly working as a field representative for the National Center for Homeopathy in Washington, DC. My goal was to find out what was happening with homoeopathy around the country. I regret that I was not able to visit everyone. The people I did visit form a good cross section of those interested in homoeopathy. As I traveled, I was given more names of people to look up, and more cities to visit. It was a full, yet very short six months.\n\nWhen I started the sojourn, I wondered what the outcome would be. Below are two documents. Part I is a chronological listing of the places I went, the people I saw, and some brief observations. Part II is a summary of my findings. The first part is objective, the second subjective.\n\nHomoeopathy is plagued by some large but vague questions: Where are we going? What are we doing? In order to take any action, a problem has to be clearly formulated. The clearer the question, the clearer the answer. Although I offer no answers here, I hope that I have been able to clarify the questions.\n\nPlease understand that the views expressed here do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Center for Homoeopathy.\n\nA copy of this report is being sent to all the people I visited.\n\nPART I: Who I met, and where\n\nOCTOBER 16-28 ONTARIO, CANADA\n\nFirst, some background. In 1927, Ontario passed the Drugless Practitioners Act. Included in this act were all practices outside the scope of regular medicine: dentistry, nursing, massage, etc. Over the years, most of the groups have withdrawn from the scope of the act and have formed their own regulatory boards. There is now a Board of Dental Examiners, a Board of Nursing Examiners, etc. The only people left who now come under the purview of the Drugless Practitioners Act are chiropractors, osteopaths, physiotherapists, and naturopaths. A few years ago the Ontario Medical Association decided, through the Health Disciplines Act, that the practice of homoeopathy does not come under their purview. In short, they decided that homoeopathy is not medicine. Homoeopathy in Ontario falls under the Drugless Practitioners Act. It is controlled by the Ontario Naturopathic Association, and is seen as part of naturopathic practice. The Ontario Naturopathic Association has three branches: The Academy of Naturopathy, the Academy of Homoeopathy, and the Academy of Acupuncture. The association is trying to get the Ministry of Health to look at the Drugless Practitioners Act and re-define some of its parameters. At the present time, the Ministry of Health would see a 1 year massage program and a 4 year chiropractic program as having the same standing under the law. With this as a background, here are the people I met:\n\nTOM FOSTER, Registrar Ontario College of Naturopathic Medicine Kitchener, Ontario\n\nThe college went through many changes and is now in business at:\n\nThe Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine\n\n255 Sheppard avenue East, ste 2017\n\nToronto, Ontario\n\nCanada M2K 1E2\n\nThe college is going through its first formative year. It is associated with the University of Waterloo. A student would first attend Waterloo for 4 years and get a Degree in Biological Science. During the last semester, the student would take a few courses at the Naturopathic College. Upon graduation from Waterloo the student would then attend the Naturopathic College for three more years, leading to a degree in Naturopathic Medicine. The College is located in a beautiful old building in downtown Kitchener-about 70 miles west of Toronto. The basement of the College houses the Naturopathic Medical Clinic which is run by:\n\nGORDON SMITH, ND\n\nA graduate of the National College in Portland, Oregon.\n\nTom Foster introduced me to:\n\nARNO KOEGLER, ND\n\nWaterloo, Ontario\n\nKoegler is a German trained Naturopath who came to Canada in the 1920's. Dissatisfied with the quality of Homoeopathic supplies in Canada, he began to manufacture his own. His remedies are made under the label of Koegler Laboratories. He has a beautiful triple mortar triturating machine that he built himself. All the remedies are triturated and dispensed as packets of \"powders\". He rarely goes over the 8X potency He makes extensive use of Iridology in his diagnostic procedures. Upon his retirement several years ago (he is now 86 years old) his practice and pharmacy were taken over by:\n\nJOHN BENDER, ND\n\nWaterloo, Ontario\n\nBender attended the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon. Upon graduation he came to Waterloo and took over Koegler's practice. He is continuing to use the same techniques low potencies and iridology. Kogler is still available for advice and consultation. John showed me some patient record books and pointed to one which Koegler started when he first came to Canada. He pointed out that some of the patients recorded in that book are still coming in - Koegler must be doing something right! The remedies are still being made on the machines that Koegler built. The remedy packages are kept in a beautiful wood cabinet that Koegler built. The office is located in a stone house that Koegler built. Over the front door, tucked in a niche, is a bust of Hahnemann.\n\nWhile in the area, I talked to a group of 28 people who were students at the Naturopathic school. The subject was \"The History of Homoeopathy in the United States and its current status.\"\n\nN. RICHARD PRAGNELL, DC, ND\n\nDon Mills, Ontario\n\nPragnell holds introductory seminars for new patients so they can understand the principles of homoeopathy. Homoeopathic books are for sale in the office. He also makes first aid kits for his patients use. He talked about the excitement he finds in being able to effect \"genetic change\" - to have the possibility of removing misasmatic tendencies so they are not passed on to future generations. He makes his remedies on the Rae Potency Simulator. I heard from a person who has one of Pragnell's kits that the ARNICA supplied was some of the most effective he had ever used.\n\nROBERT FARQUHARSON, ND\n\nOrilla, Ontario\n\nPresident of the Naturopathic School and the Naturopathic Licensing Board. He has a thriving practice in Orilla. The picture of an old time homoeopath. I spent a most informative morning with him.\n\nJ. D. LANCASTER\n\nKingston, Ontario\n\nMy original contact in Canada. He attended Millersville in 1981.\n\nHe introduced me to:\n\nSUZANNE K. ROHN, ND\n\nToronto, Ontario\n\nTrained in South Africa. She introduced me to the people at the Naturopathic School and also to:\n\nERIC SHRUBB, DC, ND\n\nScarborough, Ontario\n\nMember of the Naturopathic Licensing Board.\n\nTHOMPSON'S PHARMACY\n\nToronto, Ontario\n\nA beautiful place. Pictures of plants, a portrait of Hahnemann, and old oak cabinets. One wall is lined with tincture bottles. I did not see their manufacturing facility. They are one of the few pharmacies that deal in the LM (50-Millesimal) potencies. They expressed concern that there were few \"real\" homoeopaths in Canada. As Mr. Bollman put it, \"someone who starts a case with a 50M Medorrhinum is not a homoeopath.\" I obviously did not meet the people he was talking about. I had a distinct feeling that they are standing aloof from the very people they need support from.\n\nOCTOBER 29 - November 3 DETROIT/ANN ARBOR MICHIGAN\n\nMARY LOU DeFAUW\n\nRoyal Oak, Michigan\n\nIntroductory lecture. Fifteen (15) people.\n\nELIZABETH BRACEY HOMOEOPATHIC GROUP\n\nDetroit, Michigan\n\nIntroductory Lecture. Twenty six (26) people.\n\nPATRICA KELLY, MD\n\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\n\nADELAIDE SUITS\n\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\n\nMeeting with 25 people. Spoke about homoeopathic pharmacy.\n\nDENNIS CHERNIN, MD\n\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\n\nChernin, along with Drs. David Anderson and Dale Buegel, is the author of the book Homoeopathic Remedies For Physicians, Laymen, And Therapists. It was one of the earliest of the modern self-help books.\n\nELEANOR JOHNSON\n\nHartland, Michigan\n\nEleanor had taught the lay course at Millersville several years ago. She was my original contact in the area, and has been responsible for setting up many of the study groups in the Michigan area. She is an exceptionally knowledgeable lay prescriber. It was a joy spending an afternoon with her.\n\nNOVEMBER 4-5 CHICAGO, ILLINOIS\n\nEHRHART AND KARL\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\nI spent the day with WILLIAM SMALLEY and the owners, RICHARD LEVINSON and PETER KIESCH. I would love to take a year off and catalog this place. Many of the tablets are stored in large Horlick Malted Milk Jars. The \"high potency\" room has three cabinets - one filled with Fincke Potencies, another with Kents, and another with Allens. What an impressive collection. They have one of the most complete Homoeopathic Libraries I have seen- all in glass front cases. I was shown some memorabilia from Kent - his shaving mug, pen knife, a gold handled cane that was presented to him by a hospital, and a silver and crystal mug that was presented to him by his students at Hahnemann Hospital.\n\nE&K were evenually bought out. William Smalley died. The library and high potency cabinets are (I have heard) in storage in the Chicago area. Peter and Richard formed Quintessence Pharmacy in Madison, Wisconsin. I believe it is still there. The location of the Kent memorabilia is unknown, although it might be in the hands of Richard Levinson.\n\nCONNIE BATTELLI\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\nConnie was at the Millersville Lay Course in 1981. We had dinner with her employer:\n\nJOEL SHEPPARD, MD\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\nWe talked the night about homoeopathy, the consequences of Hering's Law, and suppressive therapies.\n\nPAMELA SABO, RN\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\nPam was at Millersville in 1981. She is teaching a course in homoeopathic first aid to a group of her colleagues. I gave an introductory lecture to a group of 10.\n\nNOVEMBER 6-9 MADISON, WISCONSIN\n\nALAN LEVINE, MD\n\nMadison, Wisconsin\n\nTrained by Vithoulkas. We spent about three hours talking about what I had seen on the trip. He dispenses no remedies at his office. The order is called in and the patient is sent to pick it up at:\n\nQUINTESSENCE\n\nMadison, Wisconsin\n\nOwned by Richard Levinson and Peter Kiesch, who also own Ehrhart and Karl, this small Homoeopathic and herbal store is very complete. They have in stock the most common homoeopathic remedies in tablets (low potencies) and the higher potencies in dilutions. Richard is also a very fine lay prescriber and can give people who come in to the store information about minor acute problems.\n\nNOVEMBER 10 LAKE CITY, MINNESOTA\n\nSTEVEN SCHWEN\n\nLake City, Minnesota\n\nSteve was at the Lay course in 1981. Introductory lecture for 27 people.\n\nNOVEMBER 16 MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA\n\nVALERIE OHANIAN\n\nMATTHEW MONSEIN, MD\n\nWILLIAM JONES, MD\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nValerie, who works in the office of Drs. Monsein and Jones, was at the Millersville Lay course in 1981. Matt Monsein had his homoeopathic training through Rudolph Ballentine and the Himalayan Institute. Bill Jones, an internist for 30 years, was introduced to homoeopathy through the Institute. He spent some time in California with Robert Schore and Jacki Wilson. The office offers courses in first aid and homoeopathic philosophy. I did an introductory lecture for 32 people.\n\nNOVEMBER 21 OMAHA, NEBRASKA\n\nALICE CLARK\n\nOmaha, Nebraska\n\nDR. J. HINZE\n\nOmaha, Nebraska\n\nIntroductory lecture to 33 people.\n\nDECEMBER 3-13 ARIZONA\n\nFor the last few years there have been moves to establish some sort of licensing for homoeopathy in this state, and to establish a homoeopathic medical school. Arizona has been the location of many questionable medical schools. The parties who were originally involved in the Arizona movement had been thought by some to have questionable motives and credentials. The dirty politics that were played out made a Grade B movie about the CIA look like kid stuff. Fortunately, the people who were the prime offenders in this play were no longer on the scene when I visited. A Homoeopathic licensing law is now in effect. Briefly:\n\nHomoeopathy is defined as \"a system of medicine employing substances...given in microdoses...in accordance to the principle that substances that can cause symptoms in a healthy person can cure those symptoms in an ill person and managing the cure and prevention of disease holistically.\" The Homoeopathic Licensing Board shall consist of 5 members one layperson and 4 homoeopathic physicians. The initial board must (a) hold a degree in homoeopathy (b) hold a degree in medicine with approved homoeopathic training or (c) have practiced homoeopathic medicine for 3 years and have written affidavits to attest to their competency. The board shall enforce the standards prescribed by the chapter and set rules and regulations. To be licensed, you have to be an MD or DO from an approved school. The board tried to get a provision which would allow non-MD-/DO's who are in recognized branches of the healing arts to be allowed to practice on a limited basis, but this was struck down by the attorney general. There is also a clause in the bill that can be read to say that an MD/DO must give up their allopathic license to get the homoeopathic license. This clause has not been tested. Arizona has a 'sunset' provision on all legislation. If the law is not found to be effective in 5 years from the time of its passage, it will be rescinded.\n\nThe board has four and one half years to get it working. They are currently working on setting the standards for practice and education in the state. One of the requirements would be a minimum of ninety hours instruction in classical homoeopathy. They are proceeding slowly and carefully. They are aware that what happens in Arizona could be followed by other states, and it has to be done right. I met with three of the Board Members:\n\nHARVEY BIEGELSEN, MD\n\nScottsdale, Arizona\n\nSTEPHEN DAVIDSON, DO\n\nPhoenix, Arizona\n\nCHERYL HARTER, MD\n\nPhoenix, Arizona\n\nI also met with:\n\nABRAM BER, MD\n\nPhoenix, Arizona\n\nAbram is doing some interesting work which I discuss in Part II.\n\nABUNDANT LIFE HEALTH CLINIC\n\n(Vy Ferguson, Pat Shubert, Paula Shimeck)\n\nPhoenix, Arizona\n\nA.R.E. CLINIC\n\nPhoenix, Arizona\n\nThis clinic is run by the Association for Research and Enlightenment-- the Edgar Cayce group. Most of the doctors I met in Phoenix started out working at the clinic. I went, not with the intention of trying to convert them to homoeopathy, but to give them another source of information. If they are trying to explain the cures of the Cayce Readings, they might be able to explain some of then in light of the Law of Similars. If they are looking for a 'why,\" a knowledge of the Homoeopathic Materia Medica might be helpful in their work. I had a very cordial meeting with WILLIAM McGAREY, MD, the director of the clinic.\n\nJOHN and CARLA REED\n\nPhoenix, Arizona\n\nJohn works at the ARE clinic.\n\nILENE SPECTOR\n\nPhoenix, Arizona\n\nA Millersville graduate of several years ago.\n\nUPENDRA TRIVIDI\n\nPhoenix, Arizona\n\nThe only classically trained homoeopath in Arizona. His training was in India. He is working with Dr. Davidson. We spent a morning talking about homeopathic education.\n\nISOBEL McMAHEL\n\nPrescott, Arizona\n\nShe talked about the prospects of setting up a homoeopathic school on Indian land in Prescott. I walked over the eighty seven acres with her and the architect. It is still on paper. The larger questions I raise in the second part of the paper are still unanswered. Where will the capital come from? Who will teach? What will be taught? As of yet, there are no answers.\n\nDR. FREDRICH M. W. PLOG\n\nPrescott, Arizona\n\nTrained in Germany. I detail his work in Part II.\n\nROBERT BAUMANN\n\nTucson, Arizona\n\nLong discussion about radionics. He talked about radionic machines as being \"training wheels.\" You use them to learn how to detect healing energies, and then you can do it without the machine. An interesting discussion.\n\nFAYE McCOY\n\nTucson, Arizona\n\nMy original contact in Arizona. She runs a large lay group in the Tucson area. I did an introductory lecture for 39 people.\n\nDECEMBER 15-16 SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA\n\nROBERT SCHORE, MD\n\nSan Diego, California\n\nA very classical homoeopath. One of the few people who are interested in exploring the LM potencies. We talked about most of the issues that are spoken about in Part II. He publishes the magazine Homoeotherapy. It is issued bi-monthly, and contains a good cross section of current homoeopathic thought. He advocated taking a strong stand on the parameters of homoeopathic practice and saying, in effect, \"This is homoeopathy, and these are the people doing it. If there are only 20 people in the country doing it - better for the public to know who they are than to go to someone else.\" As an aside - his license plate reads: HAHNEMN.\n\nMICHAEL QUINN\n\nSan Diego, California\n\nMichael is a pharmacist and a friend of Bob Schore. He showed me some slides he had taken of European Pharmacies including some impressive shots of Laboratories Boiron. Much of our discussion is covered in the Pharmacy Section in Part II.\n\nDECEMBER 16-18 POWAY, CALIFORNIA\n\nJACQUELINE WILSON, MD\n\nPoway, California\n\nSpent three days with Jacki in her practice. A most informative time.\n\nDECEMBER 21-23 SAN FRANCISCO AREA. CALIFORNIA\n\nHOMEOPATHIC EDUCATIONAL SERVICES\n\nDana Ullman\n\nOakland, California\n\nDana has spent a lot of time and energy cultivating contacts with the Indian printing houses. The result is that there is now an established link which brings homoeopathic literature into this country on a regular basis. Dana is also responsible for the publication of some new books: A softback of KENT'S PHILOSOPHY, Coulter's new HOMOEOPATHIC SCIENCE IN MODERN MEDICINE, a revised edition of Vol. III of Coulter's DIVIDED LEGACY, and many fine pamphlets about Homoeopathy. Dana has done more to spread the word about homoeopathy than almost anyone else. I also visited him for an afternoon at the PACIFIC COLLEGE OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE in fan Rafael, California where he was teaching and working on curriculum development.\n\nINTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR HOMOEOPATHY\n\nFairfax, California\n\nAn afternoon with Cynthia Lanahan, and a discussion of all the issues talked about in Part II.\n\nHERING FAMILY HEALTH CLINIC\n\nBerkeley, California\n\nHow nice to see a Clinic with a homoeopathic practice! I had lunch with Corey Weinstein, MD and Laren Bays, ND. Corey had been running with Clinic and was about to leave for a sabbatical. Laren was due to move to Los Angeles within a week to start practice there. I did not get a chance to meet Greg Mantuffel, MD who is now running the Clinic. The Clinic is located in a suite of offices in a medical building. When a patient calls for an appointment they are asked if they wish to see a specific doctor. If the answer is no, they are asked if they prefer a male or female doctor. If there is no preference, they are then scheduled for the next available slot. The five people on the staff work quite cooperatively. There is a very complete library in the conference room along with a well stocked pharmacy. If difficulty is encountered with a specific case, the staff gets together and talks it out - going through repertories and exchanging information about similar cases. The quality of patient care seemed to be very high and the educational opportunities for the staff were considered invaluable.\n\nDECEMBER 30 FRESNO, CALIFORNIA\n\nSANDY FREEMAN\n\nFresno, California\n\nA small - 5 person - study group. They all use Richard Hiltner, MD in Ojai, California.\n\nJANUARY 3 LAGUNA NIGUEL, CALIFORNIA\n\nGERALD SLATTERY, DO\n\nLaguna Niguel, California\n\nGerry was at the Millersville professional course in 1980. We talked about the trip I've been on, the people I've seen, and the crosses between homoeopathic and osteopathic approaches to health.\n\nJANUARY 5-8 1982 LOS ANGELES AREA, CALIFORNIA\n\nNATRA-BIO\n\nSanta Monica, California\n\nMeeting with William Pinkerson. Natra-Bio is one of the newer companies making homoeopathic combination remedies. They all come as drops. The packaging is beautiful. They have displays in almost every health food store I've been to. They are in the position of turning many people on to homoeopathy simply because of their public exposure. I recommended that they get in touch with the American Association of Homoeopathic Pharmacists. We discussed the question of educating both the people that sell it and the people that use it.\n\nALAN FLORENCE\n\nInglewood, California\n\nAlan had taught the lay course at Millersville several years ago. We spent the evening talking about it all.\n\nSTANDARD HOMEOPATHIC PHARMACY\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nA full tour of the facility by Tariq Kuraishy and Jack Craig. Many CALMS being made. Drums of milk sugar stacked to the ceiling. A very impressive operation. Spent much time talking to Tariq - the information I culled is in Part II. Laren Bays dropped in for a visit. Tariq talked about taking time off - which he did. He is now at:\n\nTARIQ KURAISHY\n\nLas Vegas, Nevada\n\nLAREN BAYS, ND\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nStandard Homeopathic is still operating. It is under the guidance of Mark Phillips and Jay Borneman.\n\nTariq Kuraishy went to work for Dolisos in Nevada for a while.\n\nHe is now a private consultant.\n\nALLAN C. NEISWANDER, MD\n\nAlhambra, California\n\nAn informative afternoon discussing the politics of the homoeopathic movement.\n\nRICHARD NISSOTTI\n\nRedondo Beach, California\n\nA fine prescriber on the non-medical (a better term than lay, lle felt) level. He has a very deep understanding of the problems which are facing the homoeopathic movement. The discussion with him clarified many issues in my mind - all of which are talked about in Part II.\n\nJANUARY 15-31 ALBUQUERQUE/SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO\n\nKARL ROBINSON, MD\n\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico\n\nI spent two weeks sitting in on Karl's practice. Many interesting cases - some simple, some complex. I learned a lot from him. In the spaces between, we talked about homoeopathic philosophy and the status of homoeopathic practice in the USA. He introduced me to two people:\n\nLARRY MARRICH, DC\n\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico\n\nLarry is currently studying with Dean Crothers in the West Coast IFH course. He has spent time working with Karl.\n\nPAT STRIBLING\n\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico\n\nPat studied with Karl Robinson and George Vithoulkas. She is working with a doctor in Albuquerque. She introduced me to:\n\nBEN HOLE, MD\n\nOrinda, California\n\nAnother Vithoulkas trained Homoeopath.\n\nR L. WELBORN, DO\n\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico\n\nHe has a most unconventional way of looking at homoeopathy. I speak more about it in Part II.\n\nCHARLES BERNAERT, ND\n\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico\n\nTrained in Germany. He expressed a great interest in trading information with other practitioners. His training, for the most part, was with combination remedies and low potencies.\n\nRICHARD MOSKOWITZ, MD\n\nSanta Fe, New Mexico\n\nA beautiful office in an old adobe building. He is a collector of old homoeopathic books and remedies - both of which line the walls of his office. I spent the evening telling him of my travels. He enlisted my help in organizing a lay group in the area:\n\nYVONNE SPITZ\n\nSanta Fe, New Mexico\n\nI attended two organizational meetings with 12 people.\n\nFEBRUARY 3-4 DALLAS TEXAS\n\nTEXAS HAHNEMANNIAN HOMOEOPATHIC ASSOCIATION\n\nPattie Sue Shoaf, President\n\nDallas, Texas\n\nI had dinner with the three officers of the group: Pattie Sue, Mary Volz, and Kate Millett. We discussed the politics of the NCH/AFH split and the background of the problems which they felt led to their separation from both organizations. The group is quite large-well over 150 members. They are trying to get a doctor to move to Dallas - and it looks like Bob Schore might be making the move. Many of the issues in Part II were discussed.\n\nJAMES HILL, DO\n\nDuncanville, Texas\n\nA graduate of Millersville a few years back.\n\nFEBRUARY 8-13 AUSTIN, TEXAS\n\nH.E.A.L. (Homoeopathic Educational Association for Lay People) Coy Glass\n\nAustin, Texas\n\nA very busy five days. There is a good sized homoeopathic lay group in the area. The first night was an introductory lecture with 42 people attending. I had the pleasure of meeting:\n\nMYRNA PONCE DE LEON\n\n319 West Huisache\n\nSan Antonio, Texas 78212\n\nThe editor of the IFH Newsletter.\n\nFor the rest of the week, I met with a group each night and discussed the following topics:\n\nTUESDAY: The status of Homoeopathy in the USA; WEDNESDAY: Homoeopathic treatment of pets, children, and the elderly; THURSDAY: The miasms and allergies; FRIDAY: Homoeopathic pharmacy; Immunizations.\n\nIt was a very busy week. Much information was exchanged.\n\nFEBRUARY 16-17 HOUSTON, TEXAS\n\nSELIC SOROKA, MD\n\nHouston, Texas\n\nI had been given his name by Dick Moskowitz. As I moved through Texas, he was mentioned in both Dallas and Austin. He was trained in Argentina by Paschero. His practice in homoeopathy is small - only one day a week. He also maintains an allopathic practice. He is hoping that he can phase out the allopathic office. A most informative visit.\n\nLUANNE HANSEN\n\nHouston, Texas\n\nLuanne is starting a lay group in the area. Her background in homoeopathy came through Eleanor Johnson in Michigan. Many of the questions raised in Part II concerning education were the result of our conversation. The meeting was attended by 5 people.\n\nFEBRUARY 26-27 NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA\n\nWENDY RUE\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\nWendy attended Millersville several years ago. She has organized a small lay group. I spoke to 12 people.\n\nJIM KUSICK\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\nDoes nutritional counselling. Interested in Homoeopathy.
