One of the most popular of all the popular genres on which Hollywood production was based, for many people its combination of music, sophisticated production values, song and dance epitomised the glamour and appeal of Hollywood. Musicals showcased, in ways few other films could rival, the remarkable resources and depth of talent in the major studios. As other film industries across the world developed and converted to sound, musicals, with their direct emotional and sensuous appeal, became a feature of more and more national cinemas, sometimes beginning in imitation of Hollywood but developing into diverse cultural forms. In the US, the production of musicals declined markedly from the 1960s; the genre has frequently seemed on the point of extinction (rather like the Western, which underwent a parallel decline). But among the smaller number of musicals produced, there have been enormous hits from time to time, as though the appeal of what they can offer remains there to be tapped. At the same time, the affection for musicals of the studio period – available for home viewing now as never before – appears undimmed. What the musical is, how it works, what it does, have been the subject of considerable debate in the last thirty years or so, and studies of the genre, as well as reference books and varied celebrations of musicals, their studios, makers and stars, continue to proliferate. This introduction touches on some of the analytical approaches that have marked out the critical terrain, and reference to critical approaches recur in the entries on individual films. We hope that the 100 films we have\n\nHillier & Pye Intro\n\n2\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:22 pm\n\nPage 2\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\nselected for this BFI Screen Guide will also provide insights into the development and variety of the genre, both in Hollywood, its dominant tradition, but also in perhaps less familiar forms of the film musical that evolved in other national cinemas. Like all the major film genres, the film musical had a rich prehistory in other cultural forms. In the US, for instance, almost all types of musical performance – including opera, ballet, operetta, vaudeville, revue, the minstrel show, the musical play – ultimately fed the emergence of what became a multifaceted genre. For its first thirty years, however, cinema was ‘silent’. Although screenings were generally accompanied by live music and, from the earliest days of ‘moving pictures’, repeated attempts were made to link picture with recorded sound, there could be no true equivalent on film of these performance traditions. Many films based on musical theatre and performance were produced and famous performers filmed during the ‘silent’ period but the film musical could emerge only when technology enabled the reliable synchronisation of sound and image. As soon as movies could ‘talk’, they also sang. In the tangled evolution of competing technologies for synchronising sound and image and the gradual investment in sound equipment for exhibition venues that characterised the early years of the sound era, the new medium might have been named ‘the talkies’ but music was just as central to its appeal. As Hollywood prepared itself for sound, studios facilitated the complex process by investing in the recording and radio industries as well as in music publishing, which brought them the rights to swathes of popular music. Musical shorts of well-known singers were produced in large numbers from 1926, as well as others featuring bands, orchestras and dance. The film often regarded as the great breakthrough for sound cinema, the hybrid 1927 Warner Bros. feature, The Jazz Singer* – over 60 per cent of which is ‘silent’ – is more notable for Al Jolson’s singing than for its dialogue (though it is salutary to remember that many more people watched its first release as an entirely silent film than saw it in theatres equipped for sound). A good deal of the experimentation – both\n\nHillier & Pye Intro\n\n21/3/11\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n3:22 pm\n\nPage 3\n\n3\n\ntechnological and aesthetic – that Hollywood film-makers undertook as they worked out how sound films could be made was devoted to finding various ways of incorporating music and musical performance into feature films. Narrative had become massively the focus of film production in the US, as well as in most film industries internationally, well before the feature-length film became its dominant form. In the early years of sound, some films were made that followed the structure of theatrical revue – a series of more or less unconnected star performances and musical spectacles – and this remained an intermittent feature of the Hollywood musical, less in the form of revue (though see Ziegfeld Follies*) than in the form of films in which narrative was tangential to, or a pretext for, varied musical numbers (see, for instance, Anchors Aweigh*, Stormy Weather*, The Girl Can’t Help It*). But in line with the industry mainstream, the emergent film musical became predominantly a narrative genre in which the main characters (and often many of the minor ones) sang and danced, and varied relationships between narrative action and musical number came to characterise different forms of the musical. In ‘backstage’ or (to use Rick Altman’s term) ‘show’ musicals, numbers tended to be confined to the theatrical venues in which the characters earned their livings (see, for instance, 42nd Street*, Gold Diggers of 1933*, Footlight Parade*). In the ‘integrated’ musical, there was no rigid demarcation between the two realms of performance and narrative action: characters could break into song and dance in their apartments, in the street, or anywhere that the impulse struck them, as though it was the most natural thing in the world, usually accompanied by full orchestra (see Top Hat*, Meet Me in St. Louis*, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers* and many more in this book). Some films mixed the integrated format with numbers performed on stage (The Band Wagon* or Easter Parade*, for instance) and/or on camera (Anchors Aweigh*, Singin’ in the Rain*). Negotiating the relationships between narrative and number and between various levels of artifice became second nature to the musical.\n\nHillier & Pye Intro\n\n4\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:22 pm\n\nPage 4\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\nThe show musical and the many other films set wholly or partly in the varied worlds of live entertainment point to one of many ways in which the Hollywood musical remained marked by its theatrical inheritance. Paradoxically, for a medium defined by recording and mechanical reproduction of both sound and image and therefore the separation of performer and spectator, the image and associations of live performance (performers in the presence of an audience) remained crucial to many musicals. It is as though, in Jane Feuer’s words, ‘The Hollywood musical becomes a mass art which aspires to the condition of a folk art …’ (1982), drawing sustenance from an experience that cinema inherently denies. Celebration of the show by an audience in the film’s world is invariably the climax of a backstage story; even in non-showbiz settings, numbers will often be staged in such a way as to facilitate or mimic immediate connection with the spectator via direct address to the camera, in ways that were anathema to most other narrative films. Some integrated musicals drew directly on the conventions of theatrical operetta, in which score and story are intertwined. A number of operettas were adapted for the screen (see The Merry Widow*, Naughty Marietta*), while the elegant European settings and the musical styles of operetta were adopted by a range of other musicals, especially in the early years of the genre (see, among others, The Love Parade*, Love Me Tonight*). But the development of musical comedy and of the indigenous Broadway musical became increasingly influential. In the 1920s and 30s, George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart and others developed the styles that came to dominate American popular song and the Hollywood musical from the mid-30s on. The hugely successful RKO films starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers (see Flying Down to Rio*, The Gay Divorcee*, Top Hat*, Swing Time*) draw some of their settings from the elegant world of operetta but are basically musical comedies with predominantly American characters singing and dancing to the music of Porter, Berlin, Kern and Gershwin. Show Boat (1927), with Kern’s music and Oscar Hammerstein II’s adaptation of Edna Ferber’s novel, was a key moment in the\n\nHillier & Pye Intro\n\n21/3/11\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 5\n\n5\n\ndevelopment of the musical play – ‘book’ (i.e. story), score and numbers integrated into a dramatic whole – and also on the eventual direction of the film musical. Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Oklahoma! (1942) completed the process of integrating all the elements of musical theatre, songs and also dances written and designed to advance the story and develop the characters. Although it was twelve years before a screen version of Oklahoma! appeared, the show’s integrated approach and Agnes de Mille’s choreography, with its dream ballet and ensemble numbers that drew on folk and modern dance styles, were major influences on Hollywood musicals of the 1940s and 50s. In the mid1950s, in fact, as the number of original film musicals declined, Hollywood began to rely more and more on adaptations of successful Broadway book musicals (see, for example, Oklahoma!*, Carousel*, The Pajama Game*, The Sound of Music*). In the US and Great Britain, until well into the second half of the twentieth century, cultural status often seemed in inverse proportion to mass appeal. In an extreme version of the disdain accorded to most Hollywood films by critics and theorists, musicals were largely taken at face value, their frothy concoctions of song, dance, extravagant design and inconsequential stories – the very epitome of trivial light entertainment – self-evidently unworthy of serious study. As a result, systematic critical analysis of the musical began relatively late. Even when, in the 1960s – partly inspired by French critical journals like Cahiers du cinéma and Positif – new writers began seriously to analyse and evaluate the achievements of Hollywood directors and genres, the musical remained initially on the sidelines. Male action genres – especially the Western – were the focus of attention in the first wave of Englishlanguage genre theory in the 1960s and early 70s. The assumptions – and their gendered basis – underpinning these choices and wider questions of taste and value only began to be challenged as the 1970s progressed. Scattered essays that began to look systematically at musicals appeared in the 1970s, but it was the 80s before the formative booklength studies of the Hollywood musical by Rick Altman (1981, 1987),\n\nHillier & Pye Intro\n\n6\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 6\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\nJane Feuer (1982), and Bruce Babington and Peter Evans (1985) appeared. In this respect, the musical shares something of the critical history of melodrama, another central tendency in Hollywood cinema that became visible to film criticism and theory in the 1970s, particularly through approaches to the development and ideological significance of cultural forms and approaches to representation informed by feminism. Perhaps the most influential of the 1970s essays, Richard Dyer’s ‘Entertainment and Utopia’ (1977), focused directly on the concept of entertainment itself, challenging its self-evident status and asking how and why entertainment works: in specific cultural and historical contexts, what is it in us and in the culture that leads us to take pleasure in ‘showbiz’ forms? Responding to the sensuous and affective appeal of the musical, Dyer analysed the genre in terms both of its ‘representational’ and its ‘non-representational’ dimensions – not just its stars, stories, situations but also ‘colour, texture, movement, rhythm, melody, camerawork’, qualities fundamental to musicals but particularly difficult to discuss. Dyer therefore tackled head-on the very characteristics of the musical that had made it so resistant to analysis and so inimical to cultural commentators (as well as so popular). In 1976, Robin Wood – reflecting new currents in film and cultural theory – wrote that the Hollywood genres can be seen as ‘different strategies for dealing with the same ideological tensions’ (Wood, 1989). The writers who opened up the musical to considered analysis took similar positions on the function of genres in dramatising the conflicting needs, anxieties and values that are deeply embedded in our culture, more often than not appearing to ‘deal with’ them by resolving contradictions in an affirmative ending. For Dyer, the ‘escapism’ or ‘wish fulfilment’ often attributed to entertainment points to its central function – to offer ‘utopian’ solutions to lacks and needs in people’s lives. In dramatising qualities of ‘energy, abundance, intensity, transparency, community’, musicals enable us to sense what utopian solutions to exhaustion, scarcity, dreariness, manipulation, isolation, might feel like. Dyer is very aware of the social complexities of race, class and gender\n\nHillier & Pye Intro\n\n21/3/11\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 7\n\n7\n\nthat his categories do not directly address, but the strength of his approach was that it offered one explanation of ‘why entertainment works’. Films, he argued, work through contradictions in various ways, including in the varied relationships between narrative and numbers, which also indicated contrasting approaches to utopian dreams. Some musicals separate them rigidly so that numbers represent a utopian escape from the realities of the characters’ problems (Gold Diggers of 1933*); in others (Dyer cites Funny Face*), numbers integrated into the narrative represent temporary escapes from or potential solutions to the conflicts experienced by the characters; and in his final, less common, category, the film suggests that ‘utopia is implicit in the world of the narrative as well as in the world of the numbers’ (his example is On the Town*). For Jane Feuer, too, ‘community’ becomes an ideal in her thesis about the musical’s attempt to compensate for the alienation of mass communication. In ways that we touched on earlier, she ingeniously unpicked the varied and sometimes contradictory strategies musicals used both to tap into the potent associations of live entertainment and yet to exploit the freedoms that only film can offer. Rick Altman, in what remains the seminal study of the American film musical (1987), is also committed to an ideological analysis of musicals: in his case, as a form of ritual, ‘a cultural problem-solving device’, which works through ‘problematic dichotomies for society’ and brings about ‘a more workable configuration, a concordance of opposites’. In particular, Altman identifies in the Hollywood musical not the familiar linear development of ‘classical narrative’, but a ‘dual-focus’ structure in which scenes featuring the man and woman who will form the romantic couple appear in alternation, setting up a process of comparison and contrast which leads ultimately to the dichotomies being resolved through the promise of marriage. These influential writers also have in common a commitment to analysing musicals as a whole, identifying their characteristic structures, approaches and concerns and how their various features interact to\n\nHillier & Pye Intro\n\n8\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 8\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\nproduce meaning and affect. Character, narrative, fictional world and the ways in which these are realised become not mere frameworks for musical spectacle but the centre of attention, in relation to which musical numbers take on their significance. Altman’s study, in particular, offers sophisticated and detailed analysis of the syntactical and semantic features of the American musical, which he divides into three traditions, the ‘fairy tale’, ‘folk’ and ‘show’ musicals – categories that have become essential reference points in writing about the musical (and that appear throughout this book). Altman’s argument for the centrality of a dual-focus narrative and of the romantic couple in the history of the Hollywood musical have been challenged by a number of writers (see, for instance, Steve Neale, 2000) as too exclusive and tending to marginalise certain kinds of musical (like The Wizard of Oz*, or Ziegfeld Follies*). With such doubts in mind, it is a rewarding exercise to see how far the dual-focus approach works in particular cases. But the place of heterosexual romance in the musical can hardly be exaggerated and a good deal of writing since the 1980s has focused wholly or in part on representations of gender in the genre (see Babington and Evans, 1985; Steven Cohan, 2002), as it has on the parallel traditions of romantic comedy (see, for example, Kathrina Glitre, 2006). In the excellent analysis of Easter Parade* with which Babington and Evans open their detailed study of individual musicals, for instance, they make the modest but significant claim that ‘While it may not, at a deep level, seriously question, as Viridiana emphatically does, the roles men and women are expected to play both in private and in public, Easter Parade frequently shows the struggles of characters fitting into their ideological roles.’ Many musicals take the form of romantic comedy, and the central motif of the making of a heterosexual couple allows for all sorts of variations in the way in which images of masculinity and femininity are played out in relation to traditional assumptions about gender. The re-education Fred Astaire’s character undergoes in Easter Parade* is far from unique, and some musicals (see, for example, The Pirate*) go further in probing the possibility of equality within the couple.\n\nHillier & Pye Intro\n\n21/3/11\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 9\n\n9\n\nAs the 1950s progressed, these issues – always potentially fraught but generally contained within the conventions of comedy – appeared in more openly problematic forms in Hollywood musicals that veered into the terrain of melodrama (see, for instance, Carousel*, A Star Is Born*, Love Me or Leave Me*). While contested gender roles and patterns of representation became central to analysis of a number of Hollywood genres from the 1970s – associated with discussions of how far Hollywood movies might be seen to question ideological norms – race remained much less examined until the 1990s and beyond. The deep-rooted racism that produced demeaning and stereotypical representations of AfricanAmericans and other ethnic groups across the whole of Hollywood cinema affected the musical as much as other genres. The marginalisation of African-Americans in the musical was all the more striking given the vital contributions of minstrelsy and jazz to the emergence of the standard popular song forms which constituted the mainstay of Broadway and movie musicals. In recent years, significant studies have appeared, looking, for instance, at the use of blackface in performance traditions and in musicals (see The Jazz Singer* and Show Boat* among others), at the place of black performers such as Bill ‘Bojangles’ Robinson (see The Littlest Rebel*, Swing Time*) and the appropriation of African-American musical forms. Writers such as Arthur Knight (2002) and Susan Smith (2005) have looked in detail at traditions represented in this book by a number of ‘black cast’ Hollywood musicals, including Hallelujah!*, Cabin in the Sky*, Stormy Weather* and Carmen Jones*. This is a growing area of work that examines what is on the whole a disreputable history but also probes some of what Smith calls ‘strains of resistance’ and ‘strategies of subversion’. Since the 1960s, Hollywood musicals have become more racially integrated. Curiously, the 1970s produced several all- (or mostly) black musicals, such as Car Wash* and The Wiz (1978), though in a very different social context. By the mid-1950s, the Hollywood studio musical was clearly in decline. Broadway adaptations were becoming more common; the studio\n\nHillier & Pye Intro\n\n10\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 10\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\nsystem in which production, distribution and exhibition had been integrated was breaking up, with the consequent decline in its large contracted labour forces; rock and roll burst onto the scene in 1956; in 1957, Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly starred in their last major musicals. Threading through this period were also the darker currents just referred to. Michael Wood (1975), writing about a change of mood in MGM musicals that he located especially in It’s Always Fair Weather*, argued that ‘By the mid-fifties in America, it seemed impossible to break into song and dance, even metaphorically …’, that the confidence that had sustained the earlier MGM musical had evaporated and that ‘… when your confidence is gone, the musical goes too. You can’t like yourself, and it’s never fair weather.’ The forms of the Hollywood musical dominated much of the production of musicals in other countries. In the 1930s, for example, Britain and Germany both made movies designed to compete in international markets with the Hollywood product (see, for example, Evergreen*, Der Kongress tanzt*) while at the same time making films aimed much more obviously at home markets (see, for example, Sing as We Go*, Come on George!*). Other national cinemas, in India, Egypt, Mexico and Japan, for example, though clearly influenced by Hollywood in their taste for spectacle, developed more independently, drawing on their own traditions of music, song and dance (see Afrita Hanem*, Ansiedad*, Janken musume*). In Indian cinema, western generic distinctions – Western, gangster, comedy, musical – applied much less and Indian popular films tended to mix together different kinds of ‘generic’ material within individual films, virtually all of which incorporated song and dance (see, for example, Shree 420*, Pyaasa*, Pakeezah*, Sholay*, Dil se …*). In addition, Indian cinema adopted the convention by which star actors mimed to ‘playback singers’, whose celebrity could match that of the stars. Indian popular cinema continued to thrive from the 1960s onwards as Hollywood production (and notably the production of musicals) declined, without ever disappearing. Though ‘old style’ musicals\n\nHillier & Pye Intro\n\n21/3/11\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 11\n\n11\n\ncontinued to be made occasionally, and could be very successful (see, for instance, Mary Poppins*, The Sound of Music*), other Hollywood musicals became more reflective, consciously acknowledging the classic musicals of the past (see, for example, Nashville*, New York, New York*, One from the Heart*, or later co-productions like Moulin Rouge!*). At the same time, Hollywood became more responsive to changing trends in popular music, as the major audience for movies got younger (see, for instance, Saturday Night Fever*, Grease*). The decline of the classic Hollywood musical also had the effect of stimulating experimentation with musical conventions outside Hollywood: in Europe, Jacques Demy essayed a modern operetta form in the wholly sung Les Parapluies de Cherbourg*, though many denied it the status of ‘musical’ for its lack of distinction between narrative and ‘numbers’. Films like Demy’s later Les Demoiselles de Rochefort*, Chantal Akerman’s Golden Eighties*, François Ozon’s 8 femmes*, Alain Resnais’s Pas sur la bouche* and Lars von Trier’s Dancer in the Dark* more consciously referenced the classical Hollywood musical. This is a book about film musicals – musicals made for theatrical distribution (although, of course, since the 1960s, television broadcasts have provided important revenue streams for all theatrical features). However, it would be as much a mistake not to take account of the relationship of television to the musical as it would be to ignore the relationships between film musicals and the theatre. The ending of the Hollywood studio system coincided roughly with the rise of television in the US (and, of course, many have seen in that a causal connection). In the 1930s and 40s, radio made extensive use of Broadway and vaudeville artists and songs, as well as adapting popular films, and it was always likely that television would take on some of the functions and formats established by the Hollywood studios as well as developing its own emphases. In terms of its relationship to ‘the musical’, television has occupied a slightly uncertain space somewhere between Broadway and Hollywood, but it has certainly played a major role in preserving the musical as a significant genre.\n\nHillier & Pye Intro\n\n12\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 12\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\nAs film musicals became less frequent in the 1950s, so television began to expand its own production, in several distinct ways. As well as tribute shows to Broadway composers and lyricists, television utilised their talents to produce original musicals, favouring particularly musicals based on fairy tales, such as CBS’s Cinderella (1957), with songs by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein and starring Julie Andrews; ABC’s The Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood (1965), with songs by Jule Styne and Robert Merrill and starring Liza Minnelli; and NBC’s Jack and the Beanstalk (1967), directed by and starring Gene Kelly, with songs by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen. The operetta tradition was continued in productions like Naughty Marietta (NBC, 1955), The Merry Widow (NBC, 1955) and Gilbert and Sullivan productions. More important were television adaptations of Broadway shows and (occasionally) Hollywood musicals: Anything Goes (ABC, 1954), Annie Get Your Gun (NBC, 1957), Kiss Me Kate (NBC, 1958), Meet Me in St. Louis (CBS, 1959), The Jazz Singer (NBC, 1959), Brigadoon (ABC, 1966), Carousel (ABC, 1967), George M! (CBS, 1972), and many more. One of the effects of such shows was to provide big Broadway stars like Ethel Merman, Mary Martin and Carol Burnett with some of the widespread exposure which had eluded them in movies. In more recent years, with the fragmentation of broadcasting and cable, PBS has taken a major role in presenting Broadway adaptations, such as Show Boat (1989), Cats (1998) and productions of Stephen Sondheim’s Broadway shows. More originally, television has tried out, though without much success in most cases, episodic musical television series, several of which grew out of successful theatrical movies: That’s Life (ABC) ran for a single season in 1968–9; Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (CBS) ran for twenty-two episodes in 1982–3; Dirty Dancing (CBS) ran for just a few episodes in 1988–9; Steven Bochco’s Cop Rock (ABC) lasted only eleven episodes and Hull High (NBC) (see High School Musical*) only eight in 1990. The only significantly successful show was Fame (MGM Television for NBC), based on the 1980 film, which ran from 1982 to 1987. Alongside such experiments, a tradition emerged in which successful non-musical sitcoms\n\nHillier & Pye Intro\n\n21/3/11\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 13\n\n13\n\nand other shows featured the occasional musical episode, from I Love Lucy (1956) and the Dick Van Dyke Show (1963) to Happy Days (1971, 1981) to Chicago Hope (1997), Xena: Warrior Princess (2000), Ally McBeal (2000), Buffy the Vampire Slayer (2001) and Oz (2005). Just as Disney has maintained since the 1930s (see Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs*) a special commitment to the theatrical animated musical, spectacularly so in the string of 1990s hits like Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), so it has mined a vein of live-action juvenile musical television films, like The Cheetah Girls (2003) (and its sequels) and the Hannah Montana series (starting in 2006, feature film 2009). Though very popular, none achieved the phenomenal success of the 2006 Disney Channel television movie High School Musical* and its three sequels, which in turn spawned more challenging and innovative musical series like 20th Century-Fox Television’s Glee (first broadcast in 2009). Steven Bochco, the creator of Cop Rock, acknowledged the influence of Dennis Potter’s BBC television mini-series Pennies from Heaven (1978) and The Singing Detective (1986). Potter opened up new possibilities for the musical form by having characters mime to 1930s/40s recordings of popular songs and used the same format, with recordings of 50s popular songs, in Lipstick on Your Collar (made for Channel 4, 1993). Like Potter’s work, Peter Bowker’s mini-series Blackpool (2004) and Viva Blackpool (2006), made for BBC Television, also used characters miming to popular records. Although Pennies from Heaven was adapted as a Hollywood feature (directed by Herbert Ross, 1981), few Hollywood or British film musicals have followed Potter’s lead, though his influence is evident in films like Alain Resnais’s On connait la chanson (1997) and forms part of a wider pattern of experimentation with musical conventions. Last, but certainly not least, we should note the pervasive influence since the 1980s of MTV and musical television as a whole on the visual presentation of popular music, an influence already apparent in movie musicals as early as Flashdance (1983) and Footloose* and a major context for more recent films like Moulin Rouge!*.\n\nHillier & Pye Intro\n\n14\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 14\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\nAbout the book Given the history of the musical and the nature of the debates that have circulated about it, it was perhaps inevitable that just over half of our entries are products of the major Hollywood studios and were made in the years between the coming of sound and 1960, generally regarded as the core period for the production of musicals. Though these films form the cornerstone of the book, a third of the entries come from the period after 1960 and almost a third were made outside the US. No doubt many of our titles would find their way onto numerous lists of ‘best’ musicals, but the intention has been to give prominence not only to ‘classics’ but also to films which represent different tendencies within the genre and those made outside the Hollywood studio norms. Availability on DVD (in one region or another) and/or regular circulation on terrestrial or cable television was an additional criterion for choice: reading about films that one is unable to see can be frustrating. At the same time, there remain a few titles here that are not readily available to see or buy or rent. Perhaps this volume will encourage distributors to make some of these titles available. Each entry aims to identify what is distinctive about a particular film and relate it to some of the major debates about the musical genre. In addition, entries try to provide some historical context – for example, the film’s relationship with Broadway shows – and relate it to other films, whether included as entries in the book or not. References to other entries in the book are marked with an asterisk to allow ease of crossreference (although there are certainly more relationships to be made between films than those we highlight). As non-English-language entry titles often have several different official or unofficial English translations, we have entered them under their original titles – which in many cases are the titles they are best known under anyway. Translations are provided within the entry and appear in the index as well as the original title. At the end of each entry we provide a list of production credits. For reasons of space, these credits are selective, but our selection is\n\nHillier & Pye Intro\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 15\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n15\n\nslightly different from those in other volumes in the series. It seemed to us that for a book on musicals, credits for songs, music, art direction and choreography were vital. Credits have been adapted in several cases to take some account of different modes of production. We follow the Screen Guide convention of including the director’s name immediately under the entry title. However, this should not be taken to imply that we necessarily consider the director of a particular film to be the major, or only significant, influence on the way it turns out, as a number of our entries make clear. The book includes two appendices: References This lists all books and essays that we refer to in the Introduction and the individual entries. For the sake of readability, we decided against a formal academic annotation system, but this list of references should enable readers to readily locate all sources. Further Reading This overlaps with References, but offers a more extensive listing of important English-language books on the film musical.\n\nHillier & Pye Part 1\n\n21/3/11\n\n16\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 16\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\nAfrita Hanem Egypt, 1949 – 112 mins Henri Barakat Egypt, like India, had a busy movie industry from the 1930s and functioned as a sort of Arab Hollywood (or perhaps Bollywood), providing films for the Arabic Middle East and North Africa. The movie industries in ‘less developed’ countries like Egypt, India and Mexico experienced their ‘golden ages’ from the mid-1940s to the mid-60s, a little later than Hollywood, due partly to the later advent of television (though in each case, as everywhere, old movies provided essential television programming). Musicals of one kind or another were a – perhaps the – staple genre in industries dominated, like Hollywood, by studios and stars (see, for example, Shree 420*, Pyaasa*, Ansiedad*). Stars, in Egypt, often meant singing stars like Farid Al Atrache (the ‘sad singer’ and ‘King of the Oud’ [a lute-like instrument]) and Abdel Halim Hafez, established radio and recording stars, and dancers like Samia Gamal (declared by King Farouk in 1949 as Egypt’s ‘national dancer’), and many films were essentially vehicles for their performances (as they often were in Hollywood). Singing stars provided their own voices, as they did in Mexican cinema (in contrast to the ‘playback’ tradition in Indian cinema). Afrita Hanem (known in English variously as The Genie Lady, Lady Genie, Little Miss Devil), a lively, somewhat screwball musical comedy, makes ample space for songs by star/producer/singer/composer Al Atrache and dances by Gamal, whether as stage performances or spontaneous song and dance. Humble stage singer Asfour (Al Atrache) pines after gold-digging dancer Aleya (Lola Sedki), who plans to marry a wealthy man to finance her theatre-owner father. Asfour discovers a magic lamp whose genie, Kahramana (Gamal), visible only to him, claims they were lovers a millennium earlier. Bound to grant his wishes, she is nevertheless determined to thwart his pursuit of Aleya. Granted his wish for a theatre of his own, Asfour auditions the dancer Semsema, identical\n\nHillier & Pye Part 1\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 17\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n17\n\nto the genie but very much flesh and blood and visible to everyone. After various comic misadventures, Asfour ‘summons up’ Kahramana/ Semsema and, after passing through an expressionist netherworld (which may or may not be part of a stage show) whose lugubrious ‘sultan’/Lucifer grants the couple their freedom, love reigns supreme. Farid Al Atrache performs some celebrated poetic songs (in the – to western ears – rather mournful, recitative Arab style) and Samia Gamal’s raqs sharqi (Oriental dance) routines (misleadingly known in the West as ‘belly dance’) are captivatingly sexy, but perhaps the chief pleasure is Gamal’s infectious comic performance, as Kahramana uninhibitedly enjoys the chaotic fun she unleashes. Certainly, Gamal seems more at ease here than in high melodramas like A Glass and a Cigarette (1955) (though, as in many Indian films, the melodrama is paralleled by a comic plotline). Many Egyptian ‘musicals’ were (like Indian films) essentially melodramas, like Days and Nights (1955), a vehicle for young heart-throb singer Abdel Halim Hafez. Running through all these films (as through so many Indian films), exploring moral dilemmas in bourgeois family settings, is a discourse in which western modernity – cars, clothes, manners – is viewed negatively in relation to traditional values. The sage who presides over the genie in Afrita Hanem pops up from time to time to deliver homilies about materialistic greed and selfishness. Samia Gamal also played in international films: she was an exotic dancer (of course) in the Hollywood film Valley of the Kings (1954), shot partly in Egypt, and co-starred with Fernandel in Jacques Becker’s Moroccan-shot Ali Baba et les quarante voleurs (1954).

Ballets invariably offered opportunities to display the star dancers’ virtuosity, but their stylised nature also enabled them to enact disturbed dreams or fantasies. The ‘American in Paris’ ballet begins with a desolate Jerry (Gene Kelly) thinking he has lost Lise (Leslie Caron in her first film) after their parting at the black-and-white ball, and its several episodes present a parallel version of their relationship in which Lise is lost, found and lost again. What is unique, however, is its combination of length (almost 17 minutes), its position at the end of the film and, most markedly, the ostentatious brilliance of its design and execution. Famously, the Parisian settings are each presented in the style of a different painter (Dufy, Renoir, Utrillo, Rousseau, Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec), but the ballet as a whole is characterised by Minnelli’s dazzling integration of the self-consciously sophisticated designs with Gershwin’s music, Kelly’s elaborately varied choreography and John Alton’s unorthodox use of limited lighting. The ballet is a fitting climax to a musical that was emphatically designed to impress. Perhaps as a result, An American in Paris is a film of mixed pleasures. Some of the most elaborate numbers are in effect, like the ballet, splendid set pieces, tied only minimally to the narrative: Adam (Oscar Levant)’s ingeniously created fantasy in which he becomes pianist, conductor, the whole orchestra and the audience in Gershwin’s Concerto in F; the Folies Bergère-inspired staging of Henri Bourel (Georges Guétary) singing ‘I’ll Build a Stairway to Paradise’; even ‘I’ve Got Rhythm’, Jerry’s English lesson for a crowd of kids, although set in the street, has something of this quality. On the other hand, some of the most delightful numbers arise unaffectedly from situation and setting in the\n\nHillier & Pye Part 1\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 19\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n19\n\nlovely studio-built recreation of Paris (the film’s opening evokes the famous introduction to Paris in Love Me Tonight*). ‘Melody by Strauss’ begins with Adam casually playing the piano and leads to Jerry dancing with the elderly ladies of the neighbourhood café; much later, Jerry and Henri, unwittingly both in love with Lise, burst into ‘’S Wonderful’ and a dance double act in the same location; on the banks of the Seine, Jerry sings ‘Our Love Is Here to Stay’ to Lise and they dance tentatively together for the first time. Their romance, however, like much of the plot, seems largely taken for granted. There is no significant development in the relationship from the moment that Lise’s initial resistance to Jerry abruptly crumbles. Strangely enough, more fully developed – and distinctly uncomfortable – is Jerry’s relationship with the needy but vulnerable Milo Roberts (Nina Foch), the American heiress who is fostering (and funding) his painting. The insensitivity and opportunism of his treatment of Milo are fascinating disturbances in the film’s presentation of Jerry that her withdrawal from the scene and the film’s romantic resolution cannot entirely erase. An American in Paris was a triumph for the studio: it not only grossed over $6 million more than its very considerable $2.7 million budget but it won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. At the same ceremony, both Arthur Freed and Gene Kelly were also honoured individually, Kelly with an Honorary Oscar and Freed with the Irving Thalberg Award for ‘his extraordinary accomplishment in the making of musical pictures’ (Fordin, 1975).

MGM musicals of the 1940s are now associated particularly with the production unit headed by Arthur Freed (see, among others, An American in Paris*, Easter Parade*, Meet Me in St. Louis*, On the Town*, Summer Holiday*) but Pasternak became a key producer, contributing some of the biggest hits of the decade to the studio’s large and profitable output of musicals. In particular, his work with Deanna Durbin made him the obvious person to work with the young soprano Kathryn Grayson, and he became central to the continuing strand of Hollywood musicals featuring operatic voices (he later worked with Mario Lanza on such films as The Toast of New Orleans, 1950, and The Great Caruso, 1951). Anchors Aweigh feels now like an interesting hybrid. Its story of two sailors (Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra in the first of their buddy double acts) on a brief shore leave, meeting girls and falling in love, looks forward to On the Town. (In fact, the waitress from Brooklyn [Pamela Britton] that Clarence [Sinatra] eventually falls for even seems to anticipate Betty Garrett’s much more developed role as Hildy in that film.) When their leave is derailed by a little boy (Dean Stockwell) who wants to join the navy and whom they have to escort home, they meet his Aunt Susie (Grayson), a movie extra and aspiring singer. First Clarence and then Joe (Kelly) fall for Susie, and much of the plot turns on their attempts (in echoes of 100 Men and a Girl) to get her an audition with José Iturbi, the pianist and conductor who appeared as himself in several MGM films of this period. With performers split between popular and more classical musical styles, the film has to accommodate widely different numbers. Perhaps inevitably, then, the pleasures of the film come less from the integration of number and narrative that characterises many of the great\n\nHillier & Pye Part 1\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 21\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n21\n\nFreed unit musicals, than from its separate parts. Many of the sixteen numbers are presented with minimal narrative motivation. Most famous is Kelly’s remarkable song and dance (‘The Worry Song’) with Jerry the mouse, a seamless mixture of live action and animation. This springs from a story Joe is telling a group of school kids, and one of Kelly’s later numbers (‘The Mexican Hat Dance’) is performed to and with a little girl (Sharon McManus). Susie amazes Joe and Clarence (and us) with the range and power of her voice when she performs ‘Jealousy’ in the restaurant where she works, and much later, in her screen test, sings to the waltz from Tchaikovsky’s Serenade for Strings, a number staged to reveal much of the technology and many of the personnel of the sound stage. As Clarence, Sinatra has what are in effect three reflective soliloquies, the Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn songs ‘What Makes the Sunset’, ‘The Charm of You’ and ‘I Fall in Love Too Easily’. Iturbi, too, has his own musical interludes, including a performance of Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 with a mass of young pianists in the Hollywood Bowl. Yet the film’s level of energy seems perceptibly to rise in the numbers Sinatra and Kelly share: ‘We Hate to Leave’, performed to Joe and Clarence’s jealous shipmates as the friends prepare to go on leave; ‘I Begged Her’, their boastful account to fellow navy men of their fictitious romantic adventures; and their frenetic ‘improvisation’ of ‘If You Knew Susie’ to frighten off Susie’s dinner date.

During this period, a number of Mexican stars, such as Dolores del Rio, Cantinflas, María Félix, Pedro Armendiaz and Ricardo Montalban, appeared in Hollywood movies and elsewhere. Like Indian, Egyptian and Hollywood cinemas, Mexican cinema relied on genres and stars, with the musical and its stars among the most popular. None were more celebrated than Pedro Infante and Jorge Negrete, both also massively popular recording and radio artists, though neither achieved much fame outside Mexico. Ansiedad (Anxiety), a relatively typical musical from the time, is one of several in which Infante co-starred with ‘Sweetheart of the Americas’ Libertad Lamarque (Argentinian, though most of her films were made in Mexico), also a prolific recording artist. Ansiedad combines the familiar melodrama narrative of twins separated at or near birth and growing up apart until their paths cross dramatically with the familiar musical narrative of singers’ rise to fame and celebrity. Infante plays no fewer than three roles. An unemployed singer, he finds an abandoned baby which falls ill and dies, forcing him, via various complications, to give up one of his own twin baby sons; soon after, he is shot dead. Infante also plays both grown-up sons – Rafael, who has been raised by his singer mother María (Lamarque), and Carlos, who has grown up in a wealthy family. Both Rafael and María rise to fame as singers. Mother and son are exceptionally close, almost like lovers when they sing duets, despite tension caused by María’s big secret about Rafael’s twin. Inevitably, the paths of the mother and the twins cross, and the wealthy, powerful son, taking exception to their humble origins, stands in the way of Rafael’s and María’s careers and private lives.\n\nHillier & Pye Part 1\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 23\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n23\n\nFinally, of course, when the mother is almost fatally shot, the truth comes out and the brothers are reconciled. The film trades heavily on traditional values of family, maternal love, humility and hard work. All the songs except one (Rafael’s drunken duet with María, ‘Ando muy boracho’ [‘I’m Very Drunk’]) are performances of one kind or another. Lamarque gives fine renditions of her trademark tangos, ‘Sus ojos se cerraron’ (‘His Eyes Closed’) and ‘Cuesta abajo’ (‘Downhill’), both by Carlos Gardel. Rafael’s rise to fame allows Infante to sing in several different styles, whether popular ranchera-type songs set to mariachi music (‘Tu recuerdo y yo’ [‘Your Memory and Me’], ‘Amor de mis amores’ [‘Love of All My Loves’]) or more romantic songs like Agustin Lara’s ‘Mujer’ (‘Woman’), which he sings on radio. The film charts Rafael’s and María’s rise to fame in terms of the venues they perform in, from small, humble theatres to larger, more elegant ones, society soirées and television. The extended television studio sequences (‘Farolito’ [‘Little Streetlight’] and ‘Marimba’), involving more ‘American’-style elaborate sets, ballet-style dancers and mobile cameras, are a far cry from Rafael’s simply shot ranchera-style debut in a small, basic theatre. The film was photographed by Gabriel Figueroa, who shot numerous mainstream Mexican pictures as well as John Ford’s 1947 The Fugitive and many of Luis Buñuel’s 1950s/60s Mexican films; Figueroa’s talent for moody, shadowy lighting is put to good use in the film’s night-time exteriors.

It also features 1920s cabaret and Broadway torch singer Helen Morgan (most celebrated for playing Julie LaVerne in the 1927 Broadway and 1936 movie versions of Show Boat*), who sings ‘What Wouldn’t I Do for That Man’. Applause is a classic maternal melodrama, almost in the class of Stella Dallas (1937): Kitty Darling (Morgan), a fading burlesque star, sends her daughter away from the vaudeville world to be educated in a convent but is pressured by her two-timing partner Hitch (Fuller Mellish Jr) to bring her now grown-up daughter April (Joan Peers) into the business. Repulsed by burlesque and the sexual attentions of Hitch, April nevertheless tries to support her mother, taking her place on stage as the abandoned and abused Kitty kills herself. Kitty’s death frees April to leave the business and marry the nice sailor she has met, the couple framed before a Kitty Darling burlesque show poster as the film ends. Mamoulian carried the stylishness and innovation of his work in opera, operetta and Broadway shows through to his movie debut at the coming of sound: ‘Here I had been recruited as a stage expert on dialogue, and all I could think of was the marvellous things one could do with the camera and the exciting new potential of sound recording’ (Sarris, 1971). Applause does give a strong sense of a newcomer experimenting with styles and techniques, some of which work admirably and some of which do not. The opening sequences evoke burlesque’s false glamour and rancid sex appeal: the camera dollies and pans to follow a handbill for Kitty’s show as it is blown along a rundown street; cuts show people rushing as the sound of distant ragtime music grows louder, and then we are in the parade itself; from this sequence, we cut\n\nHillier & Pye Part 1\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:23 pm\n\nPage 25\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n25\n\nto the show in progress via shots of the hard-working band and a lateral track along the ungainly legs of the dancers and their no longer young upper halves. The sentiments of this sequence are strongly amplified later when April, fresh from the convent, is brutally introduced to the world of burlesque, recoiling in disgust amid a rapid montage of grotesque sweaty close-ups of leering male spectators and dancers’ faces, legs and thighs. Mamoulian pushed for innovative uses of sound, insisting, for example, on two microphones (and subsequent track mixing) for a scene in which April quietly prays while her mother hums a lullaby. Less successful are some poorly motivated overhead shots and unduly expressionist uses of shadow and frame composition. While Mamoulian established himself in the 1930s and 40s as an indemand Hollywood movie director (though Applause was shot at New York’s Astoria Studios), he remained active in Broadway theatre, directing a number of important shows, including the all-black Porgy and Bess (1935) and St Louis Woman (1946), as well as the first productions of Oklahoma! (1943) and Carousel (1945). The successful 1970 Betty Comden–Adolph Green Broadway musical Applause (Lauren Bacall’s singing-dancing stage debut) was an adaptation of the 1950 film All About Eve and had nothing to do with the 1929 film.

Twenty-two years later, the song catalogue of Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz, who wrote the numbers for the original revue, became the basis for a film in which Astaire’s age and image are invoked even more overtly than in Easter Parade*. Astaire’s long history is the heart of The Band Wagon’s highly self-conscious reassertion of traditional entertainment values in a time of change. The identification of Tony Hunter (Astaire) with Fred Astaire himself could not be clearer. In the auction of Hollywood memorabilia that opens the film, the iconic top hat and cane of movie song and dance man Hunter fail to sell. Firmly associated with the past, when his train pulls into New York (where Ava Gardner takes all the press attention), Tony’s first number is the introverted ‘By Myself’. In contrast, his second (‘A Shine on Your Shoes’), inspired by an amusement arcade on 42nd Street that has replaced one of the theatres he used to know, is an explosion of spontaneous song and dance that all but takes over the arcade and demonstrates to the film audience how far from finished Tony is. Before that can be made clear in the world of the film, such intrinsically American popular forms are submerged by the transformation of the musical comedy written by Lily and Lester Marton (Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant), into ‘a modern version of Faust’, by the imperious (and British) theatrical superstar, Jeffrey Cordova (Jack Buchanan). Challenged by Cordova to change, Tony is half persuaded by the film’s first version of ‘That’s Entertainment’ that on stage ‘anything can go’. As rehearsals begin, however, Tony is intimidated by dancing with the ballet star Gabrielle Gerard (Cyd Charisse) and increasingly undermined by Cordova’s grandiloquent vision, until finally, in a petulant but painful outburst (‘I’m Mrs Hunter’s little boy, Tony – a song and\n\nHillier & Pye Part 1\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:23 pm\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\nPage 27\n\n27\n\nFred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, ‘Girl Hunt Ballet’\n\ndance man’), he quits. When he and Gaby discover (in one of the genre’s most romantic numbers, ‘Dancing in the Dark’, set in Central Park) that they can actually dance together, Tony returns, but the overpowering artifice of the show lumbers on. After the New Haven opening, the buoyant backers of Cordova’s Faustian folly are transformed into haggard individuals who creep silently out of the theatre. At the ‘wake’ later that night, the forms of entertainment and the communal energy that have been suppressed burst out again in ‘I Love\n\nHillier & Pye Part 1\n\n28\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:24 pm\n\nPage 28\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\nLouisa’, the comic number Lester, Tony and Lily perform to cheer the assembled company. When Tony determines to save the show and artistic pretension is banished, success is suddenly effortless. We see no more rehearsals, as though true entertainment needs no labour – only a succession of vibrant numbers, one for each city on the out-of-town tour: ‘I See a New Sun’ (Gaby), ‘I Guess I’ll Have to Change My Plan’ (Tony and Jeff in top hat and tails), ‘Louisiana Hayride’ (Lily leading the company), and Tony, Lily and Jeff dressed as babies in ‘Triplets’. Finally, on New York opening night, it is the ‘Girl Hunt Ballet’, a parody of a hard-boiled detective story in dance, featuring Tony and Gaby. Apparently abandoned after the show, Tony begins to sing ‘By Myself’ again, only to find the whole company waiting for him on the stage.

Among several award-winning musicals, he directed such shows as Sweet Charity (1966) and Chicago (1975), before adapting Sweet Charity for his 1969 film debut. Cabaret, his second film, based on the 1966 musical play (itself derived from the play I Am a Camera and Christopher Isherwood’s stories of 1930s Berlin), was a prodigious success: among its eight Academy Awards, Fosse won Best Director and Liza Minnelli Best Actress for her remarkable first starring role in a musical. Fosse and scriptwriter Jay Presson Allen made extensive changes to the stage musical. A whole subplot was cut and a new relationship – between Jewish heiress Natalia Landauer (Marisa Berenson) and fortunehunter Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper) – introduced. With the casting of Liza Minnelli, Sally Bowles became American; the show’s American Cliff Bradshaw became unworldly British academic Brian Roberts (Michael York), whose bisexuality is pivotal to the uncertainties of gender and sexual relationships the film introduces in its portrait of cultural confusion and political disorder in 1931 Berlin. The musical structure of the show was radically changed, abandoning the conventions of the integrated musical, in which characters can burst spontaneously into song and dance, for a version of the backstage or show musical: all but one of the film’s numbers are confined to the cabaret of the seedy and transgressive Kit-Kat Klub. Several songs from the show were dropped and new ones introduced, together with an earlier John Kander–Fred Ebb composition, ‘Maybe This Time’. One of the film’s most striking inventions is the intercutting between the club and events outside, so that the numbers, guided by the leering cynicism of the Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey, reprising his Broadway\n\nHillier & Pye Part 2\n\n30\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:26 pm\n\nPage 30\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\nrole), parallel and comment on the action. ‘Maybe This Time’, Sally’s passionate solo to a largely empty club, is intercut with Brian and Sally after they have first made love. The thigh-slapping lederhosen dance is cut against the club-owner being savagely beaten by Nazis. ‘Money, Money, Money’ comes immediately after Sally’s meeting with the immensely wealthy Maximilian (Helmut Griem). The Master of Ceremonies’ ‘Two Ladies’ anticipates the three-way relationship between Sally, Brian and Max; his ‘If You Could See Her with My Eyes’ (‘… she wouldn’t seem Jewish at all’), sung to a gorilla-suited partner, occurs just as Fritz, now in love with Natalia, confesses that he is in fact Jewish too. The club itself becomes the central image of a culture in chaos, a George Grosz-inspired purgatorial vision, vividly created in Fosse’s montage-based style of rapidly juxtaposed angles and scales of shot. By contrast, there is a ringing clarity in the chilling ‘Tomorrow Belongs to Me’, the film’s most lyrical song, sung in the open air by a blond, fresh-faced member of the Hitler Youth. What does the film want us to make of all this? Natalia and Fritz, their love consecrated in their synagogue wedding, appear doomed, yet there is no liberation in the sexual freedom of the other characters. Sally is a role-playing, damaged young woman, endearing but oblivious to what is happening around her; only Brian tries, ineffectually, to take a political stand, though he retreats to his scholarly life in Cambridge. In the final number, ‘Cabaret’, Sally sings that ‘Life is a cabaret, old chum’, affirming her own denial of the wider world. In Cabaret, the show is a moral dead-end in a society that offers no hope.

Minnelli (1974) himself tells us that the film, the first Hollywood musical with an all African-American cast since Hallelujah!*, was a second choice for producer Arthur Freed, made when Porgy and Bess proved unavailable, and he expresses his initial reservations about the story, ‘which reinforced the naive, childlike stereotype of blacks’. If he was going to make it, he writes, he ‘would approach it with great affection and not condescension’. As a project, Cabin the Sky has a good deal in common with Hallelujah! (but makes an interesting contrast with Stormy Weather*). Adapted (with significant changes) from the musical play, the film presents another social world inhabited entirely by black characters and divided between the values of the pious, rural home and the temptations of the town. Again, religious faith is central to the story and the male protagonist is torn between warring impulses, represented by two women who embody opposed paths of virtue and vice. This binary is given emphatic form by the central conceit of Cabin in the Sky, the recurrent presence, unobserved by the human characters, of emissaries from Heaven and Hades who battle for the soul of Little Joe (Eddie ‘Rochester’ Anderson) after he has been shot while gambling, and who agree to give him a further six months of life either to earn salvation or confirm that he belongs in the other place. The film’s comedic register (very different to the intensity of Hallelujah!) is central to Minnelli’s inflection of the stereotypes that had so concerned him and to the avoidance of condescension. If in the human world faith is dignified and prayer a potent force, the supernatural framework is presented, with a range of comic incident, in\n\nHillier & Pye Part 2\n\n32\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:26 pm\n\nPage 32\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\nLena Horne, Eddie ‘Rochester’ Anderson, Ethel Waters, ‘Bubbles’ (John W. Sublett)\n\npredominantly light-hearted terms. The film also inflects the symmetry of the story and challenges its accompanying moral oppositions. Church and saloon are each introduced through sustained camera movements that show us both the individual and communal vitality of the opposed milieus. Church is certainly not too solemn and saloon more celebratory than sinful. In the Paradise saloon, after all, Duke Ellington provides the music and the wonderful Lena Horne plays Georgia Brown, the temptress regarded by Lucifer Jr (Rex Ingram) as one of his own. Although Joe is the focus of the story, his wife Petunia (Ethel Waters) is the heart of the film. Petunia’s prayers call down the forces of Heaven, though her piety is leavened both by her love for the weak-willed Joe and a generous humanity that makes her determination to save him for God remarkably un-repressive. Waters gives one of the great performances in a musical, taking Petunia from modestly dressed traditional housewife, via the initially tentative, then increasingly\n\nHillier & Pye Part 2\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:26 pm\n\nPage 33\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n33\n\nconfident romantic feeling rekindled in ‘Taking a Chance on Love’, to her transformation into the glamorously attired woman, secure in her own sexuality, who arrives in the saloon, sings the song (‘Honey in the Honeycomb’) earlier performed by Georgia Brown and follows it with an improvised dance of free and uninhibited energy. When at the end of the film Joe wakes, thoroughly alarmed and repentant, and it turns out that most of what we have witnessed has been his delirious dream, it is not the adoration of ‘Happiness Is Just a Thing Called Joe’ to which the overjoyed Petunia returns, but the hope of a new start in ‘Taking a Chance on Love’.

The film takes very little from the life of Martha Jane (‘Calamity Jane’) Cannary Burke but the cross-dressing ‘Calamity’ gave Day her meatiest role to date, while several of the Sammy Fain–Paul Francis Webster songs written for the film (notably ‘My Secret Love’, a major hit which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song) became indelibly associated with her. At one level, the narrative of Calamity Jane seems completely normative: the buckskin-clad, unsocialised but exuberant figure of the opening, riding shotgun and singing ‘The Deadwood Stage’, has been transformed by the end into an image of bridal loveliness, all in white. Along the way, Calamity receives lessons in femininity from Katie Brown (Allyn McLerie) in the horribly prim ‘A Woman’s Touch’, as Calamity’s slovenly cabin becomes a home fit for ladies. And yet, as feminist writers re-evaluating Doris Day’s films in the 1980s perceived, all is not quite so simple (Merck, 1980). At the end, Calamity hasn’t entirely relinquished her tomboy feistiness – she has a concealed six-gun in her wedding dress and as the stage leaves she is up on the buckboard as she was at the beginning, though now with her husband, Wild Bill Hickok (Keel), at the reins. More significantly, throughout its length the film has had a great deal of fun with matters of gender and identity. The whole plot turns on mistaken identities, disguise and misdirected affections. Its central metaphor – most literally embodied by the stage of Deadwood’s Golden Garter saloon – is performance. The Frances Farmer hired as the saloon’s star attraction turns out to be Francis Farmer (Dick Wesson), who, to his embarrassment, is initially made to perform as a woman. When Calamity goes to Chicago, she is mistaken for a man; she\n\nHillier & Pye Part 2\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:26 pm\n\nPage 35\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n35\n\nthen returns to Deadwood not with the great star Adelaid Adams (Gale Robbins) but with her maid Katie, who is pretending to be Miss Adams. Bill Hickok swore he would dress as a squaw and carry a papoose if Calamity managed to bring Adelaid Adams to Deadwood, and does just that on Katie’s opening night (the film embodies the casual racism still prevalent in Westerns of the period). In terms of romance, Bill thinks he is in love with Katie (‘My Heart Is Higher Than a Hawk’); Calamity thinks she is in love with Lt Danny Gilmartin (Philip Carey); Calamity and Bill are most often at odds with each other (‘I Can Live without You’), only to discover that they have been self-deceived. Calamity’s ‘Secret Love’ turns out to have been a secret even to her. If at the end the principals have achieved the romantic outcomes they really want, the film’s playfulness with who and what people are or what they might be gently implies that how identities are ordered is less straightforward than convention allows. Day’s terrific performance holds the whole thing together: from raucously exaggerated impersonation of frontier manhood to not entirely feminised bride, she makes Calamity unwittingly the film’s boldest actor. With the end of her Warner Bros. contract in 1954, Doris Day extended her style and dramatic range in films such as Love Me or Leave Me*, Alfred Hitchcock’s The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) and The Pajama Game*; by the end of the decade, with comedies like Pillow Talk (1959), she had become Hollywood’s biggest female star.

It is a Hollywood film that would have been unimaginable fifteen or even ten years earlier. The civil rights and black power movements, along with the wider social and political changes that occurred during the 1960s, provide a necessary context for the emergence of radically different representations of African-Americans in 70s Hollywood, most obviously in ‘blaxploitation’ pictures, aimed at crossover as well as black audiences: for example, crime pictures like Shaft (1971), Superfly (1972) and Truck Turner (1974). Vital to the success of such films were their rhythm and blues/soul soundtracks by artists like Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield, while black music’s growing crossover appeal to mass audiences during the 1960s is an essential further context for Car Wash. The film’s songs, sung mostly by Rose Royce, were written and produced by Norman Whitfield, composer of ‘I Heard It through the Grapevine’ and responsible for many 1960s Tamla Motown hits. Most of the wall-to-wall music in Car Wash is generated by local radio station KGYS and its DJs rather than by characters in the film, though, exceptionally, The Pointer Sisters do perform a cameo song (‘You Gotta Believe’) when they turn up with the charlatan leader of the Church of Divine Economic Spirituality, Reverend Daddy Rich (Richard Pryor); and two of the car-wash workers, Floyd (Darrow Igus) and Lloyd (Otis Day), budding music and dance artistes, rehearse their material – very entertainingly – as they work. Music is vital both to the characters and the rhythm of their work and to the film’s energy: when the car wash’s white owner, Mr B (Sully Boyar), tries to change the channel, he is quickly shouted down. As an ensemble film, no characters are given noticeably more prominence than others and all suggest, more or less, their own\n\nHillier & Pye Part 2\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:26 pm\n\nPage 37\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n37\n\nnarratives, which come together – and sometimes collide – at the car wash. Though the main non-black characters, Mr B, his Mao-spouting son (Richard Brestoff) and the cashier, Marsha (Melanie Mayron), with their lives of quiet desperation, and the young Hispanic and Native American workers are all given their stories, it is the African-American characters who take centre stage. Despite the high-energy, non-stop music and an overall exuberant sense of community and racial tolerance fuelled by repartee, practical jokes and gags, African-American director Michael Schultz offers sobering reflections on the frustration, anger and confusion occasioned by racial inequalities. As Richard Dyer (1993) suggests, the music’s repetition and circularity ‘suggest spatial and temporal stasis, the impossibility of change for the happier, in oneself or society’, in contrast to white musicals. The younger characters are as yet relatively carefree and the snappy TC (Franklyn Ajaye), resplendent in his Afro, just wants to win the radio competition and date the waitress next door. But the older characters are clearly burdened: middle-aged family man and ex-con Lonnie (Ivan Dixon) struggles to preserve his dignity and survive on his meagre earnings; troubled Duane/Abdullah (Bill Duke) seeks identity as a black Muslim; hooker Marlene (Lauren Jones) is totally lost, desolate; Lindy (Antonio Fargas) compulsively plays out his crossdressing gay identity; Justin (Leon Pinkney) and his girlfriend Mona (Tracy Reed) argue about whether he should go to college or earn a living. Car Wash’s time-limited, multi-character narrative and its radio/DJ soundtrack suggest a strong influence on Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing (1989), and Ice Cube has acknowledged the film’s influence on Friday (1995) and its sequels.

The opera’s tobacco factory became a parachute factory in the Deep South; Don José became Joe, a young soldier; and the bullfighter, Escamillo, became Husky Miller, a champion boxer. In the same year, Hollywood produced Cabin in the Sky* and Stormy Weather* – a cluster of all-black musicals produced at a time of increasing pressure from African-American groups about limited opportunities for black performers. Otto Preminger’s film appeared in a markedly different context: in 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in ‘the Brown Case’ that segregation in schooling was unconstitutional, and Carmen Jones became one of the last of the black-cast musicals that had long occupied an uneasy place in Hollywood production. The transposition of Bizet’s opera produced a plot with close parallels to the earlier musicals Hallelujah!* and Cabin in the Sky – a weak-willed man pulled between two women, one representing love, security and settlement, the other passion, danger and rootlessness. In Carmen Jones, however, religion and home, which were so central to the other two films, are almost wholly absent and instead of the man being saved for settlement, the story, following the original, ends in tragedy. It becomes in effect a drama of displacement: the initial setting is the South but Joe (Harry Belafonte) is in the army; the film begins with his fiancée, Cindy-Lou (Olga James), arriving at the base to be with him; Joe and Carmen (Dorothy Dandridge) drive across country when Joe is ordered to take her to the nearest town; and all the main characters end up in Chicago. A further dislocation and break with the tradition is produced by Bizet’s music, the lyrics brilliantly rewritten by Hammerstein, which displaces the blues, jazz and spirituals that inform the earlier films’ numbers.\n\nHillier & Pye Part 2\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:26 pm\n\nPage 39\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n39\n\nPreminger sets this potentially exotic cross-cultural fantasy in a world of unglamorous landscapes and functional spaces – settings for what he saw as ‘a dramatic film with music rather than a conventional film musical’ (Fujiwara, 2008) – and directs his cast of relative newcomers to film accordingly. Dandridge and Belafonte, in their first starring roles (though their singing voices were dubbed), are the film’s twin centres, but it is Dandridge who dominates. Her Carmen is wonderfully provocative and sensual, constantly disrupting the orderly and restricted spaces – like the dining hall (‘Dat’s Love’) and the jeep (‘There’s a Café on the Corner’) – in which Preminger places her. She is only still for a significant period when she is being faithful to the conventional and stolid Joe, playing no part in Frankie (Pearl Bailey)’s exuberant ‘Beat Out That Rhythm on the Drum’ in the café or the welcoming crowd around Husky Miller (Joe Adam)’s ‘Stan’ up and Fight’. Preminger’s characteristic long takes and his staging of the action across the CinemaScope frame maintain an observational distance on the characters’ various, ultimately forlorn, attempts to escape the constraints of their lives. The collision of Joe’s obsessive love and Carmen’s refusal to be confined ends in the storage cupboard in which Preminger sets Carmen’s death at Joe’s hands. The film enjoyed considerable success at the box office and opened the 1955 Cannes Film Festival. Dorothy Dandridge became the first African-American to be nominated for the Best Actress Academy Award, though she lost to Grace Kelly in The Country Girl. A few years later, Preminger directed Porgy and Bess (1959) when George Gershwin’s 1935 ‘folk opera’ was finally adapted for the screen.

Billy (Gordon MacRea) is killed by accident in the film, not by suicide. The original built to the shock of Billy’s death and only then introduced the afterlife and his return to earth, whereas the film recalls events in flashback as Billy tells his story to the Star-maker (Gene Lockhart), who will decide whether he can revisit his family for a day. We therefore know that Billy has died and his redemption is strongly implied from the outset. Even so, in the film’s otherwise faithful, though rather stolid, adaptation, much of what was disturbing in the show remains: Billy’s death and its consequences; Billy himself, who has as much in common with the villainous Jud in Oklahoma!* as with that show’s hero, Curly; and the abusive relationship between Billy and Julie (Shirley Jones). The film is also significant as one of a number of mid-1950s musicals (including A Star Is Born* and It’s Always Fair Weather*) that in their problematic treatment of relationships have much in common with melodrama. Characters in Carousel are constantly imagining what life might become. Julie’s friend Carrie (Barbara Ruick) sings ‘When I Marry Mr Snow’; Julie and Billy each sing ‘If I Loved You’, as they test their feelings early in the film; after the marriage, Billy reaches for a positive future only when Julie tells him she is pregnant, anticipating in his great ‘Soliloquy’ what ‘My boy Bill’ or ‘My little girl’ may be like. Even the show’s famous anthem, ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’, first sung to Julie by her cousin Hettie (Claramae Turner) after Billy’s death, is a stirring appeal to believe in the future: ‘At the end of the storm/Is a golden sky/And the sweet silver song of a lark’. From eternity, on the other hand, Billy looks back at dreams unfulfilled and at a daughter whose life he has blighted. Correspondingly, although Carousel, like Oklahoma!, is set in the American past – here a Maine fishing village in the late nineteenth\n\nHillier & Pye Part 2\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:26 pm\n\nPage 41\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n41\n\ncentury – community and romance are more complexly treated. The high-spirited communal number ‘June Is Busting Out All Over’ celebrates springtime desire, powered by the sexual energy of the young men and women. Yet the only relationships shown are those of Carrie and the stiflingly conventional Mr Snow (Robert Rounseville) and of Julie and Billy – Billy resentful and violent, Julie committed to a vision of love that casts the woman as self-denying, or even self-abasing. She sings ‘Oh, what’s the use of wond’ring/If he’s good or if he’s bad?/He’s your feller and you love him/That’s all there is to that’, and chillingly claims to their daughter, Louise, that ‘It’s possible … for someone to hit you … and it not hurt you at all.’ Julie makes that extraordinary statement when she intuits Billy’s spectral presence after his disastrous meeting with Louise, which ended with him hitting her for refusing the star he was offering. As ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ is reprised at the school graduation, Billy is able to whisper encouragement to Louise and ‘I loved you’ finally to Julie; their faces light up and they join optimistically in the singing. As Billy walks away, though, apparently redeemed, we may wonder, through the song’s stoical assertion of hope, just what is being affirmed. This was still dark material for a 1956 musical, which may at least partly account for the film’s limited box-office appeal, whereas the cast album sold extremely well.

Given Coward’s high profile as a dramatist, his celebrated musical theatre works during the 1920s/30s and the importance of musical theatre as source material for musical films, it is surprising that so little of Coward’s output was adapted for cinema. As the play’s title suggests, it adopts a pageant-like approach, as does the film, evoking the years 1899–1933 as experienced by an upperclass English family and their servants. More particularly, it privileges the emotional life of the upper-class wife/mother Jane Marryot (Diana Wynyard) rather than husband/father Robert (Clive Brook in typical stiffupper-lip mode) or the downstairs servant family, the Bridges. The focus here is very much English rather than British, though its genteel Englishness is very different from the robustly down-to-earth comedies being made around the same time by Gracie Fields (see Sing as We Go*) and George Formby (see Come on George!*). The historical pageant moves from 1899 and the Boer War to Queen Victoria’s death (1901), the sinking of the Titanic (1912), World War I and the Jazz Age (and, unspoken, the Depression). Since it is the story of a family ‘sheltered through two generations of Victorian prosperity [awaiting] the headlong cavalcade of the Twentieth Century’, it is inevitably also about the nation and the beginning of the end of empire. The Marryots lose one son and daughter-in-law on the Titanic (though the film implies they are lucky to be spared what is to come), and receive news of the death of the younger son as the armistice is announced. Tellingly, the younger son had been planning to break class taboos and marry the downstairs servants’ daughter Fanny (Ursula Jeans), now a celebrated singer and dancer.\n\nHillier & Pye Part 2\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:26 pm\n\nPage 43\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n43\n\nIn an uncertain conclusion, Robert toasts England’s future, while Jane pines for a past England of gallantry and dignity, but their quiet toasts are displaced by a frantic, chaotic montage of maimed solders, war graves and Jazz Age decadence, itself displaced by crowds singing ‘Auld Lang Syne’ and ‘God Save the King’ over an image of St Paul’s and the leitmotiv of the ghostly cavalcade of equestrian historical figures. Though Cavalcade is not a traditional musical, music and song are integral to its design. Traditional popular songs like ‘It’s a Long Way to Tipperary’, ‘Pack up Your Troubles’ and ‘Keep the Home Fires Burning’, used almost entirely off screen, punctuate the lengthy war montage. Period songs are integrated into on-screen performance: a seaside band performs ‘I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside’, for example, while there are theatrical and nightclub performances of new Noel Coward songs like ‘Girls of the CIV’, ‘Mirabelle’ and ‘Twentieth-Century Blues’ (one of his most celebrated), sung by Fanny with syncopated jazz backing, and reprised in the frantic montage at the end of the film. The song’s emphasis on ‘strange illusion, chaos and confusion’ embodies much of what the film and play are about. JH Dir: Frank Lloyd; Prod: Frank Lloyd, Winfield R.

Bob Fosse, who co-wrote the show’s book and both directed and choreographed the 1975 Broadway production, had been persuaded to work on a film version after years of reluctance, but his death in 1985, just as pre-production was about to begin, put the project in limbo for another fifteen years. It was when Rob Marshall outlined his ideas for reworking the original to producer Martin Richards that the film finally became a reality. Finding a solution to the relationship between narrative and numbers that would work on film had been a major stumbling block. Chicago was subtitled ‘A Musical Vaudeville’ on Broadway: the numbers, presented in the style of various vaudeville acts and performers, commented on the action but – unlike a conventional book musical – occupied a different level of theatrical reality. Marshall’s concept for motivating such theatricality in the film was to suggest that most numbers are in the mind of the wannabe performer and killer of her lover, Roxie Hart (Renée Zellweger). The opening and closing numbers take place on stage in the ‘real’ world – ‘All That Jazz’, performed by Velma Kelly (Catherine ZetaJones) just before she is arrested for the murder of her unfaithful boyfriend and her sister, and ‘Nowadays’, in which Roxie and Velma triumphantly celebrate the success of their double act. The others – mainly also presented as theatre performances – become Roxie’s fantasies. The film begins by zooming into the pupil of an eye and the title appears as if in its depths. It is a conceit that gave Marshall the flexibility to dissolve between and intercut action and number without having to maintain Roxie’s viewpoint slavishly through the film. Such intercutting, combined with the garish theatricality of the numbers, Marshall’s nods to Bob Fosse’s Broadway choreography, and John Kander and Fred Ebb’s musical echoes of their celebrated previous\n\nHillier & Pye Part 2\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:26 pm\n\nPage 45\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n45\n\nshow, recalls and pays homage to Cabaret*. Like Fosse’s film, too, Chicago gains much of its energy from an intensely edited visual style, cut to the rhythms of Kander’s music. The method produces exhilarating effects and striking images from its montage of varied angles, close and more distant shots, in numbers like ‘Cell Block Tango’, with the jailed women celebrating and re-enacting their crimes (‘He had it coming’), and ‘Razzle Dazzle’, attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere)’s demonstration to Roxie that the trial is really just a circus. But in also splintering space, time and bodies, it sacrifices continuity of performance for the synthetic continuity created by elaborate editing. By 2002, these were methods long familiar from music video and advertising, and had been widely incorporated into mainstream film style. They may also represent the only way of directing a dance musical with stars who are not professional dancers. In its satire of celebrity culture, Chicago also has something in common with Nashville*, which opened in the same year as the original Broadway production. Although the show ran for 936 performances, there were mixed critical responses to what was by all accounts its bitter tone and confrontational style. It is possible that the aftermath of the 1995 O. J. Simpson trial gave additional resonance to Chicago’s story of the murderess Roxie Hart made into a celebrity by a sensationalised media and found not guilty through the machinations of an unscrupulous defence attorney. Certainly the film was an extraordinary hit, taking over $300 million worldwide and winning six Oscars, including Best Picture.

UK, 1939 – 88 mins Anthony Kimmins George Formby was Britain’s most popular (and highest paid) male film star during the late 1930s and the 1939–45 war years – and second only to Stalin in popularity in the Soviet Union (while fellow Lancastrian performer Gracie Fields, with films like Sing as We Go*, was Britain’s most popular female star during the early and mid-30s). Formby’s films are perhaps more ‘comedies with music’ than ‘musical comedies’: they could work without songs, but a Formby film without four or five musical numbers with his ukulele was unimaginable. Formby’s background was in music hall/variety, and his films – like Fields’s – were partially vehicles for an already established comic/musical persona. Both stars’ personae were strongly Lancastrian, though they each quickly became popular nationally (while the more subversive Lancashire comic Frank Randle, for example, retained a more regional appeal). Made by a special Formby unit (headed by Anthony Kimmins) at Ealing Studios, Formby’s later films were as much a projection of Britain as Michael Balcon’s more prestigious Ealing films. Formby’s films were formulaic, their plots shifting over time from Depression themes in the earlier 1930s to wartime themes: his apparently naive, socially awkward character (usually called George, as here) bumbles into some narrative business by accident, but once involved – while remaining at some level clueless – demonstrates both determination and skill. Blessed with good luck, George finally wins through: saves the pub, exposes the counterfeiters, wins the horse or motorcycle race. Formby later embodied the British war spirit, where ‘winning’ involved unmasking spies (Let George Do It, 1940) and fifth columnists (Spare a Copper, 1941). His bumbling but persistent ‘little man’ – very different from Fields’s forthright character – led Geoffrey Macnab (2000) to see Formby as ‘Lancashire’s very own answer to Private Schweyek … the archetypal little man as hero’. ‘Winning’ also means\n\nHillier & Pye Part 2\n\n21/3/11\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n3:26 pm\n\nPage 47\n\n47\n\nwinning the girl, attracted by George’s lack of sophistication and warm-hearted sincerity. George is a sexual innocent, and the overt expression of sexuality (like most other crises) sends him into dithering cries of ‘Ooh, Mother …’ Come on George! is a typical Formby film, more lively than some. George is a racecourse ice-cream seller and aspiring jockey suspected of picking a horse-owner’s pocket. In a madcap escape from police, George ends up in a train horsebox with a fiery horse that has a tendency to throw jockeys, but is docile with anyone unaware of its reputation, and he is misled into looking after and training the animal. When George discovers that ‘Lamb’ is really ‘Man Eater’, he needs (comic) psychiatric help to ride the horse and, naturally, everything goes wrong: George is kidnapped by rivals, escapes, arrives at the racecourse in the nick of time and wins the race – and, of course, the girl, Mary, the local police sergeant’s daughter (played winningly by a young Pat Kirkwood). Some Formby films feature George as a musician: in Let George Do It, for example, he plays the ukulele in a band and the plot revolves around music. More usually, the songs are performed to other characters or frontally to the camera. Big production numbers were not considered appropriate, and the musical sequences are deliberately modest, designed more to add an extra – generally very sentimental – dimension to the Formby persona: in Come on George!, he serenades the horse, courts Mary and sings her younger brother to sleep, and sings about not letting the stable down. Typically upbeat and humorous – though with sexual innuendo thrown into the mix – the songs exemplify the optimistic and populist nature of Formby’s appeal.

A cousin of Ginger Rogers, Hayworth was a dancer before making movies; in the early 1940s, Columbia were intent on making her a musical star (although her singing was always dubbed), notably in You’ll Never Get Rich (1941) and You Were Never Lovelier (1942), in both of which she was a very good dancing match for Fred Astaire. Columbia’s first colour musical, Cover Girl, as the title suggests, was primarily a vehicle for Hayworth, showing off her looks and her dancing, though it also developed the melancholic and vulnerable side of her persona. Gene Kelly’s first lead Broadway role was in late 1940 in Pal Joey (directed by George Abbott, choreographed by Robert Alton, with Stanley Donen as a young dancer); Kelly and Donen then choreographed Abbott’s 1941 show Best Foot Forward before going to Hollywood together. Despite co-starring in MGM’s For Me and My Gal (1942) (with Judy Garland) and Thousands Cheer (1943) (with Kathryn Grayson), Kelly was loaned to Columbia for Cover Girl, the first film to fully feature his distinctive dance style and star persona. Donen choreographed the 1943 film version of Best Foot Forward, before working (uncredited) on Kelly’s Cover Girl routines, and later choreographing Anchors Aweigh*. Cover Girl draws on familiar (but pleasurable) showbiz narratives. Rusty Parker (Hayworth) and Danny McGuire (Kelly) sing and dance together in Danny’s ‘honky tonk place’ in Brooklyn, along with comic sidekick Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty upsets the work/romance equilibrium by winning a glamour magazine cover competition and is lured away. Of course, Hollywood, with its millions, sides with Danny’s small-scale, cash-strapped but romantic and ‘authentic’ club rather than with Fifth Avenue and Broadway; Rusty’s extravagant Broadway ‘Cover Girl’ production number, despite its enormous stage ramp and extensive male\n\nHillier & Pye Part 2\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:26 pm\n\nPage 49\n\n100 FILM MUSICALS\n\n49\n\nchorus, is slow and static compared to the energy and inventiveness of the numbers with Danny, among Kelly’s best early dance routines. In ‘Make Way for Tomorrow’, Kelly, Hayworth and Silvers dance exuberantly along a night-time street; in ‘Put Me to the Test’, Kelly (on stage with Hayworth) combines his athletic ballet style (influenced by Agnes de Mille and new American dance) with accomplished tap; Danny and Rusty are reconciled in the lovely, gently romantic ‘Long Ago and Far\n\nGene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, Phil Silvers, ‘Make Way for Tomorrow’\n\nHillier & Pye Part 2\n\n21/3/11\n\n3:26 pm\n\n50\n\nPage 50\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\nAway’, set in the empty nightclub.
