Omar Sy effortlessly juggles comedy and compassion as Raphael Padilla, a.k.a. Chocolat, the first black star of the French stage. Born a slave in Cuba, Padilla makes his way to a rag-tag circus in Europe, where he plays a tooth-baring cannibal named Kalanka for provincial rubes who've never seen a black man before. Impressed with Padilla's agility, George Footit partners up with him and they develop a clown act that catapults them to fame and fortune - more or less, since Footit, the white man in the partnership, takes most of the fortune. Success is bittersweet for Chocolat, who stays positive despite the fact that his act consists of mocking his own race to the delight of French audiences. But when he tries to step outside the character society wants him to play, those delighted audiences vanish in droves. Monsieur Chocolat revives the legend of a trailblazing artist whom history has all but forgotten.\n\nThe fourth film of writer/director Roschdy Zem is his first period piece, and his most ambitious effort yet. Most people will know Zem for a diverse acting career that has spanned nearly three decades. He brings that same versatility to directing, ranging from his cross-cultural comedy Bad Faith (COLCOA 2007), to the crime drama Omar Killed Me (2011) to the family drama Bodybuilder (2014). This project was first proposed to Zem by producers Éric and Nicolas Altmayer, who had a Cyril Gely script based on a theater piece and subsequent book by historian Gérard Noiriel. For the final adaptation Zem brought in his Omar Killed Me collaborator Oliver Gorce. For the role of Footit, Zem cast Charlie Chaplin's grandson James Thiérrée, an accomplished acrobat and juggler who designed and choreographed the circus numbers.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"Monsieur Chocolat has all the elements of a great film.\"\n\n- Judith Prescott, French Cinema Review\n\n\"Sy does a fantastic job channeling the spirit of a man caught between his desire to be rich and free and the gradual recognition that he's still only someone else's whipping boy.\"\n\n- Jordan Mintzer, Hollywood Reporter\n\nTUESDAY, APRIL 19\n\nMORE\n\nNorth American Premiere (digitally restored version) • Drama • France, West Germany, 1969\n\nDCP • 1.66 • Mono • Color • 112 min\n\nDirected by: Barbet Schroeder\n\nWritten by: Eugène Archer (dialogue), Mimsy Farmer (dialogue), Paul Gardner (dialogue), Paul Gégauff, Barbet Schroeder\n\nCinematography: Néstor Almendros\n\nFilm Editing: Denise de Casabianca, Rita Roland\n\nOriginal Score: \"Pink Floyd\": David Gilmour, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, Richard Wright\n\nProduced by: Jet Films, Les Films du Losange\n\nCast: Mimsy Farmer (Estelle Miller), Klaus Grünberg (Stefan Brückner), Heinz Engelmann (Dr. Ernesto Wolf)\n\nUS Distributor: Janus Films • janusfilms.com\n\nCOLCOA is pleased to present the North American premiere of the restored version of More. Causing a commotion in Cannes and initially banned in France, Barbet Schroeder's debut feature recasts the myth of Icarus as a cautionary tale of free love and drug addiction in the shadow of the May '68 Paris uprising. Fresh out of college, Stefan hitchhikes to Paris seeking to burn all his bridges and find the warmth of the sun. He is quickly pulled into the orbit of Estelle, an expat American exuding an irresistible white heat of sexual promise. Stefan's pursuit of the kinky, free-spirited Estelle - perfectly embodied by actress Mimsy Farmer, whose cult following owes more to her leads in Dario Argento Giallo Films - takes him south to the hippie mecca of Ibiza. Despite Estelle's questionable ties to a shifty German \"ex-Nazi,\" Stefan finds a small house by the sea where the two disappear into a private idyll of sex, sun and drugs to the rhythms of Pink Floyd's mercurial soundtrack, until Stefan discovers her true weakness, and makes a tragic decision.\n\nUnlike its more idealistic 1969 counterpart, Easy Rider, More doesn't try to bring the viewer into the subjective experience of drug use. Instead writer/director/producer Barbet Schroeder, borrowing Eric Rohmer's brilliant cinematographer Néstor Almendros, brought a detached gaze to the proceedings. The camera here is steady, as remorseless as the Spanish sun. The film's darker take on the counterculture movement was controversial at the time, but in light of the disillusionment that came in the '70's, it now seems prescient. From here, Schroeder would go on to a diverse directing career, from the European arthouse Maîtresse (1976) to more American fare such as Barfly (1987) and Single White Female (1992). He earned a reputation in Hollywood for thrillers like Desperate Measures (1998) and Murder By Numbers (2002). With his 2015 film Amnesia, Schroeder returned to the island of Ibiza, where, perhaps not so incidentally, he lived as a child.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"It's 19th-century romance set to a rock tune on a portable cassette tape recorder.\"\n\n- Vincent Canby, New York Times\n\n\"More stands today as a visually true time capsule summary of the end of the hippie dream.\"\n\n- Black Gloves, Horrorview\n\nICE AND THE SKY / La Glace et le ciel\n\nLos Angeles Premiere • Documentary • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 1.85 • Dolby 5.1 • Color/B&W • 90 min\n\nDirected by: Luc Jacquet\n\nWritten by: Luc Jacquet\n\nCinematography: Stéphane Martin\n\nFilm Editing: Stéphane Mazalaigue\n\nOriginal Score: Cyrille Aufort\n\nProduced by: Richard Grandpierre (Eskwad)\n\nCast: Claude Lorius (Himself), Michel Papineschi (Narrator), Jacques-Yves Cousteau (Himself)\n\nInternational Sales: Wild Bunch\n\nUS Distributor: Music Box Films • musicboxfilms.com\n\nThe writer/director of the Oscar-winning March of the Penguins is back, this time with a documentary suggesting that penguins should be very afraid, and they're not the only ones. Part biography, part call-to-arms, this spectacular documentary celebrates the remarkable adventures and scientific discoveries of French polar explorer and glaciologist Claude Lorius. Sixty years ago, Lorius answered an ad that would take him on such a long expedition in remote Antarctica that his appendix and wisdom teeth had to be removed just as a precaution. Rare and stunning archival footage captures the hardships and wonders of his more than twenty expeditions since then. During these expeditions, Lorius conducted experiments that, for the first time, revealed to the world the cold hard facts about climate change. For Lorius, a man who literally risked his life in the quest for knowledge, it's the climate change deniers who are walking on thin ice.\n\nIn 2005 Luc Jacquet charmed audiences all over the world with his smash hit documentary March of the Penguins. Taking home the Best Documentary Oscar® was an auspicious beginning to a career that happened almost by accident. With a background in animal biology and ecology, Jacquet took part in a research project in Antarctica. Although he had never used a camera before, part of his duties was to film the penguins. Since that time, he has always sought out subjects that bring together his love for nature and his fascination for film. His fiction feature, TheFox & the Child (2007) wove striking animal footage into a fairytale narrative. With his feature length doc, Once Upon a Forest (2013), Jacquet deployed breathtaking visuals to the world's rainforests to reveal the secret life of trees. Ice and the Sky was selected as the closing film of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"...at once heartwarming, breathtaking and downright chilling.\"\n\n- Nicola Davis, The Guardian\n\n\"...an ode to the spirit of exploration and adventure.\"\n\n- Rob Aldam, Back Seat Mafia\n\n\"...a stirring, humanist portrait of a scientist dedicated to understanding and protecting the uncharted Antarctic.\"\n\n- Sean Gallen, The Upcoming\n\nCOME WHAT MAY / En mai, fais ce qu'il te plaît\n\nWest Coast Premiere • Drama, History • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 2.40 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 114 min\n\nDirected by: Christian Carion\n\nWritten by: Andrew Bampfield, Christian Carion, Laure Irrmann\n\nCinematography: Pierre Cottereau\n\nFilm Editing: Laure Gardette\n\nOriginal Score: Ennio Morricone\n\nProduced by: Christophe Roussignon (Nord-Ouest Films)\n\nCast: August Diehl (Hans), Olivier Gourmet (Paul), Mathilde Seigner (Mado), Alice Isaaz (Suzanne), Matthew Rhys (Percy)\n\nInternational Sales: Pathé Distribution\n\nUS Distributor: Cohen Media Group • cohenmedia.net\n\nWar films tend to tell stories about political leaders, or the soldiers who carry out their orders. Come What May examines the effects of war on more ordinary citizens, a timely subject in the midst of the Syrian refugee crisis. It's 1940; German Panzers are smashing through the Ardennes forest on their way to France. Eight million people flee - the largest exodus in modern history. Among them are Paul, the mayor of a small village, and Suzanne, a young schoolteacher and surrogate mother to Max, a displaced German boy. They organize the charge to abandon the town and head for the safety of the coast. It's a heavy decision, because taking their caravan on the open roads leaves them defenseless against German attack. At the same time, Max's father Hans, who fled the Nazi regime and was subsequently imprisoned in France, sets out to look for his son, accompanied by Scottish soldier Percy (The Americans star Matthew Rhys), who hopes to repatriate a set of bagpipes with the retreating British army. An intimate story, told on an epic scale, and with an expansive score by the maestro of film music, Academy Award winner Ennio Morricone.\n\nKnown for making historical tapestries based on true stories, writer/director Christian Carion stepped onto the international stage with his feel-good WWI film Joyeux Noel (2005), in which soldiers in the trenches lay down their arms for one day to celebrate Christmas with the enemy. His gripping thriller Farewell (COLCOA 2010), went back to the Cold War and featured filmmakers Emir Kusturica and Guillaume Canet as spies passing Soviet secrets to the West. Carion was born into a farming family and initially went in that direction professionally. After meeting fellow film enthusiast Christophe Rossignon, now a prominent producer, the two of them decided to dedicate their lives to filmmaking. Co-writer Andrew Bampfield is an established writer for French TV, known for Inside The Twin Towers (2006). This is the first writing credit for co-writer Laure Irrmann.\n\nMADE IN FRANCE\n\nNorth American Premiere • Drama, Thriller • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 2.35 • Dolby SRD • Color • 94 min\n\nDirected by: Nicolas Boukhrief\n\nWritten by: Éric Besnard, Nicolas Boukhrief\n\nCinematography: Patrick Ghiringhelli\n\nFilm Editing: Lydia Decobert\n\nOriginal Score: Robin Coudert\n\nProduced by: Clément Miserez Radar Films\n\nCast: Malik Zidi (Sam), Dimitri Storoge (Hassan), François Civil (Christophe), Nassim Si Ahmed (Driss)\n\nInternational Sales: WTFilms\n\nThis darkly atmospheric shock-thriller takes you on a white-knuckle ride inside a cell of homegrown extremists dedicated to bringing jihad to the streets of Paris. Sam is a Franco-Algerian journalist hoping to write a tell-all exposing the threat of domestic terrorism. Using his knowledge of Islam, he infiltrates a small cadre of extremists led by Hassan, a disgruntled shoe salesman whose chief leadership credential is having met \"the principals\" on his pilgrimage to Mecca. Hassan instructs everyone to \"become invisible.\" From the outside, it all appears frighteningly ordinary, except for Sam, who is now in the precarious position of a normal guy trying to look like an extremist trying to look normal. Sam discovers that the cell is comprised of young men who, far from marching in lockstep, have wildly different motivations. But as the plan moves closer to fruition, suspicion grips the conspirators, putting more than his book in immediate danger.\n\nWhen writer/director Nicolas Boukhrief and his co-writer Éric Besnard ( Babylon A.D.) began to research this subject, their principal reference was the Paris commuter train bombing in 1995. They had no way of knowing just how prophetic the film would be, nor how much its commercial life would suffer for it. Slated initially for release in early 2015, the devastating attack on Charlie Hebdo gave the original distributor cold feet. Then the tragic Bataclan attack, coming just one week before the film's new release date, led to a second cancellation. For Boukhrief, a genre specialist, the film was conceived firstly as entertainment, but its subject matter struck raw nerves in France. Known for crime dramas like Cash Truck (COLCOA 2004), Cortex (2008), and Sphinx (COLCOA 2010), Boukhrief began his career as a journalist, first as an editor for the genre film magazine Starfix, then creating the Canal + series Le Journal du cinéma, which aired for more than a decade. His transition to filmmaking began in 1993, when he co-wrote Tout le monde n'a pas eu la chance d'avoir des parents communistes with director/co-writer Jean-Jacques Zilbermann.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"...a thoughtful and sobering 'what if' scenario of home-grown, domestically targeted terrorism.\"\n\n- Peter Debruge, Variety\n\n\"This unpleasant feeling to have in front of you a monster hidden under the usual mask is the great artistic success of Made in France.\"\n\n- Thomas Coispel, Le Blog Du Cinema\n\nTHE FIRST, THE LAST / Les Premiers, les Derniers\n\nNorth American Premiere • Comedy/Crime/Romance • France, 2016\n\nDCP • 2.35 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 98 min\n\nDirected by: Bouli Lanners\n\nWritten by: Bouli Lanners\n\nCinematography: Jean-Paul De Zaeytijd\n\nFilm Editing: Ewin Ryckaert\n\nOriginal Score: Pascal Humbert\n\nProduced by: ADCB Films, Prime Time, VOO, BE TV, RTBF, Versus Production\n\nCast: Albert Dupontel (Cochise), Bouli Lanners (Gilou), Suzanne Clément (Clara), Michael Lonsdale (Jean-Berchmans)\n\nInternational Sales: Wild Bunch\n\nElements of the western and the gothic thriller come together in this darkly absurd conceptual one-off. Set amidst the industrial ruins of a flatland vast enough to swallow men whole, Cochise and Gilou, a pair of grizzled bounty hunters, have been hired by a wealthy stranger to obtain a phone that holds some critical information. The phone is in the possession of Esther and Willy, a homeless young couple. Whenever they turn the phone on, Cochise and Gilou can get a lead on their whereabouts, but the feckless lovers don't have much need for phones. They believe the end-times have begun, an unlikely proposition seemingly corroborated by the appearance of a gaunt, bearded man calling himself Jesus. As the chase develops, straightforward genre elements give way to more metaphorical and thematic concerns. In this singular and deeply personal universe, everyone, including a craggy undertaker played by Max Von Sydow, seems uprooted, set adrift in his/her own way.\n\nIt's perhaps no coincidence that the fourth feature of Belgian actor/writer/director Bouli Lanners has a painterly look- Lanners' first calling was to fine arts and painting, although it was as an actor that Lanners found the success that opened doors for him. Over the last two decades, he has established himself as a character actor in dozens of films. In 2006 he made his first feature Ultranova, followed by Eldorado (2008), which took the FIPRESCI Prize at Cannes' Director's Fortnight. A road movie about a heroin addict and a lonely car dealer who end up unlikely companions, the film was Lanners' first to draw visual inspiration from the Western canon. Lanners' third film, the Belgium-set, coming-of-age comedy, The Giants (2011), won the SACD Prize at Cannes. Throughout his directing career, Lanners has nurtured a creative collaboration with cinematographer Jean-Paul de Zaetijd, making for films that recall Lanners' underpinnings as a painter. In fact it was a single image, glimpsed from a passing train that planted the seed for this film. The First, The Last took its international bow in the Panorama section of the 2016 Berlin Film Festival.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"Film aficionados will definitely want to catch this any way they can.\"\n\n- Boyd van Hoeij, Hollywood Reporter\n\n\"...the direction is near faultless. Creating an atmosphere deeply ominous and unnerving.\"\n\n- Thomas Unsted, The Upcoming\n\nWEDNESDAY, APRIL 20\n\nMARIUS\n\nInternational Premiere (restored version) • Drama • France 1931\n\nDCP • 1.20 • Mono • Black & White • 130 min\n\nDirected by: Alexander Korda\n\nWritten by: Marcel Pagnol\n\nCinematography: Theodore J. Pahle\n\nFilm Editing: Roger Spiri-Mercanton\n\nOriginal Score: Francis Gromon\n\nProduced by: Marcel Pagnol (Les Films Marcel Pagnol), Paramount France\n\nCast: Raimu (César Olivier), Pierre Fresnay (Marius), Orane Demazis (Fanny), Fernand Charpin (Honoré Panisse), Alida Rouffe (Honorine Cabanis), Paul Dullac (Félix Escartefigue), Alexandre Mihalesco (Piquoiseau)\n\nInternational Sales: CMF-MPC\n\nCOLCOA is pleased to celebrate a cornerstone of early French cinema with a special screening of this Alexander Korda masterpiece, restored to its original glory by the Cinematheque Francaise and the Franco-American Cultural Fund. Marcel Pagnol's original play was a monstrous stage hit. With the arrival of sound cinema, Pagnol seized the opportunity to adapt it to film. Marius, the first installment of what would come to be known as the Marseille Trilogy, is set in the colorful Old Port of Marseille, where ordinary but lovable characters are coping with everyday problems. There's Marius, a humble barkeep who is torn between his wanderlust for exotic ports of call and his unspoken love for Fanny, the fishmonger's beautiful daughter, who harbors a secret love of her own. There's Marius' father César, whose generosity of spirit is overruled by his tendency to interfere. Then there's Panisse, the aging widower with no heir, whose intention to wed Fanny and make a son to take over his sail manufacturing business sends ripples up and down the port.\n\nDirector Alexander Korda was a Hungarian refugee who eventually made his career in London after stints in Hollywood and Paris. His The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933) received a best picture nomination and won a Best Actor Oscar for Charles Laughton. The first British film producer to be knighted, Korda gave early support to such talents as Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger, Laurence Olivier, David Lean, and Carol Reed.\n\nWriter/producer Marcel Pagnol's creative signature is fully recognized inMarius, in which he unapologetically pushed dialogue to the front and center of his narrative style. An early champion of sound, Pagnol stood firm against the likes of men like René Clair. His love of simple characters, and provincial life in southern France foreshadowed neo-realism. Although the Marseille Trilogy began as theater, the final installment, César (1936), was written directly as a screenplay for Pagnol to direct. Its popularity gave Pagnol the means to establish his own film production company. Ever the renaissance man, Pagnol had successful parallel careers as journalist, publisher, and author, notably of Jean de Florette andManon of the Spring, which he also adapted to film in 1953.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"[Marius] helped to position the auteur at the heart of French cinema. Its impact can be felt today, in the unusually high proportion of naturalistic dramas that come out of France each year, many of which tackle the very same issues.\"\n\n- James Travers, Films De France\n\n\"...special credit goes to Raimu, an extraordinary artist who almost literally exposes his very soul up on the screen.\"\n\n- Jeffrey M. Anderson, Combustible Celluloid\n\nAS I OPEN MY EYES / A peine j'ouvre les yeux\n\nWest Coast Premiere • Drama • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 1.85 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 102 min\n\nDirected by: Leyla Bouzid\n\nWritten by: Leyla Bouzid, Marie-Sophie Chambon\n\nCinematography: Antoine Marteau\n\nFilm Editing: Lilian Corbeille\n\nOriginal Score: Khyam Allami\n\nProduced by: Blue Monday Productions\n\nCast: Baya Medhaffer (Farah), Ghalia Benali (Hayet), Montassar Ayari (Bohrène)\n\nInternational Sales: Doc & Film International\n\nU.S. distributor: Kino Lorber • kinolorber.com\n\nIt's the summer of 2010, the eve of the Arab Spring. Tunisia heaves under the ever-watchful regime of dictator Ben Ali; revolution is in the air. Exuberantly breathing in that air is Farah, a bright high school grad eager to explore the fresh possibilities of young adulthood. Her mother, Hayet (renowned singer Ghalia Benali), is pressuring her to go to medical school, but Farah has more intriguing offers. She's the singer in an underground band, and dabbling in matters of love and sex with fellow musician, Bohrene. Farah's fearless feminist stance and the band's lyrics challenge the status quo, so when Hayet receives a warning from an old friend in the Interior Ministry, she is determined to make Farah understand the very real dangers of her growing political convictions. A bittersweet coming of age drama, not only for its impetuous protagonist, but also for Tunisia, a country coming of age after its own rebellious spree ended without the freedoms that many of its youthful protesters had hoped for.\n\nAfter taking top honors at the 2015 Dubai International Film Festival, this French-Tunisian co-production from writer/director Leyla Bouzid went on to receive the Label Europa Cinemas prize at the 2015 Venice Film Festival. Tunisian born Bouzid studied film at La Fémis in Paris. After a few short films, she turned her attention to Tunisia's Jasmine Revolution, a rich source of inspiration for her debut feature. From this starting point, Bouzid and her French co-screenwriter Marie-Sophie Chambon were able to create a complex mother-daughter relationship that mirrors the social forces at play in the country as a whole. Music was another critical component in the film, so Bouzid enlisted Iraqi musician/composer Khyam Allami to write the band's songs.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"A film with heart and passion, one that can color one's dreams and inspire one's days.\"\n\n- E. Nina Rothe, Huffington Post\n\n\"...skillfully conjures the pressure-cooker atmosphere lying just below Tunisia's surface during the waning days of the dictatorship.\"\n\n- Jay Weissberg, Variety\n\nLOVE AT FIRST CHILD / Ange et Gabrielle\n\nU.S. Premiere • Romantic Comedy • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 1.85 • Dolby Digital • Color • 91 min\n\nDirected by: Anne Giaffieri\n\nWritten by: Anne Giafferi, Anne Le Ny\n\nBased on a play by: Murielle Magellan\n\nCinematography: Stéphane Cami\n\nFilm Editing: Christine Lucas, Navarro\n\nOriginal Score: Jean-Michel Bernard\n\nProduced by: Marc Olla (Palazzo Films), Benoît Jaubert (Benji Films)\n\nCast: Isabelle Carré (Gabrielle), Patrick Bruel (Ange), Alice de Lencquesaing (Claire), Thomas Solivéres (Simon), Laurent Stocker (Guillaume)\n\nInternational Sales: TF1 International • tf1international.com\n\nSingle parenting, unwanted pregnancy and empty-nest syndrome trip each other up in this fizzy rom-com. Seventeen year-old Claire is pregnant, and the father Simon, himself a young student, is too overwhelmed by the prospect of fatherhood to accept responsibility. Claire's mother, Gabrielle, raised Claire without a father, and she refuses to accept the same fate for her daughter. Taking the matter in hand, Gabrielle hunts down Simon's father Ange (Patrick Bruel), hoping that he will be sensible and convince Simon to get up on the whole parenting trip. Much to her chagrin, Ange turns out to be a fifty-something, club-hopping, skirt-chasing, inveterate bachelor who wants no part of Gabrielle's little plan. What Gabrielle finds even more vexing is that on top of all this, he has the gall to be charming.\n\nWriter/director Anne Giaffieri's first feature, Qui a envie d'être aimé? (2010), was about a man with a dysfunctional family who re-discovers faith, adapted from a novel by Giaffieri's husband, Thierry Bizot. For this, her sophomore effort, Giaffieri wanted to go in a more purely comic direction. Collaborating on the screenplay with Intouchables (COLCOA 2012) actress/writer Anne Le Ny, she adapted Muriel Magellan's comedic play L'Eveil du Chameau. Giaffieri's first breakthrough came in another collaboration with Magellan, the 2006 television mini-series adaptation of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot's Christmas. That success led to two long-running television series, Les petits meurtres d'Agatha Christie and the more recent hit, Fais pas ci, fais pas ça. Directing two episodes of that show gave her a taste for more. She has directed two TV, movies, in addition to her work on the big screen.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"...done with such brio and pizzazz it's impossible not to be swept along by its charm.\"\n\n- Judith Prescott, French Cinema Review\n\nMUCH LOVED\n\nWest Coast Premiere • Drama • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 1.85 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 104 min\n\nDirected by: Nabil Ayouch\n\nWritt\n\nen by: Nabil Ayouch\n\nCinematography: Virginie Surdej\n\nFilm Editing: Damien Keyeux\n\nOriginal Score: Mike Kourtzer\n\nProduced by: Nabil Ayouch, Saïd Hamich, Eric Poulet\n\nCast: Loubna Abidar (Noha), Asmaa Lazrak (Randa), Halima Karaouane (Soukaina)\n\nInternational Sales: Celluloid Dreams\n\nFollowing its unveiling at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, this glossy, Marrakech-based drama about women making ends meet by selling their bodies has been banned in Morocco and cast members have been attacked on the streets. Loubna Abidar is magnetic as Noha, who at 28, is the matriarch of a group of upscale call girls who live together as a family of sorts. Case-hardened by life, Noha's only vulnerability is her judgmental mother. Soukaina, on the other hand, still harbors romantic sentiments for a penniless suitor who can only observe the object of his affection from a distance. Randa, the youngest and most modern, could learn a lot from Noha, if only her growing attraction to women weren't eroding the mentorship. We follow their precarious lives as they negotiate the hypocritical macho posturing, the sexual repression, and the deeply entrenched double standards that mark Moroccan society, and perhaps by extension, much of the Arab world.\n\nWriter/director Nabil Ayouch is known for pointed social dramas that focus on characters driven to desperation by poverty and victimization. While films like A Minute of Sun Less (2002), which depicted homosexual sex, have served to start conversations, they have also landed him in direct conflict with the more conservative elements of the Moroccan state. His 2012 film Horses of God took a hard look at the 2003 Casablanca suicide bombers as a harbinger for the rising phenomena of terrorism fueled by poverty and social alienation. After that, Ayouch decided to look into prostitution as another form of violence visited upon the underprivileged. Much Loved was the product of 18 months of research, including personal interviews with more than 200 sex workers. Initially conceived as a documentary, it evolved into what Ayouch calls a \"fiction du reel\". Born in Paris to a Moroccan father and a Tunisian mother, Ayouch was raised in France. In response to the ongoing ban on his film, more than 80 French producers and filmmakers have signed a petition in support.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"...an enticing and uncompromising insight into a sordid and brutal underworld.\"\n\n- Harriet Clugston, London Film Festival\n\n\"The cast's remarkable bravery cannot be overstated, and the actresses are potent conveyors of the film's message countering the establishment's pietism.\"\n\n- Jay Weissberg, Variety\n\n\"Ayouch has a hypnotic ability to immerse the viewer in scenes.\"\n\n- Deborah Young, Hollywood Reporter\n\nCOURTED / L'Hermine\n\nWest Coast Premiere • Drama • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 2.35 • Dolby • Color • 98 min\n\nDirected by: Christian Vincent\n\nWritten by: Christian Vincent\n\nCinematography: Laurent Dailland\n\nFilm Editing: Yves Deschamps\n\nOriginal Score: Claire Denamur\n\nProduced by: Matthieu Tarot (Albertine Productions)\n\nCast: Fabrice Luchini (Michel Racine), Sidse Babett Knudsen (Ditte Lorensen-Coteret), Eva Lallier (Ann Lorensen-Coteret), Corinne Masiero (Marie-Jeanne Metzer), Sophie-Marie Larrouy (Coralie Marciano)\n\nInternational Sales: Gaumont • gaumont.fr\n\nBest Actor prize at the 2015 Venice International Film Festival went to Fabrice Luchini for his portrayal of Michel Racine, a cranky, straight-laced judge presiding over a sobering murder case, while dealing with a divorce on the home front, and a pesky flu. As demanding as all of that is, Michel's world skids to a halt when a randomly chosen juror turns out to be someone from his past. Ditte, played by Borgen star Sidse Babett Knudsen, is a caring single mother who made an indelible impression on Michel six years earlier. Michel, whose reputation for severity has earned him a nickname reflecting the double-digit sentences he likes to hand down, tosses his beloved protocol aside for a series of assignations to explore their mutual attraction. While nodding to courtroom drama and rom-com, Courted conscientiously dodges the clichés of both genres.\n\nKnown for his skill with intimate drama, such as the Isabelle Huppert and Daniel Auteuil starrer, La separation (1994), and for studied social critiques like Save Me (2000), writer/director Christian Vincent is equally adept with comedy, as he demonstrated with his Ernst Lubitsch-styled hit Quatres étoiles (2006). Stateside, many will know him from his previous hit, Haute Cuisine (COLCOA 2013). Vincent first gained attention with his feature La Discrète (1991). Adding to the acclaim the film received from the César Awards, including Best Debut Feature, was a Best Actor nomination for the film's lead, Fabrice Luchini. Early on, Vincent was compared to filmmaking legend Eric Rohmer with his explorations of the incivility lurking in the nuances of so-called civil society. But it is foremost to Jean Renoir's Rules Of The Game that Vincent claims creative lineage. In addition to the Best Actor prize, the 2015 Venice International Film Festival awarded Vincent a Best Screenplay honor.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"...brings together two worlds with finesse and sensitivity, offering enough depth to make the story passionate and moving.\"\n\n- Geoffrey Crété, CineMan\n\n\"...honed to melancholic comic perfection.\"\n\n- Guy Lodge, Variety\n\nEVA DOESN't SLEEP / Eva ne dort pas\n\nLos Angeles Premiere • Drama • France, Argentina 2016\n\nDCP • 1.85 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 85 min\n\nDirected by: Pablo Agüero\n\nWritten by: Pablo Agüero\n\nCinematography: Ivan Gierasinchuk\n\nFilm Editing: Stéphane Elmadjian\n\nOriginal Score: Valentin Portron\n\nProduced by: Jacques Bidou, Marianne Dumoulin (JBA Production), Canana Films, Haddock Films, Tornasol Films\n\nCast: Gael Garcia Bernal (Massera), Denis Lavant (Koenig), Sabrina Machi (Eva), Imanol Arias (Dr Ara)\n\nInternational Sales: Pyramide International • pyramidefilms.com\n\nPart hagiography, part ghost story, this visionary drama featuring Gael García Bernal and Denis Lavant chronicles the epic 25 year journey of a corpse. Not just any corpse, mind you, but that of the beloved champion of working-class Argentines, Eva Perón, whose tragic death at the age of 33 prompted a spectacle of public grief that lasted for weeks. Fetishized in death, the bizarre-but-true fate of Perón's cadaver becomes a metaphor for a nation haunted by a broken dream of social justice and unity. Told in elliptical chapters, we meet the official state embalmer whose task to prepare his \"masterpiece\" for permanent public display leads to some rather unnervingly intimate situations. Then there's a pair of soldiers whose mission to smuggle the \"Sleeping Beauty\" out of the country gets sidetracked by certain, less respectful preoccupations. Like a piece of stolen art, her mystique grows, until the new military junta decides to put a dead person at the top of the list of people to be permanently disappeared.\n\nFour years of historical research went into the making of this, the third feature of writer/director Pablo Agüero. His previous work, First Snow (winner of the Best Short Film prize at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival), and features Salamandra (2008), and 77 Doronship (2009), all displayed the Argentine filmmaker's experimental bravura and knack for mining the absurd from the seemingly ordinary. With Eva Doesn't Sleep, Agüero aims for a wider audience while retaining his surrealist touch. The film's principal producing partner, France's JBA Productions, is a boutique production house with over 50 titles from filmmakers across the world. Agüero initially saw actress Sabrina Machi, who plays Eva, in the casting process for another character. After giving her the lead role, she underwent special training to control involuntary movements, including swallowing, eyelid movement, and breathing.\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"...further cements the Argentinean auteur as a vital voice in the cinematic landscape.\"\n\n- Robert Bell, Exclaim\n\n\"...a singular and wonderfully creepy work.\"\n\n- Ben Nicholson, CineVue\n\n\"Bold and original, and boasting brilliant set pieces.\"\n\n- Diana Sanchez, TIFF\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21\n\nA MATTER OF RESISTANCE / La Vie de château\n\nWorld Premiere (restored version) • Comedy/Romance • France, 1966\n\nDCP • 1.66 • Mono • B&W • 93 min\n\nDirected by: Jean-Paul Rappeneau\n\nWritten by: Jean-Paul Rappeneau, Alain Cavalier, Claude Sautet, Daniel Boulanger\n\nCinematography: Pierre Lhomme\n\nFilm Editing: Pierre Gillette\n\nOriginal Score: Michel Legrand\n\nProduced by: Ancinex, Cobela Films, Les Productions de la Guéville\n\nCast: Catherine Deneuve (Marie), Claude Brasseur (Dimanche), Philippe Noiret (Jérôme), Henri Garcin (Julien)\n\nInternational Sales: TF1 International • tf1international.com\n\nThe setting for this classic farce is a tumbledown country estate in Normandy, 1944, shortly before D-Day. Young Catherine Deneuve plays Marie, a fitfully bored lady of the house taken to wistful dreams of an exciting life in Paris, and exalted flirtations with some of the hunkier locals. Her husband, Jérôme, is a meek fusspot 20 years her senior, preoccupied with his apple orchards and placating his taskmistress mother. The answer to Marie's prayers falls from the sky, in the form of Julien, a rakish officer of the French Resistance, here to scout for enemy artillery. And just when things start to get complicated, Kommandant Klopstock requisitions the chateau as a German garrison in order to pursue Marie himself. As sworn enemies do battle for Marie's favors, one man remembers that there's a real war raging all around them. COLCOA is proud to showcase this meticulously restored recipient of the 1966 Louis Delluc Prize in conjunction with the U.S. Premiere of director Jean-Paul Rappeneau's latest film, Families.\n\nThey say tragedy plus time equals comedy, but in the early 1960s, the tragedies of WWII were still too fresh on the minds of most French to even consider portraying the Nazi occupation comically. Then writer/director Jean-Paul Rappeneau came along. Rappeneau hit upon the idea shortly after he gained a foothold in the business as a writer, collaborating with Louis Malle on the screen adaptation of Zazie dans le metro (1960). Rappeneau's rapid-fire screwball comedy owes much to Hollywood masters Howard Hawks and Ernst Lubitsch. On set, he often recited the lines for his actors in an effort to get them to pick up the pace. His masterpiece Cyrano de Bergerac (1990) received 10 César Awards, including Best Director, and was nominated for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar®. Rappeneau's latest film, Families, is his first since 1995's The Horseman on the Roof,\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"The charm of his picture lies in the casual kookiness of his characters, plus the random and childlike unreality of the lovely, fragile, dead-panned Miss Deneuve.\"\n\n- Bosley Crowther, New York Times\n\n\"...one of Rappeneau's most entertaining and stylistically inspired films.\"\n\n- James Travers,Films De France\n\nUNCOMPLETED SONG / Comment c'est loin\n\nNorth American Premiere • Comedy/Drama/Musical • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 2.35 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 90 min\n\nDirected by: Orelsan, Christophe Offenstein\n\nWritten by: Stéphanie Murat, Christophe Offenstein, Orelsan\n\nCinematography: Christophe Offenstein\n\nFilm Editing: Jeanne Kef\n\nOriginal Score: Skread, in collaboration with Orelsan and Alexis Rault\n\nProduced by: Maxime Delauney, Romain Rousseau (Nolita Cinema)\n\nCast: Orelsan (Orel), Gringe (Gringe), Seydou Doucouré (Bouteille), Claude Urbiztondo Llarch (Claude)\n\nInternational Sales: Other Angle Pictures\n\nIf procrastination were a science, wannabe rapper duo Orel and Gringe would be shortlisted for a Nobel Prize. With their 30th birthdays descending upon them like a trainload of old, the boys need to rustle some hustle on the career front. Trouble is, in the five years since producer Skread began funding their studio time, these idols of idleness haven't managed to record a single song. Battling a host of personal demons, including fear of failure, denial, and a work ethic that defines dodging your pesky girlfriend as a full-time job, these princes of the preoccupied spend their days trying to squeeze what drops of creative inspiration they can from the banality of their own existence. Fed up with the excuses, Skread brings the hammer down; complete a song in the next 24 hours, or this circus gets its plug pulled. Set in the somnambulant gloom of Caen in Normandy, this hip-hop dramedy is based in part on the lives of rising rap stars Orelsan and Gringe.\n\nRapper, songwriter, record producer, actor and now film director Orelsan, born Aurélien Cotentin, has been compared to Eminem, both for his clever rhymes and his jokester persona. Like the character he plays, Orelson grew up in Normandy, but unlike his character, Orelson earned a degree in business management before moving on to more creative endeavors. His work has stirred up controversy in the past, especially his track \"Dirty Slut\"that had some sponsors pulling out of shows. He teamed up with Gringe in 2004 under the name Casseurs Flowters, a play on the translation \"Wet Bandits\", which is, depending on whom you ask, a reference either to Home Alone, or to something that should be googled only when you're home and alone. Writer/co-director Christophe Offenstein, for whom this is also a debut directing effort, is an established cinematographer known for Tell No One (2006), and Blood Ties (2013). Offenstein's extensive experience tempered Orelson's frenetic energy and brought veracity to his performance. Co-writer Stéphanie Murat is best known for her acting work, but she has also written and directed features, most recently Max (2013) and Victoire (COLCOA 2005).\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"...there's no denying the wry lyrical powers on display here.\"\n\n- Jordan Mintzer, Hollywood Reporter\n\nHOPEFULLY / Encore heureux\n\nWest Coast Premiere • Black Comedy • France, 2016\n\nDCP • 1.85 • Dolby • Color • 93 min\n\nDirected by: Benoît Graffin\n\nWritten by: Benoît Graffin, Nicolas Bedos, Mika Tard, Deborah Saïag\n\nCinematography: Antoine Héberlé\n\nFilm Editing: Jennifer Augé\n\nOriginal Score: Stephen Coates\n\nProduced by: E.D.I.

That's the conceit of this outlandish tragicomedy pairing two of France's best comic actors, Edouard Baer and Sandrine Kiberlain, as a couple whose fortunes have gone south - on the real. After two years with no income, Sam and Marie have downsized everything, including their moral standards. Poverty? Homelessness? It's not supposed to happen to good people like this. But somehow, they've gone from dreaming of ways to get ahead to scheming up ways just to get by, even if that means taking advantage of little old ladies, or selling your \"assets\" to a handsome neighbor. Oh, and the kids? They're in on the act. With one dirty little deed, the model family has dug themselves into a nice deep hole. Now all they can do is hope that no one will ever find out what's buried down there.\n\nFifteen years have passed since writer/director Benoît Graffin called the shots for his feature Beach Café (2001), based on a short story by Moroccan writer Mohammed Mrabet. During that time Graffin has kept busy with a successful writing career, notably collaborating with Pierre Salvadori on many films, including Priceless (COLCOA 2007) and In the Courtyard (COLCOA 2014), as well as co-writing The Girl From Monaco (COLCOA 2009) with director Anne Fontaine. In fact, it was while co-writing actor/director Edouard Baer's upcoming feature Ouvert la nuit that Graffin decided that Baer would be perfect for the role of Sam and asked him to read the script. Ironically, for the screenplay of his own film, Graffin worked with a team of three other writers, Nicolas Bedos, Mika Tard, Deborah Saïag, all of whom have multiple acting credits in addition to their writing.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"...one of the more memorable comic takes on France's recent and ongoing economic woes.\"\n\n- Jordan Mintzer Hollywood Reporter\n\nTOMORROW/ Demain\n\nWest Coast Premiere • Documentary • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 2.35 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 118 min\n\nDirected by: Cyril Dion, Mélanie Laurent\n\nWritten by: Cyril Dion\n\nCinematography: Alexandre Léglise\n\nFilm Editing: Sandie Bompar\n\nOriginal Score: Fredrika Stahl\n\nProduced by: Bruno Lévy\n\nInternational Sales: Elle Driver\n\nThis entertaining and eye-opening winner of the 2016 Best Documentary César offers some provocative solutions to the hard challenges facing much of humanity. In 2012, extinction experts Anthony Barnosky and Elizabeth Hadly published a paper warning of a coming planetary \"sixth extinction,\" beginning as soon as two generations from now. When environmental activist Cyril Dion shared the article with actress Mélanie Laurent, they decided to team up for a personal journey across ten countries to see what, if anything, could be done. They sought out those pioneers who challenge the old narratives and buck conventional wisdom in agriculture, energy, the economy, democracy, and education. Laurent and Dion quickly understood that they weren't making another pessimistic, moralizing eco-doc, but an inspiring futuristic vision, because those who are offering the most effective solutions today are actually reinventing the world of tomorrow. With humor, stunning imagery, and a musical assist from Swedish songstress Fredrika Stahl, Tomorrow is an emphatic declaration of hope.\n\nCo-directors Mélanie Laurent and Cyril Dion insist that this is not their film. It belongs to the thousands of people who crowdfunded the project. Their goal to raise 200,000 euros in two months was met in two days, and they went on to break a documentary fundraising record. Dion began writing the project in 2010, but when he fully absorbed the implications of the Barnosky/Hadly findings, he resigned his position as head of the Mouvement Colibris (Hummingbird Movement), the environmental NGO he co-founded, in order to dedicate himself to what would become his first feature film. This is the third feature outing for Mélanie Laurent, whose previous features focused on female friendship and bonding. Her first film, The Adopted, won the COLCOA First Feature Award in 2012. Her sophomore effort, Breathe (2014) tackled a toxic friendship between two teenage girls. Laurent is better known stateside as an actress starring with some of Hollywood's biggest names including Brad Pitt (Inglourious Basterds) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Enemy).\n\nFAMILIES / Belles familles\n\nUS Premiere • Comedy/Drama • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 2.35 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 113 min\n\nDirected by: Jean-Paul Rappeneau\n\nWritten by: Jacques Fieschi, Philippe Le Guay, Jean-Paul Rappeneau, Julien Rappeneau\n\nCinematography: Thierry Arbogast\n\nFilm Editing: Véronique Lange\n\nOriginal Score: Martin Rappeneau\n\nProduced by: Laurent Pétin, Michèle Halberstadt (ARP Sélection)\n\nCast: Mathieu Amalric (Varenne), Marine Vacth (Louise), Gilles Lellouche (Grégoire Piaggi), Nicole Garcia (Suzanne Varenne), Karin Viard (Forence), Guillaume de Tonquedec (Jean-Michel Varenne), André Dussollier (Pierre Cotteret)\n\nInternational Sales: TF1 International • tf1international.com\n\nMathieu Amalric leads a nimble comedic cast as Jérôme, a globetrotting businessman based in Shanghai, who makes a pit stop in Paris to introduce his business partner/fiancée to his mother.

Upon arrival, Jérôme's finds that his private memory lane is about to be paved over by the highway of progress. To begin with, the man threatening to lay his ancestral home to block-development waste is none other than Grégoire, an old rival from school. Then it dawns on him that for years his father had been managing an elaborate alternate life in the old place. But it's Grégoire's girlfriend Louise (Young and Beautiful revelation Marine Vacth) that really intrigues him. She dislikes him more than she should, for a man she just met.\n\nWhen his big budget international espionage project hit a roadblock, veteran writer/director Jean-Paul Rappeneau took a detour that led him to a more autobiographical approach, and a return to the high-energy comedy of earlier films like Call Me Savage (1975 - COLCOA 2012). Known for his meticulous blocking and dynamic camera moves, the Rappeneau style reached its apex in lavish period productions Cyrano de Bergerac (1990) and The Horseman on the Roof (1995). Less known is the fact that Rappeneau is one of very few French writers to have been nominated for a Best Screenplay Oscar (That Man From Rio, 1964). To help shape his latest screenplay, Rappeneau enlisted co-writers Philippe Le Guay (The Women on the 6th Floor, COLCOA 2011), and son Julien Rappeneau (My Way, COLCOA 2012).

Benoît Poelvoorde brings his signature staccato to the role of Bruno, a lonely, patched-together, wannabe-anything-but cattle farmer. Bruno hopes to drink his way through his personal crisis by taking the \"national wine tour\", a series of regional wine stalls at Paris' annual agriculture trade fair. When Bruno's buzz turns belligerent, his father Jean decides that a tour of the real wine country is just the thing to help his son better appreciate France's rural traditions. On the spot, Jean hires a cabbie, the handsome but smug city slicker Mike, and the unlikely trio hoof it out to the countryside to squeeze in a little drinking between hilariously awkward hookups and offbeat encounters, including one with author Michel Houellebecq as a disturbing B&B proprietor. Gérard Depardieu brings some heft to the proceedings as the genial, but slightly befuddled dad hoping to reconnect with his wayward son.\n\nThe holy terrors of Franco-Belgian film are back with their seventh film. Writing/directing duo Benoît Delépine and Gustave Kervern are specialists when it comes to the anarchic road trip comedy. There's the cross-country wheelchair \"odd-yssey\"Aaltra (COLCOA 2005). There's Depardieu starring as a not-so-easy-rider in Mammuth (COLCOA 2011), and there's Near Death Experience (2014) in which Michel Houellebecq takes a philosophical spin as a suicidal cyclist. Their work has always flirted with the absurd, as with the Sundance Special Jury Prize winner Louise-Michel (COLCOA 2009) about factory workers pooling their money to hire a hit man to kill the boss, and Avida (2006), about a dognapping by two deaf-mute ketamine addicts. But as chaotic and broad as their films can be, there is usually a touch of authentic tenderness extended to their characters, even if some of them don't deserve it. Both Delépine and Kervern got their start in TV, doing political satire.

Jeannot (Gabin) convinces the others to pool their windfall and repair to the banks of the river Marne, there to transform an old ruin into a guinguette (open-air café), to be owned and operated collectively. Their metaphorical utopian community begins to collapse as defections and misfortunes gradually dwindled their numbers and their morale. Until finally, the intrusion of conniving uber-vixen Gina crushes the last vestiges of fraternal solidarity. The film's cheerful, idyllic set-up serves to make the final, pessimistic gut punches land all the more effectively. Considered a masterwork of Julien Duvivier, a more prolific but lesser known contemporary of Jean Renoir, COLCOA is pleased to present the North American Premiere of the restored version, with its rarely seen original ending.\n\nIn 1936 much of France was swept up in the enthusiasm for leftist politics culminating in the election of the socialist Front Populaire. Not everyone was so smitten with the ideology, however, and two of its skeptics were screenwriter Charles Spaak and writer/director Julien Duvivier. They set out to make a film that mocked what they saw as the hopeless naiveté of the left. The result was a film so completely out of step with the mood of the times that after a short, disastrous theatrical run, producer Arys Nissotti convinced Duvivier to shoot a more optimistic ending. The new cut sat better with audiences at the time, but today feels disjointed since the ending contradicts everything that came before it. Thought to be lost, a copy of the film with the original version of the final reel was recently unearthed in the Cineteca Nazionale in Rome. Known as a \"Poet of the Real\", Duvivier made 67 films, among which are a score of unsung masterpieces. He is perhaps best known for Pépé le Moko (1937) one of his many collaborations with Jean Gabin.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"...among Julien Duvivier's most sarcastic and most frighteningly prescient.\"\n\n- James Travers, Films De France\n\n\"...one of [French Cinema's] master directors, albeit one whose full measure has yet to be taken.\n\n- Scott Foundas, Village Voice\n\nDon'T TEll ME THE BOY WAS MAD / Une histoire de fou\n\nU.S. Premiere • Drama • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 1.85 • Dolby 5.1 • Color/Black & white • 134 min\n\nDirected by: Robert Guédiguian\n\nWritten by: Robert Guédiguian, Gilles Taurand,\n\nBased on the autobiography by: José Antonio Gurriaran\n\nCinematography: Pierre Milon\n\nFilm Editing: Bernard Sasia\n\nOriginal Score: Alexandre Desplat\n\nProduced by: Agat Films & Cie / Ex Nihilo\n\nCast: Simon Abkarian (Hovannès Alexandrian), Ariane Ascaride (Anouch Alexandrian), Grégoire Leprince-Ringuet (Gilles Teissier), Syrus Shahidi (Aram Alexandrian), Robinson Stévenin (Soghomon Tehlirian)\n\nInternational Sales: MK2 • mk2pro.com\n\nAgainst a backdrop of militant attacks sweeping 1980s Europe, this absorbing tale dives headfirst into themes of collective guilt, historical amnesia, and radicalization. Aram, a young man of Armenian descent, grows up in Marseille hearing stories of Turkish brutality and genocide against his people. Although these are the sins of a past generation, Aram's pitched rage leads him to lash out against a Turkish diplomat in Paris. Fleeing to Beirut to join the Armenian Liberation Army, Aram doesn't know that his bomb also seriously wounded Gilles, an innocent cyclist who happened to be passing by. When Aram's mother Anouch learns of her son's involvement in the bombing, her conscience gets the better of her, and she decides to pay a visit to Gilles in the hospital. Anouch's shame seems no match for Gilles' anger and bitterness, yet the encounter inspires Gilles to dig deeper into Armenian history - by way of imposing himself directly on Aram's family.\n\nBased on the autobiographical novel by journalist Jose Antonio Gurriaran, who was himself paralyzed in an Armenian terrorist attack and later defended the Armenian cause, this cri de coeur from writer/director Robert Guédiguian is a return to themes that have preoccupied him personally and professionally. Born to an Armenian dockworker in Marseille, Guédiguian makes films that confront social and political issues but add a touch of thriller or noir to the kitchen sink naturalism. Relying on a stable of regular actors, his early features were expressions of pessimism for the future of the French working class. Later films like Marius and Jeannette (1997) took a lighter, more charming turn, and garnered international acclaim. His ambitious Army of Crime (2009) pays tribute to immigrant resistance fighters in wartime France. For one of that film's co-writers, Gilles Taurand, this marks his third collaboration with Guédiguian, along with The Last Mitterrand (2005).

Morose and aimless, Eddie sees few opportunities for improvement from his barstool perch in the soul-sucking concrete gloom of the housing projects. Yet when Eddie is stabbed and beaten while attempting to stop some hoodlums from stealing a car radio, his life changes unexpectedly, and for the better. He's proclaimed a hero. His wife takes him back in and even finds an entry-level job. In a police line-up, Eddie fingers Ahmed, an Arab youth whom he recognizes, not from the attack, but from a sales training video. He can't say exactly why he lied, but as the law comes down hard on a man whose only crime is being an Arab with a good job, Eddie is trapped in his own downward spiral of volatility and rage.\n\nDue to the film's themes and violence, some may see it as a reaction to the November Paris attack but, in fact writer/director Emmanuel Finkiel has been working on the project for a decade. Finkiel began as an assistant director for Krzysztof Kieslowski and Jean-Luc Godard before winning a César for his short film, Madame Jacques on the Croisette (1999). His Holocaust-themed debut feature Voyages (1999) won the Best First Work César and was praised for its \"subtlety and restraint.\"A Decent Man may be more hard-hitting than his earlier work, but it shows the same measured precision and studied naturalism. The film was inspired in part by a real incident in which a friend of Finkiel, named Ahmed was falsely accused after the police rounded up everyone in the area with that name. Finkiel collaborated on the screenplay with Julie Peyr, noted for her work with director Arnaud Desplechin.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"This is a powerful ... and superbly acted film, rich in messages about class, ethnicity, and the trap of wage poverty.\"\n\n- Chris Knipp, Filmleaf\n\n\"Duvauchelle's intensity is perfectly calibrated, weaving together nervous tension with a tripwire pleasantness.\n\n- Jay Weissman, Variety\n\nKalinka / Au nom de ma fille\n\nNorth American Premiere • Drama • France, 2016\n\nDCP • 2.35 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 87 min\n\nDirected by: Vincent Garenq\n\nWritten by: Vincent Garenq, Julien Rappeneau\n\nCinematography: Renaud Chassaing\n\nFilm Editing: Valérie Deseine\n\nOriginal Score: Maxime Desprez, Michael Tordjman\n\nProduced by: LGM Cinéma SAS, Black Mask Productions\n\nCast: Daniel Auteuil (André Bamberski), Marie-Josée Croze (Dany), Sébastian Koch (Dieter Krombach)\n\nInternational Sales: Studio Canal • studiocanal.com\n\nMore intimate drama than thriller, Kalinka chronicles one man's quixotic, 27-year fight for justice in the name of his murdered daughter. Imagine it, your 14-year-old child turns up dead from alleged sunstroke at the house of your ex-wife's new husband, a German doctor with a history of sexual abuse. Worse, the autopsy report reveals evidence of abuse and mysterious injections, administered both before and after death. The sordid side of André Bamberski's story has been tabloid fodder for years in France. But questions about what really happened that fateful night take a back seat to Daniel Auteuil's fierce interpretation of Bamberski's obsessive determination to bring the case to trial in the face of mounting bureaucratic quagmires and spineless magistrates. As the situation grows more desperate, so do Bamberski's tactics, and when the doctor's extradition to France begins to look unlikely, the aggrieved father decides it's time to play a different, more proactive role.\n\nFor documentarian turned fiction filmmaker, Vincent Garenq, justice is more than a subject for a film. Of his four features, three of them are interpretations of court cases. Garenq's skill lays in his total command of the issues involved in the cases, and in his ability to plum the emotional depths of his everyday heroes, like the family man fighting to prove his innocence in Guilty (COLCOA 2012), or the journalist risking his career to reveal the corruption within a multinational bank in The ClearStream Affair (2014). Garenq is sometimes compared to André Cayatte, whose films, such as Justice is Done (1950), reflected an enduring fascination for the French judicial system. However, Garenq's approach is less moralizing, designed merely to point out, rather than to point a finger at, institutional dysfunction. Garenq's co-writer Julien Rappeneau, is also the co-writer of Families, the latest work of director Jean-Paul Rappeneau, screening its U.S. Premiere at COLCOA this year.\n\nUN PLUS UNE / Un + Une\n\nU.S. Premiere • Romance • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 2.35 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 115 min\n\nDirected by: Claude Lelouch\n\nWritten by: Claude Lelouch, Valérie Perrin\n\nCinematography: Robert Alazraki\n\nFilm Editing: Stéphane Mazalaigue\n\nOriginal Score: Francis Lai\n\nProduced by: Claude Lelouch (Les Films 13), Davis Films, JD Prod\n\nCast: Academy Award® winner Jean Dujardin (Antoine Abelard), Elsa Zylberstein (Anna Hamon), Christophe Lambert (Samuel Hamon), Alice Pol (Alice Hanel)\n\nInternational Sales: Davis Films\n\nIn this slow-burning romance, charismatic leads Jean Dujardin and Elsa Zylberstein play opposites attracting in postcard India. Celebrated film composer Antoine arrives in Mumbai to record the music for a Bollywood take on Romeo and Juliet. Already bored with the idea of scoring yet another \"movie for festivals\", the womanizing charmer sets his sights on Anna, the younger wife of the French Ambassador. Ever since his arrival, Antoine has been unable to shake a headache, exacerbated it seems by his much younger girlfriend, who keeps calling from Paris. Anna, on the other hand, is convinced that a child is the only thing missing from her relationship, and decides to go on a \"fertility pilgrimage\" to the holy city of Varanasi to commune with Amma, the \"hugging saint.\" With his awards and his self-satisfaction, Antoine doesn't see the need for spiritual quests, but with his girlfriend's arrival a few days away, he's got some time to kill. And who knows, a motherly hug might be just the thing for that nagging migraine of symbolic import.\n\nFew filmmakers are more in love with the idea of being in love than writer/director Claude Lelouch. After six decades of filmmaking and five life partners, the 78 year-old veteran remains ever the hopeless romantic of French cinema. Lelouch forged that reputation beginning fifty years ago with A Man and a Woman, a simplistic love story that earned him a grand slam of both the Palme d'Or and the Foreign Language Oscar. If his overt sentimentalism confounded his New Wave cohorts, audiences felt no such ambivalence. Over the years he scored hits such hits as Les Misérables (1995), and the thrillerRoman de gare (COLCOA 2008). Most recently his films have taken on a more autobiographical nature, with protagonists that are thinly veiled stand-ins for Lelouch himself, allowing him to explore themes of mortality and family ties. This is Lelouch's second collaboration with co-writer Valérie Perrin, who worked with him on We Love You, You Bastard (COLCOA 2014).\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"Lelouch diehards will not be disappointed by this new spin on an old theme.\"\n\n- Judith Prescott, French Cinema Review\n\n\"...casts a certain spell with its touches of movie love, its elegant score by frequent Lelouch collaborator Francis Lai, and especially its central performances.\"\n\n- Sheri Linden, Hollywood Reporter\n\nFAST CONVOY/ Le Convoi\n\nNorth American Premiere • Action/Thriller • France, 2016\n\nDCP • 2.35 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 102 min\n\nDirected by: Frédéric Schoendoerffer\n\nWritten by: Yann Brion, Frédéric Schoendoerffer\n\nCinematography: Vincent Gallot\n\nFilm Editing: Sophie Fourdrinoy\n\nOriginal Score: Thibault Quillet\n\nProduced by: Éric Névé (Carcharodon), Orange Studio.\n\nCast: Benoît Magimel (Alex), Reem Kherici (Nadia), Tewfik Jallab (Imad), Mahdi Belemlih (Elyes), Amir El Kacem (Yacine)\n\nInternational Sales: Indie Sales • indiesales.eu\n\nSpeed isn't the only thing that kills in this slick, turbo-charged road thriller. Benoît Magimel leads a band of banlieue bad boys hauling stash for cash while steering clear of the law. Tasked with moving 3,000 lbs. of hashish from southern Spain to Paris, Alex (Magimel) organizes a motorcade of four vehicles for a \"go fast\" - a flagrant, high-speed drug run designed to be so risky the police can't stop the traffickers without endangering the public. The scout car looks for trouble up the road, while Alex stoically drives the follow car, ready to intervene should trouble be found. The team's camaraderie is fragile, and as they tick off the kilometers, suspicion and paranoia make everyone twitchy. The tension kicks into overdrive when a firefight with the Spanish police forces them to take a hostage. Burning as much adrenaline as gasoline, Alex struggles to hold the team together as they make their mad dash for pay dirt in Paris.\n\nAction aficionado Frédéric Schoendoerffer has always been a stickler for detail and authenticity in his films, so as part of his research for this project, he brought in Yacine, a young man who had participated in 20 go fasts before he was caught and sent to jail. Co-writer Yann Brion, on his fifth collaboration with Schoendoerffer, spent several months working with Yacine as an adviser. Schoendoerffer got his first taste of filmmaking as an assistant director on his father Pierre Schoendoerffer's war drama Dien Bien Phu in 1992. His first feature, the thriller Crime Scene (2000), starred his brother, actor Ludovic Schoendoerffer, and was nominated for a Best First Feature César. From there, Schoendoerffer has gone on to make a handful of taut thrillers set in the world of crime, including Switch (2011), and Paris Lockdown (2007), his first outing with actor Benoît Magimel. As part of the final auditions for Convoy, actors were asked to drive as fast as they could while speaking their lines, with Schoendoerffer and his driving coordinator Jean-Claude Lagniez sitting in the back seat.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"...kicks off at 100 mph and manages to maintain that pace for most of the running time.\"\n\n- Jordan Mintzer, Hollywood Reporter\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 23\n\nON GUARD/ Le Bossu\n\nWorld Premiere (restored version) • History/Adventure/Romance • France, 1997\n\nDCP • 2.35 • DTS • Color • 128 min\n\nDirected by: Philippe de Broca\n\nWritten by: Philippe de Broca, Jean Cosmos, Jérôme Tonnerre,\n\nBased on the novel by: Paul Féval\n\nCinematography: Jean-François Robin\n\nFilm Editing: Henri Lanoë\n\nOriginal Score: Philippe Sarde\n\nProduced by: Françoise Galfré, Patrick Godeau\n\nCast: Daniel Auteuil (Lagardère), Fabrice Luchini (Gonzague), Vincent Perez (Duc de Nevers), Marie Gillain (Aurore), Jean-François Stévenin (Cocardasse)\n\nInternational Sales: Tf1 International • tf1international.com\n\nUS Distributor: Cohen Media Group • cohenmedia.net\n\nFirst premiering at COLCOA in 1998, this swashbuckling classic returns to our screen with an all-new digital restoration, and the swordplay never looked so good. Romance and revenge are the main ingredients in this sweeping adventure, set amid a lavish 17th century backdrop. Daniel Auteuil plays the stalwart Lagardère, a man of humble origins, but whose skill with a sword earns him the patronage of the flamboyant Duke of Nevers. The closest known heir to the Duke's considerable fortune is his slithery cousin, Count Gonzague, so when the Duke resolves to marry the mother of his newly discovered child, the conniving Count schemes to block their union at all costs. Lagardère is tasked to protect the Duke's infant daughter by hiding out with an itinerant theater troupe and raising the girl himself. As his young charge, Aurore, grows into a radiant young woman, Lagardère adds a new theatrical twist to his formidable fencing abilities, hoping that one day he will have the chance to avenge his patron and restore Aurore as the rightful heir.\n\nWhen On Guard hit theaters nearly two decades ago the popularity of the swashbuckler was ebbing, but thanks to the Pirates of the Caribbean films, the genre has many new converts. And few filmmakers knew better how to make it work than writer/director Philippe de Broca. In fact, his first big commercial success was the historical adventure Swords of Blood (1962) starring frequent collaborator Jean-Paul Belmondo. Although de Broca came out of the French New Wave generation, films like That Man From Rio (1964) and his cult masterpiece King of Hearts (1966) have a warm comedic style that weren't a great fit for the movement. Above all, what endures in de Broca's work is his ability to charm an audience, and his tireless insistence in doing so. It's no surprise then that although Paul Feval's 1857 novel has been filmed seven times, it is de Broca's version that best captures its high-spirited panache. De Broca was a prolific filmmaker, and continued to make films, mostly comedies, right up to his death in 2004 at the age of 71.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"...full of durable cinematic pleasures: a little sex, a lot of sword fighting and a plot that combines heady passion with complicated political intrigue.\"\n\n- A .O.

Dominique Leborne won the Best Actor Award in the Venice Horizons sidebar for his portrayal of himself - a divorced father of two trying to hold his family together at all costs. Usually, Dom is out on fishing vessels for months at a time, but when his daughter Mailys (Mailys Leborne) turns up pregnant, social services threatens to take custody of the kids unless he can spend more time with them. Dom has only known a life at sea, so his best shot at making his own hours is to get a boat of his own. But without any capital, his decision to stop working for others precipitates a downward spiral that brings the family to the brink of homelessness. This unassuming docudrama starring a trio of nonprofessional actors manages to blend just enough reality and fiction to get the best of both.\n\nThe third time's a charm for writer/director Samuel Collardey. Since his first feature, the Prix Louis Delluc-winning Apprentice (2008), Collardey has been honing his naturalistic docu-fiction approach. For his second film, Little Lion (COLCOA 2013), Collardey felt that his style might benefit from a little more fiction and story elements. But when the boy whose story he wanted to tell refused to play himself, Collardey was forced to use an actor, and his original impetus for the film was lost. Collardey was drawn to the world of fisherman, but it was his long-time screenwriting partner Catherine Paillé who first met Dominique Leborne on a short film she was shooting several years earlier. Before filming, Collardey spent nearly a year observing Dom. He slept on Dom's sofa, went to sea with him. At that time, Dom's daughter Mailys was estranged from her father, and Collardy convinced her to portray herself in the film as a way of spending more time with him. Trained as a cinematographer, Collardey's camera perfectly captures the melancholy grays of Sables d'Olonne.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"...both moving and unpretentious.\"\n\n- Bénédicte Prot CINEUROPA\n\n\"He (Dominique Leborne) has a quiet sort of charisma that makes him rather exciting to watch.\"\n\n- Benjamin Rendall VFF Film Review\n\nNEITHER HEAVEN NOR EARTH / Ni le ciel, ni la terre\n\nWest Coast Premiere • War/Thriller/Fantasy • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 1.85 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 100 min\n\nDirected by: Clément Cogitore\n\nWritten by: Thomas Bidegain, Maxime Caperan, Julia Ducournau, Nadja Dumouchel, Fabien Gorgeart, Britta Krause, Franz Rodenkirchen, Clément Cogitore\n\nCinematography: Sylvain Verdet\n\nFilm Editing: Isabelle Manquillet\n\nOriginal Score: Eric Bentz, François-Eudes Chanfrault\n\nProduced by: Jean-Christophe Reymond, Amaury Ovise (Kazak Productions)\n\nCast: Jérémie Renier (Capitaine Antarès Bonassieu), Swann Arlaud (Jérémie Lernowski), Marc Robert (Jean-Baptiste Frering), Kévin Azaïs (William Denis), Finnegan Oldfield (Patrick Mercier)\n\nInternational Sales: Indie Sales • indiesales.eu\n\nU.S. Distributor: Film Movement • filmmovement.com\n\nU.S. Release Date: 2016\n\nWar-torn Afghanistan becomes a metaphysical netherworld in this evocatively eerie genre bender. No-nonsense Captain Antarès Bonassieu and 12 French NATO soldiers patrol a badland of endless dust and rock in search of a Taliban warlord called \"Sultan\". The unit is on high alert, relations with the villagers are fraught, and the Taliban are everywhere and nowhere. One night, while observing what appears to be some kind of ritual involving a tethered goat, two of his men disappear. Initially Bonassieu maintains a firm command on the situation. He believes he knows who took the men, and where they might be located. But as certainties begin to fall away, Bonassieu's grunts - hardened fighters to a man - are consumed with primal fear. Whatever is happening out there is bigger than the war on terror, and far more mysterious.\n\nThe French Union of Critics voted Neither Heaven nor Earth 2015's Best French Debut Feature, marking writer/director Clément Cogitore as a filmmaker to watch. Cogitore was able to attract a strong cast including Kévin Azaïs, who signed on to the project before Love at First Fight (COLCOA 2015) made him a rising star. Cogitore, an established contemporary artist with multimedia installations in exhibitions throughout the world, brought a bold visual approach to the film, even shooting extended sequences directly through the lens of night-vision goggles. He has made half a dozen shorts, including the docu-short, Bielutine - In The Garden Of Time, selected for Director's Fortnight at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. Cogitore's principal collaborator on the screenplay, Thomas Bidegain, has won multiple awards for his collaborations on such notable screenplays as A Prophet (2009), Rust and Bone (2012), and Dheepan (2015).\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"...an incredibly ambitious and daring work...intellectually stimulating and indefinably weird.\"\n\n- James Travers, Films De France\n\n\"...haunting and original.\"\n\n- John Bleasdale, CineVue\n\n\"...an existential trip.\"\n\n- Kent Turner, Film Forward\n\nI AM A SOLDIER / Je suis un soldat\n\nWest Coast Premiere • Drama • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 1.85 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 96 min\n\nDirected by: Laurent Larivière\n\nWritten by: François Decodts, Laurent Larivière\n\nCinematography: David Chizalet\n\nFilm Editing: Marie-Pierre Frappier\n\nOriginal Score: Martin Wheeler\n\nProduced by: Dominique Besnehard (Mon Voisin Productions)\n\nCast: Louise Bourgoin (Sandrine), Jean-Hugues Anglade (Henri), Anne Benoît (Martine)\n\nInternational Sales: Le Pacte • le-pacte.com\n\nIf you were thinking a willowy leading actress and a lot of cute puppies mean you're in for a schmaltz fest, think again. I am a Soldier is a hard-hitting drama about a woman compromised by the financial pressures of France's economic austerity. In a thoughtful, subdued performance, Louise Bourgoin plays Sandrine, a 30-year-old who, after a failed attempt to succeed in Paris, is forced to retreat to Roubaix and the working-class life she'd hoped to escape. Disengaged from the world, she takes a job working at her Uncle Henri's dog-breeding kennel. Everyone in her immediate circle has money issues, except Henri, and as she soon finds out, that's because he's operating an illegal puppy mill. Puppies are smuggled in from Eastern Europe, purchased by weight like meat; the unsold stock disposed of with little more concern. In desperate times money trumps morality and Sandrine stays with it, long enough to discover she has a knack for business. Intoxicated by finding her first real talent in life, Sandrine turns a blind eye to the dark side of the actual business she's in.\n\nThis year, COLCOA's Focus on a Producer is dedicated to Dominique Besnehard, who brings us this debut feature from writer/director Laurent Larivière. Shown in competition at the 2015 Cannes' Un Certain Regard sidebar, Larivière brings together the stylistic approach and techniques he's honed over the course making a handful of acclaimed shorts such as Lightning Struck Me (2006), and Les larmes (2010). Narrative restraint, naturalistic performances, and economic dialogue all bring to mind his chief influences: American James Gray and Belgium's Dardenne brothers. Parallel to his filmmaking career, Larivière creates films that are part of the stage design for theater and performance pieces. It was at one of his shows that he met and befriended actress Louise Bourgoin ( The Girl from Monaco - COLCOA 2009, Love Lasts Three Years - COLCOA 2012.) He wrote the part of Sandrine with Bourgoin in mind, though she was unaware of that when she first read the screenplay. This is also the first feature credit for co-writer François Decodts. He has recently collaborated on a new feature script for Heat Wave (2011) director Jean-Jacques Jauffret.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"...genuine and suspenseful.\" - Neal Dhand, PopOptiq\n\n\"...benefits from a tightly wound plot line and a select amount of settings.\" - Piers McCarthy, Live For Films\n\nONE MAN AND HIS COW / La Vache\n\nWest Coast Premiere • Comedy • France, 2016\n\nDCP • 1.85 • Dolby • Color • 91 min\n\nDirected by: Mohamed Hamidi\n\nWritten by: Mohamed Hamidi, Alain-Michel Blanc, Fatsah Bouyahmed\n\nCinematography: Elin Kirschfink\n\nFilm Editing: Marion Monnier\n\nOriginal Score: Ibrahim Maalouf\n\nProduced by: Yann Zenou, Laurent Zeitoun (Yume - Quad Films), Jamel Debbouze (Kiss Films)\n\nCast: Fatsah Bouyahmed (Fatah), Lambert Wilson (Philippe), Jamel Debbouze (Hassan)\n\nInternational Sales: Pathe Distribution\n\nIf Hannibal could get an army of elephants across the Alps, how hard can it be to get one cow across France? Fatah, an Algerian farmer played by Franco-Algerian comic Fatsah Bouyahmed, is determined to find out in this cheerful, comedic road movie with a twist or two. When his beloved prize heifer, Jacqueline, is finally invited to compete at the prestigious Salon de l'Agriculture in Paris, Fatah has to figure out a way to get there. After some encouragement from his fellow villagers, Fatah rounds up his courage and leaves his home for the first time in his life. Crossing all of France on foot, you're bound to have a few interesting encounters, and Jacqueline turns out to be a real conversation starter. Before Fatah knows it, he and his bovine BFF go viral, and even his wife and children are watching him milk his newfound fame on the village's one communal TV. Which is unfortunate, because with all those cameras trained on him, it's only a matter of time before something goes utterly wrong.\n\nThe journey to filmmaking for writer/director Mohamed Hamidi has been as full of twists as the protagonist of his film. While teaching economics in Bobigny, he got the opportunity to compose some music for Franco-Morroccan comedian Jamel Debbouze's comedy club. Before long, Hamidi was collaborating full time, working as artistic director for the comedy festival Marrakech du Rire and even writing material for Debbouze's stand-up shows. In 2013, Hamidi mounted his first feature, Homeland, about a young second-generation immigrant man going \"home\" to Algeria for the first time in his life. Both of his films feature Debbouze, who remains an important compass point in his career. Hamidi's strength lays in his ability to transform the contradictions of modern life in Algeria into comedy. One Man and His Cow is a riff on Henri Verneuil's 1959 The Cow and I, about a French POW who escapes Germany using a cow as a decoy.

Adopting a grounded, episodic approach, the film focuses on the challenges of cultural assimilation as seen through the eyes of two generations of women. Fatima is a divorcee holding down several menial jobs. She emigrated from North Africa at 20, but 20 years later, she struggles to speak enough French to communicate with her own daughters Nesrine and Souad, whose lives she is tirelessly devoted to improving. Nesrine is trying to strike a balance between cramming for her pre-med exams and dating, while the younger and more rebellious Souad is testing her limits and her mother's patience by acting out. Facing veiled racism, suspicion, awkwardness, and shame on a daily basis, Fatima discovers that the perfect outlet for her frustrations is also the best way to tell her daughters how she really feels.\n\nThe immigrant experience is on the minds of quite a few French filmmakers of late, but for writer/director Philippe Faucon it has been a career-defining theme. Samia (2000), shed light on the conflicting expectations of first and second generation Algerian immigrants. La Désintégration (2012) looked at the disillusionment leading to Islamic radicalization amongst a group of young men in Lille. The Betrayal (2006) turned the tables, exploring the struggles of a French officer torn between his duty and the excessive repression of villagers during the Algerian War. Faucon achieves portraits of startling complexity and immediacy, in part through the use of an almost docu-style naturalism. His casting of Soria Zeroual as Fatima, a non-actor who actually works as a house cleaner, is a case in point. For the script, Faucon consulted with Aziza Boudjellal, Yasmina Nini-Faucon, and Mustapha Kharmoudi to forge a narrative out of the poems and prose from autobiographical books by Fatima Elayoubi.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"...generous in rueful insight and emotional complexity.\"\n\n- Justin Chang, Variety\n\n\"...brings clarity and even a sense of exhilaration to the struggle of mother and daughters to succeed on their own terms.\"\n\n- Amy Taubin, BFI\n\nTHE INNOCENTS / Les Innocentes\n\nWest Coast Premiere • Drama • France, 2016\n\nDCP • 1.85 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 110 min\n\nDirected by: Anne Fontaine\n\nWritten by: Pascal Bonitzer, Sabrina B.

Set in the ruins of 1945 Poland after hostilities have ceased, the drama unfolds in a Benedictine convent, where the sisters try to maintain a tenuous grip on their faith after the chaos of war upends their cloistered existence. Mathilde, a young French Red Cross doctor is convinced to break protocol and make a house call at the convent. What she finds there disturbs her - a pregnant nun in the midst of a complicated labor. More shocking still, she discovers several more novice nuns in various stages of pregnancy, and a headstrong Mother Superior (Agata Kulesza, Ida) refusing medical assistance for fear that if word gets out the convent's future will be jeopardized. Secular and thoroughly modern, what Mathilde lacks in religious conviction she makes up for in compassion and decency, but she is ill prepared to confront the corrosive feelings of abandonment and shame overwhelming these servants of God.\n\nThis is perhaps the most restrained and intense film of writer/director Anne Fontaine, who is known for her more glamorous fare such as the glitzy biopic Coco Before Chanel (2009), and her frothy comedy Gemma Bovery (COLCOA 2015). With the help of co-writers Sabrina Karine, Pascal Bonitzer and Alice Vial, Fontaine creates a multi-layered story based on an original idea by Philippe Maynial, the nephew of historical figure Madeleine Pauliac, upon whom the Mathilde character is based. After starting out as a TV actor, Fontaine gained international recognition with her provocative third feature, Dry Cleaning (COLCOA 1998).\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"...intelligent, nuanced filmmaking at its best.\"\n\n- Judith Prescott, French Cinema Review\n\n\"...leaves us with a fresh understanding of our capacity to respond to suffering with good or evil.\"\n\n- Justin Chang, Variety\n\nBANG GANG (A MODERN LOVE STORY) / Bang Gang (une histoire d'amour moderne)\n\nWest Coast Premiere • Drama • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 2.35 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 98 min\n\nDirected by: Eva Husson\n\nWritten by: Eva Husson\n\nCinematography: Mattias Troelstrup\n\nFilm Editing: Émilie Orsini\n\nOriginal Score: Morgan Kibby\n\nProduced by: Didar Domehri (Maneki Films), Laurent Baudens (Borsalino Productions), Full House\n\nCast: Finnegan Oldfield (Alex), Marilyn Lima (George), Lorenzo Lefèbvre (Gabriel), Daisy Broom (Laetitia), Fred Hotier (Nikita), Manuel Husson (Le père de Gabriel)\n\nInternational Sales: Film Distribution • filmsdistribution.com\n\nU.S. Distributor: Samuel Goldwyn • samuelgoldwynfilms.com\n\nU.S. Release Date: 2016\n\nA heat wave isn't the only thing in full swing in this steamy drama about rich kids in the coastal town of Biarritz stripping down and shaking off that mid-summer ennui. As Young George, Marilyn Lima (think adolescent Bardot painted by Botticelli), unexpectedly falls for Alex after he coaxes her into a casual encounter. When the feelings aren't reciprocated, George tries to remind him what he's missing by instigating a game of truth or dare with enough dare in it to put a glint in the eye of a porn impresario. Aided by some selfies and the Internet, word spreads, and what began as an attempt to spark a little jealously explodes into a furious wildfire of sexual discovery. George, Alex, and their growing circle of libertine teens are now determined to find their limits, consequences be damned.\n\nTwenty years after Kids arrived like a \"cultural blitzkrieg\", Bang Gang (A Modern Love Story) raised eyebrows at its Toronto International Film Festival premier. Although the film's explicit depiction of too much, too young sex invites that comparison, first-time feature writer/director Eva Husson was thinking more Wong Kar-Wai than Larry Clark. An AFI graduate, Husson made a splash with her mid-length, Death Valley-set film, Those For Whom It's Always Complicated (2013), which French audiences would have seen on Arte. She has also filmed videos for music acts such as Florence and the Machine and M83. Husson conscripted M83 collaborator Morgan Kibby to make the film's mesmerizing synth beat soundtrack.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"Astutely milking its erotic appeal - and treading a delicate fine line this side of exploitation.\"\n\n-Jonathan Romney, Screen Daily\n\n\"Artfully shot and directed ...

As a member of the Russian aristocracy, 15 year-old Sasha is expected to make her debut in polite society, to marry strategically, and to live out her life as an obedient wife. But Sasha has other plans. She was born with the wanderlust of her grandfather Oloukine, an explorer of renown who has yet to return from his expedition to the far reaches of the North Pole aboard his unsinkable ship, the Davia. Meanwhile, the Tsar's treacherous nephew has used Oloukine's absence to tarnish her family's honor and Sasha is convinced that the Davia hasn't been found because everyone is looking in the wrong place. Without a ruble of her own, Sasha sets off to territories unknown, hoping to prove her theory and to restore the family reputation, even if it leaves her marriage prospects in ruins.\n\nDirector Rémi Chayé decided to animate his first feature in 2D, a bold choice for a spectacular adventure story. This graphically simplified technique had the advantages of allowing him to focus more on color, and of helping to evoke the nostalgic worlds of two major influences: Jack London and Jules Verne. In development since 2005, the film was a labor of love for Chayé, who began as an illustrator for comics and advertising before making his way through the ranks of animation starting as a storyboarder for films like L'île de Black Mór (2004), Secret of the Kells (2009), and The Painting (2011). The idea for the film came to Chayé through TV writer Claire Paoletti, who, using Shackleton's polar expedition as a major reference, developed the full treatment from a one-page outline. Two writers contributed to the screenplay, Patricia Valeix completed the second draft and Fabrice de Costil added the dialogue and final polish.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n\"This is what movies used to do, and this is why Long Way North deserves a wide audience.\"\n\n- Vassilis Kroustallis, Zippy Frames\n\n\"...told in an enchanting manner with equal focus on the animation as well as strong character development.\"\n\n-Jason Bechervaise, Screen Daily\n\nTHE FRANKENSTEIN COMPLEX / Le Complexe de Frankenstein\n\nNorth American Premiere • Documentary • France, 2016\n\nDCP • 1.85 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 104 min\n\nDirected by: Gilles Penso, Alexandre Poncet\n\nWritten by: Gilles Penso, Alexandre Poncet\n\nCinematography: Gilles Penso, Alexandre Poncet\n\nFilm Editing: Gilles Penso\n\nOriginal Score: Alexandre Poncet\n\nProduced by: Frenetic Arts\n\nCast: Rick Baker (Himself), Joe Dante (Himself), Guillermo Del Toro (Himself)\n\nInternational Sales: Le Pacte • lepacte.fr\n\nBefore CGI, the great movie creatures were designed and built by hand. Over a century of film that craft evolved into an art. From Godzilla to Gollum, this documentary celebrates that evolution, taking a peek behind the curtain at special make-up effects, puppetry, animatronics, and modern digital techniques. Interviews and workshop visits with dozens of monster masters and creature creators like Guillermo Del Toro, Rick Baker, and Lord of the Rings' Richard Taylor reveal how movie beasts crawl, claw, bite, and growl their way into our collective imagination. And for cinephiles, there's a banquet of exclusive, never-before-seen footage from monster classics such as Gremlins, The Abyss, and Jurassic Park, the film that ushered in the digital effects era. A rich, entertaining tribute to the movie magicians who, like Dr. Frankenstein himself, know how to toss a few simple materials together, and make it come to life.\n\nAlthough they initially hail from different disciplines, co-writers/co-directors Gilles Penso and Alexandre Poncet have always shared a mutual love for sci-fi and fantasy films. As a critic and film historian, Penso contributed to filmzines like L'Ecran fantastique before making two documentaries focusing on French comedians. Around the same time, Poncet was writing reviews for the cult French publication Mad Movies. In 2008-09, Poncet was the director/editor/producer of the TV series The Incredible Horror Show. But it was as a film composer and producer that he first came together with Penso. In 2012, they made Ray Harryhausen - Special Effects Titan, profiling the life and work of the famed stop-motion animator. The film garnered international acclaim, prompting another collaboration in 2013, Derrière le masque des super-héros. The Frankenstein Complex is Pocent's first feature as a director and Penso's fifth. They worked on the film for more than two years, crossing the globe to get their interviews, and gain unprecedented access to normally restricted workshops.\n\nALL GONE SOUTH / Babysitting 2\n\nUS Premiere • Comedy • France, 2015\n\nDCP • 1.85 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 93 min\n\nDirected by: Nicolas Benamou, Philippe Lacheau\n\nWritten by: Julien Arruti, Nicolas Benamou, Philippe Lacheau, Pierre Lacheau\n\nCinematography: Antoine Marteau\n\nFilm Editing: Olivier Michaut-Alchourrou\n\nOriginal Score: Michael Tordjman, Maxime Desprez\n\nProduced by: Christophe Cervoni (Axel Films), Marc Fiszman (Madame Films)\n\nCast: Philippe Lacheau (Franck), Alice David (Sonia), Vincent Desagnat (Ernest), Tarek Boudali (Sam), Christian Clavier (Alain), Julien Arruti (Alex), Grégoire Ludig (Paul), David Marsais (Jean)\n\nInternational Sales: TF1 International • tf1international.com\n\nJust one-and-a-half years after Babysitting found box office gold in France, the boys are back with a sequel, and ready to double down on the mayhem. This time they export their antics to a quiet, upscale eco-resort in the Brazilian rainforest. Trying to get serious with his life, Franck agrees to finally meet his girlfriend Sonia's father, Alain, the pompous director of the resort. Without thinking it through, Franck invites his wrecking crew, Sam, Ernest, and Alex, along for the vacation of their lives. It's not the smartest move, because soon his best buds are sabotaging his attempts to prove his worthiness to the potential father-in-law. The most damning evidence comes in the form of a GoPro camera found deep in the jungle - it's disturbing but hilarious footage, the only clue in the mysterious disappearance of the gang. Tongue-in-cheek adventure meets cheeky sketch comedy, with surprisingly combustible results.\n\nBefore the editing was complete on Babysitting (COLCOA 2014), the same team of writers was already at work on the screenplay for All Gone South. This time, actor/co-writer/co-director Philippe Lacheau took the American survival reality TV show Man vs. Wild as the inspiration. The filmmakers' early commitment to doing all the stunts in real life, as in Man vs. Wild, led to some harrowing real life moments, including jumping headfirst from airplanes at high altitudes. Lacheau, along with co-writer Julien Arruti and actor Tarek Boudali, first gained notoriety as members of the French TV comedy troupe La Bande à Fifi. Before working on the Babysitting films, co-writer/co-director Nicolas Benamou made his directorial debut with the comedy feature, De l'huile sur le feu (2011). Co-writer Pierre Lacheau is the brother of Philippe Lecheau.\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"...willing to go anywhere to land a laugh.\"\n\n- Jordan Mitzner, HOLLYWOOD REPORTER\n\nFANNY'S JOURNEY/ Le Voyage de Fanny\n\nWorld Premiere • Drama, war • France, Belgium, 2016\n\nDCP • 1.85 • Dolby 5.1 • Color • 95 min\n\nDirected by: Lola Doillon\n\nWritten by: Lola Doillon, Anne Peyregne\n\nCinematography: Pierre Cottereau\n\nFilm Editing: Valérie Deseine\n\nProduced by: Saga Blanchard (Origami Films), Marie de Lussigny (Bee Films)\n\nCast: Léonie Souchaud (Fanny), Cécile de France (Madame Forman), Stéphane De Groodt (Jean), Fantine Harduin (Erika), Juliane Lepoureau (Georgette)\n\nInternational Sales: Indie Sales • indiesales.eu\n\nRelease date in France: May 18, 2016\n\nCOLCOA's audience will be the first in the world to see this poignant story of a brave and resourceful young girl leading a small band of orphans through Nazi-occupied Europe. Based on the autobiography of Fanny Ben Ami, the journey starts in 1939. After the arrest of her father in Paris, Fanny and her younger sisters, Erica and Georgette, are sent to a refectory for Jewish children in a neutral zone. For a time, she and her new friends are safe, but the war catches up to them soon enough, forcing them to flee. Fanny, now all of 13 years-old, has always relied on adults to take care of her, but as Mussolini's Italy collapses and the chaos of war closes in, Fanny has to be the adult for a group of eight children. Hounded on all sides, and with nothing but her wits and her newly discovered fearlessness, Fanny resolves to do whatever it takes to get her young charges safely to the Swiss border. Fanny's Journey is a tale of survival seen through the eyes of children coming-of-age amidst the horrors of WWII.\n\nThis is the third feature from writer/director Lola Doillon and her most ambitious to date. Her debut, Et toi t'es sur qui?, is a coming-of-age romantic drama that screened in Cannes' Un Certain Regard section in 2007. Doillon followed that up with the psychological drama In Your Hands (2010), starring Kristin Scott Thomas. Doillon wrote both of her previous films, but here she collaborated with veteran TV writer Anne Peyregne to tackle Fanny Ben Ami's epistolary autobiography. Filmmaking was the Doillon family business. Her mother is editor Noelle Boisson, and her father is director Jacques Doillon, with whom she got her start as an assistant director. Now married to director Cedric Klapisch, Doillon is keeping the tradition going. In addition to her feature work, Doillon is branching out into TV. In 2015 she directed two episodes of the new France 2 show, Call My Agent, screening in COLCOA's Television section this year.\n\nMONDAY APRIL 25\n\nDELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR / La Folie des grandeurs\n\nU.S. Premiere (restored version) • Comedy • France, 1971\n\nDCP • 1.66 • Mono • Color • 110 min\n\nDirected by: Gérard Oury\n\nWritten by: Gérard Oury, Danièle Thompson, Marcel Jullian\n\nCinematography: Henri Decaë\n\nFilm Editing: Alber Jurgenson\n\nOriginal Score: Michel Polnareff\n\nProduced by: Alain Poiré\n\nCast: Louis de Funès (Don Salluste de Bazan), Yves Montand (Blaze), Alice Sapritch (Dona Juana), Karin Schubert (The Queen)\n\nInternational Sales: Gaumont • Gaumont.fr\n"
