        "text": "The Precursors of Music Videos\n\nBefore MTV, before rock promo clips, indeed before rock and before video, there were rock videos! Well, not exactly, but beginning in 1941 people could see short visualizations of top performers singing hit pop songs, on small screens across the land.\n\nWhat they were seeing were Soundies, the 16mm film software that fed an exhibition network of thousands of film jukeboxes called Panorams. The \"Mills Panoram Soundie\" machines were conveniently placed in bars, restaurants and bus terminals. Patrons of these gathering spots would insert a dime into a large cabinet resembling an overgrown record jukebox, but with a glass rear-projection screen. Shortly after, a 16mm projection mechanism inside would rumble to life, and the lucky clientele would see what was probably their first moving image of performers they had previously only heard on the radio.\n\nSome of these film clips were straightforward recordings of a visual and audio music performance, showing a band in a nightclub like setting. Others were much more complex and imaginative, using multiple scenes, fantasy story lines, comic relief and sophisticated optical effects; in other words, exactly like what is seen today on MTV, except shot in black and white and featuring swing and pop music of the World War II era.\n\nThis is our page devoted to the original coin-operated music clips.\n\nThe performers and musical styles featured in our SoundiesCollection offer a rich variety of well-known jazz and swing artists, lesser known dance bands, and forgotten novelty acts. We've also included some clips from the 30ies and the 40ies plus a complete 1955 movie,\"Rhythm and Blues Revue\", a real gem!Before MTVMusical Footage from 1930 to 1955 CollectionWe do provide duplicates of the multimedial files of the Collection on a customized DVD-ROM.(1)Almost all the digital copies of the films are good quality Hi-Res editable videos.Hundreds of hours of footage from this Collection are available in different format, size and definition.

The initial comic skit, which occupies approximately the first minute of \"Harlem Review,\" presents stereotypes that today would be considered quite offensive (there is an unfunny joke about the African navy). The decor on the stage set is an alarming panoply of minstrel-show imagery. This stage set shows up in the succeeding dance number.\n\nThe latter part of \"Harlem Review\" presents Bill Powers, who appears to have a classically-trained voice; and the Brown Sisters, who are also quite accomplished performers.\n\nThe contrast between the first half and the second half of \"Harlem Review\" is quite illuminating. We can see the aspirations of black entertainers and performers struggling to achieve high artistic aspirations struggling against society's imposed limitations and stereotypes. This is quite a fascinating historical document.\n\n1937GeneKrupa-SingSingSing.mov\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nRun Time: 00:02:00Audio/Visual:Sound/B&WQuality: # # # #\n\nSing, Sing, Sing (1937)\n\nPerformed by Gene Krupa and his Orchestra\n\nThe best drummer in the world!

There are three soundies here. The first, “Male Order,” features women a guy can purchase on approval, who arrive in shipping cartons and dance in his living room. The second, “At Your Service,” is all about how women, specifically carhops at drive-ins, live to serve men, even to the point of wearing skimpy uniforms and dancing on car hoods so that the male customers can look up their dresses. The third soundie, “Playmates,” features grown women dressed up and acting like little girls, while singing the familiar playground song. The titillating quality of this gets pretty creepy after awhile, even though it’s obvious that these are grown women, especially when they bend way over to peek into rain barrels, so we can get a good look at their undies. Again, these soundies are appalling, but still lively and a great deal of fun. “At Your Service” has a great retro drive-in feel.\n\n1942-LampOfMemory.mpeg\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nRun Time: 00:02:00Audio/Visual:Sound/B&WQuality: # # # # #Lamp of Memory (1941 circa)\n\nDirected by Reginald Le Borg, stars Yvonne De Carlo.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:Yvonne De Carlo, was quite a good singer dancer, as this short proves. Lamp of Memory is a nice little song, with a latin beat, Dicarlo falls asleep and dreams of dancing with a beautiful latin man (don't we all?) and soon wakes up. Bad edit comes as she concludes the song. This was a fun little soundie.\n\n1943ca-AfroMood.mpegAvailable on DVDRun Time: 00:05:14Audio/Visual:Sound/B&WQuality: # # # # #Afro Mood Burlesque (1943 circa)\n\nPerformed by Amalia Aguillar\n\n1943-IDontWantToWalkWithoutYou.mpeg\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nRun Time: 00:03:01Audio/Visual:Sound/B&WQuality: # # # # #I Don't Want to Walk Without You (1943)\n\nFeaturing Kay Lorraine, Merle Pitt's Five Shades of Blue, and Frank Wilcox as the porter.\n\n1943OurTeacher.mpeg\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nRun Time: 00:02:42Audio/Visual:Sound/B&WQuality: # # # # #Our Teacher (1943)\n\nFeatures Henny Youngman.\n\n1943ChimeBells.mpegAvailable on DVDRun Time: 00:03:07Audio/Visual:Sound/B&WQuality: # # # # #Chime Bells (1943)\n\nPerformed by Rosalie Allie\n\n1944BeyondTheBlueHorizon.mpeg\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nRun Time: 00:02:20Audio/Visual:Sound/B&WQuality: # # # # #Beyond the Blue Horizon (1944)\n\nPerformed by The Three Suns.\n\n1944GroovieMovie.mp4\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nRun Time: 00:09:17Audio/Visual:Sound/B&WQuality: # # # # Groovie Movie (1944)\n\nDirected by Will Jason\n\nProduction Company: Metro-Goldwin-Mayer M.G.M.\n\nPerformed by: Jeanne Ohelps-Veloz, Charles Saggau, Pete Smith, Irene Thomas and Arthur Walsh\n\n1945GotToBeThisOrThat.mpeg\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nRun Time: 00:02:23Audio/Visual:Sound/B&WQuality: # # # # #Got to Be This or That (1945)\n\nPerformed by Emil Coleman and His Orchestra, vocal by June Barton.\n\n1945Ca-JangoReinhard_hot-club.mov\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nRun Time: 00:03:52Audio/Visual:Sound/B&WQuality: # # # # J'Attenndrai (\"I Will Wait\") (1945 Circa)\n\nPerformed by Jango Reinhard and his Quintet of The Hot Club of France\n\nFrom Wikipedia: Acool short film of the great Gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt and his Quintet of the Hot Club of France performing J'Attenndrai (\"I Will Wait\") A newsreel-style announcer introduces the band as they lounge around a room, smoking and playing cards while a young Django and Stephane Grappelli lightly jam. Then it goes into a full blown performance of the Quintet. You can get a good view of Django's fret hand, which had two damaged fingers from a fire he suffered when he was eighteen. Despite his permanent hand injury, Django went on to be one of the main innovators of using the guitar as a melody instrument, along with Charlie Christian, Lonnie Johnson and Sister Rosetta Tharpe.\n\n1945TheHouseILiveIn.mpegAvailable on DVDRun Time: 00:06:30Audio/Visual:Sound/B&WQuality: # # # # # The House I Live In (1945)\n\nFeaturing Frank Sinatra\n\nProduced by: RKO Radio Pictures\n\nFrom Wikipedia: Frank Sinatra is known for his roles as a thug, a gangster, a bank robber, a murderer. He reportedly had connections to the mafia in real life. His father was, after all, Italian. What we don't think of Sinatra as is a uniter of people from different faiths.\n\nIn this short film, Sinatra sings some campy songs that should only exist in the 1940s. Between songs, he stops a gang of young boys from beating up a young Jewish boy. He encourages them to be friends with him because \"religion doesn't matter\" and reminds the kids when they get blood from the blood bank it comes from Jews and blacks. He also tells how Americans of different faiths have joined together to defeat the \"jap menace\".\n\n1946Ca-Surrender.mpeg\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nRun Time: 00:02:30Audio/Visual:Sound/B&WQuality: # # # # #Surrender (1946 circa)\n\nPerformed by Perry Como.
