        "text": "Underwear of women for women. The Hiridjee Sisters founded the company in the Rue Bréa at St Germain in 1985 and made colorful boxer shorts for men. These quickly became a bestseller. However, the shorts were especially in demand among the female clientele – who did not even think about buying the shorts for their friends alone. So the idea came up to design lingerie for women who expect not only comfort, but also cheeky, fresh designs. And Princess TAM TAM remains true to this motto to this day – with unique style and trend awareness, bras are created that may have been worn by the t-shirt, but are still comfortable and stylish.\n\nOur task:\n\nClassic product PR, mediation, organization and processing of photo shootings, PR fair (Igedo Dessous / CPD) on behalf of the German distribution partner."
