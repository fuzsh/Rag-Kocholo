        "text": "Director: Stanley Kubrick\n\nProducer: James B. Harris\n\nScreenwriters: Jim Thompson and Stanley Kubrick\n\nCinematographer: Lucien Ballard\n\nMusic: Gerald Fried\n\nStudio: United Artists 1956\n\nMain Acting: Sterling Hayden and Coleen Gray\n\nLike most of Stanley Kubrick’s work, form and structure largely shape what makes The Killing so great. A caper/heist film molded in the same vat as John Huston’s earlier The Asphalt Jungle, it sets forth showing every last detail of the robbery from every possible angle. The movie brazenly shifts back and forth in a non-linear fashion with miniscule precision on how the robbery gets accomplished and how things inevitably fall apart. Each character is afforded a rich detailed background and given moments in the spotlight to let us know how they landed in such a precarious position. The examination of these noir characters is successful in opening up multi-dimensional nuances and making them come to life as real people with a desperate need for money and fortune. The character actors in The Killing are a who’s who of film noir. Marie Windsor (The Narrow Margin), Elisha Cook (The Maltese Falcon), Sterling Hayden (The Asphalt Jungle), Coleen Gray (Nightmare Alley) to name just a few, all seem to be cast in roles that Kubrick once saw each of them perform in other films. For most of them, they get to give one more great performance in a classic film noir before the final curtain drops on the whole movement. At times, The Killing feels like a lifetime achievement award for these thespians as they strut their stuff again one last time. The big difference is that this Kubrick film is no consolation prize, instead it breathes with vitality and greatness. In many cases, they are putting together their best performance in a picture that would contend with the greatest in which they have ever been involved.

Respondants to this thread are encouraged to name their own favorite Lumet films.\n\nAgain our thoughts are with Murderous Ink and the Japanese people during the continuing time of crisis in the far east.\n\nMy own week was occupied by a host of school-related matters, with the weekend saved for seeing several films, an HD opera and a stage play in a tiny Manhattan 4th Floor theatre.\n\nRossini’s rarely-performed middle-career opera Le Comte Ory, was broadcast on movie screens in HD worldwide on Saturday afternoon at 1:00 P.M. I traveled to Secaucus to watch and listen to this utterly delightfully spirited piece, often referred to as an ‘opera comique,’ one widely considered a difficult bel canto work to find the right singers for. I hope to have a full review up soon.

Struck by a sudden, cold-sweaty panic attack while riding the train up from the nation’s capitol, he’s soon joined in the train’s smoking car by a cool and comfortable Janet Leigh, who flatly states that she was one of the Chinese workers who built the railroad. What follows is one of the most casually surreal and utterly unexplained moments of that film, or any other, as Leigh and Sinatra trade a series of exchanges that could be called stream-of-consciousness flirting. Is she one of his hallucinations, or filtered through his perception by them, still haunting his waking mind from the rainswept lobby of the New Jersey hotel he and his men were conditioned to believe they stayed in, while socialist agitators toyed with their minds? Is she an agent in disguise herself, attempting to unlock his scrambled brain with so many non-sequitor verbal triggers? As it stands, the sequence could hardly be more surreal if the car itself were to spontaneously combust and Sinatra were to wake up in his seat and find the train still speeding along its way, as though nothing had happened. One wonders if a little of that potent confusion might’ve had a hand in inspiring the recent release of Source Code, a movie that attempts to plumb the same depths of simulated realities, time travel and parallel universes that have been traded back and forth by modern-day sci-fi storytellers like bowler-hats in so many vaudaville routines. What sets this new one apart might only be the talent behind the scenes, and the pedigree it attempts to live up to from its previous work.\n\n(more…)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\n\nProducers: Buddy DeSylva and Joseph Sistrom\n\nScreenwriters: Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder\n\nCinematographer: John F. Seitz\n\nMusic: Miklos Rozsa\n\nStudio: Paramount 1944\n\nMain Acting: Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray, and Edward G. Robinson\n\nDuring my college years, I decided to minor in film history. I had always been fascinated by the process of making movies and the effort that went along with it. In those days, I was not very serious about cinema and considered it less of an art form and more as simple entertainment. I knew nothing about directors, silent film, or pictures made in foreign countries. I was blissfully ignorant of anything that had to do with celluloid. Back then, if you asked me to name my five favorite films (leaving out stuff like The Godfather or Raging Bull) I would of probably rattled off titles like Seven, Heat, The Usual Suspects, Fargo, and LA Confidential. While I didn’t know it yet, I had already started to develop an affinity for film noir-like pictures that would manifest itself further down the road.

It’s not now as well regarded as the Renoir, and certainly not seen remotely as often. Like many Duvivier films of the period, it’s become unfashionable, marginalised in histories of the French cinema. Of course it’s political stuff, and it has been accused, not without some cause, of drifting a little too cosily into melodrama in its last half, and yet it’s a film that thoroughly satisfies in the watching and its faults are to be dwelt on retrospectively.\n\nWe begin at the Hotel King of England, little more than a glorified tenement building for the unemployed, where five men are drawn together through friendship and fate, as they held a tenth stake in a lottery ticket which pays up its million franc dividend. The five men thus have a 20,000FF prize each coming their way and they make individual plans. Jacques wants to go to Canada and travel, Raymond wants to go to the country, Charles to get a small wood workshop, Mario to marry his beloved Huguette. Then there’s Jean, who suggests a communal trust between the five where they pool resources to buy a plot of land on the Seine and build/renovate a dance hall. Things begin quite promisingly, but Jacques is soon gone, saying he still wants to travel, but really he loves Huguette and can’t bear to watch her with Mario. As if that’s not enough, Raymond falls fatally from the roof in an accident and, as piece de resistance, another wrecking ball appears on the horizon in the shape of Charles’ poisonous ex- Gina, a nude model with no desire for anything but herself and her needs.

Here with John Huston’s 1950 examination of a bunch of crooks planning and then accomplishing a jewel robbery, we have one of the first of its kind. Since this movie would go on to influence so many other pictures with similar narratives, it would be criminal to understate its influence. This is a well-paced feature with a strong ensemble cast that runs for almost two hours. The A-picture running length does nothing to diminish its power. One of John Huston’s two or three best films in his long, and frankly, erratic career. It was also included in Warner Brothers Film Noir Classic Collection Volume One and is thankfully rather easy to locate and purchase.\n\nThe year 1950 was fruitful for film noir. In my humble opinion, it was probably the best year for the genre. So far in this countdown, The Asphalt Jungle has been joined by Panic In The Streets, Gun Crazy, and Where The Sidewalk Ends. Not to mention, multiple worthwhile selections that missed out of the top 50 and would have appeared if this were a top 100 list.

After all, most of my posts go around two subjects: literature and new films that should be taken into account, considerated to be in the year end’s lists. So, then, two things have happened, I haven’t had time to finish the latest Mario Vargas Llosa novel (‘The Green House’) since it’s long and not really that entertaining (and I recently left it at a friend’s house, and just today I’ll be getting it back, that’s more than two weeks without reading what I should have, but that gave me time to finish one of the funniest books I’ve ever read, ‘Good Omens’ by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman). The other thing was that I’ve seen some 2011 films and most of them will be considered for the year’s best (or worst of the year even… I’m looking at you “The Dilemma”, “Hall Pass”, “Sucker Punch”…), but there’s been a subject that has been interesting me recently and just now I’ve realized how it connects to the later aspect of my interests in this blog: 2011 films.\n\nI can feel enthusiasm when it comes to film, and it makes me value things more, I can sense when something is done with passion, may it be a script, a direction, a certain acting, something that’s made with love is specially noted by me, and I celebrate that in many ways. When people love what they do you can see it, and it shows, specially when it goes through a tremendous effort to make it through. For example, the movie ‘The Evil Dead’ (1981) may not be considered as a great movie, for many not even a good movie, but for me it represents what I’m talking about: Passion. Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, Robert G. Tapert , and everyone else that put so much effort, blood, sweat and tears, that it’s pretty much wonderful, a masterpiece in my eyes, and my fourth favorite movie of all time. I know it’s extreme, but the first time I saw it something clicked with me, and it’s been the only movie so far that I could see three times in a row without getting bored one second (I was doing nothing else at the moment, in fact, I should have been studying for the biggest test in the history of a chilean student, the PSU — University Selection Test –). Now I see the same passion in the new guys who now are in charge of Hammer Films.\n\n(more…)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nby Sam Juliano\n\nI felt like having a little fun tonight, though some might see this venture as impossible to negotiate. Well, I went year by year and found many more performances than 43, but slowly weeded down the long list to the final designated number. So many great actors didn’t finish on this list–people like Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Yves Montand, Marcello Mastroianni, Toshiro Mifune, Alec Guiness, James Mason, Michael Redgrave, Orson Welles, and so many others. I selected the 43 performances in a lead role, that stand among the greatest of all-time, not the actor who gave them, per se. In any case, I will save you all the qualification rhetotic, and just display the photos. Why an odd number like 43? Well, after making a number of cuts I wound up with 43, and couldn’t cut it down further. Not a single actor place more than one choice on the list, though this wasn’t really by design.\n\nI ask that all who visit this post to name their own choices, if you can do so. This list is not offered up in any kind of an order. Every one in this 43 is as good as the other. I listed them in the way I wrote them up. The list was revised early Wednesday morning to include two performances that were accidentally left off as per reminders by Peter Lenihan and Allan Fish: John Wayne and Bruno Ganz.\n\nPer Oscarsson in “Hunger” (1966)\n\nChishu Ryu in Ozu’s “There Was A Father” (1942)\n\nRobert Donat in “Goodbye Mr. Chips” (1939)\n\nSeverin Mars in “La Roue” (1923)\n\nRobert Preston in “The Music Man” (1962)\n\n(more…)\n\nRead Full Post »"
