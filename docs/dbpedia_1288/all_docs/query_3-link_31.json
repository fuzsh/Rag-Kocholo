That is why the current 40th anniversary of N. J. Blumherg, better known to everyone as Nate, has received such a warm-hearted response. The president of Universal-International has been a leader in his four decades in the trade, and always in the forefront. In connection with the U-I celebration, his friends and asso¬ ciates have published a booklet. Its foreword, we believe, is worth repeating: “This booklet is published by the friends and associates of Nate Blumherg, who over the years has symliolized what we believe to be the spirit and essence of show business. It is not intended as a eulogy, a compendium of praise, or evaluation of his substantial contributions to motion pictures. We wish simply to present, as appropriate to this occasion, a modest and necessarily incomplete outline of Nate Blumberg’s career over the past 40 years. “In our opinion, his story not only chronicles success but, more important, epitomizes the many success stories that can unfold only in our blessed America. As Nate so aptly puts it, ‘Where else but in America could this happen?’” The story of Nate Blumherg is fascinating. It is well worth the time of every industryite to read. Exhibitor joins with the thousands of others who wish him and his company well. May he he around for many decades more. _ THE COVER PHOTO _ Louis R.

SIDNEY FARBER TAKE PART IN THE DEDICATION OF THE \"JIMMY FUND\" BUILDING, BOSTON. The ‘‘Jinimv Fund” Building Becomes A Fact New England’s Variety Founded by the Variety Club of New England, and sponsored by the motion picture industry, the new \"Jimmy Fund\" building is a world center for research in the treatment of child cancer. Clnb Makes Possible A Another notable addition has been made to the long list of humani¬ tarian accomplishments by the mo¬ tion picture industry with the recent opening of the “Jimmy Fund” building as an adjunct to the Children’s Hospital in Boston and now the world center for re¬ search in cancer in children. The Children’s Cancer Research Foun¬ dation was founded in 1948 by the Variety Club of New England, then headed by Chief Barker Joseph S. Cifre, and, with John J. Dervin as the Foundation’s first president, an initial contribution of $45,536 was made. Shortly afterward, the country learned how children’s lives were being prolonged up to 22 months because of new forms of treatment by the Founda¬ tion’s staff under the direction of Dr, Sid¬ ney Farber, and the New England Variety Club sought aid on a national basis. “Jimmy Day” was proclaimed through¬ out six New England states. The Boston World Cancer Center Braves sent players to various cities to aid in conducting rallies for the campaign. By the time the first “Jimmy Fund” was ended, almost a quarter of a million dol¬ lars had been raised. The second phase of the campaign got under way in 1949 under the direction of the late E. Harold Stoneman, and Martin J. Mullin, representing the Variety Club and the industry, and Louis Perini, repre¬ senting the Boston Braves, as co-chair¬ men. Local theatremen were appointed chairmen of committees throughout New England. The Braves again sent players on the road to spur the drive. William S. Koster, Variety Club executive director, coordinated the diverse efforts, which re¬ sulted in an additional $351,251 collected in the second year of the drive. The building stands today as a tribute to the selfless devotion of the New Eng¬ land film industry, as well as a beacon of' hope for afflicted children. 8 EXHIBITOR William S. Koster, center, executive director, Variety Club of New England, is shown as he presented the club's check for $45,536 to Murray Weiss, treasurer. Children's Cancer Research Foundation, and John Dervin, the first president of the Foundation. Other directors present were, from left, stand¬ ing, the late E. Harold Stoneman, J. W. Farley, Children's Hospital head, Philip Marget, Dr. Farber, pathology head; W. Brown, and Parkman Howe.

It was designed for leukemia research and other cancer study. Republic's Forrest Tucker deposited his dona¬ tion in a giant \"Jimmy\" baseball at the entrance to the Braves Field before a benefit game. During a public appearance in Boston, Warners star Ruth Roman was pictured as she gave her contribution to the \"Jimmy\" drive to Koster. Warners' Burt Lancaster manned a bulldozer on the site of the \"Jimmy\" building as Dr. Farber, Dr. Louis Diamond, and George Foley looked on. Boston's Mayor John B. Hynes made the first donation in the \"Jimmy Fund\" drive when Koster, Sullivan, and Joseph S. Cifre, right, visited his office. Cifre was Chief Barker of the New England Variety Club when it founded the Children's Cancer Research Foundation under his direction, March, 1948.

He arranged for his hour-long show on Feb. 2 to salute the movies and the in¬ dustry without trying to cash in on it by advertising it as a competitive attraction to local theatres. In other words, if the public was going to the theatre that night, all well and good, but if folks happened to stay home that night, and tune in his show, then they received a detailed, interesting, and nostalgic show devoted to the industry, its past, present, and even the future. Murray’s decision to devote an entire hour show to the tribute of motion pic¬ tures came out of the thought that it would be an interesting show that the public would like to see, and that it might make it easier for the two mediums to work together. He opined that Ameri¬ can audiences want good television shows and good motion pictures, and that it will support both. He told us that he received, with one or two exceptions, more cooperation from the industry than he had expected. Murray named as particularly coopera¬ tive Robert J. O’Donnell, Arthur Mayer, Charles McCarthy, Columbia’s Nate Spin- gold, UA’s A1 Tamarin, 20th-Fox’s Pete Levathes, and Walt Disney.

Cited as causing the product jam are “Detective Story”, “Death Of A Salesman”, “Quo Vadis”, “Sailor Beware”, and “The Greatest Show On Earth”, all set to have long runs in Philadelphia, which will re¬ sult in their availability being unduly pushed back and causing a subsequent lack of product after March 1.

Lineups were prevalent, not only in the downtown houses, but also in the neigh¬ borhood houses. Theatre managers say business during the strike was off, but not like what the fights and “Bingo” games went through. They were shut up. Most seriously hurt of all the houses was the Casino, city’s only vaude house, where manager Murray Little had booked in name acts. Bright spot, however, on the strike picture was the appointment of Leonard S. Brockington, president, Odeon Theatres, as arbitrator. Brockington, it was announced, has refused to accept any payment for his services, doing the job as a public service. He has acted in labor disputes before, and all to the satisfac¬ tion of the parties concerned. Famous Players changed its policy in Toronto with respect to first-and-second- runs. The Eglinton, a suburban house, formerly teamed with the Victoria, a downtown house, in a dual policy, goes first- and second-run on its own. Colum¬ bia’s “Death Of A Salesman” will have its first Toronto run there, while WB’s “A Streetcar Named Desire” and MGM’s “An American In Paris” will have their sec¬ ond local showings. The Victoria has adopted a policy running pictures which first played in the art house, Towne Cinema. Prizes totaling $2,600 have been awarded to management personnel of Odeon The¬ atres (Canada) Ltd. Money was awarded winners in the “J. Arthur Rank Better Business and Showmanship Contest”, held MGM Sets Rome Meeting On ^^Quo Vadis\" Selling NEW YORK— Arthur M. Lofew, president, Loew’s International Cor¬ poration, last week announced that MGM’s top international personnel will gather in Rome from March 23- 29 for a “Quo Vadis” conferencei A total of 82 men will attend the seven- day gathering, including New York executives of the company, territor¬ ial directors, key sales heads, and publicity chiefs, who will converge on Rome from 37 countries. The confer¬ ence will set sales policy for “Quo Vadis”, and make plans for bringing the full range of campaign techniques to bear putting over the picture. Loew will preside at all sessions. during 13 weeks in which some 880 cam¬ paigns were submitted to the six judges. Prizes were awarded on basis for show¬ manship campaigns as evidenced in the , weekly reports, and these, combined with others received for boxoffice increase and upping of per-patron candy sales, led to inclusion in the Showmanship League. Final winner was Elliott Brown, Odeon, Victoria, who received $200 and an all- expenses-paid 2,000-mile trip to Toronto for the presentation luncheon. Leaders in the other five leagues, each of whom received a prize of $150, were A1 Jenkins, Vogue, Vancouver; Paul Allard, Electra, Montreal; Steve McManus, Odeon, Ft. William; Ed Pomerleau, Varscona, Ed¬ monton; and Bob Hardy, Varsity, Van¬ couver. Earning the most points in show¬ manship throughout the contest were Brown, Wanie Tyers, Odeon-Toronto, Toronto.

Einfeld Highlights 20th-Fox Philly Meet Philadelphia — “There is not enough fighting for our business,” Charles Einfeld, 20th-Fox vice-president told nearly 700 exhibitors last week at the company’s first regional merchandising meeting at the Erlanger. Calling for a solid bloc against detrac¬ tors of the industry, Einfeld asked that enthusiasm for the business, levelled against destructive critics of Hollywood and its products, be a watchword in all branches of the industry. He pointed out that 20th-Fox has continued to urge greater showmanship activity because of its belief in the product, and the neces¬ sity of making greater masses of the public aware of the fine entertainment coming from the studios. Einfeld backed up his statement on superior film enter¬ tainment with Kinescope examples of current television shows included in the program to illustrate some of the long- range merchandising plans already in work for pictures coming during the first half of 1952. To give the men a first-hand sample of the difference in values between video and film entertainment, he highlighted the session by showing them the last reel of the company’s Technicolor release for Easter, “With A Song In My Heart”, feat¬ uring Susan Hayward singing a medley of the hit songs identified with Jane Fro- man’s career. The screening of the fihn was enthusiastically acclaimed by the ex¬ hibitors, who were able to make first¬ hand comparisons with the television medium. Many exhibitors who received kits con¬ taining advertising, publicity, and exploi¬ tation material on the pictures asked for many more in order to furnish them to their managers. Home office advertising, publicity, and exploitation staffers who joined with Ein¬ feld in the presentation of the program were Rodney Bush, Stirling Silliphant, Alec Moss, Martin Michel, Eddie Solo¬ mon, Earl Wingart, Dean Justin, Will Yolen, and Ira Tulipan. The meeting was preceded by buffet luncheon, following which W. C. Gehring, executive assistant general sales manager, made the welcoming address, and listed the company’s 1952 lineup through December. \"'Movietime\" Ad Plans Progress New York — The advertising-publicity committee of the MPAA met last week to view sample advertisements to be used in the continuation of the industry adver¬ tising initiated during the “Movietime, U.S.A.” campaign. Following study and discussion of the ads submitted, a sub¬ committee was named to reconcile the various points of view, and to choose final ads which would then be shown the board for approval. To be decided is whether there shall be ads with an insti¬ tutional theme or plugging pictures, and as to whether they shall be handled on an individual company basis or jointly by the member companies. Charles Simonelli chaired the meeting. COMPO representatives were also present. February 6, 1952 EXHIBITOR 17 WE SCORE dOARd Industry Lists TV Hearing Witnesses Washington — The Federal Communica¬ tions Commission was advised last fort¬ night that when the hearings on alloca¬ tion of frequencies for theatre television begin on March 10, 43 witnesses will be called upon to testify by the industry. The MPAA, TOA, and NETTC, in a joint filing, told the Commission that Eric Johnston, president, MPAA, will head the list. Other top witnesses include Abram F. Myers, counsel, Allied States; Harry Brandt, president, TOA; Sidney Schrei- ber, general counsel, MPAA; Trueman Rembusch, president. Allied; Mitchell Wolfson, president, TOA; Nathan Halpern, president. Theatre Network Television; Spyros P. Skouras, president, 20th -Fox; Herbert Yates, president. Republic; Bar¬ ney Balaban, president. Paramount; Ned Depinet, president, RKO, and other in- dustryites. The witnesses will testify as to the com¬ position of the industry, history of the industry, history of theatre TV, public need and demand for theatre television, theatre television programming, technical requirements and standards for theatre television, sample theatre television micro- wave distribution systems, theatre tele¬ vision projection equipment, how and by whom theatre television service should be supplied, feasibility of theatre TV, theatre TV plans and proposals, etc. The Federal Communications Commis¬ sion had previously denied as unneces¬ sary and premature a petition filed by 20th Century-Fox to enlarge the issues in the forthcoming theatre TV hearings. The Commission said that “to single out and specifically to put in issue the fre¬ quencies allocated to the industrial service might imply that the other frequencies which might have been put into issue by petitions filed by other parties to the pro¬ ceeding are not also involved therein or that the Commission is giving some pref¬ erence to the use of industrial frequencies for a theatre television service.” The Commission said that up to now it has not assigned any frequencies to the¬ atre TV, and that one of the purposes of the hearings is to determine the orders of frequencies and the spectrum space required, if any, at each order of fre¬ quency which would be necessary to establish a theatre TV service. It concluded that the Commission has not yet determined whether theatre TV would be in the public interest, and whether the allocation of any frequencies for this service would be justified. In a joint request to Henry H. Fowler, National Production Authority adminis¬ trator, the MPAA and NETTC asked that a conference with theatre interests on color TV be arranged, if possible, ahead of the scheduled industry meeting. This was the second request for a meeting with government officials due to the failure of the NPA to include theatre TV inter¬ ests in the Feb. 8 conference with com¬ mercial TV set manufacturers on color TV. The Federal Communications Commis¬ sion also received a file from Skiatron Electronics and Television Corporation of the points it wishes to make and names of witnesses it will present.

February 6, 1952 18 EXHIBITOR Loew's Decree Submitted To Court Washington — The Department of Justice last fortnight consented to the entry of a judgment against Loew’s, Inc., last of the theatre-owning film companies to submit to divorcement of production and distri¬ bution from exhibition, and to divestiture of its theatre holdings.

It will separate Loew’s domestic theatre exhibition business from production-distribution, and will divest Loew’s theatre business of approximately 24 theatres, two-thirds in New York City, in two years, and conditional divestiture of nearly 50 more. The Department said that the proposed consent judgment is “contingent upon stockholders’ approval of a plan of reorganization, placing Loew’s Theatre exhibition assets in a company entirely disassociated from Loew’s, Inc.” This approval must be obtained by June 6. After the plan has been consummated, the Department stated, the two companies must be controlled, and managed “inde¬ pendently of each other.” Loew’s is banned under the proposed judgment from expanding its theatre own¬ ership during the original two-year period allowed for carrying out the divestiture and certain of the “divorcement” pro¬ visions of the original judgment.

An additional theatre shall be sold if any time during the next five years more than three Loew’s houses play first-run.

Theatre Enterprises, last week revealed that he was widening the scope of his original “unit program” idea, and was seeking further endorsement from exhibitors throughout the country. Klieman’s “unit show” calls for one “A” feature with two or more estab¬ lished stars of proven marquee strength with a running time between 75 and 90 minutes; a featurette of opposite appeal to the feature, with at least one marquee star and one or more new or unknown stars who have the ability and possibility of top star¬ dom, running time to average 30 to 40 minutes; a 15-20 minute public relations subject dealing with racial, religious, topical subjects; or docu¬ mentaries of any type as long as they would rekindle interest in the theatre and widen the scope of the untapped potential movie audience, and a color cartoon of comedy material suitable for both adults and juveniles. The complete “unit program” would run approximately 150 minutes. Universal-International Newsreel (Vol. 25, No. 529) San Francisco: Rrepresenta- tive Mack, Illinois, arrives after flight.

Dick Pitts, national TOA assistant execu¬ tive director, represented the national office. A system of grievance panel operation, starting at the local level and working to the national level, was established. With E. D. Martin as chairman, the dele¬ gates decided to forego a panel on griev¬ ances, and concentrated on organization and determination of the scope of future meetings. An advisory board to govern the region and act as coordinator between local imits and national TOA will be established, comprised of the presidents of each local TOA unit represented at the meeting; three delegates chosen by each president to accompany him to the sessions, and four delegates-at-large from the entire territory, appointed by Martin, TOA regional chairman. This board would meet three or four times yearly, or more often. The board would also be empowered to call regional meetings to have all mem¬ bers pass on recommendations to be for¬ warded to TOA headquarters in New York. Grievances reported by the membership, however, would not be handled by the board, but would be channeled through offices set up by the delegates. Every exchange center would have its panel of five TOA exhibitors, three of whom would sit on any given occasion. They would meet on call from any ex¬ hibitor needing aid. On the next level, a regional grievance panel was established consisting of 10 exhibitors, with Martin as its head. This group would meet when¬ ever complaints are forwarded from ex¬ change centers. The delegates voted to have Martin bring to the attention of the board meet¬ ing on the coast arbitration, protest against forcing of advanced admission prices by higher percentage deals, action on print shortages, clearance and run clarification, development of new stars, tiein sales com¬ plaints, the need for more salesmen, pressbooks which do not ignore the small town exhibitor in publicity and promo¬ tion campaigns, and better servicing by National Screen Service. Others present were: J. H. Thompson, O. C. Lam, R. A. Edmondson, C. L. Pat¬ rick, Roy Martin, and Fred Coleman, Georgia; Mack Jackson, J. H. Harrison, R. M. Kennedy, and A. D. Padget, Ala¬ bama; Jay Solomon, Tennessee; B. Garner, Hugh Martin, M. E. Hensler, and Bolivar Hyde, Florida; Lloyd R. Royal, Mississippi; A. Fuller Sams, Worth Stewart, Terry Reavis, and M.

NATIONAL BOARD OF REVIEW Jan. 26, 1952 Starred Selected F’eature: “The Man In The White Suit” (English-made) (U-I); Selected Feature: “The Sniper” (Columbia). February 6, 1952 20 EXHIBITOR FCC Resumes Taking Of Testimony Washington — Hearings in the taking of testimony by the FCC in the ABC-UPT, Paramount-Dumont argument were to have resumed this week. Previously, William A. Roberts, counsel, Allen B. DuMont Laboratories, had told Federal Communications Commission ex¬ aminer Leo Resnick, as the DuMont phase of the ABC-UPT, Paramount-Du- Mont consolidated hearing ended that he would file a motion requesting that the DuMont poi’tion be severed from the hearing, and that the commission immedi¬ ately grant license renewals to the Du¬ Mont stations. Roberts said he would base his motion on the grounds that the hearing has devel¬ oped that Paramount has no control what¬ ever over the DuMont operations. Attorneys for Paramount and DuMont had told the commission of negotiations whereby Paramount was to have disposed of its DuMont stock in 1950, although this never transpired, and it did not appear that Paramount was eager to sell. Frederick W. Ford, chief, FCC’s broad¬ cast bureau hearing section, placed into the record 1948 testimony of Paul Rai- bourn, president. Paramount Television Productions, Inc., in which Raibourn told the commission that Paramount would attempt to dispose of its DuMont stock. At that time, according to the testimony, Raibourn said Paramount would accept $10,000,000 for its DuMont stock. Raibourn, Others Heard By FCC Washington — Testifying before the Fed¬ eral Communications Commission last fortnight, Paul Raibourn, president and di¬ rector, Paramount Pictures, said he had attended negotiations in which Paramount offered to sell its Class “B” stock in the Allen B. DuMont Laboratories for $10,- 000,000. He said it was his understanding that the offer had been accepted, but that Paramount never formally heard from Dr. DuMont, head of the firm bearing his name. Wisconsin Arbitration Results In Two Settlements MILWAUKEE— Allied Theatre Own¬ ers of Wisconsin announced last fort¬ night that its arbitration committee, set up last month, had settled two cases. One involved the Rainbow and Parkway, which were offered a product split instead of the day-and-date playing upon which the Rainbow was insisting. Bidding between the com¬ petitive houses had been asked for by the Rainbow, but an amicable solution was worked out. The other case involved an exhibi¬ tor who had a picture pulled on short notice, causing him to make a special trip to the exchange center to secure product. The argument was over the expense account he submitted to the exchange. Both parties accepted the recommendation of the committee for a fair settlement. MGM Reveals Plan To Assist New Blood CULVER CITY, CAL.— MGM last week announced the organizaztion of a new production group, and that Dore Schary, vice-president in charge of production and studio operation, has appointed screen writer Charles Schnee executive in charge of it. Designed to give opportunity to promising young producers, directors, writers, and players, this is in line with the company’s established policy over the years of developing talent in every creative field. Selected as producers of the group on the basis of their production and writing records during the past two years of preparation for merited ad¬ vancement are Henry Berman, Mat¬ thew Rapt, Arthur Loew, Jr., Hayes Goetz, Sol Fielding, and Sidney Frank¬ lin, Jr. The group, it was stated, will produce from 10 to 15 films a year. According to Schary, the group’s pro¬ ductions will have no set budgets. These will be unlimited and flexible depending on the scope and merit of the individual subjects. The group is to have its own production set-up, including unit manager, film editor, art director, and technical staffs. DuMont testified the week before that he had offered Paramount $12,000,000 for its stock, but had been turned down. Raibourn told Leo Resnick, Commission hearing examiner, that the American Federation of Musicians is directly re¬ sponsible for the film industry’s refusal to supply current pictures to the tele¬ vision industry. He said the musicians would not play for motion pictures if the films are to be used for TV; but that actors have agreed to permit the release to TV of feature length films made prior to 1948. He also testified that Paramount has never and could not now exercise executive powers in the DuMont organi¬ zation because of the corporate structure; that Paramount has acquired numerous interests in the manufacturing field in competition to DuMont, and is prepared to pursue those interests. They include, he said, new developments in color trans¬ mission and reception, “scramble” TV and film manufacturing. There was no conflict between Para¬ mount and DuMont filing for TV in Bos¬ ton, he said. Paramount interests having filed there three years before DuMont, and at no time has Paramount exerted any pressure on DuMont in matters of policy or managment. Much of the testimony centered on pro¬ gramming and the “block booking” of feature films, with DuMont network manager Chris Witting describing the high cost of purchasing feature films for use on television stations. DuMont chief en¬ gineer Thomas T. Goldsmith, James Cad- digan, network director of programming and production, and Walter Compton, general manager, WTTG, DuMont’s Wash¬ ington station, were other witnesses. Witting said that his company would rather broadcast live shows than feature motion pictures because of the greater expense and other difficulties involved in films. FCC counsel Frederick Ford submitted a quantity of minutes of DuMont board meetings in an effort to establish that DuMont often transacted business in ac¬ cordance with Paramount’s wishes, es¬ pecially in regard to applications for station licenses. Dr. DuMont maintained that there were no instances of such de¬ ference to Paramount. The DuMont Lab¬ oratories head also testified that Barney Balaban, Paramount president, had blocked negotiations between Paramount and DuMont for either purchase of Para¬ mount’s DuMont holdings or reduction of the film company’s degree of control by stock transfer. Raibourn, in his testimony, continued that Paramount would be very glad to trade its DuMont stock for outstanding Paramount stock. He said this would be more profitable to Paramount because of the high dividend rate of that company, as compared with DuMont’s dividend rate. He also testified that Paramount’s selec¬ tion of Edwin Weisl and President Bala¬ ban to represent Paramount on the Du¬ Mont board of directors, in place of two other Paramount officers, Arthur Israel. Jr., and Bernard Goodwin, was to give DuMont management the advantage of the long and broad business experience of Weisl and Balaban. Raibourn maintained that DuMont poli¬ cies were largely determined by Dr. Du¬ Mont, not by Paramount. Hyman Plan Offered New York — A plan to assure a con¬ tinuous flow of good pictures, and avoid concentrating them at holiday peak per¬ iods, as forwarded by Edward L. Hy¬ man, United Paramount Theatres vice- president, will be submitted by COMPO to the distribution heads of the major companies at an early meeting, it was learned last week. Hyman’s proposal calls for exhibitors to offer to underwrite film rentals for good pictures during weak periods by giving minimum guarantees in addition to a similar offer to open top product a week before a holiday, and play it throughout the holiday period. COMPO is inviting exhibitor reaction to the idea. Moon Leaves 20th-Fox Post New York — Ray Moon, central division sales manager, 20th-Fox, has resigned from the company, effective on April 12, it was announced last week. Swiss Court Decides On Mickey Mouse Rights SWITZERLAND— The Swiss Su¬ preme Court ruled last fortnight that the name “Mickey Mouse” is not a “work of creative art”, and, therefore, is not protected by copyright. The de¬ cision came in a suit brought by Walt Disney Studios against the Mickey Mouse Restaurant in Zurich for alleged unauthorized use. The court, however, held that the Disney character’s image must be removed from menus, plates, tablecloths, and publicity. The court found that the name, but not the image, of “Mickey Mouse” might be used.

Yonkers, N. Y.: (See Mt. Vernon.)

Loew’s declares that since Jan. 1, 1950, it disposed of the Lincoln Square, the 42nd Street, the Boston Road, and the Burland. The decree also contains a new divorce¬ ment approach made necessary by Loew’s present outstanding indebtedness, which the Justice Department places at approxi¬ mately $40,000,000. Under this provision, a new theatre company will have to be set up within two years, and be operated in¬ dependently of Loew’s from then on, but Loew’s could continue to hold the stock of this new theatre company if it could prove to the court’s satisfaction that it could not refinance so as to divide the present debt between itself and the new theatre company. In that case, the theatre company stock could be retained by Loew’s until suit¬ able refinancing was arranged. The di¬ vorcement would have to be complete in any event within five years from now. From the time the new theatre company was set up until its capital stock was distributed to Loew’s stockholders, half of its board would be controlled by the New York statutory court to insure inde¬ pendent operation. If Loew’s asks more time to carry out better refinancing, and, if the court grants it, “then, after two years from the date of transfer of the assets to the new theatre company, no officer or director of the theatre company or of Loew’s shall re¬ ceive, directly or indirectly, any dividends on any share of Loew’s stock in excess of the mount of earnings per share of the company in which any such person is an officer or director.” The decree puts a Feb. 29 deadline on Loew’s ending its joint interest with United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc., but specifically gives Loew’s the right during the first year from the judgment date to license films on any basis it wants to its own theatres.

February 6, 1952 22 EXHIBITOR Communism Opposed At TO A Meeting Los Angeles — The TOA board of direc¬ tors in its final session last week went on record as opposing Communism, and sug¬ gested that its membership be rededicated to fight it. The TOA statement came in the form of a unanimous resolution. Over an hour and three-quarters was spent in viewing trailers. Regarding the trailers as a business stimulant, they were enthusiastically received. Elmer Rhoden was chairman at a public rela¬ tions meeting at which various suggestions were made to improve publicity at local and national levels, and a discussion was held concerning irresponsible columnists who, with selfish motives, attack the in¬ dustry without facts. A budget and plans for a national con¬ vention in Washington, D. C., in the fall were also discussed. Broadest Base Asked For Arbitration Plan Los Angeles — Unanimously adopted by the Theatre Owners of America’s board of directors meeting in the annual mid¬ winter session last week was a resolution offering the broadest possible arbitra¬ tion base for the solution of exhibitor- distributor problems, defining the scope as “any matter arising out of or in connec¬ tion with the film contract or any mat¬ ters involving clearances and run, or any controversy concerning competitive bid¬ ding.” Discussion on the arbitration mat¬ ter were led by general counsel Herman Levy. It was unanimously adopted that any and all arbitration awards handed down by way of the system be final and bind¬ ing on all parties. Even the possibility of eliminating appeals completely was in¬ vestigated by the regional directors present. A method of selecting arbiters was also approved. The complainant will name one, the defendant will name one, and the complainant and defendant will agree on a third. The board indicated that it hoped a national administrator would be ap¬ pointed to guide the processes and work¬ ings of the system. A working committee to further the TOA plan on its way toward realization will be appointed shortly. It was the intention of the framers of the arbitration plan, the delegates were told, to ultimately provide for harmony, efficiency, and economy. Board chairman Charles P. Skouras opened the first day’s business session with a welcome address. Skouras turned the gavel over to President Mitchell Wolf- son, who presided at the morning session. Alfred Starr was chairman in the afternoon. On the second day, the industry’s chances of obtaining channel grants from the Federal Communications Commission at the coming hearings were reviewed with Si H. Fabian, TV committee, stat¬ ing that he believed the outlook was ex¬ tremely favorable. Fabian, also chairman. National Exhibitors Theatre Television Committee, stated that the industry’s pres¬ entation has been thoroughly prepared, and has the added advantage of repre¬ senting a solidly unified industry. He claimed the industry is not fighting home Pamela Kellino and husband, James Mason, shown upon their recent arrival in San Fran¬ cisco for the world premiere of Republic's \"Lady Possessed,\" are seen being greeted by George Mitchell, San Francisco Republic branch manager. television, but is merely seeking to im¬ prove its own entertainment potential, and that film theatres will never discard fine feature film attractions as top enter¬ tainment, but will supplement such offer¬ ings with theatre TV as a “bonus”, gener¬ ally at no extra admission cost. George Jessel spoke on the aid the in¬ dustry can give to the recruitment pro¬ gram. He read a telegram from Anna Rosenberg requesting the aid of the ex¬ hibitors. A unanimous resolution support¬ ing the program was passed. The afternoon session was devoted to a review of questions to be presented at the round table meeting with studio heads. On the third day, the board unanimously endorsed the appointment of a special taxation committee to seek immediate tax relief on the federal level as well as any¬ where else TOA members are being oppressed by such levies. Executive direc¬ tor Sullivan took over the chair for the discussion leading up to the resolution. He recommended that the new tax com¬ mittee take its case to Telford Taylor, National Small Business Administrator, and seek immediate relief. Sullivan pointed out that the fight was a necessary one. Copies of TOA’s tax manual, containing a 15-point program on how best to fight back against unfair taxation, were dis¬ tributed. Also speaking on the tax prob¬ lem were Robert Bryant, president, TOA of North and South Carolina; Robert Liv¬ ingston, Lincoln, Neb.; Morris Loewen- stein, Oklahoma TOA; Marlin Butler, New Mexico; J. E. Cook. Kansas City; Mack Jackson, Alabama TOA, and E. D. Martin, Georgia. The board passed a proposal calling for an institute of scientific research at Palo Alto, Cal., to serve as a clearing house for all future developments in the fields of three-dimensional film, theatre tele¬ vision, magnetic recording, etc., to aid both producers and exhibitors. This came after a speech by Dr. Lee A. Dubridge, president, California Institute of Technology, on the value of scientific research to the industry, and a discussion joined in by Ray Clune, executive production man¬ ager, 20th-Fox; Sol Halprin, executive director of photography, 20th-Fox, and Tom Moulton, director of sound record¬ ing, 20th-Fox. Wolfson was authorized by a resolution to appoint a committee to study the feasibility of the institute, and to schedule meetings with other industry groups. Texas Censor Board Ruling Is Upheld Austin, Tiix. — Eight months after hear¬ ing arguments in the case, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals last week upheld the conviction of William L. Gelling, manager. Paramount, Marshall, Tex., who had been arrested and fined $200 charged with 15 violations of the municipal censorship ordinance in exhibiting 20th-Fox’s “Pinky.” This ruling touched only on the validity of the ordinance creating the censor board. In an opinion written by Justice Tom L. Beauchamp it was declared that “The name and character of the picture ex¬ hibited are immaterial, and the objection lodged against the picture by the Board of Censors is immaterial because it is not claimed that they abused discretion.” The court speculated that the U. S. Supreme Court may extend the 14th Amendment to films, and nationalize the industry, removing it from state and municipal control. “But, we are not ex¬ pecting this until it has done so,” the ruling continued, “and certainly will not yield the important function of behalf of the state and the municipality until we are forced to do so. We cannot concede that the motion picture industry has emerged from the business of amusement and be¬ come propagators of ideas entitling it to freedom of speech.” The Paramount is operated by East Texas Theatre Corporation, a subsidiary of Jefferson Amusement Company, affili¬ ated with the United Paramount Theatres. The case reached the Court of Appeals here on appeal from the Harrison County Court, to which Gelling first appealed his Marshall police court conviction, and which court upheld the police censorship. Under Texas law, this barred an appeal to the U. S. Supreme Court until an appeal was made to the Court of Criminal Appeals. The members heard a brief address by William Matless, editor, Sunday section. The Nashville Tennessean, in Hollywood several weeks gathering material for a special issue to be published coincident with the opening of Kermit Stengel’s Ten¬ nessee, Crescent Circuit theatre, set for Feb. 28 opening. The afternoon session featured the round table panel discussion with studio heads. Dore Schary, MGM, and Darryl Zanuck, 20th-Fox, spoke for production, and Fabian represented the exhibitors. Both production heads pointed out that Hollywood studios are now maintaining maximum output in regard to economic feasibility. Other studio spokesmen were Steve Broidy, Monogran; Harry Cohn, Columbia; Roy Disney; Gunther, William Perlberg, Y. Frank Freeman, Hal Wallis, William Goetz, Leonard Goldstein, Jack Warner, C. J. Tevlin, Jerry Wald, Robert Lippert, Sol Lesser, and Stanley Kramer. Dick Dickson led a discussion on film cycles; Walter Reade, Jr., on feature films on television; Martin, on film titles; Wolf- son, on TV trailers; Ray Willi, on new star talent; Elmer Rhoden, on scientific research; Morton Thalhimer, on regular trailers and advertising accessories; Ted Gamble, on seasonal product offerings, and Fred Schwartz, on star tours.

In Canada: RCA VICTOR ComDonv Limited, Montreal lAYiiXtt ir Theatre \"Character ' While watching a movie at a modest little neighborhood house we frequently visit, we got to wondering why we enjoy a picture there much more than at some of the more lavish metropolitan theatres. We concluded that the answer is \"character.\" Theatre character is a nebulous quality which produces an atmosphere of relaxation and cordiality, even when the lights have been dimmed and only the picture on the screen is in view. While good equipment and luxurious appointments help to create atmos¬ phere by providing physical comfort and screen entertainment of a high technical quality, it is the personal touch of the manager and staff, rather than the appearance of a theatre, that counts most in developing character, we think. At the particular neighborhood theatre we mentioned, patrons are welcomed with a smile at the boxoffice. The doorman greets them with a cordial \"good evening,\" and says \"thank you\" when he takes tickets. Ushers are neat, courteous, and considerate. And when the show is over, the manager often mingles with patrons in the lobby, and asks them what they thought of the program. These little personal touches, never overly effusive or patronizing, and apparently quite sincere, add considerably to the enjoyment of the picture because they produce the feeling of welcome— of \"being at home\"— that is so conducive to the maximum enjoyment of what is presented on the screen. The sum total of these brief, pleasant contacts with the staff, together with the attractive appearance of the theatre, add up to friendly character. In small communities where patrons and staff are neighbors, friendliness at the theatre comes naturally. But at big metropolitan houses, operations are often conducted on a coldly impersonal basis that characterizes the showplace as nothing more than just another commercial enterprise. Of course, the larger, more transient nature of metropolitan patronage does not permit the same degree of intimacy that can prevail at neighborhood houses, but where courtesy, cordiality, and consideration are the policy, regardless of the theatre's size or loca¬ tion, that's where the all-important thing called \"character\" accounts for big dividends.

The heart of such a sys¬ tem is, of course, efficient ticket issuing and collecting equipment — and, here, man¬ agement has delivered a hands down ultimatum — for 9 out of 10 such machines in use today are General Register Corporation’s AUTOMATICKET! Why this overwhelming pref¬ erence for the GRC product? Because, for 30 years, we have made it our business to know your business. Because, for 30 years, we’ve kept fully informed on every angle of the industry’s cash control problem through nationwide studies of theatre operation and needs. Because we con¬ sistently plow back 25% of our profits into a product de¬ velopment program designed expressly to meet the chal¬ lenge of changing conditions with machines that do the job fastei-, better, more economically. 43-01 Twenty-Second Street Long Island City 1, N.
