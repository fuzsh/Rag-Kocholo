French lingerie line Princesse Tam Tam has announced the brand's first collaboration with a designer, with an initial capsule collection set for release on February 3, 2015 according to the American press.

The collaborative collection, with Yaz Bukey, has been described as "playful, feminine, glamorous - and pop", by Mathilde Costello-Branco, creative director of the brand, and will be followed by some additional swimwear pieces in April.

Set to drop in time for Valentine's Day next year, the intimates collection -- titled "Just a Kiss" -- will feature a lip motif and will comprise two panties and one bra, both priced at 29 euros, and a sweater retailing at 69 euros.
