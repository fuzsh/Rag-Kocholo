        "text": "Hiya from England..\n\nI mostly just wanted to show off my 63 riv to you guys ,,,, but loosely hidden under the disguise of asking a few questions about it .\n\nthis 63 was bought new buy Conway and as far as I can find out was in his car collection until he died but was also his main run about .\n\nIt still has his Vanity plates ( TWITTY ) fitted behind its British plates .\n\nBit of a long shot but Does anyone out there have any info on the car .\n\nAnd maybe even a picture of the legend himself with the car , what would be to me the Holy Grail , I have heavily search the internet to no avail and messaged the Conway Twitty fan club but they couldn't help .\n\nIts featured in a motoring magazine and a book over this side of the pond but any other little tit bits of info would be greatly appreciated .\n\nthanks Paul H .\n\nhiya\n\nthanks for that Dwane Allen lead , I will follow up on that .\n\nforgive my lack of knowledge on the geography of your country , I have only been to Florida a few times and Canada , so there is a rather large bit between the two I haven't seen YET , so I might be saying something stupid here .\n\nthe vanity plate is for JAN WISCONSIN . maybe he kept more then one property . maybe had a ranch or something too .\n\ni'll do my home work later and familiarize myself with the 2 locations on google maps .\n\nthank for replying , appreciate it .\n\nGood day.\n\nNeedless to say, cool car, and to have it featured in a couple books significantly adds to the cool factor when it comes to bragging about our loved ones...\n\nIn terms of the provenance, that certainly can add value too, both monetarily, but also additional bragging rights. One can never have enough of the latter...\n\nThat said, outta curiosity, do you have any documentation that proves the car's lineage to Conway Twitty? The vanity plate without some form of registration document, for me, is thin proof at best, especially in this case, with it being a Wisconsin plate, when I understand he lived mainly in Tennessee and the southern states. Nice story, but the proof is in the papers.\n\nI did find what appears to be an ended eBay ad for the car in which the seller wrote...\n\n\"Ex Conway Twitty Buick Riviera, very clean low mileage (18K) and super straight. Car was imported from his collection and sold at Sotherbys (1989) then featured in Classic and Sports Car and Quentin Wilson's book Cool Cars. All history and original Twitty personal US plates come with the car.\"\n\nSource: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/152776185857?ssPageName=STRK:MESINDXX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1436.l2649\n\n---\n\nIt would be very interesting to know what 'history' was included in the sale, and if you have documentation to back up the bragging rights of provenance. I'm certain that if Sotherbys sold it as Conway Twitty's they would need more than the vanity plate as proof. Not that I really care, it's your car, it's your story, but I trust you see my point on provenance...)\n\nBy the way, I'm not sure what other tid-bits of information you were looking for but if you've not had your data plate de-coded, (it's the metal plate located on the driver's side of the firewall with a bunch of stamped letters, numbers etc, ) that's always a good place to start. It will tell you a lot about what came with the original car in terms of colour, trim, features, etc.. Won't prove it's Conway's car, but it's good data to know...?\n\nAnyway, welcome to first generation Riv ownership, [EDIT: that's REALLY all the bragging rights you need...?]...they are a very cool car, and yours appears to be no exception, well done.\n\nLater,\n\nMike Swick\n\nEdmonton, AB\n\n----\n\nEdited September 4, 2018 by MikeJS (see edit history)\n\nTne author of tbe article did some good research but he researched the wrong year. In the caption next to the picture of the engine tnere's reference to the \"dual four barrel 360 hp\" engine. Not in 1963.\n\nKind of like the Jay Leno's garage episode where he gets a hold of a 65 Riviera with the \"465 horsepower\" dual quad 425. ?\n\nOr like the old telephone game we used to play in elementary school. Everyone stands in a circle. You tell something to the person on your right, then everyone takes turns doing the same and then you listen to what the person on your left tells you after it's come back to you. Embellishment should be the name of the game.\n\nHiya ...\n\nthanks for the interest guys .\n\nBragging rights are great buy them self but even if the Riv was only ever owned by a Satanist who used it on Sunday mornings to squash kittens I wouldn't love it any less .\n\nI'm a 44 yr old English guy so I hadn't even heard of Conway until FAMILY GUY started using cut aways of him singing in their show , I liked his voice and bought some of his music ,\n\nthen a few years later I spotted the Riv on ebay ( that was the old listing MIKEJS spotted , ) and I would have been just as fast to slam the cash down if Conway hadn't owned it , its just a bonus .\n\nthe pics below are the original Bonhams catalogue , the page and right up of the Riv saying it was own by Conway and finally a copy of the Title with his name and address as Music village blvd , Hendersonville , TN .\n\nits not easy to read but the site wouldn't allow a bigger pic , too many bites of some waffle ...\n\nI have a thick folder of other bumf that came with the Riv , there is no official appraisal but the title and Bonhams writing it up as Conways is plenty for me , they will I'm sure have done their due diligence before handling it .\n\nI still don't know why it had a Wisconsin vanity plate on it , can any body out there put an answer to this please .\n\non a different note ..\n\ni'm in Florida in early February for 2 weeks , are there any shows on , bikes cars truck ect ect .\n\nThanks Paul .\n\nI spoke with Bill, who was Conway Twitty's bus driver for his band, Bill has driven bus for Conway well over 20 years, and knows all his collectible cars. I asked Bill if this was one of Conway's cars, and he said it wasn't, he does not remember ever seeing a black 63 Buick, and especially if it was his daily driver up until his death, because if you were a true Fan of Conway's, you would know that his favorite car was a Pacer, which he drove daily when he was at home and not on the road touring. Conway even used his Pacer in one of his music Video's! Here is a picture of Conway Twitty's 1980 Pacer, which was auctioned off at an Estate Sale after his death!\n\nEdited March 18, 2021 by Conway Twitty Fan Club! (see edit history)"
