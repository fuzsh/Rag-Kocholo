        "text": "“Ladies And Gentlemen. Mr. Conway Twitty!!! I love it when the TV Show “Family Guy” breaks away to a Conway Twitty video! He was called “The Best Friend A Song Ever Had”. The late, great Conway Twitty was the first Artist I met backstage at a concert in the early 80’s. He was very kind to a young radio guy just starting out. A very soft spoken, quiet man kinda like George Strait. Over the years I became a big fan of his music and I loved how he would put out cover versions of whatever big hit pop song was on the charts and release them as singles. He was a brilliant marketer of himself. This picture was taken backstage in the O’Connell Center in Gainesville in 1990. Little did I know that 3 years later June 5th, 1993 he would be gone. Saturday June 6th, 1993 I was driving to do a Saturday shift at WQIK in Jacksonville, Florida and had my radio on and a newsflash came on that Conway Twitty had passed away after a show in Branson, Missouri. My heart sank and I nearly drove off the road. I was in total shock. I started crying like a baby. I had never been effected by a singer passing before. I got to the radio station and my Program Director told to talk about it and play “I May Never Get To Heaven” by Conway and I lost it again. Needless to say. He made a big impression on my life."
