Also buried at the Presley family's estate in Tennessee are Elvis' parents Vernon and Gladys Presley, Elvis' grandmother Minnie Mae and Elvis' twin brother Jessie Presley, who died at birth.\n\nUp until her death, Lisa Marie was the sole owner of Graceland. Back in 2013, she shared her experience living at Graceland as a child. \"I knew that nobody was going to tell me what to do because they would get fired. I was truly a terror, to be honest,\" she quipped on The Talk.\n\nLisa Marie Presley died Thursday (January 12) after suffering a full cardiac arrest. She was pronounced dead at a hospital in Los Angeles days before what would have been her 55th birthday.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart that I must share the devastating news that my beautiful daughter Lisa Marie has left us. She was the most passionate strong and loving woman I have ever known. We ask for privacy as we try to deal with this profound loss. Thank you for the love and prayers. At this time there will be no further comment,\" Priscilla Presley said in a statement to E! News.\n\nThe news of Presley's death comes hours after she was hospitalized after suffering a \"full\" cardiac arrest on Thursday. She was in the ICU in an induced coma and in critical condition leading up to her death.\n\nStars including John Travolta and Tom Hanks have shared their condolences for the late songwriter.
