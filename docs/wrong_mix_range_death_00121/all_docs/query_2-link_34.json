DATE: SUNDAY, June 6, 1993 TAG: 9306060076 SECTION: NATIONAL/INTERNATIONAL PAGE: A-1 EDITION: METRO SOURCE: Associated Press DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, MO. LENGTH: Medium\n\nSINGER CONWAY TWITTY DIES\n\nConway Twitty, who started as a teen rock idol in the 1950s and crossed over to country to become a star, died Saturday at age 59.\n\nHis wife, Dee Henry, was with him at Cox Medical Center-South when he died of complications from surgery after a blood vessel ruptured in his stomach.\n\nTwitty collapsed on his tour bus during a rest stop in southwest Missouri. He was on the way home to Hendersonville, Tenn., from a performance Friday night in Branson.\n\n\"I've just been sitting here crying,\" said Sandy Brokaw, Twitty's press representative. \"I was in awe of the man.\"\n\nTwitty was born Sept. 1, 1933, as Harold Lloyd Jenkins, named after the silent movie star. He changed his name in 1957 by borrowing from Conway, Ark., and Twitty, Texas.\n\nHis career took off with the name change. His first hit was \"It's Only Make Believe,\" which soared to No. 1 on the pop charts in 1958.\n\nHe recorded more than 40 No. 1 hits, including \"Hello Darlin',\" \"Tight-Fittin' Jeans\" and \"Linda On My Mind.\"\n\nMel Tillis, who said Twitty and his wife were at Tillis' Branson theater Thursday night, called Twitty a great singer.\n\n\"He didn't do a lot of talking on stage, he said he let his music do his talking,\" Tillis said. \"He was a song's best friend, because he could really sing.\"\n\nTwitty and Loretta Lynn won the Country Music Association's Vocal Duo of the Year award in 1972, 1973, 1974, and 1975. They won a Grammy for their 1971 duet, \"After The Fire Is Gone.\"\n\n\"I've not only lost a great singing partner but also a great friend,\" Lynn said.\n\nby CNB"
