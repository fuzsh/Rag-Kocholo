        "text": "Ronnie Milsap is among the most influential and popular country music performers of the 1970s and 1980s. His smooth vocals and signature blend of country with elements of pop, R&B, and rock and roll resulted in phenomenal crossover success and 35 No. 1 country hits – the third highest of all time, topped only by George Strait and Conway Twitty.\n\nBlind since birth, Ronnie’s formative years were spent with his grandparents deep in the Great Smoky Mountains. At five, he was sent to Raleigh to attend the Governor Moorhead School for the Blind. There, he discovered a profound love of music and for the next 12 years he studied classical music and learned to play a number of instruments, including violin, guitar, and his favorite, the piano. Encouraged by singer and pianist Ray Charles, Milsap turned down a full scholarship to study pre-law at Emory University for a career in music.\n\nI went to a Ray Charles concert. His pilot got me back into Ray’s dressing room. And Ray Charles, he said, “Well, play me something.” So I played him a couple of songs I was working on – songs that I was trying to write or songs that I’d been living with that I’d picked up from somewhere. And Ray said, “It sounds like your heart is really into music. And if your heart is that much into music, that’s what you should do.”\n\nBitten by the Motown bug, Milsap signed with New York City-based Scepter Records. His debut single, “Never Had It So Good,” reached No. 19 on Billboard’s R&B chart. Ronnie had enjoyed country music as a child and when he discovered Merle Haggard, he fell in love with it again. Fittingly, he performed Hag’s “Today I Started Loving You Again” at the Los Angeles nightclub Whiskey A-Go-Go. Charley Pride was in attendance and encouraged Milsap to move to Nashville and record country music. In 1972, he did just that, working with Pride’s manager; within a year he had signed with Jerry Bradley at RCA Victor and released his first country single – a Top 10 chart hit. After a successful tour as Pride’s opening act, Milsap began a long string of country No. 1s, including the Kris Kristofferson composition “Please Don’t Tell Me How the Story Ends” which earned Milsap his first GRAMMY award (Best Male Country Vocal Performance, 1974) and contributed to his CMA nod as Male Vocalist of the Year for 1974.\n\nFrom 1976 through 1978, Milsap was the dominant male performer on the country music charts. He scored seven back-to-back No. 1 singles, including the megahit “It Was Almost Like a Song.” Showcasing Ronnie’s soaring multi-octave voice, the song crossed over to No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 7 on the Adult Contemporary chart. His biggest successes came in the 1980s, however, including his highest crossover success, “(There’s) No Gettin’ Over Me” (1981), which hit the top of the country charts and went to No. 2 on Adult Contemporary and No. 5 on the Hot 100.\n\nRonnie Milsap would achieve 16 additional country No. 1s before the ‘80s had ended. Today, he is credited with six GRAMMY awards and eight CMAs, including four turns as Male Vocalist of the Year. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nBorn: January 16, 1943, Robbinsville, North Carolina"
