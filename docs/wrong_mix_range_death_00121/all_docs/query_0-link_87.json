        "text": "A few words about this discography...\n\nI have the tremendous good fortune to make my living as a studio musician and have done so since 1968, but until now had never compiled a list of the records I'd worked on. It seemed like a tall order as I'm not aware of access to musician's union session contracts online, and that's really where the complete information lies. So, I began with the All Music Guide web site and was honestly amazed by what came up. They do a very good job, so many things I'd forgotten and was surprised to see again, although a few corrections and much additional work needed to be done. For starters, another Richard Bennett, a wonderful guitar player primarily in the acoustic and bluegrass music field who's work had been credited along with mine, as well as entries for Richard Rodney Bennett have now been deleted from this web site's discography.\n\nThere were omissions that immediately came to mind, primarily my early work in Los Angeles of the late 60's through the 1970's, records that were no longer in print. By going through my own record collection I managed to fill several legal sheets with more albums I'd participated on. This by no means told the whole story though, as I'd been very cavalier about getting copies of so many of the records I'd played on. A typical musician.\n\nThe next stop was my file cabinet where I began pouring through date books going back to 1971. These too gave only a partial view as I seldom wrote the name of the artist with the booking. In those days I simply noted the appropriate date, time, studio and whoever had put the call out ie. the producer, arranger and/or contractor. Randomly however, I did enter about a third of the artists next to the session call. From those date books I compiled several more pages of artists who had been left out. I have included their names and the first year I'd recorded with them although no album title follows the date; sadly, I don't have these records in my collection. Like I said, typical.\n\nThis is far from a comprehensive discography, still it does offer a good look at a large picture and I have to admit being a little overwhelmed myself by the breadth and scope of it. You'll recognize artists who were and continue to be legends, some who have faded from collective memory and many who never made it that far. It is my honor and privilege to have worked with every one of them."
