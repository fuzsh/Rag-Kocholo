        "text": "Conway Twitty (born Harold Lloyd Jenkins; September 1, 1933 – June 5, 1993) was an American country music singer. Originally a '50s rock & roll singer, Conway Twitty became the reigning country superstar of the '70s and '80s, racking up a record 40 US number one hits over the course of two decades. With his deep, resonant down-home voice, Twitty was one of the smoothest balladeers to work in Nashville during the country-pop era, but he was also one of the most adventurous. More than any other singer, he was responsible for selling country as an \"adult\" music, slipping sexually suggestive lyrics into his lush productions, yet never singing misogynist lyrics.\n\n[]\n\nPeel was a fan of Conway's early records, which he mentioned on his 05 June 1993 (BFBS) show (coincidentally the day Conway died, although the show was pre-recorded on the date) and suggested to Josh, his friend, who was going to America, to visit Twitty City, a country music entertainment complex created by the singer.\n\nIn 1999, Peel nominated Conway Twitty's 'It's Only Make Believe' as his Peelenium 1958.\n\nPeel's last show for BBC Radio One in 2004 featured a Pig's Big 78 of the singer's It's Only Make Believe track, which Sheila, his wife, recalled singing with Peel in his last programme, that was mentioned on Margrave Of The Marshes (Bantam Press, hardback edition, p.389-90).\n\nPeelenium[]\n\nPeelenium 1958: It's Only Make Believe\n\nShows Played[]\n\n1978\n\n02 November 1978: Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On (LP – The Rock & Roll Story) Contour\n\n1984\n\n25 July 1984: It's Only Make Believe (7\") Old Gold\n\n02 August 1984: The Story Of My Love\n\n06 August 1984: Whole Lot Of Shakin' Going On\n\n08 August 1984: Heavenly (album - It's Only Make Believe) Metro MS-512\n\n12 December 1984: Danny Boy\n\n1986\n\n03 February 1986: The Story Of My Love (LP - Conway Twitty Sings) MGM\n\n1987\n\n22 July 1987: It's Only Make Believe (JP: 'Woah I had a sing a long with that, cleared the tubes in no uncertain matter, that's Conway Twitty, It's Only Make Believe, used to be called I think Harold Jenkins which is his real name, why he changed it to Conway Twitty, perhaps it was quite a good career move you know, cause there'a a place now called something like Twitty City that he owns and I don't know what they do there but quite alot I expect.')\n\n15 December 1987: The Story Of My Love\n\n1989\n\n09 August 1989: Danny Boy\n\n10 August 1989: Heavenly\n\n1991\n\n13 October 1991: 'The Story Of My Love (LP-It's Only Make Believe)' (Metro)\n\n1993\n\n06 March 1993: The Story Of My Love\n\n05 June 1993 (BFBS): The Story Of Our Love\n\n1997\n\n12 November 1997: The Pick-Up (LP - Rockin Conway - The MGM Years) Mercury\n\n05 November 1997: Lonely Blue Boy (album - Rockin' Conway: The MGM Years) Mercury\n\n1999\n\n11 August 1999: 'The Pickup (7\")' (MGM) (JP: 'Contains the immortal line \"Come on mouth and talk that talk.\"')\n\n15 August 1999 (BFBS): The Pickup\n\n06 October 1999: 'It's Only Make Believe' Peelenium 1958\n\n2000\n\n19 July 2000: The Pickup (7”) MGM\n\n2001\n\n22 February 2001 (Radio Eins): Mona Lisa\n\n2003\n\n06 May 2003: 'Mona Lisa (LP- It's Only Make Believe)' (MGM Records)\n\n2004\n\n14 October 2004: It's Only Make Believe (MGM) Pig's Big 78\n\nSee Also[]\n\nSingles Reviews\n\nUK Singles Chart Number Ones\n\nPeel's 77 All Time Favourite Records List\n\nDisc & Music Echo: Peel Columns\n\nSounds\n\n[]"
