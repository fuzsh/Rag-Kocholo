        "text": "Give us this day, June 5, our daily Elvis\n\n1851\n\nIn the weekly anti-slave journal The National Era, Harriet Beecher Stow published the first installment of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” Originally she used the subtitle “The Man That Was A Thing,” but soon changed it to “Life Among the Lowly.”\n\n1856\n\n“Onward Christian Soldiers” was presented for the first time.\n\nTupelo, Mississippi\n\n1935-1948\n\n1935-1940\n\n306 Old Satillo Road, Elvis’ birthplace, is now 306 Elvis Presley Drive.\n\n, 1938\n\nVernon Presley in prison ( May 25 1938 to February 6 1939)\n\n,1939\n\n1940-41\n\nReese Street, where the Presleys stayed with Vester and Clettes Presley and their daughter Patsy,\n\n1942\n\nSammy Kaye and his orchestra recorded “I Left My Heart at the Stage Door Canteen.”\n\nKelly Street, a rented, small apartment.\n\n1943\n\nThe Presley family moved to the Mississippi Gulf Coast, May 15 to June 20, Returning to Tupelo.\n\n1944\n\nAugust 8, 1945 to July 18, 1946\n\nBerry Street -“Doll” Smith lived here with the Presleys and then Minnie Mae Presley moved in.\n\n1946\n\nCommerce Street, a rental\n\n510 1/2 Maple Street, South Tupelo -the Presleys lived with Glady’s cousin Frank Richards and his wife, Leona.\n\n1947\n\nMulbery Alley\n\nMemphis, Tennessee\n\n1948-1953 – Humes High School\n\nSept. 12, 1948-Sept. 20, 1949\n\n572 Poplar Avenue\n\nSept 20 1949 to January 7, 1950\n\n185 Winchester Street, a two- bedroom apartment (number 328)\n\nJanuary 7, 1950 to April 1953\n\n398 Cypress Street\n\nJune 3, 1951 to July 1, 1951\n\nElvis was employed as a machinist by “Precision Tool Co.”\n\nJune 5, 1952\n\nBillboard magazine reported that, as of July, major record labels would supply radio stations with 45-RPM singles rather than 78-RPM singles.\n\nApril 17, 1952 to May 28, 1952\n\nElvis worked as an user at Loew’s State Theatre\n\n1953\n\n398 Cypress Street (rented from January 7 to April 1953\n\n, 1954\n\nElvis worked at Crown Electric, until mid-October 1954\n\nThe Presleys lived at 2414 Lamar Avenue, rented til the end of 1954 to mid-1955\n\nThe Sun Records Rockabilly Era\n\nJune 5, 1954\n\nElvis cut two sides (master 0914-A and 0914-B) on Saturday, 6/5, and picked up his acetate dub on Wednesday, 6/9. This documentation is likely for a song like, perhaps, Casual Love Affair. The flipside is likely another slow country ballad with just Elvis on guitar, i.e. not Without You since Elvis paid for the acetate.
