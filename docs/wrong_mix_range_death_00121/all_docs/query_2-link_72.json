        "text": "Conway Twitty was an artist who successfully spanned the rock ânâ roll, pop and country genres in a career that lasted over three decades, and was best-known for his landmark US and UK No. 1 âItâs Only Make Believeâ. This great-value 62-track 2-CD set comprises the A & B sides of his singles for Mercury and MGM during this formative era in his career, during which he not only had his iconic No. 1 with the brooding and dramatic âItâs Only Make Believeâ, but had thirteen other chart entries, including the US No. 6 âLonely Blue Boyâ and the UK No. 5 âMona Lisaâ, before forging a niche as a leading force in the country market.\n\nIt also includes selected tracks from his albums released during these years, âConway Twitty Singsâ, âSaturday Night with Conway Twittyâ, âLonely Blue Boyâ, âThe Rock & Roll Storyâ, âThe Conway Twitty Touchâ, and âPortrait Of A Foolâ. It is a substantial overview of his output during this period, showcasing not only his fine voice, but his versatility in performing material from out-and-out rock ânâ roll to ballads and country-flavoured songs with equal panache.\n\nREVIEWS\n\nâThis 62-song set covers all the bases and every hit until 1962â¦ Compiler and booklet writer Paul Watts, despite to doing a great job, loses one star from five when he failed to include my personal fave, I Vibrate.â **** - John Howard (Vintage Rock Issue 41)\n\nâCrammed with Conway classicsâ¦ a celebration of Twitty âThe Rockerâ â and he was one of the best.â â Trevor Cajiao (Now Dig This Issue 433)"
