        "text": "“I’m often asked what it’s like to be Conway Twitty’s son.”\n\n—Michael Twitty\n\nTweet\n\nPin It\n\nToday’s story is from Michael Twitty.\n\nCountry music icon. Thousands of performances. Millions of fans. Folks look at me with pity or awe. Awe, because I’m a Twitty, after all. Pity, because everyone knows famous musicians don’t have much time for their kids. It’s true.\n\nMeetings. Practices. Recording. Interviews. Touring. Dad was constantly on the road. I didn’t see him a lot growing up. It’s what he was. It’s what he was born to be.\n\nBut don’t feel sorry for me. Growing up, I had three dads — not one. Papaw (Dalton Floyd Jenkins), my granddad, he was a steamboat captain on the mighty Mississippi. My uncle Howard was also there for me. And Conway, my natural dad.\n\nWhen Dad was on tour, he would call every day. But he arranged more than a chat on the line. When Dad was away, I had Uncle Howard and Papaw for play.\n\nAll three dads were southern gentlemen through and through. And from my three dads I learned to be one too. To ladies, I tip my hat. I open doors. ‘Yes ma’am’ and ‘no sir’ to strangers and elders.\n\nMy three dads all loved their kids, to fish, to hunt, and of course, the guitar. They knew the power of a man’s word. ‘I’ll always be here — even when I’m not.’ That’s what my father said. Conway Twitty was a man of his word.\n\nBecause of my three dads, I’ve never been totally alone. But one went away, way too soon. Dad died in ‘93, unexpectedly. ‘He left me’, I thought — but he didn’t, I’ve learned. I feel his presence every day. Through his music. But it’s more."
