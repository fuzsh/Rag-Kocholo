        "text": "Conway Twitty’s Iconic Former Mansion Saved From Demolition: ‘The Right Thing to Do’\n\nAn iconic Nashville-area home that once belonged to country music legend Conway Twitty has been spared from demolition after its current owners reconsidered their plans due to an outcry from the public.\n\nTwitty's estate in the affluent Nashville suburb of Hendersonville, Tenn., also served as the site for his popular Twitty City tourist attraction, which closed after Trinity Broadcasting Network purchased the property after Twitty's death in 1993. They converted it into an entertainment complex, and the property has most recently served as the site where Mike Huckabee films his Huckabee show.\n\nWhy Was Conway Twitty's Home Going to Get Knocked Down?\n\nA tornado struck the area in December of 2023 and affected the structural integrity of the former Twitty mansion. Frank Amedia, who represents TBN's real estate division, subsequently introduced a plan to the Hendersonville Planning Commission to knock down every structure on the property with the exception of the Huckabee Theater to make way for a planned expansion of the studio, as well as senior living facilities. The plan drew intense media scrutiny.\n\nAn initial vote from the Board of Mayor and Aldermen went against TBN, and as WKRN in Nashville reports, TBN has now changed its plans after hearing from the public and following Amedia meeting with Twitty's daughter, Joni Ryles, who previously spoke out against the demolition.\n\nWhat's Going to Happen to Conway Twitty's House Now?\n\nTBN rolled out a new plan on Tuesday (Jan. 23) to reduce the number of assisted living units so the Twitty home can be saved.\n\nThe BOMA unanimously passed the first reading of the plan on Tuesday.\n\nThe BOMA will vote on a second reading of the new plan on Feb. 27.\n\n“We heard the sentiment of the city very well, we prayed about it, we met with some people …and we just felt that this was the right thing to do,” Amedia states. “It’s going to cost us more money, but that wasn’t the issue.”\n\nGet our free mobile app\n\nTBN has not yet announced the specifics of saving the Twitty Mansion, but Amedia previously said he'd like to use the facility to honor the legacy of the country icon.\n\nPICTURES: See Inside Alan Jackson's Spectacular Hilltop Estate\n\nAfter selling their spectacular Southern manor home in 2010, Alan Jackson and his wife moved to to what might be an even more impressive mansion, if that's even possible.
