        "text": "Thousand Oaks man presents legend's life in musical\n\nBy Kitty Dill\n\nThe life of performer Conway Twitty, who in 35 years notched hits as a rock 'n' roll teen idol and a country music legend, is about to come alive in a musical written by a Ventura County man.\n\n\"It's Only Make Believe: The Man, the Music, the Legend\" about Twitty is being created and directed by playwright and choreographer Randy Johnson, a longtime area resident who lived in Westlake Village and Moorpark and now calls Thousand Oaks home.\n\nAmong Johnson's substantial credits are helping direct \"Elvis: the Concert,\" a remembrance show blending footage of Elvis with live music and sanctioned by the Presley family, which just wrapped up a 10-year run around the world.\n\nJohnson was original producer of \"Always Patsy Cline\" and several years ago directed and co-wrote \"The Wildest\" revue of music by Louis Prima and Keely Smith.\n\n\"It's Only Make Believe\" will highlight Twitty's beginnings in rock 'n' roll and his self-induced transition into country music, chalking up 55 No. 1 hits, such as \"It's Only Make Believe\" and \"Hello Darlin',\" said Johnson.\n\nNearly 40 of his songs will be featured, Johnson said one recent Saturday in North Hollywood, at Screenland Studios, where he was auditioning vocalists for the show.\n\n\"What is so fascinating about this man is not only his music but the love for his family and friends,\" said Johnson. \"We will be going beyond his being a legendary entertainer to show how he interacted with his children. I want the audience to walk away knowing how important family was in his life.\"\n\nA fateful day\n\nThe creator doesn't have to guess how the family fits in since it was Twitty's children who first contacted him last year about making the musical.\n\nJohnson said he doesn't believe it was a coincidence that initial communication happened on the 30th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death, while Johnson was backstage at Memphis' Fed Ex Forum getting ready for the final Elvis concert.\n\nChecking e-mail, Johnson found a message from the family asking if he would be interested in telling their father's story in a musical.\n\n\"While I was reading this e-mail, the radio was playing a Conway Twitty song,\" recalled Johnson. \"I thought, Elvis, are you handing me Conway Twitty?' One great journey with Elvis was ending, but another with Conway was beginning.\"\n\nA month later, Johnson spent two days \"talking and eating 7,000 calories\" getting to know Twitty's four children, Joni Riels, Kathy Twitty and Jimmy and Michael Jenkins. (Twitty was born Harold Jenkins.)\n\nThen, fortified by the family's stories, Johnson spent two months reeling in everything he could absorb about Twitty, in print and otherwise.\n\nWhile studying, Johnson reconnected with an early memory of being with an aunt and driving by Twitty City in the '80s. Twitty City was the singer's home in Hendersonville, Tenn., until his death in 1993.\n\n\"Otherwise, I really didn't know his music,\" Johnson said. \"But I'm sure a fan now. What he accomplished was nothing short of amazing.\n\n\"I could almost sense his presence when I was writing the musical, which is a loving scrapbook of memories,\" Johnson said.\n\nTwitty died at 59 of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Six years later, in 1999, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nParade of hopefuls\n\nThe California auditions for Johnson's show were the first scheduled in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Nashville. Running from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., the Southland tryouts featured a parade of hopefuls â€” on Fridays those sent by agents, on Saturdays open-call candidates.\n\nTaking notes were Twitty's former wife of 30 years, Mickey Jenkins Twitty, and daughters Joni Riels and Kathy Twitty.\n\nDuring a break, they talked about the project and said it was long envisioned but only recently began falling into place.\n\nRiels said that sifting through family archives revived memories, with footage showing her and Kathy warbling as youngsters and their father saying, \"They're singing like little birds.\"\n\n\"What many don't know is what a loving, ethical man he was. He was much more than a famous entertainer,\" said Kathy. She recalled Twitty City, an 11-acre tourist attraction just north of Nashville, where Twitty built a country music entertainment complex. That long ago shut it doors and is now occupied by Trinity Broadcasting Network.\n\n\"We all lived in houses at Twitty City, and it was a much friendlier, safer time,\" Kathy said. \"Tourists would come right up to our front door. And if our father was in his office working and saw the tourists, he would wave.\"\n\n\"He left dreams unfilled,\" Mickey said. With the musical, she said, \"we're continuing them.\"\n\nTiming\n\nWhy a musical now?\n\nFamily members concur enough time had passed since his death to be respectful and allow healing to take place.\n\n\"It was many years after Patsy died before we did Always Patsy Cline,'\" Johnson said. \"And it was 20 years after Elvis passed before we did the concert. Now, in 2008, this would be Conway's 75th birthday. And it's the 50th anniversary of It's Only Make Believe,' a monster hit.\n\n\"It's all about timing\" from Johnson's perspective. \"I didn't want to do a simple tribute show because that would short-shrift his life. I felt the play was about telling the truth, about the man who was a family man with an extraordinary tapestry of a career in rock, pop, country and as an actor.\"\n\nKathy reminisced that her dad, who stood on a chair to sing at age 4 and went on to have his own radio show at 12, \"always followed his instincts about what to do when. He had the faith.\"\n\nCommented Joni: \"He was warned not to leave rock 'n' roll. But he walked away from a very successful career, and he went from making thousands a night to $300 a night\" in order to heed a clarion call to break into country music.\n\nNext in Line'\n\nTwitty stepped into country music in 1965, then found country DJs wouldn't play music from a rock star, said the family. That embargo cracked in 1968 with \"Next in Line.\"\n\nDown the line came duets with Loretta Lynn, netting Country Music Association awards.\n\nTwitty also wrote some of his top hits and \"since his death, he's sold 20 million records,\" according to Kathy.\n\nThe music legend even lives on via Conrad Birdie, the rock star with a pompadour immortalized in the classic musical \"Bye Bye Birdie.\"\n\nTwitty's other two children, Jimmy and Michael Jenkins, weren't at the Los Angeles auditions, but, said Johnson, they were involved in the entire process.\n\nIn what Johnson called the first-ever auditions on YouTube, he considered auditions posted online for those who couldn't make it in person to the national auditions.\n\nThe rehearsal schedule and auditions times for musicians are being plotted, and applications being accepted for behind-the-scenes crew.\n\nJohnson expects the \"It's Only Make Believe\" nationwide tour to start in the fall, playing performing arts centers, state fairs and theaters.\n\nHe and the family hope the biography musical will be popular enough to land on Broadway.\n\n\"It's Only Make Believe\" is being produced by Conway Twitty United with family members. Scott Welch Management is executive producer."
