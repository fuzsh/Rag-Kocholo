        "text": "Each night before he steps into the title role of \"Conway Twitty: The Man, The Music, The Legend, The Musical,\" Glen Templeton says he has a special conversation in the theater's wings.\"When I'm standing backstage before I go on, me and Conway, we do some serious talking,\" Templeton said. \"I just let him and the good Lord take control.\"Templeton spoke Feb. 21 in a dressing room at the Topeka Performing Arts Center before he and the rest of the cast presented a preview of the Twitty musical as the opening act at a George Jones concert.The full production of \"Conway Twitty: The Man, The Music, The Legend, The Musical\" returns for a 7:30 p.m. Saturday performance at TPAC.The audience that night gave the preview a standing ovation, and many of those who bought tickets to see George Jones took the opportunity to buy tickets to see the story of another of Nashville's legends.Twitty died suddenly June 5, 1993, of a stomach aneurysm. Twitty's four children after a years-long battle over his estate won the rights to his name, image and music, and they commissioned the musical.\"We wanted to find a way to keep our father's legacy going into the next generation,\" Joni Twitty said Tuesday by telephone from Nashville.She said she remembered seeing \"Always ... Patsy Cline,\" and contacted its creator, Randy Johnson, to see whether he was interested in doing a jukebox musical about her father.He agreed to do it, and Joni Twitty, her sister and two brothers worked with Johnson on the script, which tells the singer's story from their perspective with actresses portraying the two Twitty daughters, another playing Twitty's duet partner, Loretta Lynn, and, of course, an actor as Twitty himself.Also on the stage is a full country band to accompany all of the singing.\"The reason we wanted to be so involved with the creation was to tell the truth,\" Joni Twitty said. \"It's a heart-warming story that people have never heard. It's not just your bio-type facts.\"With the concept of the show set, the next task, Joni Twitty said, was casting, which Johnson and the family did with auditions in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Nashville.It was at the Nashville tryouts they found Templeton, who grew up in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and was working in Nashville as a singer.\"When Glen Templeton sang, the search was over,\" Joni Twitty said. \"It was eerie how much he sounded like Dad. It just took our breath away.\"However, Templeton, who has blond hair cut in a long style, doesn't naturally resemble Twitty, whose dark hair was swept back.\"Well, he don't look anything like Dad, but he sure sounds like him, so we can fix that,\" Joni Twitty recalled. \"With a Hollywood wig, we were able to transform him into an essence of Dad, and that's what it's all about.\"The family also worked with Templeton on capturing Twitty's style. He had never acted before and said it was a challenge to set his own personality aside.\"I have to become this totally different character,\" he said \"All these years I've spent developing who Glen Templeton is as an artist, then it really doesn't get taken away, but I have to set that aside and become somebody else on stage. It takes practice. It takes a lot of practice.\"Templeton also said he had to learn to control his own stage movements and adopt Twitty's more static ones.\"He just stood up there and sang from his heart and soul, and that's how he held them in the palm of his hand,\" Joni Twitty said of her father. \"There's not that many people who can do that, that can yank you all over the place with just their voice.\"The transformation works, with Twitty's former band members and fellow entertainers moved to tears by the show. The musical was pegged as an opening act for George Jones because his wife, Nancy, loved the show, Joni Twitty said.Templeton said he considers it an honor and privilege to portray Twitty.\"There's a certain power when you're standing there because there's only one other person who's stood in those shoes and got that kind of response, and that's him,\" Templeton said.When the show is over, Templeton said of Twitty, \"I leave him there, and I walk away from it. I've been released.As for Joni Twitty, her mother and siblings, they try to see the show as often as possible.\"It's kind of like magic,\" she said. \"We feel we get to have Daddy back for a couple of hours each night we get to see the musical. It just makes us feel close to him.\"Bill Blankenship can be reached at (785) 295-1284 or bill.blankenship@cjonline.com"
