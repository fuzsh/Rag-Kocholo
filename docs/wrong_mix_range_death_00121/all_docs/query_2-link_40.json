        "text": "Conway Twitty began his performing career in Helena during World War II, while still a child. From these early days, he would eventually sell more than 50 million albums and become one of the most popular stars of country music.\n\nHe was born Harold Lloyd Jenkins in 1933 in Friars Point, Miss. His father worked as a ferryboat captain and in the early '40s, his family moved across the Mississippi River to nearby Helena. As a youngster, he began learning to play the guitar, guided by his grandfather and a local blues musician. At the age of 10 he formed his first band, the Phillips County Ramblers, and soon he was performing on local radio.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies, impressed with his baseball skills, reportedly scouted him and nearly signed him to the team. However, the Korean War intervened and he was drafted into the Army instead. Shortly after his tour of duty, he returned to his passion for music.\n\nHe worked as a songwriter and performer before finding any success. Deciding on a new angle for his career, he adopted the stage name â€“ \"Conway Twitty.\" Supposedly he combined the names of Conway, Ark., and Twitty, Texas, to come up with the name. In 1958, he scored his first hit on the early rock and roll charts with \"It's Only Make Believe,\" and even appeared in a handful of low-budget movies.\n\nBy the early '60s, he wanted to change directions artistically. However, Twitty found it difficult to move into country music until Ray Price made one of the songs he wrote into a top 10 hit. Not long afterward, Twitty began releasing his first albums. His first single to top the country charts was \"Next in Line\" in 1968.\n\nIn 1970, Twitty released \"Hello Darlin',\" the title track of what would become one of his most popular albums. The song topped the country music charts for four weeks, beginning his most successful decade as a musician.\n\nHe soon teamed up with Loretta Lynn to produce one of the most successful duos of the '70s. The two won a Grammy Award for \"After the Fire is Gone\" in 1971. The Country Music Association awarded them the Top Vocal Duo of the Year Award four times straight between 1972-75. The two also sang such hits as \"Louisiana Woman,\" \"Mississippi Man,\" \"Feelins',\" and \"I Can't Love You Enough.\"\n\nTwitty was known for many love songs, but the suggestive themes in \"You've Never Been This Far Before\" caused some radio stations to balk and refuse to play it. Nevertheless, it too became part of a long string of number one hit singles. He followed up with such hits as \"Linda on My Mind,\" \"I May Never Get to Heaven,\" \"Slow Hand,\" \"Desperado Love\" and \"Crazy in Love.\"\n\nTwitty continued to play to sold out crowds, write songs and make albums into the '90s. Tragically, in June 1993 while performing a series of shows in Branson, Mo., he died at the age of 59. His final album, \"Final Touches,\" was released two months later. In 1999, six years after his death, the Country Music Hall of Fame inducted him."
