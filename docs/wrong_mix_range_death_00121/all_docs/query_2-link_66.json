        "text": "When one mentions the name of Conway Twitty, you usually think of the Conway with all the great #1 country hits, or the killer duets with such partners as Loretta Lynn or Tammy Wynette.\n\nBut it’s not this Conway that I’m talking about but the early rockin’ Conway. The artist that spent years touring our local Midwest ballrooms. The artist that had some of the most killer rock single releases from the late 50’s and early 60’s. The Conway Twitty with the hard rockin’ road band, the Conway Twitty that gave us teens some of our most memorable shows at the Hollyhock Ballroom.\n\nIf you were to create a list of the classic Iowa and Minnesota ballrooms such as the Vel Air-Des Moines, Roof Garden-Okoboji, Matter’s-Decorah, Danceland-Cedar Rapids, The Col-Davenport, Melody Mill-Dubuque, the Kato in Mankato, the Prom in Minneapolis, the Showboat in Lake Benton and our Hollyhock Ballroom, Conway Twitty held most of the house attendance records from this period at these legendry ballrooms.\n\nBorn Harold Jenkins in 1933 in rural Mississippi and raised in the capitol of the blues, Helena, Ark., he was interested in music from an early age. He was only 10 when he joined his first group, the Phillips County Ramblers.\n\nAfter leaving the military in 1956 he decided to pursue a musical career full time after hearing another young budding rock and roll singer by the name of Elvis Presley.\n\nAfter hearing Presley, off to Memphis he went and was signed by Sam Phillips to his Sun Records label. Unfortunately, none of his recorded work ever was released on Sun, but he was on his way in music.\n\nIn late 1956, he joined a rock and roll touring show and decided he needed a better name than Harold Jenkins. From the communities of Conway, Ark., and Twitty, Texas, the new name of Conway Twitty was born.\n\nIn early 1957, he signed with Mercury Records based upon the “buzz” he was getting on the rockabilly circuit. Throughout all of 1957, Conway released singles on Mercury with little if any impact on the charts. In 1958, he left Mercury Records and was signed to MGM Records. Things were about to change!\n\nIn July of 1958 MGM released the incredible “It’s Only Make Believe/I’ll Try” (MGM Records #12677). With the release of this song, Twitty was on his way to recording stardom. He followed this up with such other killer releases as: “Double Talk Baby/Why Can’t I Get Through To You” (MGM 71384), “Hey Little Lucy/When I’m Not With You” (MGM #12785), “Mona Lisa/Heavenly” (MGM #12804), “Lonely Blue Boy/Star Spangled Heaven” (MGM #12857), and “Is A Blue Bird Blue/She’s Mine” (MGM #12911).\n\nEach of these releases featured the ultra smooth, low-toned delivery of Conway. While they rocked, they all had an “edge” of romance tied to them.\n\nBecause of these hits and his smoldering good looks, Conway was quickly recruited to do movies. He appeared in such teen-based releases as “Platinum High School,” “College Confidential,” and “Sex Kittens Go To College.” Just think, after seeing him in such flicks as these, we couldn’t get to the ballroom fast enough to see him in person and get an autograph.\n\nHis experienced backing band was now called the Blue Boys named after this MGM release “Lonely Blue Boy.”\n\nIt went almost without saying, release a record, let it enter the charts, and hit the Midwest tour circuit hard. Because of this successful formula, Twitty was a MAJOR draw at the Midwest ballrooms.\n\nAs fickle as the music business was, rock and roll was even more fickle. By 1961, the records were not hitting the charts like they had just years before so MGM dropped him from the label. In 1961, ABC Records quickly picked him up, matched him to record producers in Nashville, and his country and rock career went to heights that one could never have thought of. How about 40 #1 country chart hits!\n\nI had the chance to work for the late Darlowe Olsen, owner of the Roof Garden Ballroom, for one summer. I must have been a pain asking him questions non-stop about the business and about the “stars.” His comments on Conway Twitty were always memorable. My favorite, ” One of the classiest, most professional, talented men I ever had the chance to deal with!”\n\nWe lost a real star when Conway passed suddenly from a heart attack while on tour in 1993.\n\nEvery time I hear “Lonely Blue Boy,” I always wonder how could one man bring that much gut level emotion out of a song. Simply incredible!\n\nJust think, Conway appeared at our Hollyhock Ballroom on NINE different occasions. We had a real appreciation for what Conway was really all about.\n\nUntil Next Month\n\nTake Care & Remember The Music"
