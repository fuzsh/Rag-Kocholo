Conway Twitty (born Harold Lloyd Jenkins; September 1, 1933 – June 5, 1993) was an American country music singer. Originally a '50s rock & roll singer, Conway Twitty became the reigning country superstar of the '70s and '80s, racking up a record 40 US number one hits over the course of two decades. With his deep, resonant down-home voice, Twitty was one of the smoothest balladeers to work in Nashville during the country-pop era, but he was also one of the most adventurous. More than any other singer, he was responsible for selling country as an "adult" music, slipping sexually suggestive lyrics into his lush productions, yet never singing misogynist lyrics.

Peel was a fan of Conway's early records, which he mentioned on his 05 June 1993 (BFBS) show (coincidentally the day Conway died, although the show was pre-recorded on the date) and suggested to Josh, his friend, who was going to America, to visit Twitty City, a country music entertainment complex created by the singer.

In 1999, Peel nominated Conway Twitty's 'It's Only Make Believe' as his Peelenium 1958.

Peel's last show for BBC Radio One in 2004 featured a Pig's Big 78 of the singer's It's Only Make Believe track, which Sheila, his wife, recalled singing with Peel in his last programme, that was mentioned on Margrave Of The Marshes (Bantam Press, hardback edition, p.389-90).
