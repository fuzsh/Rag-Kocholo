Thanks to @jews_of_ny for sharing that with me üíô\n\nHere‚Äôs a little of my family history for you pre-1948: In the early 1900‚Äôs, my great-great-grandfather, Shaul Yitzchak, purchased 3 large buildings and a courtyard on the border of Tel Aviv-Yaffo from the German Templar of the ‚ÄúAmerican Colony‚Äù, Johann Georg Kappus senior, for 15,000 golden francs. He named this neighborhood Batei Varsha (Houses of Warsaw) and it became one of the first Jewish neighborhoods which helped create a continuous Jewish presence in Jaffa. \n\nOn May 1, 1921, after Winston Churchill refused to cancel the Balfour Declaration, Arab riots broke out in Yaffo, the second largest Jewish-Arab city in the British Mandate, with 16,000 Jews and 26,000 Arabs. The Arabs m*rdered thirteen Jews in the Jaffa streets. Members of the Haganah managed to move my family and Batei Varsha residents to Tel Aviv while Shaul Yitzchak, together with his sons and son-in-law Layzer Deutsch (my great-grandfather), stayed behind to protect the complex alongside the Haganah fighters. Armed with only one gun and a few bullets, they chased away the attackers and succeeded in saving Batei Varsha.\n\nMeanwhile, the Arab riots of 1929 forced my family to once again abandon their home and move in with Rabbi Nechemia Berman on Kalisher Street in Tel Aviv. They later returned home but were forced to flee once again during riots of April 1936, when Arabs looted and burned down the complex. Though some residents returned to rebuild, my family remained in Tel Aviv. Shaul Yitzchak continued to visit every Friday, until it was completely destroyed once again on August 15, 1947, on the eve of the War of Independence. In 1956, under the State of Israel‚Äôs Development Authority, Batei Varsha became the grounds for the Tel Aviv police offices, and it remains so today.\n\n*My cousin Rabbanit Shani Taragin wrote an article for @worldmizrachi about our pioneering family history in Tel Aviv and that is where this excerpt comes from \n\n#amyisraelchai #jewishlife\".",
