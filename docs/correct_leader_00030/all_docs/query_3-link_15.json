In the early days of the State of Israel Meir succeeded in raising $50 million to purchase the means for Israel to defend itself and survive. An ardent Zionist her entire life, Meir served her country in a multitude of official capacities including Ambassador to Moscow, Labor Minister, Foreign Minister, and from 1969-1974, Prime Minister at Israel’s helm during the difficult period of the Yom Kippur War. One of her most famous quotes is, “We can forgive you for killing our sons. But we will never forgive you for making us kill yours.”"
