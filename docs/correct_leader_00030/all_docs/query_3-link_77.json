        "text": "A surprise attack by an underestimated enemy shatters the delusions of a complacent nation. Within hours, a staggering number of Israelis are killed and wounded.\n\nAs the state recovers, pressure mounts on its leader to resign.\n\nIt's not October 2023 — but October 1973 — and prime minister Golda Meir's days as leader are numbered.\n\n\"She was at the time considered a failed prime minister, specifically because of the surprise attack, and the country's lack of preparedness,\" historian and author Gershom Gorenberg tells 7.30.\n\nFifty years on, Benjamin Netanyahu is blamed by many Israelis for the failures that contributed to the horrors of October 7.\n\nLike Golda Meir, he's trying to hang on to power.\n\nSeven months after the attack, in the face of growing public protests, Meir resigned.\n\n\"But his attempts to assign blame to everybody but himself have only amplified and accelerated public dissatisfaction and anger.\n\n\"The most recent example where he tweeted in the middle of the night that it was the head of these two intelligence agencies that were responsible and not him, he produced a tremendous backlash, and by the morning, he was forced to issue an apology for it.\"\n\nHow the image of 'Mr Security' collapsed\n\nDuring his three stretches as Israel's prime minister, totalling more than 16 years, Mr Netanyahu portrayed himself as the one leader who could keep Israelis safe.\n\n\"Netanyahu sold himself as Mr Security, you know, and ran on the fact that he was tougher than his opponents and that the previous government was weak on terror, and that you needed Netanyahu to have a leader who would guarantee Israel's security,\" Mr Gorenberg said.\n\n\"Well, that's obviously collapsed because Israel has suffered its worst catastrophe in terms of casualties in a single day. The worst attack on it, militarily, in 50 years.\"\n\nMr Gorenberg said that Mr Netanyahu and Hamas have fed off each other.\n\n\"I don't want to create a moral equivalency … that escapes from the pure, brutal horror of what Hamas did on October 7, in terms of a premeditated barbaric attack on civilians,\" he said.\n\n\"But the way in which they reinforced each other was that Hamas's rule of Gaza, and the repeated rounds of fighting with Gaza, and the rocket attacks from Gaza, all served to prove to the Israeli public that there is no partner for peace agreement, that pulling out of Gaza in 2005 only led to Hamas attacks and therefore strengthened the right.\n\n\"The internal logic here is that on both sides, you have a politics of saying, 'I want all of the land,' which says to the other side, 'there's no grounds for compromise'.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nPolicies such as encouraging the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank have weakened Hamas's rival, the more moderate Palestinian Authority.\n\nA 2011 prisoner swap of more than 1000 Palestinians for one captured Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, was seen as a victory for Hamas.\n\nProfessor Gideon Rahat, from the department of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said Mr Netanyahu's strategy was to keep Hamas in Gaza.\n\n\"And, therefore, to be able to say, for very good justification, you cannot make any progress with the peace process because the Palestinians are divided,\" Professor Rahat said.\n\n\"He believed he could keep Hamas restrained in Gaza.\n\n\"Here and there, you get rockets. So you hit back.\n\n\"It was seen as a successful policy by him and his allies, because it enabled them to bring more people into the settlements and to make a peace agreement in the future, with a two-state solution, more difficult.\"\n\nA two-state solution\n\nA two-state solution would involve Palestinians taking control of Gaza and large parts of the West Bank, which is now home to about 700,000 Israeli settlers.\n\nMr Netanyahu won power at the last election through an alliance with the settler movement and the ultra-conservative politicians who support them.\n\nHe's also facing corruption charges over allegations that he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts from businessmen, including Australian James Packer.\n\nGershom Gorenberg believes Mr Netanyahu's so-called \"judicial reforms\" could be an effort to protect himself from conviction and jailing over those charges.\n\n\"If, for instance, the ruling coalition has absolute power over appointing judges, including judges to the Supreme Court, Netanyahu is basically saying, 'I have unrestricted power to appoint the judges who may very well hear an appeal on my conviction',\" Mr Gorenberg said.\n\nEitan Shamir, the head of Israel's Begin Sadat Centre for Strategic Studies, said the nation's military was destabilised by the ensuing chaos.\n\n\"The chief of staff … was trying to maintain the ranks, but it seems like everything is falling apart,\" Eitan Shamir said.\n\n\"There were the reservists who said, 'we're not going to report to reserve duty'.\n\n\"We had parents saying, 'our kids are not going to enlist' … and among the career officers people were saying 'we are not going to sign on again, we are going to leave the military'.\n\n\"This seemed like a huge crisis. The focus was there.\"\n\nThe problems in the West Bank, the unchecked build-up of Hamas and a distracted military all coalesced in the disaster of October 7.\n\nBut will the man at the helm follow the trajectory of Golda Meir, after the 1973 attacks?\n\n\"I don't think he will be able to survive,\" Eitan Shamir said.\n\n\"Like in the Yom Kippur War, there is going to be a lot of anger at this government that is going to erupt after this war.\n\n\"I think he will try to survive, because he always has.\n\n\"He will try to ensure there is victory in the sense that Hamas no longer controls Gaza … and he will say this was not my fault. But I think it will not be enough to save him.\"\n\nProfessor Rahat said Mr Netanyahu should step down for the sake of the country.\n\n\"Whether it will happen? He's known to be a magician. Whether there are more rabbits in his hat, I don't know.\""
