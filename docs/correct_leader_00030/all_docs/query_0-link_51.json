        "text": "(1898–1978). One of the founders of the state of Israel, Golda Meir served in many posts in the Israeli government. She also served as prime minister from 1969 to 1974.\n\nBorn in Kyiv (Kiev), Russia (now Kyiv, Ukraine), on May 3, 1898, she was originally named Goldie Mabovitch. She and her family moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1906. At 17 she joined the Zionist movement, which worked to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. In 1917 she married Morris Myerson, and they had two children. They joined a kibbutz, or communal farm, in British-ruled Palestine in 1921. Until the establishment of Israel she led missions to Europe and the United States for the World Zionist Organization and the Jewish Agency for Palestine. She led resistance to the British and also worked with the British as a delegate to the Vaad Leumi, or National Council. The council was the chief organ of Jewish self-government under the British mandate.\n\nDuring World War II Meir served on the British War Economic Advisory Council. In May 1948 she was a signer of the declaration of independence of the new state of Israel. Meir became Israel’s first ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1948, minister of labor in 1949, and foreign minister in 1956. It was at this time that she took the Hebrew name Meir.\n\nMeir retired in 1965 but was drafted as prime minister in 1969. She was returned to office after elections in 1969 and 1973. In the wake of a political crisis over setbacks in Israel’s struggle for security, recognition, and peace in the Middle East, she resigned in 1974. She died in Jerusalem on December 8, 1978."
