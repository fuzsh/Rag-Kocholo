        "meta_description": "Almost forty years after her death, Golda Meir's image is still highly controversial. Few in Israel and abroad attempted to deal with the complex personality of the woman who led Israel for five critical years. This biography is based on original sources, memoirs and interviews with many personalities. The author who served as spokesman for Golda Meir in 1973-1974 weaves a gripping story of one of the builders and leaders of the State of Israel.",
