She earned her LL.B. at Hebrew University in Jerusalem (Magna Cum Laude) and her S.J.D at Yale Law School. Lahav has written extensively on Israeli legal history, freedom of expression, and women’s rights. Her 1974 article “The Status of Women in Israel: Myth and Reality” pioneered the field of women legal studies in Israel. Lahav is the recipient of the 2017 Life Achievement Award from the Association for Israel Studies and the Israel Institute and the 2022 Golda Meir Prize from the Golda Meir Foundation for Society and Leadership.\n\nThe Washington History Seminar is co-chaired by Eric Arnesen (George Washington University) and Christian Ostermann (Woodrow Wilson Center) and is organized jointly by the American Historical Association and the Woodrow Wilson Center's History and Public Policy Program. It meets weekly during the academic year. The seminar thanks its anonymous individual donors and institutional partner (the George Washington University History Department) for their continued support."
