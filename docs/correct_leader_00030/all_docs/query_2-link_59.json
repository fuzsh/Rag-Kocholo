        "text": "Senator cosponsored bipartisan legislation directing Treasury Secretary to mint commemorative coins featuring Golda Meir, Israel’s First Female Prime Minister\n\nWASHINGTON – Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema cosponsored bipartisan legislation directing the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to mint commemorative coins featuring Golda Meir, the first female Prime Minister of Israel, in honor of the 75th anniversary of U.S.-Israel relations.\n\n“The relationship between the U.S. and the State of Israel serves as an example of what a strong, principled alliance can look like, thanks in part to leaders like Prime Minister Golda Meir. Our legislation demonstrates America’s commitment to upholding our relations with Israel – more critical now than ever as we support our closest ally’s right to defend herself,” said Sinema.\n\nThe Sinema-backed bipartisan bill honors the 75th anniversary of U.S.-Israel relations by minting commemorative coins featuring former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir. The coin will be minted in 2026 and all proceeds will fund Kiryat Sanz Laniado Hospital, a not-for-profit providing critical medical services in Netanya, Israel.\n\nGolda Meir served as the fourth Prime Minister of Israel from 1969 to 1974. She spent much of her childhood and young adult life in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. She forged close relationships with several U.S. presidents, including John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Regan."
