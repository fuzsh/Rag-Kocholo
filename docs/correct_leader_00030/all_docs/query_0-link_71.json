        "text": "Picturing Golda Meir is a collection of photographic images documenting the life of Golda Meir. 157 images were selected from The Golda Meir Collection, 1904-1987 housed in the Archives Department of the UWM Libraries. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) Libraries established a digitization program in the fall of 2001. The primary mission of the program is to serve the UWM academic community and the general public by providing remote access to unique library resources. The UWM Libraries use digital technologies to expand access and enhance discovery of these resources through development and management of distinctive digital collections. Included in their collection are digital images of Golda Meir.\n\nYou can explore the collection online through the link below.\n\nAccess the Picturing Golda Meir Collection »\n\nGolda Meir Portrait, late 1920's | UWM Archives Digital Photo Collection\n\nSource: University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) Libraries website\n\nGolda Meir in: World Leaders and Friends Hail ‘Extraordinary’ Woman\n\nPublished in the New York Times, read here »\n\nGolda Meir | Duty and the Call to Power\n\nBy Dr. Norman W.
