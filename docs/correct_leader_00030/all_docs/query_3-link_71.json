        "text": "Tzipi Livni – The foreign minister and chief negotiator with the Palestinians has been called the most powerful woman in Israel since Golda Meir, the prime minister in the 1970s.\n\nLast year she called on Olmert to quit after the prime minister was criticised in a report on the conduct of Israel’s war against Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nLivni is a former intelligence agent and like Olmert and Ariel Sharon, the former prime minister, she left the Likud party to form Kadima in 2005.\n\nShaul Mofaz – A deputy prime minister and the current minister of transport is probably more notabe as a military man.\n\nHe joined the Israeli army after leaving high school, eventually rising to chief of staff. Later he was named defence minister.\n\nMofaz is well-known for his tough tactics in crushing a Palestinian uprising after peace talks failed in 2000 and has already launched his own campaign for the Kadima leadership.\n\nAvi Dichter – The minister for public security was a member of an elite army unit and the Shin Bet intelligence agency before joining Kadima in 2005.\n\nHe gained a seat in the Knesset in March 2006 and he has expressed doubts about the current peace process with the Palestinians.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu – The prime minister from 1996 to 1999 and leader of Likud party since Sharon, Olmert and Livni, among others, formed Kadima.\n\nEducated in the US, he became a decorated commando before entering politics.\n\nAs finance minister under Sharon from 2003, Netanyahu, pushed through economic changes that angered the left but are credited by some with boosting economic growth.\n\nEhud Barak – Another former prime minister and highy decorated commando, Barak is now the defence minister and leader of the Labour party, Kadima’s main coalition ally.\n\nWhen he campaigned for the Labour leadership last year, he said Olmert should quit if the report in to the war with Hezbollah criticised him. It did, but Barak said he would wait and urge Olmert to go “at a more convenient time”.\n\nBarak would have to be elected to the Knesset before he could become prime minister."
