        "text": "Mrs Meir, who has come out of retirement to take up the role, pledged to maintain national unity and called on the people who worked with Mr Eshkol to \"continue in the same framework\" in her government.\n\nShe added: \"I have never failed to accept party decisions and I shall not refuse now.\n\n\"I have faced difficult problems in the past but nothing like the one I'm faced with now in leading the country.\"\n\nWith her party controlling the largest faction in parliament, Acting Prime Minister Yigal Allon and Defence Minister Moshe Dayan have agreed to step aside and reserve their own bids for power until later in the year.\n\nFollowing their decision, she was the only nominee put forward before the central committee.\n\nMrs Meir, a former schoolteacher in America, previously served as Israeli foreign minister for 10 years before she retired following ill health.\n\nBecause of her age and condition, her appointment is regarded by many as a stop-gap, intended to maintain national unity before the Labour Party chooses a leader for the October general elections.\n\nMany supporters within the party consider General Dayan to be a more suitable candidate.\n\nActing Prime Minister Mr Allon also has substantial backing within the party leadership.\n\nBoth are younger than Mrs Meir and considered national heroes.\n\nDespite such opposition, General Dayan, who is expected to retain his post as defence minister, said he would be honoured to work with Mrs Meir.\n\nHer government is expected to reflect the same parties and ministers who previously served under Mr Eshkol.\n\nDetails of her new cabinet will be announced in the next few days."
