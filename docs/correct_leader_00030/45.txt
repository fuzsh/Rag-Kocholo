Full Name: Goldie Mabovitch [later Myerson]

Profession: 4th Prime Minister of Israel

Biography: Golda Meir was an Israeli politician who served as the fourth Prime Minister of Israel. Born Golda Mabovitch in Kyiv, in what is now Ukraine, she emigrated with her family to the United States in 1906, settling in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Meir's involvement in Zionist politics began in her youth and continued as she moved to Mandatory Palestine in 1921, where she became an active participant in the Zionist movement.

Golda Meir was one of the signatories of Israel's Declaration of Independence in 1948, a pivotal moment in her long political career. Prior to her premiership, she held various key positions in Israel's government. She served as Minister of Labour from 1949 to 1956, during which she played a significant role in the development of the newly established state, overseeing housing and infrastructure projects to accommodate the massive influx of Jewish immigrants.

In 1956, Meir became Israel's Foreign Minister, a position she held until 1966. During her tenure, she was known for her efforts to build relations with newly independent African countries and for her role in covert operations, including Operation Moses, which brought Ethiopian Jews to Israel. She was also instrumental in securing arms from France that were crucial during the Suez Crisis.

Golda Meir was elected Prime Minister of Israel in 1969, after serving as Secretary-General of the Labor Party. Her term as Prime Minister, which lasted until 1974, was marked by significant events. She led Israel during the difficult period of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria. The war had profound effects on Israeli society and politics and shaped Meir's legacy.

Meir was known for her straightforwardness, determination, and sense of responsibility to the Jewish people, often portrayed as the "Iron Lady" of Israeli politics. Her premiership was also noted for efforts to further the peace process with Israel's Arab neighbors, despite the challenging geopolitical climate.

After resigning in 1974, Golda Meir remained active in public life and continued to influence Israeli politics and society. She passed away in Jerusalem in 1978.
