        "text": "In August 1735 John Kirby published his book called \"The Suffolk Traveller\". He would follow this up in 1736 by publishing a one inch to the mile map of the county, followed by a half inch scale in 1737. Not much is known about John Kirby's origins, but he was known to have run Glevering watermill, near Wickham market, in Suffolk after 1714. By 1725 he had taken up land surveying, and he made measured plans for the estates of local gentlemen. This portrait of him was made by Thomas Gainsborough shortly before Kirby died in 1753, in Ipswich. Kirby had continued to improve the Suffolk Traveller after its first edition, and sold copies from a shop in Wickham Market, as well as through other booksellers. One of his sons, Joshua Kirby, was a friend of Thomas Gainsborough and that is how Gainsborough came to paint this portrait of Joshua's father.\n\nKirby had painstakingly raised himself from miller to surveyor, but his book and maps took years to produce. They were based upon surveys of the county by Kirby and Nathaniel Bacon made between 1732 and 1733. Some time in 1733 Bacon was replaced by Francis Emerton, a surveyor from Gillingham near Beccles, and Kirby and Emerton worked together on the survey through into 1734.\n\nEmerton had previously been working on a similar Suffolk project for James Corbridge, who had announced his intention to survey Norfolk and Suffolk in 1727. Emerton now took the lists of subscribers for the Corbridge map, and gave them to Kirby, ensuring that the Kirby map would be the one to succeed.\n\nPreviously published maps had all been based upon Christopher Saxton's survey of 1575, and as over 150 years had passed, Kirby represented a significant updating and improvement on these earlier efforts.\n\nIn common with publishing practice at the time, subscriptions for the map were invited prior to publication, to be collected at booksellers throughout the county. In Bury these were taken by Hannibal Hall and Thomas Bailey during 1732. In 1733 Mrs Mary Watson, bookseller, was taking the Bury subscriptions. People subscribing for the maps at ten shillings per sheet received the book gratis.\n\nThe map was engraved on to four copper plates for printing by Mr Richard Collins at Bury St Edmunds. Each plate would produce one imperial sized sheet of paper.\n\nAt this time John Kirby was a little known, local surveyor living in Wickham Market. After he died in 1753 a second edition of his Suffolk Traveller was published in 1764 by John Shave, an Ipswich publisher. However, Kirby himself had always planned further editions.\n\nThe Suffolk Traveller consisted of a description of the county, followed by a series of journies between towns, in which each town or village is described, together with the route to take to the next village. After the introduction to Suffolk he starts with Ipswich and a village by village perambulation to Yarmouth. Having examined all roads out of Ipswich , he then describes the roads out of Bury, and so on.\n\nSome of his observations on Suffolk included the following:\n\n\"This county is naturally divided into the Sandlands, the Woodlands, and the Fielding......\"\n\nKirby's sand lands were the sandy soils of the eastern coastal strip of Suffolk, which he subdivided into marsh, arable and heath.\n\nThe woodland part included the southern part of Suffolk from the hundred of Blything as far as Haverhill, including those heavy clay parts of Thedwastry, Blackbourne and Thingoe.\n\n\"This part is generally very Dirty and Fruitful. In this part is made the Suffolk Butter, so managed by the neat dairy wife, that it is justly esteemed the pleasantest and best in England. The cheeses, if right made, none much better, and if not so, none can be worse.\n\nThe Fielding part contains all the hundred of Lackford, and the remaining parts of the hundreds of Blackbourne, Thedwastry, and Thingoe; and is most of it Sheep-Walks, yet affords good corn in divers parts.\"\n\n\"The ecclesiastical government is under the Bishop of Norwich, it being part of that see....it is divided into two archdeaconries, viz Suffolk containing the Eastern parts of this county, and Sudbury including the Western parts. These two archdeaconries are subdivided into 22 Deaneries.......The Deaconries in the Archdeaconry of Sudbury are, Sudbury, Stow, Thingoe, Clare, Fordham, Hartsmere, Blackbourne and Thedwastry....\"\n\n\"The civil government of this county is in the High Sheriff, for the time being. The division of this county ...was formerly divided into the Geldable and the Liberties of St Edmund, St Etheldred, and St Audrey; but the present division is into the Geldable and the Franchise or Liberty of St Edmund, each of them furnishes a distinct Grand Jury at the Assizes...\"\n\n\"Towards the military defence of the kingdom, this county furnishes, as its quota to the Militia, 4 Regiments of Foot, the White, the Red, the Yellow, and the Blew, each consisting of 6 companies. The White is raised in the south part, the Red in the North about Hoxne hundred, the Blew in the east about Beccles, and the Yellow in the west about Clare. There is one Regiment of Horse of 4 Troops, each severally carrying the colours of the Foot regiments, and belonging to them, and raised in the same parts of the country. The Militia is under the command of the Lord Lieutenant of the County, the Most Noble Charles, Duke of Grafton, being the present Lord Lieutenant.\"\n\nThe 1735 edition of the Suffolk Traveller was printed by John Bagnall at Ipswich. It contains many observations on the towns and villages of Suffolk, some of which were a bit sketchy.\n\nKirby gave the following description of Haverhill:\n\n\"Haverhill, or as in old records Haverhull or Haverel, is a long thorough-fare mean built town about a mile in length. The south end of the street is part in this County, and part in Essex. The north end is wholly in Suffolk. It has a mean market weekly on Wednesdays, and two fairs yearly, the one on May the 1st, and the other on August the 15th. Here is nothing in this town worthy of remark, at present: but it seems to have been larger than it is now, by the ruins of a church or chapel, still remaining.\"\n\nOf Bury, Kirby wrote:\n\n\"Bury St Edmunds is situate on the west side of the River Lark, which is at present navigable from Lynn to Fornham, a mile north of the town. It has a most fruitful enclosed country on the south and south west, and on the north and north west the most delicious champaign fields, extending themselves to Lynn, and that part of the Norfolk Coast. The country on the east is partly open and partly enclosed. It is so regularly built, that almost all the streets cut one another at right angles; and it stands upon such an easy ascent that an ancient writer has recorded this encomium of it : \"That the sun shines not upon a town more agreeable in its situation.\n\nThis was the Villa Faustini of the Romans, and afterwards had the name of Bedericesworth, or Beodricesworth, differently spelt by different authors, as Saxon names frequently are, and taken, if we might credit the records of the old monks, from one Beodricus, who being Lord and Proprietary of this town made St Edmund his heir.\n\nThe abbey.....\".\n\nKirby went on to describe St Edmund's life. He spoke disapprovingly of how the Benedictines ousted secular clerics in 1020 and described how King Canute levied a tax of 4 pence on ploughland in Suffolk and Norfolk to pay for \"a more magnificent church to the honour of this martyr.\" There is a description of the abbey and churches of Bury, together with the tombs of Mary Tudor and Roger Drury.\n\nOn a contemporary note he described St James church and wrote:\n\n\"There is in this church a convenient library, but no monument of note.\n\nThe rest of the publick buildings are the Abby Gate, which still speaks of the grandeur of the former abby; the Guildhall; the Grammar School, endowed by Edward VI; the Market Cross; the Wool-Hall; and the Shire House.\n\nThe civil government of the town is is now lodged in the hands of an Alderman, a Recorder, 12 Capital Burgesses, and 24 Common Burgesses. These have the sole right of choosing their own Burgesses in Parliament.\n\nThere are two weekly markets, on Wednesdays and Saturdays; the chief market is on Wednesday, and a very considerable one it is, well served with all manner of provisions. And three annual fairs; the first on Easter Tuesday, the second for three days before the feast of St Matthew and three days after, but this is generally protracted to an uncertain length, for the diversion of the nobility and gentry that usually resort to it; and the third on St Edmunds Day, November the 20th.\n\nThe Benefactors to this town are very numerous, and the commemoration of them is annually celebrated on the Thursday in Plough Monday Week.\n\nThe agreeableness of its situation has always induced many of the gentry to reside in this town and in its neighbourhood; and as it formerlly gave birth and education to several persons who were emminent in church and state, so it has also lately; and I hope may take its present flourishing condition as an earnest of its future prosperity and success.\n\nThus much for Bury St Edmunds. We will now take a journey from thence to Yarmouth..........\"\n\nA Freemasonry Lodge was established at the White Horse Inn on the Buttermarket. This inn was superceded by Bullens haberdashers in 1870, and in later years served as Purdey's Coffe Shop, Palmers Restaurant, and is now a travel agency and Burger King restaurant.\n\nThe Great Plague of Haverhill killed 79 people in an already depleted population.\n\nIn Bury, Orbell Ray died, and left his valuable share of the Ray yarn-making business to his nephew, James Oakes, later to be known to us from the diaries he wrote from 1778 to 1827. James Oakes was born in November, 1741, the son of James Oakes senior and Susan Ray. He was educated at the King Edward VI Grammar School in Bury, and had left at 16, to be apprenticed for four years with his uncle, Orbell Ray. He had been with Ray eleven years by 1768.\n\nOakes's father had come to Bury from Lancashire some time before 1726, and set up as a wholesaler in Manchester cotton goods at the top of Cook Row, today called Abbeygate Street. In 1729 he married a local woman who died in 1737, leaving him some property. In 1741 he married Susan Ray, giving him entry to the leading social, commercial and political families in Bury. The Rays were substantial clothiers and yarn makers, and together with about 20 other yarn makers made up a major industry in Bury. James Oakes senior had died in 1759 as an eminent tradesman of Bury.\n\nBy the 1760's all the wool used in the Suffolk yarn industry came from long fleeced wool brought from Lincolnshire and some other counties. This wool was traded in two wool halls in Bury, having been brought in from Stourbridge Fair and from London markets. Stourbridge was the source of most of the wool sold into Norfolk and Suffolk. Defoe had called it the biggest fair in the nation.\n\nThe short fleece wool from Suffolk and Norfolk sheep was sold in these woolhalls and then had to be sent to Yorkshire to be carded and spun for woollen cloths. Our local sheep were bred more for eating, and had not produced long staple wool since the seventeenth century.\n\nLincolnshire wool arrived in Bury via the waggon service to Stamford, and from the Midlands by way of the Lark navigation to Kings Lynn and beyond. Ships also landed wool at Ipswich, and at Yarmouth, which could be waggoned to Bury.\n\nThe best of the Romney Marsh wool, from Kent, also went to Norwich and to Bury.\n\nBy this time Ray, Oakes and company were now scouring and washing the raw wool as part of their manufacturing process of turning raw wool into high quality yarn. This was done in town, mainly in St Andrews Street South, in large buildings with open areas for drying it afterwards. Previously the farmers may have washed the wool, or there were specialist woolstaplers who did it.\n\nApprenticeship registers for 1750 to 1765 also showed that there were more woolcombers in and around Bury St Edmunds than anywhere else in Suffolk. Hadleigh came next in numbers followed by Kersey, Boxford, Lavenham, Glemsford, Nayland and Sudbury. Oakes reckoned that one comber produced enough wool to keep 30 spinners in work. Again, if they worked for Oakes, it would have been behind his Guildhall Street home, in St Andrews Street, in a series of comb shops in one large narrow building. These were built between 1745 and 1758. This was a considerable concentration of labour and capital for this mainly pre-industrial time.\n\nThe combs used in the combing of wool needed to be heated, and Oakes seems to have been bringing in coal for this purpose via the Lark Navigation, by this time. This also probably led him to sell coal on to other local users, as by 1788, he was included in a list of Bury coal merchants.\n\nThe spinning side of the business was, however, anything but industrialised, and it is likely that Oakes employed at least 1,500 spinners working in their own homes, throughout the countryside. These networks of spinners extended over large areas, as Oakes had workers from Burwell to Woodbridge, a spread of 60 miles. Packmen took loads of combed wool to local shopkeepers or publicans who acted as Putters - Out to their own local teams of spinners.\n\nArthur Young commented on the trade of wool combing in Lavenham in 1769. Young wrote that many Lavenham woolcombers earned from 12s to 14s a week, and were thus much better off than local weavers of says and calamencoes who only earned 5s 6d to 6s a week. Naturally this would be a powerful incentive resulting in the reduction in weaving and the shift to combing and spinning.\n\nNorman Scarfe has suggested that Bury's first town guide was produced in 1768, called, \"A Description of the Ancient and Present State of the Town and Abbey\". It went to at least three editions, the third being published in 1782.\n\nIn 1773 Little Saxham Hall was demolished. It was a moated site and upon demolition the new bridge shown here was constructed to give farm access to the grassed over site.\n\nLittle Saxham Hall had belonged to the Crofts family since the 1530s, and it is thought that John Crofts had moved here from West Stow Hall, which he now retained mainly as a hunting lodge. A descendant, Sir John Crofts, had taken up residence at Saxham in 1612, having moved in from Bedfordshire on the death of his father. He had been knighted in Dublin in 1599, probably for active service in Ireland. He lived at Little Saxham from 1612 until his death in March 1628, and Sir John had several visits from James I, the recorded ones being in February 1620, December 1621 and February 1622. After the Civil War King Charles II visited Baron Crofts at Saxham at least four times, in March 1666, October 1668, April 1670 and October 1676. A century later the great days of Little Saxham were long forgotten. The last owner, Richard Crofts, was now living at West Harling, in Norfolk. It was he who gave instructions for the Hall to be demolished in 1773. It was now hopelessly old fashioned, and had probably fallen into disrepair, having been neglected and unoccupied for some time. The estate was retained by the Crofts family until its sale in 1789.\n\nThere had been a silk industry in Spitalfields, London for a century, founded mainly by Protestant Huguenot weavers escaping persecution in France after 1665. By 1773, ther had been almost a decade of trouble in Spitalfields caused by cheaper foreign competition, and resulting bitter disputes and even riots over conditions and rates of pay. A special act of Parliament, the Spitalfields Weavers Act, was passed in 1773. From now on, the wages for silk weavers would be fixed: in Middlesex by the magistrates, and in London by the Lord Mayor, Recorder and Aldermen. It would become illegal for any master to pay more, or any workman to accept less, than the established rates. This seemed like a good idea, but it resulted in both weavers and silk masters wanting to escape from these regulations. Over the next decades there would be a drift to silk production to places like Sudbury, Glemsford, and a little later, even as far as Haverhill. These towns also had wool workers who were losing work to foreign competition, and were ready to take on silk weaving at rates below those previously demanded in Spitalfields. At first this work was organised through outworkers, who had their own looms at home. It is therefore difficult to find documentary evidence of when this first occurred, but in July 1784 Arthur Young took his French visitors on a five or six day tour of Suffolk and the Essex border. They went to Long Melford and Sudbury, noting the \"considerable trade in woollens and silk stuffs.\" In Sudbury itself there is a record of silk weaving in Weavers Lane by 1791.\n\nThomas Warren junior updated and re-issued his father's map of Bury, produced first in 1748. This edition would show new illustrations of notable buildings in the town, including the Robert Adam Market Cross, newly designed and started in 1774.\n\nThis map is best understood as a second edition of his father's work. It looks much the same, but includes important updates. The Hervey's Manor House on Honey Hill now refers to the \"late\" Earl of Bristol, and the coats of arms of the gentry were changed to reflect current owners.\n\nThe new butchers shambles is shown, as is the new Quaker Meeting House on its present site. At this time St Johns Street was still called Long Brackland all along its length. Woolhall Street still does not exist as the Woolhall was still standing at this time.\n\nThis map was on sale for four shillings, and is the most familiar of Warren's maps, being the version reproduced for sale in Moyse's Hall Museum today. The map can be examined here : Thomas Warren's 1776 Map\n\nIn Ipswich, Thomas Page, a bookbinder, had got hold of copies of John Kirby's 1736 map of Suffolk, which he advertised for sale. Illustrating some of the cut throat methods of the time, he announced that the revised and corrected map produced by Kirby's sons in 1766 was 'a pirated or pretended survey'.\n\nFrom 1774 to 1776, the Angel Hotel was rebuilt more or less into its present appearance in red brick. Inns of various forms had stood on its site since at least 1282, when an agreement was made by Abbot John and the convent of the abbey to let property here as a taberna.\n\nRound the corner from the Angel stood another important old inn called the Six Bells. This stood on the corner of Churchgate Street facing Chequers Square. Today this building houses the Masonic Lodge. The Six Bells had traded as licensed premises since at least the 1680's. In 1776 Mathias Otley went into partnership with its Landlord Mr Anderson to start a Post Chaise business at the inn. Anderson also took over the nearby Coffee House of Mrs Letitia Rookes on her retirement. He made it a Coffee Room and Reading Room for the Six Bells. This Coffee House stood between St James' Church and the Norman Tower. The Six Bells prospered and by 1818 was an important Coaching Inn, along with the Angel.\n\nIn 1776, William Dalton opened a bank on the Cornhill at Bury St Edmunds. Like John Spink, he was already a businessman, but in this case Dalton was a Wine Merchant. This small bank never failed, but was taken over in 1794 when Dalton died.\n\nAt Ickworth Capability Brown received his final payment of Â£581 for his work on landscaping the park and planting up many clumps of trees which still exist. The family were then living in Ickworth Lodge, so the work of Capability Brown was focussed on this house at this time. What other works Brown carried out is unclear.\n\nIn June 1776 Arthur Young the well known agricultural writer from Bradfield Combust, went to Ireland where he travelled widely. In 1777 he became the agent to Lord Kingsborough on his Irish estate. This stay would result in him publishing his \"Tour in Ireland\" in 1780.\n\nFor the last ten years John Palmer of Bath had been campaigning to improve the official post service. The Post was still being delivered by Post Boys while private carriers were able to make the same journey faster by coach.\n\nPalmer's proposal was to replace Post Boys with lightweight stagecoaches pulled by frequently changed teams of horses. The Post Office finally agreed in 1784 to a trial run between Bristol and London. The coach, drawn by four horses and carrying mail and four passengers, slashed the journey time from a day and a half to just sixteen hours. It was the start of a mail coach service that was to cover the length and breadth of the country for the next 62 years.\n\nMail Coach Tokens were later issued in praise of John Palmer for pushing the proposal forward.\n\nThe winter of 1783 into 1784 was Siberian in character. The winter frost was so severe that even the tough ivy and holly trees were killed. Not for nothing has the period from 1550 to 1850 been called a Little Ice Age, but the true reason for this was almost certainly the result of the volcanic eruption at the Laki fissure in Iceland in 1783. Not only had 1783 experienced a year with a very poor summer, but the reduction in warming from the sun produced this appalling winter as well.\n\nIn January 1784 Arthur Young of Bradfield Hall founded the periodical \"Annals of Agriculture, and other Useful Arts\", and went on to edit the forty-six volumes eventually published as well as contributing a large proportion of their content. In his autobiography he referred to it as one of the greatest speculations of his life. This autobiography was not published until 1898, and it was edited by M Betham-Edwards. Publication of the Annals seems to have been attributed in error to 1783 in the autobiography.\n\nFor the first year the \"Annals\" was published monthly with \"indifferent success\", but was to be published continuously up to 1809. However, as usual, Young did not profit from his venture. He wrote that the constant re-issue of back numbers to complete sets for patrons, ate up all his profits. King George III took two sets every month, and contributed two articles under the pen name of Ralph Robinson, who was actually the King's shepherd at Windsor. Young claimed in his autobiography that the king travelled everywhere with the Annals, and that the King had told him, \"Mr Young, I consider myself as more obliged to you than to any other man in my dominions.\"\n\nArthur Young also recorded his pleasure in meeting at Bury the two elder sons of the French Duc de Liancourt, and their escort Maximilien de Lazowski, a man from a Polish family. Again he seems to have attributed these events to 1783 in his autobiography, but one of the two brothers, Francois de La Rochefoucauld, recorded these events in his diary for 1784. In 1988 the Suffolk Records Society published the diary of La Rochefoucauld under the title \"A Frenchman's Year In Suffolk, 1784.\" It is packed with detailed observations of life in English country society at the period.\n\nThe French party had arrived in Dover late in December 1783, and went on to London. They had intended to travel from London to Bristol, but were persuaded to make for Bury St Edmunds or Norwich. According to the Frenchman's diary, this decision was taken because it was drier in Suffolk than Bristol, and that English was better spoken in Bury than Bristol. Arthur Young recorded that the reason they came to Bury was, in fact, to meet him and to hear about English agriculture. They arrived in Bury on 7th January 1784, and soon met Dr John Symonds who took them under his wing. Symonds had a house in Bury, as well as his house at St Edmunds Hill, now called Moreton Hall. He was Professor of Modern History at Peterhouse College, Cambridge. The French party took up residence in apartments which seem to have been adjacent to the Angel Hotel.\n\nDr Symonds took them all to meet Arthur Young at Bradfield Hall, and Young became life long friends and correspondent with Lazowski. Francois de Rochefoucauld recorded that he very much liked Arthur Young, but disliked visiting Bradfield because Young kept an extremely poor table. But he had much more to say about Young's wife, who \"is always tormenting her children and servants, and is, more often than not, bad-tempered with visitors. They say that she beats her husband...\".\n\nIn June they moved in with Symonds at St Edmunds Hill.\n\nDr Francis Young has pointed out the following note from this visit, to illustrate local tolerance to Catholicism:\n\n\"The reminiscences of the French aristocrat FranÃ§ois de la Rochefoucauld, who visited Bury with his brother in 1784, are also very revealing - everyone knew what was going on when the Catholics went to mass, FranÃ§ois recalled, but no one did or said anything because everyone got along so well. It is possible that some of the Protestant gentry may have shared in FranÃ§oisâ own fashionable Enlightenment indifference to matters of religion. \"\n\nIn July 1784 Arthur Young took them all on a five or six day tour of Suffolk and the Essex border. They went to Long Melford and Sudbury, noting the \"considerable trade in woollens and silk stuffs.\" Sudbury had nearly all hands involved in woollen looms, producing cloths which were \"coarse and thin, a kind of double serge, good for clothes for working women.\" At Nayland the river was made very navigable, carrying great quantities of coal. Lazowski called it \"a superb village.\" At Colchester they noted the castle, the theatre, and the assembly room. The cloth trade there was as busy as at Sudbury. With 500 looms, \"always more work than workmen.\" \"The cloths resemble Sudbury's, but are not so fine: they are intended for Spain and America.\" Lazowski recorded that they used every last ounce of short Suffolk wool, and only a little of the long wool from Lincolnshire. The cloth went to London for dyeing, and on to Spain from whence they were sent to the Central American markets.\n\nThey travelled on to Mistley and Harwich, Holbrook, Woolverstone and Ipswich. Ipswich they found \"badly built, the streets narrow, without any alignment, and the road surface as bad as could be.\" From there they went to Woodbridge and Melton. Carrots were being grown on the sandy soils here, which were sent to London, while the poorest ones fed horses and pigs. From Saxmundham they went to visit Heveningham Hall, \"Sir Gerard Wanneck's house, which is superb, the only house in Suffolk really worth seeing.\" They headed back via Framlingham and Stowmarket, \"a town at best, no bigger than a small village, with scarcely three or four hundred houses.\" Hop growing was noted at Stowmarket, and on the sixth day, the tour ended back at Bury.\n\nIn September and October 1784 Dr Symonds took the French party on a tour of Norfolk. In 1785 they left Suffolk for the Midlands, North and West Country.\n\nWilliam Greene, a printer and bookseller in Hatter Street, died in 1784. He was the uncle of Peter Gedge, born in Norwich in 1758, and had given Gedge a job in Bury. In 1782, Gedge had founded the Bury Post newspaper. Gedge now married Sarah Greene, William's youngest daughter, and took over Greene's business, thus strengthening his rather small newspaper business.\n\nThe Gurteen family were operating as substantial weavers in Haverhill by this time. The firm has records to show that in 1784 Daniel Gurteen took Â£1,000 with bankers, putting the finance in place to start up in a bigger way of business than before. Daniel Gurteen specialised in weaving a material called drabbett, which was used for making smocks which were worn by the agricultural workers of the time. We believe that he was not actually making up finished garments at this time, but sold drabbett to other makers.\n\nGeorge Bloomfield moved from London to carry on the trade of shoe maker in Bury St Edmunds. He was Robert Bloomfield's elder brother, and he left Robert in London, also working as a cobbler, although Robert also had a sideline of making aeolian harps. Both brothers were born in Honington, and their mother and her other children were still there.\n\nAround 1784, one Robert Walpole was carrying on business as a banker in Bury St Edmunds. He was a Draper, and would retire by 1791. He was competing with the banks of John Spink, on the Market Hill since 1775, and William Dalton's Cornhill bank, opened in 1776.\n\nThere had been a Brewery in Westgate Street, Bury St Edmunds, throughout the 18th Century, owned by three generations of the Wright family. This building seems to be part of the Westgate Brewery which dates back to the time of Matthias Wright. High up on the gable end overlooking the Dog and Partridge carpark is a plaque which reads MW 1789, and probably indicates the date of building. Matthias was to be last of the Wrights to be a brewer as the entire premises and the brewing business was put up for sale by his executors in 1798. Possibly because of the poor economic conditions around the threat of invasion by Napoleon it did not sell, and would stand idle until 1805, when the Buck and Greene partnership would take over, and begin to restart the brewing process.\n\nIn October, 1789, the Bury Post carried this advertisement:\n\n\"The proprietor of the ROYAL LION, from the Tower of London, returns his sincere thanks to the nobility, gentry, and the public in general, who have honoured him with their company since his arrival in this town, and begs leave to acquaint them that this noble animal still continues to be daily exhibited in a commodious caravan on Angel Hill........This grand collection consists of near thirty curious and extraordinary animals. In order that the public may not be deceived they are hereby assured that there is no other lion, neither young nor old, that travels this kingdom.\"\n\nOn 5th December, 1789, the stationer and print maker and seller, Jacob Kendall died, and was buried in St Mary's churchyard. William Spanton recorded his gravestone \"which used to be legible on a stone next the railings at the east end of St Mary's Church\". This stone recorded not only \"Jacob Kendall Junior, one of the common counselmen of this Borough, died 5th December, 1789, aged 48 years\", but also his father , also called Jacob Kendall, who died in 1784, aged 67 years. Jacob the elder was a shoe maker or cordwainer according to Spanton. They lived at 13 Abbeygate Street, then called Cook Row. Jacob the younger was something of an artist, and drew the Angel Hill, Church Yard, the West Front and the 1785 ballon ascent, but apparently could not draw figures. It was believed that H W Bunbury of Great Barton Hall was responsible for the figures included in Kendall's published prints.\n\nSir Charles Kent had only just completed the building of Fornham Hall in his new park at Fornham St Genevieve. He now sold the whole estate to Bernard Edward Howard, who would become the 12th Duke of Norfolk in 1815. Howard would make extensive alterations to Fornham Hall and the grounds surrounding it.\n\nAlso in 1789, the estate of Little Saxham was sold by the Crofts family for just over Â£16,000. The estate had been in the Crofts family since the 1530s, and Little Saxham Hall had been a favourite haunt of both King James I and King Charles II. The hall had been demolished in 1773, but no member of the family had lived there for many years. The estate extended down to the River Linnet, and some of these fields, excluding the site of the Little Saxham Hall, are today part of the Ickworth Estate.\n\nIn 1789, the purchaser of Little Saxham was the Marquis of Cornwallis. However Charles, Marquis Cornwallis, would exchange it for West Stow in 1795 with Robert Rushbrooke.\n\nAt Bury St Edmunds, the Jesuit priest, John Gage died. He had built the catholic chapel in Westgate Street and run the illicit Catholic mission to Bury since 1755. Francis Young, \"Ironically, the Jesuit order did not officially exist between 1773 and 1814, but this had made little difference to Gageâs mission. When he died, the manor in Westley which his mother had given him reverted to the Jesuit Province, and would eventually fund the building of St Edmundâs Church in 1836. Gage was succeeded by an American priest, Charles Thompson.\"\n\nIn 1791 a third edition of Thomas Warren's Map of Bury was produced. This edition showed some of the surrounding countryside and the Town Fields. It also shows Woolhall Street for the first time, connecting the Cornhill with St Andrews Street South. Many names survive today such as Appledown Valley and Drovers Went, both now named parts of the Moreton Hall housing area. Eldo Farm is still surviving.\n\nOne interesting feature of this 1791 map is Cotton Lane, which was previously known as Scurfe Lane. On this map it is labelled \"Scurfe alias Cotton Lane.\" This lane had bordered marshy ground on its eastern side along the river suitable only for summer grazing. Its western flank represented the rear of properties built along Northgate Street. Much of the area liable to flood remained as allotment gardens into the 20th century.\n\nThis map was totally different to the first two editions in that it extended beyond the built up town to encompass the whole of the area within the Borough boundary. This new plan measured nearly five feet square, and only one copy was made. It was a commission by the Vestries of St James and St Mary's to help them to levy the Poor Rate. This survey showed who owned what property in the Borough, and it extended right out to the borough boundaries in open fields. It also shows the parish boundaries to ensure that the rates were paid to the correct parish. It was commissioned at a meeting of the vestries in September 1790, and delivered the following year. It was the definitive town plan of Bury until Payne's map of 1833.\n\nIn the 1960's four full size photocopies were reproduced to hang in borough properties. A copy of this map hangs in the Athenaeum lobby today, and another in the Suffolk Records Office in Bury. The original hangs in Moyse's Hall Museum. The map can be examined here : Thomas Warren's 1791 Map\n\nMuch of what we know about the inns of 18th century Bury St Edmunds derives from a letter written to the Bury Post in 1791. As gentlemen often wished not to be associated with the vulgar press, they used pseudonyms, such as this correspondent, who called himself \"Q\". His interest was in the signs used to advertise inns and taverns.\n\nin July 1784 Arthur Young took his French visitors on a five or six day tour of Suffolk and the Essex border. They went to Long Melford and Sudbury, noting the \"considerable trade in woollens and silk stuffs.\" In Sudbury itself there is a record of a silk weaving manufactory on the second floor of what is now called Gainsborough's house, facing Weavers Lane by 1791. By 1851 Mr William Hill lived next door with a connecting door to this manufactory. In 1851 he employed 200 men, 400 women and 200 girls and installed a factory bell to summon them to work each day.\n\nIn 2012, Vanners Silk Weavers occupy premises in Weavers Lane, Sudbury, and the firm claims that,\n\n\"After the passing of the Spitalfields Act of 1774, which fixed wage rates in London and abolished the tariffs on imported silks, the firm of Vanners moved its silk yarn processing and weaving operations to Sudbury and Haverhill in the county of Suffolk. The originators of the Company, The Vanners Brothers, were descended from French Huguenots.\"\n\nHowever, the Sudbury Museum Trust website paints a slightly different picture of Vanners entry to Suffolk:\n\n\"Finally there is Vanners Silk which also originated in Spitalfields and made a late move into Suffolk in the 1870s when they opened warehouses in Glemsford (1871) and Haverhill (1874). A merger with Fennell Brothers brought Vanners into Sudbury and their production is now concentrated at their premises in Gregory Street. Much of their output is tie silk produced on computerised looms which have dramatically increased productivity while assuring the highest quality.\"\n\nNevertheless there was silk weaving carried on at Sudbury by a currently unknown master and some old wool weavers had converted to silk probably also at Haverhill and Glemsford at this time.\n\nThe Universal Directory of Britain was published in 1791, covering places in England and Wales. It was published by the patentees of the idea, at the British Directory Office, Ave Maria Lane, London. Volume II contains entries for Bury St Edmunds, and refers to events in 1792, and so must have been published no earlier than this year. It took five volumes in all to complete.\n\nMessrs Buckley and Garnish opened the Capital Brewery in St Andrews Street, through to Guildhall Street based at great expense upon the most modern ideas at the time. They had bought up the once extensive yarn shops of James Oakes and converted them.\n\nThe Universal Directory asserted that the brewery was opened on the 12th April, 1792. \"Mr Buckley was chaired by the populace through the principal streets, and brought to the front of the brewery in St Andrews Street, where he christened the building by the name of the Woolpack Brewery, amidst the shouts of several thousands of spectators assembled on the occasion.\"\n\nBy Autumn of 1792, only a few months after opening, the Capital Brewery of Buckley and Garnish went bust. It was located between Guildhall Street and St Andrews Street, and had before 1790 been Oakes's Yarn Shops. The brand new brewery was sold for Â£2,500 on December 19th, which was reckoned to be Â£500 less than its value, to a Morris of Ampthill for his nephew John Clark. The sale included the Two Brewers in Westgate Street and the Unicorn in Eastgate Street.\n\nIt was to this brewery that Benjamin Greene would come, around 1800, to work for Clark.\n\nIt seems from his diaries that James Oakes considered going into brewing, but he was always cautious in business, and nothing came of it.\n\nThe turnpike act allowing a toll road from Bury to Thetford and Brandon was passed by parliament. As usual, it covered a 21 year concession, so it would expire in 1813. For the last six or seven years there had been attempts to answer complaints about the state of the Bury to Thetford road. It was said that for the last 15 or 30 years tourists had avoided visiting Bury from their Norfolk tours because of this. Nevertheless there were objections to the proposed turnpike, mainly on the grounds of increased local taxes being needed to build it. In August work began to build the turnpike from the Tollgate at Bury, to another gate at Ingham and a further toll house at Elveden.\n\nEleven people appear to have died of Rabies when a number of mad dogs terrorised Bury.\n\nAlso in Bury, Cook Row became known as Abbeygate Street at this time. The Universal Directory, published from 1791 in five volumes, stated that\n\n\"the principal street, commonly called Cook Row, is now, new paved and lighted, after the London method, and the name of Cook Row was, by the consent of the Alderman and a committee appointed for that purpose, at a meeting held the 19th March, 1792, discontinued, and the name Abbeygate Street given to it.\"\n\nThe so-called London method of lighting is not explained, but by an Act of the Common Council of London in 1716, all housekeepers, whose houses faced any street, lane, or passage, were required to hang out, every dark night, one or more lights, to burn from six to eleven o'clock, under the penalty of one shilling as a fine for failing to do so. It may well be that Bury St Edmunds corporation placed such a duty upon the occupiers of homes along Abbeygate Street. Lighting did not become chargeable to the rates until after Improvement Commissioners were appointed for Bury by a Local Act of Parliament in 1811.\n\nGillingwater also commented upon the paving. In Edmund Gillingwater's \"Historical and Descriptive Account of St Edmundsbury\" of 1804, he stated in a footnote on page 164,\n\n\"In the year 1792 the Cook Row, Butter Market, Churchgate Street, Guildhall Street, and many others, were new paved by voluntary subscription.\"\n\nIt was also recorded in the 1791 Directory that the town contains about 1000 houses, which are in general well built. There was \"a spacious Guildhall, where town business is transacted every Thursday, and where the Alderman frequently attends.\"\n\n\"There is a market on Wednesdays and Saturdays. That on Wednesday is principally for corn.\"\n\n\"There are three annual fairs. The first on Easter Tuesday is now of little account. The second in October brought the Norwich company of players to attend for one month only at the elegant theatre above the Market Cross. It is always attended by the nobility etc of this and adjoining counties. The third fair is on the 1st December, very large for cattle, while the two following days are equally large for butter and cheese; the former article the best, and the latter the worst, in England.\"\n\n\"The post for London sets out every evening at seven o'clock, except Saturdays, and returns every morning, except Mondays. The post for Norfolk and the North, sets out every evening, and returns the following morning.\"\n\nCoaches went from the Angel to the Bull at Bishopsgate Street in London every morning at six o'clock, (not Sundays). The Bell had a coach every morning at seven to Newmarket, Cambridge and London, returning the same evening. The Half Moon was the terminus for the coach every Sunday evening, and Wednesday and Friday mornings, to the Spread Eagle in Gracechurch Street, London. It also had a coach every Tueday, Thursday and Saturday mornings at 3 o'clock to Yarmouth. The Six Bells had a coach to the Swan with Two Necks at Lad Lane, London,every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, also apparently at 3 am. A better time was the coach to Norwich on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 9 am.\n\nDiligences, Waggons and Carts were also reported in great detail. In addition, small parcels could be sent to nearly every village within 15 miles of Bury, by three Ipswich Newsmen, called Lockwood, who did the Mildenhall area, Hempstead, who went to Clare, and Brett who travelled to the Wickhambrook area.\n\nLocal people had their own examples of the troubles in France. French emigres were not unusual visitors to Bury St Edmunds. Madame de Genlis and her household were in Bury for 8 or 9 months in 1792, having left France for Bath in October, 1791 where she stayed for just three months before removing to Bury. At first they probably put up for some time in rooms adjacent to the Angel Hotel. A later location for their stay was in what is now 84 Whiting Street, in a house later owned, or leased, by the Duc de Liancourt.\n\nMadame de Genlis was a widely admired writer, particularly on matters concerning childhood, and her work was well known in this country. She had been governess to the children of the Duke of Orleans, who were of the royal line. In leaving France she is said to have brought her pupils with her. Her young ward was Louis Philippe, and he was accompanied by his sister, Princess Adelaide d'Orleans. The story behind this plaque is that Louis-Philippe d'OrlÃ©ans would eventually become France's last king. He took power in 1830 after the July Revolution, but would be forced to abdicate after an uprising in 1848. However, the young Louis Philippe supported the French Revolution in 1791 and had joined the French army in April 1792, aged 19, going to fight in Austria. Together with the army commander, both being appalled by the Terror that now reigned in France, he deserted in April, 1793 and fled to Switzerland. It would seem unlikely for him to have come to Bury St Edmunds with his sister or with Mme de Genlis.\n\nWhen the Duc de Liancourt himself turned up in October, 1792, Mme de Genlis and her party left town, and according to Fanny Burney she did not even wait to pay her debts. The duke appears to have been the same person who had visited Arthur Young back in 1784, but was now known as Francois-Alexandre, Duc de Rochefoucald-Liancourt. He resumed his friendship with Arthur Young, but found England becoming uncomfortable, and he left for America in 1794. Meanwhile the de Genlis party had made their way to Switzerland.\n\nIn Great Yarmouth there were riots in late October , protesting against low wages and high prices. Six men and two women were eventually arrested and tried. One woman was transported for seven years, and the others got jail sentences.\n\nCock fighting and bull-baiting were still practised despite attempts to stop these activities. On November 7th 1792 the Bury Post reported the following incident:\n\n\" The inhuman and barbarous practice of bull-baiting, which has been suppressed by the vigilance of magistracy in most other towns in the kingdom, is still continued here; to the great peril of the peaceable inhabitants, and to the loss and prejudice of the families of the labouring hand.\n\nThis ferocious exercise on Monday last was nearly the cause of loss of life to several individuals, as a girl named Middleditch, about 12 years of age, was tossed by the exasperated animal, and so much hurt, that great apprehensions were entertained for her life: one Burton, a woolcomber, was also most dreadfully and dangerously gored in the thigh; and several other persons were slightly injured, the bull having got loose, and ran through the principal streets of the town, as far as Pakenham, before he was overtaken by his numerous idle pursuers.\"\n\nOne result of this incident was reported by James Oakes in his diary, when the Alderman of Bury called a public meeting in November to discuss the suppression of the \"barbarous Custom of Bull Baiting\". The 50 people present all signed the motion, and it was then taken round the town to collect more signatures.\n\nCharles Guest, an auctioneer had a token showing an arm holding a hammer with the legend \"Going a going\". On the reverse it says \"Payable at Charles Guests Auctioneer Bury\" around a picture of Fame with her trumpet.\n\nThe Ironmonger, James Goers simply stated \"Payable at James Goers Ironmonger Bury\" on one face of his token. The reverse showed the Bury Town coat of arms with the motto \"Success to the Plough & Fleece\", the same as on one of Deck's issues.\n\nThese tokens started life as a substitute for small change, but soon became collectible items of their time. Traders used them to promote the business by giving them to friends and business partners, and while many today are well worn, others have probably never been in circulation.\n\nThese tokens can be seen, together with other local tokens, by clicking here: Eighteenth Century Tokens\n\nOn April 13th James Oakes noted in his diary that there was a rumour that there would be \"an intended riot in our markets next Wednesday.\" Sure enough, on Wednesday, April 29th, at about 10am, the populace seized the butchers' meat, and forced them to sell them off at prices set by the people themselves. Some meat was taken away with no payment. The Justices met at the Guildhall, and swore in 40 additional constables, before marching to the market to read a proclamation of protection for the tradesmen. In the afternoon about 50 gentlemen paraded on horseback to intimidate the protestors. At 7pm about 150 or 200 gentlemen and farmers rode their horses around Bury's streets for an hour. After being stoned by onlookers, they returned to the Guildhall. The magazine of the West Kent militia next came under threat, and a guard of 50 men was placed. The Riot Act was read at 10 pm and the crowds dispersed for the night, leaving 50 West Kent and 20 West Norfolk Militia to guard the Guildhall overnight. The following Wednesday \"The Town perfectly peaceable.\"\n\nOn June 1st, 1795, James Oakes and the other Master Yarn Makers were forced to grant their wool combers a wage rise, but they would only pay an extra penny a pound for combing Super Wool, the finest work. On June 8th the town's bricklayers and their labourers 'all turned out' to demand a raise of fourpence a day. War time price rises were forcing up wage demands.\n\nBy September, James Oakes had given up on the yarn trade and resigned from the Yarn Committee.\n\nOn October 30th the colours of the 4th Troop of the Suffolk Yeomanry Cavalry were presented in the field and consecrated at St James' church. Lord Brome then led the troop on exercises, followed by a dinner at the Assembly Rooms, with loyal toasts and songs \"well adapted to the day.\" The 4th Troop were based on Bury St Edmunds, drawing membership from Thingoe and Thedwastre Hundreds.\n\nHighway robbery was a particular problem at this time. Many people were robbed on the 14 mile stretch from Bury to Newmarket, the main route to London. Oakes joined in the call for armed guards to be put on the mail coaches, but the problem persisted for the next few years.\n\nSince the 1730's the Royal Mail service from Norwich to London had come, first by Post Boys, then in the last few years, by coach, to Bury's Greyhound Inn. This inn was in the Buttermarket, preceding the Suffolk Hotel on the same site. These coaches were the fliers of their time, and reached the Greyhound at nine thirty in the evening, and returned by four thirty next morning. A horn was sounded upon their approach, and fresh horses and mail would be ready as they rode into the yard.\n\nAt this time passengers would usually travel by stage coach to London. In 1795 the Greyhound Inn on the Buttermarket, was home to the \"Marquis of Cornwallis\" coach, setting out three times a week to the Saracens Head in Snow Hill. The Marquis was advertised as \"a new and elegant long coach, being as near as possible, a pattern taken from his Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales's Long Coach.\" This coach would survive into the coming of the railway to Bury in 1846.\n\nInns had a legal obligation to provide hospitality to travellers at any hour of the day or night at this time. They also had to provide billets for soldiers as needed. James Stone, landlord of the Fox in Eastgate Street, was fined the large sum of Â£5 for refusing to take in a drummer of the Londonderry Regiment of Foot. The fees received for billetting soldiers was considered too mean by landlords, particularly in view of the trouble that they could cause. The Fox remains as a large important inn today.\n\nHumphrey Repton completed the decorative and ornamental canal in Culford Park for the Marquis of Cornwallis. The work was supervised by James Taite, who had been head gardener to Sir Charles Kent at Fornham St Genevieve. He had also worked on Livermere park for Nathaniel Lee Acton. James Taite died at Culford Hall in December of 1795.\n\nThe canal or lake at Culford Park was finished off by an iron bridge on the main route into the Park which at this time was from West Stow. As the famous Iron Bridge in Shropshire was only erected in 1775, this would make the bridge at Culford Park the second oldest iron bridge in the country.\n\nIn 1795 the Marquis of Cornwallis finally managed to add West Stow parish to his Culford Estate. He exchanged it with Robert Rushbrooke for part of Little Saxham. At West Stow he added 3,047 acres to his estates, and timber valued at Â£2,800. West Stow made him an annual income of Â£700. He would purchase the adjacent parish of Wordwell in 1799.\n\nRobert Rushbrooke had his own plans to consolidate his estates. Rushbrooke's acquisition of Little Saxham was part of a plan to secure the old hall at Rushbrooke, which had probably belonged to his ancestors. Robert realised that Lord Bristol was heir to the ownership of Rushbrooke Hall, but that Little Saxham was adjacent to the Bristol estate. When Bristol inherited Rushbrooke in 1806, negotiations proceeded and in 1808 it was agreed to exchange Saxham for Rushbrooke. From that time on, Bristol owned much of Little Saxham.\n\nThe Earl Bishop, Frederick Augustus Hervey, Fourth Earl of Bristol, and Bishop of Derry, finally began building his extraordinary new house, the Rotunda at Ickworth. He had pored over plans for three years, never satisfied, and changing his mind often.\n\nHis friend, Arthur Young, of Bradfield Hall, did not understand why the Earl wanted to build at Ickworth. In his letters to Young, he had referred to it as \"the foggy, fenny atmosphere of Ickworth\", preferring the invigorating air of Downhill in Ireland. Young also wrote that the Earl \"would often tell me that he should never be such a fool as to build in so wet a situation.\" It was believed that as the Earl must inherit Rushbrooke, he would wait till that time, and if he built at all, would do it there.\n\n\"This eccentric man built in Ireland a large and very expensive round house, on a plan as singular as himself; and, what was more extraordinary, a repetition of it at Ickworth,\" wrote Young. Young also reported that Lady Bristol \"used to call it a stupendous monument of folly.\"\n\nThe final plan was so ambitious, with 700 feet length on the ground floor, and a central rotunda and dome, that construction was never finished. Work began in 1795, continuing until the Earl Bishop died in 1803. Before work began the Earl left England, and he never saw it again. He refused to set foot back in England till it was finished and furnished with all the goods and artworks he had collected in Italy.\n\nHis son finally re-started building in 1821, eventually moving into the east wing during 1829. The west wing remained empty and unfinished.\n\nSeveral of Spink and Carss banknotes from 1795 survive because they were never cashed. As with the failure of any of these banks, it was not just the shareholders who lost money. Anyone who had accepted their notes, instead of gold or silver coins, was left holding worthless paper following a crash. These became evidence in the subsequent hearing for bankruptcy. Two such notes are held by the Moyse's Hall Museum. The Trustees in Bankruptcy have added the following note to the reverse of these notes, thus: \"At the Angel Inn, Bury St Edmunds 22nd April 1797, Exhibited to us under a Commission of Bankruptcy against Robert Carss. (signed) Capel Lofft, Thos Jas Case(?), indecipherable.\"\n\nOakes's bank now kept going all the better because it continued to pay out cash on demand, and thus survived its rivals' failures. The bank was even given a new name. It became the Bury and Suffolk Bank, and it was to be the sole significant Bury bank for the next four years. It gave up its relationship with Gurneys and indirectly Barclay's bank, and Oakes now used Ayton Brassey and co as his London banker.\n\nAt the same time Oakes's bank became the bankers to the Bury Corporation, taking over a loan of Â£2,350 made to it by Spink some time before 1778.\n\nDespite the experiences of Spink's bank, being a Receiver of Taxes was still thought worthwhile and James Oakes got his son Orbell appointed to the West Division in this same year. In effect the job was handed on from father to son through the influence of the Duke of Grafton.\n\nThe stamp duty levied on every copy of a newspaper sold was raised from two pence to threepence halfpenny. Access to news and comment was looked on as a luxury by the government, and was effectively made too costly for ordinary people to acquire.\n\nArthur Young wrote that the improvement in Suffolk's roads over the previous 20 years was \"almost inconceivable\". Many roads had been diverted to run round the great estates, such as Culford and Ickworth. Arthur Young was born in 1741 at his father's London home, but was soon removed to their country seat at Bradfield Combust and was educated at Lavenham. He wrote extensively on agricultural practices and many of his ideas were widely adopted. He got most of his information about wool manufacture from James Oakes in Bury. He died in 1820.\n\nIn June 1797 Arthur Young's 14 year old daughter, his beloved 'Bobbin', died. Young was angry that he had employed five physicians to help her, but none of them had agreed in their diagnosis or treatments. He now believed that \"that it cost me Â£100 to destroy my child, for I do not think that one shilling was bestowed that did not in one way or other do mischief.\" \"Had she been a pauper in a village she would, I verily think, have been alive and hearty.\"\n\nDespite the passing of the Improvement Act in 1795, the state of the Lark Navigation was still causing concern among the local coal merchants. The Navigation was owned by the Palmer family, and had been allowed to fall into disrepair. Ashley Palmer had died in 1792, leaving his widow Susanna to manage the waterway on her own. By now she was 61 years old. This decay in the river was hindering the deliveries of bulky goods like coal, which could not economically be brought in by road.\n\nThe Irish Act of Union led to rule from London.\n\nIn 1801 Bury was the second town in the county of Suffolk, having a population of 7,655, according to the census. However, some have said that this census figure was probably some five percent underestimated. Bury was run by a closed corporation of 37 members who returned two MP's to Parliament. It was the venue for the county assizes and quarter sessions, as well as petty sessions and other Borough courts, such as the Coroner's court and the court of pie powder, which enforced market bye laws. There were various industries supplying local needs, but the big earners were brewing and malting. The great fortunes made in the last century from yarn making were still mostly intact, although the yarn industry itself was over. It was a prosperous and well situated town, widely known for its social life. Every October, the Bury Fair was nationally known for its social entertainments.\n\nLand enclosure had again been going strong since 1770. Locally there was an enclosure act for Pakenham passed in 1797, while the act for Honington was passed in 1799. These acts established commissioners who had to allot the so-called waste ground and commons among the local landowners, the church, and if applicable, the poor. Carrying out this process could take a year or two before the consequences were felt by local people. In 1801 the enclosure of the green at Honington led Nathaniel Bloomfield to write his poem \"The Elegy on the Enclosure of Honington Green\". He echoed the feelings of the poor when he wrote that:\n\n\"In all seasons the green we loved the most, because on the green we were free\".\n\nHis brother Robert Bloomfield wrote \"The Farmers Boy\".\n\nMeanwhile, a joint enclosure act for Risby and Fornham All Saints was passing through its Parliamentary process in 1801.\n\nIn 1801 Arthur Young of Bradfield Hall was still finding himself under great financial pressure. He neglected his estate to work for the Board of Agriculture as its Secretary. He would rise at 4 am and walk in up to his neck in the garden pond. Then he would work on his reports, or, if away from home, he would be undertaking yet more of his investigations into agricultural practices for the Board. Despite all this he believed that there were moves to remove both the President of the Board and himself, on the pretext that nothing was being achieved. Since the death of his daughter he had spent more and more of his time reading religious books, and considering the state of his soul.\n\nIn June 1801, Young noted that the Duke of Grafton, Lord Euston,\n\n\"is going on a tour of Suffolk, ordering returns to be made of all carts, waggons, horses, mills and ovens; a step preparatory in the expectation of an invasion. But it is in everyone's mouth that with such a price of corn half the country would join the enemy. I must freely confess I dread the result.\"\n\nYoung was angry that nothing was being done to help the poor. His own solution was to give them extra land so that they could feed themselves more effectively. He was sorry\n\n\"to see poor rates at their present enormous height and the poor in misery...when they could have land, and live in ease, while rates could be only 3d or 4d in the pound.\"\n\nAs a member of the Suffolk Corps of Yeomanry, despite his advancing age, Young now went along with a proposal to fine members five shillings if they were absent from any of the meetings on the first Friday of every month. Young knew that his work took him away so often that he was usually absent, but felt that he could not resign while the current state of crisis prevailed in the land.\n\nThe Norman Tower was shown with a cupola on the top, a public clock on its face, and houses built on both sides of it. Access to the West Front homes was therefore through its arch at present day street level. Much of the arch was by now below ground level. This book was re-published in 1843, with some additional plates. One new illustration is of the coat of arms of the Abbey, basically three crowns, which was said to have been displayed over the South Gate. The three crowns were incorporated into the arms of the Borough of Bury St Edmunds and later St Edmundsbury Borough Council.\n\nAccording to a postscript in the book, Yates intended to publish further extensive work on the abbey's history, but this did not happen. The 1843 posthumous edition contained only a fraction of what he had hoped to produce. Yates was an educated man from a well to do family. Yates recorded that his father had lived for 37 years within the abbey precincts, and had fostered his own antiquarian interests. His book was a scholarly work, quoting extensively from medieval documents, with latin extracts. It was large and lavishly produced. In the fashion of the time you could order your own custom binding depending upon your purse. It recorded no history of Bury other than that relating directly to the Abbey. It had a large number of wealthy local gentry on its subscription list, and was aimed at a completely different market than the small popular town history produced earlier by Edmund Gillingwater.\n\nIn 1805 we can trace the real beginnings of the brewers Greene, King and Company, when Benjamin Greene set up a partnership with William Buck to brew and sell beer. Greene had been apprenticed to Whitbread's Brewery in London, in the 1790's and apparently when this was over, he moved to Bury somewhere between 1799 and 1802. He seems to have entered into a 3 year contract as Assistant Brewer at the Capital Brewery of John Clark in St Andrews Street. After this he decided to set up on his own account.\n\nWilliam Buck had been a yarn manufacturer in Bury, like James Oakes, and this business was now moribund. Buck lived in Westgate street opposite to Guildhall Street at number 24, and his yarn works had been nearby. His combing shop and warehouse was turned into a tenement of six houses in 1803 and 1804. Whereas Oakes turned to banking, Buck now turned to brewing. Buck provided capital, business knowledge and a strong local reputation, while Greene provided the brewing know how. Both men were non-conformists, attending the Independent Chapel in Whiting Street. Buck was 60 at the time and it seems that managing the brewery fell mostly to Greene.\n\nThere had been a Brewery in Westgate Street, Bury St Edmunds, throughout the 18th Century, owned by three generations of the Wright family. In 1798 Matthias Wright had decided to sell the Westgate Brewery, together with its Malting House and Public Houses. It did not sell, and for several years had stood empty. Finally in the Winter of 1805, The Buck and Greene partnership took it over, and began slowly to restart the brewing process.\n\nWilliam Buck's daughter Catherine had married Thomas Clarkson in 1795. At first they farmed in the Lake District, becoming friends with the Wordsworths and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 1805 they returned to Bury to live in St Mary's Square. Clarkson was to become a major advocate for the Anti-Slavery movement. This injected a reformist zeal into Bury Society, as well as a poetical one. This was reported in the Diary and Reminiscences of Henry Crabb Robinson of Linnet House in Southgate Street.\n\nJames Oakes presented the corporation with a Mayor's robe and chain. The chain incorporated a gold medallion chased with a profile of King James I, and the arms of the town. The gold chain, made of horse-bit links and chased rosettes, cost Oakes Â£140.\n\nIn 1805 the County Gaol was completed by designer George Byfield in Sicklesmere Road. The new gaol had many innovations, such as water closets, bathrooms in the infirmaries, and adequate washing facilities. In design it was built around an octagonal central building, the home of the Governor and Chapel. The Governor could oversee the whole prison from his house. A Treadmill was incorporated to provide occupation for prisoners who could earn wages to buy clothing and extras. Provision was made also for a place of public execution above the gate in the main street facade. The County no longer needed to keep prisoners in the old gaol on the Cornhill, at the bottom of Woolhall Street. The first Gaol Keeper was John Orridge who would later influence prison design both within the kingdom and abroad.\n\nAt the College Street workhouse in Bury, conditions were not much better than in the town's gaol. In 1805 the philanthropist and prison reformer James Neild visited Bury's workhouse. He found that the building was dirty and badly ventilated. There was no daily table of diet prescribed for the inmates. He also discovered that the twenty-eight children in the workhouse were in a state of nearly total ignorance, although several of them had spent fourteen years of their lives there.\n\nThis picture of Bury Fair was signed by Joseph Clarendon Smith, and dated 1808. Not all of the prints and pictures of early Bury St Edmunds are topographically entirely accurate. The artist would sometimes \"improve\" the scene by omitting unwanted detail. In this picture the cupola on top of the Norman Tower has been omitted, but it was still in place until 1854. Bury Fair would be abolished in 1871.\n\nA system of shutter telegraphs was set up to send messages from the admiralty in London to naval ships in port at Yarmouth. A chain of 18 stations were set up on hills in line of sight which operated 12 shutters abut 3 feet square. A message could be sent to Yarmouth in about 17 minutes by this system. The chain had a station at King's Chair at Newmarket followed by one at Telegraph Road, Icklingham about 10 miles away. The next station was on the Thetford Road at Barnham, about 5Â½ miles distant. The system only lasted until the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1814.\n\nJohn Benjafield was narrowly elected on to the Bury St Edmunds Corporation. He was by now a JP and a Captain in the Militia, but he never got on with James Oakes, who opposed his attempt to become Alderman.\n\nThe non conformist British and Foreign school society was set up to provide schools for poor children. Joseph Lancaster, a Quaker, had published an account of his educational work in 1803 called \"Improvements in education as it respects the industrial classes of the community\". Joseph Lancaster had found that at his 'Lancasterian School' in Southwark one 'teacher' could teach say five boys one item of knowledge in reading, writing or arithmetic. These five boys would teach another five. These would teach five more. In this way education could be provided very economically, and each boy paid just one penny per week. The use of the slate and a slate pencil was a feature of his method, being vastly cheaper than paper, pen and ink. At this time quill pens were still in use, which needed sharpening, and the use of slate was easier for children, and also quicker. Financial difficulties led in 1808 to Lancaster's schools being taken over by a group who formed the Society for Promoting the Royal British or Lancasterian System for the Education of the Poor. This society would be renamed in 1814 as the British and Foreign School Society or BFSS.\n\nIt is not clear when the first Lancasterian schools reached Bury St Edmunds, but there were certainly schools using slate and slate pencils at this time. This is reflected in the comment made by Mr. Thomas Warren in 1809 when introducing his newly engraved slates to the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce who awarded him a gold medal for his invention:\n\n\"The great utility of this article (slates) in instructing the children of the poor, particularly in the art of handwriting, has recently been amply proved in several respectable charity-schools at Bury St. Edmunds, also in many private families\". (SEAMC, 1809, vol. 27)\n\nThe Earl of Bristol had inherited the estate of Rushbrook in 1806, but in 1808 he he exchanged it for the estate of Little Saxham, with Colonel Robert Rushbrook. Colonel Rushbrook had married Frances Davers, the daughter of the last Davers baronet of Rushbrook Hall. Rushbrook now became the seat of the Rushbrook family, and would remain so until 1919.\n\nThe great estate of Ickworth now included Little Saxham, and the site of the long demolished Little Saxham Hall stood within Ickworth Park until about 1930 when the Bristol Estate sold off \"the Saxham end\" into private hands.\n\nThe Red Poll cow is also native to Suffolk. The breed was evolved from a cross between a Norfolk and a Suffolk in the early 1800s. Polled means no horns and Originally the Red Poll was considered a dual purpose breed, good for both milk and beef.\n\nMeanwhile the Suffolk Punch heavy draught horse was being quietly developed in Suffolk and Norfolk. The breed was already old by 1810, and although modern Suffolk Punches are all said to be descended from a stallion called Crisp's horse of Ufford, bred in 1768, the line was probably much older than this. Ufford is just north of Woodbridge.\n\nJohn Webb's poem, \"Haverhill\", was published. He later became famous as the 'Haverhill poet'. He wrote that he realised 100 guineas from its publication. William Wordsworth was said to have admired this poem and commented that he had never made so much money from his work. John Webb's patron was the Reverend Marryweather, who procured a number of \"respectable subscribers\" to finance publication of the poem. Webb recorded in his diary that shortly after its publication, \"Sir George Beaumont called upon me and told me it did me credit and that Wordsworth, the poet, read \"Haverhill\" through at his house and approved of it\".\n\nIn 1810, James Oakes was elected Alderman for the town of Bury. At this time it was the practice for each of the Capital Burgesses to be elected Alderman in turn. The events of 1810 were the subject of comments in the Report of the Commission on Municipal Corporations in England and Wales, which examined the state of Bury Corporation in 1833. The Commissioners wrote in their report on Bury, as follows:\n\n\"the only departures from this practice have originated in party feuds, not occasioned by any difference of political opinion or public principle, but by an attempt on the part of two influential members and their respective friends, to gain an ascendancy in the corporation. Each party strove, by excluding from office the friends of the other, to secure to itself the advantages accrueing from those public privileges...... In 1810, while this struggle was going on, the capital burgesses absented themselves from the elective assembly, and the election of an Alderman did not take place till a manadamus issued from the Court of King's Bench.\"\n\nThis battle was between the friends of James Oakes, and the followers of John Benjafield, Reuben Sturgeon and Charles Peck. On August 23rd, the Thursday before the Feast of St Bartholomew, the corporation met as usual to elect the Alderman for the coming year. Of the 37 members of the Corporation, 18 were absent, thus preventing the meeting having a quorum, so that no vote could take place. The same thing happened next day, when they tried to carry on. Clearly this was a ploy. The members who turned up to vote took dinner in the Angel on both days, while those who absented themselves dined just as richly at the Six Bells on Chequers Square, an easy stone's throw away.\n\nIn October the corporation tried to have Benjafield and Company excluded from office, but came to no conclusion. Following the writ of mandamus, most of the missing members turned up, so that on November 22nd, with only 2 members absent, Oakes was finally elected.\n\nPlans to move the Bury Assizes to Ipswich and an attempt by county magistrates to extend their jurisdiction into the Borough were both defeated by James Oakes and the Bury corporation.\n\nTokens reappeared in 1811, some silver as well as copper. This one was issued payable at Hunton's in Yarmouth and at Blyth and Co, Bury, and is dated 1811. The reverse includes the legend \"Norfolk and Suffolk Token One Shilling\". These silver tokens would be suppressed by about 1816 when George III had his last recoinage, or as it was to be called, the \"new coinage\".\n\nFollowing a council meeting in 1809, an Act of Parliament had been obtained to establish Paving and Improvement Commissioners for the town of Bury St Edmunds. The new Commissioners came into being on 4th April, 1811. The Act detailed the first 24 Commissioners by name, mostly drawn from the Corporation. The Act enabled the Commissioners to appoint staff, seek loans, and levy and collect rates from the properties in the town.\n\nThe Act also contained details of their form of management. The Commissioners were to meet in the Guildhall on the first Monday in each month, and extra meetings could be called as required. Vacancies were to be advertised in June each year, with notices posted on the Church doors, announcements made after Divine Service and notices posted on other doors of important buildings. A public meeting was to be held in the Guildhall on a day specified in the Act, and any vacancies required to restore their total number up to 24 were to be elected by the meeting. Whilst this appeared to be a democratic system, the drawback was that any new Commissioners had to agree to make a loan of Â£100 to the Commissioners. This requirement ruled out anybody who was not already numbered amongst the 'great and the good' of Bury St Edmunds.\n\nHowever, their operations were to be limited to the built up area of the town, roughly within the area of the old town gates. They could borrow a limited amount of money and levy a rate to improve the paving, lighting and drainage of the town and provide piped water supplies. They operated alongside the Corporation and would eventually make substantial progress in sewering the town.\n\nA Town Clerk was appointed immediately, followed by a Treasurer, Surveyor and Rate Collector. Rates were to be reviewed each year. Both James and Orbell Oakes were appointed as Commissioners and James Oakes was made Treasurer. A further Act would be obtained in 1820 to extend their powers. The Commissioners would operate until 1873, when the corporation were given their responsibilities.\n\nOne of the first acts of the Paving Commissioners was to let a contract for street lighting. A two year contract for 300 oil lamps for street lighting, together with their upkeep and maintenance, was considered a priority.\n\nIt was still the case that when it rained, streams of water ran down the streets, and ditches were necessary to carry this away in an orderly manner. In July, 1811, Bury St Edmunds Improvement Commissioners invited tenders for the provision of of an \"under drain\" to replace the ditch in Churchgate Street. They also discussed a similar project for Abbeygate Street, but postponed the decision on this street. At some point the Abbeygate street underdrain was approved, probably soon afterwards. It is unclear where these drains discharged their contents, but another drainage ditch seems to have run along the foot of Angel Hill, down Mustow Street and into the river at Eastgate Bridge. As money became available, many of these ditches would be replaced by underdrains.\n\nAlong with street improvements, 1811 saw the start of a rapid period of growth in Bury, particularly up to 1821.\n\nThe Guildhall Feoffees built the almshouses in Long Row, Southgate Street, in Bury. The builders were W Steggles of Bury and this is one of their earliest buildings but the firm went on to develop or re-develop large areas of the town. The business ran from the site of Model Junction in Whiting Street."
