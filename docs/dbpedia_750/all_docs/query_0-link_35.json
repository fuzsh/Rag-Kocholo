        "text": "Description\n\nEarl of Bothwell and Duke of Orkney (c. 1534 â€“ 14 April 1578). 3rd husband of Mary Queen of Scots. He married her after the death of her husband Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, whom he was widely suspected of having murdered. The marriage destabilized the faction-ridden country, and both Mary and Bothwell fled, never to see each other again. Hepburn fled to Norway where he was sued for mistreatment and bigamy by his first wife, Anna Tronds and ended up dying in prison.\n\nJames Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell in Wikipedia\n\nThis is a general description. It is not a review."
