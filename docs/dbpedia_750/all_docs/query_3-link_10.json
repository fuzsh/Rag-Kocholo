        "text": "An elegant structure stands in Michigan City. It’s been there since before our grandparents were born and it’s filled with a rich and wonderful history that would make any Michigan City resident proud and nostalgic. It started with the Barker family, and remains -the Barker Mansion.\n\nJohn H. Barker didn’t know that he would leave such a legacy to the citizens of Michigan City. A wealthy industrialist and native of Michigan City (thanks to his father who settled in Michigan City in 1836), Barker was the creator of the Haskell & Barker Railroad Car Company. This railroad would contribute to Michigan City’s prosperity as the years went by and in 1922 it merged with the Pullman Company. Today the company is still running and it’s under a different name, Pullman-Standard.\n\nIn 1857, Barker built a large home for his family that we all know as Barker Mansion. This 3-story, 38-room structure had the design touches of Chicago architect Frederick Perkins and in 1905 the mansion was complete. Unfortunately, Barker and his wife only enjoyed the house for a short while as they passed away a few years after its completion. Barker’s daughter, Catherine Barker Hilcox, upheld the family’s legacy of philanthropy and of shaping the city. She utilized the wealth that she was born into donating much to charity and opened up the mansion to the public. If you look around Michigan City at notable structures, you will see the giving nature of the Barkers. John Barker donated funds to bring organizations like the YMCA, Trinity Episcopal Church, the Michigan City Library, and (what was then) St. Anthony Hospital, to life. The mansion itself was the home of Purdue University North Central from 1948 to 1968, and then it was opened as a historic monument that has been serving Michigan City ever since.\n\n“It really tells the story of Michigan City. Starting from the time this was a frontier town when it became an industrial town,” Jessica Rosier, Director of the Barker Mansion said. “It tells the story of the Barkers; it’s a very important part of this city.”\n\nRight the mansion’s contents are over 90% originals.\n\n“All original things were in storage so we put it back together based on photos that we had,” Rosier said. “The mansion is so gorgeous it doesn’t need extra decorations.”\n\nNow the mansion is open for tours and special events. Weddings can be held there in the drawing room or in the formal gardens, Clue can be played with students, and new additions include additional tours directed toward men and First Fridays.\n\n“We’ll be taking the men on a flashlight-guided tour of rooms that you don’t normally see. It’s the Nuts and Bolts Tour. For First Fridays we will display our original artwork of the mansion, serve a special Barker Mansion tea blend and Victorian cookies,” Rosier said. “We’ll use recipes from the Victorian cookbooks in the mansion.”"
