These paintings, along with the others which I havegathered together for this publication, are all notable for their distinguished provenances. Asportraits, whilst clearly tangible manifestations of lives and fashions long past, their significancehowever transcends the purely representational; for they also stand witness to the history of thegreat country houses which they adorned, the notable collections of which they formed a part,and of course to the often colourful lives and times of their former owners."
