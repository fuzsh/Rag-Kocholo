        "text": "Originating Kindred Britain\n\n- E. M. Forster\n\nOrigins\n\nIn the beginning were the murders. Kindred Britain, a digital humanities project about the family in British history, was born in the distant aftermath of a set of domestic murders and a suicide. First came the deeds. Then, much later, came the words and the connections.\n\nIn early 1908, my great-great grandfather, Frederick Holmes, was a businessman living with his family in the hamlet of Fawley in Buckinghamshire, by the gentle meanderings of the River Thames. It was Wind in the Willows country. A brewer, Frederick had made and lost a great deal of money and, by the middle of the first decade of the 20th century, he had also become ill with a series of grim but unspecified ailments. His eyes were failing, he kept losing his balance, he had ‘gastric pains’. The family kept up appearances but their world was under pressure. He still tramped the fields with friends, shooting at creatures. But he had been forced to sell his last horse. Then, one night in February 1908, Frederick got up in the darkness of his bedroom, loaded his Webley revolver and shot my great-great grandmother Florence where she slept. He then moved down the corridor and shot their sleeping daughter Winifred. Afterwards, he climbed to the attic and murdered the young servants Lizzie Hayes and Ethel Morris. Frederick returned to his bedroom and, next to his wifeâs corpse, reloaded his revolver before moving downstairs and out into the English countryside. A white, winter sun must have been coming up, there must have been heavy dew on the ground, birds must have been singing. He wandered around for several hours in who knows what agony of spirit before taking the gentlemanâs (or the madmanâs) way out and turning the gun on himself. A newspaper reported that Frederickâs body was found later ‘lying face downwards among the long grass and weeds. Blood was on the grass, near at hand was the weapon, and a brief examination showed that he had shot himself through the heart.’\n\nOver time, that corpse became the skeleton in the family closet: never mentioned, let alone discussed. It was a loud silence, like the moment after a bang, in the background to everything. But, by accident, in 2007 I found out about the deeds that this enigmatic, deeply disturbed relative had carried out. It was hard to know how to react, how to feel: the story seemed about something far off and yet very close. Perplexed, I tried to piece the facts together in a blog entry called ‘The Events at Henley’. But I could offer no explanation and, even though the inquest was reported in the Times, some of the basic details were hard to establish. I thought it would end there: let the dead bury their dead. Not long afterwards, though, I received an email from Anthony Andrews. A retired British army officer, Anthony specialized in genealogical research, a subject I then knew nothing about, but which I have since learned constitutes one of the largest communities of investigators on the Internet. Genealogical sites on the Internet such as Ancestry.com are now so large that they advertise for customers on old-style media like television.\n\nAnthony generously offered to help me find out more about my family background. We puttered around a little bit, dug up the names of a few vicars and spinsters, and were on the point of wishing each other farewell. But Anthony seemed to be lingering, as if he was waiting for something. I am a poetry critic and had for years been involved with the study of the 20th century poet, W. H. Auden. Not knowing quite what else to say, I asked Anthony if he could also just tell me a bit about Audenâs family history, a subject I knew had been little researched. The results were interesting. Audenâs father, although a solidly prosperous Edwardian doctor and public health official, came from a relatively modest background of Staffordshire farmers about whom very little is easily known. By contrast, Audenâs mother, Constance Bicknell, was extremely self-conscious and voluble, not to say snobbish, on the subject of her familyâs noble roots. She even claimed to be a direct descendent of John of Gaunt. Anthony and I soon discovered that, incredibly enough, Mrs. Auden was almost right: a lineal ancestor was Thomas of Woodstock, John of Gauntâs brother.\n\nIt was odd to realize that in Audenâs poem ‘O Love the interest itself in thoughtless heaven’, when he quoted part of John of Gauntâs famous ‘this scepterâd isle’ speech from Shakespeareâs Richard II, he was citing a distant relative. But, over time, this came to seem less odd than eerily predictable. With Anthonyâs help, the more I connected Constance Bicknell genealogically to an array of famous ancestors, the more I saw that many of these people could also be connected to one another without the mediation of Constance Bicknell. I began to grasp dimly the existence of a vast network of connections. And the more people I linked into this genealogical network, the more I saw that many other luminaries and well-known figures in British history could be fused into the structure I was uncovering. The idea reminded me of watching a magician who keeps pulling more and more knotted handkerchiefs out of his mouth till the fabric seems to be flowing on and on like an impossible, endless river of silk.\n\nThe more individuals and families I connected the more seemed to offer themselves for connection. But I was connecting people without, so to speak, putting two and two together. As is often the case with research projects in their initial stages, I had no real idea what I was doing. I was just doing it. It was not even my field: this was a historical project being undertaken by a non-historian. Regardless, a database was accreting. Eventually I would come to call it Kindred Britain. In the end, I put nearly 30,000 people from more than 12 centuries into this huge family web, observing the iron law of inclusion that in order for an individual to enter the network that person must have a familial tie — that is, a tie of lineage, siblinghood or marriage — to someone who was already a node in the network. The coral reef grew only when polyps attached themselves to the existing structure.\n\nInitially, my mind linked the onset of the Kindred Britain project with the fortunate coincidence of my getting to know Anthony Andrews by email and being inducted by him at long distance into the world of genealogical research. (In time, Anthony and I exchanged many thousands of emails, though we never met.) But, as I now realize, I only got to know Anthony a result of something that was deeper and prior. The true point of origination for Kindred Britain was my learning about those murders in Fawley in 1908. In the foundations of the project, at least in my mind, are those bodies in the bedrooms, that man lying in the grass next to his revolver. And the case Kindred Britain makes about the inbreeding and familial interconnectedness of so much of what counts for British history and culture? That too has something to do with misalliances, with bodies, with silences, with blood.\n\nFamily Records\n\nFamily — it is an inescapable, core subject, a context for being in the world that everyone can relate to through understanding and through memory. For better and for worse, family life has become a bedrock component of modern experience. From Goyaâs The Family of Charles IV and Picassoâs The Family of Saltimbanques to Dickensâs Our Mutual Friend and Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, family has been a primary source of subject matter for works of art and literature. The theme is so primal and pervasive that it has functioned as a well of metaphors for spheres of intellectual inquiry as different as institutional life and protein groups. Countless millions have lived largely without friends. Almost no-one has ever lived without some kind of family structure, even if, in some cases, that ‘family’ was more a pragmatic or ad-hoc assemblage than a legally-sanctioned entity.\n\nWhat ‘family’ has meant varies widely across time and cultures, for example connoting at different moments a set of household servants, a military staff, a group of people living under one roof and (its most familiar contemporary sense) a bounded social-biological unit of parents and children. The ubiquity of the experience of being a family member has produced huge varieties of response to the familial matrix. Integral parts of the narrative of modern culture have been precisely about breaking away from family or about demystifying its function. In a famous passage near the start of The Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels claimed that ‘The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.’ But their word ‘relation’ seems to sustain the metaphoric hold of familyness even as the myth of the family itself, the authors assert, has been destroyed. Such is the eerie resilience of ‘family’ in the imagination that the term ‘relation’, which Marx and Engels intend to use simply in the sense of a social positioning or connection between people, retains the more specific, familiar meaning of a blood or marriage tie: ‘All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify.’ Some social theorists believe that we are on the brink of a post-familial era, but, as a practical matter, family relations persist: not unchanged but unvanishing. The family is fundamentally a conservative institution in human culture and part of what it conserves is itself. As a human grouping it remains astonishingly durable. ‘I hate the Family,’ George Bernard Shaw said in a lecture in 1886. ‘I loathe the Family. I entirely detest and abominate the Family as the quintessence of Tyranny, Sentimentality, Inefficiency, Hypocrisy, and Humbug’ (‘Socialism and the Family’). Shaw married in 1898 and in later years he retrenched in his hostility: ‘If you cannot get rid of the family skeleton, you may as well make it dance.’ Kindred Britain is neither for nor against the family in a moralistic sense: it is built on a simple, documentary belief in the centrality of family experience to the formation of British culture.\n\nMost European cultures have been obsessed with noble families. (The excitement over the birth of the baby third in line to the throne has shown this is as true today in Britain as it was in the past.) The Almanach de Gotha, detailing the upper echelons of Europeâs courts and dynasties, was an annual publication between 1785 and 1944. New editions of Burkeâs Peerage appeared at rapid intervals between 1826 and 1940 (and less frequently afterwards). These heavy, double-columned, black-lettered tomes were surely among the thickest books ever printed as well as, of course, being imbued with patriarchal ideology in its purest and most transparent form. Such volumes focused primarily on tracing dynastic lines stretching back into remote history rather than on including much about lines of relation extending laterally across time (as Kindred Britain does). Ancestors were more important than in-laws. But the familial obsession was not exclusively an aristocratic affair. Landed gentry and even the bourgeoisie emulated the self-aggrandizing record keeping of societyâs highest echelons.\n\nUnlike some popular genealogical websites, Kindred Britain does not aim to replicate Burkeâs Peerage, but to do something different. This site covers a much wider social spectrum, there is no privileging here of ancestral lines over family connections made through marriage, it tries to treat sons and daughters as even-handedly as possible and where feasible it expands what can count as family beyond traditional legal definitions. (I will return to the last topic in the final section of this essay.) What can be achieved, though, is subject to a number of significant constraints. There is a vast discrepancy in what can be known about the lives, and even the identities, of people from different social classes in history. Much of the past has simply fallen from view, leaving gaps and holes, like those on a crumbled fresco. This basic characteristic of the historical record is one of the main factors structuring the uneven and irregular nature of the Kindred Britain database. Most of humanity through most of history has not just died but has also evanesced without trace. That problematic unevenness of visibility, created by class privileges, is compounded by the cultureâs gradually accelerating compulsion to record and archive, often for the purpose of governmental control. So the historical record, extremely sparse for earlier periods, slowly gets thicker, more extensive and more particularized over time. This is a second factor in the fluctuating levels of detail in the database. These are both limits imposed by historical circumstances; the researcher has to acquiesce in the unavoidable constraints imposed by reality.\n\nBut the other main factors shaping the nature of the Kindred Britain database, about which specialist historians will doubtless complain, are the results of decisions about focus and scope. If all historical records of family are inevitably imperfect, I hope Kindred Britain turns that intrinsic incompleteness into an advantage. Kindred Britain is selective by design. Perhaps the site acts a little like a thermal camera. Such tools, designed to detect infrared waves, generate an image of the world similar to but different from the usual images of reality produced by cameras that detect visible light. The heat-sensitive camera tells a distinctive kind of truth, recognizable, even revelatory, but initially strange. It reveals what is hidden from the conventional lens. An object looks red or brown and has lettering on it in a conventional photograph. It shows a book. There is no way to tell whether the book has been lying in the midday sun or not. In an image of the book generated with a thermal camera, all we can know about the same object is its general shape and, vividly, its temperature. Neither image is true or untrue; neither cancels out the validity of the other. Like any conceptual focus, the picture in the lens of Kindred Britain foregrounds, clarifies and occludes.\n\nKindred Britainâs version of infrared is the wavelength of family relationships. It isolates and emphasizes family relations to produce a distinctive, bounded image of a lost world, an image in which a society normally segregated by class or money or technology or ideology or expertise or geographic locality is bound together by family ties. To stand alongside other images of Britain, the truth that Kindred Britain prioritizes is this worldâs intensely familial nature.\n\nLastly, my interest has been in establishing as comprehensive and detailed a picture as I could manage, not in presenting the granular details of one or two families through time, which is the traditional genealogical mode. Rather, the effort has been primarily to trace connections between a large number of figures of general cultural, historical or scientific significance. If ‘distant reading’ of novels is one popular mode encouraged by the evolving field of digital humanities, then Kindred Britain can be understood as an effort in âdistant mappingâ. I was trying to map at the scale of the county, perhaps even the nation, not at the scale of the parish. Or, to put it another way, it was not the individual pixels that mattered to me so much as the totality of the image captured.\n\nFor that reason, I did not focus on recording every last unmarried parson brother or dutifully meek, married sister from every family I took note of. Instead I actively curated my database, powered by the conviction that compiling something exhaustive (and exhausting) is not the same as creating something illuminating. Adapting a method more like the mode of the novel than the social science, statistic-heavy textbook, I foregrounded what I, as a scholar, sensed was interesting, revelatory or necessary. In doing so, I found happening in Kindred Britain what occurs to some of the minor characters in a panoramic novel like Middlemarch. Some family members took up disproportionate amounts of space. Others were thrown into the shadows or edged to the blurry margins, as inessential to construction of the ‘plot’. And the plot, in Kindred Britainâs case, was to make wide-ranging connections across what George Eliot, the author of Middlemarch, called ‘the great web’ of society.\n\nProjects, like people, are creatures of their own time. Thinking in terms of links is, obviously, a contemporary preoccupation. In the age of Facebook and LinkedIn, connections, networks and webs are concepts that have become numinous to us. Indeed, in a very direct sense, Kindred Britain can be described as a social network. Facebookâs aim is to ‘make the [contemporary] world more open and connected’. Kindred Britain tries to make a small corner of the historical world more visible and connected. One of the mottoes of this site is E. M. Forster's equivocal but still subtly ambitious epigraph to Howards End: ‘Only connectâ¦’. The product of a particular moment, Kindred Britain is about connections, family connections. And that focus determined everything.\n\nPanoramas\n\nKindred Britain creates a family network embracing Jane Austen, Shakespeare, Nelson and Thomas More, along with a gallery of pirates, bankers, diarists, sculptors, photographers, secretaries and engineers. Every prime minister between Robert Walpole and Herbert Asquith is present. (And thus all of Britainâs prime ministers for this period are shown, possibly for the first time, to be connected by family ties.) Kindred Britain links the mad king George III and Henry Paget, the dare-devil aristocrat who lost a leg to grapeshot in the kingâs service at Waterloo. It links antagonists such as Thomas More and Henry VIII or Oliver Cromwell and Charles I. It shows a family relation between the painters Van Dyck and Lucian Freud, separated by centuries but united through an obscure family connection as well as by their commitment to art. It unites the poets John Donne and Mina Loy, the literary dissidents John Milton and George Bernard Shaw, the novelists Jane Austen and George Eliot and the scientists Isaac Newton and J. C. Maxwell. The actor Kevin Bacon, famous not only for his talent but also for becoming the focus of the concept of a person standing at a ‘few degrees of separation’ from various well-known figures (or they to him), is here shown to be at various degrees of familial separation from around 30,000 other people, including the politician George Washington, Napoleon, the actress Olivia de Havilland and King Alfred the Great. On Kindred Britain you can see the degrees of family separation between Kevin Bacon and the great Renaissance author Francis Bacon. And of course everyone mentioned in this paragraph is connected by a family relationship to all the other historical figures mentioned in this essay.\n\nIt would be wrong to consider these familial ‘paths’ between the illustrious or the famous as being simply about two marquee names. A path, as the term implies in the more familiar ambulatory context, is not just about a beginning and an end. The path gains its character from what lies between those points as much as from the starting and finishing points (or nodes) themselves. The route is not so much from A to B as from A to Z and therefore including all the letters in between. One significant interest of Kindred Britainâs path-finding function lies, then, as much in the unexceptional but often quirky or tragic interstitial figures that the paths throw into temporary prominence. They are like the faces in the crowd of one of the giant panoramic paintings by the Victorian artist W. P. Frith.\n\nFor example, my own favourites among these faces in the crowd, momentarily spotlit, include Frances Teresa Stuart, ‘la belle Stuart’, who in the 1660s served as the model for Jan Roettier's figure Britannia, the ultimate icon of Empire, and Sir Charles Isham, the man who is thought to have introduced gnomes into English gardens in the 19th century. The site is a panorama of life (or lives), full of pathos and not a simple catalogue of triumphs and achievements alone but also of dwindling hopes, lurches of fortune and mismatched ambitions. Indeed, you could think of it as a type of Trollope-like, multi-generational novel in the form of a database. The achievements of one generation are engulfed in the tragedies of another. There are, for instance, the sad endings of the descendants of Victorian ‘luminaries’ such as Darwin, Dickens and Tennyson. One of Charles Darwinâs grandsons, Erasmus Darwin, was killed in Belgium in 1915. Cedric Dickens, grandson of Charles Dickens, died at the Somme in 1916. And two of Tennysonâs grandsons died in the same conflict: Harold Tennyson, drowned when his ship HMS Viking struck a mine in the English Channel in 1916 and Aubrey Tennyson, killed in action in France in 1918.\n\nAnd Kindred Britain also shows you now utterly forgotten figures who somehow seem to acquire significance from the very fact of their being brought back for a moment out of the deepest shadows. There is the 11 year-old boy, Hon. Henry Parker, who in a Parisian hotel in 1817 choked to death on a single grain of rye in front of his horrified parents. And then there are the victims of nature or humanity: Dorothea de St. Michel who died of the plague in London on Christmas Eve, 1664; William Godwin, the son of the philosopher William Godwin, who died of cholera in London in 1832; the landowner Thomas Thynne, murdered in 1682 by assassins dispatched by a rival; Rev. John Coleridge Patteson (a distant relative of the poet Coleridge), murdered by Solomon Islanders in 1871; Anne Meinertzhagen who died in 1928 when a gun her husband was holding ‘accidentally’ triggered. These poignant ‘minor characters’ in the book of life are part of what give human colour to Kindred Britainâs network.\n\nIt is important to understand that Kindred Britain is not a biographical site. For the most part, there is relatively little detail on the events and achievements of the people included here. This is not because such things do not matter but because, in the case of well-known figures, these details are widely and easily available elsewhere. Kindred Britain tries to do something different: not to isolate and exalt the eminent, but instead to embed and situate them within a network of relations. Context is all. That is why, when you search for an individual, you will find that individual and their family. When you find Jane Austen, you will see her in the setting of the admirals and clerics who were her brothers and you will probably notice that the women in Austenâs family were outnumbered by the men. Some might argue that these circumstances are what made the subject matter of her novels and that it is right read her art in terms of her family life. Kindred Britain does not take sides. But it suggests that another possibility is to read her life and her familyâs predicaments and milieux in terms of her art. Similarly, Kindred Britain allows you to contemplate the family of Charles Darwin and his siblings with the links in their recent family history to the worlds of the arts, poetry and commerce. And you can ponder such connections in relation to the deeply trope-bound nature of Darwinâs scientific texts, where metaphors such as ‘the Tree of Life’ and the ‘Family of Man’ are of crucial importance. What can one make of this? Kindred Britain is here to prompt questions.\n\nIt is hard to contemplate the image of the world crystallized by Kindred Britain without noticing the vastly greater sense of continuity of family life in the past. Following a particular family through multiple generations, as the site allows you to do, shows that — to a degree which will seem extraordinary to most contemporary sensibilities — families persisted in their places of living, as if they were locked to the soil. You see that there were very limited options for careers for men, and that marriage or spinsterhood were the only choices (if they were choices) for women. And you recognize that most people of the people in this network would have expected to be buried near or next to their parents, grandparents and remoter ancestors.\n\nThere is of course social mobility visible in Kindred Britain, but it feels much more the exception than the rule. Among the exceptions are families that transcended disaster. In the mid-18th century Edmund Sheehy was an Irishman sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered for his part in a murder and for being a member of the Whiteboys gang. In spite of the social ignominy and personal squalor of his death in an obscure corner of Ireland, among his grand-daughters were Ellen Power, who became the wife of Viscount Canterbury, speaker of the House of Commons (and son of another Archbishop of Canterbury) and Margaret Power, Countess of Blessington, novelist and lover of the fashionable dandy, le comte d'Orsay.\n\nAnalogously, there are instances of modest or ‘obscure’ origins transformed into social splendour. Richard Payne Knight, aesthete, theorist of picturesque, and author of a risquÃ© book on the worship of Priapus, was the grandson of the tough-minded industrialist Richard Knight. Payne Knight inherited a massive fortune from the Knight dynasty of iron masters and, using industrial money to pursue his interest in the chivalric mode, built the Gothic revival pile of Downton Castle in Herefordshire on a mediaevalist model. Or, to take another example from the database, the granddaughter of Joseph Severn, the motley painter who was the poet John Keatsâs last companion as he lay dying in despair in Rome, married F. E. Smith, Lord Chancellor of England.\n\nBut such dramatic changes of family fortune or social position seem relatively rare. Freud wrote that ‘Anatomy is destiny.’ It is only slightly less absolute to say that for most of history, perhaps even today, ‘Family is destiny.’ For many people, family life was confiningly dynastic. Even for those younger sons in the upper and upper-middle classes, the possibilities of change and choice were minuscule. George Orwell remembered that ‘Small boys used to count the plum stones on their plates and foretell their destiny by chanting, âArmy, Navy, Church, Medicine, Lawâ’ (The Road to Wigan Pier).\n\nThe business and artistic (and occasionally scientific) dynasties on view in Kindred Britain were one consequence of this rigid world. Families trained their children to follow in the steps of the parents, marshalling expertise and precious resources and often keeping trade secrets to themselves. For many children, there was a closed circle of expectation and desire. Those ancient signs were quite common still in the Britain I grew up in, where the names of businesses often included the designations ‘Bros’ (for ‘brothers’) and ‘& Sons’. Examples of these family dynasties in Kindred Britain include the Brunel family of engineers, the Mushet family of minters and miners, the Kemble/Siddons family of actors, the Lupino family of dancers, vaudevillians and actors, the Burney family of musicians and the great Wedgwood family of ceramicists. In addition there were numerous dynasties of bankers such as the Barings. There was the Stevenson family of several generations of lighthouse builders (seven members of whom were members of both the Institution of Civil Engineers and fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh), from whom the writer and poet Robert Louis Stevenson, like a distinguished fluke, sprang:\n\nIn the afternoon of time\n\nA strenuous family dusted from its hands\n\nThe sand of granite, and beholding far\n\nAlong the sounding coast its pyramids\n\nAnd tall memorials catch the dying sun,\n\nSmiled well content.\n\nThe Darwins and Huxleys through multiple generations have been involved with science. There are dynasties of philanthropists, such as the Quaker family of the Tukes, for example, running from William Tuke, 18th century founder of The Retreat, a Quaker asylum in York run on the lines of ‘moral treatment’, through to his great grandsons James Hack Tuke and Daniel Hack Tuke. There were military dynasties, grandiose sometimes, but also often relatively humble, like that of the Bellairs brothers: Henry Bellairs, who took part in the Battle of Trafalgar under Nelson, and William Bellairs fought at Waterloo under Wellington. And politics, of course, has also been a family business in Britain through the centuries, as this site shows. (Click on ‘Prime Ministers’ in the ‘People’ dropdown to explore how closely related the countryâs leading politicians have been to each other.)\n\nOccupation and family, like family and place, have been deeply bound together in the historical world represented by Kindred Britain. If you browse through the site, you will come across many other instances in which the army, the navy, the church and medicine claimed one or more sons from every generation. There were the generations of clockmakers, pamphleteers, singers, shipbuilders and painters. And always, always there were the lawyers.\n\nThere are intellectual dynasties too. Perhaps the most famous essay on British family history is Noel Annanâs essay ‘The Intellectual Aristocracy’, first published in 1955 in a Festschrift for the historian G. M. Trevelyan. In the piece, Annan argued that British intellectual life of the last two centuries was characterized by an evangelical fervor and moral earnestness that he traced to the abolitionist movement. And in the point that made his meditations particularly influential, Annan asserted that there was an extraordinarily dense network of family interconnection, created by ‘persistent endogamy’, between influential figures in British culture. Annanâs essay mentions some 816 individuals, connecting them as part of the network that forms his ‘intellectual aristocracy’ — 813 of these figures from Annan Kindred Britain identifies and integrates.\n\nIn spite of much well-earned criticism, ‘The Intellectual Aristocracy’ has enjoyed remarkable currency amongst social historians for well over half-a-century now: it is probably the single most frequently cited or alluded to historical essay written in the last 100 years. The main reason for the success of the essay lies in the simplicity of the idea at the essayâs heart. Annanâs essay hits powerfully on a core truth, a truth that is also at the center of Kindred Britain: whether actually or metaphorically, family connections in politics, in art, in the military, in science and in business have played a profoundly, and perhaps uniquely, influential role in the shaping of British culture.\n\nSmall Worlds\n\nThe varieties of people that I described in the last section of this essay demonstrate that one of the outcomes of the research and format of Kindred Britain is a proliferation of local narratives and local details. At the time of writing, there are records for roughly 29,937 people in the Kindred Britain database. (There are 14,980 males and 14,957 females.) That means there are some 897 million different paths around the Kindred Britain network. This constitutes, in practical terms, an almost infinite number of stories and connections. But the multitude of angles of approach that a user can take to the siteâs material is balanced by a central idea underlying and animating the entire work: the formative power of family ties in the development of British culture.\n\nTo think of families as tying people together into a social network is not to take a perspective that comes from outside historical, literary or artistic perspectives. Perhaps the only word that resonates through the Jane Austen corpus with quite the same force as ‘daughter’ is ‘connection.’ Connection can mean many things in Austen but it usually relates to family relationships and to the ties between families. In fact, Austenâs work often closely aligns ‘daughter’ and âconnectionâ. For example, in Pride and Prejudice, at the Netherfield ball early in the novel, Mrs. Bennet gloats to Lady Lucas over her expectation that her oldest daughter will marry the eligible Mr. Bingley. Jane Bennet overhears her mother and is appalled by the older womanâs crudity and pragmatism.\n\nIt was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men. (ch. 18)\n\nMrs. Bennet thinks of the marriage as forming a ‘connection’ that she hopes will, as happens in any network when a new linkage is made by an edge joining two formerly separate nodes, alter the network. She conceives of society as a network: the advantages of following her cue are considerable because from there it is only another step to the contemporary science of networks.\n\nThe topic of the profound interconnectedness of humanity in the modern world had been broached by Hungarian author Frigyes Karinthy in his story ‘Chains’ in 1929. Researchers Manfred Kochen and Ithiel de Sola Pool worked on a theory of ‘small worlds’ at MIT in the 1950s. But it was Harvard social psychologist Stanley Milgram who first popularized the term in his essay ‘The Small World Problem’, published in Psychology Today in May 1967. Milgram reported on an experiment that asked a randomly selected group of people in Omaha, Nebraska to find a way to forward packages to a stockbroker living in Massachusetts. The ‘starters’ were only allowed to forward their packages to someone they knew on a first-name basis but whom they suspected might know someone who knew the ‘target’ for the package. The second recipients of the package were given the same set of instructions, as were the third and so on. Milgram announced that the median number of acquaintances needed to form a chain that could deliver the package from a person in Nebraska to one individual in Massachusetts was roughly five. There were thus six ‘steps’, or hops, from ‘starter’ to ‘target’.\n\nDoubts have been cast on Milgramâs methods and on the validity of his results, and scholarly interest in his experiment seemed to remain relatively stagnant until D. J. Watts and S. H. Strogatzâs ‘Collective Dynamics of âSmall-Worldâ Networks’ in Nature in 1998. This discussion appeared at a point where the sociological impetus behind Milgramâs work intersected with the emerging field of network theory. In the meantime, though, the concept of ‘small worlds’ and the correlative idea of ‘six degrees of separation’ between any two people on earth had permeated widely through popular culture, not least as a result of John Guareâs popular play of 1990, Six Degrees of Separation. Since the turn of the century, scholarly and mainstream interest in ideas about networks has increased rapidly. For example, new and far more sophisticated online versions of the Milgram experiment have been made recently, often coming up with results that seem uncannily close to Milgramâs own. Thus, in 2011 Facebook researchers calculated that the average distance between any two people anywhere on the social network was 4.74 steps or hops (for two people within the same country the gap reduced to 4). In 2012, capitalizing on the popularity of the ‘Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon’ game, Google built into its search function the capacity to find a ‘Bacon number’ for any actor, based on the degrees of separation between Kevin Bacon and the actor stipulated. A more cerebral, but essentially similar, version of the ‘Bacon number’ is the ‘ErdÅs number’ earned by mathematicians on the basis of their ‘collaborative distance’ from co-authorship of a paper with the Hungarian mathematician Paul ErdÅs (1913—1996). But this is not merely an academic parlour game. Recently, a senior figure in the National Security Agency has commented that the NSA searches the data it collects for signs pointing terrorist collusion using a ‘two to three hops’ measure to probe for connections between suspects.1\n\nTypically ‘small world’ networks, as understood by network theorists, exhibit both a high degree of clustering between nodes, creating dense regions of interconnection, and also an unusually short average path length between nodes. The instances of ‘small worlds’ experiments and metrics just described, though diverse, have strikingly in common an allowable extreme weakness (almost a contentlessness) in the ties that count as a ‘connection’. In Milgramâs experiment, an ‘acquaintance’ known on a first-name basis could range from a best friend someone had known for decades to the much-avoided parent of a child at oneâs childâs school. A ‘friend’ on Facebook does not imply any personal relationship of any kind between the ‘friends’: if my own experience is anything to go by, many Facebook ‘friends’ are almost by definition people that the user has never met. A contact on LinkedIn is often someone who comes out of the ether.\n\nSimilarly, Sir Laurence Olivierâs ‘Bacon number’ (both Olivier and Bacon are in Kindred Britain) is 2 because Oliver appeared with Diane Lane in the forgettable A Little Romance (1979) and, more than two decades later, Lane appeared with Bacon in the forgettable My Dog Skip (2000).2 As a matter of interest, if we were to deploy the term a ‘KB2 number’, standing for a ‘Kevin Bacon-Kindred Britain number’, Olivierâs score would be 21 because there are 20 familial intermediaries between him and Bacon. One final example of the tenuousness of the ‘connections’ that are often used to form small world networks: it seems (in the nature of these things, it is hard to be certain) that for the NSA the creation of a personâs potential two hop ‘connection’ to a terrorist might an action as simple as unknowingly visiting the website once of someone who once visited a terrorist-linked website.\n\nThe dramatic quality of many ‘small world’ social networks, both forensic and ludic, often seems to rely on the strategy of stretching the meaning of ‘connection’ to a point of almost total elasticity. And yet the desire to keep producing new versions of these networks points to a deep contemporary compulsion to envision the world as interconnected.\n\nLittle Britain\n\nKindred Britain is a social network. But Kindred Britainâs ‘small world’ social network differs in two substantive ways from experiments such as Milgramâs or from the Facebook study or oneâs professional network on LinkedIn. In the first place, it is striking that most ‘small world’ models are used to understand the present. (Google's ‘Bacon number’ algorithm is only a partial exception to this observation since it computes only relations to Bacon amongst other actors in movies. You will search in vain for a ‘Bacon number’ for great actresses and actors from the past such as Sarah Siddons or Edmund Kean.) Kindred Britain differs in being a social network largely of the past and, unlike most work on ‘small worlds’, it asks how we can use contemporary theories to understand differently, not the present, but history.\n\nThe second way in which Kindred Britain differs from these popular forays into network analysis is that the extraordinarily vague and malleable ways of connecting people in most social networks, as ‘acquaintances’ or ‘friends’, are rejected here in favour of something more clearly defined and restricted: family ties of blood or marriage. The iron law for inclusion in Kindred Britain is that an individual must have familial or marriage ties to someone already included. With a few important exceptions, which are discussed in the final section of this essay, any weaker ties than these are excluded by the logic of the system. The ‘small world’ nature of the Kindred Britain network is still starkly visibly. But it is plausibly, and not melodramatically, small: many of the paths of connection between two individuals shown in Kindred Britain are complex and mediated. People in the past might have been able to intuit some form of family connection that they could not trace clearly or define explicitly. It takes the power of modern computing to make these familial ties visible.\n\nOne further example of contemporary interest in the idea of a web of social connectedness needs to be mentioned. Thanks to immense recent progress on understanding the human genome, the widespread interest in constructing quasi-universal networks has recently exfoliated to include studies of genetic history. For example, new scholarship in population genomics has claimed that a ‘pair of modern Europeans living in neighboring populations share around 2-12 genetic common ancestors from the last 1,500 years’.3 In most cases, though, those ‘common ancestors’ are not personally identifiable as individuals and the chains of particular people linking a contemporary European to those ancient ancestors are entirely notional. Here again, Kindred Britain stands at an angle to contemporary scholarship. For those included in its database, Kindred Britain individualizes and particularizes the abstract and impersonal relationship between what scientists identify only with reference to genomic segmentsâ. Kindred Britain reintroduces narrative and personhood into the scientific discourse. It also makes such distant relationships knowable and meaningful because, using the power of contemporary path-making software, it makes them visible. You can see the human links to the past here, not just understand them conceptually. Furthermore, Kindred Britain demonstrates that, in the case of a certain stratum of British society, the ancestral relationships are far more immediate, more pervasive and more densely interwoven than the general, average number of distant ‘common ancestors’ that a study such as Ralphâs and Coopâs posits.\n\nConsider one further point. Contemporary genetic science, like traditional genealogy, remains focussed on ancestry. It therefore has little or nothing to say about the whole vast terrain of social relationships mediated by the institution of marriage. Perhaps I share 2-12 genetic common ancestors from 1,500 years ago with the woman I sit next to as I write this. But I am related to her in a far more immediate way: she is my wife and I am her husband. Kindred Britain incorporates ancestry, but it also goes far beyond it by embracing as well the crucial dimensions of familial connection and relatedness through marriage. One other way to put it would be to say that genomics and genealogy both work predominantly, if not exclusively, along the diachronic axis. Kindred Britain works along, and combines, the diachronic with the synchronic. That is part of what is new here.\n\nIt is hard to find many estimates of the number of people who have lived in Britain over the last 1,600 years, the period covered, however unevenly, by Kindred Britain. In 1900 the population of the United Kingdom was about 38 million. In 2011, the census estimated there were roughly 63 million inhabitants. At a most conservative estimate, then, we can assume that over the last 1,600 years about 120 million people have lived in Britain. (The figure obviously becomes greater if we consider the inhabitants in Britainâs empire during this period.) Kindred Britain includes roughly 30,000 individuals, perhaps 500 or so of whom are foreigners who married into British families. Or, to put it another way, Kindred Britain contains roughly 0.025% of the total population of Britain for the last 1,600 years. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB), a standard biographical reference work, contains, at the time of writing, 58,664 individual entries for âpeople who shaped the history of the British Isles and beyondâ dating back to an even earlier period than that covered by this site. Kindred Britain contains approximately 4,431, or about 7.5% of the individuals also included in the ODNB. That is to say, from a population sample of 0.025% it accounts for 7.5% who have ‘shaped the history’ of the country. The asymmetry between these two figures does suggest that British culture and history have been dominated in a sustained fashion by a relatively tiny slice, connected by family associations, of the total population of Britain through time.\n\nHowever, just as the path between two individuals in Kindred Britain is about more than the pathâs endpoints but also about the intermediary people that lie along this path, so it is important, when thinking about who is included in Kindred Britain, to recognize who is not included. Around the small city of names recorded in this database stretches a vast, dark wilderness of unrecorded and, in some sense, excluded lives. This database represents one manâs effort sustained over a few years to comprehend and share something about the British family and its relation to culture. If more researchers spent longer, the size of the database could doubtless be increased enormously. Some of the people ‘missing’ at present, such as the poets Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Robert Browning, the philosopher Thomas Hobbes, the computer scientist Alan Turing, the playwright Ben Jonson, the scientist Michael Faraday and the fantasy novelist J. R. R. Tolkien, would find their ways into Kindred Britain. But the more important truth is that most people who have lived in Britain could probably never be included in Kindred Britain. This website emphasizes connections, but the right, balanced way to read these connections is with an awareness not only of the people who are linked but also of the nameless throng of the unintegrated millions as well. From one point of view, or in one mood, it is hard not to think of the ‘people who shaped the history of the British Isles and beyond’ as being so suffocatingly narrow and exclusive a familial group as to make that history seem largely tragic. In that sense, then, Kindred Britain is not only a contribution to ‘small world’ studies because it is constituted out of a network with a high degree of clustering and a relatively short average path length, given the spans or geography and chronology traversed. It is also a ‘small world’ because it shows, for better and worse, how parochial the basis for a national culture can be. This might seem a retrograde and regrettable analysis. But what if, in addition to being retrograde and regrettable, it also turned out to be true?\n\nThere is another sense in which Kindred Britain is a ‘small world’ network. This sense has less to do with network science or demographics than with iconography. The family or clan has always occupied a highly symbolic role in most cultures. Conservative and radical thinkers alike have often drawn analogies between the organization of the family and the organization of the state. Edmund Burke claimed that familial and local affections were the basis of all attachments to wider affiliations, such as that binding citizens to the national community: ‘To be attached to the subdivision, to love the little platoon we belong to in society, is the first principle (the germ, as it were) of public affections’ (Reflections on the Revolution in France). And Alexis de Tocqueville argued that for European countries the family, especially in the person of the father, was the very image of the state:\n\nAmong aristocratic nations social institutions recognize, in truth, no one in the family but the father; children are received by society at his hands; society governs him, he governs them. Thus the parent not only has a natural right but acquires a political right to command them; he is the author and the support of his family, but he is also its constituted rulerâ¦. In aristocracies, then, the father is not only the civil head of the family, but the organ of its traditions, the expounder of its customs, the arbiter of its manners. He is listened to with deference, he is addressed with respect, and the love that is felt for him is always tempered with fear. (Democracy in America, vol. 2, bk. 3)\n\nThe family is symbol of the country: this is a myth that the British monarchy has played on successfully for several centuries: the ‘modern’ royal family has placed an image of contented and self-contained family life at the centre of its claims to national representativeness and legitimacy. To talk about the British family is, then, to talk about the symbolism of the nation. And the specially closed and tightly-contained nature of family links, and particularly the links in the modern ‘nuclear family’, intersect with another of the crucial discourses about national identity. (OEDâs first citation of the term ‘nuclear family’ comes from a 1924 article by the anthropologist BronisÅaw Malinowski.) Britainâs self-image as an ‘island’ nation dates back to at least the mid-18th century and became increasingly pervasive during the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, when Churchillâs use of ‘the island’ as a trope for Britain provided one rhetorical culmination to the tradition. It is as if the island-consciousness encoded at the national level finds itself reflected in the metaphoric islands of separateness and inviolability that characterize immediate, local phenomena in Britain.\n\nEverywhere you go in the country you can see enclaves and havens of separateness: gardens, allotments, clubs, pubs, phone boxes, garages, hedged fields, worlds behind walls. English poetry, with its sustained absorption in traditional poetic forms, can seem similarly obsessed with a vision of beneficent boundaries and borders. Examine book jackets from the early part of the 20th century and you are struck by the number of tidy, ruled boxes and textual containers that publishers used in their designs. This deep investment in boundedness mirrors the governing trope for English society: the island. The island is a bounded, self-enclosed space, set off from the rest of the world by what John of Gaunt in Shakespeareâs Richard II sees as a defensive wall of water:\n\nThis earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,\n\nThis other Eden, demi-paradise,\n\nThis fortress built by Nature for herself\n\nAgainst infection and the hand of war,\n\nThis happy breed of men, this little world,\n\nThis precious stone set in the silver sea,\n\nWhich serves it in the office of a wall,\n\nOr as a moat defensive to a house,\n\nAgainst the envy of less happier lands,\n\nThis blessed plot, this earth, this realm,\n\nthis England.\n\n(As you might expect, John of Gaunt, Shakespeare, Richard II and Churchill are all included in Kindred Britain: they can all be connected by family ties.) The ‘little worldâ¦ houseâ¦ blessed plot’: all the metaphors that heighten the sense of the intrinsically set apart, the self-complete, the privileged and insulated are figures of speech that can be directed towards an ideal image of the family as well. The family is a type of social island, and, as such, it can seem to symbolize the country itself. The ‘little world’ of England is deeply congruent with the ‘small world’ of family connections that has ‘shaped the history of the British Isles’. On that island, the metaphor of the family, and the reality behind the metaphor, provided a segment of the island's inhabitants with an even deeper sense of exclusivity and interrelationship. Kindred Britain is not just about British families, then. Because the family, as opposed to the individual, holds such symbolic weight within the culture, Kindred Britain is at the same time an investigation of family and an investigation of Britishness.\n\nScholarly Aesthetics\n\nGenealogy is one of the most ancient and conservative forms of scholarship, complete with its own paraphernalia of experts and highly stylized rules. It is interesting to note, however, that, along with cartography, genealogy with its intricate schematizations of relationships of descent is ultimately responsible for the birth of the modern science of network representation. Network analysis is typically held to start with Leonhard Eulerâs work in the 1730s on the problem of the ‘Seven bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg’. But in truth network representation begins much earlier, with the intricacies of genealogical trees and pedigree rolls and complex decisions about inheritance and birthright.\n\nIf Kindred Britain were a book, it would be at least a foot wide and would weigh more than several bags of sugar. The material in it would be inert, static, and, because of its scope, virtually unassimilable. As it is, the data for Kindred Britain occupies a tiny, occluded space on one Stanford server. It glows on the wafer-thin silicon layer on your TFT-LCD display. And its contents are non-linear and almost infinitely manipulable. Genealogy is one of the most ancient historical genres, and what was almost certainly the first self-conscious use of network understanding. Fully aware of the paradox, Kindred Britain projects that old, conservative discipline into an absolutely modern medium to produce new understanding. One or two mouse clicks, a few dragging actions, a strategically hovering cursor, a name, or a word tapped into a search box, can unleash formidable amounts of computing power dedicated to generating disruptive knowledge and provocative ideas.\n\nAs such, Kindred Britain clearly belongs in the emerging field of the digital humanities. One very simple way of establishing its location is to reflect on the fact that the project is not an archival one, concerned primarily with storage of material. Instead, Kindred Britain is one that requires the power of computing algorithms for its effect: no book could tell you how Shakespeare and Jane Austen are related. Kindred Britain does not store or re-mediate or just make slightly more accessible the already known, but it produces new knowledge. One of its key experiences should be surprise.\n\nBut, again, Kindred Britain stands at an angle to mainstream scholarship in the area of the digital humanities, in just the ways I have already described the site standing at an angle to much of the work in ‘small worlds’ theory and social networks. The technology to do much of the work now categorized as part of the digital humanities hardly existed a decade ago. But although of recent emergence, the field is now complex and variegated enough to make general assertions risky. Nonetheless, it is unmistakable that one of the major trajectories within the digital humanities has been a drive to import an ethos, or simulacrum, of scientific method and rigor into the field of the supposedly rigorless humanities. My own field, literary study, has always been haunted by an envy of other disciplines and their apparently strict methodologies have often been contrasted to the weakness of those prevalent in literary criticism. For example, the New Criticism, the method that, though now 70 years old, still continues to provide a basic praxis for many scholars, sought to cultivate an aura of disinterested objectivity, professionalism and technical expertise that its practitioners borrowed, or mimicked, from technical fields.4\n\nThe dominant trend in contemporary digital humanities is heavily angled towards scienticism, as if the true significance of the field were that it allowed scholars to escape from subjectivity, imagination, knowledge, perhaps even creativity and to see safety instead in charts, maps, spreadsheets and tables. In the hands of a number of scholars, above all those of Franco Moretti, the results of this scientific and analytic mood have been impressive. But the field often seems fraught with problems. In less artful hands, the results of data mining and distant reading strategies have often seemed like a string of platitudes supported by sequences of ugly graphs. There is something unsettling, both about the ways in which sophisticated scientific methodologies are imported, oddly smoothly, into a humanistic context and about the desire to establish credibility for the humanities by trying to make them approximate to a social science or even a hard science. And, at the same time, there is something oddly conflicted about studies that often seek to go beyond the venerable unit of the book in their analyses and yet, openly eager to remain within the traditional scholarly channels for the distribution of knowledge, return to the book in order to publish their own findings.\n\nAlthough the digital humanities only exist because of the rapid advances in engineering and coding that have occurred over the last decade or so, the field can often seem relatively remote from the dominant experiences of the medium (games, video, streaming media, digital art, mash-ups, social networks and so on) that this technology has created. There are important exceptions to this observation, such as some of the advanced work currently being done at Harvard and at UCLA, the home of the HyperCities project. But the digital humanities as an academic project often seems very far from capitalizing on the immense creativity that has been exercised in the digital realm outside the university. As a major section of digital humanities activity has sought to embrace the social scientific and the numerical, it often seems to have turned its back on sophisticated visual experience, as well as on the realms of artistry, subjectivity, metaphor and imagination — for all of which contemporary digital technology has proved itself to be highly amenable. At a time when humanists often profess themselves to be concerned with healing the breach between the academy and a wider public sphere, what exactly have the digital humanities learned from the extraordinary achievements of engineers, designers and information specialists in the worlds of commerce, gaming, animation and social media?\n\nKindred Britain is an attempt to map out an alternative possibility for the digital humanities, a mode to coexist with the kinds of digital humanities project that earnestly seek a scientific imprimatur for their efforts. The effort embodied in Kindred Britain is multivalent. It is an intensive scholarly effort (30,000 connected names is scholarship in a very orthodox key) that also tries not to lose touch with the lightness, beauty and power of contemporary technology, or to ignore the fact that an intrinsic part of almost everyoneâs online experience, high or low, is playful, populist, communal, exploratory. Unlike many digital projects in which new techniques are applied to an existing body of knowledge, and unlike traditional scholarly projects that typically use well-established formats to present new knowledge, Kindred Britain tries to bring both new knowledge and new techniques together. Rather than seeking empirical or numerical certainties, or pseudo-certainties, Kindred Britain embraces the idea of a digital humanities project that offers images, possibilities, propositions, suggestions, counter-narratives, disruptions rather than conclusions. It is designed to evoke new, defamiliarizing imaginative connections and ideas, but connections and ideas that are nonetheless always based on a solid grid of historical facts.\n\nFor example, Kindred Britain surprises me and sets me, as a literary critic, thinking when it shows that poets apparently tend to be related to one another by ancestry and novelists by marriage. Kindred Britain shows that Byron, Shelley, Tennyson and T. S. Eliot were all distant cousins. And it also suggests that the familial links between, say, Austen and Dickens and Trollope came predominantly through marriages. To put it another way, the family relations between poets tend to be historically-oriented and the relations between novelists tend to be contemporaneous, or near-contemporaneous, cutting across time rather back into the past.\n\nThese observations make you question whether there is a relationship between the social and familial worlds of poets and the forms they write in. Does looking at the family histories of poets light up a kind of resilient conservatism and elegiac, backward-looking character in the genre itself? And does the way novelists tend to be affiliated through marriages demonstrate something about the themes of choice, chance, courting and money that novels, at least before the 20th century, thrived on?\n\nAs I look at these results thrown up by Kindred Britain, some, old, persistent questions come back into focus. Is there something intrinsically aristocratic and conservative about poetry? Is there something inherently worldly and bourgeois about the novel? And what Kindred Britain adds are more questions. Are these literary characteristics related somehow to family experience? Could it be that authors tend to ‘select’ for a genre because of family characteristics? There might be no obvious causal relationship between genre and family. Nevertheless, the site's documentary realities sponsor such flights of the critical imagination.\n\nAbout everyone in the database, we offer ‘scores’ — about the level of tragedy in a personâs life, for example, or about their network ‘centrality’ — in a speculative, non-dogmatic spirit. We suggest links between ‘similar’ individuals using not documentary evidence but an algorithm. These are early, open-ended efforts to suggest new ways of approaching familiar historical figures. Noel Annan wrote in his 1955 essay that ‘Family connexions are part of the poetry of history.’ What he meant in part was that history has, or should have, a poetic and metaphoric dimension to it that goes beyond the prosaic recounting of facts. We do not ask poetry to be ‘true’ in a literalistic or numerical sense. We ask it to be illuminating, provocative, insightful, even beautiful. We ask it to be a counter-voice. Why not ask the same things of a piece of scholarship in the digital humanities? Rather than seeking to assist in making the humanities into an annexe of the sciences through the use of digital technology, Kindred Britain aspires to use the creative power of digital technology to articulate something that is distinctively humanistic.\n\nCorrelatively, this site tries to borrow from some of the commonest, most everyday forms of digital experience. Sports have taken on the characteristics of video games: the steering wheel on a Formula 1 racing car now looks like a gaming console and racing drivers train for new tracks using a ‘simulator’ in the factory. War, too, has become like a video game, where a crew in Nevada stares at monitors and uses joysticks to control an unmanned but heavily armed drone flying over Afghanistan. Perhaps scholarship needs to take on this idiom as well to make itself seem contemporary? In my heart of hearts, I would have been happiest if we had somehow been able to present a site that was a fully immersive online environment, a work of scholarship that looked like a video game.5 That proved unfeasible, given our limited resources, though I believe that such a project could, under the right circumstances, be achievable. (As if in a dream I feel that I can experience the idea without being able to describe it adequately.)\n\nThere have been a few more or less serious efforts to introduce some vestiges of the game into literary study: at the low end is something like Alan Liuâs wacky apprentice piece ‘Tiintern Abbey First-Person Shooter’. However, Kindred Britain tries not to disown the aesthetic sophistication of techniques developed in a commercial gaming context. For example, the Biography Boxes (with their badges and medals, links and event summaries) are an homage to the efficient presentation of information available on character sheets in role-playing games. (Older users might feel that Biography Boxes and gaming character sheets are really updated versions of baseball cards.) The dragging and dropping functionality that allows users of Kindred Britain to interact and explore connections between different historical figures is little different than what you might find in a hundred different strategy games. And, at a more informal level, Elijah Meeks and the present writer thought up as a tribute to the subtle pleasures of the mobile app Koi Pond the interactive twinges that the site will respond with when you move your cursor over an array of floating nodes in Kindred Britain's Network panel. Scholarship does not have to degrade itself or give up its own aspirations if it seeks out some of the forms that digital creativity has provided.\n\nKindred Britain borrows judiciously from popular forms, from social media sites and from games not because it is a game but because some of the most creative and aesthetically sophisticated thought about how to convey information happens in popular contexts. The development of the digital humanities occurs within the wider and much-bemoaned ‘crisis of the humanities’ generally. Here, in Kindred Britain, is one suggestion about how to start moving beyond the crisis. Although the site rests on a foundation of exhaustive and highly traditional scholarship, it tries to move beyond conventional categories of demarcation, looking for ways to appeal to both academic and public audiences, believing that both kinds of user can approach the site fruitfully. If Kindred Britain is successful, it will feel equally contemporary and antiquarian, popular and specialized, ludic and serious. Here is another sense in which Kindred Britain takes to heart E. M. Forsterâs motto, ‘Only connectâ¦’.\n\nThe mirror\n\nYou can think of Kindred Britain in two ways. In one way, it is a project profoundly about the past. Friedrich von Schlegel said that the ‘historian is a prophet looking backwards.’ In a similar, though humbler, spirit, this project emphasizes digital innovation in the service of humanistic memory and understanding. Kindred Britain is a heavily-documented vision of a small, vanished world: predominantly British middle- and upper-class and aristocratic society of the last several hundred years. It is a panorama of bankers and painters, novelists and generals, scientists and merchants, with a few reprobates and monsters thrown in alongside many quiet, unillustrious or truncated lives. A monarch connects to a sea captain. A composer to a squire. A diarist to a doctor. It is close to 30,000 people, mainly British, mainly dead, from more than 12 centuries who are bound together by family connections. Whatever chasms of fortune, profession or fate separate these people, all of them are unified into a particular kind of image of the past. Kindred Britain is an attempt at a holistic image of the nation, however fragmentary and incomplete that image may be. It is not a falsely idyllic image. The sense of organic inter-connectedness between people through and across time does not imply any lack of conflict or tension. As everyone knows, and as we saw in my opening story about a family murder, members of families can be as cruel to each other, or crueler, than they can be to strangers.\n\nBut in another way, Kindred Britain evokes the scene that it seems to turn away from, looking backwards in order to see the present. To focus on the family in the past is also to think about the family now. Few themes are as controversial in contemporary society as family. Sociologists debate whether we are entering an era of terminal decline for the family as a social unit. Political campaigns exploit fears about the threat apparently posed to the traditional family and its supposed values, not least by the long-heralded legitimization of same-sex marriage. Genealogy has traditionally held an extremely conservative and restricted notion of what constitutes a family — though large loopholes have been crafted as a matter of course in European studies to take account of the colourful, profligate and multi-dimensional love-lives of the continentâs incontinent monarchs.\n\nBut for all the rearguard actions played out in the name of tradition, the conservative notion of family stands at odds with a broader, more ecumenical conception that is gradually taking hold in society generally. In its initial state, Kindred Britain attempts, with only partial adequacy, to reflect a more generous conception of family relations. But we sometimes had to struggle against the way the medium inexorably shapes the message. There are (moral and ideological) codes in (computer) code. Most standard-issue genealogical software records only a limited range of relationship types considered ‘legitimate’ by its authors. (Sometimes I wondered whether the way to test whether a digital humanities project is valid and interesting or not is simply to ask whether it can be realized with off-the-shelf software? If it can, then the project is not valid.) While the limitations in the stage of development that the Kindred Britain software has reached mean that we are not yet able to show fully and distinctly the many ‘associations’ between male royalty and their mistresses, the site does attempt, through notes, to indicate the genealogical significance of these outside-marriage relationships. Lower down the social scale, Kindred Britain also attempts to be realistic about out-of-wedlock relationships, such as the ones that the Victorian novelist Wilkie Collins carried on simultaneously with Caroline Graves and Martha Rudd, or the out-of-wedlock relationship that the photographer George Charles Beresford and Jessica Wilson maintained and that produced their children.\n\nMore importantly, Kindred Britain selectively designates as ‘married’ some famous same-sex couples such as those of Natalie Barney and Romaine Brooks, W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman along with Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas. From an earlier historical period, it also labels as (for want of a better term) ‘married’ the pair of learned ‘wedded brothers’ Sir John Finch and Sir Thomas Baines. This decision has important consequences not only for the local texture of descriptions of an individual and his or her family. It also has implications for the path-finding and connection-making capacities of Kindred Britain. Thus the familial connection between the poets Alfred Tennyson and Siegfried Sassoon is an example of the ‘dark networks’ of illicit or unacknowledged kinship that haunt and expand on traditional genealogical understandings of family ties. In this case, the line from Tennyson to Sassoon is shown passing through Sassoonâs long-time lover, Stephen Tennant, with whom Sassoon lived in a relationship that lasted as long as a good many marriages. Much remains to be done to make this aspect of Kindred Britain more systematic and nuanced, but in this area, as in so many other areas on the site, our effort has been to experiment and to provoke discussion — and to gesture to the complexity of human relations as best we can within the current limitations of our system — rather than to produce an exhaustive or conclusive statement.\n\nIf Kindred Britain acts like a mirror using the past to reflect on the present in a general sense, then it is my hope that each user of the site will also feel prompted to look through it at his or her own situatedness within at least one family structure. How constrained or empowered by family ties are you? How much did the family in which you were a child affect you? What are the family relations that matter to you and that you recognize as creating obligations of a special kind? How have these relations changed over time? Is there an official family history in your life? And an unofficial one? Would all the people that you think of as being a part of your own family be recognized by the state as legally related to you? Are there familial ‘dark networks’ that connect you to particular people in socially subversive or unorthodox ways? When you look around you at people who are not your relations, and perhaps at people whom you do not even know, strangers in the street, how certain are you — and how certain do you want to be — that Kindred Britainâs path-finding technology could not find ways to reveal to you your kinship with a stranger?\n\nI began ‘Originating Kindred Britain’ by describing a family tragedy. In some ancient cultures, groups constructing a building would sacrifice a child or a slave and bury the remains in the foundations to ensure the godsâ protection of their structure. For, as W. H. Auden wrote, they reasoned, or understood, that ‘without a cement of blood (it must be human, it must be innocent) no secular wall will safely stand.’ Buried at the bottom of this website are, figuratively speaking, a tiny fraction of humanityâs innumerable victims. A very sick man killed his wife, his daughter, his servants and then, after a period of wandering delirium, killed himself. It shocked me. It was my hearing about these events that triggered this entire, exhausting, multi-year effort. Perhaps all scholarly projects, this one included, are fuelled by feelings and anxieties as well as by reading and ideas. If this is true, then it might be fair to say that, amongst much else, Kindred Britain, articulated through Scott Murrayâs beautiful design and Elijah Meeksâs expert development, has been my symbolic attempt to put something that was broken back together. In making Kindred Britain, I felt as if I walked among the dead for a moment. And, using the power of words, codes and images to connect, I tell myself the site restores to the darkness of the past a glimmer of life, a glimmer of family life.\n\n1.

The website ‘What Jane Saw’ by Janine Barchas seems to be a scholarly work trending in the same general direction. â©\n\nDeveloping Kindred Britain\n\nKindred Britain presented a challenge that is growing ever more common in digital humanities scholarship: create a publication that ties together traditionally distinct categories of data in an accessible and scholarly manner. In this case, it meant bringing together network data, geographic data, biographical data, and chronological data, while presenting that in tandem with traditional linear narratives. While projects like Neatline1 and Hypercities2 have striven to provide such capacity to users out-of-the-box, and leveraging robust content management systems like Drupal can achieve similar results, the kind of data present in Kindred Britain, along with the plans to publish such data in tandem with a scholarly narrative, required a novel solution. As a result, Kindred Britain deploys several innovative features at various technical levels. This was necessary to utilize a database that was rich, emergent, and dynamic while simultaneously sparse, uncertain, and uneven.\n\nAs a tradeoff, Kindred Britain lacks the functionality for easy amendment and annotation of data found in the aforementioned applications. Development of Kindred Britain, like development of ORBIS,3 did not include the creation of a user interface for modifying content. The goal was not to create a tool or interactive dashboard, but rather to publish some form of Nicholas Jenkinsâs scholarship in an accessible and highly interactive manner. While this means that the fundamental structure of the site is tied to the particular database and research agenda of the project, this does not mean that certain patterns, whether in interaction design or actual snippets of code or UI/UX, will not prove reusable by the larger communityâdigital humanities and otherwiseâthat concerns itself with building interactive objects. What follows is an examination of the development of Kindred Britain, which includes modeling the data structure, interpolating new data to fill the gaps, deriving new measures of objects in the database possible as a result of these improvements, designing methods to present the data, and coding the components and overall structure according to a cohesive design.\n\nData and Data Modeling\n\nThe database so painstakingly populated by Jenkins was built using a popular web-based CMS for genealogy known as PHPGedView.4 Following the traditional *AMP model,5 PHPGedView provided Jenkins with the capacity to describe family relationships, annotate individuals with events, and place those events in time and space. It also gave indications of how data-driven narratives might take place in allowing users to explore paths between individuals as well as changing the perspective to geographic locations to see individuals associated with those locations.\n\nBut to provide better performance and more robust calculations, the database needed to be migrated to PostgreSQL, where sophisticated geospatial, network, and chronological queries could be brought to bear. The PostgreSQL version of the database employed several novel techniques to store and represent the genealogical data, including participation arrays, event periods, and network-based estimation of event dates.\n\nKindred Britain data was originally represented in GEDCOM format, a proprietary encoding specification in common use for genealogical software. GEDCOM works in such applications quite well (PhpGedView in this case), but with limitations. It has been faulted for its handling of a few important aspects of genealogical data, including temporal ordering, participation in events, and ‘non-traditional’ families. To be fair, there is not as yet any simple solution for ordering historical events in databases, given that date specifications are so often vague, ambiguous, or simply missing. In the second case there are simple ways of re-modeling historical data to better handle events, as we describe below. In the third case, one has to get by variously: one spouse must be a WIFE and the other a HUSB, whatever their gender; polygamy produces separate families; affairs that produce children are treated as marriages, whether illicit (during marriage) or not; and so on.\n\nIt is worth noting that some vital modeling patterns are well-accounted for in GEDCOM. Statements about individuals and families, like much historical data, come to us from particular sources such as written and oral histories, and newspaper accounts. Accounts will vary, and as good historians we will ideally represent all plausible ones, from reputable sources, that we are aware of.\n\nAn initial phase of the Kindred Britain project was the conversion of a single large GEDCOM data file to a relational database. There were two principal motivations for this: (1) the GEDCOM file structure is labyrinthine, requires special parsers to make even simple queries, and is not what we call ‘human-readable;’ and (2) the handling of eventsâparticularly birthsâdid not afford certain functionality in the planned Kindred Britain web application. So, to address those problems and make the data readily usable with the state-of-the-art software tools and libraries we favor, the data had to be parsed and reorganized (re-modeled) into a spatial relational database such as PostgreSQL (our preferred open-source platform). Doing so gave us added design flexibility, enabling the addition of attributes such as profession to individuals, for example.\n\nEvent Centrality\n\nEvents mediate relationships between people, between people and things, between people and places, and between things and places (Fig. 1). This is not a scientific revelation, but it is an important precept increasingly seen as underlying data modeling patterns that simplify software development for many data visualizations and analyses. The Kindred Britain data model leverages this principle in implementing a couple of such patterns, for participation and setting. The principal event categories in Kindred Britain are births, deaths, marriages, divorces. Periods of employment and of residence in a place are handled much like events, but are less likely to have associated timestamps. Many of these pertain only to an individual, but others have multiple participantsâa fact we needed to capture in populating life-period timelines in the application. Participants in a birth are mother, father and child. Both husband and wife (actual or nominal) participate in marriages, divorces, and annulments. In some cases, generic events are associated with a family unit. Though the event itself may have applied to both parents and children, it more often only applied to just the spouses, so for Kindred Britain these events were only associated with the designated spouses in that family unit.\n\nFigure 1: Events, and particularly participation in them, are central computational objects\n\nBecause events occur in places, we can generate geographic footprints for individuals as a function of the events in their life, and readily aggregate them for families, segments of families, or any other grouping of individualsâdynamically, as users navigate through the application.\n\nData models are created to meet the immediate requirements of applications as designed, but are most useful if made extensible to accommodate foreseeable future enhancements. The Kindred Britain data model was designed to easily capture all sorts of other eventive data in the future, if desired. Some interesting potential eventive extensions include: the creation and publication of artworks and literature, performances, and membership in any sort of group or organization. These would both enrich the description of individuals and families, and broaden the network kinship to include the social. Increasingly, the value of such generalized data models is being demonstrated in an interoperable and mashup-ready Semantic Web of linked data.\n\nFuzzy Dates\n\nAs in most historical work, many dates available in Kindred Britain's primary and secondary sources are vague; just as often they are missing. This means we donât know the precise start and end of many lives, or of the events within them. The range of date values in the database include: 28 FEB 1832, FEB 1832, BET FEB 1832 AND 1833, BEF 1833, AFT 1833, ABT 28 FEB 1832, FROM 1832.\n\nSeveral application functions require at least an estimated lifespan, such as rendering a line in a timeline and identifying individualsâ contemporaries. Similarly, the reconciliation of individuals in Kindred Britain with individuals in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography required birth and death dates to identify possible matches. Finally, we needed to give some indication in the interface of the certainty of a piece of temporal data. The first decision was to work at the temporal scale of years. Where finer detail is available, it is displayed, but calculations are on years. We parse four quality levels of year data: actual (YR), about (ABT), before or after (BEFAFT), and estimated (EST). All date functions take the first of these they find, and render related symbols accordingly. The estimated year was computed with the InferBirth script (written by Wilson Restrepo, Stanford â13) as follows:\n\nParse all YR, ABT and BEFAFT values available in the existing data.\n\nFor each individual missing a birth year, create an array (possibly incomplete) of birth years for their spouses, parents, children, and siblings. A similar array was created for those individuals missing death years. The goal was to calculate the missing birth (or death) year for the individual. The intuition guiding the algorithm presumes that the relative ages of kin at various events (age at birth of children; age of spouse; age of parents at birth) will be comparable between individuals.\n\nFor families with complete data, compute an average age difference between individuals and other family members of different type, as a training set. In other words, we assume there is an average age difference between spouses, between parents and children, and between siblings. The missing birth and death years are estimated to be the average of average distances for their kin with known values. A cross-validation routine confirmed to us that estimated years are within four years plus or minus.\n\nNote that individuals without birth information and with no relatives with birth information are not accommodated by this algorithm, but by running the algorithm recursively, estimated dates can be used to estimate dates, with predictably degenerate returns. Results proved reliable when compared to updated birth and death data discovered after running the script.\n\nDeriving New Measures\n\nThe development of traditional archival and textual data into databases affords researchers the capacity not only to represent visually the existing data and patterns, but to discover whether other views of the data can reveal new patterns. This applies even more to the extension of traditional scholarly databases into those that better model space, networks and events. The structure of the Kindred Britain database makes it possible to analyze the overall demographic details of the individuals over time, such as average lifespan, family size, and so on. But it also allows for analysis of patterns based on genealogy combined with location or occupation.\n\nThe database itself is extremely uneven, with many individuals having no events other than those associated with birth, death, and marriage. But the structure of the database also allows for a clearer understanding of the density of events and details within it. The unevenness and uncertainty of areas within the database can, to borrow the phrase, become a ‘known unknown’ that helps scholars to properly evaluate the patterns represented in a work. These new measures can also prove to be useful when brought to bear in any database that combines network, eventive and geospatial data.\n\nNetwork\n\nKindred Britain is fundamentally a network dataset, with nodes representing individuals and edges representing the kin relations between them. As with all network data, this makes it amenable to a family of statistical analysis methods that deals with clusters, paths, and other network structures, and afforded us the capacity to develop the following measures.\n\nTragedy\n\nThe Tragedy Index, which is a numerical abstraction of the prominence of negative events in a personâs life, was created by leveraging simple textual analysis and statistical analysis of the demographic variables and events associated with an individual. This was coupled with statistical analysis of siblings, parents, and children, which was combined and enumerated in a list for each individual. You can read more about how tragedy was computed and its implications here.\n\nCentrality\n\nThe most straightforward use of network analysis comes in the use of centrality measures for each individual. The centrality measurement in Kindred Britain is an average of the ranking for each individual according to Betweenness Centrality, Eigenvector Centrality, Closeness Centrality, and PageRank, run on the undirected network. These ranks were then aggregated into 9 categories: 10 Most Central, 100 Most Central, 1,000 Most Central, 10,000 Most Central, 10,000 Least Central, 1,000 Least Central, 100 Least Central, 10 Least Central, Median. Each category consists of the number of individuals listed, except the last, which consists of those remaining individuals in Kindred Britain that do not fall in the prior 8 categories. You can read more about how centrality was computed and its implications here.\n\nDepth\n\nDirectionality of network connections was utilized to determine how many generations of ancestors were represented in Kindred Britain , in a measurement which was referred to as a ‘Parentless’ numberâ6 during development and was later retitled ‘Depth’. This is simply the sum of lineal steps (at least one parent) traceable from an individual backward through the database, and gives some sense as to whether an individual comes from a historically well-documented family or not.\n\nInbreeeding\n\nDirectionality coupled with pathfinding and specificity in the kind of relation determines the Relatedness measure (later referred to as ‘Inbreeding’, which attempts to find an ancestral path between an individualâs parents. So, for instance, if a direct lineal path could be found between two parents that terminated two generations prior (indicating the parents were first cousins and so had one or more common grandparents) then this value would be 5. Initially it was thought this could be made more readable by deriving the number of steps to such a common ancestor, but this didnât account for unequal paths from either parent (such as if the common ancestor was a grandfather from one direction but a great-grandfather from the other) and so readability needed to be sacrificed for accuracy.\n\nODNB Distance\n\nAs a very simple measure that leverages network analysis techniques, Kindred Britain provides a genealogical distance measure from every individual not referenced in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography to the genealogically nearest individual who is mentioned in the ONDB. Simple measures like these, and their cognates (such as the genealogical distance to someone mentioned in Annanâs seminal essay,7 or the genealogical distance to a poet or admiral8), extend the concept of an ego network to provide a thematic ego network that helps to develop a network perspective on culture. These measures serve to allow a user to triangulate the position of an individual in a network based on their distance to nodes defined by their category or numerical attribute.\n\nGeospatial\n\nThe geospatial data in Kindred Britain also follows the concept that the site provides only a broad sketch of the relationships of the people included. While the temporal range of the site is some 15 centuries, the geographic nature of the events associated with individuals is aggregated in rough, arbitrary units, consisting of modern countries, US states, and a mix of counties and other administrative regions in the United Kingdom that combine to make a not-quite-historic-nor-quite-modern result. While comprehensive historical geography for the United Kingdom exists,9 the delivery of a dynamic web atlas of historical Britain was beyond the scope of this project, just as the delivery of an exhaustive network of kin relations or comprehensive biographical database was.\n\nDespite the historical nature of the geospatial containers used for Kindred Britain, they still provide the capacity to examine aggregate statistics for the individuals in Kindred Britain. Put simply, a county or state can have a tragedy score that is the average tragedy score of the people associated with that place, or the same for any of the numerical attributes of individuals.\n\nBut more than that, an administrative area can be used as a facet in the changing character of families by contrasting the occupational and geographic attributes of siblings, spouses, parents, and children of people associated with a place. Each place has an array of occupations that are most commonly associated with it, as well as occupations most commonly associated with the parents of people associated with this place, and their children, spouses and siblings. Likewise, geographic association based on kin ties can be coupled with a place to reveal changing demographic patterns.\n\nBiographical\n\nThe individual entries in Kindred Britain are quite uneven, ranging from unknown names and birthdates for some individuals to T. S. Eliot, for whom there are 102 separate events tracked in Kindred Britain. T. S. Eliot has nearly twice as many events as the next most numerous, Joseph Priestley with 57, who has more than 14 times the number of events as the average individual, with 3.98 events. Full statistics on event coverage as well as other demographic variables are available on the Kindred Britain Statistics page.\n\nClose Links\n\nOne new piece of biographical data made possible by its development in a PostgreSQL environment is the genealogical distance of an individual from ‘luminaries’ in British culture. This utilizes the pgRouting library and a particular function developed by Daniel Kastl, that efficiently discovers least-cost network paths from one node to many nodes. In our case, the many nodes are a selection of nearly 200 individuals in Kindred Britain designated by Jenkins as representative luminaries. This allows for another kind of triangulation within the network, so that even if the individual focused on has sparse data, we can get some sense of where they sit, genealogically, in relation to well-known figures in British culture.\n\nBadges\n\nWhere feasible, individuals have been tagged with one or more known occupations from a list of 122 occupations. Along with these occupations, we derive a set of network attributes described in the Network Data section to further characterize individuals based, and we count the number of children and marriages they have listed in the database. These are presented as badges to provide more detail.\n\nEvents from Contemporaries\n\nEven with sparse data, the creation of new numerical attributes for each individual as outlined in the Network Data section above, combined with geospatial and occupational data where known and the number of marriages and children, provide us with some capacity to derive lists of similar individuals that lived during the same period. These similar people, who had to be over the age of 18 when the individual examined is over the age of 18, provide the basis for populating the event list with events from people who are, very roughly speaking, peers. While this is a parsimonious kind of social network, meaning that it is simplistic and with theoretical flaws such that in many cases it would be unlikely that these individuals actually knew each other, it emphasizes the individual as a situated perspective within a genealogical network rather than a single biographical entry. The method to determine similarity is as follows (where distance is the absolute value of the score of one person subtracted from another):\n\nDistance between tragedy scores.\n\nDistance between centrality scores.\n\nDistance between Depth scores divided by 13.\n\nDistance between Inbreeding scores divided by 2.5.\n\nDistance between number of children divided by 3, with a maximum value of 2.\n\nDistance between number of marriages, with a maximum value of 2.\n\nIf both individuals are in the ODNB, then subtract 0.5, otherwise distance between ODNB scores divided by 10.\n\nSubtract 2 for each shared occupation.\n\nSubtraction 0.5 for each shared location.\n\nFrom this calculation, take the top 15 closest (those with the least total score) from individuals who were alive and over the age of 18.\n\nThe decision to include a fixed number of similar individuals has issues of its own beyond the schematic sense of similarity used above. A better approach would be to include links to individuals based on a globally significant similarity score or a locally significant score. A more rigorous approach might benefit from enhancements such as a requirement of some kind of geographic or professional overlap. Even so, this initial foray into similarity was designed with a pragmatic goal in mind: to provide a sample of events from similar people, with a more exhaustive approach possibly attempted in the future.\n\nContextual Events\n\nThe third category of textual data presented in event format to better understand an individual is a list of historically significant events that took place during the time frame covered by Kindred Britain. This list, compiled by Jenkins with the support of two undergraduate research assistants, provides the capacity to embed historically significant events in the event list. This list consists of a large spreadsheet of years and plain-text summaries of a historically notable event or events from that year, and it is from this list that three events are added to each list: one for the year of birth, one for the year of death (if applicable) and one for the mean year between them.\n\nAs a result of these efforts, even an individual for whom we know nothing more than their birth. death and marriage has a much richer biographical entry that gestures to the events of their period through the world historical lens and the lens of similar people. While this is only a small step in enhancing our understanding of people for whom we have little historical knowledge of, it has a real significance from the perspective of increasing the weight of such little-documented individuals from a data-driven perspective.\n\nInteractivity and Narrative\n\nPerhaps the most novel component of Kindred Britain involves the use of the most traditional of methods of representing humanities scholarship: long-form linear text narrative. Early on in the project, we developed the concept of an interactive narrative that would embed inline controls to modify the data visualization components of the site, while allowing the user to step out of the narrative at any moment and return to browsing and searching the site. This coupling of text with interactivity is growing more common, with examples in data-driven journalism such as ‘Snow Fall’, ‘How to Fold a Julia Fractal’, and ‘Out in the Great Alone’. 10\n\nFigure 2: Early Interactive Data Visualization Coupled with Narrative Text with Inline Links to the Interactive Visualization from May 2012\n\nStories, as theyâre referred to on the site, provide traditional narratives about the people in Kindred Britain from both a cultural and conceptual perspective. Stories included with the release of Kindred Britain utilize information visualization to provide context for historical events as well as the mechanics of computing centrality and tragedy. They also serve as examples of how the various controls implemented for browsing and examining data can be used to better understand the nature of groups presented during traditional browsing of the database.\n\nProviding the capacity to emphasize points in the text is a challenge to humanities scholarship, with its tradition of using figures sparsely, if at all. Kindred Britain is still rudimentary in its capacities, especially in regard to sharing them. Only the stories themselves can be shared as links, and not the individual pieces of text that relate to an interactive figure. Once this is possi"
