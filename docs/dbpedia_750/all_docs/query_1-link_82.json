        "text": "Forensic science – our past, present and future\n\nThis presentation will provide an overview of forensic science and the principles behind its role within the justice systems. It will explore some of the opportunities and limitations of the use of science from the crime scene to the court room and the, sometimes, challenging positioning of emerging technologies particularly as we move further and faster into a digitally connected world.\n\nCritical aspects such as the development of data sets, including that generated by citizens, the rise of open science, the importance of ethics and the necessity of clear communication of science across the interdisciplinary landscape, will be amongst the range of topics touched upon.\n\nProfessor Niamh NicDaeid FRSE, University of Dundee, UK\n\nProfessor Niamh NicDaeid FRSE, University of Dundee, UK\n\nProfessor Niamh Nic Daeid is a Chartered Chemist and authorised forensic scientist. She is a Professor of Forensic Science and Director of the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science at the University of Dundee. She is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and holds fellowships of the Royal Society of Chemistry, the Chartered Society of Forensic Science, the Institute of Chemistry of Ireland, the Royal Statistical Society and the UK Association of Fire Investigators.\n\nShe has held leadership positions with the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI) as a past chair of the fire and explosion investigation working group and as vice chair of the scientific advisory board of the International Criminal Court for 6 years. She is a forensic expert advisor to the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and is also vice chair of the Dundee Drugs Commission investigating drug related deaths in Dundee.\n\nDNA mixture evidence: an example of the process to determine reliability\n\nThe molecular biology and chemistry behind the generation of DNA profiles is robust. Sensitivity of detection has increased substantially over the years, such that only a few cells' worth of DNA can be sufficient to obtain interpretable data. However, the quality and quantity of biological evidence can be limiting - especially so with complex mixture evidence. Interpretation of mixtures requires the consideration of several aspects, many of which are based on generally accepted principles, supported by the peer-reviewed scientific literature, and demonstrated by on-site, internal validation studies conducted by a laboratory's technical staff. These 'aspects' include the results' scientific defensibility, validity, uncertainty, limitations, transparency, documentation, disclosure, bias, error rates vs error, in addition to the education and training gaps of those involved in collecting, measuring and interpreting results.\n\nAlthough there is no standard approach for mixture interpretation, there are accepted practices within an approach. If these practices are followed, results can be scientifically defensible. However, misapplications have occurred, primarily due to technology transfer gaps, training limitations, misunderstandings, bias, transparency and quality assurance issues. These limitations pose challenges for the legal system to determine the validity of a methodology and the reliability of results presented in a report, case file, and/or during testimony.\n\nForensic DNA analyses can be arcane for non-scientists, but there are various aspects that can be scrutinised to assist the trier of fact and their gate keeper responsibility to determine the robustness of the science and expertise of scientists. All science has limitations. It is incumbent upon practitioners to define, understand, and communicate these limitations so results are not overstated (as well as not overly understated). DNA mixture evidence from the laboratory to the courtroom is a good example for showcasing aspects important for assessing the reliability of - or at least gaining confidence in - the results presented.\n\nProfessor Bruce Budowle\n\nUniversity of North Texas, US\n\nProfessor Bruce Budowle\n\nUniversity of North Texas, US\n\nDr Bruce Budowle received a PhD in Genetics in 1979 from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. From 1979-1982, Dr Budowle was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Working under a National Cancer Institute fellowship, he carried out research predominately on genetic risk factors for diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, melanoma and acute lymphocytic leukaemia.\n\nFrom 1983-2009, Dr Budowle worked at the FBI’s Laboratory Division to carry out research, development and validation of methods for forensic biological analyses. He has published more than 700 articles, made more than 800 presentations and testified in well over 300 criminal cases in the areas of molecular biology, population genetics, statistics, quality assurance and forensic biology.\n\nIn addition, he has authored or co-authored books on molecular biology techniques, electrophoresis, protein detection, forensic genetics and microbial forensics.\n\nDr Budowle recently retired as Director of the Center for Human Identification and Regents Professor at the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth, Texas where his efforts focused on the areas of human forensic identification, microbial forensics and emerging infectious disease with substantial emphasis in genomics and next generation sequencing.\n\nHe continues to research and work in the areas of forensic genomics and contributes to supporting humanitarian efforts via human identification. He currently is a visiting professor in the Department of Forensic Medicine at the University of Helsinki and an adjunct professor in the Forensic Science Institute at Radford University.\n\nVoice recognition\n\nVoice recognition is the process by which distinctive characteristics of an individual's speech are used to identify or verify who they are. As lay listeners, humans recognise familiar voices intuitively in an everyday sense and may also find themselves being 'earwitnesses' to a crime, albeit rarely. When carried out by trained practitioners using specialised methodologies and tools, voice recognition, comparing often unknown speech samples, can play an important role in investigative and forensic contexts.\n\nThis talk will consider the landscape of forensic voice recognition, encompassing auditory analysis by trained listeners, acoustic-phonetic measurements of perceptually salient features, and automatic speaker recognition using signal processing and modelling algorithms that are statistical or based on deep neural networks. The Bayesian likelihood ratio framework will be critically examined as a means of evaluating the strength of evidence using any voice analysis methodology. The importance of validation of the prevalent and emerging approaches, to understand their limitations and to provide reliable and transparent reports to the courts, will be discussed.\n\nAdditionally, the varying acceptance of voice recognition evidence in different parts of the world will be explored. Anticipating the new challenges posed by machine-created spoofed speech, this talk also will reflect on the risks, mitigations and, more optimistically, emerging opportunities afforded by using both human- and machine-based analysis.\n\nDr Anil Alexander\n\nOxford Wave Research\n\nDr Anil Alexander\n\nOxford Wave Research\n\nDr Anil Alexander is an expert in forensic voice and speaker recognition and is the CEO and co-founder of Oxford Wave Research, a company that has developed a speaker recognition system used in forensic laboratories around the world.\n\nDr Alexander has a PhD (2005) in forensic automatic speaker recognition from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne (EPFL). His doctoral work focussed on quantifying the strength of voice evidence in mismatched recording conditions and was in close collaboration with the Faculty of Law and Criminal Sciences at the University of Lausanne (UNIL), Switzerland.\n\nHe has also served as an expert in forensic audio and speaker recognition cases. Dr Alexander is currently an external PhD co-supervisor at the University of Cambridge in the areas of voice similarity and voice spoofing by humans and machines. He is also an affiliate member of the NIST (National Institute of Standards, USA) OSAC Speaker Recognition Subcommittee, where he contributes to developing standards and guidelines for forensic speaker recognition.\n\nHe has also previously chaired the Research Committee of the International Association for Forensic Phonetics and Acoustics (IAFPA). His 'open box' design philosophy centres around creating real-world forensic software systems that allow forensic scientists to look inside, observe and understand how these systems work.\n\nEvaluating digital evidence\n\nDecisions impacting justice have become increasingly reliant on science and technology, motivating advances in digital forensic science. Ongoing efforts in this field include studying scientific foundations and error mitigation analysis. However, this gradual adaptation is not keeping pace with rapidly increasing volume, variety, velocity, distribution, structural intricacy, and complexity of digital data which are strongly impacting the institutions responsible for justice.\n\nThis talk introduces four initiatives that address the challenge of evaluating and expressing uncertainty of digital evidence: 1) The Digital Investigation Vulnerability Taxonomy, which covers the detection and mitigation of problems, 2) The C-Scale, which helps standardize how evaluative opinions are formed and expressed, 3) The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Artifact Catalog, which collects standard reference data at the speed and rate of change in this area by crowdsourcing expertise and 4) The Cyber Sleuth Science Lab, which educates the future generation of practitioners to deal with the challenges of digital evidence and artificial intelligence\n\nAn introduction to likelihood ratios\n\nThis session will introduce the issues of importance when using likelihood ratios in a legal context, and will consider other approaches to reasoning about uncertainty. The speakers will consider the scientist's role in provision of information to help reduce uncertainty while not trespassing into the role of the factfinder, the importance of transparency, the impact of the relevance and adequacy of data available to the scientist, and of avoiding the fallacy of the transposed conditional.\n\nWhile the scientific issues are universal, jurisdictional differences affect whether and how such evidence is presented. The session will touch on what has been observed in court and consider future challenges.\n\nProfessor Gill Tully CBE\n\nKing's College London, UK\n\nProfessor Gill Tully CBE\n\nKing's College London, UK\n\nGill Tully has over 30 years' experience spanning research, casework and regulation in forensic science. She is Professor of Practice for Forensic Science Policy and Regulation at King's College London, in addition to providing training and consultancy services.\n\nFrom November 2014 to February 2021, she was the Forensic Science Regulator for England and Wales, responsible for setting quality standards for forensic science in the Criminal Justice System and for advising and challenging Government.

She has advised the Government and companies on bringing research to market and has actively collaborated internationally. Her research interests include improving the quality and effectiveness of forensic science and improving the interface between science and the law.\n\nIn her training and consultancy role, Gill works with forensic science leaders and practitioners to assist with improving the quality, reliability and effective application of forensic science, from crime scene to court.\n\nIn 2020, Gill was awarded a CBE for services to forensic science. She is an Honorary Fellow of the Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences, an Honorary Fellow of the Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine, an Honorary Member of the Society of Legal Scholars and a member of the International Society of Forensic Genetics.\n\nHuman genome editing and enhancement\n\nThere has been rapid progress over the last few years in developing genome editing techniques to treat patients with genetic disorders, with many clinical trials now in progress. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has licenced the first genome editing treatment that has been deemed both safe and effective: a treatment for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassaemia.\n\nHowever, these genome editing techniques could also be used for 'enhancement' a concern voiced by many. Fears range from applications that might increase social inequity to the creation of armies of super-soldiers. What might be possible, how and to whom the methods might be applied, and the nature of any likely consequences are all complex topics that require proper thought and not simple, scary headlines.\n\nIn this talk, Professor Lovell-Badge will discuss somatic, epigenetic, and heritable changes that could be made by genome editing, and how these could involve anything from conferring an advantage - for example, changing a common allele into an outlier allele - to conferring novel traits - for example, introducing 'designer' genes or those from other species. He will also mention uses for this editing technology that might give unfair advantages in sport, be considered protective (whether for disease resistance, in exploration, or for the military) or - to be very speculative - enhance human evolution.\n\nDr Robin Lovell-Badge FMedSci FRS, Group Leader and Head of the Division of Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Genetics, The Francis Crick Institute\n\nDr Robin Lovell-Badge FMedSci FRS, Group Leader and Head of the Division of Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Genetics, The Francis Crick Institute\n\nRobin Lovell-Badge is interested in decisions of cell fate, especially within the context of sex determination in mammals. Robin discovered that a single gene, Sry, present on the Y chromosome, sets cells of the reproductive organs on the path to becoming male — famously propelling ‘Randy’, a female mouse he engineered to develop into a male, to front-page news.\n\nHis work also includes a focus on stem cells. These self-renewing cells have the potential to transform into any other cell type and hold promise for treating a wide range of diseases. By studying the genes that confer these special abilities, Robin is examining how the decisions that determine the ultimate role of a cell in the body are made.\n\nSome of Robin’s research is conducted using mouse models, which he compares with findings in chicks to add an evolutionary perspective. Consequently he is very interested in the public perception of using animals in research. He also advises on policy relating to stem cells and their use in medical treatments.\n\nCognitive enhancement: Do drugs work, why are people using them and what are the ethical and societal implications?\n\nThere is an increasing use by healthy people of cognitive enhancing drugs or 'smart drugs', including amphetamine salts (Adderall), methylphenidate (Ritalin) and modafinil (Provigil). These are frequently used to increase performance in university exams or at work or even to complete work successfully, particularly if the job involves high risk impacts and also to counteract the effects of jetlag or sleep deprivation leading to fatigue. Published studies from Professor Sahakian's laboratory and articles published by others have shown that these drugs do improve cognitive performance on some objective tests in healthy people.\n\nWhile many think that it is easy to distinguish between the use of drugs to treat a diagnosed illness and the use of drugs for enhancement purposes, this may not be so clear. For example, if you are an older person still working and you are competing with people in their 20s (at the optimal level of cognitive performance), is using a drug to restore your cognition back to your younger self restoration or enhancement? Also, while one medical practitioner may decide that the symptoms of poor attention and hyperactivity are sufficiently severe for a diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), another clinician may not.\n\nWhen as a society would we want healthy people to use these drugs? Would we want to use wake promoting drugs, such as modafinil, to keep the military personnel alert during conflict situations or to keep surgeons functioning at their optimal level of performance during late night emergency operations? Healthy people are also microdosing with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin apparently to improve creativity and productivity and to improve mood, although the objective evidence for these beneficial effects is lacking. We also need to consider from a neuroethical perspective, which forms of cognitive enhancement are acceptable, for whom and when, and what methods we should use to improve our cognition and wellbeing as individuals and to flourish as a society.\n\nProfessor Barbara Sahakian FMedSci, Professor of Clinical Neuropsychology, University of Cambridge\n\nProfessor Barbara Sahakian FMedSci, Professor of Clinical Neuropsychology, University of Cambridge\n\nProfessor Barbara J Sahakian is based at the University of Cambridge Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute. She is a Fellow of the British Academy and the Academy of Medical Sciences.

Decisions to withdraw care focus typically on clinical indicators predicting a poor neurological outcome. No currently accepted clinical measures can determine the likelihood of good functional recovery (allowing sufficient function for independent activities of daily life).\n\nIn recent years, rapid technological developments in neuroimaging have provided several new methods for revealing thoughts, actions and intentions based solely on the pattern of activity in the brain. These methods are now employed in many research centres to assess residual brain function, detect consciousness and even to communicate with some clinically non-responsive patients who appear comatose, or in a vegetative, or minimally conscious state.\n\nThese emerging technologies have profound implications for clinical care, diagnosis, prognosis, ethics, and medical-legal decision-making after severe brain injury. In this talk, Professor Owen will review some of the latest developments in this field, focussing on how and when these the new tools might be integrated into decisions about withdrawal of care.\n\nProfessor Adrian Owen OBE FRSC\n\nBrain and Mind Institute, University of Western Ontario, Canada\n\nProfessor Adrian Owen OBE FRSC\n\nBrain and Mind Institute, University of Western Ontario, Canada\n\nAdrian M Owen is Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience and Imaging at the University of Western Ontario, Canada and co-directs the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) Brain, Mind, and Consciousness programme.\n\nHis research combines structural and functional neuroimaging with neuropsychological studies of brain-injured patients. Owen has published over 400 scientific articles and chapters as well as a best-selling popular science book Into the Grey Zone: A Neuroscientist Explores the Border between Life and Death.\n\nHe was awarded an OBE in 2019 for services to scientific research.\n\nThe future of brain interfacing\n\nThe era of brain interfaces is approaching. Simple brain interface devices have been used in the clinic for about twenty years, though only in limited contexts. Recent advances have shown that the clinical potential of brain interfacing is immense, including the restoration of lost sensory and motor function and the treatment of a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\nWe are also seeing a steep rise in interest from academia, industry, investors, and the public. This interest is further accelerating progress, but also has the potential to create unrealistic expectations for the field. This talk will present a brief view of the present state of brain interfacing and some thoughts on future developments and limitations.\n\nProfessor Philip Sabes\n\nUniversity of California, San Francisco, US\n\nProfessor Philip Sabes\n\nUniversity of California, San Francisco, US\n\nPhilip Sabes is a neuroscientist, neural engineer and a Professor Emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Philip received his PhD from MIT, focusing on machine learning and models of human motor control, and trained as a neurophysiologist during a postdoc with Richard Andersen at Caltech.\n\nAt UCSF, the Sabes Lab combined neurophysiology, computation and behaviour to discover how sensory feedback drives movement control. The lab also developed technologies for Brain Machine Interfacing (BMI), including the first demonstration of real-time artificial sensory feedback delivered via multi-electrode microsimulation and a novel sewing-machine approach to neural interfacing that allows micron-scale, thin-film devices to be individually implanted in the brain.\n\nIn 2017, Philip retired from UCSF to help launch Neuralink. While there, the company further developed the sewing machine approach, demonstrating a fully-implanted, 1,000 channel device. After leaving Neuralink, Philip co-founded Starfish Neuroscience, a startup focused on Neuromodulation. He currently resides in the Seattle Area.\n\nMemory in the dock\n\nMemory retains a privileged role in the courtroom, and it is difficult to envisage witness evidence that does not, to a greater or lesser degree, rely on the exercise of this faculty. Nevertheless, its privileged status is under challenge, primarily based upon findings from cognitive science.\n\nThis talk will provide a brief introduction to the complex structure of human memory and then address a number of key areas where its reliability has come under increasing scrutiny. This will include consideration of potential contamination via post-event misinformation, the relationship between confidence and accuracy, how memory is impacted by time and the potential contribution of witness variables. Professor Dolan will conclude by considering the implications of these findings and how they might impact the weighting attached to memory-based evidence.\n\nProfessor Raymond Dolan FMedSci FRS, UCL, UK\n\nProfessor Raymond Dolan FMedSci FRS, UCL, UK\n\nRay Dolan is a Mary Kinross Assessor of Neuropsychiatry at UCL. He is currently Director of the Max Planck Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing at UCL. His research is concerned with the neurobiology of emotion and decision making, as well aits aberrant expression in the context of psychopathology. He is a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (2000), Fellow of the Royal Society (2010) and an external member of the Max Planck Society (2012).\n\nA human information processing approach to forensics\n\nThe value of eyewitness reports for criminal investigation and prosecution is fundamentally tied to accuracy. Recognising that accuracy is rarely patent, can be corrupted by use of suggestive procedures, and that such testimony may have no physical corroboration, the US Supreme Court established in Manson v. Braithwaite (1977) a 'reliability test'. This test reflects simple intuitions about human information processing that are to be weighed by the courts to assess accuracy - hence admissibility - of eyewitness evidence. Since this influential ruling, two important things have happened: (1) new procedures for DNA-based identification have confirmed high rates of wrongful conviction resulting from eyewitness misidentification and (2) science has significantly advanced understanding of the contributions and limitations of sensation and memory in human decisions. In light of this modern science-based understanding, it is clear that the Manson test is insufficient to yield what was intended: a useful estimate of eyewitness accuracy.\n\nThis presentation will outline the difficulties of inferring the accuracy of candid human testimony, which is impacted by three factors: uncertainty, bias, and overconfidence. Uncertainty results from manifold sources of noise that plague biological systems for sensation and memory. Biases are born from prior experiences and expectations and called into service to fill informational gaps. The ease of this unwitting perceptual/cognitive completion, in turn, yields exaggerated confidence. This framework highlights alternative approaches to accuracy rooted in the modern sciences of human information processing.\n\nProfessor Thomas D Albright\n\nVision Center Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, CA, US\n\nProfessor Thomas D Albright\n\nVision Center Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, CA, US\n\nThomas D Albright is Professor and Conrad T Prebys Chair at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. He is an authority on the neural basis of visual perception, memory and visually guided behaviour.\n\nAn important goal of Professor Albright's work is the development of therapies for perceptual impairments resulting from disease, trauma, or developmental disorders of the brain. A second aim of his work is to use growing knowledge of brain, perception, and memory to inform societal decisions.\n\nProfessor Albright received a PhD in psychology and neuroscience from Princeton University. He is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS), a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Professor Albright served on the NAS Committee on Science, Technology, and Law, on the National Commission on Forensic Science (an advisory body to the US Department of Justice), and on the human factors committee of the Organization of Scientific Area Committees for Forensic Science. He has also served as co-chair of the NAS Committee on Scientific Approaches to Eyewitness Identification, which produced the 2014 report Identifying the Culprit: Assessing Eyewitness Identification.\n\nAttribution: from global climate change to individual damaging events\n\nChanges in global temperature can be attributed to specific causes, and this attribution has demonstrated that greenhouse warming has indeed influenced the climate and has revealed by how much. This talk will explain the key concepts behind attribution, including what is known about human-caused changes in rainfall, drought, and extreme events, and the linked impacts such as vegetation dieback, fire and human-caused climate change.\n\nWe can now also understand and attribute the causes of individual extreme events - this helps identify whether climate change has changed the likelihood of events occurring and how the impacts of climate change compare to other factors such as human land or water use change. This talk will give examples ranging from scenarios where little or unreliable climate change influence was found, to those showing a substantially increased probability of events, and even to those where an event would have been impossible without human influence. It will also briefly describe the process of Assessments of Climate Change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nProfessor Gabi Hegerl FRS\n\nUniversity of Edinburgh, UK\n\nProfessor Gabi Hegerl FRS\n\nUniversity of Edinburgh, UK\n\nGabi Hegerl is a climate scientist who focuses on identifying the drivers and mechanisms of observed climate change. This work provides a critical underpinning to predictions of future changes.\n\nGabi published some of the first studies determining that recent warming is statistically different from climate variability, and pioneered a method that distinguishes between possible causes for climate change, such as greenhouse gas increases or changes in the sun. She has also made important contributions to estimating climate sensitivity, and to determining the causes of changing characteristics of extreme weather events. Gabi's recent work has shown that human influences have changed global precipitation patterns, sharpening the contrast between wet and dry regions, while volcanic eruptions show an opposite effect.\n\nGabi has had key roles in scientific assessments of climate change (IPCC), and is a fellow of the American Geophysical Union and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. She received a Royal Society Wolfson Merit award, the Hans Sigrist Prize awarded by Bern University (2016) and the Achievement Award of the International Meeting on Statistical Climatology.\n\nInteractions between climate change and air quality in policy and science\n\nMany air pollutants that are subject to international regulations (such as SO2, NO2, NH3, VOC) also influence climate, often through the products of chemical processing in the atmosphere. Probability and associated statistical tests offer ways of quantitatively linking environmental damage, including air pollution, to specific sources, provided that the necessary data can be obtained. This can be extremely useful in civil law cases.\n\nIn addition, the design and implementation of net zero policies offers an opportunity to enhance air quality, delivering substantial reductions in air pollutant concentrations and their effects on the environment and human health as a co-benefit.\n\nThis talk will describe air pollutants, their interactions with the climate, their effects on the environment. It will also present a range of policy options for improving air quality, touching on the approaches taken in different countries and their differing benefits.\n\nProfessor David Fowler CBE FRS, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (Edinburgh Research Station), UK\n\nProfessor David Fowler CBE FRS, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (Edinburgh Research Station), UK\n\nDavid Fowler’s research interests are mainly in the biogeochemistry of nitrogen, sulphur and carbon and specifically on surface-atmosphere exchange processes. These interests include some of the major regional environmental issues including photochemical oxidants, eutrophication, acid deposition, emissions of greenhouse gases and atmospheric aerosols. His published work includes 210 refereed publications and a similar output of other papers, reports and books. He has an Honorary Professorship at the University of Nottingham, became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1999, a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 2002, and in 2005 was awarded a CBE for services in Atmospheric Pollution research.\n\n'What did the law do in the climate crisis, Daddy?' - Market perspectives on climate change\n\nOrganisations are looking at how to score well in environmental, social and governance (ESG) rankings, but is ESG a driver for a proper anti-climate change market? Voluntary carbon offset markets dominate the conferences, but are any of them actually pukka and how puny are they? The UK crows about having the world's first 'legally binding' national commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but do the markets care?\n\nIn this talk, Professor Mainelli will assess progress and promise on climate change and the carbon markets. He asserts that green markets and green finance in greenhouse gas emissions aren't that special. Rather, traditional market measures are essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including competition, open data, better regulation, and community standards markets. One current problem is that society does not talk openly about the real costs. While wider green issues of land misuse, pollution, or biodiversity may still require special approaches, the biggest investment risk - government policy change risk - is not being discussed loudly enough.\n\nProfessor Mainelli concludes that properly costed carbon markets with financial cuffs on government policy (eg policy performance bonds, aka sovereign sustainability-linked bonds) could go a long way, and that the voluntary carbon offset markets can work if financial guarantees are added. 'Rule of law' has a huge role, as it does in all well-functioning markets, but special legal approaches are probably unnecessary against greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nProfessor Michael Mainelli\n\nZ/Yen Group and City of London Corporation\n\nProfessor Michael Mainelli\n\nZ/Yen Group and City of London Corporation\n\nMichael is a scientist and economist trying to promote societal advance through better finance and technology.
