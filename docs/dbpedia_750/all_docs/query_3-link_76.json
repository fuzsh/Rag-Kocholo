        "text": "Our ancestor Richard Barker, the great-grandfather to us all was a truly remarkable and prosperous man. He was young, affluent, educated, undoubtedly a risk taker and ambitious when he came to the New World. He came to this country seeking religious freedom as a Puritan. He built a life for himself and his family out of the wilderness and ultimately he, and men and women like him, built a new country. His origins in England are unknown, but we can make some educated guesses. He settled in Andover, Massachusetts as early as 1643, and he was doubtless related to the Rowley Family of Barker’s (James and Thomas) which sailed from Hull, England in 1638..\n\nAccording to tradition, Richard Barker was born c1618 in (Holme-on-Spaulding-Moor, Yorkshire), England, (others have him born in Nayland, Suffolk, England) and died March 18, 1692/3 in Andover, Massachusetts.\n\n(Based upon research I did on Ancestry.com his father Richard was born in Nayland, Suffolk, East Anglia and his mother Mary Woodgate was born in Holme-on-Spaulding-Moor, Yorkshire, England. Therefore, it is possible that he was born in either place. My speculation is that while his father was from Nayland, Suffolk he was born and raised with his mother’s family in Holme-on-Spaulding-Moor in Yorkshire close to Hull, England. Both parents died in 1618 according to records. Richard was baptized in Tollerton, Nottinghamshire, England. If indeed these where Richard’s parents it would appear he was an only child, and he was likely raised by relatives. My guess is after he was born his parents traveled to Holme-on-Spaulding from Nayland and baptized him along the way in Tollerton, Nottinghamshire, England. Pure speculation of course. Please refer to the notes below discussing the possibility that he was taken under the wing of Thomas Barker who came to Rowley, Massachusetts with Rev. Ezekiel Rogers. Make no mistake though his actual origins have never been confirmed.)\n\nAccording to “Historical Sketches of Andover” there is evidence of his ties to the families which settled in Rowley, Massachusetts and that in the summer of 1638 he was aboard the ship “John” of London which sailed from Hull, East Riding, Yorkshire, England for New England. On board were about 20 families, nearly all of whom were from Yorkshire under the leadership of the Rev. Ezekiel Rogers, former pastor of the church at Rowley, Yorkshire, near Hull. It is probable that among the passengers and their families who came with Mr. Rogers were: Thomas Barker of Holme-on-Spaulding-Moor, Yorkshire (a village a few miles from Rowley, England); James Barker who was from Stradishall, Suffolk, England, RICHARD BARKER,; Maximilian Jewett, and his brother Joseph, from Bradford; John and Robert Haseltine from Biddleford in Devon; and George Abbot. It is thought the ship came into Salem, Massachusetts, where the passengers spent the winter.\n\nThe relationship of the three Rowley Barker’s – Thomas, James and Richard – is unknown, but undoubtedly they were kinsmen. Thomas died in 1649, and his widow Mary married on July 16, 1651, the twice-widowed Rev Ezekiel Rogers. There is no mention of James or Richard in the will of Thomas, but perhaps he had given them money and/or land prior to his death. Records show him to be a wealthy man. He had no children. (again we can speculate on whether or not Thomas may have agreed to keep Richard under his wing and provided him with resources to get a foothold in the New World. Some records show Richard’s parents dying in 1618 or soon after he was born.) Thomas and James settled in what became Rowley Plantation at first and then simply Rowley, Massachusetts. It is about 15 miles from Rowley to North Andover, Massachusetts.\n\nRichard Barker was the first settler in what is now the town of Andover, the only citizen known to have been there as early as 1643. (Richard Barker was one of the signators establishing Andover: see The Essex Genealogist Vol 21:195 (2001). The parent towns were Newbury and Ipswich. Richard bought his land in what is now North Andover in 1643 from a person called William Hewes who somehow had managed to claim it before Rev Woodbridge’s group arrived. With the land went a house, stock, corn and hay, and the place was called Pond Farm in New Meadows. A deed a year later, in 1644, has an illegible statement in which the words Haggerts Pond can be plainly seen. Richard Barker’s heirs have always held the land on the West Side of town near Haggert’s Pond, so it is assumed it is the original Barker land.\n\nRichard Barker always seemed to have money, and he chose to stay near the pond in Andover. He kept on buying additional land with more ponds, and mill streams, and finally owned land down to the Merrimack River at the ford, near Duck Bridge. In time, Richard Barker signed with twenty-three others to obtain land in New Hampshire close to Concord, they had forty to one hundred persons ready to go up and settle, with sons and servants. They did not ultimately get this land, but they did get land north of the Merrimack in Massachusetts, which now makes up the town of Methuen. Son Stephen Barker (our ancestor) was instrumental in obtaining the this land and was a founding father of Methuen.\n\nRichard Barker was a surveyor and he was road commissioner as early as 1653. He was a prominent man in both town and church affairs, and served on many important committees, was often selectman, and administered many estates for his neighbors, performing duties assumed later by lawyers in the community. His house lot was near that of John Osgood, on the North side of Cochichawicke, and his descendants settled in the vicinity until the entire shore of the Great Pond on the north, east and south, was taken up by the farms of the family.\n\n“(The Barker Family Farm is still in existence and was awarded a National Bicentennial Farm. It is the oldest continuously run family farm in the United States.)\n\nhttp://www.essexheritage.org/attractions/barkers-farmstandhttp://www.essexheritage.org/attractions/barkers-farmstand.\n\nI had the opportunity to visit the farm which is currently run by Diane Barker daughter to George Barker the 10th generation of Barker’s to run the farm. They have a farm stand and still 150 acres of land in production. Her father George still lives on the farm which she was running for him. They still do their own preserves and vegetables. They sell corn and produce grown right on the farm.\n\nBesides the Tuttles Farm which was sold in 2013, some of the oldest family farms are:\n\n-The Appleton farm in Ipswich, Mass., founded in 1638.\n\n-The Walter S. Hine farm in Orange, Conn., founded in 1639.\n\n-The Lawrence R. Jeete, Jr., farm in Guilford, Conn., founded in 1640.\n\n-The George Barker farm in North Andover, Mass., founded in 1642.”\n\nThe best biography of Richard Barker I could find was written by Marjorie Wardwell Otten.\n\nRichard Barker of Andover, Massachusetts\n\nBy Marjorie Wardwell Otten\n\nRICHARD BARKER was one of thousands of yeomen–“the back-bone of England”–to emigrate to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the late 1630’s. He was young, educated, affluent and a Puritan; but of his English origins nothing is known. He may have first settled at Ipswich or Newbury, for in 1640 he was one of a group of men of the two towns to petition the General Court for a tract of land 15 miles west of the Newbury at the mouth of the Cochichawicke River. This area of the river where it emptied into the Merrimack was known by the Indians as the “The Place of the Great Cascade.” It had been available for settlement as early as March of 1635, but few colonists had been willing to venture so far into the vast wilderness, it being some 25 miles from Boston. When the County of Essex was formed by the General Court on May 10, 1643, “Cochichawicke” was one of the townships included in the new county.\n\nThe first business transaction found of any resident of the new settlement is dated August 13, 1643, at Ipswich. It is a deed of land and stock to Richard Barker ‘of Cochichawicke” by William Hughes of New Meadow (now Topsfield).” Barker’s initial payment was 38 pounds, with and additional 42 pounds to be paid by October 14, 1643, “for 3 yearling heifers, 2 yearling bulles at twelve pounds ten shillings, two kine (cows) at 10 pounds, 4 calves at three pounds, one house and houselot of 7 acres broken up and unbroken-up with all the come thereunto belonging, as also twelve loads of hay, with all the straw of ye corn [Hughes’] farme at tenne pounds….\n\nThus Richard and his bride Joanna became the first of the proprietors to live in the new settlement. His 7-acre homelot was later increased to 10 acres. By town grant and purchase, Richard eventually acquired over 300 acres, all contiguous, in the area of the “The Great Pond” in the northeastern part of the township. With his six sons, he created what today would be called a “Land Acquisition and Management Company.”\n\nNo town could be formally incorporated without a church and a minister, with ten proprietors required by law to sign a covenant. Richard Barker and Mr. John Osgood were among the ten men signing the Covenant on October 24, 1645. The Barker’s were included among the first members admitted to the Church. Six months later, on May 6, 1646, the “General Court” incorporated the settlement as “Andover.”\n\nIn 1650, Richard was one of the witnesses to the will of his neighbor, Mr. John Osgood, whose son, John Osgood II, became one of Richard’s lifelong friends. They, along with Dudley Bradstreet, were the three men most elected Selectmen of Andover. Town records beginning in 1670 show Richard as one of the Selectmen in 1670 through 1675; again in 1678 and 1679, with his eldest son, John, also serving on the Board both years; and in 1681, 1682, 1686, and 1689, by which time Richard was in his seventies.\n\nThere was hardly any town affair of importance for 50 years on record which does not bear Richard Barker’s name as party to or witness of, petitioner, etc. He was prominent in church matters, chosen to be on ecclesiastical committees, and was entrusted with the administration of many estates.\n\nSome time after 1665, and before 1675, Richard was among the 23 men of Andover who petitioned for a grant of land in the Merrimack Valley. As early as 1658, other residents of Essex County had petitioned for “the granite hills north of the Merrimack”–then known as Penacook, today Concord, New Hampshire. Andover’s petitioners stated that “they were exceedingly straitened in their possessions and accommodations” and that they needed more land. The petition noted that “there being besides ye petitioners, forty persons at least, in ye whole under one hundred, if accommodations be found, ready to settle themselves, sons and servants upon it.” The General Court, while amiable to the idea, was prudent in waiting until [there was] and actual list of those settlers sufficient in number to warrant the grant.\n\nKing Philip’s War\n\nAll plans for northward expansion were called off, for in June of 1675, King Philip’s War erupted throughout New England. By November, the colonial governments had determined to mount and assault on the Narragansett Fort in Rhode Island. Richard’s 23-year-old son Ebenezer, along with 11 others of Andover were impressed for this duty, under the command of Lt. John Osgood. All returned from “The Great Swamp Fight” although Ebenezer Barker had been wounded.\n\nAt Andover on February 11, 1678/79, Richard Barker, along with five of his six sons–John, William, Ebenezer, Richard II and Stephen–signed the Oath of Allegiance.\n\nJoanna Barker died April 11, 1687, at Andover. She had been a true “wilderness wife,” doing all the many chores expected at the time…cultivating vegetable gardens, caring for the livestock and chickens, creating a home and the needs thereto, in addition to raising six sons and three daughters:\n\nSARA, b c1648; m. at Andover, 17 November 1673, JOHN ABBOT, b 1648, son of George and Hannah (Chandler) Abbot. Sara died at Andover 10 February 1728/29 “a widow in her 83rd year.”\n\nESTHER, b. May 1651; m. at Andover, 10 August 1676, widower Lt JOHN STEVENS II, who d. 5 or 5 March at Cascoe, (Maine). Esther d. at Andover, 25 June 1713, “suddenly, a widow, 62 years, 1 month.”\n\nHANNAH, b 21 October 1656; m. at Andover, 27 May 1680, widower Christopher OSGOOD II, b. at Ipswich, c1642, son of Christopher and Margery (Fowler) Osgood. In addition to raising a daughter Mary from his 1st marriage, they had 3 daughters of their own. Five days before her mother’s death, Hannah died at Andover 6 April 1687 in her 31st year.\n\nEven with six sons to help, Richard Barker had not been able to put his vast acreage into full production nor, apparently, did he have need to do so. Much of his land remained in wilderness for more than 20 years after the final division grants were made in 1662.\n\nWill of Richard Barker “husbandman,” written 27 April 1688 at Andover:\n\n“To John, eldest son, land behind the Great Pond where he now dwells; part of my 3rd division of land; 3 parcels of meadow, 2 parcels in Wades meadow by Bald Hill of which he has the deeds, also in Beechen meadow and 40 acres of upland near it; To William, 2nd son, land where he now dwells in the swamp division, 40 acres near Beechen meadow, 3 parcels near his brother John, a lowland swapped off with Wade; To Ebenezer, 3rd son, 54 acres of upland where he now dwells and all the land in Shawshin Fields, and meadow of Mosquito Brook; to Richard, 4th son, the Great Pond ground and other lands he holds with some given to his wife, and one of Fuller’s line; To Stephen, 5th son, what he dwells on and Beechen Meadow and some on Mosquito Brook; to Benjamin, youngest son, the homestead and buildings, orchards and meadow and one-half of the household goods; To granddaughters Priscilla, Esther and Sarah Osgood, 40 shillings each. Benjamin Barker was named the executor of his father’s estate. The witnesses were Rev. Thomas Barnard, Dudley Bradstreet, George Abbot “Senior”, Samuel Osgood, and George Abbot jr.\n\nRichard continued to live on his homestead with his son Benjamin and the latter’s bride. All of the management of the family’s affairs had been assumed by the eldest son, John.\n\nThe Salem Witch Trials\n\nWhen the cataclysmic events of 1692 came to Andover, no family was immune, least of all the Barker’s and their extended family kinship. Three men of Andover stand out in their efforts to diffuse and to bring forth the falsities of the accusations: John Barker, John Osgood, and Rev Francis Dane. The Andover “accusers” could not strike directly at Richard Barker due to his preeminent position in the community; however, members of his family could be accused and they were.\n\nOn August 25, 1692, William Barker and his two nieces, Mary Barker (about 13 years old), the daughter of John, and Mary (Osgood) Marston (age 27, step daughter of Esther (Barker) Osgood, were accused of witchcraft, examined and imprisoned at Salem on August 29th, 1692.\n\nHistorians have attempted to portray William as a simple farmer, a “homespun philosopher”, and/or a man down-on-his-luck. With his background, this was hardly possible. But William did have a great imagination and was a good story teller. His confession on August 29th, which he signed and owned on September 7th, caused a sensation. Speaking as “Everyman,” part of his testimony was as follows:\n\n“He confesses he was at a meeting of witches at Salem Village…they met there to destroy that place by reason of the people being divided and their differing with their ministers. Satan’s design was to set up his own worship, abolish all of the churches in the land, to fall next upon Salem and so go through the country. He sayeth the devil promised that all his people should live bravely, that all persons should be equal; that there should be no day of resurrection or of judgement, and neither punishment nor shame for sin.\n\n“In the spring of the year the witches came from Connecticut to afflict at Salem Village but now they left it off. And that he had been informed by some grandees that there is about 307 witches in the country.”\n\nHis confession is found in nearly all texts of the events at Salem in 1692, as his pronouncement of so many witches in the country “caused great concern and fear.” That two other imprisoned women, Ann Foster of Andover, and Mary (Allen) Toothaker of Billerica, had made the same statement weeks earlier, was overlooked at the time and by later historians.\n\nOn September 1, William Barker, Junior, joined his father and two cousins in the Salem Prison.\n\n“There was one test for witchcraft that had a wide following among the learned as well as the common people. This was a kind of laying-on-hands in which the suspected persons were made to touch an afflicted person in the midst of a fit. If the touch seemed to cure, the theory was that the spell had been taken back into the body of the witch from whom it came. Laying-on-hands is, of course, one of the commonest kinds of faith-healing.”\n\nOn September 7th, Abigail (Wheeler) Barker, Ebenezer’s wife, and Mary (Clement) Osgood, wife of John Osgood, were two of seven known women…they among the most prominent of Andover….called to the “Andover Touch Test”at the meeting hours by Rev. Thomas Barnard. They were blindfolded, and their hands laid upon the afflicted persons, “they being in their fits and falling into their fits at our coming into their presence, as they said. Some led us and laid our hands upon them, and then they said they were well, and that we wer guilty of afflicting them. Whereupon, we were all seized, as prisoners, by a warrant from the Justice of the Peace and forthwith carried to Salem.”\n\nPerhaps knowing his testimony had caused such a furor, William Barker wrote a confession from prison. It had no date, but presumably it was written on the 16th of September. On the following day, the Court of Oyer and Terminer met and condemned to death 17 more people, six of whom attended the Andover Church: Rebecca (Blake) Eames, Abigail (Dane) Faulkner, widow Ann Foster, Mary (Foster) Lacey, widow Mary (Ayer) Parker, and Samuel Wardwell.\n\nFinally realizing his own peril as well as the danger to all the Barker family at large, William managed to escape or was smuggled out of prison, and until the following spring was in hiding. The sheriff immediately seized his cattle as forfeiture. His brother, John Barker was forced to redeem them for 2 pounds 10 shillings.\n\nShortly thereafter, Abigail Barker was interviewed in the Salem prison, saying, “We did profess that we were innocent and ignorant of such things [i.e. witchcraft] and we hearing that Samuel Wardwell had renounced his confession and quickly after condemned and executed, some of us were told we were going after Wardwell.”\n\nJohn Barker and Francis Faulkner posted a 500 pound recognizance bond on October 3, 1692, for the release, pending trial, or Mary and William Barker and Mary Lacey, Junior. John Barker and John Osgood, along with others, posted bonds for the remaining imprisoned children of Andover, and they were released pending trial.\n\nThroughout the rest of the year, John and Ebenezer Barker and others signed many petitions to the Governor and the General Court for release, on bond for those imprisoned…but to no avail in the case of Abigail Barker. In early January of 1693, the court of Salem found Abigail not guilty, as later were William Barker, Jr. and Mary Barker.\n\nRICHARD BARKER watched helplessly as the town he helped to found appeared to disintegrate. But by February of 1693, the delusion of witchcraft had nearly ended. On March 18, 1692-93 at Andover, RICHARD BARKER died, aged about 75 years. A month later, on April 21, 1693, his lifelong friend, John Osgood died….”exhausted from the tribulations” and some said “of a broken heart.”\n\nEven though the lives of so many of Andover had been devastated in 1692, these two men, serving for so many years, had established a strong community that would endure. The six Barker sons would carry on the traditions.\n\nSons of Richard and Joanna Barker\n\n(All dates are at Andover unless noted)\n\nCapt. JOHN, b. c1644; d. of small pox, 3 January 1731/2; m. (1) 6 July 1670, Mary Stevens (c1651-1703). He m (2) int.

His son William Jr was also accused. All survived and judged not guilty.\n\nEBENEZER, b. 22 March 1650/1; d. 22 January 1745/6 “in 96th year;” m. 25 May 1686, ABIGAIL WHEELER (c1667-1743).\n\nLieut. RICHARD II, b. 10 April 1654; d 12 December 1729, age 75; m. 27 May 1680, HANNAH KIMBALL (1661-1744).\n\nLieut. STEPHEN (Lt.), b. 6 July 1659; d. at Methuen, MA., 21 May 1741 “in his 81st year, ” m. 13 May 1687, MARY ABBOTT, b. 29 March 1664, daughter of George and Sarah (Farnum) Abbott II “the tailor.”\n\nNotes on Stephen: He is our direct ancestor. He was a Lieutenant in 1723 of the Colonial Militia. He was the pioneer founder of Methuen, MA. He is mentioned in the book “A Busy Man of Methuen.” His marriage to Mary Abbot was the first Church wedding in the Colonies. Before this all marriages were civil marriages per the Pilgrim Compact which was signed by the original Pilgrims on the Mayflower to help constrain the power of the Church in the New World.\n\nBENJAMIN, b. 28 February 1662/3; d. 11 October 1750 “in his 87th year;” m. 2 January 1688/9, HANNAH MARSTON (1667-1733).\n\nI thought it would be interesting to take a side journey into the history of the Barker Family name. I found an interesting disertation online about the family name which I thought I would share. I had always thought that the name was related to a tanner. Someone who striped bark from trees to use in the tanning process. However, I discovered the origins of the name are more interesting. Although, the name does trace itself to that of a tanner as well.\n\nBarker Family of America\n\nThis is the old English Family. Those of its members in the United States who are of colonial ancestry may trace their lineage from eight ancestors according to genealogy research done by Elizabeth Frye Barker. Those ancestors are listed as;\n\nRobert of Plymouth Colony 1628\n\nJohn of Duxbury, Massachusetts 1628\n\nJames of Rhode Island 1634\n\nJames of Rowley, Massachusetts 1638\n\nEdward of Branford, Connecticut 1640\n\nRichard of Andover, Massachusetts 1643 (Ours)\n\nSamuel of Delaware 1682\n\nVirginia Barkers 1700\n\nThe Barkers were for many centuries almost exclusively connected with Shropshire, a county equalled by few others in England as to the number of its old historic families.\n\nFurther notes from Elizabeth Frye Barker who wrote an extensive genealogy of all the Barker lines above in 1927:\n\nName and History\n\nThe name Barker is suppose to come from the Anglo-Saxon word Beorc or from the Anglo-French word Berquier, meaning Shepard, some say the first to use the name was a tanner and used the bark of trees in his trade. Variations of the name are Le Barkere; Barke; Barka and Barkar.\n\nThe family is of Anglo-Saxon origin and has been a very influential and interesting one.\n\nSir Christopher Barker, the Garter King of Arms, assisted at the coronation of Anne Boleyn and Edward VI. Robert Barker made the first edition of the King James version of the\n\nEnglish Bible in 1611. Edmund Barker was a metaphysician and friend of Samuel Johnson. Collet Barker, 1784-1831, was an explorer and Mt. Barker in Australia was named for him. Benjamin Barker was an artist, whose pictures are in the British Museum. Joseph Barker of Leeds, Eng. founded the sect called Barkerites. George Barker was a philanthropist, whose statue is in Birmingham, Eng. Capt James Barker assisted in the victory of the Nile. Sir George Barker fought in the Crimean War.\n\nIn America, many Barkers served in the early wars, over 200 served in the Revolution, more than a dozen were officers in the war of 1812, many more served in the Civil, Spanish, and both World Wars. Some of the most illustrious men were Jacob Barker, the banker and ship owner, Abraham Barker, the “Nestor of Finance”, Wharton Barker, the Bimetallist, Rear-Admiral Albert S Barker U.S.N. Prof George Barker, scientist, Col Thomas Barker, prominent lawyer, Dr Benjamin Fordyce Barker, eminent obstetrical surgeon. So the list goes on of the valiant men and women, who became early settlers in America and bore without complaint their full share of the burdens of this Country, loved liberty and their fellowman, struggled for independence and peace, through every stirring event down to the present day.\n\nBarker Family in England\n\nNotes of origins from research on the internet:\n\nThe name Barker, though not a very common one, made it’s appearance during the thirteenth century in parts of England widely distant from each other, and is not to be supposed that all those who bore it were in any way related to each other. It was probably derived from the office, or rather appointment, of Bercar, a sort of Inspector or Chief Shepard, whose duty it was to superintend the stint of sheep on the common lands of the manor, especially on Manors of the Royal Demesne. One of the copy holders seems to have been chosen by the rest to act in this capacity; in 7 Edward II (1313), for instance, in the Manor of Pattingham, adjacent to Worfield, John de Herdwyke was elected Bercar by the villagers in place of John Lovekyn. BM Add Ms 29.245, fol. 13a. In days when surnames were only gradually becoming hereditary the fact of a man holding this office for several years would be enough to establish it as his name. The only variant spellings which are made with, “Barcar” and “Berker”, in early Claverley documents, both go to confirm this derivation. The first recorded occurrence of the name in Shropshire is in 1292, when one William Barker was an under tenant at Stanton Lacy, but the only Barker families of any standing in the county in later years believed, as will be seen, that the name was not their original one, but had been adopted in place of another by one of their ancestors.\n\nNote: The word Bercar or Barcar as used in the twelfth and following century was an Anglicised form of the Norman-French word Bercher, or shepard, and the term Barkary for a sheepfold lingered till Elizabethan times. From about the fourteen century onward the word Barker was applied to a tanner, and at a still later date it came to mean a barker of trees, but these were comparatively modern uses of the word and only originated after family names had already become established.\n\nThe Barkers of Shropshire (Our family history can be traced to these Barker’s)\n\n“The standard authority for the history of Shropshire families is the collection of manuscript pedigrees based on the Herald’s Visitation of 1584 and 1623, when representatives of such families as claimed the right to bear arms were summoned to appear before a Herald and give account of their ancestry. These pedigrees show five branches of the family of Barker to have been then settled in the county; at Colchurst, Haghmond, Wolverton, Hopton Castle, and Aston respectively; but the Barker’s of Aston cannot have appeared in person, for their genealogy, though begun, is not brought up to date like those of the other branches. The Visitations trace all these five families to a common ancestor, “William Barker alias Coverall,” who married Margaret daughter and heire to Goulston of Goulston and one of his sons is shown as the first Barker of Aston. The pedigrees are almost without dates, but William Barker alias Coverall was about five generations back from those living at the time of the Visatations he must be placed fairly early in the fifteenth century, and all the MSS. concur in stating that he was descended from one Ralph or Randulph de Coverall, (Calverhall) for whom a date is given, 12 Edw II (1319). “Research on Ancestry.com shows Randulph de Coverall being born in Normandy, France in 1082. William the Conqueror became King of England in 1066, so the Barker Family History dates back to the very beginnings of Norman England.”\n\n“As interesting suggestion, which seems to have a bearing on this, occurs in a note contributed by Rev H.B. Smythe to James’ Worfield on the worfe, 1878. ‘In the year 1327,’ he says, ‘one calling himself le Smythe became possessed of property at Hilton in this manor. In that same year another person calling himself le Barker obtained property at Hallon, which too is in the manor. I am inclined to think that these were both assumed names.’ Coming as it does from quite an independent source, this remarkable confirmation of what was evidently the old family legend. Now the Court Rolls of Worfield, on which Mr Smythe’s note was based, show that William Barker (B. III), a grandson of the earlier William le Barker to whom he refers, died at Hallon in 1412, leaving a widow named Margaret or Margery, a person apparently of some consequence, for there was a good deal of discussion about the property to which she was entitled. Twenty-five years later a John Barker who was almost certainly their son, appears at Aston in Claverley, four miles away, where there had not previously been anyone of the name, and putting facts together I think Margaret was probably that ‘daughter and heire to Goulston of Goulston’ whose name was so long remembered by her descendants.”\n\n“It seems then that the early history of the family may have been somewhat as follows. In those tumultuous years when Edward II was fleeing through the West of England from his Queen and his Barons, a son of Ralph de Coverall came from the North to the South of Shropshire, and settled at Hallon, taking, we know not why, the name of le Barker. A hundred years later one of his descendants went to Aston, while another returned to the North, obtaining property at Colchurst, not far from Calverhall or Coverall, where his forefathers had lived, he very naturally assumed the name of Coverall as an alias. Double names were fairly common in the Middle Ages as they are now, but while nowadays the old and new names are hyphened, they were then connected by the word alias for a few generations, after which one or the other was usually dropped. So it was for a time the Barkers of Colchurst and Wolverton in North Shropshire styled themselves alias Coverall, and called their ancestor so at the Visitation, though it does not appear that this designation was ever actually used either at Worfield, Claverley, or Hopton Castle, where it would have had no associations.\n\nIn the Doomsday Book, Nigellus, a clerk, was lord of the manor of Claverhall/Coverhall, after which passed in the king’s hands, and he gave it to William de Dunstaville, who sublet it under the feudal system to these Calverhalls.\n\nRandulph de Calverhall\n\nTenant 1319. Married Margaret, daughter of Peter Pigot, of Willaston, County Salap.\n\n“Then follow several generations of the de Calverhalls, among them Roger de Calverhall, until the male line as tenants of the manor of Calverhall became extinct, and the estate descended to Agnes de Calverhall, daughter and heiress, who married Hugh Dod, of Edge, whose family possessed Calverhall Manor until 1850.” (J.M. Runk)\n\n“But we find in 1327 William le Bercer, at Hallon in Warfield, County Salap. His son Roger le Barker, of Hallon, married Alice …” (J.M. Runk)\n\nRandulph de Calverhall was among the last of the de Calverhall family at Calverhall and it is around this time that the family name is changed to “le Barker” or “Barker”. This seems to coincide with political troubles in the reign of Edward II and later writers speculate that the family fell afoul of the rulers and fled to the south.\n\nIn the reign of Edward II, the overlord of the manor was Bartholomew de Bedlesmere, who was hanged. The undertenants of his manor, sharing in his shame, two of them appear to have fled southward, for in 1327 two men calling themselves le Bercer and le Smythe are found at Hallon and Hilton in the parish of Warfield, where they probably followed the calling of shepherd and armorer respectively, and founded the two Warfield families of Barker and Smythe. Tradition averred that this Bercer was William de Calverhall, and his descendants, when after 200 years they settled again in the northern part of the county, at Calverley, Woverton and Coleshurst, seem to have reassumed the name Coverall, as an alias, so they were known by both names. The name Barker is derived from the old Norman “bercer” which signified the elected herdsmen of the village or manor."
