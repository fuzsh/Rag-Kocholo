        "text": "Biography\n\nFrom http://landedfamilies.blogspot.com/2019/07/384-barker-of-haughmond-...\n\nSunday, 28 July 2019\n\n(384) Barker of Haughmond Abbey and Colehurst Hall\n\nThe history of Hopton Castle is almost equally obscure: William Barker (d. 1590?) was succeeded by his second son John Barker (1553-1607), who became a merchant in Bristol, and Hopton may have been largely unoccupied by the end of the 16th century. In the Civil War it was the scene of one of the most barbaric acts of the conflict, when a Parliamentarian garrison was besieged there and executed after surrendering. The castle was apparently made habitable again after the siege but was finally abandoned about 1700. The Barkers seem to have had no connection with the castle by the time of the Civil War, and remained in Bristol in the 17th century. They were the immediate ancestor of the Barkers (later Raymond-Barkers) of Fairford Park.\n\nBarker, John (1553-1607). Second son of William Barker of Hopton Castle and his wife, baptised at Hopton Castle, 6 January 1553/4. Merchant in Bristol. Sheriff of Bristol, 1594 and Mayor of Bristol, 1607 (but died during his term of office). He married, 28 December 1579 at Marshfield (Glos), Edith (1564-1618), daughter of John Blanchard of Marshfield (Glos), and had issue:\n\n(1) Joyce Barker; married 1st, 8 August 1601, William Bigges, and had issue; m2. 1607, Edward Hayles and m3, before 1623, Andrew Charleton of Apley Castle;\n\n(2) John Barker (1584-1636) (q.v.);\n\n(3) Elizabeth Barker;\n\n(4) William Barker;\n\n(5) Andrew Barker;\n\n(6) Mary Barker; married Richard Longe;\n\n(7) Grace Barker;\n\n(8) Anne Barker;\n\n(9) Robert Barker (b. c.1589); educated at Oriel College, Oxford (matriculated 1604); died without issue;\n\n(10) Thomas Barker; merchant in Bristol; married Sarah, daughter of Richard Hawkins, and had issue three children who were living in 1636; living in 1636.\n\nHe inherited the lease of Hopton Castle from his father but may have given it up.\n\nHe died 13 September 1607; his will was proved 21 November 1607. His widow was buried with her husband at St Werburgh's church, Bristol, 10 November 1618, where they were commemorated by a monument.\n\nReferences"
