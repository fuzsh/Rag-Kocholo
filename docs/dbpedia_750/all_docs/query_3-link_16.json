        "text": "RC (Peter B. Olney, Old Saybrook, Connecticut, 1950); at foot of text: âMr. Church.â PrC (DLC). FC (Lb in DNA: RG 59, DL). Enclosed in TJ to Thomas Pinckney, 12 Dec. 1793.\n\nJohn Barker Church (1748â1818) was a member of Parliament whose wife, Angelica Schuyler Church, was Alexander Hamiltonâs sister-in-law and TJâs faithful correspondent. After going bankrupt as a London grocer in 1774, allegedly because of losses incurred in stock speculation and gambling, Church moved to America and (under the assumed name of John Carter) grew wealthy during the Revolutionary War as a supplier to Continental and French troops. Returning to England in 1783, Church aligned himself with the Whigs, befriending the Prince of Wales and Charles James Fox and representing Wendover in Parliament from 1790 to 1796. In addition to opposing the war with France throughout his parliamentary career, Church became involved in an abortive effort, shortly before he gave up his seat in Parliament in 1796, to help arrange the escape from Prussian captivity of the Marquis de Lafayette, whom he had known since the War for Independence. Moving with his family to New York in 1797, Church engaged in a variety of speculative ventures and fought a duel with Aaron Burr, before finally returning to England for good in 1814 after his wifeâs death (Thorne, Parliament description begins R. G. Thorne, The History of Parliament: The House of Commons, 1790â1820, London, 1986, 5 vols. description ends , iii, 441â3)."
