        "text": "In Swallowfield and Its Owners, published in 1901, Lady Constance Russell (wife of the 4th baronet) presented her marital family home to readers as a quintessentially ‘English’ country house. Tracing Swallowfield’s history seamlessly from the Norman Conquest to the Victorian era, her volume embedded this Berkshire country house into a continuous narrative of English state formation by underlining its connection to a succession of medieval and Renaissance kings, queens and statesmen. Granted as dowry to Elizabeth of York by Henry VII, Lady Russell noted, Swallowfield was held in succession by five of Henry VIII’s six wives. The present-day house, built by the Tory earl Clarendon in the seventeenth century, was later improved by the king’s own architect, and served as a royalist bastion into the eighteenth century, a persistent association with the English monarchy which Lady Russell repeatedly underlined. Like her chapter on ‘Swallowfield and the Dowry of Tudor Queens’, her concluding chapter on ‘Some Old Customs and Antiquities of Swallowfield’ suggested that the home’s biography exemplified the history of merry England.1 This insular, ‘island’ history of Swallowfield persists to the present day. Marketing materials for the luxury flats carved out of the estate in the twentieth century continue to advertise Swallowfield as a ‘classic’, ‘historic’ and ‘traditional’ oasis of English country life.2 Described by managing agents Sunley Heritage (itself an evocative name) as ‘A Home with a History’, Swallowfield in the twenty-first century presents a simulacrum of establishment England, a house whose emphatically national heritage is constituted by ‘Politics and Nobility’ (see Figure 10.1).3\n\nFigure 10.1Swallowfield Park. © Brian Steptoe, FRPS. Source: Historic England Archive.\n\nThis imagined island history, shorn of both European and imperial referents, effaces global connections that have shaped this stately home for generations. For, as Lady Russell was well aware, Swallowfield’s English history had been closely intertwined with British imperial expansion since the early eighteenth century. In 1719, Thomas ‘Diamond’ Pitt (1653–1726) purchased the estate. He had secured a vast private fortune by illegal trade in India, and sought to launder this Indian wealth through judicious investment in English landed estates.4 Pitt’s acquisition set an imperial precedent at Swallowfield that persisted into the nineteenth century. The estate passed from East Indian to West Indian hands in 1788, when Timothy Hare Earle (1737–1816) acquired Swallowfield for his family. In her 1901 history, Lady Russell passed discretely over the source of Earle’s wealth, noting only that he had inherited property on St Kitts and that his son later sold Swallowfield ‘in consequence of the depreciation of West India property’.5 We know, however, from the UCL Legacies of British Slave-ownership project database that Earle was a substantial slave-owner: when emancipation was enacted in 1834, he received over £3,600 from Parliament – or, just under £3 million in current money – as compensation for his loss of his property in 187 enslaved persons.6 The ‘depreciation of West India property’ to which Lady Russell so delicately alluded followed directly on from Parliament’s abolition of the British slave trade in 1807. The excision of slavery from Swallowfield’s history in her text reflects much wider patterns of selective amnesia that have shaped British history writing, and British historical consciousness more broadly, since the abolition of Caribbean slavery in the 1830s.7\n\nThe Russell family’s purchase of Swallowfield from Earle in 1820 ensured that this ‘English’ home would remain tightly bound to empire throughout the Victorian era. Men and women whose two-fold investment in English and global domestic life spanned three generations, the Russells of Swallowfield illustrate many of the key themes and questions that shape this volume. Henry (later Sir Henry) Russell (1751–1836) was the son of a middling Kentish merchant. He rose – through imperial service in India – to great wealth and status, shedding his mercantile origins to secure (for himself and his sons) positions within both the British state apparatus and English country-house society. Russell’s appointment to the Supreme Court of Calcutta in 1797 allowed him to amass a prodigious private fortune, and to establish three of his sons in the lucrative service of the East India Company (EIC). Sir Henry Russell’s eldest son, also named Henry (1783–1852), served in the civil and political service of the Company from 1797 until 1820, assisted at Hyderabad for many years by his brother Charles (1786–1856). A younger brother Frank Russell (1790–1852) joined his siblings in the Company’s employment in 1806 as a Bengal civil servant, and died at Chittagong; his son and namesake Francis Whitworth Russell (1829–72) died at Jubbulpore, a Major in the Bengal army. The 1st baronet’s wife, Lady Russell (1764–1814), also participated actively in the family’s imperial project, bearing the last two of Sir Henry’s ten children in Calcutta, before returning to England to begin the couple’s search for an appropriate home, a country house in which the family intended their new private fortune (and the power it conferred) to be made publically manifest.8\n\nIn all this, Swallowfield Park is an archetypal English country estate. Now converted from a single-family residence into luxury flats, Swallowfield Park’s stately home illustrates a longstanding country house tradition that has adapted in successive centuries to major changes in Britain’s economic, social, cultural and political landscape. Its architecture and history are caught up in the events that saw England emerge from the seventeenth century as a parliamentary democracy. Yet the evolving biography of this family seat was also fundamentally shaped by its entanglement with a wider British colonial world in which – contemporary Britons alleged – ‘Oriental’ exoticism and despotism held sway. In what follows, I situate Swallowfield within this broad imperial context by tracing the estate’s acquisition and transformation in the late Georgian and early Victorian periods. Purchased by Sir Henry Russell, 1st baronet, in 1820, Swallowfield was remodelled, redecorated and recreated in the following decades by its new proprietor’s eldest son, Henry (later the 2nd baronet). The Russells’ purchase of Swallowfield attests to the crucial role played by Britain’s empire in underpinning country house society, culture and politics in late Georgian England.9 The strategic refurbishment of Swallowfield by the 2nd baronet in the 1830s and 1840s highlights the role of men in fashioning the imperial domestic interior and reminds us of the salience of European art and design in the construction of ‘English’ interiors.10 The aesthetic and social histories of the house attest to the use of Indian capital, material culture and built environments by Company men and women to entrench their status and privilege as white Europeans within the imperial order. They also forcefully illustrate the stratagems deployed by Company families to conceal selected aspects of their Indian histories, and to police the racialized boundaries of the family circle. Viewed alongside our new understanding of the entwined histories of Caribbean slavery and the country house,11 a global and colonial analysis of Swallowfield allows this stately home’s ‘Englishness’ to be seen both as a material manifestation of imperial wealth and as the product of an ongoing process marked by the sublimation and erasure of imperial power.12\n\nSwallowfield before the Russells\n\nThe royal associations so lovingly detailed by Lady Russell in the first chapters of Swallowfield and Its Owners persisted beyond the Tudor era, growing entangled in the eighteenth century with the biographies of statesmen whose wealth and power extended beyond England and Europe to imperial theatres of war and empire. Present-day Swallowfield house was built in 1689–91 by Henry Hyde, the second earl of Clarendon (1638–1709), replacing the Tudor mansion of the alchemist and antiquary William Backhouse (1593–1662). In these early decades, the home’s history lay largely within the confines of an English narrative of English history. Clarendon had taken as his second wife William Backhouse’s daughter, the heiress Flower Backhouse (1641–1700). Owing debts of over £19,000, the second earl sold lands (eventually including the Hyde family seat, Cornbury) to stave off his creditors, and retreated to his wife’s estate at Swallowfield to reduce his expenditure. Through its connection with Clarendon, seventeenth-century Swallowfield was associated with both the Court party and the Stuart cause. As an infant, Henry Hyde had been taken into continental exile by his parents after the royalist defeat in the Civil War. His subsequent political career, with only a few short-lived departures, was staunchly royalist. Having declined to accept the new regime imposed by the Glorious Revolution of 1689, Clarendon was imprisoned in the Tower by William III in 1690 and 1691.13\n\nDenied a place in parliamentary politics by his continued allegiance to the Stuart cause, Clarendon turned to the consolations of domestic architecture. In replacing the existing Tudor mansion at Swallowfield with a new country house, he chose William Talman (c.1650–1719) as his architect. Talman, who as comptroller of the king’s works undertook Hampton Court Palace’s interior decoration, has been described as ‘the leading country house architect of the late seventeenth century, responsible for some of the most innovative and influential designs of the period’. He is now known for producing ‘a group of relatively plain Renaissance-style houses’ that includes Swallowfield. Talman was also the architect of Holywell House, St Albans (which he built for John and Sarah Churchill in c.1686), of Richard Lumley’s Stanstead Park, Sussex (built from 1686 to 1690) and of Uppark, also in Sussex (built for Ford Grey in c.1690). A small vestibule at Swallowfield is now the only surviving Talman interior. Other country houses that bear the impress of Talman’s hand include Burghley House, Northamptonshire and Chatsworth House, Derbyshire.14\n\nIf its association with the Hyde family connected Swallowfield to England’s tumultuous transition from Stuart absolutism to constitutional monarchy, the eighteenth century initiated its protracted association with British rule in India. In 1719 Swallowfield passed from Tory into emphatically Whig hands with its purchase by the politician and nouveau riche Indian merchant Thomas Pitt (1653–1726).15 Born in Dorset, Pitt gained notoriety for his opposition to the EIC’s trade monopoly in Asia. He first set sail for India in 1673, and rapidly became a successful interloper in the Company’s developing commercial empire – much to the chagrin of the Court of Directors. Having returned to England in the 1680s, Pitt was elected MP for Old Sarum, and lambasted the Company’s monopoly over Indian trade from the safety of his seat in the House of Commons. He journeyed back to India as an interloping merchant in 1693, forcing the Company’s directors to reconcile themselves to his commercial presence on the subcontinent. Although Pitt remained estranged from many senior EIC figures, he secured appointment by the Company in the late 1690s as Governor of Fort St George at Madras (present-day Chennai).16\n\nFrom his base in Madras, Pitt accumulated a vast fortune, a process of enrichment perhaps best exemplified by his purchase from an Indian merchant in 1702 of a 410-carat diamond.17 Acquired for £20,400 and shipped to England to be cut and sold for profit, this gem initially proved a vexing investment. Warfare had disrupted the European diamond market, and Pitt (who sailed from India for Europe in 1709) succeeded in selling his Indian jewel only in 1717. The Pitt diamond, purchased for £125,000 by the Regent of France, came to adorn the French crown, was worn by Marie Antoinette and later decorated Napoleon I’s sword. In the meantime, profits from his lucrative Indian commercial dealings and the sale of his diamond had allowed Pitt, the son of a Dorset rector, to purchase extensive estates that stretched from Cornwall to Westminster. Shortly after the sale of his Indian gemstone, Thomas ‘Diamond’ Pitt established himself as a Berkshire country gentleman at Swallowfield. He died there in 1726, leaving this new country seat to his son Robert (c.1680–1727), who like his father had traded as a free merchant in Madras before settling in the Berkshire countryside. Intrepid trader and Whig politician, Pitt in India had laid the foundations of a political dynasty that was to include two Georgian prime ministers: his grandson William Pitt, first earl Chatham (1708–78) and his great-grandson William Pitt the Younger (1759–1806).18 This was a lineage – at once domestic and imperial, and marked by the Pitt family’s successful transition from mercantile interlopers to revered statesmen – which Lady Russell in 1901 was happy to own for her home. Her history of Swallowfield devotes four chapters to Governor Pitt and his progeny – including one chapter dedicated to the Pitt Diamond – notwithstanding Lady Russell acknowledged that Pitt’s business dealings for the Company lacked a scrupulous regard for honour.19\n\nThe Russells in India: Anglo-Indian tastes\n\nSwallowfield changed hands several times in the Georgian era, and its link to Britain’s expanding Indian empire was temporarily broken. The Pitt family sold the estate in 1737, reportedly for £20,770; in 1783, Sylvanus Bevan purchased Swallowfield from Colonel John Dodd. It was Bevan who sold the estate in 1788, to the Caribbean plantation owner Timothy Hare Earle, reconnecting Swallowfield to Britain’s imperial networks. His son, Timothy Hare Altabon Earle (1779–1836), inherited Swallowfield in 1816. Earle’s fortune declined as West Indian wealth depreciated in the early nineteenth-century. Swallowfield’s lands were enclosed in 1817, an agrarian strategy calculated to drive up its landlord’s profits.20 But in 1820 – when Earle, a staunch royalist, served as sheriff of Berkshire – the combination of a declining fortune and an extravagant lifestyle forced Swallowfield’s sale. Earle retired to a dower-house near Wokingham, where he died in 1836, shortly after Parliament awarded him compensation of over £3,600 for loss of his property in 187 enslaved persons on St Kitts.21\n\nWith its sale by Timothy Hare Altabon Earle to the Russell family, Swallowfield’s imperial associations reverted from the West to the East Indies, a development that exemplifies the broader ‘swing to the East’ within the British empire in the aftermath of the loss of the American colonies.22 Sir Henry Russell, 1st baronet (1751–1836) had been born in Dover, the son of a merchant. Educated at Charterhouse and Cambridge, Russell trained in the law at Lincoln’s Inn. His legal ability and a strategic marriage combined to raise his social aspirations and economic prospects. In 1782, as a widower, Russell took as his second wife Anne Barbara Whitworth (d. 1814), the youngest daughter of Sir Charles Whitworth (c.1721–78) and sister to Charles, Earl Whitworth (1752–1825). In 1797 Russell was knighted and appointed a judge of the Bengal Supreme Court, launching his family into an imperial sphere they would continue to occupy for generations.23\n\nIndia was the making of the Russell family. The judge reached Bengal in 1798, where his eldest son Henry (1783–1852) took up an appointment in the Company’s civil service. The younger Russell children remained in England, but Lady Russell (having given birth to her eighth child in December 1797) set sail for Bengal with her nieces Mary Lloyd and Rose Aylmer (1779–1800) in tow – both joining the so-called ‘fishing fleet’ of nubile British daughters who tried their fortunes on the colonial marriage market.24 The reunited Russells now settled in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata), where the street on which they lived continues to bear their name.25 The couple’s two youngest children were born in India. Rose Aylmer (1800–89) was named to commemorate her cousin, who had died of a tropical fever before she could secure a husband, and George Lake (b. 1802) was named for the first Viscount Lake of Delhi (1744–1808), commander-in-chief of the army in India and a distant relation.26 Two further sons later joined their father in Bengal. Charles Russell (1786–1856) had arrived at his parents’ Calcutta home by 1802, a cadet in the Company’s Bengal army. Their third son, the feckless Francis Whitworth Russell (1790–1852), was appointed to the Bengal civil service in 1808, and remained in India, with only short sojourns home, until his death.27\n\nThe processes by which the Russells’ Indian careers shaped their engagement with English country house culture are complex and multi-layered. By the time they returned to Britain, Sir Henry and his eldest sons were so-called ‘nabobs’, officials whose access to Asian wealth allowed them to construct new identities through the acquisition and use of new built environments and a global array of material goods.28 High salaries, gifts from ‘Oriental’ potentates and opportunities for commercial profit swelled the family’s coffers in India, laying the financial foundations upon which Swallowfield’s purchase and refurbishment would later rest. From 1798 until his departure for England in 1813, Sir Henry presided over his often-distant family from his home in Chowringhee, Calcutta. His eldest son, Henry, was appointed assistant to the Resident of Hyderabad in 1800. (The Resident was the Company’s political agent to the Hyderabad court, whose ruler was the Nizam of Hyderabad). Henry’s career later took him to Madras (Chennai), where he married his first wife, Jane Casamaijor (1789–1808) and furnished his first marital home in 1808.29 After a brief interval in Poona (Pune), he was appointed Resident at Hyderabad, where his brother Charles served as his assistant until 1819. Their mother’s return to England with the two youngest Russell children in 1804 connected Henry and Charles closely to London’s metropolitan consumer markets during their prolonged residence in India, as did the in-laws acquired through Henry’s first marriage. At home in England, Lady Russell travelled between a succession of rented English country homes, spa towns and London dwellings with her younger children while awaiting Sir Henry’s return. This peripatetic life allowed the family to sample a wide array of rural retreats and town houses prior to the purchase of Swallowfield in 1820, notwithstanding the Russell men’s residence in India.\n\nColonial Calcutta was a vast emporium of luxury goods in this period. Ships’ captains purchased fashionable items in London for resale to Europeans in Calcutta, while skilled Indian craftsmen manufactured not only ‘native’ textiles and furnishings but also imitations of European luxuries and products in which European and ‘Oriental’ components were melded.30 Auction houses plied a lively trade in both new items of fashion and second-hand goods – left behind by Company servants returning home, or released for sale by less fortunate men and women, who succumbed each year to the tropical climate.31 In this burgeoning consumer culture, the Russells developed sophisticated and demanding consumer tastes, which they would later elaborate at Swallowfield. The family’s domestic life in India centred around three urban hubs: Calcutta, Hyderabad and Madras. Employment in Madras, Poona and Hyderabad exposed the brothers to south Indian craftsmanship and familiarized them with the consumer markets of Bombay (Mumbai). The return of first Sir Henry and then his two eldest sons to England between 1814 and 1820, moreover, was swiftly followed by their departure for Europe on shopping expeditions to Paris, Rome, Venice, Florence and other European centres of fine art, trade and industry. Recorded in exceptional detail in the letters that passed between the far-flung family members, Swallowfield’s formation as the Russells’ English family seat was a global, not a national, collective family enterprise.\n\nSir Henry’s house in Calcutta functioned as a clearinghouse for goods sent to and from his sons in south India. It was through this channel that Henry and Charles received fashionable goods from their kinfolk in England, and through this conduit too that the brothers sent gifts of Asian luxuries to their political patrons at home. When Charles first arrived in Calcutta in 1802, Henry promptly wrote from Hyderabad to discover whether his sibling had brought him any fashionable European goods, and to enquire whether their aunt, Lady Aylmer, had received his gift of Oriental fans.32 Equipping his sons with appropriate domestic goods as they established their imperial careers was a task that Sir Henry took seriously. When Charles was appointed to a junior post in Hyderabad in 1804, his father sent him household items by sea from Calcutta. The list of these goods underlines the Russells’ ambitions to genteel status: it included a writing table, a chest of drawers, a stand for a chillumchee (basin for washing hands), a looking glass, book shelves and language and history books. Alive to the tendency of young Company men to succumb to the allure of the Indian marketplace and fall into debt, Sir Henry admonished Charles that from this time he must financially ‘be on your own bottom’.33\n\nHenry Russell’s brief interval of employment in Madras saw furniture and matrimony come to the forefront of his sensibilities.34 By the early nineteenth century, colonial Madras had both a flourishing marriage market and a thriving consumer culture inspired by conceptions of fashionable gentility.35 Charles suspected his brother of harbouring matrimonial intentions when Henry wrote requesting him to send ‘the large Bed, with the Bedding, [and] the net Counterpane’ which he had left behind in Hyderabad. Henry acknowledged that ‘The Precision of my Orders about the Bedding and Irish Net was certainly very suspicious’, but hastened to deny that these instructions were a token of his intentions toward ‘the charming Jane’ Casamaijor, the daughter of a senior Company civil servant.36 In the event, in October Jane and Henry indeed married, and settled into a home that Henry had furnished with lavish abandon. Jane’s agonizing death a few weeks later led to Henry’s dispersal of these marital goods, which reminded him too painfully of her. In January 1809 he wrote to Charles announcing the imminent sale of his furniture and plate. Subsequent letters detailed his sale of items that were the height of Madras fashion at the time, blending European motifs with the current craze for all things Egyptian. The list of goods Henry disposed of underscores the importance of colonial consumption in shaping Company men’s domestic tastes. Items sold by Henry included 12 black varnished chairs with a red Etruscan border, a 12-foot long ottoman covered in chintz, a bookcase with Egyptian bronze figures, two couches in the Egyptian style and ‘a pair of the newest fashioned Sofa Tables on Pillar Legs inlaid with Brass and fitted up with Brass Ornaments’.37 These items, combining goods crafted from Indian and African materials with new fashions current in Europe, illustrate the cosmopolitan markets in which Company men’s concepts of the domestic interior were formed, far from their English homes, and yet enmeshed in intimate, familial households which boasted close ties to European markets.38\n\nHyderabad, where Charles and Henry resided together for nearly a decade after Henry’s appointment as Resident in 1810, afforded the brothers a rich canvas for interior design. A princely state renowned for its wealth, exceptionally rich material culture, craftsmanship and political intrigue, Hyderabad state was a key cog in the Company’s subsidiary alliance system, its autonomy increasingly under the Company’s sway in Russell’s day.39 It was here that the brothers developed a dynamic and enduring partnership, carefully calculated to deploy material culture to establish their family’s social status and political power. Although Hyderabad’s fortunes were on the wane, the city and its surrounding state remained a vital centre of wealth, luxury and Company diplomacy. Its opulence fed in part by the diamond trade, Hyderabad was known for its rich bazaars and elegant pleasure gardens. The British Residency was located opposite the old city, across the river Musi. Both Henry and Charles had first served at Hyderabad during the Residency of James Achilles Kirkpatrick (1764–1805; Resident 1797–1805). At the outset of Kirkpatrick’s tenure, the Residency complex was a disorderly assemblage of buildings. Poorly constructed and rapidly deteriorating, the Resident’s two-storey house was surrounded by the many bungalows of his staff, each including a zenana wing to house the men’s Indian wives, concubines, children, servants and slaves. Kirkpatrick himself, scandalously, had not only settled with but married a Hyderabadi Muslim noblewoman, Begum Khair un-Nissa (1786–1813), with whom he had two children.40\n\nIn 1800, Kirkpatrick conceived an ambitious building campaign which, within a few years, transformed the Residency into a Palladian palace notable for its combination of European and Indian stylistic elements. Gardens laid out along conventional Mughal lines surrounded a capacious zenana; a veranda surrounded the Resident’s new house, which boasted a durbar hall for which Kirkpatrick ordered a carpet measuring 60 by 30 feet. But the Residency’s new structures, ornamentation and furnishings also emphatically pronounced the Britishness of the Company’s waxing power in Hyderabad. Its classical Palladian exterior commanded a deer park overlooked by a pediment carved with the East India Company’s arms. The house itself boasted a grand salon, a gallery with a painted ceiling and an elaborate chandelier reputedly sold to the Company by the Prince of Wales.41\n\nDelayed by business at Poona, Henry Russell took up residence at Hyderabad only in 1811. In the intervening months Charles assumed oversight of the Residency’s refurbishment. The question of whether to amplify or repress the Residency’s Mughal stylistic motifs occupied them both in these months. Kirkpatrick’s immediate successor as Resident had sought to reduce the Residency’s close links with Hyderabadi culture – earlier enhanced by Kirkpatrick’s liaison with Khair un-Nissa – in keeping with Company pressure to expunge visible evidence of this scandalous alliance.42 Henry Russell was awkwardly placed in this context. After Kirkpatrick’s death and prior to his own first marriage, he had begun an intimate relationship with Khair himself. He remained in contact with her and her female relatives for years thereafter, but – intent to conceal this relationship from his superiors in the Company service – used Charles as his intermediary.43 At Hyderabad, Henry (like Kirkpatrick before him) insisted on adherence to strict Indian caste rules in the Residency kitchens.44 But Russell, newly rich and immensely ambitious, was keen to stamp the Residency with an elite European impress. He wrote to Charles that he was willing to pay his predecessor a thousand pounds for his library, and was also happy to purchase his sporting prints. He also ordered vast quantities of new furnishings from Calcutta’s select emporia. On 29 August 1810, Henry informed Charles that as the Residency’s alterations reached completion he had resolved to purchase ‘an entirely new Set of Furniture adapted to it from Calcutta’ and wished to have Charles’s advice on its selection. The acquisition of fashionable European goods threw Henry upon the mercy of his Casamaijor in-laws. He remitted £3,500 to Elizabeth Casamaijor (his late wife’s mother, herself enmeshed in the Company’s metropolitan patronage networks) in London, and reported happily in 1812 that she had despatched busts, glassware and china to him on the William Beasley and City of London. The goods were shipped to Madras, to be forwarded to Henry in Hyderabad by his deceased wife’s father, yet another example of the key roles played by family and in-laws in mediating colonial consumer and patronage relations.45\n\nThe furnishings selected by Henry were not uniformly European. His prints of fox-hunting, for example, were complemented in the Residency by pictures depicting scenes from the Arabian Nights. But European styles and motifs increasingly supplanted Kirkpatrick’s more cosmopolitan furnishings. Notwithstanding his privileged access through his Company connections to the luxury products of Jingdezhen, Henry commissioned his mother-in-law to send him British chinaware, a shift from Chinese to domestic porcelain that reflected new trends in English taste.46 Henry’s new Hyderabad furniture included gilt chairs, ‘splendid beyond anything I could conceive’, as he wrote to Charles, while ‘Wilton’s Vases are very elegant, and exquisitely worked’. The Residency’s library projected with particular force Henry’s determination to be numbered among the empire’s gentlemanly elite. Forty feet long, it included busts of the ‘Ancients’ on one side and the ‘Moderns’ on another. Here the knowledge systems that underpinned colonial power were encapsulated not in the Islamic and Hindu texts revered by earlier Company men such as William ‘Oriental’ Jones (1746–94), but instead in sculptures that depicted Aristotle, Homer, Cicero, Shakespeare, Milton, Newton, Locke, Burke, Fox and Pitt.47\n\nFamily portraits were an integral part of the furnishing of Georgian country houses, items of material culture that allowed men and women of new wealth to inscribe the walls of their homes with venerable family lineages, of varying degrees of fiction or veracity.48 Portraits specifically commissioned by Henry for the Residency both enhanced its European emphasis and reminded visitors that the Russells were now a powerful and well-connected imperial clan. In 1812 Henry commissioned George Chinnery (1774–1852), the premier society artist of colonial Calcutta in this period, to paint a portrait of Sir Henry for the Residency – an image that remains at Swallowfield today. He supplemented memorial portraits of Jane Casamaijor with images of her surviving female kinfolk, commissioned together with portraits of Henry’s mother and sisters.49\n\nBy the time that Henry (in considerable disgrace) left Hyderabad for England in 1820, the Residency had gained international renown for its magnificence. Its splendour was celebrated in many engravings, lithographs and watercolours in the following years, a reputation that Henry was keen to burnish.50 Life in Calcutta and at the Hyderabad Residency set a high bar for the Russell family in England: Sir Henry’s letters to his wife during his visit to his sons in Hyderabad, immediately prior to his return to England in 1813, exulted in the opulence, status and power exemplified in their Residency life. His reception at Hyderabad had reduced him to tears. Mounted on an elephant, Sir Henry was greeted solemnly at the Residency gate by a band playing ‘God Save the King’. Describing the Residency as ‘a most magnificent palace’, he observed rhetorically: ‘Who could have believed that I, who started from such an humble origin, should ever witness such a scene; that I should ever be of Rank enough to be received with such Honors, [sic] & that my own Son should pay them.’51 Establishing an English country seat that could match their lavish Indian homes would tax the Russell men’s financial and cultural capital heavily in the next quarter of a century.\n\nTesting the English market\n\nUntil recently, historians have paid little attention to women’s role in shaping country house culture in England, but it was Lady Russell who led the first stage of the family’s protracted migration from their elite residences on the subcontinent to the stately home.52 She sailed from India in the Preston in 1804, taking with her the two youngest children and two female Indian servants (known in the family as ‘Black Mary’ and Anne Ayah, albeit the latter was re-named Mrs Williams when she began to serve as a lady’s maid in England).53 In the decade before Sir Henry joined her, Lady Russell established a succession of transient households for her five daughters and three youngest sons in London, Bath, Tunbridge Wells, Dover, Walmer (a convenient spot for smuggling goods from India ashore) and the countryside. By spring 1806, assisted by her brother Whitworth, she had taken an extended lease on a house at Hookwood, Surrey, surrounded by several acres of garden.54 A few months later, she and her family were residing in town, occupying a small rented house in Park Lane opposite the Grosvenor Gate and adjacent to the residence of a Whitworth aunt. The Park Lane house had been taken to allow the Russells’ eldest daughter, Anne (d. 1808) to be presented at Court, an essential step in the family’s campaign to secure their status within the upper classes. Her younger sons’ fortunes were cultivated by ensuring that they enjoyed privileged access to her brother Whitworth, by being placed in schools near his stately home in Kent, Knole.55\n\nComplaints from Sir Henry in India about the excessive cost of Lady Russell’s peripatetic lifestyle in England were a leitmotif in the couple’s correspondence. She wrote to Charles in 1809 about her chronic worry regarding ‘money concerns: they so much vex and hurt me that at times I feel entirely wretched’.56 A month later, she took her children to visit their uncle Whitworth at Buckhurst Park, his East Sussex estate. Here her younger sons enjoyed their uncle’s largesse, prompting their mother to write to India to petition her second eldest son for Indian shawls, luxury items that figured prominently in the family’s patronage networks.57 In 1811, she took a house near Knole at Riverhead, Kent, but this proved only a temporary settlement. By 1813 Lady Russell was based in London at Baker Street, but informed Sir Henry that she had taken a lease on a house and stables at Clifton for £350 per annum. It was from the Clifton residence that she reported to her husband how much her London friends had admired the family portraits she had sent to Henry in Hyderabad. Clifton too, however, proved only a temporary way-station. Caroline Russell wrote to her brother Charles in 1814, shortly before their mother’s death, that she had taken a three-year lease on Cannon Hill, a large villa with a park five miles from Windsor Castle.58 This was the family’s first step into the ‘English Hindoostan’ of Berkshire, home to so many returned Company nabobs.59\n\nSir Henry sailed for England in the Metcalfe, which departed Calcutta on 13 December 1813. His reunion with his wife, who died on 1 August 1814, was only brief. For the next several years he headed a household at 62, Wimpole Street, London that – until their marriages – included his four surviving daughters, Caroline (1792–1869), Kate (1795–1845), Henrietta (b. 1797) and Rose (1800–89). His two youngest sons, the clergyman William Whitworth Russell (1795–1847) and the lawyer George Lake Russell (b. 1802), visited at Wimpole Street when not absent at school or university. Sir Henry, who had critiqued his wife’s apparent extravagance in England from his base in Calcutta, was shocked to learn at firsthand about the cost of genteel English life. In January 1816, he wrote to Charles that ‘the expense of living in England is not to be conceived: the furnishing my House, which I have done elegantly; & the portioning [that is, the allocation of a marriage settlement to] Kate, which I must do liberally, have reduced my Finances very much: but by keeping as much of my property as can be prudently kept, at Hyderabad, at 12 [%]‌ … Interest, I hope in a short time to be recruited’.60 His descriptions of the furnishing of the house at Wimpole Street help to explain Sir Henry’s perceptions of the high cost of living in London. Returned to England after years of service on the subcontinent, Sir Henry promptly took his daughters to the continent to shop.61 The house at Wimpole Street, he wrote to Charles, ‘is magnificently furnished; the clocks, candelabras, & vases, which we brought from Paris, added to the Ebony Chairs, crimson & gold curtains … large Mirrors, & several beautiful cabinets, make it really very superb & the taste of Caroline has preserved aptness & uniformity in the colouring’.62 Eschewing Asiatic commodities for French furnishings was a sensible strategy for Sir Henry’s re-immersion in Georgian culture and society. Caricatures of the tastelessness and effeminacy of ‘Oriental’ excess were widely pervasive in English literature and culture.63 Significantly however, it was his Indian investments – Hyderabad’s 12 per cent interest rate far outpaced returns of 3–4 per cent on the London markets – that funded Russell’s European expenditure.\n\nAlthough Sir Henry settled in London, neither he nor his eldest sons had abandoned their collective intention to translate their Indian fortunes into English landed estates. To the contrary, Sir Henry’s elevation to a Baronetcy and appointment to the Privy Council expanded their ambitions to join the governing elite. In 1813 he had written to his wife that he intended to combine his wealth with that of his sons: Sir Henry proposed to pay £100,000, his son Henry £60,000 and Charles £40,000, with the rents divided proportionately.64 Henry Russell was reluctant to return to England from Hyderabad until he could ensure an annual income of £3,000, which he estimated would require an investment in land of £80,000. Desire for wealth vied with social ambition in Henry’s investment calculations. The yield on government bonds was greater than that on land, but gentility held sway over mere profits as he contemplated his return to England: ‘I had rather have 3,000 a Year in Landed Property, than 5,000 in the Funds’, he wrote to Sir Henry in 1815.65\n\nHenry Russell’s second marriage, to a Catholic woman from the French royalist enclave of colonial Pondicherry, significantly complicated these plans. Solemnized in Hyderabad in 1816, this was the second marriage Henry had undertaken precipitously and without his father’s consent. As a union with a French Catholic, it presented obstacles to his establishment as an English gentleman of the governing elite at home, where the campaigns for the inclusion of Catholics within the political nation were to generate internecine political conflict in the 1820s and 1830s. Henry broke the news of his second marriage to his father with a characteristic combination of bravado and emotional blackmail. ‘My Marriage will hardly affect the Amount of my Fortune, or require me, on that Account, to stay longer in India than I otherwise should have done’, he wrote to Sir Henry in October 1816. ‘But when I find that you are estranged, and that your Door will be shut against me, I shall have lost one of the strongest inducements I had to return to England, and shall probably therefore remain more years at Hyderabad, and amass a greater Fortune, than I have hitherto intended.’66\n\nClotilde Mottet (c.1795–1872) bore Henry four children in rapid succession in India, of whom two (Henry and Anne) survived to sail with the couple for England in 1820. Notwithstanding his initial shock at this union, Sir Henry was readily reconciled to his new daughter-in-law (not least because she bore him several grandsons), and the purchase of country seats again moved to the forefront of the Russells’ ambitions. Sir Henry had contemplated the acquisition of Summer Hill estate (near Tunbridge Wells, one of his wife’s many resting-places on her transit through town and countryside upon returning to England) for £125,000 in 1815, but ultimately decided against the purchase.67 He also sought to negotiate the purchase of Gosfield Hall in Essex for £120,000, but the Duke of Buckingham had insisted on 150,000 guineas, and this sale too was unsuccessful.68\n\nWhile his father debated the merits of properties such as these, Henry Russell and his wife plunged into fashionable European consumer markets (see Figure 10.2). Throughout the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, aristocratic collectors had continued to acquire French furniture for their country houses, with bronze statuary and boulle veneer marquetry – often embellished with ‘Oriental’ motifs – especially prominent among their purchases.69 January 1822 saw Henry write to Charles from Paris, where he and Clotilde had already begun to purchase furnishings for their prospective home. Here Henry acquired bronze horses for 1,500 francs and a chest of drawers for 500 francs, holding back from other purchases only because he lacked a house in which to put them. As in Hyderabad, he relied on Charles for aesthetic advice. ‘I wait for your Opinion before I decide whether to buy some pieces of very fine Bowle [sic: boulle] Furniture which are for sale here’, he wrote to Charles, concluding with instructions for a vase, adorned with an elephant’s head, that he had commissioned to be made in London.70\n\nFigure 10.2Sir Henry Russell, 2nd Baronet, by Sir Francis Leggatt Chantry. © National Portrait Gallery, London.\n\nBack in England, Henry and Clotilde joined the landed gentry, if only vicariously, when they took a lease on Sutton Park, Bedfordshire in 1822. The family seat of the Burgoyne family, Sutton Park was connected to both the North American and the Indian empire through its proprietors’ military service. The 7th baronet, Sir John Burgoyne (1739–85), had been a cavalry officer in India in the 1780s, marrying and dying in the Madras Presidency.71 Sutton Park’s material culture provided Henry with an object lesson in the successful assimilation of imperial wealth into a genteel English landed lineage. ‘The place that we have taken belongs to the family of the Burgoynes, and has … for generations’, he wrote to a friend in Hyderabad. ‘They are one of the oldest Families in England: the Hall is lined with the Pictures of their Ancestors.’ Costing Henry only £300 per annum, the house was also ideally placed to preserve his links with the families that had provided him with powerful political patronage in India. Its location near the Great Northern Road made Sutton Park a convenient staging post for the family of the late Gilbert Elliot, first Earl Minto (1751–1814) – who as Governor General had promoted Henry to the Hyderabad Residency, and whose son John Elliott had married Jane Casamaijor’s sister, Amelia – as they travelled between London and their family seat in the Scottish Borders, Minto. ‘The Dowager Lady Minto, when she was coming here, actually drove past the Park, not thinking it possible such a place to be had for so low a rent as she knew I paid’, Henry observed. ‘The habits of Country life too are much more like those of India, and I do not like them a bit the less on that Account’, he concluded with satisfaction.72\n\nSwallowfield and its reformation\n\nIf Sutton Park served to whet Henry Russell’s appetite for settled life as an English country gentleman, the purchase of Swallowfield in 1820 finally brought this aspiration to fruition.73 He moved his family to Reading and then to Brighton while extensive renovations were undertaken at Swallowfield.74 Yet again, Charles stepped in to supervise renovations and furnishing in Henry’s absence. In October 1826 he wrote to Henry to describe designs for Swallowfield’s mantelpieces and statuary prepared by the London tradesman Atkinson, and debated the relative merits of Sienna and black and gold marble for the dining room.75 Soft furnishings for Swallowfield preoccupied Charles a month later. Cotton fabrics that a century before had been exotic luxury handicrafts imported from India to England were now available at short notice from domestic British manufactories. Charles wrote that their supplier had sent Henry ‘a parcel of patterns of chintz for bed furniture. If you like them, but would prefer them in other colours, they can be printed in any colour you please, in the course of three weeks’, he marvelled.76\n\nAlthough new British manufactures were often appealing, his increasingly cosmopolitan knowledge of the luxury market often caused Charles concern. As the family increasingly familiarized itself with French fashions – a development assisted by visits to Clotilde’s Parisian relations – a preference for continental material culture increasingly challenged the brothers’ British and colonial tastes.77 Upon returning from a French excursion in 1827, Charles fretted about the quality of the new wallpaper at Swallowfield. ‘Where the pattern of the paper is pretty & full, the rooms look handsome, but in two or three of them the paper looks rather common; perhaps more so from my having just seen such rich papers in France’, he observed.78 Their London supplier had shown Charles patterns for Swallowfield’s silk furnishings, but again Charles was concerned that silks from Lyons that he and Henry had seen in France were superior.79 March 1828 saw Charles recommend Belgian carpets – available in London at a shop at 145 Leadenhall Street or directly from the Belgian warehouses – to Henry both for Swallowfield and to send to his Mottet in-laws in Hyderabad. In May, the brothers travelled to Tournai to visit the factory itself, and selected a carpet with a pink ground for Swallowfield’s dining room.80 By November 1828, the brothers had spent a small fortune of their father’s money on Swallowfield’s embellishment. ‘My Father last night got Atkinsons [sic] account of outstanding bills amounting in London & Swallowfield to £5276’, Charles wrote on 26 November. ‘He takes it astonishingly well.’81 Expenditure on this scale, decades after the classic age of eighteenth-century nabob excess, provides a telling reminder both of Company men’s keen participation in the design of stately home interiors but also of the extent to which new imperial wealth was recast in new European material possessions.\n\nAlthough Sir Henry Russell invested substantial sums in Swallowfield’s refurbishment, received rents from the estate and was an occasional house guest there, it was Henry and Clotilde Russell – together with their six surviving children – who made this house their home. Charles, who served as a Tory MP for Reading from 1830–37 and 1841–47 and was Chairman of the Great Western Railway from 1839–55,82 was a constant visitor, and continued to work in harness with Henry both at Swallowfield and from London to make Swallowfield a venerable English family seat. Family portraits, which had featured prominently in Henry’s refashioning of the Hyderabad Residency, were likewise central to the brothers’ plans for Swallowfield. Retired from the Company service, Henry now enjoyed the wealth, leisure and connections to raise his collection to new heights. Both brothers entered eagerly into genealogical research from the later 1820s onward, intent to familiarize themselves with the biographies as well as the portraits of a family they had left behind as adolescents to seek their fortunes in India.83\n\nCommissioning new family portraits, and retouching existing ones, occupied the brothers throughout the 1830s, connecting them with the flourishing English art market.84 In 1831, Henry Russell paid David Wilkie (1785–1841) to complete a portrait of his uncle, Earl Whitworth, a picture begun by Sir Thomas Lawrence (1769–1830).85 His mother’s family was far more socially exalted than his father’s, but Henry was also careful to ensure that his paternal line was well-represented on Swallowfield’s walls. He was also eager to continue to use portraits to maintain links with his in-laws. The fashionable society artist George Richmond (1809–96) was a frequent visitor at Swallowfield in the 1830s, welcome as a houseguest, an artist and an art consultant. Portraits of Henry and Clotilde, completed by Richmond in 1834, were sent to Clotilde’s sister and brother-in-law, now resettled from Hyderabad to Exeter; another sister, still in India, received a drawing of Clotilde by Richmond in 1836.86 In 1840, Henry debated with Charles the best way to display his growing collection of family portraits. By October he had decided that the breakfast room would contain his portraits of Mrs Casamaijor (his first wife’s mother, a Scot by birth), their paternal uncle, Henshaw Russell of Kent, together with Italian prints, pictures on classical themes and a Madonna. The paintings in the hall, he had decided, would include pictures of St Anne and the child Jesus as well as Chinnery’s Indian portrait of Sir Henry. In December, he added to this display a series of images – still extant at Swallowfield – that depicted key figures in England’s royal history: Charles II, the Duke of Marlborough, Lord Portland and Queen Anne.87\n\nAs the inclusion of Italian prints among these family portraits indicates, the death of the 1st baronet in 1836 appears to have given his eldest son new licence to develop his European tastes. Henry and his family spent much of the next few years travelling on the continent, where he discovered a passion for Renaissance Italian art that was to contribute significantly to Swallowfield’s interiors. As a young man, Henry had laboured in the Company’s civil service to accumulate capital, an occupation that had precluded the cultural education enjoyed by scions of the landed classes on the Grand Tour.88 The wealth he had accumulated in India now allowed him to remedy the deficiencies of his education. He wrote to Charles from Venice in 1837 to report his enjoyment of paintings by Titian, Veronese and Tintoretto, as well as ‘a host of first rate masters whose names even I never heard of before’. He purchased copies of a painting by Titian of the Assumption, and one by Veronese of supper at the house of Levi. The two boxes of purchases he was sending back to Swallowfield, he reported, were filled with a cornucopia of artefacts: books, rolls of prints, old bronze knockers, an ebony writing box, a bust, a sleeping cupid, a marble basin, carved wooden heads, female figures and his Renaissance reproductions.89 Writing from Naples in 1838, before the family moved on to Rome, Henry told Charles to expect a further eight cases of continental goods – maps, prints, a marble table-top, bronze and Etruscan ware. From Rome, he sent a further 10 cases of goods home to Swallowfield.90\n\nIt was by refreshing the 1st baronet’s Wimpole Street furnishings with continental materials that the 2nd baronet now prepared to integrate these inherited goods from London into his home at Swallowfield. From Paris, Henry wrote to Charles in 1838 asking for the dimensions of their father’s ebony couches. ‘Clotilde has the dimensions of the seats of the small & circular chairs, and she thinks some of the yellow flowered silk she bought at Genoa, will do to cover them, but we shall want something rich to cover the couch with’, he commented. ‘If it be not too expensive, Beauvais tapestry would agree admirably with the carpet and curtains, and would be much stronger and more durable than silk.’91 To bind these new European acquisitions more securely with English traditions, Henry upon his return to Swallowfield immersed himself again in genealogy. ‘Now for genealogy’, he wrote to Charles in 1839. ‘I am making out such an account as I can of our family for the Baronetage, and am, at the same time, preparing notes to be affixed to the backs of the old Dover pictures.’92 His place in the landed elite now secured by the family’s inclusion in Burke’s Peerage and Baronetage, by Swallowfield’s establishment as the Russell family seat and by his ability to identify the paternal lineage from which he had sprung, Henry Russell – nabob and nouveau riche though he had been – had now arrived at home.\n\nHidden in plain view: Indian legacies\n\nAlthough English and European material culture dominated Swallowfield’s interiors, overt references to the Asian origins of the Russells’ wealth remained clearly visible in their home during the 2nd baronet’s residence there. A selection of significant Indian subjects and objects was displayed prominently in the house, as the placement of Chinnery’s portrait of the 1st baronet, painted in Calcutta, in the main hall attests. When he wrote to Charles with instructions for the painting and framing of family portraits in 1836, Henry also mentioned two pictures of ‘Indian subjects’ in Wilkie’s care.93 He did not identify these paintings, but we know from William Dalrymple’s painstaking research that Henry prominently displayed above the stairs the large portrait painted by Chinnery in 1805 of the two children of James Achilles Kirkpatrick and Khair un-Nissa – the Hyderabadi noblewoman whose lover Henry had become after Kirkpatrick’s death. As infants, the children had been raised at Hyderabad within their mother’s culture: the first child, a son born in 1801, was named Sahib Allum (Lord of the World) and his sister, born in 1803, was named Sahib Begum. In 1805, to their mother and maternal grandmother’s intense distress, their father sent the children to Madras, to embark from there for a new life in England. Chinnery painted them before their departure. They stand together in his large oil portrait in luxurious Indian court dress, adorned with gold and pearls. Christened by Kirkpatrick’s relations in England, the children became William George (d. 1828) and Katherine Aurora Kirkpatrick (d. 1889). It was Katherine (Kitty) who in 1841 visited Swallowfield with a friend who was the Russells’ neighbour and, immediately recognizing this portrait on the wall, burst into tears.94\n\nRussell’s acquisition of the portrait speaks to the unequal power relations – sexual, cultural and political – that marked Company rule in India. Unwillingly separated from her children, Khair un-Nissa had struggled unsuccessfully to retain this emotive object within her possession. After Kirkpatrick’s death, she brought the portrait from Hyderabad to Calcutta, where Chinnery – keen to use it to advertise his skill as an artist – borrowed it and retained the painting in his possession. First as Khair’s lover and later as a married man and widower who corresponded with her only through his brother Charles, Henry Russell made episodic, half-hearted efforts to return the painting to her. It arrived belatedly in Hyderabad – where Henry now presided as Resident – in autumn 1813, several weeks after Khair’s premature death.95 We do not know whether Henry purchased or simply appropriated the portrait of his ex-lover’s children (the latter action, based on his family letters, would not have been out of character). Its public display at Swallowfield in the 1840s reflects the confidence with which Henry as a retired Company man now inhabited his home, his place in landed society and his Englishness.\n\nWe can see this cultural and political confidence displayed at Swallowfield in other material objects which embodied the violence of empire even as they allowed Henry Russell and his Company contemporaries to celebrate the perceived virtues of British rule in India. The history of a silver-gilt presentation vase, which was commissioned and purchased by Henry Russell for £1,100 in 1822, illustrates the simultaneous ability of material culture to display and to erase the imperial histories of both country house interiors and the Company families who so carefully constructed them. When Henry left his post at Hyderabad to return to England in 1820, the Company men who had served under him at the Residency subscribed funds for the purchase of ‘a few Articles of household Plate, which [they hoped] by being in daily use in his family may sometimes remind him of those officers … who … are grateful for the good he has done to the Service’.96 Executed by Philip Rundell in London from designs to which at least three distinguished Royal Academicians contributed, the 1822 vase was purchased with these subscribed funds. It depicted European officers and soldiers as well as Indian sepoys, and (through devices such as bifurcated snake handles, elephant heads and a tiger) emphatically asserted its Asian imperial origins. Lest these allusions were lost on viewers, a presentation plaque informed them that the vase was ‘A TRIBUTE OF GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE FROM THE OFFICERS OF THE HYDERABAD DIVISION OF H.H. THE NIZAM’S REGULAR TROOPS TO HENRY RUSSELL ESQUIRE’.97 Unsurprisingly, this presentation vase featured in Lady Constance Russell’s Swallowfield and Its Owners as an emblem both of Henry Russell’s ‘distinguished career’ in India and his tasteful furnishing in retirement of his English country home.98 Read through this lens, its imperial provenance adds value to the vase as a material object beyond its precious metals and craftsmanship: Lady Russell’s description of the vase’s complex commissioning and its place within Swallowfield’s interior was cited at length in the 2010 auction catalogue, and the vase – estimated at £20,000–30,000 – sold for £95,000.99\n\nAn alternative history of Henry’s presentation vase, however, emerges from his private letters and from the Company’s archives. Directly precipitated by Henry’s departure from Hyderabad, the gift of funds for its acquisition appears in these documents to bear witness to the inherent violence of empire, to Henry’s active participation in that violence and to the willingness of other Company men in India to close ranks when the right of Englishmen to wield imperial force was challenged.100 For Henry Russell had left the Company service and returned to England prematurely in 1820, his hasty departure calculated to pre-empt his official removal from the Residency in disgrace by the Court of Directors. In August 1818, a gang of robbers had attacked the bazaar at the Hyderabad Residency, killing several persons. Two of the men were seized by the Residency’s soldiers, and were convinced by Henry to inform on their comrades in return for being spared from capital punishment at the Nizam’s hands. The agreement clearly overstepped Henry’s civil authority at Hyderabad, and became untenable when the men proved to have perjured themselves. Honouring his promise not to turn them over to the Nizam, Henry ordered each instead a flogging of 1,000 lashes – punishment overseen by his brother-in-law, Lieutenant Holroyd.101 Both of the robbers had been wounded when captured by the Residency’s soldiers; the first (Govinda) died on the morning after the flogging, and the second (Babareea) died shortly thereafter.102\n\nA savage and public display of colonial discipline, the floggings and ensuing deaths swiftly mobilized the Company men at Hyderabad in combined support of the surgeon who had monitored the proceedings, Holroyd and Henry Russell. A medical officer who had observed the floggings reported that the men had not fainted during the ordeal and that their backs were so little lacerated ‘that I could not help observing to Lieutenant Holroyd how thick their skins were and what little impression the cuts made’.103 Ten officers stationed at the Residency wrote a memorial to the attending surgeon expressing their concern that the event ‘must have deeply afflicted you’, observing that the deaths ‘could not have been occasioned by either want of humanity in inflicting more lashes than the delinquents could well bear, or want in skill in their after treatment’.104 To the astonishment and fury of the Directors in London, when they condemned Henry’s role in this incident the Governor General in Calcutta accepted his request to leave his post for England rather than dismissing him from the service, as the Directors had demanded. More than this, the Governor General commended Henry for ‘the eminent zeal, ability, judgment and address by which your conduct has been distinguished during a long career of public service, and especially in the management of the important interests confided to your charge at the Court of Hyderabad’.105 For years after their return from India, the time, effort and money Henry and Charles lavished on the refurbishment of Swallowfield as a genteel family seat were matched by their frenetic efforts to protect Henry’s reputation by ensuring that this brutal episode remained hidden from public view. The private letters of the 1820s which record the brothers ordering silks and commissioning silver also document their schemes to buy clandestine proof copies of the East India Company’s investigative reports into Henry’s now notorious tenure at the Hyderabad Residency.106 Meanwhile, at home at Swallowfield, the display of Henry’s presentation vase worked to ensure that this textual record of imperial violence was silenced, and the narrative of its role in Residency politics at Hyderabad was re-inscribed in a conspicuous luxury object of great aesthetic and material value.\n\nConclusions\n\nSince its development in the 1760s, the image of the nabob has figured in British caricature as a quintessentially possessive individual. Consumed by his individual needs, addicted to Indian tastes and incapable of casting off his commercial origins to acquire gentility, the returned Anglo-Indian was a byword in Georgian England for the failure of social, cultural and national integration. The history of the Russell family suggests many of the ways in which this stereotype falls short of social practice. Whereas the archetypal nabob was a single-minded individualist, the Russell correspondence reveals Sir Henry, his wife and their progeny to have been key collaborators in a collective family enterprise. The flow of material goods – between Calcutta and Hyderabad, between London and Madras, between Paris, Venice, Rome and Berkshire – was an essential agent and marker of this shared endeavour, which was designed to translate a new fortune acquired in India into secure, genteel landed wealth and power in England. Male consumers – too often written out of histories of Georgian consumer culture – were essential players in this familial campaign.107 Family networks were also vital to the Russells’ success in fashioning their place in Georgian society. In-laws as well as blood-kin played key roles in this process of family formation. In India, Henry Russell relied on the family of his first wife, the Casamaijors, not only for emotional support, but also for fine furnishings from the metropolis that would embellish the interiors of the Hyderabad Residency, and for family portraits that would help to underpin his status as Resident. In England, the French in-laws acquired through his second wife later became material assets, connecting him to Parisian fashion and to a wider continental tradition of art and culture that was to transform Swallowfield’s interiors.\n\nEnglish and European influences appear increasingly to have displaced Indian motifs in Swallowfield’s decor over time, but Company men and women remained central to sociability at Swallowfield through the lifetimes of the first two baronets.108 Clotilde’s French origins and her Catholicism may have been bars to Swallowfield’s use as a domestic focal point of parliamentary politics: Charles’s electioneering activities were largely confined to nearby Reading, his constituency. But Swallowfield nonetheless emerged as a key gathering place of Company families, and thus as a site of Company politics. The men and women recorded as visitors in the family correspondence include names that recur in the Company’s lists of officers over successive generations. The Casamaijors, the Clives, the Elliots of Minto and the Duke of Wellington – who had first risen to military fame in the Madras Presidency and had known the first Sir Henry in India – were all repeated visitors at Swallowfield. The seat’s location near Windsor Park helped to solidify these social connections: the region was awash with returned Anglo-Indians who had purchased estates in the surrounding countryside.\n\nIf Swallowfield exemplifies a long and English country house tradition, its history as the Russell family seat can only be understood if its Englishness is situated within wider global networks in which both India and continental Europe were conspicuously present. The brothers Henry and Charles laboured for decades to trace their family line backwards through successive English generations, but in constructing the family seat, they drew upon a more cosmopolitan genealogy. Swallowfield’s acquisition rested firmly on Indian wealth and was shaped by colonial India’s vibrant patterns of consumption; over time, without ever entirely effacing these Asian financial foundations, its material culture increasingly reflected a broadly European style of furnishing that combined English and continental tastes and products. Significantly, this editing of their Indian past was bolstered by the Russells’ use of spatial segregation to police the racial borders of their family. Thus Henry’s mixed-race illegitimate daughter – born (like the Kirkpatrick children) at Hyderabad but sent ‘home’ to India by her father – was explicitly excluded from the family seat at Swallowfield. Henry named this daughter Mary Wilson to disguise her paternity, appointed one of his Company friends from Hyderabad to serve as her guardian and boarded Mary at a school in Croydon, where she was trained up as a governess. He resolutely refused to meet with her in England, to tell her of her parentage or to allow her into his stately home. ‘In the first place, I could not tell her who she is, without at the same time receiving her at least occasionally into my house, and I find, what is perhaps not only natural but proper, that Lady R. would object to this, at all counts while her own daughters are unmarried’, he wrote to her guardian in 1839.109\n\nBritish country houses, the Russell correspondence repeatedly demonstrates, represent the culmination of ongoing material processes that occur across both time and space, rather than a fixed fabric rooted in a single style, period or locale. The fashioning of Swallowfield reflects a highly mobile confluence of interlocking family histories. Family members’ familiarity with Calcutta’s exotic emporia, the many mansions through which Lady Russell and her younger children made their peripatetic way while waiting for Sir Henry’s return, the two-fold Palladian and Oriental opulence of the Hyderabad Residency during Henry and Charles’s residence there and the brothers’ discovery (mediated by the French connections of Henry’s second wife) of continental European design and fine art all combined in the making of this English home. So too did Henry’s exclusion of his daughter Mary Wilson from his family seat, an exclusion that contrasts sharply with his decision to display Chinnery’s celebrated portrait of the infant Kirkpatricks prominently on Swallowfield’s walls. To understand the Georgian country house as an imperial phenomenon, it is essential to move beyond the individualizing and stereotypical perspective of the nabob, to jettison the notion of English heritage as purely English, and to situate Company homes such as Swallowfield in a dense and dynamic global web of interlinked persons, objects and built environments."
