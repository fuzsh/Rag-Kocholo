        "text": "Shakespeare as an Angler, Henry Ellacombe, 1883\n\nIn 1563, the English monarchy enforced a statute on fishing regulations containing a provision for a \"political Lent.\" This provision, so called due to its similarity to the fast days of the Christian season of Lent, required that English citizens eat fish in place of meat on Wednesdays. This provision was enforced by secular law and was instated in addition to the already existing religious fish days of Fridays and Saturdays. The intent behind the provision was to increase the amount of money being directed into the fishing market, which would allow England to maintain their national honor as a fishing giant and fund their navy.\n\nShakespeare, having been born in 1564, the year after this provision went into effect, would have grown up on a regular diet of fish. Though the unpopular provision was eventually overturned in 1585, it is possible that Shakespeare would have continued to eat fish regularly out of habit. While it was ultimately unsuccessful, this provision shows just how important the institution of fishing was in everyday English life.\n\nMr. William Shakespearâ€™s Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies, William Shakespeare, 1904\n\nFishing has been a part of human life since the beginning of civilization. It originated as a way to get food, but over time became popular as a pastime. There are many references to angling in works of literature and other writings, indicating that it played a significant part in the development of human society. Anglers today enjoy looking back at their roots to discover which historical figures they can determine were also anglers. Therefore, there has been much speculation about whether William Shakespeare, one of the most recognizable figures of the Elizabethan Era, was an angler. Though he never explicitly stated that he was, textual clues in his plays indicate that he may have been familiar with the sport.\n\n\"The Kingdome of England.\" In The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine, John Speed, 1676\n\nJohn Speed was an English cartographer and historian. He is regarded as the most important mapmaker of the Stuart period in England, which was marked by civil war and the English Restoration, and refers to the period between 1603-1714. The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine, originally published in 1611-1612, contained the first county maps of England and Wales, with maps of Ireland and Scotland.\n\nTroilus:\n\nWhile others Fish with craft for great Opinion,\n\nI, with great truth, catch meer simplicity;\n\n-Troilus and Cressida: Act IV, Scene iv, p. 250\n\nAngelo:\n\nOh cunning Enemy, that to catch a Saint,\n\nWith Saints dost bait thou hook:\n\n-Measure for Measure: Act II, Scene ii, p. 61\n\nClaudio:\n\nBait the hook well, the fish will bite.\n\n-Much Ado About Nothing: Act II, Scene iii, p. 96\n\nHero:\n\nFor look where Beatrice like a Lapwing runs\n\nClose by the ground, to hear our conference.\n\nUrsula:\n\nThe pleasant'st angling is to see the fish\n\nCut with her golden oars the silver stream,\n\nAnd greedily devor the treacherous bait:\n\nSo angle we for Beatrice, who even now,\n\nIs couched in the woodbine coverture,\n\nFear you not my part of the Dialogue.\n\nHero:\n\nThen go we near her that her ear lose nothing\n\nOf the false sweet bait that we lay for it:\n\n-Much Ado About Nothing: Act III, Scene i, p. 99\n\nCleopatra:\n\nAnd when good will is shewed,\n\nThough't come too short,\n\nThe Actor may plead pardon.
