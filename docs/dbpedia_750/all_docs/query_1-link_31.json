        "text": "Daniel L. Marsh is inaugurated as the 4th President of Boston University. He would serve in the role for the next 25 years. Marsh was a 1908 graduate of the School of Theology and also held degrees from Northwestern University. He and his wife, Harriet (Truxell) Marsh, took courses at CLA while attending BU as students.\n\nMiriam Gideon graduates from CLA with a degree in music. She goes on to become a composer and the first woman to write a complete synagogue service. She is one of the most recorded female composers of her era.\n\nAfter two years and four months, a faculty committee completes its general review of CLA degree requirements and revises the curriculum by scrapping the Major and the Minor in favor of “Fields of Concentration” made up of “Principal” and “Related” courses. One faculty member, Professor Emil Carl Wilm, protested that the new curriculum was “weak, apologetic, and largely irrational.”\n\nA group of eight women in the CLA Class of 1927 formed their own sisterhood and named it \"Die Esel Verein,\" which means \"The Donkey Club\" in German. They created newsletters for each other to keep in touch after graduation. Thanks to Mildred Lewis, one of the members, many copies from 1929 and beyond have been archived.\n\nThe \"Boston Stump\" is highlighted in the BU centennial publication as a structure chosen to be the central hallmark of the new campus. It would be a reproduction of a tower that stood in Boston, England. The tower never came to be, but its mark can be seen above some doorways when entering the CAS building today.\n\nIn the midst of a national focus on general education, CLA ceased requiring students to take Greek and Latin. Instead, it revised its program of study to include a required course in English Composition and a requirement that every student demonstrate proficiency in one Foreign Language. The College then continued its “distribution requirement” and proclaimed that “both for self-development and social usefulness every student requires a measure of understanding in three great fields of knowledge.” Students thereby took 12 credits in the field of “Literature and the Arts,” 12 credits in the “Natural Sciences and Mathematics,” and 15 credits in the “Social Sciences.”\n\nLt. Donald Herbert Vincent (student of Philosophy, CLA’38, GRS '40) served as an Army Air Force navigator assigned to a bomber squadron during World War II. One week after D-Day, his plane was shot down over southern Germany when returning from a raid to its base in Italy. In this photo, he’s standing in the back row, second from the left, with other members of his crew from the “Gawgia Peach.” A small bronze plaque in CAS 402 memorializes his life. Over 8,000 BU faculty, students, and alumni served in the military during World War II, and over 200 paid the ultimate sacrifice like Lt. Vincent. He was survived by his wife, the former Beatrice S. Warner (CLA’37).\n\nA promotional spread for a new building of Arts & Sciences at 725 Commonwealth Avenue appears in the pages of Bostonia. It announces: “The Plan Is Ready: All Young Men and Women, Whether Rich or Poor, of Whatever Race, Creed or Color, Shall Have Their Chance.” The cornerstone would be laid in 1946 and the design for the turrets would change. It would open in September of 1947, weeks behind schedule, and, for nearly a month, faculty competed with the sound of hammers while students juggled their belongings in the absence of installed lockers. But, finally, the College of Liberal Arts had a new home with other academic units on BU’s new Charles River Campus.\n\nEsther A. H. Hopkins graduates from CLA with a degree in Chemistry. She later becomes the first African American woman to graduate from Yale with a Ph.D. She then serves as a biophysicist and research chemist, as well as an attorney for the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nSeiichi Michael Yasutake graduates with a degree in History from CLA. Like tens of thousands of Japanese Americans, Yasutake and his family were uprooted from their home in Ohio by the U.S. government and detained in an internment camp in Idaho after the outbreak of World War II. President Daniel L. Marsh subsequently positioned Boston University to obtain special approval to receive scores of relocated Japanese students into its classes, freeing them from the detainment camps. Yasutake, who spent a year and a half in the detainment camp before being released, initially attended the University of Cincinnati. After FBI interrogation, however, the University of Cincinnati expelled him. He subsequently moved to Boston University, graduated, and went on to become an outspoken Episcopal Priest who worked tirelessly on behalf of political prisoners while laboring for justice, peace, and human rights.\n\nGeorgiana Jagiello graduates from CLA with a degree in Biology. She goes on to become the first woman appointed to the Institute of Advanced Study at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the first woman appointed to an endowed chair at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. She perfects the technique for in vitro fertilization.\n\nKatherine E. Hilliker (CLA 1913) retires after an impressive 45 years of service as a staff member. She served as the Secretary to the Dean of CLA in that time, supporting the work of three separate deans (Warren, Taylor, and Graham).\n\nThe Center for Philosophy & History of Science is founded as an independent research center within Boston University’s College of Arts of Sciences. One of the oldest one centers for philosophy & history of science in North America, the Center’s mission is to build bridges between the humanities and sciences by promoting interdisciplinary research into the historical, philosophical, ethical, and social factors that govern the theory and practice of science.\n\nCaroline J. Chang graduates from CLA. Born and raised in Boston’s Chinatown, she later serves as the first manager of Chinatown’s Little City Hall in Boston and as a civil rights specialist for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A co-founder of the Asian Community Development Corporation, she is honored by BU with an Alumni Award in 1997.\n\nGeorge A. Strait graduates with a Bachelor of Arts from CLA.
