        "text": "Between 1790 and 1801 the House of Commons consisted of 558 Members elected by 314 constituencies. The 245 English constituencies (40 counties, 203 boroughs, 2 universities) returned 489 Members; the 24 Welsh constituencies and 45 Scottish constituencies returned one Member each. In 1801 the addition of 100 Irish Members elected by 66 constituencies made an Imperial Parliament of 658 Members.\n\nTHE ENGLISH COUNTIES\n\nThe county franchise qualified to vote men possessed of freehold valued for the land tax assessments at 40s. per annum at least. This freehold qualification could be interpreted as including leaseholders for life, annuitants, holders of rent charges and of mortgages on freehold; holders of ecclesiastical benefices; and placeholders in government service. A freeholder might be required to swear an oath as to his qualification, which might be contested at the poll when he presented himself to vote. A vote might be rejected, or reserved pending adjudication; or it might be subsequently challenged. In Norfolk a scrutiny of the poll involving a couple of hundred doubtful votes was ordered after the election of 1802: such a procedure was, however, so expensive that it was generally avoided unless the contest was very close. Polls were conducted at only one place in each county, though there were usually distinct booths for the different divisions of the county. The distance travelled by voters and provision for their accommodation and entertainment added greatly to the expense of county elections. The candidates for counties were required to possess £600 p.a. freehold, so adventurers were discouraged.\n\nIn 1790 eight counties were contested; in 1796 only four; in 1802 six; in 1806 seven; in 1807 eleven; in 1812 four only; and in 1818 eleven. In addition, there were 12 contested county by-elections in this period. Thus of 362 possible contests (280 at general elections and 82 at by-elections), only 63 went to a poll, about one in six.\n\nThe total electorate in the English counties numbered little more than 190,000: despite increased registration of voters, notably in Devon, Lincolnshire, Middlesex, Norfolk, Somerset, Sussex, Wiltshire and Yorkshire, the average increase over the preceding period was no more than 8 or 9 per cent. In 1807 and 1818, when 11 counties were contested, the freeholders who voted totalled only approximately 50,000 and 36,000 respectively, the former figure swollen by the large Yorkshire electorate and including six more polling days in all-the average duration in each case being between six and seven days out of a possible 15. The duration of a poll for 15 days--a limitation introduced by an Act of 1785-was not a guarantee of intensive polling, as in some cases (for instance, Berkshire and Kent in 1818) it was the obstinacy of the weakest candidate that kept the poll open to the limit imposed by law when the result was a foregone conclusion and polling low. Less than one in five contests lasted the full 15 days. There was no appreciable difference in the average size of the poll in the 12 contested by-elections in this period-40,906 votes were cast, the average duration of the poll being approximately the same, though two of these contests were farcically short, that in Lincolnshire in 1816 lasting only an hour or two, and that in Hampshire in 1808 being a token and prearranged poll. Thirty-five out of the 63 contests that went to a poll were in counties with electorates of about 5,000 or over.\n\nIn county contests at general elections there was a tripartite battle for two seats in all cases except in Hampshire, where in 1790 and 1806 there was an all-out battle between two politically opposed sets of candidates. All the county by-elections were straight fights. Where three candidates fought for two seats and each freeholder had two votes, a coalition of two of the candidates dividing their supporters’ votes between them ensured victory. Even where no acknowledged coalition took place, the freeholders did not necessarily ‘plump’ (i.e. give one vote only, to their favourite candidate), as their loyalties and obligations or ambitions were often divided. In none of the county contests in this period did all three candidates derive the majority of their votes from plumpers: normally it was the candidate who stood unconnected with the other two who received the largest proportion of plumpers. In Yorkshire in 1807 Lord Milton had 9,108 plumpers out of 11,177 votes. He was second in the poll; candidates with a majority of plumpers were more usually the unsuccessful ones. In some cases (such as Cornwall in 1790, Dorset in 1806 and 1807) the contest was acknowledged not to be directed against one of the sitting Members, in the latter case William Morton Pitt, and the majority of freeholders promised one vote to him and the other to their favourite of the two contesting candidates. This procedure was no guarantee of security to the candidate whose seat was supposedly thereby ensured to him if the fight between the two others was a keen one, and Morton Pitt grew alarmed for his own success in the contest of 1807 when many of his promised supporters, professing to think him secure, deserted and threw themselves into the struggle between Portman and Bankes.\n\nCoalitions between any two candidates against a third were somewhat frowned upon, particularly if the pair were not political allies; but, where possible unavowed, they proved effective. In 1807 in Bedfordshire, ‘a field of battle for Whig and Tory politics’, a Whig alliance turned out the Tory sitting Member. In Berkshire in 1796 the sitting Members, whose politics were not the same, joined forces to keep out a third contender and were not particularly blamed for it: he was the disturber of the peace. Such coalitions of the beati possidentes could not be counted upon when political issues marred their partnership and, had a third man offered for Berkshire in 1807, as at one time seemed likely, he would have benefited from the fact that his fellow candidates were at political loggerheads and would doubtless have joined forces with the politically congenial one. In the case of a third candidate who was unacceptable to the majority of the freeholders, they rallied to the support of the reputable candidates, even if their politics differed, as the radical William Hallett found in Berkshire where he directed his fire against one opponent in 1812 and another in 1818. The same fate befell most radical candidates for counties. Coalitions were not proof against a popular and resourceful competitor: when Bastard and Acland combined against Viscount Ebrington in Devon in 1818, it was Acland who gave up when Ebrington took a decisive lead. Allegations of his coalition with Morton Pitt in Dorset in 1806 did Henry Bankes no good and, although coalition was denied, he made no headway then or in 1807. Had he tried again in 1812, Morton Pitt would have insisted on proclaiming his neutrality between the two other contenders.\n\nOffers of coalition were often refused by candidates who saw in them no advantage to themselves. In 1812 Burgoyne, the radical Whig candidate for Essex, was thus refused by Western, the orthodox Whig, who regarded him as a usurper, and Burgoyne undertook to prove the iniquity of the ‘system’ by an analysis of the poll, demonstrating that Western was in league with the Tory Member to dish him. In Herefordshire in 1818 Col. George Cornewall, a Grenvillite whose party were feeling their way towards an understanding with the government, was refused a coalition by the ministerial candidate Cotterell, and was defeated. In Hertfordshire in 1802 William Baker was defeated by a manoeuvre, engineered by Lord Salisbury, whereby the second votes of the other sitting Member, Plumer, were diverted to the third candidate, Peniston Lamb. In Huntingdonshire in 1807 Viscount Proby lost his seat when the course of politics restored the previous coalition between Lord Sandwich and the Duke of Manchester in the county, the breakdown of which had secured his return in 1806.\n\nCoalition served the purpose of setting aside an outmoded convention in Kent in 1790, when the Hon. Charles Marsham invoked the ‘pact’ whereby West Kent returned one Member and East Kent the other as his reason for declining coalition with either of his East Kent opponents, who had not intended to challenge him but were carried away by the contest between themselves. Though politically opposed, the latter came to terms, Knatchbull’s friends bestowing 470 second votes on Honywood, who proceeded to defeat Marsham by 377. Marsham had declined a last-minute offer from Knatchbull to redress the balance by giving him some of his second votes: coalitions could arise in the course of a poll, where one candidate had enough of a lead to bestow his friends’ second votes on the contender of his preference. In 1796 Knatchbull entered into an unavowed coalition with Sir William Geary, who agreed to shoulder most of the expenses against Honywood, and Honywood was defeated. Nothing daunted, in 1802 Honywood came to terms with Geary to oust Knatchbull. In Lincolnshire in 1818 the Hon. Charles Anderson Pelham insisted on neutrality towards his competitors, but Sir Robert Heron, a more advanced Whig than Anderson Pelham, did his best to prevent the latter’s friends from sitting on the fence, invoking political solidarity and thereby giving offence. In the Middlesex election of 1806 Byng declined to join Burdett, thus accentuating the rift between Whigs and Radicals; while in the election of 1807 in the same constituency Mellish, the ministerialist Member, declined to join with Sir Christopher Baynes, a ministerialist ultra, who was duly defeated. In Norfolk, Astley owed his return in the contest of 1802 to the protection of the other sitting Member, Thomas William Coke, who was determined to return two Whigs; and in 1806 Coke likewise allied with William Windham. In Northamptonshire it was anticipated that Viscount Althorp and Cartwright would unite in 1806, but they did not need to do so: they were not hard pressed by Sir William Langham. In Hampshire where, uniquely, two pairs of candidates stood as political opponents in 1790 and 1806, a ministerial bid to detach one of the sitting Members, Heathcote, from his colleague in 1806 did not succeed, or at least led only to Heathcote’s withdrawal and replacement by another candidate. In Suffolk in 1790 the coalition of Bunbury and Rous against Vanneck was more or less dictated by a county meeting in February, and though uneasy, carried the day in the interest of political compromise. In Surrey in 1807 Samuel Thornton, who regarded Lord William Russell, and not Sir John Frederick, as his opponent, withdrew in Frederick’s favour, though ahead of him on the poll, when it became likely that Frederick would be the ultimate loser. In Sussex in 1807 Wyndham and Fuller did not coalesce, Wyndham thinking it improper to do so: but their tacit combination ensured the defeat of Sergison. In Wiltshire in 1818 Methuen, the sitting Member whose security was not being threatened, declined a coalition with Benett in the latter’s struggle with Wellesley Long. The supposition of a combination between Wilberforce and Lascelles in Yorkshire in 1807 was an issue which embarrassed Wilberforce on the hustings to the point of illness.\n\nA coalition of any two candidates against a third, whether with or without a political sanction, was inevitably decried when a contest actually took place: as one of the methods of preventing a contest by obliging the third candidate to withdraw, it raised fewer protests. Five out of six county elections did not proceed to a poll, and many threats of opposition did not materialize. Given that the expense and bitterness of a contest were to be avoided if possible, the measures taken to meet this aim seldom failed. In some counties the leading interests were in uncontestable control. Elsewhere, any gentleman who stood against sitting Members would be accused of disturbing the peace of the county and had to make out his case. Contests more often arose when one of the sitting Members retired.\n\nThe manoeuvres to avoid a poll were many. In Bedfordshire on the vacancy of 1794 Osborn snatched a seat from the Whigs by getting into the field too soon for them to muster, thereby provoking revenge sooner or later. While he held the seat the county returned ‘one and on’, that is, a Member of each party, and such political compromises operated in other counties too, though they were liable to be overthrown when one of the parties thought itself strong enough to carry two. Thus Osborn was defeated in 1807; but when he reappeared in 1818, Pym retired in his favour, the Whigs no longer being hopeful of carrying both seats. In Berkshire political compromise was restored in 1790 without a contest, and on the vacancy of 1794 Loveden made way for Dundas, but insisted on standing at the ensuing general election, only to be defeated. In 1812, in the same county, the candidature of the radical William Hallett caused the withdrawal of one of the sitting Members, Vansittart, but did not open the door for Hallett. In Buckinghamshire political compromise was also restored in 1790 when Verney regained his seat from Aubrey, who withdrew well in advance of the election. A by-election contest for Cambridgeshire in 1810 was averted by Lord Hardwicke’s refusal to support his half-brother’s re-election when their politics had drifted apart, and by his espousal of the Whig candidate Lord Francis Godolphin Osborne.\n\nIn Cornwall, political compromise being regarded as preferable to the upheaval caused by the contest of 1790, Francis Gregor retired in 1806 when his popularity was waning and was replaced unopposed by a non-committal young Member, Tremayne. In Cumberland in 1804 a contest was brewing for the ailing Fletcher’s seat, but it was averted by the transfer of one of the competitors, Lord Muncaster, to a vacancy in the neighbouring county; and in 1806 by Lord Lowther’s espousal of Lord Morpeth against either Fletcher or Curwen. Their ‘pact’ did not come under strain, despite political differences, until 1818 when Curwen proposed a junction with Morpeth against Lowther. Morpeth’s refusal on this occasion ensured his defeat by Curwen in 1820. Henry Bankes, who toyed with the idea of contesting Dorset for the third time in 1812, was deterred by the insistence of William Morton Pitt, the long established sitting Member on whose friends’ support Bankes had relied previously, on complete neutrality. In Durham in 1802 a compromise between the politically opposed sitting Members, Burdon and Milbanke, forced the third man, Tempest, to withdraw; though Tempest defeated a compromise candidate, Ellison, in 1807. In Essex political compromise would have been maintained but for the challenge of Montagu Burgoyne, the radical Whig: rather than let him in, Western, the more orthodox Whig, withdrew, permitting a political opponent to defeat Burgoyne in 1810, and defeated him with help from the other side in 1812.\n\nIn Gloucestershire attempts to upset the status quo were ineffective in 1806 and 1810, and it was only when the controlling interests abandoned their political compromise in 1811 that an effective candidate challenged them. In Herefordshire in 1803, Biddulph having unseated Cotterell by a petition which was not regarded as fair by the gentry, the chairman of Cotterell’s election committee was allowed an unopposed return as locum tenens. In Hertfordshire in 1807 a contest was avoided when both sitting Members retired, giving their blessing to their replacements: and it being long anticipated that one of the latter, Thomas Brand, would succeed to a peerage, his successor, William Lamb, was groomed for the vacancy and met with no opposition when it at length occurred. In Huntingdonshire in 1806 the candidature of William Henry Fellowes on the Duke of Manchester’s interest was stopped by the decision of the head of the other leading interest, Lord Sandwich, in favour of his competitor Viscount Proby: the latter’s defeat in 1807, when Sandwich reverted to co-operation with the Manchester interest, was a confirmation of the two peers’ previous coalition to resist Proby’s family’s pretensions to a seat for the county. In 1811 in the same county Lord Proby was edged out of the running by a more radical challenger, Leeds, but Leeds found that he could not afford a contest and withdrew on the eve of poll. In 1814, during the abeyance of the Manchester interest, Sandwich thwarted the candidature of a fresh contender for a vacancy by combining with Lord Proby’s family against him. In Kent the financial exhaustion of the contenders facilitated peace between 1807 and 1818.\n\nA show of hands was sufficient to deter Walter Fawkes from offering for Lancashire in 1818. Another deterrent, mildly resented unless used with discretion, was the bringing in of a stopgap to maintain an established interest. The cases of John Matthews in Hertfordshire in 1803 and of Coke and Astley in Norfolk in 1807 were unexceptionable; less popular were the choices of Lancelot Brown, Capability’s son, for Huntingdonshire (1792-4) as locum tenens for Lord Hinchingbrooke, and of Cradock Hartopp in Leicestershire (1798-1806) as stopgap for the Duke of Rutland’s brother; while in Norfolk in 1817 Edmund Wodehouse was exposed to ridicule as a likely stopgap for his kinsman, the heir of Kimberley. In 1794 Sir Gilbert Heathcote was thwarted in Lincolnshire because he was not of age and non-resident, but in 1796 Thorold, one of the sitting Members, retired in his favour. In Lincolnshire in 1816 Sir Robert Heron withdrew rather than fight Cust, while in 1818 Cust made way for Charles Chaplin, whose father’s death had caused the vacancy in 1816 but who had not then thought it proper to come forward—this time, however, Heron persevered in a contest. In 1807 Sir Francis Burdett, reported to have spent £100,000 on Middlesex elections over five years, turned his attention to Westminster and the county quietened down. A contest in Norfolk in 1790 was averted by the withdrawal of Astley, who had switched sides during the Regency crisis and lost credibility. In 1796 a second candidate to fight government’s battle in the same county could not be found, nor on the vacancy a year later did a ministerialist candidate challenge ‘King Tom’ Coke’s choice of Astley. Lord Howick, whose father was not expected to live long, withdrew from a contest for Northumberland in 1807, feeling it was not worth the expense to him. In Oxfordshire in 1815 the Duke of Marlborough likewise could not afford the expense of a contest on behalf of a member of his family. In 1806 Sir Corbet Corbet found the sense of the county against him in Shropshire, and withdrew.\n\nContests were averted by consensus in Somerset in 1792, 1795 and 1796, and though a contest threatened in 1806, two contenders withdrew in good time, and the third, Gore Langton, with less readiness, complaining of the use of professional agents in his opponents’ canvass and of their financial resources: his excuse was different when he was defeated at the poll in 1807, but on persevering in 1812 he secured the retirement of Lethbridge, which let him in unopposed. In Hampshire in 1807 one of the two opposition candidates retired before the poll, and his more obstinate colleague might as well have done likewise. A year later the by-election contest was a prearranged one, turning on the eligibility of the stronger candidate: only 63 token votes were cast. As it happened, the House paid no attention and took no action against the Member returned. In Staffordshire in 1812 Sir John Wrottesley, a Whig who had been hard put to it to dissuade Sir Charles Wolseley from standing on a radical platform, himself retired in the face of competition from Edward John Littleton, nephew of the retiring Member. Sir William Rowley, a Whig contender in Suffolk, also yielded to force majeure in 1796 and 1805, whereby political compromise was maintained in the county. In Surrey in 1818 Samuel Thornton made way without ado for a successor congenial to him. In Wiltshire, though discontent with the quality of the county representatives was expressed in 1806, a contest was averted until 1818: then, however, there was more than a little violence. Occasional contests were an outlet, and if a county remained undisturbed for a very long period, a contest was likely to be correspondingly bitter, extravagant and turbulent: but the licking of wounds could also be rapid. After the mammoth contest for Yorkshire in 1807, a petition being lodged against Viscount Milton’s return, the threat of a counter-petition by Milton’s friends was sufficient to make Wilberforce call pax.\n\nPetitions against county returns were rare, despite some notorious examples. Sir Francis Burdett, successful in the contest for Middlesex in 1802, was unseated on petition in 1804, unseated his successful opponent Mainwaring in 1805, and was again unseated early in 1806. In Norfolk, where the contest had been so close in 1802 that there was a scrutiny of the poll, Coke and Windham were unseated after their success in 1806 on grounds of treating, but were easily replaced by two other Whigs. In Herefordshire in 1802 Cotterell was also unseated for treating, but his opponent’s petition, which turned on the issue of 5s. vouchers, was regarded as unfair, and a locum tenens kept his seat warm for Cotterell. The Kent petition of 1796 turned on Honywood’s claim that Geary bought Knatchbull’s second votes by shouldering expenses: it got nowhere, and at the ensuing election Honywood was not challenged when he entered into a similar agreement with Geary. Perhaps the most controversial petition was from Hampshire in 1806: it complained of blatant government interference on behalf of the successful ministerial candidates. It did not succeed, but the Grenville ministry were forced into debate and an embarrassing division on the issue, 13 Feb. 1807, in which they were deserted by a number of their regular supporters. Petitions touching on the eligibility of Members came from Middlesex (1805), Hampshire (1808) and Gloucestershire (1810). In the first and last cases the legitimacy of the Members was the issue, and in the second age and qualification. Petitions, like threatened contests, often petered out.\n\nThirteen counties did not go to a poll at all: Buckinghamshire, Cheshire, Cumberland, Derbyshire, Lancashire, Monmouthshire, Northumberland, Nottinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Rutland, Shropshire, Staffordshire and Warwickshire, with some 50,000 electors among them ranging from about 800 in ‘mousehole’ Rutland to ten times that number in Lancashire. In Staffordshire it was claimed ‘this county has been without a contest for so many years that the voters hardly know what it means and promise as a matter of course’. This is not to say that there were no threats of contests in most of these counties, but they achieved an arrangement ‘to preserve the peace of the county’, still a prevalent ideal, involving withdrawal in the face of an unfavourable canvass, concession, compromise, or bowing to the decision of the county meeting without going beyond a show of hands by the freeholders present. The memory of a ruinously expensive contest which left the competitors financially exhausted could also act as a contributory deterrent, as happened in this period in Buckinghamshire. In Oxfordshire too the memory of the contest of 1754 was still alive: there was no other until 1826. In some counties the ‘peace’ was preserved over long periods: in Cheshire there was no contest between 1734 and 1832, in Derbyshire none between 1768 and 1820, in Dorset none between 1727 and 1806, in Lancashire none between 1747 and 1820, in Monmouthshire none between 1771 and 1832; none in Northumberland between 1774 and 1826, in Nottinghamshire none between 1722 and 1832, in Rutland none between 1761 and 1831, in Shropshire none between 1722 and 1831, in Staffordshire none between 1747 and 1832, in Warwickshire none between 1774 and 1820.\n\nNine counties suffered only one contest in this period: Bedfordshire (1807), Cornwall (1790), Gloucestershire (1811), Leicestershire (1818), Northamptonshire (1806), Suffolk (1790), Westmorland (1818), Worcestershire (1806) and Yorkshire (1807). Three of these (Bedfordshire, Gloucestershire and Suffolk) had been contested in 1784, but apart from this single further contest, they were at peace until 1820, 1832 and 1830 respectively. This was also Cornwall’s only contest between 1774 and 1831, Leicestershire’s between 1775 and 1830, Northamptonshire’s between 1748 and 1831, Westmorland’s between 1774 and 1820, and Yorkshire’s between 1742 and 1820. In Worcestershire it was claimed in the contest of 1806 that only four freeholders survived who had voted at the last contest (1741). As Yorkshire had far and away the biggest county electorate in England, a contest, particularly such a close one as that of 1807, was a memorable occasion, and for the antagonists an expensive one. Earl Fitzwilliam spent nearly £100,000, and was prepared to spend more, on his son’s behalf; Lascelles spent about the same and was reported as saying he wished his father would give him the money instead of the seat-he subsequently came in for Westbury, a patronal borough, at a fraction of the expense. Wilberforce, who topped the poll and was a relatively poor man aided by public subscription, exercised every economy in a contest that was not directed against him, but spent £28,000. Expenses in other counties were less, but the Duke of Bedford’s revenge in Bedfordshire in 1807 cost about £10,000. Ironically, the rowdiest of these contests was that for Leicestershire in 1818, where the political content seems to have been least of all of them.\n\nEighteen of the 40 English counties had more than one contest in this period. Berkshire had three, Cambridgeshire two, Devon four, Dorset two, Durham two, Essex two, Hampshire four, Herefordshire three, Hertfordshire four, Huntingdonshire two, Kent five, Lincolnshire three, Middlesex four, Norfolk three, Somerset two, Surrey five, Sussex two and Wiltshire two. It will be observed that the home counties of Middlesex, Surrey, Kent and Hertfordshire were the most frequently contested, being areas with a multiplicity of territorial interests frequently in flux, and where there was a relatively high level of political activity under metropolitan influence. Until 1807 at least, Middlesex elections formed part of the national political debate, and more space was given to them in the press throughout the country than to any others. It is noteworthy that only one of the counties that had more than one contest, Durham, was in the north of England, and even there, so Lord Durham later alleged, ‘There was no public feeling in it of any description’. Despite this, the contest of 1790 was reckoned the most expensive in the country.\n\nThe landed gentry were competitors for the county seats, and contests were often primarily due to their inability to agree among themselves, though they were exacerbated by political differences. In counties where the prevailing territorial interests were aristocratic, there was less likelihood of a contest, provided that the peers in question did not overreach themselves. If they had boroughs at their command, they often found it prudent to leave the county to the gentry. If they had one county seat under their influence it was dangerous to bid for the second and court the accusation of monopoly. Thus in Bedfordshire the Duke of Bedford could be sure of one seat, but in contending for the other lost it (1794), regained it with the help of Lord Bute (1807) and lost it again (1818). In Buckinghamshire the Marquess of Buckingham might control one seat, but his wish to settle the representation without reference to county meetings was resented, and was resisted by the Independent Club which called on the Duke of Portland to redress the balance by sponsoring his son, until on the duke’s death an unexceptionable scion of the country gentry took over the seat. In Cambridgeshire, Lord Hardwicke and the Duke of Rutland shared the honours, but could not, as they found to their cost, make the gentry acquiesce in the automatic election of members of their families. In Cumberland, Lord Lonsdale shared the honours with the gentry, but with the peer a ministerialist and the country gentlemen independent or in opposition and prodded by the Dukes of Portland and Norfolk in turn, the stalemate was a source of tension, particularly when Lord Morpeth contrived to come in on the independent interest with the approval of Lonsdale. In 1818 the resentment at what many freeholders regarded as an aristocratic plot to tranquillize the county was such that it was correctly forecast that Morpeth would not succeed next time—he was ousted by Curwen, a country gentleman. In Derbyshire, on the other hand, the Duke of Devonshire quietly shared the representation with the gentry, and the political compromise proved acceptable. In Durham, Lord Darlington secured both Members in 1806, but had to settle for one subsequently. In Gloucestershire the established compromise whereby the Duke of Beaufort returned one Member and the Earl of Berkeley the other collapsed in 1810, when although their politics no longer proved a bar to their supporting the same candidate, himself the son of a peer aligned with Beaufort, the aristocratic coalition was defeated by Sir William Guise, who rallied the independent gentry. Less than a year before, the legitimacy of Viscount Dursley, the Earl of Berkeley’s heir, had been the main issue at a by-election. In Herefordshire the Duke of Norfolk might return a Member, but he had to fight for it. In Hertfordshire the triumph in 1790 of a Whig country gentleman, William Baker, over a candidate supported by the Marquess of Salisbury was described by his party chief the Duke of Portland as ‘the most brilliant even’. Lord Salisbury was revenged in 1802, but further discomfited by Baker in 1805. Even when Lady Salisbury promoted a ‘Foxhunting’ club to assist the pretensions of the Hatfield protégé, Thomas Brand, he was not indebted to the Hatfield interest for his eventual return, and the Salisburys failed to procure the return of their heir Lord Cranborne in 1812. In Huntingdonshire the Earl of Sandwich and the Duke of Manchester formed an uneasy controlling coalition and would have kept out a third peer, Lord Carysfort, had the latter not secured Sandwich’s support for his heir for an interlude. The freeholders there found that they could not challenge the peers with any hope of success. In Lancashire (as in Derbyshire) a compromise whereby the Earl of Derby, who inclined to the Whigs, returned one Member and the Tory country gentry the other, operated smoothly. In Leicestershire the Duke of Rutland and Lord Stamford shared the honours through gentlemen of their choice, until in 1818 there was an acrimonious intervention of dissident gentry, which got out of hand and which was rectified at the next opportunity. In Lincolnshire, Lord Yarborough contrived the return of one Member from 1774 until 1802 and from 1807 until 1823; in the contest of 1818 the intervention of Earl Fitzwilliam on behalf of the second Whig candidate, Sir Robert Heron, caused Yarborough acute embarrassment: he was not himself striving for a monopoly. In Monmouthshire the Duke of Beaufort shared the honours with wealthy commoners, the Morgans of Tredegar. In Norfolk the conservative peers had to reckon with ‘King Tom’, Thomas William Coke; the return of Lord Wodehouse’s nephew at the by-election of 1817 was their only crumb of comfort. Coke himself repeatedly refused a peerage for many years. In Northamptonshire, Earl Spencer had great difficulty in securing the return of his heir Viscount Althorp in 1806. The Duke of Northumberland might be said to have secured the return of a Member for that county until his death in 1817, whereupon his successor did not exert himself: the duke’s desertion of Viscount Howick in favour of his own son in 1807, bitterly resented by the Whigs, had paved the way for this abdication. In Nottinghamshire the Duke of Portland conveniently shared the honours with Earl Manvers and in 1806 discouraged the Duke of Newcastle from interfering. The Duke of Marlborough shared Oxfordshire with the gentry, and the Marquess of Exeter Rutland with the Noel family, though in 1812 he was obliged to swallow the pretensions of Sir Gilbert Heathcote. The Duke of Bedford’s attempt to foist his brother on Hampshire in 1790 failed; and Lord Carnarvon’s son fared no better, except in 1806 when he had government support. In Staffordshire the Marquess of Stafford clung to one seat until 1820. Only Lord Cornwallis was allowed to encroach on gentry sway in Suffolk. The Duke of Bedford’s brother was ousted in Surrey, where he had sold out, in 1807. The Duke of Richmond secured a Member for Sussex through his influence in the western district, and in 1807 was one of ‘the array of aristocrac’ of which the unsuccessful candidate Sergison (himself supported by the Duke of Norfolk) complained. Westmorland was the only county where a peer, Lord Lonsdale, had pretensions to a monopoly, and when in 1813 he returned a second member of his family, the basis for a challenge to the Lowther ‘cubs’ by Henry Brougham in 1818 was laid: but he did not succeed, despite a bustling campaign that gave the election for that county unprecedented national undertones, and fanned resentment against aristocratic dominance in the northwest. Attempts to raise resentment against Wellesley Long in the Wiltshire contest of 1818 on account of his aristocratic connexions were effectively rebuffed by him. In Worcestershire, Lord Foley shared the honours with the Lygon family; not without political complications, for Foley, a Whig, returned the son of his Tory ally Lord Dudley in 1803; and the latter was ousted in 1806 by William Henry Lyttelton, a Whig who had shortly before failed to capture from William Lygon’s son the seat made vacant by his father’s elevation to the peerage. In Yorkshire, Earl Fitzwilliam had to wait until 1807 to recapture, through his son, a seat for the Whigs. When in 1812 the Earl of Harewood’s younger son captured the seat abdicated by Wilberforce, the latter lamented the plight of the county, divided between two great noblemen: in 1818 this ceased to be the case.\n\nThe counties where aristocratic influence was minimal or unobtrusive and the gentry tended to determine the representation included Berkshire, Cheshire, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Essex, Kent, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Shropshire, Somerset, Suffolk, Warwickshire and Wiltshire. As already indicated, the gentry and aristocracy compromised more or less easily in Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cumberland, Derbyshire, Herefordshire, Hertfordshire, Lancashire, Northumberland, Oxfordshire, Rutland, Staffordshire, Sussex and Worcestershire. Elsewhere they challenged aristocratic control. Tight-knit gentry organization to arrange the county representation proved in the long run no more feasible than the ipse dixit of a dominant aristocrat. In Wiltshire, where there was only one contest between 1722 and 1818, the ascendancy of the county club crumbled in this period and at Henry Hunt’s instigation the unfitness of both sitting Members was decreed publicly in 1809. In Buckinghamshire the Independent Club succumbed to the patronage of the Duke of Portland. The Cornish Club concerned itself more practically with promoting a political compromise for the county to avert a repetition of the contest of 1790. The Devon County Club came into being to support one man—Viscount Ebrington. In Dorset and Shropshire, to take the most obvious examples, the gentry prided themselves on resolutions condemning expenditure on county elections. Lady Salisbury’s ‘Foxhunting’ club in Hertfordshire was intended to boost Thomas Brand’s candidature. The Constitutional Club in Hampshire was the stronghold of the conservative gentry.\n\nAnother device of the gentry for sharing the representation of the county that was thrown into confusion in this period was the territorial compromise whereby one knight represented one district of the county and the other knight the other district. This applied in any case only to a few counties where such a territorial division seemed appropriate, such as Kent (East and West), Somerset (East and West), Sussex (East and West) and Wiltshire (North and South). Convenient as this convention was, it fell by the wayside when competition became really fierce, and the complaints of the disadvantaged candidates that their territorial claims were being ignored do not seem to have carried much weight. In Kent in 1790 Marsham, from West Kent, was put out by Knatchbull and Honywood, both from East Kent, and in 1796, although Sir William Geary (West Kent) appealed to the custom against the same opponents, it was scarcely an operative factor in his success. In 1807 Gore Langton, the defeated candidate in Somerset, complained that East Somerset was now unrepresented: a territorial compromise had certainly operated there in 1792, but it was invoked above all to avert a contest. In 1807 Sergison, the unsuccessful candidate from East Sussex, made a similar complaint about the flouting of convention. Between 1809 and 1812 there was much talk of the need for a North Wiltshire candidate on the next vacancy for the county, owing to the existence of populous districts there. This led only to ingenious electoral cartography: Paul Methuen, who was to obtain the seat, was informed, 20 Jan. 1812, by his kinsman Sir John Methuen Poore:\n\nI understand it is said that one of the Members should be a North, the other a South Wiltshire gentleman, and to bring a certain gentleman into the limit of North Wiltshire his party has made the Bath Road from Hungerford through Devizes the boundary; by this division you certainly will meet their wishes.\n\nThe development of freeholders associations in this period was significant. The Yorkshire Association of 1779 had set the precedent, but it never recovered from its schism in 1784. It was the Middlesex Freeholders Club of 1804, wedded to Sir Francis Burdett’s radical politics, that renewed the movement, aiming at the nation’s attention, and appealing to the freeholders at large. Echoes of this movement were heard in Essex, and in several counties in the Midlands. In Essex, Montagu Burgoyne mustered an independent freeholders club to support his candidature in 1810. In Staffordshire the freeholders association of 1810 promoted the candidature of a radical gentleman, Sir Charles Wolseley, and seriously embarrassed the Whig gentry. In Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, at the same time, independent freeholders associations were promoted to enlist the yeomanry, led by dissident Whig gentlemen such as George William Leeds of Croxton. Only the Middlesex Freeholders Club can be said to have succeeded to any extent in its championship of Burdett; but it failed to preserve his seat for him and, with his departure to the Westminster constituency, it lost its impetus. Sir Charles Wolseley ceded his pretensions to the Whig candidate in Staffordshire (and in 1819 resurfaced as self-elected Member for unenfranchised Birmingham), while in Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire the yeomanry found that they could not produce a candidate in time for the election of 1812, and William Wells failed miserably in Huntingdonshire in 1818. Radical candidates elsewhere fared badly. Sir Joseph Mawbey, a radical of the Wilkite school, was defeated for Surrey in 1790, John Wilkes likewise failing to secure his return. Sir Thomas Turton, the champion of south bank radicalism, was defeated for Surrey in 1812 and 1813. Sir Francis Burdett, with every resource at his disposal, gained Middlesex in 1802, lost it in 1804, regained it on petition early in 1805, but lost it for ever in 1806. The radical Whigs Thomas Brand and Sir Robert Heron failed respectively in Cambridgeshire in 1802 and Lincolnshire in 1818. Montagu Burgoyne, a radical gentleman, fared respectably, with some Whig support, in a straight fight in the Essex by-election of 1810, but foundered in a tripartite contest in 1812. William Hallett made only a little progress in Berkshire, which he contested in 1812 and 1818. Radical outsiders seldom did well. Although Samuel Ferrand Waddington, a London radical who contested St. Albans borough in 1796, mustered 408 votes when he stood for the county as well, benefiting from the growing desire for peace, Samuel Colleton Graves, who eschewed any expense, could collect only 19 votes in three days for Devon in 1812. On the other hand Edward Sugden, the future Lord St. Leonards, was discomfited by the Sussex radicals when they opted to prop up Sir Godfrey Webster in 1818. In other counties radical movements were afoot, but did not put forward a candidate in this period.\n\nIn some counties there were special interest groups to be considered. The religious dissenters were a force to be reckoned with, particularly in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Devon, Hertfordshire, Northamptonshire, Suffolk, Sussex, Wiltshire and Yorkshire. In Bedfordshire, Whitbread rallied many of them to the Whig standard. In Hertfordshire, Waddington, the ‘itinerary’ radical candidate in 1796, received conspicuous dissenting support, as did Brand in 1805. In Northamptonshire, Viscount Althorp benefited from their support in 1806. In Suffolk, Sir Gerard Vanneck was their candidate in 1790. In Sussex, Sergison, the unsuccessful candidate in 1807, relied on their support. Wilberforce owed much to their support in Yorkshire. Many of them rallied to independent freeholders associations in the counties. In a few other counties the established clergy were prominent and it was not unusual for them to take part in the proposing or seconding of candidates at county nomination meetings: Durham and Shropshire spring to mind. In Norfolk the animosity of the clergy towards ‘King Tom’ Coke was held to be a contributory factor in his protégé’s defeat in the by-election of 1817. Religious questions as such were seldom involved in county elections, except to some extent in 1790 when Charles Fox for the Whigs was attempting to regain the ground he had lost to Pitt among the dissenters in 1784 by supporting the repeal of the Test Acts; and, more generally, in 1807, when ‘No popery’ became a rallying cry against the Whig candidates, and was duly raised in the contests for Bedfordshire, Durham, Huntingdonshire, Lincolnshire, Middlesex, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Yorkshire. Only in Dorset and Somerset was the slogan subdued during the contest.\n\nEconomic interest groups also had a role to play in county elections. The landed interest was taken for granted everywhere; but in Yorkshire, for instance, the clothiers of the West Riding influenced the result. In 1806 Lascelles gave up because he had forfeited their support; in 1807 they ensured Lord Milton’s success; in 1812 Lascelles wooed them with more success than Stuart Wortley (who retired) and was labelled ‘Member for the borough of Leeds’. In 1818 they were groping towards self-expression: Earl Fitzwilliam feared that ‘the junto of Leeds’ would put up a second string candidate to Lord Milton, thus provoking a contest. They did not find a candidate, and it appeared that mutual jealousy among the leading clothiers prevented them from pulling their weight. Similarly in Warwickshire it was an established tradition that one of the Members should represent the Birmingham interest: in this period Sir Robert Lawley, and after him Sir John Mordaunt and Dugdale did so. This did not altogether appease Birmingham: its more prosperous citizens were freeholders not only in Warwickshire but throughout the West Midlands and began as well to encroach on boroughs in the area in their quest for a political outlet. On 12 July 1819 the Birmingham reformers elected Sir Charles Wolseley, 7th Bt., of Wolseley Hall as their ‘legislatorial attorney’, to present their grievances to Parliament. In Durham and Northumberland the shipping interest was a force to be reckoned with: in Durham in 1802 they lent their weight to a political compromise, though they could not bring it off in 1807. In Northumberland in 1807 Viscount Howick was the less disposed to fight for his seat in that he had lost the Shields shipping interest through its dislike of the American intercourse bill. In Gloucestershire the clothiers went so far as to back the candidature of Sir George Paul in 1806, but he withdrew.\n\nThe interest of the government as a suasive factor in county elections varied in its operation. In particular, it had many votes more or less at its command in maritime counties such as Kent and Hampshire, owing to the presence of the dockyards. In Hampshire it was thought to sway about one-sixth of the electorate, and it was precisely in this county that ministerial intervention became a controversial issue in the election of 1806. In general, however, government interference was circumscribed. Ministerial candidates advertised that they were on the side of the angels, and requested applications from the Treasury to placeholders and influential individuals on their behalf: they thought they had reason to complain if placemen did not support them, and government displeasure was sometimes visited on recalcitrant individuals. The most striking example is that of the banker Thomas Coutts, from whom government withdrew confidence on the ground that he had backed his son-in-law Burdett for Middlesex in 1802.\n\nThat government had an advantage in county elections on the first dissolution after coming to power seems undeniable, given the successes of the Whigs in power in 1806 and of their opponents in power the following year, but the advantage was liable to fade at subsequent elections, at least to some extent, according to the government’s performance. Political issues were at their height in county elections, as in the rest, in 1807 and 1818. This is reflected not only in the number of contests, but in the great publicity attending these elections. Ministerial candidates in 1807 benefited from the reaction against the Grenville ministry’s attempt to push Catholic relief and rallied opinion to the safeguard of the establishment in State and Church. In 1818 the trend was contrary: opposition benefited from post-war discontent and the government’s lack of self-confidence. In 1802, while ministers’ achievement of peace with France was a likely asset to them, their timidity and vacillation, stemming from Addington at their head, produced only embarrassment when they were appealed to in county contests. The elections of 1790, 1796 and 1812 were not remarkable for political content in the counties: in 1790 the Whigs were admittedly keen on revenging the debacle of 1784 and in some cases organized victory, but there were setbacks too. In 1796 there was some clamour for peace, but the Whigs did not benefit from it, though they did unseat the ‘turncoat’ Portland Whig in Herefordshire. In 1812 the noise came from the radicals, to little effect.\n\nThe county Members may be classified as follows. No less than 45 of them bore aristocratic titles, real or courtesy titles, on their return to Parliament. These included seven Irish peers (Upper Ossory, Verney, Ludlow, Wenman, Carbery, Henniker and Muncaster, of whom Verney and Muncaster were also English baronets). There were 21 heirs apparent to peerages (Lords Titchfield, Hinchingbrooke, Blandford, Gower [bis], Temple, Worcester, Brome, Morpeth, Proby, Althorp, Howick, Newark, Dursley, Percy, Milton, Tavistock, Barnard, Stanley, Lowther and Ebrington). The remaining 17 were styled ‘Lord’ as the younger sons or brothers of dukes or marquesses, viz: Lords George and John and George Augustus Henry Cavendish; Lords Edward Charles, William and William Henry Cavendish Bentinck; Lord William Russell; Lord Frederick Montagu; Lords Charles and Francis Almeric Spencer; Lords Charles and Robert Manners; Lord Francis Godolphin Osborne; Lords Arthur, Robert Edward Henry and Granville Somerset; and Lord Granville Leveson Gower. The Duke of Beaufort had four sons who were county Members; four members of the Duke of Portland’s family were also returned for counties. This list does not include younger sons and brothers of earls and barons, or heirs to titles in their mother’s right like Thomas Brand (Hertfordshire); and it would be idle to compute how many of the baronets and country gentlemen returned for counties had peerage connexions. A number of them looked to, and a few (such as Sir John Wodehouse, Sir John Rous and James Grenville) obtained peerages as a reward for public and political service, while some declined the honour. Thomas William Coke of Norfolk apparently did so at least five times before eventually succumbing.\n\nThe representation of a county by an aristocrat, particularly by the eldest son of a peer, was frequently disapproved when a county seat was contested or at least in competition. In Northamptonshire, Viscount Althorp in 1806 was criticized not only as the heir of a peer, but as the heir of a peer who was in Lord Grenville’s cabinet. Viscount Dursley’s legitimacy was challenged in Gloucestershire in 1810. While peers with an important interest in a county might think that they could best pull their weight by returning their heirs, they themselves sometimes changed their minds: the Duke of Marlborough, dissatisfied with the ungovernable conduct of his heir the Marquess of Blandford, returned for Oxfordshire in 1790, withdrew him in favour of his brother in 1796. The Duke of Portland, whose heir the Marquess of Titchfield sat for Buckinghamshire, was prepared to withdraw him when he decided to sell his estate in that county. Titchfield was allowed to remain Member, but Lord William Russell, the Duke of Bedford’s brother, was eventually driven out of Surrey after disposing of his property there. The Earl of Sandwich was so keen for his heir Viscount Hinchingbrooke to represent Huntingdonshire that he returned an obvious stopgap until his son was of age. The Hon. Richard Neville, candidate for Berkshire in 1812, was assailed by his radical competitor Hallett as the son of a peer and pensioner.\n\nThere were moreover 47 baronets who sat for the shires in this period (two of them, Sir Ralph Verney and Sir John Pennington being also Irish peers). Of these only five were first baronets; eleven were second baronets; three were third baronets; four were fourth baronets; eight were fifth baronets; nine were sixth baronets; three were seventh baronets; two were eighth baronets and two (Sir John Thorold and Sir Edward Knatchbull) were ninth baronets, the last mentioned having succeeded his late father to his seat for Kent in 1819. Two Mordaunts, father and son, sat for Warwickshire, two Noels, father and son (the latter before succeeding to the baronetcy) for Rutland, but some other baronets had sons sitting for borough seats. Of the 47 baronets, only 13 ever sat for any other than county seats, all of them in making their debut in Parliament, and of these Sir Francis Burdett was the only one who was returned for a city (Westminster) after sitting for a county: even he, in later life, reverted to a county seat. Sir Gilbert Heathcote sat for two counties (Lincolnshire and Rutland) in turn. Sir William Lemon sat for Cornwall for 50 years without a break, and faced only one contest (which was not directed against him).\n\nThe majority of the county Members were well-to-do country gentlemen with substantial estates. Occasionally the fact that some of them owed their substance to a background of mercantile wealth rankled: Sir Lawrence Palk in Devon was labelled a nabob, and William Dickinson in Somerset was reproached for his associations with the ‘monied interest’. At the Lincolnshire election in 1807 the defeated candidate Richard Ellison, banker first and landowner second, was found de trop:\n\nA borough seat\n\nIs banker’s meat\n\nA county’s for his master\n\nJohn Matthews, locum tenens for Cotterell in Herefordshire 1803-6, had been a surgeon. Lancelot Brown, stopgap for Lord Hinchingbrooke in Huntingdonshire 1792-94, was the son of ‘Capability’ Brown, the landscape gardener. There were doubts about the legitimacy of Mainwaring, Burdett’s opponent in Middlesex in 1804, the King himself being among the sceptics: but the issue was shelved.\n\nIt should not be supposed that a long rent roll was essential in a county Member: it helped, of course, but character and credit, respectability, local popularity and attention to business were in the long run more important. The outstanding example of this was William Wilberforce, Member for Yorkshire, who did not possess broad acres but was the pride of his countrymen: on 7 Dec. 1806 he reflected, ‘I never attend races or even assizes, which Members for Yorkshire before me used to do; and yet I have been elected five times, and never with more unanimity than the last’. In 1807 his election victory was commended as being ‘from mere weight of character in such an election as this, where money is supposed to do all’. Other county Members had their characters impugned: Sir Jacob Henry Astley of Norfolk felt obliged to defend himself on the hustings against charges of being a bad landlord and a bad husband; Sir Godfrey Webster was thought to be too fast for Sussex in 1818; but both of them managed to retain their seats. The Wiltshire Members came under attack for neglect of parliamentary duty: none of them appears to have had anything to say in debate between 1790 and 1812. This state of affairs was not permitted to continue. Local issues occasionally played their part in governing the county’s choice: in Middlesex, Burdett’s victory over Mainwaring in 1802 had its roots in his attack on the latter as a magistrate connected with the setting up of the ‘Bastille’, the Coldbath Fields prison. Middlesex also went so far as to instruct its Members by resolution, 29 Oct. 1800, on a national issue, urging them to oppose the continuance of war. Members had to pay attention to county meetings at which their political conduct might be called into question: such meetings proved a gauge of their hold on public opinion in their county. There was a spate of them in the English counties on the outbreak of war (1793), against the sedition bills (1795), on the King’s dismissal of the Grenville ministry (1807), against taxation and for retrenchment (1815) and after the Peterloo tragedy (1819), and they constituted a forum for a local debate on national issues at which resolutions were carried indicative of the political sense of the county.\n\nWhile the calibre of county Members varied greatly, they stood on their dignity in the House of Commons. The drunken buffoonery of John Fuller (Sussex) was considered unbecoming. They frequently moved or seconded the address, or the amendment to it. In debates on country matters, local government, Poor Law, militia and taxation they were particularly prominent. Critical motions, too, were enhanced by their part in them: Wilberforce’s pacific motions of 1794 and 1795, seconded by his colleague Duncombe, received a degree of support from county Members that the ministers found alarming. The same thing occurred over the property tax in March 1816. Ministers, in turn, were gratified to find county Members who were prepared to shoulder business on their behalf. In division lists published in newspapers, county Members were not infrequently distinguished from their fellow Members to stress their importance. Political independence was nevertheless the accepted stance of the county Member, often proclaimed in election addresses and in debate. He claimed the right to judge issues on their merits without prejudice to his political consistency. In the last resort, the independent attitudes of county Members derived from the tradition of Country versus Court: as Thomas William Coke of Norfolk put it, ‘Kings might make peers, but they could not make a county Member’. There was a prejudice against their being office-holders: in Somerset in 1806 William Dickinson, who only a year or so before had given up his parliamentary duties to make sure that he obtained the chairmanship of quarter sessions in the county, declined public office, lest he damage his election prospects. In 1810 Charles Yorke was discomfited when seeking re-election for Cambridgeshire after his appointment to the lucrative sinecure of teller of the Exchequer.\n\nNo change was made in the representation of the counties in this period. An addition to the number of county Members had been one of the most significant demands of the county associations of 1780, and Pitt in 1783 had mooted a reform that added 100 county Members. In 1785 he had proposed to add 36 (to the counties and the metropolis) as well as to enfranchise copyholders. The Friends of the People in 1794 likewise suggested increasing the county representation, and Charles Grey duly embodied this proposition in his reform motion of 1797. Lip-service was paid to the notion in subsequent Whig reform motions, but after 1809 the emphasis was on enfranchising populous districts rather than counties per se, and until 1822 when Lord John Russell resumed the theme of a comprehensive reform, proposals for altering the county representation were often confined to the largest counties like Yorkshire, which was in fact awarded two additional Members on the disfranchisement of the borough of Grampound, 30 May 1821. The fear expressed by Lord North in opposition to Pitt’s proposals that a large addition to the county representation would give an overwhelming advantage to the landed interest, particularly in less populous counties, had meanwhile been elaborated upon by others. The notion of converting corrupt boroughs into enclaves of hundreds within counties where county interests might operate won more favour: it had been applied before 1790, and was extended now to Shoreham and Aylesbury. The abuses prevalent in county elections were a more congenial subject of parliamentary debate than a reform in county representation.\n\nTHE ENGLISH BOROUGHS\n\nThere were 203 English boroughs, returning 405 Members: 196 boroughs returned two Members each; 5 boroughs returned one only (Abingdon, Banbury, Bewdley, Higham Ferrers and Monmouth); while 2 boroughs (London and the combined Weymouth and Melcombe Regis) returned four Members each.\n\nFRANCHISE\n\nSix kinds of borough franchise may be distinguished: householder franchise; freeman franchise; scot and lot franchise; corporation franchise; burgage franchise; and freeholder franchise.\n\nHouseholder. Thirteen boroughs, Aylesbury (until 1804), Cirencester, Hindon, Honiton, Ilchester, Minehead, Northampton, Pontefract, Preston, St. Germans, Taunton, Tregony and Wendover enjoyed householder, or more colloquially ‘potwalloper’ franchise: that is, all inhabitant householders qualified by six months’ residence (a year at St. Germans) could vote, unless they were almsmen or paupers. The total voting strength of these probably did not exceed 6,000 in 1790, and was no more than about 8,000 in 1818. The electorates in question varied in size, St. Germans the smallest having only seven householders at the end of this period, while at Preston there were nearly 3,000, the electorate having almost doubled since 1790. In the smaller of these boroughs, which were virtually pocket boroughs, contests were avoided. St. Germans was entirely controlled by Lord Eliot throughout; Hindon, with 200 voters, was quietly shared by William Beckford and Sir Henry Gough (afterwards Lord) Calthorpe and, after being contested eight times between 1768 and 1784, had no contests in this period. Wendover, purchased by the Whig speculator Church in 1788 and sold to Pitt’s friend Lord Carrington by 1796, returned their nominees quietly and indifferently. The remaining ten boroughs, with larger electorates, were open to venality and irregularity and were frequently contested. Aylesbury (500 voters) was in 1804 disfranchised following the exposure of corruption at the election of 1802 and the franchise extended to freeholders of the surrounding hundred, which drew it into the orbit of county interests, but doubled the electorate and did not prevent further contests. At Cirencester, Lord Bathurst was sure of one seat but the other was keenly contested. At Minehead, John Fownes Luttrell lost one seat to an interloper, James Langston, in 1796 and both in 1802, but bought Langston out a year later and was thenceforth secure until 1832. At Honiton, where three firms of attorneys vied as agents for candidates, Sir George Yonge was ruined by the cost of maintaining an interest, and in 1802, when it was clear that he could no longer afford it, was spat upon and his wig set alight. In the same place Lord Cochrane subsequently proposed awarding his supporters ten guineas for having resisted bribery previous to his election, and in 1806, when William Cobbett offered his services gratuitously, he was abused as being little better than a thief. At Taunton the Market House Society, a respectable consortium who had taken over the control of the borough from the abeyant corporation, had to fight a rearguard action against the champions of the corporation until 1803. At Ilchester and Tregony the most astonishing examples of double dealing and corruption occurred: the former changed patrons seven times in this period, three times by trickery. After paying £53,000 for the borough in 1802 and assuring the electors that they were his entailed property, Sir William Manners was defeated by a junto that paid £30 a vote at the ensuing election. Three offenders were sent to prison when the irregularities were exposed on petition. Manners contrived to reverse this setback, but his harsh methods, which included reduction of the electorate by eviction, led to his downfall in 1818 when Lord Darlington, a Whig boroughmonger, challenged him. Darlington’s stratagems (like those of Langston at Minehead) included jerrybuilt houses. At Tregony the intrigues of Nicholas Middlecoat, a local innkeeper, spelt difficulty or doom for every would-be patron, nabob or country gentleman, and none of them was secure, not even Lord Darlington. Northampton, where the electorate rose to about 1,300, and Preston were in a different case. At Northampton the Comptons controlled one seat with the help of the corporation, while an independent anti-corporation party retained the other against frequent challenges, including a government-subsidized nominee in 1790, until 1818, when it cashiered its sitting Member Hanbury. At Preston, Lord Derby was good for one seat; the other passed in 1796 from the dissenting champions, the Hoghton family, to the textile manufacturing Horrocks family who, allied with the corporation, were largely responsible for doubling the electorate in this period and had a greater interest among textile workers than had any patron among the shoemakers of Northampton. Subsequently opposition at Preston took on a radical complexion: this had occurred too at Honiton in 1804 and 1806 and there was a radical at Taunton in 1812. None of these bids was ultimately successful, though Lord Cochrane secured Honiton for a spell. Pontefract was the most frequently contested of the householder boroughs—seven times in all. The chief reason was the continuation of the dispute over the franchise, adjudged in 1783 to be in the inhabitant householders, a decision that was contested by the burgage proprietors. Their repeated petitions failed to reverse the decision by 1793. Subsequently, although there was no contest until 1806, the borough was open, expensive and regularly contested. There were 39 out of 91 possible contests in general elections for these boroughs and six out of 42 at by-elections. Eight were contested in 1818, seven in 1802 and only three in 1806.\n\nFreeman. Ninety-one boroughs may be included in this general category, 87 of them returning two Members each, three (Bewdley, Higham Ferrers and Monmouth) one Member and one four Members (London, which had a livery franchise, but is included with the freeman boroughs): in all, 181 Members. Some of them had variations on the freeman franchise: in ten, freemen had to be resident (Bishop’s Castle, Chester, Dunwich, East Retford, Great Grimsby, Launceston, Monmouth, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Stafford and Hastings); while in five more, resident freemen had also to pay scot and lot (Boston, Camelford, Rye, Shrewsbury and Winchelsea) and in the case of Grampound and Lichfield, freemen, resident or not, had to pay scot and lot to vote. Four allowed the vote to freeholders as well as freemen: Bristol, Exeter, Norwich and Okehampton. In three it was allowed to householders as well as freemen, namely Bedford, Hertford and Tewkesbury. Two more, Leicester and St. Albans, allowed householders paying scot and lot, as well as freemen, to vote. Also anomalous were Guildford, where freeholders paying scot and lot could vote, as well as freemen; Huntingdon, where inhabitant householders paying scot and lot could also vote; Southampton, where mere inhabitants paying scot and lot could also vote; and Lichfield, where freeholders and burgage tenants paying scot and lot could vote along with freemen. Monmouth had two contributory boroughs, Newport and Usk, after the Welsh fashion.\n\nThe total electorate of these boroughs seems to have increased from about 75,500 in 1790 to about 83,000 in 1818. Much of the increase took place in a few boroughs. At Maldon following the grant of a new charter in 1810 the electorate increased tenfold, but the large, open and frequently contested boroughs were those where the increase was most marked: Berwick, Chester, Great Yarmouth, Lancaster, Leicester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Oxford, Rochester and Shrewsbury typify this. In several boroughs the electorate decreased, in some instances at the instigation of patrons who wished to make them more manageable and less expensive: this was the case at Aldeburgh, Dunwich, Evesham and Wigan. The smaller the borough, the greater the importance of the corporation and its patron, for the creation of freemen, whether they were entitled by birth, apprenticeship, marriage or redemption, was in its hands. The validity of freeman creations was, however, a frequent source of litigation.\n\nAs the electoral behaviour of freeman boroughs varied according to their size, they may be divided into (i) 26 large boroughs with electorates over 1,000; (ii) 26 boroughs with electorates of between 200 and 1,000; (iii) 39 small boroughs with fewer than 200 voters. The total number of contests for all freeman boroughs was 311 (56 at by-elections) out of a potential of 893 (637 at general elections and 256 on interim vacancies), but of these 311 contests, 132 occurred in the 26 large boroughs (an average of five contests each); 109 in the 26 medium boroughs (an average of four contests) and 70 in the 39 small boroughs (an average of two contests). In all, 19 of these boroughs were uncontested. Only one of the large boroughs, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, escaped a contest; Bedford and Hereford got away with one only; but Norwich had nine; London, Liverpool and Nottingham eight; and five large boroughs had seven. Of the medium sized boroughs, three (King’s Lynn, Ludlow and Monmouth) were uncontested and four others (Bridgnorth, Derby, Lichfield and Wells) had one contest only; Boston had nine; Barnstaple, Newcastle-under-Lyme and Rochester had eight. Of the 39 small boroughs, no less than 15 avoided a contest. Five more had only one contest. Hythe with seven contests and Grampound with six were at the other extreme.\n\nAmong the large freeman boroughs, London, even if its liveryman electorate was not as comprehensive as a freeman electorate would have been, had potentially 10,000 voters, though 8,000 was regarded as a more realistic figure. London ceased, however, in this period to be a focus for the radical movement, as it had been in the time of John Wilkes: radicalism was more vocal in the Westminster and Middlesex constituencies. While it remained a factor in London elections, provided candidates and gained ground again after 1815, it lacked charismatic leadership in the City. Its call for delegate Members who obeyed instructions from their constituents was upheld only by the veteran Member John Sawbridge, as an expedient by Sir Watkin Lewes, and by one newcomer, Alderman Combe. When Travers, an unsuccessful candidate in 1802, maintained the principle, The Times commented that it ‘would have degraded the British senator to the condition of a Dutch deputy’. Combe came under fire for his lack of concern for the economic interests of the City. The only Member returned in this period who was not a member of the corporation was Thomas Wilson, a merchant, in 1818. The privileges of the City were maintained by Members on both sides, as ministers found when they rejected the petition based on the common hall resolution of 1810. The Whigs had not one Member left in 1795, and only one between 1796 and 1818, when they took three out of four seats. Two of these Members, Waithman and Wood, were contenders for leadership of the radical revival who had clashed bitterly at the preceding election.\n\nBristol, the second city in the kingdom with some 5,000 voters, had just five contests, three of them trifling, thanks to the political compromise achieved in 1790. The interest of the Duke of Beaufort as a local magnate and two political clubs underpinned it, so opportunist radicals fared badly. Local issues stirred the electors most and in 1812 even a pillar of Whig orthodoxy, Sir Samuel Romilly, was defeated by a local candidate championing local interests.\n\nNorwich, with 3,000 and more electors, had a more turbulent municipal history, exacerbated in this period by the decline of the worsted industry, which adversely affected its weavers, nearly half the electorate. The alienation of the city’s dissenting élite in the course of the struggle between the Purple and Orange and Blue and White parties, and the political volte face of a brilliant Member, William Windham, added fuel to the fire in the 1790s. In 1802 Windham, who spent £8,000, was ousted in ‘a mixed triumph of Jacobinism and money’. In 1806 the candidates spent £35,000 on a contest which restored the balance, William Smith, one of the ‘Jacobins’ of 1802 being defeated by ‘a sudden clamour for a resident’. His replacement, Alderman Patteson, had prided himself on speaking for Norwich interests as Member for Minehead in the preceding Parliament. Following a split in his party and their failure to find a fit candidate, ‘Jacobinism and money’ triumphed again in 1818. The city had been contested continuously since 1780.\n\nCoventry, with 2,650 voters in 1796 (1,750 of them resident), was also expensive and rowdy: as at Norwich, the corporation was at odds with the middle and lower orders of voters, many of them engaged in manufacture. Wealth was required in candidates, but it never made them secure and they all lost their charms in the end; though Peter Moore, who had a scheme to benefit the city by importing Bengal silk, clung to his seat. Radicals appeared at the hustings in 1818 but put up no candidate.\n\nNottingham, where the electorate doubled in this period, was also rowdy, despite an attempt to work a political compromise: the clamour for a third man usually succeeded. It was the largest borough where the Whig and dissenting interest prevailed in the corporation, and when Daniel Parker Coke, the ousted Member in 1802, sought to contain rowdyism at elections by legislation a year later, opposition to it was led by Charles James Fox, the Whig generalissimo. At Leicester where the corporation party was opposed to the Whig and dissenting interest an attempt to operate a compromise in 1790 led to such violence that the dragoons were called in. Subsequently the Whigs were kept at arms’ length and although Samuel Smith adhered to their ministry in 1806-7 he used his interest with the corporation and his wealth to keep out a Whig third man in 1807. In 1818, significantly, the borough returned two local bankers.\n\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne, with 2,500 voters, contrived to avoid any contests, thanks to the operation of a political compromise: local issues and local representatives were the order of the day. At York, with about the same number of electors, compromise also prevailed until 1807, but following Sir Mark Masterman Sykes’s victory over the Whigs at that election, in which he doubled the voters’ fee, party animosity rekindled. Earl Fitzwilliam, the Whig paymaster at York, could eventually no longer restrain his party from attempting to carry both seats. As it was, he spent freely in the attempt to keep out Masterman Sykes in 1807, and in 1812 merely to keep the peace.\n\nCompromise was difficult at Liverpool, where a volatile electorate of over 2,000 would not permit it. In 1790 a coalition of Gascoyne and Lord Penrhyn had forced Tarleton to give up, but when the allies stopped the taps, the lower order of voters flocked to vote for Tarleton, who secured a record poll and ousted Penrhyn. Despite this, Gascoyne and Tarleton, political opponents, coalesced against third men in 1796 and 1802: in 1796 Tarleton’s brother was the challenger, trying to make capital out of their political differences and of the representation of the port by two military officers. His bid was castigated as ‘unnatural’, but Joseph Birch, merchant, did not succeed either in 1802. It was Tarleton’s turning coat that spurred the Whigs to throw him out in 1806: they had to spend £12,000 to their opponents’ £7,000 to return William Roscoe, but he was decisively beaten in 1807, the first Liverpool Member to oppose the slave trade. In 1812 there was a memorable all-out contest, Brougham and Canning being ranged against each other and giving the election more political content than Liverpool had ever known. The Whigs, spending £8,000 to their opponents’ £20,000, were defeated. Brougham took the opportunity of lecturing his Whig friends on the unrepresentative nature of the freeman electorate, large as it might be and resident as it was, which made Liverpool as good an illustration of the need for parliamentary reform as any close borough with few voters. In 1818 no less than 18 candidates were put in nomination at Liverpool during the course of the poll, though few received votes as it was a tactical manoeuvre.\n\nAt Kingston-upon-Hull, Lancaster and Worcester, all with 2,000 or more electors, the non-resident vote was an important factor at elections and no interest was secure. Viscount Deerhurst was defeated by the outvote at Worcester in 1812, while at Hull that year a passing ‘third man’ (on his way to contest Beverley) was waylaid and returned. At Hull in 1818 John Staniforth, who faced bankruptcy after spending half-a-million there in 16 years, was turned out. Another Hull Member observed, ‘the venal character of the place baffles any hope, which adherence to principles might inspire, and I fear the largest purse and the nearest face will continue paramount recommendations to my worthy constituents’. At Worcester in 1806, Bromley, a successful candidate, was frightened into vacating his seat by his opponent’s threat to expose his bribery and treating.\n\nThe following 14 freeman boroughs had between 1,000, and 2,000 voters: Bedford, Berwick, Beverley, Canterbury, Chester, Colchester, Dover, Durham, Exeter, Gloucester, Great Yarmouth, Hereford, Lincoln and Oxford. While the 12 freeman boroughs with over 2,000 voters averaged between five and six contests each, these 14 averaged between four and five. The least contested of the 14 were those most amenable to patronal control. There was only one contest at Bedford, where a Whig junto operated from 1790 on Samuel Whitbread’s replacing his father: it was supported by the Duke of Bedford and was prepared to create freemen on a large scale and pay the corporation debts to secure hegemony. Hereford, where a similar Whig junto operated, also had only one contest, in 1818 when, following the death of the Duke of Norfolk, the new high steward Lord Somers secured his son’s return. At Chester, Lord Grosvenor’s family held one seat continuously from 1715 to 1874 and both from 1790 until 1807: after contests in 1812 and 1818, he restored his control on the latter occasion. At Gloucester there was no contest from 1789 until 1805, a compromise operating. The Whig corporation were under the aegis of the Duke of Norfolk and had three times to resist the challenge of the Duke of Beaufort and his allies. At Exeter the corporation oligarchy could not prevent contests on three occasions.\n\nAt Lincoln, Durham, Oxford, Berwick, Beverley, Canterbury, Colchester, Dover and Great Yarmouth, the freemen preferred contests, and ‘a third man’ to thwart a combination of sitting Members to avert the expense of a contest was frequently sought: no interest was secure. At Lincoln several successive interests were swamped in expense. When in 1812 Lady Monson, the Whig patron, in spite of her imminent marriage to the ministerialist Lord Warwick, thought fit to sponsor a Whig candidate, she was defeated by a combination of a ministerialist and a more radical Whig. At Durham a combination of the Tempest and Lambton families to dominate the borough was likewise undermined, and when a member of either family held the county seat they thought it prudent not to aim for the borough representation. At Oxford the combination of the Duke of Marlborough and Lord Abingdon as patrons was undermined by a well-to-do third man, Henry Peters, in 1796; having no more money to spend, he was thrown out in 1802. The duke, after failing to pay his election bills, was excluded by a combination of the other candidates against his nominee in 1812 and in 1818 was alleged to have paid £20 for plumpers and £10 for second votes to recover a seat. Berwick, ‘almost as famous for its elections as for its smocks and salmon’, dismissed its patrons in turn as their resources were exhausted: Delaval, Lisburne, Callander, Hall. When Hall and his friend Fordyce had their election voided for bribery and treating in 1803, Hall pointed out that it was a time-honoured practice at Berwick and his substitutes won the fresh election. Under such an insecure regime, a radical reformer, Selby, netted as many as 176 votes in 1812. At Beverley, Lord Yarborough gave up the expense of acting as patron and in 1806 the electors were described as ‘scouring the country in all directions’ for a candidate. One Member for the borough, John Wharton, ruined himself by his election expenses, and another, Christie Burton, returned in 1818, was at the time in the Fleet for debt. Canterbury, so accustomed to political strife that the uncontested election of 1802 was the first for a century, only paused then because the parties were financially exhausted. Colchester, where the candidates spent £40,000 in 1812, ruined one of its Members, Robert Thornton, by the constant expense of bringing in outvoters, who constituted more than half the electorate. A radical, Daniel Whittle Harvey, who had espoused the cause of a new borough charter, was returned in 1818. At Dover it was the government that failed to hold on as patrons. At Great Yarmouth the Townshend, Anson and Suffield interests were successively eclipsed, and in 1812, for the first time for a century, a townsman, Lacon, was returned.\n\nOf the 26 freeman boroughs with more than 200 voters but fewer than a thousand, all but four had an electorate of over or approaching 500. The exceptions were Great Grimsby, King’s Lynn, Okehampton and Wells, and of these Lynn and Wells proved amenable to control, Okehampton settled for an attentive patron after a disturbed interlude, while Grimsby proved as impossible to control as most of the larger boroughs in this category: Charles Tennyson, after paying £5,500 to secure his election there in 1818, admitted ruefully that the time was not ripe for reform. Not all the boroughs with between 500 and 1,000 voters resisted quiet management: at Ludlow the Clive family, after a congenial compromise until 1806, named both Members thereafter, without a contest throughout. At Monmouth, with its two contributory boroughs, the Duke of Beaufort ruled supreme, though after 1818 a radical challenge threatened his hold. At Derby the Duke of Devonshire and the Cokes of Longford, both on the Whig interest, held a seat each and the only (ineffectual) challenge came from a radical in 1796. Bridgnorth too proved amenable to management and the lone contest in 1802 was a flash in the pan. At Lichfield the pact between the related families of the Marquess of Stafford and Anson, in which they sank their political differences, was opposed only once, in 1799, and the violence that then occurred made them cling to their agreement more resolutely. Incidentally, their creation of freeholds for election purposes, in a mixed franchise, effectively muzzled the freeman franchise. The dignity of Hertford and Tewkesbury was occasionally ruffled by a contest: in the latter a Whig attempt to sponsor householder franchise in 1796 was defeated. At Sandwich one seat was snatched by contest from the Admiralty and a compromise was finally achieved. Of the remaining boroughs in this group, Grantham and Carlisle had four contests. At Grantham Sir William Manners sought with scant success to undermine the Rutland/Brownlow interest in the borough and thereby only opened it to all comers. At Carlisle the Lonsdale interest was curbed by contest and the restriction of freedom: thereafter a free-for-all developed. Evesham, Ipswich, Stafford and Sudbury had five contests: the first two were open and expensive; so was Stafford, but money was not enough—popularity too was necessary. Sudbury was opened up by the demise of the Crespigny family interest. Shrewsbury and Southampton had six contests: that between the two branches of the Hill family in 1796 at the former was a byword for expense and elections were encumbered by the tender of a legion of unassessed votes. At Southampton the contests were challenges to the predominant interest of George Rose: only after his death in 1817 did the opposition triumph. St. Albans and Maidstone had seven contests apiece; Rochester, Newcastle-under-Lyme and Barnstaple eight each; and Boston had nine. At St. Albans the united interests of Lords Spencer and Grimston were undermined by the defeat of Spencer’s nephew in 1807 and he gave up his interest; while the want of an eligible member in the Grimston family threw the borough open, though it could not be bought, as the wealthy radical Waddington had discovered in 1796. Maidstone welcomed well-to-do businessmen as candidates to keep up the contest between Reds and Blues in the borough: it was represented by two stationers, a paper manufacturer, an East India merchant and a banker in this period. At Rochester contests were between the official candidates of the Admiralty and Ordnance and independents; no compromise was permitted to last. At Newcastle-under-Lyme the Marquess of Stafford’s control, challenged only once in the preceding period, was repeatedly resisted in this: in 1812 he lost one seat and it cost him £20,000 to regain control in 1818. At Barnstaple the venality of the electors defied all control: they were indifferent to the morals of their representatives; and in 1818 Sir Manasseh Lopes was unseated, fined and imprisoned for his open bribery. A bill to extend the franchise was lost in the Lords at the dissolution. At Boston there was no security, not even for Madocks, champion of the emancipation of the borough from the control of the Duke of Ancaster and the corporation: he had to pay up or lose his seat; and Maj. John Cartwright, the radical reformer, who refused to pay for votes, got only 59 votes in 1806 and a mere eight in 1807.\n\nThirty-nine freeman boroughs had up to 200 voters, and averaged only two contests apiece. There were no contests at all in 15 of them: Bewdley, Dunwich, Hastings, Higham Ferrers, Huntingdon, Lyme Regis, Lymington, Orford, Portsmouth, Rye, St. Mawes, West Looe, Wenlock, Wigan and Winchelsea: and this despite the fact that the patronage changed hands at Bewdley, Wigan and Winchelsea and was under frequent threat at Wenlock. At Portsmouth, admittedly, the status quo was twice undermined without a contest. Elsewhere there were threats and rumours of rebellion. Lyme, Lymington and Orford appear to have been utterly safe and at Rye Thomas Lamb was a patron ‘whose influence at this place no human power can shak’. Only three of these 15 uncontested boroughs had more than 200 electors (Huntingdon, Wenlock and Wigan).\n\nOf the 24 remaining, contested, boroughs in this category, the 11 with fewer than 100 electors—all but two were in Cornwall and Devon—were Aldeburgh (1 contest), Bossiney (2), Camelford (4), Chipping Wycombe (2), Dartmouth (1), East Looe (2), Grampound (6), Launceston (2), Liskeard (3), Plympton Erle (2) and Totnes (2). Aldeburgh could be sold to a Rotherham businessman for £39,000 in 1818; but had resisted a challenge to the previous owners, the Crespigny family, in 1812. Nor did challenges to the patrons succeed at Bossiney, Dartmouth (where a bid was made to establish the inhabitant vote in 1790), East Looe, Liskeard (where the inhabitant householder franchise was espoused), or Plympton Erle (where freedom by inheritance was canvassed). At Camelford, Chipping Wycombe, Grampound, Launceston and Totnes there was a struggle for control: the Duke of Northumberland lost Launceston to government acting through the Duke of Buccleuch in 1795, but regained it at the ensuing general election. Chipping Wycombe and Totnes were compromised. The Duke of Bedford secured a redefinition of the franchise at Camelford to include resident ratepayers in 1796 but sold out in 1811 to a kinsman of the former patrons, who in turn sold out to the highest bidder in 1815 for £51,000. Grampound was a special case, where the electors turned the tables on all would-be patrons, making a lucrative business out of it: the borough faced disfranchisement in 1820.\n\nThe 13 contested freeman boroughs with between 100 and 200 voters were Bishop’s Castle (3 contests), Cambridge (1), East Retford (4), Guildford (5), Hedon (3), Hythe (7), Maldon (4), Morpeth (1), New Woodstock (2), Plymouth (3), Poole (5), Queenborough(4) and Winchester (1). There was only one challenge to the Duke of Rutland’s control at Cambridge; and the only contest at Winchester, in which Sir Henry St. John Mildmay’s friend Richard Meyler spent, so he claimed, £20,000 to win a seat in 1812, was nullified on Meyler’s death before the next dissolution. The Earl of Carlisle lost one seat by contest at Morpeth in 1802 and then settled for a compromise. The hold of the Clive family over Bishop’s Castle was challenged with temporary success, and that of the Duke of Newcastle at East Retford overthrown in 1812, opening the borough. Lord Grantley had to fight for his control of one seat at Guildford. The Duke of Marlborough successfully resisted challenge at New Woodstock. Hedon and Hythe became increasingly open to all comers, the latter a favourite resort for London merchant candidates. At Plymouth the Admiralty interest suffered a setback and the Prince of Wales became a patron during three Parliaments: an unsuccessful attempt was made to revive the freeholder franchise there. At Poole every species of chicanery was practiced and no Member secure: brothers-in-law fought for a seat in 1818. At Queenborough the Whigs snatched both seats from the Ordnance and Admiralty in 1802, the first breach of the status quo since 1727. In a borough where freemen held places worth £2,368 p.a., opposition could not flourish for long. Maldon was a special case: its charter in abeyance, it had become ‘a county, not a borough intere’. The patron John Strutt, held to a compromise by Western, a political opponent, was at the same time threatened with a chartist movement to revive the franchise: ‘Whenever I hear the name of Maldon it makes me shudder and it takes away the little reason I have left’, he grumbled. In 1810 he allowed himself to become the promoter of a new charter which increased the electorate tenfold. Paradoxically, the compromise was maintained and there was no further contest until 1826.\n\nScot and lot. There were 37 scot and lot boroughs, not including Shoreham where the franchise was altered in 1771, but including Malton, where it was clearly defined in 1807. They returned 73 Members (Abingdon returning one only). Inhabitant householders paying the rates were entitled to vote in these constituencies. As already noticed, there was a scot and lot element in the franchise in 12 freeman boroughs (Boston, Camelford, Grampound, Guildford, Huntingdon, Leicester, Lichfield, Rye, St. Albans, Shrewsbury, Southampton and Winchelsea), and the same was true of three burgage boroughs (Bramber, Newport and Weobley). This discussion excludes them, though at Shrewsbury, for instance, the scot and lot vote played a vital role. Only two of the 37 boroughs in question were in the north of England (Aldborough and Malton). Dorset, Cornwall and Sussex (including the Cinque Port of Seaford) had five apiece. The total electorate was about 23,000 in 1790 and, probably, over 25,500 in 1818, an increase of little more than 10 per cent. Westminster made up over half this number; and together with Southwark (over 2,000 voters), Chichester, Leominster, Malton, Newark, Reading and Stamford covered 75 per cent of the total electorate. In the remaining 29 boroughs the average was about 200 voters, and six or seven of them had 100 or fewer. There were 112 contests in the 37 scot and lot boroughs, an average of 3 apiece, out of a total of 402 possible: 87 contests took place at general elections, when 259 contests were possible.\n\nNo contests took place for Aldborough, Amersham, Corfe Castle, Mitchell, Peterborough or Wareham. Of these, only Peterborough (up to 500 voters) was relatively populous. There Earl Fitzwilliam had a free hand, though he insisted on attention to the constituency. Aldborough returned the Duke of Newcastle’s nominees without a hitch; Mitchell was shared by Lord Falmouth first with Sir Francis Basset, then with Sir Christopher Hawkins, and was more manageable than most Cornish boroughs, where there was no such thing as peaceful enjoyment of patronage. Wareham was secure in the control of John Calcraft and Amersham in that of the Drakes of Shardeloes, who represented it themselves, father and son. Corfe Castle was quietly shared by the Bond and Bankes families. At Aldborough, Mitchell and Wareham seats were sold by the patrons.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, Westminster, the largest borough in Britain with 12,000 effective electors, was contested seven times and Southwark nine times. Westminster was the most observed of all constituencies and, potentially, the most expensive. Charles James Fox, who represented it as ‘the man of the people’, would have been content to compromise with the ministerial party after the exhaustive by-election of 1788, but in 1790 and 1796 John Horne Tooke challenged any such coalition as a radical of the Wilkes school, appealing to independent feeling. In 1802 Graham, and in 1806, more forcibly, James Paull adopted the same stance, confronting a formal union of Sheridan and Hood as supporters of the Whig ministry. This unmasking of the Whigs continued in 1807, despite a radical split, when Francis Place put his Westminster committee at the service of the emancipation of the constituency from aristocratic management. In Burdett and Cochrane two radicals were returned and survived unopposed in 1812; Cochrane also survived his expulsion from the House, his re-election solving the vexed problem of who was to succeed him. The subsequent schisms among the radicals resulted in a return to Whig orthodoxy in 1818, when Burdett took second place to Romilly, and in the by-election of 1819, when the Whigs showed that they had learned the new methods used by the radicals to organize victory in preceding elections, without resorting to extremism. Radicalism had become a fluid force without unity of purpose or leadership. It had not succeeded, either, in reducing the cost of Westminster elections by law, only by subterfuge, Burdett in 1807 having been acclaimed candidate without his formal acceptance of the role. At Southwark, George Tierney triumphed for the Whigs in 1796 when he unseated his ministerial opponent for treating, and thereby did much to purify the borough elections. Subsequently he became the orthodox Whig beset by radicalism and in 1806 was turned out by Turton, who held on in 1807. In 1812 and 1815, however, the Southwark radicals suffered a setback and a Whig-ministerial compromise prevailed.\n\nNewark, the third largest scot and lot borough, was contested in 1790 and 1796, when the nabob Paxton espoused the mere householder franchise, but he failed to disturb the arrangement whereby the Duke of Newcastle returned one Member and the Duke of Rutland and his kinsfolk, the Manners Suttons, and their friends the other. Reading, next in size, presented a livelier picture: it was open and the electors were fond of treats, though the gift of a giant turtle was not enough to secure Lord Barrymore’s return in 1790. The conservative corporation were opposed by the dissenting tradesmen and lavish competition between their re- spective candidates, Simeon and Lefevre, drove the veteran sitting Member Annesley into retreat in 1806. Despite an attempt to contain the squandering of resources on electoral ambition by public resolution, Reading remained expensive, even when ‘independence’ triumphed in 1818 with a radical flavour. Leominster proved uncontrollable, though a corporation which refused to assess its foes for rates was an important factor, as in most contested scot and lot boroughs. The nabob John Hunter paid five guineas each to 402 of his 462 supporters in 1796. The Duke of Norfolk, who had snatched a seat on petition after the election of 1790, went under to Lord Malden’s candidate in 1796, whereupon a duel took place between the two peers. Norfolk retrieved a seat in 1797, but he and Maiden both decided subsequently not to touch what they could not afford. Corporation agents now made what they could of a situation that attracted wealthy adventurers: the unseating of the Scotsman Cuningham Fairlie on petition in 1818 was the pretext for legislation enabling a Scottish qualification to suffice for contesting English seats. At Stamford, although the control of the lords of Burghley was uncontested from 1734 until 1809 and resisted challenge between then and 1831, there was a colourful attempt to discredit the whole system of pocket boroughs. Its exponent, Joshua Jepson Oddy, came forward as the emancipator of the borough from economic decay due to aristocratic domination, but he failed: nor did Gerard Noel, who took issue with the Stamfordians over their propensity for ‘bull running’ at elections, fare any better: but the borough was no longer closed. Chichester, with 600 voters, was unobtrusively managed by the dukes of Richmond, who claimed only one seat in 1790, survived challenges in 1791 and 1796, and assumed full control in 1812.\n\nOf the scot and lot boroughs with 500 or fewer electors the most frequently contested were Shaftesbury (six times) and Seaford (seven times). Shaftesbury, open and venal, was the scene of the most blatant intrigues. In 1790 the Treasury turned the tables on Mortimer, the local mafioso who had refused their terms for the seats, by getting his agent to undermine his interest. Mortimer revenged himself by selling his property to the nabob Benfield and encouraging opposition to him at the next election which, despite the expenditure of upwards of £17,000 by James Milnes, was unsuccessful. It was then Benfield’s turn to face ruin, his property being sold by the Treasury, as his principal creditors, to Mark Wood, a boroughmonger. The latter saw his candidates beaten in 1802 by a rebellious local attorney in league with the Duke of Norfolk. In 1806 Wood secured both Members, but only after a contest in which a member of the government sent down two candidates, admittedly unofficially, to challenge his nominees, who were also supposed to be supporters of the ministry. After another challenge to his interest in 1807 Wood grew weary of his purchase and negotiated its sale: the new purchaser had to resort to petition to seat his nominees after a further contest in 1812. The next buyer, Lord Rosebery, was fortunate to secure his nominees’ return unopposed in ISIS. At Seaford, thanks to the Duke of Richmond, government regained both seats in 1790, but lost one on petition and had to fight to maintain the other, for even when the Pelham family joined them in 1794, fresh sources of opposition arose. Three would-be patrons (John Durand, the Pelhams, and John Leach) in turn sold out, without stabilizing the situation.\n\nBridport, Bridgwater, Lewes and Windsor, with five contests each, were also in a fluid state. At Bridport, Charles Sturt had lost one seat by 1790, and although the dissenting majority on the corporation returned a former presbyterian minister, James Watson, as his colleague in 1790, they turned against Watson for his uncritical support of Pitt and rejected his brother-in-law in 1795 and 1796 in favour of a self-styled Whig champion of dissent, George Barclay. In 1802 Sturt was thrown out when Nepean of the Admiralty stepped in: the latter secured both Members in 1807, but in 1812, after Sturt had resumed the offensive, and died, the borough was thrown open, at least until Sturt junior obtained a seat in 1817. At Bridgwater the question was whether Lord Poulett should return one or two Members. Charles James Fox being interested in the borough, the Whigs usually put up a challenge, but manipulation of the rate book kept them at bay until 1806. In 1807 Poulett turned out his brother, who was in opposition, in favour of his brother-in-law. In 1818, the Whigs having become inactive, two radicals took up the challenge. At Lewes, where a combination of the Pelham family with an independent interest led by Kemp withstood all comers, the arrangement was upset in 1802 when Kemp was beaten, and superseded in 1806 when the Pelhams gave up altogether: subsequently Whig candidates fought in vain. At Windsor a heady juxtaposition of courtierdom and ‘insatiable rapacity’ prevented any firm arrangement until 1806, when a compromise between town and Castle was reached.\n\nAbingdon, Fowey, Milborne Port, Penryn, St. Ives and Wootton Bassett were each of them the scene of four contests.
