        "meta_description": "This chapter analyzes a series of legal events involving Britain's internal outsiders that unfolded in 1753: the sensational disappearance and reappearance of Elizabeth Canning. It describes the passage and repeal of the Jewish Naturalization Act which would have allowed Parliament to naturalize individual Jewish men if they secured the passage of a private Act of Parliament. The chapter also describes the execution of Archibald Cameron, a Scottish Jacobite who helped to plan the aborted Elibank Plot. The legal proceedings in the chapter includes: two criminal cases, involving Elizabeth Canning and Mary Squires, a Gypsy, an Act of Parliament, and a Jacobite plan for a failed rebellion. Each involved at least one person or a group defined as other: women, Gypsies, Jews, and Scottish Jacobites. The ideology of the rule of law offered a way to organize the hostility to difference within a framework of accommodation built into an imperial enterprise.",
