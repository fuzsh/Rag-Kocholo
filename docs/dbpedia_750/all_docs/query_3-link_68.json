        "text": "A biographical sketch of Murray Barker, a free black man who is one of the earliest homeowners in what is now Glover Park, and his descendants.\n\nThe First Settler of Glover Park\n\nOne of the home buyers in the village of Wilberforce (east of Wisconsin Avenue, from Whitehaven Parkway up to about W Place) was the earliest settler in this neighborhood. (It is possible to know who the first homeowner was because a historian was on the scene, whose business it was to know when someone bought a house: Georgetown’s assessor of property taxes. Georgetown was a separate municipality at the time, and Wilberforce fell within its boundaries. Dates given for tax assessments are all we have, but they are authoritative, and can be assumed to reflect the sequence of settlement.) Although lots in Wilberforce started to sell in 1806, it was not until 1810 that someone was assessed for a two-story frame house on one of them. The taxpayer was a man named Murray Barker, and as we will see, he arrived here by a somewhat different route than the people who later settled in next door to him.\n\nHow Murray Barker made his living at that time is not known, but there is a clue: apprenticeship records of the District of Columbia tell that on May 17, 1814, a child named Jacob, about 8 years old, was apprenticed to Barker to learn the trade of shoemaker (Apprenticeship No.538, vol. II, 91). The fact that Thomas Hyde’s tannery was next-door to Barker, would certainly make more sense if it turned out that Barker was in an allied trade.\n\nHowever, the next time the record shows that Barker took on an apprentice was not until 1848, and this time it was to teach William Burke the trade of huckster (Apprenticeship No.2046, vol. VI, 7).\n\nThe 1850 census describes Barker as a gardener. Generations of shoppers who want wholesale prices without getting up for them have given the huckster a bad name that it did not have at the time, and both terms require explanation, because their meaning has changed over the years. A gardener was someone who had a market- or truck-garden, in which he grew produce to sell. A huckster bought produce in the morning, and resold it during the day; he could have a shop, or a wagon, or both, but to do either he had to have a license, and a regular stand in the market. Buying from a huckster was more convenient than going to market early in the morning, but prices were correspondingly higher.\n\nThe connection mentioned earlier between Murray Barker and Thomas Hyde is, if anything, confirmed by a financial transaction in which Thomas Hyde becomes security for Murray Barker, for payment of $262, with interest, to Samuel B. Magruder. The three year loan is secured by Barker’s property, which Hyde may auction off to satisfy his debt. (DC Liber AD29, June 1812, f. 129/99)\n\nBarker needed money to buy slaves. This might seem a bit extravagant for a man of modest means, but it would not have been in any way unusual; slavery was utterly routine in the District of Columbia. But the case of Murray Barker was in fact different: the first settler in our neighborhood had only recently been a slave himself, and the slaves he was now planning to buy were his own wife and children.\n\nMurray Barker’s Freedom: The Methodist Connection\n\nFrederick County records of the late eighteenth century show that local authorities routinely received reports of “tumultuous meetings” said to be taking place in the slave quarters at night. Frequently the cause for of these disturbances was the joyful response called forth by Methodist preaching. Methodism was gaining converts all over Maryland, among both black and white. While John Wesley intended Methodism primarily as a reform of the Anglican church, to slaves his teaching appeared as a gospel of freedom: slavery was wrong. This was as well-known to masters as it was to slaves, so when a slave owner advertised that his runaway had “taken up with the Methodist Society,” everyone knew why (Columbian Chronicle, May 12, 1795). A generation later this was still the understanding of many people: “$100 reward for runaway negro man, Jack Butler, about 21: pretends to be a Methodist.” (Intelligencer, March 6, 1820).\n\nThe slave-owning class of society naturally found little to admire in this, but sometimes even a slave owner was persuaded by Methodist preaching, and went on to prove the sincerity of his conversion by setting his slaves free. These were the circumstances in 1809, when a man named Murray Barker made his first appearance in District of Columbia records: Leonard Mackall of Georgetown manumits “a negro man Murry, or Murry Baker, about thirty years of age.” (It seems that Baker became Barker to mark his new station in life.)\n\nMurray Barker’s owner freed him without explanation, but we can be pretty sure of the reason. Leonard Mackall was a convert to Methodism, and rose to be one of the leading Methodists in the District of Columbia. His high position in the church obligated him to free his slaves. In short, Murray Barker got his freedom because the man who owned him got religion.\n\nBarker was free, but his wife and children were still slaves. Barker mortgaged his small property on Wisconsin Avenue to his neighbor Thomas Hyde (who owned the tannery where the Safeway is now) and bought his wife and three children in 1812. Owning his family removed the immediate danger of their being sold and separated, but the dates of the deeds make clear that he was not permitted to liberate them immediately. Five years (to the day!) after buying them, Barker recorded his family’s manumission. His wife was free, as were the children born to her thereafter. But, slaves who were too young to support themselves could not immediately be freed, so Barker’s children became slaves for a term; his daughters would only get their freedom when they were sixteen, and his son, when he was twenty-one. In short, everything about becoming free was intended to be long and difficult, and the law, even when all of its requirements had been met, still had a parting shot: it made Murray Barker a slave master for two decades, with his children taxable as his property.\n\nMaryland laws in regard to slavery, in force in the District of Columbia at the time of its cession to the Federal government by Maryland, continued in force by an act of Congress in 1801. Additional laws on slavery and free blacks were then made by the District. These laws limited manumission to able-bodied adults in order to prevent children and old people from becoming “public charges.” (“The Slavery Code of the District of Columbia,” Washington, L. Towers & Co., Printers, 1862; Klebaner, Benjamin Joseph. “American Manumission Laws and the Responsibility for Supporting Slaves” The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, vol. 63, no. 4, 1955, pp. 443–453)\n\nWhatever it took, Barker did. That he succeeded in pulling his family out of slavery is a testament to individual determination. Not that he was alone; though records are lacking, we can reasonably assume that Barker had the encouragement and support of fellow black Methodists, both slave and free. There were also white Methodists on Barker’s side, besides the one who freed him; William Hardy, his Methodist class leader, held one of his mortgages. (Barker was listed in Hardy’s class, April 15, 1822. Unfortunately, Mount Zion Church records are not complete, and we can only infer Barker’s earlier membership.)\n\nFinally, an intriguing document survives to suggest that a prominent man involved himself in the case. It turns out that when Barker bought his children in 1812, he had been unable to buy them all; in 1813 four-year-old Mary Baker was bought instead by a prominent Methodist named Tiffin, who was Commissioner of the General Land Office. Edward Tiffin (1766-1829) was the former governor of Ohio, where his policy had favored the freeing of slaves. In the present case Tiffin was almost certainly acting on Barker’s behalf, so Mary was reunited with her family.\n\nMurray Barker’s Later Years\n\nBefore the Civil War, there used to be an annual Mayday procession of black drivers through Georgetown, their horses and wagons decorated with papers, ribbons, and flowers. It is a safe bet that the first homeowner in Glover Park was in the parade; according to an inventory of his assets, collateral for a loan, Murray Barker owned a market wagon with springs, and a bay horse to pull it.\n\nOther items of value were three pewter and two Delftware plates, a coffee mill, a mowing scythe, and a hog. Humble possessions, but the Georgetown Ordinances show that Barker did not think of himself as being powerless. On at least one occasion he petitioned the Georgetown City Council for redress, arguing that he had been fined unjustly in regard to some market regulation. Another time he protested “the shutting up of Wilberforce Street,” which meant Georgetown was no longer maintaining it as a public thoroughfare. Barker’s record in fighting City Hall was one and one; the Council resolved the first petition in Barker’s favor, but he got no satisfaction on the street-closing.\n\nMurray Barker, and all who knew him, are now long gone, and the scant records of his life and death require a considerable amount of inference to fill in the blanks. Barker would have been something over seventy years old when his name didn’t appear in the 1860 directory. Sophia Barker was still listed in 1863, and so would have witnessed the end of slavery in the District before she too passed on. It’s a good guess that they lie buried in Georgetown’s “Methodist ground”, near 27th and Q Streets, for which only partial records exist. Any marker has long disappeared.\n\nIn 1867 a small gathering took place to transact the sale of Murray Barker’s land on High Street. The sellers were the Barker children, and the buyer was Thomas Weaver. Born next door to the Barkers on Wilberforce Street, Weaver had probably known them all his life, but nothing in the deed reveals the human circumstances. All we know is, the Weavers were consolidating parcels of land along Wisconsin Avenue, and the Barkers were ending five decades on Georgetown Heights.\n\nWhat happened to the Barker children? Murray Barker, Jr. lived and died in Georgetown. Sophia Barker married a named West, and moved with him to Pennsylvania, his home state. Basil Barker also went to Pennsylvania, and settled on the outskirts of Pittsburgh, where, like his father, he grew produce for the market.\n\nA few grandchildren can be followed into the 20th century before we lose sight of them. Only one, who raised a family in Foggy Bottom, can be traced into the 1940s with any certainty, but there is no reason to doubt that he was descended from the slave freed in 1809, as he too was named Murray Barker.\n\nNotes and Sources\n\nDocumentation on Leonard Mackall, Murray Barker’s owner; Murray Barker; two (possible) brothers of Murray Barker; nine children of Murray and Sophia Barker; and Murray Barker’s descendants.\n\nLeonard Mackall\n\nLeonard Mackall (1768-1843), was born at Mattaponi, Prince Georges County, and married Catherine Beall in 1789. In 1795 Catherine Beall’s father Brook Beall granted 200 acres in Montgomery County, part of Friendship, and of Magruder’s Purchase, to Leonard Mackall –– Springfield farm, off River Road, where Springfield Drive is today. (Book F, f.209, Montgomery County Land Office)\n\nIn the 1800 census, Leonard Mackall is listed as having 11 slaves at Springfield. One of them is probably Murray Barker, probably born in Prince Georges County, a slave of either Leonard Mackall or Catherine Beall. When Barker reached adulthood, he met and courted Sophia, a slave on a neighboring farm.\n\nSome time after 1800 Mackall became a resident of the District of Columbia, and the following transaction is recorded there: “Leonard Mackall of Georgetown manumits negro man Murry, (or Murray Baker) about 30 years of age.” (DC Liber X23 ff.173-4/129, recorded 13/14 November, 1809)\n\n(In the light of Barker’s 1808 assessment for property, it is possible that the 1809 document reflects a final step in his manumission. The manumission suggests Barker was born in 1779; the census of 1850, which points to 1785, seems a safer bet. The name Baker occurs frequently in the Barker family’s freedom papers. The purpose of the change may have been to signal changed status.)\n\nLeonard Mackall House, at 1686 34th Street NW DC (HABS DC-835) erected in 1818 or 1819. (Richard Parrott, ux Jane To Leonard Mackall, DC Liber I (1815) f.404)\n\nLeonard Mackall, Treasurer of the Georgetown Potomac Bridge Company, builders of Chain Bridge. “Gtn. Potomac Bridge Co., dividend declared. -L. Mackall, treas, Gtn.” (Intelligencer, Jan 11, 1819)\n\nCapt. Leonard Mackall. (Intelligencer, Mar 15, 1820)\n\nLeonard Mackall, in 2nd Auditor Dept., Treasury (1834 Directory )\n\nSome other slave documents:\n\nAbraham Shorter is manumitted by Leonard Mackall, in consideration of the past faithful “sirveses” of his slave, aged about 35. (DC Liber AT44 (1818-9) ff.424/254 )\n\n$100 reward for a runaway negro man Jerry, age about 21 years; went off with a negro man belonging to Capt. Leonard Mackall, of this town, called Phill. -Jere. W. Bronough, Gtn. (Intelligencer, Mar 15, 1820)\n\nLeonard Mackall’s Dinah, May 30, 1826. (William King Mortality Journal)\n\nMethodism and Slavery\n\nBy the first decade of the 19th century Methodism had gained converts all over Maryland, among both the black and the white populations. While John Wesley intended Methodism primarily as a reform of the Anglican church, to slaves his teaching –– that slavery was wrong –– was a gospel of freedom.\n\nSlaveholders regarded Methodism as dangerous. When it was advertised that a runaway slave had “taken up with the Methodist Society,” everyone knew why. A generation later this was still understood: “$100 reward for runaway negro man, Jack Butler, about 21: pretends to be a Methodist.” (Columbian Chronicle, May 12, 1795; Intelligencer, March 6, 1820)\n\nBut occasionally even slaveholders found themselves persuaded by Methodist preaching. If a slave-owning convert had any expectation of achieving any standing in his new church he was expected to prove the sincerity of his conversion by divesting himself of human property –– either by direct manumission, or by selling for a term after which the slave would be free –– and of doing so in a way that assured that the manumitted slave could earn a living.\n\nThis is therefore the likeliest reason that Leonard Mackall –– convert circa 1804, steward, founding trustee, class leader, and a leading Methodist of the District of Columbia –– freed as many as eight other slaves by deeds of manumission in DC including Sciss, Luke Bowen, Sillar (Priscilla), Polly and Toby, Tom (alias Thomas Barker), a male named Delaware, and Abraham Shorter.\n\n(This history is indebted Jane B. Donovan, Lecturer in Religious Studies at West Virginia University, for numerous clarifications regarding early Methodism.

Donovan, Henry Foxall: Methodist, Industrialist, American, New Room Books, 2017)\n\nDeeds of manumission:\n\nDC Liber L 11 1804 ff.280/258\n\nDC Liber Q16 1806 ff.236/310\n\nDC Liber R17 1807 ff.104/134\n\nDC Liber S18 1807 ff.170/138,39\n\nDC Liber V21-2? f.253, 10/15 February, 1809\n\nDC Liber AC 1812 ff.486/345\n\nDC Liber AT44 ff.424/254, 1818-9\n\nMackall’s name is also on several Freedom Certificates, which the law required freed slaves to carry.\n\nA certificate of 1827 says Ben Wren has purchased his freedom from Margaret Beall, and refers to DC Liber AY49 1820 f.55.\n\nIn an 1831 certificate, Mackall affirms his knowledge of the freedom of Joseph Neverson (one of the founders of Mt. Zion Church).\n\n(In the 1840 census Mackall still had two young female slaves in his house who were probably too young to legally manumit.)\n\nMurray Barker Buys his Family\n\nMurray Barker’s campaign to free his wife and children left a paper trail. There is, however, a limit to what these documents can tell us. Deeds are generally silent in regard to the motives of the parties involved.\n\nIt seems safe to assume that few whites who had transactions with Murray Barker share Leonard Mackall’s qualms about slavery. Still, for a white man to extend credit to a newly-freed slave, whose clear intention was to free other slaves, suggests something like collusion with Barker’s mission. And, in the case of Edward Tiffin (see below), it seems that Barker had a white ally when he most needed one.\n\nThe following are the transactions by which Barker financed the purchase of his wife and three children:\n\nDC Liber AD29, June 1812, f. 129/99:\n\nIn 1812 Thomas Hyde secures payment by Murray Barker of $262, with interest, to Samuel Magruder of Montgomery County. The three-year loan is secured by Barker’s property on High Street, bought of Stephen Bloomer Balch, which Hyde may auction off to satisfy his debt. Surplus from the auction would go to Barker.\n\nDC Liber AD29 1812 ff.189/153:\n\nfor $30, Stephen Bloomer Balch of Washington County to Murray Barker of the same place, part of lot 253, near Wilberforce Street and Congo Lane, in Beatty and Hawkins’ Addition to Georgetown.\n\nDC Liber AH33 1814/1815 ff. 440/377:\n\nSamuel B. Magruder to Murray Barker.\n\nBill of sale, 15 Feb 1815, Recorded Mar 9, 1815\n\nSamuel Brewer Magruder of Montgomery Co., in consideration of $60 paid to him by Murray Barker, a colored man and father of Eliza, sells to Barker a girl slave named Eliza, who is about a year old, “in consideration of the natural affection I bear to my child Eliza, she being also my own proper slave”\n\nDC Liber AO39 ff.89/71\n\nrecorded June 9, 1817\n\nBarker releases from slavery “my beloved wife Sophia, whom I bought of George B. Magruder” [Samuel B. Magruder?] and “dear children Eliza, Murray and Doley.”\n\nSamuel B. Magruder and BF Mackall witness that Samuel B. Magruder sold Sophia to Murray Barker, June, 9, 1812. They swear this June 5, 1817.\n\nSophia, age 30;\n\nEliza, age 7 to be free at 16;\n\nMurray, age 3, to be free at 21\n\nDoley, age 7 mos., to be free at 16\n\nSophia Barker was born circa 1786-1787, in Georgetown. Why Eliza appears in two transactions is unclear. Thomas Hyde was the owner of the tannery south of Barker’s property (where the Georgetown Safeway is now). Rev. Balch was the Presbyterian pastor of Georgetown. Samuel Magruder of Montgomery County, and George B. Magruder owned Stoneyhurst farm, and were neighbors when Leonard Mackall lived at Springfield, on River Road.\n\nFor Murray Barker, owning his family removed them from the ever-present danger of their being sold and separated. The dates of the deeds make it clear that he was not permitted to liberate them for five years.\n\nFive years to the day after buying them, Barker recorded his family’s manumission. His wife was free, as were the children born to her thereafter. But Eliza, Murray Jr., and Doley became slaves for a term; his daughters would only get their freedom when they were sixteen, and his son, when he was twenty-one.\n\nDid Barker own his children as slaves?\n\nThe census taker didn’t think so.\n\nThe census of 1820 shows his household, two adults and three minors, as free. The 1830 census shows Murray and Sophia and four girls and two boys, all free. The 1840 census shows the household diminished by one –– Murray Jr.? –– and all are free (and literate!)\n\nOn the other hand, the law did:\n\nBill of sale 15 Feb 1815, Recorded Mar 9, 1815:\n\nSamuel Brewer Magruder of Montgomery Co., in consideration of $60 paid to him by Murray Barker, a colored man and father of Eliza, sells to Barker a girl slave named Eliza, who is about a year old. She will be her father’s slave until she comes of age that he can free her: “in consideration of the natural affection I bear to my child Eliza, she being also my own proper slave”.\n\n(DC Liber AH33, 1814/1815 ff.440/377)\n\nThe Methodist Connection\n\nBarker undoubtedly enjoyed the support of black Methodists. There were also white Methodists on Barker’s side, besides the one who freed him. William Hardy, his Methodist class leader (April 15, 1822, re Carter Bowman) sold him land:\n\nWB111 1844 ff.437/336.\n\nAside from Leonard Mackall –– the man who freed him because he got religion –– Murray Barker had another white Methodist on his side. It turns out that when Barker bought his children in 1812, he had been unable to buy them all. In 1813 four-year-old Mary Baker was bought instead by a man named Edward Tiffin:\n\nCertificate of Freedom 963, vol. 2, p.184\n\nrecorded October 7, 1831:\n\nFrederick Keller swears that Mary Baker, is the (person bought?) from Thomas Watkins, mentioned in a manumission deed from Murry Baker, and is the same person who was sold by Thomas Watkins in 1813 to the late Edward Tiffin of Ohio, who was then a resident of Washington. Baker is a bright mulatto woman and is 24 years and 11 months old.\n\nThere is no deed of sale in DC index, for either Watkins or Tiffin,\n\nso the sale was most likely in Montgomery County. Tiffin, a Methodist lay preacher, had been the governor of Ohio, an Ohio Senator, and was now Commissioner of the General Land Office; that he was acting on behalf of the child’s father is apparent from the outcome, and from the fact that Tiffin’s anti-slavery sentiments are well-documented.\n\nMurray Barker and the Village of Wilberforce\n\nThere is substantial evidence that Rev. Stephen Bloomer Balch –– who sold Murray Barker land on what is now Wisconsin Avenue –– had “views” about slavery, but what they were remains obscure. Balch was one of the founders of the American Colonization Society, which advocated re-settlement of freed slaves in Liberia. He also named a farm he owned in honor of William Wilberforce, the English abolitionist.\n\nThis farm –– on the east side of High Street (now Wisconsin Avenue), and north of Madison Street (now Whitehaven Parkway) –– he later subdivided into small lots, which were offered for sale in what he called the Village of Wilberforce. The names of its streets –– Congo Lane, Angola Lane ––refer to two of the leading sources of African slaves in America.\n\nThere were at least four free African-American buyers in and near Wilberforce: William Fealds (or Fields), Moses Thompson, John Swann, and Murray Barker, and all seem to have some connection to Mt. Zion Methodist Church.\n\nNeither the name Wilberforce, nor its streets, were adopted by the city of Georgetown, but they did fall within the boundaries of Georgetown, so it was Georgetown’s assessor of property taxes who recorded the name of the first homeowner in Wilberforce. Lots in Wilberforce started to sell in 1806: Murray Barker was assessed for lot 253 in 1808, and in 1810 Barker was assessed for a house on that lot.\n\nMurray Barker assessed for lot 253\n\n(Washington Federalist, November 8, 1808)\n\nGeorgetown Assessments, 1808 note, p.50:\n\nas of Sept. 1810 Murray Barker was assessed for a house on part of lot 253,\n\nBeatty & Hawkins Addition to Georgetown, fronting on High Street, taxed at $80.\n\nMurray Barker pays off his loan:\n\nDC Liber AD29 1812 ff.189/153:\n\nfor $30, Stephen Bloomer Balch of Washington County to Murray Barker of the same place, part of lot 253, near Wilberforce Street and Congo Lane, in Beatty and Hawkins’ Addition to Georgetown.\n\nTrades and Transactions\n\nApprenticeship records of the District of Columbia show that on May 17, 1814, a child named Jacob, Patrick Magruder’s slave, about 8 years old, was apprenticed to Barker to learn the shoemaking trade. That obligation would have ended in 1824.\n\n(In light of the frequency of the surname Magruder in connection with Murray Barker, it is possible that Jacob was related to Murray Barker.)\n\n(DC Indentures of Apprenticeship No. 538, Vol. II, p. 91, May 17, 1814)\n\nMurray Barker made his living as a shoemaker, and it is a reasonable conjecture that Barker had once been apprenticed in similar fashion; that is how trades were learned.\n\nAfter Barker was freed he moved in next door to a source of leather. As early as 1797, Thomas Hyde owned a “tanyard just above Georgetown on the road to Montgomery Court House.” Georgetown tax rolls show that it was situated about where the Georgetown Safeway is today. Hyde’s tannery was the earliest industry on Georgetown Heights.\n\nDC Liber WB2 (1821) ff.397/283:\n\nBarker borrowed $190, taking out a mortgage on his house from Clement Smith\n\nPaid back:\n\nDC Liber WB27 (1829) ff.105/150\n\nDC Liber WB5 1822-1823 ff.195-168:\n\nFor $100 from his neighbor William Kuhns, Barker sells, or uses as security for a loan, 2 beds, a stove, furniture, pots, wash tubs, 3 pewter and 2 Delftware plates, a coffee mill, a mowing scythe, and a hog.\n\nMurray Barker appears in records on April 15, 1822, as a member of William Hardy’s class, Montgomery Street Methodist Church. (Source: Carter Bowman, Mt. Zion Church)\n\nAt some point, Barker changed professions, and became a truck gardener, growing produce for the market, and a huckster, an independent produce retailer, selling from a wagon. The reason for this change is unknown; perhaps to avoid being in competition with white shoemakers, or to achieve greater independence.\n\nThe word huckster was not originally an insult. A huckster was a valuable person, you could get produce from him after the market stalls had closed, but he charged a higher price. Thrifty well-regulated houses got their produce in the morning at the market.\n\nWhen Barker petitioned the Georgetown City Council for redress, arguing that he had been fined unjustly in regard to some market regulation, he may have already changed his calling. The petition was resolved in Barker’s favor. (Georgetown Ordinances, Board of Common Council, November 18, 1836)\n\nBarker also protested “the shutting up of Wilberforce Street,” which meant either that Georgetown had condemned it, or that it was not maintaining it. Barker got no satisfaction on the street-closing. (Georgetown Ordinances, Board of Aldermen, October 27, 1837)\n\nWhat this “shutting up” meant is unclear. It is possible that the action was a legal one, removing Wilberforce Street as a public thoroughfare; or it could have been physical, with something like the annual grading of High Street making it impossible to turn onto the older street.\n\nDC Liber WB111 1844 ff.437/336:\n\nMurray Barker’s class leader, William Hardy, Montgomery Street Methodist Church, sells Barker adjoining land in Beatty and Hawkins Addition to Georgetown, lot 252, to the south of Barker’s original lot.\n\nWB129 (1846) ff.258/298:\n\nBarker takes loan of $100 for 6 months, from William Howell of Washington City, with his market wagon with springs, a cart harness, and a bay horse as collateral. He signs his name.\n\nApprenticeship No. 2046, vol. VI, 7, February 8, 1848\n\nWilliam Burke, the mulatto son of Sarah Burke, who was born July 12, 1835, is apprenticed until age 21 to Murray Barker, to learn the trade of huckster.\n\nIn the 1850 census, p. 178A, this same William Burke, age 15, is in the house of Murray Barker, Jr., and is described as “bought on time”, meaning he was a slave at the time, and to be free when his apprenticeship ended in 1856?\n\nMurray Barker is described as a gardener\n\nApprenticeship No.2183, recorded April 3, 1852:\n\nNin Bell [Ninian Beall?] An orphan who was 11 years old on March 2, 1852, with the consent of his sister Cesilla J. Green, is apprenticed until the age of 21 to Murray Barker of Georgetown, to learn the art of a house servant. He may be a relative, as he was already in the house in the 1850 census, p. 237 A.\n\nThe 1858 directory of Georgetown gives Barkers address as 356 High Street, and lists his trade as “huckster”.\n\nGenerations of shoppers who want morning prices without getting up for them have given the huckster a bad name that it did not have at the time, and both terms require explanation, because their meaning has changed over the years. A gardener was someone who had a market- or truck-garden, in which he grew produce to sell. A huckster bought produce in the morning, and resold it during the day; he could have a shop, or a wagon, or both, but to do either he had to have a license, and a regular stand in the market. Buying from a huckster was more convenient than going to market early in the morning, but prices were correspondingly higher.\n\nBefore the Civil War, there used to be an annual Mayday procession through Georgetown of black drivers, with horses and wagons decorated with papers, ribbons, and flowers. Quite possibly the first homeowner in Glover Park was in the parade. (William A. Gordon, CHS vol. 20, 1917)\n\nBarker’s name didn’t appear in the 1860 directory of Georgetown residents. Sophia Barker was still listed in 1863, and so would have witnessed the end of slavery in the District before she too passed on.\n\nIt is recorded that Murray’s son Murray Barker, Jr., who probably died before his father died, was buried in Georgetown’s “Methodist ground” –– now Mt. Zion Cemetery –– it is possible that his father was buried there as well. But Murray and Sophia Barker are not listed by Sluby or by Birch. Also, only partial records exist for this burial ground. If there was a marker it has long disappeared.\n\nIn 1867 a small gathering took place to transact the sale of Murray Barker’s land on High Street. The sellers were Barker’s son Basil, and daughters Catherine Barker, Sophia (Barker) West, and Sarah (Barker) Bias Toler.\n\nThe buyer was Thomas Weaver. Born next door to the Barkers on Wilberforce Street, Weaver had probably known the Barkers all his life, but nothing in the deed reveals the human circumstances. All we know is, the Weavers were consolidating parcels of land along Wisconsin Avenue, and the Barkers were ending five decades on Georgetown Heights.\n\nDC Liber ECE28 1868 ff.90/95\n\nindenture made December 14 1867, recorded February 8. 1868\n\nBarker, Basil & Catherine, to Thomas Weaver\n\nWhat happened to the children of Murray and Sophia?\n\nMurray Barker, Jr. died in his house in Georgetown.\n\nHis sister Sophia married a man named West, and moved with him to Pennsylvania. Basil Barker also went to Pennsylvania, settling on the outskirts of Pittsburgh; like his father, Basil sold produce from a wagon.\n\nA few grandchildren can be followed into the 20th century before we lose sight of them. One, who raised a family in Foggy Bottom, can be traced into the 1940s: he too was named Murray Barker.\n\nAdditional Notes on Murray Barker’s Family\n\nNotes, and documentation of sources, on two (possible) brothers of Murray Barker; notes and documentation of Murray and Sophia Barker’s nine children, and of their descendants.

The following is an attempt to follow what happened to this family after Murray and Sophia died.\n\n1\n\nMary Baker, child of Murray and Sophia Barker\n\nborn November, 1808?\n\nManumitted 1816\n\nCertificate of Freedom #963, vol. 2, p.184\n\nrecorded Oct 7, 1831:\n\nFrederick Keller swears that Mary Baker, is the [person bought?] from Thomas Watkins mentioned in a manumission deed from Murry Baker, and is the same person who was sold by Thomas Watkins in 1813 to the late Edward Tiffin of Ohio, who was then a resident of Washington. Baker is a bright mulatto woman and is 24 years and 11 months old.\n\nIn many cases the first legal mention of a Barker gives the name as Baker.\n\nThis was also the case with Mary’s father, Murray Barker:\n\nDC Liber X23 173-4/129 recorded, 13/14 Nov., 1809\n\n“Leonard Mackall of Georgetown manumits negro man Murry, (or Murray Baker) about 30 years of age.”\n\nThe name Baker rather than Barker occurs frequently in this family’s freedom papers,\n\nperhaps suggestive of a desire for the free Bakers to signal changed status?\n\nThere is no deed of sale in DC index, for either Watkins or Tiffin,\n\nso the sale was most likely in Montgomery Co.\n\nEdward Tiffin apparently bought the child on behalf of the child’s father. Who was Tiffin?\n\nBorn 1766 in England\n\nfirst state governor of Ohio\n\nopposed slavery in the new state,\n\nencouraged manumitted slaves to settle in Chilicothe\n\nApril 1812, General Land Office created, President Madison selected Tiffin to head it\n\nTiffin was in DC in 1814 during British attack. (Sprague, Ohio Cues for Ohio Youth, vol. 13 No 4, Jan 1964, pp. 207-9)\n\nTiffin freed slaves that he inherited.\n\nHe and his brother-in-law manumitted all of them:\n\nDC Liber AO39 1813 f.134\n\nEdward Tiffin certifies that Negro woman Sukey and her daughter were born slaves to me in the state of Virginia, and I have emancipated them, and they are at liberty.\n\ngiven Sept. 1813, recorded 1817\n\n2\n\nEliza Barker Jackson, child of Murray and Sophia Barker\n\nborn circa Feb 1814?\n\nDC Liber AH33, 1814/1815 ff.440/377\n\nBill of sale 15 Feb 1815, Recorded Mar 9, 1815\n\nSamuel Brewer Magruder of Montgomery Co., in consideration of $60 paid to him by Murray Barker, a colored man and father of Eliza, sells to Barker a girl slave named Eliza, who is about a year old. Legally, she will be her father’s slave until she comes of age that he can free her: “in consideration of the natural affection I bear to my child Eliza, she being also my own proper slave.”\n\nEliza married John Jackson,\n\nFreedom Register, Manumission Records II, # 894,\n\nNational Archives, Record Group 21\n\nrecorded 30 July, 1831:\n\nBarker records having manumitted daughter Eliza, now Jackson,\n\n(and Eliza’s daughter, Julia Jackson, about 4 or 5 years old)\n\nhaving purchased her from Samuel B.

(River Shad is another fish that he may have dealt in.)\n\nThe profession sounds humble, but there is evidence that Murray Jr. made a good living. It also appears that Barker would have had a stand in the market, and or sold from a wagon, as a huckster:\n\nApprenticeship #2046, Feb 8, 1848\n\nWilliam Burke, the mulatto son of Sarah Burke, who was born 12 July, 1835,\n\nis apprenticed until age 21 to Murray Barker to learn the trade of huckster\n\n1850 census, p. 178A, shows this same William Burke, age 15, born Va.,\n\nin the household of Murray Barker, Jr., and is described as “bought on time”,\n\npresumably meaning he was a slave at the time, and to be free when his apprenticeship ended in 1856?\n\nDC Wills: Murray Barker Jr. feeling his time was short, made his will in 1857, and died that year.\n\nHis heirs included two sisters:\n\nSarah Buyers (Byers) of Georgetown.\n\nSophia West of Beltsville\n\n(which probably means Beallsville, PA)\n\n“In Georgetown, on the 22nd instant, Murray Barker, aged forty years, who died in peace.” (Evening Star, March 23, 1857, p.3)\n\nMurray, Jr. died March 22, 1857, and was buried March 24, 1857, in “Methodist Episcopal Ground,” by Joseph Birch.\n\nBarker’s broken, but still handsome stone at Mt.
