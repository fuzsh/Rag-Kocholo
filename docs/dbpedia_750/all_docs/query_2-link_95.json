        "text": "Taylor Name Meaning\n\nThe Taylor surname is an occupational name for a tailor, derived from the Anglo-Norman French Middle English term taillour, which means ‘tailor’. This term is rooted in the Old French words tailleor or tailleur and the Late Latin term taliator, which means ‘to cut’.\n\nTaylor Last Name Variations\n\nVirtually all surnames have developed phonetic and spelling variations over many centuries in many countries. A person’s last name was often spelled however it sounded to the person recording it.\n\nWhen you’re researching your branch of the Taylor family tree, you may find that your ancestors used one or more of these variations of the Taylor surname: Talar, Tailor, Tallur, Telore, Talhar, Teylor, Tylor, Thelor, Tallar, Talor, Tailar, Talur, Talare, Telor, Talyor.\n\nHere are some equivalents of the Taylor surname in different languages, based on the translation of the word “tailor:”\n\nFrench: Tailleur\n\nItalian: Sarto\n\nSpanish: Sastre\n\nGerman: Schneider\n\nDutch: Snijder\n\nPortuguese: Alfaiate\n\nPolish: Krawiec\n\nRussian: Портной (Portnoy)\n\nSwedish: Skräddare\n\nHungarian: Szabó\n\nArab: Khayat\n\nTaylor Last Name Origin\n\nThe earliest origins of the last name Taylor can be found in England, Scotland, and Ireland. The name was traditionally given to individuals who worked as tailors, crafting and mending garments.\n\nTaylor Surname in England\n\nIn England, the earliest known Taylor is believed to be Adam de Tailour, who was recorded in Nottinghamshire in 1282. John Taylor, born in Homestall, Shadochurst, Kent, England, in 1327, was another early bearer of the name.\n\nBy the 19th century, the majority of Taylors were located in Lancashire and Yorkshire. Castles, estates, and manors held by Taylor families can still be found in England to this day.\n\nTaylor Surname in Scotland\n\nIn Scotland, Clan Tailyour, also known as Clan Taylor, is a recognized clan without a current chief, making it an armigerous clan. The surname Taylor is also a sept of the Clan Cameron of the Scottish Highlands.\n\nDuring the Wars of Scottish Independence, Bryce le Taillur was captured at Dunbar Castle in 1296. In the same year, six people with this last name appear on the Ragman Rolls, pledging allegiance to Edward I of England.\n\nIn the 18th century, the Taylors held a castle at Kirktonhill in Aberdeenshire thanks to their wealth from Jamaican sugar plantations. The castle was later replaced by Kirktonhill House, a mansion that was demolished in the 1960s.\n\nTaylor Surname in Ireland\n\nIn Ireland, the first recorded instance of the Taylor surname can be traced back to the Taylors of Swords, a small town in County Dublin. This family is believed to have established their roots in Ireland as early as the 1300s. The progenitor of the family is said to have arrived from Yorkshire, England, marking the beginning of the Taylor lineage in Ireland.\n\nIn the 1650s, Thomas Taylor arrived from Sussex to oversee the fiscal expenditures of Cromwell’s campaign in Ireland. His descendants later became baronets at Kells in Meath.\n\nTaylor Surname Geography\n\nThe Taylor surname currently ranks as the 345th most common last name in the world and can be found in more than 200 countries. It’s estimated that over 1.5 million people bear the last name Taylor.\n\nPredominantly, the name is found in the United States, where it is held by almost 900,000 people. The distribution within the country shows the most Taylors in Texas (10%), California (8%), and Florida (5%).\n\nThe Taylor surname is also prevalent in England, where about 19% of all Taylors live, and Australia, which is home to 6% of individuals with this last name.\n\nTaylor Marquessates\n\nA marquess or marchioness is a noble or honorific status that is either inherited or bestowed. It is a rank in the British peerage system, above an earl and below a duke. Historically, marquesses and marchionesses were responsible for the defense of vast border territories, which often made them powerful figures. They often hold multiple subsidiary titles, such as earl or viscount, which are used by their heirs apparent. When directly addressing a Marquess or a Marchioness, you would use “Lord” or “Lady” respectively, followed by their surname.\n\nThe title Marquess of Headfort in the Peerage of Ireland was created in 1800 for Thomas Taylor (1757-1829), an Irish peer and politician. Thomas held several subsidiary titles, including Earl of Bective and Viscount Headfort. From 1812 to 1829, he served as Lord of the Bedchamber, a courtier in the Royal Household of the Kingdom of England. He descended from Thomas Taylor, who came to Ireland during the 1650s from Sussex, England. The family seat, Headfort House, was located near Kells, County Meath, in Ireland.\n\nThe 1st Marquess was succeeded by his son, the 2nd Marquess, who changed the family surname to Taylour. As of 2023, the family titles are held by Thomas Michael Ronald Christopher Taylour (b. 1959), the 7th Marquess of Headfort.\n\nTaylor Baronies\n\nA baron or baroness is a noble or honorific status that is either inherited or bestowed. It refers to someone who is below a duke, marquess, earl, and viscount but above a lord and knight. “My Lord” or “Your Lordship” is used when directly addressing a baron. “My Lady” or “Your Ladyship” is used when directly addressing a baroness.\n\nHereditary baronies held by people with the last name Taylor include:\n\nBaron Grantchester, of Knightsbridge in the City of Westminster: Created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1953 for Alfred Suenson-Taylor (1893-1976), a banker and Liberal politician. The title is currently held by the 3rd Baron, Christopher John Suenson-Taylor (b. 1951), who is one of the 92 elected hereditary peers allowed to remain in the House of Lords. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, he has a net worth of £1.2 billion. The family seat is located near Audlem, Cheshire.\n\nBaron Maenan, of Ellesmere in the County of Shropshire: Created in 1948 for William Francis Kyffin Taylor (1854-1951), a prominent English barrister and judge. William held various legal and judicial positions, including Presiding Judge of the Court of Passage, between 1903 and 1948. He was made a peer at the age of 93, making him the oldest person ever to be made a peer. The title became extinct upon his death in 1951, as he had no male heir.\n\nTaylor Baronetcies\n\nA baronet is someone who has received a baronetcy, a hereditary title from the British Crown. They rank below barons but above knights, with the exception of the Knights of the Garter in England and The Order of the Thistle in Scotland. Baronets are addressed as “Sir (forename),” and their wives are addressed as “Lady (surname).”\n\nThere have been five baronetcies created for persons with the surname Taylor, one in the Baronetage of England, one in the Baronetage of Great Britain, and three in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. Only one creation is extant, or still in existence, as of 2011.\n\nTaylor Baronetcy, of Park House in the County of Kent: This baronetcy was created in 1665 for Thomas Taylor (1630-1665).\n\nTaylor Baronetcy, of Lysson Hall in the County of Surrey: This baronetcy was created in 1778 for Simon Richard Brissett Taylor (1783-1815), a wealthy sugar planter in Jamaica. Simon Taylor was known for his significant wealth, which he accumulated through his sugar plantations. He was also a Member of the Assembly in Jamaica, where he was a prominent figure. The title became extinct in 1815.\n\nTaylor Baronetcy, of Hollycombe in the County of Sussex: This baronetcy was created in 1828 for Charles William Taylor (1770-1857), who served for many years as Member of Parliament for Wells. The title became extinct in 1876.\n\nTaylor Baronetcy of Kennington in the County of London (later Stuart Taylor Baronetcy): This baronetcy was created in 1917 for the prominent physician Frederick Taylor (1847–1920), who was President of the Royal College of Physicians. He was succeeded by his son, who changed the family surname to Stuart Taylor. The title is currently held by his grandson, Sir Nicholas Richard Stuart Taylor (b. 1952).\n\nTaylor Baronetcy, of Cawthorne in the West Riding of the County of York: This baronetcy was created in 1963 for William Johnson Taylor (1902–1972), Member of Parliament for Bradford North. The title became extinct in 1972.\n\nTaylors That Shaped History\n\nGeorge Taylor: Founding Father of the United States\n\nGeorge Taylor (c. 1716-1781), a Pennsylvania politician, was one of the signers of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. Born in Ireland, Taylor immigrated to the American colonies where he worked in the iron industry before entering politics. Despite his humble beginnings, Taylor rose to become a member of the Continental Congress, contributing to the founding of the United States.
