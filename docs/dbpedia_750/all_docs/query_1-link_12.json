        "text": "Ronnie Barker's remarkable versatility as a performer can be traced back to his time in repertory theatre, where he was able to play a wide range of roles and develop his talent for accents, voices and verbal dexterity. It was during this time that he met Glenn Melvyn, who taught him how to stammer (something he would later use to great effect in the sitcom Open All Hours (1976)). Melvyn also gave Ronnie his break into television by offering him a role in I'm Not Bothered (1956). During the 1960s, Ronnie became well-established in radio, providing multiple voices for \"The Navy Lark\" and working with comedy great Jon Pertwee. He also became a regular face on television, appearing in The Frost Report (1966) (perhaps most memorably in a sketch about Britain's class system, with John Cleese and Ronnie Corbett) and playing character roles on Simon Templar (1962) and Mit Schirm, Charme und Melone (1961).\n\nIn 1971, Ronnie teamed up with Ronnie Corbett again, this time for a BBC sketch series called The Two Ronnies (1971). This series proved enormously popular, continuing until the late 1980s. In addition to \"The Two Ronnies\", Barker starred on the popular BBC sitcoms Porridge (1974) (as a cockney prisoner) and Open All Hours (1976) (as a stammering Northern shopkeeper). In fact, only Leonard Rossiter could be said to have rivaled him during this time for the crown of British television's most popular comedy star. In 1982, he revived silent comedy in By the Sea (1982). Despite his extrovert performances on television, Barker remained a quiet, retiring individual in his personal life, much preferring to spend time with his family rather than mix with the celebrity crowd. This humility, combined with memories of his extraordinary abilities, meant that he continued to be greatly respected by his fellow professionals. In a BAFTA special shown by the BBC in 2004, stars as diverse as Gene Wilder, Peter Kay and Peter Hall paid tribute to his contribution to comedy and British television in general. Ronnie Barker died on 3 October 2005 after suffering from heart problems.\n\nBorn in America, and raised in Ireland and England, actor Patrick McGoohan rose to become the number-one British TV star in the 1950s to 1960s era. His parents moved to Ireland when he was very young and McGoohan acquired a neutral accent that sounds at home in British or American dialogue. He was an avid stage actor and performed hundreds of times in small and large productions before landing his first TV and film roles. McGoohan is one of few actors who has successfully switched between theater, TV, and films many times during his career. He was often cast in the role of Angry Young Man. In 1959, he was named Best TV Actor of the Year in Britain. Shortly thereafter, he was chosen for the starring role in the Geheimauftrag f√ºr John Drake (1964) TV series (AKA 'Secret Agent in the US), which proved to be an immense success for three years and allowed the British to break into the burgeoning American TV market for the first time. By the series' 3rd year, McGoohan felt the series had run its course and was beginning to repeat itself. McGoohan and Lew Grade - the president of ITC (the series' production company), had agreed that McGoohan could leave Danger Man to begin work on a new series, and turned in his resignation right after the first episode of the fourth year had been filmed (\"Koroshi\"). McGoohan set up his own production company and collaborated with noted author and script editor George Markstein to sell a brand new concept to ITC's Lew Grade. McGoohan starred in, directed, produced, and wrote many of the episodes, sometimes taking a pseudonym to reduce the sheer number of credits to his name. Thus, the TV series Nummer 6 (1967) came to revolve around the efforts of a secret agent, who resigned early in his career, to clear his name. His aim was to escape from a fancifully beautiful but psychologically brutal prison for people who know too much. The series was as popular as it was surreal and allegorical, and its mysterious final episode caused such an uproar that McGoohan was to desert England for more than 20 years to seek relative anonymity in LA, where celebrities are \"a dime a dozen.\"\n\nDuring the 1970s, he appeared in four episodes of the TV detective series \"Columbo,\" for which he won an Emmy Award. His film roles lapsed from prominence until his powerful performance as King Edward I (Longshanks) in Mel Gibson's production of Braveheart (1995). As such, he has solidified his casting in the role of Angry Old Man.\n\nTimothy Leonard Spall is an award-winning classical character actor who was born on February 27, 1957, and raised in London. The son of blue-collar parents, Joseph L. Spall, a postal worker, and Sylvia R. (Leonard), a hairdresser, his interest in acting happened early and Spall auditioned and earned a spot with the National Youth Theatre.\n\nThe young actor showed great promise at RADA where he portrayed the title roles in \"Macbeth\" and \"Othello.\" In 1979 he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company and stayed for approximately two years performing in such plays as \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\" \"Cymbeline,\" \"The Three Sisters,\" \"Nicholas Nickleby\" and \"The Knight of the Burning Pestle.\" With other rep companies, he appeared in, among others, \"The Merchant\" and \"St. Joan.\"\n\nMaking his minor debut in a filmed version of the play The Life Story of Baal (1978), Tim went on to play featured roles in offbeat films such as Quadrophenia (1979), Remembrance (1982), Der Missionar (1982), Die Braut (1985), Body Contact (1987), Robinson Crusoe - Reise ins Abenteuer (1988), Der Priestermord (1988), Dream Demon - Traumd√§mon (1988) and 1871 (1990)\n\nIn the 1990's, Timothy surged forward largely through his association with prolific writer/director Mike Leigh, appearing in a number of his award-winning, working-class features. Those included his doomed chef Aubrey in Das Leben ist s√º√ü (1990); brother/uncle Maurice in L√ºgen und Geheimnisse (1996) (BAFTA Award nomination); the vulnerable performer Richard Temple in the Gilbert & Sullivan biopic Topsy-Turvy - Auf den Kopf gestellt (1999) (another BAFTA nomination); and the benign taxi driver Phil in All or Nothing (2002). He also worked for other noted directors including Ken Russell in Gothic (1986), Clint Eastwood in Wei√üer J√§ger, schwarzes Herz (1990), Bernardo Bertolucci in Himmel √ºber der W√ºste (1990), and Kenneth Branagh in Hamlet (1996) (as Rosenkrantz).\n\nTim impressed on the small screen as well during this time, accentuated by his starring work on series TV as the luckless Frank Stubbs Promotes (1993) as well as the comedies Nice Day at the Office (1994) and Outside Edge (1994), and his BAFTA-nominated TV roles in Our Mutual Friend (1998), Shooting the Past (1999) and Vacuuming Completely Nude in Paradise (2001).\n\nA battle with myeloid leukemia sharply curtailed Tim's momentum for a time, but he returned healthy into the millennium in superb lead and support form to create arguably his most hissable cinematic character. As the cowardly, half-blooded wizard Peter Pettigrew, Tim inhabited the role in several of the nine \"Harry Potter\" blockbusters from Harry Potter und der Gefangene von Askaban (2004) to Harry Potter und die Heiligt√ºmer des Todes - Teil 2 (2011). He also earned superb notices as: one of the charitable Cheeryble brothers in Nicholas Nickleby (2002); gullible banker Mr. Poe in the wild Jim Carrey adventure comedy Lemony Snicket - R√§tselhafte Ereignisse (2004); humorous Simon Graham in the Tom Cruise starrer Last Samurai (2003); evil queen henchman Nathaniel in the delightful Disney film Verw√ºnscht (2007); the villainous Beadle in the dark musical Sweeney Todd: Der teuflische Barbier aus der Fleet Street (2007); the over-anxious lawyer starring role in the family dramedy Reuniting the Rubins (2010); Sir Winston Churchill in The King's Speech - Die Rede des K√∂nigs (2010); werewolf hunter Sid in the horror comedy Love Bite - Nichts ist safer als Sex (2012); eccentric painter J.M.W. Turner portrait in Mike Leigh's Mr. Turner - Meister des Lichts (2014) (Cannes, London Critics Circle, New York Critics Circle and National Society of Film Critics winner); the co-lead with Juno Temple in the social drama Away (2016); legal combatant David Irving in the Holocaust-themed Verleugnung (2016); part of an upper-class couple (opposite Kristin Scott Thomas in the dark social comedy The Party (2017); a syndicated boss in The Corrupted - Ein blutiges Erbe (2019); and as artist L.S. Lowry opposite Vanessa Redgrave playing his mother in the biopic Mrs Lowry & Son (2019).\n\nTim's more recent notable TV outings have included his Fagin in the mini-series version of the Dickens classic Oliver Twist (2007), the title role in the TV-movie The Fattest Man in Britain (2009), and as Eddie in the series The Street (2006), Lord Blandings in the comedy Blandings (2013) and Lord Wallington in the dramatic mini-series Summer of Rockets (2019).\n\nThe father of three children, one of his children, Rafe Spall, is a prolific actor in his own right.\n\nSir Christopher Frank Carandini Lee was perhaps the only actor of his generation to have starred in so many films and cult saga. Although most notable for personifying bloodsucking vampire, Dracula, on screen, he portrayed other varied characters on screen, most of which were villains, whether it be Francisco Scaramanga in the James Bond film, Der Mann mit dem goldenen Colt (1974), or Count Dooku in Star Wars: Episode II - Angriff der Klonkrieger (2002), or as the title monster in the Hammer Horror film, Die Rache der Pharaonen (1959).\n\nLee was born in 1922 in London, England, where he and his older sister Xandra were raised by their parents, Contessa Estelle Marie (Carandini di Sarzano) and Geoffrey Trollope Lee, a professional soldier, until their divorce in 1926. Later, while Lee was still a child, his mother married (and later divorced) Harcourt George St.-Croix (nicknamed Ingle), who was a banker. Lee's maternal great-grandfather was an Italian political refugee, while Lee's great-grandmother was English opera singer Marie (Burgess) Carandini.\n\nAfter attending Wellington College from age 14 to 17, Lee worked as an office clerk in a couple of London shipping companies until 1941 when he enlisted in the Royal Air Force during World War II. Following his release from military service, Lee joined the Rank Organisation in 1947, training as an actor in their \"Charm School\" and playing a number of bit parts in such films as Im Banne der Vergangenheit (1948). He made a brief appearance in Laurence Olivier's Hamlet (1948), in which his future partner-in-horror Peter Cushing also appeared. Both actors also appeared later in Moulin Rouge (1952) but did not meet until their horror films together.\n\nLee had numerous parts in film and television throughout the 1950s. He struggled initially in his new career because he was discriminated as being taller than the leading male actors of his time and being too foreign-looking. However, playing the monster in the Hammer film Frankensteins Fluch (1957) proved to be a blessing in disguise, since the was successful, leading to him being signed on for future roles in Hammer Film Productions.\n\nLee's association with Hammer Film Productions brought him into contact with Peter Cushing, and they became good friends. Lee and Cushing often than not played contrasting roles in Hammer films, where Cushing was the protagonist and Lee the villain, whether it be Van Helsing and Dracula respectively in Dracula (1958), or John Banning and Kharis the Mummy respectively in Die Rache der Pharaonen (1959).\n\nLee continued his role as \"Dracula\" in a number of Hammer sequels throughout the 1960s and into the early 1970s. During this time, he co-starred in Der Hund von Baskerville (1959), and made numerous appearances as Fu Manchu, most notably in the first of the series Ich, Dr. Fu Man Chu (1965), and also appeared in a number of films in Europe. With his own production company, Charlemagne Productions, Ltd., Lee made Das Dunkel der Nacht (1973) and Die Braut des Satans (1976).\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Lee was tiring of his horror image and tried to widen his appeal by participating in several mainstream films, such as Das Privatleben des Sherlock Holmes (1970), Die drei Musketiere (1973), Die vier Musketiere (1974), and the James Bond film Der Mann mit dem goldenen Colt (1974).\n\nThe success of these films prompted him in the late 1970s to move to Hollywood, where he remained a busy actor but made mostly unremarkable film and television appearances, and eventually moved back to England. The beginning of the new millennium relaunched his career to some degree, during which he has played Count Dooku in Star Wars: Episode II - Angriff der Klonkrieger (2002) and as Saruman the White in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Lee played Count Dooku again in Star Wars: Episode III - Die Rache der Sith (2005), and portrayed the father of Willy Wonka, played by Johnny Depp, in the Tim Burton film, Charlie und die Schokoladenfabrik (2005).\n\nOn 16 June 2001, he was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his services to drama. He was created a Knight Bachelor on 13 June 2009 in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for his services to drama and charity. In addition he was made a Commander of the Order of St John on 16 January 1997.\n\nLee died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on 7 June 2015 at 8:30 am after being admitted for respiratory problems and heart failure, shortly after celebrating his 93rd birthday there. His wife delayed the public announcement until 11 June, in order to break the news to their family.\n\nWilliam Claude Rains, born in the Clapham area of London, was the son of the British stage actor Frederick Rains. The younger Rains followed, making his stage debut at the age of eleven in \"Nell of Old Drury.\" Growing up in the world of theater, he saw not only acting up close but the down-to-earth business end as well, progressing from a page boy to a stage manager during his well-rounded learning experience. Rains decided to come to America in 1913 and the New York theater, but with the outbreak of World War I the next year, he returned to serve with a Scottish regiment in Europe. He remained in England, honing his acting talents, bolstered with instruction patronized by the founder of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, Herbert Beerbohm Tree. It was not long before his talent garnered him acknowledgment as one of the leading stage actors on the London scene. His one and only silent film venture was British with a small part for him, the forgettable -- Build Thy House (1920).\n\nIn the meantime, Rains was in demand as acting teacher as well, and he taught at the Royal Academy. Young and eager Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud were perhaps his best known students. Rains did return to New York in 1927 to begin what would be nearly 20 Broadway roles. While working for the Theater Guild, he was offered a screen test with Universal Pictures in 1932. Rains had a unique and solid British voice-deep, slightly rasping -- but richly dynamic. And as a man of small stature, the combination was immediately intriguing. Universal was embarking on its new-found role as horror film factory, and they were looking for someone unique for their next outing, Der Unsichtbare (1933). Rains was the very man. He took the role by the ears, churning up a rasping malice and volume in his voice to achieve a bone chilling persona of the disembodied mad doctor. He could also throw out a high-pitched maniac laugh that would make you leave the lights on before going to bed. True to Universal's formula mentality, it cast him in similar roles through 1934 with some respite in more diverse film roles -- and further relieved by Broadway roles (1933, 1934) for the remainder of his contract. By 1936, he was at Warner Bros. with its ambitious laundry list of literary epics in full swing. His acting was superb, and his eyes could say as much as his voice. And his mouth could take on both a forbidding scowl and the warmest of smiles in an instant. His malicious, gouty Don Luis in Ein rastloses Leben (1936) was inspired. After a shear lucky opportunity to dispatch his young wife's lover, Louis Hayward, in a duel, he triumphs over her in a scene with derisive, bulging eyes and that high pitched laugh -- with appropriate shadow and light backdrop -- that is unforgettable.\n\nHe was kept very busy through the remainder of the 1930s with a mix of benign and devious historical, literary, and contemporary characters always adapting a different nuance -- from murmur to growl -- of that voice to become the person. He culminated the decade with his complex, ethics-tortured Senator \"Joe\" Paine in Mr. Smith geht nach Washington (1939). That year he became an American citizen. Into the 1940s, Rains had risen to perhaps unique stature: a supporting actor who had achieved A-list stardom -- almost in a category by himself. His some 40 films during that period ranged from subtle comedy to psychological drama with a bit of horror revisited; many would be golden era classics. He was the firm but thoroughly sympathetic Dr. Jaquith in Reise aus der Vergangenheit (1942) and the smoothly sardonic but engaging Capt. Louis Renault -- perhaps his best known role -- in Casablanca (1942). He was the surreptitiously nervous and malignant Alexander Sebastian in Ber√ºchtigt (1946) and the egotistical and domineering conductor Alexander Hollenius in Tr√ºgerische Leidenschaft (1946). He was the disfigured Phantom der Oper (1943) as well. He played opposite the challenging Bette Davis in three movies through the decade and came out her equal in acting virtuosity. He was nominated four times for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar -- but incredibly never won. With the 1950s the few movies left to an older Rains were countered by venturing into new acting territory -- television. His haunted, suicidal writer Paul DeLambre in the mountaineering adventure H√∂lle am wei√üen Turm (1950), though a modest part, was perhaps the most vigorously memorable film role of his last years. He made a triumphant Broadway return in 1951's \"Darkness at Noon.\"\n\nRains embraced the innovative TV playhouse circuit with nearly 20 roles. As a favored 'Alfred Hitchcock' alumnus, he starred in five Alfred Hitchcock pr√§sentiert (1955) suspense dramas into the 1960s. And he did not shy away from episodic TV either with some memorable roles that still reflected the power of Claude Rains as consummate actor -- for many, first among peers with that hallowed title.\n\nThe tall, handsome and muscular Scottish actor Sean Connery is best known as the original actor to portray James Bond in the hugely successful movie franchise, starring in seven films between 1962 and 1983. Some believed that such a career-defining role might leave him unable to escape it, but he proved the doubters wrong, becoming one of the most notable film actors of his generation, with a host of great movies to his name. This arguably culminated in his greatest acclaim in 1988, when Connery won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an Irish cop in The Untouchables: Die Unbestechlichen (1987), stealing the thunder from the movie's principal star Kevin Costner. Connery was polled as \"The Greatest Living Scot\" and \"Scotland's Greatest Living National Treasure\". In 1989, he was proclaimed \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by People magazine, and in 1999, at age 69, he was proclaimed \"Sexiest Man of the Century.\"\n\nThomas \"Sean\" Connery was born on August 25, 1930 in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh. His mother, Euphemia Maclean, was a cleaning lady, and his father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and truck driver. He also had a brother, Neil Connery, a plasterer in Edinburgh, who was eight years younger. Before going into acting, Sean had many different jobs, such as a milkman, lorry driver, a laborer, artist's model for the Edinburgh College of Art, coffin polisher and bodybuilder. He also joined the Royal Navy, but was later discharged because of medical problems. At the age of 23, he had a choice between becoming a professional soccer player or an actor, and even though he showed much promise in the sport, he chose acting and said it was one of his more intelligent decisions.\n\nDie blinde Spinne (1957) was Sean's first major movie role, and it was followed by several made-for-TV movies such as Anna Christie (1957), Macbeth (1961) and Anna Karenina (1961) as well as guest appearances on TV series, and also films such as Duell am Steuer (1957), Herz ohne Hoffnung (1958), Das Geheimnis der verwunschenen H√∂hle (1959) and Die Peitsche (1961). In 1962 he appeared in Der l√§ngste Tag (1962) with a host of other stars.\n\nHis big breakthrough came in 1962 when he landed the role of secret agent James Bond in James Bond 007 jagt Dr. No (1962). He played James Bond in six more films: Liebesgr√º√üe aus Moskau (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Feuerball (1965), Man lebt nur zweimal (1967), Diamantenfieber (1971) and Sag Niemals Nie (1983).\n\nAfter and during the success of the Bond films, he maintained a successful career as an actor and has appeared in films, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie (1964), Ein Haufen toller Hunde (1965), Mord im Orient-Express (1974), Der Mann, der K√∂nig sein wollte (1975), Der Wind und der L√∂we (1975), Time Bandits (1981), Highlander: Es kann nur einen geben (1986), Der Name der Rose (1986), Indiana Jones und der letzte Kreuzzug (1989), Jagd auf Roter Oktober (1990), Die Wiege der Sonne (1993), The Rock: Fels der Entscheidung (1996), Forrester - Gefunden! (2000) and Die Liga der au√üergew√∂hnlichen Gentlemen (2003).\n\nSean married actress Diane Cilento in 1962 and they had Sean's only child, Jason Connery, born on January 11, 1963. The couple announced their separation in February 1971 and filed for divorce 2¬Ω years later. Sean then dated Jill St. John, Lana Wood, Magda Konopka and Carole Mallory. In 1975 he married Micheline Roquebrune and they stayed married, despite Sean's well-documented love affair with Lynsey de Paul in the late '80s. Sean had three stepchildren through his marriage to Micheline, who was one year his senior. He is also a grandfather. His son, Jason and Jason's ex-wife, actress Mia Sara had a son, Dashiell Connery, in 1997.\n\nSean Connery died at the age of 90 on October 31, 2020, in Nassau, the Bahamas, where he resided for many years.\n\nProbably best-remembered for his turbulent personal life with Elizabeth Taylor (whom he married twice), Richard Burton was nonetheless also regarded as an often brilliant British actor of the post-WWII period.\n\nBurton was born Richard Walter Jenkins in 1925 into a Welsh (Cymraeg)-speaking family in Pontrhydyfen to Edith Maude (Thomas) and Richard Walter Jenkins, a coal miner. The twelfth of thirteen children, his mother died while he was a toddler and his father later abandoned the family, leaving him to be raised by an elder sister, Cecilia. An avid fan of Shakespeare, poetry and reading, he once said \"home is where the books are\". He received a scholarship to Oxford University to study acting and made his first stage appearance in 1944.\n\nHis first film appearances were in routine British movies such as The Last Days of Dolwyn (1949), Waterfront (1950) and Green Grow the Rushes (1951). Then he started to appear in Hollywood movies such as Meine Cousine Rachel (1952), Das Gewand (1953) and Alexander der Gro√üe (1956), added to this he was also spending considerable time in stage productions, both in the UK and USA, often to splendid reviews. The late 1950s was an exciting and inventive time in UK cinema, often referred to as the \"British New Wave\", and Burton was right in the thick of things, and showcased a sensational performance in Blick zur√ºck im Zorn (1959). He also appeared with a cavalcade of international stars in the World War II magnum opus Der l√§ngste Tag (1962), and then onto arguably his most \"notorious\" role as that of Marc Antony opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the hugely expensive Cleopatra (1963). This was, of course, the film that kick-started their fiery and passionate romance (plus two marriages), and the two of them appeared in several productions over the next few years including Hotel International (1963), ...die alles begehren (1965), the dynamic Wer hat Angst vor Virginia Woolf? (1966) and Der Widerspenstigen Z√§hmung (1967), as well as box office flops like Die Stunde der Kom√∂dianten (1967). Burton did better when he was off on his own giving higher caliber performances, such as those in Becket (1964), the film adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play Die Nacht des Leguan (1964), the brilliant espionage thriller Der Spion, der aus der K√§lte kam (1965) and alongside Clint Eastwood in the World War II action adventure film Agenten sterben einsam (1968).\n\nHis audience appeal began to decline somewhat by the end of the 1960s as fans turned to younger, more virile male stars, however Burton was superb in K√∂nigin f√ºr tausend Tage (1969) as King Henry VIII, he put on a reasonable show in the boring Im Morgengrauen brach die H√∂lle los (1971), was over the top in the awful Die alles zur Sau machen (1971), gave sleepwalking performances in Hammersmith ist raus (1972) and Blaubart (1972), and was wildly miscast in the ludicrous Das M√§dchen und der M√∂rder - Die Ermordung Trotzkis (1972).\n\nBy the early 1970s, quality male lead roles were definitely going to other stars, and Burton found himself appearing in some movies of dubious quality, just to pay the bills and support family, including Seine Scheidung, ihre Scheidung (1973) (his last on-screen appearance with Taylor), Verflucht sind sie alle (1974), Fl√ºchtige Begegnung (1974), Jackpot (1974) (which was never completed) and Exorzist II - Der Ketzer (1977). However, he won another Oscar nomination for his excellent performance as a concerned psychiatrist in Fliehende Pferde (1977). He appeared with fellow acting icons Richard Harris and Roger Moore in Die Wildg√§nse kommen (1978) about mercenaries in South Africa. While the film had a modest initial run, over the past thirty-five years it has picked up quite a cult following. His final performances were as the wily inquisitor \"O'Brien\" in the most recent film version of George Orwell's dystopian 1984 (1984), in which he won good reviews, and in the TV mini series Die Stra√üen von Ellis Island (1984). He passed away on August 5, 1984 in Celigny, Switzerland from a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nPeter Wilton Cushing was born on May 26, 1913 in Kenley, Surrey, England, to Nellie Maria (King) and George Edward Cushing, a quantity surveyor. He and his older brother David were raised first in Dulwich Village, a south London suburb, and then later back in Surrey. At an early age, Cushing was attracted to acting, inspired by his favorite aunt, who was a stage actress. While at school, Cushing pursued his acting interest in acting and also drawing, a talent he put to good use later in his first job as a government surveyor's assistant in Surrey. At this time, he also dabbled in local amateur theater until moving to London to attend the Guildhall School of Music and Drama on scholarship. He then performed in repertory theater in Worthing, deciding in 1939 to head for Hollywood, where he made his film debut in Der Mann mit der eisernen Maske (1939). Other Hollywood films included Dick und Doof als Studenten (1940) with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, Vigil in the Night (1940) and They Dare Not Love (1941). However, after a short stay, he returned to England by way of New York (making brief appearances on Broadway) and Canada. Back in his homeland, he contributed to the war effort during World War II by joining the Entertainment National Services Association.\n\nAfter the war, he performed in the West End and had his big break appearing with Laurence Olivier in Hamlet (1948), in which Cushing's future partner-in-horror Christopher Lee had a bit part. Both actors also appeared in Moulin Rouge (1952) but did not meet until their later horror films. During the 1950s, Cushing became a familiar face on British television, appearing in numerous teleplays, such as 1984 (1954) and Beau Brummell (1954), until the end of the decade when he began his legendary association with Hammer Film Productions in its remakes of the 1930s Universal horror classics. His first Hammer roles included Dr. Frankenstein in Frankensteins Fluch (1957), Dr. Van Helsing in Dracula (1958), and Sherlock Holmes in Der Hund von Baskerville (1959).\n\nCushing continued playing the roles of Drs. Frankenstein and Van Helsing, as well as taking on other horror characters, in Hammer films over the next 20 years. He also appeared in films for the other major horror producer of the time, Amicus Productions, including Die Todeskarten des Dr. Schreck (1965) and its later horror anthologies, a couple of Dr. Who films (1965, 1966), I, Monster (1971), and others. By the mid-1970s, these companies had stopped production, but Cushing, firmly established as a horror star, continued in the genre for some time thereafter.\n\nPerhaps his best-known appearance outside of horror films was as Grand Moff Tarkin in George Lucas' phenomenally successful science fiction film Star Wars: Episode IV - Eine neue Hoffnung (1977). Der Biggels-Effekt (1986) was Cushing's last film before his retirement, during which he made a few television appearances, wrote two autobiographies and pursued his hobbies of bird watching and painting. In 1989, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his contributions to the acting profession in Britain and worldwide. Peter Cushing died at age 81 of prostate cancer on August 11, 1994.\n\nA classical actor (and founding member in 1960 of the Royal Shakespeare Company), Richardson earned international fame as the villainous Francis Urquart in the BBC television trilogy, \"House of Cards.\" Uttered in a cut-glass accent, the Machiavellian Prime Minister's sly \"You might well think that ... I couldn't possibly comment\" became a catchphrase when the series was broadcast in the 1990s. Richardson's contributions to his art were honored in 1989 when he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE.) Fittingly, his family had his ashes buried beneath the auditorium of the new Royal Shakespeare theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon.\n\nBorn the son of John and Margaret (Drummond) Richardson on April 7, 1934, he was educated at Tynecastle School in Edinburgh, and studied for the stage at the College of Dramatic Art in Glasgow, where he was awarded the James Bridie Gold Medal in 1957. He joined the Birmingham Repertory Theatre Company a year later where he played Hamlet as well as John Worthing in \"The Importance of being Earnest.\" In 1960 he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (then called the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre) and drew excellent notices for his work in \"The Merchant of Venice,\" \"Twelfth Night,\" \"The Winter's Tale,\" \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" \"The Taming of the Shrew,\" \"The Comedy of Errors\" and \"King Lear\", among others. In 1964 Richardson played the role of the Herald before advancing to the title role of Jean-Paul Marat in the stunning, avant-garde RSC production of \"Marat-Sade\". In addition, he made his Broadway debut in said role at the very end of 1965, and recreated it to critical acclaim in Peter Brooks' film adaptation with Glenda Jackson as murderess Charlotte Corday. Richardson also went on to replay Oberon in a lukewarm film version of RSC's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1968) that nevertheless bore an elite company of Britain's finest pre-Dames -- Judi Dench, Helen Mirren and Diana Rigg. One of his lower film points during that time period, however, was appearing in the huge musical movie misfire Der Mann von La Mancha (1972) in the role of the Padre opposite Peter O'Toole and Sophia Loren.\n\nRichardson was never far from the Shakespearean stage after his induction into films with majestic portraits of Coriolanus, Pericles, Richard II, Richard III, Cassius (\"Julius Caesar\"), Malcolm (\"Macbeth\"), Angelo (\"Measure for Measure\"), Prospero (\"The Tempest\") and Mercutio (\"Romeo and \"Juliet\") paving the way. Elsewhere on Broadway he received a Drama Desk Award and Tony nomination for his splendid Henry Higgins in a revival of \"My Fair Lady\" in 1976, and was part of the cast of the short-lived (12 performances) production of \"Lolita\" (1981), written by Edward Albee and starring Donald Sutherland as Humbert Humbert.\n\nCustomary of many talented Scots, Richardson would find his best on-camera roles in plush, intelligent TV mini-series. On the Shakespearean front he appeared in TV adaptations of As You Like It (1963), All's Well That Ends Well (1968) and Much Ado About Nothing (1978). After delivering highly capable performances as Field-Marshal Montgomery in both Churchill and the Generals (1979) and Ike (1979), Sherlock Holmes in Der Hund von Baskerville (1983), and Indian Prime Minister Nehru in Lord Mountbatten: The Last Viceroy (1986), he capped his small-screen career in the role of the immoral politician Francis Urquhart in a trio of dramatic satires: Ein Kartenhaus (1990), Um Kopf und Krone (1993) and The final Cut - T√∂dliches Risiko (1995). His impeccably finely-tuned villain became one his best remembered roles.\n\nFilmwise, Richardson's stature did not grow despite polished work in Brazil (1985), Schrei nach Freiheit (1987), Rosenkranz & G√ºldenstern (1990), M. Butterfly (1993), Dark City (1998), and the lightweight mainstream fare Beverly Hills Beauties (1997) and 102 Dalmatiner (2000). He appeared less and less on stage in his later years. He took his final stage bows in 2006 with West End productions of \"The Creeper\" and \"The Alchemist\".\n\nThe urbane 72-year-old actor died unexpectedly in his sleep at his London abode on February 9, 2007, survived by his widow Maroussia Frank (his wife from 1961 and an RSC actress who played an asylum inmate alongside him in \"Marat-Sade\") and two sons, one of whom, Miles Richardson, has been a resident performer with the RSC.\n\nAn oddly fascinating bloke with prominent bony cheeks and rawboned figure, Peter William (Pete) Postlethwaite was born on February 16, 1946 and was a distinguished character actor on stage, TV and film. Growing up the youngest of four siblings in a Catholic family in Warrington, Lancashire (near Liverpool) in middle-class surroundings to working-class parents, he attended St Mary's University (London). However, while completing his studies, he developed an interest in theatre, to the chagrin of his father, who wanted his children to find secure positions in life.\n\nA drama teacher initially at a Catholic girls convent school, he decided to follow his acting instincts full-time and gradually built up an impressive array of classical stage credits via repertory, including the Bristol Old Vic Drama School, and in stints with Liverpool Everyman, Manchester Royal Exchange and the Royal Shakespeare Company. By the 1980s he was ready to branch out into film and TV, giving a startling performance as a wife abuser in the Entfernte Stimmen - Stilleben (1988).\n\nBy 1993 he had crossed over into Hollywood parts and earned his first Oscar nomination for his superb role as Daniel Day-Lewis' father in Im Namen des Vaters (1993). Other quality roles came his way with Die √ºblichen Verd√§chtigen (1995), Brassed Off - Mit Pauken und Trompeten (1996), and Amistad - Das Sklavenschiff (1997). He did fine work on television in Die Scharfsch√ºtzen - 3. Kommando ohne Wiederkehr (1994), Lost for Words (1999), and The Sins (2000). Postlethwaite worked equally both in the UK and abroad, and avoided the public limelight for the most part, except for occasional displays of political activism.\n\nPostlethwaite lived quietly out of the spotlight in England and continued on in films with roles in Schiffsmeldungen (2001), The Limit (2004), Dark Water - Dunkle Wasser (2005), Das Omen (2006), Ghost Son (2007) and Solomon Kane (2009). In 2010, he was seen in Kampf der Titanen (2010), Inception (2010) and The Town - Stadt ohne Gnade (2010).\n\nPostlewaite died on January 2, 2011, at age 64, of pancreatic cancer. He was surrounded by his wife and son, and by his daughter from a prior relationship.\n\nLaurence Olivier could speak William Shakespeare's lines as naturally as if he were \"actually thinking them\", said English playwright Charles Bennett, who met Olivier in 1927. Laurence Kerr Olivier was born in Dorking, Surrey, England, to Agnes Louise (Crookenden) and Gerard Kerr Olivier, a High Anglican priest. His surname came from a great-great-grandfather who was of French Huguenot origin.\n\nOne of Olivier's earliest successes as a Shakespearean actor on the London stage came in 1935 when he played \"Romeo\" and \"Mercutio\" in alternate performances of \"Romeo and Juliet\" with John Gielgud. A young Englishwoman just beginning her career on the stage fell in love with Olivier's Romeo. In 1937, she was \"Ophelia\" to his \"Hamlet\" in a special performance at Kronborg Castle, Elsinore (Helsing√∏r), Denmark. In 1940, she became his second wife after both returned from making films in America that were major box office hits of 1939. His film was St√ºrmische H√∂hen (1939), her film was Vom Winde verweht (1939). Vivien Leigh and Olivier were screen lovers in Feuer √ºber England (1937), 21 Days (1940) and Lord Nelsons letzte Liebe (1941).\n\nThere was almost a fourth film together in 1944 when Olivier and Leigh traveled to Scotland with Charles C. Bennett to research the real-life story of a Scottish girl accused of murdering her French lover. Bennett recalled that Olivier researched the story \"with all the thoroughness of Sherlock Holmes\" and \"we unearthed evidence, never known or produced at the trial, that would most certainly have sent the young lady to the gallows\". The film project was then abandoned. During their two-decade marriage, Olivier and Leigh appeared on the stage in England and America and made films whenever they really needed to make some money.\n\nIn 1951, Olivier was working on a screen adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's novel \"Sister Carrie\" (Carrie (1952)) while Leigh was completing work on the film version of the Tennessee Williams' play, Endstation Sehnsucht (1951). She won her second Oscar for bringing \"Blanche DuBois\" to the screen. Carrie (1952) was a film that Olivier never talked about. George Hurstwood, a middle-aged married man from Chicago who tricked a young woman into leaving a younger man about to marry her, became a New York street person in the novel. Olivier played him as a somewhat nicer person who didn't fall quite as low. A PBS documentary on Olivier's career broadcast in 1987 covered his first sojourn in Hollywood in the early 1930s with his first wife, Jill Esmond, and noted that her star was higher than his at that time. On film, he was upstaged by his second wife, too, even though the list of films he made is four times as long as hers.\n\nMore than half of his film credits come after Der Kom√∂diant (1960), which started out as a play in London in 1957. When the play moved across the Atlantic to Broadway in 1958, the role of \"Archie Rice\"'s daughter was taken over by Joan Plowright, who was also in the film. They married soon after the release of Der Kom√∂diant (1960).\n\nMichael Caine was born as Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in London, to Ellen (n√©e Burchell), a cook, and Maurice Micklewhite Sr., a fish-market porter. He had a younger brother, Stanley Caine, and an older maternal half-brother named David Burchell. He left school at age 15 and took a series of working-class jobs before joining the British army and serving in Korea during the Korean War, where he saw combat. Upon his return to England, he gravitated toward the theater and got a job as an assistant stage manager. He adopted the name of Caine on the advice of his agent, taking it from a marquee that advertised Die Caine war ihr Schicksal (1954). In the years that followed, he worked in more than 100 television dramas, with repertory companies throughout England and eventually in the stage hit \"The Long and the Short and the Tall\".\n\nZulu - Die Schlacht von Rorke's Drift (1964), the epic retelling of a historic 19th-century battle in South Africa between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, brought Caine to international attention. Instead of being typecast as a low-ranking Cockney soldier, he played a snobbish, aristocratic officer. Although \"Zulu\" was a major success, it was the role of Harry Palmer in Ipcress - streng geheim (1965) and the title role in Der Verf√ºhrer l√§√üt sch√∂n gr√º√üen (1966) that made Caine a star of the first magnitude. He epitomized the new breed of actor in mid-1960s England, the working-class bloke with glasses and a down-home accent. However, after initially starring in some excellent films, particularly in the 1960s, including Das M√§dchen aus der Cherry-Bar (1966), Finale in Berlin (1966), Ein dreckiger Haufen (1969), Die Luftschlacht um England (1969), Himmelfahrtskommando Okinawa (1970), Das vergessene Tal (1971) and especially Jack rechnet ab (1971), he seemed to take on roles in below-average films, simply for the money he could by then command.\n\nHowever, there were some gems amongst the dross. He gave a magnificent performance opposite Sean Connery in Der Mann, der K√∂nig sein wollte (1975) and turned in a solid one as a German colonel in Der Adler ist gelandet (1976). Rita will es endlich wissen (1983), Schuld daran ist Rio (1984) and Hannah und ihre Schwestern (1986) (for which he won his first Oscar) were highlights of the 1980s, while more recently Little Voice (1998), Gottes Werk und Teufels Beitrag (1999) (his second Oscar) and Letzte Runde (2001) have been widely acclaimed. Caine played Nigel Powers in the parody sequel Austin Powers in Goldst√§nder (2002), and Alfred Pennyworth in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. He appeared in several other of Nolan's films including Prestige - Die Meister der Magie (2006), Inception (2010) and Interstellar (2014). He also appeared as a supporting character in Alfonso Cuar√≥n's Children of Men (2006) and Pixar's sequel Cars 2 (2011).\n\nAs of 2015, films in which Caine has starred have grossed over $7.4 billion worldwide. He is ranked the ninth highest grossing box office star. Caine is one of several actors nominated for an Academy Award for acting every decade from five consecutive decades (the other being Laurence Olivier and Meryl Streep). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1992 Birthday Honours, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2000 Birthday Honours in recognition for his contributions to the cinema.\n\nCaine has been married twice. First to actress Patricia Haines from 1954 to 1958. They had a daughter, Dominique, in 1957. A bachelor for some dozen-plus years after the divorce, he was romantically linked to Edina Ronay (for three years), Elizabeth Ercy, Nancy Sinatra, Natalie Wood, Candice Bergen, Bianca Jagger, Fran√ßoise Pascal and Jill St. John. In 1971 he met his second wife, fashion model Shakira Caine (n√©e Baksh), and they married in 1973, six months before their daughter Natasha was born. The couple has three grandchildren, and in 2023, they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.\n\nUnassuming, innocent-eyed and undeniably ingratiating, Brit comedy actor Ian Carmichael was quite the popular chap in late 50s and early 60s film. He was born in Hull, Yorkshire, England on June 18, 1920, the son of Arthur Denholm Carmichael, an optician, and his wife Kate (Gillett). After receiving his schooling at Bromsgove High School and Scarborough College, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and trained there, making his stage debut as a mute robot in \"RUR\". in 1939. That same year he also appeared as Claudius in \"Julius Caesar\" and was appearing a revue production of \"Nine Sharp\" (1940) when his young career was interrupted by WWII. He served in Europe for many years with the Royal Armoured Corps as a commissioned officer in the 22nd Dragoons.\n\nIan returned to the theatre in 1947 with roles in four productions: \"She Wanted a Cream Front Door\", \"I Said to Myself\", \"Cupid and Mars\" and \"Out of the Frying Pan\". He also sharpened his farcical skills in music hall revues where he worked with such revue legends as Hermione Baddeley and Dora Bryan. Given his first film bit as a waiter in Bond Street (1948), he continued in rather obscure roles for several years. While he was sincerely capable of playing it serious, which would include roles in the U.S. film Verraten (1954) starring Clark Gable and Lana Turner, as well as the war-themed adventures The Colditz Story (1955) and Sturm √ºber dem Nil (1955), it was his association with late 50s \"silly-ass\" comedy that gave his cinematic career a noticeable boost. After repeating his stage success (the only cast member to do do) playing David Prentice in the film version of Simon und Laura (1955) opposite Kay Kendall and Peter Finch, he co-starred in a series of droll satires for the Boulting Brothers and Ealing Studios. While he might have been upstaged on occasion by a motley crew of scene-stealers (Terry-Thomas, Peter Sellers, Raymond Huntley, Margaret Rutherford), Ian was sublimely funny himself as the hapless klutz caught up in their shenanigans. Der beste Mann beim Milit√§r (1956), the service comedy which got the whole ball rolling, and its sequel, Junger Mann aus gutem Hause (1959), along with the Boulting's Volltreffer ins Gl√ºck (1957) Brothers in Law (1957) and Wenn zwei Hochzeit machen (1958) firmly established Ian as a slapstick movie star.\n\nThe inane fun continued into the 60s with ripe vehicles in Light Up the Sky! (1960), School for Scoundrels (1960), Double Bunk (1961), The Amorous Prawn (1962) and Himmlische Freuden (1963). During the late 1960s and 1970s, he found more fulfillment playing wry, bemused, upper-crust characters on comedy TV, particularly his Bertie Wooster in The World of Wooster (1965) which reunited him with frequent Boulting Brothers co-star Dennis Price as Jeeves, Wooster's chilly-mannered personal valet. Ian's leading role as the Bachelor Father (1970), based on the story of a real-life perennial bachelor who took on several foster children, only added to his popularity. In later years, he was frequently heard on the BBC radio.\n\nIan made vigilant returns to the comedy stage whenever possible in such lightweight vehicles as \"The Tunnel of Love\", \"The Gazebo\", \"Critic's Choice\", \"Birds on the Wing\", \"Darling, I'm Home\", \"Springtime for Henry\" and appeared in his last musical \"I Do! I Do!\" in 1968. Earlier, in 1965, he made his Broadway debut starring in \"Boeing-Boeing\", which lasted only a few weeks. A more successful revival of this show showed up on Broadway in 2008.\n\nSemi-retired since the mid-1980s, Ian continued to show elderly spryness here and there with a smattering of films including Die herrlichen sieben Tods√ºnden (1971), Die T√ºr ins Jenseits (1974), Die t√∂dliche Botschaft (1979) and Death and Desire (1989). On TV, he was quite popular in the role of the gentleman detective Lord Peter Wimsey in several crime mystery mini-series: Lord Peter Wimsey - Diskrete Zeugen (1972), Lord Peter Wimsey: √Ñrger im Bellona-Club (1972), Lord Peter Wimsey: Mord braucht Reklame (1973), Lord Peter Wimsey: Die neun Schneider (1974) and Lord Peter Wimsey: F√ºnf falsche F√§hrten (1975), and had a recurring role on the TV series Strathblair (1992).\n\nTo cap his career off, he was honored as an OBE in the 2003 Queen's Birthday Honours List. Made a widower after 40 years by his first wife Jean (Pym) McLean, he married novelist/radio producer Kate Fenton, who is over thirty years his junior, in 1992. He has two daughters, Lee and Sally, from his first marriage. In 1979, his autobiography, \"Will the Real Ian Carmichael?...\", was published.\n\nA charmer to the end, his last (recurring) appearance was on the TV series The Royal (2003) in 2009. The actor died on February 7, 2010, following a month-long illness.\n\nActing chameleon Sir Tom Courtenay, along with Sir Alan Bates and Albert Finney, became a front-runner in an up-and-coming company of rebel upstarts who created quite a stir in British \"kitchen sink\" cinema during the early '60s. An undying love for the theatre, however, had Courtenay channeling a different course from the aforementioned greats and he never, by his own choosing, attained comparable cinematic stardom.\n\nThe gaunt and glum, fair-haired actor was born Thomas Daniel Courtenay into modest surroundings on February 25, 1937, in Hull, East Yorkshire, England, the son of Thomas Henry Courtenay, a ship painter, and his wife, Anne Eliza (n√©e Quest). Graduating from Kingston High School there, he trained in drama at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. His reputation as an actor grew almost immediately with his professional debut in 1960 as Konstantin in \"The Seagull\" at the Old Vic. Following tours in Scotland and London with the play, Tom performed in \"Henry IV, Part I\" and \"Twelfth Night\" (also at the Old Vic) before assuming the title role of Billy from Albert Finney in the critically acclaimed drama \"Billy Liar\" at the Cambridge Theatre in 1961. The story, which tells of a Yorkshire man who creates a fantasy world to shield himself from his mundane middle-class woes, was the initial spark in Tom's rise to fame.\n\nThe recognition he received landed him squarely into the heap of things as a new wave of \"angry young men\" were taking over British cinema during the swinging '60s. Singled out for his earlier stage work at RADA, he was eventually handed the title role in the war film Private Potter (1963), but it was his second movie that clinched stardom. Winning the role of Colin Smith in Die Einsamkeit des Langstreckenl√§ufers (1962), Courtenay invested everything he had in this bruising portrayal of youthful desolation and rebellion. As a reform school truant whose solitary sentencing for robbing a bakery leads to a reawakening and subsequent recognition as a long distance runner, he was awarded a \"Promising Newcomer\" award from the British Film Academy, It was Courtenay then, and not Finney, who recreated his stage triumph as Billy Fisher in the stark film version of Geliebter Spinner (1963). British Film Academy nominations came his way for this and for his fourth movie role in F√ºr K√∂nig und Vaterland (1964). Vivid contributions to the films Sie nannten ihn King (1965), the ever-popular Doktor Schiwago (1965), which earned him his first Oscar nomination, and Die Nacht der Generale (1967) followed.\n\nDespite all this cinematic glory, Courtenay did not enjoy the process of movie-making and reverted to his first passion -- the theatre -- beginning in 1966. Displaying his versatility with roles in such classic works as \"The Cherry Orchard,\" \"Macbeth\" (as Malcolm), \"Charley's Aunt,\" \"The Playboy of the Western World,\" \"Hamlet,\" \"She Stoops to Conquer,\" \"Peer Gynt\" and \"Arms and the Man,\" he still found scattered work in films, including Der Tag, an dem die Fische kamen (1967), Todestanz eines Killers (1968) and Ein Pechvogel namens Otley (1969), but none matched his earlier brilliance. In 1971 he took a self-imposed, decade-long sabbatical from filming.\n\nForming a sturdy association with the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester that would last over a decade, he continued to impress with lead roles in \"The Rivals\" and \"The Prince of Homburg\". Following his huge success as the libidinous Norman in \"The Norman Conquests\" in London, he made his Broadway debut with \"Otherwise Engaged\" (1977) and earned a Tony nomination and Drama League Award in the process. It was his second Tony-nominated triumph in \"The Dresser\" in 1980-1981, however, that lured Courtenay back to films when he was asked to recreate the role for the large screen. Ein ungleiches Paar - The Dresser (1983) co-starred Tom as the mincing personal assistant to an appallingly self-destructive stage star played by Albert Finney (Paul Rogers played the role with Tom on Broadway) who struggles to get the actor through a rigorous performance of \"King Lear\". Both British actors received Oscar nominations but lost the 1984 \"Best Actor\" award to American Robert Duvall.\n\nSince then Tom has appeared on occasion in TV and film roles -- usually in support. A few standouts include the films Gib's Ihm Chris! (1991), Was geschah mit Harold Smith? (1999), Letzte Runde (2001) and Nicholas Nickleby (2002), as well as the TV mini-series A Rather English Marriage (1998), for which he earned a British Television Award, Klein Dorrit (2008) and the series Unforgotten (2015) for which he won a BAFTA award.\n\nOver the years Sir Tom has excelled in solo stage shows as well. As a chronic alcoholic in \"Moscow Stations,\" he won the 1994 London Critics Circle Theatre and London Evening Standard Theatre awards for \"Best Actor.\" In 2002, he wrote the one-man show \"Pretending To Be Me,\" based on the letters and writings of poet Philip Larkin. In the past decade he has continued to distinguish himself on both the classical (\"King Lear,\" \"Uncle Vanya\") and contemporary (\"Art\") stages.\n\nCourtenay's marriage to actress Cheryl Kennedy lasted about a decade (from 1973 to 1982). In 1988 he married Isabel Crossley, a stage manager at the Royal Exchange Theatre in London. He has no children from either marriage. In 1999, Sir Tom Courtenay was awarded an honorary doctorate from Hull University and in 2000 published his memoir \"Dear Tom: Letters From Home\", which earned strong reviews. Knighthood came a year after that.\n\nWidely regarded as one of greatest stage and screen actors both in his native Great Britain and internationally, twice nominated for the Oscar and recipient of every major theatrical award in the UK and US, Ian Murray McKellen was born on May 25, 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire, England, to Margery Lois (Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen, a civil engineer and lay preacher. He is of Scottish, Northern Irish, and English descent. During his early childhood, his parents moved with Ian and his older sister, Jean, to the mill town of Wigan. It was in this small town that young Ian rode out World War II. He soon developed a fascination with acting and the theatre, which was encouraged by his parents. They would take him to plays, those by William Shakespeare, in particular. The amateur school productions fostered Ian's growing passion for theatre.\n\nWhen Ian was of age to begin attending school, he made sure to get roles in all of the productions. At Bolton School in particular, he developed his skills early on. Indeed, his first role in a Shakespearian play was at Bolton, as Malvolio in \"Twelfth Night\". Ian soon began attending Stratford-upon-Avon theatre festivals, where he saw the greats perform: Laurence Olivier, Wendy Hiller, John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson and Paul Robeson. He continued his education in English Drama, but soon it fell by the wayside as he concentrated more and more on performing. He eventually obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1961, and began his career in earnest.\n\nMcKellen began working in theatre over the next few years. Very few people knew of Ian's homosexuality; he saw no reason to go public, nor had he told his family. They did not seem interested in the subject and so he saw no reason to bring it up. In 1988, Ian publicly came out of the closet on the BBC Radio 4 program, while discussing Margaret Thatcher's \"Section 28\" legislation, which made the promotion of homosexuality as a family relationship by local authorities an offense. It was reason enough for McKellen to take a stand. He has been active in the gay rights movement ever since.\n\nIan resides in Limehouse, where he has also lived with his former long-time partner Sean Mathias. The two men have also worked together on the film Bent (1997) as well as in exquisite stage productions. To this day, McKellen works mostly in theatre, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990 for his efforts in the arts. However, he has managed to make several quite successful forays into film. He has appeared in several productions of Shakespeare's works including his well received Richard III (1995), and in a variety of other movies. However, it has only been recently that his star has finally begun to shine in the eyes of North American audiences. Roles in various films, Cold Comfort Farm (1995), Der Mustersch√ºler (1998) and Gods and Monsters (1998), riveted audiences. The latter, in particular, created a sensation in Hollywood, and McKellen's role garnered him several of awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe and an Oscar nod. McKellen, as he continues to work extensively on stage, he always keeps in 'solidifying' his 'role' as Laurence Olivier's worthy 'successor' in the best sense too, such as King Lear (2008) / King Lear (2008) directed by Trevor Nunn and in a range of other staggering performances full of generously euphoric delight that have included \"Peter Pan\" and No√´l Coward's \"Present Laughter\", as well as Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\" and Harold Pinter's \"No Man's Land\" (National Theatre Live: No Man's Land (2016)), both in acclaimed productions brilliantly directed by Sean Mathias.\n\nMcKellen found mainstream success with his performance as Magneto in X-Men (2000) and its sequels. His largest mark on the big screen may be as Gandalf in \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, which he reprised in \"The Hobbit\" trilogy. He also reprised the role of 'King Lear' with new artistic perspectives in National Theatre Live: King Lear (2018) offering an invaluable mesmerizing experience as a natural force of stage - and screen - of infinite generosity through his unsurpassable interpretation of the titanically vulnerable king."
