        "text": "Descendents of John Barker, Sr. and Martha Snead\n\nfrom website of John Barker: Barkers of Mendota Virginia\n\nGeneration No. 1\n\n1. John2 Barker, Sr. (Edward1) (Source: E-mail from Arthur Scott Clark.) was born 1732 in St. Pauls Parrish, Hanover County, VA (Source: E-mail from Arthur Scott Clark.), and died Aft. 1796 in Washington County, VA (Source: Virginia Land Office Treasury Warrant No. 13741.). He married Martha Snead (Source: E-mail from Arthur Scott Clark.). She was born 1725 in Hanover County, VA (Source: E-mail from Arthur Scott Clark.), and died in probably Washington County, VA.\n\nNotes for John Barker, Sr.:\n\nEven though the following newspaper article is not necessarily historically accurate, I list this article about the \"great\" Barker family reunion for several reasons.\n\nFirst, I needed a theme to tie my web page together and make it more interesting to the viewer. Mary Kate Barker, daughter of William Jasper Barker Sr., sent her copy of the article to one of her cousins and eventually a copy of it was mailed to my father. At the time, my father could only identify a few groups of people mentioned even though he had a passion for any information about his heritage. In the age before the Internet and nearly instant communication, my father and other related Barkers often had little success gathering this information. As a starting place for my own search, this newspaper article has been invaluable.\n\nThis article also depicts life around the turn of the century and the reunion was located in Mendota, the area of the Barker settlement in Washington County, Virginia, and where many of their descendants are still living today.\n\nI also list this newspaper article here to show that many of these turn-of-the-century descendants actually knew each other and probably knew how they were related to one other. Some traveled from adjacent counties over mountainous terrain to attend this reunion in an era when travel was much more difficult than today. Obviously, kinship was important to them. Many of the living, \"turn-of-the-millennium\" Barkers have forgotten this and how they are related to others. This kinship and heritage shouldn't be lost forever.\n\nOf those attending who have been identified, all are descendants of John Barker and Martha Snead.\n\n***\n\nMy notes in parenthesis-JKB [southwestern_va_menu.htm]\n\nFrom: The Bristol News, Weekly Edition Tuesday, December 4, 1906\n\nBarker Reunion at Mendota. A SUNDAY SPENT WITH THE BARKERS.\n\nDescendants of an Old English Family --- A Large Number Present---Address by Dr. W. M. Barker.\n\n---\n\nThe quiet little village of Mendota that lies nestled at the foot of Clinch mountain where rolls the North Fork of the Holston, was aroused from its slumbers on Sunday morning, November 25th, by the tramp of horses and the rumble of vehicles, as they gathered about the Baptist Church in the central part of the town.\n\nThe occasion of the gathering was the great Barker reunion and the coming together of so many of that name, has aroused quite an interest in that old family of Virginia, and especially in this part of the Old Dominion where dwell so many who are in some way connected with the aforementioned people.\n\nThe Mendota gathering was mainly from three counties, Washington, Scott and Lee.\n\nRev William Millard Barker, D. D., of Kentucky, was made the guest of honor, and he addressed the large assemblage of people, who listened intently for more than an hour.\n\nThe Barker family originated in England with a family of tanners, and took their name from the practice of peeling bark from the trees for use their business. The name has been corrupted in some instances into Barkley, Barksfur, and Barkman. All these names come from the same parentage, and properly belong to the Barker family.\n\nEnglish history and archives record several dukes and baronets among this family.\n\nThree prominent families of this name emigrated to America early in the sixteenth century, one landing on the New England coast, one on the Virginia coast, and one on the Carolina coast. From the second mentioned family come all the Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania Barkers. Of this family is the Hon Wharton Barker, who was nominated for President of the United States by the Populist party some years ago.\n\nThe present Rear Admiral Barker, of the United States navy, and the Rev. W. M. Barker, D. D., of Kentucky, editor of the Baptist Flag, one of the most widely circulated papers of the South, published at Fulton, Ky., are also of this old Virginia family. From this branch, too, are some noted women. It is related that one Elizabeth Barker refused an offor of marriage from Thomas Jefferson and afterwards married Colonel Rolston, of North Carolina.\n\nThese incidents are merely mentioned to show the capabilities of this strain of people, who as a whole are characterized by principles of bravery, honesty and a simple unostentatious and modest intellectuality that has here and there produced some vigorous characters in all prominent callings of American activities.\n\nThe Barker blood, brawn and brains, above all else, believes in fair play and free exercise for all. They love peace, but are willing to fight for it if necessary.\n\nFrom Calverhall in the parish of Aderly, England, the pathway of the progenitor of this family, whose name is now legion, is more or less dimly traced through the sonny clime of Wales in the reign of Edward II, until he begins to help make history at Jamestown, Virginia, and all along we may find here and there the pages illuminated by his faithful contributions to the great charter of English liberties, American independence, the subjugation and plenishing of the colonies, ever contributing a wide and numerous citizenship famed for modesty and to crime unknown.\n\nThe reunion was quite a success, and the day was most pleasantly spent.\n\nIt was impossible to see and get the names of all those present, but among the large assemblage, we note the following:\n\nMr. and Mrs. F.

D., editor of the Baptist Flag, Fulton, Ky. This gentleman is the instigator of this reunion., and it is not here out of place to give a brief sketch of this noted gentleman and noted divine. He was born Nov. 17th, 1852, in the valley near Hiltons, Va., and with his fatherï¿½s family emigrated to Kentucky , and has since led a pious, useful life. During his two weeks stay near the tramping ground of his early boyhood days, he has met and mingled with many of his old playmates, although many have scattered to different parts of the United States, while many others have passed the gates eternal, where reunions never break up and fellowship has no end.\n\n(Rev. William Millard Barker was the son of the Rev. Sherwood Millard Barker, Jr. who was the son of Rev. Joseph Gaddy Barker, Sr.)\n\n***\n\nColonial Barker family history:\n\nJohn Barker, Sr. and his family seem to have been settled in Henry County, VA before migrating as a family to Washington County, VA. I have no definite information on them in Henry County before 1778 but it appears that they all sold their land in Henry County and resettled in Washington County at about the same time. Some members of the Bays family, related to the Barkers, also moved from Henry County to Washington County at about the same time. Since the time of all these recorded events, the given names, and known related families all seem to correspond, the idea that the Barkers were settled in Henry County before moving to Washington County seems to be established. I list the information I have chronologically and admit my understanding of our early family history is limited at this time. Several other cousins are working on this and more information should become available in the future.\n\nTax Lists of Henry County, Virginia by Lela C. Adams:\n\np. 9 1778 Barker, John - Dbl tax\n\n*\n\nA double tax in Henry County at that time indicates that John Barker, Sr. refused an oath of loyalty to the State of Virginia. He apparently was still loyal to England even though his son, Thomas O. Barker, was probably a Revolutionary War Continental soldier at the time and his other sons were not double taxed. They apparently had already taken the oath and were against Bristish rule. This picture of our early family history is sketchy at best but perhaps this is the first known Barker family \"generation gap\". And, as we shall see in other generations, we are not the first in the family to live in challenging and confusing times. Regardless, John Barker, Sr. seems to have taken the oath before \"tax season\" the next year.\n\nBarker, John\n\nBarker, Joseph\n\nBarker, Charles\n\nBarker, Michael\n\nBays, Peter, Sr.- Dbl tax\n\nBays, Peter, Jr. - Dbl tax\n\nSneed, John\n\np.21 1779 Barker, John\n\nBarker, John\n\nBarker, Michael\n\nBays, Peter, Sr.-Treble tax\n\nSneed, John\n\np. 1780 1780 Barker, John (Smith's River) John Jr. seems to have land on Smith's River whereas John, Sr. bought on land on Spoon Creek (now in Patrick County).\n\nBarker, John\n\nBarker, Michael\n\nBays, Peter\n\nBays, Peter, Jr.\n\nSneed, John\n\n*\n\nHistory of Patrick and Henry Counties Virginia by Virginia G. and Lewis G.
