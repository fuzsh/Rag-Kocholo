        "text": "William Alexander, 1st earl of Stirling (born c. 1576, Menstrie, Clackmannan, Scot.—died Feb. 12, 1640, London, Eng.) was a Scottish courtier, statesman, and poet who founded and colonized the region of Nova Scotia in Canada.\n\nWhen King James VI of Scotland ascended the English throne as James I in 1603, Alexander attended his court in London. He there wrote, in 1604, his best-known work, Aurora, a sonnet sequence that outlived his subsequent didactic tragedies. In 1608 Stirling became agent, in partnership with his cousin, for collecting debts owed to the crown in Scotland during the period 1547–88, retaining a 50 percent reward. He was knighted that same year. His last important poetical work, Doomes-day, or, The Great Day of the Lords Judgement (1614), caused King James to choose him to collaborate in translating the Psalms.\n\nAlexander’s career advanced within the Scottish realm, and he became determined to bring Scotland into colonial affairs. In 1621 he obtained a grant of northwestern Newfoundland. He abandoned that territory the same year, however, and was given a much larger tract north of the Sainte-Croix River. He thus became the proprietor of New Scotland (Nova Scotia), despite rival French claims to part of the territory. Although exploratory parties set out in 1622 and 1623, the first settlement was not established until 1629.\n\nIn 1625 the charter of 1621 was renewed, but despite expensive and sincere efforts, including an offer of hereditary baronetcies to Scotsmen who established six or more settlers, by 1626 Alexander had failed to colonize the region, and there were only 28 baronets (the total reached 85 by 1631).\n\nThe French challenged Scottish rights to Nova Scotia in 1627, and war broke out. Alexander’s son led reinforcements to Nova Scotia in 1629. By the Treaty of Susa that year, however, England and France agreed to a mutual restoration of territory and shipping, and Alexander was compelled to surrender Nova Scotia. The Scottish settlers were ordered to withdraw in 1631, leaving Alexander deeply in debt.\n\nIn 1630 he was created Viscount of Stirling and Lord Alexander of Tullibody and in 1633 the Earl of Stirling, Viscount of Canada, and (again) Lord Alexander of Tullibody."
