There is no document or source provided to prove this John Barker's father.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Children\n\n2 Research Notes\n\n3 Sources\n\n4 Acknowledgements\n\nBiography\n\nJohn Barker Sr. was a Virginia colonist.\n\nAccording to descendants, John Barker was born about 1621 in England.[citation needed]\n\nJohn was considered to be a master mariner by some descendants, and touted to have been the Mr. John Barker, master of the ship Abraham of London that he sailed to Virginia on the 17th of October 1635. In 1635, this John Barker would have been age 14 if he was born in 1621, and even if he was born in 1610, as some suggest, he could not have been a master of a ship. A master mariner is, and was, a licensed mariner who holds the highest grade of seafarer qualification. In England an apprenticeship of at least seven years would have been required to obtain the role of a ships mate as proven by the deposition of William Barker, mariner, who in 1629 was recorded as Mate of the Hopewell. [1] Two land documents in 1653 and 1673 recorded he was a Planter.\n\nMap of Chipoakes, counties of Surry and James City\n\nAccording to Cavaliers and Pioneers on the 29th of November 1649, John Barker received a patent for 300 acres of land in James City County lying at the very head of the main branch of Lower Chipoaks Creek for the transportation of six persons into the Colony including Eliza Blacker, John Carver, Elizabeth Collins, and John Musgrove.[2] The original grant recorded the land bounded upon the land of Master Dunston as well as William Carter, one of the transported persons was Eliza. Blacke not Blacker, and payment is to be made seven years after this date, 29th of November 1649.[3] In 1652, Surry County was formed from portions of James City County.\n\nThe family was documented living on Chipoakes creek in 1653. It appears that a lease was entered into between Jane Bland, late wife of Edward Bland, before his demise, and John Barker. At a court held on the 9th of January 1653, an Indenture was presented and recorded between Theodorick Bland, merchant, and John Barker, planter, stating:\n\nthat the said Theo. Bland in the name of John Bland, by letter of Att. from Theo. Bland to John Barker, and that John Bland & Co. at the plantation at Chippoaks Creek according to a patent in the name of Mrs. Jane Bland, wife of the aforesaid Edward Bland, deceased, dated 9 May 1652, same to John Barker, for 10,000 weight of tobacco, one-half on claim and one-half on 10 of Nov. next, and on the 22nd of March 1653,\n\nAlso recorded on that date was: John Holmswood, Atty. of Mr. Theodorick Bland, assigned to John Barker all his patent rights ect.[4] At a court held on the 23rd of March 1653, John Barker obliged himself to give full license to Mr. Theoderick Bland to have two acres of his dividend of land in exchange for the convenience of a house to him or his assignees.[5] On the 9th day of May 1652, Jane Bland, wife of Edward Bland, Dec'd. was granted 4,300 acres of land in James City County lying near the head of Upper Chipoaks Creek with the remainder on the South side of James River, a mile or thereabouts from the head of Upper Chipoaks.[6] These documents indicate that, at that time, John Bland & Co. as well as John Barker resided at the plantation at Chipoaks creek.\n\nBy 1660, John had removed from the plantation on Lower Chipoakes to upper Chipoakes creek. The list of Tythables in Southwarke pish [parish] in 1660 recorded two entries for Mr. John Barker:\n\nline 1 - Mr. John Barker - - 06\n\nline 28 - Mr Barkers plantation - 01\n\nline 29 - Ben: Harrison - - 05[7]\n\nIn 1668 Mr. John Barker was taxed for six tithables, and Mr. Barker's planation was taxed for one tithable in the list of Tythables in South Warke pish [parish] from Coll. Jordans upwards.[8]\n\nHis first wife had passed away by 1673. A deed was recorded in Surry County on the 2nd day of September 1673 by John Barker Senior of the parish of Sourthwark, County of Surry and Anne his wife, the late wife of Geo. Marshall, granting land to John Barker the younger of Southwark containing 75 acres lying in Martins Brandon in Charles City County that Geo. Marshall had bequeathed to Anne.[9] Jno. Bark Junr acknowledged later that whereas Mrs. Ann Barker mother-in-law to me did convey the land in Martins Brandon said deed is null and void at a court held the 3rd of March 1673.[9]\n\nIn a Surry County court case, West vs Barker, it was found that John Barker, Sr. also had a son, Joshua, who was sent to New England from the 22nd of May 1673 to the 8br [October] 1674, and sold to Mr. Sm'l Shrimpton a sundry of items for which the accounts of Mr. Richard West [a New England merchant] showed that John Barker owed Richard West 7 pounds, 10 shillings, and 6 pence.[10] The debits to John Barkers account were for the sale of \"Hamckcoes, Caskes of Hinkinge porke, bartt befe & hho [hundred] of wool and West.\" Charges for Joshua Barker included:\n\nJoshua Barkers passage to New England & clothing & other necessaries - 6:19:06\n\nhis diet washing & lodging from the 22th May 1673 until ye last 8br 1674 - 11:00:00\n\nOn the 10th day of Aug 1678, John Barker Senr. of Martin Brandon in Charles City County, planter, sold , with the consent of Ann his wife, 1800 acres of land in Surry County above the head of upper Chipoakes creek where he formerly lived being patent granted to him on the 18th day of December 1662.[11] The entry also noted: \"On the backside a patent of 1800 acres of land grant to Jno Barker bearing date ye 18th day of March 1662 was written...14th day of Aug 1678 signed Jno Barker and Ann Barker in presence of Elias Osborne, Jethro Barker, Samuel Nevell.\"\n\nAlthough author, John Bennet Boddie, attributes information for one John Barker involved in Bacon's Rebellion to this John Barker's son. Given the age of his son, the amount of the judgement, and the death of the other Capt. John Barker in 1673, it appears that information applies to John Barker, Sr. According to Southside Virginia Families. Volume 2,\n\n\"It appears that Thomas Busby and John Barker were among the \"Rebels\" who took possession of \"Bacon's Castle\" (Arthur Allen's home) during the Rebellion, for \"Bacon's Lieutenant, Thomas Busby, at whose house no guard was found during the critical days of Mid-September, along with a number of Bacon's men (among whom was John Barker) agreed to pay Arthur Allen damages, Nov. 16, 1677.\"[12]\n\nJohn Barker agreed to pay damages of \"four hundred & forty pds\" to Arthur Allen at a court held November 1677.[13] Arthur Allen inherited his father's estate that included the large brick house, \"Bacon's Castle,\" and about 500 acres between Lawne's and Chippoakes Creeks in Surry County. During Bacon's Rebellion, Allen's plantation was seized and occupied for nearly four months by a rebel garrison under the command of Robert Burgess.[14]\n\nJohn Barker died between the 10th of August 1678 (land conveyance) and the 4th of April 1679 (Jethrow Barker's complaint,) rather than in 1673 as some descendants' claim. At a Charles City County court held the 4th of April 1679, \"Jethrow\" Barker, orphan, complains of abuse by his mother-in-law (step-mother) & prays that he may choose his guardian, he being of age to do so. He chooses Wm. Sanders which was approved.[15] At age 14 an orphan could choose their guardian which suggests Jethro was at least age 14 in 1679.\n\nAt a court at Westover on the 5th of Jan 1690, a judgment was granted to Joel Barker against Jno. Good of Martins Brandon Parish for 8,000 lbs of tobo., due from Good to Barker by will of Jno. Barker, dec'd, father of said Joel, Good having intermarried with Adm'x of dec'd. It is ordered that on receipt of tobacco, said Joel and Jethroe Barker sign a discharge therefore.[16]\n\nChildren\n\nJoshua Barker ( born - died before 1679)\n\nJohn Barker, Jr.\n\nJoel Barker\n\nJethro Barker\n\nResearch Notes\n\nIt is not documented if this John Barker was born in England, or when he arrived in Virginia. Also, his children were perhaps born in Virginia, rather than England, given the fact he received a land patent in 1649. Virginia Immigrants, 1623-1666 recorded two John Barker's transported into the Colony of Virginia who could have been the John who was granted land in 1649:\n\nBarker, Jon., 1637, by Thomas Causey, Charles City Co.\n\nBarker, John, 1639, by William Dooi, James City.[17]\n\nCavaliers and Pioneers also recorded:\n\nJohn Barker transported by Capt. William Epes, Accomack, 1626\n\nJon. Barker transported by Capt. Francis Eppes, Charles Citty County, 1637\n\nJohn Barker transported by Thomas Ludwell, Gent, James City County, 1648[18]\n\nEvidence of an elder John Barker:\n\nJohn Barker, Jr received a land patent on the 15th of October 1657 in Surry County on the West side of James River about 7 or 8 miles from the head of upper Chipoakes Cr. for transportation of 12 persons.[19] Given the fact that this John Barker's son, John Barker, Jr. was not born until about 1652, there appears to have been an elder John Barker in the same area.\n\nIn 1665 Capt. John Barker was recorded as one of the County Commissioners or Justices of the Peace of Charles City County, Virginia.[20] Since the John Barker, Sr, subject of this profile, was not documented in Charles City County until 1673, this also indicates there was another John Barker who would have been the Capt. John Barker.\n\nThe Charles City County Court Orders for April Court 1672/3 prove that the Capt. John Barker had died:\n\nWhereas Robert Lucy and Sarah his wife and Phillip Limbrey and Elizabeth his wife jointly own 1000 acres in Flower du hundred, inherited from John Barker decd, brother to sd Sarah and Elizabeth, desire partition. Request that Col Robt Wynne for the Lucys and Lt. Col Geo Jordan for the Limbreys meet James Minge surveyor on the 22nd instant and divide the land.[21]\n\nThat Mr/Capt. John Barker was the son of William Barker the Mariner in the records of Charles City County, and owned land and lived at \"fflower d hundred\" when William died in 1661/62.[22]\n\nAccording to William Barker's profile, born about 1591, William's son John was born about 1621. William had a younger brother, John, who were both apprenticed to the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights when each reached the age of 12 for 7 years. \"William was master and captain of the ships AMERICA and YE MERCHANTS HOPE. He was the founder of the company, William Barker & Associates. William's brother, John, was shipmaster of the ABRAHAM in 1635. (John would be his half-brother.)\" His brother, John, would have been born between 1591 and 1604 when their father died. That John perhaps had a son, John. Further research is needed on that John Barker.\n\nDocumentation has proven inaccuracies in the following excerpt by descendant:\n\n- excerpt from The Barkers of Virginia\n\nJohn Barker, an English sea captain, settled on Chippokee Creek, then in James City County, Virginia, later in Southwark Parish, Surry County, apparently about 1649, Where he lived until 1678 when he moved to Martin's Brandon, Charles City County, where he died in 1689. His first wife, thought to have been named Letitia, was the mother of his three sons - John Jr., Joel and Jethro - all apparently born in England, and lived in Surry County, Virginia.\n\nJohn Barker, \"Master of the good ship Abraham set sail from London with 51 passengers aboard\", 20 November, 1635. (Hotten - 138). John Barker patented 300 acres \"on the very head of the main branch of Lower Chippokee Creek\", 29 November, 1649, for transporting six settlers to Virginia. (Cavaliers and Pioneers - Nugent - 187). Due to the destruction of the early James City records, nothing more is known of John until the creation of Surry County, on the south side of the James River, from and across from James City, 1652.\n\nJohn added to his holdings on Chippokee Creek when he bought a \"plantation\" thereon from Theoderick Bland of John Bland and Co., 9 January, 1653 for 10,000 pounds of tobacco. (Southside Virginia Families, Boddie, 30). He later patented 1800 acres on Chippokee, 18 December, 1662, whereon he had his home until 10 August, 1678, when he sold this land to Benjamin Harrison for 16,000 pounds of tobacco and moved to Martin's Brandon, Charles City County.\n\nJohn married his second wife, Ann, widow of George Marshall of Martin's Brandon, between 9 March, 1672, when Marshall's will was probated in Charles City, and 2 September, 1673 when \"John Barker Sen.\" and wife Ann, deeded 75 acres on Chippokee Creek to \"John Barker the Younger\" (Surry Deeds 1671-1684, 32). This deed recites that Ann was Marshall's widow, whom John had married, and the two were residents of Southwark Parish and that the land had been bequeathed to Ann by Marshall.\n\nOn 3 March, 1674, \"John Barker Jun.\" reconveyed the 75 acres to John Barker Sr., in the latter's sale name - not to John and Ann as Boddie says. In this deed John Jr. referred to \"Mrs Ann Barker, Mother in law to me\", (stepmother)\n\nJohn Barker died in Martin's Brandon leaving a will in Charles City County which was destroyed with all others of the time.\n\nThis profile is a collaborative work-in-progress.
