        "text": "Today marks my dad’s birthday. If he was still alive he’d be 105, an unlikely, but not inconceivable possibility. As it was, he died at the age of 70 in 1989.\n\nI remember two years earlier taking him out for his birthday to Ed Hum’s hiTops (Hi-Tops) Restaurant, the first Chinese restaurant I ever took him to. A 20-foot by six-foot neon sign landmark blazed out from the front of what was Peterborough’s longest-running and most popular Chinese restaurant on George Street, since opening in 1956.\n\nMy dad said he enjoyed his meal but wondered if the restaurant had paid its electric bill because he found the lighting pretty dim in the dining room. That was my dad. He was always a good sport about wherever I would take him for dinner when I worked at the Peterborough Examiner. The Cody Inn in Buckhorn. Chemong Lodge in Bridgenorth. Ponderosa Steakhouse in Peterborough. Or takeout from Dixie Lee Fried Chicken down the street from his place in Bridgenorth. All equally fine.\n\nWe celebrated his last birthday – exactly a month before he died – at the Ponderosa Steakhouse on Chemong Road in Peterborough.\n\nWilliam Marshall Barker was born on July 13, 1919. He was called “Bill” by everyone who knew him (aside perhaps from my mother, Pat, who called him “William” on rare occasions, which never failed to get his attention), and my Uncle Bob Barker in Indiana, who always called him “Will.”\n\nHe was a convert to Catholicism from the United Church of Canada. When he married my mom, Mary Ellen Patricia Maclean, from Youghal, Ireland, on June 18, 1942 in the rectory of St. Gregory the Great Parish church on Simcoe Street North in Oshawa, Ontario, the wedding took place in the rectory rather than the main church because “mixed marriages,” as they were quaintly called in 1942, were still rather uncommon and somewhat frowned upon by both Protestants and Catholics. As well as his Roman Catholic rosary, I still have my dad’s 1927 United Church certificate for perfect Sunday school attendance, and another certificate he received from King Street United Church of Canada in Oshawa for perfect Sunday attendance (52 weeks a year) for seven consecutive years for “public worship service in the Church” between April 1926 and March 1932 when he was between six and 11 and was a member of the “League of Young Worshippers.”\n\nEventually my dad converted to Catholicism, perhaps a decade or so after marrying my mom and my parents adopting me in 1957. My mom often joked that my dad was a “better” Catholic than her, a “cradle” Catholic. He served for many years as an usher at St. Gregory’s. My dad was an usher in an era when finding people coming to mass a spot in a pew to sit was as important as taking up the offertory collection. The ushers always wore a jacket and tie, with an “usher” lapel pin. They had what seemed to me back then a complex series of hand signals surrounding the often difficult to find seating for mass; signals that would make a Major League Baseball catcher proud. And when the ushers flashed those rapid-fire hand signals, the communication seemed, if not quite a command, then still more of a direction than a suggestion.\n\nMy dad was the finest man I’ve ever known. His word was his bond. I never knew him to tell an untruth, which is simply remarkable. He never equivocated. He was always straight forward, meaning what he said and saying what he meant.\n\nHe worked at General Motors of Canada in Oshawa, his hometown, as an hourly-rated employee for 32½ years before retiring in 1975. He was a proud rank-and-file trade unionist, a member of Local 222 of the old United Autoworkers of America (UAW).\n\nThe men in my Nipigon Street neighbourhood – guys like Earl Kirkpatrick, Snow Willson and my dad – were often working six days a week, with overtime on Saturdays when they were on day shift. If they were on nights, they’d be busy flooding the Nipigon Park outdoor rink at 2:30 a.m. – after their eight-hour night shift ended and they went to bed – so us kids could skate the next day. That’s how I remember my dad.\n\nI spent the first of five summers as a university student, beginning in 1976, working in the same West Plant in the high-seniority Completely Knocked Down (CKD) department my dad had retired from the year before. Some of his buddies were still there; some I had heard about for years and met for the first time.\n\nMy first job was hammering large wooden crates together. It was just an amazing cavernous building that was the old West Plant with great big windows and wooden floors. I remember once going across the tunnel (or bridge, I’m not sure now how it was referred to) connecting the West Plant and the North Plant over Division Street. Later that summer, I hung rads in the rad room of the old North Plant across the street.\n\nThere are other memories, of course, which I haven’t quite got around to writing about yet. Like how he used to take me tobogganing in the winter at the Oshawa Golf Course. Or before I had a driver’s licence, picking me up after the third period of Oshawa Generals games, where I sold pop and hotdogs when I was 14 and 15 at the old Oshawa Civic Auditorium. That’s where the two of us would go together many winter Friday nights to cheer on our hometown Junior B Oshawa Crushmen, especially our neighbour, Scott Willson.\n\nWhile my parents came a bit late to the appeal of pizza, I do recall my dad heading out on the occasional Friday night when some of my Nipigon Street friends, perhaps Mike Byrne and Paul Sobanski, were over, and dad coming back with a box of Mothers Pizza from Simcoe North, the first and only Mothers in Oshawa at the time.\n\nBefore that, and well into the 1970s anyway, my dad still picked up fish-and-chip dinners for us on Fridays after work, first at Paul and Helen Plishka’s Rose Bowl Fish and Chips at the corner of Bond and Prince streets, and later Pat and Mike Volpe‘s Pat & Mike Fish & Chips on Hortop Street, as well as from the H. Salt, Esq. Authentic English Fish and Chips franchise on Simcoe Street North in Oshawa, where we also enjoyed their fish and chips. Haddon Salt had operated his fish and chips store in Skegness, in the northeastern corner of England, before moving to the United States and, along with his wife, Grace, opening their first shop in Sausalito, California, under the name of Salt’s Fish & Chips in 1965. Pope Paul VI’s proclamation of Paenitemini (Apostolic Constitution On Penance) on Feb. 17, 1966, allowed episcopal conferences to permit Catholics in their jurisdictions to substitute some other penitential practice aside from abstaining from meat on Fridays, a practice which had been in force in the universal church since Pope Saint Nicholas 1, also known as Saint Nicholas the Great, in 851, so dad was in no hurry to abandon eating fish on Fridays, especially Halibut. I was nine years old, growing up in Oshawa, Ontario, when all this came to pass in 1966.\n\nInstead of going to Inco or Vale and down into a mine or working at the surface in a refinery or smelter like many men in Thompson, the men (and they were invariably men back then) I knew in the 1960s carried their metal lunch pails into the factory at General Motors to build cars and trucks. When they were leaving at the end of their shift, they punched the same clock they had coming in. Every time I hear Men of the Deeps sing Rise Again or Working Man, my union resolve deepens just a little bit more.\n\nIn the fall of 1970, he walked the picket line for 3½ months in the longest strike against his employer since the Dirty Thirties.\n\nWhile he wasn’t much fond of politicians of any stripe collectively, he did have a bit of a liking individually for Mike Starr, Oshawa-Whitby riding Progressive Conservative MP, and a federal labour minister in the Diefenbaker government for a time in the 1960s, but was truly fond of the man who defeated Starr by 15 votes in the June 1968 federal election, future NDP leader Ed Broadbent, who in his youth had been my parent’s paperboy for a time, delivering the Oshawa Times to the south-side of their rented Church Street red Insulbrick duplex, my first home.\n\nTruth be told, my dad liked Ed, who died at the age of 87 on Jan. 11, not so much because of his NDP affiliation, although as a trade unionist that carried weight, but mainly because he saw him as a hardworking, honest politician; a kindred spirit, although my dad would have put it more plainly than that.\n\nMy dad had a Grade 8 education and wasn’t much for reading. I don’t think I ever saw him read a book, other than maybe to consult the odd one for some factual information. His idea of leisure was to work with his hands at carpentry or upholstery, and he built me, the reader, several fine custom-size wooden bookcases, with a larger than normal shelf sometimes for oversized books.\n\nMy non-book reading father, however, made time every day to read the local daily newspaper, and from 1983, when I began working as a newspaper reporter, until his death in 1989, quite likely read every newspaper story I wrote during that six-year period, and, as I learned only after he died, would often point out my byline in the Peterborough Examiner to shopkeepers and acquaintances in Bridgenorth, a small community just outside of Peterborough on Chemong Lake, where he lived from 1980 to 1989.\n\nThat man, an ordinary man by the measures of the world, yet an extraordinary man of character by any measure, was my father.\n\nYou can also follow me on X (formerly Twitter) at: https://twitter.com/jwbarker22\n\n55.738368 -97.858355\n\nI s today’s partial 38 per cent solar eclipse over Thompson, Manitoba, under clear blue skies and balmy 16°C temperatures (the normal April 8 daytime high is 4°C), a sign of a premillennial Rapture signalling the beginning of the End of Days, as today’s total eclipse crosses two towns in the United States named Nineveh in Ohio and Indiana, as well as Rapture, Indiana? The original Nineveh, the oldest and most-populous city of the ancient Assyrian empire, is situated on the east bank of the Tigris River and encircled by the modern city of Mosul, Iraq. Interestingly, today’s solar eclipse is not visible in Mosul.\n\nNot being either a scholar of eschatology or astronomy, I probably wouldn’t even be contemplating such a question about the April 8 solar eclipse if it hadn’t been for my old Left Coast friend Ron Graham posting on Facebook today, “To those religious nutcases that believed the upcoming solar eclipse would be ‘the rapture’, be sure to check in with us on Tuesday. It quite possibly did happen for some, but appears that Jesus overlooked you and your friends for some reason.”\n\nWhile it is true that Christian scripture records that Jesus preaching on the Mount of Olives, a mountain ridge in East Jerusalem, east of and adjacent to Jerusalem’s Old City – in what is called the Olivet Discourse, found in Matthew 24 – talks about the end times and says the sun will be darkened, belief in apocalyptic happenings portended by solar eclipses are not proprietary to Christianity. Throughout history, eclipses have been interpreted by many cultures and religions as a disruption of the natural order.\n\nHindu beliefs involve demons swallowing the sun. In ancient China, the etchings discovered in Anyang depicted solar eclipses as celestial dragons attacking and devouring the sun. In South America, ancient Incans believed solar eclipses were a “sign of wrath and displeasure” from Inti, the “all-powerful sun god.” Choctaw Indians from the Southeastern Woodlands of the United States believe a mischievous black squirrel gnawing on the sun causes solar eclipses, and legend holds the squirrel must be frightened away by the clamor and yells of the event’s human witnesses. In West Africa, the Tammari people, also known as Batammariba from the northern regions of Togo and Benin, believe the celestial bodies intersecting during an eclipse represent human feuds on Earth.\n\nWell I hear you went up to Saratoga\n\nAnd your horse naturally won\n\nThen you flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia\n\nTo see the total eclipse of the sun\n\nI have always loved Carly Simon’s 1972 song “You’re So Vain.” In the early 1980s, many of us thought the song was about singer James Taylor, who was married to Carly Simon from 1972 to 1983. But in a 1983 interview with the Washington Post, Simon said, “”It certainly sounds like it was about Warren Beatty, He certainly thought it was about him – he called me and said ‘thanks for the song. ‘” Later, she said two other men, who so far remain unidentified, along with Beatty, also inspired elements of the song. So who knows?\n\nAs I said, I am neither a scholar of eschatology or astronomy, so perhaps it is not surprising my interest in solar eclipses is anchored elsewhere.\n\nIn the 1980s, I spent a too short part of many a summer at the Dell family’s summer home on the Atlantic Ocean in Oak Bluffs on Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, where my mother-in-law, Carol Dell, a Vineyarder by both birth and disposition, would tell me stories of Carly Simon and James Taylor, who were also both in many ways Vineyarders themselves. Stories about Island events such as live performances at the Hot Tin Roof, opened in 1979 by Carly Simon, George Brush and Herb Putnam. Close your eyes, and you were transported back a few years in time and were there, so it seemed. Magical. The full lyrics to “You’re So Vain” go like this:\n\nSon of a gun\n\nYou walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht\n\nYour hat strategically dipped below one eye\n\nYour scarf it was apricot\n\nYou had one eye in the mirror, as you watched yourself gavotte\n\nAnd all the girls dreamed that they’d be your partner\n\nThey’d be your partner and\n\nYou’re so vain\n\nYou probably think this song is about you\n\nYou’re so vain (you’re so vain)\n\nI bet you think this song is about you\n\nDon’t you, don’t you?\n\nYou had me several years ago when I was still quite naive\n\nWell you said that we made such a pretty pair and that you would never leave\n\nBut you gave away the things you loved\n\nAnd one of them was me\n\nI had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee, clouds in my coffee and\n\nYou’re so vain\n\nYou probably think this song is about you\n\nYou’re so vain, you’re so vain\n\nI bet you think this song is about you\n\nDon’t you don’t you, don’t you?\n\nI had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee, clouds in my coffee and\n\nYou’re so vain\n\nYou probably think this song is about you\n\nYou’re so vain (you’re so vain)\n\nI bet you think this song is about you\n\nDon’t you don’t you\n\nWell I hear you went up to Saratoga\n\nAnd your horse naturally won\n\nThen you flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia\n\nTo see the total eclipse of the sun\n\nWell you’re where you should be all the time\n\nAnd when you’re not, you’re with some underworld spy\n\nOr the wife of a close friend, wife of a close friend and\n\nYou’re so vain\n\nYou probably think this song is about you\n\nYou’re so vain (so vain)\n\nI bet you think this song is about you\n\nDon’t you don’t you, don’t you, don’t you now\n\nYou’re so vain\n\nYou probably think this song is about you\n\nYou’re so vain\n\nProbably think this song about you\n\nYou’re so vain\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGQ2DJ65-ok&t=6s\n\nYou can also follow me on X (formerly Twitter) at: https://twitter.com/jwbarker22\n\n55.738368 -97.858355\n\nFour very long years, indeed.\n\nNow, make mine, a “sinful servant” of the Church Militant on Earth, a Smoking Bishop, a mulled wine wassail, this festive season at university and church potlucks. Even an eggnog will do. O come, O come, O Sapientia (O Wisdom); O Adonai (O Ruler of the House of Israel); O Radix Jesse (O Root of Jesse); O Clavis David (O Key of David); O Oriens (O Rising Dawn); O Rex Gentium (O King of the Nations); and O Emmanuel (O God With Us).\n\nWe now work and socialize for the most part without masks. But the sensible among us (apparently not a particularly large cohort, with only about 15.4 per cent of Manitobans, as a cumulative percentage of the population, vaccinated as recommended by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), an external advisory body that provides the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) with independent, ongoing and timely medical, scientific, and public health advice in response to questions from PHAC relating to immunization) still get our latest COVID-19 updated vaccinations. I had my seventh shot on Oct. 25. A couple of days later, I learned of the new COVID-19 subvariant HV.1. Hard to know these days exactly how many new COVID-19 infections the new subvariant is responsible for, but a reasonable guess is at least somewhere between 30 and 50 per cent – and soon, if not already, probably the majority of new COVID-19 infections in Canada.\n\nTake heart though. The Justinian Plague erupted in the Egyptian port city of Pelusium in the summer of 541 AD and went through 18 waves until 750 AD.\n\nPandemics kind of fade away, they don’t really end. And even the fade-away is far from a straight-line exit back from a pandemic world to a pandemic-free world. COVID-19 is here to stay for the foreseeable future, manufacturing new subvariants along the way. We have been fortunate so far that while many of the subvariants that have emerged over the last four years have been more contagious than their predecessors, they have not been more deadly. There is no guarantee that pattern will continue.\n\n“The world has emerged from the COVID pandemic, but it’s still under its tremendous impacts. The global economy is recovering, but its momentum remains sluggish. Industrial and supply chains are still under the threat of interruption,” U.S. President Joe Biden told President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China Nov. 15 before their bilateral meeting in Woodside, California.\n\nBiden has it about right.\n\nWhile COVID-19 is still a global pandemic, it is no longer a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an extraordinary event, which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other countries through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a co-ordinated international response After a five hour meeting in Geneva – its 15th regarding COVID-19 – the WHO’s International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) Emergency Committee recommended on May 4 “that it is time to transition to long-term management of the COVID-19 pandemic” and advised “the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic … is now an established and ongoing health issue which no longer constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu, who has the final say, concurred with the committee.\n\n“While we’re not in the crisis mode, we can’t let our guard down,” said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s Covid-19 technical lead and head of its program on emerging diseases. She added that the disease and the coronavirus that causes it are “here to stay.”\n\nThe COVID-19 worldwide death toll as of Dec. 6 stood at 6,985,964 deaths, the WHO reports. The United States had seen 1,144,877 COVID-19 deaths by Dec. 6, and in Canada the number is around 53,000 deaths.\n\nOn May 11, the United States ended its own federal public health emergency declaration, which dated back to Jan. 31, 2020.\n\nThe National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI) at Fort Detrick, Maryland warned as far back as November 2019 that a contagion was sweeping through China’s Wuhan region, changing the patterns of life and business and posing a threat to the population. The report was the result of analysis of wire and computer intercepts, coupled with satellite images. The medical intelligence (MEDINT) cell within Canadian Forces Intelligence Command (CFINTCOM) gave a similar warning in January 2020.\n\nThe the most chilling thing that I’ve heard to date during the COVID-19 pandemic, was this audio clip posted on Twitter March 21, 2020. I heard this brief 30-second clip on Twitter March 24, 2020, the day after the “surge” hit New York City. Tim Mak is National Public Radio (NPR’s) Washington investigative correspondent – and an emergency medical technician (EMT), which is how he got the message. Aside from the subject matter, there is something eerie about that electronically-generated voice on the automated message that went out, with this message:\n\n“This an emergency message. This is a priority request for D.C. MRC volunteers (District of Columbia (DC) Medical Reserve Corps (DC MRC)…” (https://twitter.com/i/status/1241471610395267084)\n\nThe District of Columbia (DC) Medical Reserve Corps (DC MRC) supports the DC Department of Health (DC Health) in its role as lead for public health and medical emergency preparedness, response and recovery by recruiting, training, and deploying medical and non-medical volunteers to assist with planned events and emergencies.\n\nIt was ProMED (Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases)-mail, a program operated by the Boston-based International Society for Infectious Diseases, which served as the early warning disease surveillance network that alerted the world to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in an alert issued one minute before midnight China Standard Time (CST) on Dec. 30, 2019.\n\nWhat does living in a world where the COVID-19 pandemic continues but is no longer considered by the WHO as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern look like?\n\nDifferent than the world up to 2020, but also closer to that not-so-long-ago world than we were for most of 2020, 2021 and 2022. I’ve been to two in-person meetings so far this week; that would have been questionable and unlikely last year, and unthinkable and probably illegal in many places in 2020 and 2021.\n\nLast Saturday, we were out at “A Community Christmas Evening,” sponsored by the Thompson Seniors Resource Council, and formerly known as the Old Fashioned Christmas Concert. It was my first visit inside the Letkemann Theatre at R.D. Parker Collegiate since before the pandemic in 2019. Two weeks earlier, we were out at the Thompson Kin Club Fall Harvest Party dinner.\n\nSo far more socializing, mask-free and fully vaccinated (epidemiologists really must shake their heads at human behaviour, I know), than at any point since the fall of 2019. All, of course, with an eye turned to my Facebook page, where I can read friends daily posts about getting COVID-19 recently for either the first or umpteenth time, depending, on what their … what … luck has been?\n\nThat’s the kind of fall and festive season it has been here in Thompson, Manitoba in 2023. Lots of public socializing, vaxxed but unmasked, with one eye on the ever-spinning COVID-19 roulette wheel never too far in the background.\n\nIt it is in that spirit we offer you this recipe for a Smoking Bishop, courtesy of Cedric Dickens, a great-grandson of Charles Dickens, published in his 1988 book, Drinking with Dickens:\n\n“A merry Christmas, Bob!” said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. “A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you, for many a year! I’ll raise your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of Smoking Bishop, Bob!”\n\nSmoking Bishop\n\n6 Clementines\n\n1/2 C sugar\n\n30 cloves\n\n8 C moderately sweet red wine\n\n1 bottle ruby port\n\nBake the oranges in a medium oven for about 20 minutes. Stick cloves into the oranges and then put them into a large bowl. Pour the wine over them and add the sugar. Cover and leave in a warm place for 24 hours. Squeeze the juice from the oranges and mix it with the wine. Add the port and heat the mixture in a pan. Do not boil. Serve hot.\n\nYou can also follow me on X (formerly Twitter) at: https://twitter.com/jwbarker22\n\n55.749739 -97.866462\n\nSixty years ago today – Nov. 22, 1963 – United States President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, America’s youngest president, was assassinated in Dallas.\n\nAs Kennedy’s presidential limousine, a modified 1961 Lincoln Continental four-door convertible, turned off Main Street at Dealey Plaza around 12:30 p.m. Central Standard Time, three shots rang out as the motorcade passed the Texas School Book Depository. If you were born in 1957 or earlier, you likely have a highly detailed and exceptionally vivid flashbulb memory snapshot of that moment and where you were and what you were doing. I was in my Grade 1 class in Oshawa, Ontario here in Canada at St. Christopher Separate Elementary School on Annapolis Avenue that day.\n\nSecret Service Agent William Greer, 54, the limousine driver, sped to Parkland Hospital where Father Oscar Huber, a 70-year-old Vincentian priest from Holy Trinity Catholic Church, who had been watching the presidential motorcade, having walked the three blocks, arrived to administer the sacrament of last rites (extreme unction) to the mortally wounded 46-year-old president.\n\nAs Olivia B. Waxman, a staff writer at TIME, noted in a story yesterday: “Sixty years after the JFK assassination, it’s still unclear why Oswald shot the president, fueling countless conspiracies … The continued fascination over who killed JFK and why helps provide context for the conspiracy theories that continue to dominate American politics today.”\n\nWhile conspiracy theories about Charles Harrelson, actor Woody Harrelson’s father, being one of the “three tramps” on the grassy knoll – a second shooter in Dallas – along with two other shadowy figures, Charles Rogers and Chauncey Holt, continue to have some currency, it appears the boxcar tramps actually were Gus Abrams, Harold Doyle and John Gedney, and that Lee Harvey Oswald, as the Warren Commission concluded, acted alone. Harrelson, however, was later convicted of the assassination of U.S. federal district court Judge “Maximum John” H. Wood, Jr., shot dead in the parking lot outside his San Antonio, Texas townhouse on May 29, 1979. Harrelson, 69, died March 15, 2007, incarcerated at Supermax, the United States’ most secure federal penitentiary in Florence, Colorado.\n\nSteve Gillon, host of the new History Channel podcast 24 Hours After: The JFK Assassination, says the assassination of JFK is the only time when the nuclear codes were temporarily lost.\n\n“The president always has a military aide who carries an attache with all the nuclear codes,” he says. “He was in a backup car, and in all the chaos of rushing to the airport, the aide got lost. The codes were soon reunited with the president, but I think that’s the only time I know of in the nuclear age where, if the president had wanted to launch a nuclear strike, he would not have been able to because he wouldn’t have access to the codes.”\n\nThe president is always followed by the briefcase, the so-called “nuclear football,” and a military aide wherever he goes. It has joined every president when they are away from the White House since the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. The football is carried to allow the president to be able to launch a nuclear strike at short notice if needed.\n\nIt originally got its name from an Eisenhower-era nuclear war plan, code-named ‘Dropkick’, and was created to make sure a nuclear war option was always near the president. There are three of the bags in total, one is with the president, one with the vice president and the other kept safe in the White House.\n\n“The ‘ball carriers’ who look after the cases also carry Beretta pistols and are authorized use deadly force against anyone who tries to take it.\n\nLittle is made public about what is inside the cases and it regularly changes. A small antenna that pokes out the top of the case means it likely contains a satellite phone.\n\nThere is also a 75-page book that informs the president of his options for a nuclear strike, with another highlighting places he could hide during a nuclear war.\n\nA ten-page folder on contact details for military leaders and broadcasters sits next to a sealed laminated card known as the Biscuit.\n\nThis looks like a large credit card and shows letters and numbers, with the president having to memorize where on it sits the Gold Code.\n\nIn the event of a nuclear strike, the commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces will say the code down the phone to the National Military Command Centre in Washington D.C.\n\nDespite the bags being kept at the White House when the president is in residence, it is widely thought he carries a card with the launch code on him all the time.”\n\nOhio-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) sail somewhere off Norfolk, Virginia and San Diego, with North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) personnel at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, near Colorado Springs, Colorado, and the U.S. Strategic Command, (USSTRATCOM), the global warfighting command at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nIn the event of a national emergency, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) says, a series of seven different alert conditions (LERTCONs) can be called. The seven LERTCONs are broken down into five defence conditions (DEFCONs) and two emergency conditions (EMERGCONs). Defence readiness conditions (DEFCONs) describe progressive alert postures primarily for use between the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the commanders of unified commands. DEFCONs are graduated to match situations of varying military severity, and are numbered 5,4,3,2, and 1 as appropriate. DEFCONs are phased increases in combat readiness. In general terms, these are descriptions of DEFCONs:\n\nEMERGCONs are national level reactions in response to ICBM (missiles in the air) attack. By definition, other forces go to DEFCON 1 during an EMERGCON.\n\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis, the U.S. Strategic Air Command was placed on DEFCON 2 for the first time in history, while the rest of U.S. military commands (with the exception of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe) went on DEFCON 3. On Oct. 22, 1962 SAC responded by establishing Defense Condition Three (DEFCON III), and ordered Boeing B-52 Stratofortress long-range, subsonic, jet-powered strategic bombers on airborne alert. Tension grew and the next day SAC declared DEFCON II, a heightened state of alert, ready to strike targets within the Soviet Union.\n\nIn The Man in the High Castle, an alternate history novel by American writer Philip K. Dick, published and set in 1962, events take place 15 years after a different end to the Second World War, and depict intrigues between the victorious Axis Powers – primarily, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany – as they rule over the former United States, as well as daily life under totalitarian rule. A television series was loosely adapted from the book and ran for four seasons from January 2015 until November 2019.\n\nIn a similar vein, The Plot Against America is a novel by Philip Roth published in 2004. It is an alternate history in which Franklin D. Roosevelt is defeated in the presidential election of 1940 by Charles Lindbergh. Adapted for television as a six-part miniseries that aired in March and April 2020, The Plot Against America imagined an alternate American history told through the eyes of a working-class Jewish family in Newark, New Jersey, as they watch the political rise of Lindbergh, an aviator-hero and xenophobic populist.\n\nThe fascination with alternate timelines is not limited to science fiction writers. Historians have been known to wonder if the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, in ending Camelot, changed the course of history for the worse? It’s a popular, if not almost universal view, that it did. But historian David Hackett Fischer, in his 1970 book, Historians’ Fallacies: Toward a Logic of Historical Thought, warns of the dangers of counterfactual historiography, which extrapolates a timeline in which a key historical event did not happen or had an outcome which was different from that which did in fact occur. Had Kennedy lived would the United States have exited Vietnam closer to 1964 than 1975? Would Lyndon Johnson’s landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 have passed so soon under JFK? We can only wonder.\n\nYou can also follow me on X (formerly Twitter) at: https://twitter.com/jwbarker22\n\n55.738368 -97.861632\n\nThink of today as “D.B. Cooper Wednesday,” if you will. Because on the Wednesday and day before American Thanksgiving 52 years ago, D.B. Cooper, with his audacious skyjacking, jumped into history on Nov. 24, 1971.\n\n“Have we checked the spare parachute packing card slot? What about the rip cords? Wait, the parachute, was it a 24-foot canopy or a 26-foot canopy? Is there DNA on the tie clip? And, my goodness, how did the money end up at Tena Bar?” asked David Gutman, a Seattle Times staff reporter in a story Nov. 18.\n\n“The questions linger, they spiral, becoming ever more arcane,” he noted.\n\n“If you’re not versed, if you don’t know about the copycats and the diatoms and the titanium particles, it all sounds like Greek.\n\n“But for those who’ve been hooked, captivated, enthralled, the legend of D.B. Cooper does not fade. It is a subculture.”\n\nThe number one song that day on Nov. 24, 1971 on AM transistor radios across the country was Isaac Hayes’ Theme from Shaft, the movie released four months earlier, starring Richard Roundtree as detective John Shaft.\n\nMeanwhile, the chill surface temperature at ground level in Ariel, Washington, situated north of the Lewis River and on the northwest bank of Lake Merwin in Cowlitz County, not far north of the Oregon State line, was 20°F at 8:12 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (PST).\n\nAround this time every November, searches on my blog spike upwards for all things D.B. Cooper related. It is, I noted on Facebook, “the story that keeps on giving.” Remarkably, most years there is still publicity throughout the media, especially in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, focusing on a newly discovered suspect, albeit they are all very old or dead now.\n\nI came kind of late to writing about the D.B. Cooper case, first penning a column on it 12 years ago for the Thompson Citizen back on Nov. 23, 2011. I must have made up for lost time because less than five years later, “Fox Mulder will continue to investigate regardless. And possibly John W. Barker,” Ian Graham, then editor of the Thompson Citizen and Nickel Belt News, wrote on Facebook July 12, 2016.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nov. 24, 1971 – the day before American Thanksgiving that year – someone using the alias Dan Cooper, which quickly got mistakenly turned into D.B. Cooper, committed the most audacious act of air piracy in U.S. history with the mid-afternoon skyjacking of Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305, a Boeing 727 jetliner flying over the Pacific Northwest, en route from Portland, Oregon to Seattle, Washington with 36 passengers and six crew members aboard.\n\nHe paid $20 cash, which included tax, for his airline ticket in Portland. Once on board, Cooper, a nondescript man possibly with a slight Midwestern accent, ordered a bourbon-and-soda, before passing a note to flight attendant Florence Schaffner demanding $200,000 ransom in unmarked $20 bills and two back parachutes and two front parachutes. ‘I HAVE A BOMB IN MY BRIEFCASE. I WILL USE IT IF NECESSARY. I WANT YOU TO SIT NEXT TO ME. YOU ARE BING (sic) HIJACKED.’ Initially, Schaffner dropped the note unopened into her purse, until Cooper leaned toward her and whispered, “Miss, you’d better look at that note. I have a bomb.” Cooper smoked eight Raleigh filter-tipped cigarettes on the plane, but there was no evidence to show if this was a regular habit of his.\n\nThe day-before-Thanksgiving flight landed at Tacoma International Airport in Seattle, where passengers were exchanged for parachutes, including possibly an NB-8 rig with a C-9 canopy, known as a “double-shot” pinch-and-pull system that in 1971 would have allowed jumpers to disengage quickly from their chutes after they landed so that the wind did not drag them, and the cash, all in $20 bills, as he had demanded, although not unmarked it would turn out. The passengers were never aware of the threat onboard. A bank in Seattle was contacted and a bag of money, all $20 bills with recorded serial numbers, totaling $200,000, was delivered to the plane, which was refueled and cleared for takeoff. The bag of ransom money itself weighed 23 pounds.\n\nThe plane took off again, heading toward Mexico at the hijacker’s command, with only Cooper and the crew aboard about half an hour later. Cooper told the pilot to fly a low-speed, low-altitude flight path at about 120 mph, close to the minimum before the plane would go into a stall, at a maximum 10,000 feet, to aid in his jump. To ensure a minimum speed he specified that the landing gear remain down, in the takeoff and landing position, and the wing flaps be lowered 15 degrees. To ensure a low altitude he ordered that the cabin remain unpressurized.\n\nHe bailed out into the rainy night through the plane’s rear stairway, which he lowered himself, somewhere near the Washington-Oregon boundary in Washington State, probably near Ariel in Cowlitz County, or possibly around Washougal or Camas in Clark County.\n\nAlong with FBI, Washington and Oregon state police, and local law enforcement officials, about 1,000 army troops and helicopters were also used in the 1971 search for Cooper.\n\nIn 1978, a placard containing instructions for lowering the aft stairs of a 727 was found by a deer hunter east of Castle Rock in Cowlitz County, which was within the basic flight path of the plane Cooper jumped from, according to the FBI and news reports.\n\nIn February 1980, eight-year-old Brian Ingram, vacationing with his family on the Columbia River about 20 miles southwest of Ariel, uncovered three packets of $5,800 of the ransom cash, disintegrated but still bundled in rubber bands, as he raked the sandy riverbank beachfront at an area known as Tena Bar to build a campfire on the Columbia River about 20 miles southwest of Ariel.\n\nThis year’s suspect is Vince Petersen. When the hijacked plane landed in Reno, Nevada, a black necktie was found onboard. The JC Penney clip-on tie was later found to have had a number of Rare Earth Elements (REE) on its surface, including cerium and strontium sulfide, along with pure titanium particles, all found on it. The only place that used that metal at the time was a lab called Rem Cru Titanium Inc. in Midland, Pennsylvania. Petersen worked there in the 1960s. The titanium research lab consisted of eight men, a small group of engineers, who wore neckties in the lab.\n\nThose elements were used at the time of Cooper’s hijacking by Boeing at its assembly plant in Everett, Washington, 29 miles north of Seattle, in the production of high-tech electronics such as radar screens for their Super Sonic Transport Plane.\n\nBy 1966, deciding that jumbo jets were the future, Boeing acquired Paine Field, an old wartime military base in Everett, and built what remained in 2015 the largest building by volume in the world. It was the assembly plant for the company’s new jumbo jet, the Boeing 747, and the workforce soon exceeded 20,000 at Everett alone.\n\nThe first 747 rolled out of the giant building in 1969. The plant is the size of 40 football fields. Boeing is among the largest global aircraft manufacturers; it is the second-largest defense contractor in the world based on 2015 revenue, and is the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value.\n\nAs the 1970s dawned, the airliner market was saturated and the United States was slipping into recession. Boeing laid off more than 25,000 workers in 1969 and another 41,000 in 1970. Then in 1971 the United States Senate cut funding for Boeing’s sleek new Supersonic Transport, known as the SST, and the company cut nearly 20,000 more jobs. The workforce hit a low of 56,300.\n\nThe so-called “Boeing Bust” had put 86,000 workers on the street in three years.\n\nDid D.B. Cooper work as an engineer, project manager or contractor for Boeing near Seattle in 1971? Did he have white collar connections to the recently downsized Puget Sound aerospace industry of the time?\n\nThere have been a number of Cooper suspects and persons of interest over the years, some more frequently discussed than others: Kenneth Christiansen, Lynn Doyle Cooper, Richard Floyd McCoy, Jr., Duane Weber, Jack Coffelt, William Gossett, Barbara (formerly Bobby) Dayton, John List, Melvin Luther Wilson, and Ted Mayfield. Most had military combat experience. And one Canadian, a Winnipeger who disappeared in 1971, just days after Cooper’s skyjacking, on a return trip from Thompson, Manitoba, flying solo. James (Jim) Hugh Macdonald, 46, the owner of J.H. Macdonald & Associates Ltd., consulting structural engineers on Pembina Highway in Winnipeg, climbed into his Mooney Mark M20D single-engine prop aircraft, bearing the registration mark CF-ABT, and took off half an hour after sunset from the Thompson Airport in Northern Manitoba at 4:30 p.m. on Dec. 7, 1971 to make his return flight home and disappeared into the rapidly darkening sky to never be seen or heard from again. He was the sole occupant of the four-seater plane.\n\nOn Sept 21, 2013, while editing the Thompson Citizen and Nickel Belt News, I received a three-sentence e-mail from a reader out of the blue saying, “I just read your article on James Macdonald. I would never want to disrespect the deceased/missing, but he fits the description of Dan Cooper. The FBI suspects D.B. Cooper was from Canada.”\n\nClaire Macdonald, his wife, told me in an interview in December 2012 that someone once wildly jokingly said to her, “Maybe he flew to Mexico.” She said her reply was: “How far can you go in that little plane in that winter weather?” But the close nexus in time between the two aviation disappearances in late 1971 and the fact both men were Caucasians in their mid-forties made at least some Cooper and Macdonald comparisons inevitable.\n\nJ.H. Macdonald & Associates Ltd. was a small firm with about seven employees. Jim Macdonald was the only professional engineer on staff and a few months after his disappearance, its business affairs were wound down.\n\nOne of Macdonald’s last projects as a consulting structural engineer was the construction of additional classroom space for special needs students at Prince Charles School on Wellington Avenue at Wall Street in Winnipeg. He was in Thompson on business the day his plane disappeared on Dec. 7, 1971 for what was to be an in-and-out single day trip, but it is not certain now exactly what the business was. It may or may not have been related to proposed work for the School District of Mystery Lake since school construction projects were one of his areas of expertise.\n\nMacdonald, who graduated from the University of Manitoba with his civil engineering degree in 1950, often worked with architectural firms, including his brother’s. Other than working for a year in Saskatoon, he spent his entire career living and working in Winnipeg. Macdonald, who was born on March 20, 1925, trained as a pilot when he was 19 and joined the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) shortly before the Second World War ended in 1945 and before he could be shipped overseas into the theatre of combat operations. His son, Bill Macdonald, was 15 when his dad disappeared in 1971 and is a Winnipeg teacher and freelance journalist, who in 1998 wrote The True Intrepid: Sir William Stephenson and the Unknown Agents, telling the story of the British Security Coordination (BSC) spymaster – codename Intrepid – set up by British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). Ian Fleming, the English naval intelligence officer and author, best known for his James Bond series of spy novels, once said of his friend Stephenson, a Winnipeg native: “James Bond is a highly romanticized version of a true spy. The real thing is … William Stephenson.”\n\nMacdonald had filed a 3½-hour flight plan to fly Visual Flight Rules (VFR) via Grand Rapids to Winnipeg that Tuesday. It was around -30 C at the time of takeoff on Dec. 7, 1971 and the winds were light from the west at five km/h, according to Environment Canada weather records, said Dale Marciski, a retired meteorologist with the Meteorological Service of Canada in Winnipeg. Macdonald was reportedly wearing a brown suit jacket when he took off from Thompson and it was unknown whether the plane was carrying winter survival clothing and gear.\n\nWhile there was some ice fog, Marciski said, the sky was mainly clear and visibility was good at 24 kilometres. Transport Canada’s VFRs for night flying generally call for aircraft flying in uncontrolled airspace to be at least 1,000 feet above ground with a minimum of three miles visibility and the plane’s distance from cloud to be at least 2,000 feet horizontally and 500 feet vertically. Transport Canada investigated the disappearance of Macdonald’s flight in 1971 because the Transportation Safety Board (TSB) had yet to be created.\n\nMacdonald’s disappearance triggered an intensive air search that at its peak in the days immediately after the aviator went missing involved more than 100 personnel covering almost 20,000 miles in nine search and rescue planes from Canadian Armed Forces bases in Edmonton and Winnipeg, including a Lockheed T-33 T-bird jet trainer and two de Havilland short takeoff and landing CC-138 Twin Otters, two RCMP planes and 11 civilian aircraft.\n\nThe search for Macdonald and his Mooney Mark M20D began only hours after his disappearance, on the Tuesday night. The Lockheed T-33 T-bird jet trainer flew the missing aircraft’s intended flight line from Winnipeg to Thompson and back to Winnipeg. The T-33 carried highly sophisticated electronic equipment and flew Macdonald’s flight plan both ways at extremely high altitude hoping to pick up signals from the Mooney Mark M20D’s emergency radio frequency, or the crash position indicator, a radio beacon designed to be ejected from an aircraft if it crashes to help ensure it survives the crash and any post-crash fire or sinking, allowing it to broadcast a homing signal to search and rescue aircraft, which was believed be carried by Macdonald on the Mooney Mark M20D.\n\nThe next morning – Dec. 8, 1971 – search and rescue aircraft re-flew the “track” in a visual search both ways, assisted by electronic listening devices, to no avail.\n\nThe area between Winnipeg and Thompson on both sides of the intended flight pattern was then zoned off and aircraft were assigned to particular zones and then flew the zones from east to west at one mile intervals until the entire area was over flown – first at higher altitudes and then again at lower altitudes.\n\nEvery private or commercial pilot flying the area assisted the organized search. Thompson Airport’s central tower was issuing a missing plane report at the end of every transmission, asking pilots in the area to keep a visual watch for Macdonald’s aircraft, and to listen for transmissions on the emergency band on their radios.\n\nA second search for Macdonald and his Mooney Mark M20D single-engine prop aircraft was commenced almost six months later in May 1972, after spring had arrived in Northern Manitoba and all the snow had melted. Nothing turned up.\n\nWho then was D.B. Cooper? The question still preoccupies old-time FBI agents and mystery aficionados alike. There have been a number of other Cooper suspects and persons of interest over the years, some more frequently discussed than others, including:\n\nJohn List, a Second World War and Korean War veteran exited his ho-hum existence as a failed New Jersey accountant by killing his family in 1971, murdering his wife, three teenage children, and 85-year-old mother in New Jersey 15 days before the Cooper hijacking. After the murders, List withdrew $200,000 from his mother’s bank account and disappeared. He wasn’t arrested until 18 years later after Fox-TV’s America’s Most Wanted featured the case in a May 21, 1989 segment, displaying a bust of what an older John List might look like. The network estimated that 22 million people saw it. One was a woman in a suburb of Richmond, Virginia, who thought the bust looked like a neighbor, Robert Clark, a churchgoing accountant who wore horn-rimmed glasses. List, alias Clark, was arrested, tried and convicted, dying in custody in March 2008 at the age of 82.\n\nWilliam Pratt Gossett was a Marine Corps, Army and Army Air Force veteran who saw action in Korea and Vietnam. His military experience included advanced jump training and wilderness survival. Gossett died Sept. 1, 2003 at age 73, retired to Depoe Bay on the Oregon coast.\n\nGalen Cook, a Spokane, Washington lawyer who’s been researching the Cooper case for more than 20 years, says Gossett once showed his sons a key to a British Columbia safety deposit box in Vancouver, which, he claimed, contained the missing ransom money.\n\nHis son Greg lives in Ogden, Utah, where he said his father told him on his 21st birthday that he had hijacked the plane.\n\n“He said that I could never tell anybody until after he died,” Greg Gossett said.\n\nKirk Gossett, another son, says his father also told the story several times.\n\n“He had the type of temperament to do something like this,” Kirk Gossett said.\n\nAfter a career in the military, the elder Gossett worked in the early 1970s in Utah as an Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) instructor, the a college-based program for training commissioned officers of the United States Armed Forces, and also as a military law instructor at Weber State University in Ogden. He also worked as a radio talk show host in Salt Lake City, where he moderated discussions about the paranormal.\n\nLate in his life, Gossett reportedly told his three sons that he committed the hijacking, but the FBI was never able to implicate Gossett, and could never place him in the Pacific Northwest at the time of the Cooper hijacking.\n\n“There is not one link to the D.B. Cooper case other than the statements [Gossett] made to someone,” Seattle Field Office Special Agent Larry Carr told ABC News.\n\nKenneth Christensen had been a paratrooper whose first deployment came just after the Second World War. After he left the military, he worked as a mechanic and a flight purser for Northwest Orient Airlines, the carrier that Cooper targeted for his 1971 skyjacking. Christensen loved bourbon bought a modest house not long after the crime skyjacking of Flight 305.\n\nNow add to the Cooper suspect list Robert Richard Lepsy, a Glen’s Market grocery store manager and married father of four, three boys and a girl, who mysteriously vanished from Grayling, in the middle of northern Michigan, on Oct. 29, 1969. Lake Ann, Michigan author and shipwreck hunter, Ross Richardson, a Benzie County Sheriff’s Department special deputy, who volunteers as a librarian at the Almira Township Library, wrote a book published last year titled Still Missing, Rethinking the D.B. Cooper Case and other Mysterious Unsolved Disappearances.\n\nOn the day he disappeared, Dick Lepsy, 33, called his wife, Jackie, 31, around lunch time and told her he was going to go for a ride. Jackie Lepsy noted at least as early as 1986 in interviews that her husband’s company wood-paneled station wagon was found abandoned two days later at the Cherry Capital Airport in Traverse City, Michigan, approximately 50 miles northwest of Grayling, or about an hour away, with the doors unlocked, a half-pack of cigarettes were sitting on the dash, and the keys in the ignition. Also left behind was an empty bank account and a safe at Glen’s Market missing $2,000.\n\nDespite the circumstances, investigating officers from the Grayling Police Department and Michigan State Police believed that Lepsy had disappeared “on his own accord,” so he was never officially listed as a missing person. As he wasn’t officially wanted for any crime and was believed to have disappeared voluntarily, little police effort was expended trying to locate Lepsy. Local Michigan media ignored Lepsy’s disappearance because it was considered more likely to be an embezzlement case than a missing persons case, and police kept it quiet.\n\nBut a little more than two years after Lepsy disappeared from Michigan, his then 13-year-old daughter, Lisa Lepsy, was watching the CBS Evening News, and saw the story of the Portland skyjacking.\n\n“We were all sitting on the couch watching Walter Cronkite,” she told WZZM13, the Tegna-owned ABC-TV affiliate in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Tegna is formerly Gannett Co., Inc. “When the composite sketch of D.B. Cooper came on the TV screen, everyone looked at each other and said, ‘That’s dad!’ We were stunned because the resemblance was unbelievable, and my brothers and I were all sure that was our dad.” The men were of similar height, about six feet tall, weighed about 180 pounds, and they both had brown hair and brown eyes. Lepsy, who had a high school education, was born in Chicago. Both Lepsy and Cooper wore black loafers and a skinny black ties. Cooper left a skinny black clip-on tie behind on the plane and, along with a tie clasp, while the skinny black tie was part of Lepsy’s mandatory managerial uniform at Glen’s Market in Michigan. DNA was extracted from Cooper’s tie finally 30 years after the skyjacking in 2001.\n\nLepsy’s family finally had his name added to the NamUs (National Missing and Unidentified Persons System) in 2011.\n\nYou can also follow me on X (formerly Twitter) at: https://twitter.com/jwbarker22\n\n55.749746 -97.866593\n\nPeople took to the streets around the world to celebrate en masse the end of the first truly global war. Any cursory search of a newspaper or library archive will produce an abundance of black-and-white scenes of jubilation when the First World War ended Nov. 18, 1918 – 105 years ago this coming Saturday.\n\nOver by Christmas. But not.\n\n“Late on Christmas Eve 1914,” writes Amanda Mason, senior curator-historian with the Imperial War Museum in London, “men of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) heard Germans troops in the trenches opposite them singing carols and patriotic songs and saw lanterns and small fir trees along their trenches. Messages began to be shouted between the trenches. The following day, British and German soldiers met in no man’s land and exchanged gifts, took photographs and some played impromptu games of football. They also buried casualties and repaired trenches and dugouts.” Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who created Sherlock Holmes, later described it as an “amazing spectacle.” Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht and Joyeux Noël and soccer matches in no man’s land with the impromptu Christmas Truce of 1914 in the trenches of the Western Front. But still not over.\n\nTrench warfare. Mustard gas. Shellshock. The best-and-brightest young men and women of a generation from both the Allies, or the Entente Powers, and the Central Powers, senselessly slaughtered. A war that was supposed to be four months long but went on for more than four years. There were 20 million deaths and 21 million wounded in the First World War. The total number of deaths includes 9.7 million military personnel and about 10 million civilians.\n\nThe First World War stands as the real demarcation line between the 19th and 20th centuries and an older world and the modern era. In 1983, Ohio State University historian Stephen Kern wrote The Culture of Time and Space, 1880-1918, a book that talked about the sweeping changes in technology and culture that reshaped life, including the theory of relativity and introduction of Sir Sanford Fleming’s worldwide standard time. All of these things created new ways of understanding and experiencing time and space during that almost 40-year period ending with the end of the First World War. Kern’s argument is that in the modern preoccupation with speed, especially with the fast and impersonal telegraph, international diplomacy broke down in July 1914. Yet there were still vestiges of that older world of shared values and decency – even among enemies – and even in the barbarism of trench warfare in the early months of the First World War.\n\nWhat came to be known as the “Great War” began on July 28, 1914 with Austria-Hungary’s declaration of war on Serbia, igniting the first truly global war. Honduras wouldn’t declare war on Germany until July 19, 1918, while Romania, which declared war with Austria-Hungary on Aug. 27, 1916, exited the war with the Treaty of Bucharest on May 7, 1918, only to re-enter it on Nov. 10, 1918, declaring war on Germany, a day before the First World War ended on what would come to be known as Armistice Day a year later in 1919.\n\nPte. George Lawrence Price, 25, of Falmouth Nova Scotia, is believed to be the last Canadian soldier to die in battle during the First World War. He served with the Canadian Infantry (Saskatchewan Regiment) and had enlisted in Regina on Oct. 15, 1917. Pte. Price was shot by a German sniper in Mons, Belgium at 10:58 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918 – just two minutes before the Armistice went into effect at 11 a.m. Paris Time and very close to the spot the first Allied casualty of the First World War, British Pte. John Parr, of the Middlesex Regiment, had been killed on Aug. 21, 1914. Both Parr and Price are buried at nearby St. Symphorien Military Cemetery.\n\nThe last four Allied First World War veterans died just over a decade ago. Florence Green, of King’s Lynn, the last surviving veteran, who served briefly as a mess steward at air bases in Norfolk, England in 1918, died at the age of 110 on Feb. 4, 2012. Claude Stanley Choules, who lived in Perth, Australia and was the last known combat veteran of the First World War, having been posted to the battleship HMS Revenge in 1917, where he witnessed the surrender of the German Fleet near Firth of Forth in Scotland in 1918, emigrated from Britain to Australia in 1926 and retired from the navy in 1956, died at the age of 110 on May 5, 2011. Frank Woodruff Buckles, of Gap View Farm, near Charles Town, West Virginia, lied about his age to enlist in the United States Army in 1917, and became the last known U.S. veteran of the First World War when he died on Feb. 27, 2011 at the age of 110. With the death of Buckles, the last American “doughboy,” the United States government on March 12, 2011 issued the formal announcement of “the passing of a generation,” something it hadn’t done since Sept. 10, 1992 when Nathan E. Cook, the last known U.S. veteran of the Spanish-American War of 1898, died. John Henry Foster Babcock, Canada’s last surviving veteran of the First World War, died in Spokane, Washington on Feb. 18, 2010 at the age of 109.\n\nNow known as Remembrance Day, which commemorates Canadians who died in service to Canada from the South African War or, as it is also known, the Boer War, between 1899 and 1902, to current missions, Armistice Day, as it was known in Canada until 1931, the day the actual armistice was signed in a railway car in the Allied war zone in France’s Compiègne Forest, was anything but a solemn occasion on Nov. 11, 1918. Soldiers and civilians dancing in the streets and even riots were the order of the day. After four years of war, it would be surprising if it had been otherwise. Here in Canada, from 1923 to 1931, Armistice Day was held on the Monday of the week in which Nov. 11 fell. Thanksgiving was also celebrated on the same day. The name Armistice Day was changed to Remembrance Day in 1931 and fixed as Nov. 11. The South African War marked Canada’s first official dispatch of troops to an overseas war. Of the more than 7,000 Canadians who served in South Africa, 267 were killed.\n\nThe silence and solemnity that now marks Remembrance Day was proposed by an Australian journalist by the name of Edward Honey, who was working in London’s Fleet Street in 1919.\n\nHoney, who had served briefly in the British Army during the First World War, before receiving a medical discharge, wrote a letter to the editor of The Evening News in London on May 8, 1919 under the pen name Warren Foster suggesting an appropriate commemoration for the first anniversary of the Armistice would be “five silent minutes of national remembrance.” Honey had been angered by the way in which people had celebrated with dancing in the streets on the day of the Armistice.\n\nOn the first anniversary of the Armistice in 1919 two minutes’ silence was instituted as part of the main commemorative ceremony at the new Cenotaph in London. King George V personally requested all the people of the British Empire to suspend normal activities for two minutes on the hour of the armistice “which stayed the worldwide carnage of the four preceding years and marked the victory of Right and Freedom.”\n\nYou can also follow me on X (formerly Twitter) at: https://twitter.com/jwbarker22\n\n55.749766 -97.866420"
