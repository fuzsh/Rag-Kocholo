Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis, appeared to be in good spirits Sunday in their first joint public sighting since the comedian filed for conservatorship over his bride of 40 years amid her Alzheimer’s diagnosis.

In pictures obtained by The Post, the couple held hands as they arrived at the Comedy & Magic Club in Hermosa Beach, California, for Jay’s weekly comedy show.

Leno, 73, even greeted the paparazzi with a wave during the outing.

They were joined by a friend who Mavis, 77, chatted with as they walked in and out of the show

The Post has contacted reps for Leno for comment.

Their night out comes just days after TMZ broke the story that Leno filed for conservatorship of Mavis’ estate due to her dementia diagnosis.

Leno has yet to speak about the filing or his wife’s memory loss disease. It is also unclear when Mavis was diagnosed with it.

The lovebirds tied the knot in 1980 after meeting at the Comedy Store in the ’70s. They do not have any kids.

In a 2023 appearance on “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” Leno joked that the secret to a long marriage is to marry a “normal” person before elaborating with some more serious advice.

“I said always marry your conscience,” he said. “Marry the person you wish you could be, who is kind and maybe whatever fault you have, doesn’t haven’t those faults. That’s worked out for me, so to me, I married the perfect person.”

Leno suffered his own health scare in November 2022 when a fiery car explosion left him with severe burns on his face. “The Tonight Show” alum underwent surgeries and skin grafts to his face, chest and hands following the incident.

In January 2023, he survived a serious motorcycle crash that resulted in “a broken collarbone, two busted ribs, and two cracked kneecaps.”
