        "text": "She is?\n\nFor Jay? Yes. For DORKAYPEE? Out of his league. For the rest of us? Average.\n\nMaybe it's the lighting. Perhaps it's what she's wearing. Or it could be the 'work' that's been done.\n\nMavis Leno - Speakerpedia, encyclopedia of speakers\n\nSo if she is fiercely feminist why does she spend so much time and money on plastic surgery rather than embrace her natural womanhood...\n\nNobody said that, as a feminist, she has to be consistent. Hell, she may even shave her legs on occasion.\n\n.....Mavis.....she's good lookin'.....\n\nI realize you've got low standards whether you like it or not, but damn... FAIL\n\nShe looks okay to me. Why the hate and discontent toward Mavis?\n\nIf you look at the other photos of her, she isn't a bad looking woman. Maybe not great but not bad. Leno is well off financially, so he's probably expected to have a 20-something gorgeous bimbo for a wife?\n\nShe looks okay to me. Why the hate and discontent toward Mavis?\n\nIt's not against her - it's against the OP. She's a normal, average woman. Definitely not worthy of starting a thread praising her good looks.\n\nIf you look at the other photos of her, she isn't a bad looking woman. Maybe not great but not bad. Leno is well off financially, so he's probably expected to have a 20-something gorgeous bimbo for a wife?\n\nHe and Mavis have been married for over 30 years."
