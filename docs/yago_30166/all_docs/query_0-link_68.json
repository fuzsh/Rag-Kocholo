        "text": "Jay Leno was officially granted conservatorship over his wife, Mavis Leno, amid her battle with dementia.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the conservatorship, claiming that the philanthropist was in “good care” with the former talk show host, per People.\n\n“I think she’s in the least restrictive environment,” the judge said before turning to acknowledge Jay. “Everything you’re doing is right … I totally understand this is a difficult period.”\n\nThe judge confirmed that Mavis, 77, was on board with the conservatorship and claimed her husband fits the role of her conservator.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nHer lawyer echoed the judge’s sentiments, confirming Mavis was “in agreement” with the former “Tonight Show” host’s request over her, adding she is “receiving excellent care” with him, according to the outlet.\n\nJay, 73, also took a moment to share he was reviewing his wife’s will and estate planning.\n\nIn January, the comedian filed for conservatorship over his wife to set up a living trust for her in case anything happened to him.\n\n“Jay desires to execute an estate plan, including a revocable trust and will, which will provide for Mavis and Mavis’s brother and her sole living heir aside from Jay,” per documents previously obtained by Page Six.\n\nThe “Jay Leno’s Garage” host waited to file the conservatorship until it was necessary, though he didn’t specify when his wife was diagnosed with the disease.\n\nSeparate documents detailed Mavis’ “advanced dementia” diagnosis, claiming it’s leading to a sharp decline in her health as she “sometimes does not know her husband […] nor her date of birth.”\n\nMavis’ neurologist, Dr. Hart Cohen, also noted in the docs that she “has a lot of disorientation” and tends to ruminate “about her parents who have both passed.”\n\nAccording to her court-appointed counsel, Ronald Ostrin, Mavis also “reposed great faith and confidence in Mr. Leno and relied on him for her protection and guidance.”\n\nJay and Mavis have stepped out several times together since the conservatorship filing, often appearing in good spirits.\n\nOn January 28, she attended his comedy show at The Comedy & Magic Club in Hermosa Beach, Calif.\n\nMoreover, recently, the duo was spotted at a Hollywood Improv comedy show in West Hollywood, Calif. on April 3.\n\nJay and Mavis tied the knot in 1980 and don’t have any kids."
