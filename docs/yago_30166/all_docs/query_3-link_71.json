        "text": "Jay Leno’s wife, Mavis Elizabeth Leno, is facing an “advanced form of dementia,” and as her condition continues to decline, has now sadly gotten to a stage where she ‘doesn’t know’ who her husband is.\n\nThe celebrity couple have been married since 1980, and the comedian filed for conservatorship over his wife in January as her condition sadly started to get worse.\n\nCourt documents show devastating reality of Jay Leno’s wife’s illness\n\nAs the 73-year-old filed for conservatorship, court documents obtained by Entertainment Tonight now outline the details of her condition for the first time.\n\nIn the documents filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court, Ronald Ostrin, the court-appointed legal counsel for Mavis, says the 77-year-old is “facing an ‘advanced’ form of dementia and her condition continues to decline”. The conclusion was drawn during his investigation into Leno’s bid for conservatorship over his wife’s estate.\n\nNeurologist, Dr. Hart Cohen claims Mavis “sometimes does not know her husband, Jay, nor her date of birth,” and has “a lot of disorientation”.\n\nThe court documents also heartbreakingly state the American TV host “loves his wife very much” and “treats [Mavis] like gold.” It was also mentioned the celebrity waited to bring about a conservatorship of the estate out of respect to her.”\n\nThe former Tonight Show host hasn’t had an easy ride with his own health\n\nLeno has had a tough few years in regard to his wife’s health, and his own. In November 2022, he was hospitalized after being caught in a garage fire, suffering burns to the face.\n\nTwo months later, tragedy struck again as he was left with several broken bones after being knocked off his motorcycle.\n\nThe 73-year-old suffered third degree burns from the fire and debuted his ‘new face’ on The Kelly Clarkson Show, after doctors used temporary skin grafts as part of his treatment.\n\n“This is a brand-new face, it’s unbelievable!” he exclaimed."
