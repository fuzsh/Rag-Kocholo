        "text": "Jay Leno and his wife Mavis Leno made a rare public appearance on Tuesday at the premiere of Jerry Seinfeld's Netflix directorial venture, Unfrosted, in Los Angeles.\n\nThe former Tonight Show host, who turned 74 earlier this week, was all smiles as he and his wife of over four decades, 77, posed for photos on the carpet and couldn't keep their hands off each other.\n\nSuch was especially evident in their interview on the red carpet with Entertainment Tonight, in which Mavis responded that she was \"feeling great\" about being out for the night.\n\nJay then shared that they were glad to be out for a light-hearted date night. \"Thought I'd come to something fun for a change,\" he quipped. \"Everything is so controversial. Just to come to a funny, silly movie â€“ it's great. I think people will have a great time.\"\n\nMavis has been battling dementia and earlier this month, her husband since 1980 was granted conservatorship of her estate and financial assets.\n\nThe pair gushed about being able to spend time with each other, with Mavis tightly hugging her husband. \"Well, we hang out every day,\" he said. \"We have a great time. 44 years [married], so we're doing good.\"\n\nJay was also asked about celebrating his birthday, and remarked that he wasn't a big \"birthday guy,\" to which his wife added: \"Neither of us are.\" Jay continued: \"My life is a party anyway, so every day is a good day.\"\n\nMORE: Jay Leno makes bold statement about impact of debilitating car and motorcycle accidents\n\nIn January, the Jay Leno's Garage host filed for conservatorship of his wife's estate, which he was ultimately granted in a hearing at the Los Angeles County Superior Court on April 9.\n\nPeople reported that Mavis' lawyer was \"in agreement\" with the conservatorship, saying that the philanthropist was \"receiving excellent care with her husband, Mr. Leno.\" The judge also added: \"I think she's in the least restrictive environment. I think she's in very good care with Mr. Leno.\"\n\nMORE: Jay Leno talks surprising retirement plans after terrifying car fire and motorcycle crash\n\nJay also revealed that he was in the midst of estate planning and assessing his wife's will, although their assets will not be an issue in the matter of their conservatorship due to them being common property.\n\nHer \"advanced dementia\" diagnosis was made public by her husband's conservatorship filing in January, and a previous report from her neurologist also stated that she was sometimes unaware of her own date of birth, or didn't recognize her husband.\n\nJay and Mavis met in the 1970s when he performed at the iconic Comedy Store, and while he was initially hesitant about his prospects as a romantic partner, they hit it off and struck up a romance.\n\nThey tied the knot in 1980, and it seems like their love for comedy remains just as strong, as it was reported earlier in April that he brought his wife to his show at the Hollywood Improv comedy club in WeHo. Mavis dedicated a majority of her time after their marriage to charitable work and philanthropy."
