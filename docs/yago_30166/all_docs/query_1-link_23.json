They met at a comedy club in the ’70s, where Jay performed. Despite Mavis’s initial reluctance to marry, she felt a strong connection with Jay and changed her mind.\n\nThey married on November 3, 1980, the same day as Jay’s parents’ anniversary.\n\nJay credits their lasting marriage to being faithful and marrying someone you admire. Mavis didn’t want children, influenced by TV shows that depicted women as trapped.\n\nShe’s a board member of the Feminist Majority Foundation and advocates for Afghan women’s rights.\n\nJay proposed without an engagement ring, opting instead to ensure Mavis had health insurance coverage. Mavis was diagnosed with dementia in early 2024, and Jay was awarded conservatorship to manage her care.\n\nDespite challenges, including Jay’s busy schedule during his early Tonight Show years and a serious accident in 2022, their bond has remained strong."
