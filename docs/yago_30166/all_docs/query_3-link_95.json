        "text": "Leno’s beloved 77-year-old wife, who he’s been married to for 44 years, “sometimes does not know her husband, Jay, nor her date of birth … has a lot of disorientation and will ruminate about her parents who have both passed,” the lawyer, who spoke with both Mavis and her doctor, stated. Mavis’ court-appointed counsel, Ronald Ostrin, filed the new report offering the update on the famed TV host’s wife. Despite Mavis struggle with dementia, Ostrin called her a “delightful person” with a “charming personality,” noting it’s “clear she had cognitive impairment.”\n\nOstrin also pointed out how Leno continues to be “loving and supportive” throughout their decades-long relationship, and Mavis sees Leno as “her protector and she trusts him.”\n\nMavis also “consents” to the conservatorship filing, as per Ostrin.\n\nThe documents also reportedly note how Mavis’ neurologist, Dr. Hart Cohen, has dubbed Leno as “such a nice man and treats [Mavis] like gold.”\n\nA hearing on Leno’s conservatorship petition is set for April 9.\n\nThe upcoming hearing comes just three months after Leno filed for conservatorship as his wife is suffering “major neurocognitive disorders” following a dementia diagnosis, multiple outlets cited.\n\nA conservatorship is requested when a person is not able to handle their own personal and financial affairs, whether it’s a minor or someone who is “gravely disabled” due to a mental disorder, per Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health.\n\nIt hasn’t been publicized when Mavis first received her dementia diagnosis — but it’s clear that her husband has adopted the role of caregiver.\n\nDavid DuFault, a principal attorney at Sodoma Law, told People in an earlier interview, if Leno’s petition succeeds, he’ll be “responsible for making all decisions based on the scope that the court gives him.”\n\nDecades of Love — Jay and Mavis Leno\n\nJay and Mavis Leno first met in the 1970s after one of his performances at The Comedy Store, which is a world famous comedy club located on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood. Still featuring top talent today, the venue has welcomed Dave Chappelle, Chelsea Handler, Bill Burr, Theo Von and Chris Rock, along with late legends like Robin Williams and Bob Saget.\n\nLeno and many of his colleagues wound up boycotting the club in 1979, going on strike to demand wages for comics. The following year, he and Mavis married. The couple never had children.\n\n“I always had this idea that I would never get married,” Mavis told PEOPLE back in 1987. “But with Jay, I began to realize that this was the first time I was ever with someone where I had a perfect, calm sense of having arrived at my destination.”\n\nAnd Leno has a proven longevity both in his marriage and career.\n\nPerhaps most know as the long-running host of the “The Tonight Show” on NBC, Leno’s first episode aired on May 25, 1992 and his last, 22 years later on Feb. 6, 2014.\n\nLeno has always been a protector, sharing with the L.A. Times in 2014 that marrying Mavis was important to him because he wanted the San Francisco-born philanthropist to be covered by his insurance in the case of emergency.\n\n“I had this insurance policy, and I thought if something happened to me, my girlfriend wouldn’t be covered, but if we’re married, we’re covered, so … we might as well get married.”\n\n“Not the most romantic,” the star, who continues to put his wife’s needs first, joked.\n\nUnderstanding Dementia\n\nAccording to the National Institute on Aging, “Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning — thinking, remembering, and reasoning — to such an extent that it interferes with a person’s daily life and activities.\n\nRELATED: Like Actor Bruce Willis, Millions May Be Struggling With Undiagnosed Cognitive Decline — New Research\n\n“Some people with dementia cannot control their emotions, and their personalities may change. Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person’s functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for basic activities of daily living, such as feeding oneself.”\n\nIt’s unknown what type of dementia Leno’s wife is living with, however, Alzheimer’s is the most common one.\n\nRELATED: Actor Seth Rogan And His Wife Lauren Miller Coping With Mother-In-Law’s Diagnosis of Genetic Alzheimer’s Disease At Just 55-Years-Old\n\n“Various neurodegenerative disorders and factors contribute to the development of dementia through a progressive and irreversible loss of neurons and brain functioning. Currently, there is no cure for any type of dementia,” the institute explains.\n\nThe different types of dementia include:\n\nAlzheimer’s disease\n\nFrontotemporal dementia\n\nLewy body dementia\n\nVascular dementia\n\nMixed dementia (a combination of two or more types of dementia)\n\nThe Complex Art of Caregiving\n\nJay Leno can surely confirm caregiving is a complex and rewarding job. Some days may be more difficult than others, but it’s important to understand just how crucial the role really is.\n\n“Caregiving is the most important job in the universe, because you are there through the highs and lows,” Julie Bulger, manager of patient and family-centered care at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville, Tennessee, told SurvivorNet in an earlier interview.\n\n“You are there to support your loved one, to manage all of the daily tasks as everything is changing in your life. There’s so much evidence that outcomes are better when somebody has an incredible caregiver by their side.”\n\n‘A Sacred And Blessed Calling’: Managing Life As a Caregiver\n\nBut carrying the weight of such an important role can take a toll. That’s why Tom Evans, a pastor of the Brick Presbyterian Church in New York City, wants caregivers to share the emotions they’re feeling with others.\n\n“In those frustrations and that anger, take time to find someone to express that to,” he told SurvivorNet. “Whether it’s a friend, whether it’s a pastor, whether it’s a neighbor, because as you work that out of your system, you’ll be better able to be there for them.”\n\nRELATED: How to Be a Better Caregiver for Your Loved One\n\nEvans says no one can be a caregiver 24/7 — and research suggests caregivers who take good care of themselves provide the best quality of care.\n\n“It’ll break anybody,” Evans said of caregiving. “Just remember that you can’t care for someone else properly unless you’re strong. So, don’t hesitate to find those times.”\n\nPatrick Dempsey’s Advice to Cancer Caregivers: Take Care of Yourself, Too\n\nTo avoid caregiver burnout — the stress, anger, fatigue and illness that can result from putting another person’s needs above your own — professionals suggest finding a relaxing activity that can act as an outline. This could mean getting a massage, joining a support group, seeing a therapist, or a wide array of other activities. There are no right or wrong answers, but just make sure you’re doing something for you.\n\n“It is important to have some things that you can do outside of the focus of caring for somebody that you love with cancer,” Bulger said.\n\nStand-Up Comedian & Cancer Caregiver Jesus Trejo Reminds Us That ‘Laughter is a Game-Changer’\n\nSeek Professional Help If You Need It\n\nWhen a stressful life event occurs, like a loved one being diagnosed with cancer or dementia, people respond in a variety of ways.\n\n“The way people respond is very variable,” Psychiatrist Dr. Lori Plutchik told SurvivorNet. “Very much consistent with how they respond to stresses and challenges in their life in general.”\n\nWhen struggling with a new stressor, there are many different, and healthy, ways to cope. Some people may seek out traditional therapy, and there should be no shame in that.\n\nPsychiatrist Dr. Lori Plutchik Discusses Responding to Stressors\n\nIf you are struggling mentally due to the stress of caring for a loved one, there are many options that may be able to help you cope. These include:\n\nSeeking professional help from a psychiatrist or therapist\n\nLearning healthy coping skills\n\nMedication such as antidepressants\n\nAdding more physical activity to your routine\n\nAdjusting your sleep schedule\n\nConnecting with others via support groups\n\nMindfulness and meditation\n\nSocial workers or patient advocates can be a huge help for caregivers during the journey. As a caregiver, you may want to enlist the help of one of these employees. They often work for cancer centers and can provide guidance on treatment options, financial assistance, information on where to seek mental health resources, and so much more.\n\n“Patient navigators can function differently at different hospitals,” Dr. Kathie-Ann Joseph, a surgical oncologist at NYU Langone Health’s Perlmutter Cancer Center, told SurvivorNet. ”\n\nWe have a really wonderful program at [NYU] where we used lay navigators — meaning they’re not nurses, although you can use nurses or social workers — that pretty much help newly diagnosed cancer patients through the continuum of care.”\n\nDr. Kathie-Ann Joseph explains how patient navigators can help throughout the treatment process.\n\nThese navigators can meet with patients from their first doctor appointments and can also:\n\nAttend appointments\n\nProvide an assessment for next steps of care\n\nAssist with housing, transportation or immigration issues\n\nHelp with financial issues\n\nProvide direction on legal issues\n\nContributing: SurvivorNet Staff"
