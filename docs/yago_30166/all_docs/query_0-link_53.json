        "text": "Jay Leno hasn’t spoken publicly about his wife Mavis’ dementia battle — a valid choice as they take on a difficult health challenge — so fans were excited to see the couple of 44 years make a rare appearance at the red carpet premiere of Unfrosted yesterday, where they gave a brief but sweet update on Mavis’ health.\n\n“I feel great,” Mavis told Entertainment Tonight on the carpet, where the couple posed for photos arm-in-arm. “It’s fun to come to something fun for a change,” Jay added of the couple’s date night. “Everything is so controversial. Just to come to a funny, silly movie — it’s great. I think people will have a great time.”\n\nTalking about how he’s been there for Mavis, the former Tonight Show host said, “We have a great time. What, 44 years? We’re doing good.”\n\nThe Lenos haven’t previously spoken to media about Mavis’ health battle, which came to light when Jay sought conservatorship of the couple’s joint estate in January. A court in Los Angeles granted the conservatorship last month, which allows Jay to “structure her living trust and other estate plans” in case he dies before Mavis, per ET.\n\nCourt documents also revealed that Jay is caring for his wife’s day-to-day needs. “Mavis has been progressively losing capacity and orientation to space and time for several years,” one filing noted. “Jay is fully capable of continuing support for Mavis’ physical and financial needs, as he has throughout their marriage,” but Leno asked for the conservatorship because Mavis’ “current condition renders her incapable of executing the estate plan.”\n\nFurther documents from Mavis’ court-appointed legal counsel stated that Mavis’ dementia had been confirmed by doctors. Her lawyer also stated that Mavis “sometimes does not know her husband, Jay, nor her date of birth,” per a neurologist, and struggles with disorientation. According to the lawyer, the neurologist also stated that Jay “loves his wife very much” and “treats [Mavis] like gold.”\n\nIn the meantime, the couple continues to enjoy their time together on and off the red carpet. Asked how he celebrated his 74th birthday, Jay demurred, “I’m not a big birthday guy. My life is a party anyway. Every day is a good day.”\n\n“Neither of us [are],” Mavis agreed, giving her husband a hug. “We just have each other.”"
