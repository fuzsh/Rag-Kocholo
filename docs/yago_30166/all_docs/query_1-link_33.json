        "text": "Jay Leno gushed over his wife, Mavis, as the pair attended the Feminist Majority Foundation’s 16th annual Global Women’s Rights Awards Gala on May 14.\n\nThe former late-night host, 74, was officially granted conservatorship over Mavis in April following her “advanced dementia” diagnosis.\n\n“We’ve been married 44 years. It gets easier. It doesn’t get harder,” he told Fox News Digital at the event.\n\n“We do everything together,” he went on. “I go home every night, make dinner and sit around. We enjoy each other’s company.”\n\nLeno called marrying the activist and philanthropist, 77, “the smartest thing” he’s “ever done.” He went on to give a speech at the event with Mavis by his side.\n\n“I had to smile when I saw that young college girl come out, which reminded me of a young girl I met,” Leno said of a previous speaker as he got emotional, per Fox News Digital. “She [Mavis] had the same fire. A couple weeks later, I told a story of picking up the front page of a paper with a picture of her [Mavis]. [I thought] this is going to be a fascinating relationship, and it has been.”\n\n“We have a lot of fun,” he continued. “People say marriage is difficult. I don’t get it. I enjoy her company. I enjoy taking care of her. We have fun. She’s the most independent woman I ever knew. Again, I just couldn’t be prouder of her.”\n\nHe added: “I am part of her legacy and that’s what I’m proudest of.”\n\nAs The Post previously reported, Mavis’ lawyer said she was “in agreement” with the conservatorship during a hearing at Los Angeles County Superior Court last month. Mavis added that she was “receiving excellent care with her husband, Mr. Leno.”\n\n“I think she’s in the least restrictive environment,” the judge agreed at the time. “I think she’s in very good care with Mr. Leno.”\n\nThe judge then told Leno “everything you’re doing is right” and “I totally understand this is a difficult period.” He added that the TV personality is “fit” for the role.\n\nThe couple, who do not have children, married in 1980 after meeting at the Comedy Store in the ’70s. They will celebrate their 45th anniversary next year.\n\n“‘Marry your conscience. Marry the person you wish you could be,'” Leno told the crowd at the Tuesday event, recalling what he once told former “Tonight Show” guest Drew Barrymore. “That’s kind of how you stay married for 44 years.”"
