        "text": "“Unfortunately, Mavis has been progressively losing capacity and orientation to space and time for several years,” read the original petition.\n\nWhile it’s unclear when Mavis was first diagnosed, her husband reportedly delayed seeking conservatorship “out of respect to her”.\n\nDuring Tuesday’s hearing at Los Angeles County Superior Court, an attorney for Mavis agreed with the conservatorship decision and said his client is “receiving excellent care with her husband”, according to People.\n\nEarlier this month, Mavis’ court-appointed counsel, Ronald Ostrin, recommended the approval of Jay’s petition. He also described their relationship as “long-term, loving and supportive”.\n\nHere’s what else we know about Mavis Leno.\n\nWhere is Mavis Leno from?\n\nAccording to reports, Mavis Leno was born in San Francisco, California, on September 5, 1946.\n\nShe’s a philanthropist\n\nMavis has been involved in various philanthropic causes over the years. Per People, she’s been a part of the Feminist Majority Foundation’s board of directors since 1997. She’s also the chair of the organisation’s campaign to stop gender apartheid in Afghanistan. The campaign for Afghan Women and Girls was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, as seen on the foundation’s website.\n\nHow did Jay Leno meet Mavis Leno?\n\nIn 2014, Mavis told the Los Angeles Times that she met her then future husband at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles in 1976. “I had gone to the Comedy Store with my girlfriend because I was writing comedy with some partners,” she told the publication. “Friends kept saying, ‘You have to hang out at the Comedy Store and the Improv. You’ll meet people who can give you jobs.’ The first time I went, they sat us front row centre – that means you’re this far from the comic. And there was Jay.”\n\nWhen did Jay Leno and Mavis Leno get married?\n\nAfter four years of dating, the lovebirds tied the knot in November 1980, writes Us Weekly. They don’t have any kids together.\n\nAdditional reporting by Faye Bradley."
