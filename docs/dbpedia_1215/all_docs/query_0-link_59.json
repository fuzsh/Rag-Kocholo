        "text": "A pal of mine, and of this blog, has written a book.\n\nBut not just any book.\n\nIt is called The Perfect Reminder, and it is 350 pages wholly devoted to I’ve Seen Everything, the second album recorded by Trashcan Sinatras which was released in 1993. The book has been written and published to coincide with the remastering, repressing and reissuing of the album by Last Night From Glasgow.\n\nLNFG is a not-for-profit label that was founded in 2016, since which time it has done a ridiculous amount of great work to promote and support some of the best new music coming out of Scotland and further afield. More recently, the label established Past Night From Glasgow (PNFG) as a way to make it easier for fans to pick up vinyl copies of some classic albums from years gone by. It was always a dream of LNFG founder, Ian Smith, to be able to re-release I’ve Seen Everything as it’s his favourite Scottish album ever, and having been given the green light to do so, he then turned his thoughts to create a book telling the story of the making of the album, of its songs, of its artwork and to link all this into some of the backstory of the band itself.\n\nIan turned to Craig McAllister and asked if he would take on the task. Craig, as any of you have ever visited the blog/website Plain or Pan will know, is a tremendously gifted and able writer, someone who really could have made a name for himself if he’d ever looked to be a music journalist. He’s also from the area in which the Trashies grew up and, back in the early 90s was himself a budding musician whose band had rehearsal space at Shabby Road, Kilmarnock, the very studios in which I’ve Seen Everything was mostly recorded. As such, he was around when the songs were developing from demos into fully-formed things of beauty, all of which made him the ideal person to take on the task.\n\nAs the blurb on the LNFG website states, the book features interviews with the band and the likes of Chas Smash, Pete Paphides, Gideon Coe, Emma Pollock, Roddy Hart, Eddi Reader and many more. I happen to be one of the ‘many more’ as Craig also sought out contributions from fans, and my musings have been given over to all of Page 275.\n\nThe Perfect Reminder is an absolute gem, perfect itself in every way imaginable as it’s the sort of book that you don’t have to be a fan of the band to enjoy. What it most certainly will do is make you want to own a copy of the album so that you can listen to what all the understandable fuss is all about.\n\nCraig has done an incredible job in knitting it all together, ably editing down what must have been endless hours of chats with not only the five members of Trashcan Sinatras, but also the many others involved either on the creative side of things or who were part of the supporting network/entourage in the early 90s. Alongside the words you’ll also enjoy portraits and images, most of which have been taken by Stephanie Gibson, herself a very well-known face across the music scene in this part of the world, while the contribution of Brooklyn-based, and long-time band associate, Chris Dooley, in the design process has helped create something more akin to a piece of art rather than a mere book.\n\nThere’s so many parts of the book that I want to share with you, but in the end I’ve settled on the backstory to The Hairy Years, the last but-one track on the album, as told by its co-writer, John Douglas:-\n\nWhen I was 12 or 13, the family went on a summer holiday to Pontins in Filey, a seaside holiday camp with amusements, funfairs, various sports halls and probably bars, although I was too young to notice.\n\nI was always a sucker for twinkly lights, so as soon as I was set free from parental gazes, my savings were flung into the nearest exciting flashing lights machine, promising fun and prizes…delivering neither.\n\nThe first day ended with me knowing heart-sinking skintness, a larger than usual burden of guilt and a lingering anger at being taken for a ride. The seriousness of my situation was mainly because I knew I was on a promise to bring my Gran home a present.\n\nMy cashlessness and the frightening thought of not returning with a present for my expectant, formidable Gran became a constant time bomb ticking throughout the holiday as it slowly passed to its last day.\n\nIn desperation, I decided to nick a snow scene from the souvenir shop and, somehow, I found the nerve to do it and the skill to get away with it.\n\nThus, with a swipe of a souvenir, my first autonomous ‘adult’ act was committed. I did not do as I was told. I did not do as I was brought up to do. I stepped into a kind of independence…criminally so, but there we are.\n\nA small, guilt-driven, event became a milestone. I was no longer a frightened wee boy. I was on my way to something else. As the song says…’Here began my hairy years….’\n\nmp3: Trashcan Sinatras – The Hairy Years\n\nThe Perfect Reminder will soon be available to buy in stores and via the online markets, but you can pick it up now by clicking here for the link at the LNFG website, and at a price which is 20% cheaper than what will be the RRP. You can also pick up a specially designed t-shirt and tote bag if you like. Elsewhere, you can click here to purchase the album, while a good browse around the website will also show what other goodies are on offer, including membership of LNFG for 2022, which itself comes very highly recommended.\n\nI just want to show you the way…..\n\nJC\n\nA GUEST POSTING by CRAIG McALLISTER\n\nPLAIN OR PAN – OUTDATED MUSIC FOR OUTDATED PEOPLE SINCE 2007\n\nIf ever a band were to benefit from a Greatest Hits collection – and I use the term ‘Hits’ very loosely – The Trashcan Sinatras would be that band. With the right marketing and management and all those things that the Trashcans are seemingly so averse to, or just plain bad at, a TCS Best Of could do for them what similar collections have done for acts like Crowded House or James, acts whose definitive compilations are owned by every second home in the UK (pre Spotify statistic, clearly) and as such have helped those acts become household names. If the purpose of a compilation is to bring the artist’s music to a wider audience and perhaps encourage new listeners to dig deeper into that band’s back catalogue, then notwithstanding record company politics, bankruptcy and the shadow of misfortune that seems to lurk around every corner the Trashcans are about to walk ‘round, they really should’ve put one together by now.\n\nOver a course of nigh on 30 years as a living, breathing, touring, recording band (their origins go even further back) they have amassed a small but perfect back catalogue; just 6 studio albums and twice as many singles over their course of time, with the most recent, Wild Pendulum, a still-fresh two years old.\n\nSomewhere along the way they changed from the triple Trash Can Sinatras to the double Trashcan Sinatras (my theory is it’s something nasty to do with lawyers and the avoidance of hefty demands for heftier bills) but they’ve managed to maintain, nay, nurture and grow their magical way with a well-crafted tune. Every one of those half dozen albums oozes tuneage, melody and the world-weary uplifting melancholy that has come to define the band in recent years. Now based between California (original members Frank Reader and Paul Livingston) and the West of Scotland (Davy Hughes and brothers John and Stephen Douglas), their songs take longer than other bands’ to arrive, but when they do they’re as finely tuned as a workshop-fresh racing bike; lean, beautiful and designed for the long road ahead. The Trashcans’ music endures. At their recent Glasgow show in Oran Mor you could’ve put together a brilliant 20 song set of material they chose not to play.\n\nI’ve been there with them since (almost) the very outset. The mid 80s in Irvine was a fertile breeding ground for creative talent. There were dozens of original local bands. Amongst others, the scene (and it really was a scene) gave the world the polar-opposite writers John Niven and Andrew O’ Hagan as well as Andy Kerr who’d go on to play in short-lived 4AD ‘baggy’ act Spirea X, and the Trashcans.\n\nWhen they signed to Go! Discs at the end of the decade, the Trashcans bought a run-down studio in Kilmarnock, renamed it Shabby Road and rented out rehearsal rooms to many of their pals in local bands. I think I’m right in saying a pre taps-aff Biffy Clyro would often take advantage of the cheap rooms to thrash out their own Nirvana-lite, Asda-priced take on grunge as they hatched their plans for bearded world domination. My own band (Sunday Drivers, since you’re reading) was downstairs, directly underneath the Trashcans’ room. Occasionally, in- between our enthusiastic clatter and arguments over who was playing too loud, you’d hear a snatch of Only Tongue Can Tell thudding dully through the floorboards. Sometimes, I’d come in to a band rehearsal and find a tape on top of my amp with a wee note from Paul – “Here’s some new tunes, what d’you think? They might end up as b-sides at some point.” They were great at that, the Trashcans. If they trusted your opinion, you got to hear their new recordings ages before anyone else. All those tapes and notes I still have, of course.\n\nAt Shabby Road the kettle was always on. If you were lucky there might’ve been milk in the fridge. If you were really lucky you might’ve spotted Half Man Half Biscuit playing football in the ‘garden’ at the side or The Stairs blagging guitar strings or a pre-fame John Grant hanging out with his band The Czars. And if you were really, really lucky, you might’ve been there when John Leckie mixed the band’s third single Circling The Circumference, giving it one of those epoch-defining Stone Roses whooshes in the middle. I was fortunate enough to sit in as Worked A Miracle, from their 2nd album, I’ve Seen Everything was magnetised to tape with producer Ray Shulman at the desk. He pondered adding a cello to the mix as he was quite taken with how PJ Harvey had used one on her just-released debut LP. He also told a funny story about working with Bjork while Stephen reassembled his drum kit in the corridor outside the studio office. The acoustics were better there, it was agreed. Heady days.\n\nAnyway, the compilation. As with those recent TCS gigs, you could leave out a perfect set of songs and still go home thrilled at what the band played, so it goes without saying this is an impossible task. You can disagree, debate and deliberate, but you can’t argue that, as far as 10-track introductions go to bands, this is one of the finest you could ever hope to hear;\n\n1. All The Dark Horses\n\nWhen all the wrongs of the world are righted and the error of peoples’ ways pointed out and repaired, All The Dark Horses will play forever on an endless loop, gaining momentum and gathering new fans with each consecutive giddy play. It’s ultra-melodic, features a great wall of gnarled and chiming guitars and the funkiest bassline (funky isn’t a word you’d normally associate with the TCS) this side of Parliament. By the time the band has galloped their way to the key change and the Hawaii-by-way-of-Hurlford guitar break, you may well be crying tears of joy. I am in happy floods as it plays right now while I type.\n\n2. Hayfever\n\nI’ve Seen Everything is the 2nd Trashcans’ album and was recently voted 2nd-best Scottish album ever in a poll in the Glasgow Herald. For a long time it was my own personal favourite TCS album, the rough ‘n ragged follow-up to the pop sheen of debut album Cake. ISE is full of great Trashcans tracks, yet for this compilation, only two tracks from it make the cut.\n\nEven the services of a top producer (Ray Shulman) couldn’t quite clean up the scuffs on the knees of Hayfever, and why would you want to? Rolling along on a piano line that’s eerily reminiscent of Foreigner’s Cold As Ice – a happy accident, surely. Surely? – Hayfever has oft been a pivotal Trashcans’ live moment. Despite one foot half-dipped in sophisto-pop, it packs a punkish punch, with a great swelling build as it nears its chaotic end. “Moscow’s in Ayrshire, what’s the problem?” asks Frank. In concert, that “problem” is often phrased with a Johnny Rotten-esqe roll of the r. Prrrrrroblem. Seek out the live version from Paris’96 if you want to hear it done with feeling.\n\n3. I’ll Get Them In\n\nBy Trashcans’ standards, I’ll Get Them In is a fairly low-key track. When A Happy Pocket was released and toured it was regularly aired on stages from Perth to Portland but in recent times it’s dropped off the radar a wee bit, which is a shame. It’s carried along on an easy to play descending acoustic guitar riff, some trademark TCS major 7ths in the chorus and gentle warm and understated Hammond towards the end.\n\nI’m picking this track for purely selfish reasons. I’ve never asked any of the band directly, but I’m fairly certain that huge chunks of the lyrics relate to a night spent in The Crown in Irvine with Paul, the future Mrs Pan and myself. Paul, just back from a US tour showed us photos – the band in airports holding guitar cases, mainly – and told us stories of the tour.\n\nThe “anecdote about the argument with the singer from Jellyfish,” and “the secretive call to some friends of mine for the gift of £20, just enough to get us pished,” certainly fit my memory of the time, so I’m claiming the glory of being the inspiration.\n\nPaul’s “second-hand jacket from the fire brigade” was sold on a subsequent tour to Ian McNabb of The Icicle Works. As far as I know, he still wears it to this day.\n\n4. The Safecracker\n\nThe Safecracker is a masterpiece in lyric writing and uplifting melancholy. It tells the story of a crook caught out by a combination of the moon, misplaced nails and general bad luck. It’s the melody attached to the brilliant lyrics though that elevates a simple story song into the dizzy heights of greatness. “As fly to tarantuala, as jugular to Dracula… to me and my Ford Spectacular, you’ll be drawn.” That’s a line worthy of Tom Waits, that is.\n\nMusically, it features that classic TCS thing of John’s acoustic guitar carrying the tune while Paul’s electric adds the light and shade, the dynamics to it. The dulcimer seemed to be a favourite instrument during the recording of The Safecracker’s parent album A Happy Pocket, and it’s all over this track like a happy jangling rash.\n\nOne of the finest songs in the band’s back catalogue, The Safecracker has long been a staple of live shows. The extended second verse – “they call me thrifty….I count out £2.50…” – when it builds and builds before dropping once more to the chorus is always sublime, even if the chorus steals just a fraction of the melody from Carole King’s You’ve Got A Friend. What’s the world coming to though if a song about stealing can’t purloin the odd decent melody here and there, eh?\n\n5. Got Carried Away\n\n“You shoulda popped into the studio yesterday,” mentioned Paul as I bumped into him in Kilmarnock’s King Street on a day off from recording. “Norman Blake was there so we got him in to do some vocals on a new track. I think you’re gonnae like it. The whole album actually. Wait till you hear it. It’s gonnae be massive. And I mean ‘Rumours’ massive. Believe me!”\n\nOn record, Got Carried Away rolls with lazy abandon, the drums falling in behind the rhythm of the twin guitars, the simple bass line keeping it together. Franks’ vocal is terrific, a world-weary and lightly toasted croon of resignation. “Hey, it doesn’t matter,” he accepts. “Hey, we’ll work it out.” Slide guitar weeps all over the verses. Electric guitar chimes throughout the chorus. The moonlighting Norman Blake provides those slightly hard-to-hear harmonies.\n\nAgain, once those worldly wrongs have been righted, Weightlifting (Got Carried Away’s parent album)may well go on to be the equal of Fleetwood Mac’s gazillion-seller. Until then, it’ll sit proudly at the top of the tree; the best Trashcan Sinatras album so far.\n\n6. Obscurity Knocks\n\nThe sadly prophetic debut single- number 86 with a bullet and almost* all downhill from there-on in – introduced the world to the Trashcans on a bed of frantically scrubbed acoustics, a lightning fast solo straight outta Roddy Frame’s Big Book Of Flashy Fretboard Wizardry and an unashamedly Scottish vocal. Early Trashcans was packed full of word play and clever puns and Obscurity Knocks runs the whole gamut. “The calendar’s cluttered with days that are numbered,” it goes, and in terms of those damned chart positions (should such things still matter to the band) it probably is, but despite their lack of commercial success, the TCS plough gamely ever onwards.\n\nRecent live shows have seen the band play Obscurity Knocks with something approaching a feral post-punk aggression and you’ll be hard-pushed to find anyone who has a problem with that.\n\n*Hayfever is the highest-charting TCS single, having crept to the dizzy heights of number 61 in 1993\n\n7. How Can I Apply?\n\nIt’s Simply Having A Wonderful Christmas Time, innit? Well, it is, until the chords kick in and How Can I Apply? skims along like a well-polished stone across the River Irvine, a mid-paced TCS shuffler with the band drawing upon all their strengths; a melody to die for sung beautifully, chiming guitars, a slinky solo (the twang’s the thang, baby) and some beautiful, understated keyboard work. Nothing more need be said about one of the band’s most enduring numbers.\n\n8. Usually\n\nIf you were to Google an audio dictionary and look up the word ‘sublime’, it would play you Usually.\n\nUsually is a grower. It’s not got the pop-hit feel of others nor the introspective melancholy that defines much of TCS’ slower material, but it has a terrific intro (subtly panned from speaker to speaker) that repeats a couple of times through the song; all tumbling, echoing, climbing, shimmering guitar notes. Clipped guitars make way for arpeggiated runs, wonky chords and a subtle string section. “Slide out of my life,” sings Frank with resigned despair, as Paul’s slide guitar wah wahs its way into orbit, flying on a rocket ship made once more from gossamer-thin major 7ths. Romeo Stodart of The Magic Numbers once told me, with spot-on accuracy, that Usually was the equal of a Bacharach ballad.\n\nThat part when the vocals fall over one another – “Usually, usually, usuall-ee-ee…” Pure Beach Boys. And there ain’t no greater praise than that. Usually wouldn’t at all sound out of place on any one of those under-appreciated 70s Beach Boys albums. I wonder if Brian Wilson has ever heard it.\n\n9. Orange Fell\n\nOrange Fell is all about the crescendo. It always reminds me of Twin Peaks music; pretty, far-off and slightly sinister with a sudden, final ending. It’s a fantastic mood song and would sound great sound-tracking a scene in a David Lynch movie. You can sing it, but it’s more likely you’ll just want to turn it up and let your head swim in it. “Drifting….drifting…stickleback waters…” It’s a song about childhood or of days gone by or of failed relationships. Actually, I don’t have a clue what it’s about. Like all the best music though, I’ve my own interpretation.\n\nListening to it as I am right now, it takes me back to summer holidays of a childhood long-gone, of playing down at the River Annick in the same spot where the police frogmen searched for the body of Sandy Davidson in 1976, of times when summers lasted entire years and the weather was always sticky hot. “Come home when it starts to get dark,” we were told in the days long before mobile phones. When the sodium started to burn on the streetlights and the orange fell, casting its fiery glow into the twilight, you headed home. Wee Sandy never, ever did.\n\nI think I’m correct in saying this is Guy Garvey’s favourite Trashcans’ track. Wouldn’t he just give his right arm, or even his Elbow, to write a track as perfect as this one.\n\n10. Co-Stars\n\nA rarity, an obscurity, a beauty.\n\n“Blue soft light on Ailsa Craig. The feelin’, freewheeling’ up Electric Brae.\n\nAnd lettin’ all I have roll away, was dare I say, defiance of science in its own way.”\n\nIf you’re from Ayrshire, this’ll make sense. If you’re not from Ayrshire you’ll still marvel at the majesty of such a great lyric. Straight from the land of Burns, it’s pure poetry.\n\nLike all the best TCS songs, this starts downbeat and low-key then soars in the chorus. It ebbs and flows between the verses, enhanced by all manner of sky-scraping eerie slide guitar, full fat acoustics and a terrific piano line, creeping around the periphery of the main instruments but pinning the whole thing together.\n\nAs I type I’ve just noticed, for the first time, a complementary backing vocal somewhere low-down towards the end. See, the Trashcans sometimes make you work for your listening pleasure, but it’s all the better for it.\n\nAnd there you have it. Ten tracks o’ Trashcans.\n\nFolk’ll say, “But you didn’t include ______ or _____ or even ______.” Pure and simple, the Trashcans are victims of their own high watermark. As far as sequencing goes, it generally gets slower as it nears the end, a coincidental metaphor for the band’s output with each successive album. Feel free to re-sequence or stick on shuffle – this is music for pleasure, so play it as you fancy. And play it often.\n\nCraig McAllister, 28th August 2018\n\nAnother very welcome and interesting contribution today, this time courtesy of rhetor (not his/her real name!!), a resident of Toronto where I spent a very happy four months working on a a secondment back in 2007.\n\nIt’s not rhetor’s first contribution to the blog as they explain in this really lovely covering e-mail:-\n\nI am a bit of a long time reader and fan of your blog, and have for many years enjoyed opening every evening’s new column and perusing its song sample. It is a delight, as a Torontonian, to see your unique far-off yet near to home perspective on the musical taste we all too often seem to share. And though you probably do not recall, I have even left the occasional comment or two, entered one of your contests (the draw for Morrissey’s Swords), and even contributed briefly a song and write-up that featured when you were away in Ireland after the death of your brother (the Beloved’s song “Found” from the album “Happiness”).\n\nActually, as an unhappy anecdote, I must say that I once penned a whole column to contribute to a series you featured a long time ago, where readers wrote about “ten random songs from their iPod shuffle” and what they meant to them, but sadly, just as I clicked send, the laptop froze and I lost everything! I was so disheartened that it took quite the long time, though tempted often, to get around to trying another entry for your consideration and possible inclusion in a series.\n\nI als feel that it is a bit cheeky of me to contribute an entry to your Imaginary Album’s series for The Trashcan Sinatras, as I know that you are indeed a fan too, but also that others in your ken (such as Colin from Fivehungryjoes) are also super-fans, but as I saw that no one had yet tried this exercise of creating the definitive TCS album, and that the long-awaited sixth TCS album is being born in just a month or two, so it would be an ideal time for a bit of a retrospective. So, feel free to include, if you think it might fit, or not, if it is not quite what you see fitting in. But I do need to say that I love your daily entries, and you must promise never to stop writing, as you can see how much you mean to readers even far-off across the proverbial pond.\n\nSo without any futher ado:-\n\nFor those not aware, the Trashcan Sinatras (formerly known as The Trash Can Sinatras) are soon to release (in September) their sixth studio album, which those who wish to support, I believe, can still do through the group’s Pledge Music campaign. An ideal time, then, to do a bit of a retrospective of the band in anticipation of the coming but long-awaited treat.\n\nSide A\n\nTrack 1: Obscurity Knocks (from the album the album Cake)\n\nAs the opening track for the band’s debut album, and the debut single released prior to the album that introduced the band to the world, this is the obvious choice for album opener.\n\nYes, I say world, because the song did very well not only at home in the band’s hometown of Irvine and environs, but also in the USA college radio circuits, and in my native city of Toronto, Canada, thanks to decently heavy airplay on my then-favourite and must-listen radio station CFNY, and the support of the very thoughtful and influential DJ Alan Cross (if you are not familiar with him in other parts of the world, fans of The Vinyl Villain and his musical tastes may well be interested in googling Alan Cross’s name to find the podcasts of his lengthy series The Ongoing History of New Music).\n\nThe pun-filled humility of the title is a hallmark of the band that has not left them to this day, despite the fact that this single may have proved a bit more prophetic than the band would have liked…\n\nTrack 2: Earlies (from the album the album I’ve Seen Everything)\n\nThe band’s musical and song-writing depth is evident in the fact that this early gem is sung by guitarist John Douglas, not the fabulous lead vocalist Frank Reader. And so many lovely covers of this song have sprung up, including (of course) by Eddi Reader (Frank’s sister and John Douglas’ wife) and more recently by Lotte Kestner. Fine, evocative storytelling here…\n\nTrack 3: Oranges and Apples (from the album In the Music)\n\nNot to be confused with Pink Floyd’s 1967 song “Apples and Oranges”, this is nonetheless a tribute from the band to the influential and poetic Syd Barrett, with some of the band’s best dreamy-sounding guitar work, and a return on their most recent album to the delightfully playful lyrics that were a hallmark of the earliest albums…Yes, it’s almost 7 minutes long, but hey, boy, you ain’t heard nothing till you heard it live where it just gets longer and longer…\n\nTrack 4: The Sleeping Policeman (from the album A Happy Pocket)\n\nWho else could write a song with a title alluding to a traffic-slowing barrier that then turns out to be ostensibly about North Sea fishing trawlers bringing home their catch, but in fact is more profoundly, as the lyrics tell, about “life and death”?\n\nTrack 5: Trouble Sleeping (from the album Weightlifting)\n\nFor me, this is the eerie heart of the Weightlifting album. A gentle and beautiful sound, but just under the surface the lyrics tell the story of grisly unsolved murders that took place near the bands hometown…\n\nSide B\n\nTrack 6: All the Dark Horses (from the album Weightlifting)\n\nThis is the beautiful track that really makes the Weightlifting album (the band’s long-awaited “Comeback Album” after the bankruptcy that followed the collapse of Go! Discs and the end of their recording deal.\n\nIt has been used as a TV soundtrack leader on American TV, remixed into a club song and made available through the band’s website, covered by adoring TCS tribute bands, and even released in two versions on the Weightlifting deluxe album (acoustic as well as the radio single version)…but of course nothing beats the original…\n\nTrack 7: The Safecracker (from the album A Happy Pocket)\n\nI think many, many fans would have this on their list.\n\nThe opening lines, “As fly to tarantula, as jugular to Dracula/ to me in my ford spectacular, you’ll be drawn…” give a feel for what the rest of the Happy Pocket album is like: a highly literate, but tongue-firmly-in-cheek ironic look at a variety of odd characters and personages both real (of the band’s ken) and very hopefully imaginary.\n\nTrack 8: The Hairy Years (from the album I’ve Seen Everything)\n\nAgain, this is a song that is not likely to have made the cut of every TCS fan out there, but is a personal favourite that just had to make the cut.\n\nI had originally bought the band’s first album, Cake, as a whim upon seeing it in the music shop, as it had a sticker that claimed it was Scotland’s answer to The Smiths (?!) and as it was on the Go! Discs label that was a home for my other current favourites The La’s, Billy Bragg, The Housemartins, and The Beautiful South. I figured I could trust a label that was perspicacious enough to snap up such a collection of great artists, and it turned out to be a wise decision as I loved the album on first hearing, though I really never heard much of The Smiths in their sound.\n\nBy the time the second album, ISE, was released I bought it the first day, and was equally impressed on first hearing, though by no track more immediately than The Hairy Years, which seemed to me to be so delicate in the beauty of its harmonies and child-like simplicity of lyrics that covered over some mysteriously dark content, that I recall being afraid to listen to the album too many times, for fear that the first impression would wear out and I might tire of that first feeling…Of course, I never did.\n\nTrack 9: The Best Man’s Fall (from the album Cake)\n\nNo more need be said to convert casual friends to TCS fans than to quote a few selections of their lyrics. And there are few better or more frequently quoted than these (and looking at them, no wonder that plenty of fine bands overtly cite the Trashcan Sinatras and their lyrics as major influences, not least of which include The Lucksmiths (featured here recently) and the popular and rising Canadian indie band Stars).\n\ncould i interest you in a little something special\n\npay the earth but if you have no money\n\nyour attention’ll do\n\nand if you don’t give a damn\n\nyou’re welcome to keep it…\n\nthe hands of the clock give me a round of applause\n\nfor getting out of bed and the scars of the night before\n\nhave turned into scabs and still I’m seeing double\n\nand i’m looking twice my age\n\nit’s getting to the stage where\n\ni’m old, not wise, just worried\n\nand stories of rags to riches leave me in stitches\n\nand with a thread that’s hard to follow\n\nyou came into my life like a brick through a window\n\nand i cracked a smile\n\n‘Nuff said.\n\nTrack 10: Mr. Grisly (the acoustic version taken from the band’s self-produced Radio Sessions: Volume 1 rather than the original b-side from the single for Twisted and Bent):\n\nAnother song that is not every fan’s favourite necessarily, and only ever saw light of day as a b-side, but happens to be my own personal TCS #1, so here it is.\n\nI was a genuine life-time highlight when they agreed to play it live in concert at my request, at a small venue in Toronto in 2011 as part of their “all- request private house party” concert series.\n\nHidden Bonus: Astronomy (acoustic version taken from the band’s self-produced Radio Sessions: Volume 1, rather than the original Japanese-only bonus track from the Weightlifting album).\n\nThe beauty speaks for itself, and makes a very lovely surprise closer for this Imaginary Album…\n\nThe Almost-Made-Its\n\nHayfever: This was the band’s second highest charting single, reaching the dizzying heights of #11 on the U.S. Modern Rock charts and a fine pop song it is too. The music video was reviewed somewhat favourably by Beavis and Butthead back in the day, despite their predictable juvenile mocking of the band’s accents!\n\nGhosts of American Astronauts: As TCS began their career back in the mid-to-late ‘80’s as a covers band, it would have been nice to find space for this gem (a cover of a Mekons song which was never released but made its way to the very scarce CD Zebra of the Family, which the band released as a way to both clear their recording studio closets of some gems and skeletons that somehow never saw the light of day, as well as to raise some much needed funds to help record their fourth album, Weightlifting, after the awful spectre of bankruptcy followed the collapse of their record label, Go! Discs, and the end of their recording deal.\n\nDrunken Chorus: A true gem, and proof of the strength of the band’s depth of songwriting that this only made it as a b-side, or as one of six bonus tracks for the Cake album if you happen to live in Japan. As I indicated above, some of the very best Trashcan songs appear buried on the backs of singles releases! This is the one that the rowdy drunk guy at the back of the concert hall always shouts out for, and sometimes gets…\n\nWild Mountainside: A lovely ballad about the geography of their home country of Scotland, and one of the better known songs by the band, as it has been covered by John Douglas’ wife Eddi Reader and performed before royalty…\n\nAnd now, having finished, I feel that all of the other TCS fans out there will begin the howls about what I left out, but let me say, as all of the others who have contributed have said before, that this is an outrageously difficult thing to do, to reduce a band that you love to one album of ten songs, and having come out from the grueling experience, I can only answer the critics by quoting from the delightful lyrics of the TCS song I’m Immortal:-\n\nI took a kick in the confidence, down in the tackle I hurt\n\nI took a shine to your big size tens\n\nnow all around the subject I skirt, gingerly, gingerly…\n\nrhetor\n\nmp3 : Trashcan Sinatras – Obscurity Knocks\n\nmp3 : Trashcan Sinatras – Earlies\n\nmp3 : Trashcan Sinatras – Oranges and Apples\n\nmp3 : Trashcan Sinatras – The Sleeping Policeman\n\nmp3 : Trashcan Sinatras – Trouble Sleeping\n\nmp3 : Trashcan Sinatras – All The Dark Horses\n\nmp3 : Trashcan Sinatras – The Safecracker\n\nmp3 : Trashcan Sinatras – The Hairy Years\n\nmp3 : Trashcan Sinatras – The Best Man’s Fall\n\nmp3 : Trashcan Sinatras – Mr Grisly (acoustic)\n\nmp3 : Trashcan Sinatras – Astronomy (acoustic)"
