        "text": "Have you ever heard the song 'Brothers'?\n\nIf you're reading this in August of 2019, your answer is probably, \"I heard the first verse!\" Only a month ago, on July 2nd, \"Brothers\" made a much-hyped debut as part of the season 2 premier of Tales. It was the first Kanye West song of the year, a welcomed relief for fans who had been on an impatient vigil for West's long-delayed 9th solo album, Yandhi. While \"Brothers\" wasn't an album, it was something.\n\nThe song arrived in the Tales episode's final moments, as part of a wedding scene. The best man gives a toast that includes reading a poem (the lines of which come straight from \"Brothers\"). Then the DJ calls everyone to the dance floor and announces, \"I got this new Kanye West.\" \"Brothers\" plays for 1 minute and 30 seconds, as we see a montage of everyone dancing and having fun.\n\nThe fan response, to what was essentially half of the full work, was strong. The sentiment could be summed up as: \"Brothers\" was, for Kanye, an unexpected and appreciated return to a sound many thought forever in the past after the increasingly avant-garde path West has walked since 808s & Heartbreak came out in 2008.\n\nIt seemed like \"Brothers\" was poised to make a splash and enter the pantheon of non-album tracks that Kanye fans fawn over, songs like \"All Day,\" \"White Dress,\" \"Christian Dior Denim Flow,\" and \"Only One.\"\n\nBut a funny thing happened. \"Brothers\" never officially released. The closest we came was an Instagram post that was up for less than 24-hours before it was copyrighted into extinction.\n\nSo if you're reading this further in the future, chances are you may have never heard Kanye West's version of \"Brothers.\" And, sadly, may never will.\n\nThat leaves us with a question.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nIn order to provide an answer, I spent over 6 hours interviewing people who worked on or were part of facilitating the 3-year journey of creating \"Brothers.\" What follows is a mix of reporting and oral history that's a deep-dive into the process, humanity, and politics of the music industry...and...ultimately, a long-form eulogy for a song whose doom was—you'll be surprised to find out—almost two-decades in the making.\n\n2016: Music that heals\n\nWe're in Agoura Hills, California. At the home of Judge Herb Dodell. It's here that producer 7 Aurelius has retreated.\n\n7: My mother had passed away. I had to go to Kentucky for a few years. At the same time I ran into tax trouble. At the same time I was going through some girlfriend troubles. At the same time I fell out with my uncle who was like my first brother. We grew up together in my grandmother's house. I got into an old Mercedes Benz and drove across country from Kentucky to California. I was very heartbroken. I felt very isolated. Here I was famous for all these big records and I'm going through such a difficult time. I asked my friend if I could stay with him until I could get my things together.\n\nHerb: My wife and I invited him to stay with us because we're very close friends. I told him, \"It'd be silly for you pay for a hotel room when you don't know how long it'll be. Just stay with us. Bring your studio equipment and you can work out here in the country.\"\n\n7—otherwise known as Channel 7, recently B7LLY, originally Marcus Vest—was one of the dominant producers of 2000-2010. What Kanye had been to Roc-A-Fella, 7 was to Murder Inc., creating a run of hit songs for Ja Rule and Ashanti. He'd even collaborate with Eve (\"Gangsta Lovin'\"), LL Cool J (\"Hush\"), and Jennifer Lopez (\"Ain't It Funny\"). And win a 2003 Grammy for Best Contemporary R&B Album for Ashanti's self-titled debut.\n\nBut as the decade turned over, 7's name in the credits all but vanished. What followed was an extended period out of the limelight after the bittersweetness of a decade's-worth of fame. You could imagine how this might be a blessing and a curse. You have time, again. Control, again. Space to breathe and create and try new things. But the cost of that is a reduction in money, attention, and even opportunity. When the negative of that trade-off starts to outweigh the positive, there's dissonance. You're famous for all these big records, but your life doesn't seem to reflect that. It can leave you feeling some kind of way.\n\n7: I stayed with [Herb] throughout that whole summer. I was basically woodshedding every single day for four months. Piano, piano, piano. It's all I had to do. This piano was enchanted. It's like my fingers were falling into grooves they had never really fallen into.\n\nHerb: I was blessed to have been the lawyer for Johnny Mercer. He was one of the legendary composers. He won eight or nine academy awards. I used to go to [the Mercer's house]. He had a piano in the living room and I admired it. When he died, I went back to the house to work on the estate. I convinced Ginger, his widow, to let me have the piano. The song \"Moon River\" was written on it, among many others. Over the years, it had a real nice energy to it, when you consider what Johnny had put into it. There are things we have in our lives that have a specific importance. They have a certain energy about them. Like going into a place, you may have never been there before but you like it. Other places, you go and you say, \"Yuck, I don't want to be here.\" This piano has whatever Johnny put into it. In fact, he wrote \"Seven Brides For Seven Brothers\" on it, which is kind of interesting since we're talking about 7. 7 was using the Mercer piano.\n\n7: I had gotten to the point in my career.... There were so many new production teams, and faces, and styles, and budgets. The music industry had changed so much I started to feel like, \"Damn, what am I going to do?\" And a voice kept telling me, \"Just work. Just work. Work, work, work.\" And work I did. Every day I was writing and getting better. Until one day, in mid-July—I wrote \"Brothers.\" It stopped me in my tracks. I knew it was going to be incredible when it happened.\n\nIn 2011, 7 had a record label called The Aurelius Group. Fallout with label signee's The Rej3cts over the viral song \"Cat Daddy\" led to a lawsuit. This was when crisis manager Melanie Bonvicino, at the request of a mutual friend, entered 7's life. The two have worked together ever since, with Melanie serving as a manager-slash-public-relations figure.\n\n7: Melanie is my ace forever. Melanie and Kevin are the executors of my will, of my estate. That's how close we are. I'm thankful and I'm blessed to have people like that.\n\nMelanie: The piano for him goes back to his roots when he was a young boy going to a record store. 7 used to play the keyboard there. That's home for him—the keyboard. It's always a safe place for him to go and create and process where he is in his life and where he's going. 7 [in the summer of 2016] had relocated back to Los Angeles. He talked about creating some more theatrical types of music. So the music at that time was more cinematic in nature and message-driven. He's had 14 number-one hits. If you watch him work in the studio he creates a character for the artists. He gives them an identity. For him, performance is really, really vital. He truly is a director.\n\nHerb: He played for weeks—I know because I kept hearing it. One day I came home from court, and he was playing something, and I said, \"Well, that's interesting.\" And 7 said, \"You know what? I think this song is perfect for Kanye West.\" I'm not into a lot of modern music, I'm more of a traditionalist. I said, \"Okay, that's great, he's popular.\" I didn't take it too seriously. But he played it for me and it was really well structured and really well done, and I like the lyrics. Johnny was a great lyricist.\n\n7: I thought the record was for Kanye. I had met him a long time ago when I was really on top in the first part of my career and he had just had the accident. I was being managed at the time by Todd Moscowitz who was with Violator. That was the first time I met Kanye, and I was like, \"Man, I'm happy everything worked out for you man. Welcome back.\" Fast forward back to Agoura Hills on the day I wrote this. I was like, \"Man, I really feel like Kanye's going to performance this...but I don't have any connections to him right now.\"\n\nAfter leaving Murder Inc., 7, for a time, joined Bad Boy's famed Hitmen production team. There he met, Kevin Thomson, a native Torontonian who had come to New York to work for Bad Boy Entertainment. The two became friends, and Kevin, now a music lawyer, has worked with 7 ever since.\n\n7: Kevin is like the white version of Clarence Avant, he's like the dealmaker. He used to work with Bad Boy and he was helping me when he was just an intern at Bad Boy. He just kept moving up. And then he was out of there. We always knew he was going to be out of there. He's super, super smart and everyone loved him. Puff loved him. Mario Winans loved him. And then he just became this phenomenal dealmaker. Constantly like, \"Have you met this person? Have you met this person?\"\n\nKevin: It must have been 2016 when 7 first sent me \"Brothers.\" He had a crib and he was basically composing on a piano. 7 definitely channels his energy from somewhere. When he gets behind a piano he writes these incredible songs. He sent me this record. It had a Bossa nova feel to it. If I'm not mistaken, it was eleven or twelve minutes long. It was wild. But the lyrics were so powerful. I was like, \"Bro, this is incredible.\" I was blown away, I loved it to death. Even the Bossa nova vibe was sick. It had a bit of Dilla feel to it.\n\nHe was working a few kind of different styles and projects, figuring out what to do next with himself. And it went to the side. It was sitting there.\n\nIn April of 2016, Billboard runs an exclusive: \"BET and Irv Gotti Partner To Tell 'Tales'\". The show's first seasons is \"slated for second or third quarter 2017...\" They quote Irv as saying, \"This isn't no reality show shit and not a video. I'm going to tell a story like only I can tell a story and involve the hip-hop culture, which is colorless. Visionary Ideas [his studio] is DreamWorks times 100, which is a crazy statement as big as Dreamworks is. But that's my goal.\"\n\n2017: Music that connects\n\nTales premiers June 27th, 2017. The premise is every episode is inspired by a rap song. For example, the season's sixth episode was called \"99 Problems.\"\n\nThe original Jay-Z track, \"99 Problems,\" is popularly known for its hook (\"If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son/I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one\") and second verse that's a dramatized showdown between Jay-Z and a police officer who has pulled Jay over and wants to search his car for drugs.\n\nFrom the synopsis of the Tales episode, you can see how Gotti and his team borrow from the song but bring originality to the concept: \"When the Black Lives Matter movement is declared an enemy of the state, two college lovers and BLM activists go on the run to escape the clutches of the police.\"\n\nOn November 19th, 2017, a week before the Tales' season finale, Irv Gotti posts a picture on Instagram of him and Kanye West.\n\nIrv's caption: When 2 people like me and Kanye get together. Hip Hop is about to get something enormous. Like enormous. 2 crazy. Out of the box thinkers. That only thinks about serving the world!! Hahah. Stay Tuned. Great great great meeting of the minds. Like i told him. We have to take a pic of this.\n\n7: A year later, November 2017, I get a text from Irv. At the time Irv and I, who has been my production partner for two decades, were on the outs. He and I are historically on the ins and outs. He's like my big brother in the industry because he's the one who really gave me my shot.\n\nIrving \"Irv Gotti\" Lorenzo, like many other prominent hip-hop figures, grew up in one of the five New York City burrows—Queens. One of the first songs he produced was the 1995 track \"Time to Build,\" for Mic Geronimo. It featured Geronimo and then-unknown rappers Ja Rule, DMX, and Jay-Z. Two years later, in 1997, Def Jam would not only partner with Roc-A-Fella Records but also provide Gotti the funds to launch Murder Inc. Records. As the label-head, he continued to produce, often working in tandem with 7 Aurelius.\n\n7: We used to be roommates, we had a penthouse together on Wall Street. I have so many amazing memories of Irv. It just got to a place where I was always in his shadow. I needed to break out of that. I needed my credit first.\n\nI hadn't heard from him in seven years. We had gotten into a huge fight. I ended up saying some crazy shit to him and I didn't know it was his birthday. November 2017, he texts me. \"Yo, I was just with Kanye last night. I swear to God, you got to hit me.\" So I call him, \"What's the deal? First of all, how you doing?\" He's like, \"I was with Kanye last night. And I swear to God, Sev. I could not think of anything else. I kept hearing God tell me, 'Call, 7. Call 7.' I was not allowed to leave that place until I brought your name up in the conversation. When I brought your name up, it was all love from Ye. I gotta come by your studio.\" Which elated me, I was like, \"Fuck yeah.\" I was like, \"Thank you, Father.\"\n\nKevin: 7 called me and said \"Yo, I'm going in with Kanye tomorrow. I'm putting tracks together. You got any ideas?\" I was like, \"Play him 'Brothers.'\" He obviously put it in his pocket. Ask him to tell you about the session with Irv, Mike Dean, Kanye, and Kid Cudi, at Kanye's house.\n\nUp to this time in 2017, Kanye West had been avoiding, for the most part, the all-seeing-eye of the media. Tucked away in the aptly named enclave-of-the-financially-successful that is Hidden Hills, California. Recovering from the tumult of 2016 that saw West endure, for the second time of his career, an Icarus-like plummet from the empyreal heights few artists ever obtain.\n\n2016 would be, for West, defined by his 7th studio album, The Life of Pablo. January was the immense pre-release hype, fueled by the wild-card-energy of Kanye's Twitter presence, where you'd never know what he'd tweet or when. February was the official release. Come June, Kanye announced the Saint Pablo tour. August began West's cross-country jaunt atop a floating stage. In total, Kanye performed 41 times in 84 days. But the final 22 performances never happened, after West, on November 19th, waylaid his own Sacramento show (after waylaying his San Jose show two days earlier) to give a nearly 20-minute speech that ranged from airing a mix of personal and industry tensions with Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Dj Khaled, and Drake, to an analysis and critique of politics and society, and validated Donald Trump. Public response was, to put it lightly, not positive.\n\nDays later, Kanye would be hospitalized for what will be, at this point, reported as extreme sleep deprivation—though there were rumors and rampant social media speculation of a bi-polar diagnosis (he'd confirm himself in 2018).\n\nUnbeknownst to the public, in 2017, Kanye and Kid Cudi had been working on a joint album. In May, there was a cryptic news cycle around the report, to quote Fader, \"Kanye West Is Recording New Music On A Wyoming Mountain.\" Then the two flew out to Japan, in August, to meet and discuss cover art with former-Kanye collaborator and world-renowned artist Takashi Murakami. So even if the public didn't know the specifics of what was happening, behind the scenes there were sparks fanning to flames.\n\nAlmost a year to the date of Kanye's forced exit from the limelight, he met with Irv Gotti. Soon after, he'd meet with 7 Aurelius.\n\n7: We go to Energy Studios. Which is like Disney World. It is was amazing to see. You gotta take a picture of what you have on and give them your ID before you get in there, so they can see what everybody's fashion is. I actually had to run and get some food and come back—Ye wasn't there when we first got there. When I came back, they was laughing and telling a story about me, I could hear it, but the door was closed. When the door opened, it was Ye, like, \"Yo!\" It was the first time I'd seen him in years. It was all love.\n\nHis energy is through the roof. It was so dope. Kid Cudi was there. Mike Dean. People from the Yeezy staff. These gorgeous, gorgeous tall-ass speakers. One room was the music. He took us to another room that's like 200 sewing machines. He took us upstairs and is talking about amusement parks and a ride called \"Yeezus.\" It was phenomenal. It was like, \"This guy is amazing. He's really living his dream.\"\n\nWe play him all these records. He's jamming, he's grooving, but nothing is clicking. He's on this low, huge, like Greek-stone table. It's wide and long and just incredible. He was putting together a gold puzzle, a solid gold puzzle. Irv, and I looked at each like, \"Now is the time.\" Irv said, \"Yo, Sev's going to play you another record.\" I played \"Brothers.\" And when I say 'played,' I played it on the piano. It had all black keys. Almost everybody in the room cried. Ye was awe-struck. He still had one of the gold puzzle pieces in his hand as if he was going to put it somewhere and his mouth was wide open like, \"Oh shit!\"\n\nI'm like [singing], \"We'll be brothers forever, what happens to one of us happens to us together.\" And he's like, \"Oh man, we gotta do it again. This time we gotta record it. That's the one.\" Irv's grinning now, he's so fucking happy—I love to see Irv happy. But the second time, I fucked up twice. And Kanye was so into it he didn't care. But the thing was, he kept playing the version I fucked up. And he played it loud. And then more people were coming in. Sexy girls were coming in. Designers were coming in. The people showing him the new gums for his Yeezys were coming in. They'll all listening to it.\n\nHe played it so much. I said, \"Listen man. When I get back to my studio, I'll send you a version of 'Brothers' that's so dope. I'll make sure it's clean.\" He looked at me and said, \"Okay, yeah, yeah, cool. Play that again.\" Even the next day when I came back, he kept playing the one I fucked up, even though I sent him the clean one. He played it so much until it went from discomfort to self-love. Like, \"Yeah I fucked up, but imperfection is okay.\" He even reinforced it with the way he was singing. He'd be out of tune, and he don't care. I love that. And he taught me that.\n\nWith Kanye onboard, it's time for Seven to evolve \"Brothers\" to fit his dream collaborator's taste and style.\n\nIn a few months, BET would announce the renewal of Tales for a second season, premiering in 2019.\n\n2018: Music that instigates\n\nChris Stylez had the formal start to his career in 2008, with the release of his first single, \"Fade Away.\" His R&B singing captured the attention of Bad Boy Hitman Mario Winan—Winan wanted to sign Chris. And so Chris met Kevin Thomson. Both were from Toronto. Both were new to the professional music world. And both had a great reverence for the talented artists they were suddenly surrounded by. The two became friends.\n\nIn October 2017, Stylez attended a SOCAN (Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada) songwriting camp in Santorini, Greece. There, he worked with a few other attendees, including the Dutch artist Glen Faria, to create a \"'Jesus Walks'-type record.\" Back in Los Angeles, Chris isn't sure what to do with the record. It had a great response in Greece, but what now?\n\nJust after New Years, at the start of 2018, he decides to call one of Kevin's friends—7 Aurelius.\n\nWhen 7 answers the phone, he asks Chris, \"Did Kevin tell you to call me?\" Chris responds with, \"I just thought about you.\" But then 7 follows up: \"He didn't tell you I'm working on the new Kanye project? Me and Irv are seeing Ye tomorrow. Got anything for him?\"\n\nIrv's Caption [2/21/18]: Me with 7. JJ. Kanye. Juwan. Stay Tuned!! #TS2 #LOL\n\nChris: I send him the \"Love Songs\" demo record from Santorini, and by the time I get to the lobby of my studio 7 calls back saying, \"I need you to bring this to the studio—this is it!\" So that night I pull up at some penthouse in West Hollywood. Pure vibes. Killer view. I make myself some throat coat tea, and we get to work.\n\nNext day, they tell me Ye loves the record, don't play this for anyone. I'm like, \"Fuck, my first big placement is a Kanye record?!\" I get called a couple days later later, and it's to lay vocals for another song, \"Brothers.\" Cool. Still thinking I'm lit cause this makes song number two. Fast forward to a few weeks later, and I get a call from my big homie Bink at like 7 a.m. \"We finally got a record together!\" he says. I'm like, \"What are you talking about?\" He says, \"I just did the drums on 'Brothers' for Kanye.\"\n\nKevin: Kanye wanted a vibe. He wanted a certain vibe for him to spit on. 7 called me, \"I'm messing around with some stuff. I'm not getting there right now. You got any ideas?\" I told him, \"Call Bink.\" Bink and 7, have known each other a long time. They're different but they're the same. They're both funny guys. Smart guys. Super accomplished. Low-key. I was rocking with Bink when he did My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. He has an incredible history with Kanye so it only made sense.\n\nBink—otherwise known as Bink Dog, recently Bink! the Humble Monsta, originally Roosevelt Harrell III—is also, like 7, a highly-regarded producer in that 2000-2010 period. During that decade, Bink produced for Aaliyah, Diddy, Nate Dogg, Eve, Fat Joe, Beanie Sigel, LL Cool J, J Dilla, Joe Budden, and Rick Ross. As part of Roc-A-Fella, he did tracks for Jay-Z's The Dynasty and Blueprint. Capping it all off was the track \"Devil in a New Dress\" from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, often considered by Kanye fans to be in the running for the best Kanye song of all-time.\n\nBink: Me and 7 have a relationship. He called me one night and was like he had gotten with Kanye and played him this idea, this \"Brothers\" idea, this piano part that he had put down. But that's all it was, just pianos and Christ Stylez singing the reference. He said Kanye wanted some intergalatical, some kind of galaxy-trap thing for it. I was like, \"I don't know what that is, but I'm going with Graduation on this.\"\n\nKanye was one of my early brothers in the game. When he started coming around with Roc-A-Fella, he would ask me my advice on a few things, musically, what he should add, or what musician he could use. Stuff like that. We connected in that way. I only did one record with Kanye, first of all. And to have the impact it had, I've been dying to do another one. To see if we could revisit greatness again.\n\n7 sent me the reference, and I basically treated the reference like a sample and chopped it up. Put the drums on it. Put the bass on it. Structured it. There was another piece in there I took out altogether. Just kept the part with Chris Stylez voice. And it came out dope because it sounded like a loop.\n\nListening to the idea and knowing who it was, it made me turn the MPC on. I'm normally on Logic. But I wanted to make sure I captured that vibe, that old school vibe. It's actually the new MPC X I did it on. It definitely gave me that bounce I needed to get this out and get this right. The buzz base I put on it makes it feel aggressive, also. Keeps it constantly moving, like a high speed chase.\n\nI turned it over that night. I jumped right on it. If I hear a good sample, I'm gone. The chords 7 had laid down were dope. I told him it'd be dope if we could get Stevie Wonder on it, cause it's some Stevie Wonder type chords. If not Stevie Wonder, then maybe Glenn Lewis. Glenn Lewis is like the best Stevie Wonder tone-texture you can get without getting Stevie. His delivery is almost on the same level. But they ended up getting Charlie Wilson, which was dope. That's Uncle Charlie. Who doesn't want Uncle Charlie on the record? Hearing him was definitely refreshing.\n\n7: I have a few brothers I really reach out to when I'm in the weeds in terms of writer's block. One of them is Bink. Bink and I work well together. I was like, \"Yo Bink, I got this song. All the drums I'm doing aren't giving me the vibe. I know you worked with Ye on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. I feel like you can really add that vibe to this. He's like say no more. I sent it to him and he sent me back what he did. I did some things. I threw it back to him. He made some changes and it was right where it needed to be. And I loved it. Bink was a very instrumental part of bringing that Graduation vibe. Fans can thank him for that.\n\nChris is one of the greatest vocalists of our time. He's next. The song he and I have coming out called \"No Love\" is outta here. It's going to help cement my statement about him and how I feel about him.\n\nChris: Bink tells me he knew it was my voice when he heard the record, and was like, \"We gotta keep my man on the record,\" so he sampled my voice and they flipped the beat. The plan was to get Stevie Wonder on the record, too. Of course I'm like how the fuck did I end up as the sample on a Kanye West song, featuring Stevie Wonder, produced by 7 Aurelius, Irv Gotti, and Bink!? I'm dead.\n\nI get a few updates here and there. Ye is in Utah. He's going to Africa. Then he's heading to Wyoming to finish the album.\n\nApril of 2018, Kanye breaks his self-imposed exile and returns to Twitter. His vibe this time around remains the essence of unexpected, but the tone is often simple, philosophical, existential.\n\nWithin 10 days, the chaos returns, overshadowing the hype of the album announcements, as West posts a picture of himself crowned by a red Donald Trump \"Make America Great Again\" hat. A storm of controversy follows. Only a week later, with many thinking it can't get worse, Kanye appears on TMZ and there's even more fallout after he attempts to talk about slavery in America. It's pretty fair to say that Kanye, at this time, may have been the most talked about person in America. And a majority of it was critical.\n\nThe attention is immense enough that West, he'll eventually reveal in an interview with Big Boy, scrapped the album he was going to release on June 1st. Opting to, instead, start from scratch in the short time before the announced date.\n\nKanye to Big Boy: I completely re-did the album after TMZ.\n\nYou know, I feel like, as a son, and as a family member of the world...that's the reason why the world won't let me go because I'm just a family member. They might disagree with me, but I'm family.\n\n[The album] came from me just continually going against mass opinion, and I was able to find my voice—my voice—because, as you know, I started off with my voice. And this is what happens with a lot of artists: They start off with their voice and then they start having to do so many records for so many different people...and is this person going to be happy and is that person going to be happy? I just had to stand in front of that board every morning and ask myself, \"Do these songs truly make me happy?\"\n\nChris: Ye's album comes out. Im listening to the last song, \"Violent Crimes,\" and my mouth drops. It's \"Brothers,\" but not.\n\nKevin: I think it's better I not comment on that.\n\n7: We connected with Kanye again in February. Then I didn't hear from him until May or June. And that's when his album came out and I was like, \"I hope 'Brothers' is on this thing.\" And it wasn't. And I was like, \"Shit, what happened?\" Then I heard a song similar to \"Brothers.\" I'm thinking, \"Not only is that very similar to Brothers...that's me playing? What is going on?\"\n\nSo they call, \"Don't worry about it. It's Violent Crimes, you guys are producers on there. Congratulations and everything.\" I didn't want people to think Brothers is a copy of that. Then I was thinking to myself, \"Seven, remember this. Divine inspiration is not linear. Divine inspiration seeks out the useful vessel. hashtag, be useful. Relax.\"\n\nSo I just step back at this point. Now Irv, who originally made the deal for \"Brothers\" to be the premier for his new season, he's like, \"Yo...\" Put it like this, it took so long, Kanye had two babies during the time we were waiting. Bless the whole family! I'm just saying that's how long it took.\n\nChris: I get a call from Kevin and he's like come meet me at Om'Mas studio in Hollywood—Om'Mas Keith is another brilliant producer I know and respect. I get there and Kev tells me Kanye is sending new verses for \"Brothers\" and the song is still getting released. We on again! I then find out that \"Brothers\" is going to be the first original song used in Irv Gotti's scripted television series, Tales, and it's a two-hour premier episode on BET.\n\nIt's been almost two years since 7 wrote \"Brothers,\" and seven months since Irv's big bang meeting with Kanye. The long-time duo finally have the lyrics from Kanye and can finish preparing \"Brothers\" for the Tales premier.\n\nOn Instagram, Irv proudly posts his and 7's production credit on \"Violent Crimes.\" It must have been a tongue-in-cheek moment for the pair, as they and only a few others know about their real song with Kanye and its forthcoming world reveal. But there's one small detail in the photo they probably didn't think much of. If they noticed it at all, it was probably as a curiosity. Not the thing that, by all appearances, brought about the demise of \"Brothers.\"\n\nFour simple words: Please Gimme My Publishing.\n\n2019: Music that vanishes\n\n7: Kevin approached me, he's like, \"I have an amazing artist. I'm down here at Art Basel with him right now. He loves Brothers. He wants to do a painting on it, what do you think? Let's do it.\"\n\nKevin: The piece of art that 7 posted, the cover for \"Brothers.\" That red painting. Another client of mine, and an incredible artist, is Genesis the Greykid. Genesis is a poet. I met him when he was rapping. He started painting. Putting words on canvas. He's been doing that a few years now, and he's had incredible success. The art community picked up on it. He's become a fine artist and it's all rooted in his poetry and his words. I said to 7, \"Yo, let me send the old demos.\"\n\nGenesis: When I first heard \"Brothers,\" it was January of this year. There's this hotel I was staying in when I heard it, the Dwell Hotel. That shit is fly. It just gets the creative juices flowing. I was working on a commission piece for a friend I met in LA. That's when I got the call from Kev about checking that song out. He said, \"Hey, let me know what you think of this.\" He didn't load it down too much. After I heard it, he let me know who it was. \"Would you be down to do the artwork for it?\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, duh, of course!\"\n\nInitially, as I was hearing it, it was like some peaches and oranges and deep reds were the colors I saw. It was reminding not of a heart but something internal. Words, language, have an anatomy to it. Brothers is a sturdy word. I don't want to say regal. But it's sturdy. I thought about writing this whole poetic thing. Throwing different metaphors around to construct the word brothers. But I scratched that idea. I wanted \"Brothers\" to be able to hold its own weight. It doesn't need the other stuff.\n\nI went back 150 maybe 200 years and looked through all these different relationships whether they were blood brothers or brothers in spirit. There were some brothers like Du Bois and Booker T. They weren't brothers. They had a lot of arguments and they disagreed a lot in their political views. But they were kind of brothers in the same fight of equality and freedom, they just had two completely different ideas on how to make it happen. There were other brothers like Quincy Jones and Frank Sinatra. All the way up to Kanye West and Jay-Z. Seven and Gotti. The whole landscape of different types of brothers. That all came out of listening to the song. Going back and forth, back and forth, and having it play while I paint.\n\nIf all of those relationships through history, if they failed, then the word \"brothers\" wouldn't be so sturdy. A brother can check you. I got a brother and he calls me on my shit all the time. Cause sometimes I can fool myself. We all have this blind eye inside of us. No one can see themselves fully. It's very intimate to trust somebody to be in that sanctuary with you. You'll fight. But it's your brother.\n\nIt took at least a month. Sometimes you put the clothes on, you look in the mirror, you're like, \"Ehhhh.\" You walk to the store, you walk to the house, you take the clothes off. I actually have pictures of it in different stages. It was a lot lighter. It was like a beige. The names in the back were popping out too much. And I made it darker and darker and darker. It kind of takes time to get the clothes right.\n\nIt took me four or five days to get the canvas. But that gave me four or five days to go on some nice walks. And I went on some nice walks. Once I get the bullshit out of the way, through walking, that's when I can find the right place. As artists, a lot of times we can get in our own way. You can really overreach trying to put too much of yourself in something. You'll already be in it by being honest. It'll be the essence of you there but not enough to overshadow anything. I think that's when you can reach people.\n\nKevin: We didn't have anything with Kanye's lyrics. But the original song had the essence of the composition, cause the theme is very much, \"Why don't we call each other just to say hello?\" I think the essence of the original is the same as Kanye's verses on the actual song. Genesis does his thing, sends back the cover. Then we were kind of in a holding pattern.\n\nOn January 25th, The Hollywood Reporter breaks a story. \"Kanye West Sues Over His Song Publishing, Recording Contracts.\"\n\nTHR: Kanye West has filed a pair of lawsuits in what may be an attempt to extradite himself from contracts and reclaim control over his career. One lawsuit is against EMI, the song publisher that has administered the rights to his songs since 2003, shortly before the hip-hop star released his debut album, The College Dropout. The other is against Roc-a-Fella Records, UMG Recordings, Def Jam and Bravado International Group.\n\nIt might come as a shock, but Kanye has used the corporation Please Gimme My Publishing since 2004. There's a webpage for the 2005 BMI Urban Awards that lists the credits for award-nominee \"Jesus Walks.\" The involved parties: Miri Ben-Air, Curtis Lundy, Kanye West, Curwan Music Inc., EMI-Blackwood Music Inc., Mirimode Music, Please Gimme My Publishing Inc., Songs of Universal Inc., Kanye West, Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam Records. (Italics for emphasis of the parties involved in the lawsuit)\n\nKanye often talks about seeing into the future. For example, he said on his 2016 song, \"Saint Pablo,\" I can see a thousand years from now in real life/Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like. Maybe at age 27, at the turn of the century, on the brink of his major breakthrough as a solo artist, West chose the name Please Gimme My Publishing as nothing more than a self-aware joke at just how powerless artists were when it came to release and distribution. But as the years wore on, as the kid from Chicago became one of the most popular and critically acclaimed musicians of all-time, it's easy to imagine the innocent humor draining from the phrase. Especially with the revolution of the independent artist thanks to the boom of easy and prolific digital distribution options. Does an artist of Kanye's stature need a contract with a label?\n\nPrince, one of the artists Kanye admires most, said in a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, \"Record contracts are just like—I'm gonna say the word—slavery. I would tell any young artist...don't sign.\"\n\nFans have wondered if the lawsuit has been the thing that's prevented the release of Yandhi. Is Kanye, in his 40s now, refusing to put out music he doesn't own?\n\nWhile West is in the biggest legal battle of his life—Irv Gotti's ramping up the promotion for Tales season 2. On May 19th, he re-posts to Instagram the 2017 photo with Kanye.\n\nIrv's caption: Tales Season 2!!!!! July 2nd. Only on @bet #tales\n\nWe're less than two months away from the premier and it's still mostly unknown that Kanye's involved with Tales. But Irv can barely contain himself. In an interview on The Breakfast Club on June 5th, Irv announces that he can't announce who the huge artist is who did an original song for the season 2 premier. But then he drops hint after hint after hint until Kanye's name is guessed. All while Ja Rule is in complete disbelief.\n\nNote: at one point DJ Envy announces the new song is produced by by Irv Gotti, and Irv is quick to say, \"And 7, cause he'll get mad.\" Brothers know brothers.\n\nBetween June 13th and July 2nd, Irv made at least 20 Instagram posts relating to Kanye and Tales and \"Brothers.\" In the month since? Nothing.\n\nIt might be easy to chalk that up to marketing, right? \"Onto the next thing!\" But there's more to the story.\n\nAs fans clamored for the official release of \"Brothers,\" Irv said, in a now deleted tweet, he was doing his best to get the single out. He even put the full audio out on Instagram.\n\nIrv's caption: There is a lot of speculation right now on who is Kanye West rapping about on the song brothers. So here is the song. That BET cut off because of there way of airing episodes. But it was always meant for the audience to hear the whole record. Listen. And decide for your self if you think Kanye is rapping about Jay Z or Virgil. Both Ye's Brothers. And also let me know if you liked the episode and song. We did it for y'all. My hip hop culture. -IG\n\nWithin a day, the post was gone. And the others promoting it, taking pride in it, and telling everyone \"Brothers\" would come out? Deleted.\n\n7: We were within weeks of it coming out. BET and Viacom and everybody was super excited. Boom, it comes out. We sign the agreement. I'm noticing Def Jam hasn't signed up. It just has language, \"Upon Def Jam's approval. Upon Def Jam's approval. Upon Def Jam's approval.\" I'm like, uh-oh. You can own the master but it don't matter if it's not available.\n\nI think to myself, \"At least it'll be out for the people.\"\n\nIt comes out—sonic booms across the planet. They were so starving for this version of Ye that it was like heaven. It was heaven for me to see people have their vibrations raised so high. I received so many e-mails, texts, direct messages on IG about the song. \"It made me reach out to someone and we're cool now.\" That was a common message I was getting because of this record.\n\nOne week goes by and nothing. Two weeks go by and nothing. It's like if Michael Jackson had recorded \"We Are the World,\" shot a video for it, debuted the video, then not made it available for people to get it. It was the most ridiculous thing. It just doesn't make sense.\n\nWhile Irv is silent, 7 goes full-Kanye, taking to Instagram Live to decry Def Jam for holding the song \"captive.\" He says, \"The Universe did not give me this song for it to be tied up in some Corporation like Def Jam. This song was written [to] heal relationships, open dialogue and bring people together!!! join me in supporting this song in all of its forms of release. someone needs this out there!!! I know I do.\"\n\nA day later, 7 deletes the post and replaces it with a new one, much different in tone. He explained to me:\n\n7: Melanie was like, \"What are you doing? You're going to disrupt relationships. They're going to sue you. You better take it down. You said you're going to put out the vocals.\" And I'm like, \"I'm not coming at Ye. Melanie, are you crazy? I would never do that. I didn't say I was going to put out the vocals. I'm listening to it right now. Ah shit...I said I was going to put out the vocals. But I meant the background vocals I did! Not his.\" So I realized the energy's changing and I needed to get out of that energy. So the post's taken down.\n\nMelanie: The complications only really required people to be communicative. Two very, very talented artists just needed to communicate and the song caused them to communicate. Because the song serves as a bridge to brotherhood. This often doesn't happen.\n\nKanye is working on his next album. He's in the process of doing that. And 7 is working on a new album as a solo artist himself.\n\n7 owns the masters. He can do whatever he wants with the master. He can re-record the record. He has the song in its original format. He has the ability to put another artist on it, if he so chooses to do so. Kanye's version is absolutely stunning and the response by the fans has been incredible. People are clamoring for it. We've received so many phone calls and people sending e-mails and contacting privately on various forms of messaging to see how they could get the single and Kanye's version of the single.\n\n7: When people hear my version, it's beautiful, gorgeous. I'm thankful that Kanye didn't do two things. I'm happy he kept \"Jesus Walks\" for himself. And I'm happy he didn't go with \"Brothers\" as a single. I believe it's going to be one of the hallmarks of my career as an artist. That's Source Energy at work. You don't even know the level of assists the Creator has for you. You just gotta step and get out of the way and trust the process. Even when I came out on my IG and was like the Creator didn't give me the song to be in Def Jam's archives. I meant that, man. I'm here to raise vibrations. When it's all said and done by biggest mission is to give more than I take. If I do that than I know my soul score will be well beyond passing and I can go to the next plane of existence. This is just what I believe.\n\nMelanie: Kanye West and 7 Aurelius are both agents of change and men of tomorrow. They're both Geminis.\n\n7: I get a call from my guy BJ, who is like the buffer between me and Irv. Irv and I have realized we need a buffer so I don't have any passionate artist tweets at him that'll piss him off and vice-versa. So BJ calls me and says Kanye's main manager wants to talk. He gets on the phone. Couldn't have been a nicer guy. First thing he says, \"We just want to let you know that me and Ye totally respect you. We understand your passion, we understand everything about what you're saying as far as knowing the song's going to raise vibrations and not wanting to stand in the way. We don't want to stand in the way. But at the same time we don't want to be force to released music. We have a project. We're working on Yandhi right now.\"\n\nI was like, \"Listen, first of all thank you for reaching out. I couldn't love Ye any more. He really inspired me to get back to this. I hope you guys do something with 'Brothers' in the future. I'm going to do something with now. It's going to come out. And the name of the album is B Jeezus. And it's spelled like Yeezus.\" And he's like, \"All good, all good.\" I took the thing down, he said thank you for taking it down.\n\nSo now I've been holed up in my studio with Kevin Elliot, finishing my album. It's really incredible. It's my first album. It's bringing different elements. My instinct as a hitmaker is always there. I know what this needs to be, but I'm also a fan. I understand Kanye's fans, because I'm a fan.\n\nI understand if Prince had come out with anything, bootleg or anything, I was devouring it. If it was an instrumental of something he worked on—anything. I understand what giving everyone something like \"Brothers\" means. It's like if Prince was doing The Gold Experience album then all the sudden releases something that sounds like it's off of 1999, or Purple Rain, or Sign of the Times, and you're like, \"Oh shit he's back! That's the version of him I loved!\" Then he doesn't make it available. It's that type of experience for the fan.\n\nI am very, very pro-fan because I am a fan. I know what that means, so I'm going to make sure I deliver this.\n\nThis whole thing was kind of like...going back to the genesis of why I wrote \"Brothers\".... I was going through it with a couple of my brothers. These were people who were very close to me who I hadn't spoken to in a while. That's why the first lyric is [reading]:\n\n\"What's it take to call your brother? Just to say you miss them and wish you could spend time. What's so serious you just can't pick up the phone? Tell him that you love him and he's been on your mind. Tell him you need your brother. Ask him how he's doing and say you've been doing fine. If there comes a point where you don't know what to say while you still have him on the line just say we'll be brothers forever. What happens to one of us...\"\n\n[There's a long pause]\n\nI'm sorry.\n\n[You can tell there are tears]\n\n\"...happens to us together.\"\n\n[Another pause]\n\nIt just takes me back to that time.\n\nEpilogue\n\nAs of right now (August 2019), there is no update on the fate of the Kanye version of \"Brothers.\"\n\n7 has teased the first single for his debut album, B Jeezus. The single is \"No Love,\" the earlier-mentioned collaboration with Chris Stylez. The art for the song was done by Genesis. The release date for the album has not been announced.\n\nBink hosts Beat Sparring events, pitting producer against producer in front of a live crowd.\n\nFortune reported in June that Kanye and EMI had returned to court following a failure to reach a settlement. In March, EMI had countersued West for breach of contract. The article ends with, \"He is also seeking release from his recording contract with Roc-a-Fella Records, UMG Recordings, Def Jam, and Bravado International Group. That case is pending.\"\n\nYandhi is still a mystery.\n\nIrv Gotti passed on the opportunity to participate in the story.\n\nDef Jam never responded to a request for comment.\n\nAnd Kanye West could not be reached.\n\nCorrection: The article had previously spelled ‘Big Boy’ as ‘Big Boi.’"
