        "text": "The golden gramophone for Producer Of The Year, Non-Classical is perhaps the ultimate accolade for anyone whose talents are best served behind a mixing desk. Phil Ramone, Rick Rubin, and Max Martin are just a few of the legendary behind-the-scenes names who've received the coveted award since it was added to the ceremony in 1975. But winners such as Pharrell Williams, Mark Ronson, and Stevie Wonder have also proven that the Recording Academy are open to honoring those who can take center stage, too.\n\nThis year's crop have undoubtedly all been pivotal to the pop, rock and hip-hop landscapes of the past 12 months. Two-time winner Jack Antonoff continued on his mission to conquer the charts for all of eternity by joining forces with two of his superstar regular cohorts, while first-time nominee Daniel Nigro helped not just one but two teen stars parlay their early success into adulthood.\n\nHit-Boy and Metro Boomin both vied for the title of hardest-working rap producer with an exhausting list of credits. At the other end of the scale, D'Mile, focused most of his attention on just one burgeoning talent.\n\nHere's a closer look at the nominees for Producer Of The Year at the 2024 GRAMMYs.\n\nJack Antonoff\n\nJack Antonoff will be hoping to replicate Babyface's mid-'90s dominance by becoming only the second-ever artist to win the Producer Of The Year, Non-Classical GRAMMY three times in a row. The pop maestro is on the cusp of history thanks to fruitful working relationships with two of the era's most prolific female singer-songwriters.\n\nAntonoff has been recognized for co-producing the entirety of Taylor Swift's Midnights, the dreamlike concept album which spawned a record-breaking 10 U.S. Top 10 singles in the same week including Lana Del Rey collaboration \"Snow on the Beach.\" The latter's equally alluring Did You Know There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd also benefited from Antonoff's magic touch on all but three of its 16 tracks including a guest appearance from his own alt-pop outfit Bleachers.\n\nAntonoff's production empire further grew this year when he entered the studio with another Swift-adjacent (albeit briefly) act, The 1975, for their fifth LP, Being Funny In A Foreign Language. But despite his chart ubiquity, the New Jersey native insists he has little interest in courting the mainstream.\n\n\"I do think that there's a misconception about what I do and what pop music is,\" he told The Face in September. \"There's a certain group of people who think it's about appealing to the masses, [which is] not how I feel. I've never made anything hoping that everyone would like it.\"\n\nAlongside his own individual accolades, Antonoff has previously shared GRAMMYs with his first band fun. (Best New Artist, Song of the Year for \"We Are Young\") Swift (Album of the Year for both 1989 and Folklore), and St. Vincent (Best Rock Song for \"Masseduction\" and Best Alternative Music Album for Daddy's Home).\n\nBut proving that all the awards glory hasn't gone to his head, Antonoff dedicated much of his acceptance speech last year to the unsung hero who joined him on stage: \"I sit in the studio all day with one person — this is Laura, who engineers and mixes the records with us. We just sit there all f—ing day. We were there yesterday, we'll be there tomorrow, and this is all completely for Laura.\"\n\nDernst \"D'Mile\" Emile II\n\nWhile last year's nomination came for his work with a modern R&B legend, Mary J. Blige, this year's is courtesy of a relatively new diva on the block.\n\nDernst Emile II, a.k.a. R&B/hip-hop producer D'Mile took the production reins on 10 of the 11 tracks on Victoria Monét's long-awaited full-length debut Jaguar II. The lush melting pot of disco, dancehall, funk, and soul firmly established the Ariana Grande hitmaker as a star in her own right.\n\nIt certainly lived up to the expectations that D'Mile, who also worked on Monét's Jaguar EP, put forward to GRAMMY.com last year: \"We dug a little deeper. She is an artist that I feel really comfortable with. There might be a couple of songs that you wouldn't expect from her, and then there are songs that are just incredible records.\"\n\nOf course, D'Mile has already made GRAMMY history having become the first-ever songwriter to pick up consecutive Song Of The Year awards, first winning with H.E.R.'s \"I Can't Breathe\" and then with Silk Sonic's \"Leave the Door Open.\"\n\nD'Mile sadly didn't get to accept the former in person due to COVID-19 protocols. But thankfully, the hitmaker did get to join Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak on stage for the latter where he dedicated the award to his late Haitian vocalist mother Yanick Étienne (the same Philly soul throwback also picked up Record Of The Year and Best R&B Song).\n\nWhen asked about his pioneering feat by Vulture, D’Mile still appeared to be in a state of shock: \"Man, these past two — even three — years have been just a wild ride for me. I definitely didn't expect to set a record. Even when I heard that it was possible, I was like, Wow, really? No one's ever done that? It's just wild to me that I'm at the GRAMMYs, let alone winning...\"\n\nD'Mile better get used to the feeling. The New Yorker was also victorious at the 2022 GRAMMYs thanks to his contributions on Lucky Daye's Best Progressive R&B Album Table for Two. And this second consecutive nod suggests it's only a matter of time before Producer of the Year - Non-Classical is added to the trophy cabinet that also includes an Academy Award for Best Original Song.\n\nHit-Boy\n\nFrom Ty Dolla $ign and Big Sean to Travis Scott and ASAP Rocky — name pretty much any major hip-hop star of the last 20 years and there's a good chance Chauncey Alexander Hollis Jr., a.k.a. Hit-Boy, has given them some audacious beats.\n\nThe Californian already has three GRAMMY Awards to his name, having co-produced Kanye West and Jay-Z's \"N— in Paris,\" showcased his own lyrical flow on Nipsey Hussle's \"Racks in the Middle,\" and worked on all 13 tracks on Nas' King's Disease.\n\nHit-Boy's prolific new partnership with the latter rap god has undoubtedly helped him pick up a second Producer Of The Year, Non-Classical GRAMMY nomination, specifically his work on the two Magic sequels and King's Disease III. Likewise, his production skills on Dreamville's \"Just Face It\" and Don Toliver's \"Bus Stop.\"\n\nBut the aptly-named beatmaker has also been celebrated for his own headlining efforts, including the Surf and Drown mixtape, the Alchemist collaboration \"Slipping Into Darkness,\" and the Victims and Villains LP recorded alongside nu-soul crooner Musiq Soulchild, all of which arrived within the space of just three months.\n\nHit-Boy's work schedule may sound truly exhausting, but as he told GRAMMY.com in 2020, the star thrives on keeping busy: \"It's too many artists trying to tap in for me to just work on one thing at a time, but I still am able to give my focus. It's like quantity and quality. I don't know how to explain it right now.\"\n\nAnd Hit-Boy will certainly be appreciative if it proves to be second time lucky. Discussing his first Producer of the Year nod, he told Variety, \"It would definitely be a dream come true … Just to be recognized is amazing, but to win? That would be major, man. Just for the people that have followed my story and know how much I've stayed down, that would be major.\"\n\nMetro Boomin\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, considering he's been behind Hot 100 No.1s by Migos and The Weeknd, trap genius Metro Boomin is the only Producer Of The Year, Non-Classical nominee this year without a GRAMMY already to his name. In fact, he's only ever received one nomination — Album of the Year for his sole contribution to Coldplay's Music of the Spheres.\n\nCould 2024 be the year this changes? Well, it wouldn't be for the want of trying. The man born Leland Tyler Wayne has laid down beats for everyone from Travis Scott (\"Til Further Notice\") and Lil Durk (\"War Bout It\") to Drake (\"More M's\") and Young Thug (\"Oh U Went\") over the period of eligibility.\n\nAnd like his fellow studio wizard Hit-Boy, Metro Boomin has also been recognized for his own material including his Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse cuts \"Am I Dreaming\" and \"Calling,\" and three tracks from his sophomore Heroes and Villains (\"Creepin',\" \"Superhero,\" and \"Trance\"),\n\nLuckily, the St. Louis native seems likely to take it in his stride if he once again misses out on a golden gramophone. Metro Boomin was seen as a shoo-in for the 2018 Producer Of The Year category but the award went to Greg Kurstin. The hitmaker told Billboard, \"You know, we don't be tripping off stuff like that. We just keep it moving, man … I'm just here to service the people. As long as that happens what I do, that's really all that what matters to me.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean Boomin believes he's unworthy of the accolade, though, with the star recently telling Ebony, \"I knew I was here to stay before I even really got here, because I knew how much time I was putting into this…..I'm always trying to outdo myself. This is one of the first times in my career that I can really feel the ascension; I can feel something happening, and I'm well aware of it.\"\n\nDaniel Nigro\n\nMid-2000s emo rock outfit As Tall as Lions might not have got anywhere near the most prestigious night on the music industry calendar. But frontman Daniel Nigro is now racking up the GRAMMY nominations as one of the go-to guys for Gen-Z.\n\nAll four of the New Yorker's previous nods were for his work with Disney Channel graduate Olivia Rodrigo, including the Best Pop Album category in which Sour reigned supreme. But in his first Producer Of The Year, Non-Classical showing, Nigro has also been acknowledged for collaborating with some other cool names.\n\nThat includes Chappell Roan, the dark-pop singer-songwriter who called on Nigro to produce the entirety of her debut album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess. Irish troubadour Dermot Kennedy (\"Divide\") and former Chairlift vocalist Caroline Polachek (\"Welcome To My Island\") have also helped the one-time jingle writer to build a GRAMMY-worthy discography over the past 12 months.\n\nOf course, it's Nigro's second effort with Rodrigo, Guts, that may best put him in contention for the big prize. He produced and co-wrote all 12 tracks on the pop-punk chart-topper, a committed approach he told Billboard is far preferable to being a songwriter-for-hire: \"I know I'm definitely a pop producer [now], but I think I struggled a long time with that whole, 'You're part of a record' … I never felt satisfied doing just a song or two with an artist. I always felt detached. I come from a world where when something happens I want to call you up and celebrate the wins and vent about the losses and be a part of it [all].\"\n\nNigro seems keen to continue guiding the careers of those young enough to be his kids. \"I think it's just about being honest and talking about what's going on in their lives,\" Nigro replied when asked by Vulture what he admires about artists such as Rodrigo and Conan Gray.\n\n\"I think in their generation, something that they gravitate towards is the specificity of lyrics and honesty, which is always interesting,\" he continued to Vulture. \"Whereas our generation was much more about metaphor and vagueness in lyrics, something that's left for interpretation, you know? It seems this generation is much more into something that's right on the nose.\"\n\nThe 2024 GRAMMYs, officially known as the 66th GRAMMY Awards, returns to Los Angeles' Crypto.com Arena on Sunday, Feb. 4, 2024, and will broadcast live on the CBS Television Network and stream live and on-demand on Paramount+ at 8-11:30 p.m. ET/5-8:30 p.m. PT.\n\nThe Recording Academy and GRAMMY.com do not endorse any particular artist, submission or nominee over another.

Held Aug. 1-4, the international festival’s flagship midwest iteration showcased a variety of talent — both revered and rising.\n\nAmong Lolla 2024's highlights, Chappell Roan drew an expectedly enormous crowd to Grant Park on Thursday, while GRAMMY winner Tyla captivated audiences with a lighthearted and entertaining anglicism. Friday offered a diversity of artists, from K-pop boy group Stray Kids, to electronic vet Zedd and GRAMMY-winning Icelandic jazz singer Laufey, who performed with the Chicago Philharmonic. J-pop stars YOASOBI and the Killers closed the festival on Saturday, and Blink-182 brought their ‘90s humor and hits to the main stage on Sunday.\n\nLollapalooza founder Perry Farrell was onhand in a rare sighting to partake in the weekend’s festivities, which in addition to various stages featured Toyota Music Den’s retro summer camp vibes, Coke Studio’s roller rink, House of Dunkin’s newly renovated setup and Kidzapalooza for the festival’s youngest attendees.\n\nThough thunderstorms threatened throughout the weekend, it only materialized as light rain and was a welcome reprieve from the balmy temperatures.

The singer delivered some of her biggest hits — from \"Cannibal\" and \"Die Young,\" to \"Take It Off,\" and \"Your Love Is My Drug\" — in front of her most loyal fans at Lolla. While performing \"Backstabber\" from 2010's Animal, Kesha and her scantily-clad male dancers doused themselves in fake blood while the star herself brandished a knife as a prop. Kesha later revealed on X that the knife shockingly turned out to be real.\n\nIn addition to her theatrical dramatics, Kesha also played a clip of Vice President Kamala Harris saying \"You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?\" as she began \"Blow\" (Kesha brought out a marching band for the song as well). \"Women do run this country,\" Kesha told the crowd, proudly standing in her power.\n\nWhen she wasn’t waving pride flags and encouraging onlookers to \"support local drag, Kesha paused to thank her fans for \"standing by me through the hardest time of my entire life.\"\n\nRead more: Kesha Reveals The 10 Most Important Songs Of Her Career, From \"Tik Tok\" To \"Eat The Acid\"\n\nMegan Thee Stallion Got The Hotties In Formation\n\nThree-time GRAMMY winner Megan Thee Stallion was tapped by the festival as one of the headliner’s after Tyler, The Creator pulled out of his slot earlier this year. The rapper, however, proved she was no \"second best.\"\n\nFresh off of her performance at Vice President Kamala Harris’ Atlanta campaign rally, Megan Thee Stallion feverishly got her fans in formation with a spectacular performance. Donning a sexy, sequined pink ensemble, the Houston rapper plowed through a bevy of hits including: \"Freak Nasty,\" \"Cobra,\" \"Big Ole Freak,\" \"Mamushi\" and \"WAP.\"\n\nShe also addressed haters who were upset about her supporting Harris last month. \"They was fake mad that I was popping it for Kamala. I don’t think they heard what she said,\" Meg explained. \"Kamala said she wants a ceasefire. Kamala said she supports women’s rights. Kamala said y’all tired of high gas prices. Kamala said ‘I’m for the people.’\" She shouted out \"Hotties for Harris\" before being surprised by Chicago Sky star Angel Reese onstage who took a selfie with the \"Savage\" artist.\n\nRead more: 6 Takeaways From Megan Thee Stallion's 'Megan': Snakes, Shots & Self-Assurance\n\nDeftones Appeased Every Metalhead In Attendance\n\nDeftones — the GRAMMY-winning rock facet from Sacramento, California — have For spent three decades perfecting their gnarly guitar riffs, airy vocals and thunderous percussion. Their most recent project, 2020's Ohms, served as a sauntering exploration of frontman Chino Moreno’s inner workings. This energy was on full display at Lollapalooza 2024.\n\nThe band’s electrifying energy was gleefully absorbed by the crowd, who moshed through heavier tracks such as \"Lotion\" and \"My Own Summer (Shove It).\" The audience was slightly more still but visibly bubbling over for slower, more sensual tunes like \"Digital Bath\" and \"Change (In The House of Flies).\"\n\nMoreno — who said onstage he chipped his tooth during \"Needles and Pins,\" from the band's self-titled 2003 LP — proved his performer prowess again and again. Even beyond the T-Mobile, Lolla attendees could feel the infectiousness of Deftones’ stellar set.\n\nLearn more: 5 Essential Nu-Metal Albums: How Slipknot, Korn, Deftones & Others Showcased Adolescent Rage With A Dramatic Flair\n\nFuture x Metro Boomin Injected More Energy Into An Already Lively Crowd\n\nDespite being 45 minutes late to their headlining set on Saturday, Future and Metro Boomin delivered a vigorous performance that celebrated their collaborative albums We Don’t Trust You (released in March) and We Still Don’t Trust You (which dropped a month later).\n\nThe pair ferociously fed off of each other’s energy, while simultaneously injecting that same enthusiasm into the crowd. From \"Luv Bad Bitches\" to \"Type S—,\" \"F— Up Some Commas\" to \"Low Life,\" there were no shortage of hits to feed the insatiable musical appetite of the packed crowd at the Bud Light stage.\n\nFans eagerly threw up two fingers in honor of Future's Dirty Sprite 2, per instructions from the duo, and Future x Metro Boomin Young Thug when \"Relationship\" played. \"Like That\" lost its potency when it was started for a second time as an attempt to reinvigorate the audience — but remained a thrilling track from beginning to end. The chemistry between Future x Metro Boomin was off the charts and seamlessly translated onstage.\n\nRead more: Metro Boomin's Essential Songs: 10 Must-Know Tracks, From \"Creepin\" To \"Like That\"\n\nSiR Savors \"Summer\" With Sensual R&B Set\n\nThe Inglewood, California-based R&B singer used his time at Lollapalooza to reconnect with a city he hasn't performed in for nearly five years. On Sunday, the R&B crooner glided through his discography, performing \"Karma\" (from his March 2024 album Heavy) to \"John Redcorn\" — a track from his 2020 release Chasing Summer.\n\nSiR, who was dripping in sweat from the intense Chicago heat, slowed things down a bit to celebrate his collaborators. First, he gleefully welcomed singer Zacari for \"Mood\" followed by his brother Davion Farris for \"The Recipe.\" SiR’s bravado shined brightly on \"Hair Down\" where he felt his most confident, his most rambunctious, his most seen. He appeased fans’ requests for \"D’Evils\" and got emotional when reflecting on his struggles.\n\nSiR has been candid about his journey to sobriety — a major theme on Heavy — and thanked his fans for their support throughout his set. When SiR performed \"Life Is Good,\" he reminded attendees that nothing is sweeter than a well-earned victory lap.\n\nRead more: On 'Heavy,' SiR Wants People To See The Weight Of His Humanity\n\nCarmen DeLeon Basked In Being A Total Ray Of Sunshine\n\nThe 23-year-old Venezuelan singer smiled from ear to ear as she enthusiastically gave her all during a short but powerful performance on Sunday at the BMI stage. She kicked off things with two of her most notable tracks: 2022’s \"Mala Memoria\" and \"Mariposas\" (which was released the year prior). DeLeon was effervescent during \"Wonderful,\" with its catchy chorus being as bright and brilliant as she was.\n\nDeLeon became visibly emotional while paying homage to Lady Gaga and her BMI stage legacy by covering \"Always Remember Us This Way\" from the A Star is Born soundtrack. She attached her native flag to the mic stand and emphasized the importance of speaking up against injustice, which hit especially close to home for her given the unrest following recent elections in Venezuela.\n\nDeLeon quickly switched gears and tackled the complex nature of love with \"El Vecino.\" Though the singer is longing to be noticed on the track, its live rendition feels more empowering than dejected. One of the show’s most heartwarming moments came when the singer brought her clearly proud dad onstage.\n\nBenson Boone Backflipped His Way Into The Hearts Of Fans\n\nMoments after viral TikTok sensation Benson Boone took the stage at Lolla, he shared that this was the first U.S. music festival he has ever performed at. The former \"American Idol\" contestant used his performance on the IHG Resorts & Resorts stage to sing — and backflip — his way into the hearts of fans.\n\nBoone's performance ranged in both sound and emotion. The singer basked in the sweetness of \"Coffee Cake\" from his 2023 album PULSE, then dug deeper with a formidable performance of \"What Was.\" Before going into \"My Greatest Fear,\" the singer shared that he is terrified of being alone and was devastated by the passing of his grandmother.\n\nHe used \"Friend\" as a springboard to talk about the importance of camaraderie and, before launching into \"Beautiful Things,\" shared amazement at how one song dramatically changed his life.\n\nRead more: Benson Boone Declares \"Beautiful Things\" Is No Fluke: \"I've Tapped Into How I'll Write For The Rest Of My Life\"\n\nLatest Music Festival News\n\nWhen it comes to exploring Lana Del Rey's discography, it can be hard to know where to start. The pop songstress has a sprawling catalog, consisting of nine albums, four EPs, and a handful of other standalone singles.\n\nYou could begin with Born To Die, her highly influential major label debut, or its moody follow-up, Ultraviolence, her first to top the Billboard charts and ultimately establish her staying power as an artist. Perhaps you choose to start with her Album Of The Year GRAMMY nominees Norman F—ing Rockwell! or Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd.\n\nOr maybe you're an incredibly diehard fan with encyclopedic knowledge who wants to start where it all began, on Rey's first album Lana Del Ray (note the spelling difference), which never saw official physical release and contained just a rough draft of the cultural force Del Rey would become.\n\nFollowing Del Rey's career is rewarding, but requires some commitment to listen to, and understand, everything she's put out. It can be intimidating to approach an artist with such a robust, varied catalog. You can go with more mainstream pop offerings like her collaborations with Taylor Swift and The Weeknd, or dive into something more inspired by the orchestra like early track \"National Anthem.\" This is true for fans with any amount of exposure to Del Rey, from those just discovering her music to those looking to become an expert.\n\nAs Ultraviolence turns 10, GRAMMY.com presents the levels of Lana, a series of jumping off points to explore all the music Del Rey has to offer. Dig into three songs across four different levels of fandom — Beginner, Intermediate, Expert, and Diehard — to further your Lana knowledge. These songs give a peek into various aspects of Del Rey's body of work, and serve as encouragement to continue exploring.\n\nBeginner\n\n\"Summertime Sadness,\" Born to Die (2012)\n\nThe Beginner Level of Lana is for those who have heard of Del Rey, but have never sat down with her music before. This makes \"Summertime Sadness,\" her biggest song to date, the perfect place to start.\n\nIt's reductive to simply label Del Rey's oeuvre \"sad girl music,\" but for the uninitiated, it's a simple descriptor to start with. \"Summertime Sadness\" combines the pop production, elements of classical music, and existential despair that is present throughout Del Rey's career. And Cedric Gervais' remix has turned \"Summertime Sadness\" into a club banger to help her appeal to those who gravitate more to the dance floor.\n\n\"Young and Beautiful,\" The Great Gatsby: Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film (2013)\n\nIt speaks to Del Rey's cultural reach and musical vision that a non-album single is one of her most iconic songs. Written for the 2013 The Great Gatsby movie adaptation, \"Young and Beautiful\" also serves as a helpful thematic introduction to Del Rey.\n\nThroughout her writing, Del Rey examines youth, Americana, and the American Dream, and how each of these uniquely American ideals are full of decay and liable to corruption and disappointment. On \"Young and Beautiful,\" she asks if her lover will still care when she's no longer either of those things, and the somber tone indicates the likely answer. This song will introduce fans to Del Rey's penchant for using orchestral backing for her music, and illustrate how intertwined with popular culture she really is.\n\n\"Mariners Apartment Complex,\" Norman F—ing Rockwell! (2019)\n\nThe past two songs have introduced Del Rey's \"sad girl\" persona, but over the years, she has evolved far past being so easily defined. \"Mariners Apartment Complex\" is the perfect next step for beginners, opening up the popular perception to her to reveal more of her complexity.\n\nLyrically, it finds Del Rey pushing back on sorrow being her only emotion. Musically, it's a great introduction to more of the ethereal, synth-filled sound that has come out of her partnership with superproducer Jack Antonoff. And in terms of placing her within the culture, \"Mariners Apartment Complex\" is the first single from her sixth album Norman F—ing Rockwell!, which earned Del Rey her first Album Of The Year nomination in 2019.\n\nIntermediate\n\n\"Brooklyn Baby,\" Ultraviolence (2014)\n\nAt the Intermediate level, it's time to start getting into more of the nuances that Del Rey brings to her writing — and, in turn, how much she's influenced her peers, and how respected she is amongst them.\n\n\"Brooklyn Baby\" is some of her sharpest writing, equal parts playful needling and affectionate tribute to the snooty New York art scene. One of the most indelible tracks off of Ultraviolence, the song epitomizes the entire record's move towards more rock instrumentation, with a guitar-based sound. It references legendary rock artist Lou Reed, who was slated to appear on the track before his death in late 2013, showing just how highly she's thought of by other artists.\n\n\"Love,\" Lust for Life (2017)\n\nFor as much as Del Rey recognizes how fallible many of our culture's ideals are, she's always been a romantic. \"Love,\" the first single from 2017's Lust for Life, is a prime example of this.\n\nThe whole album is a big play on her love of classic Hollywood imagery, including the video for \"Love,\" and the song is a dreamy throwback to '50s love songs. If \"Mariners Apartment Complex\" chides anyone thinking Del Rey can only be sad, \"Love\" is a full rebuke, as it's one of her most straightforwardly optimistic tracks. Commercially, \"Love\" was Del Rey's highest-charting feat since Ultraviolence (landing at No. 44 on the Billboard Hot 100), further establishing that she had longevity.\n\n\"Chemtrails over the Country Club,\" Chemtrails over the Country Club (2021)\n\n2020 and the pandemic did a number on everyone, radically altering lives and shaking faith in many of the institutions of everyday life. That unmooring is felt on Del Rey's seventh album, Chemtrails over the Country Club, and particularly on its title track.\n\nDel Rey is as sharp as ever in exploring the pulse of American society on the dreamy, disaffected number. \"You're in the wind, I'm in the water/ Nobody's son, nobody's daughter\" is a breathtaking piece of writing that became a TikTok favorite, illustrating Del Rey's continuing ability to relate to the youth.\n\nExpert\n\n\"F—ed My Way Up To the Top,\" Ultraviolence (2014)\n\nAs we enter the realm of the Expert Lana Del Rey fan, we're firmly out of album singles territory. From here, it's all deep cuts and non-album tracks.\n\nDel Rey has been no stranger to controversy — some warranted, some not. An early knock against her was that the mid-20th century aesthetic and perceived submissiveness in her music was anti-women or anti-feminist, a surface-level reading that in the years since has been largely dispelled.\n\nThe singer has worked to combat it herself on tracks like Ultraviolence's \"F—ed My Way Up To the Top,\" which takes that perceived notion to its extreme. At the same time, it's another in a long line of tracks in which Del Rey has embraced her own sexuality and sensuality as something to be celebrated and claimed, not something to be ashamed of.\n\n\"Art Deco,\" Honeymoon (2015)\n\n2015's Honeymoon isn't necessarily underappreciated, as it received positive reviews upon release debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, but \"Art Deco\" isn't likely to appear on many playlists. It should, though, as the track illustrates how much of musical chameleon Del Rey really is, with a sultry, hip-hop inspired rolling beat.\n\nIt treads some familiar territory thematically with trying to find acceptance in night life, but Del Rey is really comfortable here. She shows more of her knowledge of art history by relating the subject of the song to the defining characteristics of the titular art movement, revealing just how much thought she puts into her aesthetic.\n\n\"Fingertips,\" Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd (2023)\n\nDid you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd is arguably Del Rey's most intimate album, exploring details of her family and their history that fans have only previously seen brief glimpses of. At the same time, it is partially an examination of her own legacy and work, only natural for someone with as much output as Del Rey, let alone her frequent references to death and finality.\n\nBoth of these things combine in \"Fingertips,\" a standout track from the album. A nearly six-minute long ballad, it's musically airy while emotionally devastating — and, for a true Del Rey fan, encapsulates so much of her legacy in just one song.\n\nDiehard\n\n\"Yayo,\" Paradise (2012)\n\nFor fans in the Diehard level, everything before is old news. This is for fans who want to fully live the Lana life, who have all her albums on vinyl and have carefully built their image and fashion around her.\n\nSpeaking of her image, this section starts with \"Yayo,\" an extremely early deep cut. This track originally appeared on Lana Del Ray before being reworked and rereleased on the Paradise EP in 2012. The song leans heavier than most into the '50s imagery and floats along at a dreamy, lilting pace. While not as refined as her later work, \"Yayo\" is an indicator Del Rey had a solid idea of who she wanted to be as soon as she started.\n\n\"Season of the Witch,\" Non-album Single (2019)\n\nDel Rey has done several covers throughout her career, and quite successfully. Norman F—ing Rockwell! features her cover of Sublime's \"Doin' Time,\" which is one of the highlight tracks from the record. Less known is Del Rey's spooky cover of '60s classic \"Season of the Witch.\"\n\nWritten for the 2019 horror film Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, the song fits Del Rey's style perfectly. The Americana/flower crown aesthetic of her younger years always leaned witch-adjacent, and Del Rey takes her soft vocals into playfully sinister territory. It's a fun cover, and shows just how many gems Del Rey has in her discography for those fans willing to dig.\n\n\"Say Yes to Heaven,\" Non-album Single (2023)\n\n\"Say Yes to Heaven\" was never supposed to be heard. A late cut from Ultraviolence, the track remained buried for years before being leaked in 2016. It lurked on the internet, only known to superfans, before gaining steam with the rise of TikTok and finally seeing an official release in 2023.\n\nThe deep cut is peak Del Rey ballad material, a tender love song imploring her partner to accept happiness. It's another rebuke of the idea that she can't be happy, and it gives insight into some of her earlier writing.\n\nAs a resurfaced older track, \"Say Yes to Heaven\" may not necessarily indicate the direction Lana Del Rey is set to go on her forthcoming album, Lasso (especially considering Del Rey has teased she's \"going country\" for her next release). But it's a beautiful reminder of the affecting narratives and arresting vocals that have made her beloved to so many, no matter the level of fandom.\n\nSongbook: A Guide To Billie Eilish's Musical Ventures & Artistic Ingenuity"
