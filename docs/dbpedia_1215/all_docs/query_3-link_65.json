        "text": "As the legendary DJ Premiere once said, “Hip-hop is about style and finesse and being creative and different. And to do that you have to be ballsy enough to not do what everybody else does.”\n\nRap music has changed a lot since Premier emerged on the scene in the late 1980s. But his mantra still rings true. Hip-hop production of the 21st century has been about creating new styles and having the courage to seek out different paths.\n\nThat’s involved everything from new sounds emerging from different regions, veteran producers switching up styles, newbies on the block upping the ante and everyone taking the art of sampling to the next level.\n\nIn ranking the greatest hip hop beats since the year 2000, we took several factors into account, from creativity and originality to technical savvy and mass appeal. As with any hip hop list, there’s going to be much debate. Just make sure you enjoy the music first.\n\nYear: 2002\n\nProducers: Saint Denson & Swizz Beatz\n\nWith sped-up sampling all the rage in the early 2000s, producer Saint Denson hopped on the trend by taking Freda Payne’s “I Get High (On Your Memory)” for what would turn into Styles P’s 2002 hit “Good Times.” The sample remains true to the original record. But it was Swizz Beatz, Ruff Ryders in-house producer, who gave the record influence its signature gritty sound.\n\nYear: 2003\n\nProducer: Salaam Remi\n\nIron Butterfly’s “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida” features one of the most famous guitar riffs in music history. So, Salaam Remi wasn’t breaking new ground in sampling it. Still, he makes the act of modernizing it and dressing it up with a simple drumbeat seem so easy. Nas loved the fierce beat so much he had Will.i.am flip it again three years later for “Hip Hop Is Dead.”\n\nYear: 2004\n\nProducers: Dr. Dre, Mike Elizondo\n\nNo one makes the art of producing stellar tracks seem easier than Dr. Dre. Believe it or not, “How We Do” is not his simplest construction. But it certainly sounds like it. The four-part melody on The Game and 50 Cent’s hit feels so breezy and elegant. Yet, it was catchy enough to become a certified club anthem.\n\nYear: 2003\n\nProducer: The Heatmakerz\n\nKanye West may have made sped-up, high-pitched soul samples famous. But he wasn’t the only producer doing them. The Heatmakerz handled the bulk of production for The Diplomats at the start of the 21st century. The group’s high-pitched soul sample sound is all over 2003′s “Diplomatic Immunity,” paired with grandiose drums and bass. “I’m Ready” is as boisterous as it gets, taking Barbara Mason’s 1972 song “Yes, I’m Ready” and pushing it to the heavens.\n\nYear: 2000\n\nProducer: DJ Premier\n\nTo know how coveted a DJ Premier beat is, all you have to do is listen to Noreaga at the start of CNN’s “Invincible” as he compares getting a beat from the legendary producer to waiting in a welfare line. The wait was worth it. Premier’s signature drums and scratching make up the core of “Invincible” but it’s the sample of Jimmie and Vella’s “Hey Boy Over There” that serves as the de facto hook. Premier kept it simple, but hot.\n\nYear: 2017\n\nProducer: JoogSZN, Beat Boy, Ron-RonTheProducer\n\n03 Greedo has become a hero of West Coast rap, specifically in L.A.’s Watts neighborhood, thanks to his modernization of the G-funk sound. That, of course, starts with the production, most notably on his signature tune “Rude.” JoogSZN and Beat Boy lace the track with a catchy melody, while Ron-RonTheProducer builds on it with his signature stretched-out synths and bassline that has led the way in transitioning G-funk into the SoundCloud era.\n\nYear: 2003\n\nProducer: Avery Johnson\n\nCrunk music has been around since the early 1990s. But the Atlanta sound reached its peak in the mid-2000s. Atlanta hip-hop artist Bone Crusher arrived on the scene in 2003 with the genre’s hardest-hitting anthem “Never Scared.” Producer Avery Johnson turns crunk’s signature mix of a drumbeat, clapping rhythm, heavy basslines, and shouting vocals up to an 11 for a thunderous anthem that’s still in rotation on locker room playlists.\n\nYear: 2005\n\nProducer: Heavy D\n\nYou probably didn’t expect Heavy D to be on this list. But the producer who became a megastar in his own right in the late 1980s and early 1990s found something in the opening of Raphael Ravenscroft’s 1979 song “Whole Lotta Something Goin’ On,” most notably its moving horn sound and atmospheric backing. Heavy D’s slight reworking of the tune for Beanie Sigel’s “Feel It in the Air” creates a looming sense of paranoia, allowing the rapper to establish his own version of “Mind Playing Tricks on Me.”\n\nYear: 2012\n\nProducer: Scoop DeVille\n\n“The Recipe” has such a decidedly West Coast sound, you might assume it was produced by Dr. Dre. It’s not. Producer Scoop DeVille was listening to an indie rock radio station when he came across Twin Sister’s song “Meet the Frownies” and singer Andrea Estella’s hypnotic vocal: “Smoking weed with you...” It became the backbone of “The Recipe’s” laid-back style layered with drums and evocative keys.\n\nYear: 2004\n\nProducer: Timbaland\n\nThe recording process for “Dirt Off Your Shoulder” is documented in the “Fade to Black” documentary and Jay-Z’s reaction to first hearing the beat says it all. Timbaland had been sitting on the layers upon layers of drums that serve as the backbone of the song for quite some time. But it was when he imported string sounds from Japan that he developed the keyboard sound to bring everything together for “Dirt Off Your Shoulder.” Jay-Z’s ad-libs added the final touch on what has become one of Timbaland’s signature beats of the 21st century.\n\nYear: 2018\n\nProducers: Murda Beatz with Noah “40″ Shebib, Corey Litwin and Blaqnmild\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Murda Beatz popped up on Drake’s radar. Not only had the producer worked with Drake pals Migos and Travis Scott, but he’s also from Drizzy’s native Toronto. There are multiple samples on “Nice for What.” But the one that gets the most attention, and rightfully so, is Lauryn Hill’s emotionally charged “Ex-Factor.” The drumbeat is exceptional. But the way Murdad Beatz chops up Hill’s voice is magical.\n\nYear: 2004\n\nProducer: Jake One\n\nThe beat for “Rock Co.Kane Flow” comes from an ominous, yet fairly precious place in Space’s electronic song “Deliverance.” But that sequence was only the starting point for producer Jake One, who sequenced the sample multiple times and then added drums that explode from your speakers. Undoubtedly, “Rock Co.Kane Flow” is one of the hardest beats De La Soul has ever rhymed over.\n\nYear: 2007\n\nProducers: DJ Paul & Juicy J\n\n“Int’l Players Anthem” was not the first time the production team of DJ Paul & Juicy J (of Three 6 Mafia fame) utilized a sample of Willie Hutch’s 1973 Motown song “I Choose You.” The same beat debuted a half-decade earlier as Project Pat’s “Choose U.” With that song never taking off, Paul and J recycled the beat, this time slow-playing things with the soulful sample before ramping it up with hard hitting drums.\n\nYear: 2010\n\nProducer: J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League\n\nJ.U.S.T.I.C.E. League is under-appreciated for its exceptional beats (See Rick Ross’ “Maybach Music” series). But everyone took note of the production team’s work on “Aston Martin Music.” There’s a rich allure to the song (appropriate for its title) that’s driven by its magnetic collection of synth sounds.\n\nYear: 2012\n\nProducer: DJ Mustard\n\nThe beat to “I’m Different” sounds simple enough. DJ Mustard kicks things off with haunting keys and some serious snare drums. But where the track takes off is when the synths kick in, turning things into an electronic dance party.\n\nYear: 2002\n\nProducer: Kanye West\n\n“Kanye West on the track...” “Guess Who’s Back” is an all-time favorite for West diehards and it’s easy to see why. The drums on it knock, underscored by the sample of The Originals’ beautiful, orchestral song “Sunshine.” What drives it all home is West’s ability to bring those strings back on the hook, making the chorus of Scarface’s tune almost obsolete.\n\nYear: 2014\n\nProducer: El-P\n\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking El-P may have lost his mind in creating the beat for “Oh My Darling Don’t Cry.” The sample is a sputtering composition that feels like it could combust at any point. The samples themselves are quite bonkers. El-P takes the opening chant from Djamel Allam’s “Rani Lah” and the intro of Joe Byrd and the Field Hippies’ “You Can’t Ever Come Down,” which is a trippy mess in and of itself. Somehow, it all works as a forceful and unforgettable hip-hop track (that ending part!) accented by a sample of fellow emcee Killer Mike’s fitting vocal: “Oh my!”\n\nYear: 2000\n\nProducer: J Dilla\n\n“Fall in Love” is the definition of instant vintage. J Dilla’s snappy, crisp drums from Iron Butterfly’s “Soldier in Our Town” come in over a vinyl crackling sound that transports you back to the golden age of soul. The lush sample you hear is Gap Mangione’s “Diana in the Autumn Wind.” But it is the lovely simplicity of the entire thing that stays with you.\n\nYear: 2014\n\nProducer: Madlib\n\n“Thuggin’” sounds like an out-of-body experience. Madlib’s pieced-together, loop of Rubba’s “Way Star” gives off the vibe of someone chugging a cold beverage on a hot day. It serves as a perfect contrast to Freddie Gibbs’ harsh rhymes that heat up as the pace of the beat picks up thrillingly.\n\nYear: 2009\n\nProducer: Swizz Beatz\n\nIf there was any producer that could rein in the monstrous house sounds of French duo Justice, it would be Swizz Beatz. But it took some encouragement. Collaborators urged Swizz to check out Justice’s sound as a potential sample. Eventually, he settled on a live remix recording of Justice’s “D.A.N.C.E.,” flipping it into this manic alt-rap production that even managed to overshadow Jay-Z’s rhymes on “The Blueprint 3.”\n\nYear: 2004\n\nProducer: Just Blaze\n\nThe theme for “Breathe” happened by accident. When Just Blaze handed over the ferocious beat that samples Supertramp’s “Crime of the Century,” Fabolous incorrectly thought the pitched-up vocal said the word “breathe.” It does not. But that didn’t matter. Fab rode it to the heavens over the live-sounding drums and piano melody (from the same Supertramp track), making “Breathe” a beat everyone wanted to rap over.\n\nYear: 2005\n\nProducer: Shawty Redd\n\n“Trap or Die” is the start of trap music’s assault on the mainstream and comes courtesy of Shawty Redd. The Atlanta producer has made harder anthems since “Trap or Die.” But none were more impactful in presenting the thudding sound, combined with haunting keys that would make even the lamest wallflower go crazy in the club.\n\nYear: 2014\n\nProducer: Jahlil Beats\n\nAlmost immediately upon its release, Jahlil Beats’ beat for Bobby Shmurda’s “Hot N***a” became one of the signature sounds of the 2010s. But the beat was anything but new. It first appeared on Lloyd Banks’ 2012 song “Jackpot,” which came and went without much notice. Thus, Shmurda and his viral moves deserve credit for elevating the track. Still, Jahlil Beats’ haunting production remains show-stopper.\n\nYear: 2013\n\nProducer: J. Cole\n\nFor years, some hip-hop fans have been dying for J. Cole to embrace outside production more. But star lyricist has mostly stuck to his guns because he is capable of producing something like “Power Trip.” The track is a masterclass in piling on emotion. It starts by looping a sample of the flutes from Hubert Laws’ “No More” before bringing in the pulsing synths. The rest is mainly sputtering snare and 808s. But Cole gives the strings room to breathe, which keeps “Power Trip” light, yet affecting.\n\nYear: 2015\n\nProducers: Boi-1da, Terrace Martin and KOZ\n\nThe beat for “The Blacker the Berry” began with Boi-1da hearing the soaring guitars that would underscore the song. But it was Boi1da who stripped things down, adding a thunderous breakbeat that would give “The Blacker the Berry” its signature aggression, accenting the power of Kendrick Lamar’s impactful message.\n\nYear: 2003\n\nProducer: Just Blaze\n\nJay-Z’s “The Black Album” was pretty much done when someone played Just Blaze the Little Boy Blues song “Seed of Love” and its stunning opening part that sounded like the greatest song The Doors never made. Just Blaze sampled the song’s lush organ, piano and drums, giving them a monumental hip-hop bounce, in just 10 minutes.\n\nYear: 2001\n\nProducer: The Neptunes\n\n“Southern Hospitality” is an easy beat to dissect, especially for The Neptunes. But its appeal lies in just how hard-hitting every part is, from the synths and flute to the subtle bass and bell sounds. And, of course, there’s that kick drum, the sound of absolute decimation. “Throw them bows” is right.\n\nYear: 2004\n\nProducer: Lil Jon\n\nEven at his most simplistic, Lil Jon could make otherworldly sounds. The beat to “Some Cut” is one of the catchiest of its time. So much so, remains a popular sample choice for hip-hop acts and even K-pop stars thanks to the squeaking sound that suggests someone’s bouncing on a bed.\n\nYear: 2021\n\nProducer: Baby Keem, Cardo, Outtatown, Roselilah, Deats, Jasper Harris, Frankie Bash\n\nAs a song, “Family Ties” tells Baby Keem’s life story with the beat serving as a triumphant backdrop of 808s and blaring horns. It took a large team to produce the diverse beat, which shifts gears for its second, bass-heavy half. It’s easily one of the most memorable musical moments of the past few years.\n\nYear: 2003\n\nProducer: Kanye West\n\nThe song that started it all. Kanye West has gone on to bigger and better things. In fact, “Through the Wire” almost sounds primal compared to what he does now. But the song remains his true breakthrough, laying the blueprint for the Chipmunk Soul sound that would be endlessly copied. West famously spits with his jaw wired shut on “Through the Wire.” But the beat is what truly set him apart. The pitch shifting of Chaka Khan’s “Through the Fire” was mesmerizing right from the song’s opening chords. Producers had been sampling soul records for decades, but nothing sounded as soulful as what West was doing.\n\nYear: 2011\n\nProducer: Mike Will Made-It, Marz\n\n“Tupac Back” sounds like the moment in a horror movie when the villain has finally gotten the drop on his victim. You want to turn away, but you can’t. Not surprisingly, the monumental beat made Mike Will Made-It a star, generating remix upon remix and establishing the producer as someone who could do big production as well as anyone.\n\nYear: 2006\n\nProducer: J Dilla\n\nYou know you’ve got one heck of a beat if it completely overshadows both Common and D’Angelo. J Dilla’s production work that makes “So Far to Go” one of the most heart-warming love songs in recent hip hop history. The track began as “Bye.” from Dilla’s “Donuts” album, but gets sped up a little here, helping the vocal sample of Junie Morrison’s “Tightrope” standout even more alongside The Isley Brothers’ “Don’t Say Goodnight (It’s Time for Love) (Parts 1 & 2)” and Dilla’s amazing drum sound.\n\nYear: 2020\n\nProducers: 30 Roc, Datboisqueeze, Zentachi\n\nThere are many distinctive things about “The Box.” Credit to producer 30 Roc for injecting the mesmerizing synths and some hard-hitting 808 drums. But it was Roddy Ricch who added the signature “eee err” sound, which he’s said was inspired by watching an old video of Michael Jackson beatboxing in the studio.\n\nYear: 2001\n\nProducer: Kanye West\n\nEarly on, Kanye West was known primarily for his samples. Truth be told, taking the vocal breakdown from Bobby “Blue” Bland’s “Ain’t No Love in the Heart of the City” seems like an obvious choice. But Ye showcases serious musicality in his use of it on “Jay-Z’s” “Heart of the City.” The key lies in the loops and transitions, a master class in building suspense while using subtle drums to allow the amazing sample to carry things.\n\nYear: 2006\n\nProducer: The Neptunes\n\n“Hell Hath No Fury” wasn’t just a remarkable moment for Clipse. The album also features some of The Neptunes best production moments, most notably “Keys Open Doors.” The combination of horror movie-style chants, sharp drums and chimes make for one of the most haunting beats by The Neptunes or any producer for that matter. It’s also proof of what talented producers could do with an original concept in an era of over-sampling.\n\nYear: 2011\n\nProducers: Clams Casino\n\nASAP Rocky says it himself on the track: “Influenced by Houston, hear it in my music.” Indeed, “Palace” is trill with chopped and screwed vocal samples and a slow-moving sound that’s hypnotic. But it’s Clams Casino’s sample of “Adiemus” that gives “Palace” the atmospheric feel that makes it sound like it came from the score of a blockbuster movie.\n\nYear: 2013\n\nProducer: The Alchemist\n\nIt’d doubtful most hip-hop fans would be fans of Camel’s slow-moving progressive rock song “A Heart’s Desire.” But The Alchemist found its experimental nature appropriate for Mac Miller’s “Red Dot Music.” The Alchemist takes the vocal sample and warps it into something that sounds like an Alien is reciting it, adding space-age sounds that shoot into the beat.\n\nYear: 2000\n\nProducer: Dan the Automator\n\nThe music from Deltron 3030′s self-titled album is purposefully operatic, as the album strives to create a soundscape for a dystopian society in the year 3030. The standout cut, “3030,” thrives on its opaque atmosphere. There are clear hip-hop elements with a simple drumbeat and DJ scratches. But it’s the barrage of strings, unique samples and space sounds (more warped as the track goes on) that make it feel like something out of a Darren Aronofsky film.\n\nYear: 2009\n\nProducer: Bangladesh\n\nThe keys on the original sample of Flo & Eddie’s “Keep It Warm” are unassuming. It’s astonishing what producer Bangladesh does with them for the core part of Gucci Mane’s “Lemonade.” The ground-shaking bass adds bounce, while Bangladesh smartly uses the melody from “Keep It Warm” as the foundation for children singing on the chorus.\n\nYear: 2004\n\nProducer: Mannie Fresh\n\nThe early days of Cash Money had its signature sound. But Mannie Fresh evolved and set the bar for the label’s new era of production with Lil Wayne’s star-making hit “Go D.J.” in 2004. The track is Mannie’s boom, boom, clap sound on steroids with stunning synths mixed in. Both the drumbeat and chorus would be bitten time and time again in the proceeding years.\n\nYear: 2016\n\nProducer: U-Dub of NY Bangers\n\nSometimes beats are made for a fast-paced, killer display of lyricism. Case in point, Young M.A.’s “Ooouuu.” The NY Bangers created track takes a vocal sample from Melvin Van Peebles’ “The Eight Day Week” and pairs it with the sonic cries of Cano’s 1979 song “Mime Artist.” The drums pounce...when they’re there. When they’re not, they make room for Young M.A.’s thrilling punchlines.\n\nYear: 2002\n\nProducer: Just Blaze\n\nProducers often draw from a variety of song samples to create one hit. But Just Blaze is at his best when he’s dissecting one sample. It takes balls to take apart and rebuild a classic. But that’s exactly what Just Blaze did with Ross Royce’s “I’m Going Down.” As always, his sequencing is perfect, building what is easily one of the most recognized beats in hip hop history.\n\nYear: 2004\n\nProducer: Scott Storch\n\nMany of the songs on this list earn points for their creative use of samples. But Scott Storch built “Lean Back” all on his own, crafting an original drum pattern before lacing it with his trademark keys. Every second of the beat sounds epic, including the amazing drums on the opening. Storch produced the entire thing in under 30 minutes, laying the groundwork for one of the biggest club anthems of the 2000s.\n\nYear: 2000\n\nProducer: Hi-Tek\n\nOn “The Blast,” Hi-Tek shows a level of musicality that instantly placed him among the top producers in hip hop at the start of the 21st century. Rather than take a sample, pitch and chop it up, Hi-Tek stretches it out and then runs it through a wah pedal to give “The Blast” that blissful sonic effect that’s impossible to get away from.\n\nYear: 2013\n\nProducer: Boi-1da and Jordan Evans\n\n“Pound Cake” is one of the more simplistic beats on this list. But space is what makes it so compelling. The sample of “Don’t Say a Word” by Ellie Goulding is phenomenal. So much so, the beat could almost work with just the vocal, snare and kick drum. But the piano melody, which mirrors the vocal, gives the track the allure that made it an instant favorite from Drake’s “Nothing Was the Same” album.\n\nYear: 2006\n\nProducers: Robert “Butta” Crawford and Polow da Don\n\nFor a short while there, Polow da Don was the hottest producer in the game on the strength of “Throw Some D’s,” the Rich Boy classic that samples Switch’s blissful 1979 song “I Call Your Name.” Polow and fellow producer Butta zero in on the best part of the song, creating multiple loops before running them through a filter and mixing them. It’s a masterclass in sequencing that made “Throw Some D’s” one of the most freestyled over and remixed hip hop tracks of the mid-2000s.\n\nYear: 2004\n\nProducer: Madlib\n\nIt is safe to say most hip-hop producers wouldn’t touch an accordion. Then again, Madlib isn’t a run-of-the-mill producer. His landmark album with MF Doom, “Madvillainy,” is full of unique sounds. But “Accordion” has to be the most singular among them. There is just one main sample at use in the beat and it’s out there. Madlib loops the accordion sound from Daedelus’ 2002 track “Experience,” which seems simple enough. But providing that level of authentic musicality was the key to Madvillain’s sound and something no other producer could perfect.\n\nYear: 2005\n\nProducer: Kanye West\n\nIt might take a few listens to “Gone,” but eventually you’re left with not just the most elaborately produced song from Kanye West’s sophomore album “Late Registration,” but one of the most complex beats from the early part of his career. It opens with a bouncy piano melody and vocal sample of Otis Redding’s “It’s Too Late” manipulated to sound more like Ray Charles. The song only builds from there, injecting a wide range of string songs eventually taking it to an amazing orchestral conclusion.\n\nYear: 2001\n\nProducer: Organized Noize\n\nBy the time Outkast’s “Stankonia” rolled around, the group had been moving towards a more advanced sound. But Organized Noize, which produced Outkast’s first three classic albums, was still on board for one of the album’s biggest singles. “So Fresh, So Clean” began with Sleep Brown coming up with the keyboard melody. Rico Wade developed the drums and hook while in the shower one day. The final touches were Outkast’s old-school funk sound. Supposedly, Andre 3000 didn’t like the beat initially. But Big Boi was ready to jump on it.\n\nYear: 2014\n\nProducer: Mike Will Made-It\n\nMike Will Made-It has made hard beats before. But “Move That Dope” was so powerful it even made the fairly straight-edged Pharrell hop on a track about selling drugs. How could anyone ignore that heavy bass, punishing synths and siren sounds that decimate any sound system it plays it in. And, of course, you can’t speak of “Move That Dope” without its homage to Salt-N-Pepa’s classic “Push It.”\n\nYear: 2002\n\nProducer: Salaam Remi\n\nOdds are if you grew up on New York hip hop and became a producer, you at one point or another sampled the Incredible Bongo Band’s version of “Apache.” But perhaps no one hit the sweet spot quite like Salaam Remi on Nas’ “Made You Look.” By slowing the track down enough so he could chop it up perfectly, Remi stumbled upon a quintessential New York anthem -- a shut em down rap epic.\n\nYear: 2000\n\nProducer: J Dilla\n\n“The Light” is J Dilla’s most recognizable beat for obvious reasons. The Bobby Caldwell sample is glorious. But that was only half the work. Balancing out such an iconic vocal part takes true beat-making skill and few have ever been better than J Dilla and programming drums. Dilla found exactly what he was looking for in “You’re Gettin’ a Little Too Smart” by The Detroit Emeralds. The mix of those two samples (with flourishes of Henry Kaiser’s “It’s a Wonderful Life”) is about as flawless as you can get.\n\nYear: 2012\n\nProducer: Harry Fraud\n\nIt’s easy to see why Harry Fraud has developed a cult following. His choice of unique samples is unparalleled. But taking those samples and giving them an atmospheric tone is what makes his beats so appealing. Action Bronson and Riff Raff’s “Bird on a Wire” sounds intoxicating. Fraud’s drums have never been much to write home about. But that’s because they don’t need to be. Fraud’s sample of Dexter Wansel’s “Rings of Saturn” will leave you in a trance.\n\nYear: 2000\n\nProducer: DJ Premier\n\nOn “Boom,” the legendary DJ Premier found most of what he needed in a sample of Marc Hannibal’s 1969 song “Forever Is a Long, Long, Time,” while modernizing the string sound. But that wasn’t enough. Premier jacked the ticking clock sound from The Kay-Gees “Anthology” to give “Boom” a sense of urgency that makes it one of the ultimate beats to freestyle over.\n\nYear: 2001\n\nProducer: El-P\n\nYou’ve probably heard this before: The opening track on Cannibal Ox’s masterpiece “Cold Vein” album sounds like the start of a movie. The drama created by producer El-P is through the roof, kicking off with a beeping noise that feels like a countdown to Armageddon. The horns build the suspense before the darkness sets in. What further makes El-P’s work classic is how the beat switches up to its distorted rock sound at various parts. It’s the definition of cinematic musical production.\n\nYear: 2010\n\nProducer: Stargate\n\n“Black & Yellow” doesn’t sound like any other mainstream hip-hop song because it was done by pop producers. The team of Stargate was better known for its work with the likes of Ne-Yo, Rihanna and Beyonce. But Wiz Khalifa was on a mission for a radio hit and his sense of melody melded perfectly with Stargate’s coasting, orchestral synth sounds. “Black & Yellow” may have become a Pittsburgh anthem, but the beat sounds like a beautiful trip to outer space.\n\nYear: 2009\n\nProducer: No I.D.\n\nWhen you’re talking about killing off a trendy recording technique (which is still around by the way), you better bring it. “Death of Auto-Tune” is Jay-Z’s get off my lawn moment. But it’s also a showcase for producer No I.D. to establish his signature sound for a new era. The instrumentation is about as live as you can get without bringing in a full band. The wonky guitar solo is hypnotic, backed by crashing drums. Auto-Tune didn’t die, but No I.D. set a new standard for his production sound.\n\nYear: 2019\n\nProducer: Wheezy\n\nProducer Wheezy’s Atlanta influence shows on Young Thug’s appropriately “Hot.” The horn-heavy song has marching band written all over it. But Wheezy doesn’t leave it there, incorporating the “Hot” chant throughout while adding in some simple woodwind instruments. Yet, it’s the song’s looping bass is what blows you away. It’s like hearing a DJ do a drop at a stadium over and over again. You simply can’t get enough of it.\n\nYear: 2000\n\nProducer: The Alchemist\n\nThe Alchemist’s production has always been an exercise in walking the line between light and dark. Prodigy’s “Keep It Thoro” is one of the most threatening beats you will ever come across. Yet the sample comes from composer Jack Mayborn’s uplifting “Disco People,” which is his take on the theme to “Rocky.” The Alchemist centers the groove on the song’s opening chords and adds bass stabs along with subtle touches (including a moan and menacing horns) to build the darkness. It’s truly terrifying.\n\nYear: 2011\n\nProducer: Mustard, Mike Free\n\n“Mustard on the beat, ho!” And a star producer was born. Mustard’s beat to Tyga’s “Rack City” is a classic case of less is more. There are just three notes of bass that repeat over and over. But that snap sound and the shouts that turn it into a club anthem are infectious. It wasn’t long after “Rack City” became a hit that every hip-hop song was sounding like Mustard produced it. But there can only be one.\n\nYear: 2007\n\nProducer: Metro Boomin’\n\nMainstream music fans probably aren’t too familiar with the 1978 musical “Selma,” a tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.. But the soundtrack and specifically the tune “Prison Song” has been a popular choice among crate diggers for some time. So, producer Metro Boomin’ wasn’t breaking ground when it came to Future’s hit “Mask Off.” But the way Metro uses the beat is different. The song’s gritty undertones are apparent. But the emphasis on the flute is exceptional, given its simplicity and blissful jazz feeling.\n\nYear: 2013\n\nProducers: Kanye West, Hudson Mohawke, Lunice, Carlos Broady, 88-Keys, Mike Dean, Arca\n\nVirtually every track on Kanye West’s “Yeezus” is polarizing. But “Blood on the Leaves” is especially so. West samples Nina Simone’s sacred cover of Billie Holiday’s “Strange Fruit,” a song about lynching, to score his song about fame and a drug-fueled romance. The production work is nothing short of astonishing, with the Simone sample coming in over a rolling melody. The song builds to an epic industrial anthem with horns sampled from TNGHT’s “R U Ready.”\n\nYear: 2003\n\nProducer: Just Blaze\n\nJust Blaze could have used the studio recording of Major Harris’ “I Got Over Love” as the basis for The Diplomats’ quintessential New York song “I Really Mean It.” Instead, he opts for the live version of Harris’ song, which gives “I Really Mean It” a more vibrant feel to match Just’s signature live-sounding drums and sub-bass.\n\nYear: 2013\n\nProducer: Mike Zombie, Noah “40″ Shebib\n\n“Started from the Bottom” began with Drake wanting something as unhinged and intense as “N****s in Paris.” To say he came close is quite the compliment. The song is centered on a sample of Bruno Sanfilippo’s ambient composition “Ambessence Piano & Drones 1,” an odd yet brilliant choice. From there, Mike Zombie laces the song with a barrage of drums that develop more layers as the song goes on, toeing the line between a haunting soundtrack piece and a bombastic anthem.\n\nYear: 2005\n\nProducers: Cool & Dre, Dr. Dre\n\nThe Game’s debut album “The Documentary” is one of the best-produced hip hop albums of all time with production from Dr. Dre, Kanye West, Just Blaze, Havoc, Timbaland and Buckwild, among others. But it’s Cool & Dre who steal the show with “Hate or Love It,” a brilliant soul-sample of The Trammps’ 1972 song “Rubber Band.” The sample and its chop are straightforward. But Cool & Dre elevate the track by being picky with when they bring drums in and when they remove them. The final touch is Dr. Dre’s vibrant mix.\n\nYear: 2011\n\nProducers: T-Minus, Kromatik and Noah “40″ Shebib\n\nHad T-Minus’ original version of “I’m on One” stayed as is with its wobbly synths and basic drums, it probably still would have been a hit. But Noah “40″ Shebib’s contribution can’t be overlooked. His work with Drake is all about melody and creating the atmospheric undertones that give a song like “I’m on One” its alluring feel makes it one of the most intoxicating productions of the 2010s.\n\nYear: 2005\n\nProducer: DJ Toomp, Wonder Arillo\n\nT.I.’s 2006 album “King” was his victory lap as the King of the South. So, appropriately, he needed a signature anthem to lead the way. DJ Toomp built the beat for “What You Know” around a sample of the closing part to Roberta Flack’s “Gone Away.” But the complex piece of music required reorganizing and orchestrating from collaborator Wonder Arillo. Once the eclectic sample was in place, Toomp refined the song’s sound with an amazing percussion sound. It all makes for, arguably, the most triumphant track on this list.\n\nYear: 2012\n\nProducer: Hit-Boy\n\nSometimes, all it takes is one sound to hook you. Hit-Boy found that in a bit part from The Chakachas’ “Yo Soy Cubano.” The sample comes in at the start of Kendrick Lamar’s “Backseat Freestyle” in thrilling fashion. Then the kick, snare drums and Eighties hip-hop guitar sound come in. Hit-Boy builds from there, cherry-picking his favorite sounds and inserting them throughout to create an energy few records can match.\n\nYear: 2004\n\nProducer: The Neptunes\n\nPharrell of The Neptunes couldn’t have found better inspiration in crafting a modern gangsta rap anthem for Snoop Dogg. As the story goes, there were dozens of Crips gang members in the studio pressuring The Neptunes to deliver the goods. Pharrell came up with the bass backbone for “Drop It Like It’s Hot” before getting crazy and adding in the signature mouth clicks and the sound of spray paint cans. But it was The Neptunes’ Chad Hugo who added the signature synths on the hook that put the icing on the cake.\n\nYear: 2012\n\nProducer: Young Chop\n\nYoung Chop didn’t think much of the beat for “I Don’t Like,” seeing it as something basic. Yet, with its opening, nursery rhyme-esque keys and driving percussion, “I Don’t Like” became the signature song for Chicago’s drill music. The genre is mainly characterized by its aggressive lyrics. But on “Don’t Like,” Young Chop shows how to create the proper backdrop and marching pattern that signifies doom and gloom.\n\nYear: 2003\n\nProducer: Kanye West\n\n“Lucifer” is one of those songs where you remember where you were when you first heard the beat kick in. For the track, Kanye West dug into the reggae genre, ripping a vocal sample from Max Romeo’s “Chase the Devil.” The rest is an opening piano melody, plucked strings and an amazing drum track. As Jay-Z says at the song’s onset, “Kanyeezy you did it again. You a genius...”\n\nYear: 2010\n\nProducer: Lex Luger\n\nThere’s trap music and then there’s “Hard in da Paint,” a relentless juggernaut of an anthem that still sounds earth-shattering more than a decade later. Lex Luger deserves credit for defying convention with a beat that, clearly influenced by crunk, is overly simplistic but forceful. Hard in da Paint” takes components of classics like “Never Scared,” “What You Know” and “Get Crunk” and turns them up to a level that challenges your tolerance for overpowering things.\n\nYear: 2000\n\nProducer: DJ Paul, Juicy J\n\nThe beat from “Sippin’ on Some Syrup” comes from a dark place. The track samples “Is That Enough,” one of the best songs from Marvin Gaye’s gut-wrenching breakup album “Here, My Dear.” The instrumentation is euphoric on the original, which made it the perfect starting point for Three 6 Mafia, UGK and Project Pat’s song about drinking purple drank. Add in rattling bass and stuttering drums, and you have a signature piece of Midwest hip hop culture.\n\nYear: 2009\n\nProducer: Just Blaze\n\nThe beat for Jay Electronica’s “Exhibit C” starts with Chicago soul singer Billy Stewart’s fantastic ballad “Cross My Heart.” Just Blaze combed the track for his favorite parts, which appear at various parts of the song. From there, he chops the track up, weaving together the parts seamlessly over his trademark bombastic production. “Exhibit C” would wind up being a pivotal moment for rap in the 21st century, but anyone who listened to the overwhelming production when it came out knew that was inevitable right from the jump.\n\nYear: 2006\n\nProducer: Lil Jon\n\nMac Dre introduced the Bay area sensation known as hyphy to the mainstream. But it made sense for Lil Jon to take it to the next level. Sure, he was from Atlanta. But crunk was similar in its pounding rhythms. Hyphy is slang for “hyperactive.” And yet, “Tell Me When to Go” is easily one of Jon’s most minimalistic productions, heavy on its thunderous rhythm that shakes any platform you’re listening to it on.\n\nYear: 2010\n\nProducers: S1, Kanye West, Jeff Bhasker and Mike Dean\n\nJust a few albums into his career and Kanye West was experimenting with sounds outside of hip hop. But “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” took that to the next level. “Power” is overwhelming in every facet. And that begins with the main sample of Afromerica’s “Continent Number 6″ that’s redone in the studio, giving Ye his Michael Jackson “Wanna Be Startin’ Something” chant moment. The vocals are backed by chopped-up drums from Cold Grits’ 1969 song “It’s Your Thing.” S1 and West pile on numerous synths and strings with Mike Dean adding live guitar and bass parts. To top things off, West plugs in a sample of King Crimson’s prog-rock classic “21st Century Schizoid Man.” The entire mix gives “Power” a schizophrenic feel that often feels on the verge of exploding.\n\nYear: 2004\n\nProducer: Salih Williams\n\nLadies and gentlemen welcome to Swishahouse, the epic center of Houston’s independent hip hop scene, known for its signature chopped and screwed sound. The style was known and respected in hip-hop head circles. But no one had produced anything as syrupy sweet and mainstream like the beat for “Still Tippin.’” The acapella for the track had existed for a while. But Salih Williams was asked to remix it, taking the strings from a version of Gioachino Rossini’s “William Tell Overture” and stretching them out to create something hypnotizing.\n\nYear: 2009\n\nProducer: Clams Casino\n\nClams Casino has been in love with Imogen Heap’s “Just for Now” as a sample for quite some time. He’s used it in various ways through the years, most notably on Lil B’s “I’m God.” The song is the best representation of Casino’s sound, which mixes lo-fi and atmospheric effects for an enchanting sound that’s helped define alternative hip hop in the 21st century. Casino’s work is very complex, involving manipulating and reversing various parts of the song. The sequencing is key, laid over solid drums. The overall effect is one of a mystifying tone and ambiance.\n\nYear: 2011\n\nProducer: Tyler, the Creator\n\nIn typical Tyler, the Creator fashion, the beat for “Yonkers” began as a joke. Tyler was clowning around trying to make what he felt was a stereotypical New York beat. There must be a bit of modesty to that. “Yonkers” does have a New York sound. But you would not imagine Mobb Deep or Wu-Tang rapping to it. There is a distinct alt-rap vibe only Tyler can master, with horrorcore synths at the center. “Yonkers” is dark, but equally psychotic. The work of a crazy genius.\n\nYear: 2013\n\nProducer: Don Cannon, Kanye West, 88 Keys\n\nFunny how something so minimalistic can blow your mind. “Numbers on the Board” rides on its wobbling bass with an abundance of drums and a distortion sound you can’t get out of your head. Don Cannon sent the beat to Kanye West and it went nearly untouched, which is unheard of for West. But there wasn’t much to improve on other than adding the vocal scream sample (developed by 88 Keys) and mixing in an iconic Jay-Z sample.\n\nYear: 2000\n\nProducer: DR Period\n\nProducer DR Period produced M.O.P.’s debut album “To the Death” back in 1994. So, not only did he know the group’s high energy sound. He also helped create it. So it’s no surprise that he eventually produced M.O.P.’s signature sound. You can feel the simple, yet driving drum pattern on “Ante Up.” But it’s the horns that evoke craziness, reminiscent of a Southern marching band’s rallying cries. The song’s bounce has been known to make people go crazy to this day igniting aggressive moments at a club near you.\n\nYear: 2006\n\nProducer: J Dilla\n\n“Time: The Donut of the Heart” is one of the tracks from J Dilla’s masterful “Donuts” album with the least number of samples. That’s because Dilla captured something special in his manipulation of The Jackson 5′s “All I Do Is Think of You,” speeding it up so fast that you can almost hear the vocals in the song pouring out of the instrumental. Other vocal components are added in. But nothing can take away from that core sample use, which is astonishing.\n\nYear: 2000\n\nProducer: Buckwild\n\nFrançois Valéry’s electronic-driven slow-burner “Joy,” which was born in the disco era,” doesn’t immediately scream hip hop sample. But there’s something dark and dramatic about the song’s conclusion. And the way Buckwild flips it is downright sinister. “Whoa!” sounds like comes from a different era, not just because it’s from Bad Boy Records’ epic run, but because producers are rarely capable of making something this haunting anymore.\n\nYear: 2012\n\nProducers: Lifted, Mike Dean, Mike Will Made-It, Kanye West, Hudson Mohawke\n\n“Mercy” began simple enough. Producer Lifted provided the bass-heavy core with a screwed and chopped-up vocal. But it’s the extras piled on that made it so unique. Two dancehall samples elevate the hook of the song before the Scarface film’s “Tony’s Theme” comes in. The song perfectly captured Kanye West’s obsession with the trap sound of the moment, while also offering up something unique and extravagant.\n\nYear: 2000\n\nProducer: Timbaland\n\nListening to “Big Pimpin’” as a song, the beat, while exceptional, doesn’t feel like a lot went into it. In truth, Timbaland accomplishes what should take an army of producers to do. His obsession with Middle Eastern music gets heavy hear. “Big Pimpin’” is built around a sample of Hossam Ramzy’s “Khusara Khusara.” But Timbaland puts layer upon layer on top of it with various drum sounds, bells, flutes and even a scream sample. All that magic delivered the first great production cut of the 21st century.\n\nYear: 2005\n\nProducer: 9th Wonder\n\n9th Wonder’s drumkit is one of the simplest among elite producers, which is the point. His songs are all about their vibe built around some of the best samples you’ll ever hear. The peak of 9th Wonder’s sound comes with Little Brother and a masterful sample of The Stylistics’ “One Night Affair.” 9th chops up different pieces of the soul group’s song, piecing it together over drumbeats to make it all sound seamless and euphoric.\n\nYear: 2000\n\nProducer: Earthtone III\n\nNo rapper alive should be able to properly rap over the beat to Outkast’s “B.O.B.” It clocks in at 135 beats per minute with a barrage of sounds each more forceful than the next. “B.O.B.” produced by Earthtone III, the production company made up of Big Boi, Andre 3000 and Atlanta producer Mr. DJ, is more drum and bass than rap. But it also infuses elements of funk, rock and electronic music. It’s meant to be overwhelming, only working as a brilliant record because it has two expert emcees that can ride the beat.\n\nYear: 2001\n\nProducer: The Alchemist\n\nBreaking down The Alchemist manipulation of the sample for “We Gonna Make It” is something to marvel at. The blueprint for everything is there in the bridge Samuel Jonathan Johnson’s 1978 track “My Music.” The Alchemist makes subtle but noteworthy changes, speeding the track up to nearly 20 times its original pace, shifting the tone and giving it a brighter feel before adding drums. He takes it from a mellow soul song to something triumphant.\n\nYear: 2011\n\nProducer: Hit-Boy, Kanye West, Mike Dean and Anthony Kilhoffer\n\n“Ni**as in Paris” might be the strangest song on this list. It features dialogue from the 2007 Will Ferrell movie “Blades of Glory” and is sonically built around a vocal sample from a 1950s baptism. At the helm is Hit-Boy. His signature, stunning synths eventually come in during the song’s final third. But before that, it’s the use of snares and hi-hats that never conform to what one might expect. The result is a unique banger that can be played repeatedly without missing a beat.\n\nYear: 2013\n\nProducers: Noah “40″ Shebib, Nathan Sessoms\n\nWhen word began to spread that Drake’s new album “Nothing Was the Same” would contain a Whitney Houston sample, things could have gone several ways. It wasn’t out of the realm of possibility for Drake to rap over “I Will Always Love You” or recreate “I Wanna Dance with Somebody.” But no one expected what producers Noah “40″ Shebib and Nathan Sessoms did on the album’s opening cut. It’s not just that they sample Houston’s “The Bodyguard” showstopper “I Have Nothing.” It’s that they chopped, sped up and reversed it three unique ways for three different verses with pulsating drums and no chorus in between. The results are astonishing.\n\nYear: 2015\n\nProducer: Tarentino\n\nIt’s fair to say Future’s trap style had grown a little tired by 2015. To freshen things out, he reached out to Tarentino of 808 Mafia for something different. Tarentino has said he created the beat for “March Madness” to sound like a supernatural event. Mission accomplished. His combination of ambient sounds, bells, 808s and hi-hats is disorienting. It takes you to another world like no other beat of the 21st century. More importantly, it set the stage for Future to reassert himself at the forefront of hip hop music moving forward.\n\nYear: 2001\n\nProducer: Just Blaze\n\nMuch attention is played to the high-pitched vocal sample of Bobby Byrd’s “I’m Not to Blame” on “U Don’t Know.” But where Just Blaze thrives on the head-nodder that is “U Don’t Know,” is in the sequencing. Not only does he sample the vibrant orchestration from Byrd’s song, but he sets it up like the expert drum programmer he is. It’s the driving organ sound backed by drums that give “U Don’t Know” its all-consuming feel.\n\nYear: 2010\n\nProducer: Lex Luger\n\n“Hard in da Paint” opened doors for Lex Luger. When Rick Ross came calling for something similar, Luger sent him “B.M.F.” which is “Hard in da Paint” on steroids. “B.M.F.” is a slow-moving monster that’s coming to rip your throat out with its driving drums accented by a barrage of keys and synths that never let up. If “Hard in da Paint” didn’t already have the rap industry clamoring for hardcore trap rap, “B.M.F.” took care of that.\n\nYear: 2017\n\nProducer: Pi’erre Bourne\n\n“Magnolia” isn’t just Pi’erre Bourne’s definitive beat and Playboi Carti’s definitive song. It is one of the ultimate trap rap anthems of the SoundCloud era. The track sounds like something ripped out of a video game and rides a beat that you can’t pin down to a particular region. Its synth organs, flutes and melody are too busy consuming you. Bourne was smart enough to slap his tag on it: “Yo Pi’erre, you wanna come out here?” on it and the rest is history.\n\nYear: 2008\n\nProducer: Bangladesh\n\nWhen Bangladesh and Lil Wayne unleashed “A Milli” to the world, it changed the course of hip hop. You couldn’t go anywhere without hearing the trunk-rattling combination of sharp drums and thunderous bass on the radio or blaring from car speakers. Wayne and Bangladesh even went for it again two years later with “6 Foot 7 Foot.” But, while the magic to “A Milli” is its ability to decimate headphones, it’s also the unforgettable sample – just a small snippet from the “Vampire Mix” of A Tribe Called Quest’s “I Left My Wallet In El Segundo” -- you can’t possibly get out of your head.\n\nYear: 2001\n\nProducer: Timbaland\n\nYou hear it often (even in this article). But Missy Elliott and Timbaland’s “Get Ur Freak On” was truly unlike anything the hip hop universe had ever heard – a song with worldly vibes and endless mainstream appeal. As always, Timbaland brings his Indian-influenced hand drum sound (something that would prove a hallmark of his 21st century sound). But it’s the six-note melody played on a Punjabi tumbi that blows you away. It was the result of Timbaland and Missy constantly trying new things. In this case, they changed the game for pop music in ways the biggest artist in the world, from Rihanna and Beyonce to Kanye West and Jay-Z, sought to copy.\n\nYear: 2018\n\nProducers: Roget Chahayed, Hit-Boy, OZ, Cubeatz, Tay Keith, Mike Dean\n\nIt probably doesn’t surprise anyone that “Sicko Mode” has a half-dozen producers. The song is, for lack of a better word, insane. It’s divided up into three parts, each of which could be a massive banger. There are also random short samples of The Notorious B.I.G. and Uncle Luke. This should have been a mess. Instead, it’s one of the best production showcases of the last decade, with guest Drake sounding as stellar as he ever has while riding two sections of the beat.\n\nYear: 2003\n\nProducers: Dr. Dre, Mike Elizondo\n\nThe beats of today come with all the bells and whistles. But very few of them, if any, will have the staying power of 50 Cent’s “In Da Club.” Yet another one of Dr. Dre’s masterpieces (with an assist from Mike Elizondo), “In Da Club” functions on what is almost a single loop from start to finish. Yet, it sounds like a hip hop symphony. The backbone is dramatic and dark, with every sound pumped in matching that feel. There are layers to the beat that are hard to recognize (mainly, synths and strings) because they mesh so perfectly. Not only is “In Da Club” the ultimate showcase in crafting the catchiest of beats, but how to mix it perfectly. This one will be around forever.\n\nYear: 2002\n\nProducer: The Neptunes\n\nWith “Grindin,’” the Neptunes wanted to bring hip hop back to its glory days of the breakbeat and emcee. The beat sounds like it could be made with a lunch table and a row of slamming lockers. Clipse’s Pusha T and Malice were baffled upon first hearing it and who could blame them? The rap duo didn’t know what to make of the stripped-down beat with its massive drums and shuffling sound. I suppose we were all expecting the Neptunes to come armed with their usual bling sound. Instead, we got something far more timeless and impactful.\n\nYear: 2010\n\nProducers: Bink!, Mike Dean\n\nWhen “Devil in a New Dress” leaked before the proper release of “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” in 2010 people nearly lost their minds over the sound. And that was before hearing the final version with Kanye West’s extra verse and the guest appearance by Rick Ross. A lot is going on. Producer Bink! pieces together various vocal parts from Smokey Robinson’s cover of “Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,” removing the entire low end before merging it with a live drum sound and compelling synth strings. Mike Dean plays the extra instrumental parts live in the studio with everything climaxing during an epic piano and guitar breakdown. The most astonishing thing is how the song starts so epic and somehow manages to build even higher throughout. It’s the most earth-shattering thing on the best album of the 21st century. There are exceptional beats on this list. But “Devil in a New Dress” is a sonic tour de force."
