        "text": "Jude Shiels One More Last Time Self-Release\n\nThe single Peaceful Dreams / A Friend Like You, released in 2017, pointed towards a change in Jude Shiels' musical direction. More known for following in his legendary father, Brush Shiels' footsteps as a rocking and stomping blues man, after two albums in that genre with his band The So-Called, he has revisited his love of roots and traditional country music with this ten-track record.\n\nHeavily influenced by the late Jerry Jeff Walker's self-titled album from 1972, Shiels recruited two of the players that contributed to that album, pedal steel supremo Patterson Barrett (Buddy and Julie Miller, Hal Ketchum, Nanci Griffith) and renowned harmonica player Doc Simons. Both players are in vintage form, supporting Shiels' matter-of-fact lyrics.\n\nAcross the ten self-written songs, Shiels delicately handles the standard country themes. Love lost and matters of the heart (Will I Ever Know, Not My Hard Luck Story), tears in your beer (Drinking & Thinking About Having One More), religious intensity (False Idol), and, of course, trains (One Way Ticket) are all addressed.\n\nWe at Lonesome Highway have been bewildered that so few Irish artists and bands have joined the growing revival of 'real' country music in recent years. Take a bow, Jude Shiels. Hopefully, you've kicked started a trend, and others will follow.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nRainy Eyes Lonesome Highway Royal Potato Family\n\nAt Lonesome Highway, we have been drawn to the quality of music being recorded by Scandinavian artists in recent years. Irena Eide (aka Rainy Eyes) is the latest name to add to the growing list of singer-songwriters from that location creating interesting and provocative music, in her case drawn from nomadic and often troubled experiences from childhood. A single mother raised Norwegian-born Eide; her father was a Serbian musician who struggled with addiction and was only a fleeting presence in her childhood. Her childhood love of music, influenced by her uncle, drew her to the music of The Beatles, Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones and Creedence Clearwater Revival.\n\nGiven her unstable childhood, it’s little surprise that Eide sought independence at a young age, leaving Norway in her late teens and moving to Denmark and one year later decamping to San Francisco with a jazz saxophone player whom she fell for. Her time in the Bay Area introduced her to several renowned musicians such as Peter Rowan, Pete Seeger and Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, drawing her into old-time folk music. Honing her skills in both folk and bluegrass music, she hosted classes and music camps for young children and recorded her debut folk album, MOON IN THE MIRROR, in 2019.\n\nLONESOME HIGHWAY finds Eide on a more experimental path than on her debut record. The eleven tracks not only embrace her folk leanings but also inject roots, country, and traditional aspects into her music. This diverse musical palette, coupled with the whirlwind and traumatic circumstances that brought the project into being creates an album that is both intriguing and exciting. Eide’s joy of motherhood was contrasted by the breakdown of a marriage that had turned sour, which lead to her fleeing California and relocating in South Louisiana.\n\nProducer and hailed multi-instrumentalist Dirk Powell invited Eide into his studio for the recordings, and the album is an honest and unrestrained collection of songs that confront painful experiences, acceptance and rebirth. Powell’s daughters Amelia and Sophie added backing vocals, Chris Stafford played pedal steel, and Eric Adcock was on organ.\n\nThe autobiographical Misty Eyes, which opens the album, sets the scene of desolation and isolation (‘Misty mama on the run, breaking out towards that rising sun. Spend the night on a stranger’s floor, dreaming of an open door’). As with many of the tracks where the theme is downbeat, the deliveries are sparkling, drawing the listener into the tales within the songs. The title track is a two-stepping country delight equalled by the ‘tears in your beer’ A Little Dream. Set Me Free is a jaunty blues affair, possibly recalling the writer’s introduction to early Rolling Stones music in her early years. The strikingly evocative I Thought About You is a stripped-back song with only vocals and strummed acoustic guitar.\n\nThe album is bookended by Monday’s Gonna Come Around, which plays out like its author looking in a mirror and addressing herself, dusting herself down, and preparing to forge ahead and put the past behind her.\n\nIt takes a lot of pluckiness for an artist to open their heart and lay bare their vulnerabilities. In doing so with LONESOME HIGHWAY, Eide has addressed her personal journey and fashioned a lyrically poetic and hugely satisfying album.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nMaya de Vitry The Only Moment Self-Release\n\nMaya de Vitry, a founding member of the now-defunct The Stray Birds, has evolved significantly as a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. Her latest album, THE ONLY MOMENT, marks her fourth solo release. After co-producing her last record, VIOLET LIGHT, with Ethan Jodziewicz, she took complete control of the production duties on this ten-track record, showcasing her growth and artistic maturity.\n\nFor the past decade, Maya de Vitry has called Nashville home, and it's here that she recorded her latest album at Phantom Studios in Gallatin, Tennessee. She was joined by her studio band, Anthony da Costa (guitar), Ethan Jodziewicz (bass), Alex Wilder (organ), Dominic Billet (drums), and Phoebe Hunt (harmonies). Her music, a blend of alt-country and indie folk, is a unique sound that is showcased in this latest release, featuring some of her most robust material to date.\n\nSome Rent and Burning Building particularly impress. Slightly more left of centre with De Vitry abandoning her comfort zone, the former’s driving rhythm and woozy guitar captivate. With an unrushed vocal delivery and stirring backing vocals, the latter is also raised to another level by fine electric guitar work. Compass enters quintessential Richard Thompson territory, and opener Nothing Else Matters, co-written with Phoebe Hunt, is a lyrically poetic and classic textbook folk ballad. Minimalist tracks I’m Not Going Anywhere and Watching The Whole Sky Change are typical de Vitry evocative compositions.\n\nMaya de Vitry's musical journey began in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, where she was born into a musical family. Her path has taken her from playing on street corners to bars, then festivals with The Stray Birds, to her current station as an accomplished singer-songwriter. It's a testament to her skill in creating intimate songs that are fuelled by self-examination and astute questioning. With this album, de Vitry solidifies her status as an artist with endless potential and whose rising star is well deserved.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nMichael Waugh Beauty and Truth Compass Bros\n\nWith four prior albums to his name this Australian singer songwriter has been developing a career that started with a debut release in 2016. He grew up in the beautiful countryside of Gippsland, Victoria and his formative years were something of a challenging time. Having won the Golden Guitar award presented by the Country Music Association of Australia in 2022, Waugh came out as being a gay man and spoke openly about the homophobia he had suffered as a young person. It shaped his growth into adulthood and also played a role in the fact that Waugh decided to follow expected norms and he married into a conventional relationship with a woman and they had a son together.\n\nWaugh works as an English and drama teacher and having reached a decision that he couldn’t hide his true nature any longer, he declared his true sexual leanings in order to eventually face the ghosts of his youth that had led to shame and self-hatred at various intervals. Waugh lost both his parents in 2020 and his brother a year later, prompting him to now live very much in the moment and to embrace the days that we are given. Music is all about making connection and across the eleven songs included on this new album Michael Waugh certainly succeeds in bringing the listener on a journey that unveils lots to enjoy.\n\nFellow musician Shane Nicholson produced the album and he has worked with Michael Waugh on all his albums to date. Other players on the album in addition to both Waugh and Shane Nicholson (bass, piano, organ, Wurlitzer, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, baritone guitar, lap steel guitar, banjo, mandolin, bouzouki, percussion, backing vocals), include Ollie Thorpe (guitars, pedal steel and backing vocals) and James Gizzard (bass), along with Ali Foster (drums, percussion, backing vocals) with Jen Mize and the Rosylns (backing vocals).\n\nThe album opens with a strong statement on behalf of the gay community and We Are Here namechecks a number of iconic gay men who have established celebrity in particular fields over the centuries, from James Baldwin and Oscar Wilde, to Alan Turing, Harvey Milk and Allen Ginsberg. Fix Me is a song that references the experiences of gay men in dealing with confused signals surrounding sexuality and the lyrics reflect this ‘But you can’t fix me, I’m not broken, I’m the way I’m meant to be.’ It is a defining moment for Waugh in his brave decision to come out and suffer the slings and arrows of public reaction.\n\nThe title song Beauty and Truth is very much in confessional mode and sent out to his wife in trying to address the hurt caused ‘ Too young to be a father, Unfit to be a husband, Too stunted by the world to be full grown, And in my stupid youthfulness, I tried my very best to fill those roles.’ By way of apology he asks that ‘I hope that you find the love that I could not give to you, I hope you find beauty and truth.’\n\nAnother deeply personal song is Father’s Day and it tracks the emotions of an estranged parent who has limited access to a child he loves ‘What I wouldn’t give to hear your voice again, Even in another screaming fight, Silence reminds me of things I regret, And words said in anger and spite.’ The trio of songs Out, Playlist and Moved are in celebration of the new love that Waugh has found and his desire to shout out his happiness for all to hear. Wanting to let go of past hurts and also sharing favourite songs on a playlist that keep a closeness with someone when they are not with you, ‘When my mind was fixed, When my life was stuck, Look at how you moved me.’\n\nThe track that highlights the empathy in Michael Waugh is Songs About Women where he gives vent to the way in which women are put down by ignorance and misogyny in society ‘Don’t give some bastard an anthem and let him think we understand, I don’t want another song about another woman hurt by a man.’ On Patsy Cline we have a tribute to the country legend in addition to mention of Tammy Wynette, both of whom have made an impression on the singer. He wrestles within a relationship where the differences can best be highlighted by the lyrics ‘And it’s fatally flawed ‘cause you don’t even know who Patsy Cline is, But is it that you like to dance and I like my heart broken?’\n\nThe final song is To Be Alive and is a celebration of being able to celebrate the moment, having fun and striking out for the golden fleece. Michael Waugh has a very warm vocal tone and these songs certainly resonate. An album that bring plenty of pleasure in the great production, even if there is quite a lot of pain threaded through these interesting songs.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nThe Gringo Pistoleros The Rise and…subsequent Fall of the Texas Alien Self Release\n\nIf Texas swing and a traditional honky tonk sound are your preferences then this album is tailor-made for you. With tracks like One Step Further and I’ll Walk the Line (for your Hoochie Coo) jumping out of the speakers, it’s not hard to love what going on among this band of troubadours.\n\nAs a once-off project the combined talents of Lazarus Nichols and Cory Grinder came together with fellow musicians to record at Signal Hill Studios in Austin. Over a period of just one week they laid down these ten songs and the entire process was overseen by co-producers Patrick Herzfeld and Larry Wilson. Three of the songs are cover versions, with the classic That’s How I Got To Memphis (Tom T Hall) making an appearance, alongside Dire Wolf (Garcia/Hunter) and the traditional classic Crawdad Song. There is a more measured pace to country songs like I Can Still Remember When and Time Bomb with the assembled musicians clearly enjoying the spirit of the occasion and laying down this spontaneous music.\n\nLazarus Nichols wrote the seven songs that sit alongside the cover versions and Cory Grinder (guitar, piano, fiddle, vocals) brought his Playboy Scout swing band members Bee Roberts (drums), Stephen “Tebbs” Karney (pedal steel, vocals), Alexander Buchanon (bass). They are joined by Michael O’Connor, Oliver Steck, Joe Faulhaber, Larry Wilson and Austin Stambaugh on various instruments. Vocal duties are shared across the songs and highlights include a down and dirty blues sound on The Cat Came Back and the classic country sound of High Mileage Heart with a shifting tempo and the pedal steel and piano floating around the melody – I can almost hear the spirit of Willie in the backing vocals.\n\nWill the Gringo Pistoleros consider another rendezvous and declare a statement of intent to carry on? This is anybody’s guess but there is so much to enjoy here, created over such a short time-frame, that the answer should be a resounding YES!\n\nPaul McGee\n\nMark Brown Happy Hour Self Release\n\nUlster County, New York is home to this interesting singer songwriter and his biography is one that would make you want to take notice of his music and his words of hard earned experience. Mark has at various intervals worked as a mechanic, a commercial fisherman, a carpenter and a farmer. His road has been filled with interesting encounters along the way and these inform his songwriting, as can only be expected. This is his third album release and he previously performed in the band Uncle Buckle.\n\nThere are a number of quirky moments on the album and at just 38 minutes, the fourteen songs don’t overstay their welcome, making the listening experience very enjoyable. Scratch asks the question and answers it by listing a series of places where people stop, to take a moment and .. scratch! An interesting choice to open the album and there is a distinct nod to Stan Ridgeway on the song Davenport with fine backing harmonies and a song about just lounging in the yard on a large sofa. Inertia celebrates the fine art of idleness and the urge to do nothing in the face of mounting chores and tasks. The fun of Happy Hour is paired with some mean guitar licks as the craziness of family life plays out. The calypso groove of Gasoline Hands is addictive, with a deep bass line, jazzy percussion and female chorus line.\n\nThe songs Long Time, Broken Glass and God Bless Me Jesus have a nice Country influence in the arrangements, and the final track The Unanswered Prayer is a nice acoustic coda to a very engaging album that throws up many surprises. Mark Brown wrote all the songs and delivers on lead vocals and guitar. He is joined by Ken McGloin (guitar), Mark Murphy (bass), Dean Sharp (drums), Dean Jones (banjo, keyboards, vocals), Dakota Holden (pedal steel), Katie Mullins (vocals). Both Jones and McGloin handled the production duties and the results are very rewarding.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nBilly Eli Lace Self Release\n\nThis is another solid country album produced by Ed Tree at his Californian Treehouse Studio. It features a fine coterie of West Coast musicians, including bassist Taras Prodaniuk, Dale Daniels on drums, pedal steel players Kevin Maul (in the main), Jim Hemphill's additional guitars, and Jaycee Maness. Teresa James adds harmony vocals, and Ed Tree covers almost everything else. One track, All Day, features another stalwart of the scene, who has also recently released a Tree-produced album, Davis Serby.\n\nEli naturally handles all the lead vocals with the confidence and assurance of an artist who has been around the block a time or two. He has a knack for writing (or co-writing) a melody that translates to tracks and immediately becomes memorable. The opening two tracks fit this overview, with Trying To Drown and You're The Wine being graced by guitar riffs that are both effective. Both are slices of the everyday - dealing with the day-to-day and looking at the love there is in good company rather than in simply an alcoholic intake. That theme of seeking solace or empathy follows in songs like Hey Maria, Here's To You, it appears, to these ears at least.\n\nThe pastime of consumption, though in very different contexts, is a thread that runs through the titles Drinking To The Angels, Anejo Nights and Wine In The Desert. All Day features what might be the most unlikely sound in a country of song, and that is the electric sitar, which is highly effective in adding a different sonic tack. Spending the day in a place that was an unexpected and unwanted stop in a schedule is the subject of Getting Out Of Denver with its tale of being snowbound in that city's airport for an extended period so that \"the airport bar is starting to feel like home\" and the realisation that he has \"got 20 more hours to go as the runway is covered up in snow.\"\n\nThe album's ten song inclusions show that Eli is comfortable in his skin and, in his own way, a part of the legacy that has been central to West Coast country for quite some time from the likes of Buck Owens and Dwight Yoakam through to some of the new, younger artist emerging. Eli sits somewhere between by delivering his take on that sound, which he denotes as Americana, that is not about breaking down barriers but more about following a personal mission to bring his songs to the best place he can. He succeeds with that under the helm of Tree and the other musicians involved.\n\nThe warm tones of Eli's vocals help make this an easy listen without ever becoming 'easy listening.' It sits easily alongside previous Eli albums without any radical change in direction and shows his growth and maturity as a singer/songwriter who has woven all his attributes into something worthy of your consideration.\n\nStephen Rapid\n\nCharlie Overbey In Good Company Lone Hawk\n\nFollowing his previous E.P. and album, this new set of songs is aptly titled as it features a host of guest players joining him on various tracks. Many of these friends contribute not only as vocalists but also as players. The vocal performances come from Jamie Wyatt, Eddie Spaghetti, Sarah Gayle Meech, Courtney Santana and Nils Lofgren, who also adds his guitar skills to the track he guests on. Other six-string guitar slingers include Charlie Starr, Chris Masterson, Stuart Mathis, Danny B Harvey and Duane Betts. In one song, Jon Graboff adds pedal steel, while Rami Jaffee adds a variety of keyboards. These artists, alongside the many other contributions from the committed crew, were under the captainship of Californian Charlie Overbey. As the opening song denotes (\"I'm a punk rock spy in the house of the honky tonk heaven … but punk and honky go together\"), this is an album with as much rock' n' roll in its bloodstream as that of underlying country influences. Undoubtedly influenced by the time when Overbey was a member of an L.A. cow-punk band, Custom Made Scare, from around the 2000s, who were a big part of that scene back then.\n\nThe ten songs explore that premise of rock' n' swagger. The music leans more towards the kind of Stones-ish sense of country influences rather than anything more traditional country. The themes also play this out with tracks such as Champagne, Cocaine, Cadillacs and Cash, Life of Rock & Roll and Punk Rock Spy. The guitars rock and the keyboards swirl over the solid bass and drum foundation, which drives things along nicely with moments of Southern rock, outlaw country making themselves felt. Somewhat more heartland in tone is The Innocence, which has guitar and vocals from Nils Lofgren, a musician who himself had been at the centre of that genre in the past.\n\nBut there are moments of quieter reflection, such as Dear Captain, which features some integral soulful harmony vocals from Sarah Gayle and Lori Ottino and some subtle guitar for Johnny Stachella. That rock and soul influence carries over to Let Me Love You with guest Jimmy Vivino and keyboards, guitar and call and response backing vocals. The whole thing is a passage through life, and life pretty much in the company of the ups and downs that accrue along its highways. Other moments are more straight-up twangs, with Miss Me utilising Graboff's steel guitar with piano and, again, the vocals of Sarah Gayle Meech. This is followed by another solidly twang-laden reminisce in Two Minute Marvin, about a man who is less than worthy of the woman who should be with him; it features Danny B Harvey on guitars.\n\nThere is more than one string to Overby's bow, as he is also a renowned and sought-after hat maker for the stars of both movies and music. This is just another tangent of a long and doubtless hard enough journey to where he is now and the reason that his creative path has been his own.\n\nHowever, it is Overbey who is at the heart of these recordings; even in good company, he is the main man who not only produced, wrote, and played acoustic guitar and drums but also added a believable, gritty, and upfront vocal to each track, which has that level of authenticity that is essential for good listening in whatever company you may be in.\n\nStephen Rapid\n\nMatt Castillo Pushing Borders Texace\n\nMatt Castillo has a signature sound and a recognisable voice, making this new release something to take notice of. With real bite, beat and ambition the album will only help define how traditional country has its place in the marketplace. It has got the right elements of 90s country down to a tee. It helps, of course, that the man at the helm here, Roger Brown, both as producer and co-writer of many of the songs with Castillo, is an artist himself, an award-winning songwriter, and a producer with a vast experience of numerous Americana formats but also with a definite understanding of how to make a record that sounds as good as it does. Of course, Castillo himself adds his own stamp and definition with a blend of his Texas upbringing and his border lineage, which features accordion and some Spanish as vital and standout ingredients. There are immediate reminders in this sound blend of similar tracks by Dwight Yoakam and Rick Trevino - an artist later produced by the equally like-minded Mavericks' leader Raul Malo.\n\nThis album, though, stands on its own strengths with track after track sounding like a possible single - not something that you can really say about every new album. The themes cover the tribulations of the working man (Working For The Man), the contrast between hoping a relationship will flourish and for rain to fall (If It Rains Today) and, of course, songs dealing with all aspects of love, be it lost, found or continued. Almost, Got Get Her, wherein he wonders if he's such a go-getter why didn't he get her. Trail Of Love, Mañana Blues , and I'm Hurting all continue his upbeat tales of woe.\n\nCastillo has understandable energy given his relative age and an overview that seems beyond his years with his fulsome vocal efficaciousness. This may be because he has partnered with veteran co-writers such as Brown, Byron Hill and Tommy Connors. Particular mention is also warranted to the players here, especially the accordion contributions of Michael Rojas and Jeff Taylor, the lead guitar of James Mitchell and Eddy Dunlap's pedal steel. That assembled team is a major part of the album's success. It is a prime example of all aspects of the project being complementary. This extends to the album cover, which is equally considered and shows that the whole release was been given the attention it deserved to bring it to another level.\n\nWith two full albums and an EP under his belt, Castillo can use this base to further build his career. He is currently an independent artist who has expanded his horizons, as befits the album title. This may well be part of why his sound is as it is today, and even if that changes when the possibility of a major label signing arises, it will expectantly mean not so much a change of direction as the option to court a wider audience while, if anything, solidifying his strong traditional roots.\n\nFor me, this is another contender for one of the best albums released so far this year, placed alongside the likes of the new albums from George Ducas and Jesse Daniel, also in that category. If you hanker for the drive and distinctiveness of the best of the music that emerged in the mainstream in the 90s, then this is a release that should be sought out and savoured.\n\nStephen Rapid\n\nJude Shiels, Rainy Eyes, Maya de Vitry, Michael Waugh, The Grng0 Pistoleros, Mark Brown (Uncle Buckle), Billy Eli (The UnExplainable Billy Eli & The Amazing Spooklights), Charlie Overbey Music, and Matt Castillo Music\n\nDarin & Brooke Aldridge Talk Of The Town Billy Blue\n\nNorth Carolina’s much loved bluegrass and Americana duo, Darin & Brooke Aldridge have returned with their tenth studio album and their best yet. They are a match made in heaven: Darin with his pedigree in bluegrass (starting off as a young instrumentalist in Acoustic Syndicate, followed by joining The Country Gentlemen) and his songwriting and production skills, and Brooke as fourtime IBMA Vocalist of the Year with her background in gospel and country. Her instrument is her voice, and she approaches Emmylou’s pedigree with her crystal clear tone and reach. Not surprising then that they chose the Desert Rose Band’s Price I Pay as the opening track, one that has, of course, been covered by Emmylou since her Nash Ramblers days. Not only that, but they called in old friend and guitar whizz John Jorgenson to help out on vocals and lead guitar. That opening song also gives the album its title and Brooke says that it resonates with her because it reflects exactly how she felt when she initially started dating Darin when she was at college and he was away for extended periods of time touring.\n\nAlthough honouring the deep roots of the bluegrass tradition, the couple have always been influenced by country, gospel, folk and West Coast rock, and Brooke is quoted as saying that they ‘decided to really do that this time and not be bound down to one thing … to just be us’. Four of the songs are self-penned and the remaining eight are a selection of well chosen new and old classics from across those genres. The stand out gospel song of the three has to be Lori McKenna’s Jordan, where they’re joined by Mo Pitney on vocals and Ricky Skaggs on mandolin and vocals (check out the video). The self-penned Same Old New Love is an instant ear worm, as is another love song, Here We Are, from the pen of Beth Nielsen Chapman and Vince Gill. The latter also guests on vocals on A Million Memories, his moving tribute to the much missed fiddler, Byron Berline, who passed away in 2021.\n\nHank Snow’s classic country heartbreaker, A Fool Such As I, is simply gorgeous, with Stuart Duncan on fiddle, Mark Fain (who also co-produced with Darin) on acoustic bass, Brent Rader’s keys and Eddie Dunlap’s pedal steel. They are also joined on various tracks by the cream of bluegrass musicians, including Matt Menefee, Cody Kilby, Samantha Snyder, Jacob Metz and Lynn Williams.\n\nAlready a contender for my album of the year, I urge you to seek it out.\n\nEilís Boland\n\nJack Garton Original Skin Demon Squadron\n\nI love it when an album defies category and that all-too-common need to try and squeeze the creative talent of the artist into some definable box. Before the onset of large record labels and their desire to market ‘product’ to an unsuspecting public, there was the timeless creative energy that fuses all music together into a creative whole, with no categorization, and where the joy of the song was more than enough.\n\nWell, this album will certainly give the listener plenty of food for thought as the fourteen tracks visit many different genres as they weave their way into your consciousness across an hour of eclectic music. The PR sheet describes the music as both Folk and Roots and there are indeed such influences at play. However the essence of the album is in the willingness to push the creative process into new areas and to try and make something that is of lasting value. Jack Garton is known in his native Canada as a musician who has collaborated with groups such as Viper Central and Petunia and the Vipers, among others, over a long career. He has released two prior solo albums, with the last appearing pre-Covid, in 2018. This album is like a dear-diary entry, as it traces the journey taken over the years of gigging, living on the road, meeting all sorts of characters and being given time to reflect upon the life lived and the memories that linger.\n\nYou will be hooked from the opening song Watching Kurosawa and a hugely enjoyable peek into the life of a night shift security guard, and movie freak, who keeps crushing boredom at bay by replacing the security monitor tape with favourite films to watch. Making the mundane bearable through such tiny victories in rebellion – pure songwriting genius... ‘I'm working hard, hardly working, my boss here is a jerk’ - the graveyard shift has never felt so attractive.\n\nGarton plays a whole range of instruments and is mostly known for his prowess on accordion and trumpet. Both feature regularly along with an array of other instruments from the studio musicians who recorded mostly in a live studio setting for that sense of spontaneity and to capture that special chemistry. Noah Walker (electric and acoustic guitar, musical cartography), Jodie Ponto (drums, percussion, backup vocals, album photography), Steven Charles (upright and electric bass, piano, baritone guitar, backup vocals), Corwin Fox (banjo, backup vocals, emotional support), all play key roles throughout the songs and Garton contributes on lead vocals, accordion, trumpet, Rhodes, organ, piano, classical and acoustic guitars, mellophone, secret reeds. There are additional vocals by Ashley Robyn and Carolyn Mark that also add great colour to the song arrangements.\n\nComing Back To Life Again is a song about the onset of Spring and the optimism of new beginnings amid a happy sound with an uplifting melody. There is a doo-wop vibe on Decoy Love while the Cajun groove on Good Times echoes an Elvis Costello vocal in tone, with a cool piano motif. Christina is all horns and keyboard swells while the playful Western Shirt has a pure Country sound and a cool delivery.\n\nRock n’ Roll on Berkeley In the Springtime surfaces with a great backbeat and rhythmic bass fills. The slow blues on I Can’t Trust My Heart Anymore turns into a Rockabilly celebration on Hey Grandad and another great groove. Things become somewhat reflective on The Real Thing and the stripped down piano reflects that ‘Sometimes the real thing is the same as the dream.’ Surf rock mixes it up with a Tex-Mex dynamic on the instrumental Stovetop Coffee which features plenty of Link Wray guitar attack.\n\nWhere the Mystery Is has a nice tempo and an acoustic feel as the writer looks back to capture old memories, and that youthful reminiscence continues on the final song The Field, a real Magnum Opus that clocks in at thirteen minutes of spoken vocal and a chorus that looks at old neighbourhood and school memories where lots of old ghosts are lurking in the environment ‘Meet me out at the field, we’ll try our bodies on for size, and we’ll see what gets revealed, under the light of open skies.’ If you can bottle childhood rites of passage, then this song does it’s best to cover growing up, feelings of attraction towards the opposite sex, football games, classroom fights and standoffs, gym class, locker rooms and the drama of the schoolyard, all captured with acoustic guitars, banjo picking and sweet harmony vocals. It’s the perfect end to a very impressive album and one that will bring many hours of pleasure. Highly recommended.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nBobbo Byrnes Self-Titled Self Release\n\nGrowing up just north of the Boston, in the state of Massachusetts Bobbo was fond of reading the novels and poetry of Jack Kerouac. The words of the beat generation pioneer would instil a sense of adventure into any impressionable youth, but the difference with Bobbo Byrnes is that he acted upon his growing sense of inquiry and he took his wanderlust onto American highways in search of his dreams. Relocating to California, Bobbo lived the life of the roving troubadour and played in various collaborations over the years. His musical skills became quite honed during his time with The Fallen Stars (four studio albums, a few Eps and a live recording) and then, with Riddle and the Stars (two albums).\n\nJump forward to 2017 and the release of a debut album as a solo artist; a move that saw Bobbo speed into the distance with a strong work ethic, and no little talent, as he continued his musical adventures. Now, some six solo albums later, Bobbo has decided to release a self-titled album and the results are hugely enjoyable. If you liken a journey in music to a winding road of no fixed destination, sprinkled with plenty of interesting stops along the way, then Bobbo has seen it all over years of gigging across the USA and Europe. His sound is certainly what we describe these days as Americana with his leanings more towards the Rock side of that broad category. Put simply, he just makes great music.\n\nThe album opens with the rocking rhythm and inventive guitar of Around Here, a song about having to leave the local scene of his youth in order to develop and grow. The next track I Cannot Say follows in a similar vein with jangling guitar and a strong melody line that echoes thoughts of addiction and character traits that are best kept monitored and under control. He is such a fine guitar player and the band are really tight in the dynamic delivery. Bobbo plays various guitars, mandolin, organ, pedal steel, piano and takes lead vocals throughout. He is joined by his wife Tracy Byrnes (vocals, bass), Matt Froehlich (vocals, drums), with Brian Matteson and Ben Riddle (backing vocals) and Allen Morris guesting on bass for one song, completing the line-up.\n\nPlain Street slows things in tempo with a nicely spaced arrangement and thoughts of nocturnal activities. Too Many Miles is a standout song with a slow pulse in the backbeat and nice organ sounds to augment the winsome vocal of Bobbo. It deals with relationship issues and the too-often breakdown of real communication; again, some stellar guitar licks here to enjoy. Bad Decisions is another rocker with attitude and aims towards the urge of letting it all go ‘I want to make some bad decisions, come on let’s get a tattoo.’ The tempo changes up a gear during the song and delivers an interesting work-out that creates a fine energy.\n\nSome Salvation is a country influenced song arrangement with warm organ sound and great harmony vocals. Glad and Sorry is a standout with a hypnotic guitar riff that lingers, and again, memorable harmony backup. The final two songs use pedal steel to great atmospheric effect and the lengthy Chance is a real tour de force. Bobbo double tracks his guitar sound and the layering really enhances the enjoyment of the album; all bright and celebratory in the excellent production. In terms of a back catalogue there is no disputing the consistency and real quality on offer from this impressive singer songwriter. He should be on everybody’s radar that seeks to purchase music of enduring quality and excellence.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nLuther Black and the Cold Hard Facts Let The Light Back In Self Release\n\nA fine, understated album that largely stays with the low-key unhurried arrangements of some finely balanced songs. The band is fronted by writer, producer and multi-instrumentalist Rick Wagner. The album sets out its stall with the opening Tom Petty song, Room At The Top, a sad reflection on isolation which immediately brought to mind the latter day work of Elliot Murphy (as mentioned in a previous review) as well of its author. That world-falling-apart awareness is a frequent theme, one that is enhanced by the similar tone of his vocals that have enough gravel to indicate a real understanding of life, love and loss. Also covered is the soul classic That’s How Strong My Love Is which has its own soulful qualities without trying to be a carbon copy, but rather a rendition with a similar feeling and an incisive spirit.\n\nPicking up the tempo and the wish to attempt to give it one more shot is the place that Ain’t Nothing Good About Goodbye takes us to. It has the assembled band of Wagner, drummer Jonathan Kampner, and additional slide and lap steel guitar from Lance Doss. Matt Wissler adds occasional mandolin and Brandi Thompson brings her background vocals to Black And Blue. However it is Wagner front and centre as producer, musician, writer and vocalist. This is indisputably his baby, under the Luther Black headline banner.\n\nThe sense of traveling a difficult path is alluded to with mentions of “highway of regret” and the “long and lonesome road.” Ain’t Nothing Good About Goodbye tries to foster a mood of reconciliation to get back on track and give it one more try. It is rendered with a more full on band sound that feels more heartland rock than anything. The gentler and moodier approach is taken for Lost In The Rye, with the lap steel adding a sense of the feeling of loss. The grittiness in the vocal mirrors the regret that is that nothing ache like a memory; one that is not only for people, once a part of a person’s life, but also of music and places that have become, with the metaphor of location again, like Ghosts On The Boulevard. The ominous siren that opens in the background of Black And Blue offers a dark indication in a tale of racism and harsh realism. Wagner’s delivery is more spoken than shouted and more telling for that approach.\n\nAcoustic guitar and drum beat open the plea that is Let The Light Back In, which asks for some faith in human nature. Understated and effective. The Rest Of My Days is listed as a live version but it is again performed with a quiet subtly that makes it seem to be a live in the studio take rather than a venue recording. There is a sense of completing a full circle with the stripped back acoustic guitar, harmonica and voice of Coming Home, a realisation that the time has finally come to make that, often difficult, decision to take the road back to where you started out from.\n\nAll of the Luther Black and The Cold Hard Facts releases have delivered on different levels without really ever troubling the mainstream or media heights, yet Wagner continues to deliver his own personal take on life, love with a musical direction to fit an individual persona to light his path.\n\nStephen Rapid\n\nKaren Jonas The Rise And Fall Of American Kitsch Self Release\n\nThere is an obvious energy in the recording of the songs in this the latest album (her seventh) from Karen Jonas, which may be because it was recorded live in the studio. Jonas declares herself a lover of vintage kitsch, from a time when there was an optimism for the future and a love of the past. This album may well be full of that kind of positive expectancy. Something apparent from the opening album track Rich Man’s Valley is a summary of her rags to riches story of success, from a dirt poor background growing up in Poor Valley,Virginia to her rise and success and move to the heights of fame and more prosperous circumstances. From then on this is an album of songs that are a testament to Jonas’ growth as writer, singer and band leader. The album was helmed by engineer Blaine Misner over a three day session, in close consultation with Jonas’ long term foil, guitarist Tim Bray, who manages to touch base on numerous country guitar sounds of the past while bringing things right into focus for today’s audience. The rhythm section of Seth Morrissey and Ben Tufts provided the forward motion, and the additional vintage flavourings came from steel player Ahren Buchheister, Booby Hawk’s fiddle and keyboards from Benji Porecki. A solid, distinguished team indeed who are able to adapt with ease to the given instrumental setting required, of which there are a lot of different scenarios on offer; from straight country to touches of soul, blues and swing.\n\nGiven the album title it’s not surprising that the presence of Elvis is omnipresent too. A fair number of the songs including Four Cadillacs, Call Dr Nick, Shake Bump and Grind and Mama’s Gone all deal with aspects of Presley’s ongoing myths, legend and magnetism. Inspired in part by the recent biographical movie which painted a largely bright and in your face portrait of the star’s rise, the fall doesn’t feature in these musings. Other stops along the shopping mall of kitsch and sink offer an ode which features a list of purchases available to the home procurer, with some sonic steel and twang laden guitar to help this sale of Online Shopping. Another features those Plastic Pink Flamingos while tells us of the heightened reality of a woman obsessed with those mimicked sham birds. While the ambition of Let’s Go To Hawaii is of a housewife’s dream to persuade her husband to go on a vacation to the island of here dreams, it’s not surprising that it gives a nod to Jonas’ love of the music and storytelling of Jimmy Buffett on the journey (as well as the movie career of that sunburned, sideburned icon). There is a distinctly more Vegas lounge feel to the post wedding chapel carousel in Gold In The Sand. American Kitsch is a narration with a subtle atmospheric setting that, more than anywhere, by the focus on the words, shows her talent as a consummate wordsmith.\n\nPerhaps it’s not surprising that there is a sense of fun, both in the arrangements and delivery, as there is in Jonas’ lyrical direction, which is smart, engaging and an exercise in taking a long established format and giving it a new coat of paint. But it is also a sign of her maturity as a vocalist of no mean ability, who is able to take on the various guises necessary to bring these songs to life. The understanding that occurs between all parties is apparent with the ease with which they can give each song a different perspective ,while never losing focus of an overall vision and vocabulary. It is surprising that Jonas isn’t more lauded overall, as she is deserving of that ahead of many of her contemporaries who have far bigger budgets to utilise, thanks to major label involvement. Yet perhaps what she has gained is the space to develop and control of what she writes and records. That may count for more in the long run for any independent (or otherwise) artist. Much to savour in this ode to the pleasures of kitsch and country music - the real kind.\n\nStephen Rapid\n\nGeorge Dearborne Lotta Honky Tonkin’ Left In Me Self Release\n\nThis album has been receiving a lot of praise as an example of honky tonk at its best. Deservedly so and with a lot of music aimed at the same demographic coming out of Texas, it is even more admirable. I have to admit that this is my first aquaintance with the music of Beaumont singer George Dearborne. He plays traditional based country music with a passion and purpose that will appeal to the growing number of listeners who want something that is imbued with the honky tonk.\n\nThe album was produced by an avowed veteran of the format in Jimmy Ritchey, a man who knows what he is about and also adds his guitar and writing talents to the album. He had a hand in co-writing five of the cuts and assembled a band of solid Nashville A-teamers such as Brent Mason, Jim ‘Moose’ Brown, Glen Worf, Larry Franklin, Mike Johnson, B. James Lowery, Shannon Forest and background vocalists Pam Willis and Wes Hightower. You couldn’t ask for a better selection of players if you wanted a real country album, musicians whose credits have appeared on numerous critically acclaimed recordings in the past. They prove their worth again here.\n\nDearborne is a top notch vocalist, who is not a writer on this outing but an old school interpreter of songs that define the genre. A couple may be know to some, such as Muddy Waters or Haggard’s Fighting Side Of Me. The others maybe not, but they are chosen with care and are perfect for an album with this title. Writers like Jim Lauderdale, Whitey Schafer, Pam Willis and Cledus T. Judd have form in this particular rodeo. There are also, maybe surprisingly to some but not those who know, a couple of songs written by the late great Doug Sahm. Dearborne has been around since the 70s as, initially, a drummer before forming his own band that played in Beaumont, a place that also claims George Jones, Mark Chestnutt and Tracy Byrd as their own and can now add Dearborne to that list of acclaimed vocalists. He has a previous 2020 album, OLD BROWN BOTTLE, that included original songs and which was also produced by Ritchey. However, it is this album that will hopefully turn the spotlight on his aptitude.\n\nThese songs sit at the bar of heartbreak and try to drown their sorrows, as do so many of those who need to immerse themselves in that sadness to feel happy. For many, this is the kernel of what real country music does, as indeed does much of the blues, both forms dealing in that emotion and in creating music that in its misery finds a lot of company. There isn’t a misstep or out of place tune here and, when the album is finished, you want to go back to the beginning to appreciate how good it is one more time.\n\nFrom start to finish, these fifteen tracks help define the music that has seemingly been absent for so long, but in truth has always been around, if you looked hard enough. This year alone there have been a number of artists who will make it hard pressed for an aficionado to choose the top ten honky tonk albums of 2024. This is most definitely a contender for that particular accolade.\n\nStephen Rapid\n\nMartha Fields Bramble Bridge Self-Release\n\nNamed after a bridge in Wayne County, West Virginia, Martha Fields' latest album sticks to her well-tried template of country, blues, and rock and roll. A proud Appalachian who wears her heart on her sleeve, she fuses the sounds of East Kentucky and West Virginia of her childhood with the Texan and Okie country music handed down from her father.\n\nFields divides her time between Bordeaux, France and Texas. She performs regularly in France, Italy, Belgium, Spain and Switzerland, playing festivals, headline and private shows backed by her regular players and backing vocalists, Manu Bertrand (dobro, mandolin, banjo, guitar), Olivier Leclerc (violin), Urbain Lambert (guitar), Serge Samyn (bass, fiddle). Denis Bielsa completes the lineup on drums.\n\nRecorded in France and mixed in Nashville by Grammy winner Sean Sullivan, BRAMBLE BRIDGE features eleven tracks, ten originals and a five-minute version of the traditional gospel song, Wayfaring Stranger. Field's material may be primarily impacted by her childhood exposure to the music that surrounded her. Still, Biscay Bay and Country Roads Of France have their origins in her adopted country of recent years. The latter tells the tale of the joys and stresses of long days and nights on the road from show to show; the former pays homage to the peacefulness and serenity of a place close to her heart. Party Marty is a fun-filled and funked-up ditty and opener All I Know could have been plucked from Rodney Crowell's songbook.\n\nBRAMBLE BRIDGE replicates what Martha Fields has been dishing out on all her studio albums. Songs forged from traditional and more modern country roots supported by a bunch of exceptional musicians are once more the order of the day. What's not to love about that?\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nDavid Newbould Live In Germany Blackbird\n\nCoincidentally, this album review comes shortly after I witnessed a blistering live set by David Newbould and his band at the Static Roots Festival in Germany. Many of the tracks on the album featured in his fifty-minute setlist at the festival, and the added bonus on the album is another twenty minutes of mostly full-on rock and roll across eighteen tracks.\n\nBorn in Toronto, Canada, Newbould has previously spent time honing his skills in New York and Austin. He is now an integral part of the multi-genre music scene in East Nashville. His former band members include the much-lauded Dan Baird and drummer Brad Pemberton, who is a member of Steve Earle’s backing band The Dukes and has previously worked with Ryan Adams and Brendan Benson.\n\nThe lion’s share of the material on LIVE IN GERMANY is taken from Newbould’s 2019 record SIN & REDEMPTION and POWER UP! from 2022. Also included are a few covers that readers will be familiar with: Neil Young’s Powderfinger and Don’t It Make You Wanna Dance? written by the late Rusty Wier. The closest live recording that comes to mind with this record is Young’s WELD, so it’s little surprise that a song by Newbould’s fellow Canadian features.\n\nThe highest praise I can pour on Newbould’s material is that many of the songs have that ‘where did I hear that before?’ quality. Particularly of note are the face-melters Peeler Park, Sin & Redemption, and Sensitive Heart, the latter bringing to mind a pumped-up Tom Petty delivery. Jean is a short and snappy dose of rootsy power-pop, and the mid-tempo Home Depot Glasses is a tribute to John Prine, written by Newbould the day after he passed away.\n\nIf Neil Young, backed by Crazy Horse or the crunching no-holds-barred rock of Rich Hopkins & The Luminarios rock your boat, you’ll love this. Thumbs up to Newbould’s band members, Adam Dalton on guitar and backing vocals, Joel Strandberg on bass and backing vocals, and Tommy Goss on drums for their injection of energy and buzz on the recordings.\n\nThese days, it can be a case of having to scratch beneath the surface to unearth twin guitar-driven roots rock, so albums like this are a breath of fresh air. Headphones and full volume are essential for maximum return.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nMelissa Carper Borned In Ya Mae Music/Thirty Tigers\n\nOur introduction to the musical world of Texan Melissa Carper came about in 2021 when we reviewed her album DADDY'S COUNTRY GOLD and subsequently interviewed her. Born into a musical family and performing from the age of twelve with her family's four-piece, The Carper Band, her musical journey included studying music at college in Nebraska, getting immersed in the vocalists Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald, and becoming obsessed with blues legend Leadbelly.\n\nTaking a leaf out of all their books, Carper's vocal phrasing and devotion to old-time country, jazz, and blues have rung true in her impressive catalogue of albums, both solo and with her other projects, Sad Daddy, Buffalo Gals Band, and her more recent collaboration with Brennen Leigh and Kelly Willis, Wonder Women of Country.\n\nCarper's latest album takes its title from a quote from Ralph Stanley, ('I don't think you can get this sound unless it's borned in ya,'). Sticking with the formula that worked so well on her two last recordings, the aforementioned DADDY'S COUNTRY GOLD and RAMBLIN' GOLD from 2022, this album was recorded at Andrija Tokic's Bomb Shelter Studios in East Nashville and features a number of the players that also guested on those albums. Household names like Dennis Crouch, who co-produced with Tokic, Chris Scruggs, Chris Gelb, Sierra Ferrell, Matt Combs and Billy Contreras all lent a hand. Working with that talented crew contributed boundlessly to Carper's distinctive and flawless silver-voiced deliveries.\n\nThat’s My Desire, previously recorded by Patsy Cline and one of two covers included on the album, and You're Furniture's Too Nice recall an era when dinner-jacketed gents and their costume-dressed wives and girlfriends dined in elegant surroundings, entertained by Billie Holiday. The second cover is a splendid rendition of Cole Porter's Every Time We Say Goodbye. The title and opening track is a gospel-flavoured affair, and There'll Be Another One, including strings and orchestration, is a countrypolitan treasure. Old-time jazz is modelled in Let's Get Outta Here, and Evil Eva is a shot of early rhythm and blues.\n\nA comforting suite of soothing tracks that sound like they have been around forever, unique may be an overused word lazily used to benchmark certain artists. In the case of Melissa Carper, it is true in every respect.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nLinks: Darin & Brooke Aldridge, Jack Garton Music, Luther Black and the Cold Hard Facts, Karen Jonas, George Dearborne, Martha Fields Band, David Newbould, Melissa Carper\n\nAlice Wallace Here I Am Mule Kick\n\nThe latest album by Alice Wallace was constructed around some life-changing episodes endured by the Nashville-based artist at the time of writing. Not afraid to lay bare her vulnerabilities, she bravely visited emotionally raw terrain across the eleven songs. Wallace moved to Music City four years ago after spending a decade in California, where she was named Female Vocalist of the Year in 2017 by the California Country Awards. HERE I AM was recorded in two days at The Loft and The Studio in Nashville and features some Music City top-notch session players. Despite being written and recorded in Nashville, the sound is very much in the classic West Coast country rock school.\n\nIt may or may not have been an anticipation of approaching thunderstorms and difficult times when Wallace named her 2019 album INTO THE BLUE. Either way, it cemented her reputation as a leading light in modern country music and most likely to achieve household recognition. As with others, her momentum was halted by the arrival of COVID-19 and the personal issues she was dealing with. However, the lockdown didn't find Wallace sitting on her hands; quite the opposite. Teaming up with fellow singer-songwriter Caitlin Cannon, they formed their side project Side Pony, writing and eventually recording an album, ironically called LUCKY BREAK. A mixture of powerhouse retro-pop and country ballads, the duo aired the songs via often hilarious live streams until the world opened up again, and they headed off on tour, Thelma and Louise style.\n\nHERE I AM finds Wallace returning to her tried and trusted template of heart-melting and confessional songs delivered in her note-perfect and stunning voice. 'Someday someone's gonna find out my biggest secret, I know they will. It's just a matter of time….. I've worked damn hard off for this epic fall from grace,' she ponders on the album's opening track, Imposter. An arrow straight to the heart and an admission of self-doubt and uneasiness, it's an opening chapter for what follows, songs that may have been testing to write but ultimately lead to emotional release.\n\nThat self-doubt surfaces in the beautifully expressed country ballad, I Was Wrong, and the equally soul-searching Dancin' to the Beat of My Heartbeat. The two tracks emphasise Wallace's ability to vocally shift confidently between the calm and the muscular. Her close friend Caitlin Cannon shares songwriting credits on the soulful Better Than This and the title track. Both songs, not surprisingly, have their emphasis on the positive rather than the negative.\n\nSunken and unfulfilled dreams may have provided the ammunition for HERE I AM, but the lasting impression after each subsequent listen is one of acceptance, rebirth, and renewed confidence. Alice Wallace may have encountered a mid-career wobble, but she is back to her best with a confident swagger with this easy-on-the-ear collection of most impressive songs.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nCyrena Wages Vanity Project Self-Release\n\nDespite previously being a member of three bands and landing a record and publishing deal with her first band, Friends of Lola, Memphis-born Cyrena Wages has had to wait until her early thirties to release her debut album, VANITY PROJECT. Ironic and cynical as the title may seem, the ten-track album digs deeply into Wages' upbringing from her early childhood as a pageant queen, the demands of a small-town religious upbringing in the south, spreading her wings and moving to Nashville with stars in her eyes, and the resulting frustrations of a decade in that city.\n\nBorn and raised in Millington, Shelby County, Tennessee, into a musical family, she was exposed to Stax soul music and old-time country by her parents from an early age. However, what left the most lasting impression on Wages was her years on the pageant circuit ('I think it's the most screwed up thing in the world, it's like everything that's wrong with the conditioning of Southern women'). The move to Nashville after high school was also far from memorable and resulted in disillusion and rejection despite working the system, recording formulaic music that never got released, and eventually returning to Memphis. The tales of unfulfilled and broken dreams could have ended there, but with innumerable memories to draw on, Wages translated those headaches into ten often dramatic songs.\n\nEvoking the sound of Memphis more so than Music City, the soulful instrumentation and overall vibe supplied Wages with the perfect platform for her soaring multi-octave vocals. Having worked on the songwriting with R&B and jazz guitarist Joe Restivo, that Memphis connection was cemented by engaging Matt Ross-Spang as producer and recording at his now-famous Southern Grooves Studio in Crosstown.\n\nStandout tracks are the mid-tempo opener Are We Allowed to Fall in Love and the title track, which particularly hits the bullseye. The fluidity of Carried Away recalls Frazey Ford at her most soulful, and the bittersweet Heartbreaker is a nostalgic tearjerker.\n\nVery much a 'beauty born out of chaos' album and one written under the pandemic blues umbrella, VANITY PROJECT is a body of work by an artist who may be a late bloomer but has kicked off her recording career in fine style.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nKiely Connell My Own Company Thirty Tigers\n\nThere has been a marked increase in confessional and open-hearted recordings in the past few years, following the pandemic and enforced lockdown. Dealing with mental health issues, relationship breakdowns and substance abuse, the majority of these recordings are from women, a pointer towards their new fearlessness in publicly bearing their souls by confronting thorny issues. The subject matter has generated credible songwriting and several standout albums, rather than anything sounding manufactured or industry-formulated. Recent albums by Sarah Gayle Meech, Amelia White and Diane Coll immediately come to mind.\n\nIndiana-native, Nashville-based country and roots artist Kiely Connell's sophomore album, produced by Tucker Martine (Neko Case, REM, The Jayhawks), falls into this category. It charts traumatic memories, a broken relationship, body shaming and, most importantly, recovery and rebirth.\n\nRestless Bones revives bitter memories of the funeral of a high school friend after she took her own life. A haunting and image-generating song, it stands shoulder to shoulder with Lucinda Williams' Pineola in detailing the trauma of unexpectedly losing a close friend. Consent, entitlement and the mixed signals of modern dating are aired in the fiery Damn Hands, with Connell vocally spitting fire in front of a rugged guitar riff. The excesses, both liquid and pharmaceutical, all too easy to fall foul of the routine life of the artist, are addressed in Through To You. It's a particularly slick slice of roots rock that recalls Kathleen Edwards at her most animated. Connell's weather-beaten vocals on Anaesthesia channel the numbness and isolation endured at the lowest ebb after a relationship break up.\n\nThe album concludes with a committed and reinvigorated theme following the confessional and darker material. On The Mend points towards moving on from life's complexities, and the title track is one of forging ahead as a free spirit ('Cause maybe I could still turn out to be the girl of my dreams and find that all I want to keep is my own company').\n\nKiely Connell has turned up the heat a number of notches with My Own Company. Her 2021 album CALUMET QUEEN was a striking introduction to a vocalist and songwriter not afraid to confront the darker side of hardship and survival. The savage intimacy and emotional outpourings on this album more than make good on the promise of that debut album. It's a riveting listening experience and a reminder that art often provides much more than simply entertainment. Let's hope it gets the exposure and attention it richly deserves.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nJason McNiff Everything’s A Song Tombola\n\nAn English songwriter of great repute, Jason McNiff brings his lyrical guitar style to a ninth album, just two years on from his last release Tonight We Ride, which was entirely focused of cover versions. He sings in a quiet vocal tone and the folk leanings in his writing provides the perfect foil for his gentle songs. Run Away With the Circus is an example of his independent persona and style, with the lines ‘My mind is a woman, my heart is a man, and together they do the best they can, I’m just a child with a childish plan, to run away with the circus.’ Clever wordplay and nice imagery to fuel the imagination. The electric guitar on These Dreams Of You is nicely knitted into the acoustic melody and a counterpoint to the sentiment of love unrequited.\n\nThere is no doubting the influence of Bert Jansch in these song stylings and I also hear the sweet tones of Mark Knopfler, especially on My Mississippi and True Love, Freedom. No bad thing either, as learning from your mentors and matching their inspiration in your own music is certainly carrying the torch forward. A cover version of Bella Ciao, a folk song from the 19th Century, is perhaps the only potential weak point, the arrangement sounding somewhat laboured and out of place on the album.\n\nThere is a story song called Chef Song in the best English folk traditions and the inclusion of Wedding Dance highlights the violin of Richard Moore along with Hammond organ on a sweetly performed instrumental. McNiff contributes on guitars and Hammond organ while producer Matt Armstrong adds bass, drums and percussion. Jude Montague appears on pump organ, Hammond organ, and vocals, alongside both McNiff and Armstrong.\n\nThere is a blues feel to No Good For You with a nice electric guitar solo that wraps the message ‘Too much truth is no good for you.’ The final song is the album title Everything’s A Song and draws joy from the simple things in life and takes a perspective that all experiences are part of an all embracing colourful vista. There is a light sense of playfulness throughout this enjoyable album and it’s another fine example of the talents on display from Jason McNiff.\n\nThe Electrics Big Pub In the Sky Self Release\n\nOriginally formed in 1988, this Celtic rock band from Dumbarton, Scotland, is comprised of Sammy Horner (vocals and bass guitar), Paul Baird (guitar), Dave McArthur (drums) and Allan Hewitt (saxophone, keyboards). Over subsequent years, various members came and went, while the band played on, and nine albums were released between 1991 and 2014. They never officially called it a day and any hiatus in subsequent years was occasionally punctuated by live gigs in different shapes and forms. There has always been an evident chemistry from the first time they played together that endures.\n\nOn this return project the original gang of four are joined by former member Tim Cotterell (fiddle, mandolin) who returns to the family, and the ten tracks are a joyous celebration of all that is good in the Celtic rock tradition. Yes, you will hear, on occasion, a sense of the Pogues in the boisterous arrangements, and at other times, the Waterboys, in the uplifting melodies and the vocal delivery of Sammy Horner, but throughout is the unmistakable edge that has made the Electrics such a celebrated act wherever they perform. Matters kick off with a global warming message in Big Train Coming and a sense that a day of reckoning is on the horizon if we are not willing to change our ways.\n\nBig Pub In the Sky and Fall From Grace are fine examples of the celebratory sound that the Electrics produce, with everything turned up full throttle and the clever lyrics sprinkling some magic dust upon proceedings. The River Flows and Happening To Me are more considered and highlight the softer, more lyrical side to the band as they contemplate their place in the greater scheme of things.\n\nWe All Have To Row is a prime example of the philosophical themes that are addressed, with the ocean of life tossing us on the waves of change in our little lives ‘ We’re in this boat together, and we all have to row.’ It’s a standout song and one that will no doubt endure in the years to come. If the end of days is indeed upon us with the weakened condition that the world has fallen into, then songs like Brand New Start and Best Is Yet To Come point to a faith in our beliefs and our spirituality to find fresh optimism in a future that dwells beyond our mortal forms.\n\nThe final song Yesterday’s Rain resolves to leave the listener with a message of hope and the will to endure through all the hard times, as the writer encounters a wise old patron in a local bar ‘The cold wind will blow all the sleet and the snow, The dark clouds of anguish will bring each one pain, With a wink of his eye he raised his glass high, This fine glass of whiskey was yesterday’s rain.’\n\nThere is much to admire on this fine album and it is a testament to both endurance and individuality. For this band of brothers to be creating music that remains stimulating, vibrant and very Zen, is not only rewarding, but also inspiring. You should add this album to your collection with all haste.\n\nNick Taylor Not Alone Self Release\n\nAustin, Texas is home to this singer songwriter and this is his debut album. Taylor has been bracketed as an Americana artist but in truth there is as much Country influence in the ten tracks that are featured here. He went to Nashville to record the album and used some of the best session musicians available, so this certainly colours the sound and the final results.\n\nTaylor wrote all the songs and he plays acoustic guitar in addition to taking all lead vocals. His voice has a deep resonance and the powerful delivery expresses a quiet confidence in what he is doing. The studio musicians really step up to the plate and the arrangements on all songs are very impressive with the understated ensemble playing prominent in the mix.\n\nStandout tracks like Songs About the Glory and Broken Souls display a great maturity and look at different aspects in relationships, both good and bad. There are story songs and Getting Along spins out a tale of two loners who meet on a desert highway. Love comes in different forms and who can say what works out best in the end. Another song, Kentucky Girl drifts along on a sweet melody of piano and guitar looking at desire and the need to be loved.\n\nOn the other hand, Futures Past looks at the loss of a relationship and memories of a Summer spent in hedonistic pleasure. 3AM On the Interstate also looks to challenges in a relationship and concerns of slipping back into a life that is best left back in the past. The fiddle and mandolin on Dead Land Future are very atmospheric on a song that deals with the pain of trying to start over ‘ I blew both my shoulders at the age of 23, Working towards another man’s dream.’\n\nHeart On the Run is traditional country with organ and guitar riding the beat while the song reflects ‘I got a 20-year history of feeling like a fool.’ Don’t let life pass you by is the abiding message and on Carry You Home the sentiment is one of care for one another and comforting the lost. Dogs has a rock groove and looks at making changes as inner resolve pushes you towards better days.\n\nThe musicians that play on the album are David Flint (various guitars, mandolin), Wayne Killius (drums), Dave Francis (bass), Chris Nole (piano, keyboards), Deanie Richardson (fiddle), Pat McGrath (acoustic guitar), James Paul Mitchell (pedal steel, dobro), and Billy Thomas (backing vocals). The entire project proves to be well worth the investment made by Nick Taylor in shaping these songs in such an impressive fashion. His instincts pays dividends throughout a strong debut album.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nThe Makers Out Bloodlines/Hope Self Release\n\nThis musical project is the brainchild of founder Scott Bell. He is based in Tulsa, Oklahoma and is known as a music producer, composer, and photographer. He has written scores for modern dance, played in the band Buffaloswans and toured with Julianna Barwick and Sigur Rós, among others. This debut album was produced by Bell and he also wrote all eleven songs that play out over a listening time of one hour.\n\nThe official website states that the album represents ‘a culmination of many years of evolution birthed from ancestral struggles, victories, unspoken words, forgiveness, and reconstruction.’ Although this sounds like a statement of disproportionate aggrandizement, Bell also is quoted as saying “I feel like my music is spiritual in nature, I do not write songs regularly, but wait for them to write themselves through me.”\n\nThe music is a potent mix of roots, country, folk and 70s psychedelic rock, all presented in heady soundscapes and style. The swirling synth sounds of opener Holy Water lay out a message of peace and community and lead into Golden Driller which explores the hope that is held out for a relationship to unfold and bring joy. Throughout, a sense of peace permeates everything with drifting pedal steel (Roger Ray) and harmony vocals building a great atmospheric backdrop to the synth (Chris Combs, Scott Bell) and guitar melodies.\n\nThe big production sound and keyboard swell on Hallelujah breaks down to simple piano on the outro and seamlessly segues into Lhasa and a sweep of gentle melody and mood. The lack of a lyric sheet is disappointing as the words are hard to make out but the swathes of instrumentation bear a clear message of spiritual awakening. The heavenly vocals on Stillborn, courtesy of Libby Decamp, are particularly attractive and on the credits the singers are listed as Sarah Maud, Liz Coffman, Jillian Rutherford and Jesse Aycock. Bell plays guitar, organ, piano, drums and sings, while also using studio musicians on woodwinds, trombone, trumpet, cello and violin to swell the lush sound on specific tracks.\n\nPsychic Geography is very memorable with a nice rhythmic beat before drifting into ethereal directions with vocal echo and instrument reverb as it meanders back towards the original groove. It’s one of the longest tracks at eight minutes plus and it is followed by Blood a melancholic instrumental piece with marimba and violin mixed into the guitar treatments and synth sounds. The title track follows and images of big skies and endless horizons come into view, framed by mountains and a sense of the land speaking on the gentle breeze.\n\nReligion is a song that looks at dogma and the human habit of ignoring the obvious. It’s a soulful sound that has nice harmony vocals and piano before it takes off into the heavens on layers of guitars and keyboards. The final track is the longest, clocking in at almost nine minutes, and Five Hundred Million Pounds Of Memory is anti-war and a message of loving awareness with acknowledgement to those who sacrificed in the name of freedom. This is a huge project with many interesting roads to walk down. Overall it is a panorama of what was once referred to as the Hippie dream, a way to come together and spread messages of love and peace. Certainly worthy of investigation.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nWill Kimbrough For the Life Of Me Self Release\n\nThis American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer grew up in Mobile, Alabama. It is no exaggeration to say that he has influenced the contemporary country and folk scene as much as any of his peers over the last few decades. His output is peerless in terms of the amount of music he has created, collaborated on, or assisted in its development. This album is his eight solo project and the eleven tracks are superbly crafted, as you would expect.\n\nIt has a raw energy and a stripped back sound with Kimbrough providing vocals, guitars, and keyboards, with Chris Donohue on bass and Bryan Owings on drums and percussion. The atmospheric Southern Wind is a highlight, with the brooding slow melody and tasty guitar dynamics mixing with the lyrics that carry a sense of foreboding.\n\nThe jangling guitar on The Other Side reflects a Tom Petty sound and the laid-back groove on I Don’t Want To Start A War takes a look back at the idealism of the 60s peace movements and the lost message of peace and love in the present political divide and corporate complexities. River Of Roses is a song that tackles past crimes against the civil rights movements who fought bravely for equality and freedom, with reference made to the beatings suffered by leader John Lewis at Selma, Alabama in 1965.\n\nClotilda’s On Fire also stands out with the musicians kicking up quite a storm in memory of the last known U.S. slave ship to bring captives from Africa to the United States, in 1859. The song suggests that we are still living with the ghosts of those evil times and it’s certainly something that still divides class and communities in modern society. The title track is a gentle acoustic ballad that bemoans the differences between those who profess to seek communication, especially in personal relationships.\n\nEvery Day seems to be an aspiration for a happier world and the sing-along chorus belies the sense of separation that permeates other songs on the album. Are things really getting better? The jury is out… Final track When This Is All Over has a nice rockabilly swing with harmonica and guitar parts lifting the message of forgiveness and moving forward. This album is certainly a highlight in an illustrious career and Will Kimbrough can be more than pleased with the results.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nLeaf Rapids Velvet Paintings Self Release\n\nThis band is from Winnipeg, Canada and this is their third album release, and a follow-up from the superb Citizen Alien that appeared back in 2019. The band have a lovely laid-back sound that fits perfectly into a roots-americana lane on the endless highway of music genres, and their sweetly structured songs come highly recommended. The band is comprised of Keri Latimer (songwriter, acoustic guitar, lead vocals, theremin), Devin Latimer (bass guitar), Joanna Miller (drums, supporting vocals, whistling), and Chris Dunn (electric guitar).\n\nThe opening song, and title track, has a real personal manifesto, with the words ‘When I get my shit together, I’ll be a force to reckon with, Possessor of self-discipline, Not dreaming the day away.’ Songwriter Keri Latimer taking back control of her life amid the reality of increasing corporate greed in the world and the sense of feeling overwhelmed in the face of all today’s negative media ‘Don’t be so melodramatic, It’s just a semi-automatic, Anyone can get one down the street.’ A healthy sense of irony is indeed required!\n\nStarling To A Starling is a love song that has a melody similar to the iconic Chris Issak track Wicked Game but with sweet pedal steel and guitar lines tickling the senses. Fast Romantics is a very giddy love song served on instant desire and pleasure with a seductive delivery to highlight the playfulness in the lyrics ‘Found a fast romantic, In a Dollarama Isle, Rows of shiny plastic, And your Dalai Lama smile,’ all modern kitsch on demand and a superb guitar break courtesy of Chris Dunn.\n\nSilver Fillings is a real highlight and shows the sophisticated and subtle lyrical qualities of Keri Latimer. Questions concerning the durability of love itself and also, quite a coup to conjure up a song around dental work and abstract thoughts ‘My silver fillings are sometimes receivers, First time it happened I thought it was Jesus, Funny the things that can lead to salvation, Holes in my teeth and a radio station.’ Bravo!\n\nNight Shift uses the whistling skills of Joanna Miller to such great effect that the sound is exactly like a theremin, superbly echoing the sense of isolation in coming off work in the twilight hours and entering into the new day ‘My quiet industry, In the hours that memories keep, The fox and owl agree, The darkest hours are not for sleep, Here on the night shift, We tuck the days in one by one’ - oh so eloquent and evocative…\n\nParamjit’s Sonnet is such an enduring love song that captures the essence of true, unequivocal devotion to another in the purest way, strings elevating the melody and Keri giving such a beautiful vocal performance of emotion from the heart. Selfless love in all true colours. As a contrast, In the Woods captures that sense of peace coupled with a certain awareness of otherness when we walk along in nature ‘There are stories in the trees, Every ring a memory, It’s like they’re trying to find the words, Something’s stirring in the woods, If we only understood.’\n\nTrepidatious Celebrations is an interesting inclusion and seems to channel a moment in time where a birthday gift is shared between lovers under curfew conditions in perhaps Covid lockdown or during wartime? The final song Insomniac Show captures the heady days of youth and two students sharing fun and Beaujolais wine late into the night ‘We were insubordinate humanitarians, With revolutionary plans to stick it to the man, Now I’m selling real estate and knock-off Melvin Kleins, Did you once say you loved me out beside the BFI?’ The reference to a waste management plant (BFI) is telling, the insight and perspective razor sharp, as a mirror into our collective psyche that often ends up settling for some form of compromise in adult years.\n\nSpecial guests include Geoff Hilhorst (Rhodes and Hammond A-100), Bill Western (pedal steel), Natanielle Felicitas (cello), and John Paul Peters (violin). Production is by John Paul Peters and Keri Latimer and the recording took place at Private Ear Recording in Winnipeg,. All songs are written by Keri Latimer except Night Shift written by Joanna Miller, and Paramjit's Sonnet a co-write with Paramjit Singh.\n\nThe playing and the live feel is so perfectly captured and the players elevate the songs as a collective in their interplay. Let’s call the whole experience one of Canadicana; a specific genre that bottles the songcraft of truly gifted artists and ideas embedded in their culture. The nine songs included run for an immersive thirty-six minutes, leaving you just wanting more. Then again, one can always hit the repeat option to indulge yourself all over again. As roots music goes this is one of the strongest albums of the year.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nAlice Wallace, Cyrena Wages, Kiely Connell, Jason McNiff Nick Taylor Music, The Makers Out, WILL KIMBROUGH Leaf Rapids\n\nAnnie Bacon and her Oshen Storm Self Release\n\nAn entire album that is based around the issues of grief and loss may seem like a daunting task for the listener. Could it turn out to be an exercise weighed down by onerous self-reflection? Happily this is not the case and this project wraps the songs in a blanket of compassion and empathy. It takes a real gamble to place your raw emotions on such public display and yet, by making the deeply personal into something that embraces the universal, Annie Bacon delivers a healing in the power of her music.\n\nHaving suffered a series of losses in recent years, Bacon reflects upon the various stages of grief and channels the realisation that it can take on various guises. Divorce is one form of real loss, and in dealing with this, the death of your ex-Mother in law brings additional challenges to the emotions. When you are also hit with the sad reality of having to say goodbye to your best friend, the pain is palpable. Bacon also lost her father, who passed away before the Covid virus closed the world down and the end result of all this death has been a period of self-analysis and pouring all manner of confused disbelief into the songs that appear on this new album.\n\nThe ability to cope and indeed endure is also at the heart of these fourteen songs, The conclusion drawn is that sitting back in the moment and acknowledging these feelings as they arise, and staying grounded until they pass, is the real key, and a code by which you can chart the unfolding of the rest of your life.\n\nThe loss of relationships, and the grief that death unlocks, all culminate in heartbreak and a deep sense of also losing a vital part of who you are as a person. These songs cover the full range of such loss and uncover real emotions along the road to ultimate healing. Secret Broken Heart looks at the cost of hiding pain inside and putting on a brave face to the world. Mist is a song that sees the reality of losing yourself to grief and the remedy to solve matters by coming into the moment and sitting still with the pain. California Heat is written in memory of her best friend who died, and the image of a hiking trail and the isolation of being alone in nature brings a coping mechanism.\n\nWalk A Little Farther covers similar territory with the resolve to keep going and not submit to crippling inaction under the weight of loss. Alone With Grief is probably the defining song in this woodland of sadness with the words ‘ No one can walk your path for you, But so many have and so many do, Feel alone with grief tonight.’\n\nRealising a relationship is over and having the courage to leave normality and routine behind is at the heart of songs Can’t Remember, When Will I Learn and Love Can Mean, with the latter song capturing the essence ‘But if you’re twisting yourself into knots just to stay, And you’re screaming to be heard but ignored anyway, And the illusion of peace is not a price you can pay, Remember that love can mean walking away, You can love yourself enough not to stay, That’s okay.’ Wise words that show a resolve to develop a perspective on the slings and arrows that life throws your way.\n\nThe final song is Worry and has a message that the problem can indeed be worry itself. By letting it go you can open up a new vista that leads to happiness - ‘Or maybe worry is the trouble, Maybe I should worry a little less.’ The excellent band is worthy of the highest praise for the way in which they wrap these songs with a protective cocoon of care and creativity.\n\nThe musicians are Annie Bacon (guitar, vocals), Paul Defiglia (bass, keyboards, synthesiser, organ, drum machine), Thomas Bryan Eaton(guitars, pedal steel, mandolin), and Anson Hohne (drums, percussion) make up this band and the album was produced by Annie Bacon & Paul Defiglia in Natural Daylight Studios, Nashville. All songs are written by Annie, with one co-write.\n\nAnne Bacon is an Ann Arbor resident and a singer-songwriter and guitarist of real depth and quality who took her fledgling steps in the industry with the release of a debut album in 2012. She built upon this when a further album appeared in 2019. I may be wrong about Annie’s performing name but I think that OSHEN is a variation of Ocean, it’s power and vastness capturing our sense of place, surrounded by all this tranquillity and mystery. A really fine album and worthy of your exploration.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nThe New Leaves A Sketch Of Home Corn Crake\n\nThere is a gentle contemporary Folk sound in the music of Irish quartet The New Leaves. Based in the seaside town of Warrenpoint, a small port town in Co. Down, the members are Declan McKay (guitar, vocals), Cian O’Hare (guitar, mandolin), Patrice McKevitt (bass) and Paddy Goodfellow (drums, percussion). Together they make a very soothing sound with a collective approach in their song arrangements of ‘less-is-more.’ They are childhood friends and the band was formed in 2022.\n\nMother Nature features quite a lot in the lyrics of Declan McKay who writes all the songs and his affection with the locale comes through on songs such as Donaghaguy Reservoir, In the Shadow Of the Mournes and The Lights From Omeath, a small village on the Cooley Peninsula. The ensemble playing is very engaging and the harmony vocals of Patrice McKevitt are particularly bright in the production mix. The sense of separation and space brought to the album recording by Steve Fearnley is impressive and the project was recorded at Narrow Water Studios in Warrenpoint.\n\nThe inclusion of cello on the album is an inspired choice and the lyrical playing of Ben Triggs elevates the songs throughout, Maggie’s Island being a particular highlight. The sense of easy reverie threads these songs into a tapestry that is very appealing and tracks A Silk Road To the Moon and Rocky Mountain River include some subtle guitar work from Cian O’Hare, who also contributes harmony vocals. The drumming of Paddy Goodfellow is nicely judged and he never overplays, expertly supporting the song arrangements as evidenced on the very pleasant Away With the Fairies. Across these thirteen songs there is a real sense of joy, and the sentiment on A Giant Murphy Favour is one of standing tall for each other and facing the challenges with an open agenda.\n\nAll in all, a very accomplished debut album and I look forward to hearing more from this talented group on their developing musical journey.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nGerry Spehar and Friends Other Voices Self Released\n\nThis album is a compilation of songs that were written by Gerry Spehar and performed by a number of artist friends who recorded his work over a period that spans four decades. The album title is very appropriate in that, across the twenty tracks, the consistently strong writing is given a chance to see the light of day through the interpretations of others, and we can celebrate the talent of this Colorado songwriter who has been creating music since his teenage years.\n\nHe initially cut his musical teeth by playing in a 1970s band with his brothers George and Tom. After a period of going solo he hooked up with long-time associate Bobby Allison and together they had increasing success during the 1980s. Gerry then stepped back from the music business to work a day job and raise a family but he never stopped writing and his guitar was always on hand to partake in any sessions that were going down. After a break of 30 years he returned to the recording studio in 2017 and he has released four albums over recent years, making up for lost time.\n\nThere is a stellar cast of musicians that appeared on these recordings over the years, and far too many to list. All songs were written by Spehar, including nine co-writes, four with Mike Becker and five with Bobby Allison. Two of the songs appeared on a previous album DELTA MAN (2022), with the inclusion of Train, Train, Train and Rockin’ On A Country Dancefloor. In fact, the latter song appears on each of these two discs with different versions provided by Teresa James and Gary F. Floyd. Both tracks are highlights on a very strong compilation that includes contributions from Dale Watson, Lisa McKenzie and Lisa Daye.\n\nThere is plenty to appeal across the different styles that range from traditional country to soulful ballads, taking in blues and rockabilly sounds also. The slow burn of What He Said and Georgetown are complimented by the sweet melody of Angel, Grandpa’s Daisies and The Last Person; balanced against the up-tempo Lovin’ Proof, Do Whatcha Used To Do and Joanne. There are also love songs and Both Ends Of the Rainbow and The Longer I Love You are excellent examples of this songwriter’s craft. A very rewarding album and one that I’m sure will bring plenty of pleasure to those who like well-crafted songs.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nKrista Detor Chaos, Collisions and Clocks Tightrope\n\nWhile this ‘best of’ collection dates back to 2019 it is a timely reminder of the deep well of talent that dwells within the creative muse of Krista Detor, a singer-songwriter based in Bloomington, Indiana. Over the course of her career Krista has delivered eight recordings that highlight her songs and playing skills in a manner that leaves an enduring trail for those who wish to follow the yellow brick road that leads to her door. This collection was produced by Krista and her husband Dave Weber at their Airtime recording studio which is based on their farmland and attracts many musicians who avail of the professional and extensive facilities on offer.\n\nKrista has a very expressive voice that is arresting in it’s sweetly delivered tone, both wistful and knowing; yet forgiving and universal in capturing the ache and yearning contained within the dichotomy of living. Krista speaks of the spectre of depression that visits many of us at certain points in our lives and in having the bravery to investigate the source and tackle it head on. Where does that sense of sadness come from? Is it perhaps self-doubt at a young age that turns towards unwarranted inner reflection? Could it be caused by a distorted vision of oneself?\n\nThis collection contains only one song from her great breakthrough album MUDSHOW (2006,) which brought her overnight media attention and praise. Indeed, the follow up album COVER THEIR EYES (2007) only merits two songs here, and it is the twin releases of CHOCOLATE PAPER SUITES (2010) and BARLEY (2016) that feature mostly, each contributing four tracks.\n\nGiven the wealth of choice across the span of her career, Krista has chosen her personal favourites and this album is full of truly great moments. The haunting Deliver Me and the personal reflection of self-liberation on Hear That are just two stand-out moments among many. Also included is the excellent More Than I Can Say and the delights of Clock Of the World, For All I Know and Icarus. There are three bonus songs also included and these unrecorded tracks show that Krista continues to write music of great insight and beauty. Plenty for everyone to enjoy and if you have yet to become aware of this superb artist and her many talents, then this album is a fine place to start. File under ‘buried treasure.’\n\nIn recent times she launched The Hundredth Hill Artist Residence and Retreat in Bloomington and much of her energy has been focused on making this enterprise a success, with its rolling green woodlands and creative spaces that attract artists and leaders from across genres, disciplines, and borders to find inspiration and focus.\n\nKrista also delivered a TEDx talk in 2022 that focused upon ‘Shattering the Looking Glass Self’ and an insight into the career arc of this very entrepreneurial talent. It is well worth finding on your social media and it will certainly inspire.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nDavid Starr Better Me / Starr and Stucky Self-Titled Cedaredge\n\nTwo releases from the talented David Starr over the last 12 months and both are examples of the fine qualities this songwriter possesses. Better Me is a six track EP that runs for twenty-plus minutes and includes the talents of Matt Bubel (drums, percussion), Jimmy Mattingly (fiddle), Dan Dugmore (steel, electric guitar), John Reno Prentice (electric guitar), Irene Kelley (background vocals), Michelle Prentice (background vocals), Mark Prentice (bass, keyboards), with acoustic and electric guitars played by Starr. The songs are all written by David Starr and the delivery is a roots rock sound with the musicians very much front and centre in the groove.\n\nTitle track Better Me is a hope for inner growth gained from ongoing maturity, while the softer Some Angels Fly shows another side to the ensemble playing, and a tune that reflects upon a friend who has passed away. The rock beat of Poison the Water brings a great dynamic with the guitar riff driving a song about corporate thirst for power and the soulful vocals are particularly impressive. Because You’re Right is a love song that plays along on a gentle melody and harmony vocals that reflect upon a doomed relationship. Closer To You is another roots rock arrangement that allows the musicians space to express their individual skills.\n\nThe closing track Any Chance Of Going Home is a song about circumstance and fate where the timing in a relationship is always out of step. There are some lovely fiddle and piano parts and a lyric that reflects ‘Sometimes circumstance lays waste to best laid plans and it’s years until we find out what it means.’ Starr sings in a very clear vocal with a nice tone and this adds character to the song arrangements. The music was recorded in Nashville, at Addiction Sound Studios, and was produced by Starr and Mark Prentice.\n\nThe second release Starr and Stucky is an acoustic album with friend and mandolin player Erik Stucky. The record is comprised of reworked acoustic versions of original setlist favourites and the nine songs come from five different albums in Starr’s discography with three tracks featured from THE HEAD AND THE HEART(2017) and SOUTH AND WEST (2018). The production and the playing is very impressive and full of nice moments with guitar and mandolin stretching out in stellar fashion throughout. Good As Gone comes bursting out of the traps before the slower Waiting In the Dark brings a more reflective tone. Other songs like Don’t Give Me Hope, Night Rolls Around and Edge Of the World continue the laid-back feel and the considered interplay between Starr and Stucky is beautifully realised.\n\nHead and Heart is a great example of the understated melody that both players dance around with the reflective lyric echoing the sparce arrangement and simple song craft. Cabo San Lucas is a cover of a Toby Keith song and is delivered in a Tejano fashion with mandolin lifting the song to new heights. Another fine album from this Colorado-based musician who delivers on a regular basis with soul infused vocals and a fine writing sensitivity.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nJoana Serrat Big Wave Great Canyon\n\n\"This is the foundation of who I am now. It's the best album of my career so far, and I don't think I'll ever be able to put out an album like it again,\" declares Joana Serrat on her latest and most soul-searching album.\n\nPacked with emotions that range from anger to exhilaration, sonically, the album is a significant departure from the Catalan singer-songwriter's previous work, fuelled by a period of personal transition, the loss of both her grandparents, the demise of a long-term relationship and the onset of another one. That's not to say she hasn't previously been afraid to move outside her comfort zone. Her 2017 album DRIPPING SPRINGS was an ethereal psychedelic affair produced by Israel Nash and recorded, with the aid of his backing band, at Nash's Plum Creek Studios in Texas.\n\nFor Big Wave, Serrat collaborated with producer Matt Pence and recorded at The Echo Lab Studio in Texas. The characteristic reverb, a sonic signature of Serrat's previous work, is more pronounced, drawing comparisons to P.J. Harvey and Liz Phair. The guitar work of Joey McClellan, a longtime collaborator, is central to the album's sound, with McClellan also credited as co-producer.\n\nWith her foot firmly on the cosmic pedal, opener The Cord, Big Lagoons, and Sufferer find her pushing out the boundaries and exploring previously unvisited sonic territory. She returns to more familiar ground with This House and Freewheel, and the album's underlying themes of lost love and grief are pronounced in You're With Me Wherever I Go and Broken Hearted.\n\nPrepare to be transported to a different place from that expected with BIG WAVE. It may take a few visits to settle into, but the time invested is well rewarded.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nElaine Palmer Half Moon Rising Butterfly Effect\n\nI don’t recall encountering this singer/songwriter before, but on this encounter she is someone worth investigating. She was born in England in the North Yorkshire Moors, but travelled to the US often to Arizona. She was interested in music for a long time and use the two countries as inspiration for her material. There are folk, country and Americana influences from a place where the roots of those were largely intertwined. She spent time teaching songwriting and signed a publishing deal for her own work and has recorded a number of prior releases while continuing to tour.\n\nIn 2023, Palmer went to California to work with producer Mike Butler in a week long session, recording the album in mostly live sessions, something that, when you have the right musicians involved, can offer positive results capturing the live essence of a group of players. They were those who Butler worked with previously in San Diego, including Dave Berzansky’s pedal steel, Theron Wall and Bobby Furgo’s strings and Butler’s own guitar work - all of which immediately became cornerstones of the album. They are given a good foundation by the often understated rhythm section of Matt Lynott and Patrick McClory. However, from the opening bars of the first song, it is the clarity and strength of Palmer’s vocal that give the album its identity and personality.\n\nThere are eight songs on the album that are observations on the varied conditions of love and a consciousness of landscape, a similar working pattern to many of those working in the Americana scene who draw from a comparable set of stimuli. It is, doubtless, the result of homing her melodic and lyrical skills that may have produced her best release to date.\n\nThe album opens with Heart And Soul, which sees her welcome an old flame who she sees is still “all fire and fool / how the years have changed you … I just wanted to feel your heart.” She wishes for love that is real and unquestioning in A Love Like That, yet seems tinged with a sadness to notice “my dreams have been and passed / through the eyes of my child I live now.” This sense of melancholy carries on with So Long, realising that “if there are many fractures / then we may never go back into one piece.” This is a ballad with plugged violin and strings to enhance that mood. One song would seem to be returned to, judging by the title, Let Me Fall (revisited) wherein she knows that she “can’t catch myself in here / so let me fall into you.”\n\nSomewhat more affiliated with place but not without emotion is Freebrough Hill. It has a more impassioned vocal that has a distinctive crack, making it appear more fraught as the song builds, with the guitar mirroring the sentiment with deftness and effectiveness. The lyric may reveal something of the substance and source of its hard message with “judged only by a man of cloth / who has never had to endure / the things that I have.” Not Lost has an electric folk feel that will appeal to many who have missed that blend of storytelling and powerful guitar. It accepts that though broken she is not lost - again the steel guitar is paramount to the frame of mind that is expressed. On The Way Up hopes to meet in happier times with the thought that may be relevant to many who would echo the feeling, often expressed, that “youth is wasted on the young / wisdom lies with the old.” This the offered from someone with life experience to draw that thought from. Another stripped back arrangement is used for The Last Dance, the violin used to portray Palmer’s belief that she was mad from fire and rain so that she can leave rainbows. A pretty good sentiment to end the album on.\n\nWhen taking account of the lyrics, in their written form, you might assume that this is a somewhat sombre album. But Palmer, like many artists who look into the darkness, can see a light and help others to see it too. It is a short eight track album but nothing is lost in its brevity, indeed the short space of time in which it was recorded added an energy that makes the album vibrant. Palmer’s moon, it would seem, is on the rise.\n\nStephen"
