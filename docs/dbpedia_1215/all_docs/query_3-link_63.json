        "text": "Post by Hennessy Macklemore III on\n\nWhat are some examples of highly esteemed bands/artists that you like that have large discographies, but a surprising amount of lame/underwhelming albums contributing to that? For instance, they may have a select number of amazing albums that people normally think of when it comes to that artist, but if you listen to their discography in bulk you may be disappointed to find that they really lost their touch after a certain point.\n\nA few examples for me:\n\nQueensrÿche - their first three albums definitely speak for themselves in terms of why they were such a big deal in the '80s, and Empire and Promised Land both are pretty good, though I was surprised to already hear Geoff Tate's voice starting to deteriorate that early. After that though, so much of their discography from 1997-2011 ranged from \"meh\" to straight up bad, between the songwriting REALLY falling off and Tate's voice continuing to deteriorate. And it's not like they were particularly inactive during that period either - they put out seven albums during that span, and the only ones I remember being somewhat decent were Operation: Mindcrime II and maybe Tribe. I really don't think they bounced back until Todd La Torre joined and they put out their self-titled in 2013, and thankfully they've been pretty solid again and ever since. But hoo boy, I was really not expecting that much of their discography to be that skippable.\n\nDef Leppard - I would definitely strongly recommend their first four albums, but after that it becomes pretty hit or miss. The only album from after that that I think can really hold up with those first few is 1993's Retro Active, which is technically more of a compilation than an actual studio album, as it contains various B-sides and unreleased tracks from over the years of 1984-1993. Slang is actually a pretty interestingly experimental album as well, but a lot of their stuff after that is just straight up bland pop rock with none of the edge or riffs of their early stuff (the guiltiest offenders of this being Euphoria and X). Yeah! was a pretty decent covers album, and Songs from the Sparkle Lounge and the self-titled have had *some* decent tracks on them, but overall they've only really had select moments here and there that have successfully recaptured the greatness of their 80s albums.\n\nThe Rolling Stones - Admittedly I haven't actually listened to their entire discography from top to bottom (because that's a LOT of albums), but I've heard enough to have to have the general impression that theirs is one that's very spotty overall. They definitely have some great songs that deserve to be hailed as classics, but honestly the number of albums I've heard by them that I can actually say are really great from beginning to end is very low in comparison to the number of albums they have out in total. Lots of very filler tracks throughout the majority of their discography, and honestly some of their albums are just straight up bad. Though I would also say that they're more of a songs band than an albums band in general, so in that sense their output doesn't really hold up the best from this perspective in my opinion.\n\nPost by Hennessy Macklemore III on\n\nMetallica hasn't put out a good album in 30 years, yet every time they release something they're hailed as gods because of the stuff they did that most people never listened to.\n\nMan honestly I can't name a single metallica album I'd sit and listen the whole way through. I don't think they've ever had an especially strong outing tbh most of their albums have 3-4 good tracks and then just filler shit. Like yeah ajfa is good n all but who likes even have the songs off that album?\n\nI do? ...And Justice for All is an amazing album in my book, and I'd say the same for most of their first five albums. I don't think they even dropped off that hard after the Black Album either - Load was still quite a good album in my opinion, ReLoad was alright, Garage Inc. was a solid covers album, and Death Magnetic had some decent tracks if you can get past the shitty production. Metallica have had their weak points in their discography no doubt, but I personally wouldn't characterize them as a band that has more bad albums than good.\n\nI'd also like to make it clear that this isn't a thread for talking about bands you think are overrated - it's for talking about bands you actually like, that just happen to have more weak albums to their name than you'd expect.\n\nTo contribute to the post, and to the overall discussion of thrash. Megadeth has never had a very consistent album lineup its full of weak links though I'll always love them and Metallica.\n\nI can't really get on board with this one either. I know a lot of Megadeth fans like to hate on Risk (though I personally quite like that album), and the Chris Broderick era albums are generally considered kinda forgettable (especially Super Collider), but there's still a lot of great stuff to counterbalance that. I would go as far as to say that they don't have any actual bad albums in my opinion; just a few more forgettable/underwhelming ones.\n\nPink Floyd are probably my favourite band of all-time. But there are quite a few albums in their discog that don't hold up all that well imo. Or I at least don't feel compelled to listen to them very often.\n\n4 of their first 7 albums were pretty laden with filler. \"More\", \"Ummagumma\", \"Atom Heart Mother\" and \"Obscured by Clouds\" are limited to just a few good moments. I don't mind 80s and onwards Floyd as much as some fans, but I would agree with the popular opinion that \"The Final Cut\" would have worked better as a Roger Waters solo release.\n\nI would agree that most of those early albums are weaker than their later output, but I still like some of them for what they are. Their early psychedelic sound was definitely its own unique thing, and their discography is one of my favorites to study in chronological order to see just how the evolution of their sound happened along the way. So I would say those albums still have their place, even if they're not as much of standouts as the band's classic era stuff.\n\nI do agree that The Final Cut would've made more sense as a Roger Waters solo release though, even if it's very good album otherwise.\n\nDeep Purple is another name that comes to mind as having an inconsistent discography. I like a good chunk of their 70s material (except Who Do We Think We Are), but afterwards its been hit-or-miss. Perfect Strangers is an excellent reunion album, but it's follow up The House of Blue Light is forgettable and boring. Unpopular opinion, I also liked Slaves and Masters with Joe Lynn Turner on vocals, but the next record The Battle Rages On has like maybe 3 good songs on it. Perpendicular is also a pretty good album, but I don't care too much for the next several records that came afterwards.\n\nThis one, however, I do agree with! I love Deep Purple's '70s albums, and they were truly a force to be reckoned with back then. However, you're right that their post-reunion albums since 1984 have been pretty spotty. I think the first few were alright (Perfect Strangers was a solid comeback, I don't mind The House of Blue Light, need to relisten to Slaves & Masters to properly reevaluate that one, but I actually quite like some of the tracks off The Battle Rages On). However, since Ritchie Blackmore left the band, I have to admit their songwriting really started to decline. Steve Morse is actually one of my top guitar players of all time, and there are some songs of his with the band that I really adore (particularly certain ones off Purpendicular), but overall his era of Deep Purple just hasn't felt as inspired as the rest, or like it's lacking in the kind of identity that Blackmore era stuff really had in spades. I think a lot of that may also have to do with how badly Ian Gillan's voice started to decline in the '90s, cause let's be real - his tone has been majorly lacking for quite a while now. The last few Deep Purple albums in particular were honestly kinda sad to listen to...\n\nPost by Rodney Blazershorts on\n\nMan honestly I can't name a single metallica album I'd sit and listen the whole way through.

We had our discussion about Load/ReLoad already, but I couldn't go as far as calling either one an overall remarkable record, and the ones since then have been not-good. S&M is incredible, for what that/s worth. As for Megadeth, they had a much stronger discography, really having good records up until Risk, and great ones up to and including Youthanasia, plus The System Has Failed which is actually a personal favorite of mine. Nothing past that has even piqued my interest."
