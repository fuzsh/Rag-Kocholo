        "text": "For: Admins and Editors\n\nUse Spotify for Artists to pitch an upcoming, unreleased song to our playlist editors.\n\nWe'll also add your pitched song to your followers' Release Radar playlists, and you can pin it to your This Is playlist if you're eligible for one.\n\nLog in to Spotify for Artists.\n\nFind unreleased music to pitch:\n\nAt the top of Home, select PITCH FROM NEXT RELEASE.\n\nOn web, you can also pitch from the Music tab under Upcoming.\n\nChoose a song and fill out the info. The more info we get, the better chance it has.\n\nTip: Need access to Spotify for Artists? Learn how to get access\n\nInfo about pitching music:\n\nDeliver your music to us at least 7 days before its release date so our editors have time to listen\n\nYou can’t pitch compilations or songs you’re a featured artist on\n\nYou can only pitch one song at a time. Once your pitched song goes live, you can pitch another\n\nAnyone with Admin or Editor access can see and edit the pitch\n\nYou can edit your pitch up to release day, but there’s no guarantee our editors will see the changes\n\nOnce a song has gone live, it’s no longer eligible for pitching\n\nPinning a pitched song to your This Is playlist:\n\nYou can pin the song that you pitched to your This Is playlist if you’re eligible for one\n\nOnce your new song is available to listeners on Spotify, pinning takes around 3 days\n\nYou can only submit one pin request at a time. Once your pinned song goes live, you can submit another request\n\nSongs are pinned to your This Is playlist for up to 28 days post-release in the order they were requested, with the earliest pinned song appearing first\n\nHow to know if your song gets picked\n\nWe’ll email you if your song gets picked. You can also check the Playlists tab in Spotify for Artists when your release goes live and explore detailed stats about it. Our editors might pick a different song for their playlists to the one you pitched.\n\nPitching doesn’t guarantee playlist placement. If your song doesn’t get picked, it may still get discovered later. Stay on our editors’ radar by building your fanbase and engaging with your audience on Spotify and beyond.\n\nHowever, submitting a pitch at least 7 days before release day will get your song on your followers’ Release Radar playlists. You can also pin your song to your This Is playlist if you're eligible for one.\n\nLabel-only pitches\n\nLicensors and labels can make a pitch label-only.\n\nArtists and managers can see the song and who pitched it, but can’t edit or view some pitch details (e.g. genre, mood, and culture tags).\n\nYou can reach out to your licensor or label if you need help with a label-only pitch."
