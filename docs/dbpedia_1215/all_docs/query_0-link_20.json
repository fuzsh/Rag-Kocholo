        "text": "While in a studio, Andrew Watt bounces off the walls. Just ask Mick Jagger, who once had to gently tell the 33-year-old, \"Look, I can deal with this, but when you meet Ronnie and Keith, you have to dial it down a little bit.\"\n\nOr ask Pearl Jam's Stone Gossard. \"He really got the best out of [drummer] Matt [Cameron] just by being excited — literally jumping up and down and pumping his fist and running around,\" he tells GRAMMY.com.\n\nAs Watt's hot streak has burned on, reams have rightly been written about his ability to take a legacy act, reconnect them with their essence, and put a battery in their back. His efficacy can be seen at Music's Biggest Night: Ozzy Osbourne's Patient Number 9 won Best Rock Album at the 2023 GRAMMYs. At the last ceremony, the Rolling Stones were nominated for Best Rock Song, for Hackney Diamonds' opener \"Angry.\"\n\nOn Pearl Jam's return to form, Dark Matter, due out April 19. Who was behind the desk? Take a wild guess.\n\n\"You want to see them live more than you want to listen to their albums, and they have the ability to look at each other and play and follow each other. I don't like my rock music any other way, as a listener,\" Watt tells GRAMMY.com. \"All my favorite records are made like that — of people speeding up, slowing down, playing longer than they should.\"\n\nAs such, Watt had a lightbulb moment: to not record any demos, and have them write together in the room. \"They're all playing different stuff, and it makes up what Pearl Jam is, and singer Eddie [Vedder] rides it like a wave.\"\n\nIf you're more of a pop listener, there's tons of Watt for you — he's worked with Justin Bieber (\"Hit the Ground\" from Purpose), Lana Del Rey (\"Doin' Time\" from Norman F—ing Rockwell) and much more. Read on for a breakdown of big name rockers who have worked with Andrew Watt.\n\nPearl Jam / Eddie Vedder\n\nWatt didn't just produce Dark Matter; he also helmed Vedder's well-received third solo album, Earthling, from 2022. Watt plays guitar in Vedder's live backing band, known as the Earthlings — which also includes Josh Klinghoffer, who replaced John Frusciante in the Red Hot Chili Peppers for a stint.\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nDark Matter was a comeback for Pearl Jam, but Hackney Diamonds was really a comeback for the Stones. While it had a hater or two, the overwhelming consensus was that it was the Stones' best album in decades — maybe even since 1978's Some Girls.\n\n\"I hope what makes it fresh and modern comes down to the way it's mixed, with focus on low end and making sure the drums are big,\" Watt, who wore a different Stones shirt every day in the studio, has said about Hackney Diamonds. \"But the record is recorded like a Stones album.\"\n\nWhere there are modern rock flourishes on Hackney Diamonds, \"There's no click tracks. There's no gridding. There's no computer editing,\" he continued. \"This s— is performed live and it speeds up and slows down. It's made to the f—ing heartbeat connection of Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Steve Jordan.\n\n\"And Charlie,\" Watt added, tipping a hat to Watts, who played on Hackney Diamonds but died before it came out. \"When Charlie's on it.\"\n\nIggy Pop\n\nEver since he first picked up a mic and removed his shirt, the snapping junkyard dog of the Stooges has stayed relevant — as far as indie, alternative and punk music has been concerned.\n\nBut aside from bright spots like 2016's Josh Homme-produced Post Pop Depression, his late-career output has felt occasionally indulgent and enervated. The 11 songs on 2023's eclectic Watt-produced Every Loser, on the other hand, slap you in the face in 11 different ways.\n\n\"We would jam and make tracks and send them to Iggy, and he would like 'em and write to them or wouldn't like them and we'd do something else,\" Watt told Billboard. \"It was very low pressure. We just kept making music until we felt like we had an album.\" (And as with Pearl Jam and Vedder's Earthlings band, Watt has rocked out onstage with Pop.\n\nOzzy Osbourne\n\nYou dropped your crown, O Prince of Darkness. When he hooked up with Watt, the original Black Sabbath frontman hadn't released any solo music since 2010's Scream; in 2017, Sabbath finally said goodbye after 49 years and 10 (!) singers.\n\nOn 2020's Ordinary Man and 2022's Patient Number 9, Watt reenergized Ozzy; even when he sounds his age, Ozz sounds resolute, defiant, spitting in the face of the Reaper. (A bittersweet aside: the late Taylor Hawkins appears on Patient Number 9, which was written and recorded in just four days.)\n\nMaroon 5\n\nYeah, yeah, they're more of a pop-rock band, but they have guitars, bass and drums. (And if you're the type of rock fan who's neutral or hostile to the 5, you shouldn't be; Songs About Jane slaps.)\n\nAt any rate, Watt co-produced \"Can't Leave You Alone,\" featuring Juice WRLD, from 2021's Jordi. Critics disparaged the album, but showed Watt's facility straddling the pop and rock worlds.\n\n5 Seconds of Summer\n\nWhen it comes to Andrew Watt, the Sydney pop-rockers — slightly more on the rock end than Maroon 5 and their ilk — are repeat customers. He produced a number of tracks for 5 Seconds of Summer, which spanned 2018's Youngblood, 2020's Calm and 2022's 5SOS5.\n\nRegarding the former: Watt has cited Youngblood as one of the defining recording experiences of his life.\n\n\"I had started working with 5 Seconds of Summer, and a lot of people looked at them as a boy band, but they're not,\" Watt told Guitar Player. \"They're all incredible musicians. They can all play every instrument. They love rock music. They can harmonize like skyrockets in flight. They just were making the wrong kind of music.\"\n\nSo Watt showed 5 Seconds of Summer a number of mainstays of the rock era, like Tears for Fears and the Police. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nElton John\n\nA year after Britney Spears was unshackled from her highly controversial conservatorship, it was time for a victory lap with the God of Glitter. What resulted was a curious little bauble, which became a megahit: \"Hold Me Closer,\" a spin on \"Tiny Dancer,\" \"The One\" and \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" that briefly launched Spears back into the stratosphere.\n\n\"Britney came in and she knew what she wanted to do,\" Watt recalled to The L.A. Times. \"We sped up the song a little bit and she sang the verses in her falsetto, which harkens back to 'Toxic.' She was having a blast.\"\n\nBlink-182\n\nWatt has also worked with pop/punk heroes Blink-182 — but not after Tom DeLonge made his grand return. He produced \"I Really Wish I Hated You\" from 2019's Nine, back when Matt Skiba was in the band.\n\nWhere in the rock world will this tender-aged superproducer strike next? Watt knows.\n\nSongbook: The Rolling Stones' Seven-Decade Journey To Hackney Diamonds\n\nThe rock scene may no longer be the dominant force it once was — blink-182's One More Time... is the only Billboard 200 chart-topper this year to predominantly fall under this category. But 2023 has still been an interesting and eventful period for those who like their guitar music turned up to eleven.\n\nOver the past 12 months, we've had the two biggest groups of the Swinging Sixties returning to the fray in style, a new European invasion, and a wave of blockbuster albums that may well go down as modern classics. And then there's the revivals which will no doubt spark nostalgia in any kids of the 2000s, a resurgence in all-star line-ups, and a residency that could possibly change how we experience live music.\n\nAs we gear up for the holiday season, here's a look at 10 trends that defined rock music in 2023.\n\nEuropean Rock Traveled To America\n\nFrom Lacuna Coil and Gojira to Volbeat and Rammstein, the Billboard charts aren't exactly strangers to European rock. But 2023 was the year when the continent appeared to band together for a mini invasion. Italian quartet Måneskin continued their remarkable journey from Eurovision Song Contest winners to bona fide rock gods with a Best New Artist nod at the 2023 GRAMMYs, a top 20 placing on the Billboard 200 albums chart for third album Rush!, and a Best Rock Video win at the MTV VMAs.\n\nMasked metalers Ghost scored a fourth consecutive Top 10 entry on the Billboard 200 with covers EP Phantomime, also landing a Best Metal Performance GRAMMY nomination for its cover of Iron Maiden's \"Phantom of the Opera,\" (alongside Disturbed's \"Bad Man,\" Metallica's \"72 Seasons,\" Slipknot's \"Hive Mind,\" and Spiritbox's \"Jaded\"). While fellow Swedes Avatar bagged their first Mainstream Rock No. 1 with \"The Dirt I'm Buried In,\" a highly melodic meditation on mortality which combines funky post-punk with freewheeling guitar solos that sound like they've escaped from 1980s Sunset Strip.\n\nAge Proved To Be Nothing But A Number\n\nThe theory that rock and roll is a young man's game was blown apart in 2023. Fronted by 80-year-old Mick Jagger, The Rolling Stones reached No.3 on the Billboard 200 thanks to arguably their finest album in 40 years, Hackney Diamonds, with lead single \"Angry\" also picking up a Best Rock Song GRAMMY nod alongside Olivia Rodrigo's \"aallad of a homeschooled girl,\" Queens of the Stone Age's \"Emotion Sickness,\" Boygenius' \"Not Strong Enough,\" and Foo Fighters' \"Rescued.\" (The latter two will also battle it out with Arctic Monkeys' \"Sculpture of Anything Goes,\" Black Pumas' \"More than a Love Song,\" and Metallica's \"Lux Aeterna\" for Best Rock Performance.)\n\nThe eternally shirtless Iggy Pop, a relative spring chicken at 76, delivered a late-career classic, too, with the star-studded Every Loser. And Bruce Springsteen, KISS, and Paul McCartney all proved they weren't ready for the slippers and cocoa life yet by embarking on lengthy world tours.\n\nDeath Was No Barrier To Hits\n\nJimmy Buffett sadly headed for that tropical paradise in the sky this year. But having already recorded 32nd studio effort, Equal Strain on All Parts, the margarita obsessive was able to posthumously score his first new entry on the Billboard Rock Chart since 1982's \"It's Midnight And I'm Not Famous Yet.\"\n\nBut he isn't the only artist to have recently achieved success from beyond the grave. Linkin Park reached the U.S. Top 40 with \"Lost,\" a track recorded for 2003 sophomore Meteora, but which only saw the light of day six years after frontman Chester Bennington's passing.\n\nPerhaps most unexpectedly of all, The Beatles topped the U.K. charts for the first time since 1969 thanks to \"Now and Then,\" a psychedelic tear-jerker in which surviving members McCartney and Ringo Starr brought previously unheard recordings from George Harrison and John Lennon back to life.\n\nThe Giants Stayed Giant\n\nFoo Fighters also overcame the death of a core member on what many rock fans would consider this year's most eagerly awaited album. Drummer Taylor Hawkins, who passed away in early 2022, doesn't feature on the poignant but vibrant But Here We Are. Yet the two-time GRAMMY nominated LP still proved to be a fitting tribute as well as an encouraging sign that Dave Grohl and co. can extend their legacy:lead single \"Rescued\" became their 12th number one on Billboard's Main Rock Chart.\n\nThe Best Rock Album category for the 2024 GRAMMYs proves that veterans were alive and mighty in 2023. Along with the Foos' latest LP, the nominees include another Grohl-affiliated band,, Queens of the Stone Age's first album in six years, In Times New Roman..., Paramore's This Is Why, Metallica's 72 Seasons and Greta Van Fleet's Starcatcher.. (Metallica's 72 Seasons also struck gold with its singles, three of which landed at No. 1 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, where lead single \"Lux Æterna\" spent 11 consecutive weeks on top.)\n\nOf course, we also have to give a shout-out to U2. Not for March's Songs of Surrender album (for which they re-recorded 40 of their biggest and best tracks), but for the immersive, eye-popping Las Vegas residency at The Sphere which potentially reinvented the future of live music.\n\nThe Rock Supergroup Continued To Thrive\n\n2023 spawned several new rock supergroups including Mantra of the Cosmos (Shaun Ryder, Zak Starkey and Andy Bell), Lol Tolhurst x Budgie x Jacknife Lee, and Better Lovers (various members of The Dillinger Escape Plan and Every Time I Die). But it was an already established all-star line-up that took the GRAMMY nominations by storm.\n\nConsisting of Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, and Julien Baker, boygenius bagged a remarkable seven nods at the 2024 ceremony. Throw in a well-received headline set at Coachella, U.S. Top 50 follow-up EP, and even a \"Saturday Night Live\" showing alongside Timothée Chalamet, and the trio couldn't have asked for a better way to continue what they started together in 2018.\n\nThe Early 2000s Enjoyed A Revival\n\nThe cyclical nature of the music industry meant that the era of choppy bangs and super-skinny jeans was always going to come back into fashion. And following throwbacks from the likes of Olivia Rodrigo and Willow, the original punk-pop brigade returned this year to prove they could still mosh with the best of them.\n\nPossibly the defining nasal voice of his generation, Tom DeLonge headed back into the studio with blink-182 for the first time in 12 years, with the resulting One More Time... topping the Billboard 200. Linkin Park (\"Lost\"), Papa Roach (\"Cut the Line\"), and a reunited Staind (\"Lowest in Me\") all scored No. 1s on the Mainstream Rock Airplay Chart, while Sum 41, Bowling For Soup, and Good Charlotte were just a few of the high school favorites who helped cement When We Were Young as the millennial's dream festival.\n\nThe Emo Scene Went Back To Its Roots\n\nAfter channeling the new wave and synth-pop of the 1980s on predecessor After Laughter, Paramore returned from a six-year absence with a record which harked back to their mid-2000s beginnings. But it wasn't their own feisty brand of punk-pop that Best Rock Album GRAMMY nominee This Is Why resembled. Instead, its nervy indie rock took its cues, as frontwoman Hayley Williams freely admits, from touring buddies Bloc Party.\n\nParamore weren't the only emo favorites to rediscover their roots. Fall Out Boy reunited with Under the Cork Tree producer Neal Avron and old label Fueled By Ramen on the dynamic So Much (for) Stardust. And while Taking Back Sunday further veered away from their signature sound, the Long Islanders still embraced the past by naming seventh LP 152 after the North Carolina highway stretch they used to frequent as teens.\n\nCountry Artists Tapped Into Rock Sensibilities\n\nWe're used to seeing rock musicians going a little bit country: see everyone from Steven Tyler and Bon Jovi to Darius Rucker and Aaron Lewis. But the opposite direction is usually rarer. In 2023, however, it seemed as though every Nashville favorite was suddenly picking up the air guitar.\n\nZach Bryan repositioned himself as Gen-Z's answer to Bruce Springsteen with the heartland rock of his eponymous Billboard 200 chart-topper (which is up for Best Country Album at the 2024 GRAMMYs alongside Kelsea Ballerini's Rolling Up the Welcome Mat, Brothers Osborne's self-titled LP, Tyler Childers' Rustin' in the Rain, and Lainey Wilson's Bell Bottom Country). Meanwhile, Hitmaker HARDY — who first cut his teeth penning hits for Florida Georgia Line and Blake Shelton — leaned into the sounds of hard rock and nu-metal on his second studio LP, The Mockingbird & the Crow.\n\nBut few committed more to the crossover than the one of country's greatest living legends. Dolly Parton roped in a whole host of hellraisers and headbangers including Richie Sambora, Joan Jett & The Blackhearts, and Rob Halford, for the 30-track Rockstar — her first rock-oriented project of her glittering 49-album career.\n\nPost-Grunge Reunions Were Abundant\n\nFans of the mopey '90s scene known as post-grunge had all their dreams come true this year thanks to several unexpected reunions. Turn-of-the-century chart-toppers Staind and Matchbox Twenty both returned with new albums after more than a decade away. Creed, meanwhile, announced they'd be headlining next year's Summer of '99 cruise after a similar amount of time out of the spotlight.\n\nThe insatiable appetite for all things nostalgia, of course, means that any band — no matter how fleeting their fame — can stage a lucrative comeback. Take Dogstar, for example, the unfashionable outfit boasting Hollywood nice guy Keanu Reeves. Twenty-three years after appearing to call it a day, the Los Angeles trio surprised everyone by hitting the Bottlerock Napa Valley Festival before dropping a belated third LP, Somewhere Between the Power Lines and Palm Trees and embarking on a headlining national tour.\n\nThe New Generation Gave The Old Their Dues\n\nSay what you want about today's musical generation, but they know to pay respect where it's due., Olivia Rodrigo, for example, doffed her cap to '90s alt-rock favorites The Breeders by inviting them to open on her 2024 world tour.\n\nNew working-class hero Sam Fender invited fellow Newcastle native Brian Johnson to perform two AC/DC classics at his hometown stadium show. While ever-changing Japanese kawaii metalers Babymetal debuted their latest incarnation on \"Metali,\" a collaboration with one of their musical idols, Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello.\n\nWhether new artists are teaming up with the old or veterans are continuing to receive their flowers, 2023 proved that rock is alive and well.\n\n2023 In Review: 5 Trends That Defined Hip-Hop\n\nThese days, what happens in Vegas, slays in Vegas when it comes to the harder side of music.\n\nIt might have seemed unthinkable a decade ago, but as Fat Mike of NOFX and Fat Wreck Chords has been putting out there for a while now, Sin City is basically \"the most punk city in the U.S.\" at the moment. Some might find this statement debatable, but Vegas has long attracted subculture-driven gatherings, from Viva Las Vegas rockabilly weekend to the all-metal Psycho Las Vegas to the mixed bag that was Las Rageous. The latest slate of huge punk and punk-adjacent music events (from Punk Rock Bowling and When We Were Young to the just-announced new lineup of Sick New World 2024) back his claim even further.\n\nMike’s own Punk Rock Museum, which opened in April of this year, has cemented the city’s alternative music cred — even as it’s still best known for gambling, clubbing, and gorging at buffets.\n\nIn fact, A lot of the audacious new activity is centered away from the big casinos and in the downtown area and arts district of what is known as \"old Vegas.\" Just outside of the tourist-trappy, Times Square-like Fremont Experience, there’s a vibrant live music scene anchored by a few key clubs, and an ever-growing slate of fests.\n\n*Attendees at 2022's When We Were Young Festival┃Photo: Tim Mosenfelder/FilmMagic*\n\nLive Nation’s second annual When We Were Young Festival brought out a largely Millennial crowd to see headliners Green Day and blink-182 this past weekend, alongside over two dozen more recognizable openers from emo/pop-punk's heyday. Tickets sold so well when it was first announced, that a second day was added to the schedule.\n\nGreen Day didn’t stop with their fest gigs; the band played a \"not-so-secret\" pop-up show last Thursday night at one of the most popular venues in town for punk, alternative and heavy music: Fremont Country Club, just blocks from festival grounds. The show served as a warm-up gig as well as an announcement by Billie Joe Armstrong: His band will join Smashing Pumpkins, Rancid, and others for a 2024 stadium tour. The band also debuted a timely new track, \"The American Dream Is Killing Me.\"\n\nRead More: Why 2002 Was The Year That Made Pop-Punk: Simple Plan, Good Charlotte & More On How \"Messing Around And Being Ourselves\" Became Mainstream\n\n\"People who like punk and other heavy music want to be in a club environment like ours, not a big casino,\" says Carlos \"Big Daddy\" Adley, owner of Fremont Country Club and its adjacent music space Backstage Bar & Grill. Both have become live music hotspots not unlike the ones Adley and his wife/partner Ava Berman ran in Los Angeles before they moved to Vegas over a decade ago.\n\n\"Fremont East,\" as the neighborhood is called, will soon see a boutique hotel from the pair. Like everything they do, it will have a rock n’ roll edge that hopes to draw both visitors and locals.\n\n*Outside Fremont Country Club┃Photo: Fred Morledge*\n\nThe duo told GRAMMY.com that a visit to Double Down Saloon, Sin City’s widely-recognized original punk bar and music dive was what first inspired them to come to Vegas and get into the nightlife business there. Double Down has been slinging booze (like Bacon Martinis and \"Ass Juice\" served in a ceramic toilet bowl mug) and booking live punk sounds since it opened back in 1992.\n\n\"It's kind of a stepping stone for a lot of bands,\" says Cameron Morat, a punk musician and photographer, who also works with the Punk Rock Museum as curator of its rockstar-led tour guide program. \"People always assume that Vegas is just the strip, but that's only like four miles long. There's a lot more of the ‘‘other city.’ There are people who are just into music and into going to local shows who don't ever go to the main strip.\"\n\nIn addition to the Double Down, Morat says Vegas has always had a history of throwing local punk shows at spaces like the Huntridge Theater, which is currently being remodeled and set to re-open soon for local live music. He also points to The Usual Place as a venue popular with local punk and rock bands now, and The Dive Bar — a favorite with the mohawk, patched-up battle vest scene, featuring heavy music seven nights a week, including a night promoted by his partner Masuimi Max called Vegas Chaos.\n\n*Cameron Morat┃Photo: Kristina Markovich*\n\nWhile glitzy stage shows from legacy artists and mega-pop hit makers like Usher, Elton John, Katy Perry, Carrie Underwood, Gwen Stefani and Lady Gaga still get the most media attention, raucous local shows are starting to factor into a new generation’s vacation planning, too.\n\n\"There’s a really good scene here,\" Morat proclaims. \"It's funny because a lot of people, the sort of gatekeepers of punk, ask ‘why is the punk museum in Vegas?’ But it is a punk city, and not just because you've got all the local bands and the venues.\"\n\nRead More: City On Fire: X's Explosive Debut Album Los Angeles At 40\n\nMorat, whose own band Soldiers of Destruction, plays around town on occasion, also notes other acts such as Gob Patrol, Suburban Resistance, and Inframundo as having fierce local followings. He says there’s a certain voracious vibe in Vegas that lends itself to punk rock creation, performance and attitude. \"A lot of the anger from punk rock — like the disparity of wealth, for instance, is here,\" he says. \"Five minutes down the road, you've got people throwing away a million on the roll of a dice. But you've also got people who are doing like three jobs just trying to pay their rent.\"\n\nOver at the Punk Rock Museum, Morat, who moved from Los Angeles to Vegas about seven years ago, is keeping busy booking big-name guests to share inspirations and war stories, both weekly, and specifically timed with whatever big festival or event happens to be in town. He says he wants to feature artists that might not be thought of as traditional punk rock, but who have relevant backgrounds and stories to share.\n\n\"A lot of these people have punk history the public doesn’t know about,\" he says. \"I think if we just stick to a very small well of people, it's going to get pretty boring. So I'm trying to open it up for a bigger cross-section.\"\n\n*Imagery from \"Black Punk Now\" | Ed Marshall*\n\nThe museum is already showing the breadth of punk rock’s influence on music in general. During WWWY, the museum held events tied to its new exhibit \"Black Punk Now,\" curated by James Spooner, director of the 2003 documentary Afro-Punk. As Spooner spoke about the film’s 20th anniversary and his new book of Black punk authors, musicians playing the weekend’s festivities from Sum 41, MxPx, Bayside, Less Than Jake came through to talk too. Warped Tour’s Kevin Lyman and Fat Mike himself also took part in the museum’s new after-dark guided tour series.\n\nBringing in a wider audience and a new generation of rebellious kids who seek to channel their angst and energy into music is part of what the museum — and, it seems, the myriad of events in Las Vegas these days — is all about. Despite what some punk rock purists and gatekeepers might say, the inclusion of tangent bands and scenes is in the original punk spirit. He’ll be booking guests tied to next year’s Sick New World, the Viva Las Vegas rockabilly bash and even EDC in the future (electronic bangers are not unlike hardcore ones and even Moby was a punk before he became a DJ).\n\n\"I think that the museum is great for the punk scene here,\" he adds. \"People will literally come to town just to see the museum, and then if there's a band playing in town in the evening, they'll go. So it's broadening the support for all the bands, local and touring. Some punk bands used to skip Vegas completely on their tours, but not anymore.\"\n\nRemembering When We Were Young: Avril Lavigne, Jimmy Eat World & More Bands Reflect On The Peak Of Emo & Hardcore Ahead Of Vegas Fest"
