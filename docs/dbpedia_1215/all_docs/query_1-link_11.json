        "text": "On this record, the trio reunited with longtime producer Rob Cavallo for the first time in a decade. Continuing this nostalgic venture, Saviors comes just ahead of the anniversary of their 1994 breakout album, Dookie, also produced by Cavallo and was performed from front-to-back at their surprise show in Las Vegas.\n\nThe deluxe edition album for Dookie dropped Sept. 29. Inside the record features four discs of over 25 demos, outtakes and songs, some from their 1994 performances in Woodstock and Barcelona.\n\nAlthough details on Saviors are still in the process of being revealed, here's what we know about the album so far.\n\nThe Album Drops In The New Year\n\nNew year, new sounds! Saviors drops Jan. 19, 2024, seemingly continuing the three-year tradition of dropping an album on years ending in four.\n\nTwo Tracks Have Been Unveiled\n\nAlthough the opening track, \"The American Dream Is Killing Me,\" was announced first, the group shared that it was one of the last tracks written for Saviors.\n\nIn a press statement, singer Billie Joe Armstrong describes the song as \"a look at the way the traditional American Dream doesn't work for a lot of people — in fact, it's hurting a lot of people.\"\n\nThe second song announced, \"Look Ma, No Brains!\" debuted last weekend at their sold-out show in Las Vegas. This track features a contagious, killer rock sound that marks an epic comeback for the group.\n\nSaviors Celebrates The Essence Of The Band\n\nSaviors seems to celebrate the years spent together. As they shared on X it invites fans \"into Green Day's brain, their collective spirit as a band, and an understanding of friendship, culture and legacy of the last 30 plus years.\"\n\nThe group continues, \"It's raw and emotional. Funny and disturbing. It's a laugh at the pain, weep in the happiness kind of record. Honesty and vulnerability.\"\n\nThe Vinyl Covers Are Set To Stand Out\n\nSeveral Exclusive Vinyls of Saviors will be released, including options of neon pink with neon green splatter or black ice with hot pink splatter. Vinyl records will be limited supply and pressed once.\n\nThe Inspiration Behind The Apocalyptic Music Video \"The American Dream Is Killing Me\"\n\nThe black & white music video, directed by Bredan Walter and Ryan Baxley, was shot in Los Angeles. With lyrics that describe the pain of America's way of living, with references to social media, unemployment and the housing crisis, this rock track sets the overall tone for the album.\n\nThe video shows the band is in the midst of a zombie-apocalyptic universe, which encapsulates the state of our world.This noir-inspired aesthetic could be shown in future tracks.\n\nPerformances Are Arriving Sooner Than You Think\n\nIf you missed the lively back-to-back performances in Las Vegas this past weekend, tune in this Thursday as the group performs on Amazon Music's Live Concert Series.\n\nAnd It doesn't stop yet! Green Day are planning a 2024 North American stadium tour with The Smashing Pumpkins, also including Rancid and The Linda Lindas.\n\nGear up for these performances and more — and watch this space for more information about Green Day’s Saviors as it arrives!\n\nGRAMMY Rewind: Green Day Celebrates The \"Danger And Fun\" Of Rock As They Win A GRAMMY For 'American Idiot' In 2005\n\nIt seemed that everyone wanted to capture a sliver of the magic from the original Woodstock. Although roughly 164,000 tickets were sold, the actual number of attendees exceeded 350,000 (surpassing even Coachella 2024's attendance rates).\n\nSpirits were high as the festival opened on Friday with dry, sunny skies highlighting performances from Sheryl Crow, Collective Soul, and others. By the weekend, the weather took a turn and transformed the festival grounds at Winston Farm in Saugerties into a giant muddy puddle. Although Woodstock '69 was also rainy and mud-filled, the madness that ensued at Woodstock '94 led it to be dubbed \"Mudstock.\"\n\nAs Primus performed \"My Name Is Mud\" on Saturday, festival-goers seized the opportunity to fling the wet dirt at the band on stage.\n\n\"Once I started singing the words to \"My Name Is Mud,\" all of a sudden huge chunks of sod started flying my way and it was pretty frightening,\" Primus' lead singer told Billboard 20 years later. \"I still have those [speaker] cabinets to this day, and those cabinets still have mud in them.\"\n\nBy the end of the performance, lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong had lost his pants and the band had to be escorted out of the festival grounds by a helicopter. On their way off the stage, security confused mud-covered bassist Mike Dirnt for a crazed fan and tackled him, leaving him with five fewer teeth than he started the set with.\n\n\"He actually sheared my teeth, and I blew like five teeth. Only one of them died. I fixed the rest of them, but he all sheared up the back of my teeth,\" Dirnt confessed to The Aquarian in 2013. \"It was horrible. But the great thing about it is that I was able to get out of there, and I'd do it again tomorrow if I had to.\"\n\nPeter Gabriel closed out the weekend by remaining true to the original mission of the festival, offering fans peace filled with good vibes. Gabriel's music, though deeply contrasting with the hard rock and punk acts that dominated the festival, provided a flawless end to the chaos that had unfolded over the past three days.\n\nWhile the 1994 installment of Woodstock hasn't basked in the same spotlight as its 1969 and 1999 siblings — the latter of which has been the subject of two documentaries in as many years — it remains far from forgotten.\n\nWoodstock '94 stands as one of the legendary music festivals of all time. Although the rain may have soaked the grounds, turning it into a muddy catastrophe, it also nourished the roots of some of the most iconic musical acts and sent them into the mainstream media. The festival was more than just a series of performances, but rather a unique cultural event.\n\nAs a founding member of the National Recording Preservation Board, the Recording Academy was instrumental in lobbying and getting the board created by Congress. Now, the Library of Congress has added new treasures to the National Recording Registry, preserving masterpieces that have shaped American culture.\n\nThe 2024 class not only celebrates modern icons like Green Day’s punk classic Dookie and Biggie Smalls' seminal Ready to Die, but also honors vintage gems like Gene Autry’s \"Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" and Perry Como’s hits from 1957. These recordings join over 650 titles that constitute the registry — a curated collection housed within the Library’s vast archive of nearly 4 million sound recordings.\n\nLibrarian of Congress Carla Hayden announced these additions as essential pieces of our nation’s audio legacy, each selected for their cultural, historical, or aesthetic importance. This selection process is influenced by public nominations, which hit a record number this year, emphasizing the public's role in preserving audio history.\n\nRead more: Inside Green Day's Intimate \"Right Here, Right Now\" Global Climate Concert In San Francisco\n\n\"The Library of Congress is proud to preserve the sounds of American history and our diverse culture through the National Recording Registry,\" Hayden said. \"We have selected audio treasures worthy of preservation with our partners this year, including a wide range of music from the past 100 years, as well as comedy. We were thrilled to receive a record number of public nominations, and we welcome the public’s input on what we should preserve next.\"\n\nThe latest selections named to the registry span from 1919 to 1998 and range from the recordings of the all-Black 369th U.S. Infantry Band led by James Reese Europe after World War I, to defining sounds of jazz and bluegrass, and iconic recordings from pop, dance, country, rock, rap, Latin and classical music.\n\n\"For the past 21 years the National Recording Preservation Board has provided musical expertise, historical perspective and deep knowledge of recorded sound to assist the Librarian in choosing landmark recordings to be inducted into the Library’s National Recording Registry,\" said Robbin Ahrold, Chair of the National Recording Preservation Board. \"The board again this year is pleased to join the Librarian in highlighting influential works in our diverse sound heritage, as well as helping to spread the word on the National Recording Registry through their own social media and streaming media Campaigns.\"\n\nTune in to NPR's \"1A\" for \"The Sounds of America\" series, featuring interviews with Hayden and selected artists, to hear stories behind this year’s picks. Stay connected to the conversation about the registry via social media and listen to many of the recordings on your favorite streaming service.\n\nFor more details on the National Recording Registry and to explore more about the selections, visit The Library of Congress's official National Recording Registry page.\n\nNational Recording Registry, 2024 Selections (chronological order)\n\n\"Clarinet Marmalade\" – Lt.

Fittingly titled Saviors, the band's 14th release is wholly in the present while connecting to their lynchpin albums: 1994's Dookie and 2004's American Idiot.\n\nThe quartet will tour Saviors — which was released Jan. 19 and shares a title with the tour — in conjunction with the 20th and 30th anniversaries of Green Day's major albums. As with any major milestone, creating a new record as two of their biggest albums aged created a bit of wistful creative confusion.\n\n\"Did I want it to be an old-school Green Day punk record, or did I want to do something that felt more lush and stadiumlike?\" leader Billie Joe Armstrong told Vulture. \"When we saw it come together, I remembered thinking, Oh, this is the connection. Saviors does feel like a trifecta with Dookie and American Idiot where it feels like a life's work.\n\n\"I went from not knowing what the hell I was doing,\" Armstrong continued, \"to going, 'Oh gosh, we managed to bridge the gap between those two huge albums.'\"\n\nThis summer, listeners can behold the triad: Green Day will perform the relentless, hilarious, melody-stuffed Dookie and stadium-sized, polemical American Idiot in full. Tickets to the international dates — with support from the Smashing Pumpkins, the Hives, the Linda Lindas, and many more — can be found at their website.\n\nWith Saviors out in the world, here's a breakdown of the ramp-up to the album.\n\nThey're Not Getting Sucked Into The Past\n\nTwo albums, from decades ago, performed front-to-back, in stadiums the world over: that could categorize Green Day as a nostalgia act. But Green Day are nostalgic for nothing; rather, they still harbor the ethos of their punk youth.\n\n\"I still try to maintain that kind of spirit about what we do,\" Armstrong told People, \"which is just being independent and free to express yourself the way that you want.\" That might mean a surprise set inside a New York City subway station, or announcing their Saviors tour plans on \"The Howard Stern Show.\"\n\n\"I think one of the strong points of this band is we just stay in the moment,\" Dirnt said to Rolling Stone. \"Don't look backwards, and don't look too far forward. Stay in the moment, but appreciate the moment.\" And the Saviors tour will provide so many moments to remember.\n\n10 Bay Area Punk Bands To Know: Dead Kennedys, Operation Ivy, Green Day & More"
