        "text": "Welcome to Planet Earth (Taylor’s Version). We’re just days away from the release of Taylor Swift’s 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, and thanks to a trail of bread crumbs and Easter eggs left by Swift herself, there’s already plenty to talk about and speculate upon, even leading to analysis of songs that nobody has even heard yet.\n\nSwift announced the existence and release date of the Midnights follow-up album in perhaps the flexiest way possible: onstage, as part of her acceptance speech for best pop vocal album at the Grammys 2024.\n\nThough fans had long speculated that she was gearing up to announce her latest rerecording (only her debut album and 2017’s Reputation remain on the Taylor’s Version to-do list), Swift had something else in mind.\n\n“I want to say thank you to the fans by telling you a secret I’ve been keeping from you for the last two years,” she said. “Which is that my brand-new album comes out April 19. It’s called The Tortured Poets Department.”\n\nSo where do we enroll?\n\nAhead of the release of Swift’s new album, here’s everything we know so far.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWhen is The Tortured Poets Department coming out?\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department will be released on April 19, 2024.\n\nHmm, is that date significant in some way?\n\nIs Taylor Swift the artist with the most Album of the Year Grammys in history? The answer to both those questions is yes.\n\nApril 19, 2023 is a significant date in Swiftdom: That's the day that many of Swift's nearest and dearest, including brother Austin Butler, friends Gigi Hadid, Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Ashley Avignon and more unfollowed Joe Alwyn on social media, which for many was a signal that the couple would never, ever, ever get back together. Like, ever.\n\nSwift is also fond of using war imagery when writing about love, like on Midnights's “The Great War,” which likens fighting for a struggling relationship to ongoing campaigns. It's worth noting, then, that April 19, 1775, is the date of “the shot heard round the world,” the beginning of the American Revolution. Taken with the knowledge that Alwyn is a Brit and Swift is Miss Americana herself, the date hardly feels like a coincidence.\n\nWhat’s that title, The Tortured Poets Department, in reference to?\n\nThe short version of that is a big shrug. The longer, more speculative version? It may or may not be a deliberate echo of the now infamous “Tortured Man Club” group chat that Alwyn shared he’s part of on WhatsApp with Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal.\n\nWhat will the songs be about?\n\nIn the lead-up to the release of The Tortured Poets Department, Swift shared five playlists of her own songs on Apple Music, seemingly curated according to the five stages of grief. There’s denial (I Love You, It’s Ruining My Life), anger (You Don’t Get to Tell Me About Sad), bargaining (Am I Allowed to Cry?), depression (Old Habits Die Screaming), and finally, acceptance (I Can Do It With a Broken Heart). Swift recorded voice memos to accompany each playlist, saying of the final collection, for example, “These songs represent making room for more good in your life—making that choice—because a lot of time when we lose things, we gain things too.”\n\nThis, along with the “last two years” timeline she mentioned when announcing the album—the last gasps and ultimate ending of her relationship with Alwyn—has us guessing that the album won’t not be about the breakup.\n\nWill we see Travis Kelce stuff on there?\n\nLove takes time, and so does recording an album. It’s possible that her newish relationship with Kelce, which kicked off sometime in the summer of 2023, influenced tracks, but not terribly likely. When Swift began working on the album, right after she released Midnights, she hadn’t yet met Kelce.\n\nIs it going to be good?\n\nListen, Travis Kelce has heard the album, and he says it’s “unbelievable.” Considering he attended the Eras Tour of his own accord, it’s safe to assume that he’s a true-blue Swiftie and can be trusted, romantic bias or no.\n\nWho is she collaborating with?\n\nPost Malone and Florence Welch (of Florence + the Machine) are both credited with performing on the album’s track list.\n\nWhat’s on the track list?\n\nSwift initially released the official track list for the album in an Instagram post in February. Early in the morning on April 19, Swift revealed The Tortured Poets Department is a double album with 15 more songs in addition to what was first announced. “It’s a 2am surprise: The Tortured Poets Department is a secret DOUBLE album. I’d written so much tortured poetry in the past 2 years and wanted to share it all with you, so here’s the second installment of TTPD: The Anthology. 15 extra songs. And now the story isn’t mine anymore… it’s all yours,” she wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\n\n1. “Fortnight” (feat. Post Malone)\n\n2. “The Tortured Poets Department”\n\n3. “My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys”\n\n4. “Down Bad”\n\n5. “So Long, London”\n\n6. “But Daddy I Love Him”\n\n7. “Fresh Out the Slammer”\n\n8. “Florida!!!” (feat. Florence + the Machine)\n\n9. “Guilty as Sin?”\n\n10. “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?”\n\n11. “I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)”\n\n12. “LOML”\n\n13. “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart”\n\n14. “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived”\n\n15. “The Alchemy”\n\n16. “Clara Bow”\n\n17. “The Black Dog”\n\n18. “imgonnagetyouback”\n\n19. “The Albatross”\n\n20. “Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus”\n\n21. “How Did It End?”\n\n22. “So High School”\n\n23. “I Hate It Here”\n\n24. “thanK you aIMee”\n\n25. “I Look in People's Windows”\n\n26. “The Prophecy”\n\n27. “Cassandra”\n\n28. “Peter”\n\n29. “The Bolter”\n\n30. “Robin”\n\n31. “The Manuscript”\n\nDid Taylor write all these alone, or what?\n\nSongwriting credits for The Tortured Poets Department feature Swift as the sole or co-writer. Frequent collaborator and producer Jack Antonoff is listed as co-writer on eight tracks, and The National’s Aaron Dessner, who played a key role in Swift’s pandemic-era Folklore and Evermore albums, helped pen five of them. Post Malone (credited as Austin Post) and Florence Welch each helped write the songs they perform on, “Fortnight (Feat. Post Malone)” and “Florida!!!” respectively.\n\nShouldn’t there be an apostrophe in the title?\n\nNo. It’s fine. The department doesn’t belong to the tortured poets, it’s a department of tortured poets. Find something else to worry about."
