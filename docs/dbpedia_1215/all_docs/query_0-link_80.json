        "text": "Motivation:\n\nRecord linkage continues to grow in importance as a fundamental activity in statistical agencies. The number of available administrative lists and commercial files has grown exponentially and present statistical agencies with opportunities to accumulate information through record-linkage to support the production of official statistics. In addition to cost, new obstacles to traditional data collection have emerged in the form of possibly recurrent pandemics. These circumstances further motivate the accumulation of information by linking public, private and administrative files. Thibaudeau (2020) describes the strides the Census Bureau, a pioneer in record linkage, has made over the years. While this is impressive, more is needed. With its own suite of in-house record-linkage software packages, such as the “SAS (PVS) Matcher,” “BigMatch,” “d-blink” and “MAMBA,” and easy access to open-source packages, such as “fastLink” and “RecordLinkage in R,” the Census Bureau now has access to a wide spectrum of methodologies and the potential to rapidly develop and integrate new ones. The Census Bureau must remain abreast of the ever improving state-of-the-art in record linkage and be prepared to champion its own methodologies as some of the best in the world. Our goal is to achieve the synergy of methods and software that will benefit most the Census Bureau and its mission. System portability is also an objective. The Census Bureau should have the freedom to upgrade its IT infrastructure knowing record-linkage applications will remain functional.\n\nResearch Problems:\n\nOne challenge is continuing to research and experiment with new methodologies on multiple software platforms while also moving toward integration. Description of such experiments are:\n\nMarkov Chains Monte-Carlo (MCMC), like that powered by d-blink, give full probabilistic characterizations of the record-linkage process and are becoming indispensable for full comprehension of a record linkage process. At the same time MCMCs can be tweaked to deliver fast snapshots of the linked population. Research in that direction is crucial. Old-School programs like BigMatch have been greatly optimized for fast linking but lack in nuance. They need to be garnished by richer comparison schemes, such as dictionary-assisted fuzzy string comparisons.\n\nNew data structure for record-linkage of multiple large lists need to be explored. d-blink is an example of a more efficient data structure: Node-connected structures minimize the number of comparisons, as opposed to a traditional all pairwise comparisons. Other structures are possible, such as cyclical linked lists (Thibaudeau 1992), and should be researched.\n\nAs new techniques continue to be implemented and experimented on various existing software (R, Python, C) and hardware (Windows, OSX, IRE, CAES) platforms, the dominant paradigms are emerging and work toward integration and unification, while maintaining versatility, is moving in high gear.\n\nCurrent Subprojects:\n\nAdjusting the Statistical Analysis on Integrated Data (Ben-David)\n\nEntity Resolution and Merging Noisy Databases (Steorts, Brown/CES, Blalock/CODS, Thibaudeau)\n\nRecord-Linkage Support for the Decennial Census (Ben-David, Weinberg, Brown/CES, Thibaudeau)\n\nPotential Applications:\n\nPossible massive concurrent record-linkage implementations for Census 2030. The objective is counting all distinguishable persons in linked and unduplicated administrative and commercial person-level lists.\n\nUnduplication and record-linkage for frame construction in the demographic and economic areas.\n\nRe-identification through record-linking for proofing confidentiality of data lists.\n\nAnalysis and estimation based on linked lists.\n\nLinking probabilistic design-based surveys to large non-probability lists and sample for probabilistic calibration.\n\nAccomplishments (October 2018-September 2020):\n\nDeployed the FEBRL (Peter Christen) Python file simulator on multiple platforms.\n\nUsed FEBRL to simulate candidate files –up to 500k records each- for record-linkage with known “true-links.” Used the simulated files to assess the rates of precision and recall of “BigMatch” and the “SAS (PVS) matcher.”\n\nPresented poster at Data Linkage Day 2019 entitled: \"False Duplicates in the Census: A Novel Approach to identifying False Matches from Record Linkage Software.\"\n\nWrote EM algorithm for estimating the weights of the Fellegi-Sunter record-linkage model for use with “BigMatch” and the R “RecordLinkage” package.\n\nInstalled BigMatch on multiple platforms IRE, Windows, MacOS (simulated data).\n\nRan experiments to measure and compare the performance in speed and CPU cycles of a multi-core linkage software (R fastLink) and an optimized single-core record-linkage software (BigMatch) in a multi-core environment.\n\nUsed BigMatch for multiple linkage projects, including the linkage of commercial files, in the construction of a master reference file at the person and housing unit levels for research and experimentation in preparation for Census 2030.\n\nShort-Term Activities (FY 2021 - FY 2023):\n\nProvide advice to individuals who plan to update and maintain the programs for record linkage and related data preparation.\n\nConduct research on record linkage error-rate estimation, particularly for unsupervised and semi-supervised situations.\n\nEvaluate “R” vs “Python” packages for record linkage focusing on fuzzy string comparison.\n\nAssess the possibility of using a surname and given-name reference directory for record-linkage in decennial-census production.\n\nContinue to research statistical and data-science methods for record linkage. Explore and compare in-house and “off-the-shelf” packages implementing these methods. Ascertain the competency of record-linkage methods at the Census Bureau.\n\nExtending record linkage outside the PIK universe.\n\nLonger-Term Activities (beyond FY 2023):\n\nConstruct census-based equivalence dictionaries of U.S. given names and surnames for cross-referencing and supervised learning in record-linkage.\n\nIntegrate new methods in our in-house record-linkage engines. Consider the integration of off-the-shelf packages when advantageous.\n\nEvaluate and compare in-house and off-the-shelf data-science programs and packages (R and/or Python) to construct engines for massive numbers of record-linkage runs for Census 2030.\n\nFurther develop Markov Chain Monte-Carlo applications embedding record-linkage methods in massive parallel processing. Develop methods for extracting record-linkage snapshots from MCMCs.\n\nSelected Publications:\n\nWang, Z., Ben-David, E., and Slawski, M.
