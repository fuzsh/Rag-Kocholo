        "text": "If you’re new to the ARMY and looking for more information on all of BTS’ songs and albums, we’re here to help! Here’s a complete list of BTS’ discography as well as the meaning and inspiration behind the singles!\n\nLatest update: We added the details for “Butter” which was released in May 2021!\n\nBTS released their first single on June 12, 2013, and have been releasing songs and albums non-stop ever since then. It’s especially impressive when you look at how involved all of the BTS members are in the process of creating music, from helping to write lyrics and even producing some tracks as well.\n\nIn the years since BTS’ first album, they’ve racked up an impressive discography that includes both Korean and Japanese albums. All of BTS’ songs and albums have personal meanings and stories behind them.\n\nThrough all BTS’ albums, you can track the members’ lives as they grew up and had to learn to deal with their ever-evolving fame. You can also hear their life together, channeling all of the challenges life threw their way into their music.\n\nFrom discussing topics on growing up, pressures they’ve faced, mental health struggles, love and loss, dealing with others trying to tear them down, and learning to love themselves despite it all, the members have really become open books through their music.\n\nThe main members of BTS that have worked as producers and songwriters include RM (Kim Namjoon), Suga (Min Yoongi), and J-Hope (Jung Hoseok), though other members have worked on songs as well. They’ve also worked as producers for other artists.\n\nWant information about some of the BTS members solo projects?

Intro: 2 Cool 4 Skool (feat. DJ Friz)\n\n2. We Are Bulletproof Pt.2\n\n3. Skit: Circle Room Talk\n\n4. No More Dream\n\n5. Interlude\n\n6. 좋아요 I Like It\n\n7. Outro: Circle Room Cypher\n\n8. Hidden Track: Skit: On The Start Line\n\n9. Hidden Track: 길 Road/Path\n\n“No More Dream” was BTS’ first single ever, and, impressively, the lyrics were written by BTS band members RM, Suga, and J-Hope along with their producers.\n\nThe lyrics to the single reveal a theme that the group revisited often in their early days: young people being pushed to go to school to fulfill the dreams of others and not necessarily their own.\n\nJ-Hope once explained that the lyrics touch on “the anxiety that comes from the vague realities we face and that we should try to overcome such anxieties.”\n\n“We Are Bulletproof Pt.2” was their second single from the album. The lyrics discuss the hardships the group had already faced by being looked down upon by others, but overcoming all of the attacks with their hard work and dedication.\n\nSuga reviewed the album in a video and revealed that they wanted to convey how hard they had worked in their years of training and that they were confident with their debut.\n\n‘O!RUL8,2?’\n\nRelease Date: September 11, 2013\n\nO!RUL8,2? Tracklist:\n\n1. Intro: O!RUL8,2?\n\n2. N.O\n\n3. We On\n\n4. Skit: R U Happy Now?\n\n5. If I Ruled The World\n\n6. Coffee\n\n7. BTS Cypher Pt.1\n\n8. 진격의 방탄 Attack on Bangtan\n\n9. 팔도강산 Paldo Gangsan/Satoori Rap\n\n10. OUTRO : Luv In Skool\n\n“N.O” was the title track of O!RUL8,2?, and similarly to their first single “No More Dream,” “N.O” is about the pressure on students to become “studying machines,” even when it sacrifices their own dreams and happiness.\n\nThis theme is also displayed in the music video for “N.O” where BTS members play students being fed pills in a classroom setting to make them complacent for their studies.\n\n“Attack on Bangtan” (also known as “The Rise of Bangtan”) didn’t get its own official music video but became a popular track from the album and was used during promotions for the album.\n\nThe song features a more energetic and fun beat than their previous singles, while the lyrics warn other idols about the impending rise of the band as they use their fire to captivate fans.\n\n‘Skool Luv Affair’\n\nRelease Date: February 12, 2014\n\nSkool Luv Affair Tracklist:\n\n1. Intro: Skool Luv Affair\n\n2. 상남자 Boy In Luv\n\n3. Skit: Soulmate\n\n4. 어디에서 왔는지 Where Did You Come From\n\n5. 하루만 Just One Day\n\n6. Tomorrow\n\n7. BTS Cypher Pt.2: Triptych\n\n8. 등골브레이커 Spine Breaker\n\n9. Jump\n\n10. Outro: Propose\n\n“Boy In Luv” was the lead single of the album, and the lyrics of the song are about a typical high school crush, as well as a boys’ confusion over having feelings for the girl.\n\nEven with the cute theme of the song, BTS still put a hip-hop twist on the sound which makes it stand out.\n\n“Just One Day” was the second single off of Skool Luv Affair.\n\nThough this song has a similar theme to “Boy In Luv” it’s a much softer and and slower song. This allowed BTS to show off another side of their music for the first time in a single.\n\n‘Skool Luv Affair: Special Addition’\n\nRelease Date: May 13, 2014\n\nSkool Luv Affair: Special Addition Tracklist:\n\n1. Miss Right\n\n2. 좋아요 I Like It (Slow Jam Remix)\n\n3. Intro : Skool Luv Affair\n\n4. 상남자 Boy In Luv\n\n5. Skit: Soulmate\n\n6. 어디에서 왔는지 Where Did You Come From\n\n7. 하루만 Just One Day\n\n8. Tomorrow\n\n9. BTS Cypher Pt.2: Triptych\n\n10. 등골브레이커 Spine Breaker\n\n11. Jump\n\n12. Outro: Propose\n\n‘No More Dream’\n\n(Japanese album)\n\nRelease Date: June 4, 2014\n\nVersions: Regular, A, B\n\nNo More Dream Tracklist:\n\n1. No More Dream (Japanese Ver.)\n\n2. いいね! (I Like It!) (Japanese Ver.)\n\n3. 進撃の防弾 (The Rise of Bangtan) (Japanese Ver.)\n\n“No More Dream” (Japanese Ver.) became the first song that BTS made an entirely new music video for the Japanese version of the song.\n\n‘BOY IN LUV’\n\n(Japanese album)\n\nRelease Date: July 16, 2014\n\nVersions: Regular, A, B\n\nBOY IN LUV Tracklist:\n\n1. BOY IN LUV (Japanese Ver.)\n\n2. N.O (Japanese Ver.)\n\n3. Just One Day (Japanese Ver.)\n\nBTS released a music video for the Japanese version of “BOY IN LUV,” which was only slightly different from the Korean version.\n\n‘Dark & Wild’\n\nRelease Date: August 19, 2014\n\nDark & Wild Tracklist:\n\n1. Intro: What am I to You\n\n2. Danger\n\n3. War Of Hormone\n\n4. Hip Hop Lover / Phile\n\n5. LET ME KNOW\n\n6. Rain\n\n7. BTS Cypher, Pt. 3: KILLER ft. Supreme Boi\n\n8. Interlude: What Are You Doing 뭐해\n\n9. 핸드폰 좀 꺼줄래 Could You Turn Off Your Cell Phone?\n\n10. 이불킥 Blanket Kick/Embarrassed\n\n11. 24/7=heaven\n\n12. 여기 봐 Look here\n\n13. 2학년 Second Grade\n\n14. Outro: Does That Make Sense? 그게 말이 돼?\n\n“Danger” brought back the theme of young relationships. This time, the song expresses the angst of feeling like your feelings are stronger than the other person’s. It also features a sound that’s influenced by both hip-hop and rock.\n\n“War Of Hormone” was released as the second single off the album and was met with some criticism over the lyrics for objectifying women. It even caused them to release a statement admitting that they reviewed the lyrics and realized they could be perceived as misogynistic but that it wasn’t their intention during the writing process.\n\nSince then, Big Hit’s whole team and BTS’ members have taken it upon themselves to meet with experts and read more books when they tackle sensitive subjects.\n\nPersonally, I don’t actually find the songs lyrics to be that bad. Though it’s comforting to know that BTS is always willing to take constructive criticism to better themselves.\n\n‘Danger’\n\n(Japanese album)\n\nRelease Date: November 19, 2014\n\nVersions: Regular, A, B\n\nDanger Tracklist:\n\n1. Danger (Japanese Ver.)\n\n2. 進撃の防弾 (The Rise of Bangtan – SONPUB REMIX) (Japanese Ver.)\n\n3. Miss Right (Japanese Ver.)\n\n“Danger” also received a music video for its Japanese version and does have some differences from the Korean version, though many of the scenes are familiar.\n\n‘Wake Up’\n\n(Japanese album)\n\nRelease Date: December 24, 2014\n\nVersions: Regular, A, B\n\nWake Up Tracklist:\n\n1. INTRO\n\n2. THE STARS\n\n3. JUMP (Japanese Ver.)\n\n4. Danger (Japanese Ver.)\n\n5. BOY IN LUV (Japanese Ver.)\n\n6. Just One Day -Japanese Ver. Extended-\n\n7. いいね! (I Like It!) – Japanese Ver.-\n\n8. I Like It Pt.2 ~In That Place~ (いいね！Pt.2～あの場所で～” )\n\n9. No More Dream (Japanese Ver.)\n\n10. 進撃の防弾 (The Rise of Bangtan) (Japanese Ver.)\n\n11. N.O (Japanese Ver.)\n\n12. Wake Up\n\n13. OUTRO\n\nWake Up was BTS’ first Japanese album to feature songs that weren’t on any previous BTS albums in Korean. However, none of the songs received their own music videos. The title track, “Wake Up,” has similar themes to “No More Dream” and “N.O.” as the lyrics detail the young men’s exhaustion from being overworked and pressured by their parents.\n\n‘화양연화 Pt. 1’\n\nThe Most Beautiful Moment In Life Pt.1′\n\nRelease Date: April 29, 2015\n\nVersions: Pink and White\n\n화양연화 Pt. 1 Tracklist:\n\n1. Intro: 화양연화 Blooming Youth\n\n2. I NEED U\n\n3. 잡아줘 Hold Me Tight\n\n4. Skit: Expectation!\n\n5. 쩔어 DOPE\n\n6. 흥탄소년단 Boyz With Fun\n\n7. Converse High\n\n8. 이사 Moving On\n\n9. Outro: Love is Not Over\n\n“I NEED U” was the lead single for The Most Beautiful Moment In Life Pt.1 and also brought in a more pop sound for BTS. The members explained that it’s about trying to hold on to love that is about to end and the anxiety that comes along with that.\n\n“DOPE” was the group’s first music video to surpass 100 million views on YouTube and got a lot of international attention as well. The song also touches on how young people struggle to succeed with the expectations placed on them.\n\nSuga also explained in one of his unboxing videos that he was able to write his lyrics very quickly thanks to having fun working with the beat of the song.\n\n‘FOR YOU’\n\n(Japanese album)\n\nRelease Date: June 17, 2015\n\nVersions: Regular, A, B\n\nFOR YOU Tracklist:\n\n1. FOR YOU\n\n2. ホルモン戦争 War of Hormone (Japanese Ver.) Lyrics\n\n3. Let Me Know (Japanese Ver.) Lyrics\n\n“FOR YOU” was the first BTS song on a Japanese album that wasn’t on a Korean album to receive its own music video! It’s a soft, romantic song about longing to be with one’s partner as distance keeps them apart.\n\n‘화양연화 Pt 2.’\n\nThe Most Beautiful Moment In Life Pt.2′\n\nRelease Date: November 30, 2015\n\nVersions: Blue and Peach\n\n화양연화 Pt 2. Tracklist:\n\n1. INTRO: Never Mind\n\n2. RUN\n\n3. Butterfly\n\n4. Whalien 52\n\n5. Ma City\n\n6. 뱁새 Crow-Tit/Baepsae\n\n7. SKIT: One Night In A Strange City\n\n8. 고엽 Dead Leaves\n\n9. OUTRO: House Of Cards\n\n“Run” had lyrics included from many of the members including RM (Kim Namjoon), Suga (Min Yoongi), V (Kim Taehyung), Jungkook (Jeon Jeongguk), and J-Hope (Jung Hoseok).\n\nBTS explained that the track takes on the difficulties of youth with daring lyrics. “We didn’t want to just blankly say ‘cheer up’ or ‘be strong.’ We really wanted to comfort people our way, by producing the music and writing the lyrics ourselves. We poured our heart and soul into this amazing song.”\n\n“Baepsae,” also known as “Silver Spoon,” is inspired by the Korean proverb “When crow-tit walk like stork, its crotch will tear.”\n\nThe song explains how young people are the crow-tit trying to keep up with the people in power, a.k.a. the storks, but end up ruining themselves in the process. Fueled by its powerful beat and choreography, the song has been a fan favorite for many years.\n\nDKDKTV has a great explanation of this song in further detail from a Korean perspective.\n\n‘I NEED U’\n\n(Japanese album)\n\nRelease Date: December 8, 2015\n\nVersions: Regular, Limited Edition, Christmas Special, HMV\n\nI NEED U Tracklist:\n\n1. I NEED U (Japanese Ver.)\n\n2. DOPE -超ヤベー!- (Japanese Ver.)\n\n3. フンタン少年団 (Boyz With Fun) (Japanese Ver.)\n\nThe music video for “I NEED U” (Japanese Ver.) is interesting because it was filmed with a much different theme from the Korean version, unlike some of the previous Japanese versions of songs that ended up with music videos very similar to the Korean versions.\n\n‘RUN’\n\n(Japanese album)\n\nRelease Date: March 15, 2016\n\nVersions: Regular, Pony Canyon Limited Ed., HMV Limited Ed.\n\nRUN Tracklist:\n\n1. RUN (Japanese Ver.)\n\n2. Butterfly (Japanese Ver.)\n\n3. Good Day\n\nThe music video for “RUN” (Japanese Ver.) has similar themes to the Korean version, but it’s still pretty original with different scenes and locations.\n\n‘화양연화 The Most Beautiful Moment In Life: Young Forever’\n\nRelease Date: May 2, 2016\n\nVersions: Night and Day\n\n화양연화 The Most Beautiful Moment In Life: Young Forever Tracklist:\n\n1. Intro: 화양연화 Blooming Youth\n\n2. I NEED U\n\n3. 잡아줘 Hold Me Tight\n\n5. Butterfly (Prologue Mix)\n\n7. Ma City\n\n8. 뱁새 Crow-Tit/Baepsae\n\n9. 쩔어 DOPE\n\n10. 불타오르네 FIRE\n\n11. Save Me\n\n12. EPILOGUE: Young Forever\n\n13. Converse High\n\n14. 이사 Moving On\n\n15. Whalien 52\n\n16. Butterfly\n\n17. House Of Cards (Full Length Edition)\n\n18. Love Is Not Over (Full Length Edition)\n\n19. I NEED U (Urban Mix)\n\n20. I NEED U (Remix)\n\n21. RUN (Ballad Mix)\n\n22. RUN (Alternative Mix)\n\n23. Butterfly (Alternative Mix)\n\n“FIRE” has a similar theme to “RUN” about how everyone makes mistakes with a much different sound.\n\nWith the impressive rap lyrics, the group chants, and the electronic-sounding pop, something about the song just makes you want to throw a house party.\n\nThough released first, “Save Me” is now often performed live with another track from Love Yourself: 結 Answer, “I’m Fine.” The two songs are influenced by ambigrams. When flipped over, the words can be read as one or the other, and similarly the songs reflect that.\n\nIn “Save Me,” the lyrics reflect someone fighting depression and calling out for help, while in “I’m Fine” the lyrics show the person starting to recover from depression and in part thanking another person for helping them through it.\n\n‘Youth’\n\n(Japanese album)\n\nRelease Date: September 7, 2016\n\nVersions: Regular, Limited Edition\n\nYouth Tracklist:\n\n1. Introduction: Youth\n\n2. FIRE (Japanese Ver.)\n\n3. RUN (Japanese Ver.)\n\n4. DOPE -超ヤベー!- (Japanese Ver.)\n\n5. Good Day\n\n6. Save Me (Japanese Ver.)\n\n7. フンタン少年団 Boyz With Fun (Japanese Ver.)\n\n8. ペップセ Baepsae (Japanese Ver.)\n\n9. Wishing On a Star\n\n10. Butterfly (Japanese Ver.)\n\n11. FOR YOU\n\n12. I NEED U (Japanese Ver.)\n\n13. EPILOGUE : Young Forever (Japanese Ver.)\n\nSadly, Youth did not see any music videos made for the new Japanese versions of the songs included on the album.\n\n‘WINGS’\n\nRelease Date: October 10, 2016\n\nVersions: W, I, N, G\n\nWINGS Tracklist:\n\n1. Intro: Boy Meets Evil\n\n2. Blood Sweat & Tears\n\n3. Begin\n\n4. Lie\n\n5. Stigma\n\n6. First Love\n\n7. Reflection\n\n8. MAMA\n\n9. Awake\n\n10. Lost\n\n11. BTS Cypher 4\n\n12. Am I Wrong\n\n13. 21st Century Girl 21세기 소녀\n\n14. Two! Three! (Hoping for Better Days) 둘! 셋! (그래도 좋은 날이 더 많기를)\n\n15. Interlude: Wings\n\nThe lyrics for “Blood Sweat & Tears” were inspired by Demian by author Hermann Hesse.\n\nRM explained the meaning behind the song, saying, “The harder a temptation is to resist, the more you think about it and vacillate. That uncertainty is part of the process of growing. [Blood Sweat & Tears] is a song that shows how one thinks, chooses, and grows.”\n\nSuga also explained that, “The song relays an optimistic determination to use our wings to go far, even if we are met with temptations in life.”\n\nWith lyrics that start out by saying “You worth it you perfect, Deserve it just work it” the song “21st Century Girl” aims to help encourage women.\n\nIt’s pretty much a feminist anthem to inspire women to feel more comfortable in their own skin and ignore the pressure of society to be perfect.\n\n‘You Never Walk Alone’\n\nRelease Date: February 13, 2017\n\nVersions: Left and Right\n\nYou Never Walk Alone Tracklist:\n\n1.

A Supplementary Story: You Never Walk Alone\n\n“Spring Day” was written by RM and Suga about their experiences of missing someone close to them, while using the metaphor of the seasons to discuss how things always get better, much like spring after a long winter.\n\nThe song also draws inspiration from the novel The One Who Walks Away from Omelas, which is also referenced in the music video.\n\nMany fans also believe that the lyrics of the song were inspired by the tragedy of the sinking of the MV Sewol. BTS and Big Hit Entertainment donated 100 million won (approximately $85,000) to the Sewol Ferry Disaster 416 Family Council, though there has been no official confirmation from the band that the song is related to the tragedy.\n\n“Not Today” revisits the band’s anti-establishment theme from prior songs, and urges underdogs to continue fighting.\n\nRM helped write the lyrics for this song as well, and the music video features the group dealing with masked assailants.\n\n‘血、汗、涙 Blood Sweat & Tears’\n\n(Japanese Album)\n\nRelease Date: May 10, 2017\n\nVersions: Regular, A, B, C,\n\n血、汗、涙 Blood Sweat & Tears Tracklist:\n\n1. 血、汗、涙 (Japanese Ver.)\n\n2.

I wanted to share this moment.”\n\n“DNA” became a historic song for BTS, helping them start to take over mainstream America’s hearts. The group made their U.S. TV debut at the 2017 American Music Awards with a performance of “DNA.”\n\nRM also spoke about the meaning of the song. “When we’re talking about our title tracks, ‘DNA’ is about the expression of a young, passionate love. The lyrics are like, ‘The two of us are connected fatefully from the start, our DNA was just the one thing.’ At the same time, ‘DNA’ is taking BTS to new ground. We tried to apply new grammar and perspectives.”\n\n‘MIC DROP / DNA / CRYSTAL SNOW’\n\n(Japanese album)\n\nRelease Date: December 6, 2017\n\nVersions: Regular, A, B, C\n\nMIC DROP / DNA / CRYSTAL SNOW Tracklist:\n\n1.

The song has a distinctive R&B vibe to it, fueled by singer V’s (Kim Taehyung) soulful voice.\n\nThe lyrics are poetic in nature as the song details a person who feels as though they have lost themselves for another person.\n\n“Fake Love” was said to be a very difficult song for the group to work on in their album preview V Live. The members revealed that they worked on the melody over and over again, trying to get it just right.\n\nIn an interview, RM also revealed more of the meaning behind the song. “We’re saying that if you’re not true to yourself, your love won’t last forever. The love could be person to person, it could be between me and myself.”\n\n‘Love Yourself: 結 Answer’\n\nRelease Date: August 24, 2018\n\nVersions: S,E,L,F\n\nLove Yourself: 結 Answer Tracklist:\n\nCD A\n\n1.

This is what we want to say: You can call me artist. You can call me idol. No matter what you call me, I don’t care. It’s me.”\n\nHe also added, “You don’t need an explanation to say I’m me. It would be sad if we have to. I sing this song to love myself. No matter what I look like, I’m me.”\n\n“MIC Drop” was actually inspired by former U.S. president Barack Obama.\n\nRM explained, “The track after that is ‘Mic Drop,’ and it was inspired by former president Obama’s speech. His mic drop was something that expressed, ‘Wasn’t my speech dope?‘ In that way, our song ‘Mic Drop’ is a track that expresses our swag, hopes, and confidence.”\n\nRM also explained in V Live that originally the lyrics for the song were really angry, but they were later reworked by J-Hope in a way that the group felt fit them a lot better.\n\n‘FAKE LOVE/Airplane Pt.2’\n\n(Japanese Album)\n\nRelease Date: November 7, 2018.\n\nVersions: Regular, A, B, C, Fanclub\n\nFAKE LOVE/Airplane Pt.2 Tracklist:\n\n1. FAKE LOVE (Japanese Ver.)\n\n2. Airplane Pt.2 (Japanese Ver.)\n\n3. IDOL (Stadium Remix)\n\n4. FAKE LOVE (Japanese Ver.) (Remix)\n\n“Airplane Pt. 2” is actually a follow up to the song “Airplane” on J-Hope’s mixtape Hope World. In an interview, J-Hope said that Bang PD praised “Airplane” for being authentic to BTS’ themes, so he continued to work on it.\n\nFrom there, he became inspired to write a second part to the song, which was included on Love Yourself: Tear, and then the group recorded a Japanese version and music video for the FAKE LOVE/Airplane Pt.2 Japanese album.\n\n‘Map of the Soul: Persona’\n\nRelease date: April 12, 2019\n\nVersions: 01,02,03,04\n\nMap of the Soul: Persona Tracklist:\n\n1.

Dionysus\n\nNamjoon explained in his V Live for the album that “Persona” is all about his identity as RM, “For me, persona is the social self. It represents our social mask. A mask could be either good or bad. It is what we present to the outside world as we lead our social and economic life. My persona would be RM then, right?”\n\nHe also explained that they wanted to call back to the start of their journey, “When I spoke with PD Bang I told him that we wanted to go back to the start, that we can’t deal with these things around us. That things were getting too big for us to handle. That we’d like to focus on the smaller things. So we looked into ourselves.”\n\n“작은 것들을 위한 시 (Boy With Luv)” feat Halsey is the single for Map of the Soul: Persona and acts as a more mature response to BTS’ single “Boy In Luv.”\n\nRM admitted that he worried that some people wouldn’t understand the meaning of the lyrics by the title of the song. “I thought some might think it’s meaningless. Because people don’t go deep into something till they like it,” he explained.\n\nThe song is more about appreciating the small things in life and was written with their fans in mind. Namjoon revealed, “It was really hard to write Korean lyrics to this melody. Only ARMY can understand what these mean.’Listen my my baby I’m flying high in the sky. With the two wings you gave me back then,’ I mention these wings constantly.”\n\n‘BTS World Original Soundtrack’\n\nRelease Date: June 28, 2019\n\nVersions: N/A\n\nFour original songs were released from BTS and collaborators on the original soundtrack for their mobile game BTS World.

Instead of hiding from their fears though, they face them head-on on in the song.\n\n“ON” was the lead single from Map of the Soul: 7 and the song is a reflection on the groups calling and their mindset through the past seven years together.\n\n‘Map Of The Soul 7: The Journey’\n\n(Japanese Album)\n\nRelease date: July 14, 2020\n\nVersions: Regular, Type A, Type B, Type C, Type D\n\nMap Of The Soul 7: The Journey Tracklist:\n\n1.

Dynamite\n\nAccording to a press release about BE:\n\nBTS opens themselves up to express their mixed feelings about this situation—fear and anxiety mingled with the determination to overcome all this. The album contains the band’s emotions and ruminations they had throughout this year, and the story of “us” continuing the existential journey. That is also the reasoning behind the album’s title, BE, that stands for “to be” or “existence” and does not abide by any form.\n\nThe lead single “Life Goes On” belongs to the Alternative Hip Hop genre with sentimental acoustic guitar sounds captivating the ears of the listeners. The lyrics echo a comforting message that in the face of unexpected turns and abrupt disruption: “Life goes on”. Anyone who has been through 2020 can easily relate to this song delivered through BTS’ emotional voice.\n\n‘Film Out’\n\n(Japanese Digital Single)\n\nRelease date: April 2, 2021\n\nPrior to their upcoming Japanese Album BTS, THE BEST the group released the single “Film Out.” The song is also being used as the soundtrack song of the Japanese movie Signal The Movie.

BTS)\n\nIn an interview, RM discussed his mixtape and talked about the meaning behind “Do You.”\n\nRM said, “‘You Do You, I Do I’ is the catchphrase for this mixtape. What I want to say is that, ‘You do what you have to do, and I’ll do what I have to. But I’m like this. The thought of, ‘You’re you, and I’m me’ is the largest thing that’s been taking control of me lately.”\n\nRM described “농담 (Joke)” as being a song meant to show off his skills, “‘Joke’ is a song whose lyrics were written with a stream of consciousness. That’s why the title is called ‘Joke’ as well.\n\n“There’s nothing hidden behind the lyrics. It’s 500% for the auditory pleasure of rap songs. Since the other songs have messages or emotions placed into them, I felt that it was necessary to add in a refreshing song without any thoughts. I put in a lot of what I believe are rap ‘skills’.”\n\n‘Agust D’\n\nRelease Date: August 16, 2016\n\nAgust D tracklist:\n\n1. Intro; Dt sugA (Ft. DJ Friz)\n\n2. Agust D\n\n3. Give It To Me\n\n4.

SURAN)\n\n“Agust D” kicks off the mixtape with strong lyrics, which was the rappers’ goal.\n\nHe stated in an interview that the mixtape “has everything I wanted to do with hip-hop as the foundation. There are strong lyrics that will make people say, ‘Huh? He did this?’ and ‘Is it okay for him to write such lyrics?’ Anyway, I feel relieved since I was able to tell my stories.”\n\n“Give It To Me” is another track on the album that shoots down the haters the rappers of BTS had to deal with early on in their career, briefly touching on the doubts even his own family had before moving on to discuss the cutthroat entertainment industry.\n\nSpeaking about the mixtape, Suga also stated, “I wanted to reveal my honest thoughts about youth. I wanted to express myself transparently with the purpose of doing everything I wanted to do.”\n\nFun fact: Suga did a Maschine mk2 review on BangtanTV and wrote a beat in the process, which he later incorporated into the song “The Last” on Agust D.\n\n‘Hope World’\n\nRelease Date: March 2, 2018\n\nHope World tracklist:\n\n1.

Blue Side (Outro)\n\nOn a V Live to discuss the mixtape, J-Hope revealed the meaning behind “Daydream (백일몽)” and his other songs.\n\nHe said, “‘Daydream’ is a dream that you have in the day. And dreams are mostly impossible to achieve. But this song talks about how I want to dream about the impossible.”\n\n“J-Hope is a person that is known to the public, and a public figure. And with that title, there comes responsibilities and burdens. I understand those aspects of this position, but it’s only natural that Jung Hoseok as a person has his own needs as a human being. This song is about those desires.”\n\nJ-Hope also revealed that he wrote the track for “Airplane” while they were on tour in Chicago, then later wrote the lyrics while they were flying. “When I was a little boy, my wish was to be on an airplane. My wish was to get on a plane and fly in the sky. Here it is. ‘Now I fly all I want, on the airplane.’ It reminded me of old memories,” he said.\n\n“I used to dream of it. And now…I remember I was sitting in a very nice seat on the plane. I was listening to the instrumental version of this song, looking at the night sky. The lyrics just popped into my head. I thought, ‘This is what being inspired feels like.'”\n\n‘Mono.’\n\nRelease Date: October 23, 2018\n\nMono. tracklist:\n\n1. Tokyo\n\n2. Seoul\n\n3. Moonchild\n\n4.

Forever Rain\n\nIn a V Live about Mono., RM revealed that he always wanted to write a song about the rain and that was what inspired “Forever Rain.”\n\nRM stated, “When I thought about the word ‘Forever Rain’ I heard the sound of piano in my ears. I was into producing back then. I wanted to produce the entire song, including the beat and everything.”\n\n“I used the word ‘forever’ because I wonder if I can make a song that touches my heart again. After I die, I would like this song to be played at my funeral. There’s no more song that’s so like me than this. I have a strong emotional attachment.”\n\nRM also revealed that he wrote “Moon Child” before he wrote “4 o’clock.”\n\n“People who prefer the night. At night… Well, it probably reminds you of ‘4 o’clock.’ During the day, feeling choked, whether it’s because of the job or something. Then at night, getting away from other’s eyes, and getting away from the shackles,” RM explained, discussing the inspiration behind the track.\n\n“People who feel a sense of freedom. I think there will be lots of people like that. Especially people these days. People like me. These days, I don’t like the night that much. I also like the day, but the night…I made this song, when I thought the night liberated me.”\n\n‘D-2’\n\nRelease Date: May 22, 2020\n\nD-2 tracklist:\n\n1. Moonlight\n\n2. Daechwita\n\n3.

Kim Jong Wan)\n\n“Daechwita” serves as the title track for D-2, which is Agust D’s (also known as Suga) second mixtape. He stated that, ” D-2’s title track ‘Daechwita’ is more about the auditory enjoyment than the lyrics so I’d say you should focus more on the visual and auditory layers. I chose this as the title track because I thought it’d be fun.”"
