        "text": "A new album comprised of never-before-heard tracks written by Johnny Cash will be released on June 28, aptly titled \"Songwriter.\"\n\nThe country music icon died in 2003 at age 71 in Nashville.\n\nThe new album, coming out posthumously via Mercury Nashville and UMe, is an 11-track record that showcases Cash's ability to capture the human condition in song. He writes about sorrow, beauty, spirituality and redemption and sings in his signature style.\n\nThe album was announced on Tuesday morning with the release of its first single “Well Alright,” a song that features an upbeat rhythm and thumping upright bass as Cash sings about finding love in a laundromat.\n\nThe new-to-us album \"Songwriter\" brings with it a rich story of history and legacy.\n\nHere's everything you need to know.\n\nWho is producing the new Johnny Cash album?\n\nMusician and producer John Carter Cash, the son of Johnny and June Carter Cash, co-produced the album alongside David “Fergie” Ferguson.\n\nAbout thirty years after Cash recorded the album in 1993, Carter Cash and Ferguson decided to strip the songs back to Cash's vocals and acoustic guitar and re-produce them with new musical overlays.\n\n“It’s not about selling Johnny Cash, he would be doing that himself,” John Carter Cash said in a press release.\n\n“I'm grateful that this record is here, even if it was only for me, because it reminds me of who my father was, and I do believe there are people out there that knew him on somewhat of a level that I did, that will be just as touched,” said Carter Cash.\n\n“But I also believe that there are people out there that have never heard my father's music that will find new interest in hearing this, hearing this album and hearing my father's voice,\" he said.\n\nWhat musicians are featured on Johnny Cash's \"Songwriter?\"\n\nJohn Carter Cash and David Ferguson hand-picked musicians that played with Johnny Cash back in the day to be featured on the new album.\n\nGuitarist Marty Stuart, the late bassist Dave Roe and drummer Pete Abbott went out to the Cash Cabin—Johnny Cash's writing and recording space—in Hendersonville, TN to work on breathing life back into the old tracks.\n\nThe songs also feature some other familiar names.\n\nThe Black Keys' Dan Auerbach plays a guitar solo on song “Spotlight.” Vince Gill sings on track “Poor Valley Girl.”\n\nWaylon Jennings, a close friend of Cash's, sang on two of the original recordings of songs “I Love You Tonite” and “Like A Soldier.”\n\nWhen did Johnny Cash write the songs on the new album?\n\nCash wrote and recorded the 11 unreleased songs in early 1993.\n\nHe was in between contracts and about 40 years into his career at the time. He recorded the demos at LSI Studios in Nashville.\n\nThe studio was then owned by Cash's son-in-law Mike Daniels and daughter Rosey. He decided to record the tunes at the studio to help bolster his family financially.\n\nAfter recording the songs, Johnny met producer Rick Rubin. The two then focused on their musical partnership and subsequently shelved the recently recorded demo.\n\nWhere will Johnny Cash's new album be available?\n\nFans can stream and download \"Songwriter;\" it is also available for pre-order.\n\nThe album will also be available on CD and vinyl.\n\nWhat is the track list for Johnny Cash's \"Songwriter\"?"
