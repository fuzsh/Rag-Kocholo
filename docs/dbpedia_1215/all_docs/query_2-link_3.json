        "text": "Nevertheless (stylized in all lowercase) is the tenth studio album and sixteenth studio album overall by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on October 3, 2025, through Republic Records.\n\nIt is her first studio album succeeding the final re-recorded album Reputation (Taylor's Version) (2024), following the dispute between Swift and the changed ownership of the masters to her first six studio albums.\n\nBackground[]\n\nSwift began writing songs in 2021, shortly after the release of Evermore, and throughout her Taylor's Version projects. She began recording her vocals for the songs in September 2023, beginning with \"Height of the Storm\".[1] She finished recording the songs from the album in March of 2025, by which time she had finalized the track list.[2] The album cover was shot in April 2025 by Jimmy Fontaine.[3] She posted minor song teasers and references throughout 2022-2025.\n\nFrom October 2024 to March 2025, on the 13th days, Swift posted snippets of multiple songs on her Instagram story. These included \"Humanity's God Complex\", \"Reckless Behavior\", \"Shiver\", \"Sigh of Relief\" and \"Sun's Glory\". After this, Swift stayed silent on social media, before abruptly announcing the album pre-sale along with the lead single, \"Humanity's God Complex\" on June 12, to be released the next day. The music video was premiered at 2:00 PM EST. Prior to the premier of the music video, Swift sent a message in the pre-premiere chat stating: \"where did humanity's god complex come from? nevertheless,\" with the intention of cutting the message off. Once fans pre-ordered the album, a message would pop up: \"10*3\". Rumours began circling that it would be released on October 3, and that when combining the numbers, it would make Swift's signature number 13.\n\nSwift released two promotional singles prior to the announcement of the album, \"Sun's Glory\" and \"Silver Lining\" which were released on July 25 and August 8, respectively, and each received a lyric video. An hour before \"Sun's Glory\" was released, Swift took to social media to post the album cover, which was also used for both of the promotional singles' artwork. An hour before \"Silver Lining\" was released, Swift revealed that another music video was coming, on her Instagram story, and to \"wait for September\".\n\nStarting on September 1 to 12, Swift began posting randomized letters from the album name on Instagram, in the order: N, T, E, L, E, V, E, S, R, S, H, E. On September 13, she posted a comma, alluding to her initial message on the \"Humanity's God Complex\" music video chat (\"nevertheless,\"), with the caption \"nevertheless\".\n\nSingles[]\n\nThe lead single, \"Humanity's God Complex\", was released on June 13, 2025, along with the album pre-sale. A music video was released the same day.\n\nThe second single, \"Odd One Out\", was released on October 3, 2025, coinciding with the album release. A music video was released the same day.\n\nThe third single, \"Height of the Storm\", was released on December 19, 2025, along with a music video.\n\nThe fourth single, \"Reckless Behaviour\", was released on April 3, 2026, due to high demand. A music video was released on April 10, 2026.\n\nPromotional singles[]\n\nThe first promotional single, \"Sun's Glory\", was released on July 25, 2025, along with a lyric video.\n\nThe second promotional single, \"Silver Lining\", was released on August 8, 2025, along with a lyric video.\n\nTrack listing[]\n\nStandard editionNo.TitleWriter(s)Producer(s)Length1.\"Touch and Go\"Taylor Swift, Rick NowelsSwift, Nowels2.\"What Goes Around\" (featuring Olivia Rodrigo)Swift, Rodrigo, Jack AntonoffSwift, Antonoff3.\"Shiver\"Swift, AntonoffSwift, Antonoff4.\"Reckless Behavior\"Swift, Aaron DessnerSwift, Dessner5.\"Humanity's God Complex\"SwiftSwift, Antonoff6.\"Say Goodnight\"Swift, Joe Alwyn, AntonoffSwift, Antonoff7.\"Height of the Storm\"Swift, NowelsSwift, Nowels8.\"Odd One Out\"Swift, NowelsSwift, Nowels9.\"Convincing Liars\"Swift, AntonoffSwift, Antonoff10.\"Unrequited Truth\"Swift, Antonoff, Joel LittleSwift, Antonoff, Little11.\"Belong\"Swift, Dessner, LittleSwift, Dessner, Little12.\"Black Forest\" (featuring Phoebe Bridgers)Swift, Bridgers, Dessner, NowelsSwift, Dessner, Nowels13.\"Hourglass Fragility\"Swift, DessnerSwift, Dessner14.\"Sun's Glory\"Swift, LittleSwift, Little15.\"Devil's Advocate\"SwiftSwift, Dessner16.\"Silver Lining\"Swift, Dessner, AlwynSwift, DessnerTotal length:tba\n\nDeluxe EditionNo.TitleWriter(s)Producer(s)Length17.\"Slip Past\"Swift, NowelsSwift, Nowels18.\"I'd Remember You Anywhere\" (featuring Mitski)Swift, Miyawaki, AntonoffSwift, Antonoff19.\"For the Longest Time\"Swift, DessnerSwift, DessnerTotal length:tba\n\nDecember 2025 Re-Release EditionNo.TitleWriter(s)Producer(s)Length20.\"Humanity's God Complex\" (acoustic version)SwiftChristopher Rowe21.\"Silver Lining\" (acoustic version)Swift, Dessner, AlwynRowe22.\"Odd One Out\" (Christmas mix)Swift, NowelsSwift, NowelsTotal length:tba\n\nNotes[]\n\nAll tracks are stylized in lowercase.\n\nOuttakes[]\n\n\"A Separate Chapter\"\n\n\"Background Noise\" (featuring Arctic Monkeys) (deluxe outtake)\n\n\"Gracious\"\n\n\"How Does Everything Go Back to You?\"\n\n\"Infamous\" (deluxe outtake)\n\n\"Jeopardize\" (deluxe outtake)\n\n\"Mark My Words\"\n\n\"Nevertheless\" (performed live)\n\n\"Numb\" (performed live)\n\n\"Take My Leave\"\n\n\"The Devil Can Be Beautiful\"\n\n\"Under Your Wing\" (featuring Noah Cyrus)\n\nReferences[]\n\nNavigation[]\n\nTemplate:Nevertheless"
