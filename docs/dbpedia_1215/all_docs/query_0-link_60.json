        "text": "PartyNextDoor is set to drop his upcoming album in the new year.\n\nOn Sunday night (Nov. 24), the Canadian singer-songwriter jumped on his Twitter timeline to confirm the news fans have been waiting for all year.\n\n\"Album in January,\" PND tweeted.\n\nThe news comes shortly after Party dropped off two new songs \"The News\" and \"Loyal\" featuring Drake. On the banger produced by 40 and OG Parker, PND croons about his dedication and loyalty while Drizzy follows up with his smooth vocals.\n\n\"All the way 'round, I'm loyal/I got money on me and I'm loyal,\" Party sings on the club cut. \"I got money in my pocket, I'm loyal, ooh/Pain goes away when I'm tipsy/Pain goes away when you're with me (Me)/Even when your troubles all look risky/It's all under control.\"\n\nPND hasn't dropped a project since his Seven Days EP back in September 2017. Although he collaborated with Future for the Superfly soundtrack last year, fans have been waiting over two years for a new project from the singer.\n\nBack in April, one of PND's producers from Canada gave fans hope when he confirmed that new music was on the way. Then, during 2019 OVO Fest, PND's label boss Drake gave the audience an update on the singer's plans for new music while on stage.\n\n\"PartyNextDoorâ€”new PND on the way!\" Drake told the crowd.\n\nAs of this report, there is no confirmation on which day in January PND's album will drop. Keep it locked for the next update."
