        "text": "Johan Renck is one of the most respected and sought after directors of commercials and music videos today, so much so that the French magazine CB News dubbed him \"the number one director of commercials and music videos in the world\".\n\nHis directing career started in 1992 when he joined the production company Mekano Film and Television in Stockholm, Sweden. In 1994 he left Mekano to join forces with childhood friend director Jonas Åkerlund. They established a new production company, Renck Åkerlund Films, which immediately became one of the leaders of its kind in Sweden. During the same time he worked with his music project, Stakka Bo, with big success and a lot of his time was occupied by the music career. In 1997 he started to work as a director full time and quickly became a well-known name worldwide and in 1999 he was working with Madonna and Nike among others.\n\nJohan has worked non-stop all over the world and continues to work with many well known brands such as; Nike, Levi's, Mercedes, Dom Perignon, and H&M and artists like Kylie Minogue, New Order, Madonna, The Libertines and The Streets to mention a few. He has achieved prestigious nominations and awards for his work, such as MTV award nominations to his music videos to Madonna and Beyoncé and two Cannes Bronze Lions for the Nike commercial \"Racing Marion\". In 2005 he won an award for best video in MVPA and was nominated in several categories in CAD for his music video for The Streets. In Cannes he collected a Bronze Lion for the commercial Sagem and a Silver Lion for his campaign for \"Karl Lagerfeld for H&M\", this film also awarded Grand Prix in Eurobest and a Gold in Epica. In 2006, again he had several MVPA nominations, this time for his videos for Madonna: Hung Up (2005) and for Robbie Williams: Tripping (2005). In The Gunn Report Johan Renck was listed as the 25th most rewarded director of commercials. In 2007 Johans short film 'Cow', for SOS Live Earth, was nominated in Eurobest and in Epica Awards where it won the Bronze price.\n\nJohan works within a variety of different media; films, commercials, music videos, theatre productions, art and music projects and still photography. He shoots stills for magazines like Italian Vogue and brands such as Diesel just to mention a few. Johan finished his feature film Downloading Nancy (2008), starring Maria Bello, Jason Patric, Rufus Sewell, and Amy Brenneman among others. The film has its world premiere in the 2008 Sundance Festival where it also competed in the Dramatic Competition picked out of thousands of submissions.\n\nJohan is based in Stockholm where he runs RAF. In the US and in England he is represented by high profile production company RSA/Black Dog, in France by Soixante Quinze. He is also highly respected by David Unger at ICM for feature film projects.\n\nAnderson was born in 1970. He was one of the first of the \"video store\" generation of film-makers. His father was the first man on his block to own a V.C.R., and from a very early age Anderson had an infinite number of titles available to him. While film-makers like Spielberg cut their teeth making 8 mm films, Anderson cut his teeth shooting films on video and editing them from V.C.R. to V.C.R.\n\nPart of Anderson's artistic D.N.A. comes from his father, who hosted a late night horror show in Cleveland. His father knew a number of oddball celebrities such as Robert Ridgely, an actor who often appeared in Mel Brooks' films and would later play \"The Colonel\" in Anderson's Boogie Nights (1997). Anderson was also very much shaped by growing up in \"The Valley\", specifically the suburban San Fernando Valley of greater Los Angeles. The Valley may have been immortalized in the 1980s for its mall-hopping \"Valley Girls\", but for Anderson it was a slightly seedy part of suburban America. You were close to Hollywood, yet you weren't there. Would-bes and burn-outs populated the area. Anderson's experiences growing up in \"The Valley\" have no doubt shaped his artistic self, especially since three of his four theatrical features are set in the Valley.\n\nAnderson got into film-making at a young age. His most significant amateur film was The Dirk Diggler Story (1988), a sort of mock-documentary a la Die Jungs von Spinal Tap (1984), about a once-great pornography star named Dirk Diggler. After enrolling in N.Y.U.'s film program for two days, Anderson got his tuition back and made his own short film, Cigarettes & Coffee (1993). He also worked as a production assistant on numerous commercials and music videos before he got the chance to make his first feature, something he liked to call Sydney, but would later become known to the public as Last Exit Reno (1996). The film was developed and financed through The Sundance Lab, not unlike Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs - Wilde Hunde (1992). Anderson cast three actors whom he would continue working with in the future: Altman veteran Philip Baker Hall, the husky and lovable John C. Reilly and, in a small part, Philip Seymour Hoffman, who so far has been featured in all four of Anderson's films. The film deals with a guardian angel type (played by Hall) who takes down-on-his-luck Reilly under his wing. The deliberately paced film featured a number of Anderson trademarks: wonderful use of source light, long takes and top-notch acting. Yet the film was reedited (and retitled) by Rysher Entertainment against Anderson's wishes. It was admired by critics, but didn't catch on at the box office. Still, it was enough for Anderson to eventually get his next movie financed. \"Boogie Nights\" was, in a sense, a remake of \"The Dirk Diggler Story\", but Anderson threw away the satirical approach and instead painted a broad canvas about a makeshift family of pornographers. The film was often joyous in its look at the 1970s and the days when pornography was still shot on film, still shown in theatres, and its actors could at least delude themselves into believing that they were movie stars. Yet \"Boogie Nights\" did not flinch at the dark side, showing a murder and suicide, literally in one (almost) uninterrupted shot, and also showing the lives of these people deteriorate, while also showing how their lives recovered.\n\nAnderson not only worked with Hall, Reilly and Hoffman again, he also worked with Julianne Moore, Melora Walters, William H. Macy and Luis Guzmán. Collectively, Anderson had something that was rare in U.S. cinema: a stock company of top-notch actors. Aside from the above mentioned, Anderson also drew terrific performances from Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg, two actors whose careers were not exactly going full-blast at the time of \"Boogie Nights\", but who found themselves to be that much more employable afterwards.\n\nThe success of \"Boogie Nights\" gave Anderson the chance to really go for broke in Magnolia (1999), a massive mosaic that could dwarf Altman's Nashville (1975) in its number of characters.\n\nAnderson was awarded a \"Best Director\" award at Cannes for Punch-Drunk Love (2002)."
