        "text": "On Thursday night, Los Angeles rap kingmaker Dr. Dre unveils his first album in 16 years. Called “Compton,” the 16-track record is inspired by the highly anticipated N.W.A movie “Straight Outta Compton,” which hits theaters Aug. 14. Fans will first get a chance to hear the album via Apple Music from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., when it streams in its entirety before being released to the public soon thereafter.\n\nThe multi-platinum artist, producer, label chief and Beats Music co-founder Dr. Dre is responsible for one of the most influential sounds to ever roll out of Southern California. Just as important is his skill as a talent scout. Over the years he helped bring to the public artists including Snoop Dogg, 2Pac, Eminem, 50 Cent and the Game.\n\nNeedless to say, enthusiasm for the album is high. That’s especially true considering that on the production front he’s been relatively quiet over the last decade as he and Jimmy Iovine built the Beats empire. With the arrival of “Compton,” the rapper born Andre Young will issue his first major musical statement since 1999.\n\nSIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter >>\n\nIn the process, he will help introduce to the public a roster of upstarts including BJ the Chicago Kid, Anderson Paak and Jon Connor, and harness the proven power of Jill Scott, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem, Snoop Dogg and Xzibit -- to say nothing of actor and former N.W.A peer Ice Cube.\n\nBelow: a primer on the voices and producers that inhabit Dr. Dre’s new album.\n\nMarsha Ambrosius. British singer Ambrosius got her start with the neo-soul group Floetry, signed as a solo artist to Dr. Dre’s Aftermath imprint in the late ‘00s, left the label a few years later and released her most recent album, “Friends & Lovers,” last year. The artist is better known for her searing vocal hooks on tracks by Nas, Jamie Foxx, Wale, Tyga, the Game and many others. Ambrosius appears on four “Compton” tracks: “Genocide,” “All in a Day’s Work,” “Darkside/Gone” and “Satisfaction.”\n\nBJ the Chicago Kid.
