        "text": "There's a lot of existential stuff in these songs, says Amos Lee. If you really listen to what's in between the lines, there's a lot of grappling with your place in the world, grappling with loss. There's a lot of grappling with the balance between bailing out the boat and rowing at the same timethe experience of writing music and playing songs while trying, as we all are right now, to make sense of a world that feels like it's changing really quickly. On his eleventh studio album, Transmissions, singer-songwriter Lee continues to expand his sonic range while sharpening his closely observed lyrics that squarely address death, aging, and love. The force behind such acclaimed albums as Mission Bell and Mountains of Sorrow, Rivers of Song, ever since his gold-selling 2005 debut Lee has been known for his association with a long list of collaborators and touring partners, from Paul Simon to Zac Brown Band. For the new project, he craved a return to an old-school style of recording, working with his longtime band in a studio in rural Marlboro, New York that was built by drummer Lee Falco and his dad out of reclaimed wood from an old church (its exactly what youd think a studio in upstate New York should be, notes Lee). Playing live on the floor for long hours, in close quarters, they were able to capture the albums twelve songs in less than a week. I really wanted us to be all in the room, making music together, listening to each other and responding to each other, says Lee. In this age where you can do everything at home and fly it in, theres something really beautiful about getting in a room and starting at the top, the drummer counting in the song and everybody just playing. I would call it vulnerability.\n\nIndie Exclusive - Lee Mendelson Film Productions (LMFP) is thrilled to announce the release - from recently rediscovered tapes - the complete Vince Guaraldi soundtrack to \"It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown,\" the timeless 6th animated Peanuts® special, from writer and creator Charles Schulz, director Bill Melendez and producers Melendez and Lee Mendelson. Originally the special aired on September 27, 1969 on CBS-TV.\n\nThe album includes the original recordings that comprise the cues from the Special across twenty-six tracks, plus another 6 alternative tracks that have never been released or heard before.\n\nGuaraldi lovingly created the soundtrack for the summer camp adventure where Charlie Brown and his gang face off against the girls camp lead by Peppermint Patty. The large jazz combo album also includes the best rendition of Guaraldi classic, \"Love Will Come (Nova Bossa)\" as well as the first use of additional percussion in Victor Feldman.\n\nThe recording features Guaraldi (piano), Monty Budwig (double bass), Jack Sperling (drums), Conti and Pete Candoli (trumpet), Frank Rosolino (trombone), Victor Feldman (percussion), Herb Ellis (guitar), Willian Hood and Peter Christlieb (woodwind), and John Scott Trotter as the orchestra leader. The soundtrack was produced by Sean and Jason Mendelson and restored and re-mastered by Vinson Hudson.\n\nThe album comes with liner notes that give a track-by-track analysis by Derrick Bang (author of \"Vince Guaraldi at the Piano\") and notes from Sean and Jason Mendelson, sons of Peanuts® producer Lee Mendelson. The album packaging also includes images from the special and images of historical documents from the found tapes.\n\nWe began writing this record on New Years Day 2023. With that sentiment we felt like it was destined to be a totally new experience and we truly put our best feet forward. Since MILLY began, it was pretty much just myself writing everything but with this record it was much different. We solidified our lineup and we worked as hard as we could together, meeting 2 - 3 times a week for 6 months and playing music as a band because we wanted the record to have that feel. It sounds silly saying it that way as we are a rock band, but we had never spent more than a week or two actually preparing in a room before recording in the past. Everything previously was done very on the fly whereas this record we tried as many things as we coul d and used our heads. We talked about music a lot, and the way we wanted people to feel when they heard our new stuff -- the way that we feel when we listen to our favorites. We kept pondering if we could reinvent the wheel for ourselves in some way, even if minor.. just to feel a bit different and fresh. A large majority of the songs originated from jams that we recorded in our practice space and then I took home and chopped up. Once Sonny got involved, he really helped us structure everything all together nicely. We took rehearsing and pre production extremely seriously the way Nirvana did before tracking Nevermind and we are very proud of the raw live feeling that this album has. Though we are now a 4 piece band, for this process it was the 3 of us (Brend an, Yarden, Conner) so a lot of trios were in the back of our heads for inspiration (Failure, Nirvana, Dinosaur Jr), especially in the guitar category. It felt like picking a guitar up for the first time in some ways, trying to reinvent my regular playing style as much as I could.\n\nLet us advance our mortal bodies up\n\nWhere hearts and minds will go\n\nLets walk, lets roll.\n\nSo sings Madeleine Peyroux on the upbeat title track of her captivating tenth album, Lets Walk, the acclaimed singer-songwriters most assured, courageous work to date. Powered by the distinctive, honeyed croon that delivered her from the Paris streets to concert halls, these ten unabashedly personal songs, all co-written by the versatile Peyroux, deftly interweave jazz, folk, and chamber pop, with themes ranging from the confessional to the political, from whimsy to yearning. In every note, Peyroux digs deep, rendering this exquisite work with the disarming grace and gravitas of an artist in peak form.\n\nLets Walk was a long time coming, but well worth the wait. Following Peyrouxs 2018 album, Anthem, the enforced isolation of the global pandemic made any real-time community gathering impossible. From a creative standpoint, however, Covid offered Peyroux a silver lining: she seized the opportunity to hunker down with longtime collaborator, multi-instrumentalist Jon Herington (Steely Dan, Lucy Kaplansky). The pair reflected on the seismic era at hand and wrote and re-wrote in what Peyroux calls a shadow of reckoning. When multi-Emmy-and-Grammy-winning producer Elliott Scheiner (Fleetwood Mac, The Eagles) heard a sampling of the new material, including Lets Walk, he mandated no covers for the album. The longtime studio veteran knew the time was ripe to highlight Peyrouxs incisive, often topical lyrics meshed with Heringtons ear for melody and arrangements.\n\nAlbum opener Find True Love came to Peyroux during the George Floyd murder trial. Like Lets Walk, Find True Love is an irresistible entreaty to join a journey. First stop: New Orleans. I was searching for solace in the American landscape, Peyroux says. I was imagining the first step toward healing, if there could be a future worth living for. The last line of each verse is a striking, yet inarguable Cornel West quote: [One must] learn how to die. Heringtons pulsing, finger-picked acoustic guitar, interwoven with Andy Ezrins shimmering keys, propel Peyrouxs message of steadfast hope in the face of encroaching darkness. Says Peyroux: The ideas in this song let me imagine a place where I can become a better me.\n\nAn astonished Peyroux says the title track came to her in a dream  including the words, the rhythm, and the form  a rarity for her. The lyric refers to mass mobilization of marchers for civil rights around the world, Peyroux says. A voluntarily unified action in support of a humanitarian ideology. Within two days, Herington fleshed out Lets Walk with gospel textures, organ, and a steady, infectious beat, enlisting buoyant harmonies from Grammy-winning artist Catherine Russell (David Bowie, Rosanne Cash), along with vocalists supreme Cindy Mizelle (Bruce Springsteen) and Keith Fluitt (Patti LaBelle, Michael Jackson). Their churchy call-and-response with Peyrouxs burnished lead elevate Please Come On Inside and Blues for Heaven into a revival of emotion.\n\nHow I Wish is Peyrouxs response to the horrific murders  over a period of three months in 2020  of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmad Arbery. This melancholy, minor key waltz acknowledges her privilege, and her anguish. 2020 was the year I woke up, she says. Immersing herself in the work of such writers as Cornel West, she was struck by Wests repeated references to Black musicians as Love Warriors, responding to oppression with game-changing music: Nina Simone, Louis Armstrong, Marian Anderson, to name a few. These are my teachers and my heroes, Peyroux says. African American music has been the one constant, true path in my life.\n\nOne such mentor was Dan William Fitzgerald, aka Showman Dan, for whom Peyroux wrote a rollicking ode after her longtime friend passed away in 2017. As leader of the Lost Wandering Blues and Jazz Band, the American-born expat took a very young, inexperienced Peyroux under his wing to perform across Europe, as she says, on the street, in the underground, the public square, jazz clubs, restaurants, and private homes of dukes and duchesses. Like many Black artists before him, Fitzgerald found he could get more artistic traction in France than he could in his homeland and conveyed his love of street theater to Peyroux, whod moved with her mother to Paris at age 12.\n\nDuring her years in Paris, Peyroux witnessed the custom of bourgeois parents gifting their young adult children with an apartment. For the satirical Et Puis (And Then), Peyroux, fluent in French, assumes the role of that young adult as one both blissfully ignorant of their privilege and consciously disgusted by its injustice.\n\nFor Nothing Personal, Peyroux not only bravely grapples head-on with sexual assault  both her own, and others  she offers an alternative to incarceration, which she maintains is a ridiculous waste of time. Rather, the perpetrator should learn every aspect of the consequence of their actions and be party to recovery in whatever way is welcome by the victim. Heringtons mournful, insistent piano and acoustic guitar recall the intensity of Plastic Ono Band, with Peyrouxs painful-yet-resolved vocals intimate and beautifully unadorned.\n\nPeyroux changes gears with the playful, Caribbean-flavored Me and the Mosquito, and rapid-fire spoken-word album closer, Take Care. The former, inspired by Hank Williams hilarious classic Fly Trouble, offers perhaps the most humanist treatise ever on what Peyroux calls the elusive singular mosquito which can ruin a nights sleep. For the latter, Peyroux prayed to the spoken-word genius of Linton Kwesi Johnson to deliver a heartfelt advisory re: avoiding the pervasive toxins in food, clothing, and modern culture in general. I dont recommend a morose existence, she recites over Heringtons ska-flavored guitar and sampled marimba, but life is an art and perspective needs distance / But ya gotta get lean and scrappy and fight / If youre gonna begin to get livin right.\n\nWhen the road beckons this spring, Peyrouxs community of loyal fans is in for a singular treat. Thanks to serendipitous delay, her collaborators Herington and Scheiner, and the very perspective she shares in Take Care, the spare, slow burning Lets Walk material will be set free in venues around the world, effortlessly dovetailing with Peyrouxs beloved versions of Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, and Tom Waits (to name a few) classics. As she learned in her busking years, a great song can wield powerful magic, and inspire the best in any type of crowd. With Lets Walk, Madeleine Peyroux takes full ownership of that magic."
