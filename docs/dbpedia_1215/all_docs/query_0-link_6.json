        "text": "Mark Hoppus has confirmed that blink-182 are recording a new album.\n\nThis week, during one of his recent Animal Crossing livestreams while in lockdown, Hoppus was asked by a fan if there were any plans for blink to make new music.\n\n“I recorded literally yesterday so upcoming recording is already happening,” Hoppus replied.\n\nblink-182's last album, NINE, dropped in 2019. It debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, achieving first-week sales of 94,000 units.\n\nThe blink vocalist/bassist also confirmed that the material that has been recorded is solely for the pop-punk legends, and that work hasn't begun on new songs for Simple Creatures, the side-project he shares with All Time Low's Alex Gaskarth.\n\nIn addition to spilling the beans about new blink-182 music, Hoppus briefly addressed the subject of Tom DeLonge rejoining the band.\n\n\"I don't know,\" was Hoppus' answer when quizzed about the prospect of a reunion with DeLonge.\n\nTom DeLonge has been back in headlines himself in recent weeks, and not just for his musical endeavours.\n\nAs well as releasing a new Angels & Airwaves song, \"All That's Left is Love,\" DeLonge's work with his To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science has seen its profile raised thanks to the Pentagon officially releasing the UFO videos that DeLonge leaked last year.\n\nThe clips were released by the Pentagon “in order to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real, or whether or not there is more to the videos,” according to spokesperson Sue Gough.\n\n“After a thorough review,\" she continued. \"The department has determined that the authorized release of these unclassified videos does not reveal any sensitive capabilities or systems, and does not impinge on any subsequent investigations of military air space incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena.”\n\n55 Scene Albums That Went Platinum"
