        "text": "Childish Gambino is ready for his final act. Gambino delivered his grungy “Lithonia” single on Tuesday (July 2) and revealed the release date for Bando Stone & the New World, which will be his last under the moniker.\n\nCo-produced by Gambino himself alongside legends Max Martin, Ludwig Göransson and Michael Uzowuru, “Lithonia” hit streaming services on Tuesday (July 2).\n\n“Cody LaRae/ He had a break/ He’s findin’ out/ That nobody gives a f–k,” he raps following a dynamic church organ intro. LaRae could possibly be a character in Gambino’s Bando Stone & the New World movie. As far as the soundtrack, fans can expect the Bando Stone & the New World to arrive in full on July 19 via RCA Records.\n\nThe multi-hyphenate debuted the trailer for Bando Stone during his appearance at the 2024 BET Awards on Sunday (June 30). Gambino took part in the Usher tribute medley at the award show, which he kicked off with a smooth cover of the R&B icon’s 2002 anthem “U Don’t Have to Call.”\n\nChildish Gambino stars in and directed Bando Stone, and also helmed the soundtrack. In the dystopian trailer, his character is a washed-up pop star who finds himself fending off sci-fi monsters looking to take over Earth. He fights for his survival with his co-star companion, who is played by Jessica Allain.\n\nNYC fans are in luck, as Gambino has announced an interactive experience billed as Childish Gambino Live From Little Island, which will offer a first listen of his project. Tickets for the July 6 show go on sale starting on Wednesday (July 3) at 10 a.m. ET on Ticketmaster.\n\nHowever, fans across the globe will be able to get a live taste, as the “This Is America” rapper is bringing his show on the road this summer. The New World Tour will kick off in Oklahoma City on Aug. 11 with support from Willow. A 33-stop trek is on the horizon before wrapping up the North American leg in Chicago on Oct. 3.\n\nThe U.K. and the rest of Europe will have their chance to see Gambino live throughout the fourth quarter of 2024. Stops are slated for France, Germany, Netherlands, the U.K., Ireland and more. The Atlanta creator will also head to Australia for five dates in early 2025.\n\nListen to “Lithonia” and watch the Bando Stone & the New World trailer below."
