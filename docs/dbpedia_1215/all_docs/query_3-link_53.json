        "text": "Chauncey Alexander Hollis Jr. (born May 21, 1987), known professionally as Hit-Boy, is an American record producer, rapper, singer, and songwriter from Fontana, California. He first signed with fellow producer Polow da Don in 2007 as in-house production staff for his label Zone 4, and later signed with Kanye West's GOOD Music in 2011 to serve a similar role. He first gained major recognition for his work on Lil Wayne's 2011 single \"Drop the World\", which entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 18. The following year, he produced West and Jay-Z's 2011 single \"... in Paris\", which peaked at number five on the chart and received diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nThroughout the remaining decade, he received credits on the Billboard Hot 100-top 50 singles \"Trophies\" by Drake, \"Clique\" by GOOD Music, \"Sorry\" by Beyoncé, and his first to peak the chart: \"Sicko Mode\" by Travis Scott, among other commercially successful productions. He pursued a career as a recording artist while doing so, and signed with Interscope Records to release his debut studio album, We the Plug (2013) in collaboration with his HS87 collective. He guest appeared alongside Roddy Ricch on Nipsey Hussle's 2019 single Racks in the Middle\", which won Best Rap Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards. He has also released the collaborative extended play What You Expect (2021) with Michigan rapper Big Sean, helmed the entirety of the production of six albums by Nas—King's Disease (2020), King's Disease II (2021), Magic, King's Disease III (2022), Magic 2 and Magic 3 (2023)—and Burden of Proof (2020) by Benny the Butcher, each of which entered the Billboard 200.\n\nHis record label, Hits Since '87 was founded in 2011 also as an imprint of Interscope.\n\nCareer\n\n..... He received his first major production credit in tandem with the producer for the 2009 More than a Game documentary soundtrack, which was released by Polow's label Zone 4, to which he signed as an in-house producer. He co-produced the song \"Stronger\" by Mary J. Blige, which entered the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Hollins is also a founding member of the collective Surf Club, which he formed with fellow producers Chase N. Cashe, BCarr, and Chili Chill.\n\nWhile continuing to receive production credits with Zone 4, he became acquainted with rapper Kanye West and produced his 2010 GOOD Friday song, \"Christmas in Harlem\". On May 2, 2011, he signed to Kanye West's GOOD Music label as an in-house producer, allowing him to work directly with West and the label's further releases. .....\n\nOn June 7, 2012, Hollis released his first single as a recording artist, \"Jay-Z Interview\", which was produced by Bink!. Later in July 2012, Hollis was featured rapping on CyHi the Prynce's mixtape Ivy League Club, on the song \"Entourage\". Hollis then released the self-produced track \"Old School Caddy\", which features then-GOOD Music cohort Kid Cudi. These two tracks appeared on his first full-length project, a mixtape titled HITstory, which was released for free download on his website. Also in 2012, he produced three songs from his label GOOD Music's compilation album Cruel Summer, and produced ASAP Rocky's single \"Goldie\". On December 23, 2012, Hollis secured a solo recording contract with Interscope Records (the former parent label of Zone 4), under the record label Blueprint Group, along with the L.E.P. Bogus Boys. Soon after, he tweeted: \"2012 has been great to me and my fam. Feeling more blessed than ever. Excited to see what God has planned for 2013. TU.\" On January 23, 2013, his record label, Hits Since '87, became an imprint of Interscope. On June 29, 2013, parted ways with GOOD Music, but instated that he was still on good terms with West and his labelmates.\n\nHollins and Los Angeles rapper Dom Kennedy released the joint mixtape Half-A-Mil EP in December 2017, subsequently adopting the name as an alias for the duo. The mixtape consisted of five songs, and was led by the single \"100 Rounds\". It was followed by the sequel, Half-A-Mil 2 on February 24, 2017, and Half-A-Mil 3 followed thereafter in August 2017. The mixtape only had two features; from 24hrs on \"Don't Run\" and Quentin Miller on the tracks \"Might as Well\" and \"In The Hills\". Their debut collaborative album, Courtesy of Half-a-Mil was released in November of that year.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2022, Hollins teamed up with Nas to serve as executive producer on the King's Disease series—King's Disease, King's Disease II, and most recently King's Disease III—to close out 2022. King's Disease I and II were consecutively nominated for Grammy Award for Best Rap Album of the Year, with the former winning and awarding Nas with the artist’s first Grammy award throughout his storied career. They also collaborated on Nas's fifteenth studio album, Magic, in late 2022.\n\nIn 2023, Hollins worked on and released a multitude of projects, including beginning with his albums SURF OR DROWN in March, which featured guest appearances from Nas, The Alchemist, and Curren$y. Two months later, he followed up the album with its sequel, SURF OR DROWN Vol. 2, on Father's Day in June alongside his father, Big Hit, who appears on nine of the ten songs. In May 2023, Big Hit was released from prison after serving nine years and got right back to the studio to pick up where he left off. Before his incarceration in 2014, Big Hit had grown a fanbase following the release of the 2013 singles, \"Grindin' My Whole Life\" and \"G'z Don't Cry\", both produced by Hit-Boy. SURF OR DROWN Vol. 2 is a celebration of the reunification of the father son rap duo, and the continuation of Big Hit's career. Hollins executive produced Big Hit's debut solo album, The Truth Is In My Eyes (2023).\n\nHollins executive produced a number albums in 2023, including three Nas albums (King's Disease III, Magic 2, and Magic 3), Musiq Soulchild's Victims & Villains, and Benny the Butcher's album Everybody Can't Go (alongside the Alchemist), and Madden 2024 video game soundtrack. He worked on two songs from Don Toliver's third album Love Sick, as well as the song \"Delresto (Echoes)\" by Travis Scott and Beyoncé from Scott's Utopia.\n\nIn January 2024, Hollins produced and executive produced the project Paisley Dreams by the Game and Big Hit. The nine song album was made in one session, the first time the Game and Big Hit had met. Hollins also produced Jennifer Lopez's single \"Can't Get Enough\" alongside Rogét Chahayed for her eighth album, This Is Me...Now.\n\nMusical style\n\nProduction\n\nHit-Boy uses FL Studio and custom music plug-ins to make his beats.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHit-Boy is the nephew of Rodney Benford, from the R&B group Troop and son of rapper Big Hit. He grew up in Fontana, California.\n\nDiscography\n\nSee also: Hit-Boy production discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nList of albums, with selected chart positions Title Album details We the Plug\n\n(with HS87)\n\nReleased: May 27, 2014\n\nLabel: Hits Since '87, Interscope\n\nFormat: digital download, streaming\n\nCourtesy of Half-a-Mil\n\n(with Dom Kennedy)\n\nReleased: November 29, 2017\n\nLabel: The Other People's Money Company\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nFamily Not a Group\n\n(with SOB X RBE)\n\nReleased: April 16, 2019\n\nLabel: Def Jam\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nAlso Known As\n\n(with Dom Kennedy)\n\nReleased: July 31, 2020\n\nLabel: The Other People's Money Company\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nKing's Disease\n\n(with Nas)\n\nReleased: August 21, 2020\n\nLabel: Mass Appeal\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nBurden of Proof\n\n(with Benny the Butcher)\n\nReleased: October 16, 2020\n\nLabel: Griselda, Empire\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nKing's Disease II\n\n(with Nas)\n\nReleased: August 6, 2021\n\nLabel: Mass Appeal\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nMagic\n\n(with Nas)\n\nReleased: December 21, 2021\n\nLabel: Mass Appeal\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nBulletproof Soul\n\n(with Pacman da Gunman)\n\nReleased: March 31, 2022\n\nLabel: All Money In No Money Out, Playball Music, OTR\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nHitgirl\n\n(with Dreezy)\n\nReleased: May 20, 2022\n\nLabel: Dreezy Sound Inc., Empire\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nKing's Disease III\n\n(with Nas)\n\nReleased: November 11, 2022\n\nLabel: Mass Appeal\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nVictims & Villains\n\n(with Musiq Soulchild)\n\nReleased: March 10, 2023\n\nLabel: SoulStar Music Company\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nSurf or Drown\n\nReleased: March 24, 2023\n\nLabel: Surf Club Inc.\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nSurf or Drown, Vol. 2\n\nReleased: June 16, 2023\n\nLabel: Surf Club Inc.\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nMagic 2\n\n(with Nas)\n\nReleased: July 21, 2023\n\nLabel: Mass Appeal\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nMagic 3\n\n(with Nas)\n\nReleased: September 14, 2023\n\nLabel: Mass Appeal\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nThe Truth Is In My Eyes\n\n(with Big Hit)\n\nReleased: December 16, 2023\n\nLabel: Surf Club Inc.\n\nFormats: digital download, physical\n\nPaisley Dreams\n\n(with The Game & Big Hit)\n\nReleased: January 1, 2024\n\nLabel: Surf Club Inc., STB Entertainment\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nEPs\n\nTitle Details Half-a-Mil EP\n\n(with Dom Kennedy)\n\nReleased: December 10, 2016\n\nLabel: The Other People's Money Company\n\nFormats: digital download\n\nHalf-a-Mil-2 EP\n\n(with Dom Kennedy)\n\nReleased: February 24, 2017\n\nLabel: The Other People's Money Company\n\nFormats: digital download\n\nHalf-a-Mil-3 EP\n\n(with Dom Kennedy)\n\nReleased: August 7, 2017\n\nLabel: The Other People's Money Company\n\nFormats: digital download\n\nThis Wasn't Supposed to Happen\n\n(with Jay Park)\n\nReleased: November 15, 2019\n\nLabels: Roc Nation, AOMG\n\nFormat: digital download\n\nWhat You Expect\n\n(with Big Sean)\n\nReleased: October 29, 2021\n\nLabel: FF to Def, Def Jam\n\nFormats: digital download, streaming\n\nMixtapes\n\nTitle Details A Hit-Boy Christmas\n\nReleased: December 24, 2010\n\nLabel: HS87\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nLove Notes\n\nReleased: February 14, 2011\n\nLabel: HS87\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nHITstory\n\nReleased: August 7, 2012\n\nLabel: HS87, GOOD\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nAll I've Ever Dreamed Of\n\n(with HS87)\n\nReleased: March 12, 2013\n\nLabel: HS87, Interscope\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nZoomin\n\nReleased: September 2, 2015\n\nLabel: HS87\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nTony Fontana\n\nReleased: May 22, 2018\n\nLabel: HS87\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nGuest appearances and production credit\n\nTitle Year Other artist(s) Album \"Entourage\" 2012 Cyhi the Prynce Ivy League Club \"All Good\" D-Why Don't Flatter Yourself \"The Long Way\" Audio Push N/A \"Them ...\" Inland Empire \"The Right One\" Wale Folarin \"Do Me Now\" 2013 K.
