        "text": "All hail the Rolling Stones, back this week with their first album of new material in 18 years -- but not alone. Among other notable new music releases this week are blink-182′s first original lineup album in 13 years, Cher’s first-ever holiday album and a soundtrack “Trolls Band Together” with the first new *NSYNC song since 2002 (all subject to change)...\n\nAlbum of the Week: There hasn’t been this much excitement over a new Rolling Stones album in decades, but “Hackney Diamonds” (Geffen) -- the group’s first studio album in seven years (2016′s “Blue & Lonesome”) and first of new material since 2005′s “A Bigger Bang” -- justifies that anticipation. The Stones show they still have Greatest Rock ‘n’ Roll Band in the World mettle throughout these dozen tracks, two of which feature original drummer Charlie Watts before his death in 2021. Original bassist Bill Wyman returns to play on one of those (“Live By the Sword”), while the rest of the guest list includes contributions by Paul McCartney and Elton John, while Stevie Wonder and Lady Gaga help generate some truly “Sweet Sounds of Heaven.” “Let the old still believe that they’re young,” Mick Jagger declares at one point, and, even when dipping into the Muddy Waters song that gave them their name “(Rolling Stone Blues”), these septa- and octogenarians are thankfully not sounding or acting their age.\n\nAlbum Title of the Week: Glen Hansard, “All That Was East is West of Me Now” (Anti-/Epitaph)\n\nDid Ya Know?: The Time Experience Project -- premiering with its first album, “Who To Love” (Bay Street) this week -- is the brain child of Eurythmics Dave Stewart, “an immersive 10-song modern rock opera” and film endeavor from a collective of writers, musicians, composers, actors and filmmakers.\n\nNew & Noteworthy:\n\nBlink-182, “One More Time...” (Columbia)\n\nBoys Like Girls, “Sunday at Foxwoods” (Fearless)\n\nCher, “Christmas” (Warner)\n\nLuke Grimes, “Pain Pills or Pews” (Range Music/Mercury Nashville)\n\nDhani Harrison, “Innterstanding” (H.O.T./BMG)\n\nDuff McKagan, “Lighthouse” (The World is Flat)\n\nCraig Morgan, “Enlisted” (Broken Bow) with guests\n\nPoolside, “Blame It All on Love” (Ninja Tune/Counter)\n\nRival Sons, “Lightbringer” (Low Country Sound/Atlantic)\n\n“Trolls Band Together (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)” (RCA)\n\nHot New Singles: Another Sky, “Uh Oh;” Bananarama, “Feel the Love;” Jon Batiste, “Worship (Sofi Tukker Remix);” BBG Steppaa, “Love and War;” Jazmin Bean, “Terrified;” Beadless Bones, “Dead Woman;” Michael Bolton, “Christmas Isn’t Christmas” featuring Mickey Guyton;
