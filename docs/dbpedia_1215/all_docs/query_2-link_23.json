Edits you make to the photo in your library don’t change the original photo in the shared album.\n\nIn the Photos app on your Mac, click a shared album under Shared Albums in the sidebar.\n\nNavigate to the photo you want to edit, double-click it, then click Edit.\n\nClick Import.\n\nClick Edit.\n\nMake changes to the photo, then click Done.\n\nYour edited photo appears in the Imports album and in a day in Photos view. To move the edited photo to another album, select it, choose Image > Add to, then create a new album or place the photo in an existing one. To add the edited photo to the shared album again, click Shared in the toolbar, open the shared album, then click “Add photos and videos.”"
