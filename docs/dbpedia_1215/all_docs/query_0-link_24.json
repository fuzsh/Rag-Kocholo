If something shows up as \"unavailable\" online, it might still be in the store.\n\nAugust 2024\n\nSilence Is Loud by Nia Archives (2024)\n\nNia Archives brings unbridled energy with her debut release Silence Is Loud, a modern jungle album that rivals the classics of the '90s. Using breakbeats and intricate production, Nia revitalizes the jungle genre while infusing it with her distinct style. Collaborating with producer Ethan P. Flynn, the album blends intense bass lines, heartfelt lyrics, and experimental soundscapes, showcasing her multifaceted talent.\n\nThe album opens with the titular track, \"Silence Is Loud,\" combining driving drums and echoing vocals to create a mix of melancholy and euphoria. This theme continues in the reprise, where Nia strips back the production to reveal her raw, soulful vocals, accompanied only by poignant piano keys.\n\nTracks like \"Crowded Roomz\" and \"Tell Me What Its Like\" delve into darker themes with heavy basslines and piercing riffs, reflecting Nias introspective songwriting about loneliness and relationships. Meanwhile, \"Cards on the Table\" offers a more upbeat vibe with bright guitar lines and shimmering synths, showcasing her versatility.\n\nBy blending personal, emotive lyrics with elements from various genres, Nia Archives creates a soundscape that transcends traditional jungle music. Her ability to mix emotional depth with club-ready beats makes Silence Is Loud a standout debut, positioning her as a trailblazer in the UK jungle scene. - Anjelica\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire (dir. Céline Sciamma, 2019)\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire is scintillating story of sapphic love, directed by Céline Sciamma. This slow-burn historical drama unfolds as Marianne, an 18th-century artist, is tasked with painting the portrait of Heloise, a noblewoman. Heloise, determined to resist an arranged marriage, initially declines to sit for portraits. Marianne, pretending to be a companion, observes Heloise during their coastal walks, capturing her likeness in secret and gradually winning her affection.\n\nThe film's visual artistry is striking, with each frame evoking the beauty of classical painting. Sciammas direction, alongside Claire Mathons stunning cinematography, creates an immersive experience where every glance and touch conveys unspoken longing. The deliberate pacing of the romance allows for a profound connection between the characters, leading to a deeply impactful final act.\n\nThe performances by Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel are deeply moving, capturing the emotional complexity of their roles with subtlety. The focus on the women's experiences and desires, with no male characters in the foreground, heightens the intimacy of their love story. Portrait of a Lady on Fire transcends a simple romance, delving into themes of art, memory, and the nature of desire, and offers a poignant portrayal of forbidden love and the quest for freedom within a restrictive society. - Anjelica\n\nStatic by Cults (2013)\n\nNeed a sugar fix for your sweet tooth? Treat yourself to a listen of Cults' 2013 album Static, their saccharine sophomore release. Duo Madeline Follin and Brian Oblivion capture the highs and lows of love.\n\nOpening with \"I Know,\" Static immediately sets a moody tone with its dreamy, atmospheric sound, reminiscent of a Julee Cruise track from Twin Peaks. The album's standout track, \"I Can Hardly Make You Mine,\" pairs a driving beat with dense layers of guitars and organ, creating a powerful and infectious pop tune. \"High Road\" and \"Keep Your Head Up\" further showcase the band's ability to blend catchy melodies with darker, introspective lyrics.\n\nThe production on Static is more intricate than their debut, adding elements that sometimes compete for attention but ultimately create a rich, textured soundscape. Follin's haunting vocals provide a consistent emotional anchor throughout the album, especially on tracks like \"We've Got It\" and the closing \"No Hope,\" a somber piano tune enveloped in static. - Anjelica\n\nJuly 2024\n\nMil Coisas Invisíveis by Tim Bernardes (2022)\n\nTheres about a thousand invisible things a language holds behind its existence yet, when I listen to Tim Bernardes sophomore album, Mil Coisas Invisíveis (2022), the barriers to communicate dissolve into mist and I, instantly, find myself yearning to (further) understand the ties that bind us. Spellbound and energized, under the shadow of a signifier and a signified that await discovery, I sing-and-dance to a flock of well-crafted chansons that feel far from foreign Quite the contrary, under the guise of the unknown, I find familiarity inside the microcosm that Bernardes has built to house his lyrics  mesmo se você não vê (even if you don't see it).\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Nascer, Viver, Morrer\n\n-Realmente Lindo\n\n-Meus 26\n\n-Falta\n\n-Mistificar\n\n-Beleza Eterna\n\n-Mesmo Se Você Não Vê\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nhighwire by gustave ochoa (2024)\n\nFollow the trail of these words web their threaded extension and feel its acoustics play a scene: an EP whose sole requirement is an audiences disposition to take the other end of this tin can and listen intimately .\n\nFor 14 minutes, we are in the confines of a confessional playing priest to a funambulists soliloquy. Off/center, between layers of dream-like production, we sit, waiting to witness the ethereality of a song-writers narrative: bridging the gap between the chords from whence the songs are written and the highwire where theyre dispatched from\n\nFast forward (skip-to-the-end) and behold 4 audiovisual snapshots that piece together a map to an unmoored message. With every lyrics breaking wave you can feel a love letter hitching its way to somebodys ready-abled heart. Only question is: are you the California gal who haunts his Present tense?\n\nHighlights:\n\n-The Highwire Walker\n\n-Fast Forward\n\n-Off/Center\n\n-California Gal\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nHadal by Atlas Maior (2023)\n\nFATA MORGANA!\n\nAtlas Maiors latest release, Hadal (2023), is one that seduces recluses who cant resist bearing witness to muses gone shoeless dancing though oozes of primordial pools of aesthetic confluence . Arab. Turkish. Latin American the hadopelagic zone(s) from whence the traditions undulate from vine-to-vine waiting to root together, symbiotically, their influences. Listen close enough and you will find an effluvious floodplain of melodies that crossroad not only rhythms but cultures.\n\nonly question is: Have you booked your multi-city flight with the intent of mapping-out the trajectory of this reviews provenance?!\n\n(Unmoored, I await your reply on the other end of this thread)\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Basalt\n\n-Ignis Fatuus\n\n-Hadal\n\n-Fata Morgana\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nNew Blue Sun by André 3000 (2024)\n\nThe long-awaited solo album from one half of one of the greatest groups ever created, New Blue Sun, arrives as a reminder of André 3000's infectious mystique. With the title of the first track, \"I Swear, I Really Wanted to Make a 'Rap' Album but This Is Literally the Way the Wind Blew Me This Time,\" Three Stacks lays the foundation that the approach we were expecting is not what were going to get. The album is a mesmerizing instrumental journey that showcases Andrés love for the flute, blending its ethereal tones with comforting rhythms. \"Midnight Blue\" envelops listeners in a meditative way with its moody melodies and intricate arrangements, while \"Sunset Dreams\" merges upbeat rhythms with dreamy textures, evoking optimism and relaxation. Throughout New Blue Sun, André 3000's music creates a calming and immersive experience that stimulates thought and uplifts your spirits. Although this new approach may be unfamiliar to some, it is truly admirable for the boldness with which André chose to share this moment in his journey! - Elijah\n\nManners by Passion Pit (2009)\n\nPassion Pit's Manners, released in 2009 and having sold over 500,000 copies, remains a standout in the world of electronic pop. Michael Angelakos' distinctive vocals and the lush synth beats in tracks like \"Sleepyhead\" and \"The Reeling\" create an infectious, emotive experience. The meticulously crafted album blends catchy hooks with a raw, heartfelt emotion that resonates deeply, making it a timeless classic. Beyond its musical appeal, Manners takes listeners on a journey of nostalgia and introspection. It invites them to immerse themselves in its vibrant soundscapes, where they can navigate through a beautiful chaos, discovering new layers with each listen. - Elijah\n\nRhythm Nation 1814 by Janet Jackson (1989)\n\nJanet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 was released in 1989 and remains a pivotal album in the realm of R&B. With over 12 million copies sold worldwide, its commercial success mirrored its profound influence. The album wasn't just about music; it was a cultural manifesto addressing pressing social issues. Jackson's lyrics tackled topics like racial inequality and drug abuse, all delivered with urgency and optimism. Musically, Rhythm Nation 1814 was a blend of R&B, pop, funk, and industrial influences, showcasing Jackson's versatility. Tracks like the upbeat \"Escapade\" and the melancholic \"Livin In A World\" highlighted her range and depth as an artist. The album set new standards for production quality and thematic depth in R&B, earning Jackson numerous accolades, including a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video. Its impact on R&B was profound, redefining Jackson's image from pop star to socially conscious icon. The record's seven top five singles on the Billboard Hot 100 underscored its broad appeal and lasting influence on popular music. In retrospect, Rhythm Nation 1814 stands as a testament to Janet Jackson's enduring legacy and her ability to use music as a platform for both artistic expression and social change. - Elijah\n\nMolecular Steve by Molecular Steve (2024)\n\nEver had someone hand you some music, Just recorded/released this. Let me know what you think.? Me too, a lot. Most of the time it gets a listen maybe two just in case I missed it the first time. But there are those, very rare, golden moments when you get something new and it has you from the first few notes or lines. Your eyes go wide and you think, Let the whole record be this good. And then it is.\n\nMolecular Steve is a project that emerged from a rekindling of an old friendship, with the band forming after the main member signed a record deal with a friend from 30 years ago. What was initially meant as a casual gift of music transformed into a full-fledged album, highlighting the profound connections between past and present.\n\nWith 90% of the tracks recorded at home, it shows the ease with which artists can now translate ideas into fully-realized songs in just a few hours. This home-based production gives the album a raw, intimate feel, resonating with authenticity and personal touch.\n\nThe songs on Molecular Steve seem to have emerged from a deep, almost unconscious place. The main songwriter describes the process as being a conduit, with melodies and lyrics materializing almost out of nowhere. This spontaneity and organic creation process are palpable in the music. One standout track is \"Psychic Radio,\" which encapsulates the album's ethos. The song delves into the maddening yet magical experience of having a tune lodged in ones mind, compelling the artist to record it. This track, like others on the album, captures the essence of artistic obsession and the drive to create.\n\nThe collaborative spirit of the album is evident, with immense support from incredibly talented artists. A notable mention is Dan Winter, whose Tone footage was used for the album's videos, adding a visual layer that complements the sonic experience.\n\nMolecular Steve is more than just an album; it's a chronicle of revived friendships, spontaneous creativity, and the magic of modern technology. Its a journey through the mind of an artist whose melodies demand to be heard. The result is an album that is personal, compelling, and profoundly resonant. Whether you're drawn in by the backstory or the music itself, Molecular Steve offers a rich, rewarding listening experience. - Marty\n\nMake My Head Sing by Jessica Lea Mayfield (2014)\n\nTen years ago, Jessica Lea Mayfield released her seminal album Make My Head Sing. This thirty-six minute masterpiece, awash with distorted riffs and raw emotions, showcases Mayfield at her most vulnerable. Her poignant lyrics delve into the heartbreaking reality of participating in one's own abuse, capturing the desperate hope that love can transform a person for the better. Despite the heavy themes, the album is compelling, with addictive riffs. The use of reverb and delay adds a haunting quality to the music, while the grungy guitar tones create a sense of tension and release throughout the record. Mayfield's distinctive lilting, twangy voice conveying a sense of resilience and hope. Amidst the darkness, love persists, for better or worse. (On a positive note, Mayfield's later release confirms her escape from this painful chapter, with her talent shining brighter than ever.) Stand-out tracks include \"Oblivious,\" \"Do I Have the Time?,\" and my personal favorite, \"Seein* Starz.\" - Anjelica\n\nI Saw The TV Glow OST (Various Artists, 2024)\n\nTo put it simply, dear reader, this soundtrack is stacked! The film channels nostalgia brilliantly; despite featuring contemporary artists, this theme is beautifully woven into the soundtrack. Reminiscent of shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Twin Peaks, the film includes an in-universe venue where bands like Sloppy Jane and King Woman perform, perfectly capturing the '90s moodiness in which the film is set. Highlights include Yeule's ethereal cover of the Broken Social Scene classic \"Anthem for a Seventeen-Year-Old Girl,\" which does perfect justice to the original. My personal favorite is King Woman's \"Psychic Wound,\" an addictive track as grim and powerful as the movie itself.\n\nThe production quality across the soundtrack is exceptional, with each track meticulously mixed to enhance its atmospheric and emotional impact. The use of analog recording techniques gives the music an authentic '90s feel, while modern mastering ensures clarity and depth. This soundtrack not only complements the film but also stands on its own as a collection of expertly curated songs that evoke a sense of time and place. It is destined to become a classic. - Anjelica\n\nPerfect Days (dir. Wim Wenders, 2023)\n\nTrue to its title, Wim Wenders' Perfect Days is indeed perfect. Undoubtedly one of the most profound films released in the last year, if not the last decade, its impact on me cannot be overstated. Since watching it in theaters, I've felt a renewed appreciation for lifes simple pleasures  an enduring sentiment long after the credits rolled. The film follows a custodial worker in Japan who finds joy in his small daily rituals  meticulously misting his plants, eating lunch next to his favorite tree, and listening to the same tapes day after day.\n\nWenders crafts a quiet yet deeply moving exploration of contentment and the beauty of ordinary moments. The protagonist's routine becomes a meditation on mindfulness and finding happiness in the present. His interactions, from casual acquaintances to unexpected encounters, subtly reveal his character and past, enriching the narrative.\n\nPerfect Days invites us to slow down and appreciate the rhythm of everyday life. It's a film that speaks volumes through its silence, with Wenders' masterful direction and the poignant lead performance creating a timeless reflection on the essence of happiness and the small, perfect moments that make life beautiful. - Anjelica\n\nJune 2024\n\nNadie Sabe Lo Que Va A Pasar Mañana by Bad Bunny (2024)\n\nNobody really knows whats gonna happen tomorrow yet, it seems as though Bad Bunny does (or, at the very least, has a few ideas). A modern day Magus; an artist that has proven  time-and-time again  to be more reliable and consistent in forecasting the future than a national weatherman. In May of 2022 he predicted a collective pre-disposed desire to dance into the next season with Un Verano Sin Ti. Ironically enough, a year-and-half later, he invites us to redial our musical temporality with his latest opus, Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va A Pasar Mañana: the perfect Fall equinoctial bookend to a Summer solstice\n\n1 hour and 21 minutes later, its clear: Bad Bunnys ambitions are in full display and for all to hear and sing (in unison): 22 songs that just dont seem to drop the will of their existence: a gentle reminder to weather the storm of ones emotions and celebrate today  here and now  for tomorrow is not promised\n\n...Carpe Diem, dear reader(s)!\n\nHighlights:\n\n-NADIE SABE\n\n-MONACO\n\n-HIBIKI (Feat. Mora)\n\n-CYBERTRUCK\n\n-VOU 787\n\n-GRACIAS POR NADA\n\n-BABY NUEVA\n\n-VUELVE CANDY B\n\n-BATICANO\n\n-NO ME QUIERO CASAR\n\n-WHERE SHE GOES\n\n-PERRO NEGRO (Feat. Feid)\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nSubmarine by The Marías (2024)\n\n-Does Summer have a song?!\n\n-No; better than that, it has a whole full-length album!\n\nThank you, The Marías, for making the perfect concoction of tunes in Submarine (2024): a soundtrack to dispel any thoughts about the weather and solely focus on Google searching the nearest dancefloor. Here is a group who has never shied away from orchestrating melodies that make their audience feel as though they are one chord away from a multi-sensory experience. If Cinema (2021) felt like a chanteuses sensual love letter to peek behind the (red) curtain  à la David Lynchs Blue Velvet , Submarine reads like a siren song from the other side of the (blue-silver) screen  re: Mulholland Dr. Complete opposites, yet in direct conversation with one another: two recordings that bookend each other (and latch) into its listeners subconscious. Therefore, whether you are just discovering them or just resubmerging yourself into their hazy dream-like lullabies, remember to sport yourself properly to weather the tide with care and good company.\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Echo\n\n-Run Your Mouth\n\n-Blur\n\n-Paranoia\n\n-Lejos De Ti\n\n-Vicious Sensitive Robot\n\n-Sienna\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\n12 Segundos De Oscuridad by Jorge Drexler (2006)\n\nHow does one follow-up an album like Eco (2005)?\n\nThis was the one prerogative I couldn't muster the will to silence as I heard the opening chords to Jorge Drexlers 12 Segundos de Oscuridad (2006)... Fifteen seconds into the self-titled opening track and I cant help but picture Mr. Drexler as a lighthouse keeper signaling safe harbor to a collection of melodies to find room and board in his guitar. Yet, just as he shelters these creations from the gaping maws of secrecy, we are also lured into the sirens den: invited to sit across from the songs and its writer and bear witness to the alchemy of songwriting.\n\nHighlights:\n\n-12 Segundos De Oscuridad\n\n-La Vida Es Más Compleja De Lo Que Parece\n\n-Transoceánica\n\n-High And Dry\n\n-Hermana Duda\n\n-Quien Quiera Que Seas\n\n-Sanar\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nThe Art of Forgetting by Caroline Rose (2023)\n\nI became a fan of Caroline Rose during the Loner cycle, and while that album and its 2020 follow-up Superstar see Rose adopting personas and generally keeping a distance from the subject matter, The Art of Forgetting strips away that distance in favor of intensely personal writing. Rose manages to balance the devastation by interjecting sweet voicemail messages from their grandma, with the first voicemail interlude hitting after what might be the album's most gut-wrenching lyrical delivery: Rose yelling, \"This is gonna break you / You're gonna rip your own heart out / There is the art of loving / This is the art of forgetting how / You've gotta get through this life somehow.\" Then we hear Rose gasping for air, followed immediately by their grandma checking in to make sure they're doing okay. After fifty minutes of pain, the closing track concludes with Rose finally calling their grandma back, assuring her that everything's fine and yes, they're \"eatin' good.\" It's dark right now, but they're working through it. It really will be okay.\n\nThis is Rose's most expansive and adventurous production yet, weaving modern and nostalgic elements seamlessly and juxtaposing barren arrangements with overwhelmingly powerful ones. It's an incredibly affecting album, and Uncle Carol's best one yet. -- Allie\n\nI Hear You by Peggy Gou (2024)\n\nI was caught off guard by one song in particular last year, which kept me in the zone and craving more. That being \"It Goes Nanana\" by Peggy Gou. Gou's follow-up debut album is now out, so how does it hold up to the 90s inspired banger of a single? I Hear You operates in the identical retro-fantasy structure that spawned \"Nanana,\" cherry-picking legendary sounds from house music's heyday in the late '80s and the early '90s, drawing heavily on the eras club music that Gou claims \"changed her taste\" during lockdown. Glassy Italo synthesizers, vast electronic drums, hammering organs, FM synthetic MIDI horns, the powerful thwack of the TR-909, multiple bending breakbeats, makes this album an easy recommendation for anyone who enjoys the heyday of 80s - 90s house music. Listen to this on a night drive in the city and get lost in the grooves weaved by Gou. -Grant\n\nnothing or something to die for by mui zyu (2024)\n\nMuch like her last album, Rotten Bun for an Eggless Century, nothing or something to die for is more than just an album, it's an experience. Listening to nothing or something to die for isn't an easy pill to swallow. As in you can really just pick a few songs to listen to while you work or study. Nothing or something to die for is a demanding album that won't take no for an answer. Additionally, it is aware that not everyone will find it appealing. Songs melt into each other, sound morphing from ambient and soft to loud and chaotic. This is a narrative of empathy and apathy, of trying to discover a sense of meaning in a society overtaken by consumerism and technology. Nothing or something to die for poses a lot of questions, however mui zyu doesn't ask for an answer. She's only expressing how she sees the world, trying to discover something that will make it all worthwhile. And now it's up to you, whatever that could be. -Grant\n\nSonido Cósmico by Hermanos Gutiérrez (2024)\n\nIf there is one musical group in today's sonic landscape and cultural zeitgeist that can perfectly set a highly detailed yet specific vibe, its Hermanos Gutiérrez. Sonido Cósmico really set the perfect tone for traveling South America and the American Southwest solo on horseback during a sunset. You already know what to expect from this release if you're familiar with their other albums. In their seven years of recording together, Hermanos Gutiérrez has not deviated much from their established formula. At moments, the guitar parts seem to be one single instrument due to their deep blending and heavy reverberation, making them two inseparable components to one harmonious whole. Percussion is very modest and on occasion limited to the use of muted strings. If you are into mood-setting musical pieces and what I described interests you in the slightest, then I would highly recommend checking out this album. Go ahead  take that solo camping trip in a desert in the southwest. Put this on and get lost in its soundscapes around your campfire while the sun sets in the distance. -Grant\n\nMay 2024\n\nMestizx by Ibelisse Guardia Ferragutti & Frank Rosaly (2024)\n\n12 songs later I feel seen!\n\nHeres a record(ing) that perfectly captures the melting pot of being Latin American. Strewn across a wide canvas of genres  unspooled and untethered, for all to witness  are all the intricacies that hold a Mestizxs lineage. Spanish. Portuguese. English. Whereas anyone would see these as ethnic boundaries, musicians Ibelisse Guardia Ferragutti and Frank Rosaly see a Vennian intersection of contemplation and dialogue. Using the Present as an opportunity to bridge the gap between the Past and the Future: preserving our ancestry all the while actively dawning a better tomorrow for our Culture.\n\nFor the better part of 42 minutes, you can feel the dichotomous nature of Language: on one hand it grounds, while on the other it gives flight to Imagination. Therein lies the crux of this magnum opus: deciphering the difference between the colonizer and the colonized  Soy conquistada soy conquistadora (I am conquered I am a conqueror).\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Destejer\n\n-Mestizx\n\n-Barro\n\n-Saber Do Mar\n\n-Writing With Knots\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nSoary by Ichi Ni San Shi (2024)\n\nCopacetic felicitousness those are the only two words my vocabulary can muster the will to lasso after hearing Ichi Ni San Shis latest outing, Soary (2024)  sorry! I apologize for lack of a more encompassing feeling, but I will say my state of mind is grounded upon a bevy of songs that have left my ears in a state of musical euphoria. Like a speakeasy, this record holds a trove of melodies that await a hungry audience of listeners to unearth them with the flick of a password. Bob, dip, and bow: adhere, in an osmotic state, the chambered emotions that trapeze and echo through these 9 songs\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Fleeting Thing\n\n-Tame\n\n-Stubborn Trapeze\n\n-Extraordinary Hours\n\n-It's The Now Of Today\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nClandestino by Manu Chao (1998)\n\nSolo voy con mi pena, sola va mi condena\n\nCorrer es mi destino para burlar la ley\n\nPerdido en el corazón de la grande Babylon\n\nMe dicen el clandestino por no llevar papel\n\nThis is the opening to Manu Chaos 1998, Clandestino: a debut whose musical thesis is laid bare for all listeners to witness from the start 39 seconds in and one already feels the pain of being an illegal  sorry, a clandestino!  traveling without the proper credentials to support ones existence. Through 16 songs, the singer-songwriter builds a bevy of vignettes that commute in between a collage of languages whose purpose serves more as phonetic costumes made to prevent being deported and less as a tool to bridge the communication between cultures.\n\nYet, for all its heady subjects, this album never fails to make you feel as though there is a light at the end of the tunnel. For 45 minutes we are gifted with a rose window of genres and idioms: all which erect a Tower of Babel that awaits discovery. Only question left is: do you dare take this (musical) pilgrimage?\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Clandestino\n\n-Desaparecido\n\n-Bongo Bong (Feat. Anouk Khelifa)\n\n-Je Ne Taime Plus (Feat. Anouk Khelifa)\n\n-Mentira\n\n-Luna Y Sol\n\n-Malegría\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nApril 2024\n\nYou Who I Lean On by 1KSpin (2024)\n\nThe concept of an EP is one I have always found to be an artistic tightrope: a calibrated balance of songs whose sole purpose is to befriend a listener's appetite for discovery. The equivalent of a first date. Where a full-length album has the luxury to explore different focal points of narratives, an extended play is limited to an elevator pitch  its intentions are precise and methodical.\n\nThis brings me to 1Kspins, aptly-titled, You Who I Lean On: a collection of 6 songs whose title reads like an open book. Journaling ad verbum, the young lyricist invites us to sit front row and bear witness to his hearts prism-like confessions, while its restlessness beats through the ebb and flow of its own thump(s)...\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Worth It\n\n-Back To The Basics\n\n-You Who I Lean On\n\n-No Pun Intended\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nSúper Terror by Él Mató A Un Policía Motorizado (2023)\n\n2023 was the year I found a fertile abundance of music emanating from all walks of the world Amongst the copious records I was able to discover (and obsess over!), I found  time and time again  a steady stream of chords that led to Latin America. From Central America all the way down to South America to the Caribbean, I felt as though I was sonically traveling through space and time: having my passport stamped, from port-to-port, with the drop of a needle. It was then, through my travails, that I discovered underneath the Equator, a gem tucked next to the undertow of the Atlantic Ocean: Argentinas Rock band El Mató A Un Policía Motorizado and their 10th studio album, Súper Terror. Suddenly, here was a band that sounded like a musical buffet of genres and styles I had gorged and actively consumed for as long as I could remember: New Wave, Post-Punk, Indie Rock... and, in Spanish to boot?! All in all, it took some years of pilgrimage but Im happy that the thread of their melodies found a rest stop in my ears and now  hopefully  your eyes\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Un Segundo Plan\n\n-Diamante Roto\n\n-Coronado\n\n-Moderato\n\n-Profeta De Fuego\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nDesert Dreaming by Dustin Kensrue (2024)\n\nYou know how they say you should never meet your heroes?! Whoever said this was not familiar with the following act. You see, if you are familiar with Dustin Kensrue you would come to the conclusion that you're in the presence of greatness: heres a man who weathered endless melodies in a sea of post-harcore with his band Thrice. A man, who over the interim of the years, has morphed into a troubadour of sorts playing a pilgrims intermission: a classic sojourner that began his journey with a plea; morphed it into a spark; only to honeymoon us in the afternoon of a timeless desert. Here is a songwriter who, time and time again, managed to conjure up some of the most striking metaphors and most indelible Western hemispherical lyrics, all the while cementing the idea of the man, the myth, the musical chameleon: Dustin Michael Kensrue!\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Death Valley Honeymoon (Feat. Cat Clyde)\n\n-High Scalers\n\n-Treasure In The West\n\n-Lift Your Eyes\n\n-The Heart Of Sedona\n\n-Desert Dreaming\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nThe Collective by Kim Gordon (2024)\n\nVicious, Violent and Captivating\" is exactly what I would say to someone who asked me to describe the album in a TLDR format. The album in a sense is Gordons thoughts and feelings about being on social media for an extended period of time. She has made it no secret that, a lot like the rest of us, she is addicted to her phone and scrolling various social media. The Collective is a take on the soulless, dopamine sucking digital landscape we are all accustomed to. With blown out beats, heavy guitars, deep bass and droning noises, Kim Gordons The Collective is a drive down the dark sketchy alleyway of social media. An album that is about looking past the gilded appearance of social media and realizing the damage it has done to the human psyche. - Grant\n\nLoss of Life by MGMT (2024)\n\nMGMT have always been a band that have seemed to create mixed feelings among people. Some people loved their sound and catchy electronic songs and others just didn't really pay much mind. Initially projected to be another top 40 billboard electronic pop group, MGMT have repeatedly subverted the expectations of fans and casual listeners alike. With their 2018 album Little Dark Age becoming their magnum opus in the eyes of a lot of fans the next question would be, How do you make a follow up? Well, we got our answer this year with the release of their latest album, Loss of Life, and again the duo completely subvert expectations to various results. Instead of retreading the synth pop atmosphere of Little Dark Age, Loss of Life takes inspiration from 80s power ballads, late 70s folk tunes and most of all Brit-Pop. Loss of Life definitely has its highs and lows but overall it's a really enjoyable and memorable experience. It's very different from anything they have done thus far but the songwriting and lyrics are very much still MGMT. Definitely worth checking out and giving it a listen. - Grant\n\nJar of Flies by Alice In Chains (1994, reissued 2024)\n\nAnyone who has ever had the slightest interest in early 90s grunge / alternative rock has at least heard about Jar of Flies. First released in 1994 as an EP, Jar of Flies was critically hailed and became a massive commercial success. It quickly became the best selling EP of all time until it was dethroned a decade later by the JayZ and Linkin Park EP Collision Course. In a quick summary, Jar of Flies is a dark, moody and emotional album that is mostly played in a stripped down setting with acoustic instruments. The sound of the album is dark, warm and rich. Songs like Rotten Apple and Nutshell best showcase all of these elements together. Jar of Flies holds a special place in many AiC fans' hearts (mine included), and if this is your first time giving it a listen, I don't think it will be hard to see why. - Grant\n\nMarch 2024\n\nBirds In The Ground by EIAFUAWN (2005, reissued 2023)\n\nImmediately upon hearing this album for the first time a couple of summers ago it appealed to my inner bummed-out-early-aughts-gen-x-dad persona that I got shuffling around somewhere deep in my psyche. Light some nag champa, filter an early Duster record through warm rain and dry it in autumn sunshine and I think youd produce Birds In The Ground.\n\nAfter parting ways, Jason Albertini temporarily wandered somewhere over there to start writing under his Helvetia project, and meanwhile his writing cohort Clay Parton walked his brighter attitude back to his house to write under his own solo project EIAFUAWN. His projects name is supremely fitting when you think of the cultural context of its release in 2006: Everything Is All Fucked Up And WhatNot!!!.\n\nDefinitely the most popular song on the album, No More Like That, is probably a crowd favorite for its optimistic jaunt, great for kicking your mood into gear, and overall just sweetness. Throughout the album are interesting (and at times creepy) guitar drawls, a nice choice to mix both the clean and wet guitar tones, and tape effects that unify every track and add to that whole incensed living room vibe that were after.\n\nIll admit, there are some parts that make me cringe just the tiniest bit, but honestly I think its just because it calls out that aforementioned inner sad boy thing I got goin on; lyrics such as Lost your patience, lost your temper / Lost your coffee with cream / All over me. Shudder. That is a lyric written on a loose rolling paper isnt it? Dont you love it, though?\n\nGood God, Yall smacks a little of some Rob Crow sounds. I dont spend enough time on scary Duster forums to know if this is a totally contrived comparison but I thought Id mention it anyways. You like Pinback? You like this song. Thats precisely why I got hooked: the guitar tones, the tongue-in-cheek grooves, and a jilted soft vocal delivery. Numero Group has been nailing every reissue and this album gets to join that league. Come grab this album from us as a canary yellow color variant, or black vinyl is available as well if you prefer. - Eva Nova\n\nRadical Romantics by Fever Ray (2023)\n\nWhat do you think of when you think about love? Of fear? What do you know of the delicate middle-spaces when you sleep beside another person, and of ecstasy? Do you feel the same thing we feel? Do you feel the mounting claustrophobia as you navigate your day-to-day as someone who identifies as queer in any way?\n\nRadical Romantics is Karin Dreijers bold endeavor to explore these questions. At first I wanted to call it a soliloquy, but the listener cannot deny that there are many voices singing and screaming together about something that very much affects the collective. Throughout the album, Fever Ray challenges hostility towards subversive sexuality and identity, fighting back with hysterical love, with harrowing examinations of those that would disenfranchise us, and, at times, with actual fists.\n\nWhat They Call Us is a bloodchilling opener, encapsulating that growing fear I mentioned as well as the understanding that more and more communities are no longer welcoming us here/there and that we must be vigilant if we are to be safe. Did you hear what they call us? / Did you hear what they said? / I've got a plan that's flexible / Just don't stop anywhere. Hard, distant, booming kick drums and winding synths add to the feeling of imminent danger.\n\nRadical Romantics showcases Karin Dreijer working in excellent form. Their first 2 albums under their solo project, Fever Ray, are very sonically different, but I believe if you listen closely you can hear their musical style re-coagulate just in time for the third album. Karins trademark tactic of utilizing vocal filters to create different characters in their songs has developed new personalities, one actually being portrayed on the cover of the album: our beautiful freak, grinning so sweet and coy at us, trapped in the Normies world trying to figure out how to exist within it. I was very excited to learn that Karin would be teaming up with their twin brother Olof once more for the first 4 songs, reuniting the glorious duo originally responsible for the electronica empire The Knife. The pair have actually evolved their trademark sound a bit, but still hold onto their beloved gothic steel drums. Kandy, one of the Twin productions, is so sensual, sharp, and addictive, just like the entirety of Silent Shout. (Also, check out the Kandy music video pretty pretty please.)\n\nOther notable collaborations include Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who both contributed production to Even It Out, a vengeance song that was written as a violent threat to the boy Zacharias who mercilessly bullied Karins kid for being different. When I saw Fever Ray perform this album live I saw that most people in the audience really resonated with this song, chanting cut, cut, cut along with the band. There is something very cathartic about seeing that parental rage expressed like this: frank, protective, searching for a sense of justice somewhere in the fray, finally throwing one punch against the many thrown your way.\n\nOkay Im gonna try to wrap it up cause I could keep going. Come find me in the shop if you wanna discuss all things Karin and Olof Dreijer some more. This album is ecstatic, soft, electronically innovative, mute, thrashing, and creepy. It vocalizes thoughts and feelings that other people may be too shy to speak about themselves. I love this album very much and if you are angry and full of love you probably will, too. - Eva Nova\n\nIn the Sun in the Rain by Fieh (2022)\n\nOne cant help but get lost among the ebb and flow of the chords and melodies Norwegian 8-piece band, Fieh, brings to a ready-abled audience of listeners From its opening to its closing track your emotions are strapped to a rollercoaster of which you dont know whether to sing or dance  in truth, whether youre in the sun or in the rain: YOU SHOULD BE DOING BOTH! Without falling prey to the entrapments of garbagical tropes (i.e. being solely cataloged as neo-soul), they manage to intermingle with a wide array of different genres just enough to catch lightning in a bottle and concoct a Masterpiece.\n\nHighlights:\n\n-In The Sun In The Rain (Move On Up)\n\n-Fast Food\n\n-Grendehus Funkadelic\n\n-Allthetimeevenwhen\n\n-Englishman\n\n-Rooftop\n\n-Hero\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nAmén (The Nomad's Dream) by Berhana (2024)\n\nSpring has sprung and awakened Zephyrus from its slumber  may the sweet breath of the West wind scatter our hibernal blues with Berhanas sophomore album, aptly titled, Amén (2024) 12 songs: 26 minutes of ebb and flow. Granted, given its short runtime, one might be more inclined to call it more of a booster shot but, by all means, dont be discouraged from unearthing this gem. Quite the opposite: stop yourself  mid-sentence  and pick this album up: let this nomad recite his dreams in detail and swim in the discourse of his verses just see where the cadence of his stories takes you\n\nI mean, what exactly do you need to do for the next 30 mins?! (I know I already used up 3-4 mins reading this, hence why I say half-hour).\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Gone (Abebe Bikila)\n\n-Tanuki\n\n-Anansi\n\n-WOW!\n\n-Honeycomb\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nEl Primer Instinto by Jaguares (2002)\n\nTheres an undercurrent stream of consciousness that flows from Jaguares lead singer, Saúl Hernández, lips  an enlightenment that can only be attained while listening to him\n\nThis thesis is rooted in 2002s El Primer Instinto: a compilation of songs that highlight a musical career that spans across two bands that shaped our definition of Rock en Español, Jaguares and the then defunct Caifanes. As if refracting the sun through a prism, we are openly invited to pore through a catalog of songs that are being re-interpreted in a different light\n\nThe end results? At first instinct, I would venture into a world of kaleidoscopic musings, but Id rather have you experience, first-hand, the magic that awaits on the other side of this musical gem...\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Viento\n\n-Arriésgate\n\n-Mátenme Porque Me Muero\n\n-Detrás De Los Cerros\n\n-Fin\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nUnderdressed at the Symphony by Faye Webster (2024)\n\nThe fifth full length offering from the Atlanta native explores the economical lyrical power of melancholic mantras with a laidback, 70s lounge feel and a fearless use of space. Flagship tunes like \"Thinking About You\" and \"Lifetime\" exist in a place somewhere between pop and jazz between heartbreaking ballads and explorative jams.\n\nFlanked by pedal steel and a Fender Rhodes that colors less-is-more chord progressions, the sparkling, intuitive brilliance of Nels Cline (Wilco) helps Webster navigate these spaces on \"Wanna Quit All the Time,\" while \"But Not Kiss\" features a melody line reminiscent of French duo Air juxtaposed with a piano pounding in support of the singer/songwriters deceptively simple chorus of \"Yeah, Yeah.\"\n\nOn the playfully titled \"Lego Ring,\" Webster enlists former middle schoolmate Lil Yachty to lend cooly processed vocals and some necessary respite, even as \"Feeling Good Today\" utilizes the same auto tuned glow to give voice to spontaneous, morning musings of uncertainty.\n\nUnderdressed at the Symphony plays at times like a personal, meditative exorcising of romantic demons, or maybe more broadly making sense of that rudderless feeling of having more questions than reasons. The kind of feeling that comes right after the storm of an abrupt ending, but just before the calm of finding your feet again.\n\nHighlights:\n\n\"Thinking About You\"\n\n\"Wanna Quit All the Time\"\n\n\"Feeling Good Today\"\n\n\"Lifetime\"\n\n- Russell G. Ochoa\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nMalignant (dir. James Wan, 2021)\n\nJames Wan's 2021 horror film Malignant is, in short, absolutely bonkers. Reminiscent of an '80s B-movie but boasting a Hollywood budget, this flick is confident in its ability to win audiences over with unhinged gory delight. Going into the theater showing I was skeptical, expecting another marathon of cheap jump scares with no payoff, a habit of recent Blumhouse movies. My skepticism lasted only about twenty minutes upon realizing Malignant is entirely self-aware and gleeful in its playfulness.\n\nThe movie starts off with a flashback at a hospital. The staff discuss a highly dangerous patient named Gabriel who possesses a supernatural ability to control electricity. The doctor states Gabriel is a \"cancer\" to be cut out, ending this sequence on an ambiguous note. In the present day, our protagonist Madison (Annabelle Wallis) is attacked by her husband, culminating in a head injury which triggers strange dreams and visions of violence. For much of the movie we follow Madison in her search for answers about her mysterious past and her disturbing visions as they increase in frequency.\n\nFor all its zaniness, Malignant is not without style. Fans of giallo horror will delight in callbacks to the genre in the form of disorienting close-ups and a saturated color palette. Bright blues and reds illuminate pivotal moments in the story, harkening back to some of Dario Argento's finest films. The score is straight out of the 1980s and features shrieking violins as well as a sample of Pixies' \"Where is My Mind\" employed brilliantly. The crowning jewel of highlights though is the choreography in one core scene I hesitate to even mention - suffice it to say you will know when you see it. Perhaps because of his mainstream success, nobody reigns Wan in at all anymore - horror fans rejoice! Malignant is evidence of Wan's creative freedom, boasting an insane concept that requires suspension of disbelief and rewards you with silliness and spectacle. - Anjelica\n\nFairy Rust by Wombo (2022)\n\nHailing from Louisville, Kentucky, the three-piece Wombo is a force with which to be reckoned. The indie band is full of surprises and sounds wholly unique to them, expertly fusing prog, art rock, and post-punk. Their second album Fairy Rust from 2022 is full of gothic whimsy, darker and moodier than their debut Blossomlooksdownuponus yet still retaining the playfulness employed in their previous releases.\n\nThe tracks on Fairy Rust flow seamlessly into each other and shine with bouncy, erratic bass lines thick with reverb. Vocalist and bassist Sydney Chadwick writes lyrics shrouded in mystery, speaking to listlessness and yearning. Her vocals often remind me of kraut-rock legends Stereolab such as in the melancholic second track Sour Sun.\n\nListening to this album, and perhaps because of its title, I am reminded of fairytales. Often surreal and full of childlike wonder, most of those stories also contain grim darkness. The track Below the House has the cadence and melody of a nursery rhyme intercut with a wailing bass and crunchy guitar riffs. Sickly-sweet and haunting, Fairy Rust is akin to a walk in the woods at dusk  maybe the paths you take are familiar, but in the looming darkness, everything becomes uncanny and thrilling. - Anjelica\n\nFeelings by Brijean (2021)\n\nSometimes music brings you to a different place. You close your eyes and through the magic of your headphones you are transported to a beach. It's dusk and the smell of sea salt is in the air. A warm breeze floats through and the sound of conga drums and vocals like honey lull you into a blissful daydream. This is what the musical duo Brijean conjures with their LP Feelings. Brijeans music is a perfect crossover between lounge and disco, a groove that is relaxing yet too engaging to tune out.\n\nThe albums first track, Day Dreaming, captivates right from the onset. Brijean coos Daydreaming about you / Do you need what I need too? Do you feel what I feel too? Her lyrics are always sweet, never cynical. This haze carries through the entire record, calling for multiple listens whenever ones sweet tooth cries for sugar.\n\nSome may recognize Brijeans percussive skills from her work with Toro Y Moi and U.S. Girls, but she shines here as the primary songwriter. Backed up by producer and multi-instrumentalist Doug Stuart, the pair weave music to float to, melodies of which dreams are made. - Anjelica\n\nHéroes: Silencio Y Rock & Roll by Héroes del Silencio (2021)\n\nTheres only so much one can write about Rock & Roll before one has to, inevitably, talk about Zaragozas famous Héroes del Silencio: a quartet that not only reigned atop the rock charts ever since they erupted into the scene in the mid to late 80s but contributed in shaping-and-defining the shapeshifting term we have come to understand as Rock En Español. From their 1988 debut, El Mar No Cesa to their last studio album, 1995s Avalancha, one cant deny the musical prowess/ambition employed throughout their discography. Then again, for Enrique Bunbury each tune is a fine mesh that captures his soulful vibrations  some of which would make a grown-ass (wo)man weep. In the silence of a rebuttal, here are 29 songs (2 hours and 1 minute) of tunes that will make you wonder if Apollo and Shiva ever copulated Who knows?! Maybe the result was a Hero we never knew we needed.\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Héroe De Leyenda\n\n-Mar Adentro\n\n-Hace Tiempo\n\n-Entre Dos Tierras\n\n-Malas Intenciones\n\n-La Sirena Varada\n\n-En Brazos De La Fiebre\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nTANGK by IDLES (2024)\n\nIdles was a band that had eluded me for the longest time yet, that changed October 18th of 2023: the first time I heard their single Dancer. 3 minutes and 9 seconds, that is how much it took for me to turn my ignorance into a punch-drunk love affair, one that left my hips begging to find the nearest dance floor, so to speak. I was instantly hooked: struggling to refrain myself from screaming the closing verses I'm a dancer/You're a dancer/Let's dance along with lead singer, Joe Talbot, in a futile attempt to be the Hall to this Oates\n\nMonths ensued and, while I worked up a feverish sweat like Lucifer, so to speak, February 16th arrived, bringin about the release of their 5th studio album, Tangk. Suddenly, here were 11 songs that beseeched a listener's attention: 40 minutes of pure and raw energy that seeped from every chord and lyric  an experience from which one couldnt walk away without breaking a sweat, unscathed or, so to speak.\n\nHighlights:\n\n-IDEA 01\n\n-Gift Horse\n\n-POP POP POP\n\n-Roy\n\n-Dancer (Feat. LCD Soundsystem)\n\n-Hall & Oates\n\n-Jungle\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nSilencio by Karen Y Los Remedios (2023)\n\nIts refreshing to hear a band whose name is not used synonymously with slang but rather as a premonition Cue Karen Y Los Remedios: a band who summons a plethora of different musical roots that branch-out-and-converse with one another with the hopes of unearthing their own ancestral anthems. The intersection of the overlapping genres traces the slimmest sliver of a Venn: a diagram that beckons 35 minutes of untethered silence to unspool its euphonical threads. Now if the last 79 words havent quite piqued your curiosity, here are 9 songs to remedy the blues that overshadow your doubt(s).\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Flama Eterna\n\n-Silencio\n\n-Cartas Marinas\n\n-Lágrimas\n\n-Tu Felicidad\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nThe Warriors (dir. Walter Hill, 1979)\n\nThe best example of the art of showing rather than telling can be found in the cult classic film The Warriors. You could easily watch this film on silent and get a good idea of what is going on. It is shot in such a way that it explains the story, the setting, and the world without a lot of dialogue and exposition. All of the gangs have no history and can only be identified by their names and uniforms. This causes all of the gangs to wear flashy outfits and have names that match their look. Making this film easily identifiable to any movie goer and is arguably what has made The Warriors the cult classic that it is today. - Grant\n\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas (dir. Terry Gilliam, 1998)\n\nIts probably the most polarizing movie Ive ever seen. Some people hate it and cant find a shred of humor in it. Some people love it because its an acid-laced satire of the American dream. No matter who you are, Im sure youll agree that its one of the most bizarre films out there and that itll stick with you for years to come. Based on the bestselling novel by the same name, the story follows journalist Raoul Duke as he embarks on a journey of self-discovery in Las Vegas after being sent to cover an off-road Mint 400 race. During this time, his heavy use of drugs and alcohol gets him into all sorts of legal and non-legal situations in Vegas. The film is chock full of unforgettable moments and quotes. Heres what I think sums it up best: No sympathy for the devil; keep that in mind. Buy the ticket, take the ride and if it occasionally gets a little heavier than what you had in mind, well maybe chalk it up to forced consciousness expansion: Tune in, freak out, get beaten. - Grant\n\nAkira (dir. Katsuhiro Otomo, 1988)\n\nAkira, what else can I say about this film that isnt already said? This film is a masterpiece for both the sci-fi genre and animation in general. It was achieved through highly detailed art, immaculate animation, thought-provoking storytelling and incredible world building. It's also another fantastic example of showing, not telling. Akira begins with a brief introduction that tells us how the world came to be the way it is. This is about all we know about the history of the setting. The rest is shown through the events of the film with very little dialogue and leaves us to fill in the gaps as to how the world works. This along with the amazing score really makes the movie feel like youre embarking on an adventure. In the end, the textbook definition of an adventure is an unusual, exciting or daring experience, and I think that's the best way to describe Akira. - Grant\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nBug (dir. William Friedkin, 2006)\n\nWilliam Friedkin is widely known for his infamous 1973 classic The Exorcist, but the director wedged his way under my skin with a different horror film  2006s Bug. This unsettling feature explores paranoid delusion and the danger of being vulnerable in the wrong company.\n\nPart romance, part melodrama, and wholly frightening, the movie is almost entirely set in a seedy motel room lending to its claustrophobic tone. Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon play the two leads to perfection, portraying a descent into psychosis that leaves one with whiplash. Judd in particular is at her very best here, simultaneously heartbreaking and terrifying. She is authentic to the point that you almost worry for her and tragically overlooked as she received no real accolades for this role.\n\nWhat I love about Bug is its simplicity and groundedness. Friedkin employs practical effects for the brief but gruesome gore, and the dialogue (from screenwriter Tracy Letts) is refreshingly real, not perfectly articulate and verbose so as to take you out of the movie. The pacing and editing make for a manic experience and there is not one lull in its entire runtime. I truly wish I could see this movie for the first time again. - Anjelica\n\nThe Daytrippers (dir. Greg Mottola, 1997)\n\nWhere do I start with the delightful romp that is 1997s The Daytrippers? I watched it on a lark, having never even heard of it before, and am so glad I took the chance. The film has a simple premise: A woman (Eliza, played by Hope Davis) suspects her husband is cheating on her when she finds a love letter addressed to him. Her well-meaning but meddling Long Island family insist upon taking action to confront him, so they head to the city to catch him in the act.\n\nThe ensemble cast shines here and their chemistry truly sells them as a family, warts and all. Parker Posey plays Elizas younger sister Jo and is cool and charming as always, sporting the most enviable outfits that speak to the films costume design. Ann Meara plays Rita, the matriarch, and is the true star of the film in terms of her presence and performance. Her comedic timing is incredible, especially when she is bonding with Jos quirky boyfriend Carl (Liev Schreiber). Their conversations are a big highlight of the journey and left me wanting some sort of spinoff. Another highlight is the script, boasting fast-paced and loose dialogue, giving each actor plenty of jokes to work with and time to shine.\n\nComing from a family of colorful New Yorkers myself, The Daytrippers was especially comforting and familiar to me. It makes me want so badly wish to go back in time on a road trip through the city to sleuth and bond. Maybe I wouldnt find the humor in the situation were I living it, so the fact that this movie is available to watch is an excellent alternative. I challenge anyone to see this movie and come out of it in a bad mood. - Anjelica\n\nENTERTAINMENT, DEATH by Spirit of the Beehive (2021)\n\nSpirit of the Beehive is one of the most interesting bands in the indie scene today. Each release outdoes the last in terms of sonic innovation, and their 2021 LP ENTERTAINMENT, DEATH proves they are at the top of their game.\n\nThe album is noisy and melodic and defies any singular genre. It contains gorgeous vocal harmonies between Zack Schwartz and Rivka Ravede, the latter of whom is especially hypnotizing. Her voice is like that of a siren lulling prey into calm before the music swells into chaos. There are fuzzy samples of commercials throughout that remind you of falling asleep with the TV on and awakening to a fever dream of a program you can never find again.\n\nThe lyrics speak to my teenage self, bored in suburban America with nothing but drugs and the uncensored Internet for entertainment. It paints images of driving down a maddeningly flat highway, passing only billboards and fast food restaurants and another car on fire. Its the sound of ennui and languor romanticized.\n\nRan all the way home\n\nI want to believe in another life\n\nThe one were meant to be in\n\nIf hell is a mirror then I cant pretend I mean it\n\nAnd when youre gone Ill keep the light on like we were together\n\n track 3, \"WRONG CIRCLE\"\n\n- Anjelica\n\nMonte Sagrado by Robi Draco Rosa (2018)\n\nDéjà Vu  once again, I find myself treading through halls I feel I have crossed before\n\n(Stop me if we have had this conversation before; yet, something tells me this is a discourse that needs to be discussed.)\n\nTheres a beauty to discovering new music-artists: a certain cadence that guides ones footsteps into new uncharted trails. Therein lies the true capacity of Music (emphasis on the capitol M): creating new pathways there were not visible before. For years on end, Puerto Rican singer/songwriter Robi Draco Rosa has been ushering audiences into uncharted territories  with machete on hand, like a true modern day bushwacker. 2018s Monte Sagrado (which translates to Holy Mountain) is not a reference to avant-garde filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky but a testament to the world that awaits on the other side of Discovery. An open invitation to pioneer into the unknown and peer atop the clouds of noise that drown out (y)our fuel for Adventure\n\nHighlights:\n\n-333\n\n-Que Se Joda El Dolor\n\n-Monte Sagrado\n\n-Yo Mismo\n\n-En Las Horas Más Tristes\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nGarden State Soundtrack (2004)\n\nEnnui if you ever go to the library and decide to look up this word and its genus, chances are you will find a readily available DVD copy of Zach Braffs 2004 Garden State along with its musical companion/counterpart (read: soundtrack). Bridging the musical gap between a wide array of artists that ranged from Nick Drake to Thievery Corporation, from Coldplay to Simon & Garfunkel, from Men At Works Colin Hay to Iron & Wines reinterpretation of The Postal Services Such Great Heights the musical crossovers are endless deep cuts that subconsciously narrate a story. A collection of 13 songs that best encapsulate the coming-of-age for a generation on the brink of self-discovery. In the end, all I can say is, like Braffs character, Sam, You gotta hear this one soundtrack*, it'll change your life I swear! (*granted in the movie he says song, but you get the gist of this review).\n\nHighlights:\n\n-I Just Dont Think Ill Ever Get Over You (Colin Hay)\n\n-Blue Eyes (Cary Brothers)\n\n-Fair (Remy Zero)\n\n-Lebanese Woman (Thievery Corporation)\n\n-Let Go (Frou Frou)\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nSiembra by Willie Colón & Rubén Blades (1978)\n\nLa vida te da sorpresas, sorpresas te da la vida, ¡ay, Dios! (x2) -Willie Colón & Rubén Blades Pedro Navaja\n\nIf anyone ever walked up and asked (you): If you could live during any era or decade in time, which would you pick? Me?! My answer would, indubitably, be influenced by the music I was listening to during the line of questioning; but, 9 times out of 10 I would say The 70s Specifically, late 70s/beginning of the 80s. Although the World (emphasis on the capital W) was going through what I would call a pre-pubescent whirlwind of changes, one of the key developments that shaped the then near future and the thereafter was Willie Colón and Ruben Blades 1978 classic Siembra. All of a sudden here were 7 songs  42 minutes and 47 seconds to be exact  that helped the word salsa graduate from a condiment in peoples pantries to a world-renowned genre that everybody wanted to dance and sing to. Moreover, it sowed a generation of Latinos proud and eager to scream La vida te da sorpresas, sorpresas te da la vida (which roughly translates to Life gives you surprises, surprises is what life gives you)... Oh, God, almost 46 years later after its release I must say truer words havent been professed; but let's table that conversation for now, lets just get to the closest dance floor and bask in the glory of this Latin American gem.\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Plástico\n\n-Buscando Guayaba\n\n-Pedro Navaja\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nDecember 2023\n\nAprender A Ser by Mint Field (2023)\n\nTwo words. Mnemonic therapy that is what comes to mind when I think about Mint Fields latest outing, Aprender A Ser (which translates to Learn To Be): a conceptual psycho-visual project whose sole purpose is to arrest your senses (yes, all 5!) all-the-while rocking you into a melodic shapeshifting dreamscape. Dreampop. A hazy diapason of 10 carefully concocted recordings. 40 minutes and 27 seconds that will account for the weightless aura that will (inevitably) accompany its listeners as they float in(to) the ether left by lead singer, Estrella del Sol, and company's both lyrical and musical vapor trail\n\nHighlights:\n\n-El Suspiro Cambia Todo\n\n-Sueño Despierto\n\n-Nuevo Sol\n\n-Puerta Abierta\n\n-Respiro Profundo\n\n-Orquídea\n\n-Antes Que Se Acabe El Año\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nSwimming by Mac Miller (2018)\n\nMy regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send -Mac Millers Come Back to Earth\n\nRegrets are inevitable Not having discovered Mac Miller in his heyday, is one of my biggest. Here was a true Promethean-figure who rose to stardom by encapsulating the élan vital and ennui of a whole generation only to be swallowed by the weight of it. During his discography Mac let his listeners ride shotgun on the passenger side while he cruised through the burb of his hopes and fears  that imaginarium that lived far from the clutches of the demons that (over)populated his mind. Sadly, behind all the rhymes and bars, lied a flawed hero. Although Swimming was released a month before his passing it still feels like an open letter; signed, delivered, yet un-sealed... 5 years after its inception, the ink on his penned lyrics still feel wet. The marriage between the immediacy to live and the delusion of his dark ideations ebb and flow between 13 songs. It is only when the record ends, that one cant help but loop back to the beginning and beg Mac Come Back To Earth...Please! La-da-da-da, da-da-da .\n\nwhile we wait for a reply from above, let us collectively swim against the tides of time and reminisce for another 58 minutes and 39 seconds on Easy Macs lyrical and musical prowess. Man, was he special  the definition of a true sonic explorer!\n\nR.I.P.

More specifically, their lead singer, Gustavo Cerati. Hes an encyclopedia by himself. The very definition not only of an Artist but of an Icon. A worldwide phenomenon born of the flesh and bones of Argentina  the equivalent of a European country in Latin America  whose body of talent exceeded the expectations of the goddess Tyche* herself .although doomed to live the life of a mythical figure (read: Icarus). Nonetheless, Cerati exuded Life. More specifically, Immortality. Thats what his catalog of work cemented. A testament of this statement lies in 14 Episodios Sinfónicos. A collection of songs that have come to see the light of day 8 years after his passing. One final farewell far away from the greedy maws of Death: a swan song sans the sadness that would have shadowed its inception No, this outing lives as a reaffirmation of his prowess, as well as a bookend to the symphonic musings he had shared 21 years earlier with 11 Episodios Sinfónicos (2011). Then again, to listen to Gustavo Cerati is to unlock a spiritual state of ascendance  pure and unadulterated magic (i.e. Nirvana).\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Canción Animal\n\n-Bocanada\n\n-Corazón Delator\n\n-Lisa\n\n-Verbo Carne\n\n-Persiana Americana\n\n-Un Millón de Años Luz\n\n-Signos\n\n-Hombre Al Agua\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\n*The god of success in Greek mythology.\n\nNovember 2023\n\nNada Escrito by Dorotheo (2023)\n\nI have said it before, and I shall say it again now (and most probably a couple more times down the line): Latinos do things different! I explain: 2023 gifted us wave after wave of music coming from an America that was not the North, yet it was attached to it, in a way. Among the many releases, there was a band from Guadalajara, Mexico that entranced me from its opening chords Their name? Dorotheo (and, no, their name is not derived from that Taylor Swift song). Their album? Nada Escrito (which translates to Nothing Written). Now, if the last 102 words have not convinced you of, at the very least, doing a Google search, let me give you a proper enough reason to do so\n\nPenned as a band with the hauntological cool of Broadcast and Stereolab by NPR, Dorotheo is much more than the sum of these two iconic bands: they are an arranged marriage between the alien and the familiar. A cornupic portrait that beckons a mere 36 minutes and 38 seconds from its listeners to evocate a journey into literal saintly steadfastness. The only question that remains is: would you give this opus an opportunity? If so, be ready to be blessed with Dorotheo (which, may I add, means Gods gift)\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Las Nubes\n\n-Día\n\n-Humano\n\n-Intención\n\n-Capricho\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nLaugh Track by The National (2023)\n\n2023 saw The National at its most productive Just mere months after releasing their long-awaited First Two Pages of Frankenstein they decided to grace us with a counterpart we, as listeners, didnt know we needed  cue (the) Laugh Track.\n\nNow, although this story seems reminiscent of the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2022  a total and complete déjà vu  rest assured, when I say its not. Where RHCP failed to grow and deepen the roots of their musical narrative, The National found new ways to highlight what they do best: let Matt Berninger (and wife, Carin Besser) write some of the most self-deprecating lyrics, all the while letting the brothers (both the Dessners and the Devendorfs) tailor-make melodies that shelter each emotion from falling prey to the tropes of cliché. The result is 12 songs that further cement the bands legacy and their accuracy to haunt ones immediate memory\n\n59 minutes and 22 seconds: thats all The National asks of us just enough to make you re-conflagrate your faith (in their work): attest that, like fine wine, it needs to be tended properly for it to age perfectly with time!\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Alphabet City\n\n-Deep End (Pauls In Pieces)\n\n-Weird Goodbyes (Feat. Bon Iver)\n\n-Turn Off The House\n\n-Dreaming\n\n-Space Invader\n\n-Coat On A Hook\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nAs Tall As Lions by As Tall As Lions (2006)\n\nAs Tall As Lions was built different-ly\n\nSometimes I catch myself reminiscing about the bands that shaped the way I value and adhere musical value to the present. Even though the Music(al) Zeitgeist is always in a continuous and contiguous state of change, As Tall As Lions has always held a dear place in the canon of groups I admire and wish they would still be around  so people would witness how amazing they are The embodiment of their genius lies in their sophomore self-titled record: 2006s As Tall As Lions. Penned as [...] schmaltzy alterna-rock that splits the difference between Jeff Buckley and Coldplay by Pitchfork, this record is so much more than the equal parts of that critics reductive 11-word description of a 45 minutes and 27 seconds (magnum) opus. (Then again, comparing lead singer, Daniel Nigro, to the late Jeff Buckley speaks to the prowess and range of his voice; and reducing the band to 2006 Coldplay is just more validation to my point  we all know that Coldplay was at their peak that year.) But thats neither here nor there  or is it?! In the end, there are bands that rise and stand in the halls of one's memories as tall, majestic, and proud as lions  this being one of them Moreover, if their third and final album, 2009s You Cant Take It With You, showed us anything, its that all great things have their time and space on Earth but once they depart you can take them with you: just follow the thread of these words and unearth this gem!\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Stab City\n\n-Song For Luna\n\n-Ghost of York\n\n-Be Here Now\n\n-Where Do I Stand\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nDummy by Portishead (1994)\n\nPortisheads 1994 debut is a slow swirling thing of jazz and hip hop, and electrified skipping movement, birthing a perfect 90s trip-hop piece. Lead vocalist Beth Gibbons graces the sonic masterpiece with a sunken baby doll voice over a rumbling electro-rhythm. Vulnerable and desperate poetry reverberates in a hyper-feminine song and contrasts the deep, dark, tunneling fusion of a tripping bipolar sound. Notable tracks \"Biscuit\" and \"Glory Box\" both bear haunting tones of righteous unease and naive brokenness. \"Glory Box\" is a defeated cry for understanding, a romanticized reflection of the tumultuous phenomenon: the experience of being a woman. Dummy is a 90s classic and a must have for fans of trip-hop and fusion-esque playtime. - Molly Boris\n\nRevolver by The Beatles (1966)\n\nThis album is a perfect axis point between their early and late work. Revolver is my favorite Beatles album. Released in 1966, their early optimism became less of a novelty, and instead, we start to hear a response to the fast-changing world that surrounds the decade. The Beatles will forever symbolize change. Whether or not you were a fan in 1966 and going forward, you were affected by the pulse of The Beatles music; it ran through the blood of everything politics, fashion, art, cults, murder, drugs\n\nFrom the longing dance of \"Eleanor Rigby\" they float to a painfully simple and childlike song, but \"Yellow Submarine\" is rumored to be deeply coded. The album approaches its end beautifully with a nod to the future. \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" Id say is the best song on Revolver, written primarily by Lennon. This album introduces serious experimental work with Eastern influences, sampling, and tape manipulation. Revolver sends its listeners off into a spiraling hunger for more. - Molly Boris\n\nThe Velvet Underground & Nico by The Velvet Underground (1967)\n\nIn the late sixties, the band of fast New Yorkers shined like wet latex under neon lights compared to the dusty and camouflaging hippies in California. Thank the Gods. Id say this is one of the first and greatest alternative albums to have ever been made. When you compare it to what was happening in the era, this is the birth of an absolutely revelatory sound and work of art.\n\nThe VU has not even come close to losing its appeal and undeniable uniqueness. I remember the first time I heard this (2014). I was fifteen years old then. I remember \"Venus In Furs\" and \"Run Run Run\" and \"Im Waiting For The Man.\" Id never experienced such a strange awakening: I was filled with a satiation that suddenly made me weird and hot and happy, my face got warm, and I wanted to do something crazy. Ive returned to The VU for years just to feel it. You dont really walk away from hearing this unchanged. You walk away invigorated, validated, new and shameless.\n\nIf it has more than three chords, its jazz. - Lou Reed\n\n- Molly Boris\n\nThe Enduring Spirit by Tomb Mold (2023)\n\nAfter a 4 long year of radio silence from the band, Tomb Mold finally returns in full force with their new full-length album The Enduring Spirit. The bands last album, 2019s Planetary Clairvoyance, was seen by many fans and critics alike to be the most impressive and well-crafted death metal album in years. So how does a band follow up an album that was hailed as a masterpiece? Well, Tomb Mold found a way by keeping what works and improving on the formula with some slight experimentation. These adventurous songs are composed of a wonderful soundscape of stellar solos, crunchy grooves, and sophisticated moments of atmosphere fancy, yet they also come altogether as an entire unit of harmony. This album has a much more grand scale to the sound than their previous albums and feels like an outworldly adventure. Overall I would rate this album very highly and is on the same level if not slightly better than Planetary Clairvoyance. - Grant\n\n(It Goes Like) Nanana by Peggy Gou (2023)\n\nPeggy Gous new single from her upcoming album feels like something straight out of a time machine. If you would have played this for me and told me it was a hidden gem from early 90s house pop, I wouldn't question it. This song perfectly captures the catchy, upbeat nature of House songs from that time period. Vintage rave chords swoop in over hefty, swinging percussion and a mournful synth with Eurodance overtones. Its so well structured it almost feels like this was created in a lab to create the most catchy dance pop song of all time. From this single, Peggy Gou has my full attention and I can't wait to hear the upcoming album. - Grant\n\nDrinking Gasoline by Cabaret Voltaire (1985)\n\nHypnotic, erratic, and somewhat primitive is how I would best describe Cabaret Voltaires 1985 EP Drinking Gasoline. The duo uses a basic staccato pace, set by drum machines and sequencers, to convey their shattered messages. Bizarre noises and voices cut in and out, distressing your peripheral senses as the insane pounding of the hyperkinetic beatbox strikes the brain. Overall, Drinking Gasoline laid the foundation to their next album The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord which hammered out some of the roughness of Drinking Gasoline and perfected it. Despite all that, I would still recommend this EP. It is an interesting, memorable listen that will make you wanna dance or tap your toes to its mutated rhythms and beats. - Grant\n\nOctober 2023\n\nMoottorilinnut by Kimmo Kuusniemi Band (1982)\n\nMoottorilinnut was supposed to be the third Sarcofagus album but for some reason their label thought it was a good idea to change the name to Kimmo Kuusniemi Band (after main band dude Kimmo) even though his name is almost impossible to spell in English. Regardless, Moottorilinnut translates as Motorbirds. And the metal on Motorbirds has chimes, weird sound effects, and three different vocalists, including Kimmos sister, Muska. There are acoustic intros and exits (outros?) that dont fade in or out but sound like leaving one room then entering another. Some of the songs are about metallic rainbows and Suzuki motorcycles ridden by nocturnal wanderers with glowing eyes. Others are about haunted houses. On Megamachine, we hear about a world of technocratic children whose best friend is the data terminal at home. Of course all this is in Finnish, the irony being that we can now use said data terminals to translate warnings from 40 years ago of the data terminals very existence.\n\nAll this adds up to the fact that Sarcofagus/Kimmo is the best thing to come out of Finland since saunas and reindeer. Which is saying something, because Finland is also the home of bands like Hanoi Rocks and Demilich. Its also where Santa Claus lives and probably the Krampus too. And in a country that has more heavy metal bands per atmospheric decibel than anywhere else in the world, or something, Sarcofagus was, in the early 1980s, among the very first. They make metal that is unconsciously weird. Spooky atmosphere is all around it. In the world of Kimmo Kuusniemi time cycles, motorcycles, amplifiers and a guitar that also works as a functioning flame thrower are more than just symbols, they are tools for collapsing the space time continuum. - Adam\n\nRegresa by Buscabulla (2020)\n\nWhen Hurricane Maria struck my home island, Puerto Rico, in the Fall of 2017, it left us, its inhabitants, for a lack of a better word, displaced. Lack of resources (i.e. water and food), fallen cell towers, and the absence of a working electric grid made this once idyllic paradise a snapshot of desperation. Our slogan  We live where you vacation  was no longer accurate. It was in the midst of all this pandemonium that the brain trust of Buscabulla  Raquel and Wilfredo  decided to leave Brooklyn, NY, and return back home, to PR. With two EPs under their belt (2014s EP I and 2017s EP II), they decided to make a record that would change the course of their career but Im getting ahead of myself  I apologize.\n\nOn May 8th, 2020: during a worldwide phenomenon (which we shall not name like the villain in Harry Potter) they dropped their full-length album aptly titled Regresa (which translates to Return). The title felt like a call to action, not only for them but for everybody who had to leave. Needless to say, when I first heard this album upon release, I was instantly beguiled I learned that Puerto Rico was no longer half a hemisphere from Austin, Texas; no, it was only half an hour away  11 songs to be precise. Could you imagine being in a foreign place and discovering that you are one music record away from being (transported) back home?!\n\nThe rest is History (yes, with a capital H!): Bad Bunny heard their material and decided to compose and write a song with the group. The result was Andrea, a song featured in 2022s Un Verano Sin Ti. Fast-forward to today and Buscabulla has garnered recognition outside of the limits of an island in the Caribbean (100 x 35 to be specific): they are a band whose ambition and talent knows no limits. A band that makes me proud of calling myself Puerto Rican! In the end, just like the lead singer, Raquel, I cant help myself but sing Mío, esto es mío.\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Vámono\n\n-La Fiebre\n\n-El Aprieto\n\n-Mío\n\n-NTE\n\n-No Sabemos\n\n-Nydia\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nAs The Sparks Fly Upward by Harvest Thieves (2023)\n\nHailing from the Caribbean, Country as a genre always felt down-home: music made from a place foreign to my ears and my understanding. Yet, when Cory Reinisch (our fellow Waterloovian) and his band of multi-faceted musicians started making the rounds during the summer season with their single Cadillacs In The Sky, I couldnt resist the urge to break the dry spell and two-step in line  I mean talk about ending the summer with a new pep in your step!\n\nFast forward to Friday, October 20th and their long-awaited, full-length album was out-and-about. Suddenly, here were 12 songs (46 minutes and 46 seconds) of pure and unadulterated nectar harvested directly from the tree of melodies: a concoction that would make a country of Hall of Famers honk-&-tonk to.\n\nNow, the sum of the 135 words (up to this point  yes, I counted them!) don't hold a candle to the beauty that this record holds behind each lyric, know that every song holds a garden of emotions that wait to make their way through your subconscious. Yet, dont just take my word, grab yourself a copy and feel the sparks (as they fly upwards)...\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Birth Of A Salesman\n\n-Cadillacs In The Sky\n\n-Gaslighter\n\n-McCulloch County Wind Chimes\n\n-Friendly Fire\n\n-Unrequited\n\n-Last Call\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nAhora by Melenas (2023)\n\n2023 has brought about many musical surprises, thus far yet, one of the most unexpected came from a Spanish all-women-quartet called Melenas. On September 29th, they released their latest album aptly-titled Ahora, which translates to Now or Right Now  depending on which of your Spanish-speaking friend(s) you ask. All of a sudden, here was a carefully crafted elixharating concoction that upon consumption (44 minutes and 7 seconds, to be exact) would not only morph both the word elixir and exhilarating into a newfound creation that would have the editors of a dictionary scratching their head, but into a roller coaster ride that will have the most conservative of listeners pirouetting between infectious hooks and melodies. Now, without the need to devolve into a philosophical discourse, I attach the true purpose of this review: my open invitation which reads as follows: If youre reading this STOP; dont waste any more time, put on your (dancing) shoes and discover this gem of a record ¡AHORA! \n\nP.S. I expect a thank you! \n\nHighlights:\n\n-Ahora\n\n-K2\n\n-1986\n\n-Dos Pasajeros\n\n-Bang\n\n-Promesas\n\n-Mal\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nCovenant The Sword And The Arm Of The Lord by Cabaret Voltaire (1985)\n\n(AKA The Arm Of The Lord.) Cabaret Voltaires 7th full length studio album (1985). Outstanding 80s electronica that is a must have for every collection. Punchy, freakish, industrial dance music that will blow your socks off!!! Not for the average folk, but is so nice on the ears of an electronica fan. Id highly recommend it to fans of Yello or New Order. Its seriously one of the weirdest, yet satisfying things that I have found myself dancing to. Important context for spirits alike: The band takes its name after the Zurich nightclub that fostered the early DADA movement. This album is a perfect sonic response to the dadaists absurdity. IYKYK. - Molly Boris\n\nRejected Unknown by Daniel Johnston (2001)\n\nCLASSIC OUTSIDER. A small piece to an incredible discography of the soft, weird?, genius, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, nuts, Danny Johnston. He will forever be a trembling and smiling face in my memory. This album or anything hes ever recorded will soundtrack your romance, your anytime-crisis, and your hungriest moments. Let him shed his light upon you. BUY THIS and then hug your friend, take the walk take the toad way be kind, be primal! Sing your heart out! R.I.P to THE MAN WHO KILLED THE MONSTER! - Molly Boris\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nRotten Bun for an Eggless Century by Mui Zyu (2023)\n\nFinding oneself and self purpose, that is one of the most treacherous and personal journeys anyone of us could embark on. Rotten Bun for an Eggless Century is a telling of Mui Zyus (Eva Liu) said journey. The album is a dreamy, atmospheric telling of Mui Zyu's quest drenched in reverb and accompanied by lofi drum tracks. The most interesting thing about Rotten Buns sound is the use of traditional chinese instrumentation run through various effects units. The majority of songs start off simple enough with a single instrument with vocals and a beat, then will morph into something greater entirely, usually with a wall of sound, distorted guitars, and detuned pianos. Just by your first listen, you can tell this album is extremely personal to Eva Liu and her struggles, and this album perfectly encapsulates those feelings and emotions. I think most of us could find some relation to Evas struggles and identify with her struggles. My suggestion is to take time to actually sit down. Focus on the music by yourself free from distractions and become fully engrossed in the music and journey though this Lo Fi Bedroom pop dreamscape. You wont regret it. - Grant\n\nUnicorn by GUNSHIP (2023)\n\nI can make you feel alive. For any fans of synthwave or nostalgic 80s music, then GUNSHIP might ring a bell or two. Formed in the UK in 2014, GUNSHIP helped pioneer what the synthwave genre would become known as today. Unicorn is the group's 3rd full length album, and the sounds of the 80s radiate as bright as ever with some twists here and there. Featuring a number of collaborators such as Power Glove, Carpenter Brut, and HEALTH just to name a few. These collaborators help bring the 80s synth wave sound some edge to them. Using various effects to make the bass line stand out more and sounding more gritty and sharp. This album has just the right amount of fast-paced synthwave action paralleled to the more downtempo tracks to keep you invested and keep you going at the gym. (Seriously this is a fantastic album to jam at the gym to). - Grant\n\nMichael by Killer Mike (2023)\n\nGrab a drink of your choice and listen carefully to the words, nay the lyrical poetry, flowing from the lips of the illustrious Killer Mike a.k.a. Michael [Render]. Last time he released a solo album was back in 2012, R.A.P. Music: a record that sparked a long-standing partnership with El-P, which in turn sparked the super duo Run The Jewels. 11 years later and Killer Mike is, once again, in the front seat riding solo all-the-while exorcizing the (childhood) demons that define his identity outside the stage and the fame: Michael. Curiously, right around 53 minutes and 51 seconds after the last chords hum into ones subconscious, one cant help but come to the conclusion that this is a harrowing and enlightening musical experience you cant walk out unscathed without shedding some tears, taking your hat off, and screaming into the void: Keep your eyes on the prize and don't let the devil coerce you!\n\nHighlights:\n\n-DOWN BY LAW (Feat. CeeLo Green)\n\n-SHED TEARS (Feat. Mozzy & Lena Bird Myles)\n\n-RUN (Feat. Young Thug)\n\n-NRICH (Feat. 6LACK & Eryn Allen Kaye)\n\n-TALKN THAT SHIT!\n\n-SCIENTISTS & ENGINEERS (Feat. André 3000, Eryn Allen Kaye, & Future)\n\n-DONT LET THE DEVIL (Feat. El-P & thankugoodsir)\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nSíntesis Moderna: An Alternative Vision Of Argentinean Music 1980-1990 by Various Artists\n\nThe 80s are, indisputably, one of the decades that forever changed the way we see (and read) the world today. Although, one could argue for hours on end about the impact it had with the World, as a whole; I think the biggest impact, on this Western side of the hemisphere, was in Latin America. Granted, Latin America has always been a fertile ground: a sort of imaginarium locus from which, ironically-speaking, magical realism flows from whether it be in the pages of a novel (see Gabriel Garcia Marquezs One Hundred Years of Solitude) or through coup d'états (e.g. Chile 1973). Yet, for all its enchantment and all its many offerings one cant deny the musical footprint Argentinians left in the 80s. Sure, I could talk ad nauseum about the Latin American version of The Beatles (i.e. Soda Stereo) and all the bands that shaped Rock En Español but I would be doing a disservice at shedding a light on artists that fell in the shadows of those titans. Hence, not only this review but this mixtape: a collection of 19 songs from different artists that perfectly synthesizes (pun intended) in 1 hour and 38 minutes not only why representation matters but why Latinos do it better\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Carlos Curia Operativo\n\n- El Signo Dimensiones Ocultas ( Ric Picolo Edit)\n\n-Ultimate Warriors Running Away with You\n\n-Toby Aint That Better (Harari Edit)\n\n-The Originals Vamos A La Playa\n\n-Los Músicos del Centro Esquirlas\n\n-Divina Gloria Mediterranée Club\n\n-Delight I Wanna Make You Mine\n\n-Bad Girls Dance To Dance\n\n-Carla Rab Sexy Films\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nI'd Be Lying If I Said I Didn't Care by Hannah Georgas (2023)\n\nId be lyin if the next words out of this review were to say that I didnt care for Hannah Georgas latest outing, I'd Be Lying If I Said I Didn't Care (2023). Oh, no, quite the opposite: these 12 songs hide a garden of emotions that await the hunger of readily-abled hearts and ears to hear (and feel!), as well as thump to the drum of her confessions. From the opening verse on Scratch (Start from scratch/How do I do that/How do I make sense of everything I thought I had) to the last recorded sounds on Keep Telling Yourself (I feel like I'm fighting/And I'm in a ring and everyones watching/Everyone's watching), this record feels as though it was recorded through the lattice of confessional booth  and rightfully so. For the better part of 40 minutes and 43 seconds she creates an imaginarium where she carves out a myriad of questions and feelings we have all felt at one moment in time, one way or another\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Scratch\n\n-What I Dont Want\n\n-Better Somehow\n\n-Beautiful View\n\n-Not The Name You Say\n\n-Fake Happy\n\n-Keep Telling Yourself\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nHomogenic by Bjork (1997)\n\nThis is an album that sonically replicates the volcanic, porous black stone, malleable and molten, erupting with emotion in the extreme. With her third solo album, Björk has done it once again: put those slippery indescribable feelings into song. Take her for no fool; she is as straightforward and cognisant of what she is saying as she ever was. Additionally, one of her primary intentions was to honor the Icelandic landscape she hails from, both in the sounds she used and her lyrics.\n\nAnyones emotional fallout will be properly chaperoned by Homogenic, the chorus of strings carrying the heart and the shearing drums holding up the spine  and, of course, her caterwauling serving as a spirited champion for the impassioned. We even hear glimpses of her playing with the delicate microbeats that would later feature in Vespertine in tracks like \"Hunter.\" Pluto does right by those experiences that shake the core, smashing tectonic plates. Five Years features Bjork at perhaps her most biting: I dare you to take me on. Overall, the skipping, glitchy electronic rhythm pairs graciously with frank and sincere timbres throughout this album and delivers a master thesis to us all: to be loved is to be changed. - Eva Nova\n\nShaw Scope Vol. 1 boxset (2021)\n\nAll you need is this Shaw Scope Vol 1 boxset by Arrow Films and a copy of 36th Chamber (and if you ask me, a copy of My Young Auntie with the greatest female martial arts star in Hong Kong history, Kara Wai/Hui) and you have a very nice Shaw Brothers Collection going. Without even trying too hard!!\n\nThis collection has 12 of the Shaw Brothers' (Runje, Runme, Runde, and Run Run) best features in the correct aspect ratio, many with new or recent transfers. Standouts Five (Deadly) Venoms, Dirty Ho (pronounced more like \"khuh\" than \"ho\". It is a character's name), Crippled Avengers, and Five Shaolin Masters are easily some of the best kung-fu films ever made. And the rest of them are damn good. Mainly representing the work of two of SB's most successful directors, Chang Cheh and Lau Kar-Leung (Liu Chia-Liang), the films were all made in the 70s which was the heyday of early HK cinema. The outlier in this set is Mighty Peking Man which was an attempt by SB to capitalize on the giant monster craze. But it's so weird and fun that Quentin Tarantino actually released it on VHS at some point in the past. So it doesn't really detract from the set.\n\nThe box set itself is beautifully done with the outer skin being that weird blue Florentine privacy glass (?) that is shown behind the SB logo at the beginning of every movie. Inside a 60-page oversized booklet provides details on the movies and many, many articles about stars, directors etc. And the discs are held in a very cool hardbound caddy that sports new artwork for every movie.\n\nAll in all an amazing first entry in their Shaw Brothers series by Arrow Films. I would expect nothing less from them. - Corby\n\nShaw Scope Vol. 2 boxset (2022)\n\nShaw Scope Volume 2 is here!!! And it really completes the set when paired with Volume 1. You get another 14 great movies, several from the mid to late Shaw Brothers period, 9 of which are beautiful new transfers. This includes all 3 of the Lau Kar-Leung/Gordon Liu 36 Chambers movies, Kara Hui/Wais hilarious My Young Auntie (also directed by Lau), 4 Venom Mob flicks (including the fantastic Ten Tigers From Kwangtung), The Boxers Omen (a black-magic horror/action movie with no equal), Martial Arts Of Shaolin, the last major Shaw production featuring, at the time, brand new action hero Jet Li, and a few more great films. Plus the same beautiful packaging of Volume 1, including gobs of extra features, interviews, featurettes, soundtrack CDs, etc. And of course owning this gorgeous boxes set will make your Qong Fu much more powerful, regardless of what style you practice. - Corby\n\nAugust 2023\n\nTime Will Wait For No One by Local Natives (2023)\n\nGiven our current state of affairs (i.e. economically, meteorologically, and politically-wise), better words havent been professed: Time Will Wait For No One. These are the opening words (lyrics?) to Local Natives latest outing, 2023s Time Will Wait For No One: a call to action or an open letter to commiserate as lifes hourglass runs out of sand? Lets explore.\n\nLast we heard from the California quintet was back in 2019 with Violet Street: a record adorned with lush vocal arrangements and packed with a plethora of metaphors that would make a grown man cry for not being able to paint such lyrical soundscapes. Fast-forward to the Present, and goddammit (in a good, positive way!), theyve managed to not only create another masterpiece of a record, but a soundtrack to a season. Suffice to say, their direction and focus on this record is different yet familiar: international obstacles to sharing common ground forced them to be absent not only from their fan bases hearts and ears but from themselves. Yet, the end results were something that I  who has been a fan of their discography ever since they burst on the musical scene with their 2010 debut, Gorilla Manor  did not expect! Im short, this record is the equivalent of a refreshing spritz on a hot Summer day! Now, I wouldn't go as far as to calling them 21st century miracle workers of modern Indie music, but I will say, Im incredibly happy to have found them, once again, shining bright with vim and vigor and an open invitation for all: 'Cause time will wait for no one/But I'll wait for you.\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Time Will Wait For No One\n\n-Just Before The Morning\n\n-Paper Lanterns\n\n-Desert Snow\n\n-Featherweight\n\n-Ava\n\n-Paradise\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nAura by Bajofondo (2019)\n\nRiddle me this: the year is 2023 and someone has just told you about an Argentine-Uruguayan octet. Their name? Bajofondo (roughly translated: the Shallows  although theres nothing superficial about them). Genre? Even the jury is out on that one (including God himself). Yet, there are those who brave the task of defining them and say that their music is a modern take on Tango. Personally, I think theyre closer to a découpé: an aleatory, yet metaphorical, conundrum that sums-up all the different genres that exist and make Latin America the melting pot of cultures it is. Therefore, one could come to the conclusion that their album Aura was not created with the intention of whittling an hour and ten minutes of your time, but rather invest it in something that will make you come-alive. Thus, untangle the webs of preconceived perceptions and sail away into a path of discovery  I promise, you wont see the genre Latin Music the same.\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Solari Yacumenza (Feat. Cuareim 1080)\n\n-Clueca La Cueca\n\n-Espiral\n\n-A Las Siete\n\n-A Tiempo (Feat. Usted Señalemelo)\n\n-Absente\n\n-Bailarín\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nSecond Life by Jaws Of Love. (2022)\n\nBreathing in a new mentality; finding purpose  a second lease on life  among the trenches of a worldwide-fatal topsy-turvy. That is what Kelcey Ayer of Local Natives explores through his sophomore record, aptly titled, Second Life (2022). Here are 10 tracks that blur the lines between guard and prisoner: while some songs haunt you into the echoes of your subconscious, others seek to weather the storm and shelter us. For 45 minutes one cant help but fall  enchanted  into the jaws of life. Once again, Ayer has found an outlet to house his creativity and made a record from which the listener cant walk out unscathed  similar to his 2017 debut, Tasha Sits Close To The Piano.\n\nHighlights:\n\n-1000 Years\n\n-Angelica\n\n-Guard & Prisoner (Feat. Omotola)\n\n-Rainbow Baby\n\n-Rachel Takes A Bath\n\n-5 Years (Feat. Combat!)\n\n-100 Years\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nJuly 2023\n\nThe Artist in the Ambulance by Thrice (Revisited for its 20th Anniversary, 2023)\n\nRecently, my mentor and friend, Patrick Floyd, said: Time is the only thing we have scarcity of  This, in turn, made me wonder: What if the clocks hands fell still: what would the remains of ones days say? This prerogative took even more influence as Thrice announced the re-release of their 2003 career-defining record, The Artist In The Ambulance, aptly titled, The Artist In The Ambulance (Revisited). My mind couldnt help but wander 20 years later, and upon hearing the first 10 seconds of Cold Cash And Colder Hearts, both my heart and my mind were sent into a whirlwind of emotions Instantly, I was back in time, lost in a bout of nostalgia: rediscovering a long, forgotten treasure amongst familiar faces and voices (i.e. friends and family)... The floodgates of my memories washed me to the shores of the question that birthed them. My answer? If I were to part from this world as Im writing these words, I would have 12 songs (41 mins and 18 seconds to be exact) that would best encapsulate my existence  I would feel like the Artist in the ambulance of Thrices song: heard and seen.\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Cold Cash And Colder Hearts\n\n-Silhouette\n\n-Stare At The Sun (Feat. Andy Hull)\n\n-Paper Tigers (Feat. Holy Fawn)\n\n-Blood Clots And Black Holes (Feat. Hot Water Music)\n\n-The Artist In The Ambulance\n\n-The Abolition Of Man (Feat. Curl Up And Die)\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nSoda Stereo by Soda Stereo (1984)\n\nIts always interesting to sonically go back in time and hear an artists rise to fame. Enter Gustavo Cerati, Zeta Bosio, and Charly Alberti: a.k.a Soda Stereo.\n\nWhat began in the 50s, with the rattle of a guitar and the hum of a bass alongside a beating drums tempo, marinated all over the silhouette of the Americas until it unspooled its roots to the fertile grounds of South America. All these travails lead us to the origin of our review: 1984; where a power trio with a healthy dose of attitude (along with other fixings) emerged from Argentina, and you will know them by the trail of Aqua Net. Fast forward to the Present, to the offices of the Hall of Fame where theyre interviewing witnesses who lived through the intoxication to tell the tale. The stories all concur: Soda Stereo revolutionized the way we now  four decades hence  see and hear Rock En Español; this record was their humble stepping stone to a path of immortality.\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Por Qué No Puedo Ser De Jet Set?\n\n-Sobredosis de T.V.\n\n-Trátame Suavemente\n\n-Tele-Ka\n\n-Un Misil En Mi Placard\n\n-Afrodisíacos\n\n-Mi Novia Tiene Biceps\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nLevitation Sessions by Mint Field (2022)\n\nWith two records under their belt  Pasar De Las Luces (2018) and Sentimiento Mundial (2020)  Mexican trio, Mint Field, dropped their haunting Levitation Sessions (2022): 11 songs, 46 minutes and 58 seconds of pure-ethereal-shoegazing bliss that would turn a pagan into a believer. Right from the opening chords of Jardín De La Paz to the closing hum of Present, you cant help but feel beguiled: lulled into a dreamscape from which one wouldnt  and/or shouldnt  escape... Shucks, Id be surprised if by the time you finish listening to this record you havent reached a heightened sense of sonic enlightenment  yes, it is that life changing!\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Jardín De La Paz\n\n-Sentimiento Mundial\n\n-Delicadeza\n\n-No Te Caigas\n\n-Nadie Te Esta Persiguiendo\n\n-Quiero Otoño De Nuevo\n\n-Presente\n\n-J Guillermo Paleo\n\nIn Times New Roman by Queens Of The Stone Age (2023)\n\nAnd on Friday, June 16th, Apollo  the God of Music  (re)introduced Queens Of The Stone Age into the musical discourse: at last, a band who is not afraid to boogie! (Yes, I am aware of the word I employed to describe them, rest assured, its not a typo ) I cant stress how much this amplifies my emotional state for I would need a venue (preferably Red Rocks) to house my élan vital. I explain: its been 6 years since we were last graced with their musings, Villains (2017), and in their radio silence we were suddenly invited to the nearest dance floor with the release of their single Emotion Sickness. Thankfully, the wait wasnt long; before one could break the fever of their lyrics or learn a choreography, their record arrived and, man, what a way to welcome the Summer season.\n\nHighlights:\n\n-Obscenery\n"
