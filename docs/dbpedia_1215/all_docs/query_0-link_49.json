        "text": "Back in the 1990s, New Zealand band, The Bats, rose to prominence on the international stage. Like many other bands of that era, from that relatively small country, they had an outsized influence on many others. It’s hard to talk about New Zealand’s music scene and not mention Split Endz and the Finn Brothers. I think we should speak of Robert Scott in the same way when we think of the list of great NZ musicians.\n\nI’m not here to write of his output with The Bats, but to look at his solo work. In particular, I want to go back a decade to Scott’s album, The Green House. While his solo work can sometimes be quite experimental, this one is pretty straightforward alternative indie rock/pop. Yet, it bears all the hallmarks of Scott’s talents as a songwriter – top-tapping melodies, atmospheric instrumentation and his exemplary guitar work.\n\nThe album opener, Lights Are Low, is all moody picked guitar and the haunting vocals of Hollie Fullbrook from Tiny Ruins, who, incidentally, adds her voice to five of the The Green House’s 12 tracks. It is a song that sets the scene for the rest of the album. You might be getting songs that on the surface are just great pop songs, but they’ll sink into your psyche and stick there, finding ways to affect you when you least expect it. That’s the magic of Robert Scott, right there.\n\nIt’s not all acoustic wonderment, either. Vertigo, finishing off the first quarter of the album, could easily sit among the output of current indie faves, The Reds, Pinks and Purples. Glenn Donaldson’s band is probably a good contemporary comparison, although there’s also a seam of darkness that keeps bubbling up in The Green House. The jangle pop of Scott’s other bands is put aside here, swapped out for a harder edged and layered soundscape.\n\nScott’s 30+ years’ experience of being in bands and writing songs really shows, as each of these songs showcases a songwriter who not only still at the top of their game but is able to wrong foot the listener with creative compositional flourishes that keep you listening. They’re the sort of musical switches that make you think, “Damn, I wasn’t expecting that!” He’s a master.\n\nThe richness of NZ’s folk scene is also present here. Following on from the beautiful instrumental, Favourite Case, comes another track which features Hollie’s contrasting voice, Now In Your Hands. It’s probably one of the most straightforward songs on the album, yet in any other hands it would be merely good. With Scott’s deftness as a writer, guitarist and singer, so it becomes great.\n\nIt’s Scott’s voice that makes this album so listenable, really. It’s understated. It’s a vehicle for this lyrics, sure, but it’s dripping with emotional intent. There’s a weight to it, even though it’s actually quite fragile and dropped down in the mix. In this way, it reminds me of Sune Rose Wagner of The Raveonettes (if he was to sing with Sharin Foo in an alt-country, folk style). If it wasn’t there you’d be wondering what was missing. This is most obvious on Hear The Hondas, which has a simple melody picked out on the guitar, the vocals carefully laid atop almost as an afterthought. And yet. Using overdubs, Scott manages to create a soothing complexity, so warm and inviting you want to bathe in it.\n\nI think, in all honesty, what I’m describing is a New Zealand sound. Despite no accent to pick up on, I reckon I could place the origin of Scott’s music on first listen. As you come over the ridge of the guitar riff on Where The Frost Lies, for example, the drums make you stop and take in the view, as it were. Another instrumental that somehow bottles the feeling of the place in which it was made and brings it to you through the magic of audio.\n\nAnd with that, you slip beneath the surface of the final track, Right From Wrong, and suddenly you’re cocooned in more of Scott’s folk splendour. Probably one of simplest tracks of the entire record, it’s the perfect way bring your listening to a close. There’s no fade out, though. It’s Robert Scott doing what Robert Scott does best – an unexpected ending as the final plucks of his guitar strings stop a bar or two earlier than a lesser musician might choose. Yet, it is of course, the perfect way to draw this listening experience to a close.\n\nThe Green House by Robert Scott\n\nThis post feels a little self-indulgent. And I suppose it is. However, with little to celebrate these days in the UK, I’m taking this opportunity to give a little ‘whoop’ of delight and to write up the experience of having an idea and then making it happen. So, you’ll have to either indulge me or stop reading! 😊\n\nIt’s been a year. A whole 12 months. 366 days.\n\nWow.\n\nI’ve had to take in a deep breath, as it still feels like yesterday when I had an initial idea and told Danny and Tom, suggesting we got together and did something, perhaps a listening party of some sort. It was a crap idea, though. But the name, Unspun Heroes, seemed great fun and really spoke to me! On the walk into my local town centre about two weeks later, that crap idea became this thing:\n\nTo find and highlight music deserving of wider attention. Where possible, to release this music on vinyl, in small batches of no more than 500. And to do that with love.\n\nI wrote that in a Notes file on my phone that day. The mission hasn’t changed. Every single time I listen to something – or someone approaches me about a possible release – I use it as the guiding principle. Because it is the guiding principle. It means I give a shit about every aspect, whether writing a blog post or sourcing paper stock for inserts, to how someone experiences it when they open the parcel in their own home.\n\nTalk, though, is easy, Taking action is quite a big step. Until you tell people what you’re doing. Then you have to get on with it. There is expectation (and probably quite a few people who expect you to fail, are literally waiting for it). There is accountability.\n\nMost of all, though, there is trepidation. I’d never done anything like this before. My day job is as far away from music, or producing and selling physical products, as you can get. Although, music is something I love. I can’t imagine not enjoying it, not listening to new music and to music I’ve enjoyed for decades, music my parents listened to, music I discovered with my friends, music I bought and music gifted to me.\n\nI’ve always loved finding new music – by which I mean, music I’ve not heard before. I’m not someone who harks back to their favourite music of their youth and only plays that (although I should point out if that’s you then I think that’s all good and I hope it brings you plenty of joy). I will, as my family and friends will confirm, listen to just about anything and probably enjoy it. So, the idea of listening to music that deserves wider attention means I have to step outside my usual playlists, to ask a wide and diverse range of people about what they like. To put my judgement to one side for at least 30 minutes.\n\nThen I can write about it, for the blog.\n\nWeekly… nah\n\nI tried to write a blog each week. When there were others helping, in the early weeks, that was possible. But asking people to write stuff for free only works for so long. After a while writing a blog post each week started to feel like a chore, which went against the mission. The love wasn’t there. So, some weeks there is nothing; some weeks you get two or more posts.\n\nThe important thing is that the posts match up to the mission.\n\nAnd because they do, I find it pays dividends. I can get a sense of what other people like, obviously; however, it allows me to start a conversation with musicians and bands. They already know I love what they’ve done and, if the album hasn’t ever been out on vinyl, it helps them consider if they’d be up for pressing some.\n\nThen we have a chat or three. Which is lovely. Who doesn’t like chatting to musicians you admire about music you love? Without exception, every artist I’ve spoken to, even if they’ve said no (or the record company has said no) has been fabulous. The music industry – the part I’m dealing with – has been wonderful. As has ‘music Twitter’. I feel like I’ve made some long-lasting connections in this first year. And I’ve been introduced to so much music I might never have heard, it can feel like a full-time job listening to it all. But what a job!\n\nHow does a job like that pay?\n\nMoney, money, money…\n\nSomeone once said, the best way to lose money is to press vinyl. Quite possibly true.\n\nThe business model means I take on all the risk. It’s my money. All of it. Everyone involved gets paid by me. If I sell enough, I’ll make my money back and the rest is shared equally with the artist.\n\nAnd it is just me.\n\nI will admit that it’s scary. It’s probably not the right way to do it, either. I do think it focuses the mind, and helps with decisions about design and packaging. It helps determine where compromises will be made – which won’t be quality, that’s for sure. I want every release to bring the wow factor for the listening experience and the unpacking. All while trying to keep costs down for the buyer.\n\nHonestly, I think I’ve sunk in somewhere around £10,000 (I could put the actual costs in, but that ballpark is close enough to give you a sense of how invested I’ve become). That includes branding and trademarks, upfront costs for albums that have been and are being manufactured, warehousing, etc. Yikes. However, if I sell them all, I’ll have paid that back and have enough set aside to pay for some extras on the next one.\n\nAnd now I’m selling the records I’ve pressed, that amount will fall. It already has. Hopefully, I’ll sell them all and I can keep on bringing albums that deserve wider attention to the market and we can all win.\n\n(A little reminder that you can shop at the Unspun Heroes’ Bandcamp store – or ask your local indie store to get you a copy.)\n\nIt takes how long?\n\nMaking things takes time. More time than you might think. Especially when it’s just one person managing the process. There have been months of discussions with artists, there is the lead time for pressing, design and print to consider, and posting things around the world to be signed (for example)… A lot of threads need to come together at the right time to make sure the distributor has the items ready to get to stores for a pre-agreed release date.\n\nAnd stuff goes wrong. Print turns up and it’s wrong. Designs need updating and images can’t be found because the album came out twenty years ago. New liner notes need to be written and the first draft is late or doesn’t cut it, or we can’t find the right person to write them. Yet, with that love and some perseverance, somehow it all works out.\n\nThen there is the wait while the wonderful team at the pressing plant pack up the records and ship them to me, and to the distributor.\n\nYes, there are test pressings, artwork proofs, lots of video calls and phone calls. Lots of the time, though, is just silence. And yet you have to be telling people what they can expect. There are press releases to organise, press packs to send out, photos to take or mock up. There is always something to do and then suddenly your family home is full of boxes and boxes: records, mailers, packing tape, obi strips, inserts, and boxes of boxes. So. Many. Boxes.\n\nWhat this means is, I won’t be releasing ten albums a year (at least, not yet!) and will probably limit it to two releases across a 12-month period; one in the spring and one in the late summer or autumn. Build a foundation and work up from there.\n\n(I have 36 34 rolls of branded packing tape, so I think I need to use that up before I even think about stopping.)\n\nAgain?\n\nThe first release has felt like a baptism of fire. I’ve probably made lots of mistakes, but it’s been a lot of fun. Most of the time. At the time of writing, sales figures haven’t been tallied, but the last two weeks feels like it has been successful – there are records leaving my house every week and I’ve had some wonderful reviews – from stores, from magazines and online sites, and from customers. I’ve loved sending them out, each one with a little bit of personalisation. And the branded tape (probably one of my favourite things).\n\nAll this shipping has been happening while I’ve been dealing with the second release, and setting up the third and fourth releases. There are two other possible further releases sat in the sidelines, too.\n\nI have to realise that I’m selling records that people don’t necessarily know, so it’s a tough job but… but I’m doing this with love and I think that caring about the release – how it looks, how it sounds, what the unboxing experience is like, how it unfolds and feels in your hands. Not cutting corners and not pushing for profit alone.\n\nI want to feel proud of the releases that Unspun Heroes puts out. And I do.\n\nI’m even more proud of the second release that’s coming up. There are some aspects of it that haven’t been done before (because they cost more money). It has a signed variant. The insert is really special (which is saying something considering that the insert on the James Varda is almost a metre of print when you open it out). And the band that are involved are amazing. Lovely people who made brilliant music – and continue to make brilliant music – and have trusted me with their art.\n\nMore on that later.\n\nOkay, let’s wrap this up\n\nWhile there is only me, I’m not on my own. I’ve got my great friends singing my praises and supporting me. My family are incredibly supportive (despite the boxes). I’ve said that music Twitter has been amazing and those who moved over to other social media platforms continue to be a source of inspiration.\n\nThe indie labels are also brilliantly supportive. They’ve shared tips and ideas. I hope that, in some way, I have helped to inspire them (or will do at some point).\n\nIndie stores, too. I’ve decided not to sell through certain large online retailers because my own experience of buying from them means I don’t think they share the same mission when it comes to Unspun Heroes. It may prove to be a terrible commercial decision, but I’ll take that risk.\n\nThe music press. Not everyone has taken a risk and written about the label or its first release. That’s hard to take, but I also see how much amazing music comes out each week and so I can live with that. I’m not looking to disappear any time soon, so as word spreads so I hope that I’ll get to know the journalists and magazine editors a little better. The music they share and the words they write are inspiring enough. Those who have written reviews have said things that literally brough a tear to my eye. (If you are a journalist or reviewer and had no idea about what I’m doing, drop me a hello and let’s chat.)\n\nCustomers. Until you have one there’s a fear that no one will buy. I’ve been buoyed by the number of deluxe editions that I’ve sold so far. 500 records probably doesn’t seem like many, but I can tell you that even when it’s 300 that’s a scary number of records to sell. I have faith in what I’m trying to do and that others will understand that and buy into it.\n\nWhile it might be true that I’m my own first customer, I am doing this because I think other people will also want a copy of an album that they may never have heard of until I pointed them in its direction. I’ll learn soon enough when I get my distribution figures.\n\nSo, if you’ve been involved in some way over the past year – as a reader, a shouter-from-the-sidelines, a distributor of physical records or website links, selling in store, buying a copy of Chance And Time, or simply telling other people about Unspun Heroes whenever the opportunity arises, then I want to say a huge thank you.\n\n>>THANK YOU<<\n\nHere’s to the next release, and the release after that…\n\nI suppose, with so much new music constantly being released, being late to discover a band can happen. Though, the two decades since this album’s release might be starting to be unfashionably late to the party. However, when it comes to discovering hidden gems that deserve wider attention, as is the raison d’être of Unspun Heroes, time doesn’t really matter. It’s much more about that moment where you hear something and want to share it with the world. This was the case the first time I heard an album that came out in 2003.\n\nTen Songs by Assistant.\n\nAlmost exactly 21 years ago, a young band from Brighton put out their first album. And while the name may not win awards for inventiveness, they made music that would have broken through had it been recorded 10-15 years previously. In 2003, the world was listening to indie rock, with Muse, The White Stripes, Radiohead and their ilk, as well as the likes of Jay-Z and Outkast. It wasn’t listening to jangly indie pop that draws influences from Stereolab, Felt, and Galaxie 500. Certainly not en masse.\n\nA real shame, for us and for Assistant.\n\nFast forward to 2024, however, and things are about to change (as you’ll see).\n\nI heard of the band only a few months ago, via social media. I’d seen a Tweet about jangly pop and, because listening to lots of music is good to do, particularly when it’s new to you, I gave their debut LP a spin on Bandcamp. Now, I am a fan of the writer, John Wyndham, so the opening song has the right title for me. However, it was the second track, Freaks, that absolutely caught my ear. That catchy bass hook! The noisy guitar that comes to the front of the mix! The vocalist who doesn’t try too hard to ‘sing’ the song. It felt like I was in the best years of my youth rather than the later years of middle age. It’s right up my rue, as they say en France.\n\nYes, it’s jangly indie, but it has an edge to it that, to my mind, puts it in that sort of early nineties musical neighbourhood. There’s that DIY element to the songs, which gives them a real personality that polished production might rub away. No-one need ever know, is a straight up pop hit, despite its rather downcast lyrics. In fact, all the songs have that sort of pop feel to them, like a lot of songs by The Smiths always did. And while I don’t think there is any more of a comparison here, the songwriting definitely feels like it owes a tip of the hat to Stephen Morrissey, as well as Damon Albarn, and Crispin Hunt.\n\nThe album has many surprises hidden in plain sight. I’ve already mentioned the bass hooks that are given a lot of room to shine on every track, as they should be. But I wasn’t prepared for the boogie-woogie piano riff halfway through Bomber, for example, yet it feels like the song simply wouldn’t work without it. Because of that, this has quickly become one of my favourite tracks.\n\nAcross Ten Songs, you’re left with the feeling you’ve heard a band’s sound mature across an album rather than a career. As the album winds into its closing numbers, so the vibe becomes much more chilled. This definitely gives you an idea of where the band ultimately headed, especially with songs they recorded in 2020. You’ll get more introspective jangle pop on closing song, Reasoned,than edgy indie, although Get Away has that Hot Hot Heat vibe, and Losing My Mind soundslike it’s been made in some NYC-Manchester hybrid rather than a British seaside resort.\n\nBrighton has always delivered musically. The scene in the city of Brighton and Hove is hot right now – my (current and ever-changing) picks are Porridge Radio, Opus Kink, KEG, DITZ and Dream Wife, but let’s not forget Blood Red Shoes, Electrelane, 14 Iced Bears… (Oh, the list is too long I’ll have to make a playlist.) Whatever. The point is, I think Assistant deserves a spot on that list.\n\nTen Songs is the perfect place to start.\n\nTen Songs by Assistant\n\nThe following has been written by Jonathan, the vocalist for Assistant. We met in a Brighton coffee shop to chat about life, music, the late 90s… and about how life can change when you let go of the things that might have once held you back.\n\n23 years ago, I appealed, via a Brighton forum on a distant version of the internet, for people “with no musical talent”. I had just moved to Brighton and wanted to form a band. I had written a song, so it seemed like a good idea. My Assistant bandmates, Pete and Anne-Sophie both replied and, for the last twenty-odd years, whenever life has allowed us, we’ve written songs together or with each other in mind – more recently taking it in turns to share the load, iron the songs out, record them, embellish and improve them.\n\nFrom time to time I write in Brighton, scrabbling at my guitar while my toddlers busy themselves around my feet. Over in Oxford, Pete writes songs daily, and for Pete they flow out steadily, a kind of diary-keeping. He keeps most for himself and will occasionally say ‘this is for Assistant’, and once he’s done that a few times the odd alchemy of making a collection of songs begins, with left-field ambushes from Anne-Sophie, who chips in with her own surprising, inscrutable demos.\n\nAs our songs come together, we begin to swap ideas for album titles, sleeve designs, concepts. Pete’s songs are pure of expression. My songs come less easily and are generally autobiography which is then clothed in a disguise of vagueness. I’m not always sure I know what I want my songs to be doing, so they often exist in many variations for months and even years, until I find a variant that I’m happy with. Pete is decisive and sure of touch. I am much less so, my clumsy fingers conjuring many flimsy takes, so Pete will often send me emails with subject lines like ‘new album?’, wondering if we’re done.\n\nHowever, I like to sit on the songs for so long that I almost forget where they come from. I forget how to play them. And then I start to reassemble them, swapping stuff out, changing something here, there. Eventually, at some point, they are finished. But since we reformed properly, in 2020, we have tended towards doing almost nothing with our songs at this point. They go up on Bandcamp, very quietly, where they sit undiscovered. Once I sent an email to the host of my favourite radio show – Josh Meadows – who cheerfully played us four times. I learned absolutely nothing from this. Months passed.\n\nSince 2020 we have made three albums this way; collated by post, assembled slowly. The songs have become increasingly personal and important to us. And I think of each of these Assistant albums (one is unreleased) as finished, whole, totally real. Our own art. But it’s not often I will mention them to anyone. A few friends know and are supportive – but they are not really fans of the music. So the songs just sit there.\n\n–\n\nPerhaps we are an imaginary band? I like to think of us that way. I can see us low-down on the bill supporting Felt or The Servants in a London Polytechnic in 1987. Or we might have squeezed a song onto a compilation album alongside an early Electric Soft Parade demo or a Young Knives b-side. We played some really great gigs in Brighton and London in the early 2000s, in fact, but we were quite drunk and they’re harder to remember than I’d like.\n\nAt Christmas this year, I suddenly thought: “I’ll tell everyone about our band”. So I created a Twitter account and began sharing songs that we’d written alongside some little reviews of records I liked and videos from YouTube. This is where things started getting a bit weird. With remarkable speed, people began listening! Not only did they listen, but they told me they liked the songs, and even began referencing back my very favourite artists too. My imaginary band was flickering into life, and it made me very happy.\n\nPete and Anne-So were completely disbelieving. “Who are these people????” Anne-Sophie would say. “We are becoming a cult band”.\n\nWe are probably still way too small to be a cult band, but then… but then I am suddenly filled with a giddy conviction that we are indeed going to become a cult band. “We’re the new Blue Orchids”, I tell myself, as I click on our Bandcamp stats to see that, somehow, we got 30,40,60, even 100 plays that day. It is not much, really, but it is really really really exciting. I squint and try to imagine our audience.\n\nThe lesson, I suspect, is that lots of people out there really love pop music, and feel the same way about it as I do – they chase that delightful moment of discovery, that instance of recognition when you hear a song and think “oh, I get what they’re trying to do here”. As a few people tune in, I’m getting that mirrored back to me after years of celebrating the weird little songs that crept into my life. Music is so great – the rush which heralds the discovery of a great new song is a feeling almost completely unchanged from all the way back then – back when I was sat in my bedroom in 1994 staring at a wall of Blur posters. A new song to love is like receiving a kiss.\n\nAnd I discover, too, that some people are just incredibly nice. They will be insanely generous with their time and energy, going out of their way to share the things you share, to recommend you, even get you played on the radio. People have gone out of their way, which I did not expect at all. This small thing which is happening to Assistant is so wildly great and totally unexpected, so tremendously nice. And in the meantime, all of a sudden, I am discovering wonderful bands left right and centre, and exchanging messages with them as if I too am in a band – a real one, not an imaginary one. It’s flipping great.\n\nThe work of art you make has so much more value than you think it does, especially if it is made with love. I think in retrospect it’s probably for the best that I am not (or was not) ambitious about having an audience, as it has allowed me to enjoy making art without needing to improve, or break out, or face the horror of criticism, either. But now I am telling people, and will do so until they tell me to stop.\n\nIf you make stuff, I really, really recommend telling people about your art, even if, like me, you have to do it through a veil of very British irony and embarrassment. You deserve the thrill of having your work noticed. I wish I had done it earlier.\n\nUPDATE: Since this piece was written Assistant have signed a record deal and are releasing their two most recent LPs through Subjangle on the 21st April.\n\nThere have been more than a few occasions where I’m had to admit I had things wrong, that I’d had preconceptions that had held me back. And many times I’ve been proven wrong in my assumptions. I’m happy to admit it. This is one of those times.\n\nAnd, whoa, how happy I am to be proved wrong.\n\nIn my defence, I’m a person who will give any music its due. Sometimes, I have to be doing something else when I listen to an album I don’t know, to let it infuse itself into my brain like a melodic marinade. This is one such time. I’ve had this album playing while I’ve been doing other things. But each time I’m stopped in my tracks by it.\n\nThis could be called Americana, country-folk, or whatever label you care to drop on a style of music. However, like a lot of these labels, it falls short when it comes to Drink Ring Jesus by Stephen Simmons. Listening to this album is like a searing knife through flesh it cuts into a part of me that I can’t begin to describe. The eponymously named opening track literally brought tears to my eyes when I first heard it, and that hasn’t diminished through the several plays I’ve gone through since I first pressed play on Stephen’s Bandcamp page.\n\nAnd it doesn’t relinquish its hold on you. Before you’re even able to get yourself together, Simmons pushes on. If there was a knife, you’d feel its twist as Time To Pay plays out. I couldn’t wait to get the feelings this record has created in me on to digital paper, such is the effect I’ve felt by this set of tracks, first released in 2006.\n\nA single guitar, a voice and occasional harmonica. It’s stripped back in instrumentation, but it’s loaded with emotion. If I didn’t know better, I’d be worried for Simmons’ own life, but he is actually playing a character who, possibly, is sat on his front porch in rural Tennessee and pondering the decisions that got him here. Seeking solace from Jesus and The Devil and finding himself bereft and exhausted. As he sings on You Give Us:\n\n“Sometimes I get so sick of this life\n\nSometimes I think I must be losing my mind\n\nSometimes I wonder why I even still try”\n\nSomehow, Simmons has imparted these feelings of introspection into the recording. It’s like vapours pouring from a vial, it’s music you inhale until you embody it. I know it sounds unlikely – and I would have agreed with you had I not heard it myself. This is an album that you forced to invest in, it’s that compelling a listen. I defy you to not do be haunted by this.\n\nLyrically, it flits between sinister and uplifting. Sometimes, there are moments where the two worlds cross over. The opening lines of the chorus on Devil’s Work Is Never Done is one such time, but the melody Simmons conjures up drives it home as if they words were delivered by a nail gun:\n\n“It looks so easy sounds so damn simple\n\nYou think these souls fall right outta the sky?\n\nJesus back off, this one’s mine”\n\nI mean, come on!\n\nThis album could have fallen into cliché’s very easily. Somehow, Simmons avoids them even while the themes sit up front, riding shotgun. The words he chooses, the chords he plucks; these are the things that prevent this from being pastiche and ensure the album continues to have that emotional effect on you throughout. I can picture the tribute Elvis bawling as Simmons’ sings Cryin’ Elvis. Brought to life by his voice, held by the framework of composition and thoughtful fingerpicking on the guitar.\n\nThe album is littered with clever lines. It’s hard not to quote them endlessly. Lines like, “I sipped on a quart of sloth / Fell behind and got lost” which pops up in the second half of Dante’s Blues No.7. And there are plenty more to discover.\n\nEven as the album slows and begins its descent towards its end, the quality continues to ascend. It brought to mind another recent album that floored me on first listen and continues to reward, Evensongs by Andrew Rumsey. It’s interesting to me that both have religious connotations, but wear them like a tattoo that can be glimpsed. You can pull up the sleeve and bear witness, but even if you prefer to ignore them it doesn’t diminish the experience these songs bring. You’re part of the congregation listening to Simmons’ blend of sermon and confessional, just by pressing play.\n\nI’ll leave you with another lyric, this time from the final song, Long Way To Go.\n\n“And I heard somebody say\n\nYou gotta walk that lonesome valley\n\nOn your own just to prove your worth”\n\nWell, actually, you can have Stephen Simmons accompany you. And that’s as close to perfect as you’ll get on any day of the week.\n\nDrink Ring Jesus by Stephen Simmons\n\nThis was the final album from James Varda, and it will be the first release from Unspun Heroes. It is scheduled for release on 15 March, 2024.\n\nI write ‘was’ above, as James’s life and career came to a tragic end in 2015 when he succumbed to a rare cancer of the throat. On Chance and Time, James writes knowing this will be the last of his work to see the light of day, yet it is an astonishing album that is full of light and love. His website says it best, describing this album as one that “chronicled the experience of confronting illness and death. In doing so, he created a unique language and music of love and pain, family, landscape and loss.”\n\nIt’s fitting that a decade on, this album finally gets a well-deserved pressing on vinyl.\n\nBut who is James Varda?\n\nLike all Unspun Heroes, this is music deserving of wider attention. It’s strange to me that such a talented musician and songwriter has remained below the radar since he was discovered at an open mic session at Clapham Folk Club by Roy Harper in the 1980s. James’s work may have many traits of the traditional English folk scene, yet he would undoubtedly now be classed as an indie folk artist; his flawless picking style settling him in the folk camp, but his versatility in terms of vocals and lyrics pushing him outside the folk realms into other genres.\n\nHis debut, Hunger, recorded in 1988 with top producer, John Leckie began what should have been a stellar rise to fame. However, while James appears at ease with writing and recording, he preferred to eschew the limelight and moved from London to rural Suffolk – and later to Norfolk. Yet, his songwriting became more refined, his tone even more delicate and reflective. Even after extensive radiotherapy, this was – and indeed, is – very much still the case on Chance and Time. In fact, as an album he reached his creative peak with this release, although we’ll never know if perhaps he was at a false summit and there was much, much more to come.\n\nThe album is hauntingly beautiful, even though it’s obvious that James’s life is evaporating, slowly. The emotional weight that James was carrying at the time is clearly present, and yet it only transfers itself to the listener as a comforting presence. And because of that, this is a record that rewards multiple listens – in fact, not only does it deserve to be played again and again, it offers up new glimpses on each and every listen. This is an album of two distinct halves: Side One, which brings you into James’s world at his most vulnerable and Side Two in which he shows you that, despite what he is going through, there is much to celebrate in this world in which we all live.\n\nThis is a special record, a one-of-a-kind collection of songs from a one-of-a-kind artist. And James was an artist. He colours in the world with a unique palette, and recolours it on the next play-through. It’s been an honour and delight to have been working with James’s friends and family to bring this out on vinyl. It’s a treasure we’re proud to have helped share with the world on the format it most deserves to be heard on.\n\nUltimately, he shows us what it means to love.\n\nThe album\n\nThe great work done in the original production and mastering – by Bugs and Matt Colton respectively – was the perfect starting point. The music was handed over to Guy Davie at Electric Mastering for tweaks before he expertly cut the lacquer from which the vinyl was pressed.\n\nAn English artist deserved an English pressing, and so we chose to use the wonderful folks at Press On Vinyl in Middlesbrough for the 300 discs that have been created for our first release. And they did a fantastic job, too. On multiple plays across a variety of setups, it’s a silent yet expansive listen – however, it’s the reviews that will let us know if we’ve hit the level of quality that Unspun Heroes has strived for. Fingers crossed.\n\nExtensive new liner notes have been written by James’s friend, the award-winning author, Nick Triplow. There are also personal thoughts from James’s wife, his son, and his brother alongside these, which have been written especially for this release. These, along with the lyrics, have been printed double-sided on high quality paper stock to produce a fold-out insert that opens up to an impressive 90cm long artefact. The gatefold experience without attracting a stupidly high retail price.\n\nAs there will be with all Unspun Heroes releases, Chance and Time comes with a hand-numbered Obi strip. Again, this has been printed on high quality card.\n\n50 of these albums will be used to create a deluxe edition, complete with high quality prints of James’s handwritten lyrics for many of the songs on the album. These prints showcase his songwriting process and offer collectors something never seen beyond his close family and friends. These will be held within a handmade outer card sleeve, which has been debossed and foiled by an award-winning bookbinder in London.\n\nThis release has been a labour of love and will be available to pre-order from your local independent record store from January 12, 2024 via SRD. Direct sales will open up in late Feb, early March. It’s a tough time for independent music stores, and labels. With Unspun Heroes, I wanted to support the independent scene, which is why I chose to use a new UK pressing plant doing great things, and to not sell via dominant online stores named after South American rivers.\n\nThere are 300 copies only. Once they’re gone, they’re gone.\n\nA massive thank you goes to Will at Needle Mythology. He knew James and has been a huge help, not only in getting access to this album, but by being a guide to the industry for this complete newbie. I also owe a huge debt of gratitude to Colin Sinclair, one of James’s best friends. We’ve spent many hours chatting and I’m thankful to him allowing me access to the larger archive of James’s work – much of which has never seen the light of day beyond a few demo cassettes and CDs.\n\nFinally, I’m truly honoured that James’s family allowed me, a stranger and outsider, to bring this beautiful music to life on vinyl for the first time. I extend a heartfelt thanks to them, and I hope I have done James’s vision justice. To stream the album, you can access a high quality version via Songbox until March 2024, or it’s on Spotify.
