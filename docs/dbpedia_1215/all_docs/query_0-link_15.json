        "text": "“It feels good to be known so well,” sang Lucy Dacus in “True Blue,” a balladic anthem from Boygenius’ “The Record,” one of the key albums of 2023. That song was an ode to friendship, love and intimacy, of course. But that line speaks to how music fans feel about the records that really move us: We feel known by the music, whether the stars (and the up-and-comers) are speaking to the emotional experiences we share or just knowing what the right beat is to power us through a year of terrible headlines and daily grinds. With artists as diverse as Olivia Rodrigo, Brent Faiyaz, Karol G, Victoria Monét, Lana Del Rey, Zach Bryan, Doja Cat and 100 Gecs all reaching new heights, or Peso Pluma, Ice Spice and Laufey starting strong out of the gate, you would’ve had to have your ears buried pretty far in the sand not to find your own brand of sonic tonic.\n\nHere are individual top 10 album lists for the year from the four members of the Variety music staff, representing nearly 40 albums it’s not too late to catch up (and closer to 80 if you dig into each staffer’s honorable mentions). Scroll through our complete rankings, or click on a byline and jump ahead to see the albums that most moved the 2023 needle for Jem Aswad, executive music editor; Thania Garcia, associate music editor; Steven J. Horowitz, senior music writer; and Chris Willman, senior writer and chief music critic."
