        "text": "Just one week after the once-in-a-lifetime total solar eclipse, people around the world are once again counting down the minutes to another highly-anticipated date: April 19 – the day Taylor Swift releases her 11th original studio album, \"The Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\nThe \"Anti-Hero\" singer threw her devoted fan base for a loop during the 2024 Grammys, when she announced her plans for the album while accepting the award for best pop vocal album for \"Midnights.\" Leading up to the awards show, many speculated the superstar was teasing the release of the re-recorded version of her sixth album, \"Reputation,\" given her official website was suffering a calculated glitch.\n\nSo what exactly does Swift's \"Tortured Poets\" era entail? And when does the album come out? Here's everything to know.\n\nWhen does Taylor Swift's 'The Tortured Poets Department' album come out?\n\n\"The Tortured Poets Department\" will release on vinyl, cassette, CD and digital album Friday, April 19. It will also be available to stream on Apple Music and Spotify at midnight on Friday.\n\nPre-orders and pre-saves are available now on Swift's website.\n\nSwift's website also has a timer counting down to 2 p.m. ET Thursday. It's unclear what is in the plans for that time.\n\nWhat is 'The Tortured Poets Department' about?\n\nIn the weeks since the album announcement, Swift has captivated fans with small teasers alluding to its contents. During the Melbourne, Australia, stop of her Eras Tour, she revealed, \"Tortured Poets is an album − I think more than any of my albums that I’ve ever made − I needed to make it. It was really a lifeline for me.\"\n\nSome fans have theorized the album centers around Swift's ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn. The pair dated for six years before breaking up last year.\n\nIn support of their theory, fans dug up a video the English actor did withVariety in December 2022, alongside Paul Mescal, during which they said they had a WhatsApp group chat called “the Tortured Man Club.\"\n\nOthers have highlighted the album release date, which is exactly one year after Swift’s friends and brother potentially unfollowed Alwyn on Instagram. Swift was photographed having dinner with Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively that night – who both reportedly unfollowed Alwyn as well.\n\nAfter Swift shared the track list for the album Feb. 5, fans immediately zeroed in on song No. 5, “So Long, London,” as likely being about Alwyn, who was raised in London, England.\n\nWhere to buy 'The Tortured Poets Department'\n\nThe physical album will be sold at Barnes & Noble, Walmart and a selection of local record stores. An exclusive, clear vinyl version of the album will be sold at Target.\n\n'The Tortured Poets Department' track list\n\nJust one day after the album announcement, Swift released the track list on Instagram.\n\nThe track list is as follows:\n\nSide A\n\n\"Fortnight (feat. Post Malone).\"\n\n\"The Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\n\"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys.\"\n\n\"Down Bad.\"\n\nSide B\n\n\"So Long, London.\"\n\n\"But Daddy I Love Him.\"\n\n\"Fresh Out the Slammer.\"\n\n\"Florida!!! (Florence + the Machine).\"\n\nSide C\n\n\"Guilty as Sin?\"\n\n\"Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?\"\n\n\"I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can).\"\n\n\"LOML.\"\n\nSide D\n\n\"I Can Do it with a Broken Heart.\"\n\n\"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived.\"\n\n\"The Alchemy.\"\n\n\"Clara Bow.\"\n\nBonus Track: \"The Manuscript.\"\n\nSwift has since announced three more bonus tracks: \"The Bolter,\" \"The Albatross\" and \"The Black Dog.\"\n\nWhat does LOML mean?\n\nOne track listed on \"The Tortured Poets Department\" is \"LOML,\" which has led to many people asking what that means.\n\nLOML typically stands for \"love of my life.\"\n\nIs Cincinnati native Aaron Dessner a producer on 'The Tortured Poets Department'?\n\nCincinnati native Aaron Dessner, founder of the band The National, is a colleague of Swift's, having worked on multiple projects with her that include \"Folklore,\" \"Evermore\" and \"Midnights.\""
