        "text": "http://www.abcdrduson.com/interviews/feature-vo.php?id=196\n\nA: Back in 2000, Jay-Z dropped \"The Dynasty\", an album that introduced your talent alongside those of Just Blaze and Kanye West. How come we didn’t find you on every Jay albums after that?\n\nB: I did \"The Blueprint” which was right after that but I kind of shadow away from the whole Roc-A-Fella scene because I was actually mimicked by somebody within the camp. It doesn’t feel right with me just because I’m from the old school and taking somebody else sound or style or whatever which was called “biting” back in the day is real personal. In the new school, there’s no such thing as “biting”, it’s about getting a check. That’s what I hate about the game. The whole creative side is not here anymore. There’s not a lot of people who make you want to go home and turn your machine on when you have listened to their music. A lot of people that you hear out here, you are thinking that you are hearing one person and it is somebody totally different and it’s OK. Back in the day, people used to get shot and beat up over stuff like that.\n\nA: Who was biting your style?\n\nB: I mean, that’s obvious, you can tell me that!\n\nA: I would say...Just Blaze?\n\nB: Of course! You are the type of guy that pays attention to details. The average fan or the average consumer, they don’t really care about who got what from who. That’s not their concern. If the record is hot, it’s all they care about. But if you are a fan of music, and you have really followed the game, then you know what I brought to the game and what people borrowed from me since I came in.\n\nThe crazy thing is that I used to be cool with the guy. Just Blaze and me were cool at one time doing the whole “Dynasty” and “Blueprint”. Once it got to the point where he was taking what I was doing, it doesn’t fit right with me. He ended up signing to Gee Roberson and Hip-Hop who were A&Rs for Roc-A-Fella. Once I wasn’t really feeling what was going on, they kind of let me behind and I pursued my career in other places.\n\nA: So you ‘re any longer cool with Just Blaze, right?\n\nB: We definitely don’t talk [laughs]. But when I first met the guy, he sounded like Swizz Beatz! That’s the irony to the story. He’s the only guy that I’ve heard in the game taking from so many producers. He’s starting to come to his own now a little bit but even now he’s more sounding like a Toomp or a Drumma Boy. He does what’s hot and that’s the part of the game that I told you I don’t agree with. I’m not going to do something because everybody else is doing it. He’s infamous for borrowing from people, that’s his M.O.. He’s a talented guy, I might say but he hasn’t brought anything to the game that he has come up with. That’s the only thing he’s missing: his own sound.\n\nI don't know...they do sound awfully similar around that time...and to be honest I thought Bink had some of the hottest joints with Jay. The Rulers Back, All I Need...the joints he did on the Dynasty album was hot. What yall think about this?\n\nas20gp said:\n\nbut at the same time.. Bink! was never a SINGLES producer.. he always an album type dude, he only has one SINGLE in his discography which was Lights Camera Action\n\nthat doesnt mean that he fell off, cause he was never in a position to FALL from\n\nhe just made good music, and he's been sayin this stuff for years.. so it aint like \"hes just mad cause just blaze is back on top of the game\"\n\nSo what I'm saying is...MAKE MUSIC.\n\nHe sounds mad because another guy did what he did BETTER than him.\n\nYou know who he sounds like...Jaz-O. That's who he sounds like...when Jaz be talkin about Jay-Z.\n\nIf you're the better of the producers, then PUT OUT HOT RECORDS. That's all there is to it. Prove that you're the hotter of the 2 producers.\n\nI mean Bink is talking Bluprint beats...that was back in what, 2001??\n\nNIGGA IT'S 2009!!! Just Blaze don't even MAKE beats like that no more.\n\nIf you still making 2001 beats, then something is wrong with you. And if you still bitter about 2001 sh*t, then you're a loser. Flat out.\n\nSo now what's your excuse?\n\nMake records and stop crying."
