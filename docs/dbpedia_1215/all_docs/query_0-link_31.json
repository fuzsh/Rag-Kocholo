It was a popular choice among creators sharing girlhood memories and moments.\n\nTikTok has also become an important tool for aspiring artists looking to gain exposure. Last year saw several popular artists on TikTok win awards, including Wet Leg, Steve Lacy and Muni Long.\n\nArtists Noah Kahan and Ice Spice, who scored viral hits that catapulted their careers, are nominated for best new artist this year.\n\nSpeaking of TikTok...\n\nJust days before the Grammys, thousands of songs were no longer available on the platform.\n\nUniversal Music Group, one of the ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù global music companies, removed its catalog from TikTok in the early hours of Thursday after the two failed to reach a deal.\n\nUMG said in a statement Wednesday that it would pull its tracks because of a lack of compensation for artists and songwriters. But TikTok pushed back, claiming the company was putting ‚Äútheir own greed above the interests of artists and songwriters.‚Äù\n\nRead more here.\n\nThere are three new categories this year\n\nBest African Music Performance\n\nBest Alternative Jazz Album\n\nBest Pop Dance Recording\n\nThere were some new Grammy rules instated last year\n\nLast year, the awards show introduced a new rule stating a work is only eligible for a Grammy if it contains human authorship. Aimed at addressing rising concerns around AI, the protocol is nuanced.\n\nSome use of AI material is acceptable, according to the rule, but only if there‚Äôs a degree of human contribution that‚Äôs ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù to the work and ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù to the category it‚Äôs submitted in. And authors of AI material are ineligible to receive a Grammy for their AI contributions.\n\nOther rule changes included a reduction from 10 to eight nominees in the show‚Äôs major categories: album, song and record of the year, as well as best new artist. The move from the Recording Academy backpedaled on its 2021 decision to expand the categories from eight to 10.\n\nWho is performing at the Grammys?\n\nWhat would music‚Äôs biggest night be without a stellar lineup of performances?\n\nThere are nearly a dozen musical acts planned for the 2024 Grammy Awards ceremony.\n\nHere's a round-up of those who have already been announced:\n\nOlivia Rodrigo\n\nBillie Eilish\n\nDua Lipa\n\nSZA\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nTravis Scott\n\nBurna Boy\n\nLuke Combs\n\nBilly Joel\n\nU2\n\nJoni Mitchell\n\nJon Batiste\n\nLuke Combs\n\nTracy Chapman\n\nStevie Wonder\n\nFantasia\n\nAnnie Lennox\n\nTrevor Noah is hosting (again)\n\nTrevor Noah clearly loves the Grammy Awards. The former ‚ÄúDaily Show‚Äù host will emcee for a fourth consecutive year.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm equal parts excited and nervous,‚Äù the comedian told Variety about this year‚Äôs show. ‚ÄúI always wonder why I say yes to this thing, and then if it goes well ‚Äî which it has, thankfully ‚Äî I‚Äôm always grateful that I did. But the nerves never go away. There are only two things you can do: do it well, or completely mess it up. That‚Äôs not a great life to be living! I don‚Äôt know why I do this myself.‚Äù\n\nWhen asked about what the hardest part of the gig is, Noah said he fears disappointing the artists he loves.\n\n‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt do well for a live audience, OK, you‚Äôre gonna bounce back; if you don‚Äôt do well for a home audience, OK, some people are going to comment online,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut to have the look of disappointment come from an icon or somebody that you really love ‚Äî I do not wish for that experience. So I work twice as hard.‚Äù\n\nThe comedian is also nominated in the best comedy album category this year.\n\nHow and when to watch the Grammy Awards\n\nThe Grammys air live on CBS at 8 p.m. ET.
