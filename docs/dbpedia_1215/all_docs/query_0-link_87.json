        "text": "\"Intro (End of the World)\" is a brief introduction to the album's main conflict.\n\n\"Intro (End of the World)\" was one of the first songs Grande wrote for \"Eternal Sunshine\" last year. It finds our heroine contemplating her reality at the time, questioning her own instincts — and, presumably, her then-husband.\n\nAppropriately, it introduces the album's primary theme: \"How can I tell if I'm in the right relationship? Aren't you really supposed to know that shit?\" She wonders if her current partner would stick by her side, even if the apocalypse was nigh.\n\nThe song also introduces another character: \"Then I had this interaction I've been thinkin' 'bout for like five weeks / Wonder if he's thinking 'bout it too and smiling.\"\n\nGrande draws a distinction between the song's subject, \"you,\" whose devotion she's doubting, and the secondary character, \"he,\" who's been inspiring her lately.\n\nIt's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment that sneakily foreshadows the album's arc, though it wouldn't work as a stand-alone song.\n\n\"Eternal Sunshine\" is an album highlight that directly references the movie that inspired it.\n\nGrande isn't the first pop star to use \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" as inspiration.\n\nBack in 2020, Halsey released her third album \"Manic,\" which probes and subverts the \"Manic Pixie Dream Girl\" trope. The opening track \"Ashley\" samples a piece of dialogue from the cult-classic film, delivered by Kate Winslet as Clementine: \"Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them 'alive.' I'm just a fucked up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.\"\n\nThe next track, \"Clementine,\" further aligns Halsey with the shrewd heroine and draws a parallel between their quirks, conflicts, and vices.\n\nBy contrast, Grande focuses less on character study and far more on consequences. The \"Eternal Sunshine\" title track doesn't attempt to unpack why she can't make love last or find her own peace of mind. It simply captures a snapshot of a relationship in the rearview mirror — and gives us a glimpse at Grande's coping mechanisms.\n\n\"I try to wipe my mind / Just so I feel less insane / Rather feel painless / I'd rather forget than know, know for sure,\" she sings in the second verse, a reference to the memory-erasure process that Clementine impulsively opts for.\n\nUnfortunately, much like the film, Grande's song belies a tragic fate. Despite hints of closure and new love (\"I found a good boy and he's on my side\"), she dooms herself to future pain by refusing to face her past. The first sound in the song is Grande's laughter; the final word is \"death.\" Similarly, Grande's airy falsetto is juxtaposed with an ominous, heavy trap beat. The tension this creates is exquisite and gripping, making \"Eternal Sunshine\" one of the richest songs on the album.\n\nFinal Grade: 8.8/10\n\nThere are two types of music lovers: those who are enchanted by melody and those who care foremost about lyrics.\n\nGrande is a harmonic genius, an astonishing vocalist, and a noted Pro Tools expert, so her fans tend to belong to the former category. Many will be delighted with \"Eternal Sunshine\" because if one thing can be said for this album, in the words of Beyoncé, it's that \"all these songs sound good.\"\n\nThis should come as no surprise. Max Martin and ILYA, credited on nearly every track, are two of the most revered pop producers from the last three decades. Other collaborators include Shintaro Yasuda, who did \"Off the Table\" from \"Positions,\" and Nick Lee, whose jazzy touch can be felt on the album's closer.\n\nThis isn't to discredit Grande herself, who's also listed as a coproducer on all 13 tracks. She sounds angelic and discerning throughout the album, always knowing exactly when to deploy her massive pipes and when a subtle whisper will do the trick.\n\nHowever, Grande did \"Eternal Sunshine\" a disservice with its title and marketing. There's nothing wrong with pop songs that unpretentiously sound good. In fact, I'd argue they're essential.\n\nBut I did expect more substance from a project she pitched as a \"concept album\" inspired by one of the most nuanced, perceptive, and poignant films of all time. And I expected more from the woman who once had so much courage, so few inhibitions, that she named a love song after her fiancé and then name-dropped him in a breakup song three months later.\n\nNaturally, Grande's personal life has continued to attract curiosity in the years since \"Thank U, Next\" was released. She's a pop star; it comes with the territory.\n\nBut asked if she planned to \"address things\" with \"Eternal Sunshine,\" Grande demurred.\n\n\"It says everything and nothing at the same time,\" she told Sang of the album. \"It's very vague and very specific all at once.\" I couldn't have said it better myself.\n\nSure, you could say that Grande doesn't owe us honesty or specificity, and you might be right. Fame isn't easy for people who value privacy. However, as a music critic, I value honesty and specificity in songwriting.\n\nAs Grande herself has demonstrated, truly great music comes alive in the details, in her ex's Gucci tennis shoes and the bed where she cries every night. They elevate a pop song from \"It's a bop\" to \"I'm going to be listening to this for the rest of my life.\"\n\nThese moments do pop up in \"Eternal Sunshine,\" just more sparingly than I would've liked. \"So I grab my stuff / Courtney just pulled up in the driveway,\" Grande sings in \"Bye,\" paying homage to a lifelong friend whose name is also tattooed on her knee. Her nighttime tears reappear in \"Don't Wanna Break Up Again,\" painting an intimate scene of neglect and dread. I feel like I could be sitting right next to her, watching her weep. Of course, the best example is the voice note in \"Ordinary Things,\" which is easily one of the album's most affecting moments.\n\nBut overall, the emotional arc of this album doesn't quite pay off. The conclusion comes abruptly, and to be clear, it's not a length issue. (Let the record show I believe the perfect album length is 13 songs and 35 minutes when executed well.) It's a narrative issue.\n\n\"Intro (End of the World)\" and \"Ordinary Things\" work well as bookends, but what happens in between is muddled. Grande begins the story in the midst of her breakup, ready to leave, and there's no clear moment of epiphany or catharsis before we're already introduced to another relationship. The title track alludes to flawed communication, devastating truth, and even infidelity, but there's no time to process any of it. She's already found \"a good boy and he's on my side.\" It's ironic for a song that also includes the lyric, \"Get me out of this loop.\"\n\nI kept waiting for Grande to delve deeper into themes of loss, repetition, self-sabotage, and self-discovery.\n\nInstead, she pulls back. We get \"True Story,\" \"The Boy Is Mine,\" and \"Yes, And?\" — a sequence designed to deflect public critique and satisfy TikTok fans. Abruptly, the tracklist ends with a love song. It doesn't feel earned because we don't know how she got there.\n\nAs a staunch believer in the album as an art form, \"Eternal Sunshine\" left me wanting. It doesn't meet the soul-baring bar set by \"Sweetener\" and \"Thank U, Next.\"\n\nBut if I reframe \"Eternal Sunshine\" as a collection of excellent pop songs, I have very few complaints. Even the ones I can't see myself reaching for in the future (\"Bye,\" \"Supernatural,\" \"True Story,\" \"Imperfect For You\"), I can't label them as \"skips\" in good conscience. A bop is a bop.\n\nIn the end, I'm left to cherry-pick my favorites and drop them into my prettiest, synth-poppiest playlists. And I can't even be mad, because Grande's lead single doubles a warning: \"Your business is yours and mine is mine.\" She won't be taking questions at this time. I foolishly expected a revelation and her response was simply, \"Yes, and?\"\n\nWorth listening to:\n\n\"Bye\"\n\n\"Don't Wanna Break Up Again\"\n\n\"Eternal Sunshine\"\n\n\"Supernatural\"\n\n\"True Story\"\n\n\"The Boy Is Mine\"\n\n\"We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)\"\n\n\"I Wish I Hated You\"\n\n\"Imperfect For You\"\n\n\"Ordinary Things (feat. Nonna)\"\n\nBackground music:\n\n\"Intro (End of the World)\"\n\n\"Saturn Returns Interlude\"\n\n\"Yes, And?\"\n\nPress skip:\n\nN/A\n\n*Final album score based on songs per category (1 point for \"Worth listening to,\" .5 for \"Background music,\" 0 for \"Press skip\")."
