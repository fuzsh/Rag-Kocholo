        "text": "If you ask any fan of Stevie’s what his prime was, and 10 times out of 10, they’ll tell you the 1970s. Who can blame them? During the 1970s, Mr. Wonder released eight albums, had 12 Top 10 singles on the Billboard 100 earned 12 of his 25 Grammys, including three consecutive Album of the Year awards. His fabled “classic run” is arguably unrivaled, and universally praised by fans and critics alike.\n\nMeanwhile, his output throughout the 1980s has been maligned by many as an era in which Stevie went too far down the pop road. Songs like “I Just Called to Say I Love You” and “Part-Time Lover” and his participation in star-curated charity hit singles “We Are The World” and “That’s What Friends Are For” are dismissed as schmaltzy, over-produced songs not worthy of praise like his earlier material. Not to mention that his catalog in that decade was thin compared to the previous decade.\n\nWonder released four full-length studio albums in the 1980s: Hotter Than July (1980), The Woman in Red Soundtrack (1984), In Square Circle (1985), and Characters (1987), only half the amount from the 1970s. This doesn’t include 1982’s Original Musiquarium I, a compilation of hits with four new songs.\n\nYet, his success had only increased. He had 15 top 10 Billboard R&B singles (six of which were number one) and had five platinum-selling albums (only two platinum albums from the 1970s). He appeared on two of the decade’s most prominent TV institutions: Saturday Night Live and The Cosby Show, and won an Academy Award for Best Original Song.\n\nSo, is this a result of him selling out and dumbing down his songwriting to reach a wider audience?\n\nNo.\n\nThis is the result of a man who had already shown the world that no one in the industry was better at getting more with less than him.\n\nA blind child prodigy from Detroit’s legend factory, Motown Records, Stevie Wonder has been giving the world high-quality product since the tender age of 12 when “Fingertips Part 2” shot to the peak of the charts.\n\nSoon, the harmonica wunderkind began to discover his voice, and more hits piled up, from “Uptight (Everything’s Alright),” “I Was Made to Love Her,” “For Once in My Life” to “Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I’m Yours” and “My Cherie Amour.” Unsatisfied with the assembly line recording process that Motown is notorious for, Wonder was able to flex his muscle and gain creative freedom at age 21.\n\nSince then, he’d been on a mission to free the rest of us. His domination of the 1970s was thanks to his malleable vocal delivery, and visionary work as a songwriter and producer, often playing every instrument on each song, composing every song, and writing almost every lyric. What made his music stand out, though, was “how” he wrote those songs.\n\nIn his most enduring records, he was able to match the emotion of the track with words that were subtle, somber, contemplative, introspective, enraged, comical, and above all, allegorical. He pushed the envelope and everyone followed. So, then why is his work in the following decade not as revered?\n\n***\n\nStevie was a victim of his own innovation. He was one of the first Black artists to truly embrace synthesizers and electronic technology to record his music.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between the sound of Stevie’s 1970s catalog from his 1980s catalog was that the latter embraced a more full commitment to digital, whereas the former marbleized electronic and acoustic more harmoniously. Look at a song like “Superstition.” Its main components came from clavinet, Arp, and Moog synthesizers, but were perfectly counterpointed by live drums and horns.\n\nAs the 1970s progressed and Wonder’s musical domination increased, artists like George Clinton (“Flashlight”), and Herbie Hancock (“Come Running To Me”) began to follow suit. As that decade came to an end, synths and drum machines were the rules, not the exception.\n\nStevie’s 1979 documentary score Journey Through The Secret Life of Plants marked a watershed transition for Wonder, as it was his first fully digital recording. Using mostly synthesizers, keyboards, and drum machines to record what’s in essence a symphonic orchestral film score, it had an undertone of iciness. However, much of the music itself was pleasant and emotional.\n\nGiven the reception that Secret Life of Plants received, 1980s Hotter Than July was seen as a return to Stevie’s classic form for some. While also another fully digital recording, Wonder had returned to his prodigious blend of technology and live instrumentation. The tight 10-song set incorporated a variety of sounds and genres much like his 1970s albums.\n\n“I Ain’t Gonna Stand For It” was his first foray into Country music and peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. “Do Like You” and “Did I Hear You Say You Love Me” had a deceptive tinge of African rhythms and brass. He paid tribute to Reggae icon Bob Marley with “Master Blaster (Jammin’)” on its way to the top of the Billboard R&B charts and top five on the pop charts.\n\nThree of Original Musiquarium I extended Stevie Wonder’s classic canon: “Ribbon in the Sky,” “That Girl” and “Do I Do.” “Ribbon” and “That Girl” followed the DIY tradition of songs like “You Are The Sunshine of My Life” and “Knocks Me Off My Feet,” combining live acoustic instruments with understated synthesizers, while “Do I Do” was a cousin of “Sir Duke,” recruiting a full band of the best and brightest session musicians of the day.\n\nHowever, the odd song out on the Musiquarium, “Front Line,” was a prelude to what was to come. A first-person account of a Vietnam veteran coming home from war to find little to no opportunity and dealing with the aftermath of PTSD, “Front Line” was a contemporary progression of “Living For The City,” however it had a tinge of preachiness and lacked the righteous indignation of the former. Also, where “Living For The City” had a warmth in its production as Stevie played every instrument, the production of “Front Line” was flat and two-dimensional.\n\nBy 1984, The Woman in Red soundtrack that was written by Wonder featured songs that were completely void of acoustic instruments adjacent to songs with live studio musicians and string sections. The robotic production of the title track standing next to the organic ballads “It’s You” and “Weakness” was stark, to say the least.\n\nHowever, the hit dance single “Love’s Light in Flight” remains a jovial number and contains the electro-funk vibe that we find nostalgic today.\n\nHis following two albums, 1985’s In Square Circle and 1987’s Characters, had nary a trace of live instruments, and like most acts in the latter part of the decade, the production and engineering watermarked songs like “Part-Time Lover,” “Go Home,” “Skeletons” to the era.\n\nCompared to songs like “I Wish,” and “Boogie On Reggae Woman” from the 1970s, much of Stevie’s work from the 1980’s second half had a cyborg feel and hindered the heart that went into crafting these songs.\n\nLooking under the surface, many of these compositions have the same strength as his prime. Had songs like “With Each Beat of My Heart,” “My Eyes Don’t Cry No More,” and “Never In Your Sun” been recorded during his classic 1972 to 1976 run, people may feel differently about these songs.\n\nIn addition, Stevie’s ability as a songwriter-for-hire had also reached a zenith in the 1980s. Some of his best material of all time can be found on the lips of other artists during that decade, from Jermaine Jackson’s “Let’s Get Serious,” Robert Flack and Donny Hathaway’s “You Are My Heaven,” Quincy Jones’ “Betcha Wouldn’t Hurt Me” and Third World’s “Try Jah Love.” While some of his solo material is judged more harshly by critics in hindsight, these aforementioned tracks still possess the staying power that they praise Stevie’s best material for.\n\n***\n\nAnother important context to consider when reappraising Stevie Wonder’s 1980’s catalog is the socio-political climate for Black America in that decade, and Wonder’s response to that musically and personally.\n\nStevie wrote his most enduring composition in 1980. While it didn’t chart as high as other songs from Hotter Than July, its melody drops from the lips of every Black American family whenever a loved one celebrates another year around the sun; “Happy Birthday.”\n\nAs a tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Black folks everywhere have adopted the chorus and coda for every birthday cake candle blow-out. It also speaks to another part of Stevie’s lack of music in the 1980s; his increased activism work. He’d spend most of 1981 campaigning with Coretta Scott King to help Dr. King’s birthday become a national holiday.\n\nHis devotion to the cause paid off when it was signed into law by President Reagan in 1983 and first observed in 1986. Wonder spent the 1980s increasingly entangled in political causes. He was even arrested on Valentine’s Day in 1985 for protesting Apartheid in front of a South African embassy in Washington D.C., calling himself “a conscientious criminal for world equality.”\n\nWhile his actions were byproducts of Black American civil disobedience in the 1960s and 1970s, his music reflected a more subdued timbre of the Black experience during the 1980s.\n\nThe “Me Decade” was defined by assimilation between Black and white America. African-Americans spent much of the previous decade with the fullest understanding of their place in the country, how the white upper echelon thought of them, and openly embraced their sense of independence and heritage.\n\nSadly, though, the opportunity to live in the suburbs and have disposable income superseded knowledge of self. If Black folks spent the 1970s being woke, the 1980s found many of them taking sleeping pills because it was easier to believe that things were better, via assimilation than the reality of what the way things were.\n\nLike every movement in the culture of Black America, the songs were the mirror of the mindsets and lifestyle of, what writer Nelson George dubbed, the post-soul nation. The tracklist of that soundtrack included music from Lionel Richie, Whitney Houston, Anita Baker, Luther Vandross, Freddie Jackson, Melba Moore, and others. The thematic focus on relationships, good times, and the sleek, polished production and engineering described the aspiration aspect of Black ideals. The contrast was from Hip-Hop, which more accurately reflected.\n\nGeorge wrote, “Economic clout has granted many black cultural figures an unprecedented level of financial control over their art. Once Berry Gordy was the patron saint of black capitalism, but Godfather Bill Cosby, singer/conglomerate Michael Jackson, TV host/producer Oprah Winfrey, and a legion of others enjoy total product control — though, significantly, not distribution control — over their hunk of culture. That’s an undeniable result of genuine integration.”\n\nWonder no longer had the time to present a statement in a poetic, nuanced way with coded language. If he was going to get his point across, he needed to make a plan. Let’s look at a song from each era; 1973’s “He’s Mistra Know-It-All” and 1985’s “It’s Wrong (Apartheid).” The instrumentation and arrangement of “Mistra Know-It-All” evoke a mid-tempo gospel song, heavy with bass and piano, with a vamp out of exuberant, almost ostentatious drum soloing.\n\nThe lyrics were addressing former President Richard Nixon amid the Watergate scandal, but his name is never spoken. It describes a sheisty individual who gets where he wants by deception, narcissism, and capitalistic obsession. So many men could fit that mold. “It’s Wrong (Apartheid)” on the other hand lets you know just from reading the tracklist what you’re going to expect. The production is a slick collection of synthesized poly-rhythms and African chants. The chorus is self-explanatory: “You know Apartheid is wrong/It’s wrong/Like slavery was wrong/Like the Holocaust was wrong/Apartheid is wrong/It’s wrong.”\n\nThe elephant in the room is the volume at which Stevie was producing music in the 1980s. Between 1971’s Where I’m Coming From to 1974’s Fulfillingness’ First Finale, Stevie was averaging a solo album every nine months, not to mention producing two albums for Syreeta Wright, co-producing Minnie Riperton’s 1974 album Perfect Angel.\n\nIn the 1980’s he was releasing music at a noticeably slower frequency, despite continuing to produce hit singles and compose for other artists.\n\nStevie addressed his newfound approach to releasing music during the 1980s in a 1984 Washington Post interview. “It’s not easy going years without putting a record out,” Stevie said. “Especially when you hear other people’s records on the radio. But you have to decide: do you want to do something just to hear yourself on the radio or do you want to do something that you feel really comfortable hearing on the radio, no matter how long it takes? That’s the kind of gamble that I’ve had to take in my life.”\n\n***\n\nLastly, Stevie’s 1970s success was so innovative and so dominant, especially after accumulating so many hits in the 1960s as well, that he began to get relegated as a legacy act by the 1980s.\n\nIn 1982, just before Musiquarium was released, Stevie was given a lifetime achievement award at the American Music Awards. An auspicious moment for any artist, it was particularly poignant for Stevie, considering he was barely 32 years old.\n\nThe following year, before even turning 33, Stevie performed at Motown 25, giving the audience a melody of his string of hits from the two previous decades. While it showed off his long hot streak of smash singles and albums, it didn’t have the kind of effect as Michael Jackson had later that evening. After his iconic performance of “Billie Jean” that followed The Jackson 5’s melody of 1970s hits, it was a sign that the then 25-year-old was just getting started.\n\nIn 1989, Stevie became the youngest inductee of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. In the preceding years, acts like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and James Brown were the highest of the high. A crowning achievement for any act, Stevie’s youth, once again, may have been ignored as he was inducted into this hallowed hall. It’s a feeling that it’s a bow on an artist’s career, and yet, Stevie would go on to have more hits and win eight more Grammys.\n\nWhen you turn on the radio today or watch what songs award shows are honoring in the 21st century, you begin to realize that maybe the simplistic, synth-heavy Stevie Wonder songs from the 1980s weren’t so bad. People who slammed “I Just Called To Say I Love You” may pray that such a song was popular in 2021."
