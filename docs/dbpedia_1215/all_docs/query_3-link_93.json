        "text": "I think your comment has a misconception. Just because you collaborate with other people doesn't mean you have no input into what you are doing. She often chooses her collaborators because she likes the sound they do and wants to go in that direction but then she adds her own thing to it.\n\nMadonna does have input into her music, but she bounces the ideas off of other people, which I honestly think is a good thing.\n\nMaybe she enjoys working with other musicians and debating and exchanging ideas with them. What is wrong with that?\n\nFor me, some artists who do everything by themselves become too self indulgent and get stuck in the rut of doing the same thing over and over, as there's no one to tell them hey, actually that doesn't sound good.\n\nI think the best thing is somewhere in the middle where an artist collaborates with other people but also puts their own spin on it. Just singing other people's songs or doing everything by yourself is not that appealing to me. I think generally Madonna achieves the middle ground.\n\nI also wonder would you ask about male artists that always write with other people such as in bands, why don't they do an album all by themselves. But somehow, it's always demanded from female artists that they have to produce or write everything by themselves to prove they are talented.\n\nMadonna has a great ear and is extremely talented in nearly all endeavors that she undertakes. But being a gifted artist does not necessarily mean that she would excel at producing. It almost seems dismissive of a producer's talents to assume that any one could be one. Veteran teachers are not infinitely suited to being principals nor are actors necessarily visionary enough to be directors.\n\nI can guarantee you that Madonna knows her way around a recording studio and a mixing board, and that she can voice precisely what she wants to hear from her musicians; but a producer needs to do more.\n\nMcCartney and The Stones surely can produce themselves, but largely they don't; they know outside ears and decision making is key to the process. Jimmy Page and Townshend however see (hear) things differently.\n\nMost importantly, as long as Madonna is unabashedly recording pop songs, she will be collaborative. Pop songs are, and this has precedents, written and recorded by committee. It is the nature of the beast. The way songwriting and production credits read on modern pop records shows that it takes many hands to make even the simplest songs at this time.\n\nI'm surprised Madonna hasn't picked up enough skill in 34 years to write and produce at least one song by herself, but then again, she isn't Kate Bush. Madonna relies on a merry band of songwriters and producers as much as Britney Spears, Katy Perry, et al. If her record company left her to her own devices, the material would be even more average than it already is. The self-penned songs on her debut album are proof that she has limited ability when there's no one backing her up.\n\nMadonna chases fashions and trends to remain relevant. She doesn't possess the talent to self-produce a range of styles in pop and dance music. She could never have made Ray of Light without William Orbit. He was the brains behind it. For an album Madonna calls deeply personal, she didn't write any of the lyrics by herself. In fact, she only added a handful of words to the title track. The level of involvement she has in her work is up for debate, especially when it's world-renowned talent that she's working alongside. She isn't alone in relying heavily on other people, but the belief that she's a genius is laughable and even more proof of just how deluded a lot of her fans are about her abilities."
