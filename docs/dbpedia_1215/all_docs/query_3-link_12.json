        "text": "Guess how many producers worked on Drake‘s “Certified Lover Boy”? Now, guess again. The list of credited producers runs to four dozen — a reflection of the hit album’s sprawl, since “CLB” includes 21 songs and spans nearly 90 minutes, as well as its star’s determination to spread out the workload.\n\nDrake first teased “Certified Lover Boy” in April 2019 and officially announced its title in August 2020, and somehow, after all that wait, the album seemed to suddenly arrive in a hurry Labor Day weekend, promoted with an international billboard campaign just days before its release. The Canadian hip-hop star’s sixth studio album — about love, heartache, loneliness and lesbians — quickly smashed records and conquered the charts, easily trumping rival Kanye West‘s “Donda” for bragging rights to the biggest first week of 2021. In week one, it registered 595,300 album units and 680.9 million streams, and commanded 19 of the top 20 slots on the songs chart.\n\nHere’s a full rundown of the 48 producers who helped make it possible:\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nNoah “40” Shebib (produced “The Remorse” and co-produced “Champagne Poetry,” “In the Bible” featuring Lil Durk and Giveon, “N 2 Deep” featuring Future, “Yebba’s Heartbreak” featuring Yebba, “Race My Mind,” “Fountains” featuring Tems, “Get Along Better” featuring Ty Dolla Sign, and “Fucking Fans”)\n\nUnsurprisingly, Drake’s longtime collaborator and commandant Noah “40” Shebib has his production fingerprints across nearly the entirety of “Certified Lover Boy.” Named Variety‘s Hitmakers Producer of the Year in 2018, 40 is one of the three founding members of OVO Sound and has either co-produced or engineered every Drake album thus far, with responsibility for hits like “Marvin’s Room,” “Work” and “0 To 100,” among others.\n\nManeesh El-Khatib (co-produced “Champagne Poetry” and “7am on Bridle Path”)\n\nA relative of OVO Sound co-founder Olver El-Khatib, Maneesh has worked on a series of other major projects before jumping on “Certified Lover Boy.” Before this he tallied production credits for Snoh Aelegra’s song “Lost You” off her album “Temporary Highs in the Violet Skies,” and for J.
