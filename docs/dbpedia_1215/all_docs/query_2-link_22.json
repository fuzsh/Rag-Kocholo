        "text": "When Taylor Swift announced at the Grammys that the title of her new album would be “The Tortured Poets Department,” what was your reaction?\n\nMaybe it was: “My gosh! Her first new album in more than a year. I can’t wait!”\n\nMaybe it was: “Ho-hum. I’d rather listen to Shostakovich/Metallica/Baby Shark.”\n\nOr, just possibly, it could have been:\n\n“Shouldn’t there be an apostrophe in that title?”\n\nYes, plenty of people, upon hearing the biggest music announcement of the year, started thinking about punctuation marks and then talking about them on social media."
