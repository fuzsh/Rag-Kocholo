        "text": "Andrew Barber\n\nI would like to bring to the stage No I.D. [applause] Hello again.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nOnce again.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nOnce again. Always a pleasure to sit down with you, happy to have you back in Chicago.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nHappy to be here.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou doing alright with the weather?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nItâs cold.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nShell shocked a little bit?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nItâs cold.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo, you know, youâve had an incredible career as a rapper, a producer, an executive, an A&R, youâve really run the gamut of things that youâve done in the music business. Some people might say youâre the godfather of Chicago hip-hop but Iâll let you decide that or not. But tonight I just want to talk about your history and how you got to where you are today. So letâs start from the beginning. Hip-hop in Chicago, how did you get into it?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWell... the funny thing about it is for me it really starts with house music. It doesnât really start with hip-hop and I was gonna talk about that but letâsâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYeah.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nBecause you said the beginning, thatâs whyâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nSo, alright letâs skip to hip-hop. Common, Iâve known him since we were nine, ten years old; used to play basketball together. Life, you know. Childhood friend, brother, and he was the one that would bring the hip-hop around. He had a cousin who passed away named Ajile, from Cincinnati, who used to influence us to get these tapes, and that led us to listening to WHPK which was the premier hip-hop radio station for us back then. Chilly Q and JB Chill, a lot of other names that you young people might not know.\n\nBut it was a foreign element to us because it was a house music city, period. Thatâs all we went to, house parties. I did house music, and growing up on the south side, a lot of things we got into were to stay out of trouble. [We could] be creative and be active in a way that would keep us on the straight and narrow. And in comes this thing called hip-hop. There was no scene, there was no industry, there was no thought of a deal, there was no money. It was literally like, âHmm, letâs try that.â And [that led] to break dancing and making beats and rapping, and making these little tapes, and performing them in different places. But that was my introduction into hip-hop and it probably wasnât until I heard Paid in Full or Criminal Minded that I was like, âI want to do this, actually. I want to do it.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd so were you hearing those records on WHPK?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, and then after a while we just started finding the tapes. So we would just go try and find a new hip-hop album that would come out, and it was only certain stores that would have them and you had to just kind of find your way to it. So it was either trying to get someone from New York to send a tape back, so you can learn what those new songs were, what was being played. And then try and find who made it, and buy the tape, and then we would play basketball in the backyard, listen to the rap tapes.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd how big of a stronghold did house music have? Were you considered a complete outsider?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAbsolutely. It was rare that you would hear a rap record at a party and it definitely wasnât like [throws hands in the air] It was more like, âWhat are we supposed to do to this? We donât even know what that is.â [laughter] Then another good friend that grew up with us was Twilite Tone. Him and Reggieknow, they formed a crew, and they would start throwing these hip-hop parties. And I think that was the first, for me. I know there were things that happened before me and my generation that definitely deserve recognition but for me that was the first place that I could go to and see a hip-hop party. And definitely, me being from the further south side, I had to make a journey to even get to that.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBecause those guys were in Hyde Park, right?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThey were in Hyde Park.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo that was like the Dem Dare crew?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd you guys were the 87thâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nStreet Crew?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, be careful how you say that. [laughs]\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSorry. So, the UACâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIt means something different.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nOK, OK, my bad. So were you guys known as the UAC at that time? UnAmerican Caravan. Or was that later when you joined with Tone?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. I donât know that I was ever in it. I guess I was, but that was more Common, his intermediate circle when he really started rapping, because everybody needed a crew and that was the crew. And I guess I was just more of the producer in the equation thanâ¦ I guess I was in it though.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd did you guys mesh well with the kids from Hyde Park or was there a lot of tension there?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nA lot of tension. A lot of tension, but we were nomads. We just kind of roamed around causing trouble, playing basketball, making music, just exploring. Young and dumb without guns really.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThat was the blessing, that we didnât really have to face kind of what this generation does. We made a lot of mistakes but we didnât kill each other.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight, and it wasnât posted on social media for the world to see.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo these parties that you were going to, where hip-hop was being played, at what point did it start to cross over and you noticed, âOK thereâs starting to become a scene here and these people are making music over here, theyâre doing it on this side of town,â etc, etc?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIâm gonna say for me... Because Iâm going to try and touch on some things I havenât touched on, because Iâve done a lot of interviews. And I tell them... Iâm going to get into some why, a little more why this time, [more] than just what. For me I really kind of quit music at some point and went to college and I really didnât even have a thought anymore about making it, it being a scene.\n\nI think I kind of ran a course withâ¦ because I was making house music and I think the business went so bad that I didnât have any faith in business anymore. And the side of business for hip-hop and the need of a scene was kind of irrelevant to me at that point. It was more just, âWhat am I going to do? I donât know what I want to do with my life,â and I ended up just going away to school which didnât go the way I wanted it to go.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo you go down there, and from what Iâve read or what weâve discussed in the past, you and Common were kind of sending music back and forth. Playing it for each other on the phone, answering machines and things like that, right?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWell no, actually how that went was, I went away to SIU [Southern Illinois University], which is a party school, and I lost my mind.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou had a little too much fun.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI did.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nA little too much fun at SIU.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnd actually the weird thing is I went for electrical engineering, something [where] youâre not supposed to lose your mind if you have any hopes of getting through it. But I had the wherewithal, I remember calling my mother like a year and a half in going, âI donât want to waste your money, I need to come home.â And now, serious now. So now I saw that Common was still going with the music and I was like, âHmm.â And now I could kind of see the seeds of a scene and different things.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo you were watching this happen from afar?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI watched it and I go, âI gotta get back in it. How am I gonna get back in it?â So I started making beats for me.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBecause you rapped.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nBecause I rapped.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYes. People here may not know that.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. So I was like, maybe I could be the third guy in the crew after, you know? And I just started making beats.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou could be like MC Ren. No disrespect but youâre not [Ice] Cube, youâre notâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. Iâm just saying I gotta do something because my parents had a rule which served me well which was, âHave a job or get out or be in school. Take a pick.â So I remember the first real job I worked was telemarketing after I came home from college and I lasted a day and a half and thenâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThat fast, huh?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, and then my father, he has an electrical company and Regents Park was one of his clients. So he goes, âCome over here, put you to work,â and it was so bad. I mean... and the way the other people in the building were treating me. So I got about a week in and they had me doing stuff like scrubbing the pool with acid and cleaning the pipes on the roof, a hundred degrees and the steam in my face and I remember looking at the pipes, looking at the lake. âIâm doing music, right?â And thatâs when I decided, right? And I come down and I go, âI quit.â Iâm doing music. My fatherâs like, âWell what are you going to do?â Iâm like, âMusic.â Heâs like, âThatâs not a real thing.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nVery foreign now. Even now, itâsâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBut back then itâs likeâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, youâre like, âCome on, man.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nIn Chicago, like, âWhat do you mean?â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nHeâs like, âWell you know what this means?â âI know.â I packed up my Aries K and I drove to Tallahassee where Common was still in school. I showed up, I saidâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nDid he know you were coming or did you just pull up?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, I told him. I said, âIâm on the way. Iâm pulling up. Make some space.â So in that time period is where I started. Itâs actually funny because a good friend of ours, Omaron, was back here with him and I remember the day when Tone, Omaron, me and Common... we used to go to his house in Hyde Park and just play stuff. And I remember I came and played some of my beats and they had finally got there, and he said some raps, and they finally got there.\n\nAnd we kind of looked at each other and was like... he was like, âLet me get that one.â And that was the first time that I was really producing for him. And really most of the beats on Can I Borrow a Dollar? were my beats, for meâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nOr for yourself?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, he would be like, âLet me get that one, let me get that one.â And mind you I ended up getting like $200 a beat.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nItâs a pretty good deal. Itâs not bad.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIt worked.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYeah, it works. Itâs a placement, a placement worked. Did you do his demo, the one that eventually got toâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThat was some of the stuff that came about. So all in this time period is my level of desperate tempo sped up, and I was just making more and more and more music. And thatâs when I started leaving them messages on the machine and playing beats, anything just to get something going because it didnât look good. It did not look good.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nIt didnât look good but then things started happening.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThings started happening and whatever that means. It really didnât, but it did. He got a deal, which was an indie deal, the irony of that in 2018 when people are now fighting for independence. We started in an indie deal, because thatâs what hip-hop was. It was indie deals.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nIt was through Relativity.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nRelativity.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBefore they were picked up byâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNow mind you, OK, we put a record out. It wasnât like [cheers], it was still like, âYeah, thatâs cool.â And I remember two specific things that happened. We went and opened up for [Uncle] Luke at FAMU [laughter] and Iâm DJingâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThat is apples and oranges right there.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nOh man, and weâre doing these records, âTake It Easy,â and the pennies start flying and Iâm like... [laughter]\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo youâre ducking loose change onstage. Not panties, pennies.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes. Penny for my thoughts. So Iâm like, âLetâs wrap it up.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWere you DJing?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, I actually had the SP-1200s up there and I was actually doing music live.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo Tone would DJ and you wouldâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo, he wasnât even DJing then, he was hype man.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nOK.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nSo he was actually performing. And then we left there, and we went and opened up for KRS-One and we ended up having fun. I love KRS-One. Heâs rapping and weâre throwing the sampler tapes out and the sampler tapes are coming right back. [laughter]\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd are you in New York opening up for him or is this here, local?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNew York. Iâm like, âMan. We ainât there yet.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nNot there yet.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWeâre not there yet.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYouâre not there yet, OK.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnd it wasnât really âtil Resurrection that things turned around.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nFrom the outside looking in as a young fan, Iâm seeing the videos on Rap City, Iâm seeing the videos on Yo! MTV Raps, so to the outside world it looks like youâre on. And OK, these are rap stars.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWelcome to the industry. It looks different than it is. We knew we were going out; we were touching the people. So we knew when people really were in and when they werenât. Just because it got played that donât mean people liked it or respected it to be honest. But it was baby steps, and a lot of times people donât understand until you really...\n\nYour environment can create something really special, but it could be multiplied when you go around the world and you see more. Thatâs when you can expand that thing; and sometimes we donât ever get to that point, because we donât know how to get past that tipping point that allows us to move around and journey, and see different environments, and learn other stories. And kind of take that and come back and apply it differently.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThatâs the thing that can hinder a lot of artists, people donât want to move around, go do that type of thing.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou got to really want it.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah and I always say this, music is the one, not the one thing â thereâs a few things â but one of the things that a lot of people just try and do with no previous education, no proper guidance or mentorshipâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou donât need it to get in the business, right?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYou just wake up one day and ... Iâll do music. Iâm a manager. I produce. I got Fruity Loops. It was free, I downloaded it. And thatâs it and you know thereâs no other real profession in this world where you just wake up and do it and say youâre doing it.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nNow itâs even easier. Thereâs no barrier of entry anymore.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo, you could just do anything and put it out and buy some views.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight. Itâs that easy.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nEverywhere I look. Buy followers.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBut you guys had to actuallyâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes. We had to go through all of this all the time, and it had to bear fruit in a real way otherwise it did not exist. It just didnât exist. Thereâs a lot of things that were played back then that we donât talk about and those people donât have careers. They donât, you know. And we supposed to pick something thatâs supposed to feed our families and fulfill us but thatâs not always the case with the paths that we choose. And when you take three steps back again, what made us think that we could just do it anyway?\n\nThatâs something that motivational people [say]â¦ âDo it, you can do anything.â But there is a thing called education, and the positive person goes, educate yourself and then you can... and so Iâm right in between the middle there. Iâm seeking information. I donât have to go to a specific building and pay to learn. Itâs 2018, the information is available. You can seek information, guidance, and I guess my point is that when I look back I can see the growth between demo, Can I Borrow A Dollar?, Resurrection. We began to educate ourselves. We met people, we learned more. I learned what I was doing, I wasnât guessing. I was applying what I had as the kid that grew up, [whose] father played jazz in the house, always heard it. Loved music, DJed, played house music, understood tempos and edits and remixes, and then got into hip-hop and understood those elements.\n\nBut then as I traveled I began to understand how people were making records that were working, and I was no longer guessing. And I was mixing that with what I liked, and then it kind of turned into my style.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight. And did you record Can I Borrow a Dollar? in Chicago or did you have to go to New York andâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNew York.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo everything at the time, you guys were going to New York to record everything?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnd the funniest thing is I used the SP-1200 which only had 10 seconds of sampling time. A lot of records, we would need 20 seconds, so I had to make part of the beat on here and then take the disc out and make another part. And I would never even hear it together until it was laid.\n\nSo when we went to do this album we would go and we got like, âAlright weâre doing 13 songs and we got ten days,â and we never heard it all together ever before that.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWow. You would have to go literally lock in for ten days.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWriterâs block be damned, creative blocksâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo, you gotta have the songs before you get there. Not writing.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nOK.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNot much writing in there. Listen, âTen days, have your raps and you have these beats, go.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo you never heard them, there was no pre-production before that though?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nOK.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThatâs just what it was and we had to imagine the result.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo the first album comes out, doesnât sell that well but it doesnât matter. You get another shot. How hard was it to get another shot back then?\n\nNo I.D.\n\n$200 a beat.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThe budget was small.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThe deal mightâve been $50,000.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo they give you another chance.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd this becomes the Resurrection.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWell, because of the âSoul By The Poundâ remix.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo thatâs what did it?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThatâs what kind of made people go, âAh, OK, give them a shot.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nOK, because they liked that record. That had the most traction of any.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, that was like, OK. Then I got a couple calls. âHey man, that was pretty good.â Before, it was like, âYeah man, doing your little rap thing huh? Keep it up.â [laughter]\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd so you guys are going to New York, youâre traveling around, youâre these Chicago kids in New York and are you gettingâ¦ thereâs no rap in Chicago, Iâm sure theyâre probably kind of treating you guys a little different. Were you getting respect?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNot at first but the first people we met was the Beatnuts, Chi-Ali, and then we met Q-Tip.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYouâre like Native Tongues and likeâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. Fat Joe, Pun before Pun was signed. So in this circle where... back then, digging in the crates was a thing, so I was a DJ. So Iâd be like, âHey back in Chicagoâs a lot of records, do you want to give me some names? Iâll go get some stuff for you,â which is how I really started to learn how to do that specific art of just finding obscure music to sample, which broadened my ear, made me more educated. I learned about reading about the personnel on records. It just expanded my horizons in a way that I never wouldâve just expanded it on my own.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo this is â94 which is maybe the most competitive year in rap music history.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYeah.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI call it the platinum era.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThe golden era was before the platinum era.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThis is the platinum era?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWhere people are really going platinum.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. Drug deals are accepted too. Before that they werenât.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight. So youâre competing with the likes of Biggie, competing with... Nas drops in â94, Wu-Tangâs doing their thing in â94, Craig Mack. Itâs a lot of stuff happening. Murder Was The Case soundtrack. That album drops in the fall of â94, right? Fourth quarter, yeah?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo all the big dogs are out.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. Not to mention Chronic is still tearing up the atmosphere. Doggystyle. So imagine weâre like, âTake It Easyâ and all of thatâs happening. Weâre like, âOh man.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd itâs a big change from Can I Borrow a Dollar? to Resurrection. Itâs a completely different sound.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nCommon was kind of rapping almost like a Das EFX. He had a fast rap. This was a totally different sound.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, this was like, âHey man weâre gonna get serious. Stop playing around. Iâm not playing, youâre not playing, letâs go.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo what changed the mindset? Is it because you saw...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, we traveled. We saw the pennies was flying, everything. We were like, âHey man weâre gonna be back at home.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nLetâs turn up.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nLetâs not go back home empty handed.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWeâre not going home.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWeâre gonna go home with a W.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes. 100%. Without a doubt. So now it was like pitbull mentality. It was no longer, we just want to be respected, it was more like, âUh-uh, yâall not gonna do this to us, make us look crazy out here, no.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd so that album [Resurrection] happens. âI Used to Love H.E.R.â Looking back itâs a classic album, undisputed, but at the time when it dropped how did you feel it was received? Were you disappointed? Because I read somewhere it sold like 2,000 copies in the first week. I donât know if thatâs true or not but.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, thatâs true. At that point I donât even know that we even were conscious of first week sales like that. I think we were still just more like, âOh man, weâre getting good reviews. Oh man, certain people are calling us up saying they like it, people that we respect.â I think that was probably more important to us, because again I donât think we had any concept of... Puff and Big hadnât threw the rollies in the sky just yet.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nIt wasnât quite there yet.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, the Cristal didnât really... it wasnât in our club as a purchasable option.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nIt was still about respect, having skills, having dope beats, being able to find the obscure samples, having the best beats, having the best run. Thatâs what it was then.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. It was just a different time period, thatâs what Iâm also trying to say. Not making light of any of the eras. I hadnât even looked at myself as a producer. I look at us like a group, like Gangstarr or whatever, Pete Rock and CL Smooth. We just wanted to be accepted and appreciated.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd once that happens, what was the climate like in the city? So you come back home, you come back to Chicago, how were you guys treated when you come back? Because I feel like now thereâs a scene happening.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, and then across town you got Crucial Conflict and Do or Die, and Twista, theyâre selling records. Weâre like, âHey, woah.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWeâve never talked about this and this is something Iâve always wanted to ask you.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo, thatâs good. We never talkedâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYeah, we havenât talked about this before.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAlright, good. Letâs go.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWeâre not just going through the motions.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nLetâs go.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo, what is that like? You have this critically acclaimed album, everybody loves it, the videoâs getting heavy rotation, Rap City, everybody loves âI Used To Love H.E.R,â the âResurrectionâ videoâs crazy. But then you come back to Chicago and itâs like, OK well weâre not selling a ton of records. But across town, even though Traxster is from the south side heâs producing for Do or Die who have a smash hit with âPo Pimp.â They rebrand Twista from a gimmick rapper to OK, this dudeâs for real and then you got Crucial Conflict. Theyâre going gold and platinum.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWhat are you feeling?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI think it was such an artistically different expression that we had not accepted that as a competition. We kind of just looked at it like, âOh wow, that can happen,â more than, âWait a minute, why is that happening?â The funny thing is, I joke with Traxster about how it was this unspoken tension between us for years and it wasnât until we werenât in Chicago that we were like, âHey man, hey. Whatâs up?â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThe No I.D. versus Traxster stuff. I remember that.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. It wasnât something that really bothered us. It wasnât something that reallyâ¦ had it been the type of music we were making and it was doing those numbers, we probably wouldâve felt a way. But I think we just looked at it like, âOh OK.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nIt was such a different sound.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, it was more like, âWow thatâs possible for someone here.â And I think thatâs what you get going into One Day Itâll All Make Sense and itâs like, âOK, letâs expand. Letâs work with Erykah Badu, letâs work with Lauryn Hill, letâs work with Cee Lo, letâs work with The Roots, letâs work withâ¦ It was no longer about letâs just go in the basement and make some music. Now itâs like letâs try and win. Not just be credible.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight. Then thatâs when the commercial aspirations began.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBut nothing was a super reach.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo. It was still within the wheelhouse.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYeah, right.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThatâs what I mean. It wasnât like we were like, âOh man, weâve got to make some like so and so.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou didnât do a G-funk album or something like that.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo, no, no, no. No, no, no. But we didnât... Again, weâre still talking about some young south side kids who stumbled upon this music and are experimenting in every possible way, trying to hold onto something for artistic purposes as well as to keep making a living, because a lot of the money we made was just touring, it wasnât like big money yet. Never.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nDespite what people see on TV, theyâre like, âOh man, these guys are rap stars now.â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, man. Those three albums, I never made over $5000 a beat. For me.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThatâs just what it was.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThere was a lot more money in the industry back then.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThereâs people who start out right now get offended.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIf you tell them 2000 theyâre like, âWhat?â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThat have never had a placement.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nItâs crazy. One of the things that I remember about the One Day Itâll All Make Sense era is that at the same time they were marketing that album they were marketing your album.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nCould we play something? Could we play something from that?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nReally?\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou donât want me to?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nOK. Iâve got to give them a number. These arenât notes. Can we play... I guess they are notes. Letâs play number four.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWhatâs number four?\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nâState 2 State.â\n\n(music: No I.D. â âState 2 Stateâ / applause)\n\nAlright. Do you want to run it back?\n\nAudience Member\n\nYessir!\n\nNo I.D.\n\nStop that.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou canât... You really canât ... Itâs not on streaming.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWeâre here... This is a conversation with No I.D.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWe may not play any more music.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThis is not a concert.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThatâs right. But interesting about that album, you canât find it on streaming.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nUh-uh. Yeah, so watch this. This is what happened. In the process of doing maybeâ¦ coming out of the first album there was this A&R, Peter King, that worked at Relativity that we did the deal with. I go to him one day because Iâm just thinking like that, âSo what are you looking for?â Heâs describing it and I go, âCool.â I go, make a demo. And this was all part of me going like... Again, I used to just be able to do it so I didnât... I was like, âMan, Iâma make a couple extra dollars, be the third guy in the crew, whatever.â And I just go make a demo, six songs in like two days, and he gives me a record deal.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThat easy?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThat easy. Then Resurrection works, which really puts me in the place of like, âWhy am I doing that?â I think this is working now, I donât have to divide my time. I stopped working on it, I didnât even work on it. I had this budget sitting there and after Resurrection works Peter comes to me and he was like, âHey man, what are you doing? I gave you... Whereâs the record?â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWhereâs the album? I gave you a budget.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIâm like, âAh man, Iâve got to make it.â I literally took my budget...\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nItâs amazing that you still have it.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nBought a house, built a studio in the house.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBuilt a studio, literally built it, like didnât hire anybody?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHammer and nails.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nBought the equipment, put it in there. Got with Dug Infinite.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nShout out to Dug, yeah.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nShout out to Dug Infinite. And made a record in the basement. Engineered it, mixed it, recorded it.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nEverything.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nIt was very cheap to make for you.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nBecause at this point I was like, âWell how am I going... This is a budget. I want the money.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight. Keep the budget for yourself.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, Iâm like...\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nKeep the overhead low.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIâm like, Iâm going to end up with a house and a studio, I can do something with that. If I just end up with a record... Iâve seen it, it may not mean a thing. I think what happened with that album, going back to why you say you canât hear it, is I remember going into the company one day and talking to the higher-ups and theyâre like, âYeah, you know man Diddy is killing it right now, man. We need...â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThis is â97.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. Now itâs like...\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThis is Diddy era.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNow the pressure is on. Iâm like, âYou know what? I quit.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBefore the album drops?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI quit.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou filmed the one video.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI said, âIâm going to shoot one video, Iâm going to do two shows, thatâs it.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou did not promote the album at all?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWow.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI was like, âThatâs it.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nNever to be a rapper again.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo. I made the decision right there like, âNo, yâall are not going to make me not...â Iâm me. Iâm not going to be that. Youâre not going to make me want to be something Iâm not. I didnât even feel comfortable being that guy that youâre talking to me about.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nShout out to Puff. I love him, brother of mine, but anybody that knows me, my personality just wasnât even built for that era.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI immediately was like, âThis is...â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThat was the heart of the shiny suit era, the pinnacle of that.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYou said that, I didnât say that.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nItâs fine. They can come for me, itâs no big deal. I was a fan of the jiggy era, I have no shame in that, but that was not you.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNot me at all. I made that decision early and I shut the door fast.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThatâs when Relativity got picked up by a major... They had a major... Were they with MCA?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. They had Bone Thugs-N-Harmony.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThey had some real money at that point.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. Things had just taken a whole ânother turn.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThereâs more money in rap than ever.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes. Iâm looking at it now and Iâm going, âAlright, Iâve got to recalibrate and figure this out.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAt the same time... Because I just remember there was a very dope dual marketing campaign for your album and Commonâs One Day Itâll All Make Sense.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nMm-hmm. But that... There was tension...\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThatâs what I was going... Yeah.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThat started our first tension, which all lifetime friends go through. I think that was when I started having different thoughts and ambitions and Iâm like, âMan, letâs have a label together. We could sign these people. Weâve got these two girls over here, Latifah and Shawnna. This kid...â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThe kid from The Syndicate.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nâThis kid Kanye over here. Weâve got...â You know, and Iâm like, âWe can... and then just roll and then... Man, we could be like the new Death Row.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nLetâs Dr. Dre this shit.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. Letâs do it. Heâs like, âNo.â Next thing I know heâs like, âOh, you cut that deal for you, huh? OK.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHe was tight he didnât get a stake, he wanted that.\n\nNo I.D\n\nAlthough it looked like a cool double rollout it was tension, it was bad.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThat started the initial breakup between No I.D. and Common, that first breakup.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI donât even call it a breakup. That was when he was like, âOh, Iâm not the golden one.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHe was like, âOh, youâve been plotting to be the solo guy the whole time.â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nâOh, youâre going to help others and youâre... OK.â Not negatively. I think it was more of... knowing him this many years I think it was a level of insecurity, of, âMan, my brother is not 100% behind me now. What am I going to do?â Not more like I need to be ego style, more like man, I better expand. The next thing heâs like, âYeah, Iâm moving to New York.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThat was it.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWell, it didnât have to be because a few things happened in that time period, I think he had the beef with [Ice] Cube and I was like, âNah, Iâm not with that.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nIs that why Pete Rock did âThe Bitch In Yooâ?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, because I wouldnât continue. I was like... I donât feel the spirit of that. It felt wrong to me. It didnât feel like it was going in the right place and I never was one to... I didnât care about the money, I just felt like, âI donât like the spirit of where itâs going.â That was the first time I had ever not produced for him, it was cause for an outside producer. Before it might be a remix or something, but I think that was also a strain and him being like, âOh, I canât count on you to do everything? OK, then I need to expand what Iâm going to do too.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo then the famous Chicago thing of youâve got to leave to get on, so he leaves.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnd then itâs like... I could have left too because we had left before, but I think at that point I go, âNah, I donât want to do that.â And then we both were like in the valley of decision, which I had to decide what I wanted to do and he had to figure out a way to keep going.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nI would imagine that was very tough. You guys were young, I mean that was...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. Again, weâre still talking about kids. I want to say this is... What year was that?\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThatâs â97.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWeâre still in our mid-20s, we donât know. We just made music for some years and traveled around touring and having fun. I think that was my first time where I was like, âOK, what is my career? Itâs not just producing with Common.â I donât know what that means. I donât even know how to... I had to literally take a step back, but luckily I had a house, a studio. I had some things...\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSome artists that you were... You were getting calls from other artists to produce for them too, right?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou were turning them down at the...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWho were some of those artists?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI mean just like... People would be like, âB.I.G wants some beats.â Iâd be like, âNah, Iâm Commonâs guy, I donât...â Ghostface wants some beats, have you heard this and that?â Iâm like, âNah, I donât...â Later Iâm like...\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWhat? I passed on giving Biggie a beat?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBut youâre a loyal guy.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nBut no, youâve got to look at the... Nobody did that back then. Pre-Illmatic, nobody did that.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nOne producer.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nOne artist.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nEither one team or one producer. It wasnât a concept, it was like, âHuh?â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYeah. What was that sound like? Itâs not...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nItâs not like, âOh man, Tribe Called Quest is working on an album, letâs submit beats.â [laughter]\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThat was not a thing.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo. âLetâs submit to Pete Rock & CL Smooth?â No, it just didnât work like that.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nCouldnât submit a beat for Doggystyle?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo. No, itâs Dre and his team. It wasnât... Again, some of the stuff was... It was just... It wasnât until it started spreading out that I was like, âOh man, I blew it. I blew it.â But I mean luckily I had those little... I built that little nest egg, which saved my life.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBecause Iâm guessing you were pretty tight once Common has his first big record, once he stops working with you.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo, I donât think I was...\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWere you upset or happy about that?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI think I was indifferent. I may not have liked the fact that he now had a big budget and I didnât. I donât get my payday after all those years.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nLike J Dilla and those guys that get the big checks for that.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. Iâm like, âReally? Youâre going to pay them, huh?â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYeah.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nOK. But again, in my mind itâs still like, my personality is like, itâs possible. Alright, so what do I want to do now? Because ultimately weâre responsible for ourselves, no oneâs responsible for anything for us. Although you may have expectations or pain or growing pains or whatever, nobody owes us anything. I always knew that and it just inspired me to open a new chapter.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHow did you start the new chapter?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThatâs a good question. But I know youâre a historian and you know. I donât know, what was I... OK, I think... It was... OK, I helped Syndicate get a deal. I was trying all kind of stuff. I was like, âI stopped producing rap, Iâm going to do R&B.â I just started doing a bunch of R&B, which was making me grow but I started to get these little scattered placements.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight. Thatâs how... I was watching from afar, you were popping up on a G-Unit album.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, G-Unit. Jay-Z.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nGhostface.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nBeanie Sigel. Toni Braxton.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYeah. You were on The Blueprint 2.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHow were you maneuvering that at the time? Did you have management? Were you...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIn and out of different guys, experimenting. Nothing really... Just like...\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWere you still in Chicago at the time?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI was.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHow difficult was that?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nTough years. Tough years.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWere you flying back and forth to New York, LA with like...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah but not really, Iâm just here and Iâm trying to really do it from here because I built the studio and Iâve got this studio here and Iâve got this house and Iâve got these people and I always had these aspirations to build these camps and these circles and teams and win. And I saw Trax and them did it, and they all... Although, oh man it looked like it fell apart a little but we could do it, we could do it. It wasnât as easy as I thought.\n\nI remember a time I sat in the basement with the keyboard player that I was working with named Shabazz, and I said, âAlright listen, here are these blank DATs...â DAT tapes. Recording tapes, digital recording tapes, and they were like 90 minutes. I was like, âWeâre going to fill them all up with music. Some people are going to come, some people are going to go, some things are going to happen, some things are not going to happen, but letâs just keep filling them up. I guarantee you something is going to happen if we keep going.â\n\nWe just started doing it and we just were filling it up, filling it up. People were coming, people were going. It was almost like paint the fence, Karate Kid, wax on, wax off. From that just different things were happening. Around Resurrection I developed that relationship with hip-hop. It was at Roc-A-Fella, this was around Jay-Zâs first album. At that time, no big deal it was just... He wasnât the biggest rapper.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBuilding a rapport with other industry people.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nOh, of course. I just started meeting different camps and I would go in and out. I was supposed to be involved in the Roc-A-Fella thing with the Blueprint [agency] and all of that. I think it was really just... I didnât like the paperwork.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nIt just kind of scared... You felt maybe you had been burned in the past and...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI worked all these years, man I want my money now. I want my money.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight. No more scraps.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. No, no. I remember clearly it was like me, Bink, Just [Blaze] and Kanye. Me and Bink were like, âWe donât like this business.â Because really if you go back and if you look at the back of Beanieâs album, all of us; it says produced by all of us for Roc the World.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight. Yeah, for The Reason album.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nMm-hmm. That was what the team was going to be.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRoc-A-Fella was trying to keep you guys as like aâ¦ make you guys...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nGee Roberson and hip-hop.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThe crew was going to be called what?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nRoc the World.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWow. I didnât even know that. You got me.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAh, thatâs something.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou got me.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI think we all looked at the paperwork and Justin and Ye were like, âWe donât care, whatever.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThey were like, âWhatever, weâre going. Weâre in.â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWeâre down.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nTheyâre a lot younger and more inexperienced.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWhatever. I think we were like, âNo.â It was funny because there were certain people back after that happened that was like, âOh man, you blew it. Itâs over. You blew it. Youâre a dummy.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBecause Roc-A-Fella just explodes at that point.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nExplodes.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHottest label in the world.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYouâre in Chicago like, âI could have been a part of that.â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, but at this point I had stubborn pride, Iâm like, âNope.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nI mean that ...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nToo many years now. Too much blood, sweat and tears. Iâm like, âNah, I donât want to just be cool and accept it. I did that.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo then your understudy or your mentee, Kanye, goes the route, blows up.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou probably... I donât know if you expected that to happen\n\nNo I.D.\n\nOf course not. Of course not. I would be a liar.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThatâs what I... You probably thought...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnybody that ever says that is a liar. I was there. I saw every... I know. Even if you thought he was going to win, nobody could have predicted that.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHeâs going to be one of the biggest stars on the planet at one point.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nCome on. Hey Dion, your mother knows his mother. She helps out the little kid. Heâs going to be the biggest... No.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHeâs just coming to your house knocking on your door bothering you. Youâre doing grown-up stuff and heâs just...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIâm like, âCome on man take these records, sample them, please. Go home.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYouâre having him find samples for you, basically.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo, Iâm just like, âThis is how you do beats. Go home and do this. Stop. Get out of my door. Iâve got grown folk stuff to deal with, do you understand whatâs going on?â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYeah. Get out.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd then boom, College Dropout explodes, Kanye becomes one of the biggest rappers.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYouâre watching that, youâre probably like, âWhat the ...â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo, now Iâm just going like...\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWho knows, right? The whole thing is a gamble.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnythingâs possible now. Everything is possible. Now Iâm like, âOh man, I could fly to the moon if I want to.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnything is possible. This kid that I ...\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nItâs beyond disbelief Iâm sure at this point.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. No, now itâs like... Because youâve got to understand again my personality is when it happens I go... I donât go like, âI should have...â People donât know this, I was his manager early. I took him to meetings with labels and all kind of stuff. It wasnât just... I wasnât trying to be a mentor.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThat wasnât a concept.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHeâs probably acting wild in meetings and youâre just like, âOh, man. Theyâre never going to let me back in here.â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. I remember we left one meeting with Columbia, and hereâs the irony. He was like, He told Don Ienner, âIâm going to be the next Michael Jackson.â We were just like [drops head / laughter] Everybody. They were like, âOK, so have a good day.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nNever call us again.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. Came in the limo, left in the taxi. I remember I got home and I was playing a video game with Peter Kang because we were co-managers of him at the time and I go, âI donât think I should manage you, man. I just donât think itâll work.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHe was devastated.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAgain, this is back to the same thing, Iâm like, I go... Iâm the guy that was like, âI shouldnât rap.â Iâm a realist. It wasnât about what I could make off of him, I was like, âMan, I donât really think I can handle...â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nJust your personality.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. Iâd go crazy. Iâd rather just help you and get nothing. I think thatâs what preserved our relationship over those years is that I never really asked for anything.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou werenât in his pockets, you didnât try to sign him to a production deal or something like that.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo, I just helped. When it happened it was more like, âAha! Ha! OK.â More space to conquer. More possibilities. Less judgment of people I meet. Immediately I threw out the window right now, I never know who Iâm talking to could be the next biggest thing in the world.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThatâs a lesson to learn. You donât know who is going to be what.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. They put my ego in check. It brought me to a more humble place of respecting each and every person for their potential, even when you donât see it because you never know. You canât measure yourself in a way to compare with anyone, you just have to measure yourself to decide where you want to go, not versus anyone because... The hardest thing about, and anybody... I liken this to a Chicago trait but it might just be a human trait, but Iâve really experienced it more here. But it might just be because Iâm from here. The hardest thing really was never about the success or the lack of success of my peers, it was always the other people. This is how the other people go, âHey man, your manâs doing real good, man.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight. Theyâre in your ear, making you feel like youâve...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nâHe call you lately man?â âWhy? What are you talking about?â âIâm just saying man, you know heâs right here with you man, now heâs doing that man and youâre... Man, the least he could do is...â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThatâs the worst thing. Thatâs the worst part. Theyâre making it worse. Youâre probably on theâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIâm like, âHey man, Iâm going at my pace. Itâs okay.â âIâm just saying man, he already over there man. He ainât called you back man?â âHey man, relax. Iâm okay.â Being able to deal with that because I watch a lot of people not be able to deal with that, I donât mean just in music, I mean in life, which is being able to accept your pace in life and not compare it to the other pace of people you know, people you donât know, and allowing it to energize you versus discourage you is a big part of the reason I have a career, and that I can sit in front of you and talk. Itâs not that Iâm really that smart or that creative genius and all those things that we toss around, and I absolutely donât accept for myself, but I actually just believe that I know how to curtail the negative part that can emerge.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBecause thatâs what can mess you up, thatâs what can derail you.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. No, thatâs really why a lot of people have spikes. They do good and they donât, because the pressure of all these things, if you donât have the right character youâll implode, and youâll be unable to restart humbly and reinvent and grow when necessary. I do it all the time. I never created anything in my life sitting down thinking, âHow amazing am I?â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight. Not that ego.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo, I just sit down and go... Iâm a 17-year-old at heart still trying to make music that people like and itâs a new group of people. They may not know me and they might not care what I did. We might be talking about things right now that somebodyâs like, âI donât even care about that part of the story. Move on to the important stuff. How can I get a deal?â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWhatâs the secret recipe? Itâs character and itâs education because throughout all these times the part Iâm leaving out is, Iâm actually meeting people and Iâm learning. And Iâm really putting pressure on myself to elevate my level of education to the point today when I go seek out mentorship with Quincy and Stevie and the people that worked with them, because I feel like we have all this information with these giants and our generation does not take those jewels, and we donât pass those jewels on, and they get lost and we see our greats pass on. We treat them bad until they die and then we celebrate and we play all the records and we cry and...\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nStreams go up a million percent.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, but theyâre right here.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThey wonât be forever.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnd they wonât, and they will gladly tell us three-fourths of what we donât know and what weâre trying to figure out. Having a level of humility can allow you to access that information and prolong your stay and what you do no matter what you do. I donât care what you do.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWhat would you credit... After all that happens, and I can fast-forward a little bit. Youâre back in the game big, youâre getting these major placements, youâre producing âD.O.A.â for Jay-Z. You...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIâll do the short version. I humble myself, I sit at home, Iâm sitting there too long, âMan, this ainât working. Why...â Man, I know Jermaine Dupri, why is Jermaine Dupri better than me? Iâm going to humble myself and say, âHey, JD Iâm coming down to work with you. Letâs work together.â âWhy do you want to work with me?â âBecause I just want to work, I want to learn.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThat was... Why did you call Jermaine Dupri?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nBecause Iâm just educating myself and you obviously know something I donât know.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHe has all these hits, I mean heâs...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nâYouâre killing.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nDid you go down there like Usher Confessions time?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIt was right after.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nOK. Heâs got the... Heâs the...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nHeâs got the sauce.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nIf you guys donât remember, thatâs a 10 million sell, thatâs a diamond album.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. Iâm like, âMan, I donât even know whatâs going on. Iâve got to see.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHeâs doing Mariah, heâs doing... Youâre down there watching this all happen.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAll of them. Nelly, Mariah, Usher, Bow Wow. Iâm like, âMan, yâall just killing.â Iâm like, âMan, I know Iâm good, I should be able to...â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIâm looking in the mirror trying to figure this out. I just say, âMan, hey I want to work with you.â Heâs like... But I knew that I had more ârespectâ and he had more money... success. Letâs not call it money. Success.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHe had money, he had hits.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWe talked about it.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHe had respect on the charts.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI felt it was a trade. I was like, âIâve got some sauce, youâve got some. Letâs see what happens.â Thatâs where I learned how to make big records. I made the Bow Wow record, I made a couple of other... I produced a record for Plies.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nI like that song.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIâm just saying, I humbled myself. You guys donât even know, I was humbling myself. I was like... To get everything, empty your cup.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHow hard was that?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nHow hard?\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nFor you to ...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIt was hard. Because when youâve got respect, doing a certain thing, the last thing you want to do is risk that currency.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight. âCause you canât get it back.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, the last thing I want is Pete Rock to be like, âHa ha ha.â [laughter]\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nâYou tried to sell out, and you bricked.â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. You know, itâs like, âNaw, man, I gotta...â but I was trying to expand it, because you know what it really was? I saw Puff and D.DOT [Deric Angelettie] expand Kanye.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThey took his sound and...\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWell I saw him, he got a piece from me, and then I saw him mix it with a piece, and then Jay, and then I saw a bunch of pieces that equaled something else, right? And I was like, âWhat?â Again, I donât go... I donât have that ego, I go, âIâm gonna make some pieces,â right? Whatâs some other pieces that nobodyâs paying attention to, right?\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo let me go to JD, who has the sauce, but OK, I see what you did.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYou see what I mean?\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIâm like, thatâs a whole other world, I go thereâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nIt was untapped.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnd the first thing, heâs like, âLetâs go to the strip club.â Iâm like, âStrip club? Iâve never been in a strip club in my life, why would I go to a strip club? Iâm over here trying to make music.â And then I go in there, and itâs like a club with a few naked people. And Iâm like, âThis is different.â [laughter]\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo you just got immersed in the Atlanta culture? You got to seeâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnd Iâm like, âOh, OK, I get yâall records now. I understand. Yâall go to the club and itâs naked people walking around, OK. And thatâll just dance with you for a couple dollars.â Iâm like, âThis is okay. I get what youâre saying in these records now.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd this is why itâs working here, and not working in Chicago?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, âcause you know, some of the records might sound like soliciting a prostitute, right? Now, Iâm like, âNo, ohâ¦â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nI get it.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nClub. Throw some dollars at you. Got it. Oh thatâs the dance you all do in the club. Oh, got it. [laughter]\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo you take this information, and I can just see, everythingâs turning in your brain. Next thing you know, you get a couple placements on Jay-Z, American Gangster album.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes. Which was... Iâd already worked with Jay, I already went through the Roc the World, da da da da da, and heâs like, âLetâs go work with Jay.â âCause now he knows my currency isâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHe can walk you in that.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. He called me in, and then itâs like, âAw yeah, this is my...â now Iâm blindfold, this is what I do, right? And thatâs when we did the two things for American Gangster. And I think thatâs when I began to round out my proper perspective of how much underground hip-hop or cultural hip-hop, south side hip-hop, Common, this, that, mix it with my newborn southern R&B hit information. And codes, as me and Kanye call it. I was like, âI got new codes, in different area codes.â No.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBut it all clicks?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nEverything that youâve been working towards.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nRight.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAt this point, youâre probably in your 30s, right? So it didnât happen super young, and I think a lot of times, young people get like, âMan, if I donât get on by the time Iâm 27, I donât have a career.â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI donât know many people that got on that young, that do anything in their 30s. Itâs not many.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI donât know many people that didâ¦ people when I started, that still actively do music, so itâs definitely not about when you get on.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nItâs once you figure it out.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. Itâs really just about your trajectory, and understanding that you donât want to peak, you want to keep going up.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nA steady incline?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes. A peak is a reason to fall, for me, in my perspective. Iâve never seen anyone hold a peak up forever. Matter of fact, the more you peak, the more you hate it.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYeah, and the harder you fall.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes. The harder youâre pulled down.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYeah, itâs tough to get back up after that. And youâve... your whole career has just been a steadyâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. Iâm just the little engine that could.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo after that, you explode. In my opinion, you created the sound for 808s & Heartbreak. That is... you play a lot in that, right? Iâll say it, you donât have to. Then everybodyâs calling. Then, you make your transitionâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWell, no, Iâm gonna tie that together. Really, Kanyeâs moms passed, and Malik Yusef goes âDion, you gotta be there for him.â I go, âDo I?â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRelationshipâs notâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nItâs not bad, itâs just, heâs a superstar. I got a different personality. I donât want to hang out, I donât want to... you know, Iâm just different. Iâm just studying, Iâm learning, Iâm growing, you know, that environment is just not really... you know, âcause remember, heâs younger than me. So, when he was 14, I was 20, he was the young kid. By the time Iâm 26, heâs 20. By the time heâs 26, I donât wanna hang out like that, right? So, heâs like, âNaw, he needs you, Dion, and you know, he trusts you.â And Iâm like, âYouâre right,â and I literally reconnect our relationship, non-musically. We just start talking more. And one day we just saw each other, and heâs like, âYeah, Iâm about to go to Hawaii and work on some beats for Jay, you wanna come and work together?â Now mind you, Iâm like, âWhat do you mean work together?â Iâm like, âWe donât work together, we help each other,â right? But Iâm like, âCool.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYouâre not gonna turn that down.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nSo we flew out to Hawaii, and we really did work for Jay, and it turned into us creating a system thatâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThe Blueprint 3, you were working on that first?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThatâs what we were working on, and it wasnât until we made âHeartlessâ that he was like, âNaw, Iâm doing an album.â And that was how 808s & Heartbreak came into play.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHe saw the sauce you were giving Jay, and was like, âActually...â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nâIâm not giving him that.â I was like, âJust give it to him,â he was like, âNo.â Matter of fact, Iâm gonna imitate himâ¦ [moves his head, puts on voice] âHell no!â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYeah, he said, âIâm keeping that, thatâs staying.â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, and the next thing you know, heâs gone touring, and Jay is like... [throws up his hands]\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nâYou had that the whole time?â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nHe like, âWhat happened to my album?â And again, me having that relationship, over these years... Because mind you, Iâm a Chicago person at heart, which means, and you guys will know this: Itâs hard for us to become friends with people when we really donât know them yet. So I know them, but weâre not... yeah.\n\nAnd itâs funny, because fast forward, and all of that leads to eventually: He comes back, we do, finish The Blueprint, I do âDeath of Auto-Tune.â And I remember, one day heâs in the garden, and he walks past me, and I donât really say nothing, and he stops, and he goes and looks back at me, heâs like, âMan, you ainât gonna speak?â And I was like, âMan, this your space man, I donât know you like that, to be just walking up to you speaking. Invite me into your space.â He feel like, âMan, you been around me all these years.â âAw man, forget it man.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAt that point you feel comfortable around Hov.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nStill not?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNot yet. Fast forward, it really wasnât until 4:44 that we became friends, right.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nDid you guys talk throughout thoseâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWe would talk, but it was not... heâs, you know, heâs an introvert, too. You know, all of his rapsâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHe makes it seem like heâs a big extrovert?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, fake hugs, fake wassups. All of that. He not opening up, right? And Iâm not opening up. So, sort of the funny part is during the 4:44 sessions one day, he come like, âMan, you like a good guy, man.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYouâre like, âThanks, it only took you ten years.â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI was like, âYou are too, man. I had no idea.â Heâs like, âI thought you was rude.â I was like, âWhy would you think Iâm rude?â Heâs like, ââCause you would never speak. You would just come in my studio, you donât say nothing.â I was like, âI was being respectful.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWow.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAlright, now we gotta rewind back.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo thatâs how you earned your respect with Jay-Z? Being humble?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI donât know, thatâs how we became friends. Because now weâre friends. And I donât even use that... itâs not like I got a lot of friends in the business.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd thatâs why 4:44 turned out the way it did?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou had a real bond, relationship?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYes. And we knew how to deal with each other in a way that brought the best out of each other, not just musically, but just enjoying everyday, it was really fun and therapeutic.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHe was probably looking for somebody like that, right?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI donât know that he was looking for it.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHow did that even come about? How did he even breach the, âHey letâs do an album together, where itâs just me and youâ?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWe never said that.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nNothing.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIt was never a conversation. He would see me, and true story, he would be like... Iâll tell some of the funny ones. One time I saw him at the... âcause itâll lead into some more things on your list. He saw me at the Tidal thing, right? Heâs like, âMan, where the butters at?â Iâm like, âHuh?â Heâs like, âThe beats, man, where the butters, man, wassup? Man, where the beats?â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThatâs just what he said? He just casually rolled up on you?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nIâm like, âMan, you know I got this job now.â Heâs like, âJob? Did you just say job?â Iâm like, âWhat you mean, yeah.â At the time Iâm like, âMan, I got this Def Jam thing.â Heâs like, âMan, god didnât make you to work no job.â Iâm like [drops mic / laughter] âYou know, god made you to make music, man. You canât never tell me you didnât make music âcause of a job.â Iâm like [shrinks space with fingers] And every time we would see each other, it would be another something. Next time. Fast forward another time, he saw me, like, âWhat you working on?â And I was like, âGetting better.â And heâs like, âWhat you mean?â âIâm working on getting better, thatâs what Iâm working on.â Heâs like, âYou ainât got no beats?â I said, âNo, Iâm working on getting better, man. At beats. And life.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd this job.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, no I didnât bring the job up ever again.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nEver again, that was the last... that was the last time you discuss the J-O-B.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nFair.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnd all that led to one day, when I did this thing, I made 100 beats, I was trying to wax on wax off again. Made 500 beats. âEureka, I think I got a new style.â I hit him. No, he hits me. âHey man, I need you to help me with this Vic Mensa.â And I go, âAnd I got some beats now.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBy the way.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnd heâs like, âHell yeah? Okay.â And Iâm like, âNah man, I got some beats this time.â Heâs like, âYeah, for sure, letâs, you know.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nâLetâs link up.â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, and Iâm like, âStop playing. I got some beats.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThis is on email?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo, I got the emails, too.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo this is allâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI was like, âI really got your next Blueprint-esque thing. I know thatâs a lot to say, but I think I got it.â Heâs like, âYeah, thatâs a lot to say.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou had his attention, his ears were standing up at this point.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo, I didnât have his... I just... he donât care. He donât care. So, we meet up, and I tear his ears off with beats, and heâs like, âMan, donât disappear man.â But I was like, âNo man, you donât understand.â So I just start emailing him beats everyday.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nJust packs, everyday?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nJust three to five, every day. Until the âKill Jay-Zâ beat, then he was like, âCome over right now.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThat hit him?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nâCome over to my house, right now.â Yeah, that was the one that... and then, it just turned into talk. It really wasnât, it was more like, âOh, we laid down a good song.â And then we just started talking, but everyday, I would just keep emailing these beats. And I was like, âIâm not gonna let up.â We joked like this, I was like, âMan, Iâm gonna outwork you man, you lazy. You ainât about this, Iâm about this. I do music. I donât know, you might not do music no more.â We talk crazy to each other.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou have that kind of rapport with Jayâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI just said to him last week, I was like, âYou still doing music, man?â Heâs like, âOh yeah? OK. No, I get it, I know what youâre saying. Iâm glad you said that.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo what started off as a Vic Mensa project now becomes 4:44.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, and of course, Vicâs like, âWhat?!â [laughter] He was like, âYo, câmon man!â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSee, right place right time with you, you gotta be right there. But thatâs revenge for, you know, when you did the âYe thing, 808s, so he got what he wanted.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYep, yep, yep, yep.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nWhat about, could you guys do more? Is there more coming, you think?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nWho?\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou and Jay? Who knows?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nJust gotta happen. You know. When you get in that friend zone, you donât look at it like that.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nItâs different? The relationshipâs different now?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, itâs just like... sometimes we do silly stuff, like just talk, sit on the grass and talk. [laughter]\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo itâs a real friendship now?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nRich people stuff. [laughs]\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYeah, rich people stuff. I wouldnât know about that. So, he doesnât ask you about the job anymore?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nDefinitely, he doesnât ask.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHe doesnât ask you about it?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo. I mean, at one point I was gonna... we had discussed me being at Roc Nation one time, but I think we got bigger views now, that we share, of goals we want to accomplish.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd speaking of job, I know the clock is ticking, weâre running out of time here, but I want to talk about you transitioning into an executive. How difficult was that? Or is that something that you always wanted to do? Or is that something that it just happened?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAbsolutely never wanted to do it. No ambitions whatsoever. It literally was just because one day, in Hawaii, this is [My Beautiful]Dark Twisted Fantasy time, probably. Kanye goes, âG.O.O.D Music is over, if you donât become the president, Iâm distancing myself from this.â And I go...\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nâWell, I guess I canât say no.â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI gotta say yes. So, with it being somewhat of a dysfunctional setup, I quickly saw that I could be deemed a failure. I donât like failing. I construct a plan in my mind, Iâm like, âI gotta make one thing work.â And again, here comes that little Malik Yusef voice. Heâs like, âBig Sean is good, man. You should help Big Sean.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nGot to love the voice of reason, Malik Yusef.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, Iâm like, âYou think so? Yeah, he is good, right? Yeah.â So I just go grab him, I take him to L.A.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHe was just kind of sitting there at the time?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNo, it was about to be donesies.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBad?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. So, that was four or five years he wasâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nHe was just sitting there?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, he put out projects. You gotta remember, he had all the looks.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSo many mixtapes, features.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, he had looks. So, I just, I grabbed him, we put together the project, and then I just turned it in, and everybodyâs like, âWhat the hell just happened with this?â So, at the timeâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou made a power move.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah, so at Def Jam, they was like, âMan, if we hire you, can you just keep doing that?â And I was like, âYeah. I can do that.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThat was from an A&R standpoint, right? They were like, âCan you just A&R,â or produce? What wasâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nJust whatever. Whatever you want to call it.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nâWe just want you.â\n\nNo I.D.\n\nâWe just want you to do that, again.â And I was like, âCool.â But then L.A. Reid leaves, he goes to Epic. So heâs like, âCome to Epic.â And then Karen Clark is like, âNo, come to...â And it led to me doing it. Now, once I got in there, and I started to look under the hood, I go, âAha.â And I felt like, and I told Jay this before, I was like, âI get what you saw. You went in there and saw it, and now youâre you. I just saw it.â But, I also felt an obligation to now educate myself, and put my 10,000 hours in. So again, I go back to humble myself, and go through the process. I think Iâm about 10,000 hours right now, on the exec side, now.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nI would say so, yeah.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. So now, I think Iâm armed and ready, because you know, I get it, you gotta remember, I started out when it was all indies, and then I watched the majors kill it, and then I watched the youth demand independence again. And I go, âWe had it in the first place.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd nobody wanted it, everybody wantedâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nNobody wanted it. And now, we want it. And I always go, âAlright, itâs cold outside. Be careful what you ask for.â You know? I always... I liken being independent to having your own tree house in the forest. Itâs yours. But thereâs ants. And rain.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThereâs a lot of weather.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnd no toilets. So be prepared. But, these majors are like mansions, that maybe thereâs a little mold on the wall. Maybe the pipeâs not right. But somebody gotta go in there and fix it. Or, we put the tree house in the mansion. But I donât wanna be in the forest. Iâm not falling for that. Itâs too much... I want to control something and make it better, it can serve us better, with minds thatâs been on both sides of it, that understand 10,000 hours there, 10,000 hours there.\n\nSo, it went from me doing something just because I could do it, to me actually seeing a purpose, and sticking in throughout all the corporate politics, and all the non-musical things I have to endure, to say, as a creative, cultural, minority, thatâs qualified, âIâm not gonna be denied the opportunity to take one of these ships and turn it in the direction we need it to go.â And Iâm just not gonna stop.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nAnd how difficult is that?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nYeah. Itâs difficult, because now youâre putting yourself at odds with people who are like, âWe donât want it to go that way.â\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nâCause theyâre stuckâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnd by the way, they make their living with it going that way. But, I donât care. And, I never needed a job anyway. So I got nothing to lose.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nFire me. But, I do think as long as you know, we make great records, find great talent, itâs the core of our business, and have great relationships, educate ourselves, you canât be denied. Itâs a Kanye trick.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nSomething that you learned from him?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nI learned from watching him. Canât be denied when you qualify yourself.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThatâs the soundbite. So, you know, to bring it back full circle, before we wrap it up and get into the Q&A, you know, as a pillar of the Chicago hip-hop community, youâve seen it, you were in it, watched it, now youâre able to kind of see it from afar and help nurture things. Are you happy with how the scene has gone, how itâs turned out? You know, kind of the seeds that youâve planted?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nOf course, âcause it was nothing. But, I hope to see more. From the standpoint of doing my history, I understand that Quincy was here, and Curtis Mayfield was here, and a lot of big companies were here. I would love to see us build out the business better. And not just be so creative. I think itâs gonna take some education, more than talent. And thatâs what I mean by some of these... a company has to invest in that, with a different business model. Understanding the long term gain. I think that the part that I get disheartened by here is that... the economic culture of the city causes a level of desperation that makes... itâs like pressure, and fear, that causes you to not think as you would if you were just in a state of calm. And I see a lot of mistakes that we make, that I wish we didnât make. Because you know, a lot of... the quicker we do that, and turn this resource around, and create opportunity, itâs gonna create less violence, itâs gonna create more growth. And it canât come from one person. It canât come from one of us, itâs actually gotta come... Of course, weâve seen the growth. I mean, look at Chance [the Rapper] , and different people. Iâm happy, I just... I guess Iâm anxious to see it really come together.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nCan it be duplicated? Can it be scaled?\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnd what we call it in the corporate world, scalable.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nCan we scale this? Or is it good for one? Or two? Or five? I want to see it good for 50, and then 500, and then 5,000, right? And thatâs not just the entertainer, thatâs the engineer, the studio owner, the promoter, theâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nThe manager, I mean everything. The studio owner, everything.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nEverybody. Create an economic cottage, right? And everybody has what they need in the cottage, and you start to trade services, and you start to bring income in, and build. Because thatâs the last thing that... I just would love to see us build more. And you know, to think, we just went over, my first record came out in â92.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nRight. Do you think itâs improved, since â92? If youâre looking atâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nOh, Iâm just getting good. Iâm just getting good. Iâm just now understanding what being a producer means. Beyond making music. Quincy Jones never gave Michael Jackson a beat. Itâs just not about that. Itâs something else. And Iâm learning. And Iâm gonna be able to apply this information to anything. But more than anything, I want to be able to apply it to other people, who can multiply it, right? Because I know I can only do so much. I already had to trudge through this thing when it was nothing, you know? My knees get tired. I needed to build 10 meâs, and then 10 meâs makeâ¦\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nBut you know if you can duplicate that, because you learned so much having to sludge through all that stuff.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYou have the knowledge that you can pass on to make itâ¦\n\nNo I.D.\n\nAnd Iâm trying to get the knowledge that didnât get passed on to me. And that is more important than me being the one to go build it and put my name on it, stick my chest out, say, âLook at me.â Itâs more about just creating the next opportunities for... that itâll be 20 Chances. So, you know, of course I tip my hat to everybody here thatâs doing great. I mean, again, I told you, Iâm humbled by everybody, because I donât really see myself as nothing except a smart guy that got out the trap.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\nYouâve continued to progress, and had an amazing career. And you know, thatâs why weâre here tonight. So thank you so much.\n\nNo I.D.\n\nThank you. [applause]"
