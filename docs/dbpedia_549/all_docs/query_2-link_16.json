These species are native to southern Africa, from South Africa northeast to Malawi. The genus has been introduced in various forms to every continent except Antarctica, often for ornamental purposes.\n\nCommon Names and Misconceptions\n\nCommon names for Zantedeschia species include arum lily, calla lily, and golden calla lily. However, it is important to note that these plants are not true lilies (family Liliaceae). Additionally, despite visual similarities, the genera Arum and Calla are distinct from Zantedeschia.\n\nDescription\n\nGeneral Physical Characteristics\n\nZantedeschia species are rhizomatous, herbaceous perennials. Depending on the species, they can grow from 15 cm to over 1 meter tall. They typically form clumps or clusters and have thick underground stems, either rhizomes or tubers.\n\nInflorescence\n\nThe inflorescence of Zantedeschia takes the form of a solitary pseudanthium, featuring a showy spathe and a central spadix. The spathe is a specialized bract that can be white, yellow, or pink, while the spadix contains the true flowers.\n\nFlower Structure\n\nZantedeschia is monoecious, with separate male and female flowers on the same spadix. Male flowers contain fused stamens, and female flowers have a compound pistil with fused carpels.\n\nLeaf Descriptions (Table I)\n\nInflorescence Features (Table II)\n\nTaxonomy\n\nClassification\n\nKingdom: Plantae\n\nClade: Tracheophytes\n\nClade: Angiosperms\n\nClade: Monocots\n\nOrder: Alismatales\n\nFamily: Araceae\n\nSubfamily: Aroideae\n\nTribe: Zantedeschieae\n\nGenus: Zantedeschia\n\nRecognized Species (Table of Eight Species)\n\nEtymology\n\nThe genus Zantedeschia was named by the German botanist Kurt Sprengel in honor of the Italian botanist Giovanni Zantedeschi (1773–1846).\n\nDistribution and Habitat\n\nNatural and Introduced Ranges\n\nZantedeschia species are native to central and southern Africa, from Nigeria to Tanzania and South Africa. They have been introduced to many parts of the world, including Europe, North America, Central America, South America, Oceania, and Australasia, where they are often considered invasive.\n\nHabitat Preferences\n\nZantedeschia species prefer marshy areas and can thrive in a variety of habitats, from wetlands to riparian zones. They are adaptable to different soil types and can survive minor frosts.
