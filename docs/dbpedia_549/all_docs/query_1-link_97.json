Minerals from far underground are incorporated into living leaves Leaves carrying minerals fall and form layer of mulch on top of soil Microorganisms break down mulch, minerals are re- leased to top layers of soil — where other plants can use them Minerals are transported from deep soil to leaves in top of tree Tap-rooted trees pick up minerals in solution from deep subsoil where roots of smaller plants cannot penetrate Wherever deep-rooted plants are growing they “mine” the subsoil for elements essential tt their life and growth. Dead leaves and other debris carrying these minerals fall to th< ground where they make a natural mulch. This mulch, when it decays, releases the minerals] to the topsoil ; it also adds organic material, thus keeping the topsoil in good physical con dition. The mulch helps prevent run-off of rain water, and reduces evaporation of moistur* from the soil. All these beneficial results man likewise accomplishes when he carries ou wise mulching practices. THE BROOKLYN INSTITUTE OP RTB ND SCIENCES BROOKLYN BOTANIC GARDEN lOOO WASHINGTON AVENUE BROOKLYN 25. NEW YORK TELEPHONE! MAIN 2-4433 Spring- 1957 In its simplest terms, mulching is man’s version of what happens on the floor of a forest where over the decades tree litter accumulates and gradually decays. The soft forest cushion that every lover of nature I likes to walk upon, is a natural mulch. It is in this accumulation of dead leaves, twigs, fallen branches, fallen trees, etc., that bacteria, fungi and 1 other simple living organisms carry on the process of decay. It is here, in nature’s scheme, that the raw materials borrowed from the earth and so dramatically “spun” into the architecture of living things, are equally dramatically released, i.e,, unlocked from one another, and returned to the earth in simple form — to be borrowed again and again by generations of living things. The elements once on loan to a hemlock for its lifetime, might a century or two later be on loan to an oak, a maple, or a pink lady-slipper. In adapting this natural mulch phenomenon to his cropping practices and to the growing of ornamental plants, man uses whatever dead organic matter may be available. The principle is the same. The labor saved and other manifold advantages of the practice are the subject of this Handbook. Guest Editor Frese, the authors he has invited to contribute, and our Editorial Committee, have all concentrated on bringing the finest possible how-to-do-it Handbook to our readers. If people generally understood the desirability of mulching prac- tices, we would never again need the phrase “Don’t burn leaves.” Perhaps the admonition should be “Be a mulcher.” The words may not be pretty ones, but they carry an idea that should have the attention of every thoughtful person whose fingers are in the soil.

Slate MULCHING has been a standard practice in my garden for several years. I much prefer it to cultivation. If I didn’t mulch my garden, its size would have to be greatly reduced. I spread mulch during the late fall and early winter, when the snow is not too deep. At this season there is little other gardening work to do. Labor Saving' The benefits of a mulch in the garden are several, but for me the saving of labor is most important. A thick mulch eliminates most of the weeds. Only a few of the strongest growing perennial ones are able to push through the mulch. Hoeing, therefore, is not necessary, though an occasional weed will have to be pulled by hand. The principal weeds not con- trolled by a mulch are bindweed, quack- grass and Canada thistle. In beds planted with bulbs, whose foliage dies down before fall, these weeds can now be eliminated with chemical weed-killers: bindweed with 2,4-D, quack-grass with Dalapon, and Canada thistle with amino- triazole. Moisture Benefits The second important benefit of a mulch is in the conservation of soil moisture. A good mulch will reduce the amount of water lost from the soil by direct evapora- tion by at least half. The moisture sup- ply that is kept uniform under a good mulch favors root activity in the surface soil. On a slope, runoff of heavy rains is prevented. Also, rain soaks into a mulched soil more readily because the physical condition of the soil is much improved. The effects of irrigation las > much longer on a mulched soil. Effects on Soil Soil temperatures are lower and mor uniform under a mulch than under clean-cultivated soil surface. This stabi lizing effect favors bacterial activity, j] mulch also prevents deep penetration o frost in winter, a very important featur when severe cold occurs without coverin the ground with snow. A straw mulch i especially effective. I remember that dui ing the winter of 1933-34, when record breaking low temperatures occurred with out a snow cover, tender rootstocks o fruit trees were injured. Another benefit of a mulch is the ini provement of soil structure and tiltl As the decaying organic matter work down into the soil, it becomes more friable is better penetrated by water, and it aeration is improved, thus stimulating root and biological activity. Rapidly de caving materials such as legume hay an ground corncobs are more effective tha slowly decaying ones such as peat most A mulch will prevent a heavy soil froi being compacted when walked on soo after a rain. Mulching also eliminates root injur caused by deep cultivation and hoeing Damage from deep tillage is far mori frequent than is generally realized. Ther; are few surface roots in a frequently tille^ soil. But in a mulched one feeding root are encouraged to develop in the top soil, the best soil in the garden. Some mulching materials, especial! legume hays and grass, add substantisj 6 Judkins Sawdust is an excellent multi-purpose mulch. The moist, friable condition of the soil under the mulch on this bed of green peas can be seen where the sawdust is scraped aside. I amounts of plant nutrients to the soil. I In fact, one experiment station worker says of mulching- fruit trees, “In the absence of fertilizer applications a hay mulch provides nearly ideal conditions for tree development and performance.” Mulched trees have substantially out- yielded cultivated trees, even when the cultivated trees were fertilized, and those mulched were not. However it is possible for the mulch to have a deleterious effect if a legume or heavily fertilized mulch is applied, for it will stimulate excessive late growth that may be susceptible to winter injury. Also, heavy mulching of ' apples for several years may result in poorly colored fruits and excessive drop- ping. Potash, which tends to be fixed near the surface of cultivated soils (because the surface is alternately wet and dry), penetrates much deeper in a mulched soil, which is more uniformlyr moist. Potash deficiencies are corrected most rapidly by supplying' potash in conjunc- tion with a mulch. Over a period of years hay and straw mulches will supply sub- stantial amounts of potash as they rot. Mulches have many other lesser bene- fits. They prevent drop fruits from bruising. Low-hanging' raspberries, goose- berries and strawberries are protected from splashing soil during heavy rains. Daffodils and low-growing flowers are not mud-spattered when mulched. In the spring, when the ground is soft and muddy, a mulch makes it possible to walk close to the plants. This is especially im- portant when the flower beds are not surrounded by grass. During the winter when there is no snow cover a mulch is necessary to pre- vent newly-set plants from being heaved out of the soil by frost action. Straw- McFarland Mulching azaleas with oak leaves. berries must be well mulched with marsh hay or straw to prevent freezing the crowns. Disadvantages Mulches have some disadvantages, too. Some materials are a fire hazard, so should not be used in large areas wher J careless smokers pass by.

Frost may be more injuriou: 1 to mulched plants, because a mulch pre J vents radiation of heat from the soil. Tin 4 heat radiated from bare ground may pre 1 vent frost damage. Materials There are many mulching materials J Those listed below are my favorites “I also, see the accompanying articles ir | this handbook. To be economically prac | tical, a mulch should be available in I quantity nearby and at a reasonable price ] Tt should be attractive, durable, and fin resistant, if possible. If the material is I to be used in working areas its appear- i ance is not as important. A Favorite Mulch Sawdust is excellent for many plants, i I use it regularly for all bulbs — lilies, 1 daffodils, tulips, crocus, scillas and all the small plants. They push through it easily in the spring. Later, the flowers| are protected from splattering mud dur- ing hard rains. At least once every spring the daffodils are beaten down by a heavy rain; but only a little sawdust splashes on them and it falls off as they dry. Without a mulch the daffodils would be ruined. I also mulch peonies and eremurus with sawdust, but many other plants could be G ilm a n Asparagus g r o w s u p J through 6-inch mulch of I maple leaves put. on the | previous fall. Mulches arel especially valuable on as- paragus because they con ! trol weeds, the ruin of] many an asparagus bed. S Gilman The presence of earthworms often indicates tine physical condition of the soil; here they are abundant under a straw mulch. ! mulched with sawdust, too. A friend of 1 mine mutches his gladiolus with sawdust. Blueberries respond well to a sawdust mulch, In fact, where sawdust 1ms been compared experimentally with other ma- terials and with clean cultivation, the sawdust-mulched plants have been mark- edly superior to the others. So far as I know, other ericaceous plants such as azaleas and rhododendrons have not been mulched experimentally with sawdust ; but there is no reason to doubt that saw- dust would be as effective with them as with the blueberries (see page 54). Sawdust is an unusually effective sum- mer mulch for everbearing strawberries. A hen they are grown under clean culti- vation in the matted row, yields are often disappointingly low. But when grown in hills and mulched with sawdust, excellent crops have been obtained. Sawdust may rob the soil of nitrogen because the bacteria, whose activity is encouraged by the sawdust mulch, draw heavily on the soil nitrogen. And in all except very fertile soils there is often not enough nitrogen for both plants and bacteria. Additional nitrogen should be applied to prevent this deficiency (see page 52). A lack of good green color in the foliage will indicate that additional nitrogen is needed. Spring bulbs ap- parently suffer less than plants that grow throughout the summer. In my garden lilies and garden vegetables have suffered most from a sawdust mulch. A sawdust mulch is applied in the fall or during the winter when the snow is not too deep. A mulch an inch or so deep: is enough for crocus, but the daffodils and larger plants get 3 or 4 inches, for the material settles considerably by spring. Blueberries and other shrubs will benefit from an even deeper layer. Any kind of sawdust is suitable, be it hardwood or softwood, fresh or rotted. Shavings are good too. Similar materials which might be suitable but which I have 9 Among other advantages, a mulch keeps soil in the garden where it belongs, instead of being tracked into the home or being splattered on low-growing flowers and vegetables. Surrounded by a mulch of wood shavings, this squash plant is glistening clean. Baled hay which has spoiled for feeding purposes is an ideal mulch material. Large pieces can be easily torn from the compressed pads and laid between rows of plants. •' Oilman photos I 10 not tried are excelsior, balsam wool and wood chips, sometimes available from tree companies which now grind up prim- ings with a wood chipper instead of haul- ing them away to be burned. (See page 40.) Second Choice Tree leaves are second on my list of mulching materials if enough are avail- able, because they are so easy to collect. In addition to the leaves from my own trees, I use ten to fifteen large truckloads each year. They are used mostly around shrubs and small trees where their smoth- ering effect is not harmful. Around the shrubs they are piled to a depth of S to 10 inches. But twelve months later, they are quite well rotted. A leaf mulch con- serves moisture very well and no weeds emerge except bindweed. The principal difficulty I've had with a leaf mulch is the Norway maple seeds that are con- tained in it. Literally thousands of seed- lings push their way through the leaves. Raking the leaves will destroy many of them, but usually I control them with a chemical brush-killer in oil, being very careful not to get it on the stems of shrubs. Tree leaves are very good for mulching rhubarb. I pile stalks of sweet corn around the plants and then cover them with several inches of leaves. This, plus a liberal application of a 10-10-10 fer- tilizer, produces a big crop on a small area. I also save enough leaves to mulch the vegetables and the more robust annuals. Tomatoes should always be mulched. Un- der clean cultivation the variable moisture supply often results in blossom-end rot affecting many of the first fruits. Mulched plants have few, if any, rotten fruits. The leaves are spread around the plants when they are staked or when the first blossoms appear. Other Materials Hay is third on my list. I grow my own and fertilize it heavily to get as much as possible. It is spread mostly around the young trees and shrubs and around the tomatoes. The hay looks good and provides lots of nutrients, but it rots fast. Fruit growers use rain-spoiled hay, which is no longer suitable for cow-feed. It may be had cheaply, in some localities just for the hauling. Near the coast, marsh hay is used very successfully as a winter mulch for strawberries, but it is a good growing-season mulch, too. How- ever, it may be rather expensive. Wheat, rye, and oat straws are stand- ard mulches for the strawberry bed, and when obtainable in quantity at reason- able prices, are often used also for fruit trees. Peat moss is one of the best materials for the more conspicuous areas of the garden, where appearance is important. Buckwheat hulls are good-looking and a satisfactory mulch. Spent hops are con- siderably less dressy, but make a good mulch, and the beery smell soon dis- appears. Out where the tall corn grows, ground corncobs have been used for roses, for which they are highly recommended. They are undoubtedly good for most other garden plants as well. About twenty-five years ago mulch paper was tried extensively, but it soon lost favor. Recently black polyethylene film has been proposed as a mulch for vegetables and strawberries grown in rows. Preliminary reports from Califor- nia indicate that the plastic film is satis- factory. Berry rot is decidedly reduced and weed control is nearly complete. Vegetables that require much heat, espe- cially tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, cu- curbits (cucumbers, squash and melons), and sweet corn, should respond well to a polyethylene film mulch, which is ap- parently more durable than mulch paper. (See page 43.) Aluminum foil has also been used ex- perimentally as a mulch for vegetables. Flat stones have been used by some; they certainly are durable, and effective in conserving moisture, but troublesome weeds grow between the stones. In the rock garden stone chips can be used and are recommended. II MULCHES FOR LOOKS How to select them for aesthetic appeal as well as practical value Helen S. Hull THE question in gardening today is no longer whether to mulch, but with what material, what procedure, and for what special purpose. Choice of mulches for the home garden may involve consid- erations that do not obtain for the exper- iment station, the commercial flower- growing area, the vegetable farm or even for public parks or botanic gardens. For the home garden the mulch must satisfy not only the basic requirements, but it also should be pleasing to the eye, en- hancing the garden’s appearance. Fur- thermore, the mulch should be consistent with the character of the planting. Those who wish to surround their flow- ers with ground-up corncobs, or matted peat moss looking like a blanket of old felt, or tar paper, or aluminum foil, or strips of black plastic, or sawdust or wood shavings are, of course, free to do so. These materials all accomplish the purposes of a good mulch; they will be satisfactory economically and horticul- turally. They will save weeding and keep the gi’ound moist; the flowers will be gorgeous. But the garden will be ngly. The home gardener on the other hand considers over-all garden beauty as an inseparable concept. Beauty in the home garden requires good and suitable vari- eties of plants well grown and well ar- ranged in a pleasing setting and with further regard for garden housekeeping. Mulches must be selected as factors in the aesthetic enjoyment of the garden as a whole. Use More Than One Mulch Tt is inevitable that one kind of mulch won’t do everywhere. It would be mo- notonous, and for various types of plant- ings it would be either unsuitable or in- compatible. In my own garden there are more than a dozen different kinds of mulches, in- cluding buckwheat hulls, leafmold, com- post, pine needles, sand, stone chips, ] grass clippings, hay and, in winter, oak leaves and strawy manure. I also use ' what I call “living mulches” — ground- hugging plants like thyme ( Thymus vul- garis), myrtle ( Vinca minor), pachvsan- dra ( Pachysandra terminalis and P. pro- cmnbens) and Johnny-jump-up (Viala tricolor) . Buckwheat hulls seem right for the for- mal rose garden in summer and for some perennials, although in winter strawy manure goes between my rose bushes and on the vegetable garden. In spring the i strawy manure covering the vegetable patch is plowed under and in June grass and hay are spread around the tomatoes, between the rows of beans and other veg- etables and under the strawberries. Nothing seems so logical a summer mulch for the wildflower garden as leaf- mold. It is applied after the winter mulch of fallen leaves from the trees • above has been removed. Plants growing under pine trees are mulched the year around with fallen needles. Sand and small stone chips are used for some rock plants in the sun and for native cactus. The ground covers, myrtle and pachy- sandra, are planted around broad-leaved evergreens and over daffodils. Common thyme keeps the weeds out of a planting of iris and day-lilies. Johnny-jump-up is a pretty cover for a nursery bed not in use. This low plant flowers and seeds all during the growing , season ; a few plants soon make a dense j 12 cover. When the space is needed for other plants, the Johnny-jump-ups are pulled up and tossed on the compost heap, a ; poor reward for discouraging weeds and keeping the soil moist. Buckwheat Hulls for Roses Because of their soft brown color and i pleasing texture, buckwheat hulls enhance the neatness and beauty of the rose beds. My experience with this material dates back to 1940, when a firm sent me a 50- j pound bag as a sample. Over the years I have become convinced of its many vir- I tues as a mulch, in addition to its being | light and easy for a woman to handle. 1 Buckwheat hulls can be thrown on with I a scoop, leveled with a rake and removed | with a hoe. i In spite of their lightness, they do not | blow in the wind. They do not readily ab- sorb water, but they do let water through I and prevent its evaporation. Covered | with a lVa-inch layer of buckwheat hulls, my garden needs a good soaking only I every ten days or two weeks, even in mid- I summer drought. The moisture in the soil can be checked easily by simply pushing aside the mulch and looking. When water I is applied at ground level with a garden i gadget such as a wand or similar hose attachment, the mulch lifts sufficiently to allow the spread of water over the bed, vet lessens runoff. Keeping moisture constantly available is one of the secrets of producing fine roses, but using water Compact, low-growing plants such as thyme can be used as a living mulch. wisely is a comfort where water is scarce or expensive. It is my practice to remove the hulls in the fall, dry them in the sun and store them in bags over the winter for use again in the spring. Occasionally, when the season overtakes ns, the hulls are left i Johnny-jump-up (Vi- I ola tricolor) is a col- orful living mulch. Roche photos 13 Buckwheat hulls have neat appear- ance and good gen- eral mulching prop- erties, making them ideal for show beds. on; then, after soil or compost lias been heaped around each bush to a height of about 10 inches, the usual winter mulch of strawy manure is put on top. The fol- lowing spring the hulls are removed with the manure and added to the compost heap. Fresh buckwheat hulls are spread on the rose beds in April after a light cultivation and an application of 5-10-10 fertilizer. Subsequent fertilizer is ap- plied in liquid form — a foliar spray plus one midsummer “drink” applied by draw- ing a 10-inch circle in the mulch around each rose bush and pouring the liquid directly on the soil. One plantsman has offered the opinion that my practice of removing the old mulch in fall or sirring and then replacing at least a top layer of fresh hulls each year, is responsible for the dearth of soil- borne diseases on my roses. This opinion is in the nature of an educated guess. Other factors, such as a iveekly spray program or seasonal conditions, might I also contribute to the good results. It is] true, however, that after watering the 1 roses or after a rain, the top layer of the buckwheat hull mulch dries quickly; this I might discourage diseases which thrive in ! dampness. Buckwheat hulls are slow to deterio- rate, taking two or more years to decom- 1 pose. This is an advantage in cases w’here j the mulch is not to be dug under. Al- i 14 Though small and light, buck- wheat hulls do not blow about badly in any ex- cept the most violent winds. I Roche photos though buckwheat hulls are organic and will eventually combine with the soil, at first, when mixed with soil, they will act about like cinders. Therefore, if the soil structure is already satisfactory, it is bet- ter to remove them than to dig them in. | Buckwheat hulls would not be a desirable mulch in the vegetable garden. There it is easier to mulch with a material which can be dug in, one which will quickly decay, such as manure or grass clippings. In the perennial border buckwheat hulls are neat and compatible. But if annuals are added, it is better to shade the soil by planting the annuals close to- gether than to rely on buckwheat hulls, for they may make conditions too damp for soft-stemmed annuals such as petunias. Buckwheat Hulls for Tuberous Begonias Buckwheat hulls are especially useful as a mulch where tuberous begonias are planted directly in the soil rather than in pots. One bed on the south side of my rectangular rose garden is under two apple trees which are cherished for their fragrant pink blossoms in April. This bed is too shady for roses, but by trim- ming the branches of the apple trees high, the light and cool breezes are favor- able for tuberous begonias planted under- neath. These tender, naturally cool- weather plants are heavy feeders and for 15 I I ! i Tuberous begonias flourish in moist cool soil. Buckwheat hull mulch helps maintain these conditions and keeps low-hanging blossoms clean. good bloom, growth must not be cheeked. The soil should be cool and moist to make nutrients constantly available but not soggy, as this will encourage rotting of stems and tubers. In the climate of northern New Jersey buckwheat hulls have proved ideal for keeping soil temperature and moisture favorable for tuberous begonias, and to protect the roots which grow from the tops as well as the bottoms of the tubers. Besides these horticultural advantages, buckwheat hulls improve the neat appear- ance of the bed. Perhaps best of all, the hulls are clean and on days of rain blos- soms will not be ruined by spattered mud. Leaves and Leafmold for Wildflowers Whereas buckwheat hulls just suit the looks of the rose beds, they strike a false note in the wildflower garden. Here nothing seems quite right but leaves from) the trees above. Oak leaves fall to cover the wildflower garden in winter. In spring they are removed and replaced with an inch-deep layer of leafmold made from leaves of former years. The leaf- mold is inexpensive and neat and allows even the smallest flowers such as trailing arbutus, Dutchmans - breeches, liepatica and partridge-berry to be seen and en- joyed. In midsummer another 1-inch layer of leafmold is added, and if the season is dry still another layer is added where needed. Where any work necessary to good cub; ture can be reduced or eliminated by the | use of mulches judiciously applied and; chosen with respect for their appropri-| ateness and their looks, a gardener’s time can be freed for other activities — more areas can be managed for a garden and , more kinds of plants can be well grown and enjoyed. 16 MULCHES AND PLANT DISEASE Mulches inhibit some diseases, encourage others and act in both capacities for some Cynthia Westcott A primary advantage of any mulch that is reasonably fine-textured (without the large air spaces of a material such as tobacco stems) is that it provides a mechanical barrier between old infected leaves on the ground and the growing- leaves above. And if the mulch is applied j early enough and is combined with an I adequate spraying program the plants | may remain disease-free all season. In I such a case the mulch may stay in place ' from year to year, added to as necessary. I But if disease develops despite protective I measures, and spotted leaves drop down I on top of or into the mulch, then it should be removed at the end of the season and j replaced with fresh the next year, a proc- ess that may be both arduous and ex- i pensive. A second advantage of a mulch is that it breaks the force of falling rain or water from the hose, preventing much of the splashing that spreads fungus spores or other infective materials. And, of course, the mulch helps to hold this mois- ture in the soil and so aids in the survival of those plants which may have lost some of their root systems to disease. Rose Blackspot Rose blackspot is a disease that can often be reduced in extent by the use of a proper mulch. I usually mulch my rose garden in New Jersey before May 1st with buckwheat hulls (sold under the trade name, Mul-tex), applied 1 inch deep. The hulls are sold in 50-pound bags, one bag covering about 60 square feet, or perhaps a bit more, at the recom- mended depth. I tried cocoa bean shells (Cocoloam) this past summer. They seemed to be equally effective and attractive and the chocolate odor disappeared after the first week. However, the 50-pound bag did not spread quite so far. Ground corncobs are effective but more conspicuous. These three materials let rain penetrate quickly to the soil below and prevent splashing. Peat moss, on the other hand, takes up a lot of the moisture for itself and, if allowed to dry out too much, cakes on top so that rain falling on it spatters almost as much as when it hits hard soil. The summer spores of blackspot fungus are never spread by wind alone. In hur- ricanes they may be carried several feet by wind-driven rain, but normally they are disseminated only as far as they can be splashed, either from ground to over- head leaves, from one bush to the next, or from cane to leaf. Here in the North- east the fungus lives over winter in in- conspicuous spots on canes as well as in old leaves on the ground. A mulch, therefore, is only one part of blackspot prevention. A dormant spray of 1 to 9 liquid lime-sulfur applied right after spring pruning, plus weekly spray- ing with a fungicide during the growing season should accompany a mulch. With this three-part prevention program I have completely eliminated blackspot from a garden having a high percentage of in- fection. But without a mulch I have never quite succeeded in eliminating all blackspot from a severely infected garden. A very loose mulch, such as unchopped tobacco stems, will catch and hold a lot of infected leaves. Unless it is removed and burned at the end of the season it may cause more trouble than would bare ground, where old leaves can be readily raked up. Mulching chrysanthemums usually helps in the fight against leaf nematodes, which 17 Applying buckwheat hull mulch to rose becl. A fine-textured material such as buckwheat hulls is best where disease is a problem, as it does not conceal fallen bits of diseased plant material which can spread infection. swim up the stems in wet weather, caus- ing blighting of the foliage from the ground up. Mulching may also help box- wood which has lost some of its roots to the meadow nematode and must conserve every bit of moisture to survive. Disadvantages On the debit side a mulch may be harm- ful in that it may retain too much mois- ture and so encourage growth of fungi or bacteria. Several times I have investi- gated rhododendrons with dying branches, expecting to find borers at work, only to find that the trunks were rotting at the base because too many wet leaves had been piled against them. Oak leaves, be- cause they do not mat together so much, are a better mulch material than leaves of most trees. Many rose cankers are fostered by hilling the bushes for winter with leaves, manure, peat moss or even buckwheat hulls. A friable soil is the only safe winter mulch for roses. How- ever, in the New York City area a winter mulch is usually unnecessary. The sum-1 mer mulch can be left in place over win-' ter unless it is full of diseased material, but it should never be mounded up around the canes. The fungus fruiting bodies that start the new cycle of rose blackspot and other leafspots are formed in the leaf itself. When the leaf finally disintegrates, the fungus does not live free in the soil. There) is another type of fungus that survives after the infected petal, leaf, or stem rots into the soil. It lives on, for one or several years, in the form of a hard rest- ing body, called a selerotium. In spring, in the presence of sufficient moisture, one or more little stems grow out of this selerotium, each expanding at the top into a cup, called an apotheeium. This is lined with sacs, each containing eight spores. When there is a change in humid- ity, the spores are literally shot into the air and carried by air currents to suscep- tible plant parts overhead. A mulch helps' to provide the moisture necessary for the Tobacco stems are a good mulch for plants and their nicotine content checks cer tain insects. For roses they are less desir able because their coarse texture permits diseased leaves and stems to fall into the mulch, beyond the reach of fungicide spray. McFarland 18 formation of these apothecia. If the mulch is very thick the little stems may not be able to penetrate it, but if it is uneven the fungus .just puts out longer sterns in the thin places and fruits at the surface of the mulch. Flower Blights The azalea and camellia flower blights, now so important in gardens from Vir- ginia southward and a potential menace to northern greenhouses, are caused by the type of fungus just described. During the early studies of azalea petal blight all sorts of mulches, including sugar cane, pulp, alfalfa meal, pine needles and as- phalt paper, were tested. All inhibited the development of apothecia to some extent; but none delayed the appearance of blight more than a day or two, for the azalea fungus produces another type of spore in the petals and these are soon spread long distances by insects. A single, unmulched plant in an entire town is sufficient to cause a tremendous amount of secondary infection; hence, spraying the flowers often enough to keep all opening petals protected with fungicide has proved Author photo These mushroom-like bodies (apothecia) of camellia flower blight produce millions of spores which spread the disease. to be the only practical method of control. The camellia flower blight, which is becoming a very big threat in all the South, has no secondary spore stage; theoretically it might be possible to con- trol it with mulches. However, the scle- rotia are very large and can live in the soil and produce apothecia for at least three years. Also they produce stems long enough to poke through any mulch except an impervious one such as asphalt paper. So, in this case also, mulch en- courages disease by helping to provide the moisture necessary for development of apothecia. I have collected a thousand apothecia from the leaf litter under a single camellia bush. Each one shot off so many spores that, in mass, they looked like thick clouds of cigarette smoke (individual spores are not visible to the naked eye). Camellias bloom for such a long period that it has not yet seemed practical to try to control the blight by spraying the flowers. Some cities have taken such drastic measures as removing all flower buds from the camellia plants on all in- fected properties for at least two years. Other cities are requiring the weekly re- moval of all fallen blossoms and are treating the ground chemically to inhibit the development of apothecia. With a mulch of loose litter or a “living mulch” of ivy or other ground cover it is prac- tically impossible to find and collect the thousands of fallen flowers. It is equally hard to get thorough distribution of the chemical. I have followed along after a spraying machine, getting down on my knees to look under the mulch. In many cases the fungicide has merely rolled off the top of the mulch, leaving large areas of the soil surface underneath unpro- tected. If it has seemed wise to point out one or two drawbacks of mulches it is by no means my intention to discourage their use in most instances. I think I’d stop gardening if I had to do without a sum- mer mulch, for in my garden it eliminates 90 per cent of the weeding and more than half of the watering. 19 MULCHES AND THE SOIL PATTERN Joseph A. Cocannouer NO matter what type of gardening one may be doing', there is a place for a vegetable mulch. It cannot be overempha- sized that in dealing with the soil the aim should always be to build and maintain nature’s complete soil pattern in so far as it is possible. This really demands a surface mulch. Nature has a definite soil pattern and if there is no interference with the natural scheme of things, this pattern holds wherever vegetation is produced : a soil mass consisting of two zones, commonly known as the surface soil or topsoil and the subsoil, and on top of these, a vegetable mulch or organic covering. Together these divisions make up the soil “world” — a world teeming with living things, whose combined ac- tivity enables the soil to maintain the growth of plants. This is the situation where nature operates without serious interference. It is an unfortunate fact that the soil is not always able to operate at maximum efficiency, even in regions unmolested by man. Fire and water are two of the natural agencies which can interfere with constructive activities in the soil. Few people understand what an enor- mous part an efficient mulch plays in nature’s scheme, where the natural mulch is indispensable. The fact that a mulch is not found under all plants does not affect the fundamental truth. The organic litter on the forest floor, for example, is the storehouse from which the topsoil obtains many of its growth- supporting ingredients. The dead re- mains of once living things gradually decompose, returning to the earth to be used again in the continuous sustenance • of life. Aside from this basic cycle the mulch has other important attributes, j discussed in accompanying articles. In nature there is no soil tillage, no soil disturbance, save for what is done < by the earthworms, insects, and plant roots. But man, in producing crops, I must do considerable stirring of the soil. Necessity requires that he make some i changes in nature’s pattern. This he can do constructively. For one thing, he should hold his tillage to the absolute minimum essential for preparing a seed- bed and for adding the vital organic materials to the lower soil. In short, a I deep, rich surface mulch should be main- , tained without much digging below it. The very best mulch a gardener can use is one closely resembling that which nature provides: dry weed stalks, twigs and other organic debris, broken up and mixed with dead leaves. This natural mulch can be improved through the addi- tion of compost or well-rotted barnyard manure. Such a mulch applied around i shrubs, orchard crops and vegetables, and maintained continuously will produce ] both quantity and quality of crops not I possible where the mulch is omitted. The I mulch must not be applied for a while and then removed or turned completely i under. It must be left in place and con- | stantly added to. As it decays its nu- i trients will leach into the soil. No matter what type of vegetable mulch one may employ — and many kinds are satisfactory — one should maintain the mulch continuously. This is the way ! nature does it. 20 I I A ► mulch 7 ► topsoil 'k - subsoil I I I Relationship between mulch and topsoil. Topsoil is, in a sense, constantly being “used up. Its minerals are being absorbed by roots of plants and its organic material (the dead remains of plants and parts of plants) is in a state of continuing' decay. If the topsoil is to retain its quality, these constituents must be constantly supplied anew. Mulching is one means of doing this. 21 MULCHES FOR SEASIDE GARDENS They may spell the difference between success and failure Frederick F. and Esther Rockwell MULCHING plays an important part in gardening in almost any climate and under all sorts of conditions. At or near the seashore, where temperatures are likely to be considerably above those inland, and where alternate freezing and thawing occurs more frequently, winter mulches are doubly important. More- over, the predominance of light sandy soils, which dry out quickly, and frequent periods of summer drought add to the necessity for summer mulches. Under such conditions the use of mulches during both winter and summer plays a large part in successful garden- ing; in fact, with many plants it may mean the difference between success and failure. While our own experience in this respect has been mostly in Cape May, New Jersey, and on Cape Cod, observation leads us to believe that the same holds true along almost any coast- line and even on the shores of large inland bodies of water. However, many of the latter are surrounded by soils that are heavier and retain moisture better. Summer Mulching The first rule for summer mulching of seaside gardens is mulch everything. At least we have found that all our plants have been helped by a mulch, although many of the native or “escaped” flowers, such as lupine, columbine, dianthus and broom, will do without .any but that pro- vided by nature. Many native plants such as arbutus — of which we are so fortunate as to possess a couple of acres — and bearberry ( Arctostaphylos uva- ursi) either grow where trees provide a natural mulch or, as in the case of bear- berry, the plants provide their own mulch. In our flower and vegetable gardens wc begin mulching as soon as plants are well established. After pulling all weeds by In rigorous seaside cli j mates mulches are almost! a necessity. The tomatoes in this Cape Cod garden! are mulched with salti hay. 22 the roots, we cultivate the soil surface thoroughly, using a scuffle hoe between the rows and a triangular, all-purpose hoe between the plants in the rows. Next we apply the mulch, being care- ful to cover the soil surface to a depth ! of several inches and to bring the material I right up close to the plant stems. An open, well-aerated mulching material may I be applied in larger quantities than those that are more dense, such as peat moss. Whether or not the mulch has to be added to as the season advances also depends on the material used. Summer mulching first of all conserves | moisture — one of the greatest needs in sandy-soil gardening. Near the sea we have found that we can grow practically | anything if we supply plenty of humus, plant food and water. Of these three | “musts,” sufficient water is the most dif- ficult to provide, especially during the j long dry spells of July and August. When sudden, heavy storms give us several inches of rain in a very short 1 time, as so often happens at the seashore, 1 a mulch prevents surface runoff and en- ables the soil to absorb the water gradu- j ally. But the same precipitation causes ' a leaching of plant nutrients from sandy j soils. We therefore make small, frequent applications of plant foods rather than the two or three feedings which are com- monly applied to heavier loams. Then, too, a mulch keeps the surface soil from hardening and packing. In dry weather the surface of clay-bearing sandy soils may become almost as hard as ce- ment, making it difficult for plants to grow. Under a mulch the ground stays moist and friable. The third advantage of summer mulch- ing is that it practically eliminates weeds. The few seedlings which do get a start are tall, spindling and easily pulled out by the roots. Materials for a Summer Mulch There are many summer mulches avail- able, some of them free for the gathering. We have used the following successfully: Green rye straw we gather from our own winter rye cover crop. We permit it- to grow 12 to 18 inches high, mow it and use it for mulching, and then dig under the roots and stubble. We mulched our potatoes, tomatoes and vine crops with this material last year. Pine needles and dry leaves, especially oak, are everywhere around us, and form the natural mulch which protects acid- loving natives such as arbutus and bear- berry. We use these to mulch azaleas, evergreens and even the rose beds. Four useful mulching ma- terials— oak leaves, pine needles, excelsior and peat moss. Author photos WrH, i r %, m 23 Gantner If appearance is not of prime importance, cornstalks can be a useful winter mulch. Marsh grass or hay, which can be gathered readily, is ideal for mulching strawberries, iris and other perennials, as well as vegetable rows. Grass clippings can be saved and mixed with dried leaves or rough compost (the large pieces screened from the heap). For the large vegetable garden we also utilize cornstalks, cutting them as soon as the last ears are harvested and laying them lengthwise between the rows. For our show beds, which we want to look neat and attractive, we still prefer buckwheat hulls or pulverized native peat, which is usually available some- where on the Cape. Massive deposits are often uncovered during excavations. For example, a large shop that is being built near us had to dispose of hundreds of tons of peat before it could put in its foundations. Though not as good as imported peat moss, this material is much cheaper and perfectly usable as a mulch. Winter Mulching- Winter mulches are especially valu- able near the seashore, where tempera- tures change so rapidly. Also, high winds are frequently encountered, so that win- ter mulching becomes a real necessity. It is well to delay the application ot a winter mulch until after the first hard! freeze. If this procedure is followed there is less likelihood of alternate freez- ing and thawing around plant roots, the main cause of heaving and consequent winter injury. We have not found it necessary tc protect the tops of roses and low-grow-l ing perennials, as winter winds are laden with moisture and stems do not dry outj (except in winds of hurricane velocity).! Evergreen shrubs and small, recently planted evergreen trees, on the other hand, need the protection of burlap or! straw to prevent wind breakage. Plants! Winter protection is in a sense a form of mulching — mulching carried into the air. Here dis- carded Christmas trees bundled around climbing roses provide winter protection (trees removed from front to show rose bush). To prevent heavy snow from breaking light branches as well as to shield it from winter burn, newly planted shrub is pro- tected bv old Christmas trees. i Author photos 25 Gantner Cut spruce or pine branches are a good winter mulch in them- selves, or can be used to hold lighter mulches in place. in the path of salt spray should also be covered. Near the sea, where spring may come later and be colder than in adjacent in- land areas, it is desirable to keep the winter mulches on as late as possible to prevent too-early top growth which may be touched by late frosts. Materials for a Winter Mulch There are many excellent materials near the sea that are suitable for winter mulches. Old Cape houses and also the flower beds surrounding them are banked around the foundations with eel grass, an underwater herb with long linear foliage. This material can also be gathered along the salt creeks and bay shores. It and kelp, gathered from the beaches, not only make excellent, non- packing mulches but also supply valuable humus and nutrients when dug into the soil in spring. On the Aran Islands off Ireland, potatoes are grown in kelp dragged up from the sea and deposited in the depressions of the rocky ledges which form the islands. Salt hay, marsh hay, beach grasses and rushes are other materials which can be had for the gathering. Here on Cape Cod cranberry cuttings, removed from the bogs in autumn, are widely used for mulching. These pretty clippings form a decorative cover which really improves the appearance of beds and borders. Pine needles, dry leaves and pine ! boughs are also plentiful. Boughs may 1 be laid over a mulch of needles and leaves to hold them in place and to keep snow and ice from settling about the roots. We find this treatment ideal for < roses. 26 MULCHING PRACTICES AT THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM Donald Wyman IT lias often been said that the use of any kind of a mulch on Massachusetts soils is better than no mulch at all, and the Arnold Arboretum grounds have been operated on that principle for many years. There are several factors that | govern (he kind of mulch we obtain. Although we might prefer to mulch with certain types of materials, budgetary restrictions require that the cost of the mulch be kept to a minimum. The appearance of a mulch is an im- portant consideration, and nothing should he used that might be objection- able from this standpoint. Although we I experience little vandalism here, time has demonstrated that materials like mulching paper, aluminum foil, poly- ethylene film, and similar materials would be disrupted if placed out in large amounts on the grounds. Moreover, no mulching material should be so dry and light that it is easily blown out of place by wind. Fire Hazards with Mulches Fire is the greatest hazard in using some mulching materials. We cannot use materials that are easily ignited by ciga- rette stubs or youngsters playing with matches; nor do we use any which would burn readily if ignited by grass fires that might creep up to them. Years ago, one of the valuable dwarf conifer beds was mulched with peat moss. The season had been very dry; the peat was dry. On a windy July day Nelson Wood chips are a com- paratively new and satisfactory mulching material. 27 Courtesy Arnold Arboretum A mulch of spent hops at the base of this tree stopped the spread of a grass fire. Many other mulches catch fire quickly, so care must be exercised to see that they are not placed where passers-by carelessly throw their cigarettes. a grass fire was started by a horseback rider who had thrown away his lighted cigarette carelessly, and within minutes the peat moss started to burn. Since the evergreen branches touched the peat, only a small flame was necessary to ignite the branches. As a result of this one fire, burning a short 20 minutes before the fire apparatus came, nearly $12,000 damage was done to these plants, some of which were irreplaceable old specimens. The firemen left that after- noon with the fire out, presumably, but the next morning the peat moss was smouldering in many different places. This was proof to us that peat moss was not a good mulching material under our conditions. \"Within the last three years, we have been using three kinds of mulches indis- criminately on all plantings on the grounds in the Arnold Arboretum, in ad- dition to generous amounts of sifted, de- cayed leaf mold which we are fortunate in having available here. Sawdust and Wood Chips Sawdust mulch was used experimentally 1 on the cotoneaster collection a few years ■ ago after first fertilizing the plants heavily. The results were good, but we had to buy this material, and since the other materials were obtained without cost, no more sawdust has been used for general mulching purposes, although we do use it occasionally in mulching ever- greens and ericaceous materials in the nursery. Wood chips have, of course, proved successful. After one of the recent hurri- canes, a group interested in the Arbor- etum presented a brush chipper which can be attached to our Ford tractors. In- stead of hauling brush to be burned, now ! we find it cheaper labor-wise, as well as I being better for the plants, to chip the 1 brush on the spot and blow it around the base of the trees or shrubs which are nearest the pile. Unfortunately, this is more of a disposal program than a mulch- ing program, so that the chips are blown 28 Courtesy Arnold Arboretum If readily obtainable, cocoa bean bulls mixed with sawdust (1 to 3) are a splendid mulch. Note that the mulch is kept away from the tree trunks for rodent control. I on the plants nearest the pile where the brush happens to be. Elm wood is not I chipped but hauled away and burned at once, as a precaution against Dutch elm disease. Spent Hops Spent hops have proved quite success- ful. In the winter 1950 issue of Plants & Gardens a note on this was published. IV e have been fortunate in being com- paratively near two breweries which wanted to dispose of their spent hops. I They could be obtained merely for the I hauling at regular intervals. These hops j had the following analysis : Water 87.67% Nitrogen .40% Organic matter 11.49% Ash .49% pH 4.S This material has been used now for over ten years. There are several draw- backs to it. In the first place, it is obvious that as obtained from the brewery, it has an extremely high water content. (For every 238 pounds of dry material, we were hauling 1,740 pounds of water.) It also has an objectionable odor, which is noticeable on a warm day but disap- pears in about two weeks. Thirdly, we have noticed that it attracts pigeons and rodents. The merits of spent hops far outweigh its disadvantages as a mulch as we use it. It costs us nothing but the labor of hauling. It is wet when first applied, hence does not blow away on a windy day. And, what is most important, even when dry (after weeks of drought), these hops will not burn appreciably. Time and again it has been noticed that plants mulched with spent hops have not been injured from surrounding grass fires. The fire has burned up to the edge of the mulch and stopped. Because of this, we 29 have actually used this material in mulch- ing as a fire preventive. Although slightly more acid than our soil, the spent-hops mulch has been ap- plied to practically all the kinds of trees and shrubs in the Arboretum except a dozen of the outstanding lime-requiring plants. We have seen no ill effects from its use except when applied on days pre- ceding high temperatures, and when the hops are heaped around the base of a small tree trunk or a shrub with numerous stems. When this occurs and the tempera- tures are high, the material does heat noticeably and can kill stems several inches in diameter. Hence, the only pre- caution to he taken in applying this ma- terial is to keep it a foot or so away from the basal stems of trees and shrubs. The spent-hops mulch is applied 4 to 6 inches thick and lasts about two years before disintegrating appreciably. Quack- grass and other weeds will eventually grow through it. This mulch is ideal for conserving soil water and has necessarily been applied at all seasons of the year. Cocoa Shells A cocoa-shell mulch is the third mulch- ing material, and we have been experi- menting with this for the past year. This, too, has come as a result of economic pressures of various sorts. The breweries have discontinued, hence no more spent hops are available within reasonable haul- ing distance. Two manufacturers of cocoa products have had their sales for the cocoa shells stopped suddenly for various reasons, and since the Arnold Arboretum is willing to haul them away, they are given to us intermittently for mulching purposes. Cocoa shells as a mulch may have draw- backs which are not as yet fully known to us. They do have a chocolate odor, when first applied. When fully saturated with water, they will heat up on a warm day and because of this, precautions are taken to keep them a foot or so from the trunk or basal branches of the plants. A mold grows through them quickly in warm weather, but as far as we can determine, this is not harmful to the plants. Finall; after serving several weeks as a mulch an after having taken up water, they ai disagreeable to walk on, being ver slimy, and later the surface may tend t cake. (See page 34.) This might b one of the reasons the home gardene would not desire this material about h: plants. Like spent hops, a cocoa-shell mule (to us, at least) has its good points. W obtain this material merely for the hau ing. As the cocoa shells come from th factory, they are extremely light and dr and so, very easily applied. In ever ton of cocoa shells there are only 2 I pounds or less of water. Even more in portant, there are 54 pounds of nitroge l and 1,878 pounds of organic mattei i Hence, cocoa shells can be considered nr only as a mulch but as a fertilizer as wel since some commonly-sold fertilizers cor tain less nitrogen. The cocoa-shell mulch is being applie indiscriminately to all the many planting in the Arboretum. The pH is 5.5, abor the same as the soil; phosphorus conter is 1.1 per cent, and potash, 3.7 per een As a mulch, the cocoa shells are applie about 3 to 4 inches thick. Weeds do hav a habit of eventually growing through however, these weeds can be remove easily if prompt attention is given th eradication program as soon as they aj pear.

The gardens are open free of charge to the public every day of the year. More than 300,000 visitors come to Longwood each year. Because of their light weight and fine texture, buckwheat hulls are an ideal mulch for small plants such as pansies. Hampfler , Longwood 31 to produce roots would heave from the soil. Their roots would be exposed to the drying winds and extremes of cold which are fatal to most plants. Longwood’s perennial borders are en- tirely covered with a 4-inch mulch of either strawy stable manure or mushroom manure in the early part of December. This mulch helps prevent the perennials, biennials and bulbs from heaving out of the ground. It also adds organic matter to the soil as it decays. In early spring the bulky and strawy materials that are left are removed and saved for a summer mulch, as described below. Our pansy beds, composed of plants grown from seed and planted in outside gardens during September, are also mulched. After the first freeze a light covering of buckwheat hulls % to % inch deep is applied to the whole bed. Should some of the pansy foliage be- come covered with the buckwheat hul during application, a light sprinklin with the garden hose will wash thei free, or this may be left for the firs light rain. We favor buckwheat hulls o pansy beds because they are very ligh small and fluffy. They can be handlej very easily and work in around the has of the plant well; they also give a nes and clean appearance. This mulch i left on the bed until the plants are take away in the spring. By this time whaj little material is left is worked into till the soil. English ivy, when grown as a groun cover at Longwood, is given a wintel cover of evergreen branches during th month of December. Enough cover i applied to just hide the ivy. This materia is removed when the gardens are eleanci up in the spring. The purpose of thij 32 'mulch is to keep the ivy leaves from ! turning' brown. After the first frost in the late fall the beds of Ere mums are covered completely with 8 to 10 inches of bald-cypress (Taro- ilium) needles. This material is readily I available from specimen trees growing 'in the Gardens; cypress does well in our i climate, and even further north. After a snowstorm or a few rains, the cypress ' needle mulch packs down to a depth of 'about 6 inches. It is removed in mid- March and saved for a summer mulch. We prefer the cypress needle mulch to I straw, other leaves, etc., because it is I light and fluffy, besides being readily available here. Peat moss and white pine needles are i preferred at Longwood for ericaceous plantings including azaleas and rhododen- j (Irons. The peat is used 1 to 2 inches I deep over the planting area during the spring, summer and fall. It not only j acts as a mulch but adds organic mat- ter to the soil. During December a 4- inch mulch of white pine needles applied I over the peat serves to give extra pro- tection during the winter months. We I also use white pine needles around any I shrub or tree plantings. Studies show that they will not absorb moisture from the ground, but will allow the rains to pass through. Pine needles are easy to handle, good in appearance, and after decomposition increase the acidity of the soil. On some plantings of azaleas and rhododendrons wood chips are used when available. When using either wood chips or sawdust it must be remembered that they usually cause a nitrogen deficiency, which may be corrected by adding nitro- gen to the soil in either fall or spring (see page 52). Summer Mulches Summer mulches are used at Long- wood to cover surface-feeding roots, to keep the soil cool, to conserve water, to control weeds, and to add organic mat- ter to the soil. In mulching boxwood hedges (and other plants) a 4-inch mulch of either mushroom manure (readily obtainable in our locality) or white pine needles around the base of the plants has been successful. This material is allowed to remain around the plants and is added to as needed. In garden areas where annuals, peren- nials, and biennials are grown in rows for display purposes or for cut flowers, we mulch 3 to 4 inches deep with ma- terial left over from the winter mulch (or any strawy material). In some cases the white pine needle mulch mentioned above has proven satisfactory. For newly transplanted trees and shrubs a 4-inch mulch of mushroom ma- nure, white pine needles, wood chips, or any of the strawy materials, applied soon after transplanting has proven ex- tremely beneficial. Such a mulch is per- mitted to remain until the plant is established. To prevent winter heaving of newly trans- planted shrubs, Longwood practice is to use a mulch of oak leaves with a cover of salt hay. Eampfler, Longwood 33 MULCHING PRACTICES AT THE BROOKLYN BOTANIC GARDE> Alys Sutcliffe SEVERAL mulches have been used in different parts of the Garden in the past few years. Cocoa bean hulls (cocoa shells) have been used extensively since 1952, both alone and mixed with sawdust. The lat- ter is the preferred way of using' them (% cocoa bean hulls, % sawdust), apply- ing- a layer 2 to 4 inches deep. The hulls help to color the sawdust and the saw- dust helps to break up the cocoa hulls which when used alone are apt to cake and become moldy. Cocoa hulls supply a small amount of nitrogen. The lilacs and the viburnums, where applications have been liberal, have made consider- able foliage growth and looked much healthier after use of this mulch. The strong smell of chocolate disappears in a week or so after the cocoa hulls are applied. Sawdust has been used for a number of years in the nursery and on the grounds. Most of it has been cedar saw- dust. It is slow to disintegrate and there- fore does not use up nitrogen so quickly that plants are affected. In fact, there has been no trouble on that account ex- cept in the case of Ilex crenata var. conve.ra, which was the only shrub that was noticeably sensitive to any lack of nitrogen. Over the years the soil tex- ture has become much improved. Cedar sawdust is very white and rather glaring for the small garden, but is not objection- able as a mulch for shrubs. A darker brown sawdust of red cedar or redwood is obtainable as a mulch for shrubs. These make better-looking mulches. Peat moss is still a favorite and a goc mulch. It must not be allowed to di out, and should be thoroughly dampeiu before spreading on the garden as it al sorbs a great deal of moisture (see pa^ 64).

In this way no furtlnj watering will be necessary except durinj a very dry summer or on a very sandl soil. Annuals and perennials may ra mulched when well established and aftc their first feeding.

They last a Ion*.' time and water runs through easily. They have been used very effectively on chrys- anthemums but are rather coarse for the average flower bed. At the Botanic Gar den we produce our own chips from tret trimmings with a chipper. Oak leaves, when available, are one of the best mulches for rhododendrons. Other partly rotted leaves may be used as a mulch for shrubs and as a winter mulch for flower beds. Graystone chips and coarse gravel are the best mulch, s for most rock garden plants. They apparently hold the plants down and at the same time prevent water from standing around the crowns of the ground-hugging plants. Chopped oak leaves and peat moss are used for the low-growing rhododendrons and heaths. Mulches are as important in winter as in summer in the rock garden, particularly in regions where there is little snow. Spent hops have been used in the past; when obtainable they make a very satis- factory mulch and are fire resistant too. ( Sec page 29. ) Before putting on any mulch in late spring or early summer, be sure the ground is completely free of weeds and the soil moist. Most mulches should be at least 2 inches thick to be effective in McFarltmd Oak leaves are generally regarded as a good mulch for azaleas and rhododendrons. keeping down weeds and holding the moisture in the ground. As summer season work-savers, mulches are rated very high at the Botanic Garden — in reduction of time that used to be devoted to cultivation, and to watering. Nelson Stone chips are used to mulch alpine plants in rock garden. 35 Author Buth Stout spreads thick mulch of hay on her vegetable garden at Bedding, Conn. I FOR THE BUSY, THE AGING, AND THE LANGUID Permanent mulching can solve many garden problems and take much of the hard work out of gardening Ruth Stout RECENTLY I received a note from a magazine editor who had accepted an article which described iny method of gardening. lie ended with: . . but frankly we expected more information and not quite so much enthusiasm.” I treated this lightly, merely sending him a line saying: “Thank you for buying my enthusiasm.” Shortly after that another editor, upon accepting an article, commented: “I don’t quite see why you think you in- ' vented mulching.” The answer to him went something like this : “I know that mulching is older than | I am, but since my book appeared over a year ago, I have been in touch with two thousand five hundred gardeners. Five hundred of them came to see myi garden, some of them from as far away ; 36 Lang photos No plant material is destroyed in this garden. Here Miss Stout pulls cabbage stalks and adds them to thick mulch already in place on soil. as Florida, Canada, Wisconsin; I have received eight hundred letters; I have talked to more than one thousand five hundred people at garden clubs and I haven’t found one person who had ever heard of practicing' mulching the way I do except those who had read my book or articles about it.” But it was really the first note which deserved some attention. It makes no difference who thought up this easy method; the important thing is to write about it in such a way that anyone can see the advantages of it. So I will now try to explain exactly what it is. Making the Mulch Let us say it’s autumn ; you have flower beds and a vegetable plot which you have always cultivated in the time-honored fashion, but you now want to adopt an easier way. The first mistake to avoid is that of cleaning up the garden. Leave everything where it is — all annual and perennial dead tops in the flower beds, and in the vegetable section leave every cornstalk, every vine, plant, root. Two thousand years ago a Roman said to make manure of litter, beanstalks, etc. Who paid him heed, I wonder? Now dead leaves have fallen all around. Rake these up and spread them over your gardens. If they seem inclined to blow away, don’t let them; toss peony tops, cornstalks, cabbage roots on them. Rain and snow will help you persuade them to stay put. In the meantime, try to create a de- mand for spoiled hay, saivdust or straw by telling your friends and neighbors and 37 Spring planting is not hampered by mulch, which is merely pulled aside. Lang photos Asparagus stalks are left standing at sea- son’s end, to become a part of next year’s mulch. garden club about your project. Here in Connecticut, where I have a garden col- umn in several newspapers, hay for mulching is available and inexpensive. Many people are using it. Spread hay or whatever vegetable mat- ter you can get over your garden, 8 inches deep. Don’t be afraid of weed seeds; if the hay is thick enough, weeds have no chance. Part of the advantage of mulch is that it rots and enriches the soil. Salt hay is all right but it is expensive and rots slowly. Sawdust also rots slowly and so does peat moss, but the latter is said to have little nutrient value. Now your gardens are covered thickly with mulch of one kind or another. I prefer a mixture of hay and leaves and of course all kitchen garbage except meat scraps. You can tuck the garbage under the hay if the sight of it is offensive. Un- less it has been kept in the kitchen too long, it won’t smell. Joseph Wood Krutch, who now lives in Arizona, wrote me : “After reading your book I chose a spot in the garden and put all our garbage there. After two months I found the first earthworms ever seen on this property.” Now spring arrives. All bulbs, peonies, asparagus, will come up through the mulch, although leaves, since they mat down, shouldn’t be left piled on these plants too thickly. If you have peren- nials you’re nervous about, pull back the mulch and have a look. You never turn under the mulch. You never plow or spade either vegetable gar- den or flower beds. When you’re ready to plant anything, just pull the mulch back and put the seeds in. Don’t put the mulch back on top of the newly-planted seeds; as soon as they sprout, pull the mulch up close around them, thus holding in moisture and outwitting weeds. Advantages The advantages of this method are numerous. There is no plowing, spading, 3S hoeing, cultivating, weeding. No com- post pile; your whole garden is your com- post pile. The mulch rots and enriches the soil. Except for cottonseed meal, which supplies nitrogen, I’ve used no fertilizer, not even manure, for twelve years. And the mulch holds in the moisture. A year ago last summer we had sixteen weeks of drought ; my book describing my method came out that August, and visitors flocked to have a look at my garden, to see if the system really worked. • As a matter of fact T was afraid the long drought would be my undoing but instead it proved one of my points; my garden, which hadn’t been watered at all, was thriving while those around us were dry- ing up. It was fun to pull back the mulch and show a skeptic the moist earth and wriggling worms. Some Questions and Answers From the letters I receive and the questions asked at lectures, it is fairly easy to guess what questions may arise in your mind. Here are the answers to a few of them : Q. When do you apply mulch? A. Just as soon as you can get hold of some, and after that, when- ever it gets thin. Q. Aren’t some leaves too sour? A. If you think so, add a little lime. Q. How long does the mulch last? A. That depends on what kind you use. Try to ahvays have some in re- serve so it can be replenished as needed. Q. What is spoiled hay? A. Hay that for some reason is not good enough to feed to livestock. It may have become moldy if moist when it went into the hay mow, but it is just as effective for mulching as good hay. Q. Do the mulched flower beds look awful ? A. They needn’t. I put a rather thin layer of soil on top. Instead of soil you can cover the hay and leaves with peat moss, buckwheat hulls, sugar cane, pine needles; what you use de- pends somewhat on how rich you feel. Any weeds that sprout are anemic and easily demolished for their roots are in the mulch, which is full of air pockets. Q. Is it worthwhile to mulch in city gardens? A. I’ve no hard facts, but think it may be beneficial in the city because it keeps the soot away from the earth. My method takes nine-tenths of the labor out of gardening. I’ve done it suc- cessfully for fourteen years, and I have letters from every state in the Union re- porting splendid results. This coming season Dr. Arthur J. Pratt of Cornell University expects to collaborate with me in demonstrating it; he will make some trips here through the spring and summer to watch results. The University of Con- necticut also plans to look on. These tests will be aimed primarily at finding out what is the best fertilizer to add to the soil to supply nitrogen and to see whether anything besides the rotting mulch is needed for best results. In regard to the method itself Dr. Pratt wrote me : “If good yields can be maintained for ten to fifteen years without plowing or fitting, they probably can lie maintained forever on similar soils.” When, like a leaf, I wither, fall, and die, and St. Peter asks me what I’ve done to deserve to enter Paradise, I will say : “Well, at the moment I can’t think of much of anything. But there’s one thing I have not done : I have never burned a pile of leaves.” I don’t suppose this will get me a pre- ferred seat but I will bet a bale of hay that it will get me through the gate. 39 MULCHING WITH WOOD CHIPS Though concerned with holly, these experiences apply to other plantings as well Kathleen K. Meserve WHEN man fails to provide a cover- ing for the ground, nature, left to her own devices, usually will. The de- cision which gardeners ultimately must make is whether to continually battle the effort of nature to provide a cover of weeds, which can so very quickly take over, or to improvise a covering which will satisfy nature and at the same time answer the particular problem at hand. Under certain conditions it is practical to let nature go ahead and do her job, limiting her only as to the choice of ground cover. There are situations, how- ever, where ground covers are not prac- tical. A holly nursery is one. There are, in our business, two choices. We can either battle the weeds by culti- vating between the hollies, or we can mulch. Cultivating between the hollies can cause damage to the lower branches unless done with great care, and if the job is carefully done, it can cause great damage to the fellow doing it. Further- more, if cultivation is used it must be con- tinued throughout the growing season. We have found mulching to be the answer. Advantages of Mulching This was not a difficult decision to make when all the advantages of mulching were taken into consideration. Mulching not only keeps the weeds down but it improves the texture of the soil, whether the soil is light or heavy; after a few years the rotted material adds humus to the soil. It keeps moisture from evaporating during hot winds and droughts, prevents the soil from washing during heavy down- pours of rain, and holds the precious rain where it is most needed. It modifies the rise and fall of the temperature around the roots and protects them from any disturbance. Last but not least, it gives us a job to do during the winter and it relieves us of the necessity of continually watering and fighting weeds during the growing season when there are always too many things to do anyway. As for the hollies, they like the mulch and re- ward us accordingly. The choice of what material to use for mulch has been equally easy for us to make. We have the Asplundh Tree Ex- pert Company working along our roads. They are engaged by the utility companies to keep the electric and telephone wires free of tree branches. Their orange trucks can be seen in almost every state in the Union, dragging their chopping machines behind them. There are usually three men to a truck and they cut all the dead and dangerous branches off the trees below the wires. These they run through a chipper which in turn blows the chopped material into the back of the truck. When the truck becomes full of this material the men must find a place to dump it. By arrangement with the Company, the men are allowed to charge a small fee for dumping it on private property. The fee is so small that there is no mulch (in- cluding oak leaves free for the gathering) which costs less. Nor do we think there is any mulch which gives more over-all satisfaction. These wood chips come mixed with leaves in the summer and with no leaves in the winter, as one would guess. They vary in coarseness with the number of chopping blades on the particular ma- chine. We put the stringy material on the nursery and save the more refined chips for specimen plants near the house. When we plant even a small holly on 40 Wood chipper converts twigs and branches up to a few inches in diameter into chips which make a highly desirable mulch, coarser than sawdust. Buhle photos Feeding prunings to wood chipper. 41 our lawn, we remove the sod to form a circle about 4 feet in diameter and 4 inches below the level of the grass. After planting the tree in the center, we fill the entire circle with chips to a depth of about 8 inches, always keeping the chips away from the trunk of the ti’ee, — a protection against mice damage. After a month or two of normal rain the mulch usually settles nearly flush with the grass. One of our winter jobs is to enlarge these circles about 6 inches and add to the mulch. In this way the tree is protected from the lawn mower, and much tedious trimming is eliminated. As the tree grows and spreads, we continue to increase the size of the circle, always keeping it at least 6 inches beyond the spread of the branches. To eliminate any chance of the rotting chips robbing the plants of nitro- gen, fertilizer is applied. Never has a nitrogen deficiency showed up which could be blamed on the mulch. We can honestly say that this mulch eliminates most of the chore of weeding. Few weeds will fight their way through. In order to keep an absolutely clean In mulching tree with wood chips, circle 4 inches deep is dug to 6 inches beyond spread of tree. Mulch is applied 8 inches deep, later settles to ground level; it does not touch trunk. As tree grows, circle of mulch is enlarged, to keep it (5 inches beyond spread of branches. nursery, it is weeded twice a year and sometimes during midsummer the mulch is added to slightly. There are three weeds in particular which seem to enjoy the increased moisture under the mulch and fight their way through. Their com- mon names are wild chrysanthemum or mugwort ( Artemisia vulgaris), nut grass ( Cyperus escule>itus) and sour grass ( Bumex acetosella) . When they appear, we try to follow the old proverb of “a stitch in time saves nine” and get after them immediately and thoroughly. Control of Mice For every asset there comes a price to pay. In the case of mulch the price is mice. Mice love mulch. Where the soil beneath is light and sandy as ours is, they move right in. Several years ago, on the property next door, an unkept orchard with all its uncut orchard grass was bulldozed. That orchard had been a haven for mice. Upon the arrival of the bulldozer, the mice came scurrying over to our mulch. We soon began to lose hollies. The pine mice fed on the roots and the field mice girdled the bark. In a state of alarm we sent for Ernest M. Mills of the Department of the Interior, who has charge of rodent control. We learned all about the control of mice from him. Today there is not much dam- age. Every time a hole appears in the ground or in the mulch, we insert a couple of Mo-Go peanuts obtained from 0. E. Linek Co., Inc., Clifton, New Jersey. These peanuts not only attract the mice but also the moles. For safe measure, especial- ly prepared beer cans are placed at stra- tegic points. These contain oats poisoned with strychnine (obtainable from the United States Department of the Interior, 59 Temple Place, Boston 11, Massachu- setts). By removing one end of the beer can and hammering a good dent in one side, the cans can be placed on the ground, opened end slightly down so that rain will not get in, and the few poisoned grains of oats will not fall out. At present the greatest damage the mice seem to be doing is to our reputation — we often for- get to explain the beer cans. 42 BLACK PLASTIC MULCHES ! A novel material to use as a mulch E. M. Emmert M LECHES of all types are valuable aids to growing1 plants. Recently black plastic has been found to have some , special advantages as a mulch. Practically no kinds of weeds are able I to come through black plastic; some large perennial weeds will push it up a bit but they also ultimately die. Ordinary loose j mulches have to be quite deep to stop weeds. Most of these mulches add or- ganic matter to the soil, which the plastic | does not, but it has been found that black ' plastic stops packing and leaching by rain so well that the advantages of or- I ganic matter are in part obtained without adding it. Plastic keeps the soil loose | and in an aerated condition so that favor- able micro-organisms thrive. Plastic Holds Moisture The plastic comes in strips and is tough enough to be walked on with flat-heeled shoes. To let water through, it is neces- sary to punch holes in it at intervals. If they are made correctly the plastic mulch will drain off excess water but retain enough for optimum growth. Be- cause of the reduction in leaching, there is a surprising buildup of available plant food in loose soil covered by the plastic over winter. Plants and seeds can be planted without plowing in early spring before the ground can be worked. Where there is a gentle, even slope, soil will not pack down under the mulch for several years. Plastic lasts at least three to four years, and since the soil stays loose be- neath it, it is not necessary to take up the plastic and plow the soil each year. If soil with proper runoff is fertilized and plowed before covering with plastic, this will not have to be repeated for several years. Where water stands or backs up on soil, however, this will not be true. Plastic mulch holds water better than a thin layer of loose mulch and is almost as effective as a deep layer of loose mulch. It can be laid level, with holes punched Black plastic mulch comes in wide rolls. 43 Kentucky Extension Service Plastic mulch is an- chored at edges with soil ; plants emerge through slits. Holes at bottom of trench allow rain water to soak into soil. at depressions, but in these spots the soil will gradually become packed. A better system is to lay the plastic over furrows, with holes punched at the bot- toms of the furrows. The holes are punched every foot or so, depending upon the slope (more holes are needed on steep slopes). With this system moisture stays in the mulched soil for weeks after ex- posed soil is bone dry. A little packing occurs in the bottoms of the furrows, but the raised soil on each side stays moist and loose and in optimum condition for plant growth. Anchoring Wind will cause trouble if plastic mulch is not well laid. Strips up to 4 feet wide will stay down in the strongest winds if they are well edged with soil and a little soil is placed in the middle of the strips every 3 to 4 feet. Wider strips will require more soil in the center. Heating- In clear weather the soil temperature under black plastic remains from 10° to 15° F. higher overnight than on exposed soil. Even during cold cloudy weather the soil under the plastic remains warmer. This forces plants to make rapid growth. A disadvantage is that this growth may be so early that unprotected tops of plants suffer frost damage. Clear plastic row covers should be used to protect ten- der plants. Another danger attends the use of black plastic mulch. Sometimes in hot sunny weather the heat build-up in the soil may be excessive. This danger is small with large plants which shade the plastic, but freshly planted seeds or small plants may be injured. Planting Planting can be done directly through the plastic, or strips can be laid on each side of the rows to be planted. Large seeds can be readily jobbed through the plastic with a corn jobber. The planting tip of the jobber should be reduced in size and sharpened. Seeds can be planted 44 this way as fast as can he done in bare soil. Plants can be set through slits made in the plastic. The plastic pushes aside easily and springs back in place around the plants. It usually is best not to cut two slits at right angles, but simply to make one slit long enough to allow set- ting the plants. Large seeds usually sprout fast and are above the plastic before small seeds get a start. If the slit is small, beans, vine crops, corn and such large-seeded plants get so far ahead of the few weeds that may start that practically no weeding is necessary. With small-seeded plants, weeds may come in the slits at the same time and be something of a problem. For small seeds of close-set plants such as lettuce, the soil can be worked up in late August or September, making- slight furrows or broad ridges to allow for drainage. The worked soil is covered with plastic and left until early spring. Before winter most of the weed seeds in the top inch of soil will germinate and die. In spring, before unmulched soil is anywhere near ready for working, the plastic can be removed, revealing the soil beneath ready for planting. If soil below the top inch is brought to the surface by stirring, weed seeds in this soil will sprout. But if care is taken not to disturb the soil too much, few weeds will appear because they sprouted and died the previous fall. After the planted seeds are up in rows, the plastic can be put back between the rows. Cost In addition to its other advantages, black plastic mulch is economical because of its longevity. If used on a large scale the 1 Vo-mil-thick grade costs only a little over half a cent per hundred square feet. Laid in rows so it covers about half of the soil, the cost comes to about .$125 per acre. This is only $25 a year, assum- ing the material lasts for five years. The cost of laying it on large areas by ma- chinery comes to only a few dollars an acre. Since much of the usual plowing and cultivating is eliminated, the savings on this will soon pay for the plastic. Plants in garden at left, mulched with plastic, are free of weeds and more vigorous than those in unmulched garden at right. Bakelite 45 PAPER PULP AS MULCH Hozv one nursery uses an unusual material as a mulch James Fanning FOR several years now, paper pulp has been demonstrating its value as a mulch in the Brookside Nurseries, Darien, Connecticut. This mulch not only saves labor by eliminating the need for summer cultivation, but it tits in with the Nurs- eries’ conservation program by making use of scrap paper, sawdust and shavings, and encouraging the activity of earth- worms. Making' the Pulp The main drawback in the paper mulch- ing operation is the necessity of using machinery in making the pulp. The machine used is an Agromat, which con- sists of a steel cylinder with a motor- driven impeller at the bottom. The im- peller, rotating at a high speed, macerates the paper fed into it (with water) by means of a series of teeth spaced around the edge. A typical loading for the 50-gallon Agromat used by Brookside will consist of 7 or 8 pounds of old newspaper, 11 or 12 pounds of sawdust or shavings, and enough water to lill the cylinder without slopping over (about 45 gallons). 46 No toxic effect from the chemicals sup- posedly occurring in newsprint has ever been detected. Highly finished papers, however, have generally been avoided, or used in such small proportions as to be insignificant. Applying the Mulch The “soup,” as it comes out of the Agromat, is spread on the ground by being poured out of coal scuttles, which have been found, by trial and error, to have a lip that is ideally suited to this purpose. It goes on to a depth of about an inch (being fluid, it can’t go much deeper than that) and dries out in two or three days, depending on the weather, to form a layer averaging a quarter of an inch in thickness. The surface of the area to be mulched should be as smooth and free from lumps as it can be made, since irregularities will cause unevenness in the paper layer and result in cracks through which weeds can grow. Once dry, the paper mulch will take a considerable amount of walking on (no spike heels, of course) and should, if properly applied, stand up for an entire growing season. Of course, where the mulch is used around small, tender-stemmed plants it should be kept from actual contact with them, and this can be done by inverting a flower pot over each plant before pour- ing the “soup.” In ten minutes the pulp will have become firm enough to remove the pots. The layer of paper does not form a tight contact with the soil, and in this space earthworms find an ideal place to work. They feed, apparently, on the tiny bits of wood that drop out of the bottom of the layer of paper, and make their castings between paper and soil, thus helping the soil to get its necessary sup- ply of air. Soil temperature under the paper mulch is consistently 10° F. below that of unprotected soil in summer, and the moisture at the surface of the ground is practically constant. Rain or water ap- plied by overhead irrigation soaks im- mediately through the paper, which does not get soft again once the original fluid pulp has solidified. Replacing the Mulch Proof against wind and water erosion, the paper mulch lasts through the whole growing season and does not show any appreciable deterioration until the end of the succeeding winter, at which time it can be tilled into the soil or repaired by patching with fresh “soup.” Plowed un- der, the paper provides the equivalent of ten tons of organic matter to the acre, and this in a relatively solid form that does not have the troublesome bulk of peat, sawdust or untreated shavings. To form a clean edge for the mulching- layer, boards are laid down at the edges of the area to be mulched. These also serve as convenient walkways for the one doing the pouring and they can be moved after the mulch has set for about ten minutes. Incidentally, the greater part of the wate"
