        "text": "I Can't See the Future\n\nTo be honest, I could never completely slog my way through a Hemingway novel, but I've always chuckled at the passage in The Sun Also Rises: “How did you go bankrupt?” Answer: “Two ways, Gradually, then suddenly.” Many nursery companies went under in the past decade, but I wonder how many could have been saved with better leadership. The large nursery next door flopped, the huge nursery where I first worked failed, and even the giant Monrovia Nursery had to bail out by selling their souls to the Lowe's box store. For many it must have seemed like a bad dream where you have an urgent purpose but you are paralyzed and cannot get going. The neighbor kept producing plants on the one end, and then burned crop after crop on the other...until the money ran out. Smoke from smoldering soil laced with fertilizer and pesticides billowed over our valley for a couple of years, and now the new ownership is doing the same thing.\n\nCornus kousa 'Summer Fun'\n\nAt Buchholz Nursery we're content with our modest enterprise and at least we turn a profit. But I question our long-term viability every time we propagate. There is no magic formula about what to produce and how many, and I rely on gut instincts like I always have. How many Cornus kousa 'Summer Fun' should we grow? Well, fortunately we have a market at the one-year graft size, so we'll sell some young plants this summer hopefully. Eventually a row of 30 will go into the field because the trunk calipers develop better in the ground than in a container. Five-to-seven years later they will be dug and put into wood boxes, and these will sit at the nursery for a full year to recover from the digging before they are sold. So, let's see, it might be year 2025 before I get a return on my investment, and that's if all goes well.\n\nPicea abies 'Malena'\n\nThis past week we finished grafting and sticking cuttings for the winter season, so let's take a look at what was propagated. A cute “Norway spruce,” Picea abies 'Malena' was grafted low onto Picea abies rootstock, but we also planted a couple hundred cuttings, and the cutting grown plants make for a great addition to our cutie (QT) pot program. 'Malena' grows about an inch a year on its own roots so it stays low and dense and it takes about six years to fill a one-gallon pot. That's not highly profitable, but then very little effort is required from the nurseryman. Our oldest plant is in full sun in the Display Garden, and it never suffers like some of the other dwarf Norways, even when we get to 106 degrees with no humidity. 'Malena' originated as a witch's broom mutation in Switzerland in the 1980's.\n\nPicea glauca 'Pixie Dust'\n\nPicea glauca 'Pixie Dust' is a fun plant, and likewise we root cuttings as well as graft low and on standards. Any way presented it is a special addition to a trough or rock garden. As a miniature you can expect it to grow from one to four inches per year, and I find it best to keep my stock plants in a greenhouse so that I'll be rewarded with the four inches per year. What is special about the little Alberta spruce is its second flush of growth in summer that is cream yellow, a “dusting” (by pixies?) that contrasts with the older green shoots. I grew a group in our containers in full sun and the yellow growth help up fairly well, nevertheless I think that PM shade would be the best site in most gardens to keep the foliage looking fresh. 'Pixie Dust' originated at Iseli Nursery in the 1990's and it was selected as one of two “Conifers of the Year” in 2006.\n\nPicea orientalis 'Tom Thumb'\n\nPicea orientalis 'Tom Thumb'\n\nAnother attractive miniature is Picea orientalis 'Tom Thumb'. We graft it onto Picea abies seedlings, and unlike the above two conifers I've never had success rooting the orientalis species (I would love to hear if someone else has). 'Tom Thumb' is the name often encountered in the trade while some name it 'Tom Thumb Gold'. Whichever way, make no mistake, for the plant is gold and there doesn't exist a green version. And no wonder for it originated as a witch's broom mutation on the golden Picea orientalis 'Skylands', and was discovered in the 1980's by Joel Spingam of New York state. 'Tom Thumb' is another miniature, growing one-to-two inches per year, and again I keep my stock in the greenhouse to force the longer growth. In Oregon it will burn in full sun, but in deep shade the foliage will be greenish, so its best to site similar to the 'Pixie Dust'.\n\nPicea pungens 'Maigold'\n\nPicea pungens 'Gebelle's Golden Spring'\n\nPicea pungens 'Spring Blast'\n\nPicea pungens 'Spring Ghost'\n\nThere are a few cultivars of “Colorado spruce,” Picea pungens, that feature new growth in April-May that are colored delightfully in contrast with the older foliage. 'Maigold' (Maygold) from Europe and 'Gebelle's Golden Spring' from Ohio are two very worthy conifers with a cream-yellow flush. The fun lasts for about six weeks before the bright needles begin to fade, and at that point you have a regular looking blue-green Colorado spruce again. The new growth on 'Spring Blast' is more white, while the old foliage is more blue than the previous two cultivars. All of these three are an improvement over my original bi-colored 'Spring Ghost' which burns mercilessly. One wag dubbed it: “Spring Ghost, summer toast,” even though my first tree in the Display Garden (at 35 years of age) looks absolutely spectacular in May before it gets hot.\n\nTsuga mertensiana 'Bump's Blue'\n\nTsuga mertensiana 'Powder Blue'\n\nMy favorite conifer might be Tsuga mertensiana, the “Mountain hemlock” from the mountains of western North America. I favor it primarily because I am most happy when I am away from work and everybody with their problems and I can hike into the thin air where the hemlock hovers on the slopes of our Cascade Mountains. Foliage is blue-gray, but in July light-blue new growth sparkles diamond-like on the tree. T. mertensiana was named for Karl Heinrich Mertens (1796-1830), a German botanist who explored the coast of America aboard a Russian ship. Some question if T. mertensiana should be included in the Tsuga genus because it is very different form the rest with its radially arranged needles and relatively large Picea-like pendant cones. It went from being classified as Pinus mertensiana to Hesperopeuce mertensiana before being lumped into the Tsugas. In any case we graft some of the most blue cultivars onto seedling T. mertensiana – it's not compatible with the other Tsugas – and it's a long process to get the slow-growing conifer to a salable size. 'Bump's Blue' and 'Powder Blue' are Buchholz introductions, while 'Blue Star' was selected in 1965 by L. Konijn from The Netherlands. 'Elizabeth' is a spreading form, growing twice as wide as tall, and was discovered on Mt. Rainier by Elsie Fry who named it for her daughter. Cultivars of T. mertensiana are rare at the garden centers because they are slow-growing and stock trees tend to produce less-than-vigorous scion shoots. Even the rootstock is slow, and ours are four-to-five years old when we are able to graft.\n\nAbies koreana 'Alpine Star'\n\nI enjoy producing Abies grafts because our percentages are usually very high, and besides I like their smell. Can I detect which species is being cut by smell alone? Probably not with accuracy, but almost. As with Mountain hemlock I like the “true firs” because most species originate at the higher elevations. One favorite dwarf is Abies koreana 'Alpine Star'. It was aptly named because its white buds sparkle against the dark green foliage. This tiny gem was selected in Scotland and it is sometimes named 'Alpin Star'.\n\nAbies lasiocarpa 'Hurricane Blue'\n\nAbies lasiocarpa 'Glacier Blue'\n\nAbies koreana x lasiocarpa\n\nAbies lasiocarpa is the “sub-alpine fir,” and it is native to western North America and the Rockies in regions that also contain the mountain hemlock. The specific name refers to the hairy cone scales, but the distinguishing characteristic is the narrow crown. The variety arizonicais the “Corkbark fir” from Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona, but I've never seen it in the wild to know if the crown is also spire-like. It is known for much more blue foliage, so I assume that the various upright pyramidal cultivars with intense blue needles are var. arizonica. 'Hurricane Blue' and 'Glacier Blue' are especially attractive, but without their labels I probably couldn't tell one apart from the other. Also we grow a few hybrids with Abies koreana crossed with Abies lasiocarpa, and those are of German origin. I think the point of the hybrid is that A. koreana is considered easier to grow than straight A. lasiocarpa. In any case the hybrid shows characteristics of both parents, and displays soft gray-blue needles with silver undersides.\n\nAbies koreana 'Vengels'\n\nI grew Abies koreana 'Vengels' from scions that were sent to me, but I had never seen an older specimen or knew why it was selected. I observed that it was relatively slow-growing and upright but not a dwarf. One spring day I walked past my six-year-old trees and was stunned by the beautiful, but odd cones, and instantly I knew why it was a selected cultivar. The cones were more long and narrow than the type with pointy scales. When my oldest trees were ten years old I put them up for sale since I had younger stock in the pipeline. They sold on day one, then I completely regretted parting with them. Sometimes capitalism engulfs me and I make decisions I wished I hadn't. Anyway if you ever see 'Vengels' for sale – from me or anyone – you are advised to buy the wonderful curiosity.\n\nHamamelis x intermedia 'Strawberries and Cream'\n\nWe grafted our Hamamelis a couple of weeks ago, when most of our cultivars were in flower. The blossoms appear on the older branches so they don't affect the newer shoots that we use for scionwood. Generally the “witch hazels” are not strong sellers for me – not like with Acer, Cornus, Ginkgo etc. – because they flower so early, before we ship most of our specimen plants. If they're not in bloom they sit at the garden center looking green and boring, and their customers bypass them for something more exciting. So each fall I order 300 Hamamelis virginiana rootstocks in pots at a graftable size, then I have my choice of about twenty cultivars that I could graft. This year half of them were used for H. x intermedia 'Strawberries and Cream' because it is a newer cultivar (for me) and besides I like the name. Each flower consists of four ribbon-like yellow petals that are colored soft red at their base, a fun combination. The garden centers needn't worry if they don't sell in spring or summer because the brilliant butter-yellow autumn foliage is spectacular as well.\n\nHamamelis x intermedia 'Orange Peel' at Wisley\n\nHamamelis x intermedia 'Orange Peel'\n\nHamamelis x intermedia 'Orange Peel'\n\nAnother Hamamelis that we grafted is H x. intermedia 'Orange Peel', and once again I like the name. I first saw it at Wisley in England one October, and the green leaves were beginning to color orange. I left the path and stepped into the bed to take a close-up photo...and just then a gardener rounded the corner with his rake and wheelbarrow. He didn't say anything, but I sure would have if I was the gardener! Anyway I've grown 'Orange Peel' for about ten years, and besides the lovely fall color the February flowers are a strong orange as well. This is one of many witch hazels developed at the Arboretum Kalmthout in Belgium.\n\nBetula ermanii 'Fincham Cream'\n\nBrian Humphrey\n\nWe grafted a few Betula costata 'Fincham Cream', or so said the label in the Flora Wonder Arboretum. According to Paul Bartlett of Stone Lane Gardens in England the costata species has no cultivars, and all of the cultivars previously placed in costata are in fact Betula ermanii. So, another label to change. I used to be a grower of birches but could never find a good market for them, and this year's propagation is the first time in 15 years. Who knows, maybe my customers will live it up a little and give this nice cultivar a chance. I received my start of 'Fincham Cream' a long time ago, back when I was young. Now my hair is as white as the birch's bark. Bartlett continues, “['Fincham Cream'] from the late Maurice Mason's arboretum at Talbot Manor, Fincham. A batch of seedlings were grown at Brentry/Hillier arboretum and five of these trees were sent by Harold Hillier to Maurice Mason as Betula costata. The best one was selected by Brian Humphrey and called 'Fincham Cream'. Very attractive pale cream smooth bark and superb gold autumn colour.” Brian Humphrey is the Englishman who sent me scions, and until today I didn't know that he also selected the birch. I really should buy the Betula monograph The Genus Betula (2013) by Ashburner and McAllister even though it is horribly expensive.\n\nBetula utilis in the Himalaya\n\nBetula utilis 'Forest Blush'\n\nNext to the 'Fincham Cream' in the Betula section at Flora Farm is Betula utilis 'Forest Blush', also selected and named by Brian Humphrey for its “smooth white bark with a hint of blush-pink. From seed collected by George Forrest in Yunnan, China.” (Hillier). I didn't know that Mr. Humphrey was old enough to be selecting birch seedlings collected by George Forrest. Botanist David Don named the utilis species which means “useful,” but prior to that John Lindley named it B. bhojpattra, its Sanskrit name. It is native to the Himalaya up to 14,000', and one of its “uses” was for writing on the bark Sanskrit scriptures and texts in ancient times. Bhojpattra is derived from Sanskrit bhurja which shares a similarity to other Indo-European words that lead to the common name of “birch.”\n\nBetula utilis var. jacquemontii 'Jermyns'\n\nThe final birch we grafted is B. utilis var. jacquemontii 'Jermyns' which received an Award of Garden Merit. It features attractive bark like the previous two mentioned, but is also famous for its long catkins. According to Hillier, “A very vigorous, medium-sized, broadly-conical tree; the very fine white bark is retained into maturity. Catkins long and showy, up to 17 cm. Selected at Hillier Nurseries before 1960 from plants of var. jacquemontii received from the Netherlands via Belgium.” Who knows if I am wasting my time by propagating these three Betula, but one can do worse than be a swinger...er seller of birches.\n\nSorbus commixta\n\nSorbus commixta graft\n\nEmbley Park House\n\nFlorence Nightingale\n\nI was pleased to receive some scions of Sorbus commixta, a species from Japan, Sakhalin Island and the Korean peninsula. Wait! Did I see this species on TV behind the ski run at the Olympics? All of the better British gardens contain S. commixta which is famous for its orange-to-red autumn color. One cultivar I received is 'Embley', “A superb small tree, with its leaves consistently glowing red in autumn, colouring generally later and remaining on the branches longer. Large, heavy branches of glistening orange-red fruits. Originated at Embley Park in Hampshire before 1970. AM 1971.” (Hillier). Embley Park was the family home of Florence Nightingale from 1825 until her death in 1910, and where “the Lady with the Lamp” claimed she had received her divine calling from God. Another Sorbus grafted was 'Eastern Promise', a hybrid of S. commixta 'Embley'x S. vilmorinii, the latter a species from China introduced by the Abbe Delavay in 1889. Hillier calls S. vilmorinii, “A charming species suitable for a small garden. AM 1916.”\n\nJuana grafting\n\nAgain I boast of my talented grafter Juana, and not only that, but she also led the rooted cutting crew. This year we propagated many hundreds of species and cultivars, but nothing – no matter how popular today – in huge numbers. In the past “good times” the owner of the neighboring nursery pitied me for my conservative, collector-approach to horticulture. In those days he made more money than I, but then he lost it all as his market crashed. I'm not smugly confident though, and probably I worry about my future more than any other nursery owner.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nThe Allure of Lore\n\nKomo rebi\n\nI read recently that an English author/poet – I can't remember who just now – wrote about a plant that if he was forced to know its botanical name that would ruin its magic. I should have written down the quote and by whom, but I didn't because I thought I would remember it forever, and now two weeks later it's gone. Anyway I completely disagree with the sentiment, and for me the “magic” comes from knowing everythingabout the plant, its story in old times as well as in recent days. My wife would probably agree with the poet, for she introduced me to the wonderful concept of komo rebi– that the light that comes through a tree's leaves, rather than the leaves themselves, is what interests her, and the scientific name further encumbers her pleasure. She is the person who named an Acer shirasawanum seedling as 'Sensu' because she was delighted with its fan-like fluttering leaves one summer evening, and sensu means “fan” in Japanese.\n\nAcer shirasawanum 'Sensu'\n\nJim Baggett\n\nYes, 'Sensu' is a beautiful maple whether its leaves flutter or not, and it can be especially brilliant with orange-to-red autumn color. But let's examine its “story.” It was one of many hundreds of Japanese maple seedlings grown by the late Jim Baggett of Corvallis, Oregon, a former food-crop breeder at Oregon State University. The mother tree of 'Sensu' was Acer shirasawanum 'Palmatifolium' which is possibly a hybrid between shirasawanum and palmatum, and indeed 'Sensu' looks intermediate between the two species. The seed was harvested in an open garden setting that was chock-a-block with maple seedlings and cultivars, so we don't really know who was cavorting with who. Baggett was a keen maple hobbyist, but prior to that he was into bamboo. One winter his maple collection – largely in small pots – perished in the freeze, and he was actually relieved because he tired of watering them all by hand. Next he grew enamoured with ferns, or perhaps that was before the maples. Later it was Hostas, but I could never understand how Hostas could satisfy your plant lust after maples. So Baggett raised'Sensu' even though I named and introduced it. The same is true for A. shirasawanum 'Kawaii', 'Shira Red', 'Green Snowflake' and others: he grew, then I named and introduced.\n\nAcer palmatum\n\nThere is more to the 'Sensu' story...which I find of great interest. The maple belongs in the Sapindaceae family* with a lot of other trees that appear very different. Its generic name is Acer, a word that comes from Latin for “sharp,” probably due to many species having sharply pointed leaves. If Latin is the origin of Acer, it shouldn't be pronounced the way it is (“Ā ser”), but rather “Ah ker.” Too late for that now, though.\n\nAesculus hippocastanum\n\nKoelreuteria paniculata\n\n*The “soapberry” family contains 138 genera and 18,58 accepted species which includes the golden raintree (Koelreuteria), horse chestnuts and lychee. Many members contain latex, a milky sap, and others “saponins” which is mildly toxic with soap-like qualities in the foliage, seeds or roots.\n\nAcer shirasawanum\n\nYasuyoshi Shirasawa\n\nTomitaro Makino\n\nThe specific category of 'Sensu' is shirasawanum, although I have admitted that there could be palmatum blood in it also. In any case the seed rises above the leaves per shirasawanum. The species is the “Full moon maple” from Japan's Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu Islands, and the chicken-scratch Japanese characters translate to ooitayameigetsu. “Shirasawa's maple” honors Yasuyoshi Shirasawa (1868-1947), a Japanese botanist who worked with Tomitaro Makino, the “Father of Japanese botany” at the University of Tokyo. Shirasawa named many native plants such as Picea koyamae and Tilia kiusiana.* Shirasawa is also a village located in Adachi District of Fukushima Prefecture, the area devastated by the horrific tsunami a few years ago.\n\nShe got married anyway...\n\n*My wife Haruko grew up in Tokyo where she recognized a preponderance of old Ginkgo, Platanus and Liriodendron tulipifera, the latter an American species. These were growing in parks and as heavily-pruned street trees, and it was Shirasawa who promoted their use. It was Haruko's love of his trees that led her to the study of landscape architecture and her University degree, and ultimately to a year of internship in America to learn more about plants. She promised her father that she would not get married while in America.\n\nRhododendron makinoi\n\nI believe that nothing mentioned above takes any of the “magic” out of 'Sensu', but rather adds to it. You could call it the “Allure of Lore,” with lore meaning a “particular body of knowledge or tradition,” from Old High German lera for “doctrine” and Old English leornian“to learn.” It's too late, but I would have loved to have spent a day with old Shirasawa and Makinoi, but at least I have their plants, with many cultivars of Acer shirasawanum and with Rhododendron makinoi. True, these botanists wore their brains gazing through their microscopes at what exists/existed, while my wife revels at the light spaces between the leaves and branches. They were empirically-oriented scientists studying and classifying plants while Haruko occupies a more ethereal or dreamy realm.\n\nA falling leaf\n\nFlew back to its perch.\n\nA butterfly.\n\n↧\n\nWandering Through Nomenclature\n\nPinus contorta var. contorta\n\nRegular Flora Wonder Blog readers know that at the beginning of my career I worked for an enormous wholesale nursery – now bankrupt – that produced millions of boring trees and shrubs. In my six years there I went from being the new grunt to the manager of a farm that employed 110 men. To be honest I was appointed “manager” by default. It wasn't that I was so great, but rather that there was nobody else even half capable. But in my tenure there I never once used a botanic name for the plants we grew, and even the owner didn't know the botanic name of any of his plants. It didn't matter (to him), and he made scads of money anyway and died a multi-millionaire with a Rolls Royce in his garage. Seriously. It wasn't until I began my own nursery that I found scientific nomenclature to be not only important, but also interesting. For example the conifers were mainly all Pinus at one point, then eventually they were separated into Pinus, Abies, Picea, Pseudotsuga etc. I became fascinated with this naming of names*, and now botanical history has become a hobby that I will pursue until the day I die.\n\n*The Naming of Namesby British author Anna Pavord is an exciting adventure into botanical history, and though ten years my senior, she is probably the first person I would choose to spend an evening with if I could.\n\nPicea polita\n\nAbies procera\n\nGustav Karl Wilhelm Hermann Karsten\n\nOne of my first nomenclatural lessons was that Picea was the generic name for “spruce” and Abieswas for the “true” firs. To the general public they surely appear to be about the same – upright, evergreen trees that produce cones that are often full of sticky pitch. But of course the cones are erect on the branches of the firs, while the Picea cones are erect at first but then drop downward as they mature (I'm tempted, but wont make a joke here). And anybody who works with Picea and Abies knows that the former has prickly needles while the latter are more soft (again, no jokes). But at first I was confused. Let's see: Picea is spruce and Abies is fir...then what the hell is Picea abies? What a confusing name for the common “Norway spruce!” We can blame Linnaeus/Karsten for the problematic name. You all know about Linnaeus, but I'll tell you a little about Karsten – Gustav Karl Wilhelm Hermann Karsten (1817-1908), but why so many names? He was a German botanist and geologist who followed my hero, Alexander von Humboldt, and traveled in Venezuela, Ecuador and Colombia from 1844 to 1856, and later served as professor of plant physiology at the University of Vienna. As follower of Linnaeus he was the binomial author of many botanic species.\n\nAcer pensylvanicum\n\nScilla peruviana\n\nLast week's Flora Wonder Blog, The Allure of Lore, suggested that the more you know about the scientific name of a plant, the more you can appreciate it, and that no diminishment to its “magic” need occur. After all, the haughty botanists who bestowed most of the generic and specific names (after the Linnaeus binomial system) were allowed the award of “first name sticks” no matter how dumb or wrong it might seem to us today. Thus we have Acer pensylvanicum spelled rong – but too late – and Scilla peruviana that doesn't come from Peru.\n\nAbies lasiocarpa\n\nI'll admit that the botanic names are sometimes rather petty, or at least to me. We learned last week that Abies lasiocarpa was named for its hairy cone scales. If I looked at the fir for every day of my life I would never distinguish it for its hairy scales. On the other hand, the next time I see a cone I will certainly check the scales, and hopefully I will be with someone so I can boast of my botanic knowledge.\n\nAbies balsamea var. phanerolepis rootstock\n\nFor the past few years we have been keeping track of the species of rootstock used as understock for our Abies grafts. Prior to that I could only tell you what we used for the current season, not what the rootstock might have been ten years ago. The choices could have been A. koreana, A. firma, A. balsamea or A. balsamea var. phanerolepis. To a customer in the humid southeast USA, he would be happy to know that the A. firma was the rootstock, and for someone in Oregon he probably wouldn't care. This past winter the majority of our grafts was on A. balsamea var. phanerolepis, commonly known as “Canaan fir.” It is native to isolated pockets in the mountains of Virginia and West Virginia, and the common name comes from one location in the Canaan Valley northeast of Elkins, West Virginia. For you heathens in the readership, Canaan was a Semitic-speaking region in the ancient Near East that corresponds to modern-day Israel, Palestine and Jordan. Phanerolepis is derived from Greek phaner or phanero for “visible” or “manifest,” and lepis meaning “scale.” Therefore you have a fir with conspicuous bracts unlike the hairy cones of A. lasiocarpa mentioned previously.\n\nCorydalis flexuosa 'Blue Panda'\n\nAgonis flexuosa\n\nReuben Hatch\n\nLet's take a look at some other plant names and see what we can learn. Last week we sold out of our crop of Corydalis flexuosa 'Blue Panda'. It was collected in China and named by my “grandfather” Reuben Hatch about 30 years ago. Later it was patented by Terra Nova Nursery of Oregon but it should nothave been because 1) it was collected in the wild and 2) it had been sold under the 'Blue Panda' name for about five years prior to the patent. The specific name of flexuosa is a guess and I'm not sure if that was ever proven for certain. Flexuosa does not mean “flexible” in the botanic sense, rather it means “full of bends” in Latin. A few other flexuosa species include Agonis flexuosa (a tree species), Grevillea flexuosa (a shrub species), Deschampsia flexuosa (a bunch grass species), Scutellastra flexuosa (a sea snail) and others. I don't know what is so “bendful” with the Corydalis – the foliage or flower?\n\nCorydalis scouleri\n\nFumaria officinalis (photo by Luis Nunes Alberto)\n\nJohn Scouler\n\nThe origin of the word Corydalis is from Greek korudallis which is a variant of korudos for “crested lark” referring to the appearance of the flowers. The flowers are similar to an annual weed, Fumaria, whose name is from Latin fumus terrae, meaning “smoke of the earth.” Fumaria is a genus of about 60 species and it grows all over the world. Corydalis is native to Asia, Europe and North America and we even have a species in Oregon, C. scouleri, which honors Scottish naturalist John Scouler (1804-1871). Scouler was smarter than he looked, and after accompanying David Douglas on the Columbia River he returned to Europe and was appointed professor of mineralogy, geology, zoology, and botany to the Royal Dublin Society. I have traveled and botanized on the Columbia also, but I have never been appointed to any “professorship” ever.\n\nCorylopsis glaucophylla\n\nCorylopsis spicata 'Golden Spring'\n\nThe entry following Corydalis on the Buchholz Master Plant List is Corylopsis, and the genus is commonly known as the “winter hazel.” That's obvious because the generic name comes from corylus for “hazel” and the Latin suffix opsis meaning “resembling.” Generally speaking I don't like naming plants for other plants that they resemble, and I think that the botanical namers should have been more original. Besides, Corylopsis is in the Hamamelaceae family and Corylus is in the Betulaceae family. Corylopsis spicata (Latin for “spiked”) is a species with the attractive cultivar 'Golden Spring' and it is the only winter hazel we currently propagate. I have a number of other species in the collection but they didn't sell very well. The nomenclature is murky for Corylopsis anyway, or at least it was for me. One species had beautiful foliage and was called glaucophyllaby the now defunct Heronswood Nursery, but I've never seen it listed before or after I acquired my plant 15 years ago. Could it have been that glaucophylla was a cultivar name? If so it is an illegitimate name.\n\nCrocus sieberi 'Firefly'\n\nWe have never sold Crocus at Buchholz Nursery, however the genus is no stranger to the Flora Wonder Arboretum. It is a member of the iris family which develops from corms and I am delighted to know that the plural of Crocus is Croci, pronounced as krō-kē . There are about 75 species native to the Alps, southern Europe and the Mediterranean and they perform spectacularly in Oregon...well, if you can keep the damn squirrels away from them. Crocus is the saffron plant and the name is from Greek krokos which is of Semitic origin, from the Akkadian* kurkanu for saffron. In particular I like Crocus sieberi, a late-winter bloomer also known as the “snow crocus.” The species is named for Franz Sieber (1789-1844), a botanist and collector from Prague who traveled to the Middle East, South Africa and Australia. In his later life Sieber went loony and wound up in the Prague insane asylum where he spent his final fourteen years, but don't blame the Croci for his dementia.\n\nThe Akkadian Empire (from the Ancient History Encyclopedia)\n\nBronze Head of an Akkadian Ruler\n\n*The Akkadian Empire was the first or one of the first “empires” in history. The Semitic-speaking people were centered in the city of Akkad and they ruled across Mesopotamia, the Levant and Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). Sargon of Akkad (2296-2240 BCE) was the most famous of the bad-ass rulers, except that under his command women were actually respected and got to play important roles in religious matters. As with today's constant turmoil, the cities within the empire squabbled – I think it's a genetic thing – and the empire collapsed, and was then followed by the Babylonian Civilization.\n\nAesculus hippocastanum 'Wisselink' at Sebright Gardens\n\nWhat's the skinny on the variegated “Horse chestnut,” Aesculus hippocastanum 'Wisselink'? I first saw the cultivar at the Bellevue Botanic Garden near Seattle, then again at Sebright Gardens, Oregon, where a magnificent specimen was displayed. The foliage on the cultivar was nearly white (in spring) with enough green in the leaf veins to keep the selection from burning horribly in summer. Thomas Johnson of Sebright told me that his tree came from Lucile at Whitman Farms, Oregon. I begged one from Lucile and the other day we picked up our tree, but it was labeled A. h. 'Variegata'. So...I'm wondering if I have the real 'W.'?\n\nIrina Boboshko\n\nVladimir Horowitz\n\nI'm not a chestnut guy – I've always figured that I didn't have room for the various species in the collection, but Sebright's wonderful specimen allowed me to change my mind. Aesculus hippocastanum is the “Horse chestnut,” a species native to the “wild border region between Greece and Albania,” according to Hillier in the Manual of Trees and Shrubs (2014). Wow! – I was there when I was single in my 20's, but I didn't find the region so “wild,” except that I encountered a preponderance of hitch-hiking lesbians...to my dismay. The chestnut is cultivated for its shade-providing properties and for its white, yellow or red flowers. Hillier says that it is “Possibly the most beautiful of large, flowering trees in the British Isles,” but he doesn't mention the cultivars 'Variegata' or 'Wisselink'. The common name of “Horse chestnut” is because it was thought that horses ate the seeds to clear chest problems and to help with breathing. Nonsense to that because the fruit and seeds are actually poisonous to horses. Those so afflicted will be happy to know that A. hippocastanum has an anti-inflammatory property, and so it is effective in the treatment of hemorrhoids, a form of varicose veins. If only Napoleon could have known. Oh, lest I forget the subject of this blog, the name Aesculusis Latin for a variety of oak tree, although chestnuts and oaks are not in the same botanical family. Besides curing butt-itch, the tree is often found in Bavarian beer gardens, because in olden times, before refrigeration, brewers would dig cellars for lagering, and the chestnut's spreading, dense canopy would protect the cellars from summer heat and the shallow root-system would not grow into the caverns. Also, Ukranians love the species, and its flower is the symbol of the city of Kiev, the birthplace of pianist Vladimir Horowitz and home to the beautiful, former Buchholz Nursery intern, Irina Boboshko, one of our best ever.\n\nThe genus Cotoneaster is a useful small tree or shrub in the rose family, and the gardener (and his birds) is/are rewarded with glossy yellow-to-orange-to-red fruits in autumn and early winter. Oddly, the generic name is from Latin cotoneumfor “quince” and aster which denotes “incomplete resemblance,” which implies that it is a plant that resembles a quince, but not quite. “Quince,” or Chaenomeles is a genus of shrubs also in the rose (Rosaceae) family. The generic name Chaenomeles is from New Latin chaemo, and that from Greek chainein and Greek meles for “apple” or “fruit.” Apple is generically Malus – not as in “Malice for None,” and also nothing bad – but rather a genus in the Rosaceae family distinguished by fruit without grit cells. Malusis derived from Latin malum for “apple,” and that from Doric Greek malon. If you were paying attention in high school or freshman college, you would know that “Doric” or “Dorian” was an ancient Greek dialect, and not just a type of architecturally-vertical column. I am particularly enamored with Cotoneaster frigidus which is native to the Himalaya, and I guess it was named because of its origin to a cold place? Frigidus is Latin from frigere“to be cold,” similar to Latin frigusfor “frost,” and that from Greek rhigos. Anyway C. frigidus is a “tree” Cotoneaster, so give it plenty of room in the garden.\n\nCaesalpinia gilliesii\n\nIf you want to attract hummingbirds you can do no better than grow a specimen of Caesalpinia gilliesii, the “bird of paradise” with yellow flowers and red filaments. This bush/tree is native to Argentina and Uruguay and some list it as hardy to USDA zone 6. Plant Delights Nursery reports that one survives at the Denver Botanic Garden, but PD rates it as zone 7a. Not only are the flowers very showy, but Caesalpinia is friendly to other plants. The genus has a symbiotic relationship with some soil bacteria, and nodules develop on the roots which provide nitrogen for other plants growing nearby. Caesalpinia was named for the Italian botanist Andrea Cesalpino (1519-1603), and it was bestowed by the Franciscan monk Charles Plumier. Linnaeus retained the name in his system and praised his predecessor with the following: Quisquis hic exstiterit primos concedat honores Casalpine Tibi primaque certa dabit.* Linnaeus honors the Scottish naval surgeon and botanist John Gillies (1792-1834) with the specific name. He was a wimp however, and suffered from poor health and died at age 42 in Edinburgh. While in South America he endured wars and civil unrest along with his chronic ill health, but he was able to send numerous plants to Hooker at the RBG Kew.\n\n*Basically, Cesalpino was the best.\n\nBotanical nomenclature and its history is fascinating, and if I haven't convinced you of that it's the fault of my presentation rather than the subject matter itself. Were we “Wandering Through Nomenclature,” or “Rambling Through Nomenclature?” – you can decide. The word nomenclature is derived from Latin nomen for “name” and calaremeaning “to call.” Botanical nomenclature is really a means of communication, a way of mapping our natural world in a shared language. With this tool I can speak to Icelanders, South Americans and Asian about our earthian floral experience, and we can all learn from each other. My life has been a plebeian grind, and growing plants has not been an easy or secure way to feed my family, but along the way I have found happiness and satisfaction, and thank you Flora for your bountiful gifts.\n\n↧\n\nMurder in the Grove\n\nFlora Wonder Arboretum\n\nI have mixed feelings about the rights of property owners. But I am always right, though. I plant trees in the Flora Wonder Arboretum, and I cut them down when I feel like it without consulting anyone. When a tree isn't prospering, or when two trees are vying for limited space, that's when we sharpen the axe. It's my land and my trees and I pay a lot in property taxes so the government bureaucrats can be ladled with lofty retirement pensions, so nobody is going to tell me what to do.\n\nI was disgusted to read in the local newspaper – which I take mainly for the obituary – that one of Forest Grove, Oregon's 140 year old Sequoiadendron (one of about 20) was being cut down on 18th Avenue and Elm Street. I knew instantly the tree in question because I grew up just six blocks away, and I was blessed to live under two of Forest Grove's historic trees myself. My whole life, since I was just about eight, I have marveled at the stupidity of the property owner who originally built a house just a few feet away from a giant redwood.\n\nI drove to the location and was shocked to see all of the side branches removed, and the only thing left was a single trunk, and now that has been removed as well. I can cut down a tree if I want, but I was puzzled that the city allowed a historic tree to be removed with no civic discussion. The house in question is a beater home and the only sensible thing to do was tear it down and save the tree. The redwoods of Forest Grove are among the oldest and largest in the world outside of their native stands, in spite of contending with streets and houses for root space.\n\nThe section of the paper that alerted me to the murder is called Citizen's View, and two local historians – the Bilderbacks – told the story of how the redwoods came to the Grove in the first place. I will paraphrase their history lesson so the local fish wrap won't sue me for libel. One Johnny Porter arrived in the Forest Grove area via the Oregon Trail in 1847. Like other knuckleheads at the time he was lured to the California gold fields in 1849. He came home without gold, “but armed with tales of magnificent coniferous trees that grew to seemingly unimaginable heights along California's coast. He returned to the California coast at least twice more until the early 1880's, bringing home bags of cones.... Over the decades most have fallen to disease, development, or disregarded.... The 18th Avenue example is the latest victim.... It's a victim of having been planted 140 or so years ago in an untenable place, too close to houses, streets and utility lines blah blah blah...”\n\nWoah! That's too much. I fired off a letter to the editor immediately which was published the following week:\n\nIn Citizens View, February, 28, 2018 the local Bilderback historians told the story of Johnny Porter, a Gold Rush \"Forty-Niner,\" who brought back redwood cones to the Forest Grove area.\n\nSequoia sempervirens\n\nWhile I applaud any mention of Forest Grove's wonderful trees, we should get the facts straight. Porter did not collect cones of conifers of \"unimaginable heights along California's coast.\" The tallest trees on earth do indeed occur on the California (and southern Oregon) coast and they are Sequoia sempervirens, commonly called the \"coast redwoods.\" Specimens can reach up to 379 feet and can live up to 1,200-1,800 years.\n\nThe road to Johnny Porter's home\n\nThe redwood cones that Porter collected were the giantredwoods, Sequoiadendron giganteum, from the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada. They are not as tall as their coastal cousins, but they are more massive in volume. The giants can reach 311 feet tall with a trunk diameter at chest height of 27 feet.\n\nAlthough San Francisco prospered from the Gold Rush, it did not occur along the coast. Coloma, California is famous for being the site where James W. Marshall found gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills at Sutter's Mill on January 24, 1848. The town is 36 miles northeast of Sacramento.\n\nA botanical error isn't my main purpose for this letter, rather it's the Bilderback's statement concerning the recently murdered redwood at 18th Ave. and Elm St. : \"It's a victim of having been planted 140 or so years ago in an untenable place, too close to houses, streets and utility lines.\" What a backward comment. The tree predates the beater house that it is ruining. The street and utility lines weren't an issue, as other giant redwoods in town are near them too.\n\nI was initially irate to see the tree denuded of all of its branches, and I assume the entire removal will be soon. I called city hall to discuss the process of getting permission to remove a historic tree. Dan Riordan of city planning responded that the tree wasn't \"historic\" in a technical sense because the property owners hadn't volunteered to have their tree so designated (kind of like with houses). I learned further that a certified arborist had determined a few years before that the tree had disease issues.\n\nNelis Kools from The Netherlands, owner of the greatest number of redwood cultivars\n\nTalon Buchholz with Mr. & Mrs. Van Hoey Smith, owners of the Arboretum Trompenburg\n\nTodd Forrest oversees all aspects of the management and development of the New York Botanical Garden\n\nI first thought that the tree had more rights than the property owner, and tear down the house instead. Now I understand that the best course was to remove the tree. But make no mistake: the behemoth will be missed. I am owner of the Flora Wonder Arboretum and I grew up in Forest Grove in a yard with two of the giant redwoods (16th and Main). I have toured with many of the greatest plantspeople in the world to see Forest Grove's Sequoiadendrons, and everyone's favorite was the spectacle of tree versus house on 18th Avenue.\n\nNow I retract my conclusion that the “diseased” tree needed to go because once it lay horizontal in pieces I could see that it was perfectly sound, and believe me – I am an expert on tree problems, probably more so than any “certified” arborist from Forest Grove. I asked this “city planner,” Riordan, if another (deranged) property owner wanted to remove another historic tree, say to eliminate the raking of fallen needles, cones and branchlets, or to make way for a new garage for example, then there was nothing to prevent it from happening. He didn't sound worried because the cost “would be prohibitive.” Well, the cost didn't prevent the 18th Avenue owner from saving his house over the tree. The Forest Grove scuttlebutt is that General Tree Service charged $36,000 for the removal. So, take out a new mortgage and look at it kind of like a kitchen/bathroom remodel. Maybe they purchased the house at a discount price because of its “problem,” and the costly need to address it.\n\nThe plot thickens because my daughter is in the same 6th-grade class as the son of the resident parents. I don't know if any arborist declared it diseased, but it was bothering the family because the branches scraped against the bedroom window when the wind blew. Prune a few branches – problem easily solved. But the tree was lifting the house's foundation and the two couldn't co-exist indefinitely. Nobody gave me a chance to buy the property, or to help raise funds for its purchase. Suddenly the tree is gone, all when my back was turned.\n\nGovernor Withycombe tree\n\nAnother Sequoiadendron was saved about 15 years ago about 8 miles from Forest Grove. A natural-gas pipeline was proposed along Hwy 219 south of Hillsboro, Oregon, and the tree was “in the way.” It could have been one of Johnny Porter's trees but I'm not sure, but I've always admired its up-arm of peace – How!, like a Native American greeting me when I drive past. It was a few years younger than the 18th Avenue victim, but it was saved when a group got together to protest, me included. The simple answer – my proposal – was to install the pipeline on the otherside of the highway. “Oh oh oh, but the engineers...” For crysakes, the engineers are intelligent people, but they are prone to acting stupid apparently. Anyway the tree was saved and the pipeline went along the other side, and the reason it happened was because someone knew that the tree was planted by the late Governor Withycombe* on his family farm on his wedding day, therefore it was declared a “heritage” tree.\n\nGovernor Withycombe\n\n*James Withycombe was Oregon's governor from 1914 until his death in 1919. Born in Tavistock, England he came to Oregon with his parents in 1871 (when only 17).He purchased a farm south of Hillsboro and married Isabel Carpenter on June 5, 1875, and on that day he planted the redwood. The tree is only 120-130' in height, but its circumference was over 35' in 2002. It was dedicated as a \"heritage tree\" on July 27, 2002.\n\nI seethed in the days that followed the redwood death on 18thAve. Who was this arborist who deemed a perfectly-healthy tree to be “diseased,” and I'd sure like to see the report.\n\nAraucaria araucana\n\nMy 12-year-old daughter and I drive from our country home into Forest Grove a few times each week. I tell her about the trees in the Grove, and I keep it simple and try not to make it preachy or boring. On Maple Street and 17th Avenue, not far from the horizontal Sequoiadendron, is (er...was) a “Monkey Puzzle” tree, a female with large voluptuous cones. Saya got to learn that the species is dioecious – and what that means, that male and female cones appear on separate trees. Usually. I explained that trees are like people...that, that...Saya waved her hand horizontally, shaking it in the manner of describing someone in the “other” category. God, the kids learn stuff so young these days.\n\nMonkey Puzzle no longer\n\nBut to my horror, our Araucaria araucana, all 35' feet of it, all perfectly healthy, had been cut down. Saya knew that I was depressed about the Sequoiadendron, but now I had to deal with the death of our shared friend, the Monkey Puzzle. Why, why, why?\n\nStill pissed about the redwood's death, I called the only arborist listed as “certified” in the Forest Grove area. There are at least 30 “tree specialists” listed on the internet, such as Edwardo's Tree Service and Bjorn's Tree Service, but I thought I would try the one certifiedarborist, whatever that means. When I asked him about the tree's “disease issues” he snapped back defensively that he didn't declare it diseased and that he had nothing to do with its removal. I pressed and asked who else mighthave declared it so, but he didn't know or didn't want to say. I thanked him for his time and was about to hang up, but I asked about the death of the Monkey Puzzle on 17th and Maple. He responded by saying that he didn't like the species because “it isn't native, and besides they die from overwatering.” I replied that the tree was perfectly healthy; not to argue, but just saying. He repeated that they're not native, that “they come from the Carolinas where they are harvested as timber trees.” I said thank you, thank you and hung up while he was still talking. Even Saya knows they are native to Chile and they are that country's National Tree, not the “Carolinas.” Certifiedarborist, indeed!\n\nFor many, March is the time for the NCAA men's and women's basketball tournament, and it is known as “March Madness.” Unfortunately a worse madness has engulfed a few Grovians this month, where property owners can cut down historic or significant trees and that there is no community restraint on them. The Sequoiadendron wasn't a victim of having been planted in an “untenable place,” but rather it was a victim of ignorance, and shame on Forest Grove's non-leaders for allowing it to happen.\n\n16th Ave and Main St. where Buchholz grew up\n\n↧\n\nPendant Plants\n\nAbies koreana 'Blue Cone Pendula'\n\nAbies procera 'Glauca Pendula'\n\nI have dozens of plants with 'Pendula'in the cultivar name, not to mention the specific name of Betula pendula. Sometimes the names are probably not valid, such as Abies koreana 'Blue Cone Pendula', where English and Latin are combined, and besides I think it was “selected” after the 1950's when you don't get to use Latin anymore. Not only is the name illegitimate, but the branches and trunk display no pendant characteristic. Maybe the original tree wept, but my 20-year-old specimen has grown into a perfect Christmas-tree shape. The same happened with Abies procera 'Glauca Pendula' which I look at out of the office window every day. I cut the scions myself from the Dutchman's nursery yard, and his tree had crept to 10' wide and less than one foot tall, and I supposed it to be about 20 years old. I threw away the 'Glauca Pendula' label because visitors would look at the label, then at the tree, and then at me like I was crazy. I replaced it with Abies procera 'Glauca' and now the world is right. I'll admit to staking the false 'Glauca Pendula' two or three years after it was grafted so that it would spill out from a centered trunk, then it was planted out into the Display Garden where I didn't really want a big tree. I guess it took matters into its own hand and proudly shot skyward, wanting to be the big shot in the garden.\n\nXanthocyparis nootkatensis 'Pendula'\n\nXanthocyparis nootkatensis 'Green Arrow'\n\nBuchholz Nursery and the Flora Wonder Arboretum is a freak-show to some, where there exists very little that's normal. Here green trees are blue, normal-shaped trees are extra skinny or very dwarf, and where species that are supposed to be upright have branches that droop downward. Generally the pendulous trees are more dwarf or narrow so they fit better into today's smaller gardens. Chamaecyparis nootkatensis 'Pendula' is a better fit than the species type, and in the wild the latter can develop into huge spreading (ugly) trees that no one would want in their garden. Of course, one can do better than C. n. 'Pendula' by planting 'Green Arrow' or 'Van den Akker', which are far more narrow, and in fact you hardly ever see the old 'Pendula' in the garden centers anymore. Excuse me, I should have used the new nomen, Xanthocyparis, instead of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis.\n\nCupressus x arilosa 'Pendula'\n\nI used to have a large cypress collection with starts coming from botanists, hobbyists, arboreta and other nurserymen. Fortunately, blasts of cold from the Arctic reduced the number of species to a more manageable size. But still the survivors grew to huge proportions and there was never really a good market for them. Some of them went to Flora Farm and I lined them out along the road to the Western hills, and ultimately that might be the reason I bought the 60 acre farm: to house useless non-profitable species. Two Cupressus x arilosa 'Pendula' were planted on rental property near the nursery, and though I don't use that ground anymore, the new owner has allowed them to stay and I see them daily as I drive to work. The parents of the cross were C. arizonica and C. torulosa, the latter a Himalayan-foothill species that's barely hardy in Oregon. I don't know who performed the cross, or if 'Pendula' is any more weeping than any of the other hybrid offspring. Today the trees are 30' tall, and I'm happy that I can “own” them for a few seconds per day without any need to take care of them.\n\nJuniperus rigida 'Pendula'\n\nAnother member of the Cupressaceae family is Juniperus, and rigida 'Pendula' is a graceful tree-size selection. The rigida species is native to Japan, Korea and northern China. It was introduced by J.G. Veitch in 1861 and first described by Siebold and Zuccarini, two German botanists. I have never seen the straight species anywhere, but in The Hillier Manual of Trees and Shrubs (2014) it is described as “elegant” and with “gracefully drooping branchlets.” “A lovely species.” That's how I would describe J. r. 'Pendula', so I wonder to what degree 'Pendula' is a cultivar, and in fact Hillier doesn't list any cultivars of rigida. I asked Seth if he knew where we had Juniper rigida 'Pendula' growing and he didn't know. Office manager Eric doesn't know either, and no one else at the nursery knows since we don't propagate it anymore. I am the only one who knows and I told Seth it is “ten steps away from where you park every day.” A hedge was planted about 30 years ago between my nursery and the neighbors...and maybe it's not so “lovely” if nobody has noticed it or has ever wondered about it.\n\nLagarostrobus franklinii 'Pendula'\n\nSimilar to Juniperus rigida where 'Pendula' might just be describing the species – and not really a cultivar – the same could be true for Lagarostrobus franklinii 'Pendula'. Hillier also calls the species “graceful” with “slender, drooping branches.” It is commonly known as the “Huon pine” and is native to Tasmania and Australia, but it is not common in America because it is only hardy to about 10-15 degrees F. When I first grew Lagarostrobus it was originally included in the Dacrydium genus (Hooker), but the two never seemed to be all that closely related. Later I was visiting an English arboretum (somewhere) and I saw that it had been renamed, and to no surprise, except that both genera are in the Podocarpaceae family. (I would have guessed that Lagarostrobus would be a member of the Cupressaceae family, but I guess that's why I'll never be a botanist).\n\nPicea glauca 'Pendula'\n\nWhile we can question if some 'Pendula' cultivars are really valid, Picea glauca 'Pendula' certainly is. According to the Iseli Nursery website, the cultivar was “rediscovered” in 1982 at the Morton Arboretum (Chicago) where a specimen had grown since 1958, and that tree came from D. Hill Nursery, propagated from a tree in a native stand near Guelph, Ontario. There could be more than one “pendula” however, for the American Conifer Society claims, “This cultivar originated as a spontaneous weeping mutation found in the 1860's in Trianon Park, Versailles, France. French botanist Elie-Abel Carriere formally described it in botanical literature in 1867 in Traite General des Coniferes.” Indeed, at the beginning of my career I had two different forms named Picea glauca 'Pendula', and I eventually ditched the one that wasn't so narrow.\n\nPseudotsuga menziesii 'Pendula'\n\nPseudotsuga menziesii 'Toledo Weeper'\n\nPseudotsuga menziesii 'Ft. Ann'\n\nThe original Pseudotsuga menziesii 'Graceful Grace'\n\nHillier doesn't mention a Picea glauca 'Pendula' at all, which I think is the most serious omission in the Manual. If they had included 'Pendula' it probably would have been described as Pendula Group, which is what they do for Pseudotsuga menziesii Pendula Group (without the single quotes). It/they is/are described as “An unusual form with weeping branches. C. 1868.” A “group” is absolutely correct, and I have seen forms of our “Douglas fir” that sort-of-weep, such as 'Ft. Ann', to some that do so exceedingly. Hillier does mention the singular cultivar 'Glauca Pendula' which is described as a “small weeping tree of graceful habit. C. 1891.” It originated as a seedling selected at Simon-Louis Freres Nursery in France, but the seed was probably the bluish strain from somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. My favorite of the gray-blue-green weepers is 'Graceful Grace' and the photo above is the original tree at a Masonic home in Pennsylvania. Sadly it was murdered to make way for a larger parking lot. Ouch!\n\nChamaecyparis lawsoniana 'Imbricata Pendula'\n\nChamaecyparis lawsoniana 'Imbricata Pendula' is a fantastic medium-sized tree, but sadly it is encumbered with its clinically old-fashioned name. 'Imbricata Pendula'– please! As I have preached before we propagate by grafting onto Chamaecyparis lawsoniana 'D.R.' (disease resistant rootstock) where we achieve from 90-95% each year. Hillier describes it as, “A small, loose, conical tree with thin decumbent branches and whip-like pendulous branchlets. Foliage mid-green. Raised from seed by R.E. Harrison in New Zealand about 1930 but not introduced until much later by D. Teese, Australia, as propagation is difficult.” Once again Hillier goes parochial* with “propagation is difficult,” and I think anyone in the British Isles with healthy rootstock and scions could accomplish the same successful results as I. Maybe rooting'Imbricata Pendula' is difficult, but I wouldn't know because why invite the root-rot disease problem by growing it on its own roots?\n\n*Parochial is from Greek paroikia meaning “temporary residence,” from paroikos for “stranger.”\n\nCercidiphyllum japonicum 'Pendulum'\n\nCercidiphyllum japonicum 'Pendulum' will grow into a medium-sized weeping deciduous tree. You can't cram it into a small garden as it will spread more wide than tall, or at least it has for me. The genus is native to Japan and China and can grow to more than 100' in the wild even though it is considered an understory tree. The generic name comes from Greek kerkismeaning “redbud” (Cercis for “round”) and phyllonmeaning a “leaf.” “Katsura tree” is the common name, and of course we also have 'Katsura' as the cultivar name for an Acer palmatum and for a Pieris japonica. I went to my resident Japanese language expert – my wife – and asked her what was the katsuraword meaning. I should never ask her language questions when she is cooking dinner because dinner will burn, and if I ask her when we are eating dinner it will go cold. Seldom are Japanese answers quick and concise. Haruko explored the possibilities which rambled: “District name in China, old China decorative object, Chinese story that the tree is from the moon (because of round leaves?), happy special meaning, like for a girl's name – well, not a girl's name, but one of the characters of katsura is used in a girl's name, China, China, China – you know, Japan is suburb of China, everything from China, the Oleaceae family is katsura, maybe Jasmine etc.” Yeah, dinner got cold, and know that this blog is hard work. Then, Haruko tossed out the theory that katsura means “fragrant tree.” Ok, enough dear, my potatoes are cold. I like the fragranttheory, except that the Acer and Pieris cultivars have no fragrance, but the Cercidiphyllum does smell...interestingly in autumn with an odor which has been variously described as vanilla, burnt sugar and old apples.\n\nAlbizia julibrissin 'Pendula'\n\nBotanist Antonio Durazzini first described the “Silk tree,” Albizia, when it was introduced to Europe from Iran, and he named the genus after the Italian nobleman Filippo Albizzi. It's interesting that the Italian's name contains two “z's” but the generic name only has one. The specific name is a corruption of the Persian word gul-i abrisham which means “silk flower.” It seems like every species of tree in the world contains at least one weeping form, but I had never seen nor heard of one for Albizia julibrissin until I saw a large specimen in a North Carolina nursery a few years ago. Frankly it was sprawling and unattractive, but maybe when in flower it's not so bad.\n\nPyrus salicifolia 'Pendula'\n\nAnother large and somewhat sprawling deciduous tree is Pyrus salicifolia 'Pendula', the weeping “willow-leaf pear.” It is fast-growing and our oldest specimen is 12' tall by 10' wide after only ten years. Last winter I moved a Magnolia out of its way because I could see the two were in for trouble. P. salicifolia is native to southern Europe and the Middle East and was introduced to horticulture in 1780. The specific epithet comes from Salix plus folia for the leaf with its shiny silver gray foliage. Pyrus is a member of the Rosaceae family and it is the old Latin name for pear. The word pear is from Germanic pera, and that perhaps of Semitic origin pirameaning “fruit.” The genus is thought to have originated in western China in the foothills of the Tian Shan mountain range, then spread north and south along mountain chains, eventually evolving to about 20 major species. China produces the most pears in the world (by far) – 18 millions of tons per year compared to 0.75 for the USA. Just so you know, pears ripen at room temperature, but they will ripen faster if placed next to bananas in a fruit bowl. That doesn't matter, though, because P. salicifolia won't yield anything good to eat, the fruits being hard and astringent.\n\nSalix caprea 'Pendula'\n\nSalix caprea 'Pendula' forms a neat weeping tree, and I used to grow it at the beginning of my career, but now I only have one left which grows down by the pond. The caprea species is native to Europe and western and central Asia, and besides being known as “pussy willow” it is also known as “goat willow.” Goats will eat anything, but the common name probably can be traced to Hieronymus Bosch's 1546 herbal, where the willow is being eaten by a goat.* Salix caprea is dioecious, with male and female catkins on different plants, and 'Pendula' is usually grafted atop another Salix because it is surprisingly not inclined to root for the nurseryman. The genus Salix is in the Salicaceae family and the plural of salix is salices.\n\n*Caprea is a wild female goat.\n\nFagus sylvatica 'Aurea Pendula'\n\nThere are a number of cultivars of “weeping beeches,” Fagus sylvatica, the European beech in the Fagaceae family. All of the cultivars with 'Pendula' in the name were cultivated over 100 years ago, so their Latin names are valid. Newer weeping cultivars skip the Latin and were given names like 'Purple Fountain' and 'Black Swan'. 'Pendula' dates back to 1836 and I have seen enormous specimens in Europe, and like with people some have narrow shapes while others can be more broad than tall. 'Purpurea Pendula' dates back to 1865 and it forms a more dwarf, neat mound. We stopped growing it – though I love the tree – because the branches were so brittle when digging and shipping. My favorite is 'Aurea Pendula' which “originated as a sport on 'Pendula' about 1900.” (Hillier). I'm not sure why it's not more common in the trade because it's a cultivar we graft in the greatest number, and I have never had any difficulty to sell them. Members of a crop will grow at different rates and with the propensity for different shapes, but overall 'Aurea Pendula' is not too slow. Siting in the garden is an issue because in full sun (in Oregon) the leaves will scorch, but if in too much shade the leaves will appear greenish. As summer approaches the butter-yellow of spring fades a bit to green, and that's probably good when we reach our 100 degree days, which we do just about every year. I have 'Aurea Pendula' planted in a few garden locations, but the tree depicted above in our Display Garden is my favorite, my “Golden Girl.”\n\nGinkgo biloba 'Pendula'\n\nI have a Ginkgo biloba 'Pendula' in the landscape above a pool, but it spreads rather than weepsand we even prune the top to keep it low and wide. Hillier lists a Pendula Group, “A remarkable form with spreading or weeping branches.” I have seen it/them in other gardens and some do indeed grow low to the ground, seemingly without any gardener's intervention. But not for me so we stopped propagating it. I've said it before: there's nothing worse than a “pendula” that doesn't weep.\n\nStewartia monadelpha 'Pendula'\n\nThe final tree that I'll mention came to me from Japan as Stewartia monadelpha 'Pendula', so that can't be a valid name. I wish the sender would have used its Japanese name without trying to translate for me into 'Pendula'. I was lucky to get it at all, but my young wife was quite adept at floating with old-geezer Japanese nurserymen and cajoling them into sending me some good stuff. Well, I sent them some good stuff too. My oldest specimen displays a cinnamon-orange trunk and a compact weeping habit. It flowers profusely in summer although they are small, and maybe its best time to show off is in autumn with orange-red foliage. Linnaeus named Stewartia in 1753 to honor John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, but due to a transcription error it came out as Stewartia...which sticks. S. monadelpha is a Japanese species known as Himeshara. The specific epithet is derived from Greek monosmeaning “one” and adelphos meaning “brother,” referring to the stamens being united.\n\nPendula is the plural of pendulum, so it's odd that it was ever used for a singular cultivar, and I'm glad that it is now outlawed by the nomenclature police. Besides, we sound like snobs when we use these old Latin names for plants.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nHorticolor Red\n\nRosa 'Red Drift'\n\nRoses are red my love, violets are blue...\n\nColor is an important component of horticulture, and often we find appealing that which is not normal. Red maples outsell the green ones and blue spruces outsell the green, for example, even though nature preponders in the opposite direction. We marvel at red sunrises, not at the normal dull-white ones, and we all prefer a piercing cerulean sky over one that is gray. I'm sure that our brain agitates at different levels when we confront the various colors, and I suspect that is also true for all fauna on this earth. I am not a scientist of anything, but if I was...I would want to be an expert on how the colors in nature are able to influence our emotions, energy and well-being.\n\nAcer rufinerve 'Erythrocladum'\n\nOne must be careful with red, whether in the garden or elsewhere, and I suppose that's because red is the color of blood and/or excitement. Red is also the color of stop, whether at a red light on the road or at the moral-stopat the temptation to enter into a red-light district. Red-Zoneequals danger, although many like to window-shop in that area. The devil is colored red, isn't he? It is believed the first word to describe the color was the Proto-Indo-European word reudh. It traveled from there to ancient Indian Sanskrit and Proto-Germanic, while in Greece the word became erythros. Acer rufinerve 'Erythrocladum' features red stems, most prominently in winter. Not only that, but the specific name rufinerve is derived from Latin rufus meaning “russet red,” and that due to the color of the hair on the leaves. Not surprisingly the common name of Acer rufinerve is “red-vein maple.”\n\nAcer palmatum 'Ever Red'\n\nWe have two plants with the cultivar name 'Ever Red', one is an Acer palmatum and the other is a Rhododendron hybrid. The maple was a mainstay when I began my career, and you could buy a one-year graft from me for only $2.50. We grew hundreds of them every year at the beginning, but it is no longer in our production because it has been surpassed by 'Red Dragon', 'Tamuke yama' and others because they keep their red color better in hot summers. Was it a coincidence that Gregory/Vertrees in their latest, 4th edition of Japanese Maples no longer lists 'Ever Red' because I don't grow it anymore, when it was included in the 1st 1978 edition? Vertrees commented that it could be distinguished by the silvery pubescens on early spring leaves compared to other cultivars. Later the color disappears and the leaves are purple-red throughout spring, but it doesn't hold its red color as well as another cultivar, 'Crimson Queen' (which was relatively new at the time). Maybe not in the Vertrees garden, but I know of a dry-land (no irrigation) maple grower (Schmidt) in Oregon who finds the opposite to be true, that 'Ever Red' actually out reds 'Crimson Queen' in his fields by August.\n\nRhododendron 'Ever Red'\n\nRhododendron 'Ever Red'\n\nRhododendron 'Ever Red' is a new plant that I first encountered at the 'Rhododendron Species Botanical Garden' in Washington state. It flowers with blood-red bells, and one of my grafted plants from two years ago is now blooming in the greenhouse. Generally I can get a Rhododendron to bloom more quickly from a graft than from one grown on its own roots. Anyway I consider 'Ever Red' to be more of a foliage plant versus a flowerplant because the leaves display shiny reddish-purple leaves, and are so red that the blossoms are somewhat lost in the foliage. Besides it is evergreen so you can enjoy the plant's reddish color even in winter. Rhododendron breeders have long been trying to achieve colored foliage, and the breakthrough came from Ken Cox of Glendoick Nursery in Perthshire, Scotland. The 'Ever Red' name has also been used for a Loropetalum cultivar, and who knows what else, so I would suggest that we “ever red” nothing more.\n\nAcer palmatum 'Red Whisper'\n\nFor a species that is normally green we have a preponderance of Acer palmatum cultivars with “red” in the name. Let's see – 'Ever Red', 'Hefner's Red', 'Red Autumn Lace', 'Red Baron', 'Red Blush', 'Red Cloud', 'Red Crusader', 'Red Dragon', 'Red Emperor', 'Red Falcon', 'Red Filigree Lace', 'Red Flash', 'Red Pygmy', 'Red Saber', 'Red Sentinel', 'Red Shadow', 'Red Spider', 'Red Spray', 'Red Whisper', 'Red Wonder', 'Red Wood', 'Rhode Island Red', 'Ruth's Red', 'Select Red', 'Uncle Red', 'Wetumpka Red', 'Whitney Red', and 'Hubbs Red Willow'– and I'm guilty of naming a few of these myself. 'Red Whisper' is a Buchholz discovery, but I can't call it a Buchholz “introduction” because none have ever been sold or given away. It resembles 'Fairy Hair', but it never puts on enough growth to propagate, so like an old spinster it just sits in the corner of a greenhouse all by itself. Our website description reads: “A dwarf deciduous shrub with a stubby-branch form. Tiny hair-like spring leaves are orange-red. By summer they become bronze-orange, then orange-red in fall. Growth rate and hardiness unknown.” Actually, for growth rate it would be accurate to say, “not much.”\n\nAcer rubrum 'Vanity'\n\nAcer rubrum is known as the “red maple,” and it was so-named (by Linnaeus) because of its dependable red fall color. It is most noticeable in spring as well, for its red flowers appear before the leaves emerge. All winter I would drive past urban landscapes and pay no attention to dormant deciduous trees, not knowing or caring about their identity. Now, when in flower, I can see that many are Acer rubrum. I've never propagated any rubrum cultivars – with the exception of 'Vanity'– because they are produced cheaply by the thousands by large Oregon shade-tree nurseries. One nursery, which surely thought long and hard to proclaim on their catalog cover, “Trees are the Answer,” lists 14 different rubrum cultivars, not to mention their countless hybrids with rubrum. 'Vanity' is aptly named for it is a gaudy variegated selection, and it propagates easily by rooted cuttings or by grafting onto rubrum rootstock.\n\nAcer shirasawanum 'Shira Red'\n\nAcer shirasawanum 'Red Dawn'\n\nAcer shirasawanum 'Ruby Red'\n\nThe Acer shirasawanum species has a few “red” cultivars, like 'Red Dawn', 'Shira Red' and 'Ruby Red', with the former two likely being hybrids with palmatum and the latter probably being a full-blooded shirasawanum. The seed on 'Shira Red' rises above the foliage while it hangs down on 'Red Dawn', otherwise the two cultivars appear about the same. I have found the shirasawanum species to be a little more winter hardy than Acer palmatum, so even if some of these three cultivars are hybrids, they are probably a little more tough than straight palmatum.\n\nAgapetes 'Red Elf'\n\nAgapetes 'Red Elf' is a fun plant, but I keep it in my warm house because it is hardy to only USDA zone 9 – or so say the experts. We've experienced heater failure in that house before, but my 'Red Elf' survived while other plants perished, so I question the zone 9 report. I was trekking in the eastern Himalayan foothills 25 years ago, and suddenly the trail was strewn with pretty red flowers. I supposed that the women and children from the upcoming village had decorated the path in my honor and as a sign of welcome. But no, because when I looked up I could see Agapetes hanging epiphytically from tree branches above. I'm not an Agapetes expert so I don't know the species I encountered, nor do I know the parent species of 'Red Elf', my start coming from far away in a Tasmanian nursery. For what it's worth, Far Reaches Farm in Washington state also offers 'Red Elf', and they claim that the species is hosseana. If true, then it is commonly known as the “Thai huckleberry” (Saphaolom), and yes, the berries are sweet and edible. The Agapetes name is from Greek agapetos for “beloved.”\n\nEdgeworthia 'Red Dragon'\n\nEdgeworthia is in the Thymelaeaceae family and it is related to daphne. It is native to the Himalaya and China and it is famous for early blooming, usually with yellow flowers that are nicely fragrant. Happily there is a cultivar known as 'Red Dragon' with orange-red blooms, but it is variously listed as species papyrifera and species chrysantha, with Hillier in his Manual of Trees and Shrubs going with the latter. If true, it is commonly known as the “Oriental paperbush” (Mitsumata). The bark is used for making traditional Japanese paper known as washi, and also for Japanese banknotes because the paper is durable. Confusion exists whether or not chrysanthaand papyrifera are one and the same, but if they are then chrysantha should be used as it was first used in the 1800's. It was Carl Daniel Friedrich Meissner (1800-1874), a Swiss botanist who coined the name, and the epithet honors Michael Edgeworth (1812-1881), an amateur botanist from Ireland. Chrysantha is derived from Greek chrusos for “golden” and anthosmeaning “flower.”\n\nEnkianthus campanulatus 'Princeton Red'\n\nWe grow a number of Enkianthus campanulatus cultivars that were selected for their red flowers, and frankly there's enough of them unless you can introduce something really different. 'Miyamabeni' is one (beni = “red” in Japanese) and 'Akatsuki' is another (aka is also red in Japanese); then there's also 'Hollandia Red' and 'Princeton Red'. I don't know of a common name* for the genus, but its generic name comes from Greek enkyos meaning “pregnant” due to the bulging base of the flower and anthos meaning “flower” The specific epithet campanulatus is Latin meaning “bell-shaped.” We don't propagate Enkianthus any more due to weak sales, but nevertheless it is an excellent garden shrub with superb autumn color, and I have old specimens scattered throughout the gardens.\n\n*The Japanese species is called “Redvein Enkianthus” due to the red striping on the flowers.\n\nLeucadendron 'Sylvan Red'\n\nI like to write about plants that I have seen, even though I have never grown them, and then once in awhile I'll make an attempt to acquire one. Such is the case for Leucadendron 'Sylvan Red' which I encountered at the botanic garden in Santa Cruz, California. The genus is in the Proteaceae family from South Africa, so naturally I would have to protect it in a greenhouse in winter. The hybrid of L. laureolum x L. salignum is a medium-sized shrub with dark green leaves tinged with red and red stems. The scarlet-red cone flowers appear in winter and spring since it's a southern hemisphere native, and they must make great cut flowers because I sometimes see them in the floral department at the specialty (high-priced) grocery stores. When you have a nursery full of “Plants from the Best Corners of the World” you invariably find yourself collecting non-hardy species for fun, the result of which is that you are squandering away your retirement.\n\nMagnolia x 'Red Baron'\n\nMagnolia x'Red Baron' is a tree that we propagate and the sales of it provide me with the money to waste on Leucadendron-type stuff. 'Red Baron' was bred by Dennis Ledvina of Wisconsin, and he is the one who gave me my start. It is blooming now in the Flora Wonder Arboretum, and it's fun to place a partially open flower in a glass vase with a small top. The blossom should float on a little water and then it will open fully. Visitors to the house are always puzzled, “Hey, how did you get that big flower into the small opening?” One reason 'Red Baron' is popular is its good red color, plus it is hardy to -20 degrees, USDA zone 5. Its parents are M. acuminata x M. 'Big Dude'. Hats off to Magnolia breeders because it takes a lot of patience to see if you have bred something worthwhile, and of course a lot of space.\n\nPinus densiflora\n\nPinus resinosa\n\nPines are grouped into “colors,” so we have white-pine species such as P. parviflora, black pine such as Pinus thunbergii, and red pines such as P. densiflora and P. resinosa. Basically it is the trunk color that is being described, or on older trees the upper branches. P. densiflora is well-represented in horticulture, and at the beginning of my career I sold tons of 'Tanyosho', but I don't produce many P. densiflora cultivars anymore. Pinus resinosa is a northeastern USA species with needles that look similar to Pinus nigra, the “Austrian Pine.” It is rarely encountered in horticulture because even the so-called dwarves actually get large and turn into ugly green blobs. I wouldn't mind acquiring the golden tree shown above, but the photo was taken elsewhere and I can't remember where I was.\n\nRosa 'Drop Dead Red'\n\nI'm not really a rose guy although I do have a few species in the Flora Wonder Arboretum. If I want to see roses I can easily go to Portland's famous International Rose Test Garden where there are thousands of hybrids. If nothing else you can chuckle at the goofy names that roses seem to acquire, like 'Drop Dead Red'. I frequently give flowers to women, well...like my wife and two daughters now, but I have never given roses, not ever in my life. According to fossil evidence the rose is 35 million years old, with about 150 species spread throughout the Northern Hemisphere from Alaska to Mexico, as well as in Asia and northern Africa. It is thought that garden cultivation began 5,000 years ago in China. Eventually the rose came to England, and in the 15thcentury it was a symbol of the factions fighting for control – the white rose was for York and the red was for Lancaster – and the conflict was “The War of the Roses.” I forget who came out smelling like a rose.\n\nPulsatilla vulgaris 'Rubra'\n\nPulsatilla vulgaris 'Red Clock'\n\nWe don't sell Pulsatilla, but we have a couple of red-flowered forms, 'Rubra' and 'Red Clock', and they'll be blooming soon in the garden. The specific epithet is vulgariswhich is Latin for common, and it is found throughout Europe and southwestern Asia. It is a low-growing perennial and the anemone-like flowers are open bell-shaped. It is commonly known as the Pasque flower which comes from Old French for Easter, the time it usually blooms. It has also been called “Dane's blood,” which is probably not politically correct to say today. The generic name is from Latin pulsatus meaning “beaten about,” describing the swaying flowers in the wind.\n\nI have read that Pulsatilla cures a wide range of maladies, but I don't know of anyone who uses it. One company brags about the benefits, and the type of person who should use it:\n\n“Weeps easily. Timid, irresolute. Fears in evening to be alone, dark, ghosts. Likes sympathy. Children like fuss and caresses. Easily discouraged. Morbid dread of the opposite sex. Religious melancholy. Given to extremes of pleasure and pain. Highly emotional. Mentally, an April day.”\n\nWow! I used to date a girl like that.\n\nThere, you have red my blog.\n\n↧\n\nSpecific Epithets\n\nMagnolia grandiflora\n\nPinguicula grandiflora\n\nThe specific epithets used in botany are sometimes very obvious, like grandis for the “very large” Abies grandis, or grandiflora for “large-flowered,” as in Magnolia grandiflora. Of course “size is relative,” says my uncle, because Pinguicula grandiflora's flower is less than two inches wide-- but that's big compared to other Pinguicula species. We grow Pinguicula grandiflora in our carnivorous trough with Sarracenias and Dionaea (Venus flytrap) and they are all very interesting when you consider how they feed themselves. Pinguicula are commonly known as “butterworts,” and the genus consists of about 80 known species from North America, South America, Europe and Asia. The generic name comes from Latin pinguis for “fat” due to the sticky glistening leaves that traps small flies. The wet appearance helps to lure prey in search of water but it actually contains digestive enzymes so watch out!\n\nRibes sanguineum 'Pulboro Scarlet'\n\nCornus sanguinea 'Midwinter Fire'\n\nSarcodes sanguinea\n\nFlora\n\nThere are various shades of the color red, and in the Japanese language aka and beniare two differentsanguinea or sanguineum refers to “blood-red” which is obvious when you see Ribes sanguineum in flower, as it is in our gardens at this time. Cornus sanguineum is noted for red stems in winter, but now at the end of March the fire has toned down. One of my favorite plants of all is Sarcodes sanguinea, commonly called the “snow plant” because it appears just after the snow melts. I didn't know it even existed until I stumbled upon one while hiking in the southern Oregon mountains, then later in California at the higher elevations at Yosemite. The lurid-red color is startling on the monotypic genus, surprisingly in the Ericaceae family. It is a parasitic plant, and it lacks chlorophyll and is unable to photosynthesize, deriving its nutrients from mycorrhizal fungi that are attached to the roots of trees. Sarcodes is shockingly phallic in appearance, and if you ever see one in person you'll know that the goddess Flora* has a wild side.\n\nkinds. The specific name of\n\n*Flora's name comes from Latin flosfor “flower.”\n\nCornus florida 'Unryu'\n\nIllicium floridanum 'Halley's Comet'\n\nWeigela florida 'Rubidor'\n\nAlexander von Bunge\n\nPonce de Leon\n\nYou might assume that Linnaeus coined the specific name of Cornus florida because it is native to that state, but remember that Florida* state didn't even exist at that time. He named the species for its prolific flowering, which many consider to be America's most beautiful flowering tree. Coincidentally C. florida does occur in Florida, and actually all the way from Maine down to northern Mexico on the East Coast. A plant that was named for being native to Florida is Illicium floridanum, the “Florida anise,” or “stinking laurel.” It is a medium-sized evergreen shrub that is somewhat boring in appearance, that is until it produces its delightful flowers in May and June. Weigela florida has nothing to do with Florida state, but rather for abundant flowering. It is a shrub from northern China and was named by the Russian-German botanist Alexander von Bunge (of Pinus bungeana fame). The generic name honors Christian E. Weigel (1748-1831), a German physician and botanist.\n\n*Florida was named by Ponce de Leon on April 2, 1513, the first European to record its location, although he assumed it to be a large island. He called it “La Florida” (flowery land) referring to the Easter season, known in Spanish as Pascua Florida.\n\nAbies amabilis 'Spreading Star'\n\nPseudolarix amabilis\n\nThe specific name amabilis is used for a “beautiful” plant, as in Kolkwitzia amabilis, the “Beauty bush.” Less lovely is the generic name which honors Richard Kolkwitz, a professor of botany in Berlin. The shrub was introduced by Englishman E.H. Wilson during his initial expedition (1901) in China, so I don't know why botanist Karl Otto Robert Peter Paul Graebner (1871-1933) got to be involved in the naming of it. Plant explorer David Douglas was impressed enough with the beauty of the “Pacific silver fir” that he named it Abies amabilis. The needles of Abies grandis smells like tangerines when crushed, while A. amabilis is more like oranges – and that's one way to have fun with kids. Probably my favorite plant with the amabilis epithet is Pseudolarix amabilis, certainly more beautiful to me than the ugly larix (“larch”) genus. It was introduced into Europe by Robert Fortune in (1852) while the English cad was sent to China to steal tea plants (Camellia sinensis) and tea-harvesting techniques. The luxurious green needles of Pseudolarix give way to golden-orange in autumn, but I am most impressed with the one-year artichoke-like cones of the species. I used to offer Pseudolarix for sale but surprisingly there was limited interest in it, and now I must be content with my one specimen in the Flora Wonder Arboretum.\n\nAbies spectabilis\n\nScottish botanist David Don (1799-1841) named and described a number of conifers that were introduced in his lifetime including Taxodium sempervirens (now Sequoia sempervirens), Pinus bracteata (now Abies bracteata), Pinus spectabilis (now Abies spectabilis) and others. I have seen A. spectabilis in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal, and those deformed specimens were far from “spectacular,” so maybe Don named the species for its beautiful cones. I grew it for awhile at the beginning of my career, my start coming from the wonderful Otto Solburger conifer arboretum just a half hour drive from my nursery. In the Hillier Manual of Trees and Shrubs (2014) it mentions “Unfortunately, this striking species is susceptible to spring frosts.” Before that phrase it was called a “magnificent, large tree.” Hmm...Hillier claims it is native to Nepal, India (Sikkim) and Bhutan while Rushforth in Conifers says “from Nepal west to the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan; it also occurs in the Chumbi Valley in Tibet.” So, are we talking about the same species? Anyway it never sold very well for me, probably because it is hardy to only -10 degrees. I was content to keep one last tree in my Conifer Field, but after an unusually wet spring my 20-year-old specimen turned brown when we hit the mid-90's in June.\n\nRhododendron maximum\n\nAsarum maximum 'Ling Ling'\n\nAsarum maximum 'Ling Ling'\n\nHeracleum maximum\n\nMaxima or maximum means “largest” and the specific name for the eastern North America species Rhododendron maximum was bestowed by Linnaeus. It is a large shrub or small tree with long, narrow leaves, but it is certainly not the largest-growing Rhododendron, nor the species with the largest leaves. Asarum maximum is the “Panda Face Wild ginger,” a Chinese species that prefers a shady woodland site. The cultivar 'Ling Ling' forms a clump of large, glossy heart-shaped leaves with a subtle variegation. Another maximum is Heracleum maximum, the “common cow parsnip.” I've always considered it to be a weed, but still it is impressive growing up to 7' tall, and not surprisingly its genus name is derived from Hercules. Its flower umbels are a dull white and Native Americans would rub them on their bodies to repel flies and mosquitos.\n\nLindera umbellata\n\nWhile Heracleum maximum is in the carrot family (Apiaceae) with its umbel-formed flowers, Lindera umbellata (in the Lauraceae family) blooms with small yellow flowers on short umbels, but they are not showy, especially when compared with those of Lindera obtusiloba. L. umbellata is native to Japan and China and it was Carl Peter Thunberg who first described it. In Oregon it performs spectacularly in autumn when the leaves turn to yellow, orange and purple, then they persist throughout winter with a light brown color that is still attractive. Known as kuromojiin Japanese, oils from the species have been shown to fight tumors, and it has long been used in Japan as a traditional medicine. The Lindera genus is known as “spicebush” because of the aromatic components in its twigs and leaves, and its name honors the Swedish botanist Johan Linder (1676-1724).\n\nAloe speciosa\n\nSpeciosa (“showy”) is an uninspired specific epithet but there is a large number of plants so named. Aloe speciosa is the “Tilt-head Aloe,” a single-stemmed succulent from South Africa that carries its leaf-head off to one side. The “showy” name was given by John Gilbert Baker when he described it in the 1880's, and he was referring to the beautiful reddish flowers. The aloe name is of uncertain origin, but it was used in ancient Greece and was possibly chosen for sound-resemblance to Hebrew akhalim.\n\nBanksia speciosa\n\nBanksia speciosa is commonly known as the “Showy Banksia,” a large shrub or small tree in the Proteaceae family. The flowers attract nectar – and insect – feeding birds, in particular the “honey eaters.” These birds, from Australia and New Guinea, do more than just eat nectar, for they are also fertilizing many plants. They are not able to hover over a flower like American hummingbirds, but instead they often feed by hanging on from beneath the flower.\n\nCatalpa speciosa\n\nCatalpa speciosa is the “Northern catalpa,” a large deciduous tree from a small area in the Midwest USA. Bell-shaped white flowers feature purple and yellow inner spotting, then long green seedpods develop that can be up to 2' long. The generic name comes from a North American Indian name, but due to a transcription error it should have been Catawba.\n\nPleione speciosa\n\nI suppose the most showy of the “speciosas” is Pleione speciosa, a bulb which blooms purple-pink with yellow in the throat. The Pleione genus was named for the mother of the Pleiades in Greek mythology by David Don of conifer-naming fame. We are growing a fair number of Pleione cultivars now, with our starts of many coming from Canada or England, but companies in those countries are no longer shipping to the USA so we are happy to have acquired them when we did. I am not an expert on the taxonomy of Pleione (pronounced ply o nee) and even if I was there would be another expert who would disagree with my conclusions. Best to just stay dumb and just enjoy them.\n\nPhotinia villosa\n\nThermopsis villosa\n\nBotanists love plant hairs so we have specific names like villosa for “softly hairy,” tomentosafor “hairy” and mollis for soft and/or hairy. Photinia villosa is a large shrub or small tree from Japan, Korean and China, and it was introduced by Phillip von Siebold in 1865. P. villosa var. laevis is another form, with laevis meaning “smooth.” Another villosa is Thermopsis, commonly called the Carolina lupine. It can reach 5' in height with erect yellow spikes. It is its seed pods which are villous with long hairs.\n\nPopulus tomentosa\n\nPopulus tomentosa is a large Chinese species with light hairs beneath the large, dark-green leaves. It is known as mao bai yang in Chinese and it is planted along streets as an ornamental, and since the Chinese love to smoke its wood is also used to produce matches. I don't smoke, but I think the species is worth growing for its interesting marked bark.\n\nHamamelis mollis 'Westerstede'\n\nHamamelis mollis 'Boskoop'\n\nCharles Maries\n\nThe only mollis species I grow is for the Hamamelis genus which is the “Chinese witch hazel.” It forms a large shrub with slightly hairy, round green leaves. I only know of cultivars that flower yellow, but the golden autumn foliage rivals the winter blooms anyway. Give plenty of space in the garden as it can grow just as wide as tall. H. mollis was introduced into England by British plant explorer Charles Maries in 1879 and described by botanist Daniel Oliver (1830-1916). H. mollis, along with H. japonica, are the parents of H. x intermedia, a hybrid of garden origin that has resulted in many excellent cultivars.\n\nClematis recta 'Purpurea Select'\n\nRhododendron forrestii var. repens\n\nThe specific name recta is used for “upright” plants, but Clematis recta will grow along the ground if not trained to climb. The white flower is fragrant, and is especially noticeable with the cultivar 'Purpurea Select', which is unfortunately an invalid name. Repens describes plants that creep along the ground, as does Mahonia repens, compared to other species of Mahonia. Repens was commonly used as a cultivar or varietal name years ago, thus we have Rhododendron forrestii var. repens or Repens Group. The species name forrestiihonors the Scottish plant explorer George Forrest who discovered it in 1905, and then it was introduced by him in 1914. What is remarkable for the tiny creeper with small glossy-green leaves are the relatively large blood-red bell-shaped flowers. My oldest specimen went through hell when I left it in full sun in its display box when we had a few days of over 100 degrees, and it took two full years to recover from its ordeal. Protective Services probably should have taken it away from me for my neglect and never allowed me to grow it again.\n\nAralia elata 'Aureovariegata'\n\nAralia elata 'Variegata'\n\nElata is a specific name for “tall” and we grow Aralia elata 'Aureovariegata', a large shrub or small tree from Japan. The large pinnate green leaves are splashed with yellow and panicles of white flowers appear in late summer. Not to be confused with 'Variegata' where the green leaves are variegated with cream-white. Both cultivars are grafted onto A. elata rootstock which is known to sucker, so you don't want to plant it into an intimate garden site. Mine are growing at the backside of our pond – along with some bamboo, and I go back there only once or twice a year because of the wildness of the area. Another reason they are planted far away is because I don't really like either of them, they're not my kind of plant, and they remind me of another plant I don't grow or care for: Trachycarpus fortunei, the “Chinese windmill pond.” The variegated “angelica trees” look like women past their prime who try to compensate for it with too much makeup and flamboyant clothes. I know, probably I'll be criticized for that opinion.\n\nOxydendrum arboreum 'Chameleon'\n\nArborescens and arboreummean tree-like, from Latin for “tree” or “shaft,” and there are a lot of plant names that are “tree-like,” or at least they are...compared to other members in their generic group. Oxydendrum arboreum is an excellent garden tree and it won an Award of Merit for its flowers which appear in late summer. When I acquired my first tree I was certain that the generic name was misspelled – certainly it must be Oxydendron, but wrong. I don't know what came over Linnaeus the day he named it, but the word comes from Greek oxysmeaning “acid” and dendron for “tree.” That's only why it is commonly called “sourwood,” due to the sour taste of the leaves. If you examine the flowers in their drooping racemes they remind me of Pieris, and indeed Oxydendrum is in the Ericaceae family.\n\nCrassula arborescens\n\nCrassula is a genus of about 300 species of annuals, perennials and evergreen shrubs, usually with succulent leaves. They are too tender to grow in Oregon, other than as a house plant which I have done. C. arborescens is so-named because it can grow up to 10' compared to the other species which are much lower. It is commonly known as the “Silver Jade plant” or “Silver Dollar plant” due to the color and round shape of the leaves. The common “Jade plant” that people grow indoors – at least in America – is Crassula ovata, and it is nicknamed the “Friendship tree.” Both species are from South Africa.\n\nAcanthus spinosus\n\nAcanthus spinosus was specifically named due to the spiny foliage, and when it is not in flower you might think it's just a weed. I've had one in the garden for at least 20 years, and it has spread a little, but not aggressively. No one seems to know for certain why the common name is “bear's breeches,” but the generic name is from Greek acanthameaning “thorn;” the redundancy of the generic and specific name is because some species of Acanthus are not spiny (like A. molliswith its “soft hairs”).\n\nMahonia aquifolium\n\nAquifolium or aquifolius also refers to spiny leaves, and an example is Mahonia aquifolium. I like to quiz plant people about the aquifolium name when we are standing next to a Mahonia, and most assume that it's because of its glossy glistening foliage, as in aquatic or aquarium. But aquilais Latin for “eagle,” and the barb on the Mahonia resembles that of an eagle's beak.\n\nThis blog was prompted when I recently read one sentence in the back of Hillier's Manual of Trees and Shrubs (2014): “The study of botanical plant names is fascinating and rewarding.” And as I've said before, if you don't agree then it was the fault of my presentation rather than the subject matter. Anyway I had fun and learned a few things.\n\n↧\n\nTo Tell the Truth\n\nI believe in telling the truth...\n\nUnless there's a better version.\n\nToday's blog will not happen. It has been written and the photos chosen, but Seth has no time to put it together. Shipping plants has the entire nursery hopping and I don't want Seth to snarl at me like last year: \"Do you want to make money, or do you want your damn blog published?!\"\n\nSo instead we'll do a re-run of a past year's photo contest. Maybe you need a break from me too.\n\nRosa 'Love & Peace'\n\nAcer palmatum 'Yellow Threads'\n\nCamellia japonica 'Kujaku tsubaki'\n\nDarmera peltata\n\nAcer palmatum 'Ariadne'\n\nPodophyllum 'Galaxy'\n\nAcer shirasawanum 'Bronze Age'\n\nRhododendron faithiae\n\nAbies firma 'Nana Horizontalis'\n\nAcer pictum 'Usu gumo'\n\nHelleborus hybridus '#106'\n\nMagnolia denudata\n\nAcer macrophyllum 'Mocha Rose'\n\nPinus koraiensis 'Jack Korbit'\n\nAcer palmatum 'Mikawa nishiki'\n\nSciadopitys verticillata\n\nAcer palmatum 'Mayday'\n\nCornus florida 'Unryu'\n\nAcer forrestii\n\nAgapetes lacei\n\nAcer palmatum 'Rainbow'\n\nFagus sylvatica\n\nAcer palmatum 'Peve Multicolor'\n\nMagnolia 'Yellow Bird'\n\nDisanthus cercidifolius 'Ena nishiki'\n\nAcer macrophyllum 'Mieke'\n\nCathaya argyrophylla\n\nAcer palmatum 'Strawberry Spring'\n\nCatalpa bignonioides 'Aurea'\n\nGaultheria pseudonotabilis\n\nAcer pauciflorum\n\nPseudotsuga sinensis\n\nAcer circinatum 'Monroe'\n\nMagnolia 'Eric Savill'\n\nAcer palmatum 'Hama otome'\n\nEmbothrium coccineum 'Inca Flame'\n\nArbutus menziesii\n\nAcer palmatum 'Spring Plum'\n\nCornus alternifolia 'Golden Shadows'\n\nAbies concolor 'Wintergold'\n\nAndrosace sempervivoides 'Susan Joan'\n\nAcer palmatum 'Green Tea'\n\nGinkgo biloba 'Snow Cloud'\n\nSassafras tsumu\n\nArisaema sikokianum\n\nPinus thunbergii\n\nEpimedium grandiflorum var. higoense 'Bandit'\n\nAcer japonicum 'Taki no gawa'\n\nRhododendron griffithianum\n\nAgapetes 'Red Elf'\n\nCunninghamia lanceolata 'Glauca'\n\nPaeonia mlotskewitchii\n\nAcer palmatum 'Jubilee'\n\nRhododendron thomsonii\n\nWollemia nobilis\n\nAbies concolor 'Candicans'\n\nCornus controversa 'June Snow'\n\nRhododendron falconeri ssp. eximium\n\nMagnolia 'Vulcan'\n\n↧\n\nCheer Up!\n\nOnce again Buchholz Nursery is swamped with shipping, and Seth has no time to process the new blog.

I spent one Christmas in hot Lima, Peru, walking the streets and sweating, occasionally stopping at cafes to imbibe Inca Cola. For plant people in the Northern Hemisphere \"winter\" has a different definition than any scientific explanation. For us, winter is the time when our plants can be damaged or die. In Oregon that is usually from November 15 to the end of February, but disasters can occur at any time of course.\n\nSo here we are…at the winter solstice, which is as low as one can ge"
