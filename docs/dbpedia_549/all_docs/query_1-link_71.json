Bud hardiness was determined biweekly by differential thermal analysis (DTA). Stage and percentage of bloom open during the bloom period were subjectively estimated.Spraying trees with 100ppm Ethrel at 50% leaf fall significantly increased bud hardiness at mid-winter compared to other treatments. After a mid-winter freeze (-21.7 C on 12/21/89), there was no significant difference between % bud survival of any treatments. But, trees treated with 50 or 100ppm Ethrel had 10-20% better bud survival than other treatments. Buds of the 2 cultivars had statistically similar hardiness although DTA analysis indicated that Redhaven had a .5-.8 C lower freezing point than Allgold in mid winter. This trend was reversed close to bloom with Allgold having .7 C lower freezing point than Redhaven. The time of full bloom was..."
