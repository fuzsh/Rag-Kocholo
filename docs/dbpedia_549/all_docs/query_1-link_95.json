        "text": "Advertisements\n\nScientific Name\n\nWisteria frutescens (L.) Poir.\n\nCommon Name(s)\n\nAmerican Wisteria, Texas Wisteria, Kentucky Wisteria\n\nSynonym(s)\n\nGlycine frutescens, Bradlea macrostachya, Kraunhia frutescens, Kraunhia macrostachya, Kraunhia macrostachys, Wisteria macrostachya\n\nScientific Classification\n\nFamily: FabaceaeSubfamily: Faboideae\n\nTribe: Millettieae\n\nGenus: Wisteria\n\nFlower\n\nColor: Blue-purple\n\nBloom Time: Late spring to early summer\n\nDescription\n\nWisteria frutescens is a woody deciduous perennial climbing vine that grows up to 50 feet (15 m) long over many supports via strong, clockwise-twining stems. It produces dense clusters of blue-purple, two-lipped, up to 0.8 inches (2 cm) wide flowers on up to 6 inches (15 cm) long racemes from late spring to early summer. These are the smallest racemes produced by any Wisteria. The foliage consists of shiny dark green, pinnately compound, and up to 12 inches (30 cm) long leaves. The leaves bear 9 to 15 oblong leaflets, each up to 2.4 inches (6 cm) long.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nHardiness\n\nUSDA hardiness zone 6a to 9b: from −10 °F (−23.3 °C) to 30 °F (−1.1 °C).\n\nHow to Grow and Care\n\nThe most important factor to consider when growing Wisteria is location. Wisteria is a twining vine that requires sturdy support and regular pruning to keep it under control. Open areas surrounded by lawns that can be easily mowed are ideal for growing Wisteria.\n\nWisteria doesn't fair well in the cold, so make sure it receives plenty of sunlight. This vine requires deep, rich soil that is somewhat moist but will tolerate many soil conditions.\n\nOnce planted, pruning is the only important requirement for Wisteria vine care. Since this vine is an aggressive grower, there's no need for fertilizing, and being drought tolerant, Wisteria requires little watering.\n\nWhile Wisteria is great for covering an arbor or pergola, training Wisteria vines makes it easier to control. However, keep in mind that when training Wisteria vines, the variety may exhibit different twining characteristics. For example, Chinese Wisteria (Wisteria sinensis) twines counterclockwise while the Japanese type (Wisteria floribunda) is the opposite, twining clockwise.\n\nSee more at: How to Grow and Care for Wisteria.\n\nOrigin\n\nThis species is native to the wet forests and stream banks of the southeastern United States, with a range stretching from Virginia to Texas and extending southeast through Florida and north to Iowa, Michigan, and New York.\n\nLinks\n\nBack to genus Wisteria\n\nPlantpedia: Browse flowering plants by Scientific Name, Common Name, Genus, Family, USDA Hardiness Zone, or Origin\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nClick on a photo to see a larger version."
