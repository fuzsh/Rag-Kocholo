The combined method was used to analyze 104 fetuses with heart malformations identified by ultrasonography. Abnormal findings were confirmed with chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). Nineteen (18%) fetuses were found to harbor chromosomal aberrations by G-banded karyotyping and MLPA. For 93 cases, CMA has detected abnormalities in 14 cases including 10 pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) and 4 CNVs of uncertain significance (VOUS). MLPA was able to detect all of the pathogenic CNVs and 1 VOUS CNV. Combined use of G-banded karyotyping and MLPA is a rapid, low-cost and effective method to detect chromosomal abnormalities in fetuses with various heart malformations.\n\nInteractive Karyotyping Training\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAshwin Kotwaliwale\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Despite the wide use of newer techniques in genetic diagnostics, there remains a need for technologists to learn human chromosome morphology, identify abnormal metaphases and report clinical abnormalities. Global short age of cytogenetic trainers and a time consuming training process makes Karyotyping training difficult. We have developed a web based interactive Karyotyping training tool, KaryoTutorÂ©, that allows technologists to learn karyotyping in an interactive environment and aids the trainer in the training process. KaryoTutorÂ©provides visual clues for identifying abnormal chromosomes, provides instant test scores and includes a reference library of ideograms,sample chromosome images and reference materials. Trainees are able to recursively work on a case till a satisfactory result is achieved,with KaryoTutor providing interactive inputs.Additionally, trainers can assign cases and monitor trainee progress using audit trail management and other administrative features.\n\nFetal karyotype: can we always trust its result?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCarolina Leite Drummond\n\n2008-09-01\n\nFull Text Available We retrospectively investigated six cases of discrepancy between prenatal fetal karyotype and postnatal findings. In five cases, the chromosomal abnormalities initially found by CVS or amniocentesis were not confirmed by later analyses and postnatal examination. In one case, the fetal karyotype found to be normal by CVS had to be checked due to sonographic features and clinical anomalies found after birth. In most cases, the normal development on sonographic examination raised the doubt about the abnormal fetal karyotype. Discrepant findings between fetal karyotype results and sonographic findings require great caution in their interpretation and counseling of parents. Placental confined mosaicism seems to be the most frequent cause of such discrepant results. The interpretation of fetal karyotype results should always be correlated with sonographic and clinical findings.\n\nCytogenetic abnormalities and their prognostic significance in idiopathic myelofibrosis: a study of 106 cases.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nReilly, J T; Snowden, J A; Spearing, R L; Fitzgerald, P M; Jones, N; Watmore, A; Potter, A\n\n1997-07-01\n\nThe prognostic significance of cytogenetic abnormalities was determined in 106 patients with well-characterized idiopathic myelofibrosis who were successfully karyotyped at diagnosis. 35% of the cases exhibited a clonal abnormality (37/106), whereas 65% (69/106) had a normal karyotype. Three characteristic defects, namely del(13q) (nine cases), del(20q) (eight cases) and partial trisomy 1q (seven cases), were present in 64.8% (24/37) of patients with clonal abnormalities. Kaplan-Meier plots and log rank analysis demonstrated an abnormal karyotype to be an adverse prognostic variable (P 10.3 x 10(9)/l; P=0.06) were also associated with a shorter survival. In contrast, sex, spleen and liver size, and percentage blast cells were not found to be significant. Multivariate analysis, using Cox's regression, revealed karyotype, haemoglobin concentration, platelet and leucocyte counts to retain their unfavourable prognostic significance. A simple and useful schema for predicting survival in idiopathic myelofibrosis has been produced by combining age, haemoglobin concentration and karyotype with median survival times varying from 180 months (good-risk group) to 16 months (poor-risk group).\n\nOneD: increasing reproducibility of Hi-C samples with abnormal karyotypes.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVidal, Enrique; le Dily, FranÃ§ois; Quilez, Javier; Stadhouders, Ralph; Cuartero, Yasmina; Graf, Thomas; Marti-Renom, Marc A; Beato, Miguel; Filion, Guillaume J\n\n2018-05-04\n\nThe three-dimensional conformation of genomes is an essential component of their biological activity. The advent of the Hi-C technology enabled an unprecedented progress in our understanding of genome structures. However, Hi-C is subject to systematic biases that can compromise downstream analyses. Several strategies have been proposed to remove those biases, but the issue of abnormal karyotypes received little attention. Many experiments are performed in cancer cell lines, which typically harbor large-scale copy number variations that create visible defects on the raw Hi-C maps. The consequences of these widespread artifacts on the normalized maps are mostly unexplored. We observed that current normalization methods are not robust to the presence of large-scale copy number variations, potentially obscuring biological differences and enhancing batch effects. To address this issue, we developed an alternative approach designed to take into account chromosomal abnormalities. The method, called OneD, increases reproducibility among replicates of Hi-C samples with abnormal karyotype, outperforming previous methods significantly. On normal karyotypes, OneD fared equally well as state-of-the-art methods, making it a safe choice for Hi-C normalization. OneD is fast and scales well in terms of computing resources for resolutions up to 5Â kb.\n\nSpectral Karyotyping for identification of constitutional chromosomal abnormalities at a national reference laboratory\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnguiano Arturo\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract Spectral karyotyping is a diagnostic tool that allows visualization of chromosomes in different colors using the FISH technology and a spectral imaging system. To assess the value of spectral karyotyping analysis for identifying constitutional supernumerary marker chromosomes or derivative chromosomes at a national reference laboratory, we reviewed the results of 179 consecutive clinical samples (31 prenatal and 148 postnatal submitted for spectral karyotyping. Over 90% of the cases were requested to identify either small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMCs or chromosomal exchange material detected by G-banded chromosome analysis. We also reviewed clinical indications of those cases with marker chromosomes in which chromosomal origin was identified by spectral karyotyping. Our results showed that spectral karyotyping identified the chromosomal origin of marker chromosomes or the source of derivative chromosomal material in 158 (88% of the 179 clinical cases; the identification rate was slightly higher for postnatal (89% compared to prenatal (84% cases. Cases in which the origin could not be identified had either a small marker chromosome present at a very low level of mosaicism (\n\nSecond-trimester IL-15 and IL-18 levels in the amniotic fluid of fetuses with normal karyotypes and with chromosome abnormalities.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKlimkiewicz-Blok, Dominika; FlorjaÅski, Jerzy; Zalewski, Jerzy; Blok, RadosÅaw\n\n2012-01-01\n\nLittle is known about the behavior of interleukin 15 (IL-15) and 18 (IL-18) in the amniotic fluid in the second trimester of gestations complicated by chromosomal defects in the fetus. Likewise, it has not yet been established whether a fetus with chromosome abnormalities creates its immunity mechanisms in the same way as a fetus with a normal karyotype. The aim of this work was to assess the concentration of IL-15 and IL-18 in the amniotic fluid in the second trimester of gestation in fetuses with normal karyotypes and with chromosome abnormalities. The material consisted of 51 samples of amniotic fluid obtained from genetic amniocenteses carried out between the 15th and the 19th weeks of gestation. On the basis of cytogenetic screening, two groups were singled out: Group I--45 fetuses with normal karyotypes, and Group II--6 fetuses with abnormal karyotypes. The concentrations of IL-15 and IL-18 in the amniotic fluid were assessed with ready-made assays and analyzed, and the results from both groups were compared. The differences between the IL-15 levels in the amniotic fluid from Groups I and II proved to be statistically insignificant (p = 0.054). However, the average IL-18 levels in the amniotic fluid of the fetuses with normal karyotypes were significantly higher than in the amniotic fluid of the fetuses with chromosome abnormalities (p = 0.032). Some defense mechanisms in the second trimester of gestation in fetuses with chromosome abnormalities may develop in a different way than in fetuses with normal karyotypes.\n\nAnomalias e prognÃ³stico fetal associados Ã translucÃªncia nucal aumentada e cariÃ³tipo anormal Fetal abnormalities and prognosis associated with increased nuchal translucency and abnormal karyotype\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFÃ¡tima Aparecida Targino Saldanha\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFull Text Available OBJETIVO: Descrever a frequÃªncia de anomalias cromossÃ´micas em fetos com translucÃªncia nucal (TN aumentada, e a frequÃªncia de malformaÃ§Ãµes estruturais, a evoluÃ§Ã£o e o resultado da gestaÃ§Ã£o nos fetos com TN aumentada e cariÃ³tipo anormal. MÃTODOS: Estudo retrospectivo envolvendo 246 casos com medida da TN acima do percentil 95Âº para a idade gestacional, com cariÃ³tipo fetal conhecido ou avaliaÃ§Ã£o clÃ­nica das crianÃ§as no perÃ­odo pÃ³s-natal. Os casos foram acompanhados no setor de Medicina Fetal do Hospital das ClÃ­nicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo. RESULTADOS: O resultado do cariÃ³tipo fetal esteve alterado em 14,2% dos casos. O acompanhamento dessas gestaÃ§Ãµes revelou anormalidade estruturais em 80,8% dos fetos, sendo as anormalidades cardÃ­acas as mais comuns (61,5%. Resultados gestacionais adversos, como abortamento, Ã³bitos intraÃºtero e neonatal ocorreram em 76,5% dos fetos. CONCLUSÃO: TranslucÃªncia nucal aumentada, entre 11 - 13 semanas e 6 dias, Ã© importante marcador de anomalias cromossÃ´micas fetais e malformaÃ§Ãµes estruturais fetais, principalmente cardÃ­acas. Diante deste achado, hÃ¡ aumento do risco de abortamento, Ã³bito intrauterino e neonatal para estas gestaÃ§Ãµes.OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency (NT measurement. Incidence of structural abnormalities and pregnancy outcome was also described in fetuses with increased NT and abnormal karyotype. METHODS: This was a retrospective study involving 246 fetuses with increased NT and known karyotype followed at the Fetal Medicine Unit, Hospital das ClÃ­nicas, SÃ£o Paulo University Medical School. RESULTS: Fetal karyotype was abnormal in 14.2% of the cases. Ultrasound anomaly scan and specialized echocardiographic studies in these cases showed fetal structural abnormalities in 80.8% and cardiac defects were found in 61.5% of the fetuses. Pregnancy\n\nIs routine karyotyping required in prenatal samples with a molecular or metabolic referral?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKooper Angelique JA\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract As a routine, karyotyping of invasive prenatal samples is performed as an adjunct to referrals for DNA mutation detection and metabolic testing. We performed a retrospective study on 500 samples to assess the diagnostic value of this procedure. These samples included 454 (90.8% chorionic villus (CV and 46 (9.2% amniocenteses specimens. For CV samples karyotyping was based on analyses of both short-term culture (STC and long-term culture (LTC cells. Overall, 19 (3.8% abnormal karyotypes were denoted: four with a common aneuploidy (trisomy 21, 18 and 13, two with a sex chromosomal aneuploidy (Klinefelter syndrome, one with a sex chromosome mosaicism and twelve with various autosome mosaicisms. In four cases a second invasive test was performed because of an abnormal finding in the STC. Taken together, we conclude that STC and LTC karyotyping has resulted in a diagnostic yield of 19 (3.8% abnormal cases, including 12 cases (2.4% with an uncertain significance. From a diagnostic point of view, it is desirable to limit uncertain test results as secondary test findings. Therefore, we recommend a more targeted assay, such as e.g. QF-PCR, as a replacement of the STC and to provide parents the autonomy to choose between karyotyping and QF-PCR.\n\nDown-Turner Syndrome: A Case with Double Monoclonal Chromosomal Abnormality\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGioconda Manassero-Morales\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Introduction.

Parikh\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Introduction: - The biological definition of miscarriage is the expulsion of the conceptus before viability has been achieved. The definition of recurrent miscarriage is three or more consecutive spontaneous abortions. The risk factors for recurrent miscarriage are epidemiological, genetic, anatomical disorders, endocrinal, reproductive tract infections, thrombophilic disorders, disorders of materno-fetal alloimmune relationships, environmental effects and psychological causes. About 50% to 60% of all first trimester abortions are associated with derangement of one or more chromosomal complements. Aim: - The aim of this study was to assess frequency and increasing the awareness of physician about the nature of chromosomal aberration that contribute to the occurrence of repeated abortions. Material & Methods: - Patient of recurrent abortion was investigated by history taking, examination and investigations. For present study 20 women having two or more consecutive spontaneous abortions, who attended outdoor & indoor patient department, were selected and karyotyping was done. In 10 of the above cases karyotype study of both partners was done. So in total 30 individuals (20 females & 10 males were selected for Cytogenetic study. In all cases relevant history and clinical findings and other investigations were noted. Blood samples were obtained and karyotype study was performed at Genetic Laboratory, B. J. Medical College, Ahmedabad. Results and Conclusions: - Cytogenetic evaluation by karyotypes revealed robertsonian translocation in one (5% female; this patient had a history of 2 spontaneous abortions and two times IVF failure, she had history of chocolate cyst of ovary and family history of infertility. No numerical anomaly; mosaicism or inversions were found in this study; 23 cases had normal karyotype and remaining 6 cases came out inconclusive.\n\nCongenital heart disease and chromossomopathies detected by the karyotype\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPatrÃ­cia Trevisan\n\n2014-06-01\n\nFull Text Available OBJECTIVE: To review the relationship between congenital heart defects and chromosomal abnormalities detected by the karyotype.DATA SOURCES: Scientific articles were searched in MEDLINE database, using the descriptors \"karyotype\" OR \"chromosomal\" OR \"chromosome\" AND \"heart defects, congenital\". The research was limited to articles published in English from 1980 on.DATA SYNTHESIS: Congenital heart disease is characterized by an etiologically heterogeneous and not well understood group of lesions. Several researchers have evaluated the presence of chromosomal abnormalities detected by the karyotype in patients with congenital heart disease. However, most of the articles were retrospective studies developed in Europe and only some of the studied patients had a karyotype exam. In this review, only one study was conducted in Latin America, in Brazil. It is known that chromosomal abnormalities are frequent, being present in about one in every ten patients with congenital heart disease. Among the karyotype alterations in these patients, the most important is the trisomy 21 (Down syndrome. These patients often have associated extra-cardiac malformations, with a higher risk of morbidity and mortality, which makes heart surgery even more risky.CONCLUSIONS: Despite all the progress made in recent decades in the field of cytogenetic, the karyotype remains an essential tool in order to evaluate patients with congenital heart disease. The detailed dysmorphological physical examination is of great importance to indicate the need of a karyotype.\n\nCongenital heart disease and chromossomopathies detected by the karyotype\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTrevisan, PatrÃ­cia; Rosa, Rafael Fabiano M.; Koshiyama, Dayane Bohn; Zen, Tatiana Diehl; Paskulin, Giorgio Adriano; Zen, Paulo Ricardo G.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE: To review the relationship between congenital heart defects and chromosomal abnormalities detected by the karyotype.

To date, five cases have been previously reported, all of them diagnosed beyond the postnatal period, and only one was molecularly characterized. We describe the first case of this unusual association diagnosed in the neonatal period, the clinical findings and the molecular studies undertaken. Case presentation The boy was born at term with clinical and radiological features indicating the diagnosis of achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia combined with the prenatal karyotype of Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY. Neonatal FGFR3 mutation screening showed that the newborn was heterozygous for the classic achondroplasia G340R mutation. Microsatellite marker analysis showed that the sex chromosome aneuploidy had arisen from a non-disjunction error in paternal meiosis I, with a recombination event in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1. Conclusion Specific mutation analysis is appropriate to confirm the clinical diagnosis of achondroplasia for appropriate diagnosis, prognosis, and genetic counseling, especially when the karyotype does not explain the abnormal prenatal sonographic findings. In the present case, a recombination event was observed in the PAR1 region, although recombinational events in paternally derived Klinefelter syndrome cases are much rarer than expected.\n\nAchondroplasia with 47, XXY karyotype: a case report of the neonatal diagnosis of an extremely unusual association.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRos-PÃ©rez, PurificaciÃ³n; Regidor, Francisco J; Colino, Esmeralda; MartÃ­nez-Payo, Cristina; Barroso, Eva; Heath, Karen E\n\n2012-06-29\n\nThe association of achondroplasia and Klinefelter syndrome is extremely rare.

We used CC and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (LSI p53/17p13.1) to assess deletion of 17p in 531 patients with de novo MDS from the Spanish Group of Hematological Cytogenetics. FISH detected - 17 or 17p abnormalities in 13 cases (2.6%) in whom no 17p abnormalities were revealed by CC: 0.9% of patients with a normal karyotype, 0% in non-informative cytogenetics, 50% of patients with a chr17 abnormality without loss of 17p and 4.7% of cases with an abnormal karyotype not involving chr17. Our results suggest that applying FISH of 17p13 to identify the number of copies of the TP53 gene could be beneficial in patients with a complex karyotype. We recommend using FISH of 17p13 in young patients with a normal karyotype or non-informative cytogenetics, and always in isolated del(17p).\n\n45,X karyotype\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nTabor, A; Bang, J; Philip, J\n\n1981-01-01\n\nWe report three cases of Turner's syndrome with cystic hygromata, which were diagnosed by routine ultrasound scanning before amniocentesis in the second trimester of pregnancy.

Procedure We investigated the utility of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) for detection of chromosomal abnormalities compared to standard clinical evaluation with karyotype and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH). Fifty pediatric ALL diagnostic bone marrows were analyzed by bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array, and findings compared to standard clinical evaluation. Results Sensitivity of aCGH was 79% to detect karyotypic findings other than balanced translocations, which cannot be detected by aCGH because they involve no copy number change. aCGH also missed abnormalities occurring in subclones constituting less than 25% of cells. aCGH detected 44 additional abnormalities undetected or misidentified by karyotype, 21 subsequently validated by FISH, including abnormalities in 4 of 10 cases with uninformative cytogenetics. aCGH detected concurrent terminal deletions of both 9p and 20q in three cases, in two of which the 20q deletion was undetected by karyotype. A narrow region of loss at 7p21 was detected in two cases. Conclusions An array with increased BAC density over regions important in ALL, combined with PCR for fusion products of balanced translocations, could minimize labor- and time-intensive cytogenetic assays and provide key prognostic information in the approximately 35% of cases with uninformative cytogenetics.

[Department of Hematology, Shanghai Clinical Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Xuhui District Central Hospital, Shanghai (China)\n\n2015-01-20\n\nThe purpose of this study was to explore cytokine expression patterns and cytogenetic abnormalities of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the bone marrow microenvironment of Chinese patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Bone marrow samples were obtained from 30 cases of MDS (MDS group) and 30 healthy donors (control group). The expression pattern of cytokines was detected by customized protein array. The karyotypes of MSCs were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Compared with the control group, leukemia inhibitory factor, stem cell factor (SCF), stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1), bone morphogenetic protein 4, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) stimulating factor, and transforming growth factor-Î² in the MDS group were significantly downregulated (P<0.05), while interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), and programmed death ligand (B7-H1) were significantly upregulated (P<0.05). For chromosome abnormality analysis, the detection rate of abnormal karyotypes (+8, -8, -20, 20q-, -Y, -7, 5q-) was 30% in the MDS group and 0% in the control group. In conclusion, the up- and downregulated expression of these cytokines might play a key role in the pathogenesis of MDS. Among them, SCF and SDF-1 may play roles in the apoptosis of HSCs in MDS; and IFN-Î³, TNF-Î±, and B7-H1 may be associated with apoptosis of bone marrow cells in MDS. In addition, the abnormal karyotypes might be actively involved in the pathogenesis of MDS. Further studies are required to determine the role of abnormal karyotypes in the occurrence and development of MDS.\n\nCytokine expression patterns and mesenchymal stem cell karyotypes from the bone marrow microenvironment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nXiong, H.; Yang, X.Y.; Han, J.; Wang, Q.; Zou, Z.L.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to explore cytokine expression patterns and cytogenetic abnormalities of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the bone marrow microenvironment of Chinese patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

For chromosome abnormality analysis, the detection rate of abnormal karyotypes (+8, -8, -20, 20q-, -Y, -7, 5q-) was 30% in the MDS group and 0% in the control group. In conclusion, the up- and downregulated expression of these cytokines might play a key role in the pathogenesis of MDS. Among them, SCF and SDF-1 may play roles in the apoptosis of HSCs in MDS; and IFN-Î³, TNF-Î±, and B7-H1 may be associated with apoptosis of bone marrow cells in MDS. In addition, the abnormal karyotypes might be actively involved in the pathogenesis of MDS. Further studies are required to determine the role of abnormal karyotypes in the occurrence and development of MDS\n\nClinical utility of skin karyotype\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLuiza E. Dorfman\n\n2015-08-01\n\nFull Text Available ABSTRACTWe report the case of a patient with Patau syndrome, diagnosed by skin karyotype, emphasizing the applications and importance of this test. The pregnancy morphology ultrasound showed face defects and of central nervous system and heart chambers asymmetry. In the postnatal evaluation it was identified microcephaly, single central nostril, and other malformations. We performed skin karyotype that resulted in full trisomy 13. Our report highlights the possibility of performing karyotype examination in cases when it is no longer possible to obtain a blood sample, thus providing the correct diagnosis and genetic counseling for the family.\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia in a patient with constitutional 47,XXY karyotype\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarla M.

[Univ. of Illinois, Chicago, IL (United States)\n\n1994-09-01\n\nWe report an unusual case of agnathia-holoprosencephaly associated with Down syndrome due to a 21/21 translocation. The patient presented prenatally at 21 wks gestation. A fetal ultrasound revealed multiple CNS anomalies including hydrocephalus, compressed cerebellum, absent septum pellucidum and possible cranial meningocele or encephalocele. High resolution ultrasound & fetal karyotype were recommended. The patient refused & elected to have a pregnancy termination. Chromosomal analysis performed on products of conception revealed a 46,XY,-21,+t(21q;21q) karyotype. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed and confirmed the 21/21 translocation chromosome. An autopsy revealed agnathia and multiple CNS anomalies including absence of the septum pellucidum, absence of the corpus callosum, arhinencephaly, an occiptal meningoencephalocele, dilation of the lateral ventricles, and extensive dysgenesis & heterotopias of the central cerebrum & mid-brain. Additional abnormalities included a persistent left superior vena cava, atrial & ventricular septal defects, irregular length of the fingers with absence of the middle phalanges of the right 2nd and 5th & left 5th digits and bilateral simian creases. Agnathia can be an isolated abnormality but often is associated with holoprosencephaly and/or situs inversus. The majority of familial case of agnathis-holoprosencephaly was caused by an inherited unbalanced translocation resulting in duplication of 6p and monosomy of 18p. Our patient had a translocation form of trisomy 21 but did not have a phenotype consistent with Down syndrome. Trisomy 21 has not been previously reported in other cases of agnathia-holoprosencephaly. Whether the chromosomal abnormality caused the phenotypic abnormalities or if it is a coincidental finding cannot be determined.\n\nKaryotype Learning Center: A Software For Teaching And Learning Cytogenetics\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJoelma Freire De Mesquita\n\n2004-05-01\n\nFull Text Available The in vitro cultivation of human cells is an essential part of the work of every diagnostic cytoge-netics laboratory. Almost all human cytogenetic studies involve the examination of dividing bloodcell population by blocking cell division at metaphase with subsequent processing and staining bybanding techniques. The chromosome constitution is described as Karyotype that states the totalnumber of chromosomes and the sex chromosome constitution. Karyotypes are prepared by cuttingup a photograph of the spread metaphase chromosomes, matching up homologous chromosomes andsticking them back down on a card or nowadays more often by getting an image analysis computerto do the job. Chromosomes are identied by their size, centromere position and banding pattern.Teaching a student how to detect and interpret even the most common chromosome abnormaliti-es is a major challenge: mainly, in a developing country where the laboratorial facilities are notalways available for a big number of students. Therefore, in this work we present an educationalsoftware for teaching undergraduate students of Medical and Life Sciences Courses how to arrangenormal and abnormal chromosomes in the form of karyotype. The user, using drag-and-drop, is da-red to match up homologous chromosome. For that, we have developed a free full access web site(http://www.biomol.net/cariotipo/ for hosting the software. The latter has proved to be light andfast even under slow dial-up connections. This web site also oers a theoretical introductory sectionwith basic concepts about karyotype. Up to now the software has been successfully applied to un-dergraduate courses at the University of Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO. The students have approved thesoftware; to them the similarities with the well-known game solitaire turns the exercise more excitingand provides additional stimulus to learn and understand karyotype. Professors have also used thesoftware as complementary material in their regular classes\n\nChromosome abnormalities in bone marrow of Thorotrast administered patients\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIshihara, T.; Minamihisamatsu, M.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe chromosomally abnormal clones occurring with high frequencies in bone marrow of 3 Thorotrast administered patients were studied by annual follow up observations. In one case the frequency of the clone was maintained fairly constant, but in another case it showed a tendency of increase, and in still another case the frequency of the clone showed drastic changes from year to year. The karyotypes of the clones showed remarkable chromosome abnormalities, among which the large partial loss of chromosomes was especially noted in all the 3 cases.

Although positive staging marrow is defined as morphologically identifiable disease, such samples often also include flow cytometric analysis and conventional karyotyping. Cytogenetic analysis is a labor-intensive and costly procedure and its utility in this setting is uncertain. We retrospectively reviewed pathological reports of 526 staging marrow specimens in which conventional karyotyping had been performed. All samples originated from a single institution from patients with previously untreated Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas presenting in an extramedullary site. Cytogenetic analysis revealed clonal abnormalities in only eight marrow samples (1.5%), all of which were positive for lymphoma by morphologic evaluation. Flow cytometry showed a small clonal lymphoid population in three of the 443 morphologically negative marrow samples (0.7%). Conventional karyotyping is rarely positive in lymphoma staging marrow samples and, in our cohort, the BM karyotype did not contribute clinically relevant information in the vast majority of cases. Our findings suggest that karyotyping should not be performed routinely on BM samples taken to stage previously diagnosed extramedullary lymphomas unless there is pathological evidence of BM involvement by lymphoma.

A total of 147 women with increased NT (> 95th centile) at first measurement were included in this study. A second measurement was performed in all cases, at an interval of at least 2 days. Both measurements were taken between 10 + 3 and 14 + 0 weeks. All women underwent chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis for subsequent karyotyping. In those women with a normal karyotype, a fetal anomaly scan was performed at 20 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy outcome was recorded in all cases. The finding of persistent or disappearing NT enlargement was analyzed in relation to fetal karyotype and pregnancy outcome. Of the 147 paired measurements, NT remained enlarged at the second measurement in 121 (82%) cases. An abnormal karyotype was found in 35% of these cases. In 26 (18%) fetuses the NT measurement was found to be below the 95th percentile at the second measurement and in only two of them an abnormal karyotype was found (8%). In the 103 chromosomally normal fetuses an adverse outcome (i.e. fetal loss or structural defects) was recorded in 22 fetuses with persistent enlargement (28%) and in four fetuses with disappearing enlargement (17%). Disappearance of an enlarged NT before 14 weeks' gestation is not a rare phenomenon and seems to be a favorable prognostic sign with respect to fetal karyotype. Overall, no significant difference in pregnancy outcome was found between chromosomally normal fetuses with persisting or disappearing NT enlargement.

The aim of the study was to discuss a case of POF in a 31-year-old patient with polysomy 47,XXX. The described karyotype is not usually associated with this characteristic physical phenotype. In some rare cases, menstrual disorders, sterility, secondary amenorrhoea, premature menopause, and low intelligence are found. Our observations revealed the necessity for cytogenetic examination in all women at reproductive age with symptoms of premature ovarian failure. According to the data found in literature, patients with POF and karyotype disorders belong to the risk group of premature death, mostly for cardiological reasons. Raising patient awareness about the risk may have a positive effect on quality of life and regularity of check-ups.\n\nKaryotype Analysis of Gazania rigens Varieties\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJiashi Zeng\n\n2016-09-01\n\nFull Text Available For studying species origin, systematic evolution and phylogenetic relationship of Gazania rigens, four different G. rigens varieties, with different flower colors, were subjected to chromosome karyotype analysis. The somatic chromosome number in three varieties âHongwenâ, âXingbaiâ and âRichuâ was 2nâ=â10, while in âZhongguo Xunzhangjuâ it was 2nâ=â20. We speculate that the cardinal number of chromosomes in G. rigens plants is xâ=â5, in which case âZhongguo Xunzhangjuâ is a tetraploid. The karyotype formulae of âHongwenâ, âXingbaiâ and âRichuâ were 2nâ=â8mâ+â2sm, 2nâ=â8mââ+â2sm and 2nâ=â10m respectively. The karyotype formula of âZhongguo Xunzhangjuâ was 2nâ=â18mâ+ 2sm. The asymmetrical karyotype coefficients of the four G. rigens varieties ranged from 53.80% to 58.84%. Only âRichuâ had a â1Aâ karyotype, while the others were relatively symmetric â2Aâ. Karyotype analysis indicates that the three introduced varieties have a close genetic relationship.\n\nClinical and cytogenetic results of a series of amniocentesis cases from Northeast China: a report of 2500 cases.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAn, N; Li, L L; Wang, R X; Li, L L; Yue, J M; Liu, R Z\n\n2015-12-02\n\nThe aims of this study were to demonstrate the clinical and cytogenetic results of amniocentesis (AS) cases in Northeast China, to compare the incidence of different kinds of chromosomal abnormalities, and to study the association between the detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities and different indications for prenatal diagnosis. Cytogenetic analysis was performed on long-term tissue cultures of 2500 second-trimester amniotic fluid samples. The most common indication for genetic AS was abnormal maternal serum-screening test (69.56%), followed by advanced maternal age (15.04%). Chromosomal abnormality was detected in 206 (8.24%) of the 2500 samples. The detection rate of abnormal karyotypes was 62.5% in the group in which one member of the couple was a carrier of a chromosome abnormality; in the group having a positive result from noninvasive prenatal testing, the frequency was 50%. To determine the origin of fetal chromosome abnormal karyotype, 45 fetuses were analyzed. Of these, 20 were found to be de novo abnormalities and 25 were familial. The frequency and proportion of abnormal karyotypes varied substantially across different maternal AS indications. Knowing the origin and type of chromosomal abnormality would help determine termination or continuation of the pregnancy.\n\nChromosome Mis-segregation Generates Cell-Cycle-Arrested Cells with Complex Karyotypes that Are Eliminated by the Immune System.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSantaguida, Stefano; Richardson, Amelia; Iyer, Divya Ramalingam; M'Saad, Ons; Zasadil, Lauren; Knouse, Kristin A; Wong, Yao Liang; Rhind, Nicholas; Desai, Arshad; Amon, Angelika\n\n2017-06-19\n\nAneuploidy, a state of karyotype imbalance, is a hallmark of cancer. Changes in chromosome copy number have been proposed to drive disease by modulating the dosage of cancer driver genes and by promoting cancer genome evolution. Given the potential of cells with abnormal karyotypes to become cancerous, do pathways that limit the prevalence of such cells exist? By investigating theÂ immediate consequences of aneuploidy on cell physiology, we identified mechanisms that eliminate aneuploid cells. We find that chromosome mis-segregation leads to further genomic instability that ultimately causes cell-cycle arrest. We further show that cells with complex karyotypes exhibit features of senescence and produce pro-inflammatory signals that promote their clearance by the immune system. We propose that cells with abnormal karyotypes generate a signal for their own elimination that may serve as a means for cancer cell immunosurveillance. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: From January 2013 to July 2017, 1 370 women received invasive prenatal diagnosis and chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Among them, 3 fetuses were diagnosed as 17q12 microdeletion syndrome. All 3 cases were low-risk pregnancies. Abnormal structures in fetal kidney were found in all 3 cases, including 1 case of multiple renal cysts, 2 cases of bilateral hyperechogenic kidneys. These women accepted invasive prenatal diagnosis followed by karyotyping, parental fluorescence in situ hybridization or CMA validation. Results: The second and third trimester ultrasound showed that all 3 fetuses had bilateral renal structural abnormalities, including hyperechogenic kidney, multiple cysts and renal pelvis dilatation. The karyotyping of the 3 fetuses were normal. CMA examination showed that each case had 1.4-1.6 Mb deletion in 17q12 region. Two cases were de novo deletion and 1 case was inherited from the mother who had mild symptoms. The 3 women decided to terminate pregnancies after genetic counseling. Conclusion: 17q12 microdeletion syndrome is a recurrent chromosome microdeletion syndrome, and the unique phenotype in prenatal setting is the abnormal structure of bilateral kidneys. A few cases of 17q12 microdeletion syndrome even inherited normally phenotypical parents, and prenatal genetic counseling of 17q12 microdeletion syndrome is relatively difficult.\n\nRapid aneuploidy testing (knowing less) versus traditional karyotyping (knowing more) for advanced maternal age: what would be missed, who should decide?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLeung, W C; Lau, E T; Lau, W L; Tang, Rebecca; Wong, Shell Fean; Lau, T K; Tse, K T; Wong, S F; To, W K; Ng, Lucy K L; Lao, T T; Tang, Mary H Y\n\n2008-02-01\n\nThe application of rapid aneuploidy testing as a stand-alone approach in prenatal diagnosis is much debated. The major criticism of this targeted approach is that it will not detect other chromosomal abnormalities that will be picked up by traditional karyotyping. This study aimed to study the nature of such chromosomal abnormalities and whether parents would choose to terminate affected pregnancies. Retrospective study on a cytogenetic database. Eight public hospitals in Hong Kong. The karyotype results of 19 517 amniotic fluid cultures performed for advanced maternal age (>or=35 years) from 1997 to 2002 were classified according to whether they were detectable by rapid aneuploidy testing. The outcomes of pregnancies with abnormal karyotypes were reviewed from patient records. In all, 333 (1.7%) amniotic fluid cultures yielded abnormal karyotypes; 175 (52.6%) of these were detected by rapid aneuploidy testing, and included trisomy 21 (n=94, 28.2%), trisomy 18 or 13 (n=21, 6.3%), and sex chromosome abnormalities (n=60, 18.0%). The other 158 (47.4%) chromosomal abnormalities were not detectable by rapid aneuploidy testing, of which 63 (18.9%) were regarded to be of potential clinical significance and 95 (28.5%) of no clinical significance. Pregnancy outcomes in 327/333 (98.2%) of these patients were retrieved. In total, 143 (42.9%) of these pregnancies were terminated: 93/94 (98.9%) for trisomy 21, 20/21 (95.2%) for trisomy 18 or 13, 19/60 (31.7%) for sex chromosome abnormalities, and 11/63 (17.5%) for other chromosomal abnormalities with potential clinical significance. There were no terminations in the 95 pregnancies in which karyotyping results were regarded to be of no clinical significance. 'Knowing less' by the rapid aneuploidy stand-alone testing could miss about half of all chromosomal abnormalities detectable by amniocentesis performed for advanced maternal age. Findings from two fifths of the latter were of potential clinical significance, and the parents\n\nCraniofacial abnormalities among patients with Edwards Syndrome\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRafael Fabiano M. Rosa\n\n2013-09-01\n\nFull Text Available OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency and types of craniofacial abnormalities observed in patients with trisomy 18 or Edwards syndrome (ES. METHODS This descriptive and retrospective study of a case series included all patients diagnosed with ES in a Clinical Genetics Service of a reference hospital in Southern Brazil from 1975 to 2008. The results of the karyotypic analysis, along with clinical data, were collected from medical records. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 50 patients, of which 66% were female. The median age at first evaluation was 14 days. Regarding the karyotypes, full trisomy of chromosome 18 was the main alteration (90%. Mosaicism was observed in 10%. The main craniofacial abnormalities were: microretrognathia (76%, abnormalities of the ear helix/dysplastic ears (70%, prominent occiput (52%, posteriorly rotated (46% and low set ears (44%, and short palpebral fissures/blepharophimosis (46%. Other uncommon - but relevant - abnormalities included: microtia (18%, orofacial clefts (12%, preauricular tags (10%, facial palsy (4%, encephalocele (4%, absence of external auditory canal (2% and asymmetric face (2%. One patient had an initial suspicion of oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS or Goldenhar syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the literature description of a characteristic clinical presentation for ES, craniofacial alterations may be variable among these patients. The OAVS findings in this sample are noteworthy. The association of ES with OAVS has been reported once in the literature.\n\nMixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia with Two Immunophenotypically Distinct B and T Blasts Populations, Double Chromosome and Complex Karyotype: Report of an Unusual Case\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSamah A. Kohla\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL is considered as a rare type of leukemia with an incidence of less than 4% of all acute leukemia based on the most recent 2008 WHO classification. Common subtypes are the B/myeloid and T/myeloid; B/T and trilineage MPAL being extremely rare. We present a case of a male in his 20s, whose peripheral blood smears showed 34% blast cells and bone marrow with 70% blasts. Immunophenotyping by multiparametric flow cytometry showed two populations of blasts, the major one with B-lineage and the minor one with T-lineage. Conventional karyotyping revealed complex karyotype with the presence of double Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph + . BCR/ABL1 rearrangement was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH analysis. The BCR/ABL1 ES probe on interphase cells indicated pl90 minor m-BCR/ABL fusion in 46% and a second abnormal clone with double Ph + in 16% of the cells analyzed confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR. The case was diagnosed as MPAL with double Philadelphia chromosome Ph + . The patient was treated with dasatinib, four cycle hyper CVAD/methotrexate cytarabin protocol, and allogeneic transplant. He is still alive in complete hematological, cytogenetic, and molecular remission. Mixed phenotype B/T acute leukemia is an extremely rare disease, particularly those with double Philadelphia chromosomes and clinically presents challenges in diagnosis and treatment.\n\nRing Chromosome 4 in a Child with Multiple Congenital Abnormalities: A Case Report and Review of the Literature\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nC.

Paththinige\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available A female child born preterm with intrauterine growth retardation and presenting with facial dysmorphism with clefts, microcephaly, limb deformities, and congenital abnormalities involving cardiovascular and urinary systems is described. Chromosomal analysis showed a de novo 46,XX,r(4(p15.3q35 karyotype. The clinical features of the patient were compared with the phenotypic characteristics of 17 previously reported cases with ring chromosome 4 and those with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (4p-. Clinical features observed in this case are consistent with the consensus phenotype in ring chromosome 4. Patent ductus arteriosus and bilateral talipes equinovarus observed in this baby widen the phenotypic spectrum associated with ring chromosome 4.\n\nRobin sequence associated with karyotypic mosaicism involving chromosome 22 abnormalities\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSalinas, C.F.; Jastrzab, J.M.; Centu, E.S. [Medical Univ. of South Carolina, Charleston, SC (United States)\n\n1994-09-01\n\nRobin sequence is characterized by cleft palate, hypoplastic mandible, glossoptosis and respiratory difficulties. The Robin sequence may be observed as an isolated defect or as part of about 33 syndromes; however, to our knowledge, it has never been reported associated with chromosome 22 abnormalities. We examined a two-month-old black boy with a severe case of Robin sequence. Exam revealed a small child with hypoplastic mandible, glossoptosis, high palate and respiratory difficulty with continuous apnea episodes resulting in cyanotic lips and nails. In order to relieve the upper airway obstruction, his tongue was attached to the lower lip. Later a tracheostomy was performed. On follow-up exam, this patient was found to have developmental delay. Cytogenetic studies of both peripheral blood and fibroblast cells showed mosaicism involving chromosome 22 abnormalities which were designated as follows: 45,XY,-22/46,XY,-22,+r(22)/46,XY. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies confirmed the identity of the r(22) and showed the presence of the DiGeorge locus (D22575) but the absence of the D22539 locus which maps to 22q13.3. Reported cases of r(22) show no association with Robin sequence. However, r(22) has been associated with flat bridge of the nose, bulbous tip of the nose, epicanthus and high palate, all characteristics that we also observed in this case. These unusual cytogenetic findings may be causally related to the dysmorphology found in the patient we report.\n\nPlacental disease and abnormal umbilical artery Doppler waveforms in trisomy 21 pregnancy: A case-control study.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCorry, Edward; Mone, Fionnuala; Segurado, Ricardo; Downey, Paul; McParland, Peter; McAuliffe, Fionnuala M; Mooney, Eoghan E\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe objectives of this study were firstly to determine the proportion of placental pathology in fetuses affected by trisomy 21 (T21) using current pathological descriptive terminology and secondly to examine if a correlation existed between the finding of an abnormal umbilical artery Doppler (UAD) waveform, the presence of T21 and defined placental pathological categories. This case-control study assessed singleton fetuses with karyotypically confirmed trisomy 21 where placental histopathology had been conducted from 2003 to 2015 inclusive, within a university tertiary obstetric centre. This was compared with unselected normal singleton control pregnancies matched within a week of gestation at delivery. Data included birthweight centiles and placental histopathology. Comparisons of Doppler findings across placental pathological categories were performed using statistical analysis. 104 cases were analysed; 52 cases of trisomy 21 and 52 controls. Fetal vascular malperfusion (48.1% vs. 5.8%, pÂ =Â 0.001) and maturation defects (39.2% vs. 15.7%, pÂ =Â 0.023) were more common in trisomy 21 placentas. Compared with controls, trisomy 21 fetuses were more likely to have shorter umbilical cords (pÂ =Â 0.001) and had more UAD abnormalities. Amongst T21 pregnancies, umbilical artery Doppler abnormalities are associated with the presence of maternal vascular malperfusion. Fetal vascular malperfusion and maturation defects are more common in trisomy 21 placentas.

(Japan). School of Medicine\n\n1978-09-01\n\nThe whole process of a second case of chronic granulocytic leukemia in Nishiyama district where a very small amount of radiation existed for a long time was reported together with data measured by a human counter and the results of chromosomal analysis. No significantly high K or /sup 137/Cs values were measured by a human counter immediately after the onset. Chromosomal division aberration and chromosomal aberration, which seemed to be induced by radiation, also were not observed. However, granulocytic leukemia was diagnosed after chromosomal analysis of peripheral blood revealed Ph/sup 1/ chromosomes, white cell count increased, juvenile cells appeared, and basophil cells increased. Clinical features of typical chronic granulocytic leukemia in the exposed were observed during the chronic stage (7 years). In the acute stage, abnormal clones were discovered in all 16 chromosomes analyzed. Much karyotypic evolution identical to that in persons directly exposed to the A-bomb was also observed.\n\nCare of women with XY karyotype\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nJorgensen, Pernille Bach; KjartansdÃ³ttir, KristÃ­n RÃ³s; Fedder, Jens\n\n2010-01-01\n\nOUTCOME MEASURE(S): Evaluation of etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and associated disorders in XY women. RESULT(S): Many gene mutations can cause abnormal fetal development leading to androgen insensitivity syndrome or gonadal dysgenesis disorders. Females with these disorders have an XY karyotype but look...... like girls. They are mostly diagnosed at puberty, and the condition will often lead to serious psychological problems. Increased risk of malignancies and problems with pregnancy and infertility are other aspects that should be considered. This guideline will aid doctors in caring for XY females...\n\nInversion of chromosome 7q22 and q36 as a sole abnormality presenting in myelodysplastic syndrome: a case report.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKaneko, Hiroto; Shimura, Kazuho; Kuwahara, Saeko; Ohshiro, Muneo; Tsutsumi, Yasuhiko; Iwai, Toshiki; Horiike, Shigeo; Yokota, Shouhei; Ohkawara, Yasuo; Taniwaki, Masafumi\n\n2014-08-05\n\nDeletions of chromosome 7 are often detected in myelodysplastic syndrome. The most commonly deleted segments are clustered at band 7q22. A critical gene is therefore suggested to be located in this region. We report a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome whose marrow cells carried an inversion of 7q22 and q36 as a sole karyotypic abnormality. How this extremely rare chromosomal aberration contributes to the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndrome should be clarified by accumulating clinical data of such cases. A 74-year-old Japanese man presented with pancytopenia incidentally detected by routine medical check-up. His complete blood cell counts revealed that his white blood cells had decreased to 2100/mm3, neutrophils 940/mm3, red blood cells 320Ã104/mm3, hemoglobin 11.1g/dL, hematocrit 33.1%, and platelets 12.6Ã104/mm3. Bone marrow examination showed normal cellularity with nucleated cells of 9.4Ã104/mm3. The proportion of blasts was 4%. A morphological examination showed only basophilic stippling of erythroblasts which was seen as dysplasia. According to World Health Organization classification, the diagnosis was myelodysplastic syndrome-u. Karyotypic analysis showed 46,XY,inv(7)(q22q36) in all of 20 metaphases examined. Additional analysis revealed the karyotype of his lymphocytes was 46,XY. He is asymptomatic and cytopenia has slowly progressed. To the best of our knowledge, this karyotype from a clinical sample of de novo malignancies has never been documented although the identical karyotype from secondary myelodysplastic syndrome was reported. Despite the extremely low frequency, inversion of 7q22 appears to play a crucial role for myelodysplastic syndrome in this patient.\n\nChromosomal abnormalities in amenorrhea: a retrospective study and review of 637 patients in South India.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDutta, Usha R; Ponnala, Rajitha; Pidugu, Vijaya Kumar; Dalal, Ashwin B\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the chromosomal abnormalities and to identify the most prevalent or frequent type of chromosomal abnormalities in cases of amenorrhea from the southern region of India. A total of 637 cases with amenorrhea were analyzed using G- banding, C-banding, Silver staining, and fluorescence in situ hybridization was done wherever necessary. Out of the 637 cases involved in our study, 132 abnormalities were detected. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in cases with primary and secondary amenorrhea was around 20.7 %. In addition to the numerical anomalies, various structural aberrations of the X chromosome like deletions, isochromosomes, duplications, ring chromosome, and also male karyotype were detected. Review of the literature and overall incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in patients with amenorrhea suggests the need for cytogenetic analysis to be performed in all the cases referred for amenorrhea with or without short stature. Precise identification of chromosomal abnormalities helps in confirming the provisional diagnosis; it helps the secondary amenorrhea patients in assisted reproduction and to understand the clinical heterogeneity involved and in efficient genetic counseling.\n\nKaryotype in Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Impact On Clinical Presentation and Duration of First Remission\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKhairy, A.M.D.; EL-SISSY, M.D.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nIn this study we are aiming at investigating the correlation between karyotype and the clinico pathologic features of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, duration of first remission and outcome of patients. Material and Methods: A total of 40 pediatric patients with the diagnosis of acute ]lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were included in this study. The patients were treated according to ALL P.NCI III/98 protocol used at the Pediatric Oncology Unit, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University. Analyzing the patients with respect to their chromosomal pattern; the majority of patients (17/40, 42.5%) showed a pseudo diploid karyotype. Their mean age was 10.2Â±4.8 years, M/F ratio 2.4: I. Massive hepatosplenomegaly (HSM) was encountered in 64.7%. The mean total leucocyte count (TLC) was 66.53Â±5.2 cells per Î¼l. Their mean first complete remission (CR]) was 11.05Â±2.3 months, EFS was 40% at 12 months and 17.78% at 24 months. Patients with normal karyotype came next, representing ]3/40 (32.5%). Their mean age was 8.4Â±1.8 years, M/F 0.8: I. Massive HSM was found in 62.5%. The mean TLC was 78.74Â±3.8 cells per Î¼l. Their mean CR 1 was I I.62Â±1.2 months, EFS was 41.67% at 12 months and 33.33% at 24 months. The third group represented patients with hyper diploidy (8/40; 20%). Their mean age was 8. 8Â±3.

The use of C, G, and AgNOR banding methods allowed determination that morphological changes in two nonhomologous autosomes, which were accompanied by rearrangements in distribution of G bands, heterochromatin, and NOR, are the result of a reciprocal translocation. Chromosomal aberrations were probably inherited or appeared in embryogenesis, since none of the analyzed cells of the studied vole had a normal karyotype. It is important to note that this rearrangement was detected five years after the meltdown. Both breaks and reunions of the chromosomes that participate in this rearrangement are probably located in regions that are not important for functioning of these chromosomes. Thus, it can be supposed that the detected rearrangement did not influence the viability of the vole. This karyotype was compared to a standard karyotype of a root vole from another area of the species range. The heteromorphism of the first pair of chromosomes in both voles, which was detected for the first time, is probably normal for the karyotype of M. oeconomus and is not linked with any radiation-induced intrachromosomal aberrations\n\n46 XX karyotype during male fertility evaluation; case series and literature review\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAhmad Majzoub\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Forty-six XX disorder of sex development is an uncommon medical condition observed at times during the evaluation of a manâ²s fertility. The following is a case series and literature review of phenotypically normal men diagnosed with this karyotype. Our goal is to comprehend the patientsâ² clinical presentation as well as their laboratory results aiming to explore options available for their management. A formal literature review through PubMed and MEDLINE databases was performed using \"46 XX man\" as a word search. A total of 55 patients, including those conveyed in this article were diagnosed with a 46 XX karyotype during their fertility evaluation. The patientsâ² mean age Â± s.d. was 34 Â± 10 years and their mean height Â± s.d. was 166 Â± 6.5 cm. Overall, they presented with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Sexual dysfunction, reduced hair distribution, and gynecomastia were reported in 20% (4/20, 25.8% (8/31, and 42% (13/31 of the patients, respectively. The SRY gene was detected in 36 (83.7% and was absent in the remaining seven (16.3% patients. We found that a multidisciplinary approach to management is preferred in 46 XX patients. Screening for remnants of the mullerian ducts and for malignant transformation in dysgenetic gonads is imperative. Hypogonadism should be addressed, while fertility options are in vitro fertilization with donor sperm or adoption.\n\nCharacterization and prognostic implication of 17 chromosome abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndrome.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSÃ¡nchez-Castro, Judit; Marco-BetÃ©s, VÃ­ctor; GÃ³mez-ArbonÃ©s, Xavier; Arenillas, Leonor; Valcarcel, David; VallespÃ­, Teresa; Costa, Dolors; Nomdedeu, Benet; Jimenez, MarÃ­a JosÃ©; Granada, Isabel; Grau, Javier; Ardanaz, MarÃ­a T; de la Serna, Javier; Carbonell, FÃ©lix; Cervera, JosÃ©; Sierra, Adriana; LuÃ±o, Elisa; Cervero, Carlos J; Falantes, JosÃ©; Calasanz, MarÃ­a J; GonzÃ¡lez-PorrÃ¡s, JosÃ© R; BailÃ©n, Alicia; Amigo, M Luz; Sanz, Guillermo; SolÃ©, Francesc\n\n2013-07-01\n\nThe prognosis of chromosome 17 (chr17) abnormalities in patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) remains unclear. The revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) includes these abnormalities within the intermediate cytogenetic risk group. This study assessed the impact on overall survival (OS) and risk of acute myeloid leukemia transformation (AMLt) of chr17 abnormalities in 88 patients with primary MDS. We have compared this group with 1346 patients with primary MDS and abnormal karyotype without chr17 involved. The alterations of chr17 should be considered within group of poor prognosis. The different types of alterations of chromosome 17 behave different prognosis. The study confirms the intermediate prognostic impact of the i(17q), as stated in IPSS-R. The results of the study, however, provide valuable new information on the prognostic impact of alterations of chromosome 17 in complex karyotypes. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Review of the literature (102 cases)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSmadja, N.; Krulik, M.; Debray, J.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nA review of the literature upon 102 cases with cytogenetic study of preleukemic states (Prel.) and/or acute secondary leukemia (ASL) following chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment has been made. The karyotype was almost always abnormal (91% of cases). There was a predominance of hypodiploidy with abnormalities including chromosome number 5 (-5 ou 5q-) and/or number 7 (7- or 7q-) (chromosomes studied with banding). The abnormalities were present in preleukemia state. The pattern of the acute secondary leukemia was particularly different from that acute leukemia de novo: high frequency of preleukemia state, ANLL type of leukemia, very bad prognosis, importance of cytogenetic abnormalities. There was a great interest in the study of the karyotype for the previous detection in ASL: this allowed their discovery as soon as the preleukemia state [fr\n\nAn efficient protocol for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities in spontaneous miscarriages or foetal deaths.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDÃ³ria, Sofia; Carvalho, Filipa; Ramalho, Carla; Lima, Vera; Francisco, TÃ¢nia; Machado, Ana Paula; BrandÃ£o, OtÃ­lia; Sousa, MÃ¡rio; Matias, Alexandra; Barros, Alberto\n\n2009-12-01\n\nCharacterization of chromosomal abnormalities in 232 spontaneous miscarriages or foetal deaths using both classical and molecular cytogenetics. Chromosomal abnormalities are responsible for 40-50% of all early pregnancy losses. Conventional cytogenetics is associated with 10-40% of culture failure. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a DNA-based technique that screens chromosome imbalances in the whole genome and may overcome this problem, although additional methods are required to distinguish between different ploidies, mosaicisms and maternal cell contamination. For a full characterization of chromosomal aberrations in 232 spontaneous miscarriages or foetal deaths we applied a sequential protocol that uses conventional cytogenetics, plus CGH and touch fluorescence in situ hybridization (Touch FISH). Successful karyotyping was obtained in 173/232 (74.6%) of the cases, 66/173 (38.2%) of which had an abnormal chromosomal complement. CGH and Touch FISH analyses revealed another 19 abnormal cases in the 63 failures of culture. Overall there were 85/233 (36.6%) cases with an abnormal chromosomal complement, with examples from all three trimesters. Comparing cases, with or without chromosomal abnormalities, no statistical differences were found between women with one or recurrent miscarriages. On the contrary, significant differences were found comparing mean maternal ages or mean gestational ages, in cases with or without chromosomes abnormalities. Adopting this sequential protocol, chromosomal complement information was available even in cases with culture failure.\n\nImpact of cytogenetic abnormalities in adults with Ph-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLafage-Pochitaloff, Marina; Baranger, Laurence; Hunault, Mathilde; Cuccuini, Wendy; Lefebvre, Christine; Bidet, Audrey; Tigaud, Isabelle; Eclache, Virginie; Delabesse, Eric; Bilhou-NabÃ©ra, ChrystÃ¨le; TerrÃ©, Christine; Chapiro, Elise; Gachard, Nathalie; Mozziconacci, Marie-Joelle; Ameye, GeneviÃ¨ve; Porter, Sarah; Grardel, Nathalie; BÃ©nÃ©, Marie C; Chalandon, Yves; Graux, Carlos; Huguet, FranÃ§oise; LhÃ©ritier, VÃ©ronique; Ifrah, Norbert; Dombret, HervÃ©\n\n2017-10-19\n\nMultiple cytogenetic subgroups have been described in adult Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative B-cell precursor (BCP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), often comprising small numbers of patients. In this study, we aimed to reassess the prognostic value of cytogenetic abnormalities in a large series of 617 adult patients with Ph-negative BCP-ALL (median age, 38 years), treated in the intensified Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GRAALL)-2003/2005 trials. Combined data from karyotype, DNA index, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction screening for relevant abnormalities were centrally reviewed and were informative in 542 cases (88%), allowing classification in 10 exclusive primary cytogenetic subgroups and in secondary subgroups, including complex and monosomal karyotypes. Prognostic analyses focused on cumulative incidence of failure (including primary refractoriness and relapse), event-free survival, and overall survival. Only 2 subgroups, namely t(4;11)/ KMT2A-AFF1 and 14q32/ IGH translocations, displayed a significantly worse outcome in this context, still observed after adjustment for age and after censoring patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in first remission at SCT time. A worse outcome was also observed in patients with low hypodiploidy/near triploidy, but this was likely related to their higher age and worse tolerance to therapy. The other cytogenetic abnormalities, including complex and monosomal karyotypes, had no prognostic value in these intensive protocols designed for adult patients up to the age of 60 years.

Previous data suggested that CD34 expression may be associated with other poor prognosis factors in AML such as undifferentiated leukemia, secondary AML (SAML), and clonal abnormalities involving chromosome 5 and 7. In order to analyze the correlations between the clinicopathologic features, cytogenetic and CD34 expression in AML, we retrospectively investigated 99 patients with newly diagnosed AML: 85 with de novo disease and 14 with secondary AML (SAML). Eighty-six patients who received the same induction chemotherapy were available for clinical outcome. Defining a case as positive when > or = 20% of bone marrow cells collected at diagnosis expressed the CD34 antigen, forty-five patients were included in the CD34 positive group. Ninety patients had adequate cytogenetic analysis. Thirty-two patients (72%) with CD34 positive AML exhibited an abnormal karyotype whereas 15 patients (28%) with CD34 negative AML had abnormal metaphases (P /= 20% (P clinical outcome in AML should take into account the results of pretreatment karyotype.\n\nThe incidence of chromosome abnormalities in neonates with structural heart disease.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDykes, John C; Al-mousily, Mohammad F; Abuchaibe, Eda-Cristina; Silva, Jennifer N; Zadinsky, Jennifer; Duarte, Daniel; Welch, Elizabeth\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThis study was conducted to determine the prevalence of chromosomal anomalies in newborns with structural heart disease admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) at Nicklaus Children's Hospital (NCH). A retrospective review identified newborns age 30â days or less admitted to NCH CICU between 2004 and 2010. Patients with structural heart disease who required admission to our CICU and received karyotype or karyotype and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) testing were included in the study. All patients were examined for the presence of dysmorphic features. Four hundred and eighty-two patients met the criteria for the study; 405 (84%) received both karyotype and FISH. Chromosome abnormalities were present in 86 (17.8%) patients. Syndromes accounted for 20 (5.1%) of those with normal chromosomes. Dysmorphic features were seen in 79.1% of patients with abnormal chromosomes and 25.5% of those with normal chromosomes. All patients with syndromes were dysmorphic. Race and gender did not significantly affect the incidence of genetic abnormalities. Chromosome abnormalities, including syndromes, are prevalent in newborns with congenital heart disease. Further research is needed to evaluate the utility of cytogenetic screening in all children with congenital heart disease. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Techniques available for rapid karyotyping are: 1. Amniocentesis; to obtain amniotic fluid cells for culturing and subsequent chromosome harvesting using the pipette method or the \"in situ\" technique. The average time between preparation of the amniotic fluid and the verbal notification of the analysed karyotype is 4.65 days for the pipette method and 5.97 days for the \"in situ\" technique. The major advantages are that amniocentesis can be handled safely by many gynaecologist, and the amniotic fluid samples can be posted easily to cytogenetic units familiar with rapid karyotyping. The main disadvantage is that currently only a few laboratories are able to handle the pipette method or the \"in situ\" technique for rapid karyotyping. 2. Fetal blood sampling (cordocentesis); and subsequent chromosome analysis on cultivated fetal lymphocytes leading to results within 2 to 4 days. The main advantage of this procedure is the reliability of the results obtained. Fetal blood sampling, however, is restricted to specialists; this may involve scheduling delays. 3. Placental biopsy; with subsequent direct preparation and long term culturing. In comparison to both other techniques this procedure is faster if direct preparation is used. Results can be obtained even on the same day. The main disadvantage, however, is the problem with the reliability of the direct preparation results. They must be confirmed by time-consuming long-term culturing. Data are presented on the likelihood of abnormal ultrasound findings being caused by chromosomal aberrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nThe Turner syndrome in patient with 45X/47XXX mosaic karyotype--case report.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMaciejewska-Jeske, Marzena; Czyzyk, Adam; Meczekalski, Blazej\n\n2015-07-01\n\nTurner syndrome (TS) is a gonadal dysgenesis related to partial or total lack of one of the X chromosomes.

In all, the Ph chromosome disappeared, while the 5 cases, additional abnormalities [dup(1); del(5), +8 (2 patients) and +14] persisted in the subsequent studies, performed over a period of 11 to 49 months, either alone or together with a karyotypically normal cell population. This finding is consistent with a secondary origin of the Ph chromosome in these patients. It is still to early to evaluate the possible prognostic value of these additional abnormalities.\n\nAbnormal sex chromosome constitution and longitudinal growth: serum levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF binding protein-3, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone in 109 males with 47,XXY, 47,XYY, or sex-determining region of the Y chromosome (SRY)-positive 46,XX karyotypes\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nAksglaede, L.; Skakkebaek, N.E.; Juul, A.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nCONTEXT: Growth is a highly complex process regulated by the interaction between sex steroids and the GH IGF-axis.

Here, we describe a novel case of T-ALL associated with a mediastinal mass and a SET-NUP214 rearrangement, which was masked by a complex karyotype at the time of initial diagnosis. Using multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, we detected a cryptic SET-NUP214 rearrangement in our patient. As only 11 cases (including the present study) of T-ALL with SET-NUP214 rearrangement have been reported, the clinical features and treatment outcomes have not been fully determined.

We present a case of MCL diagnosed concomitantly with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). A 41-year-old woman presented with asthenia, anorexia, fever, epigastralgia, and diarrhea. She had a maculopapular skin rash, hepatosplenomegaly, retroperitoneal adenopathies, pancytopenia, 6% blast cells (BC) and 20% MC in the peripheral blood, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, cholestasis, hypoalbuminemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and increased serum tryptase (184â Î¼ g/L). The bone marrow (BM) smears showed 24% myeloblasts, 17% promyelocytes, and 16% abnormal toluidine blue positive MC, and flow cytometry revealed 12% myeloid BC, 34% aberrant promyelocytes, a maturation blockage at the myeloblast/promyelocyte level, and 16% abnormal CD2-CD25+ MC. The BM karyotype was normal, and the KIT D816V mutation was positive in BM cells. The diagnosis of MCL associated with AML was assumed. The patient received corticosteroids, disodium cromoglycate, cladribine, idarubicin and cytosine arabinoside, high-dose cytosine arabinoside, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The outcome was favorable, with complete hematological remission two years after diagnosis and one year after HSCT. This case emphasizes the need of an exhaustive laboratory evaluation for the concomitant diagnosis of MCL and AML, and the therapeutic options.\n\nFetal chromosome abnormalities and congenital malformations: an ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nThe results also showed that Multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) represented among 42.2%, congenital malformation of CNS represents 26.6%, congenital malformation of the skeletal system 20%, congenital polycystic kidney 8.8% and pyloric stenosis in 2.2%.

Although some chromosomal abnormalities have been well characterized, the significance of several miscellaneous, infrequent, single chromosomal abnormalities remains to be defined. In addition, the emerging therapeutic agents may change the natural course of disease in patients with MDS and the cytogenetic impact on risk stratification. Clinicopathologic data were retrieved on 1029 patients who had a diagnosis of primary MDS and had available cytogenetic data (karyotype) on file. Cytogenetic abnormalities were identified in 458 patients (45%) and occurred most frequently in patients who had refractory anemia with excess blasts (62%). Overall, the 3 cytogenetic risk groups defined by the IPSS -- good, intermediate, and poor -- effectively stratified the patients' overall survival (OS) (64 months, 31 months, and 12 months, respectively; P < .001). With the exception of gain of chromosome 8, single cytogenetic abnormalities within the intermediate group were extremely infrequent in the series but demonstrated variable OS ranging from 10 months for patients who had isochromosome (17q) to 69 months for patients who had deletion of 12p [del(12p)], suggesting different prognostic significance. In the poor cytogenetic risk group, patients with isolated del(7q) and derivative (1;7)(q10;p10) had a significantly better median OS than patients who had either loss of chromosome 7 or a complex karyotype (P < .05). The current data generated from a large cohort of patients with primary MDS indicated that some specific cytogenetic abnormalities carry different risk than their IPSS cytogenetic risk-group assignment, especially in the new treatment era. Because of the extreme low frequency, additional combined studies are needed to better categorize some rare single cytogenetic\n\nChromosomal aneuploidies and copy number variations in posterior fossa abnormalities diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLei, Ting; Feng, Jie-Ling; Xie, Ying-Jun; Xie, Hong-Ning; Zheng, Ju; Lin, Mei-Fang\n\n2017-11-01\n\nTo explore the genetic aetiology of fetal posterior fossa abnormalities (PFAs). This study involved cases of PFAs that were identified by prenatal ultrasonographic screening and confirmed postnatally between January 2012 and January 2016. Conventional cytogenetic analyses and chromosomal microarray analysis were performed, and chromosomal aneuploidies and copy number variations (CNVs) were identified. Among 74 cases included in this study, 8 were of Blake's pouch cyst; 7, Dandy-Walker malformation; 11, vermian hypoplasia; 32, enlarged cisterna magna; and 16, cerebellar hypoplasia. The rates of nonbenign chromosomal aberrations (including chromosomal aneuploidies, pathogenic CNVs, and variants of unknown significance) were 2/8 (25.0%), 2/7 (28.5%), 8/11 (72.7%), 7/32 (21.9%), and 6/16 (37.5%), respectively. Cases were also classified as isolated PFAs (30/74), PFAs with other central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities (13/74), or PFAs with extra-CNS structural abnormalities (31/74). No fetuses with isolated PFAs or PFAs accompanied by other CNS abnormalities exhibited chromosomal aneuploidies or pathogenic CNVs. The rate of pathogenic chromosomal aberrations in the remaining fetuses was 17/31 (22.9%). The combined use of chromosomal microarray analysis and karyotype analysis might assist the prenatal diagnosis and management of PFAs, with extra-CNS structural abnormalities being detected by ultrasonography.
