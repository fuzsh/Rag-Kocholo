        "text": "Abstract. Temperature is one of the most important factors that directly affect the possibility and the rate of flower differentiation in many geophytes such as Lilium. In this experiment, different day and night temperatures were used to determine the required day and night temperature for flower bud development in Lilium hansonii. After low temperature exposure for breaking bulb dormancy, the bulbs were planted in pots, and placed in designated growth chambers each with a specific temperature. The plants were exposed to different temperatures for 30 days, and 15 days after planting sample plants were collected in each treatment for observation of flower bud development using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Responses of plant height, number of leaves, and stem diameter were also measured as affected by difference between day and night temperature (DIF) and average daily temperature (ADT). The results showed that average daily temperature and high day temperature had a direct effect on the quality, quantity, and time required for flower bud development. They also affected the stem elongation, number of leaves, and stem diameter. Higher ADT and DT (25°C) promoted stem elongation and increased leaf unfolding rate (LUR), but with less number of leaves produced. As ADT and DT increased, stem diameter decreases. In lower ADT and DT (15°C) treatment, greater stem diameter and higher number of flower buds (2-7 buds) were produced. Higher ADT and DT promoted early flower bud initiation, but lower number of flower buds with higher possibilities of flower bud abortion, while lower ADT and DT showed slower flower bud initiation and development with higher flower bud formation. Additional key words: DIF, flower abortion, flowering physiology, scanning electron microscope (SEM)\n\nThe flower initiation stage is one of the most critical stages in plant development. This study was conducted with an aim of identifying the precise flower bud initiation stage in oriental lily hybrids, ‘Sorbonne’ and ‘Siberia’, for the purpose of proper plant management during the flower development stage. The bulbs were micro-dissected 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days after planting. Five bulbs were randomly selected for dissection and flower bud initiation stage identification. Bulb circumference, shoot length, number of bulb scales, number of leafy scales, number of true/alternate leaves, and flower bud initiation stage were measured. The flower bud initiation stages were scaled as follows: 0 = no flower buds, 1 = starting stage, 2 = flower bud developing stage, and 3 = fully developed flower bud stage. In both the hybrids, flower bud initiation started 20 days after planting and was observed to be associated with shoot length; the initiation occurring in shoots 11–13cm long. It was also greatly affected by the cultural management during the growing of plants. Identification of the exact time of flower bud initiation will be useful in proper management of the plant materials with respect to their requirements of water, nutrient, environmental conditions, and pest control. This knowledge will help in developing quality flowers of the two studied oriental lily hybrids for breeding and commercial purposes.\n\nAlmost three decades of genetic and molecular analyses have resulted in detailed insights into many of the processes that take place during flower development and in the identification of a large number of key regulatory genes that control these processes. Despite this impressive progress, many questions about how flower development is controlled in different angiosperm species remain unanswered. In this chapter, we discuss some of these open questions and the experimental strategies with which they could be addressed. Specifically, we focus on the areas of floral meristem development and patterning, floral organ specification and differentiation, as well as on the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolutionary changes that have led to the astounding variations in flower size and architecture among extant and extinct angiosperms."
