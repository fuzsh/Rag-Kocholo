        "text": "Lilium ‘Sumatra’ was one of the first dark Red/Burgundy Oriental Lilies to be introduced. The very large blooms on Sumatra will reach 20 cm in diameter\n\nLilium [members of which are true lilies] is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants growing from bulbs, all with large prominent flowers. Lilies are a group of flowering plants which are important in culture and literature in much of the world. Most species are native to the temperate northern hemisphere, though their range extends into the northern subtropics. Many other plants have “lily” in their common name but are not related to “true” lilies.\n\nClassification of garden forms. Numerous forms, mostly hybrids, are grown for the garden. They vary according to the species and interspecific hybrids that they derived from, and are classified in the following broad groups:\n\nAsiatic hybrids [Division I]: These are plants with medium-sized, upright or outward facing flowers, mostly unscented.\n\nMartagon hybrids [Division II]\n\nThese are based on Lilium dalhansonii, Lilium hansonii, Lilium martagon, Lilium medeoloides, and Lilium tsingtauense. The flowers are nodding, Turk’s cap style [with the petals strongly recurved].\n\nCandidum [Euro-Caucasian] hybrids [Division III]\n\nThis includes mostly European species\n\nAmerican hybrids [Division IV]\n\nThese are mostly taller growing forms, originally derived from Lilium bolanderi, Lilium × burbankii, Lilium canadense, Lilium columbianum, Lilium grayi, Lilium humboldtii, Lilium kelleyanum, Lilium kelloggii, Lilium maritimum, Lilium michauxii, Lilium michiganense, Lilium occidentale, Lilium × pardaboldtii, Lilium pardalinum, Lilium parryi, Lilium parvum, Lilium philadelphicum, Lilium pitkinense, Lilium superbum, Lilium ollmeri, Lilium washingtonianum, and Lilium wigginsii.\n\nMany are clump-forming perennials with rhizomatous rootstocks.\n\nLongiflorum hybrids [Division V]\n\nThese are cultivated forms of this species and its subspecies. They are most important as plants for cut flowers, and are less often grown in the garden than other hybrids.\n\nTrumpet lilies [Division VI]\n\nThis group includes hybrids of many Asiatic species and their interspecific hybrids, including Lilium × aurelianense, Lilium brownii, Lilium × centigale, Lilium henryi, Lilium × imperiale, Lilium × kewense, Lilium leucanthum, Lilium regale, Lilium rosthornii, Lilium sargentiae, Lilium sulphureum and Lilium × sulphurgale.\n\nThe flowers are trumpet shaped, facing outward or somewhat downward, and tend to be strongly fragrant, often especially night-fragrant.\n\nOriental hybrids [Division VII]\n\nThese are based on hybrids within Lilium section Archelirion, specifically Lilium auratum and Lilium speciosum, together with crossbreeds from several species native to Japan, including Lilium nobilissimum, Lilium rubellum, Lilium alexandrae, and Lilium japonicum.\n\nThey are fragrant, and the flowers tend to be outward facing. Plants tend to be tall, and the flowers may be quite large. The whole group are sometimes referred to as “stargazers” because many of them appear to look upwards.\n\nOther hybrids [Division VIII]\n\nSpecies [Division IX]\n\nAll natural species and naturally occurring forms are included in this group.\n\nThe flowers can be classified by flower aspect and form:\n\nFlower aspect: up-facing, out-facing, down-facing,\n\nFlower form: trumpet-shaped, bowl-shaped, flat [or with tepal tips recurved], tepals strongly recurved [with the Turk’s cap form as the ultimate state]\n\nPhotos: Flower Dome, Gardens by the Bay, Singapore [20160618]\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nLilium ‘Auratum’ ~ Pure white with lemon-yellow bands down the center of each petal, flower have varying numbers of speckles.\n\nLilium [members of which are true lilies] is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants growing from bulbs, all with large prominent flowers.

This Lily is a member of the Longiflorum Lilies Division (V) which includes lilies with medium-sized to large, trumpet-shaped flowers.\n\nLilium [members of which are true lilies] is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants growing from bulbs, all with large prominent flowers. Lilies are a group of flowering plants which are important in culture and literature in much of the world. Most species are native to the temperate northern hemisphere, though their range extends into the northern subtropics. Many other plants have “lily” in their common name but are not related to “true” lilies.\n\nClassification of garden forms. Numerous forms, mostly hybrids, are grown for the garden. They vary according to the species and interspecific hybrids that they derived from, and are classified in the following broad groups:\n\nAsiatic hybrids [Division I]: These are plants with medium-sized, upright or outward facing flowers, mostly unscented.\n\nMartagon hybrids [Division II]\n\nThese are based on Lilium dalhansonii, Lilium hansonii, Lilium martagon, Lilium medeoloides, and Lilium tsingtauense. The flowers are nodding, Turk’s cap style [with the petals strongly recurved].\n\nCandidum [Euro-Caucasian] hybrids [Division III]\n\nThis includes mostly European species\n\nAmerican hybrids [Division IV]\n\nThese are mostly taller growing forms, originally derived from Lilium bolanderi, Lilium × burbankii, Lilium canadense, Lilium columbianum, Lilium grayi, Lilium humboldtii, Lilium kelleyanum, Lilium kelloggii, Lilium maritimum, Lilium michauxii, Lilium michiganense, Lilium occidentale, Lilium × pardaboldtii, Lilium pardalinum, Lilium parryi, Lilium parvum, Lilium philadelphicum, Lilium pitkinense, Lilium superbum, Lilium ollmeri, Lilium washingtonianum, and Lilium wigginsii.\n\nMany are clump-forming perennials with rhizomatous rootstocks.\n\nLongiflorum hybrids [Division V]\n\nThese are cultivated forms of this species and its subspecies. They are most important as plants for cut flowers, and are less often grown in the garden than other hybrids.\n\nTrumpet lilies [Division VI]\n\nThis group includes hybrids of many Asiatic species and their interspecific hybrids, including Lilium × aurelianense, Lilium brownii, Lilium × centigale, Lilium henryi, Lilium × imperiale, Lilium × kewense, Lilium leucanthum, Lilium regale, Lilium rosthornii, Lilium sargentiae, Lilium sulphureum and Lilium × sulphurgale.\n\nThe flowers are trumpet shaped, facing outward or somewhat downward, and tend to be strongly fragrant, often especially night-fragrant.\n\nOriental hybrids [Division VII]\n\nThese are based on hybrids within Lilium section Archelirion, specifically Lilium auratum and Lilium speciosum, together with crossbreeds from several species native to Japan, including Lilium nobilissimum, Lilium rubellum, Lilium alexandrae, and Lilium japonicum.\n\nThey are fragrant, and the flowers tend to be outward facing.
