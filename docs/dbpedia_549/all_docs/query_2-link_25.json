This work with isolated rhizome segments and leaf cuttings presents efficient systems for regenerating rhizomes that can be used to produce stock plants for a stem cutting system for Eucodonia ‘Adele’ as a seasonal pot plant.\n\nEucodonia is a small genus in the Gesneriaceae with two species that are native to Mexico. The Gesneriaceae is a diverse group with about 150 genera of mostly tropical or subtropical herbaceous terrestrial or epiphytic plants. Eucodonia is in the subfamily Gesnerioideae and tribe Gesnerieae with plants that form mainly from scaly rhizomes (Zimmer et al. 2002). Eucodonia is closely related to Achimenes, and species in both genera produce plants that have scaly rhizomes. When plants of Eucodonia or Achimenes are produced in temperate areas, they go dormant in winter after summer and early-fall flowering, and survive as the scaly rhizome.\n\nEucodonia ‘Adele’ is a hybrid cross with Eucodonia verticillata ‘Frances’ as one of the parents. It produces large, lavender-blue tubular flowers above dark-green pleated foliage (Fig. 1). Plants emerge from winter-dormant rhizomes and grow about 6 inches (15 cm) tall. They are summer-to-fall flowering and can be produced as a seasonal pot plant or as a partly shaded garden plant where they are winter hardy (Zone 7b US Department of Agriculture hardiness map).\n\nInformation is limited on Eucodonia propagation, but should follow established practices for Achimenes (Dole and Wilkins 2005). Achimenes shoots emerge from dormant rhizomes from the previous season’s crop. Plants can be formed directly from rhizomes or rhizome pieces, or emerging shoots from rhizomes can be used as stock plants for cutting propagation. Several harvests of two to three node cuttings can be taken from the same stock plant from late spring into early summer.\n\nEucodonia ‘Adele’ shows potential as a commercial seasonal pot plant. To become a viable commercial crop, an efficient system to supply rhizomes would be needed from specialty growers. Therefore, the objective of this research was to investigate shoot formation efficiency related to rhizome size and cytokinin treatment in Eucodonia, as well as shoot or rhizome initiation in leaf cuttings. In addition, shoot formation was observed to understand the anatomic relationship between rhizome segments used for propagation and origin of new shoot formation."
