        "text": "Abstract. Temperature is one of the most important factors that directly affect the possibility and the rate of flower differentiation in many geophytes such as Lilium. In this experiment, different day and night temperatures were used to determine the required day and night temperature for flower bud development in Lilium hansonii. After low temperature exposure for breaking bulb dormancy, the bulbs were planted in pots, and placed in designated growth chambers each with a specific temperature. The plants were exposed to different temperatures for 30 days, and 15 days after planting sample plants were collected in each treatment for observation of flower bud development using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Responses of plant height, number of leaves, and stem diameter were also measured as affected by difference between day and night temperature (DIF) and average daily temperature (ADT). The results showed that average daily temperature and high day temperature had a direct effect on the quality, quantity, and time required for flower bud development. They also affected the stem elongation, number of leaves, and stem diameter. Higher ADT and DT (25°C) promoted stem elongation and increased leaf unfolding rate (LUR), but with less number of leaves produced. As ADT and DT increased, stem diameter decreases. In lower ADT and DT (15°C) treatment, greater stem diameter and higher number of flower buds (2-7 buds) were produced. Higher ADT and DT promoted early flower bud initiation, but lower number of flower buds with higher possibilities of flower bud abortion, while lower ADT and DT showed slower flower bud initiation and development with higher flower bud formation. Additional key words: DIF, flower abortion, flowering physiology, scanning electron microscope (SEM)\n\nPlants of an early flowering Antirrhinum cultivar 'Chimes White' were pinched at 4, 5, 6, and 7 leaf-pair stage to observe the effects on flowering time and plant quality. Though control plants flowered earlier (81 days) than the pinched ones, they produced less number of flower buds. Flower time and rate of progress to flowering in pinched plants increased linearly and significantly. The quality of pinched plants regarding branch numbers, leaf area, plant height, plant fresh weight etc. was significantly improved in all treatments. Many plant growth parameters were successfully fitted by the second degree polynomial model whereas linear model indicated a good fit in reproductive development. period of insensitivity to photoperiod when released from apical dominance, but a contradictory result was reported by Adams et al. (1998), who found that chrysanthemum plants were capable of responding to short days immediately following pinching. This method of removing apical dominance is also found to delay flowering but did not affect plant height or plant width (Starman and Faust, 1999). In winter cultivars of Antirrhinum (Coronette Yellow and Coronette Scarlet), pinching produces plants with significantly reduced plant height, shorter but increased number of flower spikes and lengthened flowering time. The pinching stage does not seem to influence plant height, but pinching carried out at later stage of plant development reduced the spike length and prolonged flowering time. Pinching at the third pair of leaves from the base of plant produced maximum flower spikes in the shortest time. These effects of pinching are a result of a more even distribution of assimilates between several growing points rather than just one. The delay in flowering is a result pushing the plant back to the juvenile phase. In this way, pinching appears to maintain the juvenile phase for longer and the precise cause of the flowering delay, which may be attributed to the axillary shoots being in a less advanced physiological phase than apical shoot (Wainwright and Irwin, 1987). The stage at which the plants are pinched, though, was found to have significant effects on the time of flowering and the length of spike, the following experiment was however undertaken to evaluate the effect of pinching at different stages of plant development (4, 5 and 6 leaf-pair stage) on the flowering and plant growth of Antirrhinum.\n\nThe flower initiation stage is one of the most critical stages in plant development. This study was conducted with an aim of identifying the precise flower bud initiation stage in oriental lily hybrids, ‘Sorbonne’ and ‘Siberia’, for the purpose of proper plant management during the flower development stage. The bulbs were micro-dissected 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days after planting. Five bulbs were randomly selected for dissection and flower bud initiation stage identification. Bulb circumference, shoot length, number of bulb scales, number of leafy scales, number of true/alternate leaves, and flower bud initiation stage were measured. The flower bud initiation stages were scaled as follows: 0 = no flower buds, 1 = starting stage, 2 = flower bud developing stage, and 3 = fully developed flower bud stage. In both the hybrids, flower bud initiation started 20 days after planting and was observed to be associated with shoot length; the initiation occurring in shoots 11–13cm long. It was also greatly affected by the cultural management during the growing of plants. Identification of the exact time of flower bud initiation will be useful in proper management of the plant materials with respect to their requirements of water, nutrient, environmental conditions, and pest control. This knowledge will help in developing quality flowers of the two studied oriental lily hybrids for breeding and commercial purposes."
