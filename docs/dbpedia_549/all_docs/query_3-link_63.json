Author Elaine Nowick has drawn from sources as diverse as Linnaeus, Lewis and Clark, and local university extension publications to compile the gamut of practical, and often fanciful, common plant names used over the years. Each common name is accompanied by a definitive scientific name with references and authority information. Interspersed with scientifically-correct botanical line drawings, the entries are written in standard ICBN format, making this a useful volume for scholars as well as lay enthusiasts alike. Volume 1 presents, in alphabetical order, all the historical common names of plants recorded in Great Plains flora, herbaria, and botanical collections, together with the scientific names of species to which those common names have been applied. Volume 2 indexes the scientific names of those species, followed by listings of all the common names applied to them. Both volumes refer the common and scientific names back to a list of 190 pertinent authoritative sources.

Millspaugh, 1892]\n\nPreface\n\nA\n\nlthough the term “common names” occurs in the title of this book, there are relatively few plants known to the majority of people. Many individuals today suffer from “plant blindness” and don’t really notice the plant life around them. Some environmentalists look to a past golden age when people were more in tune with the natural world. In the millennia before agriculture, our species and our hominid ancestors survived by hunting and gathering. Being able to recognize edible and poisonous plants would have been a vital skill for them, as it is for all animal species except strict carnivores. It is not known when speech first evolved, but plant names were most likely among the earliest words. As Gilmore (1932) states, “Indigenous peoples always have names for the plants they use and even the ones they don’t use but are aware of.” Most of these ancient names have been lost in the sands of time. From the onset of agriculture about 10,000 years ago until the mid-twentieth century, most of the human species survived by farming. Survival came to depend on the few cultivated species, and humankind’s attention shifted to those species and their weedy pests. The exceptions were often the herbal practitioners. Among Europeans up until the Middle Ages, and among other peoples around the world, healers were often the most knowledgeable about botany. Even among formally trained medical doctors until quite recently, botany was an integral part of their training. Writers of herbals and pharmacopeias were very concerned that herbal practitioners and herb gatherers be able to identify accurately the correct plant species to be used to treat a specific ailment, and modern editors of ancient herbals can often reliably assign a contemporary scientific name to plants from their descriptions. The age of exploration greatly accelerated the movement of plant species around the world. The earliest Europeans to arrive in the New World were very interested in the plant species used by the indigenous peoples. Plant species from the Americas began appearing in herbals around the 1600’s. Early European settlers often adopted the native names, sometimes in garbled form. The Joe Pye weed (Eupatorium perfoliatum L. or Eupatorium purpureum L.) is an example. The original Native American name was said to be “jopi.” Homesickness may have led some Europeans to give names familiar to them to similar but unrelated plants, such as the Evening-primrose (Oenothera) which is not related to the European primrose (Primula). Europeans also invented\n\nnames for the new plants they observed. Some of the earliest botanical explorers in the Americas were sponsored by wealthy Europeans wanting the distinction of owning rare or unusual plants for their gardens and conservatories. Collectors such as John Banister, John and William Bartram, Frederick Pursh, André and François Michaux, and Peer Kalm sent herbarium samples, plants, seeds, and cuttings to nurseries, gardens, and institutions throughout Europe. The proliferation of known types of plants and also of names for them created an awareness of the need for proper identification and a uniform terminology. Common names were often confusing. The same name could be used for several different species and several names could be used for the same species. Plant names for the same species often differed by locality or dialect. Educated people of the time used Latin as their common language and in communicating about plants they used lengthy Latin descriptions. Tournefort, the Bauhins, and others provided detailed but cumbersome descriptions of the new plants species they were cataloging. Linnaeus is generally credited with creating the Latin binomial system. His “Genera Plantarum” published in 1737 and “Species Plantarum” in 1753 serve as the basis for scientific plant names now in use. One of the beauties of the Latin binomial system is that it not only simplifies the Latin descriptions, but also reflects relationships among plant species. All species in the given genus have a close morphological similarity and later research has often revealed genetic similarities that for the most part support these relationships. Often, Linnaeus’ scientific names were adapted from the classical Greek or Latin name for the species or a closely related plant, but often were quite arbitrary and may have said little about the named species itself. For many Great Plains and Western species, scientific names predate common names, at least in European languages, unlike plant species from Europe and eastern North America. The first Europeans to arrive in the Great Plains and the West were the Spanish in the southern range and the French trappers arriving from the north. But even before the Europeans arrived, their influence on the region was being felt. The arrival of the first horses, the descendants of horses escaped from the early Spanish explorers, brought huge cultural changes. Displacements of indigenous people from the East caused waves of war and social disruption to radiate into the Plains and Rocky Mountains. European diseases preceded movement of people and devastated the native tribes. These v\n\nHistorical Common Names\n\nchanges surely would have been accompanied by changes in language referring to plants, disruptions in the passing of knowledge about the uses of plants, and unfortunately loss of knowledge of plant life as long-term residents of the environment were pushed out. Works on ethnobotany and journals of early botanical explorers often recorded native names when they were aware of them. The explorers’ journals also sometimes provided Spanish, French, or German names for Great Plains and Western flora. The spelling and tribal designations in this book are as reported in the original work. Later works by anthropologists and ethnobotanists were also consulted for current plant names of Native Americans. The Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore the northern limits of the Louisiana Purchase ushered in a fifty-year period of government-sponsored scientific surveys of botany, geology, zoology and general natural history in the western territories, inspired by the visionary Thomas Jefferson. Lewis, Clark, and the other journal keepers of the Corps of Discovery recorded native plant names and noted plants they recognized on the way. Closely following Lewis and Clark, were collectors such as Thomas Nuttall, Constantine Rafinesque, and John Bradbury. Travelers such as Josiah Gregg, Henry Marie Brackenridge, and Prince Maximilian were broadly educated and took great interest in natural history and anthropology, noting the plant species they observed and their native uses. Many of Lewis and Clark’s species were described after much delay by Frederich Pursh, who also collected botanical samples in the eastern United States. The Lewis and Clark expedition was succeeded by a series of military-led scientific explorations following the courses of the major rivers in the Great Plains and then by the railroad surveys attempting to find the best route to the Pacific by rail. These surveys included botanists, zoologists, and geologists, as well as surveyors. The Civil War put an end to these surveys, but the Hatch Act passed by Congress in 1862 set in motion an entirely new phase in plant research. The founding of the “People’s Universities” put science at the service of the common person. The land grant universities were given a mission not only to perform serious scientific research, but also to translate that research into a form that ordinary farmers could use to improve their lives. The publications of the land grant universities and the cooperative extension services in the Plains states were rich sources of information for this dictionary. The extension agents and university professors were anxious both to identify accurately the species mentioned and to enable the common people to recognize them by using local names for the species. In the 1800’s a number of periodicals dealing with botany were published in the United States, and these were also used as sources of names. In the late 1800’s quite a few popular guides to wildflowers were published. As settlers became established in the western United States, some of them became better educated and had more time to spend on activities beyond the basics of life. The appearance of these\n\nof\n\nG r e at P l a i n s P l a n t s\n\nbotanical guides may also reflect an increasing alienation from the natural world—there is an underlying assumption in these works that the readers would not be familiar with the wildflowers and not have either common or scientific names for them. It is a myth that each species has one and only one, permanent and unique scientific name. For example, the USDA Plants Database (http://plants.usda.gov/) lists 21 scientific synonyms for Calamagrostis stricta ssp. inexpansa (northern reedgrass). Linnaeus and his contemporaries believed that species were static and permanently distinct, although the differences might be subtle. Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published in 1859; his revolutionary idea was that species changed through time. We now know that species do evolve, and that populations within a species can diverge, and that there are degrees of plant-to-plant variation within a species arising from genetic differences and environmental effects. During the 1700s, when new plants were arriving in Europe at a very fast rate, communications were slow and unreliable, so it is not surprising that some species designations have needed revision. New techniques such as chromosome karyotyping, biochemical analysis, and DNA sequencing have shed further light on taxonomic relations. One of the great strengths of the binomial system is that there is a mechanism for determining the “correct” name for each species and publishing the accepted name as well as its Latin synonyms. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature as adopted by the International Botanical Congress is updated periodically. Names of new or revised species are created and disseminated in accord with the code. For this work the references used for contemporary Latin names and synonyms unless otherwise noted were: The Plants Database (http://plants.usda.gov) published by the USDA; W3Tropicos (http://www.tropicos.org/) from the Missouri Botanic Gardens; and the International Plant Names Index (http://www.ipni.org/), a joint project of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Gardens, the Harvard University Herbaria, and the Australian National Herbarium. While scientists were adopting the system of Latin binomials, common names continued to be created and are still invented even today. Latin binomials are the best way for scientists to communicate with one another about plant species, but common names have both interest and value, and there is a great deal of information embedded within common names. They record the relation of humans to a particular plant species, and they are accessible to people who are not formally trained in botany. Some academic researchers had mixed feelings or even hostility towards common names. John Torrey and Asa Gray are considered to be the joint parents of American botany. In one of his botanical reports attached to the railroad surveys, Torrey condescendingly states, “There is, however, little dependence to be placed on the common names of plants, especially among rude and ignorant people.” Nathaniel Britton and Addison Brown, on the other hand, saw no antagonism between common and scientific names vi\n\nP r e fa c e\n\nand felt that, “they [popular names] are invaluable; not for science, but for the common intelligence, and the appreciation and enjoyment of the plant world.” There have been occasional efforts to standardize common names. The Pharmacopeias and Dispensatories used conventionalized vocabularies usually in English for the plant species used as medicinals. Several associations representing the nursery industry, landscape architects, florists and other horticulturists formed the American Joint Committee on Horticultural Nomenclature. This committee issued several editions of standardized plant names. In the second edition of Standardized Plant Names, Harlan Kelsey, Secretary of the American Joint Committee on Horticultural Nomenclature recognizes the value of common names while acknowledging their limitations.\n\nsexist, or otherwise insensitive? As John Smith (1882) says “With regard to the adoption of common, or what are termed popular, names, it is unfortunate that many of them are vulgar and undignified, and derogatory to the useful, pretty, and curious plants which they designate…” In their defense, common names often reflect knowledge of a plant species’ ecology. Common names may also refer to the appearance of the plant, its taste, or its use. While common names may refer to the function of a plant in relation to humans, rather than to anything about the plant itself, this still may be more telling than a scientific name given as a tribute to a person who may have had no relation either to the named species or the region. Scientific names have also rather arbitrarily been given for a species’ resemblance to another species more familiar to the namer. Yet other scientific names are based on classical names for either different plant species or unknown species. No one would argue for a preference for common names in the scientific literature, but in a time when humans are becoming increasingly “plant-blind” and detached from the natural world, encouraging the use of current common names and even creation of new ones may encourage humans to look again at the ultimate source of all their nourishment and of even the air they breathe. It is hoped that this reference work will be of use to historians, writers of historical fiction or natural history, restorationists, and the general public. This dictionary was compiled from first person accounts of early explorers and plant collectors. When they were available or when the original writer did not include a scientific name, later editions with appropriate footnotes were used. Other sources include floras, extension publications, government reports, botanical periodicals, earlier common name compilations, wildflower guides, and other publications. Dates and locations are included when appropriate. The dates are the reporting dates since it would not be possible to accurately determine when a name came into existence or became archaic. Explanations for the common names are included if they are known. Common name spellings are according to Kartesz and Thieret (1991). Alternate spelling are enclosed in parentheses. Readers are encouraged to send additions to these names if they are aware of them to the author for inclusion in later editions. Please include as much information as possible.\n\n“In this 1942 edition of STANDARDIZED PLANT NAMES the editors have adopted what seemed the best common names for plants and plant products so far as was feasible at this time. Many thousands of new names were supplied for plants that had no common names, or with common names wholly unsuitable or more properly belonging to other plants. “In thousands of other cases, especially of plants new or little known, common names are missing, for an appropriate name suggests itself usually only on intimate acquaintance with the particular plant or with its history.” Some botanists have included English names in their works, more rightly called vernacular names than common names, since they are often direct translations of the Latin scientific name. Britton and Brown, Thomas Meehan, and others admit that they made up likely common names for species when they didn’t know of one. As Liberty Hyde Bailey states, “One cannot ‘make’ common names, although one may coin an English name. A name is not common until it comes into general use. Most plants do not possess true common names.”1 Nevertheless, in this work there has been no attempt to distinguish between vernacular and true common names. What’s in a common name? Why bother with names that may be confusing or misleading and in some cases racist,\n\nElaine Nowick Cañon City, Colorado April 2014\n\n1. Bailey, L.H. 1933.
