NEW YORK TELEPHONE. MAIN 2-4433 We hope readers will find this HANDBOOK ON GARDENING a useful guide to better growing. What varieties to plant, and when and where to plant them — are perennial questions, and much of the handbook is devoted to them. But this is not all. Guest Editor Ries and Editor Frese, with their collaborators, have included 42 different topics in the 96 pages that follow. There is a complete section on garden practices, another on lawns, still another on home landscaping. And, finally, there is a section on trees, shrubs and vines — permanent plants in the landscape. If in doubt about how to prune, how to plant a tree or shrub, how to make compost, or how to organize your vegetable garden — the answers are all here, with some 120 illustrations. Questions by the thousands: From time to time we like to report on some of the routine jobs we do. Here is one about answering questions. In the course of an average year, Botanic Garden staff members spend a total of more than 800 hours answering some 10,000 questions by telephone alone. This is the same as having one person in continuous telephone conversation for 5 months of 40-hour weeks. As a public service, it is part of the job our people enjoy doing. About 40 questions are asked over and over again by different people, by letter as well as by phone. For example : “How do we decide what trees and shrubs to plant on our newly acquired property, and how do we go about making a lawn . . . and flower beds?” “How do I start a compost pile?” “How often must I water my house plants . . . and how does one get rid of mealy bugs?” Whether you are an experienced gardener or an enthusiastic beginner, this HANDBOOK ON GARDENING is designed for you. Yours sincerely, Director Part I — Plants for Garden and Home GUIDE TO THE USE OF ANNUALS, PERENNIALS, BULBS Victor H. Ries TIIE desire for color in the garden is best satisfied by the liberal use of annuals', perennials and bulbs in variety. All three classes of plants have their place, because each has its value as to season of bloom, height or mass of color. Succession of bloom from early spring to late fall is the goal of nearly every gardener. To achieve this consider first that very few hardy flowers have an in- dividual blooming period of more than two or three weeks. Even annuals bloom only during the summer. Therefore, even for a small garden, one may have to select several dozen different kinds of plants to assure bloom from March to killing frost. Your climate will determine how early in the spring and how late in the fall you can have flowers. An added factor is the location of your garden. Low spots in valleys often suffer more from frosts than those at slightly higher elevation, or on hillsides. This is usually due to lack of air drainage to carry the cold air away. Those near large bodies of water, such as lakes and the ocean, may have a later spring but a longer growing season in the fall than those but a few miles away. Very hot summer climates, especially where the nights are hot, limit the kinds of flowers that may he grown. This ap- plies to hardy flowers as well as annuals. Planning- the Flower Garden The skillful gardener employs numerous devices to achieve a colorful flower bed or border. For example, by plantii spring flowering bulbs between ar beneath other flowers, each square fo of ground should give at least two cro] of bloom. Conversely, after spring bulb such as daffodils and tulips, are throug blooming, they may he interplanted wit annuals for summer bloom. As summn blooming annuals go by in SeptembeiJ they can be followed by chrysanthemum clumps transplanted from another pail of the garden. An orderly plan, made il advance, will simplify the task of keep in j the show going from season to season. The kinds of flowers you grow will bj determined in a measure by the amoun of sunlight available. This will vary fror bed to bed, from one side of the house t the other. Most flowers will thrive in ful sun but a few require shade. Others ar shade tolerant, though doing better witl a greater amount of sunlight. So it i: possible to have flowers in the shade oi trees, shrubs and buildings even where n< direct sunlight reaches. Such plants a; ferns, many wild flowers, and begonia; have to be protected from the summei sun, for otherwise they may sun-scorch When making a plan, it is importanfj to know how tall each kind of floweij grows so as not to plant tall growing ones in front of low ones. The habit of growth should be known too, so as not to crowd massive clumps like peonies next to smaller, weaker growers such as peachleaf bellflowers; or sprawling coreopsis next to a low, tufted Japanese primrose. Veryl 4 gsssts IH ■■■■ ■■ ■i m as mm ISStS ii ii in ii II Mil II w hpi trenereux Clumps of perennials are the backbone of this border; annuals fill spaces between them rank growers like the plume poppy and spreading Chinese lantern are really best kept, out of beds with other flowers al- together. Much lias been said and written about planning color schemes in the garden. They are fascinating to think about, but often difficult to work out. Do not be disconcerted if the results are not as ex- pected. Flowers have an irritating way of not blooming just when they should, so that carefully planned combinations may not materialize. Colors vary too. Blues in catalogs are not always your idea of blue. This goes for lavender, purple, red, pink, orange, yellow and so on through the rainbow. In any case, there is enough green foliage to subdue impossible color combinations. Some people like to have their flowers in the front of the house where they can he seen. Others prefer to enjoy them in privacy. It is well to remember that in early spring and fall the weather may not be conducive to outdoor enjoyment. Plant so that cold weather bloom may be en- joyed from the warmth and comfort of the home, using the windows as a means of access to the garden. Flowers can also be planted so as to be seen from the patio or picnic area. In every instance, a garden with a pleasing pattern or design and an adequate background is more satisfying than one without. The voice of experience is most helpful in planning a garden. Sources of help are garden clubs and friends and neigh- bors who may have had more garden ex- perience. Much can be learned from visiting other gardens at home and on trips, nurseries, botanic gardens, arbore- tuins and well-landscaped parks. All this will add to your knowledge of plants and how they grow. Annual Flowers Have Many Uses In spite of the great variety of annual flowers listed in catalogs, relatively few are grown in gardens. T his is unfortunate because they are a great source of sum- mer and early fall color in the garden. Most of them are easy to grow from seed, and are not expensive when purchased as plants. They all bloom the first season or they could not be called annuals. A num- ber will self -sow and come up year after year. No other type of flower gives so much bloom for so long a period during hot summer months. Some annuals must be started early to bloom by early summer, such as vinca, verbena, hunnemannia, lobelia, scarlet sage. A few do not bloom until later in the summer no matter how early they are started, such as China aster and cosmos. A few will not bloom during very hot weather, notably calendula, stocks, sal- pigiossis, nemesia and nemophila. Most annuals are free of common pesl However, it will pay to plant only ru 1 resistant snapdragons and wilt-resista I asters. When a bed is used year afl year, root rots may be prevalent as ini eated by the plants wilting and dyii When this happens, try a new bed a avoid the other for annuals for sevei years. There is a tendency on the part many gardeners to set out annuals t early in the spring. Except for those th are called hardy, better wait until ; danger of frost is past. Even if there no frost, cold weather will stunt t seedlings. Growing your own plants indoors us ally results in weak, spindly seedliu because of high temperatures and lack sunlight. Try growing them outdoors in coldframe. The plants will be sturdil and will transplant better. Cleome, or spider flower, grows 3 to 4 feet high and has either pink or white flowers.

A few, not being hardy, must be taken up and stored away from the cold over winter. Some of these tender bulbs are most desirable for summer bloom. They give effects not obtainable from other plants. The bulk of the spring-flowering hardy bulbs must be fall-planted before the ground freezes. A few of the smaller ones, such as winter aconite, anemone, and some squills, should be planted as early as possible before they dry out and become worthless — bv late September or early October. Lilies dry out easily, too, and should be planted as soon as they are received. Although planting depths are given for all kinds of bulbs, it is more impor- tant to have good top soil beneath the bulb where the roots grow than to set the bull) at exactly the correct depth. Places where bulbs may be used in t average garden are limitless. Some kinc such as crocus and scillas, may be tuck in any place where they can grow and w not interfere with mowing. Others, IT. daffodils, can be put under ground covei such as periwinkle, around the bases trees, and in front of and in betwe shrubs and evergreens. Most bulbs a suited to planting all through any and i flower beds and borders. The little bul are fine in the wild garden, around a po< | and in the rock or wall garden. Bull will even bloom in planter boxes. Once planted, leave the bulbs alone : they continue to bloom regularly. T1 j will vary with the place and the kind bulb, from several years to as many . ten or more. Daffodils can keep it up f ' a quarter of a century at least. Bulb foliage is sometimes unattractifc after bloom. Tulips can be cut back p 10 McFarland Golden-yellow crocus clustered beneath the branches of evergreens make a pretty picture Showiest of all tulips are the late double varieties, such as white Mt. Tacoma Gottscho-Schleisner ■ f Hr* Jf ' **1 f^gy' « 1 tbit II ~ Lj ppjwawii* L idgpr - 11 Clusters of spring-flowering bulbs are interplanted here between hardy perennials Genereux the bottom three leaves, and daffodils ean be cut back half way without ap- parently affecting the next year’s bloom. In small plantings, some prefer to braid daffodil foliage or tie it in a knot, to make it less floppy, so that oilier flowers can be planted in between. Still others dig their tulips after blooming and heel them in to mature and cure in some other bed. This b a lot of work and may harm the bulbs if not carefully done. It is amazing how long a period of bloom is possible from spring-flowering bulbs if they are selected with this in mind. For instance, daffo- dils can be in bloom for five to six weeks by the use ol early7, midseason and late varieties. Tulips, by' the use of species, double and single early', May - flowering anc double late varieties, give us as much as two months of bloom. Starting with winter aconites ami snowdrops, using all the other spring bulbs, then including a collection of lilies, one can have bloom until Septem her. Using gladiolus planted every twc weeks from March to early July', tuberous begonias, dahlias, hardy amaryllis anc tigridia, there would be bloom from this The largest size crocus bulbs are the best buy because each bulb pro- I duces a large cluster of flowers the first year Watson from Monkmeyer 12 j This chart shows how deep, and how far apart, various kinds of bulbs should be planted I group alone from early July to frost. It I is all in the planning, always keeping in mind the goal of succession of bloom. Contrary to many of the recommenda- 1 tions commonly given, bulbs may be fertilized with commercial fertilizers just | the same as everything else in the garden. It is not necessary to use bonemeal. With but few exceptions, such as dahlias and gladiolus, most bulbs may be planted in shaded areas and still flower, although the competition of tree roots will retard their growth slightly. A few, such as tuberous begonias, fancy leaf ealadiums and achimenes, must have some protection from the hot summer sun in most climates. Moles are often accused of eating bulbs, but they are carnivorous, not vegetarians. It is mice that use the mole burrows that eat bulbs. Mouse traps baited with peanut butter are a sure cure. Chipmunks are a pest, for they eat and carry away many small bulbs such as crocus, as will be discovered when these bulbs come up in the lawn or other beds where chipmunks have buried them. For control, try rat poison on peanut butter, put in their burrows or under a few slabs of wood where the birds cannot get at it. Plant begonia tubers with concave side up New growth starts where dahlia roots join stem. When dividing clumps, a piece of stem must go with each root 1? COMBINING BULBS WITH PERENNIALS FOR SUCCESSION OF BLOOM Many gardeners strive to have a garden that is bright with flowers from spring to fall, but very few ever succeed in making such a garden. Part of the reason for this is lack of space to grow enough plants to put on a real show. More often, not enough thought has gone into selecting plants which will provide an uninter- rupted flow of bloom. In many instances, one could use no more than seven or eight basic kinds of hardy flowers, such as daffodils, tulips, iris, peonies, phlox, daylilies, hardy asters First Flowers of Spring Crocus, especially C. suskm us, tomasinianus, sieberi and chrysanthemums, and then, by select- ing varieties within each group which flower at different times, have seven months of bloom from them alone. Bulb and nursery catalogues generally give the season of bloom of each variety or type of flower. As a basic guide, the following list is offered. Included are hardy and tender bulbs, perennials, annuals and even a few native plants suitable for growing in gardens.

If sufficient space is available and we are willing' to give the trees and bushes the proper care, this is practical. But all too often they are not given the necessary pest control care and the fruit produced is diseased or wormy. However, by growing our own it is possible to enjoy varieties which are of better quality than many that are grown commercially and none can compare in flavor with tree-ripened fruit. Peaches are desirable because we may plant varieties not grown commer- cially, especially the white-fleshed kinds. White varieties, in order of season of ripening, are Erly-Red-Fre, Cumberland, Belle of Georgia. Yellows are .Jersey- land, Redhaven, Golden Jubilee, Trio- gem, Fairhaven, Sunhigh, TTalebaven, Redskin, After Glow, Lizzie. Plums (tree-ripened fruit) are difficult to buy at stores. Those that will set Genereux fruit with their own pollen are Stanley, Shropshire damson, French damson. Those that must be pollinated by another variety are Bradshaw, Imperial Epin- euse, Italian prune and Heine Claude. The Japanese varieties are more difficult to grow in many localities. Sour cherries are easy to grow but sweet cherries need another tree to polli- nate* them. And with all cherries the birds are a problem if you have only a tree or two. Apples and pears become large trees unless dwarfs are planted. Contrary to many advertisements, only apples and pears are available as satisfactory dwarf trees. Fireblight disease is a problem that as yet is difficult to control, particu- larly in pears. Better check with your agricultural experiment station to find out what varieties, if any, are practical for your locality — and for the space you wish to give them. Strawberries are probably the most practical fruit for home gardens. As with all fruit, a sunny location is needed. And it must be very well drained. Since a bed goes down in yield after a couple of years, a new one should be started from runners the second season. .Tune bearing varieties will yield better than ever- bearers, and many of them have better quality. The better June varieties are Armore, Fairland, Sparkle, Plentiful, Pocahontas, Catskill, Vermilion. For everbearers try Brilliant, Gem and Super- fection. Blueberries are worth trying if your soil is acid or if you can keep it acidified. The plants are decorative as shrubs and have lovely fall color. But the catalogs fail to say that every bird in the locality will stop by to eat the blueberries unless A corner of a fruit garden in which rasp- berries are trained to posts behind the blue- berries, and strawberries are grown as “hills” (runners clipped off) to the right How to Grow Strawberries First Improve the Soil With Humus A thick layer of com- post, (lug deeply into the bed before planting, will improve the fertility and drainage of the soil, making it ideal for strawberries they are covered with netting. By plant- ing early, midseason and late varieties, fruit will be abundant over a period of more than a month. The improved varieties include June, Stanley, Jersey, Earliblue, Bluecrop, Herbert, Dixi, Co- ville and Blueray. Try growing blue- berries in the shrub border as you would azaleas. Currants are practical if you like them. Usually only two or three bushes are needed. The same is true of goose- berries. The latter are very spiny. These fruits should not be grown within a quar- ter mile of white pines which are the alternate host of the blister rust disease. Red raspberries are wonderful if only healthy stock is planted. Once a patch is started and the old wood cut out every year, it will last for years. Black rasp- berries take more room and, because of their tip layering, need more attention, (food red varieties are Taylor, Latham and Milton. Everbearing reds are Dur- ham and September. Black varieties are Logan, Bristol, Cumberland. Purple raspberries must be planted several hundred feet away from the red to prevent the spread of disease. Purple varieties are Sodus, Marion, Hedrick, Eldorado and Bailey. Boysenberries, loganberries and simi- lar types are not as hardy as other berries. They are long-caned and awk- ward plants, sometimes trained on a trellis the same as grapes. Grapes are an old standby in home gardens. For ease of pruning it is much better to train them on a three-wire fence than on an arbor. Then instead of cutting every branch back to one or two buds each spring, all the new branches except one are cut off. Unless you prune grapes severely you will not get the yield you expect. Varieties in order of ripening are: Interlaken Seedless, Erie, Ontario, VanBuren, Captivator, Niagara, Fredonia, Brighton, Concord, Delaware, Seneca, Golden Muscat and Catawba. These will ripen from late August to mid-October. The great problem with apples, plums, peaches, grapes and to a lesser extent other fruits is following an adequate dusting or spraying schedule. Most kinds need a minimum of three or four treat- ments, and more in the case of apples. The timing of sprays is most important. Since this varies from region to region it is well to ask your own agricultural experiment station for a spray schedule. Sometimes it is easier and quicker for the home gardener to dust rather than spray. Tt may not be quite as effective,! but is much easier to do, :0 Setting Out the Plants Rows are close spaced in this bed (12 inches apart) because runners will be kept cut off.

To achieve this end, several points of culture are important. First of all, vege- tables need full sun at least half the day, preferably all day. Better than average soil is necessary to produce certain vege- tables, such as root crops and salad plants. An abundance of organic matter in the soil improves the quality of carrots, beets, radishes and other root crops. For this reason, the more rotted leaves, sawdust, manure or other organic matter mixed with the soil, the better. The soil is im- proved further by sowing winter rye in early September to dig under in the spring. Fertilizer, such as that used on the lawn, is needed at least once a month during the growing season. Rainfall is seldom sufficient, so some provision should be made to irrigate. A hand-held hose is a waste of time when applying one inch of water a week — the average required amount. Use some type! of a sprinkler, and set a tin can on the ground to measure the amount of water being applied. Cultivation is only necessary to control weeds and keep the soil surface broken! to take in rain. Other than this, cultiva-j tion is nothing more than exercise for the gardener. It does not conserve moisture,! as old timers still believe. Very often mulching such crops as tomatoes im- proves growth, reduces labor, and keeps the fruit clean. Always work out a plan on paper be- fore1 sowing a single seed. Most folks Sint/e r It’s good to try different kinds of vegetables each year. Kohlrabi ( above left) develops best when sown in early spring or after mid- summer. Harvest while the skin is still ten- der. Cook the stem tubers like turnips To /> right. Savoy cabbage has better flavor and texture than other kinds. Heads can be gathered as soon as they are solid, but har- vesting can last for many weeks from even one short row Bottom right. Butternut squash is small sized, has thick meaty neck, small seed cav- ity. It’s delicious when split open, baked with butter and seasoning. Squash is botan- ically a fruit, even though referred to as a vegetable G ottscho-Schl e is tier plant far more radishes, lettuce, beans and other vegetables than the whole neigh- borhood can use. It is better to make fre- quent plantings and only a little each time of vegetables that soon go past their best eating stage. Try sowing just a few feet of row of each one at a time. Try differ- ent varieties to add to the fun. Some crops that should be sown at fre- quent intervals are corn, radishes, lettuce, beans, and peas. Plant extra rows of the vegetables being grown for quick freezing. Summer sowing for fall harvesting pays with endive, lettuce, cabbage, carrots, beets, radishes, spinach and others. Always be ready to plant a new crop to replace the one harvested. In this way it is possible to get at least two and some- times three crops from the same land. Some crops require the entire season to grow, such as parsnips, salsify, sweet potatoes, squash, melons, peppers, Brus- sels sprouts. Very often a row of radishes or Bibb lettuce may be grown in between the rows of the slower growing, long season crops. Through advance planning, we can get. full value from a plot of land. The varieties used are important be- cause some have better eating qualities than others. For instance, why grow green beans with strings when the better vari- eties have none. The following varieties are recommended for home gardens by the Ohio State University Agricultural Extension Service. 23 Recommended Vegetable Varieties for Home Gardens INote: Varieties marked with a ( ) are suitable for freezing as well as for immediate use.

This is a plan that has proved success- ful; but certain substitutions may be made, to suit individual tastes. Radishes, spinach, lettuce, and onion sets, all very short-season crops, are interchangeable in succession and companion cropping. Whenever possible, root crops are fol- lowed by top crops in succession crop- ping, and top crops by root crops. More tomatoes may be planted instead of egg- plant and peppers- -and so on. Important Pests on Vegetables, and Their Control Aphids, on cabbage, melons, tomatoes, broccoli: nicotine spray or malathion dust. Cabbage worms, on cabbage, broccoli: rotenone spray or dust. Cutworms, on tomato seedlings: paper collars around stems, extending 2 inches below soil surface. Flea beetles, on cabbage, peppers, toma- toes: rotenone spray or dust. DDT.

Mexican bean beetles, on beans: rotenone spray or dust, or methoxychlor, on both sides of leaves. Squash borers, on squash: slit stem, kill borers, mound soil over wound. 26 S in yrr When in full bloom, nothing is quite so impressive as a broad border of iris combined with perennials which flower at the same time GARDEN IRIS Clara May Frederick EVERY gardener lias definite likes and dislikes which are taken into consider- ation when planning the garden. Regard- less of this, the first thing to decide, when selecting iris, is the way they are to be used. In other words, are they intended for exhibition, landscaping effect, color at a particular time, or perhaps to create a special garden picture? Iris of all kinds are most effective when I grown in clumps. Usually it takes at least three roots or rhizomes to make an effec- i tive dump. Spaced a foot apart, they j will make a colorful clump the first year, I or by spacing them 2 feet apart, an effec- tive clump will result by the second year after planting. When many varieties are needed to fill a given space, the cost of obtaining enough plants to make an immediate show might be prohibitive. In this case, choose the better kinds, plant them for whatever color you can get at first, and by the third year the clumps will be ready for dividing and replanting. Then, there will be enough divisions from each original plant to make a big clump of each one. Most iris troubles are the result of im- proper culture. First of all, iris needs good drainage, and even though a few types, such as the Japanese, can be grown near water, they should still be planted on elevated soil well above the water line. Tall bearded iris, particularly, rot in perpetu- ally moist soil. Iris require full sunlight, too, to make the best growth, sturdy stalks, and dis- ease-free rhizomes. Crowding other plants around the base of iris encourages dis- eases and iris borer. Overfeeding produces soft growth which is very susceptible to root rots. It is safer McFarland 1. Above left. Dwarf iris are the earliest 2. Above right. Intermediate type conies next. CONTINUOUS BLOOM to add humus and plant food to the soil before planting, which is done usually from July to September. Then only light feeding early each succeeding spring is necessary. The spring clean-up of last year’s old : foliage will go a long way toward con- 1 trolling diseases and pests. Since this i refuse carries disease spores and insect eggs, burn it or otherwise remove it from the garden. Iris borer spray, containing DDT, is Y under werth from Monkmeyer How to Divide Iris Above.

Abrahamson i FEW roses require pampering to pro- duce a splendid show of blooms. But, to insure maximum performance, be pre- pared to maintain a regular schedule of watering, feeding, and dusting or spray- ing, to keep the plants growing vigorously and free of diseases and pests. There are several classes of roses, all useful, that will grow well wherever the soil is well drained, and where they can get at least four hours of sunlight a day (preferably in the morning). They must be out of range of competing roots from near-by shrubs and trees. Here are typical ways to utilize roses. Species and shrub types are ideal for filling gaps in the shrub border. As ground covers, use ramblers or creeping varieties such as Little Compton Creeper, Wichuraiana and Max Graf. Cover walls, fences, lattice or arches with repeat- blooming climbers. In the rock garden, use the charming miniatures which are currently coming into high favor, both for the garden and as winter house plants. Low-growing floribundas quickly develop into compact, ever-blooming plants suit- able to plant in borders or as a low hedge. Hybrid teas and grandifloras are striking either as specimen plants among annuals and perennials, or set in beds by them- selves. For a formal effect, or to enjoy something unusual, plant one or more hy- brid teas which have been grafted onto a sturdy understock to produce a tree rose.* The final choice of varieties, of course, will be governed by your preferences for fragrance, color and the use of the flowers *For a more complete discussion of rose varieties, rose types, and liow to use them, | refer to the Handbook on Roses, published by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Transplant an old hybrid tea when it is dormant, in early spring preferably. Set plant in hole large enough to spread roots Refill with good top soil, pressing soil in between the roots as each shovelful is added, until hole is nearly level full How to Transplant a Rose Bush Then, firm soil around the roots, so that the plant is well anchored.

Roses may be planted at almost any time except in winter. Bare-root plants Boundary post-and-rail fences are an ideal I place for a display of climbing roses F. S. Lincoln are generally “in season” from November until April. You can get them locally or from mail order nurseries. Most of the latter send colorful catalogs on request once or twice a year. If you do not see their advertising, ask the American Rose Society* to send you a list. If the growing season has begun before you think about buying your rose plants, it is best to get potted plants from a local nurseryman where one may select them while they are growing and blooming. Planting Methods The actual planting operation is much like that for any other deciduous shrub. Put bare-root plants in water as soon as they are obtained, and plant them within the next 24 hours if possible. Dig a hole deep and wide enough to hold the roots without bending them upwards. Mix a cup of superphosphate and a shovelful of organic matter (peatmoss, compost or well-rotted cow manure, etc.) deeply into the soil in the bottom of the hole. Make a mound of top soil in the center of the hole and fit the bare-root crown on it until the bud union (the knob where the main stem and branches join) is about at ground level; spread the roots down the side of the mound. Cover the roots with top soil. Tramp the soil firmly around the roots and fill the rest of the hole with water to work out any air pockets that may be left. After the water settles, fill the rest of the hole with soil and build a mound about 8 inches high around the stems. After the leaf buds begin to sprout, remove this protective mound. Next, put a 3-inch-deep mulch of peat moss, ground corn cobs, buckwheat hulls, sawdust or another similar ma- terial over the top of the beds to help conserve water, keep the ground cool, cut weed growth and to some extent prevent diseases from spreading by keeping water from splashing. Sprinkle fertilizer con- taining nitrogen on top of this layer, to help it decay and to counteract loss of * American Rose Society, 4048 Roselea Place, Columbus 14, Ohio. plant food taken from the soil by decay- ing mulch. Start regular spraying or dusting (either method is effective) as soon as growth begins. A mixture (which you can buy) containing Captan (for black- spot), Karathane (for mildew), Aramite (for mites) and Malathion (for insects) has worked well in recent years. New chemicals constantly appear on the mar- ket, however, and your garden store may carry a better combination suited to your particular area. Apply it faithfully once a week, regardless of whether or not there are signs of damage. When some diseases appear, often it is too late to cure them. If you prefer to dust, do it in the evening when dew will help it stick better. If you spray, get out early in the morning so that the sun will dry it as soon as possible. Cover both the upper and lower leaf surfaces thoroughly. Remove and destroy any spotted leaves as soon as they appear. Watering- and Feeding To water roses properly, attach a soil- soaking device to the garden hose and give the beds about an inch of water. Do not use sprinklers which will wash off protective dusts or sprays and spread disease in splashing water drops. Repeat this operation once a week during the growing season. Give each newly-planted rose a light feeding (about one handful) of a well- balanced fertilizer (like a 5-10-5) after the first blooming period is over. Start feeding established bushes (in the garden one year or more) earlier — as soon as spring pruning is finished and before they start to grow. Give three feedings during spring and summer, unless you are using the newly-introduced ureaform fertilizers which need to be applied only once each year (in the spring) to supply all the nitrogen that a plant needs for the entire season. Cut off faded blooms just above the top five-leaflet leaf on the stem. You can cut longer-stemmed flowers for in- 37 McFarlanti Dusting. Direct rose dust (and spray too) up under leaves so that both leaf surfaces get covered. Dust when air is still, as in the evening. Apply pesticide every ten days or so Feeding. Hybrid teas, floribundas and ever- blooming climbers can be fed three times a year — early spring, as they first flower, and in late summer. Use a rose fertilizer TIPS ON ROSE CARE door use from established plants, but al- ways leave at least two five-leaflet leaves since new slioots will develop from the buds at their base. After the second killing frost forecasts the approach of winter, strip any re- maining leaves from each plant and de- stroy them. Cut back tall canes enough to keep them from whipping in the wind and loosening the roots. Then tie the canes together. If the ground freezes solid in your area, bring in enough soil from another part of the garden to hill up an 8-inch mound around the base of each bush. After the first of the year, lay old Christmas tree branches on top of the beds. This will keep the ground frozen during any winter thaws, and prevent heaving which could injure roots. As soon as the danger of killing frosts is past and buds begin to swell, limber up your pruning shears and remove all dead, diseased and weak stems. Cut back until you find white wood clear to the pith of each cane. Remove all wood one-quarter inch above an out-facing bud to produce an upright bush, or above an in-facing bud to induce a sprawling variety to make a compact plant. Paint all cut sur- faces with orange shellac, or cover them with tree paints to keep boring insects out. There is no substitute for a regular spraying or dusting, watering and fer- tilizing program, if you want to succeed with roses. Other plants will prosper under the same care, too.

Color selection is endless, and choice of varieties is based often on per- sonal likes in this respect. There are several devices that anyone can use to extend the period of bloom from gladiolus, and so have a colorful garden all summer. One way is to select varieties that bloom at different times. The better catalogues indicate the season in two different ways. One is to list the number of days, on the average, it takes a variety to bloom after planting. The other is to designate the flowering season, from “early” to “late.” In general, the small-flowered types bloom earlier than the large-flowered. Another scheme is to plant both smaller and larger sized conns at the same time. The large ones bloom ahead of the small- er ones. Many gladiolus growers sell different sized conns of a variety, and any conn measuring about three-quarters of an inch or more across will bloom easily. Still another plan is to make several plantings two weeks apart, of a variety, beginning as soon as the weather is settled in spring. Gladiolus do not require special soil to flower well. Heavy clay soil is the least desirable ; at the other extreme, sandy soil to which humus has been added gives ex- cellent results. The site should be sunny and protected from strong winds. Gladiolus may be planted in rows for cutting or planted in groups among low-growing annuals and perennials. Grown in rows, make a trench or trough with a hoe or shovel, about. 5 inches deep. Sprinkle only enough garden fertilizer along the bottom to barely whiten the soil. Mix this into the bottom soil before placing the conns about 6 inches apart. Cover with 5 inches of soil. Label the row with the variety name. Light feed- ing may be done when the plants are half-grown, but regular watering, and mulching to control weeds, are of greater aid to getting good bloom. Both small- and large-flowered types are effective when planted in groups in the garden. The heaviest flowered stalks may need support to keep them straight and erect; the small ones rarely need staking. Thrips is the principle pest, and to con- trol it, begin spraying with a DDT mixture when the plants are a foot or so high, and continue every week or so until the buds are fully formed. Any plants which develop stunted or yellow leaves, and do not bloom, are diseased and should Gladiolus grown for cutting are best planted in rows 2% feet apart. When cutting stalks, let the bottom leaves stay on plant ! be pulled up and destroyed to keep the disease from spreading. Classification Method The catalogues of firms that specialize in gladiolus bulbs can be confusing to anyone who is not familiar with the methods used to list and describe varie- ties. However, once the system is under- stood, then the catalogues become a source of considerable useful information. To assist gardeners in knowing the size and color of gladiolus blooms, and to help those who exhibit at flower shows, a numerical system has been devised. It is a three-digit system, and the number 520, for example, may appear after the variety name in a catalogue. This is how to interpret it : The first number of the three digits identifies its size, i.e., 500 indicates a giant size flower, 5^2 inches or more across. The entire size range can therefore be indicated by these symbols. Classification by size 100 — flowers below 2 x/i inches across. Miniature 200 — 2V2 through 3Y± inches. Small 300 — 3Y2 through 4 14 inches. Medium 400 — I1/! to 5V2 inches. Large 500 — 51/2 inches and over. Giant Classification by color The next two digits indicate color, the smallest numbers being for lighter colors or tones, with the colors deepening as the numbers get larger. “Markings” sim- ply denote blotches or areas of a second color in the heart of the flower. 00 — White without conspicuous mark- ings 01 — White with markings 14 — Light yellow 15 — Deep yellow 20 — Buff 24 — Light orange 26 — Deep orange 30 — Light salmon 32 — Deep salmon 36 — Scarlet 40 — Light pink 42 — Medium pink 44 — Deep pink 50 — Light red 52 — Deep red 54 — Black red 60 — Light rose 62 — Medium rose 64 — Deep rose 66 — Lavender 70 — Purple 76 — Light violet 78 — Deep violet 80 — Smoky shades 90 — Any other color Guide to Reliable Gladiolus — by Color Gladiolus varieties number in the thou- sands, and for this reason many people find it difficult to select a few kinds for their gardens. The following list groups some of the finest inexpensive varieties by color and here is a chance to practice on the classification numbers that indi- cate size of bloom and color intensity.

Ries HOUSE plants, like babies and pets, require regular attention, and the more regularly they get it the better they will grow. The basic requirements of plants differ, one with another. The des- erts, jungles, fields, woods and mountains of the world have furnished the great variety of plants we grow indoors and in greenhouses. To succeed with them, we must supply conditions of soil, tem- perature, light, humidity and soil moisture that are similar to what they had in their natural habitat. This is not always easy in the hot dry atmosphere and insufficient light of homes. There is the added prob- lem of maintaining proper conditions in small containers. Temperature. Most house plants do best at 70 degrees or slightly higher in daytime and at approximately 60 degrees at night. This is true of African violets, begonias, marantas, and other tropical plants. On the other hand, some plants I require cooler t e m p eratures of not over 60 degrees in daytime and 50 de- grees at night. Included in this group are azaleas, cyclamen, primroses and other non-tropieal plants. Temperatures higher than normal tend to make plants soft, leggy and less attrac- I five, and flowering plants may have few or no blooms. On the other hand, temper- atures that are too low will stunt plant growth. Light often is the major limiting factor in growing house plants. Some require Often the simplest arrangements of house plants are the most effective. These plants frame window nicely, still get enough light G o ttsc ho-Schle is ner more light than others, and most plants will grow better if we give them more light even though they survive with less. During the winter months, when the in- tensity of sunlight is less, it is often ad- visable to move plants nearer windows. African violets are sensitive to being moved from one location to another. Giving them more light, especially in winter, will often bring them into bloom. During the summer some plants' sun- scorch if given full sun, as, for example, African violets. Most tropical foliage plants, although they may grow in full sun, will nevertheless scorch if taken from indoors directly out into full sun. Most plants, except cacti and succulents native to desert areas, require higher humidity than usually is maintained in homes. Since few homes have adequate humidifying systems, it is necessary to produce greater humidity in the vicinity \\ i i ! * 1 ' U L Am 4 Mr 43 Watson from Monkmeyer Leaves for propagating should be cut care- Leaf cuttings are now set in coarse vermicu- fully, with sharp knife, from healthy plant lite for rooting. Parent plant is unharmed HOW TO PROPAGATE AFRICAN VIOLETS of the plants. This is done by placing pans or trays of water, moist pebbles, sand or peat moss beneath the pots. Do not let the pots stand in water as the roots would be damaged. Instead, set the pots on bricks, blocks of wood, inverted pots or saucers or on gravel. The window sill above the kitchen sink often has a higher humidity. For orchids and other plants requiring high humidity, a small area may be enclosed with plastic or even glass. If in a window, be sure that the enclosure is adequately heated. Watering. Some pots may need water- ing every day, and most plants at least every other day. Daily checking is good insurance. Keep the soil moist at all times but not muddy. When soil dries out until it is powdery, even if for only one day, tlie fine roots and root hairs die. The plant cannot start growing again until a new set of tiny roots is formed. Most desert plants, such as cactus, need not be watered more than two or three times per week. Any water can be used if it is fit to drink. It is rare that the chemicals in water systems cause damage to plants. Never allow potted plants to set in | saucers or pans of water for more than , an hour or so. Large porous clay pots I that are difficult to water may be placed in a pail of water for as much as 10 to 15 minutes to thoroughly soak them. The temperature of water used usually is not important, except that water colder than room temperature will discolor the leaves of African violets, gloxinias and similar house plants, if put directly on them. Soil. The soil used for potted plants should be specially prepared. For most plants mix: 1 part leaf mold or peat moss 2 parts soil, preferably garden loam 1 level teaspoon complete fertilizer to each quart of soil mix Use 4-12-8, 4-12-4, 6-10-4 or similar fertilizer. If a stronger fertilizer is used, such as 20-20-20, then reduce the amount to one level teaspoon to 3 quarts j of soil. 44 Above left. Cutting is ready to pot when roots have formed and a new plant has started at the base of the stem Above right. Use a pot about 2% inches across for each cutting. Set the cutting at slant, giving young plant space to grow Right. Most cuttings produce a cluster of young plants instead of a single crown. When they reach this size, divide them Bottom right. Several single-crown plants, now potted individually, have come from one cutting. Each will make a good plant Gottscho-Schleisner For woodland plants, such as begonias, ferns, African violets, use : 1 part leaf mold or peat moss 1 part sand 2 parts soil Use fertilizer as recommended above. Always sift soil through a ^4-inch screen to take out coarse fragments. Fertilization. Give plants fertilizer at least every two months from March through October. Do not fertilize during the winter months when there is not sufficient sunshine to enable the plants to make use of the nutrients. Any reliable brand of fertilizer may be used, such as 45 Agrico, Vigoro or other complete fertil- izer. Apply at the rate of *4 teaspoon to a 4-inch pot — less for a smaller one, more for a larger one. With soluble fertilizers, follow instructions on the container. Soluble or regular fertilizers are equally satisfactory, if they supply nitrogen, phosphorus and potash. Bone- meal furnishes no potash; liquid manure contains only nitrogen. Liquid fertilizers are watered on the surface of the soil, while dry materials are scratched into the surface of the soil in the pot, and watered in. Containers. House plants can be grown in a wide variety of pots and containers. They may be glass, wood, plastic, metal, concrete, glazed or unglazed ceramic ma- terial or old-fashioned red clay. Be sure the irnts have drainage holes. For non- porous containers, such as glass or plastic, add somewhat more sand to the soil mix- ture to provide good root aeration. Usually plants are put in containers that are just large enough to hold the roots. However, the smaller the pot the more frequent will be the need for water and fertilization. Repotting is done only as the size of plant, from the esthetic viewpoint, re- quires it. Otherwise regular fertilization will balance the lack of more soil. Re- potting usually is to a pot one inch larger in diameter. Standard pots have the same depth as diameter. Many plants do not need so much soil and are grown in shallower pots or “pans” — (they are clay, even if called “pans”). These are now available in all sizes. When repotting, put a piece of broken flower pot over the drainage hole to pre- vent the soil from clogging it. Remove some of the soil from the top and bottom of the ball, replace this with fresh soil, put in the bottom of the pot, and press soil around the roots to within a half inch of the top. Repotting may be done whenever the plants are not in active growth. This will vary with each kind. Some prefer to do repotting just before putting plants outdoors for the summer. Summer care.

An unusual variegated creeping fig which has been trained here against cork bark on plants when friends and neighbors must take care of them. Try putting all plants, even African violets, outdoors. Most plants will need some protection from sun so place them in the shade of a building, tree or shrub. Plunge the pots to their tops in the soil. To prevent dam- age to the foliage by slugs, use a pre- pared bait or dust with Snailicide at least every two weeks. Water several times a week using a rose nozzle or other spray to reduce the force of the water and so prevent damage to the foliage. Plants that can be given full sun in- clude cactus and succulents but even they should be exposed gradually by shading with cloth or paper except for an hour or two, the first few days. They have to be gradually hardened to the sun just as we do when we go to the beach. In early autumn, all tender plants should be brought indoors before night temperatures go down below 60 degrees. Azaleas can be left out until after a freeze. Planter boxes attached to houses, either indoors or out, are a problem. Contractors generally fill them with the worst sort of soil. Indoors they are either in front of windows where the soil gets too cold for growth of tropical plants, or are in such dark places that Genereux 47 it is difficult to grow anything. The present trend to fill planters with soil- less mixes (such as vermiculite) does not help since the materials used seldom con- tain any nutrients. However, regular fertilization is needed, whether the plant- ing boxes contain soil or a soil-substitute. Some plants can be grown in water alone, although a pinch of complete ferti- lizer once a month will give more healthy growth. To keep down algae in the water, use a colored glass or opaque con- tainer. Actually, the algae are harmless, but the green slimy appearance is not attractive. For water culture, try grape ivy, English ivy, Chinese evergreen {Aglaonema) , philodendron, pothos, nephthytis, wandering Jew, Japanese spurge, and coleus Border Queen, sweet potato, German or parlor ivy. Common House Plant Troubles White cottony masses on the stems and leaves are an insect, mealy bug. None of the common sprays are effective. Wash off with a detergent on a soft brush. Alcohol on a bit of cotton on a tooth pick or a small tipped water-color brush, ap- plied to each mass', will kill them. Then dust or spray plants every two or three weeks with DDT or malathion. Grayish or brownish leaves may be due to spider mites which are barely visible to the naked eye. Use malathion, but keep DDT away. Sticky stems and leaves may be due to plant lice (aphis) which are easily killed by aerosol sprays containing rotenone. Scale insects also leave sticky residue. Scrub off with finger nail brush and de- tergent. Then dust or spray with DDT to kill any crawlers that you missed or which may have hatched from eggs. Leaves turning yellow and dropping may be due to improper watering, either too much or too little, or to plants standing in water. Plants that, are tall and spindly are probably suffering from lack of sufficient sunlight. Sometimes, also, from overdoses of fertilizer. Gardenia lea res yellowing usually is due to lack of sufficient soil acidity. Insuffi- cient nitrogen will cause similar symptoms. Also, repotting later than September will produce the same results. For lack of acid, give one-half cup a month of solution of alum or iron sulfate, made with one table- spoon to one quart of water. Bud drop during winter is normal. Poinsettia leaves yellowing and drop- ping is due either to chilling or a lack of sufficient water or sunlight. Christmas cactus flower buds dropping probably is caused by over-watering. African violet leaves ^wilting usually is due to over-watering, or from salts ac- cumulated on edge of clay pots. Flowers dropping is due to illuminating gas in air. Amaryllis not blooming usually is the result of insufficient foliage and lack of adequate growth during the previous sum- mer. Plant bulbs directly in the ground outdoors in full sun as soon as weather warms in spring and leave them there un- til the first frost in fall. Pot up and take indoors. Cyclamen leaves yellowing may be due to lack of water, lack of sunlight or high temperature. They need water every day. Edges of leaves turning brown usually is due to improper watering, either too much, too little or too irregularly. Rex begonias have richly marbled leaf pat- terns in many colors from silver to burg- undy. They grow well in north windows Singer 48 FORESIGHT IN PLANTING How to plan a peaceful, distinctive garden with interesting pictures and vistas — without too much work Alfred C. Hottes EVERYONE desires to live in a gar- dened home of which lie can be proud. The most modest' house and even the house of poor architecture can be com- pletely transformed by a simple plant- ing. How can the planting be properly started f The best way for a beginner is to hire a competent landscape architect who has devoted his life to the study of plants and knows just how tall each one grows, how coarse or fine its texture, and how adaptable it is to soils, wind, and mois- ture. Competent nurserymen also know most of these facts and are willing to advise. If the homeowner is to do all the plan- ning and work himself, he must make frequent trips of observation. He must study the grouping of shrubs and trees in parks and botanic gardens, along the streets, and in the yards of his friends. If he makes notes on the plantings that please him, he is more likely to buy wise- ly. He will be making a picture, using plants instead of paint. The poorest way of landscaping the home grounds is to look through a nurs- ery catalog without a plan in mind and then blindly choose plants without know- ing how many the place will accommodate. The usual home gardener becomes a hopeless inebriate when he visits a nurs- ery or scans a catalog. It is a common practice for persons to plant everything the neighbors will give them; and some believe that as long as there is a square foot of soil not covered by some form of vegetation there is still room for a giant forest tree. It is only the extremely abstemious home buyer who can resist planting an apple, a pear, a plum, a peach, and a gr-ape vine in his back yard, for they all look so innocent when young. If they all grow, the result is usually a hopeless hodgepodge of insect-ridden plants, for it would take a very experienced gardener to spray them all properly and keep them in healthy condition. Planting too many fruit trees eliminates the possibility of having any choice flowering annuals, per- ennials, or shrubs; and the planting be- comes so unsatisfactory that the garden- er soon loses his interest in gardening. He would be overworked if he took prop- er care of all his fruits, and dissatisfied with the disorder if he neglected them. A weed is a plant out of place. Any plant put into the ground and not placed properly is a weed, even though it is a fifty-dollar magnolia tree put into the usual dollar hole. Most jmople bring home new plants after every foray upon their friends’ gardens; then they begin to wonder where to put this loot. This article cannot go into details about the planting of the home grounds but it can outline a few general suggestions. Keep the Planting- Simple If the garden needs six plants of one kind, do not buy thirty others for which there is no place. Staggering figures could be compiled on the money wasted in unwise planting every year. Make a Plan Before Planting- Have an idea in mind. Do not dash around the yard planting hit and miss as if the shrubs and trees were dropped from an airplane. Keep the new trees and 49 shrubs in a wheelbarrow until the place for each one is evident, to complete a carefully thought-out picture. The plants are much easier to move in the wheel- barrow than when they are well rooted in the ground. Make One Picture at a Time Do first things first. Set off the door- ways with appropriate plants. Hide unsightly views. Enhance beautiful vis- tas. Remember that Plants Grow Everyone expects and wants plants to grow, yet few persons visualize the final effect. The average person shops for bar- gains, purchasing young trees to plant in front of the house; and ivhen these grow rapidly into forest-size trees, the buyer is disappointed and complains to the nurseryman that his place has become a hopeless jungle. Some persons consider it a bargain to buy an inexpensive vine and plant it where it will hide good archi- tecture. Plan for Both Enclosure and Spaciousness Plant the lot so that the garden is part of the house, with rooms, windows, and space. Begin the planting at the margins of the property, to achieve enclosure for peace and quiet; but do this adroitly so that there is no feeling of being smoth- ered by the walls. If the lot has no view, make one. From the principal windows or doors make a path leading to a garden feature — a fountain, a pool, a seat, a well branched picturesque tree. Strive for Pleasing Forms and Lines Flat surfaces give a feeling of peace but they may become monotonous; undu- lating lines give rhythm to the landscape. The perfect globe form to which some shrubs are pruned is a disturbing element in the landscape. A pyramid is the most exalting form; but a series of pyramids reminds one of a coarse-toothed saw. It is like the forbidding wall with bits of bro- ken bottles stuck into the concrete; yet many persons are insensitive to this and plant the foundations of their homes with a serried row of pyramidal conifers. It is true, however, that attractive group- ings of three or five clustered pyramids can be made to give the effect of one. Make the Planting Interesting How to achieve an interesting garden is in each person’s hands as an artist or an innovator. A surprise of some sort makes a planting more interesting; but do not litter the yard with rows of strange rocks, toy ducks, and windmills. The gar- den should be peaceful and should not be filled with objects that do not belong there. Plan So as to Avoid Too Much Work Attempting too much always brings disappointment. It is better to have a patio planned with charm than a thou- sand-acre estate that is a wilderness of weedy beds and disheveled lawns. Shrubs and trees take the minimum of care — water, feeding several times a year, an all-purpose spraying less than once a month, and a little snipping now and then. Annuals are much more work; they need to be sown from seed; they are in- clined to be crowded by weeds, and soon they must be replanted to avoid a yawn- ing gap in the landscape. Make the Planting Distinctive Gardens cannot be all alike, for some people like lilacs while others prefer azaleas. One likes formality and pre- ciseness, another likes the winsome ways of Nature. Someone is provoked if he hasn’t masses of color at all seasons of the year; he is, therefore, delighted with zinnias, Avhile someone else is happy only if he is trying to grow a rare species of rock plant. No, gardens will never be sold by the gross. People are not alike. Study the Plants One who wishes to do good planting must know the plants and their habits. An interest in plants is an abiding one. Don’t lose heart at the number of trees and shrubs in the nurseries. 50 Part II — Garden Practices HOW TO DIAGNOSE GARDEN TROUBLES Victor H. Ries BEFORE any garden problem can be corrected, or plant damage pre- vented or controlled, it is necessary to know the cause. Sometimes this is very evident, but more often it is not. In the latter case, expert help is needed which can be had from county agents of your state agricultural service, some garden centers, botanical gardens and profes- sional horticulturists. Unfortunately, all too few local salesmen handling pest con- trol materials are trained diagnosticians, or even experienced gardeners. In any case, no one can prescribe a cure without seeing the damaged plant, the pest that causes it or, in some cases, without having a soil analysis. The Causes of Trouble Before blaming an insect pest or dis- ease, cheek the following possible causes, one or more of which may be to blame. The soil. H as it been properly pre- pared by adding at least 5 per cent organic matter? Has sufficient fertilizer been applied to maintain adequate growth ? If not, growth may be stunted. Has too much fertilizer been used so that the roots have been damaged? This may produce scorched edges on leaves, and in more severe cases the plants wilt and die. Putting fertilizer in the bot- tom of a hole without thoroughly mixing it with the soil before setting in the plant is a common cause of damage. Applying more fertilizer than recom- mended on the package may injure plants. Letting fertilizer stay on the foliage may burn it. Always wash or shake off any fertilizer that falls on the foliage. Acid-soil plants, such as azaleas and rhododendrons, will have yellowish leaves with darker veins and few if any flowers if the soil is not sufficiently acid. In some localities, but not nearly as many as suspected, the soil may be too acid so that most plants will be stunted and sickly looking. Liming will correct the situation. In the same way, soils that are too alkaline because of over-liming or which are naturally alkaline, as in some western states, may stunt and even kill some kinds of plants. Wherever soils are naturally alkaline one should grow mostly lime-tolerant plants. How- ever, such plants as azaleas and oleanders can be grown in alkaline soil treated with iron chelates such as Sequestrene. Soil moisture is often a limiting factor. More often an excess of water causes the trouble. Lack of moisture is often a problem where either competing roots absorb moisture or it cannot fall natur- ally, as under trees and shrubs, beneath over-hanging eaves, between buildings and in sandy soils. Artificial watering must be done more frequently under such conditions. Sunlight is necessary for plant growth. Some plants require all-day sun to thrive. 51 Without it they may not bloom or grow as well as they should. On the other hand, some plants cannot stand full sun and must be given protection, and they, along with shade-tolerant plants, are best used in shade plantings. (See lists on pp. 15, 90) Climate. All too often we try to grow plants that are not adapted to our climate and although they may survive a few years, in less congenial seasons they may be damaged. For example, the evergreen magnolia of the South is being grown in many places in the North where it is never likely to live to a ripe old age. Many azaleas now being shipped from the South to northern gardens may also prove to be tender. Temperature is often a limiting factor. Low winter temperatures will damage or kill plants that are not completely hardy. This damage may not be apparent until early summer, as is often the case with roses and broad-leaved evergreens. Sudden drops in temperature, especially in the fall before plants are sufficiently hardened, may damage them. High sum- mer temperatures will restrict growth of some plants, whereas cold summers will limit the growth of more tropical plants, many annual flowers, and such vege- tables as corn, melons, squash and toma- toes. Wind is sometimes a limiting factor. Broadleaf evergreens and some needled evergreens (hemlocks) may be so dried by wind that the leaves scorch. The corners of a house, the narrow place between buildings, wind-exposed hilltops and open country are likely places for wind prob- lems. Wind hitting a building and bounc- ing back may cause more damage than normal. All wind damage is usually worse on young plants before they have become well established. Chemicals. Over-doses of chemicals used in the control of insects and diseases may damage the foliage. When the tem- perature is over 85°, many dusts and sprays will burn even when used at the recommended strengths. Sulfur is espe- cially dangerous to plants when the temperature is over 85° F. Another unexpected source of trouble is from careless use of weed control chemicals. Many of these are difficult to remove from the sprayer, so a separate sprayer is advisable. The drift of herbi- side dust or spray onto particularly | sensitive plants may do more harm to them than to the weeds themselves. The use of fly and mosquito sprays In preparing spray mix- tures, add the measured amount of pesticide to a small amount of wat- er first. Stir until thor- oughly mixed. Then pour into spray tank, add water to proper level, agitate before and during spraying Rnrhe 52 containing oil is almost sure to burn some plants. Insects pests are sometimes easily seen but all too often they are not visible. Seedlings disappearing, holes in leaves and flower buds eaten may indicate that slugs are working at night. Stems cut off near the ground may he the work of cutworms which hide in the soil by day. Stunted plants may be caused by root aphis. Since the control of insects is a broad subject it would be well to consult authoritative garden books and also the \"Handbook on Plant Pests and Diseases,” published by the Brooklyn Garden. Plant diseases may be caused by a specific parasite as well as by unfavor- able growing conditions. Diseases on the surface of a plant are easy to see and diagnose. But all too often the disease organism is in the inner tissues of the plant or on the roots where it is not easy to observe. This usually calls for professional help to diagnose the cause and prescribe a control. Equipment for pest control The gardener can take his choice be- tween spraying and dusting. Dusting is usually easier and quicker although dusts are not likely to be as effective as proper- ly applied sprays. The home gardener seldom has the equipment to do a really good spraying job. The most efficient sprayer should give at least 100 lbs. pres- sure, have a 5- to 10-f'oot hose, a 3- to 6- foot spray rod and a nozzle with an elbow. Small knapsack sprayers, although convenient, do not meet these specifica- tions. Small hand atomizers are neither efficient nor effective for more than a house plant or two. Dust guns of one or two quart capacity are easy to operate, relatively inexpen- sive and long lasting. Larger models with bellows or with cranks are available for use in larger gardens. Precautions to follow in pest control 1. Cover all parts of plants, especially undersides of leaves. 2. Do not dust or spray when plant is wilted. 3. Do not dust or spray when temper- ature is over 85°, particularly in direct sun. 4. Do not mix different dusts or sprays unless recommended by manufac- turer. 5. Measure all amounts accurately; overdose may damage plants. 6. Keep all pest control materials labeled, out of reach of children. Light - weight dusters are now available which greatly simplify the task of caring for roses and other flowers. This one holds about one pound of dust ; blower is operated with crank. At least 20 rose bushes can be dusted with one filling Gottscho-Schleisner Oo 7. Use soap or detergent in sprays if recommended. These are “spread- ers.” 8. Prepare all spray mixtures fresh before using. 9. Wash sprayer thoroughly "
