        "text": "Welcome to Gardening in South Africa!\n\nOn this website you will find not ‘only’ flowers of incredible beauty, but also handy hints on how to grow and nurture them, how to protect them without poisoning plant life and the myriad of creepy crawlies that are part of their symbiotic circle.\n\nGardening in South Africa will also guide you on how to plant vegetables, herbs and other yummy things to enhance a healthy diet. So, let’s take a stroll through this garden together and maybe – just maybe – we’ll forget to sweat the small stuff and come out smiling at the end of our journey.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson once said “The earth laughs in flowers”. I couldn’t agree more and I have dedicated 40 years of my life to do justice to Emerson’s brilliant words of wisdom and this website is the culmination of a lifelong study of all things growing."
