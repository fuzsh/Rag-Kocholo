Evaluation criteria categories include: average Science Citation Index (Impact Factor, Immediacy Index, Total citations) rankings from 1987 to 1992; citation source counts of multiple “core” biomedical informatics publications; a questionnaire sent to American College of Medical Informatics Fellows; publication delay; distinguishing characteristics (e. g., subscription cost, total circulation, year established, places indexed, affiliation with a professional society, major biomedical resource library holdings); and the total number of interlibrary loan requests to the U. S. National Library of Medicine. The top serials were Computers and Biomedical Research, MD Computing, Methods of Information in Medicine, Medical Decision Making and Computers in Biology and Medicine.\n\nKim, Edward Kangsuhp, William James Fletcher, and Clark Timothy Johnson. \"Effect of Increasing Malpractice Insurance Cost and Subsequent Practice of Defensive Medicine on Out-of-Hospital Birth Rates in the United States.\" American Journal of Perinatology 36, no. 07 (October 29, 2018): 723–29. http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1675156.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nBackground Across the United States, the burden of malpractice litigation has influenced obstetricians and obstetric institutions to avoid high-risk patients, favor cesarean delivery, and decrease availability of trial of labor after cesarean. Recently, the United States has experienced an increase in out-of-hospital (OOH) births. Objective The main purpose of this article is to investigate the association between malpractice insurance premium (MIP) and OOH births in the United States from 2000 to 2014. Study Design We analyzed changes in OOH birth rates and MIP from 2000 to 2014 using birth data from the National Vital Statistics System and Medical Liability Monitor's annual survey, respectively. The change in OOH birth rates was then compared with the change in MIP. Results Between 2000 and 2014, there has been approximately 60% increase in MIP from national average of $40,949 to $65,210 (p < 0.05). OOH births increased 57% from 39,398 births to 59,674 births (p < 0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between increase in MIP and increase in OOH births (p < 0.05, R 2 = 0.14). Conclusion MIP and OOH birth rates have a significantly associated increase from 2000 to 2014. Given that malpractice climate affects other aspects of obstetric practice, we cautiously propose that increasing MIP may be associated with an increase in OOH births.\n\nPrewitt, Kenneth. \"The 2012 Morris Hansen Lecture: Thank You Morris, et al., For Westat, et al.\" Journal of Official Statistics 29, no. 2 (September 1, 2013): 223–31. http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jos-2013-0018.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nAbstract This article, delivered as the 22nd Memorial Morris Hansen lecture, argues that the contract houses, typified by Westat, are uniquely situated in the cluster of institutions, practices, and principles that collectively constitute a bridge between scientific evidence on the one hand and public policy on the other. This cluster is defined in The Use of Science as Evidence in Public Policy as a policy enterprise that generates a form of social knowledge on which modern economies, policies, and societies depend (National Research Council 2012). The policy enterprise in the U. S. largely took shape in the first half of the twentieth century, when sample surveys and inferential statistics matured into an information system that provided reliable and timely social knowledge relevant to the nation’s policy choices. In ways described shortly, Westat and other social science organizations that respond to “request for proposals” (RFP) from the government for social data and social analysis came to occupy a unique niche. The larger question addressed is whether the policy enterprise as we know it is prepared for the tsunami beginning to encroach on its territory. Is it going to be swamped by a data tsunami that takes information from very different sources than the familiar census/survey methods?\n\nKondracki, Anthony J., Wei Li, Zoran Bursac, Manouchehr Mokhtari, Bonzo Reddick, and Jennifer L.

We used data of participants with singleton live births (N = 3,418,028) from the 2019 United States National Vital Statistics System. There were 280,206 participants in the PTB group and 3,137,822 in the control group, and 221,260 participants in the LBW group and 3,196,768 in the control group. Nearly 1.9% of the participants had chlamydia, 0.3% had gonorrhea, and 0.2% had syphilis. Interaction effects of STIs with PNC utilization status on the risk of PTB and LBW were tested on the multiplicative and additive scales. Using measures of the relative excess risk of interaction (RERI), the attributable proportion of interaction (AP), and the synergy index (S), we observed the highest significant synergistic interaction between syphilis and inadequate PNC utilization increasing the risk of PTB (RERI 2.12, AP 38%, and SI 1.88), and between gonorrhea and inadequate PNC utilization increasing the risk of LBW (RERI 1.03, AP 28%, and SI 1.64). Findings from this study help improve our understanding of disease etiology and inform prevention planning.\n\nPalatnik, Anna, Sarah De Cicco, Liyun Zhang, Pippa Simpson, Judith Hibbard, and Leonard E.

Study Design This was a retrospective cohort of births from the National Vital Statistics System in the United States from 2009 to 2013. Women were categorized based on four age groups at the time of delivery: 20 to 29, 30 to 34, 35 to 39, and ≥40 years old. The primary outcome of SGA < 10th and SGA < 5th percentiles was compared between the four groups using both univariable and multivariable analyses to determine whether maternal age was associated with SGA independent of parity. Results A total of 17,031,005 births were eligible for analysis, with 2,705,501 births to AMA women. In multivariable analyses, maternal age of 30 to 34, compared with 20 to 29, was associated with lower rates of SGA < 10th and <5th percentiles (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95–0.96 and aOR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.96–0.98, respectively). The AMA of 35 to 39, compared with 20 to 29, was associated with lower rates of SGA < 10th percentile and unchanged rates of SGA < 5th percentile (aOR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.96–0.98 and aOR = 1; 95% CI: 0.99–1.01, respectively). In contrast, AMA of ≥40, compared with age 20 to 29, was associated with higher rates of both SGA < 10th and <5th percentiles (aOR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.04–1.07 and aOR = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.12–1.16, respectively). A significant association was found between maternal age and parity toward the risk of SGA (p < 0.001). Nulliparous women ≥30 years old but not multiparous women had higher rates of SGA < 10th and SGA < 5th percentiles compared with nulliparous women in the age group of 20 to 29. In contrast, both nulliparous and multiparous women age ≥40 years old had an increased risk for SGA < 5th percentile compared with all women in the age group of 20 to 29. Conclusion Nulliparous women aged 30 years and older have higher risk of SGA < 10th and SGA < 5th percentiles compared with nulliparous women age 20 to 29. In contrast, both nulliparous and multiparous women age 40 years and older have an increased risk of SGA < 5th percentile compared with all women in the age group of 20 to 29.\n\nCarter, Kimbroe J., Frank Castro, and Roy N.

The determination of screen-PLL with mammography is possible using a natural history model of breast cancer that simulates clinical and pathologic events of this disease. This investigation uses a Monte Carlo Markov model with data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; American Cancer Society; and National Vital Statistics System. Populations of one million women per screening strategy are simulated over a lifetime with mammographic screening based on current guidelines of the American Cancer Society (ACS), United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), triennial screening from age 50–70, and no screening. Screen-PLL curves are generated and show guideline performance over a lifetime. The screen-PLL curve with no screening is determined by tumor discovery through clinical awareness and has the highest values of screen-PLL. The ACS and USPSTF strategies demonstrate screen-PLL curves favoring the elderly. The curve for triennial screening is more uniform than the ACS or USPSTF curves but could be improved by adding screen(s) at either end of the 50–70 age range. This study introduces the use of screen-PLL as a tool to improve the understanding of screening guidelines and allowing a more balanced allocation of life savings across an aging population. The method presented shows how screen-PLL can be used to analyze and potentially improve breast cancer screening guidelines.\n\nRomero, Fabian Andres, Evette Mathews, Ara Flores, and Susan Seo. \"Impact of an Antibiotic Stewardship Program in Long-term Care Facilities: A Nursing Home Network Experience.\" Open Forum Infectious Diseases 4, suppl_1 (2017): S63. http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofx162.150.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nAbstract Background Antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) implementation is paramount across the healthcare spectrum. Nursing homes represent a challenge due to limited resources, complexity of medical conditions, and less controlled environments. National statistics on ASP for long-term care facilities (LTCF) are sparse. Methods A pilot ASP was launched in August 2016 at a 270-bed nursing home with a 50-bed chronic ventilator-dependent unit. The program entailed a bundle of interventions including leadership engagement, a tracking and reporting system for intravenous antibiotics, education for caregivers, Infectious Disease (ID) consultant availability, and implementation of nursing protocols. Data were collected from pharmacy and medical records between January 2016 and March 2017, establishing pre-intervention and post-intervention periods. Collected data included days of therapy (DOT), antibiotic costs, resident-days, hospital transfers, and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) rates. Variables were adjusted to 1,000 resident-days (RD) and findings between periods were compared by Mann–Whitney U test. Results A total of 47,423 resident-days and 1,959 DOT were analyzed for this study. Antibiotic use decreased from 54.5 DOT/1000 RD pre-intervention to 27.6 DOT/1000 RD post-intervention (P = 0.017). Antibiotic costs were reduced from a monthly median of US $17,113 to US $7,073 but was not statistically significant (P = 0.39). Analysis stratified by individual antibiotic was done for the five most commonly used antibiotics and found statistically significant reduction in vancomycin use (14.4 vs. 6.5; P = 0.023). Reduction was also found for cefepime/ceftazidime (6.9 vs. 1.3; P = 0.07), ertapenem (6.8 vs. 3.6; P = 0.45), and piperacillin/tazobactam (1.8 vs. 0.6; P = 0.38). Meropenem use increased (1.3 vs. 3.2; P = 0.042). Hospital transfers slightly trended up (6.73 vs. 7.77; P = 0.065), and there was no change in CDI (1.1 s 0.94; P = 0.32). Conclusion A bundle of standardized interventions tailored for LTCF can achieve successful reduction of antibiotic utilization and costs. Subsequent studies are needed to further determine the impact on clinical outcomes such as transfers to hospitals and CDI in these settings.

S. population, have diabetes. High fructose intake has also been associated with increased de novo lipogenesis in the liver leading to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Emerging evidence suggests that measuring fructose, galactose, and other saccharides in addition to glucose may be helpful for diagnosis of metabolic disorders and other diseases. Therefore, there is a need for an accurate and precise laboratory method for measuring serum monosaccharide panels. Traditional monosaccharide assays used in patient care often can only quantitate one monosaccharide at a time. We aim to develop a high-throughput analytical method for simultaneous measurement of serum monosaccharides that is suitable for large scale epidemiologic studies. Our assay is based on a derivatization-free ID-LC/MS/MS procedure. Certified primary reference materials of monosaccharides from NIST (Gaithersburg, MD) were used for assay calibration. The serum samples were spiked with 13 C labeled internal standards. The monosaccharides were isolated from serum matrix by acetonitrile protein precipitation and filtration in 96-well filter plate (0.2um, porous PTFE). Aliquot of the acetonitrile filtrate was applied on an AB SCIEX Triple Quad™ 6500 LC/MS/MS system for analysis. The monosaccharides including glucose, galactose, fructose, mannose, and potential interferences were resolved from each other on Unison UK Amino column (3×250mm) eluted with acetonitrile and water gradient. Selective reaction monitoring in negative electrospray ionization mode was used for quantitation of monosaccharides in the samples. The measurement ranges covered 10–402 mg/dL for glucose, which is sufficient to monitor the serum glucose levels in normal, hypo-, and hyperglycemia patient samples. Using 4 levels of NIST SRM 965b (values assigned using GC-MS based reference measurement procedure), the method demonstrated excellent measurement accuracy of over 98% for serum glucose. The imprecision of serum glucose measurement was within 3%. Imprecision and accuracy of lower abundant serum monosaccharides were lower than 6% and above 96%, respectively. The application of 96-well format filter plate and automated liquid handler system significantly improves the throughput of sample preparation. The current analytical method can be used to simultaneously measure the concentrations levels of a panel of serum monosaccharides with appropriate accuracy and precision. Free of derivatization, simple sample procedure and application of automation system significantly improves throughput of the assay which are suitable for routine serum monosaccharides assay in clinical laboratories and for large biomonitoring studies.

This has demonstrated the importance of Geographic Information System (GIS) application in predicting and determining of site criteria for filling stations facilities development, most especially in areas where there is land uses competition which requires consumer accessibility, sustainability, environmental safety, environmentally sensitive development solutions, etc. A stratified sampling technique was used to select the sample size and administration of the questionnaire. The data collected was analyzed using descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution, bar chart, pie chart and percentage and maps showing the sampled existing filling stations in the study area. The result shows the distribution of filling stations located across the study area. This study shows that GIS and multi-criteria analysis are essential tools to assist in correct siting to national planners and decision-makers in deciding the most appropriate filling stations location pattern to apply in Minna and its environs.

S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation regarding prostate-specific antigen (PSA) transitioned to a grade D recommendation against PSA screening for adult males in 2012. The impact of this recommendation against PSA screening on prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) in contemporary cohorts is unknown. Our study evaluated PCSM between 1999-2019, comparing mortality rates before and after this change to screening guidelines. Methods: Age-adjusted PCSM rates per 100,000 men were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics from 1999 – 2019. Trends in PCSM rates from 1999 – 2012 and 2014 – 2019 were estimated using linear regression with year and binary indicator of pre-2013/post-2013 status as interaction terms. Age-adjusted rates of PCSM were calculated for men ≥50 years and by race, ethnicity, urbanization and census region. Similarly, age-adjusted rates of overall cancer mortality (exclusive of PCSM) were calculated. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System was used to establish trends in PSA screening from 2001 – 2018. North American Association of Central Cancer Registries was used to determine age-adjusted incidence of localized and metastatic PC at the time of diagnosis from 1999 – 2017. Results: The age-adjusted PCSM rate in the U.S. decreased linearly at a rate of (-)0.28 per 100,000/year from 1999 – 2012 and subsequently stalled at a rate of no change from 2014 – 2019 (p < 0.001). This effect was particularly striking for men aged 60 – 69, men > 80 years, and Black men. Men aged 60 – 64 had a decreasing rate of (-)0.009 per 100,000/year prior to 2013, followed by a rise of (+)0.001 per 100,000/year (p < 0.001). Among Black men, PCSM rate was decreasing linearly at (-)0.700/100,000/year from 1999-2012 and flattened at a rate of (-)0.091/100,000/year from 2014-2019 (p < 0.001). These changes were seen across races, urbanization and census regions (p < 0.001) and were accompanied by decreases in PSA screening (p = 0.02) together with increases in diagnosis of metastatic disease. These trends were inconsistent with mortality trends observed across all malignancies. Conclusions: Using comprehensive data on PCSM through 2019, this study illustrates decreasing PCSM over time which flattened or increased following the 2012 change in USPSTF guideline, along with a decrease in PSA screening. The change in PCSM was seen in all ages, races, ethnicities, urbanization and census regions, but particularly in men from 60 – 69 and > 80 years old, and Black men. These changes were accompanied by increased diagnosis of metastatic PC and are discordant from trends across other malignancies. These findings suggest that the change in PSA screening guideline may have contributed to the stagnancy of PCSM rates in recent years. The updated 2018 USPSTF guideline supporting shared-decision making may reverse these trends over time.\n\nMatitu, Bayani, Rosalinda Santiago, and Michael Pasco. \"Athletes After Retirement: How are they Doing?\" Bedan Research Journal 4, no. 1 (April 30, 2019): 136–63. http://dx.doi.org/10.58870/berj.v4i1.7.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nperformance of current athletes by building confidence and contributing to favorable conditions of retired athletes. This study investigated the influences of the years of retirement and physical self-inventory on human sufferings experienced by the retired athletes. Based on the literature review, there were limited empirical studies on the conditions of former athletes after years of retirement, their glory, physical inventory, and sufferings, and the relationships among these characteristics. Using mixed research methods, this research studied the conditions of retired athletes in Metro Manila. The study confirmed that physical self-inventory influenced post-retirement human suffering. Post-retirement athletic identity, financial status and decisions to voluntary retire were observed to be the most prevalent experiences related to human suffering. However, retired athletes enjoy experiences with their educational status, other career benefits, health condition, control of lives, management of changes, and the warm support of their families and colleagues.

This theory is formulated in a way that allows a description of the transition from the initial equilibrium state to the final metastable state without considering any kinetic processes. The RFOT and its applications for real molecular systems (multicomponent liquids with various intermolecular potentials, gel systems, etc.) are widely represented in English-language sources. However, these studies are practically not described in any Russian sources. This paper presents an overview of the studies carried out in this field. REFERENCES 1. Sanditov D. S., Ojovan M. I.

Current factor replacement therapies have limitations, including treatment burden, kinetics (peaks/troughs), morbidity and mortality from breakthrough bleeds, including chronic joint disease, inhibitor development, as well as risk of thrombotic events and coagulation test interference with novel non-factor therapies. Cell therapies with genetically modified human cells expressing hFVIII have been tested as a new potential therapeutic approach. To avoid host cytotoxic immune response, allogeneic cells either need to be physically shielded and/or the host immunosuppressed. Various biomaterials, which can provide a physical barrier from the host immune cells, activate a foreign body response, resulting in pericapsular fibrotic overgrowth (PFO) that significantly limits efficacy and durability of these cell-based therapies. Sigilon utilized a library of proprietary small molecules that avoid PFO when conjugated to alginate biomaterials (Bochenek Nat Biomed Eng 2018) to create a modular, cell-based platform with potential for utilization across a range of chronic diseases, including rare blood disorders. The platform consists of genetically modified allogeneic human cells engineered to produce the therapeutic protein of interest, encapsulated in a two-compartment sphere which supports the function of cells (inner compartment) and shields the cells from the host's immune system and PFO (outer layer) (Barney ASGCT 2020). SIG-001 is a buffered suspension of 1.5 mm alginate spheres encapsulating hFVIII-expressing human cells. SIG-001 can produce functionally active hFVIII in a dose-dependent manner, correct the bleeding phenotype in HA mice, and produce sustained long-lasting hFVIII levels in NSG mice sacrificed at 6 months (Carmona ASH 2019). In preparation for entry into the clinic, SIG-001 was evaluated in mice and non-human primates (NHP). The studies showed no concerning signals in the safety/toxicology profile of SIG-001 (Carmona ISTH 2020). The first-in-human phase 1/2 trial in HA (SIG-001-121, EudraCT 2019-004210-33) will assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of SIG-001. This multi-center, open-label study with sequential, dose escalating cohorts, will enroll up to 18 participants (pts), including up to 3 initial pts per cohort and 3 additional pts if cohort expansion is warranted at any dose. A sentinel pt in each cohort will receive a single administration of SIG-001 and be evaluated for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment of subsequent pts. The next dose level will be initiated following safety review of all pts from the previous dose level(s). The study will include adult males (≥18), with severe or moderately-severe HA (≤2% FVIII activity) who have had ≥150 exposure days to FVIII product(s). The key exclusion criteria include pts with current or past history of FVIII inhibitors. SIG-001 will be administered into the peritoneal cavity using a short laparoscopic procedure, and pts will be followed for 5 years after SIG-001 administration. Primary endpoint of the study is safety, including clinically significant changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and treatment emergent adverse events compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints include FVIII one-stage and chromogenic activity levels, FVIII inhibitor titers, annualized bleeding rate, and annualized FVIII concentrate use. Exploratory endpoints include QoL metrics, and joint health and physical activity assessments. Results will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. The study will be conducted at sites located in the UK, US and Germany. In conclusion, Sigilon has developed an innovative, modular, scalable, cell-based platform of candidate products for the treatment of chronic diseases, including rare bleeding disorders. The platform was designed to overcome the significant challenges of allogeneic cell therapy, namely immune rejection and PFO. SIG-001 produces hFVIII with in vitro and in vivo functionality. SIG-001-121, first-in-human clinical trial of SIG-001 in HA, is targeted to open in 2020.

On the other hand, such chronic diseases of the centralized economy as lack of incentive, material shortage and poor workmanship cause specific problems for ship construction. Being technically and financially unable to rapidly improve the overall technology level and performance of the entire industry, the Soviets concentrate their efforts on certain important areas and have achieved significant results, especially in welding and cutting titanium and aluminum alloys, modular production methods, standardization, etc. All productivity improvement efforts are supported by an army of highly educated engineers and scientists at shipyards, in multiple scientific, research and design institutions. Discussion Edwin J. Petersen, Todd Pacific Shipyards Three years ago I addressed the Ship Production Symposium as chairman of the Ship Production Committee and outlined some major factors which had contributed to the U.S. shipbuilding industry's remarkable achievements in building and maintaining the world's largest naval and merchant fleets during the five-year period starting just before World War II. The factors were as follows:There was a national commitment to get the job done. The shipbuilding industry was recognized as a needed national resource. There was a dependable workload. Standardization was extensively and effectively utilized. Shipbuilding work was effectively organized. Although these lessons appear to have been lost by our Government since World War II, the paper indicates that the Soviet Union has picked up these principles and has applied them very well to its current shipbuilding program. The paper also gives testimony to the observation that the Soviet Government recognizes the strategic and economic importance of a strong merchant fleet as well as a powerful naval fleet. In reviewing the paper, I found great similarity between the Soviet shipbuilding productivity improvement efforts and our own efforts or goals under the National Shipbuilding Research Program in the following areas:welding technology, flexible automation (robotics), application of group technology, standardization, facilities development, and education and training. In some areas, the Soviet Union appears to be well ahead of the United States in improving the shipbuilding process. Most noteworthy among these is the stable long-and medium-range planning that is possible by virtue of the use and adherence to the \"Table of Vessel Classes.\" It will be obvious to most who hear and read these comments what a vast and significant improvement in shipbuilding costs and schedules could be achieved with a relatively dependable 15year master ship procurement plan for the U.S. naval and merchant fleets. Another area where the Soviet Union appears to lead the United States is in the integration of ship component suppliers into the shipbuilding process. This has been recognized as a vital step by the National Shipbuilding Research Program, but so far we have not made significant progress. A necessary prerequisite for this \"supplier integration\" is extensive standardization of ship components, yet another area in which the Soviets have achieved significantly greater progress than we have. Additional areas of Soviet advantage are the presence of a multilevel research and development infrastructure well supported by highly educated scientists, engineering and technical personnel; and better integration of formally educated engineering and technical personnel into the ship production process. In his conclusion, the author lists a number of problems facing the Soviet economy that adversely affect shipbuilding productivity. Perhaps behind this listing we can delve out some potential U.S. shipbuilding advantages. First, production systems in U.S. shipyards (with the possible exception of naval shipyards) are probably more flexible and adjustable to meet new circumstances as a consequence of not being constrained by a burdensome centralized bureaucracy, as is the case with Soviet shipyards. Next, such initiatives as the Ship Production Committee's \"Human Resources Innovation\" projects stand a better chance of achieving product-oriented \"production team\" relationship among labor, management, and technical personnel than the more rigid Soviet system, especially in view of the ability of U.S. shipyard management to offer meaningful financial incentives without the kind of bureaucratic constraints imposed in the Soviet system. Finally, the current U.S. Navy/shipbuilding industry cooperative effort to develop a common engineering database should lead to a highly integrated and disciplined ship design, construction, operation, and maintenance system for naval ships (and subsequently for commercial ships) that will ultimately restore the U.S. shipbuilding process to a leadership position in the world marketplace (additional references [16] and [17]).On that tentatively positive note, it seems fitting to close this discussion with a question: Is the author aware of any similar Soviet effort to develop an integrated computer-aided design, production and logistics support system? The author is to be congratulated on an excellent, comprehensive insight into the Soviet shipbuilding process and productivity improvement efforts that should give us all adequate cause not to be complacent in our own efforts. Peter M. Palermo, Naval Sea Systems Command The author presents an interesting paper that unfortunately leaves this reader with a number of unanswered questions. The paper is a paradox. It depicts a system consisting of a highly educated work force, advanced fabrication processes including the use of standardized hull modules, sophisticated materials and welding processes, and yet in the author's words they suffer from \"low productivity, poor product quality, . . . and the rigid production systems which resists the introduction of new ideas.\" Is it possible that incentive, motivation, and morale play an equally significant role in achieving quality and producibility advances? Can the author discuss underlying reasons for quality problems in particular—or can we assume that the learning curves of Figs. 5 and Fig. 6 are representative of quality improvement curves? It has been my general impression that quality will improve with application of high-tech fabrication procedures, enclosed fabrication ways, availability of highly educated welding engineers on the building ways, and that productivity would improve with the implementation of modular or zone outfitting techniques coupled with the quality improvements. Can the author give his impressions of the impact of these innovations in the U.S. shipbuilding industry vis-a-vis the Soviet industry? Many of the welding processes cited in the paper are also familiar to the free world, with certain notable exceptions concerning application in Navy shipbuilding. For example, (1) electroslag welding is generally confined to single-pass welding of heavy plates; application to thinner plates—l1/4 in. and less when certified—would permit its use in more applications than heretofore. (2) Electron beam welding is generally restricted to high-technology machinery parts; vacuum chamber size restricts its use for larger components (thus it must be assumed that the Soviets have solved the vacuum chamber problem or have much larger chambers). (3) Likewise, laser welding has had limited use in U.S. shipbuilding. An interesting theme that runs throughout the paper, but is not explicitly addressed, is the quality of Soviet ship fitting. The use of high-tech welding processes and the mention of \"remote controlled tooling for welding and X-ray testing the butt, and for following painting\" imply significant ship fitting capabilities for fitting and positioning. This is particularly true if modules are built in one facility, outfitted and assembled elsewhere depending on the type of ship required. Any comments concerning Soviet ship fitting capabilities would be appreciated. The discussion on modular construction seems to indicate that the Soviets have a \"standard hull module\" that is used for different types of vessels, and if the use of these hull modules permit increasing hull length without changes to the fore and aft ends, it can be assumed that they are based on a standard structural design. That being the case, the midship structure will be overdesigned for many applications and optimally designed for very few. Recognizing that the initial additional cost for such a piece of hull structure is relatively minimal, it cannot be forgotten that the lifecycle costs for transporting unnecessary hull weight around can have significant fuel cost impacts. If I perceived the modular construction approach correctly, then I am truly intrigued concerning the methods for handling the distributive systems. In particular, during conversion when the ship is lengthened, how are the electrical, fluid, communications, and other distributive systems broken down, reassembled and tested? \"Quick connect couplings\" for these type systems at the module breaks is one particular area where economies can be achieved when zone construction methods become the order of the day in U.S. Navy ships. The author's comments in this regard would be most welcome. The design process as presented is somewhat different than U.S. Navy practice. In U.S. practice, Preliminary and Contract design are developed by the Navy. Detail design, the development of the working drawings, is conducted by the lead shipbuilder. While the detail design drawings can be used by follow shipbuilders, flexibility is permitted to facilitate unique shipbuilding or outfitting procedures. Even the contract drawings supplied by the Navy can be modified— upon Navy approval—to permit application of unique shipbuilder capabilities. The large number of college-trained personnel entering the Soviet shipbuilding and allied fields annually is mind-boggling. According to the author's estimation, a minimum of about 6500 college graduates—5000 of which have M.S. degrees—enter these fields each year. It would be most interesting to see a breakdown of these figures—in particular, how many naval architects and welding engineers are included in these figures? These are disciplines with relatively few personnel entering the Navy design and shipbuilding field today. For example, in 1985 in all U.S. colleges and universities, there were only 928 graduates (B.S., M.S. and Ph.D.) in marine, naval architecture and ocean engineering and only 1872 graduates in materials and metallurgy. The number of these graduates that entered the U.S. shipbuilding field is unknown. Again, the author is to be congratulated for providing a very thought-provoking paper. Frank J. Long, Win/Win Strategies This paper serves not only as a chronicle of some of the productivity improvement efforts in Soviet shipbuilding but also as an important reminder of the fruits of those efforts. While most Americans have an appreciation of the strengths of the Russian Navy, this paper serves to bring into clearer focus the Russians' entire maritime might in its naval, commercial, and fishing fleets. Indeed, no other nation on earth has a greater maritime capability. It is generally acknowledged that the Soviet Navy is the largest in the world. When considering the fact that the commercial and fishing fleets are, in many military respects, arms of the naval fleet, we can more fully appreciate how awesome Soviet maritime power truly is. The expansion of its maritime capabilities is simply another but highly significant aspect of Soviet worldwide ambitions. The development and updating of \"Setka Typov Su dov\" (Table of Vessel Classes), which the author describes is a classic example of the Soviet planning process. As the author states, \"A mighty fishing and commercial fleet was built in accordance with a 'Setka' which was originally developed in the 1960's. And an even more impressive example is the rapid expansion of the Soviet Navy.\" In my opinion it is not mere coincidence that the Russians embarked on this course in the 1960's. That was the beginning of the coldest of cold war periods—Francis Gary Power's U-2 plane was downed by the Russians on May 1, 1960; the mid-May 1960 Four Power Geneva Summit was a bust; the Berlin Wall was erected in 1961 and, in 1962, we had the Cuban Missile Crisis. The United States maritime embargo capability in that crisis undoubtedly influenced the Soviet's planning process. It is a natural and normal function of a state-controlled economy with its state-controlled industries to act to bring about the controlled productivity improvement developments in exactly the key areas discussed in the author's paper. As the author states, \"All innovations at Soviet shipyards have originated at two main sources:domestic development andadaptation of new ideas introduced by leading foreign yards, or most likely a combination of both. Soviet shipbuilders are very fast learners; moreover, their own experience is quite substantial.\" The Ship Production Committee of SNAME has organized its panels to conduct research in many of these same areas for productivity improvement purposes. For example, addressing the areas of technology and equipment are Panels SP-1 and 3, Shipbuilding Facilities and Environmental Effects, and Panel SP-7, Shipbuilding Welding. Shipbuilding methods are the province of SP-2; outfitting and production aids and engineering and scientific support are the province of SP-4, Design Production Integration. As I read through the descriptions of the processes that led to the productivity improvements, I was hoping to learn more about the organizational structure of Soviet shipyards, the managerial hierarchy and how work is organized by function or by craft in the shipyard. (I would assume that for all intents and purposes, all Russian yards are organized in the same way.) American shipyard management is wedded to the notion that American shipbuilding suffers immeasurably from a productivity standpoint because of limitations on management's ability to assign workers across craft lines. It is unlikely that this limitation exists in Soviet shipyards. If it does not, how is the unfettered right of assignment optimized? What are the tangible, measurable results? I believe it would have been helpful, also, for the author to have dedicated some of the paper to one of the most important factors in improvement in the labor-intensive shipbuilding industry—the shipyard worker. There are several references to worker problems—absenteeism, labor shortage, poor workmanship, and labor discipline. The reader is left with the impression that the Russians believe that either those are unsolvable problems or have a priority ranking significantly inferior to the organizational, technical, and design efforts discussed. As a case in point, the author devotes a complete section to engineering education and professional training but makes no mention of education or training programs for blue-collar workers. It would seem that a paper on productivity improvement efforts in Soviet shipbuilding would address this most important element. My guess is that the Russians have considerable such efforts underway and it would be beneficial for us to learn of them.\n\nAtait, Mariam, and Usman Shoukat Qureshi. \"Efficacy of different primers on growth and yield of tulip (Tulipa gesneriana L.).\" World Journal of Biology and Biotechnology 5, no. 2 (August 15, 2020): 31. http://dx.doi.org/10.33865/wjb.005.02.0306.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nTulip (Tulipa gesneriana L.) is an important and highly valuable flower of the cut flower industry. The most critical step in its cultivation is to break dormancy in order to initiate the growth, especially in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. Therefore, the current research was conducted to break bulb dormancy and foster the growth of tulip in Potohar region with the help of different primers. The objective of this study was the selection of best primer at appropriate concentration level to enhance growth, yield and vase life of the flower. Tulip bulbs were treated with different primers: T0 (distilled water), T1 (chitosan @ 5 g/L), T2 (gibberellic acid @ 0.15 g/L), T3 (humic acid 160 g/L), T4 (imidacloprid 19 g/L) and T5 (salicylic acid 0.1 g/L) for 24 hours, respectively. The experiment was laid out using Complete Randomized Design (CRD) with three replications. Statistical results revealed that characteristics including early germination, plant height, number of leaves, stalk length, fresh and dry weight of flower, weight of bulbs, diameter of bulbs and number of daughter bulbs were significantly increased in T2. Whereas, leaf area, diameter of stem and flower was maximum in T0. Plants under T3 showed an increase in chlorophyll content of leaves. While floral characteristics like early formation and opening of flower bud, more number of flowers and vase life were improved in T1. Thus, statistical results showed that priming can effectively help to improve morpho-physiological attributes of tulip.Key wordTulip, primers, dormancy, chitosan, gibberellic acid, humic acid, imidacloprid, salicylic acid.INTRODUCTIONTulip (Tulips gesneriana L.) is the most popular and lucrative spring blooming bulbous plant of Liliacae family. It is famous for its distinctive flower shape; size and vibrant color range that make it stand out aesthetically among other ornamental flowers. There are about 150 to 160 species of tulip that can be grown in gardens. In addition to this, they are also used as cut flowers. In cut flower industry, it is ranked as 3rd most desirable flower after rose and chrysanthemum (Singh, 2006; Ahmad et al., 2014). This flower holds a significant importance on societal events like Valentine’s Day, Easter, New Year and Mother’s Day. Along with ornamental uses, its bulb can be used for cooking purposes in place of onions and petals can be used to treat rough skin. As a result of its immense beauty and multiple uses, it is day by day becoming more eminent and favorite among people globally (Buschman, 2004; Jhon and Neelofar, 2006). The demand for cut flowers in Pakistan is also gaining popularity. In Pakistan,"
