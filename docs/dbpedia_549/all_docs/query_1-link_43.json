Furthermore, ER can be used to shorten the reproductive cycle and for the propagation of rare plants. Additionally, it has been repeatedly used to study the stages of embryonic development, especially in embryo-lethal mutants. The most widely used ER procedure is the culture of immature embryos taken and placed directly on culture media. In certain cases, the in vitro culture of ovule, ovaries or placentas enables the successful development of young embryos from the zygote stage to maturity.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nIn Angiosperm, the seed is produced by double fertilization. The male gametophyte sperm cell fuses a central diploid cell derived from the union of the two female polar nuclei, creating a triploid endosperm. Simultaneously, the second male sperm cell fuses with the egg cell to produce the diploid zygote. The resulting embryo (2n) and endosperm (3n) continue to develop within the seed coat derived from the maternal tissues of the egg [1]. In most dicot plants after fertilization, the nucleus of the zygote moves to the apical pole, and the zygote divides asymmetrically to produce a small apical cell that will generate the entire embryo apart from the suspensor and root cap, which are derived from the larger basal cell. The cell division generates a mature embryo organized with an apical–basal polarity and radial concentric tissue layers perpendicular to the axis of symmetry. The apical end is formed by the primary shoot apical meristem (SAM), flanked by one or two cotyledons, while the primary root apical meristem (RAM) is located at the basal end [2]. From the early stages of pattern formation and morphogenesis, the stem cell pools, which are essential for virtually unlimited post-embryonic growth, are placed in the RAM and SAM [3]. Conversely, storage reserves accumulate during the next stage of maturation to prepare the embryo for developmental arrest [4]. In most dicot plants, the endosperm is temporary and, therefore, consumed by the embryo during seed maturation, leaving only a peripheral aleurone-like cell layer next to the seed coat, surrounding the mature embryo [5]. Monocotyledonous zygotes, such as maize, rice, and wheat, also exhibit polarity with the nucleus located at the apical pole. The first transverse division of the zygote produces a two-cell embryo, where the basal cell transforms into a large vesicular cell, while the continuous division of the apical cell gives rise to the quadrant, octant, and dermatogenous stages (proembryos stages) [6]. During the later transitional embryonic stage, which in maize occurs about 7–8 days after pollination (DAP), the adaxial–abaxial axis of the embryo becomes evident. The coleoptile primordium starts protruding from the adaxial region, while the scutellar region develops from the abaxial side. The coleoptile protects the development of the SAM, while the scutellum is analogous to the cotyledon in dicot species. The SAM develops on the adaxial side and produces several embryonic leaves during seed development, while the differentiation of the RAM defines the basal pole of the embryo. In rice, the embryo reaches its mature shape when organ differentiation is complete at 7–8 DAP, although morphogenesis continues as the embryo enlarges. The SAM and RAM are enclosed by the protective coleoptile and coleorhiza, respectively. In grasses, the early vegetative stages of embryonic seedlings are incorporated into the embryo before entering dormancy [7].\n\nMany physical, chemical, and genetic factors influence the development of the zygotic embryo [8]. Disruptions in these factors can result in abnormalities and, in the worst-case scenario, embryo abortion [9,10].\n\nEmbryo rescue (ER) is a set of techniques commonly used to rescue immature/mature-lethal embryos, and hybrid embryos generated from interspecific and intergeneric crosses unable to survive in vivo or during traditional plant breeding practices [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19]. The procedure involves excising immature or lethal embryos and culturing them in vitro on a specific nutrient culture medium. The developmental differences between dicots and monocots need to be considered when attempting to recover immature embryos. Nutritional species-specific requirements and the assessment of parameters about growth conditions deserve particular attention to distinguish what happens in the normal embryonic development of dicot and monocot embryos.\n\nDuring the domestication of plants, many genes controlling resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses were lost. The initial goals of the domestication process were the modification of important traits, such as plant architecture, seed dormancy, fruit and seed size, absence of antinutrients, thorns and waxes, compactness of the ears, absence of seed dispersal, and synchronous fruit ripening. This has led to the phenomenon known as domestication syndrome, where plant survival becomes entirely dependent on human care [20]. Unfortunately, the stress-resistant characteristics of wild ancestor species were often overlooked. However, wild ancestors of crops and/or related wild species constitute a large reservoir of genes that can be introduced into cultivated crops through interspecific and intergeneric hybridization [21]. The rediscovery of Mendelian laws laid the foundation for genetic improvement based on the inheritance of characteristics. However, crossing often requires overcoming physiological and genetic barriers, such as fertilization incompatibility, embryo abortion, and seed dormancy. ER and direct in vitro pollination, such as pollinating stigmas or pistils and opened ovaries or ovules, have proven advantageous in overcoming embryo abortion and pre-zygotic incompatibility barriers, respectively [22]. In vitro pollination techniques have yielded the best results in species with large ovaries containing numerous ovules, including families such as Brassicaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Papaveraceae, Primulaceae, and Solanaceae [23,24]. ER has been instrumental in recovering haploid, dihaploid, doubled haploid (DH), polyploid embryos, addition lines, and substitution lines resulting from interspecific or intergeneric crosses. ER techniques have been also used to shorten the reproductive cycle, propagate rare plants, study the physiology of seed germination, understand embryo nutrition, and study embryo morphogenesis from the zygote to cotyledon stage [12,17,19,25,26,27,28,29,30,31] (Figure 1).\n\nThis review provides up-to-date information on ER techniques, their impact, and applications in the genetic improvement in major and minor crops.\n\n2. The Origins of Embryo Rescue: A Brief Historical Overview\n\nCharles Bonnet (1720–1793) documented ER for the first time in the 18th century. He achieved remarkable success by excising mature embryos of Phaseolus vulgaris and Fagopyrum and transplanting them into the soil where they could grow [14]. Later, many scientists started assessing the process with various nutrient media. From 1890 to 1904, ER was evaluated with nutrient media containing salt and sugars along with tissue culture techniques. In 1904, E. Hanning successfully introduced mature embryos into the in vitro tissue culture of some Brassicaceae species (i.e., Raphanus sativus, R. landra, R. caudatus, and Cochlearia danica), obtaining seedlings on a saline medium supplemented with sugar. However, he found the problem that in vitro embryo culture originated small and faint seedlings compared to those raised in vivo [32,33]. From these experiments, Hanning focused on the necessity of a high osmotic concentration in the culture medium since the embryos were unable to grow in media lacking sucrose as a carbon source, and the essentiality of an adequate source of nitrogen to allow seedling development from embryos [12,32].\n\nThe culture method was used by Brown [34] to assess the efficacy of various organic nitrogenous compounds in promoting the growth of isolated barley (Hordeum vulgare) embryos nourished in a mineral saline medium supplemented with sucrose. These experiments demonstrated that amino acids, such as aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and asparagine, served as superior nitrogen sources, leading to increased dry weight and nitrogen content of cultured embryos. Other studies have shown the favorable action of reserve tissues, such as endosperm and cotyledons, in embryo development, although their indispensability was not specifically established [35]. Nevertheless, the reduced growth of Phaseolus lanatus embryos deprived of cotyledons and cultured in distilled water solidified with agar was significantly improved by adding glucose or an extract containing reducing sugar from cotyledons of germinated seeds [36]. Andronescu [37] observed the stunted growth of maize (Zea mays) seedlings from embryos lacking scutellum, demonstrating the importance of this organ in the absorption of essential nutrients for the development of monocot embryos.\n\nIn 1924, Kurt Dieterich was a precursor in testing the possibility of embryo culture both in mature and immature explants [38]. His experiments involved culturing embryos from species of various families, including Solanaceae, Linaceae, Brassicaceae, Polygonaceae, Asteraceae, Cucurbitaceae, and Poaceae, revealing differences in nutrient requirements, such as carbon and nitrogen sources, between immature and mature embryos.\n\nIn vivo, embryos derived from interspecific or intergeneric crosses are often underdeveloped and lethal. Frequently, crosses between plants with incompatible genomes lead to early embryo abortion. Often, ER allows the growth of these embryos with reduced viability until development into mature plants. The first application of the in vitro culture of zygotic immature embryos from interspecific cross dates to 1925, when Friedrich Laibach used this technique to prevent embryonic abortion in Lilium perenne × L. austriacum cross [39]. Laibach’s experiments were fundamental because they gave the initial impetus to the use of interspecific and intergeneric hybridization in genetic improvement, even between species in which the nature of incompatibility did not allow the enormous genetic variability present in wild species to be exploited.\n\n3. The Embryo Rescue Techniques\n\n3.1. Pre-Zygotic Barriers in Hybridization and Techniques to Overcome Them\n\nIntraspecific, interspecific, and intergeneric hybridizations are important reproductive mechanisms that have contributed to plant speciation and plant breeding [21]. These crosses allow the introgression of advantageous genes from wild species to improve cultivated crops. However, pre- and post-mating reproductive barriers often hinder the application of hybridization techniques in genetic improvement, especially when phylogenetically distant species are involved [40]. Post-mating reproductive barriers can be pre-zygotic and post-zygotic because incompatibility reactions occur before (pre-zygotic) and after (post-zygotic) fertilization, respectively. Notably, the positive fate may depend on the crossing direction for each hybridization.\n\nIn the pre-zygotic type, the incompatibility reaction often results in the failure of pollen germination, pollen tube growth, or pollen tube penetration into the ovule, which may occur at various levels in different tissues, such as the stigma, style, or ovary [40,41,42].\n\nTo overcome pre-zygotic barriers, cut-style or graft-on-style techniques, application of pollen mixture from several species, placenta pollination, and in vitro ovule pollination have been used [43,44,45]. The techniques to be applied depend on the type of genetic barrier (i.e., incompatibility) that prevents fertilization.\n\nTo conduct in vitro fertilization, bringing fully functioning male and female gametophytes into contact and establishing optimal culture conditions to ensure successful gamete fusion is crucial. In pollination methods in vitro, the reproductive organs (stigma and anthers) are isolated, followed by controlled fusion of the male and female gametes. In addition, it is necessary to set up a culture medium that allows the zygote to develop to full maturity, followed by seed germination.\n\nThe graft-on-style method is useful when pollen germinates on the stigma but an incompatibility reaction occurs between pollen and style. This type of incompatibility, known as gametophytic incompatibility, causes the pollen tubes to stop and burst after traveling approximately one-third of the length of the style. In this case, the pollination of the entire gynoecium in vitro would not yield fruitful results, as all pollen tubes would be halted at the early part of the style, even under in vitro conditions. To overcome this challenge, the grafting technique is employed, wherein an incompatible style is replaced with a compatible one. This allows the pollen tube to follow its normal growth with the compatible style grafted into the ovary. Alternatively, in species with this type of genetic incompatibility, one proceeds by either shortening the style and micrografting the stigma at the base of the style or by directly depositing pollen on the ovule.\n\nIf incompatibility is sporophytic, the recognition substances are deposited in the exine of the pollen during gametogenesis, and the incompatibility reaction occurs at the level of the stigma. Therefore, for the purpose of promoting in vitro fertilization, delivery of pollen on the ovary or ovules may be preferable. Moreover, even placement of germinated pollen grains directly on the decapitated style of the stigma may be equally interesting [27,46].\n\n3.2. Post-Zygotic Barriers in Hybridization and Techniques to Overcome Them\n\nWhen the incompatibility is post-zygotic, the culture of immature embryos may be required. Interspecific and intergeneric hybridizations hinder many post-zygotic barriers [47,48,49], the mechanisms of which are not fully understood yet, and these aspects further complicate the adoption of the best ER techniques. Nevertheless, in vitro culture of immature embryos has emerged as the most widely employed technique, demonstrating remarkable practical success in interspecific and intergeneric hybrids production. These techniques have enabled the transfer of beneficial genes from wild to cultivated species. In higher plants, embryo development is closely linked to the presence of a well-formed endosperm. While the endosperm can develop without the embryo, the absence of endosperm results in early embryo abortion [40,42,50]. Failure to form endosperm commonly accompanies interspecific and intergeneric crosses, and this phenomenon is often present in embryo-lethal mutants. In flowering plants, the endosperm plays a crucial role in coordinating nutrient and hormone supply from maternal tissues to the embryo [51]. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain hybridization barriers associated with abnormal endosperm differentiation. These include the endosperm equilibrium number (maternal: paternal ratio of 2:1) [52], the difference between the activation and response values expressed by the polar nuclei activation index [53], and genomic imprinting, with the emerging view that it largely influences parental genome dosage [45,54]. Under these circumstances, embryos frequently abort during their development, and ER procedures have proven useful for overcoming these barriers across a wide range of plant species.\n\nSuccessful results in immature embryo survival depend on the technique adopted (e.g., culture in the ovary, ovule, or embryo). Equally important are the following aspects: the excision procedure, the preservation of embryo integrity, the protocol of sterilization methods, the culture medium composition, and the environmental conditions encompassing light intensity, quality, and temperature. Intrinsic factors, such as embryo size and developmental stage, also play an important role [12,19,25,28,29,55].\n\nIn embryo culture, the rescue of a very young embryo is more challenging than an already differentiated one. Ideally, it is more advantageous to recover the immature embryo at a later stage, often referred to as the “autotrophic phase” by some authors [56]. Hence, the embryo is excised from the plant when it reaches the maximum possible development within the constraints imposed by the absence of the endosperm. Typically, excision occurs within the first two weeks after pollination.\n\nEmbryo recovery at an early stage of their development, such as the globular or heart stage, may be preferable in certain interspecific combinations. This is because reaching a more advanced stage of development, such as torpedo or cotyledon, often leads to an abortion of the embryo in vivo that is no longer recoverable. However, working with these early embryos presents greater challenges because great is the risk of damaging them during excision, and complex are their nutritional requirements, particularly for proembryos [11].\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, the technique of ovule culture allows for the collection of immature embryos within their ovules. This involves in vitro culture of the fertilized egg cell for several days (e.g., one week) followed by the excision of the immature embryo from the cultured ovule. The excised embryo is then transferred to a substrate where it can complete its development [57,58,59]. This method produced new genomic combinations in species, genera, and families of dicot and monocot, for instance, Nicotiana [60], Gossypium [61], Brassica [62,63], Helianthus [58], Tulipa [64], Lilium [65], Vanilla [66], Rhododendron subgenera or sections [67], and Vaccinium [68,69,70], among others.\n\nGeneralizing the methods and media used in various in vitro culture techniques is inherently challenging. Each class (dicots or monocots), family, species, and genotype, as well as embryo derived from different hybridizations, requires the setup of specific methodologies to create the most suitable culture medium. This involves several aspects, such as salt concentrations, carbohydrates, vitamins, plant growth regulators (PGRs), and pH, as well as the exploration of proper environmental culture conditions, including temperature, light, and photoperiod. It is most likely that the optimized conditions are species-specific and, therefore, unsuitable for immature embryos of other species or those derived from different crosses. Moreover, dicot species frequently require a multi-step approach, starting from ovule culture to ER, unlike monocot species. This relates to the different types of development that characterize the embryos of dicots compared to monocots. Below, two examples of culturing ovules from phylogenetically distant dicot species are reported.\n\nThe in vitro ER technique was employed to obtain embryos from interspecific hybridizations between sunflower and other Helianthus species. The embryos were cultured for 7 days in ovules on artificial agarized media [58]. During this culture period, 51 to 84% of embryos of five sunflower genotypes developed to the vascular stage, comparable to greenhouse-grown plants. The survival and development of ovule-grown sunflower embryos were not affected by the salt composition of the four culture media tested: B5 and B5S [71], MS [72], and NN [73], nor did they show any benefit from high sucrose levels (90 or 120 g L−1) [58].\n\nThe ovule culture technique was utilized to enhance the survival of hybrid embryos between H. annuus × H. maximiliani Schrad. Approximately, 52% of the hybrid embryos exhibited viability when sunflower ovules were grown on standard media, indicating that the ovules provided the necessary requirements for the early stages of hybrid embryo development. Ovules were isolated and cultured for 14 days on fresh media with the same composition. About 50% of H. annuus embryos and 25% of H. annuus × H. maximiliani hybrid embryos germinated into seedlings. Six H. annuus × H. maximiliani seedlings were transferred to the greenhouse until flowering. All plants showed intermediate traits inherited from both parents [58].\n\nIn another study, Momotaz et al. [59] conducted intergeneric hybridizations to introduce genetic variability in crucifer crops. Seven species of Brassica (i.e., B. campestris var. trilocularis, B. campestris var. pekinensis, B. nigra, B. oleracea var. capitata, B. oleracea var. alboglabra, B. juncea var. napiformis, and B. carinata) and three species of Sinapis (i.e., S. alba, S. arvensis, and S. turgida) were used; reciprocal crosses were also made. In these hybridizations, ER played an essential role in overcoming post-zygotic barriers. Two methods were employed for hybrid plant development: in vitro ovary–ovule culture and direct ovule culture. However, the ovule culture showed better responses in terms of hybrid plant rescued. In this method, young fruits were harvested 15–20 DAP, and ovules were cultured on solidified B5 medium [71] supplemented with 2.5 mg L−1 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 2.5 mg L−1 N6-Furfuryladenine (kinetin), and 150 mL L−1 coconut milk [74]. Both callus formation and direct germination of embryos were observed from ovules. Calli were transferred to an MS medium [72] supplemented with 0.5 mg L−1 NAA and 2.5 mg L−1 kinetin. Germinated embryos were directly cultured on a hormone-free MS medium. The cultures were maintained at 25 ± 2 °C with a 16 h photoperiod. Seedlings were multiplied in vitro by growing shoots and nodal segments on MS medium, and they were later transplanted in the greenhouse on suitable soil. Specifically, embryos were obtained from the crosses between B. campestris var. trilocularis × S. turgida, B. campestris var. pekinensis × S. arvensis, S. arvensis × B. campestris var. pekinensis, B. oleracea var. alboglabra × S. alba, B. oleracea var. alboglabra × S. turgida, B. carinata × S. alba, B. carinata × S. arvensis, and B. carinata × S. turgida. The highest efficiency was detected in B. carinata × S. arvensis (11.5%) with 29 plants. Reciprocal crosses resulted in no hybrid, except with the combination of S. arvensis × B. campestris var. pekinensis. Morphological characteristics, chromosome number, and isoenzyme analyses confirmed the hybrid nature of the plants. Among the six combinations, four were identified as true hybrids, one as sesquidiploid, and one as a false hybrid [59].\n\nTo overcome the challenges associated with culturing young embryos, an interesting technique provides the relocation of hybrid embryos to a normally developing cellular endosperm dissected from a normal ovule of the parents or a third species, which serves as “nurse tissue”. The embryos and endosperm tissue are then transferred to the surface of the culture medium to activate the in vitro growth of the hybrid embryos [75]. Williams et al. [75] implemented a genetic improvement program involving some types of interspecific crosses, such as Trifolium ambiguum × T. repens, T. ambiguum × T. hybridum, T. repens × T. uniflorum, Ornithopus sativus × O. compressus, O. pinnatus × O. sativus, and Lotus pedunculatus × L. corniculatus. The “nurse tissue” technique was essential for the cross O. pinnatus × O. sativus hybrids to overcome defective endosperm development and for the cross T. ambiguum × T. hybridum, which resulted in completely sterile progeny. An interesting feature of the embryo culture on normal endosperm was the high success rate in the apparently normal and complete development of the hybrid embryos. In fact, although at least 100 putative hybrid proembryos were grown per cross, only a few seedlings were transferred into the soil and reached maturity.\n\nThe globular embryos of Capsella bursa-pastoris, smaller than 50 μm in size, showed higher survival rates when grown in ovules cultured in vitro than when individually inoculated onto the medium [76]. Monnier [77] proposed a solid media culture system for Capsella bursa-pastoris proembryos consisting of two concentric rings. The plate contains a central medium suitable to grow very immature embryos and a different peripheral medium more appropriate for the requirements of embryos at a later stage of development.\n\nElaborate ER methods have also been successfully applied to monocot species. In Zea mays, a double-layered medium for the culture of both zygote and proembryos was exploited [78,79]. Briefly, Matthys-Rochon et al. [79] established media for 6 DAP (pre-transitional) and 7 DAP (transitional) maize embryos. Ovaries, containing endosperm and well-organized embryos, were removed and transferred into drops of liquid MS medium [72] supplemented with 0.35 M sucrose. This first stage was indispensable for cell survival. For 7 DAP proembryos, the basal medium was NBM [80] supplemented with different concentrations of sucrose or maltose (0.18 M and 0.26 M) and solidified with gelrite (0.1%, w/v). The 6 DAP proembryos were first transferred to a bilayer culture system. To support embryo growth, the bottom layer of the N6 basal medium [73,81] was supplemented with 0.09 M sucrose and solidified with 0.8% (w/v) marine Agarose. The upper layer consisted of N6 medium supplemented with 0.35 M sucrose or 0.30 M maltose, with or without cytokinins, and solidified with 0.8% (w/v) SeaPlaque Agarose. The best results for transitional embryos (7 DAP) were obtained on media supplemented with 0.25 M maltose, resulting in 86% of plants from 200 cultured embryos. For these embryos, the embryo orientation on the surface of the culture media was crucial. For pre-transitional embryos (6 DAP), the best results (58% of plants from 52 cultured embryos) were obtained on media supplemented with 0.30 M maltose and 0.03 mM of trans-zeatin riboside (ZR). This protocol allowed the production of fertile plants in approximately two months [79].\n\nEmbryo and ovule cultures have been employed in tulips to overcome crossing barriers in interspecific hybrids, such as Tulipa gesneriana × T. fosteriana, T. gesneriana × T. eichleri, and T. gesneriana × T. greigii [82] (extensively reviewed by Marasek-Ciolakowska et al. [83]). In intraspecific crosses of T. gesneriana × T. gesneriana, Custers et al. [84] investigated the optimal conditions for culturing ovules and collecting embryos from pollinated flowers from a few days to 3 weeks. Half-strength MS medium [72] supplemented with 6% sucrose was the most suitable for obtaining larger bulbils. Culturing the ovules in Petri dishes containing a thin layer (6 mm depth) of MS medium [72] resulted in a higher rate of bulbil differentiation compared to cultures in a thick medium. For bulbil formation, the continuous dark condition was superior to a 16 h photoperiod condition. The optimal growing temperature was 12–15 °C. Based on these results, the following method was established to cultivate tulip ovules. The cultures were grown at 15 °C for 12 to 15 weeks, followed by 12 weeks at 5 °C to induce germination. Subsequently, the cultures were grown to 15 °C for 12 to 18 weeks to allow seedling growth and bulbil development. Furthermore, 6 weeks of culture at 15 °C was needed for maturation. Under improved conditions, up to 90% bulbil formation was obtained. Custers et al. [84] also compared embryo and ovule culture methods and showed that ovule culture could be applicable to save small embryos (0.3–0.7 mm in length), while isolated embryo culture yielded satisfactory results with embryos measuring at least 3 mm.\n\nVarious ER techniques have been employed to cultivate young embryos, including ovary and placenta cultures. These methods have also been combined, such as ovary culture followed by embryo or ovule culture, as well as placenta culture followed by subsequent culture of the ovary, ovule, and embryo (reviewed by Krishna et al. [19]). Overall, these ER methodologies have since been extensively employed to generate many interspecific and intergeneric hybrids [12,28,29,55,85]. Some examples are the applications of ER in crosses within different genera or families, such as in Phaseolus [86], Solanum [87], Cucurbita [88], Brassicaceae family [63], Manihot [89], Trifolium [90,91,92], Vigna [93], Elaeis [94], Paracurcuma and Eucurcuma subgenera [95], Alliums [96], and many other crosses involving phylogenetically distant species (see Section 4). In addition, the enormous potential and diverse applications of ER techniques will be highlighted in next sections, which, with the advent of new biotechnologies (e.g., genome editing), have not been limited to the recovery of lethal embryo hybrids.\n\n3.3. Medium Composition and Environmental Factors Suitable for Embryo Rescue Techniques\n\nIn vitro culture of plant cells, tissues, and organs requires of a plethora of different media, and therefore, it is impossible to establish a universal culture medium and/or standard environmental conditions suitable for the cultivation of all species and, within a single species, of all genotypes. Various aspects, such as genotype/cultivar, PGRs, chemical composition of the culture medium, and physical factors, influence the development of embryos in vitro. ER, as previously reported, can be divided into several techniques. The formulation of culture media profoundly effects the growth and development of immature and mature embryos, and many formulations have been developed for different plant species, although some are commonly used. The Murashige and Skoog (MS) formulation [72] is recognized as the most used base medium. However, there are other effective media frequently employed, including those reported by White [97], “Gamborg’s B-5” by Gamborg et al. [71], Schenk and Hildebrandt (SH) [98], Nitsch and Nitsch (NN, N6) [73], and “Woody Plant Medium” by Lloyd and McCown [99]. Additionally, plant ER media can include various components and additives, which can be placed into eight categories: water, nutrient salts (micro and macronutrients), vitamins, amino acids, carbohydrates, gelling agents, PGRs, and other organic supplements.\n\nThe process of optimizing culture media and environmental conditions is complex and time-consuming, requiring expensive chemicals to set up an efficient and different protocol for each condition.\n\nGiven these challenges, applications of artificial neural networks to in vitro plant culture systems could offer valuable insight into the prospects and potential of network technology [100]. These neural networks could be applied to various aspects of in vitro culture, including the composition of the most suitable medium for each proposed culture situation. However, the use of computer-based tools in this context is still limited, despite preliminary work demonstrating the advantages of employing these tools for analyzing large datasets [101,102]. For example, in a study by Hameg et al. [103], an experiment was optimized using three machine learning algorithms: artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms. The objective was to unravel the essential minerals and predict the optimal combination of salts for successful in vitro micropropagation of hardy kiwi (Actinidia arguta). The authors demonstrated the suitability of computer-based tools for improving plant in vitro micropropagation of A. arguta, predicting a new mineral media formulation that improves growth response and avoids morph-physiological abnormalities. However, this new approach has proven to be valid on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, it should be considered whenever we are faced with different ER situations. In an overall assessment, no chemical/physiological or environmental generalizations can be made about ER, as it remains one of the most complex phases of in vitro culture of immature embryos. Nonetheless, valuable insights can be gained from the excellent reviews [12,19,26,27,28,53] regarding the optimal culture conditions to be used in different species for ER.\n\n4. Embryo Rescue Applications\n\n4.1. Embryo Rescue in Hybrid Plants Obtained to Introduce Resistance Genes to Abiotic and Biotic Stresses and New Agronomic Traits into Crops\n\nIn plant breeding, there is great interest in gene transfer by interspecific or intergeneric hybridization to draw on genetic sources for traits, such as resistance to several stresses, the control of plant architecture, fruit and seed productivity, and the modification of shape and color of flowers, both into dicot and monocot crops. However, crosses within many genera may not occur due to double fertilization failure or early embryo abortion. Hence, hybridization achievement often relies on the support of ER techniques (Figure 1).\n\n4.1.1. Dicot Species\n\nExtensive hybridization programs have been implemented in the genus Helianthus among cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus) and wild species to introgress genes conferring resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses [104,105,106]. Notably, new interspecific hybrids, such as H. annuus × H. hirsutus, and H. annuus × H. scaberimus, have been produced [107]. Remarkably, hybrids have been produced using H. annuus as a female parent, crossing it with H. maximiliani [108], H. nuttalii, H. mollis, and H. strumosus [109]. In all these crosses, ER was indispensable for the survival of the hybrid embryos. For example, Krauter et al. [108] made 33 different hybrid combinations using H. annuus as both female and male parents. Fertilized seeds (5–10 DAP) of the different crosses were collected. After sterilization, immature embryos were isolated. Embryos were cultured on different media according to their stage of development. For small embryos (0.2–1.5 mm), a modified B5 medium [71] supplemented with 90 g L−1 sucrose was used. Embryos over 1.5 mm were grown on a modified MS medium [71,108] supplemented with 10 g L−1 sucrose. Embryos were maintained at 25 °C under continuous light. As soon as the small embryos reached a size of 2–3 mm, they were grown in MS medium. Well-formed shoots were transferred to the greenhouse, where they developed into vigorous plants. In the genus Helianthus, this ER protocol showed good efficiency. In fact, 481 hybrid plants (41%) were recovered from 1178 isolated embryos.\n\nIn Nicotiana, hybrid lethality has been observed in some combinations of interspecific crosses. N. tabacum (2n = 4x = 48, genome SSTT) has an S subgenome derived from N. sylvestris (2n = 2x = 24) and a T subgenome derived from N. tomentosiformis (2n = 2x = 24), the progenitors of tobacco. Hybrid seedlings from the N. stocktonii × N. tabacum cross have been successfully rescued through ovule culture [110], as they did not highlight lethality. The flowers of N. stocktonii, used as the female parent, were emasculated and fertilized with N. tabacum pollen. At 6, 9, and 12 DAP, N. stocktonii fertilized ovules were taken. The ovules were cultured on half-strength MS medium [72] supplemented with 3% sucrose at 28 °C under continuous illumination. Viable hybrid plants were obtained only from 6 DAP ovules (6 viable plants/525 cultured ovules). Conversely, hybrid seedlings from the N. stocktonii × N. sylvestris cross were lethal. Moreover, hybrid seedlings from N. stocktonii × N. tomentosiformis cross also manifested lethality. These results suggested that both S and T genomes harbor factors causing hybrid lethality in N. stocktonii. Muraida and Marubashi [110] proposed that in N. tabacum, the factors responsible for lethality must have been lost due to the reorganization and modification of the genome during and after amphidiploid formation.\n\nIn the genus Nicotiana, ER techniques have also been used to support interspecific hybridization between N. glutinosa (2n = 24) and N. megalosiphon (2n = 40). N. glutinosa was used as the female parent in the cross with N. megalosiphon. Immature ovules at 7 DAP were grown on NN medium [73]. In addition, the MS medium [72] supplemented with 6 mg L−1 NAA and 2 mg L−1 6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP) was used for callus induction. Shoots were regenerated on MS supplemented with 2 mg L−1 indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 2 mg L−1 kinetin. For root induction, MS medium was supplemented with 3–5 mg L−1 IAA and 2 mg L−1 kinetin. About 50 seedlings were obtained and grown to maturity. The hybrids had a wide range of phenotypic variations (e.g., plant height, leaf shape, flower color, and corolla size), probably attributable to the different number of chromosomes detected in the somatic cells of the plants (2n, from 28 to 32) [111].\n\nIn chrysanthemum, ER techniques have been employed to develop interspecific hybrids for aphid resistance [112], heat tolerance [113], drought tolerance [114], cold tolerance [15], salinity tolerance [115], and heterosis [116] (Table 1).\n\nFor instance, Zhu et al. [115], to obtain salinity tolerance, generated an intergeneric hybrid between Chrysanthemum × morifolium (2n = 6x = 54) and Artemisia japonica (2n = 4x = 36). For the ER, ovaries were removed at 12–15 DAP and sterilized. Ovules were excised and transferred to MS medium [72] containing 2 mg L−1 of BA and 0.5 mg L−1 of NAA. Cultures were kept at 25 °C with a 16 h photoperiod. Seedlings were kept on the culture medium until complete rooting. Rooted seedlings were kept in a 16 h photoperiod at 19 ± 1 °C in half-strength MS medium for 1 week. The plants were acclimatized before transfer to soil. The hybrid plants manifested morphological characteristics intermediate to the parents. In particular, the hybrids possessed high chlorophyll and proline contents and lower NA+ ion concentrations, making them more tolerant to salt stress [115].\n\nIn bluebells, new flower shape and cold tolerance have been developed in intraspecific Campanula carpatica and interspecific (C. medium × C. formanekiana) hybrids [117]. However, a frequent problem encountered in these crosses is defective endosperm development, which does not allow the hybrid embryos to complete the maturation in planta. To overcome this problem, ovules from 7 to 30 DAP were isolated and cultured on a modified MS medium [72]. In culturing the ovules, those taken between 14 and 30 DAP provided better embryo germination than ovules taken at 7 DAP. Actually, ovaries were also cultured in vitro in the same experiment. The germination rate of hybrid embryos from ovaries was higher than that of isolated ovules.\n\nInterspecific hybrids between 2 cultivated gentian species (Gentiana scabra and G. triflora) and 11 wild species were obtained to broaden genetic variation in breeding programs (Table 1). Ovule culture in vitro played a crucial role in the proper development of hybrid embryos, and the hybrid nature of the resulting plants was confirmed using morphological traits and molecular markers [118]. Ovules were cultured on solidified half-strength MS medium [72] supplemented with 3% sucrose and 1 mg L−1 Gibberellic acid (GA3) at 20 °C under a 16 h photoperiod. Well-developed seedlings were transferred to the same medium supplemented with 3% sucrose under the same environmental conditions. Rooted plants were grown in pots until flowering. When G. scabra was used as the female parent in crosses, interspecific combinations significantly affected seedling yield, which ranged from 0.3 to 427.7 normal seedlings per flower. In crosses of G. triflora with five wild species, normal seedling yields ranged from 0.4 to 228.3 per flower. In this instance, significant differences between genotypes were found between both interspecific combinations and reciprocal crosses [118].\n\nOvule culture was used for immature embryos obtained from an interspecific cross between Camellia chrysantha and C. japonica, with C. chrysantha as the seed parent, to improve genetic variability [119]. Immature embryos were harvested at 90 to 130 DAP and cultured on a modified MS basal medium [72]. The highest number of differentiated adventitious embryos were obtained when ovules were recovered at 110–120 DAP. Better results were obtained by adding polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to the culture medium and adjusting the pH to 6.5. All plantlets proved to be interspecific hybrids using HPLC analysis of leaf polyphenols and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis [119]. To transfer the yellow corolla color of C. chrysantha to C. japonica, Nishimoto et al. [120] obtained hybrids with a pale-yellow color through the cross C. chrysantha × C. japonica. However, subsequent backcrosses of the hybrid with C. chrysanta resulted in progenies with deep-yellow flowers (Table 1).\n\nInterspecific hybrids between Gypsophila paniculata and G. manginii are incompatible with ordinary cross-breeding methods. Kishi et al. [121] obtained, through ovule–embryo cultures, useful hybrid seedlings that reached maturity. Morphological traits and chromosome counting confirmed the hybrid nature of the plants. These hybrid plants exhibited double flowers with a color of pale purplish pink, a valuable character for the flower market [121].\n\nVery important crops are part of the Brassicaceae family. In the genus Brassica, there are three diploid species: Brassica rapa (2n = 2x = 20, genome AA), Brassica nigra (2n = 2x = 16, genome BB), and Brassica oleracea (2n = 2x = 18, genome CC), and three related allotetraploids: Brassica juncea (2n = 4x = 36, genome AABB), Brassica napus (2n = 4x = 38, genome AACC), and Brassica carinata (2n = 4x = 34, genome BBCC) [122]. Among these species, hybridization can be natural or artificially induced. However, in some hybrid combinations, especially when the parents belong to different genera carrying genes important for genetic improvement, embryos have difficulty developing normally. Therefore, in Brassicaceae, numerous novel F1 hybrids have been produced through the use of various ER techniques: embryo culture [123,124], ovary culture [125,126,127,128], ovule culture [59], and placenta culture [129]. For example, high numbers of F1 hybrid plants have been generated from interspecific and intergeneric hybridizations between Brassica crops and wild relatives in the genera Brassica, Sinapis, Diplotaxis, Moricandia, Eruca, and Orychophragmus using ER techniques to develop improved crop cultivars [63,130]. In particular, synthetic amphidiploid lines, alien gene introgression lines, alloplasmic lines, monosomic alien chromosome addition lines, and monosomic alien chromosome substitution lines have been produced [63]. Attempts were also made to obtain intergeneric hybrids from the crosses of B. campestris, B. nigra, B. oleracea, B. juncea, B. napus, and B. carinata with Enarthrocarpus lyratus. Hybrids using E. lyratus as a female parent were obtained through ovary and/or ovule culture in four combinations: E. lyratus × B. campestris, E. lyratus × B. oleracea, E. lyratus × B. napus, and E. lyratus × B. carinata [131], aiming to introduce genes conferring fungal pathogen resistance from wild relatives to crop species. ER was performed from pollinated ovaries at 4–6 DAP. The ovaries were cultured in MS medium [72] supplemented with 400 mg L−1 casein hydrolysate. Ovule culture was conducted at a more advanced stage from pollination. Ovules were excised from 10–15 DAP pollinated ovaries and grown in the same medium. The seedlings obtained from the ovules were used for plantlet multiplication. Shoot meristems were multiplied on MS medium containing 0.5 mg L−1 BAP. Roots were induced on MS medium supplemented with 0.1 mg L−1 NAA. Seedlings were transferred to soil and grown to maturity. Reciprocal crosses showed strong pre-fertilization barriers and did not produce hybrids except in one combination, B. juncea × E. lyratus [131].\n\nIn Brassica napus, the Polima (pol) CMS (cytoplasmic male sterility) is the most universally valued male sterility form [132]. It is utilized in hybrid rapeseed production along with the fertility restorer gene Rfp [132]. Formanová et al. [133] successfully transferred the pol cytoplasm and Rfp from the amphidiploids B. napus to the diploid species B. rapa. They generated a DH pol cytoplasm in a B. rapa population that segregates for the Rfp gene. This achievement involved interspecific crosses, in vitro rescue of hybrid embryos, backcrosses, and a microspore culture [133]. The use of DHs should help in Rfp gene mapping (see also Section 4.2.1). For ER, siliques were taken after 30 DAP. Embryos manifested extremely stunted development and were removed and cultured on half-strength MS medium [72] with or without 0.2 mg L−1 of IAA. The germinated seedlings were transferred to soil until maturity.\n\nAuxin herbicide resistance from Brassica kaber was transferred to Brassica juncea and Brassica rapa by traditional selection in combination with in vitro ER [134]. Immature siliques were collected from 3 to 5 DAP. After sterilization, the siliques were grown in two different culture media: a medium consisting of MS salts [72] and Gamborg’s vitamins [71] supplemented with 3% sucrose and 500 mg L−1 casein hydrolysate, and a medium consisting of MS salts [72] and Gamborg’s vitamins [71] supplemented with 3% sucrose, 0.5 mg L−1 NAA, and 2.5 mg L−1 kinetin. The siliques were cultured on these media for two weeks. Subsequently, the ovules excised from the siliques were cultured on the same media described above. All cultures were incubated at 24 °C under a 16 h photoperiod. After about one month, the ovules regenerated hybrid seedlings. The seedlings were transferred to a medium containing MS salt [72] and Gamborg vitamins [71] supplemented with 1.5% sucrose for root development. Hybrid plants were cloned by culturing nodal segments. Nodal segments with well-developed roots and shoots were transferred to the soil. Six hybrid plants were obtained from the B. juncea × B. kaber (Sinapis arvensis) cross from 40 cultured immature embryos. Differently, a higher number of hybrid plants was obtained from the cross B. rapa × B. kaber. In fact, 32 hybrid plants were obtained from 50 recovered immature embryos. The fertility and ability to produce backcross progeny of the hybrid plants were also tested, and the auxinic-herbicide-resistant trait was introgressed into B. juncea through backcross breeding [134].\n\nA similar procedure was used to introduce tolerance to dicamba (an auxin herbicide) from wild mustard (S. arvensis) into canola. The ER technique followed by conventional breeding was used [135]. Immature siliques were collected from 3 to 5 DAP. The siliques were cultured for two weeks on two different culture media: an MS [72] with Gamborg vitamin [71] medium supplemented with 3% sucrose and 500 mg L−1 casein hydrolysate, and a medium containing MS salts [72] with Gamborg vitamins [71], 3% sucrose, 0.5 mg L−1 NAA, and 2.5 mg L−1 of kinetin. Subsequently, the ovules recovered from the siliques were cultured on the same medium. All cultures were incubated at 24 °C with a 16 h photoperiod. The regenerated seedlings were transferred into a medium containing MS salts [72] with Gamborg vitamins [71] and 1.5% sucrose. Nodal segments, cultured in the same growing medium, were used to multiply well-rooted seedlings. Rooted nodal segments were transferred into the soil. Intergeneric hybrids between S. arvensis (2n = 2x = 18) and B. napus (2n = 4x = 38) were produced, and dicamba tolerance was introgressed into B. napus through seven generations of backcrossing.\n\nPen et al. [136] performed a comprehensive series of interspecific crosses to introduce desirable characteristics such as orange/yellow color in cabbage and increased anthocyanin biosynthesis in Chinese cabbage (B. rapa subsp. pekinensis). Interspecific hybridizations between Chinese cabbage and cabbage were conducted using Chinese cabbage cultivars as the female parent. Additionally, Chinese cabbage cultivars have been used as male parents in crosses with allopolyploids, B. juncea and B. napus. The use of ER was crucial for the successful development of hybrid embryos. Isolated ovules were cultured on solidified MS medium [72] with 30 g L−1 sucrose. The cultured embryos were maintained at 23 ± 2 °C under a 13 h photoperiod, and germinated embryos produced shoots within 15–20 days after isolation. Rooted plants were obtained from shoots grown on MS basal salts within 35–40 days. The authors showed that embryos at 15 DAP were the most suitable material for ER in B. rapa × B. oleracea crosses, while embryos at 20 DAP were ideal for allopolyploid–diploid ((B. napus × B. juncea) × B. rapa)) crosses. Through their breeding program based on wide interspecific hybridization and selection, Pen et al. [136] successfully selected cabbage plants with orange/yellow inner leaves and Chinese cabbage leaves with higher anthocyanin content. These results hold the potential to produce interspecific hybrids and the development of biofortified cultivars within the genus Brassica (Table 1).\n\nTon et al. [137] reviewed the traits that should be molecularly characterized and mapped. This would make their transfer into canola and other Brassicaceae species more feasible. The authors reported both genes for resistance to biotic (e.g., blackleg disease, caused by Leptosphaeria maculans; clubroot, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae; and stem rot, caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) and abiotic (e.g., heat, drought, cold, and salinity) stresses. They highlighted a study on pan-genomics of B. oleracea, which identified many candidate genes for disease resistance in wild species B. macrocarpa [138]. Recently, the clubroot-resistant gene CRd from Chinese cabbage was transferred to canola through interspecific hybridization [139]. Powdery mildew, caused by Erysiphe cruciferarum, is another epidemic pathogen of rapeseed. Gong et al. [140] found a cultivar of Brassica carinata with powdery mildew resistance. Through interspecific hybridization followed by a molecular-marker-assisted selection (MAS) program, pathogen resistance was introduced into B. napus (Table 1). The use of ER-assisted interspecific hybridization, the MAS program and genome editing were suggested as suitable approaches for improving canola’s resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses.\n\nSome varieties of Brassica nigra are resistant to blackleg disease and have been used in a breeding program to introduce resistance to Leptosphaeria maculans in B. rapa [141]. Triploid hybrids (2n = 3x = 27, genome ABC) were produced through the cross of B. napus × B. nigra with the support of ER, and allohexaploid hybrids (2n = 6x = 54, genome AABBCC) were obtained by a chromosomal doubling of triploids. These hybrids demonstrated resistance to the disease inherited from the parent B. nigra. Therefore, cytological analysis and in situ hybridization suggested the introgression of blackleg resistance from the B genome of B. nigra into the genomes of B. rapa. However, allohexaploids displayed extreme genomic instability [141].\n\nThree clubroot-resistant Chinese cabbage varieties were identified and used in an ER-supported hybridization program to transfer clubroot resistance genes to B. napus [142]. The ER technique involved the collection of embryos at 15 DAP and culturing them in liquid B5 medium [71] supplemented with 2% sucrose. For the early stages of development, the cultures were placed at 25 °C under a 16 h photoperiod. Once the cotyledons were visible, embryos were transferred to a solid B5 medium [71] supplemented with 2% sucrose. Cytological analysis and MAS were used to identify 297 true hybrids, and among them, 159 hybrids were detected as clubroot resistant using molecular markers linked to resistance genes. These varieties were introduced in improvement programs for introgression resistance in commercial lines of B. napus [142] (Table 1).\n\nCauliflower (Brassica oleracea botrytis group, 2n = 18, genome CC) is one of the most extensively grown Brassica vegetables worldwide. However, it is susceptible to black rot disease caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) (Pammel) Dowson, which is a major pathogen of the Brassica genus [143]. Brassica carinata A. Braun (2n = 4x = 34, genome BBCC) is an important oilseed crop native to the Ethiopian plateau. B. carinata possesses genes controlling resistance/tolerance traits for both biotic and abiotic stresses, including resistance to Xcc [144,145]. Hybridization and backcrossing were performed to transfer the black rot resistance genes present in the B genome of B. carinata to cauliflower, resulting in the generation of interspecific hybrids and backcross progeny (BC1) [146]. However, hybridization between diploid and tetraploid species is challenging due to various reproductive barriers occurring at different stages, such as pollination incompatibility to pre- and post-fertilization barriers [146]. Overcoming these barriers using ER has proven effective in developing interspecific hybrids in Brassica [59,147,148]. Successful application of the direct in vitro ovule culture technique facilitated the development of mature hybrid plants (i.e., B. oleracea × B. carinata), and marker analyses confirmed the introgression of black rot resistance into the interspecific BC1 population [146]. Several attempts were also made to transfer some genes from alien Brassica spp. To B. oleracea, such as resistance to powdery mildew [149], downy mildew [150], black rot [151], atrazine [147], and male sterility [152] (Table 1).\n\nThe diversification of CMS is essential to mitigate the risk of pathogen attacks. Bathia et al. [153] developed a novel CSM system by creating sesquidiploids and backcross progenies involving the cybrid Brassica napus with the cytoplasm of B. tournefortii (Tour) and B. oleracea. In vitro culture of ovaries and ovules was essential to recover interspecific hybrids. The pollinated buds of the male sterile line were cultured in media at five different intervals from pollination. For example, in the cross between B. napus × PSBK-1, 372 ovules taken at different stages of development were cultured. None of the ovules were vital when sampled at 4, 13, and 16 DAP. In contrast, 14 mature ovules were obtained from isolation at 7 and 10 DAP. These results demonstrate how critical the timing is for efficient ovule culture. The backcross population developed with the Tour cytoplasm will be helpful for the development of a stable CMS system in B. oleracea as an alternative to the Ogura CSM (Table 1).\n\nInterspecific hybrids of Brassica juncea × B. tournefortii were obtained through the in vitro ER of hybrid embryos, as demonstrated by Kumar et al. [154]. Embryos were harvested from ovules at 20, 25, and 30 DAP and cultured on MS basal medium [72] with three different combinations of PGRs [154]. Cultures were grown at 25 °C under a 16 h photoperiod. The regenerated shoots were transferred to MS medium supplemented with 2 mg L−1 of BAP and 0.2 mg L−1 of NAA. Plants were transferred to soil and grown to maturity. Notably, a hybrid plant exhibited tolerance to aphid attacks, and it was partially fertile. In addition, the F2 and BC1 progenies displayed a wide range of morphological traits, and several plants with desirable characteristics, such as reduced aphid infections, drought tolerance, and high yield, were selected [154] (Table 1).\n\nIn the Cucumis genus, strong sexual incompatibility in interspecific and intergeneric crosses restricted the rapid development of new cultivars with desirable traits, such as disease resistance, insect resistance, flavor, and sweetness [155,156]. It would be advantageous to introduce new genes to increase genetic variability and improve the quality and productivity of melon fruits. Over the last 25 years, various biotechnological techniques have been developed. In addition to genetic transformation and in vitro regeneration to exploit somaclonal variability in embryos and adventitious shoots, ER has proven useful for the introgression of traits from wild species [156]. For example, hybrid embryos were successfully recovered through ER after interspecific crosses, such as C. melo × C. metuliferus [157], C. metuliferus × C. anguria [158], and C. melo × C. anguria L. var. longipes [159].\n\nInterspecific hybridization in the genus Trifolium using conventional crossing techniques was largely unsuccessful. Post-zygotic barriers are the primary cause of reproductive isolation, resulting in endosperm disintegration and abnormal differentiation, leading to the starvation of the hybrid embryo. Consequently, the application of ER techniques has been employed to save embryos from new combinations of interspecific hybrids (reviewed by Roy et al. [92]). ER has been utilized in interspecific hybridization programs involving Trifolium ambiguum, T. pratense, T. montanum, T. occidentale, T. isthomocarpum, T. repens, T. nigrescens, T. uniflorum, T. sarosiense, T. alexandrinum, T. apertum, T. resupinatum, T. constantinopolitanum, T. rubens, and T. alpestre [92]. For example, the ER technique was successfully used in the cross T. alexandrinum × T. constantinopolitanum. Pollination was carried out 2 days after emasculation. Embryos at the heart stage were grown on basal MS medium [72] supplemented with 2.3 μM kinetin and 3% sucrose. From more than 600 crosses, 33 embryos were taken and cultured. Shoots emerged between one and two weeks after inoculation. Seedlings survived only after inoculation with Rhizobium. The hybrid plants showed intermediate morphological characteristics, with 55 to 65% pollen fertility and a chromosome number of 2n = 2x =16.\n\nInterspecific hybridization has played a crucial role in the genetic enhancement in yield in chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.). Wild species and old cultivars provide a wider genetic base for crop species and provide a potential source of resistance genes against biotic and abiotic stresses, in particular, tolerance to cold and drought conditions, as well resistance to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris, cyst nematode (Heterodera ciceri), Ascochyta rabiei, phytophthora root rot, Botrytis cinerea, leaf miner and bruchids, and pod borer (Helicoverpa armigera) [160,161,162,163,164]. Among the different annual wild Cicer species, the successful hybridization of C. arietinum has been achieved only with C. reticulatum and C. echinospermum [162,163]. Conversely, significant pre-fertilization barriers were observed in the C. arietinum × C. songaricum cross, including poor pollen grain germination and a lack of pollen tube penetration in the style tissues [165]. Moreover, strong post-zygotic reproductive barriers in the cross C. arietinum × C. pinnatifidum resulted in poor seed set, high hybrid embryo necrosis, albinism, and poor aptitude to form roots [166]. The occurrence of embryo abortion in all crosses, except with C. reticulatum, clearly demonstrated the presence of post-fertilization barriers to reduce cross ability. Excising fertilized ovules and cultivating them on artificial media could offer a potential means to overcome these barriers and facilitate the transfer of desirable traits from these species [167,168,169,170].\n\nIn many regions of the world, the production of beans faces significant challenges due to various biotic and abiotic stresses, such as Ascochyta blight, bean golden mosaic virus (BGMV), and bean fly. To combat these diseases, interbreeding with P. coccineus L. or P. polyanthus Greenm. has been found to enhance resistance in P. vulgaris [171]. The authors showed that the use of P. coccineus and P. polyanthus as female parents was essential for successful interspecific crosses, which prevent rapid reversal to the recurrent parent P. vulgaris. However, post-zygotic incompatibility barriers cause an early hybrid embryo abortion, limiting the success of F1 crosses. Therefore, Geerts et al. [171] optimized an ER technique to improve hybridization and produce healthy hybrid plants. In this method, pods at 2 DAP were recovered. In aseptic conditions, the immature embryos were isolated and cultured. Then, dehydrated embryos were grown in a culture medium for germination. Plantlets were obtained after rooting. Subsequently, healthy plants were acclimated by raising them in the soil until maturity.\n\nCapsicum baccatum has been reported as a valuable source of genetic variation for many different traits to improve common pepper (C. annuum). However, the presence of strong barriers to interspecific hybridization has hindered successful crosses. To overcome these barriers, Manzur et al. [172] performed a comparative study involving two hybridization approaches: (i) genetic bridge species using C. chinense and C. frutescens, and (ii) direct cross between C. annuum and C. baccatum combined with in vitro ER. The results showed that C. chinense served as an effective bridge species between C. annuum and C. baccatum, while C. frutescens gave poor results. Concerning the ER strategy, the best success was achieved with the C. annuum (female) × C. baccatum (male) cross. Furthermore, the production of plants from the first backcrosses to C. annuum (BC1) was only possible through the in vitro culture of immature embryos [172]. In particular, Manzur et al. [172] performed about 2500 hybridizations. Then, immature fruits of about 25–30 DAP were collected. A solidified half-strength MS medium [72] was supplemented with 0.01 mg L−1 IAA, 0.01 mg L−1 GA3, 0.01 mg L−1 zeatin, and 40 g L−1 sucrose. Embryos were cultured at 25 ± 1 °C for first five days, in complete darkness. After day 6, cultures were incubated under a 16 h photoperiod. In total, more than 1000 immature seeds were cultured. After 30 days of culture, healthy seedlings were acclimated in vivo. F1 seedlings at the four-leaf stage were transferred to pots in the greenhouse for morphological and hybridity evaluation by analysis of simple sequence repeats (SSR) marker. As reported previously, using C. baccatum as the male parent provided the highest efficiency in fruit set and the number of regenerated hybrids. Fruit set was achieved in 67% of C. annuum × C. baccatum combinations, although the efficiency rate varied greatly (from 4 to 30%) depending on the genotypes used in the cross.\n\nTomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) has been hybridized with the sexually incompatible L. peruvianum. However the endosperm failed to develop, resulting in embryo abortion. The hybrid embryo was carefully isolated on a tissue culture medium, and typical development occurred [173]. This approach has proven effective in transferring some resistance to various pathogens in cultivated species, including tobacco mosaic virus, tomato spotted wilt virus, root-knot nematode, and pathogenic fungi.\n\nResistance to papaya ringspot virus has been transferred to papaya from the incompatible and resistant Carica cauliflora using ER to facilitate the development of hybrid embryos [174]. The fruits were harvested at 65 DAP and sterilized. The ovules were excised and cultured on solidified and modified MS medium [72]. The amount of iron was reduced, and the medium was supplemented with 60 g L−1 sucrose, 400 mg L−1 glutamine, and coconut water (20% v/v). The callus produced from the ovules was removed and subcultured on the same medium. Subsequently, the callus was transferred into a liquid medium to induce efficient somatic embryogenesis. Well-differentiated regenerated seedlings were obtained from somatic embryos cultured on a medium supplemented with BA and NAA. All cultures were maintained at 25 °C under a 16 h photoperiod. Sixty seedlings derived from somatic embryos were subjected to isoenzyme analysis. The results suggested that the somatic embryos obtained from the ovules of interspecific hybridization between C. papaya and C. cauliflora were probably of hybrid origin. In the hybrids, the undesirable wild traits were removed from the breeding population by performing successive backcrosses with cultivated papaya [174].\n\nWild soybean species have been intensively used to extend the genetic variability of Glycine max in breeding programs (reviewed by Chung and Singh [175]). In these crosses, ER ensured key support in obtaining healthy hybrid plants [176,177,178,179,180,181]. Remarkably, wild perennial Glycine species harbor several resistance genes toward soybean rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi Sydow) [182,183,184], soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) [185], soybean brown spot (Septoria glycines Hemmi.) [186], alfalfa mosaic virus [187], bean pod mottle virus [188], white mold (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary) [189], 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) [190], and chloride [191]. With the development of a wide cross methodology, these valuable traits might be successfully transferred to the soybean. For example, Bodanese-Zanettini et al. [177] obtained successful crosses using 9 Brazilian soybean lines as female parents and 12 accessions belonging to Glycine canescens, G. microphylla, G. tabacina, and G. tomentella. Immature hybrid pods were harvested between 20 and 30 DAP. After pod sterilization, embryos were excised and cultured. The cultures were maintained at 25 ± 1 °C with a 16 h photoperiod. Embryos were cultured in B5 medium [71] supplemented with 500 mg L−1 glutamine, 100 mg L−1 serine, 250 mg L−1 asparagine, 250 mg L−1 casein hydrolysate, 1 μM BAP, 0.1 μM NAA, and 4% sucrose. Embryos were excised at different stages of development. Therefore, after about 20 days (for larger embryos) or 60 days (for smaller embryos), the embryos were transferred to B5 medium [71] with 10% sucrose and 0.5% activated charcoal. After two months, mature and dormant embryos were transferred to SH medium [98] supplemented with 1% sucrose. Rooted seedlings were transplanted into pots and brought to maturity. About 37% of the immature embryos developed into seedlings, and about 8% produced mature plants. Cytological chromosome number analyses conducted on root apices and at spore meiosis, combined with leaf isoenzyme analyses, were used to identify the hybrid status of the obtained plants [177]. More recently, Singh and Nelson [192] optimized methods to rescue F1, amphidiploid, BC1, BC2, BC3, and fertile soybean plants derived from crosses of soybean with 26 wild perennial Glycine species (e.g., Glycine tomentella, G. argyrea, and G. latifolia). The development of an efficient ER method was essential to achieve these results. Although most F1 seeds failed to reach maturity and were aborted, seeds from 19 to 21 DAP pods were cultured aseptically in various medium formulations, leading to the development of hybrid plantlets [192]. Morphological variants among 40-chromosome plants were identified in both BC3F2 and BC4F2 generations. These characteristics include, among others, white flowers, delayed flowering, seeds shattered after pod maturation, plant vigor, broad leaves, seed coat color, and soybean rust resistance [192].\n\nDowny mildew, caused by Plasmopara viticola (Berk. and Curt.) Berl. and de Toni, is a destructive grapevine disease commonly controlled worldwide through fungicide treatments [193]. However, conventional breeding approaches also rely on natural sources of resistance found in wild grapevine (Vitis) species. A highly efficient ER technique was developed to support the survival of hybrid embryos obtained from crosses using Vitis vinifera cultivars as female parents and Chinese wild Vitis species as male parents. The aim was to breed disease-resistant and seedless grape cultivars [194]. More recently, new high-quality cultivars of seedless and disease-resistant grapes were obtained from a stenospermocarpic Vitis vinifera L. used as female parents in a cross with Chinese wild Vitis [195]. ER was used to rescue immature hybrid embryos to prevent their degradation, and several F1 hybrids were successfully obtained. Molecular markers were used to identify more than 300 seedless plantlets, and 2 F1 progenies resistant to downy mildew were detected [195].\n\nGiancaspro et al. [196] developed a complex yet effective ER method for obtaining seedless fruits in table grape varieties. After crosses, immature fertilized ovules from stenospermocarpic berries were grown on culture media suitable for ovule and embryo development. The ovules were maintained for 8 weeks at 25 °C in the dark, with regular transfers to fresh medium every two weeks. The ovule culture medium or embryo development medium contained the inorganic ingredients of the Emershad and Ramming medium [197] supplemented with 6% sucrose, 4 mM asparagine, and 0.3% activated charcoal. For embryo germination and shoot development, a solid WPM medium [99] supplemented with 2% sucrose, 4 mM asparagine, 0.3% activated charcoal, 5.7 μM IAA, 4.4 μM 6-BAP, and 1.4 μM GA3 was used. In the second stage of the ER protocol, the larger healthy seeds that developed from the immature ovules of 8 weeks from were directly plated on a solid WPM medium [99] to induce embryo germination. The rooting medium consisted of a mixture of half-strength MS salts supplemented with 0.3% agar and 1.7 µM IAA. The immature seeds were halved, and the embryo–ovules were embedded with the cut surface in contact with solid soil. Embryo germination was conducted for 8 weeks at 20 ± 2 °C with a 16 h photoperiod. The third stage of the ER protocol involved transferring the young shoots to glass flasks containing a solid rooting medium. For acclimatization, shoots with well-developed roots were transplanted into pots containing a synthetic soil mixture [196]. The results obtained from this protocol allowed the following conclusions: the best conditions were achieved by immature ovules at 40 DAP and inducing embryo germination for 8 weeks; hybrids of the Thompson, Superior, and Regal cultivars showed the highest efficiency of embryo germination; furthermore, the highest percentage of viable plants was obtained from ovules taken at 50 DAP from the progenies of the cross Luisa × Thompson.\n\nTable 1. Some examples where the embryo rescue (ER) supports introgression of useful traits from wild species or other crops into dicot crops or hybrids.\n\nCropsTraitsIntrogressed from Wild/CropsReferencesBrassica rapa1 CMS and RfpBrassica napus[133]Brassica napusTolerance to herbicidesSinapis arvensis[135]Brassica junceaTolerance to herbicidesBrassica kaber (S. arvensis)[134]Brassica junceaTolerance to aphidsBrassica tournefortii[154]Brassica junceaTolerance to droughtBrassica tournefortii[154]Brassica rapaTolerance to herbicidesBrassica kaber (S. arvensis)[134]Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensisYellow/orange color of petalsBrassica juncea × B. rapa[136]Brassica napusClubroot-resistant gene, CRdBrassica rapa subsp. pekinensis[139,142]Brassica napusResistance to blackleg diseaseBrassica nigra[141]Brassica oleracea var. botrytisResistance to black rot diseaseBrassica carinata[146]Brassica oleraceaResistance to atrazineBrassica napus[147]Brassica oleracea var. capitataResistance to Plasmodiophora brassicaeBrassica napus[150]Brassica oleracea var. botrytisResistance to powdery mildewBrassica carinata[149]Brassica oleraceaResistance to black rot diseaseBrassica spp.[151]Brassica oleraceaMale sterilityBrassica napus[152]Brassica oleraceaCMS TourBrassica tournefortii[153]Phaseolus vulgarisResistance to Ascochyta blightPhaseolus coccineus[171]Phaseolus vulgarisResistance to bean golden mosaic virusPhaseolus polyanthus[171]Phaseolus vulgarisResistance to bean flyPhaseolus coccineus[171]Solanum lycopersicumResistance to tobacco mosaic virusSolanum peruvianum[173]Solanum lycopersicumResistance to tomato spotted wilt virusSolanum peruvianum[173]Solanum lycopersicumResistance to root-knot nematodeSolanum peruvianum[173]Carica papayaResistance to papaya ringspot virusCarica cauliflora[174]Vitis viniferaResistance to Plasmopora viticolaChinese wild Vitis spp.[193,195]Vitis viniferaSeedlessChinese wild Vitis spp.[194,195]Vitis viniferaSeedlessVitis vinifera[196]Glycine maxResistance to cyst nematodeGlycine tomentella[185]Gypsophila paniculataDouble flowersGypsophila manginii[121]Gentiana scabraFlower colorGentiana straminea[118]Gentiana trifloraFlower morphologyGentiana paradoxa[118]Gentiana paradoxa (female)Petaloid stamenGentiana septemfida (male)[118]Campanula carpaticaFlower shapeCampanula carpatica[117]Campanula mediumTolerance to coldCampanula formanekiana[117]Chrysanthemum × grandiflorumResistance to aphidsChrysanthemum przewalskii[15,112]Chrysanthemum × grandiflorumTolerance to heatChrysanthemum makinoi[15]Chrysanthemum × grandiflorumTolerance to droughtChrysanthemum indicum[114]Chrysanthemum × morifoliumTolerance to saltArtemisia japonica[115]Dendranthema crissumHeterosisCrossostephium chinense[116]Camellia japonicaYellow color of petalsCamellia chrysantha[120]\n\n4.1.2. Monocot Species\n\nBread wheat (Triticum aestivum, 2n = 6x = 42, genome AABBDD) suffers from low genetic variation due to its recent origin from one or a limited number of hybridization events, subsequent domestication, and selection, about 10,000 years ago [198]. Emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccum and dicoccoides, 2n = 4x = 28, genome AABB), durum wheat (T. turgidum subsp. durum, 2n = 4x = 28, genome AABB), T. timopheevii (2n = 4x = 28, genome AAGG), and Aegilops species containing the D genome offer excellent sources of genetic variability for bread wheat improvement. In particular, beneficial characteristics, such as tolerance to cold and salt, leaf and stem rust resistance, and resistance to cereal cyst and root-knot nematodes, exist within the allopolyploid Aegilops species [199]. However, the potential of these allopolyploids as a source of genetic variability still needs to be explored (reviewed by Mirzaghaderi and Mason [200]). In addition, crosses involving Aegilops species often encounter post-zygotic barriers, necessitating ER to develop synthetic wheat lines [201]. Approximately 200 different cross combinations were performed between diverse wheat genotypes and Aegilops species, including emmer wheat × Ae. tauschii (2n = DD or DDDD), durum wheat (2n = 4x = 28, genome AABB) × Ae. tauschii, T. timopheevii × Ae. tauschii, Ae. crassa × durum wheat, Ae. cylindrica × durum wheat, and Ae. ventricosa × durum wheat crosses [199]. However, it is essential to note that in some crosses, such as tetraploid wheat × Ae. tauschii, the production of hybrid seeds was low. Therefore, ER was crucial for obtaining viable hybrids. Seeds unable to complete maturation were isolated, sterilized, and soaked overnight in distilled water at 4 °C. The seed coat was removed, and the embryos were cultured on solidified MS medium [72] supplemented with vitamins. The cultures were maintained at 22–24 °C under a 16 h photoperiod. The seedlings were subsequently transferred to soil and brought to maturity. However, although the average outcrossing ability between T. turgidum × Ae. tauschii was very low (0.062), more than fifty hexaploid and octaploid F2 lineages were successfully obtained through the in vitro rescue of F1 embryos and the spontaneous production of F2 seeds from F1 plants. Notably, crosses such as T. durum × Ae. tauschii, Ae. crassa × T. durum, Ae. cylindrica × T. durum, and Ae. ventricosa × T. durum displayed highly significant morphological and nutritional differences in characteristics, such as the number of tillers and nodes, peduncle length, flag leaf dimension, spikelets per spike, spikelet length, awn length, plant height, and levels of Fe and Zn adsorbed. These genetic resources could be utilized to enhance genetic variation in wheat through crossbreeding and recurrent backcrossing [199].\n\nThe productivity of bread wheat is often hindered by both biotic and abiotic stresses. To counter them, continuous efforts are underway to introduce new resistance/tolerance traits into wheat cultivars, taking advantage of the genetic diversity in wheat and related species. The species rye (Secale cereale, 2n = 2x = 14, genome RR) has been extensively used to increase stress resistance in wheat. The first stable amphidiploid Triticale (Triticosecale Wittmack) was obtained by W. Rimpau in 1888 [202], followed by subsequent attempts to produce wheat–rye hybrids. Homoeologous pairing between rye and wheat allows the introduction of desirable agronomic traits into wheat from rye, including resistance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Since the 1950s, addition, substitution, and translocation lines have been created from these crosses and have played a significant role in wheat genetic improvements (extensively reviewed by Crespo-Herrera et al. [203]).\n\nThe incorporation of various rye genes into wheat confers resistance against fungal pathogens, such as leaf rust (Puccinia triticina Erikss.), yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis var. striiformis Westend), stem rust (Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici Erikss. and E. Henn.), and powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis (DC.) f. sp. tritici Em. Marchal). Additionally, rye genes confer resistance to some of the most important grain pests, including aphid species such as Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), Rhopalosiphum padi L., and Sitobion avenae (F.); the cecidomyid Mayetiola destructor (Say); the nematodes Heterodera avenae (Wollenweber) and Heterodera filipjevi (Madzhidov) Stelter; and the mite Aceria tosichell Keifer. Furthermore, the tolerance of rye to abiotic stresses, like aluminum toxicity and acidic soils, can be utilized in wheat improvement efforts [203].\n\nAn et al. [204] developed a crossbreeding program between Triticum aestivum and Secale cereale to create addition lines of wheat with the rye chromosome 6, which possesses the Pm20 gene on its long arm (Table 2).\n\nThe Pm20 gene confers powdery mildew resistance. Twelve plants were obtained from immature embryos cultured on MS medium [72]. Six 2n = 6x = 56 amphidiploid plants were synthesized following chromosome complement doubling with colchicine. After powdery mildew resistance screening, the six plants were backcrossed to wheat. BC1F1-resistant plants were subsequently used as female plants and crossed continuously with wheat. Powdery mildew resistance tests and karyological analyses were performed on BC2F1 plants. Resistant plants of putative monosomic addition lines with chromosome number 2n = 43 were self-pollinated. The plant with chromosome number 2n = 44 was selected and continuously self-pollinated for five generations. During this breeding process, each plant was selected for resistance to powdery mildew, morphological similarity with wheat, and the high number of seeds produced. Finally, a fertile and genetically stable line with homogeneous resistance, designated WR49-1, was selected. Molecular analyses, including GISH (genomic in situ hybridization), mc-FISH (multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization), mc-GISH (multicolor-GISH), and EST (expressed sequence tag) showed that WR49-1 represented a new wheat–rye 6R disomic addition line. WR49-1 adult plants displayed high levels of resistance to wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Bgt). Notably, young WR49-1 seedlings showed high resistance levels against 19 out of 23 Bgt isolates. Therefore, WR49-1 seedlings could have novel powdery mildew resistance genes distinct from Pm20 on the 6RL chromosome arm of rye. Because of its cytological stability and agronomic traits of interest, WR49-1 holds promise as a bridging addition line in wheat breeding. Recent research has suggested that the region on the long arm of rye chromosome 6, called YT2, likely harbors genes conferring powdery mildew resistance in a different chromosomal region than Pm20 [205]. These findings are significant for seeking new sources of resistance, especially against fungal pathogens, because their rapid genetic variation often allows them to overcome resistance in recently improved varieties. A recommended strategy is gene pyramiding to enhance resistance durability, which involves incorporating resistance against multiple fungal strains [206].\n\nAn et al. [207] performed a Triticum aestivum × Secale cereale cross to evaluate resistances to some pathogens. Hybrid embryos of 16–18 DAP were isolated and cultured on MS medium [72]. Seventeen mature plants were obtained. Chromosome complement doubling with 0.05% colchicine led to the generation of nine amphidiploid plants (2n = 6x= 56). These amphidiploids were tested for resistance against Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) isolates and a race mixture of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). The resistant progenies were backcrossed with bread wheat, resulting in the development of a line named WR35, which exhibited resistance to both powdery mildew and stripe rust. The authors employed sequential GISH, mcFISH, and ND-FISH (non-denaturing FISH) techniques with multiple probes, mc-GISH, analysis of rye chromosome arm-specific markers, and SLAF-seq (sequencing of amplified fragments of specific locus) to demonstrate that WR35 was a disomic 4R wheat–rye line (2n = 44). WR35 showed cytological stability and high productivity. At the adult stage, WR35 displayed high resistance to powdery mildew (Bgt), stripe rust (Pst), and Rhizoctonia cerealis. Moreover, at the seedling stage, WR35 exhibited resistance to twenty-two Bgt isolates and four Pst races, indicating its resistance to multiple diseases. An et al. [207] suggested that WR35 could represent a promising parent for wheat chromosome engineering (Table 2).\n\nIn addition to traditional breeding approaches, character transfer from rye to wheat can also be undertaken through in vitro culture of immature embryos from the wheat–rye hybrid (genome AABBDDRR) [208]. In fact, it is well known that in vitro culture, particularly when a prolonged callogenesis phase precedes the development of adventitious shoots and/or embryos, can induce a wide range of genetic and epigenetic modifications. In regenerated plants, these include chromosomal instability, leading to changes in chromosome number, chromosome breaks, deletions, translocations often resulting from the activation of transposable elements, and gene mutations [209]. Lapitan et al. [208] cultured in vitro immature (11–13 DAP) wheat–rye hybrid embryos. Calli that originated from two embryos were cultured for 222 days in media supplemented with 0.5 mg L−1 of 2,4-D. The regenerated plantlets were transplanted and cloned. To induce amphidiploids, plants were backcrossed with wheat or treated with colchicine. Through this process, wheat–wheat and wheat–rye chromosome translocations, deletions, and amplifications of heterochromatin bands of rye chromosomes were identified. These results suggested a high degree of structural changes induced by tissue culture in the chromosomes of wheat and rye. Therefore, tissue culture may be a useful tool in alien gene introgression in both wheat and Triticale improvement.\n\nWild barley (Hordeum bulbosum) exhibits resistance to powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis D.C. f. sp. hordei Marchal), whereas winter barley (H. vulgare and H. sativum) is susceptible to the infection. Interspecific hybrid plants resistant to powdery mildew were obtained through the ER of hybrid embryos [210]. Subsequently, powdery mildew resistance was introgressed into H. vulgare by H. bulbosum by crosses between four diploid barley cultivars and a landrace of tetraploid H. bulbosum [211] (Table 2). The embryos were cultured in B5 medium [71] without PGRs. The dissection of embryos was performed at 8–10 DAP. The hybrids followed by backcrosses to H. vulgare were performed, and molecular mapping revealed the translocation of chromosomal regions from H. bulbosum containing the powdery mildew resistance. In addition, the segregation observed in BC2 plants also suggested the presence of a single dominant gene responsible for the transferred resistance [211].\n\nIn the genus Asparagus, there are several wild relatives of A. officinalis, including A. densiflorus, A. macrorrhizus, A. prostratus, A. maritimus, A. breslerianus, A. oligoclonos, A. pseudoscaber, A. brachyphyllus, A. tenuifolius, A. persicus, A. verticillatus, A. kasakstanicus, and A. kiusianus. These wild species harbor significant genetic variability and could serve as valuable genetic tools for the development of new varieties through interspecific hybridization (reviewed by Encina and Regalado [212]). Unfortunately, reproductive barriers, both pre- and post-zygotic, have hindered successful hybridization between A. officinalis and these wild species with potential breeding value. To circumvent this barrier, in vitro ER using ovule and ovary cultures has been tested in the A. officinalis × A. densiflorus cross [213]. A. densiflorus has resistance to several diseases caused by pathogens, such as Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. asparagi, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium proliferatum, and Fusarium solani [214,215]. However, despite the cultivation of 2032 ovules and 826 ovaries in vitro, no seedlings were obtained from the A. officinalis × A. densiflorus cross [213]. Histological studies revealed only protoderm differentiation, endosperm collapsed, and premature embryonic abortion.\n\nIn the genus Alstroemeria, interspecific hybridization followed by ER has been widely used as a breeding technique to obtain new varieties for the flower market. Winter-hardy hybrids were developed by using the Chilean species Alstroemeria aurea, while fragrant hybrids were generated using the Brazilian species Alstroemeria caryophyllaea (Table 2). The successful production of interspecific hybrids was promoted by the in vitro ovule culture [216]. Ovules were harvested at 10–23 DAP and cultured on 1/4 MS medium [72] under continuous dark conditions until germination. Seedlings were subcultured on basal MS medium [72] supplemented with 2 mg L−1 Benzyladenine (BA) until they reached sufficient size for rooting. After profuse root development, the plants were transferred to the greenhouse for acclimatization. Hybrids were evaluated both in the greenhouse and in the field. Noteworthily, these efforts resulted in new cultivars characterized by winter hardiness, blooming growth habits, and long flower stems [216]. Recently, a study reported the successful rescue of 3669 embryos from extensive interspecific hybridization within the genus Alstroemeria. Eighteen plants were evaluated morphologically, showing interesting characteristics for the ornamental plant market [217] (Table 2).\n\nThe African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is native to Africa and is currently distributed in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America. In Central America, oil palm plantations are affected by a wide variety of pests and diseases, which significantly reduce productivity. Fatal yellowing (FY) is the most damaging phytoplasma disease among them. Genetic resistance to this disease can be found in the germplasm of the American oil palm (E. oleifera), a native species from the Amazon rainforest [94]. However, the seeds obtained from the cross E. guineensis and E. oleifera had lower germination rates. To address this issue, an in vitro system for germinating hybrid embryos was developed. MS medium [72] supplemented with 110 mM glucose was the most effective. The emergence for shoots and rootlets was 97% and 73%, respectively. The survival rate of the seedlings 45 days after transplanting into the soil was 55%, and by the 4th month, 66 plants had produced sufficiently developed shoots and roots. Therefore, the method is satisfactory for transferring FY resistance of E. oleifera to E. guineensis [94].\n\nIn the Colchicaceae, intergeneric hybrids were produced through reciprocal crosses between Sandersonia aurantiaca and Littonia modesta [218] to generate new genotypes with improved features. The embryos were rescued by culturing ovules ranging from 14 to 30 DAP. The ovules were cultured on solidified KM medium [219] with salts, microelements, and vitamins B5 [71]. Furthermore, the medium was supplemented with 20 mL L−1 coconut water, 10 g L−1 sucrose, and 250 g L−1 casein hydrolysate. Cultures were maintained at 24 ± 2 °C under a 16 h photoperiod. Germinated embryos were cultured on solidified medium with half-strength MS salts [72], vitamins B5, and 10 g L−1 sucrose. The seedlings had grown to bulb production. Chromosome counts of S. aurantiaca, L. modesta, and the hybrids revealed chromosome numbers of 2n = 24, 22, and 23, respectively. Consequently, the hybrids were sterile, but their survival could be sustained by agamic reproduction [218]. Amano et al. [220] conducted an intergeneric hybridization program using six genotypes of Gloriosa spp., one genotype of L. modesta, and two genotypes of S. aurantiaca to increase genetic variability and obtain new cultivars. Through the ER of ovules, hybrids were obtained from several crosses: L. modesta × S. aurantiaca, L. modesta × S. aurantiaca “Phoenix”, L. modesta × G. superba “Lutea”, L. modesta × G. superba “Marron Gold”, S. aurantiaca × G. superba “Lutea”, and S. aurantiaca × G. “Marron Gold”. More than 3800 ovules were obtained from 32 intergeneric cross combinations. Ovules with placental tissues were cultured on solidified half-strength MS medium [72] supplemented with 0.01 mg L−1 NAA and 0.01 mg L−1 BA at 25 °C in the dark [221]. Rhizome-like structures were differentiated from ovules in 30 of 32 cross combinations. For shoot regeneration, ovules with rhizome-like structures were transferred to half-strength MS medium containing 0.25 mg L−1 NAA and 2.5 mg L−1 BA at 25 °C with a 16 h photoperiod. For rooting, the shoots were transferred to half-strength MS medium without PGRs. Rooted seedlings were able to produce small tubers that could be grown in soil. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses confirmed the hybrid nature of the obtained plants. Many of these crosses showed interesting morphological traits for the flower market, and some of these characteristics are listed in Table 2.\n\nIn Lilium spp., which comprises approximately 100 known species, interspecific hybridization has been widely used since the 1800s in breeding programs to produce attractive hybrids for the flower market (reviewed extensively by Marasek-Ciolakowska et al. [55,83]). Many characteristics have been introduced into commercial hybrids, including a short juvenile phase, early flowering, pink flower color, upright flowers, and yellow flower color. In addition, considering the enormous variability in many species in the genus Lilium, many other characteristics, such as those related to floral symmetry and the number and shape of corolla organs, can be introduced into commercialized species. One promising cross is between Oriental lilies and several species such as L. henryi, Asiatics, and trumpet lilies. However, both pre- and post-zygotic barriers can hinder hybridization in many cases, particularly between phylogenetically more distant species. Pre-zygotic barriers are efficiently overcome using the cut-style pollination technique, while ER techniques can be valuable for addressing post-zygotic barriers [55,83]. For the success of the ER in interspecific hybridization of the genus Lilium, several factors must be considered. Mainly, it is necessary to determine the direction of the crossing because unilateral incompatibility is often observed. The selection of genotype, both of the female and the male plant, is crucial for a successful cross. As in many other genera, a preliminary study is needed to identify the optimal DAP for the isolation of immature hybrid embryos. Several ER techniques are available, including the culture of embryos, ovules, and ovaries. With regard to the culture conditions, MS medium [72] was found the most suitable for the culture of immature embryos. It is necessary to obtain a high survival and germination rate of the hybrid embryos using media with a relatively sub-acidic pH (pH 5.0). Likewise, a medium supplemented with 20–40 g L−1 of sucrose and with a concentration of NAA considerably high (10−2–10−4 mg L−1) is often required. Generally, very small embryos need high concentrations of sugar. In general, embryo culture of Lilium spp. requires an optimal sucrose concentration of 6% or 3% sucrose plus 2% mannitol.\n\nKim et al. [65] successfully generated interspecific hybrids between two lily species, Lilium hansonii Leichtlin and L. brownie var. colchesteri, using conventional pollination and cutting-style methods. However, viable seeds were only obtained when L. hansonii was used as the female parent. These two species significantly differ in terms of biotic stress resistances and floral characteristics, making them promising candidates for obtaining interesting materials for the flower market. After the crosses, fruits were harvested at 60 DAP, and the seeds were collected and sterilized. The seeds were cultured on solidified MS medium supplemented with 30 g L−1 sucrose and 0.1 g L−1 activated carbon. Germination of the seeds occurred at 23 °C under a 12 h photoperiod. For immature seeds, the hybrid embryos were grown on the same culture medium for three weeks until the embryo reached a size of about 2~3 mm. Subsequently, the embryos were transferred to a fresh MS medium until they fully matured. Ninety-two hybrids were confirmed by SSR marker analysis. The hybrids exhibited distinct morphological features such as pollen and stigma color, plant height, flower diameter, the number of shoots, tepal size, and flower direction [65] (Table 2).\n\nER has been widely used to overcome post-fertilization barriers in interspecific crosses in the genus Tulipa (reviewed by Marasek-Ciolakowska et al. [55,83]). Interspecific crosses, Tulipa gesneriana × T. kaufmanniana Regel, T. gesneriana × (T. kaufmanniana Regel × T. greigii Regel), and T. gesneriana × (T. fosteriana Hoog × T. kaufmanniana Regel), were performed by Custers et al. [64]. The crosses aimed to obtain new hybrids with novel floral characteristics in both the color and shape of the floral organs. From unripe seed pods, ovules were collected, and in some cases, embryos were isolated. A single modified MS medium [72] was used to culture the ovules and immature embryos. The solidified medium was supplemented with 4% sucrose, 500 mg L−1 tryptone, and 4 μM NAA. To compare the culture efficiency of isolated embryos with that of ovules, the cultures were started at different DAPs, also in relation to the interspecific cross. The environmental conditions of cultivation are fundamental for bulbous plants such as the tulip [53,83,84]. The cultures were kept at 15 °C in the dark until 15 weeks after pollination. A treatment at 5 °C for 12 weeks was carried out to induce embryo germination. To obtain bulbils, seedlings were grown for 12–18 weeks at 15 °C. Maturation was carried out for 6 weeks at 22 °C. The bulbils were grown in soil at 5 °C for three months and transferred to 15 °C for germination. For efficient embryo retrieval, the time of collection was crucial. Optimal ER was reached in cultures that started 7 to 9 weeks after pollination. In addition, using ovule cultures significantly increased the efficiency of seedling formation. Interesting floral characteristics were observed in the hybrids, such as early flowering, dark base color of the corolla, long and pointed petals, and petals with a carmine-red dorsal band [64] (Table 2).\n\nTable 2.

Embryo Rescue to Recover Haploids, Dihaploids, Doubled Haploids, and Polyploid Embryos\n\nInterspecific and intergeneric crosses, in vitro culture of male (androgenesis) and female (gynogenesis) gametophytes, provide, for many species, powerful tools for manipulating ploidy to facilitate the selection and development of new crops. In addition, interspecific and intergeneric hybridizations are critical for generating disomic alien chromosome addition lines and alien chromosome substitution lines relevant"
