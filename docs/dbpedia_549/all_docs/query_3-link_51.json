        "text": "The research subject of this paper was conducted in Satu Mare County, Romania, where three strawberry cultivars have been studied, namely ‘Alba’, ‘Viktoriana’ and ‘Camarosa’, on two different types of mulch (black mulch and straw mulch). Observations, measurements, and determinations have been made regarding the growing vigor of the bushes, productivity and fruit quality. The productivity analysis favored the ‘Camarosa’ cultivar as highly productive, which is why this cultivar can be proposed for use in plantations. The different mulch types have significantly influenced the weight of the fruit quality, the highest weight being obtained on the black foil substrate. As for the fruit quality, the ‘Camarosa’ cultivar, which is very valuable from the qualitative point of view, obtained the highest average value of the sugar content measurements, precisely (8.7°Brix).\n\nHigh tunnels are economical season extension tools for strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) growers in nonmajor strawberry producing states in the United States (US), where grower competitiveness can be increased by off-season crop production. Six June-bearing (“Camarosa”, “Camino Real”, “Chandler”, “Fronteras”, “Sensation”, and “Strawberry Festival”) and two day-neutral (“Albion” and “San Andreas”) strawberry cultivars were transplanted on 18 November 2017 and evaluated for their growth, yield, quality, and time of fruit harvest in a high-tunnel production system in Mississippi (US Department of Agriculture (USDA) hardiness zone 8a) during one growing season from fall 2017 to spring 2018. Effects of black and red plastic mulches were compared in producing strawberries. The high tunnel raised daily air temperatures, provided frost protection, and resulted in advanced fruit harvest by 4–6 weeks compared to local field production with the first ripe fruit produced in early March. “Camino ...\n\nThe use of mulch contributes to the reduction of water consumption and weed infestation in strawberry cultivation. Recycled paper, being biodegradable, has great potential to replace plastics. Thus, the objective was to evaluate the water consumption and agronomic performance of strawberry subjected to different wetted areas and mulches. The wet areas tested were 40% (WA40) and 70% (WA70) imposed by a drip irrigation system. The different types of mulch were: white polyethylene (WHP), black polyethylene (BLP), recycled paper (REP) and no mulch (NM). BLP, REP and WHP mulches promoted the same weed control. The number of fruits per plant, fruit length, fruit yield, and water productivity did not differ for the factors wetted area and types of mulch. Higher fruit mass and diameter were found in the WA40 treatment, while the mulches favored only fruit mass. Thus, fruit yield showed no difference, and only water consumption differed between the wet areas and between the types of mulch. S...\n\nThe effects of three mulching systems on total yield, average yield per plant, average fruit weight, soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), firmness and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of two newly developed lines (‘Orléans’ and ‘Saint Pierre’), one advanced selection (‘SJ8976-1’) and two commonly used cultivars (‘Jewel’ and ‘Kent’) were evaluated. The studied mulching systems were: plastic mulch (PM), mulch with row cover (PMRC), and matted-row system (MRS). Results showed that plastic mulch with row cover (PMRC) generally increased yield per plant, average fruit weight, SSC, firmness and ORAC, but differences varied within harvest times. No significant differences in total yield and TA were observed under the selected mulching systems. Both PMRC and PM accelerated the harvest periods compared to MRS. ‘Kent’ and ‘Jewel’ had the highest total yield while ‘SJ8976-1’ and ‘St-Pierre’ had the highest average fruit weight. The highest SSC, TA and ORAC were found in ‘Jewel’. There was no interaction between the mulching systems and genotypes, indicating that the effect of production system is independent of cultivars. PMRC seems to be a better growing system, improving fruit quality and increasing the nutritional value of all genotypes. By allowing off-season fruit production in cool climates, PMRC can be an alternative method to the costly high tunnels.\n\nHigh tunnels are gaining in popularity in Canadian northern climates to prolong the growing season, increase yields and improve the quality of fruits and vegetables. An experiment in 2006 and 2007 was conducted under high tunnels and open fields to determine the effects of various plastic mulches on microclimate conditions, growth, yields and fruit quality of day-neutral strawberry. High tunnels (8.4 m wide, 4.8 m high and 145 m long) developed by Industries Harnois inc. were used at Les Fraises de l’Île d’Orléans inc. near Quebec City, Canada (latitude 47°, altitude 137 m). Four plastic mulches (green, grey on grey, white on black and black) obtained from Ginegar Plastics Products Ltd. were compared. Treatments were replicated four times and each experimental unit consisted of 26 strawberry plants of cultivar ‘Seascape’. Soil at a depth of 10 cm and air temperatures at a height of 20 cm were measured with Hobo temperature sensors obtained from MicroDaq Ltd. Plant growth was measured periodically, while yields were measured three times per week. All mulch treatments under the high tunnels produced higher yield than the outdoor control. Black mulch caused excessive soil and air temperatures in tunnels, but was found adequate for the open field."
