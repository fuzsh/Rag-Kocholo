Not only does it let you share what you are growing with friends and family, it unlocks a world of useful information, both in books and online, helping you to make the best of the plants you grow. But why do the names have to be in Latin? Many garden plants have English names that are much easier to remember. The trouble is, those names vary depending on who you talk to. In the United States, bluebell is a common name for plants in the Mertensia genus, but in Scotland a bluebell is Campanula rotundifolia and in England it is Hyacinthoides non-scripta. Not surprisingly, there are other bluebells, including desert bluebell (Phacelia campanularia) in California and royal bluebell (Wahlenbergia gloriosa) in Australia. There are even bluebell creepers, Clitoria ternatea in the United States and Asia as well as Billardiera heterophylla in Australia. With “bluebells” occurring seemingly worldwide, it is essential for each to have its own unique name, because the cultivation requirements for an English bluebell differ widely from those of its Antipodean namesakes. The decision to use Latin for this naming system stems largely from its historical use by scholars. A university education in the eighteenth century required familiarity with both Latin and Greek, allowing for students to access the works of classical writers from ancient Greece and Rome. Much of the “Latin” in use in horticulture is actually derived from Greek. How botanical Latin has changed over time, and botanical art alongside, is discussed on pages 12 and 17.\n\nThe enduring benefits of using this botanical tongue are that scientists, growers, and gardeners can communicate about plants with accuracy, no matter what language they speak. So whether it is bluebell (Scotland), harebell (England), bluebell-bellflower (United States), campanilla (Spanish), campanule à feuilles rondes (French), or rundblättrige glockenblume (German), it is universally Campanula rotundifolia. Latin names are not static, however, and new information is always being discovered—on page 20 we look at how DNA is revealing old and new relationships between plants. Understanding Latin names brings other benefits. Most obviously, they can reveal useful information that is helpful to the gardener. Armeria maritima thrives by the sea, while Geum rivale does not mind getting its feet wet. Toxicodendron is best avoided, while silky soft Alchemilla mollis is a pleasure to touch. Botanical Latin has other practical uses, too, which are discussed on page 22. Latin names also reveal fascinating stories, such as the tale of French diplomat Jean Nicot, who popularized tobacco, which now bears his name (Nicotiana), or the moving account of a promising Scottish botanist who fell during World War I and is commemorated for evermore (Briggsia). Delve into our dictionary of botanical Latin and you will find interest, inspiration, and intrigue in equal measure.\n\nleft :\n\nFrench diplomat Jean Nicot is immortalized in the Latin name for tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum.\n\n7\n\nHow to Use This Book The following section of the book contains about 5,000 Latin botanical terms arranged alphabetically. These are terms that you might come across either for the genus or the species name of a plant. The term appears first, then a guide to pronunciation. The following line provides the feminine and neuter versions of the name, if applicable, followed by the etymology of the word. This will explain the meaning (or meanings) behind the Latin term. For the genus entries, the family name is also included in parentheses at the end. An example of a plant name that features the term is also supplied. Where variations in spelling occur, they are grouped together, as in:\n\ncashmerianus kash-meer-ee-AH-nus\n\ncashmeriana, cashmerianum –\n\ncashmirianus\n\nkash-meer-ee-AH-nus\n\ncashmiriana, cashmirianum –\n\ncashmiriensis\n\nkash-meer-ee-EN-sis\n\ncashmiriensis, cashmiriense\n\nFrom or of Kashmir, as in Cupressus cashmeriana\n\n8\n\nWhere a genus term can also be used for a species, it is included in parentheses afterward. At the end of the book is an index of 2,000 of some of the most frequently used common names. Here, you can look up a plant that you know by its common name and find the Latin name. You can then look up what the Latin term means in the alphabetical listings section. Pronunciation of botanical Latin can vary, so the examples provided here are a guide rather than a definitive directive. Capital letters indicate where the stress should fall. Where gender variations occur, pronunciation is given for only the masculine version. Most gardeners will have encountered plants that seem to have not only numerous common names but also variations in their Latin appellations. Some epithets, which were once in wide usage, have now become obsolete, perhaps due to reclassification of the plants to which they were once applied. However, because these names may still sometimes be found in old horticultural works, as synonyms in modern texts, or when browsing the varied sources of the Internet, they have been included for completeness. The RHS Plant Finder by the Royal Horticultural Society in England provides a general guide to current nomenclatural opinion, if required, that is often used internationally as a reliable up-to-date source, but you can also check the USDA plants database for plants by their scientific or common names. Helped by an informed understanding of botanical nomenclature, it is hoped that gardeners will be able to make better gardens filled with better plants; plants that sit well in their site, thrive in the conditions provided for them, and have the form, habit, and color that make for the most aesthetically pleasing association with their neighbors.\n\nGenus name in Latin (if the name can also be used as a species name, this appears in parentheses afterward).\n\nAlyogyne al-ee-oh-GY-nee\n\nFrom Greek alytos, meaning “undivided,” and gyne, meaning “female,” because the styles are undivided (Malvaceae)\n\nA guide to pronunciation is provided and capital letters indicate where the emphasis should fall. Origin of the term is explained and Latin meaning.\n\nFamily name\n\nSpecies name in Latin. The masculine version appears first with other versions listed below.\n\namphibius\n\nGenus spotlight focuses on interesting details about key genera.\n\nam-FIB-ee-us\n\namphibia, amphibium\n\nGrowing both on land and in water, as in Persicaria amphibia When appropriate, an example is given of a plant name that features the Latin term.\n\nLines link entries that are different spelling variations with the same meaning.\n\nFact spotlight provides fascinating insights into botanical Latin.\n\nExtensive index of common names allows readers to find the Latin name for common plants, which can then be cross-referenced to the alphabetical listings.\n\n9\n\nA Guide to the Use of Latin When writing Latin names, it is important to order the various elements in the correct sequence and observe typographical conventions. This is a simplified outline of the binomial system, so there are exceptions to these rules, along with further complexities of structure. Because this is a book aimed at gardeners, not botanists, only the broad principles are dealt with here.\n\nSubspecies (for example, Acer negundo subsp. mexicanum)\n\nThis part of a plant’s name appears as lowercase italics and is preceded by the abbreviated form subsp. (or occasionally ssp.), which appears as lowercase roman type. It is a distinct variant of the main species.\n\nVarietas Family\n\n(for example, Acer palmatum var. coreanum)\n\n(for example, Sapindaceae)\n\nThis appears as lowercase italics and is preceded by the abbreviated form var., which appears as lowercase roman type. Also known as the variety, it is used to recognize slight variations in botanical structure.\n\nThis name appears as uppercase and lowercase, and the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature also recommends italics. Family names are easily recognized, because they end in -aceae.\n\nForma\n\nGenus\n\n(for example, Acer pseudoplatanus f. purpureum)\n\n(for example, Acer)\n\nWhen used, it appears as lowercase italics and is preceded by the abbreviated form f., which appears in roman type. Also known as the form, it distinguishes minor variations, such as the color of the flower.\n\nThis appears in italics with an uppercase initial letter. It is a noun and has a gender: masculine, feminine, or neuter. The plural term is genera. When listing several species of the same genus together, the genus name is often abbreviated, for example: Acer amoenum, A. barbinerve, and A. calcaratum.\n\nCultivar (for example, Acer forrestii ‘Alice’)\n\nSpecies (for example, Acer palmatum)\n\nThe species is a specific unit within the genus and the term is often referred to as the specific epithet. It appears in lowercase italics. The species name is mostly an adjective, but it can sometimes be a noun (for example, Agave potatorum, where the epithet means “of drinkers”). Adjectives always agree in gender with the genus name they follow, but nouns used as specific epithets are invariable. It is the combination of the generic and specific epithet that gives us the species name in the binomial, or two-word, system. 10\n\nThis part of the name appears as uppercase and lowercase roman type with single quotation marks. Also known as a named variety, it is applied to artificially maintained plants. Modern cultivar names (for example, those after 1959) should not include Latin or Latinized words.\n\nAcer palmatum\n\nHybrid\n\nGender\n\n(for example, Hamamelis × intermedia)\n\nIn Latin, adjectives must agree with the gender of the noun that they qualify; therefore in botanical names, the species must agree with the genus. An exception to this rule is made if the species name is a noun (for example, forrestii, “of Forrest”); in this instance, there is no genus and species agreement. To help familiarize the reader with the different gender forms, where a specific epithet appears, the masculine, feminine, and neuter versions are usually listed—for example, grandiflorus (grandiflora, grandiflorum).\n\nIt appears as uppercase and lowercase italics and is denoted by an × that is not italicized (note that this is a multiplication sign, not the letter x). It may be applied to plants that are the product of a cross between species of the same genus. If a hybrid results from the crossing of species from different genera, then the hybrid generic name is preceded by a multiplication sign. However, if a hybrid results from the grafting of species from different genera, it is indicated by an addition sign instead of a multiplication sign.\n\nSynonyms (for example, Plumbago indica, syn. P. rosea)\n\nWithin a classification a plant has only one correct name, but it may have several incorrect ones. These are known as synonyms (abbreviated as syn.) and may have arisen due to two or more botanists giving the same plant different names or from a plant being classified in different ways.\n\nCommon Names Where common names are used, they appear as lowercase roman type except where they derive from a proper name, such as that of a person or a place. (For example, soapwort but Carolina violet.) Note that the Latinized versions of proper names do not have capital letters, for example, forrestii or freemanii. Many Latin genus names are in ordinary use as common names, for example, fuchsia; in this context, they appear in lowercase roman type, and they can also be used in the plural (fuchsias, rhododendrons).\n\nPlumbago indica\n\n11\n\nWhy Botanical Latin Is Used for Plant Names John David, Head of Horticultural Taxonomy, Royal Horticultural Society (RHS)\n\nThe system of plant names we use today dates back to the plan first devised by the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus (Carl von Linné) in his Species Plantarum of 1753, but the names he used in many cases were far older. Linnaeus drew heavily on earlier works, particularly the many herbals published in the previous two centuries that, in turn, are ultimately derived from the De Materia Medica of Dioscorides (around ad 77). Although he mined these early sources for names, Linnaeus did not always choose to use the name for the same plant as it was originally intended. Linnaeus’s innovation, known as the binomial system, employed a unique combination of two words to refer to each plant and was developed as a kind of aide-memoire. By the Renaissance, plants had become known by long phrase names that could include more than twenty words, but usually between five and ten. These could be difficult to remember, so a shorthand of just two words was a godsend. Linnaeus’s system was quickly picked up by other botanists; one of the earliest works in Great Britain to fully adopt the system is the eighth edition of Miller’s Gardener’s Dictionary (1768). Linnaeus developed this system for animals too. The two elements of a Latin name are a combination of the name of a genus (plural genera) and the name of a species, such that closely related species share the same genus (generic) name. The genera were included by Linnaeus in classes, and this is where his so-called sexual system comes in. His classes were defined by the number and combination of male and female parts in the flower. An example being Hexandria Monogyna, for flowers with six stamens (male parts) and only one style (female part). This was more controversial than it might seem today, because Linnaeus described these combinations in terms of marriages. For a conservative and deeply religious society, the thought of six 12\n\nhusbands in bed with one wife—or in the case of Polyandria, twenty or more husbands in one marriage—was shocking. It was felt at the time that Linnaeus’s system was not something for polite conversation.\n\nabove : Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus, in the traditional dress of Lapland, is shown here carrying his favorite flower, Linnaea borealis.\n\nright : The system of classification created by Linnaeus emphasized the sexual anatomy of flowers.\n\n14\n\nAnother reason why Linnaeus’s system of naming plants was so important is that until the era of exploration of the Americas, Africa, and Asia, Europeans had needed names for only European plants, which numbered in the low thousands. By the early eighteenth century, however, plants were flowing in from all over the world and needed to be described and named quickly. With so many plants being discovered and described, and the establishment of a more sophisticated understanding of how they were related, came the need for more ranks in the classification, which were inserted between genus and class. These were the family (ending with -aceae) and order (ending with -ales) in the nineteenth century, with the class (-opsida) being redefined and the rank of phylum (-phyta) added above the class in the twentieth century. Like the genus and species names, these are all in Latin form, but are plural adjectives. In addition, there is provision for ranks in between: variety, tribe, section, series, and any number of sub- or super- ranks, as well as hybrids. Although this complex arrangement of ranks is important for botanists looking at the plant kingdom as a whole, it does not detract from the simplicity of Linnaeus’s binomial system for other users of plant names.\n\nThe adoption of Latin for naming and describing plants comes from the status of that language as the common language of learned discourse for centuries, letting students access the works of classical writers from ancient Greece and Rome. However, botanical Latin would hardly be recognized by a Roman, because it is an end point of the development, through medieval Church Latin, of a language that from the seventh century onward has not been anyone’s native tongue. The formal publication of a new plant required a description in Latin up until 2012, and even now it is still one of only two alternatives, the other being English. However, despite its advantage in removing almost all ambiguity, the technicalities of case, number, gender, tense, mood, and declension, grammatical features almost nonexistent in many of the world’s languages, meant that the use of Latin presented an almost insurmountable challenge for botanists around the globe. While it is no longer required for describing plants, it is retained for plant names, and an understanding of Latin is helpful for the creation of new names of plants, an appreciation of their meaning, and their pronunciation. left :\n\nThe binomial system of Linnaeus was timely, because it provided a system for naming the many plants found during the age of discovery.\n\nbelow : Plant hunter Frederick Burbidge (1847–1905) discovered several new species while collecting for the Veitch Nurseries in Asia.\n\n15\n\nA Brief History of Botanical Art Brent Elliott, Royal Horticultural Society Librarian (retired)\n\nBotanical art is art that serves the purposes of botanists, and throughout history it has usually facilitated the accurate identification of plants. To be worthwhile, illustrations need to be available in multiple copies; a picture that exists in a single copy may be an excellent portrait of a plant, but it can be of little use other than to local botanists. We know from Pliny the Elder, writing in the first century ad, that scholars had tried to produce illustrated books about plants; but the only way of distributing books then was to copy by hand, and illustrations copied by hand over and over again gradually ceased to resemble the originals sufficiently to be reliable identification guides. So the attempt to illustrate books on plants was abandoned, and scholars had to rely on written descriptions alone. The printing press changed all that. The first printed botanical books simply copied the poor schematic illustrations found in medieval manuscripts, but in 1530 Otto Brunfels published his Herbarum vivae eicones, with the first printed images of plants drawn from actual plant specimens, made by an artist named Hans Weiditz. This was followed in 1542 by the De historia stirpium commentarii insignes of Leonhart Fuchs, the first textbook on plants where both text and pictures were based on studying living specimens. Albrecht Meyer’s illustrations for Fuchs established the conventions of botanical art for the next century: plants were depicted at life size where possible; the complete plant was shown, including the root system; the plants were shown in outline, with little attempt at illustrating surface texture. Fuchs’s reasoning for the use of outlines was that readers might want to color the pictures. Amateur coloring remained a problem for generations. How could you ensure that people using the book in different places actually saw the same pictures if in some cases they had been colored, perhaps by\n\nleft :\n\nBotanical illustrations from the mid-1700s (here, Hura crepitans in Euphorbiaceae) show detailed dissections of the flowering parts.\n\nabove : Early botanical illustrations, such as this Capsicum annuum from Fuchs’s 1543 German edition, rely on outlines instead of texture.\n\n17\n\n18\n\nsomeone not familiar with the plants? In the late seventeenth century, artists for prestigious publications began to depict the surface texture of leaves and stems in as much detail as possible to deter people from coloring the illustrations. The first experiments in color printing took place in the eighteenth century, but it would not be until the midnineteenth century that satisfactory results were obtained. Most botanical illustration in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was made for herbals—books on the plants used in medicine. During the eighteenth century, the emphasis shifted to floras of particular parts of the world, and monographs on particular plant genera or families. In the 1730s, the botanist Carl Linnaeus popularized a system of classification based on the number and arrangement of the parts of the flower, and artists began to add detailed dissections of the flower to their works. These dissections came to be presented in rows, usually below the main figure. Leaf structure was considered subordinate, and an outline of the leaf was often shown as a background to the main image. Linnaeus’s sexual system of classification was superseded in the nineteenth century by systems that no longer focused exclusively on the flower, and artists returned to depicting all\n\nleft :\n\nThe illustrations to Philip Miller’s Gardeners Dictionary included this one by G. D. Ehret, showing Ricinus communis.\n\nabove : This picture of Hibiscus mutabilis from Rheede’s Hortus Malabaricus (1678-1703) shows how such illustrations spread knowledge of the world’s flora.\n\nparts of the plant. By this time, they had a new tool to help them: the microscope. The first plant drawings to be created with the assistance of a microscope had been made as long ago as the 1620s, but these were not published at the time, and the power of the microscope as an aid to botany was widely recognized only in the 1830s, with the publication of Franz Bauer’s drawings of orchid anatomy. A new type of botanical illustration appeared, one that used anatomical details to compare different species in the same genus or family. In the twentieth century, despite the increasing use of photography to portray plants, botanical works continued to use artists’ drawings. It would take several photographs to provide all the information that can be conveyed in a single good drawing. This situation may be changing in the twentyfirst century, with the advent of digital photography and the use of computer software to assemble multiple photographs into a single image. The coming decades promise to be an exceedingly interesting period in the history of botanical art. 19\n\nHow the Study of DNA Is Changing Plant Names Alastair Culham, Curator of the University of Reading Herbarium\n\nAs both a botanist and a gardener, I often have to justify my use of two languages that are not natively spoken today: Latin, the international language of scientific communication for many centuries, which forms the basis for plant names, and the language of DNA sequences, the code that tells most living organisms what they are, how they should interact with the environment, and even when to die. Latin causes people to ask me why plant names are so difficult and DNA data evokes questions about why plant names change so often. DNA structure has been understood since the 1950s, but only since the 1990s has it been possible to read long stretches of DNA in a fairly cheap and efficient way. DNA provides a complex and highly detailed story of how things are related to each other, written by DNA from parents combining in offspring and the accumulation and stabilization of chance mutations in the DNA bases. Plants have a particularly complex pattern of inheritance of DNA. Most DNA is in the cell nucleus, arranged in chromosomes and inherited 50/50 from each parent. However, there are two much smaller sets of DNA: one is in the mitochondrion, which provides energy for cell functions; the other, unique to plants, is in the plastid (including chloroplasts) with genes linked to photosynthesis and other functions. Both mitochondrial and plastid DNA are usually inherited from only the female (seed) parent. The result is that a plant cell has DNA with a mix of different histories, therefore different parts of DNA can tell different stories about how plants are related. To get from DNA to a theory of how species are related to each other, to form genera, families, and orders, involves the comparison of DNA sequences through alignment and analysis of the changes in the DNA between samples. This is called phylogenetic analysis, which is about building a theory 20\n\nabove : The acornlike structures on Fucus vesciculosus (right) once led to its inclusion in the oak genus Quercus, along with Quercus robur (left).\n\nof what is related to what through reconstruction of changes in DNA sequence over time. The resulting tree of relationships, the phylogeny, is hierarchical and the tips are generally species. These in turn form larger groups, genera, and these yet larger families and so on. There are many hidden levels of complexity. It is not easy to align one strand of DNA against another, because they can change in the DNA sequence and can both extend and contract in length. Over millions of years, DNA strands can become so different it is almost impossible to tell which part from one species is derived from which part of another. As plants become more closely related, the differences become smaller and alignment is easier. This goes on until the DNA sequences are effectively the same, at which point species cannot be told apart. Until about 2015, it was expensive to read large portions of DNA in a single plant (it took ten years to read 90 percent of the smallest plant genome), but new\n\nleft :\n\nPlant classifications based on flowers or fruits alone can be misleading; DNA provides more accurate classification, because the unique genetic code of individual can be compared.\n\ntechnology has made reading a whole genome more cost effective. Now it is possible to uniquely identify most individuals based on DNA sequence. The phylogenies constructed for plants were originally based on one gene, and gradually more genes have been added. However, the easy sources of data have been only the chloroplast DNA and the DNA that codes for ribosomes (protein manufactures). When these limited data sets were analyzed and used to build phylogenetic trees, some startling new relationships among plants were found, resulting in many changes of plant names. Sin more DNA data have been read, some of those early ideas of relationship have been replaced with newer, more robust ideas, leading to additional name changes. Most botanists try to make sure that plant names are informative of the relationships among those plants. This has big practical advantages; for instance, most gardeners would\n\nknow that plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae, will probably be aromatic, or that Capsicum species will have spicy hot fruit. My favorite way to illustrate how name changes have helped us understand what we see is to look in a botany book by Clusius, published in 1601. He included bladderwrack (the black rockweed seaweed) in his genus Quercus (the oak) due to the common presence of acornlike structures. Imagine the disappointment if you bought a Quercus from a catalog and got brown seaweed. DNA data helps improve the way classification reflects relationships among plants. Try to think of every name change as an improved model instead of a nuisance.\n\n21\n\nPractical Uses of Botanical Latin James Armitage, Editor of The Plantsman\n\nMany gardeners will have thought at some point that Latin names just get in the way. Even an eager plant enthusiast will be familiar with the experience of trying to recall some impossibly antediluvian epithet, clutching his or her forehead and muttering feebly, “I know it begins with a D…” Common names are so charming and memorable—foxglove, Jack-inthe-pulpit, dove tree—why not just use these? There are several excellent reasons why we need a fixed scientific set of names constructed from a dead language. One great advantage of Latin is its universality. No nation can claim it as its mother tongue, so it is at once everyone’s and no one’s, neither advantaging nor disadvantaging any one user. In the vast, shifting diversity of language and script found across the globe, Latin stands as a constant, unchanging point, so a plant name is the same in New Zealand as it is in Korea, Sweden, Morocco, Brazil, or Canada. Latin names are also predictive in a way common names tend not to be. There is nothing in the colloquialisms skunkbush and staghorn sumach to suggest any particular relationship or similarity. However, once you know that they both refer to species of the genus Rhus, you are able to predict that each plant will probably have pinnate leaves and good autumnal color. Aside from other considerations, an important justification for the use of Latin names is that they have so much to tell us that is of practical value. Color, form, size, ethnobotany, habitat, geography, history—all these things and many more are referred to in the names of plants, and all impart practical information that helps to make us better gardeners. It is always helpful to gain some idea of a plant’s appearance from a mere glance at its name. Those developing 22\n\na color palette in blue and white, for instance, might want to keep an eye open for plants bearing the epithets cyanus and caeruleus (blue) or albus and lacteus (white). More fiery colors are represented by aurantiacum (orange), coccineus (scarlet), and ruber (red), among many others. It is not just characteristics as obvious as color that are indicated in plant names. Epithets with the suffix -folius refer to details of the leaves. So we have angustifolius (narrow leaves), brevifolius (short leaves), and grandifolius (big leaves). Stature might be indicated in names such as grandis (big), minima (smallest), and nana (dwarf ), and growth habit in names such as fastigiata (erect, upright branches), pendula (hanging), and scandens (climbing). For plants that satisfy with their aroma, the epithet odorata (with a fragrant scent) might be considered, while the name foetida (with a bad smell) forewarns of a less agreeable experience. Once acquaintance is made with the richness and diverse derivation of botanical Latin, scientific names can become every bit as romantic, evocative, and charming as common names—and nearly as easy to remember.\n\nright : Although exhibiting many different colors, Digitalis flowers are usually tubular, much like the thimble from which their Latin name derives.\n\n23\n\na-\n\nUsed in compound words to denote without or contrary to\n\nabbreviatus ab-bree-vee-AH-tus\n\nabbreviata, abbreviatum\n\nShortened; abbreviated, as in Buddleja abbreviata\n\nAbelia uh-BEE-lee-uh\n\nNamed after Clarke Abel (1780–1826), British surgeon and naturalist (Caprifoliaceae)\n\nAbeliophyllum uh-BEE-lee-oh-fil-um\n\nLeaves resembling Abelia, from Greek phyllon, meaning “leaf ” (Oleaceae)\n\nA\n\nAcacia [1]\n\nacanthifolius\n\nuh-KAY-sha\n\nuh-kan-thi-FOH-lee-us\n\nFrom Greek akantha, meaning “thorn.” Many species bear prominent spines (Fabaceae)\n\nacanthifolia, acanthifolium\n\nWith leaves like Acanthus, as in Carlina acanthifolia\n\nC\n\nAcaena\n\nAcantholimon\n\nuh-SEE-nuh\n\nuh-KAN-tho-lim-on\n\nD\n\nFrom Greek akantha, meaning “thorn,” because the fruit is spiny (Rosaceae)\n\nFrom Greek akantha, meaning “thorn,” and Limonium, a related genus (Plumbaginaceae)\n\nE\n\nAcalypha\n\nAcanthostachys\n\nF\n\nuh-KA-lee-fuh\n\nuh-KAN-tho-stak-is\n\nFrom Greek akaluphe, meaning “nettle,” to which some species resemble (Euphorbiaceae)\n\nFrom Greek akantha, meaning “thorn,” and stachys, an “ear of grain,” because the inflorescences are spiny and similar in shape to a cereal seed head (Bromeliaceae)\n\nacanth-\n\nB\n\nG H I\n\nUsed in compound words to denote spiny, spiky, or thorny properties\n\nJ\n\nAbies (also abies) A-bees\n\nK\n\nFrom Latin name for fir tree, published by Pliny the Elder in ad 77 (Pinaceae)\n\nL\n\n—\n\nabietinus\n\nM\n\nay-bee-TEE-nus\n\nabietina, abietinum\n\nN\n\nLike fir tree (Abies), as in Campanula patula subsp. abietina\n\nO\n\nabortivus a-bor-TEE-vus\n\nP\n\nabortiva, abortivum\n\nIncomplete; with parts missing, as in Oncidium abortivum\n\nQ\n\nabrotanifolius\n\nR\n\nab-ro-tan-ih-FOH-lee-us\n\nabrotanifolia, abrotanifolium\n\nS\n\nWith leaves like southernwood (Artemisia abrotanum), as in Euryops abrotanifolius\n\nT\n\nAbutilon\n\nU\n\nuh-BEW-ti-lon\n\nFrom Latin, derived from Arabic (abu-tilun) for Indian mallow (Malvaceae)\n\nAcacia acinacea\n\nV\n\nabyssinicus\n\nW\n\na-biss-IN-ih-kus\n\nabyssinica, abyssinicum\n\nX\n\nConnected with Abyssinia (Ethiopia), as in Aponogeton abyssinicus\n\nY Z 1\n\ni 25\n\nAcanthus\n\nacerifolius\n\nAchimenes\n\nuh-KAN-thus\n\na-ser-ih-FOH-lee-us\n\nuh-KIM-en-eez\n\nFrom Greek akantha, meaning “thorn,” because floral bracts and leaves may be spiny (Acanthaceae)\n\nacerifolia, acerifolium\n\nWith leaves like maple (Acer), as in Quercus acerifolia\n\nacaulis\n\nacerosus\n\nFrom Greek cheimanos, meaning “tender,” because plants are not frost hardy, or from Achaemenes, the Greek mythical ancestor of a Persian royal house (Gesneriaceae)\n\na-KAW-lis\n\na-seh-ROH-sus\n\nAchlys\n\nacaulis, acaule\n\nacerosa, acerosum\n\nAK-liss\n\nShort-stemmed: without a stem, as in Gentiana acaulis\n\nAcca\n\nacetosella a-kee-TOE-sell-uh\n\nAK-uh\n\nFrom the Peruvian indigenous name aca, as in A. macrostemma (Myrtaceae)\n\n-aceae Acer AY-sa\n\nFrom the Latin name for maple tree, derived from the Latin for sharp or pointed, because maple wood was used in manufacturing spears (Sapindaceae)\n\nNamed after the Greek goddess of mist and darkness, because plants grow in shade (Berberidaceae)\n\nWith slightly sour leaves, as in Oxalis acetosella\n\nacicularis\n\nAchillea\n\nShaped like a needle, as in Rosa acicularis\n\nuh-KEY-lee-ah\n\nDenoting the rank of family\n\nG E N U S\n\nLike a needle, as in Melaleuca acerosa\n\nass-ik-yew-LAH-ris\n\nacicularis, aciculare\n\nNamed after the Greek warrior Achilles, who used the plant to heal wounds (Asteraceae)\n\nacinaceus\n\nachilleifolius\n\nIn the shape of a curved sword or scimitar, as in Acacia acinacea\n\nah-key-lee-FOH-lee-us\n\nachilleifolia, achilleifolium\n\na-sin-AY-see-us\n\nacinacea, acinaceum\n\nWith leaves like common yarrow (Achillea millefolium), as in Tanacetum achilleifolium\n\nS P O T L I G H T\n\nAcanthus The Greek word akantha, meaning “thorn” or “thorny,” is a common component of plant Latin names, as in Acanthostachys or Pyracantha, warning that the plant may be spiny to touch.

after someone. But with so many names already in use, it can be hard to come up with something new. A novel approach is to create an anagram of an existing genus, as in Tellima (from Mitella), Docynia (from Cydonia), Leymus (from Elymus), and Saruma (from Asarum). Using similar names not only makes them easier to remember, but also helps to reinforce the familial relationship between the pair.\n\nL M N O P Q R S T U V W\n\nalternifolius\n\nX\n\nal-tern-ee-FOH-lee-us\n\nalternifolia, alternifolium\n\nY\n\nWith leaves that grow from alternating points of a stem instead of opposite each other, as in Buddleja alternifolia\n\nZ i 37\n\nAlyogyne\n\nAmaranthus\n\namazonicus\n\nal-ee-oh-GY-nee\n\nam-uh-RANTH-us\n\nam-uh-ZOH-nih-kus\n\nFrom Greek alytos, meaning “undivided,” and gyne, meaning “female,” because the styles are undivided (Malvaceae)\n\nFrom Greek amarantos, meaning “unfading,” because the flowers are long-lasting (Amaranthaceae)\n\namazonica, amazonicum\n\nAlyssum\n\namarellus\n\nambi-\n\nA-liss-um\n\na-mar-ELL-us\n\nFrom Greek a, meaning “without,” and lyssa, meaning “rabies” or “madness,” a medicinal herb (Brassicaceae)\n\namarella, amarellum\n\namarus a-MAH-rus\n\namabilis am-AH-bih-lis\n\namabilis, amabile\n\nLovely, as in Cynoglossum amabile\n\namanus a-MAH-nus\n\namana, amanum\n\nOf the Amanus Mountains, Turkey, as in Origanum amanum\n\namaranthoides am-ar-anth-OY-deez\n\nResembling amaranth (Amaranthus), as in Calomeria amaranthoides\n\nG E N U S\n\n—\n\nConnected with the Amazon River, South America, as in Victoria amazonica Used in compound words to denote around\n\nambiguus am-big-YOO-us\n\nambigua, ambiguum\n\namara, amarum\n\nBitter, as in Ribes amarum\n\nUncertain or doubtful, as in Digitalis ambigua\n\namaricaulis\n\namblyanthus\n\nam-ar-ee-KAW-lis\n\nam-blee-AN-thus\n\namaricaulis, amaricaule\n\namblyantha, amblyanthum\n\nAmaryllis\n\nAmbrosia\n\nam-uh-RIL-us\n\nam-BRO-zee-uh\n\nFrom Greek amarysso, meaning “to sparkle,” the name of a shepherdess in Virgil’s Eclogues (Amaryllidaceae)\n\nFrom Greek ambrosia, meaning “food of the gods,” although the allusion to this often weedy genus is unclear (Asteraceae)\n\nWith a bitter-tasting stem, as in Hyophorbe amaricaulis\n\nWith a blunt flower, as in Indigofera amblyantha\n\nS P O T L I G H T\n\nAlyssum For many gardeners, alyssum is a whiteflowered bedding plant, often grown together with blue lobelia in containers and park bedding displays.

In particular, they are said to fend off rabies, the Latin name Alyssum means “without madness.” Another popular alyssum is no longer in Alyssum (A. saxatile =Aurinia saxatilis), but several species remain and they are often useful for growing in rock or crevice gardens.\n\nAurinia (formerly Alyssum) saxatilis 38\n\nambrosioides\n\nA\n\n1\n\nam-bro-zhee-OY-deez\n\nB\n\nResembling Ambrosia, as in Cephalaria ambrosioides\n\nC\n\nAmelanchier am-uh-LANG-kee-uh\n\nD\n\nFrom Provençal (France) amalenquièr, the vernacular name for A. ovalis (Rosaceae)\n\nE\n\namelloides am-el-OY-deez\n\nF\n\nResembling Aster amellus (from its Roman name), as in Felicia amelloides\n\nG\n\namericanus\n\nH\n\na-mer-ih-KAH-nus\n\namericana, americanum\n\nI\n\nConnected with North or South America, as in Lysichiton americanus\n\nJ\n\namesianus K\n\name-see-AH-nus\n\namesiana, amesianum\n\nNamed after Frederick Lothrop Ames (1835–93), horticulturist and orchid grower, and Oakes Ames (1874–1950), supervisor of the Arnold Arboretum and professor of botany, Harvard, Massachusetts, as in Cirrhopetalum amesianum\n\nL M N Amherstia nobilis\n\namethystinus am-eth-ih-STEE-nus\n\namethystina, amethystinum\n\nViolet, as in Brimeura amethystina\n\nAmherstia [1] am-HURR-stee-ah\n\nNamed after Sarah, Countess Amherst (1762–1838), British naturalist and botanist (Fabaceae)\n\nAmicia am-ISS-ee-uh\n\nNamed after Giovanni Battista Amici (1786–1863), Italian astronomer and botanist (Fabaceae)\n\nAmmi AM-ee\n\nAncient name for a related plant, possibly derived from Greek ammos, meaning “sand,” an allusion to habitat (Apiaceae)\n\nAmmobium am-MOW-bee-um\n\nFrom Greek ammo, meaning “sand,” and bio, meaning “to live”;

Botanical Latin names also follow this pattern; masculine genera often end in -us, for example, Acorus; feminine genera typically end in -a, for example, Hosta; while neuter genera often end in -um, for example, Delphinium. The species name that follows must agree in gender, so Acorus gramineus, Hosta lancifolia, and Delphinium elatum. A major exception is trees, many of which have masculine genera (Pinus, Quercus, Malus, Prunus), but are treated as feminine (Pinus nigra, Quercus alba), a quirk of history, because fruit-bearing trees were considered feminine by the Romans.\n\nK L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\n—\n\ni 47\n\nargophyllus\n\nargyrophyllus\n\nar-go-FIL-us\n\nar-ger-o-FIL-us\n\nargophylla,
