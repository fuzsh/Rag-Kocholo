DeLaMare Company, Inc., New York, N.Y. 2 Letter from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden An African-violet leaf in a glass of water in the kitchen window must be a part of everyone’s memories. This is a form of propagation with which we are all familiar, and an art that goes back for centuries. To quote George S. Avery in BBG’s first Handbook on Propagation in 1957, “the rooting of cuttings, grafting and budding are all recorded in Pliny the Second’s Natural History, written in the First Century a.d. Along with well verified facts Pliny mixed spurious statements, yet his Natural History deserves passing notice in this 20th century.” Guest Editor Alan D. Cook has gathered a star-studded cast of contributors for this entirely new handbook. Although many of the techniques are ancient, new methods such as micropropagation, more familiar as tissue culture, are now within reach of the home gardener. “The original propagation device is our planet Earth. . . .Unfortunately, using earth alone, the propagator has no control over meteorological caprices that submit seeds and cuttings to excessive heat/cold and wetness/dryness,” says A1 Cook in the introduction to propagation devices. He, with his guest contributors, takes you step-by-step through all of the methods of replicating plants and controlling the environment. Experiment with the various well-tried propagation techniques. You’ll find them enjoyable and rewarding, both personally and in the numbers of new plants you make from the originals. We thank A1 for his thoroughness, and most of all for the wit and charm with which he imparts information. May your gardening year be a good one. Editor 3 From Glass of Water to Greenhouse . . . PROPAGATION DEVICES Alan D. Cook The original propagation device is our planet Earth. Soil, particularly well-drained soil of good texture, with small spaces to hold water and slightly larger spaces to hold air, is an inexpensive and readily-available medium in which we plant seeds, entice lay¬ ers to root, and stick cuttings (especially hardwood cuttings). Unfortunately, using Earth alone, the propagator has no control over meteorological caprices that submit seeds and cuttings to excessive heat/cold and wetness/dryness. 4 A plastic tent unit, a flat with appro¬ priate medium, a wire framework to hold polyethylene plastic horizontally above the cuttings. Plastic, tucked securely under the flat, often need not be disturbed until cuttings root. The unit shown on opposite page, in a sunny greenhouse, has cheesecloth under plas¬ tic for partial shade. In lower-light areas the cheesecloth is omitted. Small-Scale Devices Many herbaceous and some woody plants (English ivy, willow) will root in water. Whose grandmother did not tie waxed pa¬ per or plastic over the mouth of a glass of water and stick stems of Joseph’s coat or leaf petioles of African violet through holes in the cover? And some people think an avocado seed can germinate only if tooth¬ pick-suspended with round end down in a glass of water. Efficacy of a glass of water is limited to propagation of relatively few plants because water doesn’t contain much oxygen (essen¬ tial to cell growth). So an early propagator put some soil in a pot or box (flat) for better control of seeds and cuttings. Sand mixed with leafmold was good, pure sand better, and sandy soil worked best. . .and now we have almost as many rooting/seeding media as there are propagators. Peat, perlite, vermiculite, shredded styrofoam, sphag¬ num moss, cinders, sawdust — the old prop¬ agation flat can’t hold them all. Humidity For humidity control, glass jars upturned over earth-planted seeds and cuttings or glass panes over seed flats led the way to a gaggle of plastic gimmicks. A simple device for a few seeds and one or a very few cuttings is a plastic cup with a drainage hole punched in the bottom, with clean medium soaked and drained, in a small plastic bag tied at the top to form a small watertight cell. An easily assembled cold frame kit. Heating cable or mat turns it into a hotbed. The inset shows an automatic ventilating device. 5 W. A tlee Burpee Co. Since water from the medium (and the cuttings) can condense on the plastic and run down the sides, some operators put the medium in the bag and put the bag in a pot (for stability), thus allowing condensation water to reenter the medium. Clear plastic refrigerator dishes and boxes are also con¬ venient rooting and seeding chambers. About 1950, Lewis Lipp (Guest Editor of the first BBG Handbook on Propagation) began to use plastic tents over single flats and then bigger plastic tents over several flats. (Pots will do as well as flats.) Con¬ struct a framework of wood or heavy wire (bent coat hangers will work for small units) to hold clear polyethylene film above the flats. The top of the structure should be flat rather than rounded so condensation will drip back down onto the surface area rather than running down the sides. Plant seeds or cuttings in properly moistened medium in the containers and gently water. Place plastic over the framework and tuck be¬ neath the edges of the flats. Further water¬ ing may not be necessary for several weeks. Flats, medium and cuttings must all be as clean as possible to reduce chances of fungal diseases. A problem with plastic tent units is main¬ taining an appropriate relationship between light and humidity. Indoors, humidity levels are easily kept high, but even with supple¬ mental light it is not easy to obtain opti¬ mum illumination. Outdoors, light is no problem but sunlight increases temperature inside the tent, lowering humidity. Thus, shading of some sort, by placement of the unit in a shady place or by introducing a sun shield, is in order and we’re back to in¬ sufficient illumination. The larger the enclosure of a plastic struc¬ ture, the greater the light-humidity prob¬ lem. So small systems, as a plastic cup over a pot, or a pot within a one-quart freezer bag, are often more successful, but obvi¬ ously less productive. Light For indoor plastic tents, smaller units can be placed in a sunny window as close to the glass as possible. Curtains or even window screens can reduce light intensity drastically. East windows are the best choices; shading may be necessary in south or west windows on sunny days. Artificial lighting is never as bright as humans think, but plants aren’t fooled. A good system is to provide as many fluores- A compact electrically heated indoor greenhouse. 6 W. Atlee Burpee Co. A lean-to home greenhouse can be independently heated or use heat from the house.

There should be an outside door as well as one into the house, and the south or southeast side of the house offers the best location. cent lamps as space will allow, alternating ordinary tubes of cool white and warm white in equal quantities. Place lights 8 to 12 inches above the seeds or cuttings. Some growers use continuous illumination, others prefer 16-hour periods of light. On a large scale, growers incorporate fog or mist into the structure, or simply use mist out-of-doors with wind baffles on the sides of the propagating area. Fogging machines are used by some commercial operators, but misting systems are available for the amateur as well (see pp. 45 and 76). Small-Scale Structures A number of commercial seed kits, minia¬ ture greenhouses, and other small indoor and/or outdoor propagation aids, with in¬ structions, are on the market, both in local garden stores and from various mail order firms (see p. 76). Long before the plastic tent, propagators used boxes with hinged or removable glass sashes for lids. Outdoors, these are called cold frames. If given heat (by fermenting organic matter such as manure beneath the propagating medium as in the old days, or by electric cables or mats in the present) they become hotbeds. The light-humidity problems of plastic tents apply to cold frames and hotbeds. Cold frames and hotbeds may be pur¬ chased from various commercial firms (see p. 76), or can be homemade. Preservative- treated wood is more durable than un¬ treated. You can purchase Cuprinol and treat lumber yourself. Don’t use creosote or pentachlorophenol — they’re toxic to plants. A number of propagation books and pamphlets give directions for cold frame and hotbed construction; see p. 72 and/or check local libraries, nurseries, and by all means your County Cooperative Extension Agent for information. If you install elec¬ tric cables or mats for bottom heat, be sure the wiring conforms with local building codes. Greenhouses are the most sophisticated propagating structures, also the most ex¬ pensive and demanding of attention. (Some states allow state tax credits for attached solar greenhouses.) Greenhouse and green¬ house equipment suppliers and how-to books are listed on p. 76. & 1 Lord & Burnham It makes a difference . . . Propagating Media A propagating medium must 1) hold seeds and cuttings in place during germination or rooting, 2) have small spaces (micropores) to hold water against the pull of gravity, and 3) have larger spaces (macropores) to hold air after excess water drains away. In addition, an ideal medium should be clean, free of disease organisms and weed seeds, readily available, and lightweight for easy handling. If it meets all the above and is also inexpensive, it is an ideal material. Soil and Sand Soil is inexpensive and readily available but is not always properly porous and is never clean. Bank sand and beach sand, if copiously rinsed to remove clay and salt, are usually of decent porosity but are not clean. Various chemical and physical sterilization and pasteurization processes are used by commercial propagators. A simple method for the amateur is baking moist material (sand or soil) in a conventional or microwave oven. Put medium three inches deep in a pan, enclose in a tough plastic poultry-baking bag (to contain odors) at a temperature and time combination sufficient to thoroughly bake a large potato. Builder’s sand, especially #7 silica sand, is a good medium and is usually clean enough to use as is. It’s cheap and usually easy to obtain, but heavy. Peat Moss, Sphagnum and Others Other popular media are vermiculite, perlite, ground styrofoam, peat moss, and sphagnum moss. Peat moss, the coarse, brown good stuff that comes compressed into bales, is popularly used either alone or in mixtures for rooting broadleaf evergreen cuttings, especially those of the family Ericaceae (rhododendrons, azaleas, blueberries, pieris, heather, among others). Sphagnum moss, milled or screened (rubbed through !/4-inch hardware cloth), is ideal as a seeding medium. It holds immense amounts of water without excluding air, is incredibly light, and has a built-in antidamping-off mechanism (which is lost if sterilized). Even if you don’t use sphagnum moss for a seeding submedium, at least consider sprinkling a thin layer atop the seeds. All of those materials and others are employed, singly and in an infinite array of mix¬ tures, by propagators around the world. Some use different media for different plants. Enterprising horticultural suppliers offer cubes, pellets, trays and other ready-to-plant propagation aids for both seeds and cuttings. They fill all the criteria for good media, but do cost more. And somehow they take a bit of fun out of propagating for some of us. In the end, whatever medium works for you is the one to use.*?* The Forsyth Pot The Forsyth rooting pot was popular in pre-plastic days. A small clay pot with drainage hole corked or puttied was placed inside a larger pot (with conventional drainage). Rooting medium filled the larger pot while the smaller was kept full of water. Cuttings stuck in the damp medium received a steady supply of water as it seeped through the porous clay of the small pot.*?* 8 '<. Kling RAISING ANNUAL AND PERENNIAL PLANTS FROM SEED The easiest, cheapest, most common method of producing vegetables and annual and perennial flowering plants. Frances M. Miner Growing plants from seed is the most uni¬ versal method of propagation. All gardeners at one time or another grow some of their plants in this way, though the techniques employed often are hit or miss — as are the results. By following a few common-sense procedures, most gardeners can increase the numbers of kinds of plants they can raise from seed, and greatly improve their chances of success. own plants is hardly worth the trouble. The great majority of our present-day vegeta¬ bles, annuals and perennials are hybrids of mixed ancestry that will not come true from seed collected in the home garden. Results with such seed will be very disappointing. Seeds purchased from seedsmen are grown Pricking out seedlings from can to greenhouse flat. (These seedlings could well have been pricked out at an earlier stage.) Saving Seed For most gardeners, saving seeds from their 9 Roche by special techniques to ensure that they will produce the kinds of plants desired. However, if one is certain that some of the home garden plants are pure species, or pure lines which will come true, it is possi¬ ble to save home-grown seed, or seeds of many species that grow in the wild. The seed should be collected as soon as ripe, then cleaned and stored in containers in a cool dry place until ready for planting. Seeds purchased from reputable seeds¬ men are much more satisfactory, and, ex¬ cept for rare or new varieties, are very reasonable in price. Leftover or home-collected seeds can be air-dried for a few days, then stored in air¬ tight jars or plastic bags in the refrigerator often for a year or two, sometimes more. When to Plant Indoors The urge to get something planted reaches a seasonal high in mid-winter, around Janu¬ ary, spurred on by the arrival of new seed catalogs and articles on planting in garden magazines. As a result, many gardeners start seeds indoors too early. In warmer climates, where spring arrives early, seeds can be started at this time, but in temperate climates, as in the latitude of New York City, March is soon enough to plant in¬ doors. Plants will then be ready for setting out-of-doors by the middle of May or a lit¬ tle later. Very small seeds, or those of plants re¬ quiring a long growing season are the ones best suited to starting indoors. Seeds of fast-growing plants can be started out-of- doors when the soil is ready for planting and danger of frost is past. Seed packet directions give before-frost times for planting indoors. Check with local cooperative extension agents or seasoned gardeners, and lean toward the safer dates. Or gamble with earlier times, but be pre¬ pared to pay the price of losing. Containers and Soil Almost any kind of container that provides adequate drainage can be used. Greenhouse flats, flower pots or cans with holes punched in the bottom are all good. Containers should be at least three inches deep, other¬ wise they may dry out too fast. Seeds are planted in such containers with the under¬ standing that they are to be transplanted once, while very small, to other containers in which they will grow to a size suitable for final transplanting to the garden. Over the holes in the bottoms of the con¬ tainers are placed pieces of broken clay pots, gravel or other coarse material (a wad of old pantyhose material is ideal) to ensure drainage. The container is then filled to about a half-inch from the top with any good, light, friable soil. If available soil is rather heavy, it can be lightened by mixing in some sand or finely ground peat moss. A common mixture that has been found satis¬ factory consists of one part each of sand, garden soil and leafmold or peat moss. Since garden soil is never “clean,” see p. 8 for substitutes and sterilization recommen¬ dations. Milled sphagnum moss is terrific for holding water and air and reducing chances of fungal diseases. Planting Make a strong effort to sow seeds thinly. An all-to-common error is planting too many per unit of surface. Even in rather small containers, such as four-inch pots, it is best to plant the seeds in rows, as this makes for easier handling when pricking out. As shown in the diagram, six short rows of seeds can be sown in one 6-inch bulb pan (shallow flower pot). All plantings should be labeled; it is easy to forget, and often hard to recognize small seedlings. The best way to judge depth of planting is to take a good look at the seed and plant it about two times its diameter. For small seeds this means a very thin covering of soil indeed, or no covering at all for tiny seeds such as petunia. To guard against pre¬ emergence damping-off, a condition in which fungi kill seeds before or soon after they break through the soil, the seeds and/or medium may be treated with com¬ mercial chemicals, if one cares to use them (ask your garden supply dealer or county cooperative office for currently approved products). Remember sphagnum moss for planting seeds onto and covering them with. Another way to lessen the threat of damping-off is to provide good air circula¬ tion and plenty of light. Watering Watering is one of the chief reasons for suc¬ cess or failure with seedlings. The soil should 10 Watering from below by setting pots in pan of water. be moist but not wet at the time the seeds are planted, and it should be kept as close to this state as possible at all times from planting on. Small seedlings dry out very quickly — and once is often fatal. On the other hand, roots must have air as well as water, and if the soil is kept soaked for very long, the plants literally drown. There is no set rule as to times for watering — the condi¬ tion of the soil determines whether to water or not. On bright warm days plantings may have to be watered two or three times, on dark damp days not at all. As soon as the first seedlings appear in a pot it should be set where it will get bright light from fluorescent tubes a few inches above the plants or from sunshine. This is a point overlooked by many gardeners but it is necessary to ensure the growth of good sturdy seedlings. If it is not done, the seed¬ lings grow long and spindly, a state of af¬ fairs almost every gardener has encoun¬ tered. Of course, extra care must be taken to see that the seedlings do not get too dry. Pricking Out, the First Transplanting Most seedlings when first up show two small “seed leaves.” These are followed in due time by the first true leaves, which are characteristic of the plant. When these first true leaves are visible is the best time for pricking out. This transplanting operation checks the growth of the seedlings tempo¬ rarily, making them grow into more com¬ pact plants. The seedlings are lifted, one or a very few at a time, from the starting con¬ tainers with a pencil or small flat stick (a pot label is good) and planted one-by-one in larger containers. To handle without dam¬ aging, the tiny plants should be held by a leaf (not the stem) between thumb and fore¬ finger. Holes of appropriate depth and about two inches apart (more for fast grow¬ ing plants such as tomatoes, marigolds, etc.) are made in the soil of the new con¬ tainers and the seedlings inserted. Roots should not be exposed to the air any longer than is absolutely necessary. After the seed¬ ling is inserted in a hole, the soil should be gently firmed about the roots, leaving the surface soil loose. Individual pots (paper, peat, clay, etc.) may be used instead of multiple-plant containers. Seedlings are of two types — those form- 11 Buhle The first leaves which appear on many seedlings are the so-called seed leaves (cotyledons) which often bear no resemblance to the later leaves. When the first true leaves, which are more or less typical of the later leaves, appear the seedlings can be pricked out. ing a rosette, with the growing point at the base of the cluster of leaves, and those with an upright stem having the growing point at the tip (see illustration). The first must be planted out exactly the same depth they were growing in the starting containers. If they are planted deeper than this, the grow¬ ing points are buried and the seedlings may die. The other type may be planted out to the first leaves; the growing points are at the tops of the stem and will not be buried. When the time for final transplanting to The growing points of some seedlings, such as tomato and clarkia (left), are at the tips of the upright stems. When pricked out, such seedlings can be planted deeper than they were originally growing; additional roots will come out along the stem wherever it is under the soil. Growing points of other seedlings, such as columbine and petunia (right), are at the centers of rosettes of leaves, at the soil line. Such seedlings must be replanted to the same depth as they were originally growing so as not to bury the growing plant. 12 Drawings by Peter K. Nelson the garden has arrived, the medium in which the seedlings are growing can be cut like a cake, with a block of soil around each plant, and the plants lifted and set in their permanent places. If plastic, paper or clay pots are used, they must be removed, and root balls should be gently disturbed by squeezing or teasing roots to encourage new roots to grow into the new soil environment. Peat pots should be torn off below the pots’ soil surface and squeezed but preferably removed. Hints on Planting Out-of-Doors Seeds to be planted directly in the garden can be put in rows and then thinned out, but a more economical method is to plant two or three seeds at each point along the row where a plant is wanted. When the seedlings are up the extra plants can be pulled out or cut off, leaving the sturdiest. Depth of planting again is the most impor¬ tant point in oudoor seed sowing. Fine seeds are sprinkled on the surface and raked; slightly larger ones are covered by a quarter-inch of fine soil; and those the size of radish or zinnia can sprout through an inch of cover. Outdoor germination can be hastened by hotcaps, cloches, and other homemade or commercial covers. A shingle or board over seeds (except those that need light) is good, but one must check daily for the first signs of sprouting. Then the board should be propped up on one side for a day, then removed. <3* When seedlings which have been pricked out into Oats are ready for transplanting to garden, the soil in the flat can be cut like a cake, and each plant removed with a block of soil around its roots. Many types of peat pots, cubes, bands, and other devices on the market can be used, thus eliminating this step. 13 GROWING TREES AND SHRUBS FROM SEED Lewis F. Lipp Trees and shrubs can be propagated in various ways. Nature’s methods of per¬ petuating a species are through seeds and layering. The remaining artificial methods are the use of cuttings, grafting and bud¬ grafting. Hybrids rarely if ever come true from seed, and for this reason are propa¬ gated vegetatively. Also, trees and shrubs reach flowering size sooner when propa¬ gated vegetatively than when grown from seed. Trees, when raised from seed, are in most cases healthier and apt to live longer than plants grown from grafts. Seedlings of a given species are not identical; sometimes they will exhibit considerable variation in size, vigor, hardiness and other characteris¬ tics. Sometimes a truly superior plant will turn up. Before discussing the various kinds of seed and their treatments, I wish to point out that, to promote favorable growth of the seedlings, the original environment of the parent plant should be recreated as closely as possible. Following is a classification of seeds and brief directions on handling each type. Fleshy Seeds Fleshy seeds, such as oak ( Quercus ), chest¬ nut ( Castanea ) and horse-chestnut and buckeye ( Aesculus ) usually break dormancy rapidly and should be sown soon after harvesting. If this is impractical, mix seeds with moist sand and store out-of-doors in a container over the winter months; in early spring plant in drills (literally a hole drilled in the soil). There are exceptions, as in the case of white oak, which should be sown immediately; the acorns germinate shortly after harvesting. Hard-Coated Seeds Viburnum, holly (Ilex), dovetree (Davidia), cotoneaster and plum, apricot, cherry and peach ( Prunus ) are examples of hard-coated seeds. Pick the ripe fruits and soak in water for several days. As the fruit flesh decom¬ poses, run the fermenting mass through the fingers. This will help separate seed from pulp, and will permit the pulp and non- viable seed to rise to the surface, while the viable seed will go to the bottom of the con¬ tainer. A stream of water from a garden hose placed a few inches below the surface of the water will float away the pulp and poor seeds, leaving the good seeds. In some instances seeds of these species germinate in spring after a period of low temperatures. With these the natural process can be imi¬ tated by sowing the cleaned seed in the fall in a drill and -lightly covering with soil. Placing a wire screen over the planting will protect the seeds from rodents and birds. An alternative is to mix seeds with moist material (sand, milled sphagnum moss, sawdust, or screened peat moss) in a plastic bag, properly labelled, and store in the refrigerator until early spring planting. [Ed. note: This process is called stratification (See p. 17 for discussion).] In some of the species of cotoneaster, hawthorn ( Crataegus ), holly and viburnum the seeds have a double dormancy; also, the degree of dormancy varies from crop to crop. One recommendation is that the cleaned seeds be sown in the autumn. While a few seeds may germinate the following spring, most will germinate the second spring or even the third. Another practice is to place the seeds in moist peat, sawdust or sand in a polyethylene freezer bag. Tightly seal, label and store at room temperature for approximately 120 days. Then place in the refrigerator at 34° to 40 °F for another 120 days. Winged Seeds Species such as fir (Abies), spruce (Picea), pine (Pinus) and maple (Acer) have winged seeds. Maple seeds, after they fall to the ground, appear to require a moist mulch for germination; if the moisture content is 14 reduced, germination is delayed. For this reason summer-ripening species, such as red maple {Acer rubrum), can be sown after collecting. Sugar maple seeds ( Acer sac- charum), which ripen in the autumn, re¬ quire a period of cold before germinating. Dormancy in some species, such as the paperbark maple {A. griseum), can be over¬ come somewhat by gathering seeds before they are fully ripe and stratifying at once. Cones of fir, spruce, pine and other coni¬ fers are usually picked from the tree just as they begin to open. The seeds will be shed as the cone scales open. The wings of these seeds are removed by rubbing (or left on by some propagators) and the seed is then stored until spring at 34° to 40 °F in moist peat, sawdust or sand. It is then broadcast on well-drained, sandy loam soil and cov¬ ered with a thin layer of sand or soil. Dur¬ ing the first growing season, the seedlings should be lightly shaded and mulched with a thin layer of pine needles. Experience has proved that cold stratification improves germination of most conifers. Very Fine Seed During early autumn the dehiscent seed capsules of mountain-laurel and other Kalmia spp., rhododendrons, azaleas, and pieris open nearly unnoticed, dispersing their tiny seeds. Often the collector is too late to harvest them. The ideal time to col¬ lect these seeds is when the capsules first turn brown. Place in paper bags, label, and store at room temperature. Capsules will soon open and release seeds. Plant seeds in a greenhouse or indoor light unit in autumn or early winter or out- of-doors the following spring. Use a mixture of two parts peat moss screened through ‘/2-inch mesh and one part perlite in a clean flat or pot with ‘/4 \"-to- ‘/2 of milled or screened (‘/-inch mesh) fresh sphagnum moss on top. Water gently but thoroughly and allow to drain. Distribute the seeds lightly and evenly (over-seeding is all too easy) over the sphagnum moss layer. Water with a fine mist. Do not cover seeds with medium of any sort. Place a sheet of plastic film over the flat and set it where the temperature is about 70 °F. When the seedlings begin to appear, remove the plastic and keep the flat moist. Provide sufficient light and air. The young seedlings can be transplanted into a mixture of two parts Michigan peat, two parts imported peat moss and one part sand. The use of this mixture for ericaceous plants (rhododendrons, azaleas, pieris and others) reduces weeding and damping-off. Seedlings can be transplanted — spaced on one-inch centers in flats or put into small pots — any time after forming two or three leaves. A mulch of pine needles, ground corncobs, wood chips or other coarse organic material is beneficial for ericaceous plants after they are set out into the ground. Spirea, hypericum and hydrangea also fall into the fine-seed classification and re¬ quire the same technique in sowing. How¬ ever, the seedlings should be transplanted into a sandy soil instead of into the peat¬ moss mixture recommended for ericaceous plants. Raising trees and shrubs from seed re¬ quires time and patience, yet will give con¬ siderable pleasure to all who enjoy turning up the unexpected. Separating seed from fruit. Left in water for a few days fruits become soft and seeds can be squeezed out from pulp by hand. Sound seeds generally sink, bad ones float. 15 Buhle Rhododendron seedlings growing on sphagnum in flat.

Galie Fortunately, most of the plants grown from seed are annuals and other plants which germinate readily and under a wide variety of conditions. Simple methods are suffi¬ cient for these. However, these simple germination practices often do not work with some perennial seeds, and with seeds of many woody plants. A brief discussion of the factors involved may be helpful. Seed Dormancy The term dormancy is applied to the inabil¬ ity of a seed to germinate. Dormancy may be due to unfavorable environmental condi¬ tions, or to factors within the seed itself. Some of the environmental factors which influence germination are moisture, tem¬ perature, oxygen and, in a few cases, light. These factors must be in proper balance for all seed germination. Water and oxygen are, of course, necessary for all growth. (See p. 8 for more about them in soil mixtures.) Temperature and Light Some seeds have peculiar temperature re¬ quirements. While most germinate over a rather wide range of temperatures, others are somewhat more particular. Optimum temperatures for germination of some seeds are given on p. 17. Likewise, most seeds will germinate in either light or darkness, but a few require light in order to germinate, while others are inhibited by it. [Ed. note: Japanese um¬ brella pine (Sciadopytis verticillata), will not germinate in the long days of summer.] Hard Seed Coats Internal dormancy is not often considered by gardeners and may be the cause of ap¬ parent failure in growing plants from seed. One of the commonest causes of internal dormancy is a hard seed coat. A seed coat is protection for a seed, but it can also prevent germination by keeping out water and air, Many seeds need to be kept cold and moist for a period of after-ripening before they will germinate. This cold treatment is easily accomplished by mixing clean seeds with moist peat moss, wrapping in plastic, and placing in refrigerator. Label for bag should mention type of seed, date collected, and date placed in refrigerator. 18 Photos by author Heavy seed coats such as those of Camellia sasanqua seeds (center) can be carefully cracked with a nutcracker or nicked with a knife or a small file. and even by restricting the embryo from ex¬ panding and growing. In many cases the ef¬ fect of the hard seed coat can be overcome by cracking the seed coat (being careful not to crush the contents), or by nicking it (scarifying) with a knife or file. Usually it is necessary only to make a small break in the coat to overcome the dormancy. [Ed. note: Here’s a method for scarifying small quan¬ tities of hard coated seeds quickly and eas¬ ily: roll a sheet of emery cloth or sand paper with rough side in, and insert it into a tall jar or can of about one-quart capacity; drop in seeds, cap the jar or can, and shake vigorously until seed coats are worn thin.] Other methods are to soak the seeds in nearly boiling water or in concentrated acids. These methods are not recommended for the amateur because the times of soak¬ ing are often quite critical and too-long soaking can easily kill the seeds; handling concentrated acid involves, of course, a cer¬ tain risk to the operator. Other Types of Dormancy The food storage tissue (endosperm) in some seeds acts very nearly like a hard seed coat; this type of dormancy can usually be overcome using the same methods. In some seeds the immature plant (em¬ bryo) itself is not completely organized at the time the seed is shed. In most such cases not much can be done to speed up germina¬ tion. For example, ginkgo and English and American hollies will germinate only after the embryo has had an opportunity to ma¬ ture at favorable temperatures and humid¬ ity. This may take as long as two or three years. The causes of dormancy in many seeds are not always obvious. These seeds are said to require a period of after-ripening before they will germinate. No doubt certain chemical and physical changes take place during after-ripening, but little is known of their exact nature. The home gardener need not be concerned with this beyond knowing that after-ripening can often be brought about or speeded up by subjecting the seeds to low temperatures for certain periods of time. This cold treatment is called stratifica¬ tion. Seeds can be stratified in damp sand, shredded sphagnum, peat moss, or a mix¬ ture of peat moss and sand. The medium must be moist, but never saturated. The seeds may be placed in layers in the stratify¬ ing medium or may be mixed with it. If they are very small, it may be advisable to fold them in a piece of cheesecloth before strati¬ fying. Containers may be greenhouse flats, glass jars or plastic bags. Jars and bags are most convenient for the amateur, as they can be easily stored in a refrigerator. Jars should have covers to prevent drying-out of the seeds, but they should not fit so tightly as to exclude air. With plastic bags there is no problem. Stratified seeds should be kept 19 at about 40 °F, but in most cases a variation of four or five degrees is not serious. Actual freezing does not help the after-ripening process except in a few cases. Examine the seeds from time to time after they have been in stratification and as soon as any show signs of germinating all should be removed from the cold and planted. Fringe-tree, many viburnums, and peonies have a type of dormancy called epicotyl or shoot dormancy. The seeds germinate and roots appear after a warm treatment, but the shoots fail to develop until they have been exposed to a temperature of about 40 °F for several months. In other seeds there is a combination of factors inhibiting germination, and dormancy can be over¬ come only by combined treatments. Seeds Having Special Requirements for Germination Germination of many seeds is delayed because they have hard seed coats; the condition is particularly common among members of the Legume Family. Scarification of seed coats will greatly hasten germination. The following are a few of the woody plants having such seed coats: Camellia spp. Caragana arborescens, Siberian peashrub (soak in water 12 hrs.) Cercis canadensis, redbud* Cladrastis lutea, yellowwood Cornus florida, dogwood* Cotoneaster spp.* *Also has immature embryo, will need stratifica¬ tion, or autumn sowing. Crataegus mollis, redhaw* Gleditsia triacanthos, honey locust Gymnocladus dioica, Kentucky coffeetree Ilex aquifolia, English holly* Ilex opaca, American holly* Koelreuteria paniculata, golden raintree Paeonia suffruticosa, tree peony Robinia pseudoacacia, black locust Rosa blanda, meadow rose* Other seeds require surprisingly low temperatures, not just for after-ripening, but for ger¬ mination. Examples: Calochortus macrocarpus, mariposa lily, only below 41 °F Delphinium, annual delphinium, best below 68 °F Lewisia rediviva, bitter-root, only below 50 °F Lonicera tatarica, tatarian honeysuckle, and Aquilegia canadensis, American columbine, best in temperatures alternat¬ ing from 50° to 77 °F Viola tricolor, pansy, only below 70 °F Most seeds germinate equally well in light or darkness, but some perform better in light.

Gleaves Here’s how to propagate ferns from spores. A quick reading of a text outlining the fern life cycle would be a very helpful first step. (Most encyclopedias will suffice.) The next step is to obtain spores. When collecting from a living plant, clip a small piece of a fertile frond, place the frond with the spore side down in the middle of a sheet of paper and fold the paper around it. Wait a day or two for the spores to drop onto the paper, then carefully open the paper and remove the frond. Gently tap the dustlike spores to one side of the paper. Large objects such as spore cases will slide down the paper faster. Discard. The next step is to provide a sterile grow¬ ing medium on which to sow spores. Steril¬ ity is essential for success. Moss, fungi, blue-green algae, and green algae are all ag¬ gressive competitors that can ruin a young crop of fern gametophytes. (Gametophytes are the tiny, flat plants that grow from spores.) Once the medium is sterilized it must be kept sterile for at least several weeks. It is best to maintain sterility at least until sporophytes begin to appear. (Sporo- phytes are the offspring of the gametophytes and the final object of our attention.) This could be for as short a time as a few months or as long as a year in unusual cases. For a growing medium I use a fine- textured mix consisting mostly of Canadian peat moss. The exact composition is not critical for most species. For a container I use a Petri dish. If you don’t have Petri dishes, any shallow, clear container can be used. A clear glass or clear plastic party cup covered with plastic wrap will work. How To Sterilize An easy sterilization technique involves heating the soil and container in a micro- wave oven. Fill the container half full with the soil and cover with the glass lid or plas¬ tic wrap. Secure the plastic wrap with a rub¬ ber band. Heat the soil twice at a moderate speed to assure thorough sterilization, mak¬ ing sure not to bubble the soil. If a plastic container is used, avoid excessive heating; the plastic may become misshapen. When the dishes are cool, carefully lift the lid, quickly sprinkle spores into the dish and replace the lid. Do this as fast as possi¬ ble to avoid contamination. The containers should be placed under, and 5 to 10 inches away from, fluorescent lights. A windowsill might substitute, but avoiding direct sunlight and yet getting enough light is difficult. The soil with the spores should be moist but not wet; remember there is no drainage in these containers. With the lids in place the soil will stay moist for a month or more, but when it does begin to dry, use sterile water. This is important! I use the micro- wave oven to boil water in a container with an eye dropper top screwed on loosely to let steam escape. The eye dropper is a good watering tool. When the sporophytes emerge in a few months (or longer) they should be plucked out with a pencil tip and put into another container. A clear plastic party cup with a hole in the bottom and polyethylene plastic wrap (e.g., Glad Wrap) makes an excellent second stage container. Put a couple of inches of soil in the bottom of the cup and moisten it. Sterilization is optional. The ferns are large enough to effectively com¬ pete with most contaminants. Place three small sporophytes with their associated gametophytes into the cup and cover. Under fluorescent lights most ferns will grow to a few inches in height over a period of three or four months. (A few species need a slightly less humid environment.) When the sporophytes reach an inch or two in height, remove them from the cups and plant into clay or plastic pots. Empty the used plastic cups and invert them over the newly potted sporophyte for a week or two to provide a transition period from the highly humid plastic-covered cup to the relatively dry open air of the growing bench. At this point propagation is over and general cultivation begins.*?® 21 MULTIPLICATION BY DIVISION William I.P. Campbell and Alan D. Cook Division is simply cutting or breaking a plant crown, or dump of suckers or aggre¬ gation of tubers, corms or bulbs, into seg¬ ments that are planted and grown into new plants identical to the parent. With no spe¬ cial structures or equipment and very little effort, a gardener can divide certain plants for modest increases. Dividing Perennials To keep most perennials vigorous, they should be divided periodically, discarding the older center growth and replanting only the strong growth from the outer edge of the clump. An easy way to divide a plant is to lift it, then insert two spading forks back-to-back into the clump (see p. 23) and bring the fork handles together, prying the clump apart. This technique reduces dam¬ age to roots. Clumps that are firmly massed (such as ornamental grasses, phlox or rhubarb) may not respond to the two-fork method (for that matter, how many of us have two spad¬ ing forks?). A shovel or spade, or even a hatchet, may be wielded vigorously to chop such clumps into squares (like hunks of sod) which when planted usually respond as rewardingly as gently-teased segments from more fragile clumps. Less drastic division involves modest excavation and removal of peripheral seg¬ ments while leaving the parent plant in its original spot. This works well with plants that form multiple crowns (such as hosta) and with those that respond poorly to total disturbance. Divisions can be made at various times of the year, but a good rule to follow is to divide fall-flowering plants in the spring, and spring-flowering plants in the fall. Some perennials — chrysanthemums are an example — should be divided every year; others, among which are Helenium, aster, Monarda and Oenothera, every two or three years. Many, such as phlox, iris, day- lily, Physostegia and astilbe, should be di¬ vided only every three or four years. Finally, there are some that do not take kindly to being disturbed and so should be left alone unless the plant becomes weak and flowers sparsely; these include peony, gas plant (. Dictamnus ), bleeding-heart (Dicentra spec- fabilis). Oriental poppy ( Papaver orientale), lupine (Lupinus polyphyllus), Christmas- rose ( Helleborus niger), butterfly weed (. Asciepias tuberosa), false indigo ( Baptisia australis), and sea-lavender ( Limonium latifolium). For perennials amenable to division, re¬ fer to the perennial propagation list, p. 28. Multiplying Bulbous Perennials Spring-flowering bulbs, which are also perennials, are usually increased by remov¬ ing the small bulbs or offsets that form at the bases of the mother bulbs and growing them in rich light soil for two or three years. If tulips and narcissi are to be propagated this way they should be planted quite shal¬ low; this will lead to the production of more offsets. Hyacinths can be induced to pro¬ duce a large number of bulblets if the base of the mother bulb is scooped out or if it is scored with several diagonal cuts reaching about half way through the bulb. The oper¬ ation is done in August and the treated bulbs are placed where it is light, warm and dry until October or November, when numerous small bulblets will have formed along the wounds. The whole cluster, old bulb and all, is planted about 5 inches deep. The following summer the young bulbs can be dug and separated, then re¬ planted in the fall. It requires two to five years for young bulbs to reach the flowering stage by these methods. Lilies can be propagated in several ways. Many can be grown from seed, others from bulbils that form on the stems in the axils of 22 Propagating by division. First step is to remove topsoil from around plant. Dividing plant with hand fork. the leaves. Some form such bulbils on the underground portions of the stem. The bulbs of many lilies are formed of scales which furnish another method of propaga¬ tion. The scales are detached, dusted with a fungicide and then placed in a warm propa¬ gating medium where bulblets will form at their bases. The time required for growing flowering-size plants in this way varies from one to four years depending on the species. Plant is carefully lifted with fork. Alternate method of dividing plant using two garden forks back to back. Bringing handles of forks together separates parts of plant with minimum damage. Dividing Shrubs A number of shrubs form crowns or clumps and can be divided, preferably in early spring while dormant, or in autumn where winters are mild. Segments with rooted stems may be chopped loose with a spade, or more gently excavated and excised with pruning shears or pruning saw. In the latter method, care should be taken to avoid dull¬ ing of cutting edges by contact with soil. 23 Photos by H. Gantner Photos by H. Gantner 24 Trim tops of iris. Plant divisions at same depth as they were growing before digging. Drawings by Peter K. Nelson Entire shrubs with a reasonable root mass can be dug and cut into segments by one means or another and immediately replanted. Division is seldom a worthwhile practice if shrubs are relatively young. After a num¬ ber of years in one location, however, the following species may build up divisible crowns or clumps: Aesculus parviflora (bottlebrush buckeye) Aralia spp. (devil’s walking stick) Aronia spp. (chokeberry) Berberis spp. (barberry) Clerodendron spp. (glory-bower) Clethra spp. (summersweet) Cornus spp. (shrubby dogwoods) Deutzia spp. Euonymus spp. Gaultheria spp. (wintergreen) Hydrangea spp. Hypericum calycinum (St. Johnswort) Indigofera spp. (indigo) I tea virginica Kerria spp. Lespedeza spp. (bush-clover) Leucothoe spp. Mahonia spp. (holly-grape) Neviusia alabamensis (snow-wreath) Paxistima spp. (pachistima) Pachysandra spp. Polygonum spp. (knotweed) Potentilla fruticosa (bush cinquefoil) Rhododendron spp. (some azaleas) Rhus spp. (sumac) Rosa spp. (some shrubby roses) Rubus spp. (bramble fruits) Spiraea spp. (spirea) Symphoricarpos spp. (coralberry, snow- berry) Syringa spp. (lilac) Vaccinium spp. (blueberry, cranberry) Xanthorhiza simplicissima (yellowroot) 25 PERENNIAL PROPAGATION Steven M, Still Herbaceous perennials, dependable in form, texture and color, come up from the same root system year after year. Another advantage of this plant group is ease of propagation by the home gardener. No wonder at their renewed popularity. There are several reasons for the interest in propagating perennials. Plants can be in¬ creased with little expense and relatively lit¬ tle effort. A homeowner can acquire plants (from friends, public gardens or elsewhere) that may be unavailable through commer¬ cial sources. And propagating is enjoyable and gratifying. There is something inher¬ ently pleasing about taking seeds or cuttings from a single plant and ending up with a limitless number of new plants. Most perennials can be propagated by more than one method. Propagation may be sexual (in which case seeds are used, see p. 9) or asexual (including division, stem cuttings and root cuttings). Division Division has always been a simple reliable method of propagating perennials, not re¬ quiring any special facilities or equipment. If there is a disadvantage to this method, it would be that it is inefficient in terms of the rate of increase. With division the main consideration is timing. Some, such as iris and peony, re¬ quire very specific times. The general ad¬ vice, however, is to divide fall-flowering perennials in the spring and spring-flowering perennials in the autumn. If plants are transplanted in autumn it should be done in time for the plants to become well estab¬ lished before winter. They should be of good size and mulched well for the winter because they are more susceptible to heav¬ ing. If one lives in areas of severe winters, division and replanting should occur almost exclusively in spring. Some perennials, such as shasta daisy, re¬ quire dividing every year; others, such as beebalm and sneezeweed, every two or three years. Many, such as daylily, Maltese cross and bearded iris, should be divided every three or four years. Finally, there are some that should be disturbed as little as possible, including butterfly weed, false in¬ digo, balloon-flower, sea-lavender, peony, and gas plant. These propagation steps are used for many perennials, including daylilies and Siberian iris. After trimming roots, the plant is divided by hand or with a knife, or even an axe if especially woody. 26 Drawings by Eva Melody H. Gantner Chrysanthemums need garden renewal every year or two. Some growers like to propagate them by rooting cuttings from new shoots in spring, others prefer to divide plants, resetting only the vigorous offsets. Cuttings Some perennials don’t produce seed or don’t come true from seed, and are also not suitable for division. To propagate them stem or root cuttings are often used. Spring-flowering plants produce the best stem cuttings in midsummer when growth that developed after flowering has hardened off. Cuttings from summer and fall flower¬ ing perennials should be taken in late spring. See pp. 36, 45 and 46. Some perennials are more easily propa¬ gated by root cuttings which may be taken from plants dug in the autumn when the roots have stored the most carbohydrates, but spring and even summer root cuttings are used. Two species commonly propa¬ gated by root cuttings are garden phlox and oriental poppy. See p. 51. Multiplying Bulbous Perennials Spring-flowering bulbs are usually in¬ creased by removing the small bulbs or off¬ sets that form at the bases of the mother bulbs. Tulips and daffodils are two exam¬ ples of bulbs that can be propagated in this manner. Loose-scaled bulbs, such as garden lily, can be propagated in several ways. The scale of the garden lily can be detached, dusted with a fungicide and placed in a propagation medium where bulblets will form at the base of the scale. Lilies can also be propagated by seed or from bulbils that form on the stems in the leaf axils. Propa¬ gation of bulbous plants by seeds has the same disadvantage as with other perennials in that it will take three or four years before the plant will flower. ^ Making divisions of peony roots; for best results each division should have three to five eyes. 27 PERENNIAL PROPAGATION o cu C \"O 1 > 5\"° ^ o C 2 u 3 0) 0J 5> Qj & F E ■-3 o 11 u ° LT ) LJ °S O £ e i£ , cu % •, o =a 8 QJ _C O.'C ^1 E E 5 c c ^ n\"P Q.

ROOTING SOFTWOOD CUTTINGS Alan D. Cook Propagation by means of softwood cuttings is a simple method of multiplying many kinds of trees and shrubs. Softwood cut¬ tings are made from the current season’s growth with nearly mature foliage. With proper treatment and modern techniques, such as the use of root-inducing hormones, softwood cuttings of many woody plants formerly propagated only by grafting can now be successfully rooted. Typical exam¬ ples are magnolia ( Magnolia spp.), Asiatic maples (e.g. Acer japonicum, A. palma- turn), and pink flowering dogwood { Cornus florida rubra). When To Take Cuttings There are no hard and fast rules as to when softwood cuttings should be taken, but in general, cuttings of deciduous plants (those which lose their leaves in winter) are taken in late spring and summer, those of broad¬ leaved evergreens in summer. For many easy-to-root species, timing is relatively unimportant. A good general rule for difficult subjects is to take cuttings when the shoots will snap when bent. Early morning is the ideal time to take cuttings. Terminal portions of growth, whether leaders or side shoots, are best. A long shoot of an easy-to-root species may be cut into several cuttings. Discard any infested with disease or insects. Make cuttings 2 to 6 inches long, depend¬ ing on the variety and available shoots. Make basal cuts about !4 * below a node. Keep cuttings uniform in length. Short cut¬ tings can be shaded out by taller ones. Cuttings must not be subjected to desic¬ cation. Cut a small handful and place im¬ mediately in a plastic bag or in damp bur¬ lap; keep them shaded. Small lots can be put immediately in a bucket of water. Sharp pruning shears may be used for collecting cuttings, but an experienced propagator can cut faster and more cleanly with a sharp grafting knife. Cuttings of some plants, such as Cytisus, Corylopsis and Coronilla, are found to root better if side shoots are taken with a slight “heel.” This is done by tearing the cuttings from the parent plant with a downward pull taking a bit of the larger trunk’s tissue. In a cool shaded place, prepare cuttings for sticking. The more leaves, the faster and better a cutting can root, and some propa¬ gators do not remove bottom leaves. How¬ ever, treatment with hormone powder and sticking in rooting medium are easier if the basal leaves are removed. With most cut¬ tings, removal is by pulling the cutting with one hand through thumb and forefinger of the other. This often causes some wounding which may be beneficial. With soft cut¬ tings, it may cause breakage of stems and damage to lower buds (which may be desir¬ able for producing bushy plants). To pre¬ vent excessive damage, pick leaves off one at a time with fingers, or cut them with knife or shears. Remaining leaves, if they are large and space is limited, may be cut back up to one half, but some plant vigor will be sacrificed. An approved practice with many plants (rhododendrons, maples, magnolias and deciduous azaleas) is to wound the base of the cutting before applying the hormone. Draw a sharp knife down the side of the stem for a distance of one or two inches above the base end to expose the active tissue (cambium) beneath the bark. Some propagators terminate the wound about !4 * from the cutting base to reduce possibility of decay. As fast as the cuttings are prepared, place between moist paper or cloth, or in a poly¬ ethylene bag. They should be planted with¬ out delay but, if necessary, they may be put into a plastic bag and stored in a refrigerator. Root-Promoting Hormones Hormones to induce the growth of roots on cuttings are available under several trade names. (See p. 50.) In general, powders are the best for amateur use. Follow the manu- 35 several sections. 36 Drawings by Peter K. Nelson facturers’ instructions. Remove only enough rooting material for the job at hand. Do not dip directly in the original packaging or return used hormone powder to package; you may contaminate both the package and subsequent cuttings. If instruc¬ tions are unavailable, experiment by using a strong powder for a few cuttings, normal for some, and stick a few with no treat¬ ment. Keep records. Rooting Media The rooting medium (see p. 4) can be placed in small boxes or greenhouse flats, bulb pans or flower pots, plastic boxes, cold frames, or in specially prepared beds in shady spots out-of-doors. Recently devel¬ oped aids to rooting cuttings are the use of plastic film (see p. 4) and mist (see pp. 45-7). ■ Before dipping in hormone powder, base of cutting may be “wounded” by cut¬ ting away a thin strip of bark. 37 Cuttings are inserted into the medium to one fourth to one half their length. Inserting the Cuttings Before inserting the cuttings the medium should be copiously watered and allowed to drain. Insert cuttings to about !4 their length if they are to be placed where the humidity can be kept high, to about half their length if planted in the open. Insert just far enough apart to permit all leaves to receive light. The long-established practice of firmly tamping the medium about the cuttings is no longer considered necessary. After in¬ serting the cuttings, water again; this washes the particles closely about the bases of the cuttings. Mixtures containing peat moss should be watered only moderately, because peat absorbs a great deal of water and tends to remain too wet too long. Care During Rooting During rooting the medium must be kept uniformly moist, but never soggy. For the first 7 to 10 days the cuttings should be lightly shaded — with cheesecloth, white¬ washed glass or covers of lath or netting. After cuttings are established, the shade can be gradually reduced. Many broad-leaved evergreens will root in partial shade; most deciduous plants need more light. If cuttings are in closed containers, ven- Rooted cutting ready for transplanting. 38 tilate enough to prevent growth of fungi. After cuttings are rooted, the covering should be removed for increasing periods of time until finally left off entirely. Rooting under a mist system, if possible, is ideal. (See p. 45.) By autumn many of the cuttings will be ready for planting directly in the ground. If they were rooted late in the season, they can be placed in a cold frame the first winter. When planting rooted cuttings directly from the rooting medium to outdoor beds, place 6 to 12 inches apart. When the plants begin to crowd, transplant. Cuttings placed directly in outdoor beds will need shading for a longer period than those grown in pots. Some woody plants such as magnolias, maples, pink flowering dogwood and some viburnums are easy to root, but difficult to overwinter. The best solution is to root the cuttings as early as possible so that they are well established by winter. Place rooted cut¬ tings where the temperature is just above freezing, but below 45 °F throughout the winter. Small quantities may be snugly wrapped in plastic and stored in the refrig¬ erator. Another overwintering aid for such cuttings is to extend day length with supple¬ mental illumination to 16 hours or more.

PROPAGATION FROM HARDWOOD CUTTINGS Roy M. Nordine For propagation of woody plants from hardwood cuttings, the current season’s growth is generally used, either the long canes that grew up from the base of the plant or the new growth on the ends of the branches. These canes or cuttings may be gathered soon after the dormant sea¬ son has begun, or any time until late win¬ ter. Material from plants that may be injured by severe winter weather should be gathered before temperatures have dropped. Storage The canes may be made into cuttings at the time of gathering, or stored until later in a cool place (below 50 °F, even at freezing temperatures). It is not necessary to bury them or to put the cut ends in moist mate¬ rial, but the canes should not at any time be subjected to drying conditions such as high or fluctuating temperatures, drying winds, or any circumstance that may draw the moisture from them. It is equally important to prevent excessive moisture near the stored material. The best way to store the canes is to bury them in a generous quantity of moist but not wet material, such as peat, sand, wood shavings, sawdust, sphagnum moss, or vermiculite. Preparing Cuttings Make cuttings 6 to 8 inches long with a knife or with pruning shears. Cut straight across or with a slight slant. Do not use very thin, weak canes or late growth at tips of 40 Suitable branches for making hardwood cuttings, and bundles of cuttings ready for storage. canes. The basal cut is unimportant except on plants with hollow stems or larger spongy pith, in which cases the basal cut is made just below a node (bud). The upper cut should be one-fourth inch or so above a bud whenever possible. Gather the finished cuttings into bundles of convenient size. Tap the bottom of the bundle on a flat surface to level, label, and tie with cord or fine wire. Bury the bundles in sand, well-drained soil or suitable medium, either horizontally or vertically. Planting The cuttings should be placed in the ground as soon as the soil is workable. (Hormone treatment is not necessary.) Place them in full sun 9 inches apart, in rows 2 feet apart. Leave for two to three years. Or they may be set 6 inches apart, in rows a foot apart, and removed after one season. A tool such as a spade should be used to make an open¬ ing in the ground just wide enough to take the cutting and deep enough to place the top bud at the soil surface. Firm the soil around the cutting. The percentage of cuttings that grow will vary considerably, depending on many circumstances; results of 80 percent are excellent. [Ed. note: For small quantities of cuttings, wrap snugly in plastic and store in the back of the refrigerator until planting time. Or take, make, and stick hardwoods in autumn before soil freezes. Mulch with six to eight inches of loose straw to reduce heaving. Remove straw in early spring when growth begins. Or, with hardy types, wait until spring to take, make, and stick hardwood cuttings.] The hardwood cutting technique may be applied to these: Akebia quinata (five-leaf akebia) Alnus (alder) Amorpha (lead plant) Callicarpa (beauty berry) Campsis radicans (trumpet vine) Caragana (pea shrub) Caryopteris (bluebeard) Bundles of hardwood cuttings ready to be buried for storage until spring. 41 . »*• «*••••■ • Celastrus (bittersweet) Colutea (bladder-senna) Deutzia Eleagnus angustifolia (Russian olive) Euonymus — some species Ficus carica (fig) Forsythia Gymnocladus (Kentucky coffeetree) Hibiscus syriacus (rose-of-Sharon) Hydrangea Hypericum (St. Johnswort) Kerria Kolkwitzia (beauty bush) Ligustrum (privet) Lonicera (honeysuckle) Lycium (matrimony vine) Morus (mulberry) Parthenocissus (Boston ivy and Virginia creeper) Philadelphus (mock-orange) Physocarpus (ninebark) Populus (poplar) Potentilla (cinquefoil) Ribes (currant) Rosa (rose) — some climbers and ramblers Salix (willow) Sambucus (elderberry) Spiraea (spirea) Symph oricarpos (Indian currant and snow- berry Syringa persica (Persian lilac) Tamarix (tamarisk) Vitis (grape) Weigeia Some Cutting Comments Cuttings from young plants tend to root more easily than those from older plants. Cuttings from lower portions of plants and from water sprouts and suckers are more juvenile and tend to root faster and more easily. (Avoid understock suckers on grafted plants.) As a rule, cuttings that have grown in sunshine root better than those that have been shaded. (Rhododendron cuttings are an exception.) Early morning, especially for softwood cuttings, is the best collection time. Cuttings should remain in an upright position from the time of cutting until they are stuck. This allows the greatest translocation to the base of root-promoting chemicals within the cutting. Some operators put upright cuttings in plastic bags in a refrigerator for two days at 35-40 °F before sticking. Never make a second basal cut, lest you remove some of those translocated chemicals. As insurance against drying, some propagators dip cuttings in an antidesiccant (Wiit- Pruf, Clearspray, etc.) before sticking. Others dip cuttings into pesticide solutions. A pop¬ ular dip mixture is the insecticide Sevin and the fungicide Benlate (Benomyl) at manufac¬ turers’ recommended rates for spraying. Cuttings from vertical stems, especially evergreens such as yew (Taxus) will grow into upright plants; cuttings from low side shoots will develop into bushy plants with spreading tendencies. Unless it’s the rainy season, for extra insurance, water stock plants copiously two days prior to collecting cuttings. For cuttings dipped into rooting powder, make holes or a wide groove in the rooting medium large enough to accommodate cuttings without rubbing off the powder. Use a pencil, dowel, cleaver, etc. Firm medium (don’t pack it vigorously) about the cutting bases. For plants whose cuttings refuse to root with normal treatment, try: (1) forced-growth cuttings (see p. 48). (2) etiolation — a month prior to collection, wrap the basal portion of the intended cut¬ ting with black plastic electrical tape, then cut below the tape, remove tape, process the cutting. (3) girdling — a month before taking cuttings, remove a Vi \" wide band of bark including cambium (scrape it off) at the base of each intended cutting. For an extra boost, make a petroleum jelly-rooting powder paste, apply to bark just above girdle, wrap with foil or plastic. After a month, cut in the girdled area and process the cutting. S 42 Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Evergreens from Cuttings If a plant doesn’t drop current-season foliage in autumn, it’s an evergreen. Some ever¬ greens can be easily propagated by summer softwood cuttings (azaleas, pyracantha, camellia, evergreen euonymus), but most broadleaf evergreen cuttings are made during autumn (September, October and November in latitudes of New York and Columbus, Ohio), and narrowleaf evergreen cuttings generally root best if handled during November, December and January. Terminology for such cuttings rates a thesaurus section: firm- wood, ripewood, intermediate, semi-hardwood, evergreen hardwood. The name doesn’t matter; some other factors do. Broadleaf Evergreens Take cuttings in the morning from healthy stock plants, selecting fully mature terminal shoots 3-to-5-inches long (can be longer; will of course be shorter from dwarf varieties). Make cuts with sharp knife or pruning shears, and just below a node if convenient. Make cuttings of uniform length as you collect them because second basal cuts made in the work space later mess up physiological happenings. It matters little whether cuts are straight across or slightly angled. Protect from sun and wind with black or brown trash bags, cov¬ ered baskets, moist burlap, and the like. Don’t collect frozen broadleaf evergreen cuttings because of brittleness. At the work table, remove lower leaves (by rough stripping or cutting) and flower buds, if any. If you wish, cut back large leaves, such as some rhododendrons, for easier handling and more efficient use of space. Basal wounding with a sharp knife or razor blade enhances rooting chances for some plants, notably rhododendron and some hollies (Ilex spp.). (See p. 35.) Treat cuttings with an appropriate rooting compound (see p. 50), stick in a moist medium of your choice (see p. 4), in a structure with overwintering protection — cold frame (including Nearing frame), hotbed or plastic tent in greenhouse or home. Plastic tents in the home need plenty of artificial light (see “Propagation Devices,” p. 8). Temperatures, except for cold frames, should be 60-75 °F, and bottom heat hastens rooting. Open benches in the greenhouse can be used with a misting set-up. After rooting, pot or transplant into flats and give careful attention to watering. Plant into nursery beds after the last frost in spring. Cold frame cuttings will likely not be ready that soon and may not be ready for outdoor culture until the second spring. Narrowleaf Evergreens Make narrowleaf evergreen cuttings after a hard freeze or two. Often weather will necessi¬ tate collection from frozen plants. Be gentle because frozen foliage is brittle; thaw slowly and all will be well. Collect cuttings of current season’s growth, 3 \"-6\" or even 8\" long, with sharp shears or knife. Put in plastic bags immediately. The collecting cut is to be the only basal cut. The position on the plant of a cutting is often important, especially with Taxus (yew) varieties. Upright shoots will produce plants that tend to grow vertically, bushy side shoot cuttings will grow into bushy plants with tendencies to horizontal growth. Indoors, strip foliage from the bottom third of the cuttings. Wounding may aid in root¬ ing. Difficult-to-root varieties may benefit from wounding and/or extra-strength rooting compounds. Reproductive buds are at the tips and reduction of leaf size is not practiced. Mist is not recommended for narrowleaf evergreens, but daily syringing is practiced in open (uncovered) benches in greenhouses.

It’s essentially a 3 ' x 12 ' box with two standard 3 ' x 6 ' glazed cold frame sashes. The box, about 18\" deep, is sunk below soil level in standard cold frame style, but the box is provided with a tight bottom of tongue- and-groove flooring. Four inches of peat moss on the bottom is topped with several inches of whatever rooting medium the propagator prefers. A superstructure of 2 \" x 4 \" framing covered with galvanized steel or other durable opaque material is constructed above the box (see sketch), about 5 feet tall at the highest point. The unit must be sited with the open side facing directly north. Cuttings are stuck and watered in and glass sash is put in place. Once a week or so, ex¬ cept in freezing weather, the cuttings are watered. Rooting is usually excellent by the fol¬ lowing spring or early summer. Plastic sash will reduce watering needs but increase chances of fungal diseases. 44 M. Ecker Mellinger ’s MIST PROPAGATION OF CUTTINGS Cuttings under mist do not lose moisture readily, and high temperature is seldom a prob¬ lem. Oddly enough, fungal diseases such as mildew are subdued by mist. No wonder mist has become the standard means of commercial propagation of softwood cuttings. But there are some pitfalls and limitations. Power, water, or equipment failure on a hot sunny day can wipe out a crop. Mineral buildup from hard water on foliage reduces plant vigor and can interfere with electronic mist controls. Wind can play havoc with mist pat¬ terns. Also, mist is of questionable value for evergreen cuttings. But pros outweigh cons. Mist can be used in the greenhouse or in outside beds, and a number of systems are adequate (see p. 46). When setting up a mist system, it’s a good idea to test the nozzles for coverage with available water pressure, then plan nozzle spacing ac¬ cordingly. Many propagators favor a design with supply pipe on or beneath cutting medium and nozzles on risers to eliminate dripping that overhead supply pipes allow. For outdoor beds, a two-line installation ensures good coverage in all but very high winds. Intermittent mist uses less water than continuous mist and usually gives better rooting. A solenoid valve, electrically con¬ trolled, regulates water flow. A commonly used control for intermittent mist is a time clock that can be easily set for various com¬ binations of mist duration and interval. Six seconds of mist per minute is recommended Flora-mist fogger, a popular misting nozzle. Greenhouse bench with nozzles set on vertical risers from pipeline. 45 D. V. Sweet D. V. Sweet Mist produced by the apparatus shown on p. 45. by some operators; others prefer ten or fif¬ teen seconds every three minutes. A mist system medium must be very well drained and only 4 \"-5\" deep. Coarse sand and perlite are widely used. As soon as rooted, cuttings should be hardened off by gradually reducing mist in¬ tervals, or by moving for a few days to a place where water loss will be minimal. Then rooted cuttings may be potted or planted in a nursery bed. *5* A Mist Box Doris Schuster A mist box is an enclosure for rooting cuttings of perennials, shrubs, and other plants. It is a simple and inexpensive system to construct and operate, and it can give unending interest and an abundance of new plants. My mist box is a four-sided enclosure, 36\" square, in a fairly sunny well-drained part of the backyard. It is a “continuous mist” system, operating through the heat of each day from about 7:00 am to 5:00 pm, in sum¬ mertime; yet it never uses more than ten gallons of water a day. To begin, drive four stakes or poles 8\"- 10\" into the ground with poles extend¬ ing 36\" aboveground, arranged in a square 36\" on each side. In the center of the square, rig an upright pipe or tube with a mist noz¬ zle at the top about 18\" off the ground, and a horizontal supply pipe at ground level ex¬ tending outside the square. Around the four stakes, nail four 6 \"-wide side boards at ground level to make a box without a bottom. One side board should have a notch at the bottom to accommodate the water pipe. Wrap a piece of heavy (4 mil or thicker) clear plastic sheeting around the four cor¬ ner posts to form the sides of the enclosure. The box has no top covering. With a staple gun, staple the plastic to each corner post and along the bottom boards. If you ar¬ range for one side to open or be removable, it will be much more convenient when you are putting cuttings into the bed. Fit the horizontal supply pipe with a gar¬ den hose connector and attach a hose to a water supply at one end and the mist supply at the other. Now fill the mist box with 6\" of coarse builders’ sand, packed firmly. Let the mist spray over it for several hours to settle the sand. It will take approximately 450 pounds of sand for a box this size. To activate the mist nozzle, simply open the faucet slightly at the hose connection. A fine even mist that you can barely see will keep the leaves of cuttings moist while roots are forming. Turn on the mist as soon as the sun becomes warm and the dew on the leaves of your cuttings drys. Turn it off as soon as the heat of the day is over. This, of course, is a primitive, attention¬ demanding system. More sophisticated sys¬ tems employ strainers for cleanest possible water, and solenoid valves connected to 46 A mist box fitted with mist nozzle and plastic sides, ready for sand and cuttings. electric timers or moisture-sensing devices to deliver intermittent mist. (See mist sup¬ pliers on p. 76.) Start using the mist box early in the year as you divide perennials. Insert small pieces of roots or crowns too small for transplant¬ ing directly into the garden. Dip first into rooting hormone, then tuck into the sand. I have succeeded with delphinium, phlox, coral-bells, coreopsis, hosta, iris, daylilies and many others. Chrysanthemum cuttings can be started in early May. After creeping phlox and basket-of-gold alyssum bloom, stick cuttings into the sand and almost every piece will root. When frost danger is past, slips of coleus, geraniums, impatiens, ivy, Joseph’s coat and other house plants will root with ease under the mist. About mid-June, after shrubs and roses have flowered, is an ideal time to take cut¬ tings from them. Boxwood, euonymus, flowering quince, mock-orange, deutzia, some viburnums, and red-twig dogwood are a few of the shrubs I have rooted easily. Choose new-season growth that has begun to harden but is not yet completely brown and woody. Take lengths 8\"- 12 \"-long, strip leaves from the lower two inches; score the bark there and dip end into hormone pow¬ der. Then insert them firmly in the sand. Some kinds will show no growth before the growing season ends but if the stems are still firm, leave alone and they will probably start growth the next spring. When transplanting rooted cuttings out of the mist bed to the open garden, it is im¬ portant, first, to prepare the soil well with additions of peat, compost and sand worked in; and second, to shade the new trans¬ plants for a few days until they recover. I set boxes over them by day, and remove them each evening. I also water plants at transplanting with a weak fertilizer solution. If for some reason the mist runs all night, it will do no harm. In fact, sometimes when I must be away for several days, I let the nozzle run continuously at low output. To winterize the box in October I merely disconnect the garden hose and roll it up for storage. The mist nozzle is taken off and stored carefully with other garden equip¬ ment indoors so it will not be damaged. It is not necessary to cover the mist box but mulch can be applied. 47 M. Ecker When ordinary cuttings fail, try greenhouse -forced cuttings . . . Cuttings by Force Many species that don’t respond to softwood-cutting propagation efforts can be success¬ fully propagated from cuttings of ultra-soft shoots forced under greenhouse or similar con¬ ditions (such as a lighted indoor propagating chamber). Some plants in this category are mountain-laurel ( Kalmia spp.), pieris (often called andro- meda) ( Pieris spp.), deciduous azaleas (Rhododendron spp.), Fothergilla spp., Stewartia spp. and others. A greenhouse or superior-quality lighted indoor propagating unit may be the path to suc¬ cessful propagation using the forced-growth-cutting method. For years, limited numbers of plants from difficult stock have been produced by cuttings from plants brought into greenhouse growing conditions in mid-winter after having gone dormant in autumn. In this unseasonable environment ultra-soft shoots result, are cut off, stuck in plastic tents or mist beds, and rooted in high percentages. At first propagators set the stock plants, balled and burlapped or potted, conventionally upright on a greenhouse bench. Somewhere in the past a thinking person obtained much more new growth and thus many more cuttings by placing stock plants horizontally, redis¬ tributing the flow of hormones that ordinarily goes from top to roots and promoting new growth all along the axis of the stock plant instead of only from terminal buds. Root-promoting chemicals may or may not help forced cuttings to root, but high humid¬ ity and temperatures near 70 °F do. The stock plant(s) may be salvaged after taking cuttings. Return to upright position, allow new shoots to develop undisturbed, and gradually harden off the plant(s) by extra ventilation and replant outside after frost danger. Good propagators need good. . . Propagating Tools The grafting knife, with which propagators not only graft but collect and prepare cuttings, including wounding, is a must for a serious propagator. (Pruning shears are better for hardwood cuttings.) The knife is simple in design with a straight cutting edge which is bev¬ eled on one side only. When held in the right hand with the edge away from the knuck"
