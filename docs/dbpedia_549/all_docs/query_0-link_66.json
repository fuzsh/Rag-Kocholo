Anderson Department of Horticultural Science, University of Minnesota, 1970 Folwell Avenue, Saint Paul, Minnesota 55108 U.S.A.\n\nFlowers have long been associated with each civilization and culture in the world. Dating as far back as the Neanderthals, flowers were used to decorate graves and celebrate major life events, expressing emotions in ways that words are deficient. Numerous cultures have incorporated flowers into their everyday lives as expressions of beauty and art. The first flower breeder is unknown, but the historic record provides us with a rich accounting of numerous flower selections and cultivars, presumably many of which were either selected as mutations or the result of directed breeding. Many seed and vegetatively-propagated cultivars of flower crops have been preserved as heirlooms, landraces, and are important sources of historic germplasm. The science and art of flower breeding and genetics is not well documented. Much of the knowledge is transferred from one generation of flower breeders to the next within each public and private sector breeding program. While there are many monographs devoted to specific crops, few, if any, attempt to combine a diverse array of floriculture crops and address important issues for the current and following generations of flower breeders/geneticists. Oddly enough, the early genetics work of the 20th century (e.g. research by East, Mangelsdorf, etc.) was conducted on flowering crops, such as snapdragons and flowering tobacco. Unfortunately, subsequent genetic research often shifted to agronomic (food) crops. Flower breeders, while hard at work researching, collecting wild germplasm, domesticating seed and vegetative crops, and producing thousands of new cultivars for the commercial market, remained predominantly beneath the radar screen. As a result, our current floricultural crops have a paucity of genetic and breeding data in the public record since most of the last 3 N.O. Anderson (ed.), Flower Breeding and Genetics, 3–5. © 2007 Springer.\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\ncentury’s efforts are proprietary in the private breeder companies. A recent publication on Flower Seeds (edited by McDonald and Kwong, CABI publishers, 2004) has helped to change this dilemma. This monograph is dedicated to alleviating this oversight with the goal of preserving much of the genetic and breeding information for future use, as well as spawning the domestication of future floricultural crops. It was under this pretext that the present monograph was conceptualized by many members of the Ornamental Plant Breeding Working Group, under the auspices of the American Society of Horticultural Scientists. Additional ideas and input arose from discussions with other scientists at the annual meetings of the International Society for Horticultural Science. Undoubtedly, the primary reason no previous monograph has been devoted to such a wide range of topics as are covered in this book is that it is a monumental task. I was eager to assume editorship of this monograph, having directed both private and public sector flower breeding programs, as I felt there was a profound need for such a reference. The call for submissions began in 2001; reviewing and final editing took four years to accomplish due to the scope of topics and crops covered, as well as the busy schedules of each and every contributor. This book has many significant contributions to the science of flower breeding and genetics. The first six chapters are devoted to topics of wide interest to floriculturists and all plant breeders. Dr. John Erwin provides a thorough examination of the factors affecting flowering in Chapter 1. The essential elements of flowering need adequate characterization and manipulation for any flowering crop to be successfully bred, domesticated, and introduced into the market. Advent of new traits in floriculture crops are explored in many chapters, including the phenomenon of ‘annualized perennials’ by Drs. Wilkins and Anderson (Chapter 2). The science and art of cultivar trialing in private and sector breeder trials and display gardens is exquisitely delineated by the foremost trial coordinator of our time, Mr. Jim Nau of Ball Horticultural Company (Chapter 3). Marketing of floriculture crops is probably the most advanced of any horticulture or agronomic commodity and can serve as a template for many other crops. Ms. Penny Aguirre provides detailed explanation of all the necessary protection, which can be offered to new flower products in any country of the world (Chapter 4). Never before have we had the opportunity to have a reference devoted to plant germplasm collection, maintenance, and the necessary rules of adherence to international and national treaties governing plant germplasm. Dr. David Tay, the Director of the Ornamental Plant Germplasm Center for the United States Department of Agriculture, provides an exhaustive description of important procedures on this topic (Chapter 5). New issues continually face the global floriculture market, not least of which is crop\n\nFlower breeding & genetics\n\n5\n\ninvasiveness. Dr. Anderson brings this topic to the attention of our readers to encourage flower breeding programs and all other parties in the distribution channel to research and develop strategies to prevent continued release of invasive flowering crops (Chapter 6). The sections of crop-specific breeding & genetics are divided into four floriculture commodity groups: bedding plants, flowering potted plants, cut flowers, and herbaceous perennials. Breeding and genetic techniques for a total of 24 floriculture crops are covered in these sections. Insertion of each crop into one of these commodity groups was a challenge, since many crops are in multiple groups. I chose to insert each crop into a commodity grouping, based on its predominant use in the marketplace. Chapter formats for each crop follow a similar layout for ease in reading. The crops covered in these sections represent a diversity of life history (annual—perennial), age (new—old crops), levels of domestication (relatively recent to those >1,000 years old), ploidy (diploid to complex polyploids), breeding systems (self incompatible to self compatible and all combinations in between), propagation mode (seed, vegetative), etc. Many crops have relatively little genetic information available. We look to future generations of flower breeders/geneticists to expand this area. Other crops require other research topics to be addressed, such as linkage maps, trisomic development, genetic engineering, regeneration/transformation technologies, shortening lengthy life cycles, cytogenetics, manipulation of ploidy levels, interspecific hybridization, removal of reproductive barriers, manipulation of hybrid breakdown, etc. Each author provides an extensive review of the literature, the current state-of-the-art, crop-specific future needs, and ideotypes for continued transformation of each taxa. I trust that each reader will use the information contained herein to further the progress in flowering crops for future generations. Flower breeding & genetics is an exciting field of research and discovery. Numerous scientists have devoted their lives to this subject. It is one of the most rewarding professions in the world! Neil O. Anderson, Editor 15 September 2005\n\nChapter 1 FACTORS AFFECTING FLOWERING IN ORNAMENTAL PLANTS John Erwin Department of Horticultural Science, University of Minnesota, 1970 Folwell Avenue, St. Paul, MN 55108 U.S.A.\n\nAbstract:\n\nFlowering is the cornerstone of floricultural crops, regardless of class (bedding plants, herbaceous perennials, cut flowers, flowering potted plants); the only crop exceptions are those grown for their colorful foliage. During flower breeding and crop domestication, both public and private sector flower breeding programs must conduct research to discern the various control mechanisms for flower initiation and development. Important flowering concepts covered in this chapter include autonomous regulation (phase change; species, meristem size, and environmental factor affects), external regulation (photoperiodism, vernalization, devernalization, irradiance and light quality, and their interactions), irradiance induction, stress induction (ehtylene, water), flower development requirements (photoperiodism, temperature, stress), and dormancy.\n\nKey words:\n\nDormancy, facultative irradiance response, floral evocation, floral induction, flower initiation, flower development, heat delay, irradiance indifference, phase change, plant growth regulators, vernalization.\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFlowering, or the transition from leaf (vegetative phase) to flower (reproductive phase) production by a meristem, can be stimulated by internal or external cues. Internal or autonomous cues include flowering responses that result from factors such as plant age or size. In contrast, external cues include flowering responses that result from environmental stimuli such as day/night length, low temperature, fire, and/or the presence of water. The development of internal cues to control flowering enable plants to regulate flowering when a plant is at an optimal size or age. The 7 N.O. Anderson (ed.), Flower Breeding and Genetics, 7–48. © 2007 Springer.\n\n8\n\nChapter 1\n\ndevelopment of external cues allows for optimal timing of flowering during a year to ensure successful pollination and seed development prior to inclement conditions as well as for synchronized flowering within a population. Such synchrony is essential to for successful cross-pollination of outcrossing species. Steps in the flowering process, as well as autonomous and external cues that result in flowering and how they can be applied by flower breeders / plant physiologists will be discussed in this chapter. Both basic and applied literature will be reviewed. The chapter will distinguish between factors that result in flowering as a result of induction versus the breaking of dormancy. In addition, detailed information on specific conditions that promote flowering of a number of herbaceous ornamental species will be presented to enable a commercial grower, private or public sector flower breeder, and/or research scientist to induce flowering at any desired time. Much of this specific information is very recently discovered. In addition, data on classification of species into irradiance response groups has recently been introduced (Erwin and Warner, 2002; Mattson, 2002; Mattson and Erwin, 2003 a, b).\n\n2.\n\nTHE FLOWERING PROCESS\n\n2.1\n\nTerminology\n\nThe processes whereby events in a shoot meristem are altered in such a way to produce flowers as opposed to leaves are collectively referred to as ‘floral evocation’. ‘Floral induction’ is the actual signal that results in evocation. Formation of flower buds after induction is referred to as ‘flower initiation’. The process after flower initiation until anthesis is referred to as ‘flower development’. ‘Anthesis’ refers to the shedding of pollen by the stamen. It should be noted that flower opening (petal unfolding) can occur prior to, during, or after anthesis. A meristem is ‘competent’ to flower when it can respond, in the expected manner, when given an appropriate developmental signal. Such a meristem is referred to as ‘determined’, if it follows the same developmental program even after it is removed from a source of environmental or biochemical stimulus. In some cases the ‘expression’ of flowering can be delayed until a second developmental signal is received. For instance, some species require a succession of two different photoperiods for successful evocation. Similarly, some species require a cold temperature treatment followed by a specific photoperiod for successful evocation. Often, floral induction and flower initiation have occurred, but flower development is interrupted. Such a suspension in flower development is, in some cases, referred to as ‘dormancy’. In most cases, a single or series of environmental\n\nFactors affecting flowering in ornamental plants\n\n9\n\ncues must occur for dormancy to be broken. Dormancy is common for flowering in spring-flowering woody species and ephemerals. The complexity of control mechanisms associated with flowering is enormous. It is amazing that flowering can occur at all, given the sensitivity of each step and the possibility for interruption during the flowering process which is significant. If a single factor is promotive, it is possible for flowering to be inhibited if other conditions are not met. Yet, plants have a significant redundancy incorporated into the flowering process to ensure that a number of cues can enable flowering to compensate for environmental fluctuations. The inherent redundancy in the flowering system as well as ways in which several environmental cues can result in the same flower induction is apparent in recent models.\n\n2.2\n\nAutonomous Regulation of Flowering\n\nOrganisms pass through a series of developmental phases during growth and maturation. Among animal species, developmental phase changes are ubiquitous throughout the organism. In contrast, among plants such phase changes take place only in the shoot apical meristem; flowering is only possible if a meristem is competent to flower and it receives an inductive signal. Whether a meristem is competent to flower is dependent on the phase, which the meristem is in. The transition between phases in development is referred to as ‘phase change’. A plant passes through three phases: the juvenile, adult vegetative (competent), and adult reproductive (determined) phases. The critical difference between the juvenile and adult phases is inherent in the ability of that meristem to successfully flower, which is only observed in the adult phases. The critical difference between the adult vegetative and adult reproductive phases are simply whether that meristem has or has not been evoked to flower or is determined. Whether a plant is competent or determined with respect to flowering can be evaluated using grafting experiments (McDaniel, et al., 1992). If a non-flowering scion is grafted onto an induced rootstock and the scion flowers, then the scion must have been competent to respond to the floral stimulus. In contrast, if the scion does not flower, it is not yet competent. If a scion is grafted onto a juvenile rootstock and the scion flowers regardless, it is likely to be determined. For instance, Betula verrucosa J.F. Ehrh. tissues derived from the base of the tree (juvenile) grafted onto a rootstock remain juvenile or vegetative, i.e. the scion was not competent to flower (Longman, 1976). In contrast, plant tissues collected from the top of the flowering tree (mature) were competent to flower after two years. It must be emphasized that the transition from juvenile to adult phases is a continuous process and not discontinuous. For instance, the ability to flower is a process and is transitional. Lunaria biennis L. (Wellensiek, 1958), Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera (Stokes and Verkerk, 1951), and Beta vulgaris (Wellensiek and Hakkaart, 1955) pass through a clear juvenile to adult phase transition, as\n\n10\n\nChapter 1\n\nevidenced by the increasing ability of cold temperatures to induce flowering as the plant ages rather than a sudden transition. Once a plant attains the adult phase, there is an increasing tendency to flower as the plant ages, regardless of inductive conditions. For instance, Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd. Ex Klotzsch ‘stock’, or ‘mother’, plants will produce numerous successive populations of vegetative cuttings, i.e. can have an extended adult vegetative phase. However, the percentage of poinsettia cuttings that spontaneously produce floral organs (cyathia) increases with each successive generation of cuttings. As the stock plant gets older, cuttings taken from a stock plant are more likely to flower even under non-inductive conditions (Siraj-Ali et al., 1990; Carver and Tayama, 1992). Similarly, the ability of celery (Apium graveolens var. dulce Pers.) plants to flower in response to a low temperature treatment increases as a plant grows older. This is evidenced by a shorter time for flower initiation and the number of days to anthesis after completion of a cold treatment (4 wks at 8°C) (Pawar and Thompson, 1950). The transition from juvenile to adult phases in woody plant and some herbaceous species can be accompanied by changes in morphology, phyllotaxy, thorniness, rooting capacity, and/or leaf retention, i.e. a phenotypic change. For instance, leaf arrangement in Antirrhinum majus L. changes from opposite during the juvenile phase to alternate during the adult phase. Leaf morphology changes dramatically in the aquatic plant Hippuris vulgaris (common marestail) as the plant transitions from a juvenile to an adult phase (Goliber and Feldman, 1989). Hedera helix L. rooting occurs readily when tissue is in the juvenile phase but is nearly ‘non-existent’ in adult phases (Poethig, 1990).Since there is a temporal order to the phase changes during plant development, there can be a spatial gradient in phases along a shoot. With some species in which the juvenile phase is relatively short, there may simply be a few juvenile structures at the base of the plant. In contrast, on species in which there is a prolonged juvenile period, a significant portion of the plant may be composed of juvenile structures. Meristematic regions then switch to adult phases and, as a result, the adult or reproductive structures are often located on the peripheral portions of a plant. This can be commonly observed in Fagus sylvatica L. and Quercus spp. where juvenility is associated with leaf retention during the winter and can be observed on the base of the tree. As many herbaceous or annual species do not exhibit a morphological or phenotypic change after transitioning from juvenile to adult phases, the phase change from juvenile to adult phase can be identified based on another developmental marker: the number of leaves that have unfolded since germination (since leaf number is a direct measure of a plant’s developmental age and is temperature dependent). For this reason, identification of competence to flower, based on leaf number, is commonly used as a general phase change indicator in commercial floriculture production (Dole and Wilkins, 1999).\n\nFactors affecting flowering in ornamental plants\n\n11\n\nOnce the adult phase is achieved, it is relatively stable. For instance, the juvenile or adult phase is maintained through vegetative propagation as well as grafting (Longman, 1976). For instance, H. helix cuttings taken from juvenile tissues will remain juvenile after propagation and vise versa (Poethig, 1990). However, in rare cases, non-optimal conditions and/or stress can cause rejuvenation, or reversion back to the juvenile phase. For instance, low irradiance conditions can resulting in reversion from an adult to juvenile phase. However, the incidence of such reversion decreases as the length of time since the transition from juvenile to the adult phase increases. It is also noted that sexual or apomictic reproduction will result in regeneration of the juvenile phase (Hackett, 1980). A number of factors affect the transition between phases in plants. Some of those factors that impact the transition from the juvenile phase to an adult phase are outlined below. In particular, the impact of species, meristem size and environmental factors are briefly mentioned.\n\n2.2.1\n\nSpecies\n\nWoody plant species vary considerably in the length of the juvenile phase (Table 1-1). In general, the ‘longer-lived’ a species is, the longer the juvenile phase. For instance, some nut-trees can have a 25-year juvenile period (Table 1-1), compared to a 4-month juvenile period (14 leaves) for some herbaceous perennial species (Table 1-2), or a 2-week (3-4 leaf) juvenile phase for some annuals (Table 1-2). In some cases, e.g. Raphanus sativus L., there is initially no juvenile phase as imbibed seed can be vernalized (Engelen-Eigles and Erwin, 1997) In contrast to woody plant species, many herbaceous species juvenile phase lengths are identified based on leaf number. However, the developmental time of the juvenile period differs with herbaceous species as with woody plants as shown in Table 2-2 (Cameron et al., 1996). Table 1-1. Juvenile phase length period differences between various woody plant species (adapted from Clark, 1983; Goh and Arditti, 1985). Common name Scientific name Juvenile length period (days or years) Rose Rosa x hybrida 20-30 days Grape Vitis spp. 1 year Orchids Cattleya, Cymbidium, 4-7 years Oncidium Apples Malus sylvestris 4-8 years Orange Citrus sinensis 5-8 years English ivy Hedera helix 5-10 years Redwood Sequoia sempervirens 5-15 years Sycamore maple Acer pseudoplatanus 15-20 years English oak Quercus robur 25-30 years European beech Fagus sylvatica 30-40 years\n\n12\n\nChapter 1\n\nTable 1-2. Juvenile period lengths (leaf number at which plants become competent to flower) for various herbaceous plants (adapted from Sheldron and Weiler, 1982; Whitman, 1995; Yuan, 1995).

There is an association between meristem size and the transition out of the juvenile phase. A plant may progress from juvenile to adult phases after the meristem increases beyond a minimum diameter meristem size which increases as leaf number increases. For instance, Dendranthema x grandiflora Tzvelv. (=Chrysanthemum x morifolium Ramat.) flower primordia are not initiated until after a minimum apex size has been attained (Cockshull, 1985). Similarly, Singer and McDaniel (1986) showed that tobacco plants produced 37 leaves from terminal buds prior to flowering. After numerous grafting experiments across tobacco cultivars, Singer and McDaniel (1986) concluded that the number of nodes a meristem produces prior to flowering was a function of the strength of the floral stimulus and the competence of the meristem to respond to that flowering signal. Pomologists have also noted that the passage of a tree out of the juvenile period may be associated with the attainment of a specific size (Visser and De Vries, 1970). However, more recent work has shown that phase change in Hedera helix is independent of meristem size (Hackett and Srinivasani, 1983). However, this assumption of an association between meristem size and phase transition excludes any involvement of meristematic size or carbohydrate status; the latter impacts leaf number below the flower or juvenile period phase length.\n\n2.2.3\n\nEnvironmental Conditions\n\nEnvironmental conditions that retard growth can delay the transition from juvenile to adult phases. For instance, as noted previously, exposure to low irradiance conditions can delay the transition from the juvenile to adult phase or cause reversion from the adult back to the juvenile phase. This association has led\n\nFactors affecting flowering in ornamental plants\n\n13\n\nresearchers to question the role of carbohydrate availability in the transition from juvenile to adult phase. Such assumptions are borne out by increasing irradiance, which can decrease the length of the juvenile phase developmentally in numerous herbaceous annuals. This is evidenced by a decrease in the leaf number below the first flower (see Irradiance section below). For example, the juvenile period length can be decreased as irradiance increases in Pelargonium x hortorum L. H. Bailey (Armitage and Tsujita, 1979). Similarly, numerous species juvenile period length can be reduced by addition of supplemental lighting (Mattson and Erwin, 2003a, b; Warner and Erwin, 2001b) or by providing conditions that promote growth (Poethig, 1990).\n\n2.3\n\nPhysiological Basis for Transition from Juvenile to Adult Phase\n\nThe physiological basis for the transition from juvenile to the adult phases is not well understood. Application of plant growth regulators can hasten or delay the transition from the juvenile to the adult phases or cause a reversion from the adult to the juvenile phase. For instance, application of gibberellins or gibberellic acids (GAs) to Cupressus arizonica Greene caused male cone formation (an indicator of the transition to adult phase) when plants were only two months old (Pharis and King, 1985). Similarly, other treatments that result in accumulation of endogenous GAs in conifers can reduce the juvenile phase length. In contrast to conifers, application of GAs to Hedera helix can cause a reversion from an adult to the juvenile phase (Hackett and Srinvasani, 1985). Application of Amo 1618 (a GA-synthesis inhibitor) was not able to cause a phase change from juvenile to adult in H. helix (Frydman and Wareing, 1974). However, ancymidol (a GA-synthesis inhibitor) prevented the spontaneous reversion to the juvenile state in low light in H. helix (Rogler and Hackett, 1975). Similar inhibition of transition from juvenile to adult phases following GA application has been noted on Citrus (Cooper and Peynado, 1958), deciduous fruit trees (Luckwill, 1970), and Ipomoea caerula L. (Njoku, 1958).\n\n3.\n\nEXTERNAL REGULATION OF FLOWERING\n\nThere are four primary external environmental cues that affect flowering in plants: photoperiod, temperature, irradiance, and stress (fire, water levels). In addition, lack of stress or supra-optimal levels of nutrients or saturating water levels can also impact progression towards flowering. Of these environmental queues, photoperiod, temperature, and the presence of water, in particular, allow plants to synchronize flowering with the seasons. Fire can be an indicator of seasonal\n\n14\n\nChapter 1\n\ntransition but is less precise. In general, horticultural manipulation of flowering involves control of photoperiod, temperature, and/or irradiance. When photoperiod (the duration of light/darkness) impacts flowering, a plant is said to be ‘photoperiodic’. Photoperiodism is primarily associated with longerlived species that survive for at least one growing season. Development of such species can often depend on photoperiod to synchronize flowering to ensure that flowering occurs at a specific time of year for cross pollination, successful seed set, and seed maturation. In contrast to photoperiodism, prolonged exposure to temperatures between 0 and 16°C can also synchronize flowering. For example, flowering in biennial and perennial species will often have a cool temperature requirement (2-4°C) for successful flower induction (often 6-12 weeks). Such low temperature induction of flowering is referred to as ‘vernalization’. Presumably, a vernalization requirement ensures a plant will not flower until after winter has occurred in temperate climates. Further, some species exhibit a dual requirement for successful flowering, i.e. they may require a prescribed sequence of inductive conditions such as short dayslong days (SD-LD) or LD-SD. In some cases, e.g. many perennial species in temperate climates, a plant may have a vernalization requirement followed by a LD requirement. Daylength and vernalization can act synergistically as in the case of Lilium longiflorum or Anethum graveolens L. ‘Florida’ (Pressman and Negbi, 1980). A number of other environmental factors such as irradiance, light quality, and/or water stress can impact flowering and/or interact with vernalization and/or photoperiodic induction. These factors appear to be more associated with conditions, which are optimal for flowering under inductive conditions (growth), rather than the inductive process itself. For instance, low irradiance can decrease flowering of the day-neutral Rosa x hybrida L. by increasing the occurrence of ‘blind’ shoots, i.e. aborted flowers (Nell and Rasmussen, 1979). In contrast, high irradiance can substitute for a photoperiod requirement entirely in Hibiscus moscheutos L. (Warner and Erwin, 2003). Additionally, high temperatures can inhibit flowering induced by photoperiod or vernalization. The following sections elaborate on the primary environmental cues for flowering and the physiological bases for each response.\n\n3.1\n\nPhotoperiodism\n\nPhotoperiodism refers to the ability of an organism to detect daylength (or more correctly night length). Photoperiodic events can be observed in animals and plants. In animals, hibernation, egg laying, and migration are all controlled by photoperiod. In plants, photoperiodism can regulate growth processes as different as flowering, tuber formation, the onset of dormancy, and rhizome formation. Wightman Garner and Henry Allard initially discovered photoperiodic control of flowering at the U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratories in Beltsville, Maryland\n\nFactors affecting flowering in ornamental plants\n\n15\n\nin the 1920s. Garner and Allard (1920) noted that a mutant cultivar of tobacco (‘Maryland Mammoth’) did not flower in the field during the summer but flowered in the greenhouse during the winter. They subsequently covered outdoor field grown plants during the summer with black cloth to artificially shorten the daylength; this treatment resulted in flowering plants. Garner and Allard (1920) concluded that day length controlled when plants flower. Photoperiodism was not applied in the commercial floriculture industry until the 1930s-1950s when Gus Poesch noted that street lights outside of a chrysanthemum facility inhibited flowering (Poesch, pers. comm.). The recognition of the importance of daylength in that chrysanthemum facility resulted in the application of photoperiod manipulation in greenhouse production. This resulted in a year-round flowering chrysanthemum industry, as well as extended flowering seasons for many other potted plants and cut flowers (Poesch, 1931). The application of photoperiod to bedding plant production is in its infancy and is a primary focus of the author’s research program at the University of Minnesota.\n\n3.1.1\n\nPhotoperiodic Response Groups\n\nPhotoperiodic flowering responses can be divided into several different response groups: short-day plants, long-day plants, day-neutral plants, intermediate-day plants and ambiphotoperiodic plants (Thomas and Vince-Prue, 1997). The specific characteristics of each group are outlined below: Short-Day Plants – those species in which the night length (duration) must be greater than some critical length. Generally species from lower latitudes (i.e. the flowering of coffee, cotton, and rice) or species which flower in the late summer, such as chrysanthemum (Cockshull, 1984). Long-Day Plants – those species in which night length must be shorter than some critical length. Generally species from high latitudes such as temperate grasses (Deitzer, 1984). Day-Neutral Plants – flower induction is not affected by night length. Usually species with a wide latitudinal distribution, such as potato and tomato (Halevy, 1984) Intermediate-Day Plants – those species that require a night length between 12 and 14 hours. Ambiphotoperiodic-Day Plants – those species in which flower induction occurs under long or short nights but not intermediate nights\n\n16 3.1.2\n\nChapter 1 Subdivision Within Response Groups\n\nWithin short- and long-day plant groups, there are plants that have a facultative (quantitative) or obligate (qualitative) responses. Species that exhibit a ‘facultative’ or quantitative response will flower under any photoperiod. However, in such taxa flowering is hastened under the prescribed photoperiod. In contrast, species that exhibit an obligate or qualitative response will not flower unless they receive the prescribed photoperiod. Examples of common herbaceous annual species and their corresponding photoperiodic classifications are shown in Table 1-3. Species within genera can vary widely in their photoperiodic requirement. For instance, Warner and Erwin (2003b) showed that all photoperiodic response groups were evident in a group of Hibiscus spp. studied. In addition, early work by Cumming (1969) showed that Chenopodium rubrum L. strains collected from different latitudes possessed a wide range of photoperiodic requirements for flowering. Table 1-3. Photoperiodic and irradiance classifications of herbaceous annual floriculture crops (flowers, herbs, vegetables), based on mean leaf number below the first open flower (Armitage, 1996; Dole and Wilkins, 1999, Erwin and Warner, 2002; Motum and Goodwin, 1987a, b; Nordwig, 1999; Mattson and Erwin 2003a, b; Seeley, 1985; Zanin and Erwin, 2003). Photoperiod classifications: FSDP (facultative short-day plant); FLDP (facultative long-day plant); OSDP (obligate short-day plant) OLDP (obligate long-day plant); DNP (day neutral plant). Irradiance classifications: ‘FI’ (facultative irradiance response: supplemental irradiance hastened induction developmentally); ‘II’ (irradiance indifferent response; increasing irradiance did not hasten flowering developmentally) (Erwin and Warner, 2002; Mattson and Erwin, 2003a, b). A question mark identifies an uncertain photoperiodic classification.

Shillo (1976) showed that flowering of Limonium sinuatum Mill. was delayed six weeks and leaf number below the first flower was increased when plants were grown under ambient light (10-12 hr photoperiod) vs. ambient light plus a 4 hr night interruption with incandescent lights. Limonium sinuatum was found to be a facultative long-day plant (Table 1-3). Eschscholtzia californica Cham. only flowered when grown under 9 hr ambient light plus a 4 hr night interruption (3-4 µmol m-2 s-1 from incandescent lamps). Thus, Lyons and Booze-Daniels (1986) classified E. californica as an obligate long-day plant. Keatinge et al. (1998) noted that Dolichos lablab L. flowered after 69 and 172 d when grown under short- (11.5 hr) and long- (14.5 hr) day photoperiods, respectively (leaf number below the first flower not reported); D. lablab was classified as a facultative short-day plant. Armitage and Garner (1999) showed Catananche caerulea L. Per. was an obligate long-day plant, flowering after 164 d when grown under long days, but did not flower when grown under short days. Recent screening experiments have resulted in the characterization of >50 commercial floriculture or herb species into photoperiodic response groups (Table 1-3; Erwin and Warner, 2002, Mattson and Erwin, 2003a, b). Flowering response to photoperiod can vary with cultivar. For example, Ross and Murfet (1985) describe three flowering classes of Lathyrus odoratus L.: a dayneutral (winter) flowering group, and long-day groups exhibiting a facultative (spring) or obligate (summer) long-day response. Such variation in photoperiodic responses among cultivars is also obvious in Salvia splendens and Petunia x hybrida\n\n20\n\nChapter 1\n\ncultivars (Erwin, unpublished data; Table 1-3). In particular, the introduction of new germplasm (often wild in origin) can often increase the photoperiod requirement of nearly day-neutral existing cultivars. Perhaps the most obvious recent example is the increase in long-day requirement within P. x hybrida with the introduction of the ‘Wave’ and ‘Fantasy’ series of petunias in recent years (Erwin, unpublished data; Erwin et al., 1997).\n\n3.1.4\n\nLength of Inductive Conditions Required for Flower Induction\n\nThe length of time for complete flower induction varies with plant age, temperature, and irradiance. Flowering tendency increases as a plant ages, regardless of whether it is in inductive conditions or not. Evidence of this is seen when cuttings are harvested from poinsettias (Euphorbia pulcherrima). Cuttings have a greater and greater proportion that exhibit ‘splitting’, a condition where buds initiate but do not develop fully (Siraj-Ali et al., 1990; Carver and Tayama, 1992) as the stock or mother plant age increases. Similarly, there is an inverse relationship between plant age and the number of short days required for complete flower induction with Pharbitis nil Chois. In addition to the natural tendency of a plant to eventually flower, the number of inductive cycles required for complete induction will often vary with the age of a plant. For instance, the time for complete induction in Lolium temulentum (darnel ryegrass) decreases from 4 LD cycles on plants with 2-3 leaves to 1 LD cycle on plants with 6-7 leaves (Taiz and Zeiger, 1998). Similarly, Petunia x hybrida ‘Purple Wave’ required 24 LD to flower when 10 days old and 18 LD to flower when 24 days old (Mattson, 2002). These observations suggest that the effect of photoperiod may be to accelerate a process that is already occurring at a slow pace even under non-inductive conditions. Although there is no exact number of inductive cycles, an estimate of time to completely induce a plant to flower is important for commercial production. For instance, an understanding of the time required to induce a floriculture crop to flower can identify how long a plant must stay under conditions with supplemental lighting or short days with a blackout curtain before it can be moved to noninductive conditions. To this end, there are several general observations and estimates. Many species appear to require approximately 21 days for complete induction when grown at 16-20°C. For example, complete flower induction in Begonia x hiemalis requires 2-3 weeks (Karlsson and Heins, 1992). In some cases, flower induction and initiation can be achieved in 14 days, however, flower development may not be successful. Similarly, flowering of P. x hybrida ‘Purple Wave’ occurs when plants are exposed to 20 LD at 20°C and natural daylight conditions (45° N lat., St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.A.) (Mattson, 2002). The length of time required for complete flower induction can vary with temperature and irradiance. In general, the time required for complete induction and\n\nFactors affecting flowering in ornamental plants\n\n21\n\ninitiation increases as temperature decreases and as irradiance decreases. (Zrebiec and Tayama, 1990; Mattson, 2002).\n\n3.1.5\n\nInteraction of Photoperiodic Induction with Temperature\n\nPhotoperiod can interact with temperature to affect flowering. It is common for some plant species to be photoperiodic at higher temperatures but exhibit a dayneutral response at lower temperatures. For instance, Begonia x hiemalis Fotsch is an obligate short-day plant at temperatures greater than 24°C (Sandved, 1969). In contrast B. x hiemalis is a facultative SDP at temperatures >24°C but a DNP at temperatures lower than 24°C. Similarly, Calceolaria herbeohybrida Cav. Stout (a facultative LDP) flower induction will occur under SD conditions (Poesch, 1931). The critical daylength of Campanula isophylla Moretti. is 14 hours with temperatures of 15-21°C, however, it increases to 15 hours when temperatures exceed 21°C (Heide, 1965). In most cases, this is due to an increase in the critical photoperiod required for flower induction (Heide and Runger, 1985). It is also common with many SDP to exhibit delayed flowering under inductive SD conditions when night temperature exceeds 22°C. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as ‘heat delay’ in the commercial floriculture industry. High night temperature inhibition of flowering has been studied extensively with E. pulcherrima and Dendranthema x grandiflora (SDP). In addition to these species, Gomphrena globosa L. exhibits a heat delay when night temperature is 25°C (Warner et al., 1997). In general, there is evidence that as night temperature increases above 22°C that the length of an inductive long night for successful flowering increases. Therefore, heat delay can be overcome in some cases by providing a longer night to SDP grown with night temperatures higher than 22°C.\n\n3.2\n\nThe Physiological Basis for Photoperiodism\n\nPlants perceive daylength by ‘measuring’ the night length. Short-day plants are determined by the length of the night, regardless of the daylength. Similarly, LDP also measure night length and only flower when the length of the night is less than some critical night length regardless of the length of the photoperiod. The importance of the night length in determination of photoperiodic responses with respect to flowering was demonstrated by early experiments by Hamner and Bonner (1938) and Hamner (1940) where flowering of Xanthium strumarium and Glycine max (L.) Merrill only occurred when the night length exceeded 8.5 and 10 hours, respectively. Night break lighting of as little as a few minutes in X. strumarium or Pharbitis nil (both SDP) prevented flowering even when the total night length was sufficient to promote flowering. Similarly, night break lighting can result in stimulation of flowering in LDP even when night length is inhibitory to such flowering. In general, the length of time of a night break required to inhibit\n\n22\n\nChapter 1\n\nflowering in SDP is considerably less than the time required to promote flowering in LDP. The point at which a night break occurs greatly impacts the effectiveness of that break in either promoting or inhibiting flowering. In general, SDP and LDP are most sensitive to receiving a night interruption eight hours after the onset of darkness (Vince-Prue, 1975; Salisbury, 1963; Papenfuss and Salisbury, 1967). Harder and Bode (1943) showed that inhibition of Kalanchoe blossfeldiana flowering by light was most effective when the night interruption occurred between 5-7 hours after the onset of darkness. In contrast, Salisbury and Bonner (1956) showed that X. strumarium was most sensitive to night interruption lighting eight hours after the onset of darkness. This observation is the basis for the commercial practice of interrupting the night from 10 pm to 2 am (2200-0200 HR) with low intensity lighting. Such an interruption is long enough to achieve a desired promotive or inhibitory effect and is delivered at the critical time of the night. The observation of night interruption lighting led to the development of an action spectra for photoperiodism. Different wavelengths of light varied in their ability to inhibit flowering of the SDP X. strumarium (Hendricks and Borthwick, 1954). Red light (640-660 nm) was shown to be most effective in inhibiting flowering. Perhaps most significant was the observation that the night-break action spectra for inhibition of flowering in SDP (Glycine and Xanthium) was similar to that for stimulation of flowering in LDP (Hordeum vulgare and H. niger) indicating a similar pigment as a photoreceptor (Borthwick et al., 1948). Interestingly, species can differ in the ‘mixture’ of light that is optimal for stimulation or inhibition of flowering. Whereas many SDP are most sensitive to red light (660 nm), stimulation of flowering in some LDP by a night interruption is increased when there is a mix of both red and far red light. It is for this reason that induction of flowering in the LDP Fuchsia x hybrida requires a light source that contains both red and far red light (incandescent lamps and non-fluorescent lamps). The observation that light delivered in the middle of the night inhibited flowering of tobacco (a SDP), led to the discovery of phytochrome. Borthwick et al. (1952) showed that red light was the primary color of light which inhibited flowering when delivered as a night break. In contrast, a subsequent exposure to far red light restores the flowering response and suggested a photoconversion process (Downs, 1956). Action spectra of the inhibition of flowering and an action spectra for reversal of inhibition identified a peak at 660nm and 720-740nm, respectively (Saji et al., 1983). There is also evidence for the involvement of a blue light receptor although these data are not as clear as with phytochrome involvement (Millar et al., 1995; Hicks et al., 1996; Zagotta et al., 1996). Subsequent to this work was the significant finding that the red light inhibition of flowering was reversible by far red light (720 nm). Hendricks et al. (1956) demonstrated that red/far red light effects were reversible. This reversibility was\n\nFactors affecting flowering in ornamental plants\n\n23\n\nlikely a result of two forms of a pigment: a red and far red light absorbing form. The pigment was named phytochrome (Butler et al., 1959). The variation in sensitivity of plants during the dark period to a night interruption lighting is not well understood. Bunning (1948) suggested that plants exhibit diurnal cycles between a photophile and skotophile phase. The photophile phase was light sensitive and the skotophile phase was not. Carr (1952) subsequently showed that the effectiveness of night interruption lighting in inhibiting flowering followed a periodic 24 hour rhythm when the night was extended. Important to such a time keeping mechanism is the observation that this rhythmicity is mostly temperature independent (Bunning, 1963; Takimoto and Hamner, 1964). It is important to note that the effectiveness of night interruption lighting in inhibiting flowering of SDP is affected by temperature. The effectiveness of a red light night interruption decreases as temperature increases from 18.5 to 25°C (Takimoto and Hamner, 1964). In addition, the length of night required to stimulate flowering in SDP is altered by temperature. The degree to which temperature affects this required night length for flower induction in SDP is species specific (Salisbury and Ross, 1969). In addition, those plants that are sensitive to high temperatures in the night are most sensitive 8 hours after the onset of darkness.\n\n3.3\n\nPhotoperiodic Stimulus\n\nThe photoperiodic stimulus is perceived in the leaves. When a single leaf of X. strumarium is exposed to short days and the rest of the plant is grown under long days, the plant will flower (Hamner and Bonner, 1938). Similarly, in a classic study by Zeevaart (1969), a single excised leaf of Perilla crispa (L.) Britt. exposed to short-day conditions was capable of repeatedly causing plants grown under long days to flower after being grafted to those plants. Interestingly, stimulation of flowering occurred even with a day-neutral plant when a single leaf of Glycine max ‘Agate’ was grafted onto the short-day G. max ‘Biloxi’. Flowering was induced in ‘Biloxi’ even when grown under long days (Heinze et al., 1942). Also, leaves that were induced indirectly via grafting experiments can themselves also be donors and result in flowering of non-induced plants (Lona, 1946; Zeevaart and Lang, 1962; Wellensiek, 1966). Studies by Handro (1977) demonstrated that only Streptocarpus nobilis L. tissues derived from leaf tissue were capable of flowering in vitro under inductive conditions. The degree to which an induced leaf can induce a non-induced donor plant to flower can vary with species and the degree to which the leaf has been induced. Xanthium strumarium leaves will remain induced for a few days and are competent in inducing plants to which they are grafted (Carr, 1959). Imamura (1953) showed that a Pharbitis nil leaf also was also induced for a few days following a single inductive night but could remain in an induced state for many days when the leaves\n\n24\n\nChapter 1\n\nreceived numerous SD compared to one. Similarly, P. crispa leaves could be inductive for a few days or many months depending on the number of inductive short-days received prior to removal from the donor plant (Zeevaart, 1957). Grafting between species in a different photoperiodic class showed the stimulus to be similar across species. For instance, grafting LDP Hyoscyamus niger L. to SDP Nicotiana tabacum L. caused the SDP to flower (Melchers and Lang, 1941). Although more difficult, pairing a flowering SDP to a LDP has induced flowering in the LDP (Lang and Melchers, 1943; Zeevaart, 1957). In addition, flowering of parasites such as dodder can be stimulated when it is parasitizing flowering plants from any photoperiodic class (Frattianne, 1965). Together, the grafting experiments suggest the existence of a mobile flowering promoter, which is produced by induced leaves. The term used to describe this promoter is ‘florigen’. Although considerable effort has been spent trying to identify the nature of florigen, it remains unknown. In contrast to the theory that photoperiodism is associated with a floral promoter, there is evidence that photoperiod can affect the synthesis of a floral inhibitor. Removal of all leaves of the LDP Helleborus niger resulted in flowering suggesting that the leaves produced an inhibitor and photoperiod (LD) acted to depress the synthesis of that inhibitor during LD (Lang and Melchers, 1943). Guttridge (1959) was able to show a similar induction of flowering following leaf removal on the SDP strawberry (Fragaria). Leaves from a photoperiodic tobacco (non-inductive conditions) are capable of inhibiting flowering of a day-neutral tobacco cultivar (Lang et al., 1977). Wellensiek (1959) identified an association between the day length and degree of inhibition in SDP. Supportive of the flowering inhibitor concept is the observation that reduced irradiance during the day (Krumweide, 1960) or low temperatures (Wellensiek, 1959; Ogawa, 1960; de Zeeuw, 1957) can promote flowering under non-inductive photoperiods. However, this contradicts more recent work when higher irradiance levels overcome a LD requirement in H. moscheutos when grown under SD conditions (Warner and Erwin, 2003b). Regardless of whether there is a chemical promoter/inhibitor, this substance is believed to be transferred in the phloem. Imamura and Takimoto (1955) estimated the timing of the flowering stimulus by developing a two-branched Pharbitis nil system and identifying the node at which flowering was induced. Subsequent experiments showed translocation of the compound from the leaf to a receptive bud is comparable or somewhat slower than that for the translocation of sugars (2-4 mm h-1) (Evans and Wardlaw, 1966; King et al., 1968). Of all the known plant growth regulators, there is evidence that a promoter/inhibitor of flowering is associated with gibberellins. A 100 ppm application of GA3 to a facultative SDP Cosmos was able to substitute for SD when plants were grown under an 18 hour photoperiod (Wittwer and Bukovac, 1959). Lolium temulentum plants are committed to flower after exposure to a single long\n\nFactors affecting flowering in ornamental plants\n\n25\n\nday (plants will not flower under SD). Excised terminal meristems exposed to a single long day will flower in tissue culture in the presence of GAs. Short-dayexposed meristems in tissue culture will not flower in the presence of GAs. Therefore, long days are required for determination of Lolium temulentum L., and GAs are required for the expression of the determined state (McDaniels and Harnett, 1996).\n\n4.\n\nVERNALIZATION\n\nVernalization is the low temperature induction of flowering in an imbibed seed or a growing plant (Chouard, 1960; Taiz and Zeiger, 1998). As with photoperiodism, plants must advance through the juvenile stage into an adult stage before they have the capacity to perceive a vernalization treatment. The length of time required for this varies. Winter annuals have the capacity to perceive a vernalization treatment as an imbibed seed. Raphanus sativus similarly has the capacity to perceive a vernalization treatment as an imbibed seed. Plants can be vernalized with a wide range of temperatures. In general, vernalization can occur at temperatures ranging from -6 to 14°C (Chouard, 1960). There is an optimal temperature range from 6-10°C for most species (Lang, 1959; Chouard, 1960). Still other studies show that plants can be vernalized at temperatures between 5 and 17°C. However, the length of time that plants must be exposed to cool temperatures increases as the temperature deviates from the common optimum of 4°C. The time required for complete vernalization varies with species as well. For instance, Lunaria biennis L. requires nine weeks (Wellensiek, 1958); Apium graveolens L. (celery) and Secale cereale L. (winter rye) require six weeks (Ramin and Atherton, 1991; Friend, 1965), respectively. Alstroemeria L. hybrids commonly require six weeks at 5°C (Healy and Wilkins, 1981, 1982). In contrast, vernalization time can be as short as 6-8 days for R. sativus ‘Chinese Jumbo Radish Scarlet’ (Englen-Eigles and Erwin, 1997; Erwin et al., 2002). Some species exhibit sensitivity to vernalization immediately after seed is imbibed; a subsequent period of temperature insensitivity is followed by a period of increasing sensitivity to low temperature induction (Napp-Zinn, 1969). The length of time required for vernalization is related to whether a species has an obligate or facultative vernalization requirement. Plants that require a short vernalization period (2 days at 25C\n\n4.3\n\nPhotoperiod Interactions\n\nPhotoperiod interacts with vernalization to affect flower induction (Yui and Yoshikawa, 1991; Thomas and Vince-Prue, 1997; Yeh et al., 1997). In some cases, as with winter cereals, short day conditions substitute for vernalization entirely. For instance, Coreopsis grandiflora Hogg ex Sweet. Per. is a SDP-LDP plant; however, the short day requirement can be substituted with a vernalization treatment (Ketellapper and Barbaro, 1966). In contrast, long day conditions are additive with vernalization in hastening flower initiation of some species, including L. longiflorum (Wilkins, et al., 1968). In addition, thermoinduction affects photoperiodic requirements after vernalization (Thomas and Vince-Prue, 1997). Most cold requiring plants require long-day conditions after cooling. The number of long days required/the critical daylength required for flowering after vernalization decreases as the length of the vernalization treatment increases (Lang, 1965).\n\n4.3.1\n\nIrradiance & Light Quality Interactions\n\nIrradiance during vernalization is critical with some species. For instance, Apium graveolens does not perceive vernalizing temperatures unless plants are exposed to light during the vernalization process (Ramin and Atherton, 1994). Similarly, Dianthus caryophyllus L. and Ajuga reptans L. flowering was hastened as the irradiance during vernalization increased (Elzroth and Link, 1970).\n\n28\n\nChapter 1\n\nRecent research demonstrates that a low red:far red light ratio is antagonistic to vernalization of R. sativus (Engelen-Eigles, 1996) and Lilium longiflorum (Erwin and Engelen-Eigles, unpublished data). In contrast, a high red:far red ratio appears to hasten vernalization. For instance, L. longiflorum plants were completely induced by a vernalization treatment in 4 weeks when bulbs were exposed to light with a high red:far red ratio but were not completely induced until after 8 weeks when bulbs were exposed to light with a low red:far red ratio.\n\n4.4\n\nStage of Sensitivity to Vernalization\n\nThe point at which a plant becomes sensitive to a vernalization treatment or the length of the juvenile period varies with species. Some species can be vernalized as imbibed seed. For instance, Beta vulgaris, Oenothera (Thomas and Vince-Prue, 1997) and Raphanus sativus (Englen-Eigles and Erwin, 1997) can be vernalized as imbibed seed. In contrast, most plants must reach a specific stage of development before the meristem is capable of responding to vernalizing temperatures. Helleborus niger must grow for ten days and L. biennis must grow for seven weeks before plants will respond to a vernalization treatment (Thomas and Vince-Prue, 1997). Daucus carota ‘Chantenay Red Cored’ required 8-12 leaves before plants were capable of responding to vernalizing temperatures (Atherton et al., 1990). Similarly, many herbaceous perennial species have a minimum leaf requirement (often >10) before plants can successfully induce flowering in response to a vernalization treatment (Lopes and Weiler, 1977; Sheldron and Weiler, 1982a, b; Iverson and Weiler, 1994; Armitage et al., 1996; Whitman et al., 1996). In addition to variation among species, variation in sensitivity among cultivars of a given species in leaf number required to achieve a mature state and in the required length of the vernalization treatment to induce flowering also exists (Yui and Yoshikawa, 1991; Wurr et al., 1994, Englen-Eigles and Erwin, 1997).\n\n4.5\n\nStability of the Vernalization Process\n\nThe vernalization process, once saturated, can be very stable (Table 4) (Yeh et al., 1997). For instance, once Hyoscyamus is vernalized (requires both vernalization and long-days for flowering), the vernalized state can persist for several months under short day conditions: flowering occurs when plants are returned to long day conditions (Thomas and Vince-Prue, 1997). Lilium longiflorum bulbs exposed to vernalizing temperatures retained that information even when several warm temperature periods occurred prior to the completion of a vernalization treatment (Erwin and Engelen-Eigles, 1997). No loss of the vernalization stimulus was evident on henbane after 190 days. In fact, there was no measurable loss in degree of vernalization until 300 days had passed (Thomas and Vince-Prue, 1997). Similarly, some cereal seeds can be moistened, vernalized, and then re-dried and\n\nFactors affecting flowering in ornamental plants\n\n29\n\nmaintained for months without loss of the vernalization status (Purvis and Gregory, 1952).\n\n4.6\n\nPhysiological Basis for Vernalization\n\nEarly work on the physiology of vernalization focused on the identification of a specific cold-induced, gibberellin responsible for flowering (Lang, 1965). Gibberellins are known to interact with vernalization to affect flowering of a number of species (Metzger and Dusbabek, 1991). Application of GAs to certain biennial species, including wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana grown under unfavorable conditions for flowering, promotes flower formation and bolting (Lang, 1957; Zeevaart, 1983). Conversely, application of 2-chloroethyltrimethylammonium chloride (CCC – Cycocel), a GA synthesis inhibitor, delayed flowering in several wild-type A. thaliana lines and suggested that the presence of GA is essential for direct flower induction (Napp-Zinn, 1985). Although exogenous applications of specific gibberellins can overcome a coldrequirement for flowering of some species, these applications are successful on some species and not others (Ketellapper and Barbaro, 1966). It has been proposed that the vernalization process is associated with a progressive demethylation of DNA. Demethylation of DNA is believed to remove a block in gene expression that ultimately leads to floral initiation. Evidence for this theory is based on effects of exogenous ‘demethylators’ on flower induction and changes in the degree of demethylation of DNA during cooling. For example, application of 5-azacytidine, a demethylator, promoted flowering of non-vernalized cold requiring Thlaspi and A. thaliana (Metzger, 1996). In addition, vernalizing temperatures result in demethylation of plant DNA (Burn et al., 1993). Transformed A. thaliana that have reduced levels of DNA methylation because of the presence of a methyltransferase (METI) antisense gene flowered earlier than untransformed control plants (Finnegan et al., 1998). However, a 70% reduction of methylation occurred in antisense plants where the promotion of flowering was comparable to that of a vernalization treatment that resulted in only a 15% decrease in DNA methylation. These data suggest that other methyltransferases may be affected by vernalization, since METI only affected one.\n\n5.\n\nIRRADIANCE INDUCTION OF FLOWERING\n\nIn general, increased irradiance reduces the length of the juvenile period with many plant species. In contrast, low irradiance can extend the length of the juvenile period with some species. Irradiance reduction of the juvenile period is the basis for the common practice of lighting seed geraniums for earlier flower induction where\n\n30\n\nChapter 1\n\nthe general ‘rule-of-thumb’ is that every day those seedlings are lighted with supplemental light results in a single day decrease in time to flower. In addition to photoperiod, irradiance can affect earliness of flowering of many species (Armitage and Tsujita, 1979; Armitage et al., 1981; Dole and Wilkins, 1999; Erwin et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1996). For instance, Achillea millefolium L. ‘Summer Pastels’ grown under a 16 hr photoperiod in growth chambers flowered after 57, 45, and 37 d when grown under 100, 200, or 300 µmol m-2 s-1, respectively (plant temperature and leaf number below the first flower not reported) (Zhang et al., 1996). An increase in mean dry weight gain per day (MDWG) from 0.32 to 1.02 g d-1 occurred as irradiance increased from 100 to 300 µmol m-2 s-1 in A. millefolium (Zhang et al., 1996). Armitage and Tsujita (1979) grew four Pelargonium x hortorum Bailey cultivars under natural daylight conditions (Feb-Mar 1977, Guelph, Ontario, Canada) plus supplemental HPS and LPS lighting (27 or 54 µmol m-2 s-1). Irradiance from high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps (27 µmol m-2 s-1) hastened flowering for some cultivars but not others, suggesting that P. x hortorum cultivars flowering responses to supplemental HPS lighting varied. Asclepias curassavica L. node number below the inflorescence decreased from 21 to 16 nodes when plants were grown under continuous lighting versus night interruption lighting (Nordwig, 1999). However, it is often unclear whether irradiance effects are a result of a hastening of flowering strictly through infrared heating from supplemental lighting or from a reduction in juvenile period length as determined through leaf number data. More recent studies on irradiance effects on flowering have sought to distinguish between thermal hastening of flowering versus developmental hastening of flowering. Erwin et al. (1997) showed supplemental lighting hastened flowering developmentally in Viola x wittrockiana and P. x hybrida. For example, P. x hybrida ‘Fantasy Pink Morn’ flowered in as little as 28 d after germination when grown at constant 24 ºC under 8-9 hr ambient daylight conditions (St. Paul, Minn) plus continuous 100 µmol m-2 s-1 HPS lighting. Similarly, Adams et al. (1999) showed P. x hybrida flowering was hastened by long days, but that decreased daily light integrals (DLI) lengthened the time to flowering. Pearson et al. (1993) also noted that increasing DLI shortened the time to anthesis for Dendranthema x grandiflora. Further, the reduction in time to flower was related to DLI rather than to maximum light intensity. Erwin and Warner (2002) reported that 11 species flowered earlier developmentally, when plants were grown with ambient light (10-14 hr photoperiod, Sep 1999-May 2000, St. Paul, Minn.) plus 25-50 µmol m-2 s-1 HPS lighting for up to 18 hrs daily. Hedley (1974) showed that A. majus ‘Orchid Rocket’ flowering was hastened developmentally (leaf number below the flower decreased from 80 to 34 leaves) under long-day conditions as irradiance increased from 115 to 500 umol m-2 s-1. We have ‘coined’ the term ‘facultative irradiance response’ to describe a developmental hastening of flowering by addition of supplemental lighting. Species\n\nFactors affecting flowering in ornamental plants\n\n31\n\nthat exhibit a facultative irradiance response (FI) will show a decrease in leaf number below the first flower as irradiance increases (Erwin and Warner, 2002). The increased irradiance is capable of reducing the length of the juvenile period. In contrast, we refer to plants that do not have hastened flowering, developmentally, in response to increased irradiance as ‘irradiance indifferent’ (Erwin and Warner, 2002). With these species, increased irradiance does not reduce leaf number below the first flower, i.e. juvenile period length is not reduced developmentally with additional lighting. Some species exhibiting a facultative irradiance response include: Convolvulus, Dianthus, Gazania, Lavatera, Limnanthes, Linaria, Nemophila, Nicotiana, oregano, Silene, snapdragon, petunia, pansy, seed geranium. Some species with a neutral irradiance response include: Ageratum, Celosia, Cleome, Cosmos, Gomphrena, Statice, Lobelia, Mimulus, Nigella, Salvia, Tithonia, Zinnia. The majority of species studied here did not flower earlier developmentally with increasing irradiance (Table 1-3; Warner and Erwin, 2002; Mattson and Erwin, 2003a, b). Erickson et al. (1980) found a linear relationship between DLI and the DTF for P. x hortorum until a threshold level between 6.89 and 9.01 µmol m-2 d-1 was reached (leaf number not reported). Fausey et al. (2001) noted that 100% flowering of Digitalis purpurea L. ‘Foxy’ was only reached with DLI greater than 11 µmol m-2 d-1. Supplemental irradiance (at 30, 60, and 90 µmol m-2 s-1) on Gerbera jamesonii H. Bolus hastened flowering by up to 23 d in the winter, but only up to 11 days during the spring (leaf number below the first flower not reported) (Gagnon and Dansereau, 1990). Thus, the impact of supplemental irradiance on flowering can be dependent on ambient light conditions. In our experiment, average DLI’s (Table 1-2) under all lighting treatments were greater than the threshold levels found by Erickson et al. (1980) and Fausey et al. (2001). It is likely that the light saturation point for impact on flower induction was reached under the lowest irradiance treatments for many of the species during the relatively high natural light conditions of spring in Minnesota. The five species identified as having a FI response represent plants that likely have a higher threshold of light than other species. The hastening of flowering with exposure to supplemental irradiance is likely due to two components: increased plant temperature from infrared and long-wave radiation from the HPS lamps and additional light available for photosynthesis. More research is needed to determine if FI responses seen on some species are a result of increased photosynthesis or a photomorphogenetic high irradiance response (Beggs et al., 1980). In our experiment, ADT at plant level was 1-2°C greater under the highest lighting treatments (data not shown). Faust and Heins (1998) reported that supplemental irradiance increased shoot-tip temperatures of Catharanthus roseus L. by 1.2, 1.5, and 1.7 ºC with HPS light additions of 50, 75, and 100 µmol m-2 s-1, respectively. Pietsch et al. (1995) concluded that increased development rates of Catharanthus roseus under supplemental light were a result of increased\n\n32\n\nChapter 1\n\nshoot-tip temperatures. Graper and Healy (1991) conducted an experiment to separate the components of HPS lighting into the effects of thermal radiation vs. photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) using a circulating water bath. They concluded that light plays a greater role in development of Petunia x hybrida seedlings via greater photosynthesis than the increase in plant temperature associated with supplemental HPS lighting. Leaf number below the first flower was not reported. Clearly, controlled environment chamber experiments where lighting conditions can be precisely controlled are necessary to more accurately evaluate the effect of irradiance on herbaceous ornamental plant species flower induction. Determining the threshold levels of irradiance required for optimal growth and impact on flower induction of herbaceous ornamental plant species would be useful information for growers deciding whether to purchase supplemental lighting.\n\n6.\n\nSTRESS INDUCTION OF FLOWERING\n\nShort-term plant stress will cause a shortening of the juvenile phase in some species. Perhaps the best example of this phenomenon is the induction of early flowering in celosia after a short-term water stress (Erwin, unpublished data). Similarly, it appears as though short-term heat stress can cause earlier flowering on newer cultivars of garden mums. High or low temperatures can also affect a plant’s photoperiodic response. For instance, at temperatures below 17°C, cineraria is a day-neutral plant. At temperatures above 17°C, cineraria is a short-day plant. In contrast, when temperatures exceed 23°C, flowering of many species can be delayed. Some species are sensitive to high night temperatures (Euphorbia pulcherrima, Gomphrena globosa, Tagetes erecta), some species are sensitive to high day temperatures (Fuchsia x hybrida, Antirrhinum majus), and some species are sensitive to high day or night temperatures (Impatiens hawkeri, Dendranthema x grandiflora, Schlumbergera truncata, many Pelargonium spp.) (Erwin and Warner, 1999a).\n\n6.1\n\nEthylene\n\nExposure to ethylene is capable of inducing flowering in some plant species. Most notably, ethylene exposure induces flowering in Bromeliads. Clark and Kerns (1942) showed that application of auxin to pineapple could stimulate early flowering. Subsequent research by Burg and Burg (1966) demonstrated that the induction of flowering was associated with auxin induced stimulation of ethylene. Commercially, pineapple is now stimulated to flower by applying ethephon which releases ethylene on plants. Application of ethephon also stimulates early flowering in mango (Chacko et al., 1976).\n\nFactors affecting flowering in ornamental plants\n\n7.\n\n33\n\nFLOWER DEVELOPMENT\n\nOnce flower induction and initiation have occurred, successful flower development must follow for flowering. This can require specific environmental conditions. For instance, some species require a specific photoperiod (which can be different than that for flower induction) for successful flower development. Additionally, species may have a minimum irradiance required for flower development, as was noted with Rosa spp. previously (Nell and Rasmussen, 1979). Temperature also interacts with flowering as described below. In contrast, other species may have no environmental requirements for successful flower development other than a lack of stress.\n\n7.1\n\nPhotoperiod Requirement\n\nFlower development can have a photoperiodic requirement. For instance, Dendranthema x grandiflora flower development has a shorter critical photoperiod than for flower induction. Dendranthema x grandiflora (SDP), therefore, has evolved in such a way as to naturally induce flowers as daylength starts to shorten after June 21st and then has successive flower development as the daylength continues to shorten into the fall of the year and the vernal equinox. Therefore, if a grower induced D. x grandiflora in the spring and then exposed plants to a photoperiod greater than the critical photoperiod for flower development, development would cease and a ‘crown bud’ would develop (Dole and Wilkins, 1999). Similarly, if a LDP is induced very early in spring and placed back under short-day conditions after induction in a lighted environment too early, flower bud development can be arrested.\n\n7.2\n\nTemperature Requirements\n\nThere is an optimal temperature for flower development that is likely species, photoperiod, and irradiance dependent. Whether temperature effects are due to impacts on the latter stages of flower initiation or whether the effect is on actual flower bud abortion is not clear. Likely, depending on the timing of non-optimal temperature conditions, both conditions are occurring. Additionally, whether nonoptimal temperature conditions constitute a ‘stress’ is a matter of debate. Here, nonoptimal temperature conditions are separated from temperature stress as discussed below. High temperature inhibition of flowering has been noted for some time. For instance, the node number at which the first flower cluster appears in L. esculentum increases dramatically at 27°C versus 10-16°C (Calvert, 1957). In general, many plant species have temperature optima for flowering that are between 18 and 22°C. As temperature increases or decreases from this optimum, flower number decreases.\n\n34\n\nChapter 1\n\nThere is evidence that anecdotally suggests that these temperature optima are based on differences in flower bud abortion during development. Such a conclusion is based on the observation that temperature significantly affects flower number on mature day neutral plants where flower induction is continuous. For example, Pelargonium spp. flower number per inflorescence decreases as average daily temperature increases. Flower number per inflorescence on P. peltatum ‘Nicole’ decreased from 9 to 3.8 flowers per inflorescence as average daily temperature increased from 12 to 29°C (Erwin, 1999). Similarly, P. x domesticum flower number per inflorescence decreases as average daily temperature decreases and flowering is inhibited altogether at average daily temperatures above 17°C (Erwin and Englen, 1992). Pelargonium x hortorum ‘Veronica’ flower number decreased from 52 to 15 flowers per inflorescence as average daily temperature increased from 12 to 29°C (Erwin and Heins, 1992). Fuchsia x hybrida L. ‘Dollar Princess’ flower number per node increased from 2.3 to 6 flowers as average daily temperature increased from 12 to 15°C then decreased to 2.3 flowers per node as average daily temperature further increased to 25°C (Erwin and Kovanda, 1990). Flower development of different species is sensitive to temperature and can vary diurnally. Schlumbergera truncata and Euphorbia pulcherrima flower development is most sensitive to night temperature. For instance, flower number was greatest on S. truncata ‘Madisto’ when night temperature was 20°C (Erwin et al., 1990). In contrast, Antirrhinum majus flower development appears to be most sensitive to day temperature. Impatiens hawkeri, Dendranthema x grandiflora, and Fuchsia x hybrida flower development is most sensitive to day and night temperature. Pelargonium spp. flower development appears to be most sensitive to average daily temperature (Erwin and Warner, 1999a).\n\n7.3\n\nImpact of Stress\n\nHigh temperatures can decrease flowering. Whether such temperature exposures constitute a ‘stress’ is a matter for debate. However, temperature exposure that results in an extended period of reduced growth should be considered a stress. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures reduces flowering of numerous flower crops. Exposure of Antirrhinum majus, Calendula officinalis, Impatiens wallerana, Mimulus x hybridus, and Torenia fournieri to high temperature reduced flowering of all species compared to cooler temperatures across a variety of irradiance treatments (Warner and Erwin, 2001b). The basis for reduced flower number is likely due, in part, to reduced photosynthesis. Exposure of Impatiens hawkeri and Viola x wittrockiana to high temperatures (35°C) for as short as two hours reduced photosynthetic rates for at least three days for some cultivars compared to ‘unstressed’ plants (Warner and Erwin, 2002). Photosynthetic recovery varied between I. hawkeri and V. x wittrockiana, with the latter recovering more quickly.\n\nFactors affecting flowering in ornamental plants\n\n35\n\nSuch variation in high temperature tolerance can be seen across cultivars within a species as well. For instance, prolonged exposure of V. x wittrockiana to high temperatures (30°C) compared to a ‘non-stress’ environment (20°C) reduced flowering of all cultivars studied (Warner and Erwin, 2003a). However, there was cultivar variation with flowering being reduced 23% for ‘Crystal Bowl Purple’ and 79% for ‘Majestic Giants Red and Yellow’. Similarly, the effect of high temperature exposure (32/28°C day/night) affected flower number per cluster on Lycopersicon esculentum cultivars differently (Warner and Erwin, 2003a). Lastly, Strope (1999) showed I. hawkeri cultivars varied in their ability to continue to flower under high temperature conditions (30°C). In addition to reducing flower number, yield in some crops can be reduced by high temperature induced floral sterility resulting in reduced seed set, fruit size, and yield. Such high temperature reduction in yield is a common problem in commercial horticulture production of peppers as well as many crops worldwide. High temperature sensitivity of flowering may be due to reduced overall carbon assimilation under high temperatures (Ranney and Peet, 1994), increased respiration (Berry and Bjorkman, 1980), or to a reduced ability of floral organs to recruit photoassimilates compared to vegetative tissues (Dinar and Rudich, 1985). Photosynthesis is a metabolic process that is susceptible to high temperature stress (Larcher, 1995). For example, photosynthetic rates of five birch taxa declined sharply when temperature exceeded 30°C (Ranney and Peet, 1994). This may be in part due to a reduction in chloroplast number as chloroplast biogenesis is reduced at temperatures greater than 32°C in barley (Smillie et al., 1978). Respiration rates continue to increase at temperatures above the optimum temperature for photosynthesis resulting in a net carbon loss (Berry and Bjorkman, 1980). Lastly, reduced concentrations of plant growth hormones in reproductive tissues following high temperature exposure likely reduce the ability of those tissues to attract assimilates (Kuo and Tsai, 1984). The author’s laboratory is currently evaluating the physiological basis for high temperature inhibition of flower development. Promising data are emerging showing variation in Arabidopsis thaliana heat sensitivity, which may provide a basis for gaining new insight into this significant floriculture crop issue.\n\n8.\n\nDORMANCY\n\nDormancy will only be discussed briefly since it is not directly related to flower evocation, only to continued flower development in a limited number of floriculture crops. Most notably, some bulb crops and woody plant species can initiate flowers, but then have flower development stopped at a specific stage until specific environmental conditions are met (Dole and Wilkins, 1999).\n\n36\n\nChapter 1\n\nBulb crops can vary considerably when flowers are initiated during the year and during the life cycle of the species. Hartsema (1961) has classified species into the following five response groups: 1. Flowers initiated during the spring or early summer of the year preceding that in which they reach anthesis and before the bulbs are ‘lifted’ (Narcissus, Galanthus, Leucojum). 2. Flowers initiated following the previous growing period, so that the bulbs have initiated flowers by replanting time in the autumn (Tulipa, Hyacinthus, Iris reticulata). 3. Flowers initiated after replanting, at the low temperatures of winter or early spring (bulbous Iris, but not I. reticulata). 4. Flowers initiated more than a year before anthesis (Nerine). 5. Flower initiation alternates with leaf formation through the whole growing period (Hippeastrum, Zephyranthes). The physiological basis for flowering in each of these groupings can differ significantly. For instance, there is evidence that group 3 has a vernalization requirement, whereas groups 1 and 2 require dormancy. Dormancy requirement is defined as flower development, which can be arrested until the appropriate environmental, or time constraints are fulfilled. For example, spring ephemerals, i.e. Tulipa x hybrida or Narcissus pseudonarcissus are not photoperiodic, as the length of a growth cycle is relatively short. Such plants will only successfully flower after these requirements are met. These plants are said to be ‘dormant’. Temperature control of dormancy is common in temperate perennial species and water control of dormancy is common in locations where water can be limiting, i.e. a desert region. For instance, water stress can induce dormancy in Achimenes hybrids (Zimmer and Junker, 1985). In general, flower bud dormancy can be broken on many woody plant species by exposing tissue to conditions similar to vernalization. Six to 12 weeks of temperatures between 2-6°C is often optimal. In some cases, GA3 application can overcome dormancy and enhance shoot emergence from tubers (Lurie et al., 1992). Application of GA3 to overcome flower bud dormancy is common commercially in the florists Azalea (Dole and Wilkins, 1999).\n\n9.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAt this point, one must take some latitude and emphasize the need for traditional physiological research on floriculture crops during crop domestication and breeding. It seems that a complete understanding of what factors result in flowering in floriculture crops are essential to the success of any breeding or physiology project related to that crop. It is amazing how much research has been conducted on crops\n\nFactors affecting flowering in ornamental plants\n\n37\n\nin which we have little or no understanding of the flowering mechanisms in that crop! How valid are the conclusions? Our recent work on photoperiodism in annual crops was started by questions from Terry Smith (Smith Garden, Bellingham, Washington) when he simply wanted to know how to flower petunias from February 1 to March 1. What grew out of that question was a realization flowering of many of the commercially significant bedding plant crops is in its infancy. There is clearly a need to renew fundamental research on the flowering physiology of flower crops to meet the needs for scheduling, timing and marke"
