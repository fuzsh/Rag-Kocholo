        "text": "Arum dioscoridis var. syriacum, Spotted Arum, is a recognised infraspecific taxon of the species Arum dioscoridis and is endemic to central southern Turkey and northwest Syria. In a very variable species that has undergone significant taxonomic changes in recent years and where the number of recognised varieties has been significantly reduced, Arum dioscoridis var. syriacum is itself somewhat variable. This variation exists not just from plant to plant but from flower to flower on the same plant as can be seen from our photograph of the double-flowering plant. The markings are unique for each individual flower. In an internet age where photographs are sometimes considered as if they were a categoric holotype this can be confusing.\n\nArum dioscoridis var. syriacum is described as having a greenish upper spathe with less purple splotches on the spathe than the species form. As can be seen from the photographs, when the upper part of the spathe starts to fold downwards leaving just the lower portion visible, the markings on the spathe are very similar to Arum dioscoridis.\n\nAnother delightful similarity to the type species is the extraordinary olfactory experience when the inflorescence opens. In a genus of strongly odorous plants, Arum dioscoridis is probably the most overpowering of them all and Arum dioscoridis var. syriacum is likewise a truly unforgetable experience. Pungent is something of an understatement. Comparative descriptions of this aroma are pointless. Usually likened to the smell of dung, it is like the dung of no living animal I am aware of. Perhaps more like the ancient communal cesspit of some mythical clan of gigantic gastroenteritis-inflicted dragons, it is an aroma from a dimesion of hell that can only be marveled at. On a still day it can be detected in the air at 50 metres. In a glasshouse - and some of our glasshouses are very large - it fills the air. It makes the somewhat foul-smelling Arum pictum, Arum nigrum or Arum elongatum all seem rather tame. For this rather wonderful display of insouciant individuality I just love them. This is certainly the champion of all pollinator-friendly plants...although in this case the pollinaters are not bees or butterflies. One can only be in awe of a botanical world so rich and creative as to produce such a plant. Not for the timid? It is a plant that shouts out to be bold and adventurous, that life is short enough as it is. Buy it, plant it, marvel at it...It may be overpowering but it is not life-threatening...\n\nHighly recommended."
