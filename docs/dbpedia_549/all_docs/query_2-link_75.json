This document is a 3-sentence summary of a comprehensive index to the Flora of Guatemala published in Fieldiana: Botany Volume 24. The index covers 5,697 pages across 12 parts and includes all accepted scientific names, synonyms, and common names. It is intended to serve as a checklist for plants found not just in Guatemala but a wider geographical area, since many plants in the region occur over a greater range. The index does not include orchids, mosses, or ferns which are or will be indexed separately.",
