Grayum\n\nEnglish, final draft: placed 1/May/2000\n\nPistia\n\nEngler, A. 1920. Aroideae und Pistioideae. In A. Engler (ed.), Das Pflanzenreich IV.23.F (Heft 73): 1-274. Engelmann, Berlin.\n\n1 polytypic sp., throughout trop. and subtrop. regions of world.\n\nPistia stratiotes L., Sp. pl. 963. 1753. Lechuga de agua.\n\nFloating, stoloniferous aquatics (occasionally stranded), lacking milky sap. Roots plumose. Leaves spiraled in dense rosettes. Petioles obsolete or to ca. 3 cm long, flattened to terete, often hirsute. Leaf-blades ca. 0.6-17 × 0.8-8 cm, subreniform or ovate to (more frequently) obovate, obdeltate, or oblanceolate, broadly rounded to truncate apically, ± spongy, pilosulous on both sides, with 3-15 prominent, subparallel veins becoming plicate below. Infls. solitary in axils, small and inconspicuous; peduncle ca. 2.5-6 mm long, pubescent; spathe ca. 5-6.5 mm long, pubescent externally, with proximal tube and distal, whitish lamina; spadix mostly adnate to spathe, with separate male and female regions, without sterile zones. Fls. unisexual, naked; male fls. 2-8 in a terminal verticel, with 2 stamens connate in synandria; female fls. solitary, with short style; stigma obtuse; ovary unilocular; ovules numerous, borne along parietal placentae. Frs. thin-walled, ca. 4-13-seeded. Seeds ca. 2.5 × 1.5 mm, barrel-shaped, truncate at each end, pitted, operculate.\n\nLagoons, canals, swamps, and rice-fields, 0-100(-750) m; N Atl. slope (P.N. Tortuguero, Lago Arenal), entire Pac. slope. Fl. Aug.-Oct. (Grayum & Sleeper 5933; CR, MO)\n\nRobust specimens of this familiar sp. are unmistakable by virtue of their floating habit and erect, short-petioled, rosette-forming leaves with fleshy, cuneate-based, parallel-veined blades. The tiny, axillary infls. are very inconspicuous. The plants are exceedingly variable in leaf-blade size and shape, sometimes within a single population; even the smallest specimens (with subreniform or ovate, 3-veined leaf-blades < 1 × 1 cm) may be fertile. Such presumably precocious individuals might be mistaken for Spirodela (Lemnaceae) or Salvinia (Pteridophyta, Salviniaceae).\n\nPistia stratiotes is occasionally planted as an ornamental in aquaria and ponds.\n\nRhodospatha\n\nEngler, A. & K. Krause. 1908. Monsteroideae. In A. Engler (ed.), Das Pflanzenreich IV.23 (Heft 37): 4-138. Engelmann, Berlin.\n\nCa. 67 spp., S Mex. to Bol., Guianas, S Braz., Trin.; 9 spp. in CR.\n\nTerrestrial plants or (more commonly) appressed-climbing hemiepiphytes; stems usually ± stout, in terrestrial spp. decumbent to weakly erect, sometimes supported by prop roots; plants lacking milky sap. Leaves distichous. Petioles never peltately attached, with a geniculum. Leaf-blades simple, narrowly lanceolate to broadly ovate, often pinkish when flushing, the margins entire. Infls. solitary in leaf (or cataphyll) axils; spathe erect and enveloping spadix at anthesis, white to pinkish, without a proximal tube, becoming broadly splayed and promptly deciduous; spadix uniform, lacking sterile fls. toward base. Fls. bisexual, naked; stamens 4, distinct; style thickened, shorter than ovary; stigma linear or (rarely) 2- or 3-lobed; ovary 2-locular; ovules numerous per locule, borne along axile placentae. Frs. many-seeded. Seeds 1-1.6 mm long, reniform to lenticular.\n\nRhodospatha closely resembles Monstera, from which it differs principally in having numerous and small (as opposed to few and large) ovules and seeds. Furthermore, leaf-blades in Rhodospatha are always entire and imperforate, while they are often pinnatifid and/or perforate in Monstera. Despite the generic name, most CR Rhodospatha spp. do not have pinkish spathes (and some Monstera spp. do!). Terrestrial spp. of Rhodospatha may closely resemble Spathiphyllum, but the latter genus differs in having persistent spathes and perigoniate fls.\n\n1 Plants terrestrial; petioles usually sheathed for < 2/3 of the way to the leaf-base; rare plants of the Atl. slope.\n\n2 Leaf-blades 31-80 cm, ± narrowly elliptical, with 25-38 primary lateral veins per side, these usually > 1 cm apart; peduncles 20-50.5 cm...R. moritziana\n\n2' Leaf-blades 25-46 cm, ovate to broadly elliptical or subrotund, with 32-57 primary lateral veins per side, these usually < 1 cm apart; peduncles 9.5-29 cm...R. sp. A\n\n1' Plants epiphytic; petioles usually sheathed to > 2/3 of the way to the leaf-base; both slopes.\n\n3 Primary lateral leaf veins < 25 per side; petiole sheaths persistent.\n\n4 Petioles > 25 cm; leaf-blades > 12 cm wide; 1500-1600 m...R. sp.

E\n\nRhodospatha forgetii N. E. Br., Bull. Misc. Inform. Kew 1913: 358. 1913.\n\nScandent plants. Petioles ca. 29.5-45 cm, sheathed to within ca. 2-6.5 cm of geniculum, the sheath apparently persistent. Leaf-blades ca. 41.5-60 × 13.9-20 cm, narrowly elliptical, \"somewhat shining\", with ca. 25-33 primary lateral veins per side. Peduncles ca. 10.5-16.5(-30) cm. Spathe at first dull (salmon) pinkish within, latter fading to dull yellow. Spadix ca. 10.4-12 × 0.9-1.4 cm, at first pale pinkish, the stipe ca. 0.5-1.5 cm. Ripe frs. unknown.\n\n\"Plant sent from Costa Rica by Mr. Forget\" (2 Aug. 1913, Hort. Sander & Sons s. n., K).\n\nRhodospatha forgetii is known only from two herbarium specimens prepared from material in cult.: the holotype, from a plant grown at Kew (cited above), and a later collection from a plant grown at Edinburgh and probably propagated from the Kew material. These original specimens do not correspond convincingly to any wild-collected material, from CR or anywhere else. Probably the best match, among CR spp., is Rhodospatha moritziana, which differs primarily in being terrestrial.\n\nForget's itinerary in CR is unknown; indeed, there appears to be no independent evidence that he even visited the country. Thus, not only is the identity of R. forgetii nebulous, its occurrence in CR must also be regarded with suspicion.\n\nRhodospatha moritziana Schott, Oesterr. Bot. Wochenbl. 7: 109. 1857. Anepsias moritzianus (Schott) Schott.\n\nTerrestrial or ± epilithic, often along creeks. Petioles ca. 23-69 cm, sheathed < halfway or to within 2 cm of geniculum, the sheath densely whitish-speckled, ± persistent. Leaf-blades ca. 31-80 × 14.5-34 cm, ± narrowly elliptical, ± glossy above, matte and ± whitish below, with ca. 25-38 primary lateral veins per side. Peduncles ca. 20.5-50.5 cm. Spathe lilac-pink (very early) to greenish white or cream-colored. Spadix ca. 8-15.7 × 0.9-2 cm, salmon-pink to lilac at anthesis, becoming greenish, the stipe ca. 1-2.3 cm. Ripe frs. yellow-orange.\n\nWet forests, 100-400 m; Atl. slope Cord. Talamanca. Fl. Jun., Sep. CR to Amaz. Per˙ and W Ven. (Grayum et al. 8747; CR, MO)\n\nRhodospatha moritziana is distinct among all CR Rhodospatha spp. in its terrestrial habit and relatively narrow leaf-blades. Due to this combination of features, it is perhaps more liable to be mistaken for a Spathiphyllum sp. This is an uncommon sp. in CR, where it is not known from any easily accessible sites.\n\nThe name Anepsias moritzianus was certainly misapplied by Standley (1937), although to what sp. is unclear.\n\nRhodospatha pellucida Croat & Grayum, in Croat, Novon 9: 500. 1999.\n\nAppressed-climbing or loosely scandent, epiphytic vines, usually fertile ca. 2-2.5 m above the ground. Petioles 7-25 cm, sheathed to within 4 cm of the blade, the sheath persistent. Leaf-blades 13.5-43 × 4.5-15.8 cm, narrowly elliptical to oblong-lanceolate or oblanceolate, glossy above, weakly glossy to semiglossy and markedly paler below, with ca. 18-40 primary lateral veins per side. Peduncles ca. 6.7-29.5 cm. Spathe cream-colored to white within. Spadix ca. 5.3-16 × 0.7-1.2 cm, cream-colored to white at anthesis, the stipe ca. 0.5-1.5 cm. Color of ripe frs. unknown (spadix becoming bluish or olive-green post anthesis).\n\nWet forests, 0-650 m; entire Atl. slope. Fl. Apr.-Sep., Nov. Extreme SE Nic. to Pac. Ecua. (Grayum 9845; CR, MO)\n\nRhodospatha pellucida comprises smallish, nondescript plants, recognized by their Atl. slope habitat, epiphytic habit, relatively short petioles, and numerous (> 25 pairs) primary lateral leaf veins flanked by pellucid streaks. These streaks may be very conspicuous and scattered throughout the intervenal spaces (as particularly in the Sixaola region), or inconspicuous and restricted to a single, closely appressed file on either side of each primary vein.\n\nRhodospatha wendlandii Schott, J. Bot. 2: 52. 1864. R. nervosa Lundell.\n\nAppressed-climbing trunk epiphytes, fertile ca. 2-4 m above the ground. Petioles ca. (13-)30-83 cm, sheathed to within 7 cm of the geniculum, the sheath deciduous. Leaf-blades ca. (23.5-)36-75 × (8.8-)15-35 cm, lance-ovate to narrowly elliptical or oblong-lanceolate, often truncate at base, matte to glossy above, semiglossy and paler below, with ca. 28-52(-70) primary lateral veins per side. Peduncles ca. 9-30 cm. Spathe white or cream to pinkish or purplish within. Spadix (7.3-)13.2-26.2 × 0.9-2 cm, pinkish to purplish or reddish at anthesis, the stipe ca. 0.5-2.1(-2.6) cm. Ripe frs. pale yellow or yellow-orange.\n\nWet forests, 0-1500(-1750+) m; Atl. slope and near Continental Divide, all major cords. (to R.N.F.S. Barra del Colorado and P.N. Tortuguero), Pac. slope Cord. Guanacaste, and S from R.B. Carara. Fl. Jan., Mar., May-Oct., Dec. S Mex. (Oax., Ver.) to Pac. Col. (Davidse et al. 28427; CR, MO)\n\nThis is the most widespread and well-known CR Rhodospatha sp., easily identified by its epiphytic habit, relatively long petioles with deciduous sheaths, and large, often truncate-based, many-veined leaf-blades. It can only be confused with the smaller and rarer R. sp. E (see key, couplet 8), the only other epiphytic Rhodospatha sp. in CR with deciduous petiole sheaths. The spathes of Rhodospatha wendlandii are typically white or whitish in CR, but may be pink to purplish in some localities (Cord. Guanacaste). The spadix is usually nodding in fr.\n\nRhodospatha sp. A\n\nTerrestrial, the stems ± decumbent to long-creeping, with erect portion to ca. 1.5 m tall and supported by long prop-roots. Petioles ca. 23-70 cm, sheathed for ca. 3/5 to 2/3(-9/10) their total length, the sheath deciduous. Leaf-blades ca. 25-46 × 12-31.5 cm, ovate to broadly elliptical or subrotund, weakly glossy to semiglossy on both surfaces, with ca. 32-57 primary lateral veins per side, these prominently sunken above and raised below. Peduncles 9.5-29 cm. Spathe cream-colored (Liesner 14420, MO). Spadix ca. 6.7-18 × 0.9-1.8 cm, color not reported, the stipe ca. 1.5-3 cm. Color of ripe frs. unknown.\n\nWet forests, often in rocky sites, 140-1200+ m; Atl. slope Cords. Central and Talamanca. Fl. Apr., Jun., Jul. CR and W Pan. (Liesner 14420; CR, MO)\n\nThis sp. is easily recognized by its terrestrial habit and relatively broad leaf-blades with numerous, prominent primary lateral veins. Rhodospatha sp. A is generally rare in CR, though it may be locally abundant.\n\nRhodospatha sp. B\n\nLoosely scandent trunk epiphytes to at least 2.5 m above the ground, the stem epidermis glossy. Petioles ca. 38-47 cm, glossy, sheathed to geniculum, the sheath persistent. Leaf-blades ca. 43-51 × 15.5-19 cm, ± narrowly elliptical, glossy and dark green above, glossy or semiglossy and much paler below, with 16-20 primary lateral veins per side. Fertile parts unknown.\n\nWet (cloud) forest, 1500-1600 m; Atl. slope Cord. Central (Río Zurquí). Fl. ? CR and W Pan., possibly Col. (Grayum & Sleeper 6137; INB, MO)\n\nThis sp. is distinguished by its cloud-forest habitat, persistent petiole sheaths, and relatively large, glossy, leaf-blades with few (< 25 pairs) primary lateral veins. Although known from CR by just one, sterile collection, it is not confused with any other sp.\n\nRhodospatha sp. C\n\nEpiphytes. Petioles ca. 13.5-19.5 cm, sheathed to geniculum, the sheath apparently persistent. Leaf-blades ca. 21.5-27 × 3.4-5.5 cm, narrowly lanceolate, \"dull on both sides\" (McPherson 10833, MO; Pan.), with 16-22 primary lateral veins per side. Peduncles ca. 8-10 cm. Spathe \"green-white\" (McPherson 10833). Spadix ca. 5.8-6.9 × 0.6-0.7 cm, \"pale whitish-green\" (Burger & Antonio 10924), the stipe ca. 0.8 cm. Ripe frs. unknown.\n\nWet forests, 50-100 m; Atl. slope Cord. Talamanca (between Puerto Viejo de Talamanca and Bribrí). Fl. Sep. CR and adjacent Pan. (Burger & Antonio 10924, F)\n\nRhodospatha sp. C, a rare sp. of the Sixaola region, is distinguished by its epiphytic habit and relatively small leaf-blades with few (< 25 pairs) primary lateral veins. It is most similar to the Pac. slope R. sp. D (see key, couplet 5).\n\nRhodospatha sp. D\n\nEpiphytic vines on trunks, fertile ca. 2.5-5 m above the ground. Petioles ca. 4.3-19.5 cm, sheathed to within 3 mm of blade (sheath often prolonged beyond blade base), the sheath erect to involute, persistent. Leaf-blades ca. 13-41 × 2.7-9.4 cm, narrowly elliptical or oblong-lanceolate to oblanceolate, glossy and dark green above, semiglossy and yellow-green below, with 7-22 primary lateral veins per side. Peduncles ca. 8-19 cm. Spathe pure white within. Spadix ca. 4.3-11.7 × 0.6-1.1 cm, cream-colored, the stipe ca. 0.1-1.3 cm. Ripe (?) frs. blue-green.\n\nWet forests, 0-1200 m; Pac. slope S from R.B. Carara and Z.P. Cerros de Turrubares. Fl. Jan., Apr.-Sep., Dec. ENDEMIC. (Grayum et al. 7574; CR, MO)\n\nRhodospatha sp. D is a distinctive sp., easily recognized by its Pac. slope habitat, epiphytic habit, relatively short, fully sheathed petioles, and narrow leaf-blades highly glossy above. It is most similar to the Atl. slope R. sp. C (see key, couplet 5). This sp. is especially common in the forest at J.B. Wilson.\n\nRhodospatha sp. E\n\nMore or less appressed-climbing trunk epiphytes, fertile ca. 2+ m above the ground, the stems drying transversely fissured. Petioles ca. (12-)20-36 cm, sheathed to within 4.5 cm of the blade, the sheath deciduous. Leaf-blades ca. (23-)30-51 × (7.5-)8-15 cm, narrowly elliptical to oblong-lanceolate or oblanceolate, ± velvety above, weakly glossy and pallid green (\"silvery\") below, with ca. (17-)24-32 primary lateral veins per side. Peduncles ca. 13-21 cm. Spathe cream-colored within. Spadix ca. 8.8-15.1 × 0.7-1.7 cm, pinkish cream at anthesis, the stipe ca. 0.6-1.2 cm. Color of ripe frs. not certainly known.\n\nWet forests, ca. 500-1200+ m; Atl. slope Cords. Tilarán, Central, and Talamanca. Fl. Jan., Mar., Apr., Jul. CR to W cent. Pan. (Grayum 6707; CR, MO)\n\nRhodospatha sp. F is characterized by an epiphytic habit, deciduous petiole sheaths, and numerous (> 25 pairs) primary lateral leaf veins. It can only be confused with the generally larger and more widespread R. wendlandii (see key, couplet 8).\n\nSpathiphyllum\n\nBaker, R. A. & W. C. Burger. 1976. Key and commentary on the species of Spathiphyllum (Araceae) in Costa Rica, including S. silvicola, sp. nov. Phytologia 33: 447-454.\n\nCa. 60 spp. in the Neotropics, from Mex. (Ver.) to Per˙ and NE Braz., plus 3 spp. in E Indonesia and SW Pac. region; 8 spp. in CR.\n\nTerrestrial, acaulescent plants (some Asian spp. may be appressed-climbing, with ± evident stems); plants lacking milky sap. Leaves distichous. Petioles never peltately attached, with a geniculum. Leaf-blades simple, narrowly lanceolate to broadly elliptical or subovate, the margins entire. Infls. solitary in axils; spathe deflexed and ligulate to erect and broadly splayed at anthesis, without a proximal tube, white to yellowish, persistent; spadix uniform, lacking sterile fls. toward base, the stipe sometimes adnate to spathe for some or all of its length. Fls. bisexual, with perianth of (4)6 distinct or connate tepals; stamens (4)6, distinct; style obsolete to thickened, conical, and conspicuously exserted; stigma 3-4-lobed; ovary (2)3(4)-locular; ovules (1-4)6-8 per locule, on axile placentae. Frs. usually white or whitish, few- to several-seeded.\n\nSpathiphyllum is usually easily recognized by its terrestrial, acaulescent habit, ± lanceolate to elliptical, non-cordate leaf-blades with numerous primary lateral veins, and long-pedunculate infls. with persistent spathes and perigoniate, bisexual fls. In CR, it can only be confused with some terrestrial spp. of Anthurium (see, especially, A. lancifolium) and Rhodospatha (with caducous spathes and naked fls.). Several Spathiphyllum spp. exhibit extreme variation in the size of flowering specimens.\n\n1 Spathe 1.4-5.1 cm wide, lanceolate or lance-ovate to narrowly elliptic, lance-oblong, or oblanceolate, becoming reflexed, non-decurrent on peduncle or decurrent to 2.4 cm.\n\n2 Tepals fully connate in a cupulate perianth, the margins entire; both slopes...S. laeve\n\n2' Tepals distinct, or connate only in basal half, the perianth margins incised.\n\n3 Leaf-blades 30-46 × 12.3-22 cm, with ca. 18-32 primary lateral veins per side; petioles usually ± densely asperulous with minute, stellate trichomes; spathe usually non-decurrent on peduncle (rarely decurrent to ca. 1.1 cm); spadix at anthesis ca. 7.4-15.1 cm; tepals distinct; Atl. slope...S. fulvovirens\n\n3' Leaf-blades 15-38.5 × 4.5-11.5(-15.3) cm, with ca.

(Gómez et al. 20508; CR, MO)\n\nSpathiphyllum friedrichsthalii is most easily recognized by its habitat: open, marshy sites below 200 m elevation on the Atl. slope. It is the only CR Spathiphyllum spp. found in such places. On herbarium sheets, S. friedrichsthalii is best recognized by its blackish-drying foliage, broad, erect, decurrent spathes, and subcylindric (rather than conical) styles. This is our most familiar Spathiphyllum spp., as it grows abundantly in wet pastures and is conspicuous even from speeding autos by virtue of its broad, white flowering spathes. It has also been cult. for the cut-flower and house-plant trades, under the English name peace lily.\n\nSpathiphyllum fulvovirens Schott, Oesterr. Bot.

(Pac. slope and Río Magdalena Valley). (Robles 1614; CR, MO)\n\nSpathiphyllum fulvovirens is distinguished by its stellate-asperulous petioles and ± narrow, reflexed, usually non-decurrent spathes. It is most similar to the sympatric S. laeve and the Pac. slope S. silvicola, both of which comprise smaller plants with glabrous petioles and briefly decurrent spathes. The former sp. differs additionally in its fully connate tepals. Though locally common in primary forest, S. fulvovirens is of restricted distribution in CR; it has been collected much more frequently in Pan., where it ascends to at least 1000 m elevation.\n\nThe peculiar stellate petiolar trichomes, unique to S. fulvovirens (at least among CR spp.), have not been mentioned by previous authors. Unfortunately, they are not manifest on every specimen.\n\nSpathiphyllum laeve Engl., Bot. Jahrb.

Otherwise, S. laeve is quite similar in appearance to S. fulvovirens and, especially, S. silvicola, with both of which it occurs sympatrically.

(Liesner et al. 15584; CR, MO)\n\nThis sp., at least in its typical form, is recognized by its cloud-forest habitat, smallish size, and bright white flowering spathes. It is the only CR Spathiphyllum sp. that has been collected above 1300 m elevation, and also our smallest (on average) sp. with broad, erect, decurrent spathes. Some populations on the Atl. slope of the Cord. Talamanca S from the vicinity of Moravia de Chirripó (e.g., Fernández 824, INB) comprise mostly much larger plants in every respect, and account for all of the parenthetical extremes in the above description. This material differs in certain other details (e.g., in possibly having spathes green at anthesis), and may prove to merit taxonomic recognition.\n\nSpathiphyllum phryniifolium Schott, Oesterr. Bot.

It is also the only sp. in this group with green flowering spathes and exserted styles (but see the discussion under S. montanum). It may be confused with S. atrovirens (green spathes, but obsolete styles) or, at its upper elevational limits, with S. montanum; however, S. phryniifolium has been collected above 600 m only in the Cord. Guanacaste, where S. montanum has not been found.\n\nAlthough widespread in CR, S. phryniifolium is nowhere common. Furthermore, the plants may be inconspicuous, even at anthesis, due to the greenish coloration of the spathes. This sp. has frequently lanceolate leaf-blades, with comparatively long-acuminate apices.\n\nSpathiphyllum silvicola R. A. Baker, in R. A. Baker & W. C.

It is otherwise extremely similar to the partially sympatric S. laeve, which has fully connate tepals. The Atl. slope S. fulvovirens also bears a resemblance (see key, couplet 3).

(Liesner 2895; CR, MO)\n\nSpathiphyllum wendlandii is distinctive, among CR spp., in its fully sheathed petioles, exceptionally numerous primary lateral leaf veins, and broad, bright white flowering spathes. On the other hand, Pac. slope populations differ consistently from those on the Atl. slope in having shorter, proportionately thicker spadices, subentire (as opposed to fimbriate) tepals, and thicker, shorter styles. Furthermore, S. wendlandii tends to occur in primary forest on the Pac. slope, rather than in secondary forest as on the Atl. slope. This Pac. material may prove to warrant taxonomic recognition.\n\nSpathiphyllum wendlandii has been collected from above 650 m elevation only in the Pac.

Leaf-blades simple, narrowly lanceolate to broadly elliptical, ± coriaceous, with primary veins usually obscure, the margins entire. Infls. solitary in leaf (or cataphyll) axils, the peduncles usually cernuous distally; spathe erect and enveloping spadix at anthesis, white to cream, without a proximal tube, becoming broadly splayed and promptly deciduous; spadix uniform, lacking sterile fls. toward base. Fls. bisexual, naked; stamens 4, distinct; style thickened, shorter than ovary; stigma linear-oblong; ovary 2-locular; ovules 4+ per locule, borne basally.

Among these genera, Stenospermation is easily recognized by its comparatively short-stemmed, usually epiphytic habit, spirally arranged leaves, and thickish leaf-blades with obscure venation. It is further distinctive in its usually distally cernuous (at anthesis) peduncles and numerous, small, ± obovoid seeds.\n\n1 Petiole sheath horizontally splayed (\"winged\"), extending to leaf-base; spadix ca. 1.8 cm, stipitate by ca. 0.4 cm; 1190 m, Atl. slope S Cord.

The overall geographic range, as given above, is from Pérez de Gómez (1983), who interpreted this sp. in a very broad sense. The name S. spruceanum, based on a collection from the Amaz. lowlands of Braz., is almost certainly misapplied to Cent. Amer. material.

Infr. a syncarp of connate, 1(2)-seeded berries.\n\nThe combination of a scandent, epiphytic habit and milky sap in most organs is virtually unique to Syngonium, among those aroid genera represented in CR (but see also Philodendron cretosum). A few spp. of Syngonium have clear or orangish sap, at least in the stem and petioles (e.g., S. rayi, S. standleyanum). In all cases, the connate pistils and syncarpous frs. are diagnostic. Several spp. of Philodendron with tripartite or trifoliolate leaf-blades are routinely confused with Syngonium (see under the former genus).\n\nThe common name Mano de tigre is applied to several of our spp. with pedately compound leaf-blades, especially S. macrophyllum.\n\nSyngonium auritum (L.) Schott, of Gr. Ant., is occasionally cult. for ornament in CR; it is distinguished by its trisect to 5-foliolate leaf-blades and spathe-blade ca. twice as the staminate spadix region. Several native spp. are also frequently cult. as ornamentals, especially S. hoffmannii, S. podophyllum, and S. wendlandii.\n\n1 Leaf-blades of adult plants simple, auriculate to cordate, sagittate, or hastate at base.\n\n2 Petioles > 25 cm; leaf-blades mostly > 31 cm long and > 12 cm wide; peduncles > 8.5 cm.\n\n3 Petioles ca. 28-50 cm; leaf-blades 29-48 × 12.5-22.5 cm; spathe tube uniformly greenish externally and within; spadix ca. 8.5-7 × 1.4-1.5 cm, abruptly narrowed below fertile male region; Pac. slope...S. hastiferum\n\n3' Petioles mostly > 50 cm; leaf-blades mostly > 48 cm long and > 23 cm wide; spathe tube reddish to purplish within (and often externally as well); spadix ca. 10.3-17.8 × 1.3-2.4 cm, abruptly narrowed below sterile male region; Atl. slope...S. schottianum\n\n2' Petioles < 25 cm; leaf-blades < 31 cm long or < 12 cm wide; peduncles < 8.5 cm.\n\n4 Leaf-blades > 3× longer than wide, minutely auriculate at base (auricles < 5 mm long); spadix at anthesis < 4 cm; Osa Pen....S. castroi\n\n4' Leaf-blades (at least, most larger ones) < 3× longer than wide, cordate or auriculate to sagittately or hastately lobed at base (auricles or lobes > 5 mm long, at least on some larger leaves); spadix at anthesis > 4 cm; widespread.\n\n5 Petioles and young stems glaucous; young stems, undersides of young leaf-blades, and main veins (below) on older leaf-blades reddish or purplish; leaf-blades coriaceous, weakly glossy above, the margins plane; primary lateral veins strongly ascending (< 45∞), mostly arising from lower half of midrib; spadix ca. 1-1.1 cm wide; Atl. slope...S. armigerum\n\n5' Petioles, leaf-blades, and young stems neither glaucous nor reddened; leaf-blades membranous, dark green and satiny or velvety above, paler below, the margins finely crispate-undulate; primary lateral veins ascending at ca. 45∞, well distributed along midrib; spadix ca. 0.5-0.7 cm wide [CHECK S. oduberi!!!]; both slopes.\n\n6 Leaf-blades ≥ 2× as long as petioles and > 10× as long as basal lobes; S Pac. slope (Osa Pen. and S Fila CosteÒa)...S. oduberi\n\n6' Leaf-blades < 2× as long as petioles and < 10× as long as basal lobes; both slopes (absent from Pen.

This is by far our commonest Syngonium sp. above 1000 m elevation. It is most apt to be confused with S. triphyllum (not found > 1000 m), which is never glaucous and has usually 9-16 primary lateral veins per side on the medial leaflet, but also resembles the allopatric S. mauroanum and S. wendlandii (see key, couplet 18) and, especially, S. laterinervium (see key, couplet 15).\n\nMaterial from below 1000 m elevation on the Atl. slope here assigned to S. hoffmannii comprises generally less robust plants, with somewhat smaller leaf-blades and more slender spadices (e.g., Grayum 6829, CR, MO). Furthermore, these low-elevation populations appear relatively infertile; though common in the forest at E.B. La Selva, S. hoffmannii has never been observed to flower naturally there. A rare fertile lowland collection of S. hoffmannii served as the \"type\" of the never-published Syngonium stenophyllum.\n\nSyngonium hoffmannii is frequently planted as an ornamental in CR, especially on the Valle Central.

The latter sp. also differs from S. peliocladum in its often glaucous young stems and usually externally bright orange to reddish (as opposed to whitish or yellowish) fruiting spathes. In my opinion, S. peliocladum is more distinctive than S. macrophyllum within the S. podophyllum complex.\n\nSyngonium podophyllum Schott, Bot.

Leaf-blades trifoliolate to pedately 5-foliolate; medial leaflet ca. 9.2-29(-36) × 3.5-13.4(-16.2) cm, with ca. 4-9 primary lateral veins per side; lateral leaflets truncate or auriculate to sagittately or hastately lobed at base (the lobes sometimes free, i.e., the leaf-blades 5-foliolate). Infls. 1-8 per axil. Peduncles ca. 5-17 cm, sometimes glaucous. Spathe tube green or greenish white within, green (and sometimes glaucous) externally, becoming orange-yellow to bright red in fr.; lamina white.

(Grayum et al. 5813; CR, MO)\n\nThe Syngonium podophyllum sp. group, within CR, is distinguished by petioles usually terete or subterete beyond the sheath, frequently pedately compound leaf-blades, numerous (1-8+) infls. per axil, relatively long (compared with the spadices) peduncles, spadices abruptly constricted below the fertile (rather than sterile) male region (with the sterile male region the narrower than the fertile male region), spiny pollen, and brownish syncarps. In CR, this group comprises S. angustatum, S. macrophyllum, S. peliocladum, S. podophyllum, and the anomalous (in having usually simple leaf-blades) S. hastiferum. For distinctions from S. podophyllum, the most widespread and variable sp. in the group, see other the other spp. (especially S. macrophyllum, the most similar to S. podophyllum).\n\nThough widespread in the CR lowlands, S. podophyllum is apparently absent from sites harboring S. peliocladum (such as E.B. La Selva).\n\nSyngonium podophyllum is widely grown as an ornamental, in CR and throughout the world, with many gaudily marked cultivars known.\n\nSyngonium rayi Croat & Grayum, in Grayum, Phytologia 82: 53. 1997.\n\nScandent epiphytes, fertile ca. 2-3 m above the ground.

(5.6-)10-24 × (2.5-)3.5-13 cm, ovate, oblong-ovate or oblong-deltate to elliptical, lance-oblong, or lanceolate, cordate to sagittate or hastate at base, dark green to purplish and matte to velvety adaxially, with ca. (3)4-11 primary lateral veins per side. Infls. 1-4 per axil. Peduncles ca. 2.2-5.2 cm. Spathe tube dark wine-red within, green externally; lamina cream-white.

(Hammel et al. 15263, MO)\n\nSyngonium rayi is characterized by its smallish, simple leaf-blades, dark green and velvety adaxially. These features are shared with the allopatric S. oduberi, which has relatively longer (compared with the petioles), differently shaped leaf-blades (see key, couplet 6). The sap of S. rayi is clear, unlike that of most Syngonium spp., which is milky (sap color of S. oduberi is unknown).\n\nMature individuals of Syngonium rayi are rare; this sp. has been collected in fl. only about a dozen times, and all but one of these collections are unicates. At E.B. La Selva, where S. rayi is best known, it has never been observed in fr. (presumably due to the great rarity of flowering individuals). Nonetheless, juvenile plants believed to represent this sp. (e.g., Lee s. n. 4/8/1984, MO-3304465) are abundant along forest trails, suggesting that vegetative multiplication may be involved.\n\nThis sp., as presently circumscribed, is rather a variable one. Populations from the Cord. Guanacaste and from C. Nara and C. Pito, in the Pac. Fila CosteÒa, differ widely in leaf-blade shape and size from one another, and also from Atl. lowland populations in the Sarapiquí region.\n\nSyngonium schottianum H. Wendl. ex Schott, Prodr. syst.

(Robles 2130; CR, MO)\n\nSyngonium schottianum is instantly identified by virtue of its very large size, simple leaf-blades, and Atl. slope habitat. Our only other remotely similar Syngonium is the Pac. S. hastiferum, which has smaller leaf-blades and very different infls. Plants of S. schottianum tend to be rather high-growing and difficult of access. From a distance, they are easily mistaken for a Philodendron sp. (the copious milky sap of S. schottianum sets it apart). Up close, S. schottianum resembles nothing so much as an epiphytic ×anthosoma (of which none exists).\n\nThis sp. is very abundant at E.B. La Selva.\n\nSyngonium standleyanum G. S. Bunting, Baileya 14: 21. 1966.\n\nScandent epiphytes, fertile to at least 5 m above the ground. Stems not glaucous. Petioles ca.

Leaf-blades trifoliolate; medial leaflet ca. 13-27.5 × 7-15.5 cm, with ca. 8-17 primary lateral veins per side; lateral leaflets cuneate to rounded or auriculate at base. Infls. 1-4(5) per axil.

(Hammel & Trainer 13206, MO)\n\nThis is the only CR Syngonium sp. with trifoliolate leaf-blades in which the lateral leaflets are regularly < 70% the length of the medial leaflet (with the exception of one aberrant collection of S. hastiferum, which see). Otherwise, the little-known S. standleyanum is scarcely distinct from the much more widespread and better known S. triphyllum (though the former name is older). In addition to non-glaucous parts and trifoliolate leaf-blades with 8-17 primary lateral veins per side on the medial leaflet, these two spp. share the distinctive, coarsely knobby pollen type otherwise unknown in the genus. At E.B. La Selva, where S. standleyanum is best known, the two spp. appear to be separated by habitat and phenology, in addition to the morphological characters noted in the key (couplet 17).\n\nSyngonium triphyllum Birdsey ex Croat, Ann.

(7-)9-16 primary lateral veins per side; lateral leaflets cuneate to truncate, auriculate, or sagittately to hastately lobed at base (the lobes sometimes free, i.e., the leaf-blades 5-foliolate). Infls. ca. 1-4+ per axil. Peduncles ca. 3.8-14 cm. Spathe tube reddish or purplish within, green (or tinged reddish) externally, becoming bright red on both sides in fr.; lamina white or sordid.

(Grayum et al. 4445; CR, MO)\n\nSyngonium triphyllum, widespread in CR lowland forests, is distinguished by its non-glaucous parts, adaxially keeled petioles, compound, blackish drying leaf-blades with 9-16 pairs of primary lateral veins on the medial leaflet, few (1-4+) infls., reddish inner spathe-tube coloration, peculiar, coarsely knobby pollen, bright red fruiting spathes, and pure white syncarps. It is most similar and no doubt most closely related to the rare S. standleyanum (see key, couplet 17). Trifoliolate specimens should also be compared with S. hoffmannii, which has frequently glaucous parts and fewer primary lateral veins on the medial leaflet.\n\nDespite the sp. epithet, plants of S. triphyllum frequently develop 5-foliolate leaf-blades.\n\nSyngonium wendlandii Schott, Oesterr.

(Grayum & Kress 8570; CR, MO)\n\nSyngonium wendlandii is easily recognized in life by its non-glaucous, finely asperulous-striate stems and trifoliolate leaf-blades, adaxially dark green and velvety. It is most similar to the allopatric S. mauroanum (see key, couplet 19), which has smooth stems and non-velvety leaf-blades, but should also be compared with the allopatric S. hoffmannii.\n\nIn addition to its attractive, velvety adult foliage, S. wendlandii has colorfully marked (with silvery gray) juvenile leaf-blades. Because of these features, this sp., restricted naturally to a small portion of cent. Pac. CR, is much more familiar in cult. than in the wild. It is occasionally planted for ornament not only in CR, but around the world.\n\nUrospatha\n\nEngler, A. 1911. Lasioideae. In A. Engler (ed.), Das Pflanzenreich IV.23 (Heft 48): 1-130.

Leaf-blades simple, sagittate to subhastate at base, the margins entire; medial lobe ca. 24-49 × 16-44 cm, with ca. 5-15 primary lateral veins per side; lateral lobes 24-51 × 9-24 cm, with posterior rib naked for ca. 1-3 cm. Infls. solitary in axils; peduncle ca. 0.9-1.75 cm, terete, spongy, often maroon-mottled toward base, recurved distally in fr.; spathe ca. 23-41 × 3-8 cm, erect, light green (usually suffused with maroon) to purplish externally, cream-colored to yellow-green within (with purplish blush at very base), emitting a fruity fragrance at anthesis, the margins barely overlapping at base, the apex attenuate and spirally twisted; spadix uniform, ca. 5.4-9.2 × 0.9-2.3 cm at anthesis, yellow- or olive-green to deep maroon, on stipe ca. 0.8-1.5 cm. Fls. bisexual, with perianth of 4-6 distinct tepals; stamens 4-6, distinct; style absent; stigma convex; ovary incompletely 2-locular; ovules 2-several per locule, borne near center of axile placentae.

Guat. to cent. Pan. (J. F. Morales et al. 1641; INB, MO)\n\nThis sp. is easily recognized by its subaquatic habitat, subterranean, rhizomatous stems, long petioles and peduncles, bold, sagittate leaf-blades, and attenuate, spirally twisted spathe apex. In terms of infl. morphology, Urospatha most closely resembles Dracontium (among CR aroid genera); however, the two genera are very different vegetatively.\n\nUrospatha grandis is quintessentially a sp. of the Atl. coastal plains, typically found in standing or slow-moving water or other damp sites including marshes, sluggish streams, wet pastures, and river backwaters. It may be locally abundant, sometimes forming virtually pure stands. Croat 36854 (MO) was collected in a swampy area at 900 m elevation near Alajuela, on the Pac. slope.\n\nIt is now generally agreed that the holotype illustration of Urospatha friedrichsthalii Schott, a name often applied to this sp. (in herb.), actually depicts a still unidentified Sagittaria sp. (Alismataceae).\n\nXanthosoma\n\nEngler, A. & K. Krause. 1920. Colocasioideae. In A. Engler (ed.), Das Pflanzenreich IV.23.E (Heft 71): 3-132. Engelmann, Berlin.\n\nCa. 45 spp., throughout tropical regions of the New World; 6 spp. in CR.\n\nTerrestrial; stems cormose or stout and erect, with copious milky sap. Leaves spiraled. Petioles rarely peltately attached, lacking a geniculum. Leaf-blades simple or trifoliolate to pedately compound, when simple narrowly lanceolate (rarely) to ovate-cordate, sagittate, or hastate. Infls. 1- per axil; spathe with proximal tube and distal lamina, the latter usually abscising after anthesis; spadix with separate male and female regions, with medial sterile zone, but lacking distal sterile appendage. Fls. unisexual, naked; male fls. with 4-6 stamens connate in synandria; sterile male fls. with elongate synandrodia; female fls. with thickened, discoid styles coherent with those of adjacent fls.; stigma discoid or convex, 3- or 4-lobed; ovary 2-4-locular; ovules numerous per locule, borne along axile placentae. Frs. whitish, many-seeded.\n\nThe combination of a terrestrial habit and copious milky sap is sufficient to distinguish Xanthosoma from the vast majority of CR Araceae. Only Caladium bicolor (with peltate leaves) and the very rare Chlorospatha croatiana (see under Xanthosoma wendlandii) share these basic features. Dieffenbachia spp. may also evince milky sap, particularly in the stems, but differ in leaf-blade morphology and infl. details. Introduced Asian spp. of Alocasia are superficially very similar to some Xanthosoma spp., but have colorless to reddish sap.\n\nThis treatment is highly speculative for those Xanthosoma taxa comprising plants with large, simple, cordate to sagittate, glabrous leaf-blades. Herbarium specimens of these are few and usually poorly prepared, with inadequate notes. Moreover, many sp. names have been validated, mostly based on cultivated plants of unknown origin and typified only by illustrations. Because of this situation, some cultivated or ruderal plants may not be identifiable by means of the following key.\n\n1 Leaf-blades pedately compound...X. wendlandii\n\n1' Leaf-blades simple.\n\n2 Foliage (petioles, leaf-blades, peduncles, and exterior spathe surface) ± densely pubescent...X. mexicanum\n\n2' Foliage glabrous.\n\n3 Stem aerial, erect (or decumbent at base), to 1-3 m; plants not glaucous, the leaf-blades ± concolorous; leaf-blades with primary lateral veins convex adaxially, ca.

Indeed, the plants treated here as X. robustum may prove to represent merely robust individuals of X. sagittifolium.\n\nXanthosoma robustum is seldom collected in CR, and may be strictly adventive.

Its edible corms (tiquisque) are widely available in the marketplace, and the plants are often seen as patio ornamentals, as on the Valle Central. They also occur as adventives in pastures and along roadsides, especially in the Atl. lowlands.\n\nBecause the taxonomy and nomenclature of the cult. Xanthosoma are in such chaos, a single, variable sp. is here recognized, and the oldest available name is applied. Various cultivars are represented in CR, e.g., tiquisque blanco and tiquisque colorado.

Ripe frs. pale greenish yellow.\n\nWet forests, (100-)1000-1800+ m; Atl. slope and near Continental Divide, all major cords., Pac. slope Cord. Talamanca, Cerro Azahar, Fila CosteÒa, Osa Pen.. Fl. Jan.-Mar., May-Dec. CR to Ecua., Ven. (Grayum 10374; INB, MO)\n\nThis is our largest and most conspicuous indigenous Xanthosoma sp., the stout, pachycaulous stems attaining at least 3 m in length. It is also the only simple-leaved CR Xanthosoma sp. with adaxially convex (as opposed to sunken) primary lateral leaf-veins and (except for the pubescent X. mexicanum) our only simple-leaved sp. with the spathe tube reddish within. Unfortunately, stem morphology, leaf-vein disposition, spathe coloration, and most of the other distinctive features of X. undipes (non-glaucous foliage, naked posterior rib on the leaf-blades, bright orange female fls.) are frequently not appreciable on herbarium specimens and not described on the labels.\n\nXanthosoma undipes is quintessentially a montane sp., most abundant above 1000 m elevation, but descending to below 200 m on the Atl. slope of the Cord. Central (E.B. La Selva) and Osa Pen.. It usually grows near water (along creeks, wet pastures, lagoon edges, etc.).\n\nXanthosoma wendlandii (Schott) Schott, Oesterr. Bot. Z. 15: 33. 1865. Acontias wendlandii Schott, Oesterr. Bot. Z. 8: 178. 1858; X. hoffmannii (Schott) Schott. Comida de perro.\n\nStem subterranean, a subglobose or oblate corm ca. 1.5-3 cm diam. Petioles ca. 49-130 cm, sheathed ca. 26-36% total length, finely striate, densely mottled or suffused with purplish, terete beyond sheath. Leaf-blades pedately 5-9-foliolate; medial leaflet ca. 17-50 × 6-17.5 cm, with ca. 4-9 primary lateral veins per side; posterior rib naked for 0-0.5 cm. Infls. 1-[??] per axil. Peduncles ca. 23-37 cm. Spathe tube pale greenish within (sometimes with blotch or collar of purplish at base of spadix), green externally; lamina whitish. Spadix ca. 11-16.5 × 1.1-1.3 cm, the fertile male portion white; sterile male portion [???]; fertile female portion (stigmas) very pale green. Ripe frs. white.\n\nWet and moist forests, 0-1300 m; Pac. slope S to Puriscal region (Z.P. La Cangreja). Fl. Jun.-Aug. Mex. (Son.) to CR, W Pan. (Pen. Azuero), N Ven. (Grayum et al. 4016; CR, MO)\n\nThis is the only CR Xanthosoma sp. with compound leaf-blades. In CR, it can only be confused with Chlorospatha croatiana, which has an erect (non-cormose) rhizome, much more slender infls., and occurs in wetter (mainly Atl. slope) forests. The more similar Xanthosoma helleborifolium (Jacq.) Schott, which has generally more numerous (11-17) leaflets and more slender spadices than X. wendlandii, has been attributed to CR (by Standley, 1937) and N to El Salv., but I have seen no collections from N of cent. Pan. Like other cormose Xanthosoma spp. of the seasonally dry Pac. slope (X. dealbatum, X. mexicanum), X. wendlandii survives the \"verano\" as leafless corms.\n\nXanthosoma wendlandii is occasionally cultivated as a patio ornamental in CR, especially in the Valle Central.\n\nIt is possible that the Cuban X. cubense (Schott) Schott and/or the Brazilian X. pentaphyllum (Schott) Schott will prove conspecific with X. wendlandii; X. pentaphyllum has nomenclatural priority.\n\nZantedeschia\n\nLetty, C. 1973. The genus Zantedeschia. Bothalia 11: 5-26.\n\n7 spp., S. Afr.; 1 sp. in CR.\n\nOther spp. of Zantedeschia may occasionally be cult. in CR as garden ornamentals, including Z. albomaculata (Hook.) Baill. (white spathes purplish within at base), Z. elliottiana (W. Watson) Engl. (yellow spathes), and Z. rehmannii Engl. (usually with pink spathes), as well as various cultivars and hybrids.\n\nZantedeschia aethiopica (L.) Spreng., Syst. veg. 3: 765. 1826. Calla aethiopica L., Sp. pl. 968. 1753; Richardia africana Kunth. Cala, cartucho, calla.\n\nTerrestrial; stem subterranean, a thick, fleshy rhizome; plants without milky sap. Leaves spiraled. Petioles ca. 33-82 cm, spongy, never peltately attached, lacking a geniculum. Leaf-blades simple, ca. 15-40 × 6.8-24.5 cm, oblong-deltate to lance-deltate, sagittate to subhastate at base, with ca. 6-10 primary lateral veins per side Infls. 1 or 2 {CHECK!!!} per axil; spathe ca. 10.5-22.5 × (4.5-)7.5-13.5 cm, with greenish proximal tube and broadly splayed, rotund to elliptical, distally reflexed, pure white lamina; spadix at anthesis ca. 3.9-9.6 cm, with separate male and female regions, without medial sterile zone or distal sterile appendage; male region ca. 0.5-0.6 cm wide, orange- or golden-yellow, the male fls. with 2 or 3 distinct stamens; female fls. interspersed with mushroom-shaped staminodia; style short; stigma convex; ovary 3-locular; ovules 1-4 per locule, basal or on axile placentae. Frs. green, becoming orange in proximal portion, 1-12-seeded.\n\nWet (oak) forests, 1200-3000 m; near Continental Divide, Cords. Cen"
