        "text": "The plant is known as Bangkok kalachuchi or Desert rose in the Philippines due to its resemblance to plumeria (Plumeria obtusa, white calachuche), which was introduced from Bangkok, Thailand. Thick-stemmed succulent shrub with crooked branches that is generally evergreen in cultivation, but turns deciduous in dry seasons. It grows to a height of about 5 feet (1.5 meters) in cultivation. Simple, lanceolate-obovate leaves in a loose spiral, 5–15 cm long, 0.6–0.8 cm broad, frequently glossy, with an entire edge and a base that tapers into a short petiole. Flowers are spectacular, trumpet-shaped, 2-5 cm x 4-6 cm in length, in small terminal clusters, and are mostly red or pink, but can sometimes occasionally have a white center, or \"eye\". Fruit are long, green, pod-like follicles that can reach a length of 4 inches (10 cm); when fully developed, they split open to produce a large number of long, narrow, silky seeds. The plant exudes toxic latex, and all parts are poisonous if ingested. Reportedly in wide areas of Africa the root sap, or sometimes the wood, or stem latex of Adenium obesum is used to prepare an arrow poison. Study have suggested antibacterial, anticancer, antiviral, trypanocidal, acaricidal, antioxidant, molluscicidal, piscicidal, antibiotic, anesthetic, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nAglaonema commutatum is commonly known as Chinese evergreen. It is native to the Philippines and north-eastern Sulawesi. The plant typically grows to 20 tall in primary forests along streams. A. commutatum has leaves that are thick, elliptic to lance-shaped, dark green (4 to 8 in length, and 2 to 3 in width) with attractive silver-gray blotches on erect, sometimes branched stems. This plant species also rarely flowers. Each of its axillary flowers features a small creamy white spadix enclosed by a pale green and spathe that is usually in late summer to early fall. Red bundles of red berries follow the flowers. Aglaonema is considered as luck-bringing ornamental plant in Asia for centuries. However, A. commutatum can harm humans if they ingest or touch it because plant parts including flowers contain calcium oxalate crystals that can result in diarrhea, or dermatitis, respectively.\n\nAllamanda cathartica, or commonly known as Golden Trumpet, or Yellow Bell, is a genus of tropical, tender, perennial evergreen. The plant is native to South America including Brazil, French Guiana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Outside its native range, it is widely naturalized and cultivated as an ornamental in warm, tropical and subtropical climates around the world including the Philippines. The large flowers (7-11 cm long and 5-7.5 cm wide) have five bright yellow petals that are fused together at the base to form a tube (i.e. corolla tube) about 4-8 cm long. This tube has reddish markings on the inside and is topped with five spreading petal lobes.\n\nAnd love builds a garden as these flowers belonging to the Araceae family with their foliage's waxy aesthetics, heart-shaped spathe (similar to Flamigo's), and spadix structure grew from the ground up. The genus Anthurium consists of herbaceous perennial flowering epiphytes, or terrestrial plants with 1,000 known species that are native to the tropical regions of Central and South America since they require warm temperatures, high humidity, and indirect sunlight to thrive. Its most common and popular species is the Anthurium andraeanum, which can reach a height of about 30 to 50 cm, and spreads for around 20 to 30 cm. Based on its appearance, the flower-like structure which surrounds the spadix contains the actual axillary hermaphroditic flowers, and is actually a modified leaf. Gopaulchan et. al. (2021) affirm that the Anthurium andraeanum's flower is often small and densely packed on the spadix inflorescence, which is cream-yellow tail-like and bright red spathe. Furthermore, A. andraeanum comes in a variety of colors such as shades of red (specimen), green, white, and even pink with a glossy, shiny appearance accompanied by sweet nectar, which attracts pollinators, birds and insects alike, a key element in their propagation through division or seed production (Li et. al., 2018). The optimal condition of an environment for Anthurium andraenum's growth and development should have well-drained soil and enough water. These ornamental flowers are grown for their vibrant and long-lasting flowers, aside from their air-purifying properties due to their capacity to help remove toxins from indoor environments. Despite their lively traits, A. andraeanum's flowers are utilized in flower arrangements, especially in funeral and condolences flower arrangements, known in Filipino as the \"Korona ng Patay,\" which consists of various assortments of flowers arranged in a wreath stand. Little is known about this flower's medical benefits, but they are traditionally believed to help in easing the pain of arthritis, and rheumatism by consuming the tea concoction made by boiling its stem.\n\nDon’t get confused when you see an aster to a daisy since both of them belong to the family of Asteraceae.

The species spreads by “stickers” (achenes) adhering to clothing, fur, and feathers. Stickers are also a nuisance to hikers, forest workers, and ranchers. Bidens pilosa is a representative perennial herb globally distributed across temperate and tropical regions. B. pilosa has been traditionally used in foods and medicines without obvious adverse effects. According to research, polyynes, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, fatty acids, and phenolics are the primary bioactive compounds of B. pilosa. They have been reported to be effective in treating tumors, inflammation or immune modulation, diabetes, viruses, microbes, protozoans, gastrointestinal diseases, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases.
