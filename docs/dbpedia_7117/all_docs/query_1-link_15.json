        "text": "STATEMENT BY H.E. EMMANUEL KWAME ASIEDU ANTWI, GHANA’S AMBASSADOR TO THE SWISS CONFEDERATION AND PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE TO THE UNITED NATIONS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS IN GENEVA, ON THE OCCASION OF THE SIXTY-SIXTH INDEPENDENCE ANNIVERSARY OF THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA- 6TH MARCH 2023\n\nOn the occasion of the 66th Independence Anniversary of our dear Motherland, Ghana, I extend warm wishes to all Ghanaians in Switzerland. 6th March reminds us of the sacrifices of our forebears who fought for our freedom and self-determination. Their sacrifices gave us a name which embodies our spirit of resilience and courage. Ghana! our motherland, our pride, our hope.\n\nOur path to independence was not an easy one and it is testament to the strength of the Ghanaian people. 6th March, 1957 marked a fresh start for our country and a break from colonialism. We cannot commemorate this momentous day without remembering our forebears like John Mensah Sarbah, Joseph Casely Hayford, J.W. Sey and J.P. Brown of the Aborigines Rights Protection Society; neither can we forget Joseph Boakye Danquah, Emmanuel Obetsebi Lamptey, William Ofori-Atta, Ebenezer Ako-Adjei, Edward Akufo-Addo and Kwame Nkrumah, who later broke away from the United Gold Coast Convention to lead the Convention People’s Party to eventually attain independence.\n\nWe also pay tribute to Mr. Philip Gbeho who composed the National Anthem; Theodosia Okoh who designed the National Flag and Mr. Amon Kotei who designed the Coat of Arms, among others. We also remember the three ex-servicemen, Sergeant Adjetey, Corporal Attipoe and Private Odartey Lamptey whose senseless killings by the colonial powers on 28th February, 1948, sparked a nationwide revulsion against the colonial powers, which, undoubtedly, quickened the pace of the independence movement.\n\nAs a country, we have come a long way and we should be proud, irrespective of our challenges. We must continue to cherish our freedom and remain united as we strive for prosperity. Since 1992, we have resolved to practice multi-party constitutional democracy which has guaranteed our individual freedoms under the rule of law. Ghana has therefore for the past three decades, witnessed the longest period of political stability and freedom which we must not take for granted.\n\nThe world today is facing many challenges. From a ravaging pandemic, to destructive wars and unprecedented natural disasters, which have impacted every nation one way or the other. This has greatly exposed the inequalities and vulnerabilities that persist in developing countries like ours.\n\nWe, as citizens must therefore work together to address these challenges and build a more equitable and resilient society for posterity.\n\nSince building a nation is a collective enterprise, Ghanaians in the diaspora need to join hands with compatriots back home to build the better Ghana that we all want for ourselves and our children yet unborn. Irrespective of our individual accomplishments or circumstances, our destiny as Ghanaians is bound up with our country. A prosperous and performing nation will elevate the status of all Ghanaians around the world.\n\nAs the flag of Ghana flies high today with pride, in commemoration of the 66th Anniversary of our independence, may we remain resolute and involved in building our motherland. May the Lord bless our homeland Ghana and continue to make her great and strong.\n\nLong live Ghana.\n\nGhana Permanent Mission\n\nGeneva"
