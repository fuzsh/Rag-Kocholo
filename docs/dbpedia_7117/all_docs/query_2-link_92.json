        "text": "1948 Accra riots\n\nThe Accra Riots started on 28 February 1948 in Accra, the capital of present-day Ghana, which at the time was the British colony of the Gold Coast. A protest march by unarmed ex-servicemen who were agitating for their benefits as veterans of World War II was broken up by police, leaving three leaders of the group dead. Among those killed was Sergeant Nii\n\nAdjetey,[1] who has since been memorialized in Accra.\n\nThe 28 February incident is considered \"the straw that broke the camel's back\", marking the beginning of the process of the Gold Coast towards being the first African colony to achieve independence, becoming Ghana on 6 March 1957.[2]\n\nIn January 1948, the Ga chief, Nii Kwabena Bonne III,[3] known in private life as Theodore Taylor (1888–1968),[4] had\n\nBackground\n\nThe march on 28 February 1948 was a peaceful attempt by former soldiers to bring a petition to the Governor of the Gold Coast requesting the dispensation of promised pensions and other compensation for their efforts during the war. The ex-servicemen were members of the Gold Coast Regiment, who were among the most decorated African soldiers, having fought alongside British troops in Burma. They had been promised pensions and jobs after the war; however, when they returned home, jobs were\n\nscarce and their pensions were never disbursed.\n\nAs the group marched toward the Governor's residence at Christiansborg Castle, they were stopped and confronted by the colonial police, who refused to let them pass. The British police Superintendent Imray ordered his subordinate to shoot at the protesters, but the man did not. Possibly in panic,[10] Imray grabbed the gun and shot at the leaders,[11] killing three former soldiers: Sergeant Adjetey, Corporal Attipoe, and Private Odartey Lamptey.[6] Apart from the\n\ncentre immediately, the conduct\n\nof masses now completely out of\n\ncontrol with strikes threatened\n\nin Police quarters, and rank and\n\nfile Police indifferent to orders of\n\nOfficers, will continue and result\n\nin worse violent and\n\nirresponsible acts by\n\nuncontrolled people.\" [13]\n\nThey also blamed the Governor Sir Gerald Creasy (whom they called \"Crazy Creasy\") for his handling of the country's\n\nproblems.[9] The UGCC cable further stated:\n\n\"Working Committee United\n\nGold Coast Convention declare\n\nthey are prepared and ready to\n\ntake over interim Government.\n\nWe ask in name of oppressed,\n\ninarticulate, misruled and\n\nmisgoverned people and their\n\nChiefs that Special\n\nCommissioner be sent out\n\nimmediately to hand over\n\nThe British colonial government set up the Watson Commission,[15][16][17] which examined the circumstances of the riots, and paved the way for constitutional changes that eventually culminated in Ghana's independence.\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the riots included the arrest on 12 March 1948 of \"the Big Six\" – Kwame Nkrumah and other leading activists in the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) party (namely Ebenezer Ako-Adjei, Edward Akufo-Addo,\n\nAftermath\n\nJ. B. Danquah, Emmanuel Obetsebi- Lamptey and William Ofori Atta),[18] who were held responsible for orchestrating the disturbances and were detained, before being released a month later. The arrest of the leaders of the UGCC raised the profile of the party around the country and made them national heroes.[19]\n\nThe Watson Commission reported that the 1946 constitution was inappropriate from the start, because it did not address the concerns of the natives of the Gold Coast. It also recommended that the Gold Coast be allowed to draft its own constitution. A\n\nleadership front of the UGCC.[19][21] On 6 March 1957, the country achieved its independence and was renamed Ghana, with Nkrumah as its first President.[13]\n\nAWAM has since become a term synonymous with cheating or profiteering in Ghana.
