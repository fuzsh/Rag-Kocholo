The Convention People's Party (CPP) was formed in 1949 in Ghana by Kwame Nkrumah after he broke from the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) party. Nkrumah organized the CPP to advocate for self-governance and independence from Britain. Through non-violent protests and mass support from Ghanaians, Nkrumah led Ghana to independence while in prison for his activism. The CPP went on to lead Ghana as a socialist one-party state until Nkrumah was ousted in a 1966 coup.",
