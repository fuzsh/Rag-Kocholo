        "text": "1: LABOR OFFICER\n\nOn 9th October 1952, I left Liverpool together with my wife and little son, Egya Akumbia, by the m.v. Aureol, one of the passenger ships belonging to Elder Dempster Lines, bound for Takoradi. The voyage was our first experience of travelling by boat on a long trip, traversing the Atlantic Ocean. With a one-year-old boy on our hands we could not imagine the kind of experience in store for us. Elsie and I had indeed crossed the English Channel before from Dover to the hook of Holland and also from Calais to Dover. On both occasions, we were sea sick. We were, therefore, terribly afraid that the long voyage would be irksome for us and our son.\n\nAs it turned out, we had the most delightful time on board. There were many West Africans who had completed their studies and were returning home to find jobs or go into professions. There were also British colonial officers returning to the “coast” from furlough. Consequently, Egya became a spoilt darling on board as the only back child among several white children. It was a joy to watch him playing with the other children and make incoherent noises understood only by children.\n\nThe first two days were rough at sea. We had a terrible crossing of the Bay of Biscayne. Therefore, some passengers kept to their beds with sea-sickness. Some of the faces I saw were sullen and apprehensive. But soon it was all over and the ship became alive with all sorts of activities.\n\nCompetitions were organized for deck tennis, quoits and table tennis. There were ???? nights and dancing parties. In sum, everything was done to make us feel comfortable and oblivious of the fact that we were at sea. Elsie and I enjoyed walking the decks and watching the billows as the ship plied along. Occasionally, we would sight another ship from far away and, on such occasions, the “Aureol” would hoot a siren in greeting which would be reciprocated by the other ship. I also entered the table tennis competition and won my way to the finals, which I played against a gregarious and fine Nigerian gentleman, Michael Olunnide. I won the competition and get a beer tankard which I still keep. Several years later, Michael and I became golfing companions in New York City. When I saw him again in 1984, he had retired from broadcasting with the Voice of Nigeria and had established a second home near Brighton with his English wife.\n\nThe “Aureol’s” first port of call was at Banjul, then called Bathurst, in the Gambia. On board the ship, we had become friendly with Mr. Sey, a Gambian policeman, who was returning home to take charge of the Gambian Police Band. He kindly invited us ashore and to his home. There, he treated us to a sumptuous meal of jolloff rice. Then he took us around sightseeing before we rejoined the ship.\n\nOur next port of call was Freetown in Sierra Leone. Even before the ship docked, there were several young swimmers performing all kinds of acrobatic feats in the sea. It was exciting to see these boys dive to retrieve coins which passengers threw into the sea from the deck. They were undoubtedly expert divers and gave us free entertainment which from our vantage points resembled the diving of the porpoises we had earlier on watched with admiration.\n\nAfter Freetown, we began to feel some excitement welling up in us. We would soon see the Gold Coast shores and so home. Indeed, within three days, the ship docked at Takoradi Harbor. It had taken us twelve long but exciting days to do the voyage from England. As we disembarked, we sighted a large group of relatives who had travelled from Winneba and Sekondi to meet us. We also saw a brass band playing. But that was not for our benefit. It had been arranged for one of the passengers who had apparently been away from the Gold Coast for ten years and had come back home as a medical doctor! It was a hilarious homecoming for those of us who disembarked at Takoradi. The ship’s last port of call would be Lagos (Apapa) where the largest contingent of Nigerian passengers would disembark.\n\nApart from relatives who had come to take us home by special transport, there was also an official from the Social Welfare Department who had met us to ensure that our luggage was properly handled through customs, and to inform us that we were entitled to one month’s disembarkation leave before we reported to the Government authorities.\n\nI was at the time of my arrival in the Gold Coast not certain what I wanted to do. Although I was not bonded by the scholarship I won, I thought it would be wise to let the powers that be know that I had arrived from England. Of course, reports regarding my performance at Oxford had already been forwarded to the Gold Coast by the Colonial Office. I had obtained my B.A. Hons. (Oxon) degree and therefore I was a “scarce commodity” in the labor market. I had an aunt, my father’s younger sister, who was insistent that I should apply for a managerial post with the United Africa Company (UAC), as that would afford her an opportunity of obtaining merchandise for her trading purposes. My maternal grandfather, on the other hand, felt strongly that I should re-enter the Civil Service, and gain experience before I plunged into politics, which was really my first choice of occupation. Thus, unlike the generality of my compatriots who found it difficult to find jobs, I was lucky to pick and choose what to do.\n\nFrankly, it must be recorded that in those days before independence and even now, to some extent, it was an uphill task for the youth to choose a career. In many cases, he had no option whatsoever. For a young lady it was the fashion to become a nurse, or midwife, or a telephonist, or a teacher, or a housewife. The young man had rather limited opportunities, especially when he had not succeeded in passing through elementary school, let alone obtain a secondary school leaving certificate.\n\nTo be candid, I believe that farming or fishing would have been a laudable and lucrative occupation for any ambitious youth who had completed elementary or secondary school. But the educational system was not really oriented to encourage the youth in the rural areas. The common outlook was that farming or fishing was an occupation fit for the illiterate and the old. Of course, it was the children or nephews of cocoa farmers in those days who became lawyers. There was an unstoppable drift of the youth to the urban centers, creating large pools of underemployment. Even skilled trade like carpentry, bricklaying, blacksmithery, and mechanical fitting were not popular with most school leavers. Not until the establishment of trade schools, like that at Asuamantse, did elementary school leavers feel encouraged to learn skills.\n\nThis is not to say that efforts were not made in the elementary schools to inculcate the high ideals of the dignity of labor. In fact, the school timetable provided for school gardening and handicrafts. But what was at stake was that no serious effort at job counseling was made and school leavers roamed at will looking for clerical jobs which were not available. This was to become a disgusting tragedy for Ghana which, since independence has suffered from a real dearth of intermediate skilled workers between the unskilled or semi-skilled workers and the top engineers or technical experts.\n\nThus, after the elementary school, the vast majority of elementary school leavers did not have the benefit of secondary school education. A small percentage of school leavers went to secondary schools, teacher training colleges or trade schools. The many technical schools and polytechnics and technical/secondary schools are latter-day additions to the educational systems to meet the growing demand for intermediate skilled personnel. Such was the limited availability of opportunities and facilities in those days that a school leaver simply had no choice. Financial constraints also played a major role. To relieve their back-breaking drudgery, parents were anxious for their children to find whatever jobs were going in order to earn some regular monthly income.\n\nAmidst all this gloom the bright or intelligent students received scholarship, bursaries or grants from the central government, a missionary establishment or some rich and forward-looking local council like the Asanteman Council in Kumasi. What is more, some parents struggled hard to see their children or wards through secondary schools and higher institutions overseas. It is such parents who, long before the 1950s when the central government decided to train solicitors, per se, sent their children overseas since the 19th century to qualify as barristers-at-law. If lawyers then became a privileged group in the Ghanaian society, there should be no complaint. And yet a time came when there was a general outcry against lawyers and other professional men like doctors of medicine, architects, engineers and accountants.\n\nSo far, I have been painting a certain background against which my own training and career could be viewed. I have dealt largely on the period before 1949 when educational facilities were limited and job opportunities were few. After the accelerated educational program introduced by the Nkrumah regime in 1951 and the establishment of the University College of the Gold Coast at Legon in 1949, school leavers could face a brighter future. More and more primary and middle schools reached the rural areas. Teacher training colleges mushroomed to train more teachers for these schools. Technical schools and trade schools were opened and a concerted effort was made to direct elementary school leavers to such institutions. Then there was instituted the Cocoa Marketing Board scholarship scheme from which children and the youth benefited as they received bursaries to secondary schools and universities at home and abroad. It was during the period of Kwame Nkrumah’s government that there was a massive drive to educate the youth.\n\nEvery home in Ghana was affected by the educational revolution, when students were sent overseas to the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries, to Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada to do medicine, engineering, architecture and all kinds of professional training and trades.\n\nI belonged to the generation before the educational revolution launched by the Nkrumah regime. Even so, my generation reaped the whirlwind of the colonial government’s genuine attempts after the Second World War to produce efficient administrators, scientists and engineers, in an effort to prepare the Gold Coast, so it was said, for independence. But in my time, quite a number of students from the elementary and secondary schools who with some financial assistance could have gone on to greater things, fell by the wayside. A student had to be of scholarship vintage or must have had parents with enough financial resources to help him in his education before he could achieve. Otherwise, lurking ambitions simply did not blossom. Aptly could one quote that:\n\n“Full many a gem of purest serene,\n\nThe dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear\n\nFull many a flower is born to blush unseen\n\nAnd waste its sweetness in the desert air.”\n\nI was one of the few young men on whom fortune smiled. As I have already recounted, soon after leaving Achimota College, I became a second division clerk at the Secretariat at Accra on a salary of 120 pounds per annum which was supposed to be handsome for an African. A European in an executive position earned 450 pounds per annum. My counterpart who started working in the civil service after leaving the secondary school earned 72 pounds per annum.\n\nWhen I returned from Oxford University on 21st October 1952, I took my grandfather’s advice and decided to see Mr. Amishadai Larsen Adu, who was then Commissioner of Africanisation in the Establishment Department of the Civil Service. This was my first meeting with the man who was bound to influence my career and my life in many respects. He welcomed me warmly and congratulated me on my academic success. He then informed me that I had been slated for the Administrative class and I was to proceed to Ho, in the Volta region of Ghana as a Cadet Government Agent. I politely asked Mr. Adu whether I could have a choice of department. The point was that my friend, Richard A. Quarshie whom I had met at Oxford where he was doing the Devonshire course for senior civil servants, had suggested the Labor Department to me. He himself was a Senior Labor Officer and he believed that I would be more useful as a Labor Officer.\n\nWhen I intimated that I would prefer to join the Labor Department, Mr. Adu gave me a kind smile and said that I would be one of only four graduates in that department which was full of ex-servicemen. “But I am sure”, Mr. Adu said, “that Jimmy Phillips will be pleased to have an Oxford graduate in the Labor Department. He himself went to Cambridge. Let me ring the Commissioner of Labor.” He duly rang the Commissioner, a Welsh Trade Unionist called “Taffy” Jones and, from the conversation, I could gather that I had been accepted at the Labor Department. Mr. Adu gave me a note for Mr. Jones. I was pleasantly surprised that Mr. Adu had not objected to my choice of occupation. The man was perspicacious enough to understand that I had to be occupied where I could give of my best.\n\nMy interview with the Commissioner was brief but harmonious. He told me that he needed a young graduate like me in his department and exhorted me to work hard and follow the footsteps of the Senior Labor Officer, Mr. J.V.L. Phillips. He introduced me to the deputy Commissioner, Mr. J. B. Heigham, a Cambridge graduate who received me readily. The third graduate in the department, also a Senior Labor Officer, was Mr. J. S. Annan, an electrical engineer whose trade union activities in the Gold Coast decided the colonial administration to appoint him a Labor Officer.\n\nI started work on the very day of my interview with the Commissioner. I had to prove myself. I was employed as an Assistant Labor Officer on a salary of 650 pounds per annum in October 1952. After a stint at the head office in Accra, I was posted to Sekondi-Takoradi in January 1953. I worked directly under the Regional Labor Officer, Major S. Mackenzie, an ex-serviceman who was forthright in his manners but was fond of using swear words as was the worst of most soldiers. He was very concerned about youth employment and productivity and he specifically instructed me to pay particular attention to these matters in my work with workers and employers.\n\nTakoradi was a busy port and had attracted quite a large number of school leavers and others from the rural areas. Most of these boys called themselves “pilot boys”, whose main ambition was to join a ship and become a seaman. Crime including petty thieving, robbery and prostitution abounded in Takoradi, like any harbor anywhere. But these boys belonged to one of the most organized unions at the time, “The Maritime and Dockworkers Union”.\n\nMy duties as a Labor Officer were to assist in organizing unions, mostly house unions; conciliate in labor disputes between workers and employers; to inspect work places and factories and to check the work of labor inspectors in the Sekondi district which included the Labor Office in Cape Coast in the Central Region.\n\nWith the exception of the Gold Coast Miners Workers Union, the Railway Workers Union and the Maritime and Dockworkers Union, most trade unions in my time were “house unions” confined to their particular employment. My task was to advise workers to think in terms of national unions embracing workers in a specific line of employment. Instead of organizing the Union Trading Company (UTC) Workers Uion, for example, all the workers in the commercial establishments could form the National Commercial and General Workers Union. The workers responded slowly to the proddings of the Labor Officers. It was also my task to explain to workers the necessity of exhausting all avenues open to them for negotiation before they embarked on a strick action. Where they failed to get redress through negotiation, I advised them to permit me to conciliate or request for arbitration rather than go on strike. There could be a trade dispute without necessarily resorting to the strike weapon, which I advised, should be used as a last resort. Thus, in the final analysis, the success of a labor officer depended upon his ability to prevent a strike, or in the event of a strick upon how quickly he could conciliate between workers and employers to enable them to reach an amicable and acceptable settlement of their trade dispute.\n\nMajor Mackenzie really gave me a free hand to handle management and the unions, and I only reported where I faced problems, especially from management, which in those days, was mostly expatriate. I often ran the risk of being suspected by both workers and employers: workers becausethey had heard that I had studied in the United Kingdom and they erroneously believed that I would be on the side of the expatriate employers; and by the employers because I was an African. I somehow managed to dispel these suspicions quickly by always insisting on justice and fair play and by my personal contacts. I got on mightily with both sides.\n\nOne of the most radical unions in the country at that time was the Maritime and Dockworkers Union whose General Secretary was a young man called Kojo Addison. He had affected a Lenin-style beard and was parading as a Marxist. I enjoyed going to his union headquarters on Sarbah Road where there were always crowds of “pilot boys”, seamen and girls. I goaded him into discussing Marxism and when he realized that I had strong socialist views, he had complete confidence in me. He consulted me on a number of matters such as registering workers for employment at the docks or for getting assignments to ships, and how to get his union members to pay their monthly dues regularly. There was no trouble from the maritime workers while I was at Sekondi-Takoradi.\n\nBut I had trouble from the Sanitary Workers Union, which consisted of workers who weeded public places and cleaned open gutters and removed the “night soil” and rubbish from dust bins. The secretary of the union was a man called Yaro de man who I found difficult to handle. He was very much aware of the bargaining strength of his union and tried to exploit it at every turn. One day, Major Mackenzie rang to inform me that the Medical Officer of Health had reported a cat strike by the sanitary workers. I rushed to the scene of action at once and sought for Mr. Yaro. I had always felt that the lot of sanitary workers in the country was miserable and needed amelioration. For one thing, it was a crying shame that the Gold Coast did not have a good sewer system and that the government and the people were still employing workers to remove “night soil” instead of these workers working on farms and producing food or cash crops. The whole system was anathema to the people of Ghana.\n\nTherefore, I was at pains to convince Mr. Yaro that a refusal to remove “night soil” was not enough. It posed a danger to the health of the community, but then if they should go on strike, the objective was to prevail upon the government and employers to introduce a better system of sewage, like septic latrines or flush systems. To strike for more money or for the reinstatement of a dismissed worker did not answer the problem. On this occasion, a worker had, indeed, been dismissed for delinquency. Yaro de man had acquiesced in the cat strike without proper consultations or negotiations. He was a powerful trade unionist, always suspicious and seemingly intractable in his dealings with employers. When I intervened, he was still adamant and stated categorically that the strike would continue until the worker involved had been reinstated. I then talked to the head of the health department. He was also adamant: the worker had been delinquent and when questioned, he had shown insubordination to a senior officer. Of course, I pointed out the danger of pollution and an epidemic facing the community. In the premise, I suggested that instead of dismissal, the worker in question should be suspended for a week. This would be a compromise. The health officer agreed. Surprisingly, when I sold the compromise to Mr. Yaro, he also bought it. The strike was thus averted!\n\nBy this time, I had spent six months in the Sekondi-Takoradi district and I had settled down to orderly progress in my work. My study of workers’ attitudes had convinced me that they were not so much concerned about producing and improving their productivity as they were about survival by way of increased earnings. Therefore, I lectured union members on productivity. If they wanted to improve their bargaining power they should increase their output of work. What was important was real income, that is, what their wages could buy and not what they earned as such. If they organized their unions properly against the background of increased production, they would be stronger. I did not make much headway with them because they did not care about productivity and increased output. In those days, food was abundant and comparatively cheap, and with prudent management, a worker with an industrious wife could make ends meet. My lecture on productivity, minimum wage, strong bargaiing power and subsistence level was all an exercise in futility in the early 1950s.\n\nAfter six months’ stay in Sekondi-Takoradi, I was posted to Tarkwa as a Labor Officer. But before I left there was a strike on my hands. On the coronation day of Queen Elizabeth II of England, the Municipal and Transport Workers at Sekondi went on strike over the dismissal of two of their colleagues. Thus, instead of sitting by my radio with my family listening to the coronation ceremonial proceedings, I was busy settling a strike. My presence as a Labor Officer at the scene of the strike heightened the pandemonium. But soon I was joined by Mr. Arthur, who later became the Regional Commissioner of the Western Region. Between the two of us we succeeded in getting the Municipal Council and the workers to agree on a settlement. Actually, we pleaded that the two workers involved should be reinstated with a strong warning to the union that government would not tolerate strikes without proper negotiation and conciliation, and that workers should exhaust all avenues of reaching a settlement with their employers before they called a strike. Independence, we insisted, was around the corner and the country would need a strong but responsible trade union movement. Two days later, I left for Tarkwa.\n\nTarkwa and its environs were famous for their mineral wealth. There were gold mines at Tarkwa, Aboso, Abontiaksu, Bogoso and Prestea; manganese at Nsuta and diamond at Dompim, Simpa and all over the Wassa Fiase traditional area. At Awaso, some eighty miles away was bauxite, mined by the British Aluminium Company. There was also a comparatively smaller gold mine at Bebiani. Apart from the mineral wealth, the Tarkwa area abounded in forests. And so, at Sambreboi there was a large, prosperous timber industry, run by the African Plywood and Veneer Company.\n\nThe Tarkwa area had, therefore, attracted workers from all over Ghana. Apart from workers in the various mines there were all kinds of people, including Nigerians and other West Africans, who were diamond “diggers” and “winners.” There was really a large working population in Tarkwa and also a large contingent of Europeans and white South Africans who had come to Tarkwa looking for the “Eldorado.”\n\nTarkwa was the headquarters of the Gold Coast Mines Workers Union, one of the most powerful and well-organized trade unions in the country. Its President was Mr. Kofi Foevie, easily one of the strongest pillars of the trade union movement. The workers had a reputation for toughness and intransigence. Therefore, the Tarkwa district, as a whole, was manned by seasoned officers. As a Labour Officer, it was a testing place. It could make or mar many an officer.\n\nMy family and I were housed at a bungalow on the hill in the Tarkwa residential area. The family consisted of my wife and my two sons (the second boy, Nana Bodo, had been born on 23rd December 1952 at Winneba) and myself. We were later joined by my younger brother, Frank, who was at school. We settled down quite comfortably in our new home. What was frightening for us at Tarkwa was the incessant thunder and lightning. When there was thunder, it really thundered, shaking the whole place. And when it rained, it was a real tropical downpour.\n\nLife was generally supportable. We were lucky in our colleagues from other Government establishments. For our next door neighbors, we had Theophilus Tawia and his delightful family. Dr. Tawia was a lively and jovial gentleman who was the Health Superintendent of the Tarkwa District. Dr. Emmanuel Evans-Anfom was the Medical Officer. He and his wife Leo became our good friends. The Superintendent of Police was Mr. E. T. Madjitey, who eventually became the first Ghanaian Commissioner of Police and ended up as a Member of Parliament and the Leader of Opposition during the Second Republic of Ghana. The Assistant Superintendent of Police was Mr. John Harley, who also rose to become the Commissioner of Police and the first Inspector General of Police (IGP). He became the chief schemer and architect in the overthrow of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, the first President of Ghana on 24th February 1966. The Police Inspector at this time was Mr. Ben Forjoe. He became the Director of Passport when I was Minister of Foreign Affairs and in 1979 when Flight Lieutenant Rawlings seized power for the first time, Mr. Forjoe became the Minister of Interior! It was at Tarkwa, therefore, that we started to have a solid family life, having moved from place to place at short intervals.\n\nAlas! As it had happened, we had to stay at Tarkwa for about a year. But it was a busy period for me as a Labour Officer. Apart from the big mines and timber industries dotted around, there were the small businesses and factories which demanded the attention of the Labour Officer. Thus, in addition to trade union organization, negotiation, conciliation and arbitration duties, I was also a factory inspector and had to supervise the Employment Exchange which, in my time, was in the very capable hands of Mr. Akumia.\n\nIn the course of inspecting factories, I had to go down a gold mine to look at the safety devices and other measures taken to insure the safety and protection of workers. I went down a shaft in a big elevator at Abontiakom, accompanied by a South African foreman. We got down to about two thousand feet and went on a trolley on a fail which took us to several parts of the underground. We entered a mine with its roof supported by solid sticks. Dynamite was used to blast the rock and the stones were scooped out leaving a space like a cave. My South African companion and I crawled on our bellies in one of such caves, wearing steel helmets and finding our way by torch lights. We crawled a few years but for me it felt like having crawled a whole fifty yards. It was an ordeal by choice. Since then I had nursed a lot of reverence for miners.\n\nMy duties entailed quite a lot of “trekking”. In those days, most of the roads were latrite and some were quite rough which we dubbed as corrugated roads. I used to drive a Vanguard Estate car which specifically been designed for rough roads. I had quite a sizable area to cover as my jurisdiction – from Tarkwa to Bogoso, Asamkragwa, Sambreboi, Prestea, Awaso, Bebiani, Dunkwa-on-the-Offin, Safwi Wiawso, Safwi Bekwai, Enchi, Half-Assini and Atoabo. Very often, I slept the night at some outlandish rest house. Sometimes, I had two punctures on one journey and I had to solicit the help of timber truck drivers to take me to the nearest vulcanizer. Invariably, I was returned home laden with red dust. It was all a great challenge for me.\n\nI found time during my stay at Tarkwa to be a lecturer for the People’s Education Association (PEA) in Government and Economics. I held classes at Tarkwa and Simpa. Some of my students gained by the lectures I gave and proceeded to further their education abroad during the scholarship boom of the Nkrumah era.\n\nAs I lectured, I also wrote. One of the articles I wrote for the dailies in 1954 was about the constitution of an independent Gold Coast. I was then concerned about the role our chiefs should play in politics. I thought that there was in Ghana a traditional authority represented by the chiefs and an elected authority represented by politicians. Therefore, in my article which was fully published by the Ashanti Pioneer, I advocated that the Prime Minister should perforce be a politician, an elected representative, but the Head of State should be a ceremonial President held by a Paramount Chief. I wrote that the post of President should rotate every four years among the presidents of the various regional houses of chiefs in the country. I suggested that the first ceremonial President or Head of State should be the Asantehene (the King of the Ashanti); after four years, he should be succeeded by the president of the central region house of chiefs and so on in alphabetical order of regions.\n\nThe article caused a furor among the politicians and my name was mentioned in the National Assembly as having arrogated to myself the role of a constitutional expert. Quite naturally, the Commissioner of Labor was questioned about me and he sent me a warning through the regional labor officer that as a civil servant, I should not meddle in politics. I could not fathom, quite frankly, how an expression of a constitutional opinion could be regarded as meddling in politics. But I had to succumb to superior authority.\n\nI cannot possibly end this part of my career as a Labor Officer without mentioning two important national assignments which I undertook before I left Tarkwa. One was my appointment as the Secretary of an Arbitration Committee appointed by the Government to arbitrate the Bibiani Gold Mines dispute and report. The Chairman was Mr. Gwira, a noted Barrister-at-Law and the members were the Chief of Sharma, Nana Kow Freku, and Mr. F. E. Tachie-Mension, a trade unionist. The Government felt compelled to appoint this committee because, as a result of a strike by the Bibiani Mines Workers, the employers had closed the mine completely, pleading unprofitability of the mines as an excuse. With such a large labor force laid off when the General Elections of 1954 were in the offing, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, the Leader of Government Business had to act swiftly. Nkrumah’s Convention People’s Party (CPP) faced a strong challenge by the Opposition United Party which had a massive following in the Ashanti Region.\n\nThe task of the committee was to investigate root causes of the dispute, settle it through arbitration and report to the Government. As Secretary of the Committee, I was responsible for all arrangements of its sittings and for writing the report based on the proceedings. We held meetings at Sekondi and Bibiani. The Mines Workers Union had engaged the services of Mr. James Mercer, a renowned barrister-at-law at the Sekondi Bar, and the Mines Employers engaged a firm of solicitors, Giles Hunt & Co. Both sides put their cases succinctly. It was clear that the workers were really receiving shabby treatment from their white foremen and that, in most cases, the top management did not know what was going on, as far as industrial and human relations were concerned. It was also true that the Bibiani Mines had become less and less profitable. The issue was how to save the mines by an infusion of investment and how to increase productivity.\n\nHowever, the Committee was overtaken by events. General Elections had meantime been held and the CPP had won a landslide victory. Mr. F.E. Tachie-Menson, the trade unionist member of the Arbitration Committee had been returned unopposed to Parliament by the Dunkwa constituency. With the establishment of a new CPP cabinet, I had to submit an interim report to the Commissioner of Labor for onward transmission to Government. I myself received instructions from my Commissioner to prepare for an overseas labor officers’ course. As far as I can remember, the Bibiani mines remained closed for some time.\n\nThe other assignment proved the more difficult of the two. The bauxite workers at Awaso went on strike, claiming a wage increase, which the British Aluminium Company, the employers, had refused to countenance. There had been no proper attempt at negotiations. I travelled to Awaso. There I met the management who claimed that the wages and salaries they had paid their employees compared favorably to what the mines paid their workers with similar skills and training. I then met the Union leaders. They told me that the workers needed a wage increase because they did not receive any bonus paid for excellent work and their living conditions were poor as compared to other mines. They agreed with me that what they should demand was the payment of the annual bonus and the provision of better amenities at their living quarters.\n\nArmed with the workers’ new stance, I arranged a meeting between the executive of the union and the management. A settlement was hammered out which satisfied both sides. I was pleased with my success, because strikes at the mines had an uncanny means of spreading or protracting. I had contined this one. I returned to Tarkwa.\n\nNo sooner hadh I settled down to other duties than I was summoned to Sekondi to meet Major Mackenzie, my regional boss. He informed me that he had been contacted by the management of the British Aluminium Company that there had been a fresh outbreak of a strike at Awaso. Apparently, one of the workers had been called a “black monkey” by a white foreman. Because of this insult, the other workers in the same workshop as the person insulted had “downed their tools” in retaliation without reference to the union executive or the management. News of this workshop incident had spread like wildfire and all the workers at Awaso had stopped work in sympathy. Major Mackenzie admitted that I faced an ugly situation and so, if necessary, I should solicit the help of a veteran trade unionist by name Anthony Kobina Woode who at that time resided at Esikado in Sekondi.\n\nMr. Kobina Woode was a CPP activist in addition to being a trade unionist. I had known and assessed him when I served at Sekondi-Takoradi. He was a shrewd politician full of native wit, but like most party activists during that period, he could only survive politically by indulging in back-stair intrigues. He had, h owever, come to grief when I contacted him about the troubles at Awaso.\n\nMr. Woode and his close associate and comrade, Mr. Turkson Ocran, had been sent by the CPP as delegates to a Socialist International conference in Vienna, but had proceeded to Eastern Europe without authorization from Accra. At that time, the Colonial Office, which controlled the external affairs of the Gold coast, did not take kindly to this adventure by the two CPP activists into the communist camp and informed the Governor of the Gold Coast. Kwame Nkrumah, then Leader of Government Business, did not like this open adventure of the young men, as it might upset plans for the independence of Ghana, and so he ordered that the passports of Mr. Woode and Mr. Ocran should be seized. They were put on the carpet! Mr. Woode had not quite recovered from this jolt to his career when I approached him to accompany me to Awaso to help me settle this “black monkey” strike.\n\nWe travelled to Awaso only to discover that the strike ha become complicated by a demand of the workers engaged in by one of their number, named Mr. Kofi Darkwa, that the company should pay the local chief an increase in the royalty paid yearly for mining the bauxite on their chief’s ancestral land. Mr. Darkwa happened to be a CPP activist who nursed high political ambitions. He was taking an advantage of an otherwise explosive situation to feather his own nest, because payment of a royalty was a completely different matter and could not be the cause of an industrial dispute, or so I thought. I would learn later that where politics is involved any issue could be exploited.\n\nFor sure, no employer, white or yellow , had any right to insult an African worker or any other African at all a “black monkey”. I was myself cut to the quick by this insult, but I was a labor officer determined to bring about harmonious industrial relations and, in this case, proper race and human relations. This incident naturally made me to recall Mr. David Jenkins’s letter of apology that he ahd been brought up as a child to look down upon people of color. After all, as research sponsored by the United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) have proved, “race is less a biological fact than a social myth.” The African’s courtesy, tolerance, ready smile and warmth of friendship towards other peoples should not be construed as servility. The white foreman at the British Aluminium Company had clearly overstepped his bounds. He had no understanding of the dignity and worth of the human person. I was determined to point out the damage he had caused to the smooth working of his company, but I equally decided that the question of royalty was purely a matter between the Chief’s Council and the Company.\n\nMr. Woode and I had arrived in the evening but we quickly arranged for the members of the executive of the Awaso branch of the Mines Workers Union to meet us at the rest house where I had stayed. As it transpired later, my bungalow was the last place I should have met the union leaders, because theywere later accused of having sold out. The leaders, in any case, had agreed that the workers should resume work on condition that the white foreman rendered a qualified written aplogy to the worker whose pride and personality had been wounded. I was also requested by the union to berate him for bad manners and to ask him to desist from using such insults in the future. As regard the question of royalty, the union leaders maintained that the Company had cheated the African for too long and they should be made to increase the rate of royalty paid to the chief and his people, even though they had been paying some taxes to the Central Government. After much heated discussion, the Union leaders agreed to advise the chief and his elders to initiate negotiations with the British Aluminium Company, provided I was prepared to render assistance to the chief, if necessary.\n\nOn the following day, I met the company’s representatives, including the General Manager. They readily agreed that an awkward situation had been created by the foreman’s calling the African employee “black monkey”. The foreman concerned explained that he had been using such swear words to his African friends, but on that particular occasion when he used the expression complained of, he had been provoked. In fact, the African who had been insulted, had also used the term “white monkey” in the ensuing altercations between him and the workers present at the workshop. His explanation was not accepted and the Company ordered him to write the written apology as demanded by the Union.\n\nAs regards the payment of an increase in royalty to the chief, the Company informed me that the payment of royalty had already been agreed by the Company and the chief’s ancestor, and there was no way by which either party to the agreement could renege on their undertaking. “Pacta servanda sunt” (“agreements must be observed”) was their stand and they would not budge. I pointed out to the Company that a number of the workers were citizens of Awaso and also subjects of the chief and so the Company stood to gain, in the long run, if they agreed to a frank discussion on the issue with the chief and his elders. The Company agreed to talk to the chief.\n\nFortified in my conviction that the workers’ demands had all been met, I decdied to address the Union in conclave. The turnout was big. The workers and even officious bystanders gathered to hear what this Labor Officer had up his sleeve. Flanked by the Union leaders on a makeshift platform, I began to explain issues. I had barely uttered two sentences when someone shouted “we no hear Oxford English.” It was Mr. Darkwa, the party activist. People began to clap and shout. Having learnt the trick at a similar gathering of workers elsewhere, I shouted back “Make I broke ‘em” – (may I speak “broken” or pidgin English?). There was a thunderous shout in reply: “Broke ‘em” (speak pidgin English). I mustered all the ingenuity and courage at my command and spoke slowly in a language which must have been understood by all, because there were intermittent applauses and shouts of approval as I explained the agreement concluded between the Union leaders and the Company. Most of the workers were illiterate and came from various parts of the country, particularly northern Ghana, which was called the Northern Territories (NTS) before the independence of Ghana.\n\nHowever, not all was smooth. In the course of my explanation of the agreement, the same Mr. Darkwa shouted at the Union leaders “stooges”. He had apparently tried to convince the workers before the rally that the executive committee members had met me and Mr. Woode the previous night at my bungalow and so they had been “bought.” I countered it by telling the workers that as a Labor Officer I had the workers’ supreme interest at heart but it was also my duty to maintain good human and industrial relations with the workers, in the interest of the mines’ operations and the country. I explained that the Company had been annoyed by the abusive words used by the foreman and had sternly warned him. He had been ordered to write to the worker concerned conveying his apology. I then waved the letter of apology amidst shouts of approval. I also explained that the chief and his elders on the one hand, and the Company on the other, had agreed to start negotiations on the increase in royalty. There was a great cheer. Many workers rushed to greet and shake my hand. The strike was over. I returned to Tarkwa.\n\nApparently after I had returned to my station the worker/politician who was, in fact, a strong activist of the local branch of the Convention Peoples Party did not rest on his oars. He was determined to take over the leadership of the Union. I thought Mr. Darkwa would create difficulties for the Company in the matter of the increase in royalty to the chief with whom Mr. Darkwa was on close terms. I soon heard that Mr. Darkwa had been elected General Secretary at an emergency meeting of the Union, contrary to union rules, because branch elections had to be held once annually. But then the workers had been urged to express a vote of no confidence in their executive committee and fresh elections had been held. As soon as Mr. Darkwa got into the saddle, he got the workers to demand that the white foreman should be deported because the insult of “black monkey” rankled. As for the increase in royalty the workers, with the connivance of some politicians, demanded that the increase in royalty should be paid promptly so that social amenities could be provided for the people by the traditional council.\n\nI had by this time received a letter from the new Ministry of Labor, set up after the 1954 General Elections, that I had been nominated by the Government to proceed to the United Kingdom initially to attend a conference on African administration at Cambridge University in August 1954 and afterwards undertake the Labor Officers’ course for three months organized at the instance of the colonial office. As I was about to leave Tarkwa, news reached me of a fresh outbreak of a strike at Awaso in which the newly-appointed Minister of Labor, Mr. A. E. Inkumsah had personally intervened. Politics had crept into the Awaso industrial relations but mercifully, I was out of the scene.\n\nWhilst I was a Labor Officer at Tarkwa, I was at pains to impress upon the mines employers and other big industrial establishments like the African Plywood and Veneer Company at Sambreboi, the need for the provision of improved social amenities for the workers. The gold mines and the manganese mine at Nsuta provided accommodation for their workers but living conditions I found were abominable. It was an eyesore to find a family of six crammed into one room. No wonder productivity was low all over. As compared to housing provided for the European or white South African in the mines or other business establishments, the African’s accommodation was poor. There were veritable slums in the mining areas, with all the attendant evils of drunkenness and prostitution. The British Aluminium Company at Awaso erred in the provision of adequate and decent housing for their employees. I had urged them during my visits to help workers educate their children and to provide better social amenities. Therefore, I was not surprised that Mr. Darkwa who was really intelligent and a concerned citizen took advantage of the prevailing conditions of inertia and indifference on the part of the aluminium company at Awaso. There was a protracted strike which must have hurt the company a lot, whatever huge profits that had been garnered in over the years.\n\nThe conference on African Administration was duly held at King’s College Cambridge in the third week of August, 1954. It was a great privilege for me to be part of the Gold Coast (Ghana) delegation of four, ably led by Mr. A. L. Adu, the Permanent Secretary of the Establishment nDepartment. The conference lasted for two weeks. Among a number of matters dealt with by the conference were central planning and its role in budgeting and economic development; the structure of the civil service, the importance of the general orders (G.O.s) and civil service procedures, and the relationship that had to subsist between civil servants and political heads of Ministries (that is, Ministers of State). The colonial territories in the British Empire sooner than later would attain independence and it was necessary that there should be in each territory an effective civil service manned by well-trained personnel. There were going to be conflicts between permanent or principal secretaries and Ministers of State, unless civil servants understood their roles in the new body politic.\n\nOne could only guess what would happen for, as Mr. A.L. Adu himself wrote later in the introduction to his book, “The Civil Service in New African States”. The complexities of policies in all spheres of government which results from the establishment of new nationalist governments demand the fashioning and installation of a new structure and machinery of government. This could not help but have the profoundest influence on the Civil Services, their organization and structure. The changes that have had to take place have, unfortunately, had to be so rapid as to make carefully considered long-term planning impracticable. It was impossible to foresee the pattern that would be forced on the services by constitutional developments mainly because these were themselves forced on the colonial powers and because also of the rapidity of changes. The Cambridge Conference on African Administration had anticipated what was bound to happen.\n\nFor me, the highlight of the conference was a visit to Earlow New Town, which was then under construction. What impressed me most of all was the construction of the infrastructure – streets, water, gas, electricity and other utilities, telephones, shops, a school, a hospital – before the residential houses were built. A few months later when I was in charge of manpower services in the Department of Labour at Accra, I was able to discuss meaningful suggestions with the town planners and architects of the new Tema township and port near Accra. The Conference itself was useful and instructive. I had met a number of administrative officers from all parts of the commonwealth whose experiences and views were to be of immense help to me in my civil service career.\n\nAfter the Cambridge Conference, I returned to London to attend the Labour Officers course. There were Labour Officers from Cyprus, Trinidad, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), Nigeria, Kenya and Tanganyika. We attended lectures on the British Trade Union movement. The Transport and General Workers Union and the National Union of Mines Workers (N.U.M.) were singled out for mention as two of the best0run unions in Britain at the time. Experts talked to us on the art of negotiation, conciliation and arbitration. We also studied the operation of manpower services with special emphasis on youth employment, to which friend and senior in the Labour Department, Mr. J. V. L. Philips, had requested me to pay particular attention during the course. We spent six weeks in the London area, learning all about industrial relations, factory inspection and employment services, including workmen’s compensation, wages policy and productivity. After the course in London, we were sent to various parts of Britain to see things for ourselves and acquire practical experience. We regrouped in London after six weeks in the “provinces” for an assessment of the course, before our departure to our various countries.\n\nThe tour outside London took me to Scotland – Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth and Aberdeen. At the Labour offices of these places, I performed various duties to acquire practical experience. I visited mines, factories, youth employment offices and some branch unions. I sat in and watched conciliation and arbitration at work. What I saw was not different from similar efforts at home, except that union leaders in Scotland behaved like experts at their work and faced employers at arms length with confidence and astuteness.\n\nIn all, I stayed in Scotland for six weeks. I was highly impressed by the friendliness of the Scots. I learnt that the youth formed a vital part of the community, and came away convinced that any nation which neglected their youth did so at their own peril. Not only were they future leaders, but the quality of their training determined the kind of society that would in future emerge. As I was supposed to pay particular attention to youth employment in Britain, I devoted much of my studies and work to youth recruitment, training within industry, and prospects open to those youth that did not have the benefit of higher education. I found that the standard of education in Scotland was very high, despite the large influx of Irish workers who were mostly u ntutored.\n\nBut all was not work. Whilst I was in Scotland, I had an opportunity to attend musical performances, visit pubs and see old friends. In Edinburgh were my friends Leo and Emmanuel Evans-Anfom, who it will be recalled, had been at Tarkwa while I was a Labour Officer there. Dr. Anfom had returned to Edinburgh, his old university, to do his fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons. He and Leo were very fond of music and they took me to a few concerts. There was also E. Kofi Newman, my classmate at Mfantsipim doing medicine. In Glasgow, I met another classmate from Mfantsipim, Harry Bart-Plange, and then Kwamena Derban, from Winneba, both were studying medicine at Glasgow University. They have since become accomplished specialists in the medical field.\n\nThe Labour Officers’ Course over, I returned to London for the final assessment together with my Labour colleagues who had returned from other parts of Britain. The three months’ course had been useful. We had filled in the various chinks in our armour, consolidated our experiences and acquired fresh ideas for future work.\n\nI spent the Christmas of 1954 in Birmingham with my friend, John Black and his parents. That was the period that by God’s amazing Grace, I had a serious discussion on religion with John’s father, resulting in my return to accept the Christian faith with conviction. After three years of remaining in a religious state of suspended animation and critical self-examination, I was born again as a Christian. It was with a warm and delightful heart that I left England in January, 1955 to return to Ghana, my family and my daily chores as a Labour Officer.,\n\nI had a delightful voyage on the motor vessel “Accra” belonging to the Elder Dempster Lines. I shared a cabin with a delightful person, Dr. Louis Simango, who had completed his medical course in England and was returning to Ghana. He was a quiet but amusing gentleman who insisted on our having “a quiet drink” before supper every evening of our twelve days’ voyage to Takoradi from Liverpool. As if providence had wanted us to continue our friendship, his first posting as a medical officer was at the Winneba General Hospital. The voyage itself was smooth and happy. On arrival, I was met by my wife and my six months’ old daughter, Awo Aferba, who had been born on 31st August, 1954 whilst I was at the Cambridge conference. The arrival of a daughter after my first two boys, Egya and Nana Bodo, was a very welcome event indeed.\n\nI was posted to the Labour Department at Accra where I had to act in the place of Leslie Saigh, a Senior Labour Officer in charge of manpower services who had returned to his native Englad on furlough. At the same time, I was to become Secretary to the newly-formed Cabinet Committee on Employment. But once again, God had something else in store for me. Barely six months after settling down to my new assignment, I was selected as one of eight officers from the civil service to be trained as diplomats for the future foreign and Commonwealth service of Ghana. This was in June 1955 and nobody in Ghana knew the exact date when Ghana would attain independent nationhood within the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Gold Coast was then passing through a transitional period from internal self-government to a fully independent and sovereign state. Dr. Kwame Nkrumah’s CPP had swept the polls in 1954 and he was poised to become the first Prime Minister of the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to become independent from colonial ful. He cooperated with Sir Arden Clarke, the colonial governor, who was an astute politician and an able administrator. At this time, the Trade Union Congress, whose members, especially the Railway Employees Union and the Mine Workers Union had supported the CPP to the hilt, had become restive. It was the task of the Ministry of Labour to help build a responsible and independent trade union movement. But then the conflict between the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on the international scene had manifested itself within the ranks of the unions in Ghana. The WFTU which was supposed to be communist-inspired was spreading literature full of Soviet anthology of hate. It was our task as Labour Officers to steer the trade unions in Ghana to the side of the ICFTU which was western-oriented.\n\nTherefore, at the elections for the presidency of the TUC in Kumasi, it was our back-stair prodding that helped secure the presidency for Mr. F.E. Tachie-Menson, then Secretary of the Posts and Telegraphs Workers Union which was patently pro-ICFTU. The candidate put forward by some unions at the instance of the extreme left of the CPP was John Tettegah, who was pro-WFTU. At the time of writing, Mr. John Tettegah is the Ghana Ambassador to Moscow, sent there by the Rawling regime.,\n\nIt would be recalled that it was soon after his appointment as a member of the Bibiani Mines Arbitration Committee that Mr. Techie-Menson was elected President of the TUC and was returnerd to Parliament unopposed. He was thus a heavyweight in every respect – a strong CPP member of Parliament, a close associate of Dr. Nkrumah, the Prime Minister, the President of the TUC, and he weighed sixteen stones!\n\nI was a Labour Officer for nearly three years. I learnt during that period that a labour officer had to win the confidence of both employers and works, a difficult feat the best of times, which yielded much fruit if accomplished successfully. I was then a socialist on the far left with the fire of social justice burning in my belly. I entertained no doubts that the Ghanaian worker needed a new deal and that the point of departure was his education. Almost to a man, the unskilled worker was illiterate. He had to be tutored to appreciate his rights as well as his responsibilities. He had to understand that by his efforts the reconstruction of his country was going on apace. Above all, he had to know that productivity was the key to economic development. I had, as a part-time lecturer for the Peoples Education Association attempted to impart such lessons to the workers in the industrial, mining and timber areas of the Tarkwa district. I had myself gained from my duties. I had learnt workers’ aspirations and the gnawing anxieties of employers and entrepreneurs. But certainly I had leearnt the art of diplomacy in my dealings with workers and employers. I had, indeed, come to have a full appreciation of the human nature.\n\nIt had been my plan that I would plunge into active politics after five years’ stay at the Labour department. But this did not materialize. For now, I had been chosen for training as a diplomatist, whoen I would study the art and science of diplomacy and practice it as well.\n\nCHAPTER 4 – OXFORD DAYS\n\nOn 29th August 1949, I left Accra for London with my colleagues, Patrick Anim and Kenneth Dadzie by an Argonaut airplane called R. M. A. Manton. It took us 24 hours to travel from Accra to London, instead of the 6 hours which today’s jumbo jets take to do. It was my first time travelling by air. As the plane was racing to take off, I held my breath with sheer curiosity, but once we were airborne, I felt relaxed without any anxiety. From the way my colleagues suddenly began to converse with me when we were airborne, it was clear that they had also been anxious. The journey itself was smooth with occasional bumps, but the experience was exciting. Over the Sahara we strained to look out of the glazed window to see miles and miles of sand dunes with occasional oases. The plane touched down at Lagos airport, Kano, Castel Benito (as Benghazi was then called by the Italians), and Rome. Great was our relief when our plane finally landed at the London airport. We had arrived at the great metropolis safe and sound.\n\nWe were met by an officer from the Office of the Director of Colonial Students. A coach took us to Victoria Station whence we rode by taxi to Balmoral Hotel, a hostel for students, situated near Earls Court. We were thoroughly briefed about life in England and directed to the Colonial Office where we met the Director of Colonial Students, Mr. Keith. He confirmed that I had a place at Exeter College, Oxford where I could read Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE). I had hoped that I would be permitted to read Jurisprudence for my degree, but I was politely informed that it was not then the Colonial Government’s policy to give scholarships for Law, as there were too many lawyers already in the Gold Coast. What the country needed was an efficient class of administrators, engineers, agriculturalists and medical doctors.\n\nThere was still time before the start of the academic year and so I decided to sight-see London and enjoy its delights. Meantime, I wrote to Mr. T. K. Impraim, who had written to me from Exeter College congratulating me on my admission to his college, that I had arrived in London. He was kind enough to visit me at Balmoral Hotel and to inform me when we could travel together to Oxford.\n\nIn London, I did some shopping and bought the necessary clothes for the university. Sightseeing was made easier for me than it would have been by Kweku (Kuuku) Sekyi who insisted on showing me around London. He himself had come on holidays from Cork, where he was studying Philosophy and Law. He was also staying at Balmoral Hotel and so it was a joy to have some “old coaster” on hand. As I was a newcomer to England, I was called JJC (Johnny-Just-Come) by those who had come to England a year or so before me. Mr. Sekyi and I travelled by “tube”, the underground train, to a number of places all over London. We visited Westminster Abbey, St. Paul’s Cathedral, the Houses of Parliament, the Tower of London, the Royal Albert Hall, Madame Tussaud’s and Hyde Park. Madam Tussaud’s gallery of criminals in wax was fascinating as well as frightening. The gallery of famous men was really inspiring.\n\nAll the places we visited were of great historical interest. As I stood in the House of Commons, I had an instant dream of being a Parliamentarian and the history I had learnt about Disraeli, Canning, Pitt the younger, Peel, Gladstone and Asquith kept coursing through my mind. It was an awe-inspiring chamber. As for Hyde Park, I visited the Speakers’ Corner a few more times to listen to the soap-box orators. I heard Mr. Kwesi Lamptey and Mr. Joe Appiah at various times making rabble-rousing speeches amidst heckling and booing and clapping. Both were “old boys” of my school, Mfantsipim. Joe Appiah definitely had the gift of the gab and seemed simply unruffled by the incessant heckling from an elderly English gentleman who kept shouting back at Joe, “can you hold your self-government if we give it to you? Can you? Can you?” and Joe would go on raving and ranting “our forefathers ruled themselves in Ashanti before the white man came;” “we prefer self-government to slavery.” I must say that I was attracted by Joe Appiah’s inveigling against British imperialism and colonialism. Paradoxically, Mr. Appiah later became a barrister-at-law and married Peggy Cripps, the only child of Sir Stafford and Lady Cripps. Sir Stafford was a famous Chancellor of the Exchequer in Clement Atlee’s Labor Government.\n\nMy days in London slowly drew to a close and I had to leave for Oxford. But I had enjoyed my short stay at the Balmoral Hotel. Never had I met so many West African and West Indian students in my life. There was a general solidarity and camaraderie among the students from the various countries. However, what baffled me somewhat was the occasional outburst of acrimonious exchanges of words between West African students, especially Nigerians, on the one hand, and West Indian students, especially Jamaicans on the other. Apparently, West Indians had the silly habit of referring to those of us from West Africa as “bushmen”, while West Africans referred to West Indians as “sugar cane men” who did not know their roots. But, of course, this was a simple matter of lack of understanding and a dearth of proper communication. There had been individual friendships which have lasted until today. When I myself went up to Oxford, I befriended Hector Wynter, who was my year at Exeter College studying Modern Languages, and the redoubtable Dudley Thompson who was reading Jurisprudence at Brasenose College. Both men hailed from Jamaica and they were destined to play vital roles in the affairs of Jamaica. Hector Wynter became Editor of the newspaper “The Gleaner” and was Ambassador to Trinidad and Guyana for Jamaica while Dudley Thompson became a noted senator and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Jamaica.\n\nThe trip to Oxford, my first, I have not forgotten. Mr. Impraim and I took the coach from Victoria Coach Station. Mr. Impraim gave me a running commentary as we passed through Slough, Amersham, High Wycombe and a number of small towns on the way. We arrived at the Oxford coach station at dusk. From there we took a taxi to college. I remember asking Mr. Impraim, as we drove through Oxford, where the University was. My friend did not answer me at all, because he apparently read my thoughts. I had expected to see a campus a bit outside the city of Oxford with open fields and trees shielding the halls of residence and blocks of lecture rooms. Instead, I saw clusters of buildings and what I thought were church spires, narrow streets, and bicycles upon bicycles with their riders wearing black short-sleeved gowns over their coats.\n\nWe entered a gate when we got down from the taxi. We had sent ahead our baggage by train. As soon as we entered the college, Mr. Impraim intoned, as if in some chapel, “this is Exeter College; we are standing in the Porter’s Lodge; the green lawn you see in front of you is called the quad. You are a freshman.” A quad at Oxford meant quadrangle and a freshman or fresher was a student in his first year at the University of Oxford.\n\nIntroductions done, the porter showed me a list where I saw my name against which were written 3:6. I had the 6 rooms on staircase 3. As I entered the quad and made for my staircase, I felt as if I had come to an ancient monastery. Little did I realize that I had entered a beautiful college, established in 1314 for West countrymen by Walter de Stapledon, the Bishop of Exeter, a distinguished statesman of the reign of Edward II? I was indeed an undergraduate in a famous and ancient seat of learning, whose beauty must be discovered to be appreciated. As I stayed for three years, Oxford grew on me, and then I recalled what a science lecturer and preacher at Achimota College had once said in the Gold Coast, “Oxford is a spirit – you live it.”\n\nMy two rooms in college suited me. There was a spacious study and a rather smallish bed room. My study room had two doors, the outer one being an oak door. Tradition had it that a student was not to be disturbed on any account once the oak door had been bolted.\n\nI felt miserable on my first night. It was a cold October night and I was completely unprepared to sleep in a room without a heater, which was what my bed room lacked. Nobody had advised me to buy a hot water bottle and it was an effort to sleep in cold sheets and once I slept, it was a struggle to come out of bed when my “scout” woke me up the following morning. A scout was the name given to a college servant at Oxford. In Cambridge and Durham he is called gyp. Tom was my scout. He had been a scout for thirty years before my arrival in college and he used to regale me with anecdotes about the college. He even informed me how students scaled the walls when the college gate was bolted at midnight. It was he who told me that the first Prime Minister of Pakistan, Lingat Ali Khan, lived on my staircase many years before me. Tom liked tiger nuts which I had brought from the Gold coast and so I lavished them on him in return for favors!!\n\nOn my second day in college, I had to meet my Moral tutor, Dr. Dacre Balsdon, a Greats man who had written a book about Oxford and was indeed an institution in the college. When I complained about my cold bedroom, he promptly advised me to procure woolen undershirts and wear them in addition to my pajamas. As he smiled at me, he said “you see why we Englishmen are hardy; we sleep in cold rooms.” I did not know whether I had to take what Dacre said as a joke, but I felt my pride pricked. Throughout my stay in England, I did not wear woolen undershirts and underpants beneath my pajamas; I used hot water bottles in my bed sheets.\n\nI also met the sub-Rector who was also the Dean in college to discuss my course of study. Mr. W. G. Barr explained the Oxford lectures and tutorials to me. My tutors in various subjects would indicate which lectures were necessary and which were optional. He said Lord Cecil’s lectures in English Literature were popular and, as they would broaden my knowledge, I could attend some of them. But Mr. Barr emphasized that tutorials were a must and a diligent approach to them would be rewarding in the end. The College expected me to pass the first university examination or Mods., as Oxford called the first examination, at the end of the second term. In addition there were “collections” at the beginning of each term. These were college tests which a student must pass in the subjects in which he had been tutored the previous term. I was informed that my tutor in politics would be Mr. H. G. Nicholas, a Fellow of the College. For Philosophy, I was assigned to Professor Kueale, also a Fellow of Exeter College. My Economics tutor was to be Mr. E. Ward-Perkins, Fellow of Pembroke College. I had Dr. Hla Mint, a Burmese economist who was at Meffield College to teach me Colonial Economics (as economics of underdeveloped countries was then called). For Moral Philosophy I had a professor of Magdalene College, while Mr. J. Richardson of Exeter College taught me Economic Organization. For university lectures, my tutors guided me in my choice from a list of topics and lecturers which was promoted for every term.\n\nI found the tutorial system at Oxford very beneficial. I wrote an essay every week. The usual practice at the end of the tutorial was that the tutor who would have read your paper of the previous week would question you on a number of points and you would have to defend your position or some contention made by some author. A lively discussion would ensue at which the tutor would bring up fresh ideas to supplement yours. Your tutor insisted on giving you a long reading list and requested you to read as much as possible on any given subject. My economics tutor wanted me to “produce sparks”, meaning I should do some original thinking. I always looked forward to my tutorials. The days on which I had no tutorials I spent reading at the Bodleian library or the Radcliff Library, which I found comfortable. At Oxford, an undergraduate was very much on his own and he had to organize his time in such a way that he would find time for other pursuits.\n\nIn my very first year, it dawned on me that Oxford education was something much more than lectures, seminars, classes and tutorials. While these were vital for a degree, a lot more was required of a student – the acquisition of a vigorous independence of mind. Undergraduates bathed in the sea of accumulated knowledge and sifted wisdom of centuries. It was incumbent on them to make the most out of what Oxford offered. I met mature students in my time, some of whom were ex-servicemen or had completed their National Service at some outpost of the British Empire. There was rising expectation everywhere and we all looked forward to a brave new world, where there would be full appreciation of the worth and dignity of the human person. For me, the challenge my studies at Oxford posed was overwhelming. I came from the Gold Coast where there was a new awakening. I had no doubt that I had a vital contribution to make after my studies in the building of a new nation where there would be prosperity, unity and peace.\n\nThe University of Oxford was a veritable bee-hive of activity. A freshman was often bombarded with invitations to join this or that club or society. My pigeon-hole was inundated with invitations and notices. The Cosmos club, the United National Students Association, the Socialist Club, the Labor Club, the Tory Club, the West African Students Association, the Oxford Intercollegiate Christian Union (OICCU), the Students Christian Movement (SCM), the Oxford Union usually called The Union, the Majlis Association and other clubs too numerous to mention were all available for an undergraduate to pick and choose from. I still recall the occasion when I was effectively canvassed and convinced to join the Labor Club by Miss Shirley Catlin of Somerville College. She later became Mrs. Shirley Williams and a famous Minister of Education in a Labor Government. She did not see eye to eye with the Labor Party leadership and became one of the Labor party dissidents who resigned to found the Social Democratic Party, which she represented as a Member of Parliament.\n\nI myself knew that I could join all these clubs at Oxford and had to content myself with a select few. I became a life member of The Union, and joined the West African Students Union, the Labor Club, and the OICCU. For some reason, my English friend, Tony Wilmot, did not think that the SCM offered the kind of spiritual nourishment I needed and so he suggested that I join the OICCU instead.\n\nI had a full life at Oxford. Both college and University life had their joys and pinpricks. At Exeter College, the communal life was pleasant. We had breakfast, lunch and dinner in Hall, with its polished wooden tables and benches for college students and a high table for fellows. While breakfast and lunch were not formal and compulsory, college members were expected to dine in and we had to wear our gowns. I wore a Commoners gown, a short gown falling to the waist line with short sleeves and two long straps hanging loosely from each shoulder. Scholars and Exhibitors had their own separate gowns. Apart from dinners, students and fellows wore gowns for lectures, tutorials and to most college and university official functions.\n\nIn those days, we in Exeter College had communal baths and toilets towards the Broad Street. This meant that I had to walk across the quad from my staircase to reach these facilities. In winter, I did not cherish the idea of walking all this distance and I must admit that I was happier as far as this aspect of life was concerned when I moved into “digs” in my third and last year. Otherwise, I enjoyed myself immensely in college. I got invited to the Rector’s Lodge a few times. The Rector in my time was Dr. Barber, a wily looking intellectual with a patrician but warm personality. On each occasion of my visits, I drank port, a habit which was rather common at Oxford. My Politics tutor, Mr. H. G. Nicholas for his part, served claret which I liked.\n\nOn one occasion, after my Politics colleagues had had claret at the rooms of our Politics tutor, we got so tipsy that we gave vent to our feelings as we got down to the quad. Unknown to me, my colleagues had conspired to debag me. I was suddenly mobbed. I struggled and got free and I was chased round the quad until I was overpowered. All I knew was that I was being carried shoulder high like an African chief, but without my trousers! We ended up by going down the basement to drink beer at the bar. Exeter brewed its own beer.\n\nI played hockey and table tennis for my college. I was even fried for Oxford Three at table tennis. I also did a lot of punting and swimming during the summer. On my first May Day morning at Oxford, that is, on 1st May I observed tradition by waking up early at five in the morning and joining my friends at Magdalene College. We had commandeered a punt the previous night, and as we sat on this, there issued form the top of Magdalene Tower, at six o’ clock in the morning some melodious music sung by the Magdalene College Choir. It was a refreshing and delightful experience for me. On that occasion, there were crowds of undergraduates and people milling all round the college and the Magdalene Bridge listening to the singing of the choir, presumably for the first time like me. Of most things at Oxford, you might do it once. When it was all over suddenly, there were picnics all over. My friends got into our punt and I punted them near to some meadows where we had our picnic. Punting was an art in which I was much practiced. It had to be done adroitly, otherwise you fell into the river, if your pole got stuck in the mud and you tenaciously held on to it.\n\nApart from going on the river during the summer for relaxation, I did some swimming at “Pastor’s Pleasure”, so-called because the legend was that that part of the river had been reserved for pastors, dons and Oxford me to swim naked. I heard that there was a counterpart for ladies called “Ladies Delight” but I never ventured in that direction.\n\nI did occasional walking to sample the beautiful spots all around. To walk along Christ Church and Merton Meadows or to stray into the Fellows Gardens at St. John’s College or Exeter College was a treat. I was fond of showing off Exeter College Fellows Gardens to my friends and visitors. I would take them to the garden walk up to the walk which was like a parapet. There we viewed Brasenose College (BNC), Radcliffe Library, the Sheldonian Theatre, Hartford College, the spires of the University Chapel, all in one sweep. It was on these occasions that I bathed in the spirit that was Oxford.\n\nI attended the clubs which I had joined as a member rather religiously. At the meetings of the Labor Club I met budding socialist politicians some of whom became my friends. Through them, I became a member of a small group which met on most Wednesday nights in the rooms of G.D.H. Cole at All souls. Professor Cole declaimed on workers’ participation in industry, sharing ideas with management for the more effective organization of industry and sharing in the profits accruing. I was fascinated by Professor Cole’s Guild Socialism and became a devotee. It was during this period that I considered myself a socialist, vowing that I would one day work with workers and organize them to understand the part they had to play in industry and agriculture and in the general reconstruction of the economy and the society of Ghana.\n\nI took my membership of the Oxford Union seriously as I had learnt that the Union had been the nursery of many English and world politicians and statesmen. I nursed ambitions for office at the Union, but I quickly discovered that to become an officer you had to literally spend all your time at the Union premises, wining, lunching and dining and speaking “on the paper”. To speak “on the paper” was to be listed to speak in a debate, either in support of, or against the motion. To be listed to speak in a debate, you must have attracted attention by your powers of oratory or your potential as a good speaker, by making evident interventions from the floor of the “house”. In a few cases, the fame of good speakers had gone up to Oxford before them as they came from Eton or Harrow or Winchester or Charterhouse. An African from “one of ours”, as an old English lady had once referred to me, had not got much of a chance.\n\nOnce or twice after I had made interventions from the floor, I heard a remark that “here is another Nelson-Williams”. This was an obvious reference to Mr. Nelson-Williams, an eloquent and debonair Nigerian who had read Jurisprudence at BNC and had risen to the enviable position of Secretary of the Union. I had missed him by a year or so, but my English friends would often mention his name to spur me on. One such friend was Robin Day who became President of the Union.\n\nI did observe that some of the best speakers at the Union gulped some alcoholic beverage before they entered the “house”. Like that Queen of the Netherlands, mentioned in Harold Nicholson’s delightful book “Diplomacy”, who had insisted that any Ambassador accredited to her Court had “to be capable of absorbing large quantities of intoxicating liquor without being deranged”, so did the Oxford Union seem to encourage many a brilliant orator to imbibe some amount of port or sherry or brandy before a speech. A bit of alcohol, it was believed, loosened the tongue! Speakers at the Union tended to imitate members of Parliament in their mannerisms and general demeanor. Such outbursts as “hear, hear”, “Mr. President Sir”, “shame”, “rubbish”, “sit down”, “point of order” were part of parliamentary behavior which I learnt at the Oxford Union. Years later when I myself became a member of Ghana’s Parliament, I felt very much at home because of my experience at the Union!\n\nA lot of Oxonians whom I knew at the Union emerged as prominent personalities on the British or international scene. I cannot forget William Rees-Mogg of Balliol who was President of the Union when I joined it in the academic year 1949-50. My freshman’s impression of him was of a solid and unemotional figure not to be trifled with. Although he was not my friend, I took an interest in what he would do in later life. I was not a bit surprised to learn that he had become the distinguished editor of the London “Times” and had become Sir William. Another Union member I very well remember was Robin Day of St. Edmund Hall (Teddy Hall to Oxonians). He succeeded Rees-Mogg as President of the Union and it was under his presidency that I spoke “on the paper”. He became a distinguished member of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and his program “Panorama” became a popular feature and one which I enjoyed watching when I was working in London as a diplomat. He too became Sir Robin. Then there was Jeremy Thorpe of Trinity College. He was my year. He was superbly eloquent and became an effective President of the Union. That he rose to become the leader of the British Liberal Party and a good Parliamentarian did not surprise me. There was also Keith Kyle of Magdalene College, another eloquent speaker. The last time I saw him was at the United Nations delegates Lounge, where he interviewed me on Africa and the United Nations. He had become a journalist and was a special correspondent for a British paper. Others like Ivan Yates of Pembroke, Dick Taverne of Balliol who became a Labor Member of Parliament and a Cabinet Minister, but later joined, like Mrs. Shirley Williams, the Social Democratic party, and Raghavan Iyer of Magdalene, a brilliant Indian scholar, were notable speakers at the Union, whose gift of the gab stood them in good stead after Oxford.\n\nI must put it on record that it was Robin Day, as President that I got noticed at the Union. I also got invited on occasions to the President’s receptions before a debate. On one such occasion I met Randolph Churchill, son of the famous Sir Winston. He chatted with me and wanted to know all about Africa, of which he knew next to nothing. On another occasion, I met the redoubtable Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Sir Godfrey Huggins. He and I got locked in an animated argument about self-government for the British colonies. He was at pains to make me feel that as an African from the Gold Coast, I was quite different from the African in Rhodesia. I tried to convince him that it was all a matter of opportunity and not a question of any inherent superior qualities that I possessed. He then propounded his “pyramid” doctrine, that the white settlers would remain at the apex and offer leadership to the blacks who would form the base of the pyramid. He thought it would take 50 years for the Africans in Rhodesia to start climbing to the top.\n\nThis heated argument between me and Lord Malvern, as he later became took place in 1951. Ten years later, in 1961, it was I, as the Permanent Representative of Ghana to the United Nations, that challenged in the General Assembly the British delegation’s insistence that the General Assembly could not discuss the question of Southern Rhodesia because it fell within the purview of Article 2 paragraph 7 of the Charter of the United Unions. I argued succinctly before the General Assembly that Southern Rhodesia was a colony, albeit a self-governing one, but the white minority of settlers could not presume to represent the black majority who did not even have a vote. I urged with great success the General Assembly to accept with a thumping majority that Southern Rhodesia was a colonial issue and should be treated as such. I was also one of the outspoken advocates for the dismantlement of the ill-fated Central African Federation. Like Caliban in Shakespeare’s “The Tempest”, I had been taught language by my British masters and I “knew how to curse”.\n\nAs I have narrated before, it was under Robin Day as President of the Union that I made my maiden speech at the Union. This was during the debate about Seretse Khama’s marriage to an English lady typist. What happened was that soon after leaving Balliol College, Seretse Khama, the son of King Khama of the Bamangwato tribe in Bechuanaland (now Botswana) decided to marry an English woman. This was against the express wishes of his people, especially of his uncle Tsekedi Khama, then Regent of the Bamangwatos, who maintained that the marriage was not acceptable as it was a taboo for the tribe. With the connivance of the British Government, which exercised protectorate powers over Bechuanaland, Tsekedi Khama banned his nephew from the tribe and would not permit him to enter Bechuanaland. Seretse Khama was, of course, the heir apparent to the throne. The whole episode was sensational and convulsed Oxford and England at the time. The Oxford Union was seized of the issue and the motion was to the effect that Seretse’s marriage to an English woman was proper and that the ban was improper. I spoke against the motion, supporting the ban by Tsekedi. My speech was mentioned by “Isis”, the University journal as follows: “Notable among the speakers was Alex Q. Sackey (Exeter), who spoke with simple fervor”. I subsequently became more enthusiastic as a member of the Union, but my other clubs also claimed my attention and time.\n\nThe West African Students Union was also a good forum where a student’s “tour de force” in speech making was noticeable. After all, the club was mostly concerned with political and economic matters affecting Africa in general, and West Africa in particular, and it was necessary that members should be abreast of the events occurring in West Africa at the time. Ghana and Nigeria were much in the news with Kwame Nkrumah, Nnamdi Azikiwe and Awolowo stealing the limelight. We organized debates and discussions on issues which were topical. But we also had discussions on African culture, religion and social change.\n\nWe were 25 students from West Africa reading different subjects and having diverse interests. For example, Ernest Amanor Boateng read geography. He later became Professor of Geography at the University of Ghana, Legon, and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cape Coast in Ghana. Solomon Pratt read economics and statistics; he later became an international civil servant in the International Labor Office (ILO) and then Minister of State in Sierra Leone, holding various portfolios. Alex Kyerematen read social anthropology; he later became a Minister of Local Government in Ghana and author of the “Panoply of Ghana”, depicting the rich cultural heritage of the Ghanaian people. T. K. Impraim read history; he later became a District Commissioner and a renowned Ghanaian civil servant rising to become Deputy Secretary of the Cabinet and Head of the Civil Service. Eldred Jones read English; he later became Professor of English and then Principal of Fourrah Bay College. Richard Akwei read PPE; he later became a diplomatist and Ghana’s Ambassador to Switzerland and the European office of the UN in Geneva, then Permanent Representative of Ghana to the United Nations in New York, and later Ghana’s Ambassador to the People’s Republic of China. Lastly, Tunde Lawson who also read PPE, later became a distinguished Nigerian public servant, rising to become the Secretary to the Cabinet of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. These are notable examples I have given to show the high caliber of the membership of the West African Students Club. I became the President of the Club in my last year with Eldred Jones as the Secretary. On the whole, West African student at Oxford in my time were highly motivated and were destined to play important roles on the African continent.\n\nI made many friends at the university, with some of whom I still maintain contacts. Friends like Mervyn Jaspan (now Professor of Social anthropology) and David Jenkins made me conscious of the issue of race and set me on the track in search of racial harmony. Mervyn came up to Exeter College from South Africa where he had seen apartheid in action. He used to keep me informed of the different racial laws in South Africa and unashamedly told me that he could not invite me to South Africa to stay with him as a friend but only as “a shoe-shine boy.” He never tired emphasizing the seriousness of the obnoxious governmental system under which the African was chafing. In the case of David Jenkins (also of Exeter College), he wrote to me a letter from Caux where he was attending a moral rearmament conference, apologizing to me for looking down on me as a black man. He was making this confession in his letter and begging me to forgive him because he had been brought up as a child to look upon Africans as savages. Up to the time I received David’s letter we had been good friends, exchanging visits to our rooms and discussing problems together. Afterwards I became conscious, very conscious, that I was an African at Oxford.\n\nFriends at Oxford who are still close to my heart are Heinz Hellin, John Black and Peter Barker. Heinz Hellin, a college friend, became close to me when the two of us were tutored together in general Philosophy at Magdalene College. He was one year ahead of me but philosophy brought us together. His home in Radhill, Surrey, became my home and his mother looked upon me and my wife as her children. After Oxford, Heinz had a stint as a civil servant and then joined Unilever Brothers serving as a Director in a number of countries including Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Thailand. It was when he was serving as Marketing Director that he and his wife, Ann and children visited our home at Winneba, Ghana and spent a few days with us. I am Timothy’s godfather (Timothy is his second son). I have just recently visited him and Ann in Bramwall near Guildford in Surrey, England.\n\nJohn Black read PPE at Trinity College. He became friends in our very first year. It was a purely genuine friendship based on mutual admiration. He was a bit retiring but very warm at heart and he did not think much of a lot of the undergraduates he met. I spent my first Easter holidays with him and his family in Cheltenham. We cycled all the way to Cheltenham from Oxford and back. It was a rare experience, riding through the Cotswolds and enjoying the delights of the English countryside.\n\nIt was during the same Easter holidays that John, David Jenkins and I planned to walk along the Roman Wall. We met at David’s home in New Castle, from where we visited Durham University, Hexham Abbey and the York Minister. We then made for the wilds of Cumberland and walked on Wall for miles. Each of us had a rucksack on the back containing some clothing, food and maps. John was a pilot and map reader and he led us to spend our first night at “Once Brewed”, a small inn, and then on to “Twice Brewed”. At each place, we cooked our own food. I remember cooking groundnut soup and rice. There was some pepper in the soup which was too hot for my two English friends. But they ate it and said it was “lovely.” I could sense their agony! We walked all the way from New Castle to Chesters, doing on the average fifteen miles per day. We formed an interesting trio – two Englishmen and an African singing lustily as we walked along. Some motorists became curious and slowed down to gaze at us or offer us a lift where we had thumbed. We hitchhiked through the Lake District from Chester back to New Castle, where John and I bade “au revoir” to David and took a train to Cheltenham.\n\nJohn Black became Professor of Economics at the University of Exeter. Since leaving Oxford, I have visited him in Birmingham and Exeter and he got in touch with me when he and his wife visited New York. I am still in touch with him. Unfortunately, he has not yet visited Ghana to see my home.\n\nOf all my English friends, only Peter Barker has stayed and worked in Ghana. For twenty-eight years he stayed in Ghana, first as editor of a monthly, “The New Nation” and later as a Presbyterian priest.\n\nI first met Peter after an OICCU meeting one afternoon during the first term of my first year. He was reading History at Teddy Hall. He was instantly and genuinely friendly and I reciprocated. I invited him to tea in my college and he in turn invited me to spend my first Christmas holidays in his home at 38 Pope’s Grove, Twickenham. He was a chorister at St. Stephen’s Church near Twickenham and I joined the choir during the Christmas holidays serenading with carols from house to hospital. My love of the Choir of King’s College, Cambridge, was first aroused at Peter’s house on 23rd December, 1949, a day before Christmas Eve. I was sitting by the fireside with Mr. Charles Barker, Peter’s father, listening to the radio, when there beamed out melodious voices of the Choir singing “Once in Royal David’s City”. Apparently it was a processional carol sung as the Choir was entering King’s College Chapel. I was enthralled as they sang carol after carol. Papa Barker’s “beautiful”, “this is beautiful”, as the choir sang summed up my own feelings that night. I was particularly overjoyed when the Choir rendered “In Dulce Jubilo”. Since that night I have tried to listen to the Choir of King’s College every Christmas Eve. If I did not spend my holidays in England, I played the latest carols by the King’s College Choir.\n\nRev. Peter Barker has been an indefatigable Christian worker with the Christian Council, having taught for a number of years at the Akuapemman Secondary School at Akropong. His humanity and his ready assistance to whoever needs his help are outstanding. Whether he came to Ghana because of our friendship or because of the challenge Ghana offered, it has been difficult to surmise. But I can testify from my own experience of his person that he has been a man of God who has served mankind and loved his neighbor as himself, thus fulfilling one of the greatest Commandments of our Lord Jesus Christ. He has sacrificed his own welfare, his wife’s and his children’s to labor in the Lord’s vineyard, without counting the cost. Sometimes, I have felt guilty because he was toiling in my country while I was, for most of the time, my country’s envoy abroad. Thanks to God, whenever he could make it, he stayed at our house in Winneba. He has been a great influence in my life.\n\nBut apart from such kind friends I have mentioned from whom I have learnt a great deal, Oxford itself had a profound influence on me, especially in my outlook and thinking. It was there that I had a peep into the British way of life. It was there that I developed a love of British institutions and British constitutional and political history. It was there that my Christian faith got jolted and I had a mental revolution regarding relation. It was there that my political ambitions got sharpened. It was there that I developed a vigorous independence of mind.\n\nI went up to Oxford thinking that I was a Christian and a budding politician. What happened to my political ambitions will be reserved for a later chapter. But what jolted my Christian faith was a matter of great concern to me.\n\nI had been brought up to regard reverend ministers and priests as models of elegance and perfection. When I discovered that they were fallible and even not up to the standards of conduct inculcated in me in the Gold Coast, I became palpably disenchanted.\n\nAt the Methodist elementary school, I was caned when I failed to go to church. At Mfantsipim School, it was compulsory to attend church. We marched to Wesley Chapel every Sunday morning in the sun, a distance of about three miles. If I did not attend Wesley, I had to work in a village near Cape Coast as a member of the Mfantsipim Evangelical Group (MEG), preaching a sermon or dispensing medicine, or cleaning a wound and putting medicated cotton wool on it and bandaging it. At Achimota, I was a staunch member of the SCM. At Oxford I began to attend the College Chapel and also the local Methodist Church. But I had taken my faith for granted and I had not accepted Christ meaningfully and by faith.\n\nThe test of my faith came, when I attended church, especially in the London area, and I found pews empty with a few elderly people around, when I began to observe the behavior of people who claimed to be Christians but did not measure up to standards and when, again outside Oxford, I noticed color prejudice in some churches I visited. True, I had learnt years before what Aggrey of Africa had once said that there was a vast difference between Christianity and “Church-i-anity”. And if I had been more introspective and had accepted Christ, I would not have reacted the way I did. I stopped going to church and began to be suspicious of anyone who professed to be a Christian. It was a curious period of doubt and uncertainty and when I began to read moral philosophy, my doubt became complete. In a word, I was in a state of utter confusion. I was in that state until I graduated.\n\nBut it seemed that I was not completely beyond the pale of religious reasoning. As soon as I returned to Ghana, I wrote to my friend Tony Wilmot. Although I had followed his prescription by reading my Bible with the guide of Scripture Union daily notes which he had sent me, and read carefully a book Tony also sent to me called “Who Moved the Stone”, I still entertained doubts as to the need for religion at all. Like my friend, John Black who was an avowed atheist, I believed that the Jews of Europe would not have been massacred by Hitler and his cohorts if there had been God. How could six million Jews be killed just like that with God looking on?\n\nAs luck would have it, I had to return to England in 1954 barely two years after my return from Oxford to attend a conference on African administration at Cambridge and to undertake a six months’ course for Labor Officers from different parts of the Commonwealth. I spent the Christmas of 1954 with John Black and his parents in Birmingham. It was while I was staying with the Black family that I gained an insight into my own religion, which changed my state of mind. Papa Black and I got into a discussion about religion one day. He informed me of his parents’ plans for him to become a rabbi, being of the Jewish faith. He was a mathematical wrangler at Cambridge and had read about the various world relations. He reiterated what John, my friend, had maintained that no God would stand by in the face of Hitler’s extermination of six million Jews. However, he went on to say that the Christian religion appealed to him immensely. Christ’s precepts to turn the other cheek when you are struck on one cheek, love thy neighbor as thyself, and lastly, obey God and do His will were too profound to be ignored. Unwittingly, the old man had set me to think from a fresh angle. It was clear to me that if I could follow these precepts I would be Christ-like. After all, on reflection, my communion with God was personal and did not require the stamp of approval from any individual. Through an atheist, I had discovered the spirit of truth. I could not love my neighbor as myself if I did not know myself. I began then to examine myself and that was the starting point of my embracing the Christian faith as I know it today.\n\nThe last great influence on my life at Oxford was our wedding at the Park Lane Methodist Church in Norwich on 7th April 1951. Elsie, who had been engaged to me on 18th December 1948, won a Methodist Mission scholarship to do a Diploma in Education at the Norwich Teachers Training College, then affiliated to Cambridge University. She came to Norwich in the summer of 1950. The wedding was conducted by Rev. Mr. Barnes assisted by the Chaplain of the Norwich Training College, Rev. Mr. Cyster. Elsie was given away by the Mayor of Norwich, Mr. Dickson, whose son was an administrative officer in Ghana. It was an exciting moment for me. Friends came to Norwich to attend the wedding from different parts of England. There was Henry K. Richardson and L. Y. Graham from Ghana doing accountancy in Norwich, Kwame Bosque-Hamilton, a good friend from my Achimota days who came from Nottingham to be my best man. My friends John Black and Peter Barker also came to grace the occasion. Elsie’s friends from the Training College all came to the wedding, which was widely reported in the local press.\n"
