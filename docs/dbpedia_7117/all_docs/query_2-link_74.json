        "text": "This chapter assesses the impact of varying narratives on Ghana’s post-independence violence on the study of history in schools from 1987 to 2010, a period which has seen drastic restructuring of education by two political traditions – one in support of the legacies of Kwame Nkrumah and the other in support of opposition figures to Nkrumah’s regime. Nkrumah led Ghana to attain independence from Britain in 1957; but there remains controversy around his contribution to the decade of public disorder that led to the fall of his government in 1966. The National Democratic Congress (NDC), which emerged from the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC), and the New Patriotic Party (NPP) have been vocal in this debate in the last two and half decades. While the NDC identifies Nkrumah as the sole ‘founder’ of Ghana, the leader par excellence, the NPP considers him as a ‘tragedy’ of the twenty-first century Africa, and at best, one among many citizens whose outstanding contributions shaped Ghanaian nationhood at independence. This article explores the impact that this debate has had on narratives of history in social studies textbooks for pupils at junior high schools in Ghana. A sample of social studies textbooks published in 1988, 2005 and 2008 has shown that the choice of words used in descriptions of events of the 1950s and 1960s has been manipulated over the years by the political traditions that led the reforms. It was also found that the various stages of reforms have purified the narratives along a developmental progression to eliminate stereotypes and subjective criticisms. Some educational and security implications of the politicisation of history in pre-tertiary education in Ghana are also discussed.\n\nIn the colonial days, history occupied an enviable position in the school curriculum. At this time, the colonial authorities exploited the discipline to achieve their imperial objectives. After independence, President Nkrumah also retained history in the school curriculum mainly because of his appreciation of the contributions of history to national development. History continued to be studied in pre-tertiary schools up to the 1980s. From 1987, however, the study of history started experiencing a substantial degree of marginalisation in the educational curriculum when the educational reforms of that year placed history under social studies. Over time, the study of history in the primary and junior secondary/high school levels was discontinued altogether, while at the senior high school level, it was made an elective subject, with little patronage by students. As a result, history is currently in a state of disrepute; the welfare of history, as a branch of human knowledge, is certainly exposed to more serious dangers, with academic historians struggling to justify the place of history in the school curriculum. Fortunately, after realising the need for the teaching and learning of the history of Ghana at the pre-tertiary level of education, the new government, the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo-led New Patriotic Party administration, has decided to reintroduce history as a separate subject in the pre-tertiary school curriculum. This move raises the question, \"For what reasons should history be reintroduced into the pre-tertiary school curriculum?\" Using both secondary and primary data, and employing the qualitative research approach, this study seeks to defend or justify the decision of the government through a critical appraisal of the contributions the study of history makes to the development of society. The study concludes that in view of the enormous value of history for the survival of our societies, the government should go ahead and reintroduce national history as a separate and a compulsory subject in the pre-tertiary school curriculum. Finally, the paper urges the government to institute measures that would ensure the early, effective and efficient implementation of the decision.\n\nIn this era of modernization, it is easy to be drawn and eclipsed into a totalizing paradigm of external cultures that clash with one's inherent culture. Aware of the impending disaster facing African culture, it is pertinent to re-echo the voices of the pre, during and postcolonial Ghanaian writers on the prevailing issues in the African society and the option out. Using C.C. Reindorf's, History of the Gold Coast and Asante (1895), Attoh Ahumas' Gold Coast Nation and National Consciousness(1911), Casely Hayford Ethiopian Unbound (1911), Kobina Sekyi's the Blinkards (1915) and Anglo-Fante (1918) and Ayi Kwei Armah's the Beautiful ones are not yet born (1968) and Fragments (1969) as document text for the study, the paper stress on the paths in these writers ideological reflections on the 'troubles facing Africa' as it relates with the existing prevailing forces. The paper suggests that regardless of the nemesis facing Africans, an introspective and retrospective action, and affectation to peculiar cultures to one's culture is the only antidote that will salvage Africa and other continents as well.\n\nThe bulk of historiography concerning the Gold Coast colony in West Africa, or present-day Ghana, was framed by the portrayal of Ghanaians as “subversive.” This was reflected in works by British colonial officials, and mirrored European racial attitudes underpinning the colonial endeavor. In response to this portrayal, scholarship during the independence era tended to favor narratives of Ghanaian subversion in the name of anti-colonial efforts. Subsequent works have challenged both characterizations, and paved new paths for the creation of African history. Using an overview of Gold Coast colonial historiography, we can trace the steps of this subversive portrayal and its effect on scholarship, identifying areas we where can problematize perceived subversion and the influence of racial stereotypes. Through this approach, we can draw out the complex relationships Ghanaian ethnic groups had with Europeans, unpack the effects of racial bias on historiography, and observe how contemporary histories influenced later historiography.\n\nThe pre-colonial era of Africa was characterized, among other things, by a traditional or informal system of education. Some of the emphases of traditional education were (and still are) Africans’ delight, expression and appropriation of their beliefs, values, precepts and ideals. Despite these laudable emphases, the traditional system of education is characterized by some scholars as lacking a formal or systemized structure of knowledge production. Moreover, the post-colonial debates on the influence of Western education in Africa in general and Ghana, in particular, are conspicuously silent on Western education’s role in gradually altering the economic ideology of Ghana from a mixed and socialist economy to a capitalist mode of production. Using secondary data sources, this paper argues that the traditional system of education was (and still is) somehow structured or systemized almost as the formal or Western education. It also contends that Western education is gradually spearhea...\n\nConcerning history, several people across the globe perceive or think that it is mostly about past events and also about dead people. Some trained historians, whether in ancient histories or contemporary histories, have sometimes vehemently concluded that the historian or the writer of history cannot draw conclusions but he can only make inferences or better still askquestions. Such carefulness of the historian does not only add to his tactfulness but also makes the ordinary reader aiming at policy to rush for quick-fix information, ‘non-history’. To a large extent when the works of historians have been used by policy makers, they are not cited. They are used in a way that the ordinary reader or beneficiary might not have a clue that history had a part to play in the birthing of such policy. This history and policy essay gleans information from essential academic sources to push forward an argument for history’s role in policy making. It does look at some relevant questions for Ghana where the authors lecture in history and political studies.\n\nThis article explored one of the “secrets” of Ghana’s political stability since the 1990s from the perspectives of history, memory and remembrance. Undemocratic regime changes have characterized post independence sub-Saharan Africa, both during and after the Cold War. Coup d’etats especially characterized the era immediately before and after the end of the Cold War. Just like the mechanisms of the victor’s narrative in all post-conflict societies, coup makers manipulate history to sustain their agenda. Military and police elements staged the first coup d’etat in Ghana in 1966 to overthrow Kwame Nkrumah’s regime. Despite Nkrumah’s dominance in Ghanaian post-independence nation-building and his immense global appeal, the 1966 coup makers and subsequent regimes made efforts to erase his memory in Ghana until the 1980s. This was a period of aggravated culture of silence imposed on the memory and legacies of the First Republic. The transition that led to his remembrance helped Ghanaians to purify the memory of violence and atrocities during the First Republic. In contemporary Ghana, Nkrumah has become a source of conflict and consensus, fostering national conversation (controversies) that ironically promotes social cohesion and political stability. This political conversation highlights the disagreement and consensus around Nkrumah, overshadowing sectarian, ethnic and religious tensions to a large extent; which has had positive impact on political stability. This article has explored some of the contours of agreement and disagreement about Ghana’s past, and discussed their impact on its nascent democratic regime.\n\nAfrican pre-colonial education has been described by certain Africans, authors and educational researchers as a system of education which seemed flawless, unique and particular to the African people. Such descriptions are often followed by staunch criticism of the Western style system of education in Africa. Having reconceptualised such descriptions, several groups across the regions of West Africa (such as the Boko Haram sect of Nigeria, amongst others), have often called for the abandonment of the Western style system of education, and a return to the pre-colonial ways of living and education. Authors and researchers have called for the need for African centered critical educational theory, the need to reclaiming lost African identity, etc. However, before such calls are followed through, should Africans not strive to objectively identify the likely effects of time on certain pre-colonial cultural practices and specific pre-colonial educational practices? Should Africans not consciously analyse the context within which they perceive their past? Hence, this in depth qualitative study explores how West Africans perceive the West African pre-colonial education system through narratives. Narrative accounts were collected through two different means: (1) through unstructured interviews with three indigenously trained–“retired”– crafts men (2) from “textual source” – also referred to as “implied narrative”. This research utilises the tension which exists between the equilibrium and the conflict paradigm in relation to education and development in Africa as its conceptual framework. Empirical materials explored implied that: West African pre-colonial education system is been perceived the same way it was perceived during the fight for political independence in West Africa, and the experience of colonialism influence how certain West Africans construct their meanings of the past. Therefore, the said perceptions present a romantic view. Also, what has changed in African education so far is the culture; the conceptual framework is still the same. This research concludes that, authors, researchers, policy makers and government bodies, and we common citizens of the independent African states needs not only to liberate our minds from the oppressor consciousness, but also seek to broaden our scope of criticism to include certain degrees of objective perception of our history.\n\nBefore and after the introduction of western education to Nigeria by Christian missionaries, the teaching and learning of history was given pride of place, although the contents of school history privileged the Bible and English history by celebrating the importance of the arrival of the colonial powers with their religion. This position, indeed this narrative, was challenged and contested by Nigerian nationalists even before 1960. Therefore, the need to overhaul the curriculum content arose after independence in October 1960 which led to the organisation of the 1969 Curriculum Conference. Part of the outcome of the conference was the emergence of the first Indigenous education policy in 1977. However, in 1982 History was delisted from the basic school curriculum, and retained only as an elective subject in the Senior Secondary school. The outcry from stakeholders since then (over thirty years) recently reached a crescendo and has yielded a positive change, as History was reintroduced into the school curriculum in the 2018/2019 academic session. This paper, therefore, addresses the following questions, with recommendations on how the study of History might be promoted at all levels of education in Nigeria: What was the position of history education in the past? Why was it delisted from the basic school curriculum? What were the consequences of the delisting? How did it find its way back into the basic school curriculum? After reintroduction, what next?
