        "text": "Maria V. Snyder in Storm Glass writes, “Everyone grieves in different ways. For some, it could take longer or shorter. I do know it never disappears. An ember still smoulders inside me. Most days, I don’t notice it, but, out of the blue, it’ll flare to life.”\n\nTwo years ago to the day, I received a call that put life and its entirety into perspective. It was the phone call all dread and was to inform me of the passing of my mum Mrs Augustina Ofosu-Asiedu. Truth, is nothing can prepare any human for such information but I was still determined that her memory more than her passing was what would be preserved. In a country where it is alleged, we adore the dead, ensuring a lasting legacy and preserving historical accuracy has not been our strongest point. Our funerals are characterised by acrimony and rancour to the point that a celebration of life is often all but name and the fall outs thereof are often irreparable.\n\nIn the past week, there has been a serious debate about the contributions made by our founding fathers to pre-independence and independence history and what credit should be attributed to each. Much as this debate has got me to revisit my history and to freshen my knowledge, it has also left me wondering about the sort of humans we are? I have because whilst we have been at each other's throat depending on what part of history we are inclined to believe, few of us have even bothered to check on the resting places of these supposedly illustrious Ghanaians from a preservation point.\n\nOur culture and the way some have chosen to interpret its norms and customs has made us a destructive rather than a preserving people. For many of us, a year after the loss of a loved one, the time comes for the sharing of their estate. Nothing is often spared, from their clothes, through jewellery to landed property, all are seen as part of the spoils. None pauses to think, what can be preserved to help the next generation appreciate the life and contribution of the deceased to the destiny of the living. In the end, generations are left second guessing what their forbearers did and history is crafted often in an ad hoc manner.\n\nThis attitude of ours though cultural has permeated our national institutions, leading to the hunter often attempting to craft history to portray him as the hero. This attitude has left many biases in our history, many of which would never be rectified. Irrespective of one's political leaning, we all accept that \"The Big Six\" in different ways made an immense contribution to our independence and history. Now let's take a trip down memory lane and see how their life and history has been preserved.\n\nEbenezer Ako-Adjei following his release from prison in 1966 completely forswore politics, he spent the remainder of his long life in relative obscurity; dying in Accra on 14 January 2002. In his memory is an interchange completed in 2005 when the NPP was in power.\n\nEdward Akufo-Addo became Chief Justice between 1967 and 1970, later becoming President of Ghana in the Second Republic in a purely ceremonial capacity until the coup of 1972. He lived quietly thereafter until his death in July 1979.\n\nJ.B. Danquah, perhaps the most historically chronicled of the six, less Nkrumah, suffered a heart attack and died while in detention at Nsawam Medium Security Prison on 4 February 1965. Apart from under current noises when his political tradition is in power, one would struggle to see the real legacy of Danquah on the national front.\n\nEmmanuel Odarkwei Obetsebi-Lamptey died in 1963 having helped with Ghana’s independence struggle, yet apart from a major roundabout named after him, little of his legacy is known to today’s Ghanaian. William Ofori Atta died in1988 and was given a state burial, which perhaps is the only memory many latter day Ghanaians may have of him.\n\nIs it not sad that thanks to our acrimonious nature, the memory of such great men has been left to wither? To think of it that their remains lie in relative obscurity across the country and away from the perusing eyes of the majority of Ghanaians is a travesty. To think that there are no monuments or libraries where their works and writings can be easily accessed to me is a disgrace. What happened to history as a driver of tourism? Should it only be at whims and caprices of politicians to stir the hornets’ nest and try and resurrect their memories when its suits their political agenda? How on earth do we want generations yet on born to appreciate their sweat and toil? Would there be historical accuracy if we are to rely on oral tradition and public lectures to supposedly set the records straight?\n\nYesterday, I shared an article on my social media page highlighting the current state of the burial place of George Alfred Grant better known as Paa Grant. The man credited as being the main financier and \"the father of Gold Coast politics. He was also the first president of the United Gold Coast Convention. A man of his stature who died less than a year to Ghana attaining independence has his tomb turned into a drinking spot referred to in local parlance as “beer bar.” Is this what we call historical preservation? Surely, if his efforts are of much relevance his memory and the preservation of it would have been of importance. What is the relevance of 6th March or 4th August if the memory of the main architects are left in ruins?\n\nMany of you may be content with the incessant debate about the extent of credit that ought to be given to these other men especially J.B. Danquah as compared to Kwame Nkrumah but I am not. I am more interested in the nation preserving their memories so future generations can make up their own minds as to their respective contributions to what we refer to today as our homeland. The tendency of resurrecting acrimonies of the past in a cyclical manner at the least opportunity to score cheap political points especially when politicians are in power and going into hibernation when out of it is not appealing to me in the least. Neither would this behaviour help entrench the contributions of these men or present and future contributors to our national development in any way.\n\nThis is why on this day I pay tribute to my Dad, Dr Albert Ofosu-Asiedu for installing a granite plaque in memory of his wife at the entrance of their property to allow our generation preserve the memory of his wife and to give us an opportunity to transfer her meagre contribution to the next generation so that generations yet unborn can make up their own minds on her life on this earth.\n\nFor those who see it fit to dismember the memory of the dead a year after they are interred and wilt into the embers never to even visit their resting place again, let alone check on their legacy; may I remind you that, all things shall perish from under the skies. The Big Six epitomise this and Mum in the dying hours on the 5th of August 2015 confirmed it vividly. If you want to know how your memory would be preserved, the evidence is there for all to see. If there\n\nLet me end with this from George Orwell “The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.” From where I sit, the Ghanaian does this well. Mum wherever you are, just remember, an ember still smoulders inside me and this is what keeps me writing, an art you willingly taught me."
