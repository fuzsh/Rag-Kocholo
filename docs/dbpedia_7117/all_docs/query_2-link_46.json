        "text": "Kwame Nkrumah was one of the most important figures of the post WW II anti-colonial liberation movement that ended direct European rule in Africa and established independent republics in their place. Nkrumah led the Gold Coast to independence in 1957 through the vehicle of the Convention People's Party, a mass organization which he founded in 1949 and which under his leadership carried out a dramatic campaign of nonviolent \"positive action\" to pressure the British to grant independence. Nkrumah was not only an activist, but a writer and popularizer of anti-colonial ideas as well. He produced a torrent of books outlining his political perspectives that further cemented his legacy as an opponent of imperialism and colonialism. With titles such as Revolutionary Path, Neo-Colonialism, Dark Days in Ghana, Challenge of the Congo, Handbook of Revolutionary Warfare and Class Struggle in Africa, Nkrumah built an ideological legacy which occupies a prominent position in the pantheon of African anti-colonial revolutionaries. However, events in Ghana were not the anti-colonial success story that many have come to believe, nor as simple and clean cut as the official version, put forward by Nkrumah and his supporters, of a progressive anti-imperialist movement crushed by a CIA-sponsored coup. In its quest for power, Nkrumah's pre-independence government made a number of unprincipled and opportunistic arrangements with the British that had the effect of condemning Ghana to exactly the kind of neocolonial economic relations that Nkrumah constantly critiqued. Despite a tremendous radicalization and movement of the Ghanaian people showing their own ability to transform society, Nkrumah insisted upon following top down and parliamentarian methods of struggle that made any real social transformation or committed struggle against imperialism impossible. Nkrumah, despite all the Marxist verbiage he deployed in his writings, put very little of this rhetoric into practice after he had used it to build a powerful mass party and come to a position of strength to negotiate terms with the British.\n\nKwame Nkrumah remains a towering figure in African history. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s non-violent campaign of civil disobedience to achieve political ends, he led present-day Ghana to independence in 1957. Nkrumah made Ghana a beacon of hope for not only Ghanaians but also people of African descent throughout the world. Perhaps no other African leader of the 1950s and 1960s personified the dreams, principles and aspirations of this era. At the centre of my analysis of Nkrumah&#39;s political, social and economic thought will be his own writings. I begin my re-examination of Nkrumah&#39;s life and thought by focusing on the political discourse and controversies surrounding him. The focus of Chapter 1 is his sojourn in America, where he pursued his academic studies. Chapter 2 examines his period of political activism in London between 1945 to 1947 under the ideological guidance of George Padmore. This prepared him for the leadership of the new political party he founded, the Co...\n\nUnder Kwame Nkrumah's leadership Ghana became a prominent international player in the various movements created in the ideological space between the US and USSR during the Cold War. Among these movements were those dedicated to Afro-Asian solidarity, Pan-Africanism, and Non-Alignment. The Ghanaian government from 1957 to 1966 under Nkrumah and the Convention People's Party also occupied a shifting political position in its relationships with the US and the USSR. The relative position of the Ghanaian government to the two superpowers was intimately related to its position in the larger \"Third World\" politics as represented by its participation in various Afro-Asian solidarity, Pan-African, and Non-Aligned events and organizations. Mostly coming out of a history of colonial rule the members of these movements tended to be focused on issues of European colonialism, neo-colonialism, and racism in places like South Africa. This put them at odds with the US which supported its European NATO allies such as France, Belgium, and Portugal and on the same side as the Soviet bloc on many"
