        "text": "Vice President Bawumia has encouraged the country’s youth to uphold the values and enduring principles of Ghana’s founding fathers.\n\nHe believes that will help propel national growth and development.\n\nThis was when he spoke at a seminar to mark the 77th anniversary of the founding of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) put together by the Council of Elders of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) in Accra over the weekend.\n\nHe urged the youth in particular to take inspiration from the resilient spirit of the founding fathers to guide them in all their endeavours.\n\n“Let us maintain the values and principles that defined our struggle for freedom,” he said.\n\nSpeaking on the theme, “Our Tradition, Our Heritage”, Dr. Bawumia, who is also the presidential candidate of the ruling NPP in the upcoming December 7 general election said, “Today, we celebrate the 77th anniversary of the founding of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), a pivotal moment in the nation’s political history that laid the foundation for independence.\n\n“As we commemorate this historic occasion, we are reminded of the unwavering dedication and relentless efforts of our party’s founders whose legacy and principles guided us throughout our journey so far,” Dr. Bawumia stated.\n\nThe UGCC was formed on August 4, 1947 in the ancient town of Saltpond of the Central Region.\n\nIt was the first political party in the Gold Coast, with the vision to liberate the people from the subjugation of the British Colonial Administration and establish sovereignty.\n\nIt was on this day that the system of self-governance was initiated.\n\nThe pioneers behind the UGCC formation included J.B. Danquah, George Grant, Ebenezer Ako Adjei, Emmanuel Obetsebi Lamptey, Edward Akufo-Addo and William Ofori-Atta.\n\nThe UGCC advocated self-government in the shortest possible time.\n\nDr. Bawumia said this inspired many to join the arduous struggle for power and the end of oppression, colonialism, and dictatorship.\n\n“Their tireless efforts and demands for political reforms led to the 1948 riots, born out of the people’s quest for self-rule.\n\n“The UGCC laid the groundwork for Ghana’s independence on March 6, 1957. The UGCC has been the cornerstone of political development in our history,” Dr. Bawumia opined.\n\nThe NPP flagbearer noted that the formation of the UGCC spurred the emergence of political parties and heightened political awareness among the people of the Gold Coast.\n\nThe UGCC’s advocacy for political reforms represents a monumental breakthrough in Ghana’s political history, Dr. Bawumia stated.\n\nHe stated that the lessons drawn from the UGCC had led to a dramatic transformation of the country’s politics and the establishment of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and many of its antecedent parties.\n\n“The NPP traces its roots back to the ideologies of the UGCC and has consistently built upon and developed these principles to suit the country’s needs, safeguarding the role of self-governance and striving for a better Ghana for all,” Dr. Bawumia recalled.\n\nHe said the UGCC achieved significant milestones by championing democratic governance.\n\nAlthough the UGCC could not win power to govern, its successor parties like the Progress Party (PP) under Prime Minister Busia and the New Patriotic Party under Presidents J. A. Kufour and Nana Akufo-Addo have had the opportunity to implement the vision of the illustrious founders of the UGCC noble political tradition.\n\n“We have achieved the vision of a free democratic Ghana in which the pursuit of liberty is cherished, the dignity of man is respected, and private capital and property are protected,” Dr. Bawumia insisted.\n\nApart from that, he said, “It was the dream of the UGCC to create a Ghana where the freedom of the press is guaranteed so they may hold public officials accountable.”\n\n“I am proud to say that it was the antecedent party of the UGCC, which is the NPP, which repealed the obnoxious Criminal Libel law when we came to Government in 2001.\n\n“We have achieved the founding intention of the UGCC to create a free market economy in which the industry of man is rewarded based on hard work,” he stated.\n\nDr. Bawumia further noted that the significant progress made under Presidents Kufuor and Nana Akufo-Addo in expanding the frontiers of a free market, both in terms of policy and legislation, and making the private sector the engine of economic growth had increased job opportunities and improved the living conditions of the people.\n\n“While achieving this vision of the founders of our tradition, the NPP, consistent with the founding ideals has not left out the most vulnerable in our nation,” he stated.\n\nHe, however, noted that though the NPP government prioritised private capital and property ownership, it has, since 2001, provided safety nets for the poor.\n\n“It was President Kufuor who introduced the Capitation Grant to improve access to basic education,” he emphasised.\n\nThe government initiated the Livelihood Empowerment Programme (LEAP), school feeding, free antenatal services for mothers, and the National Health Insurance Scheme among others.\n\n“President Akufo-Addo also implemented the Free Senior High School (SHS) and Free Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) initiatives, the single biggest social interventions in our nation’s history,” Dr. Bawumia disclosed.\n\n“The NPP acknowledges the UGCC’s belief in the transformative power of education. Our task today is to build on this foundation by steadfastly upholding the vision that paved the way for a democratic society and our wonderful achievements,” Dr. Bawumia stressed."
