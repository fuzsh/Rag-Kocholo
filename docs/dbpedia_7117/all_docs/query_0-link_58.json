        "text": "Introduction\n\nGhana’s struggle to dismantle colonial rule cannot be tied to only the lauded, well-known nationalists but also certain individuals who contributed immensely to pave way for independence. It is vital we honor these individuals as their inputs often go unrecognized.\n\nTheir stories serve as a reminder of the strength and potential of the human spirit, and they inspire us to pursue our passions and make a positive impact on the world. Regardless of the subtlety or discretion of their actions, they too must be mentioned in the song.\n\nThis video aims to awaken a deeper appreciation for our history and the diverse individuals whose efforts sometimes go unnoticed.\n\nGeorge Alfred Grant\n\nGeorge Alfred Grant, also known as Paa Grant, played a significant role in Ghana’s fight for independence. He was a merchant and politician and a founding member of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), where he served as the first president in 1947. Paa Grant was born on August 15, 1878 in Beyin in the Western Nzema in the Western Region of the Gold Coast, now Ghana. His grandfather was Francis Chapman Grant, the proprietor of the Gold Coast Times and treasurer of the Fanti Confederacy.\n\nHe received his education at Wesleyan School, now Mfantsipim in Cape Coast. He established his own timber firm and became a successful merchant in the timber industry.\n\nIn 1905, Paa Grant, visited Britain and established business connections with major timber companies in Europe and the United States. He opened his own offices in London, Liverpool, and Hamburg between 1920 and 1922. In Ghana, he expanded his operations to Dunkwa, Sekondi and Akim Abuakwa.\n\nIn 1926 he was appointed to the Legislative Council, representing Sekondi Takoradi. He was also a member of the Aborigines’ Rights Protection Society that championed the rise of Africans and was influential in many developmental projects including introducing street lighting and pipe-borne water to Sekondi and Axim.\n\nAfter consulting with R.S Blay, a renowned legal practitioner based in Takoradi, Paa Grant also extended invitations to J.B. Danquah and other notable individuals to establish the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) on August 4, 1947. The purpose of the UGCC was to work towards self-government. Ebenezer Ako-Adjei recommended Kwame Nkrumah for the position of UGCC Secretary General, and Paa Grant paid for Nkrumah’s travel expenses to return to Ghana from the UK.\n\nAfter Nkrumah left the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) to form the Convention People’s Party (CPP), Paa Grant focused more on his businesses than politics, but the two men remained in contact. Nkrumah visited Grant two days before his death in Axim on 30 October 1956, when Grant was 78 years old. Grant had suffered a stroke in 1955 and never fully recovered from it.\n\nAlthough a flyover in Caprice, Accra and The University of Mines and Technology in the Western Region have been named in honor of Paa Grant, his contributions to the independent movement merit even greater recognition.\n\nHannah Esi Badu Kudjoe\n\nHannah Kudjoe was one of the formidable forces behind the struggle for Ghana’s independence from the British colonial rule in the 1940s and 1950s. She was Ghana’s leading woman nationalist in the struggle for independence and spearheaded women’s involvement in politics.\n\nHannah Kudjoe was born in December 1918 in Busua, in the Western Region. She received her education at Busua Methodist School and Sekondi Methodist School. After finishing school, she trained as a seamstress and worked in Tarkwa, where she married J.C. Kudjoe, a manager at a gold mine in the same town.\n\nAfter her divorce with J.C. Kudjoe, Hannah moved in with her brother, E. K. Dadson, who owned a printing press and was a prominent member of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC). It was during her time living with her brother that she met Kwame Nkrumah, who later became Ghana’s first prime minister and led the country to independence. Nkrumah would often stay at E. K. Dadson’s residence whenever he visited the Western Region for his political activities.\n\nAs recorded by Vieta, at Hannah Kudjoe’s last public speaking engagement on International Women’s Day in 1986, Hannah recounted how she became involved in politics. She said that Nkrumah was introduced to her by her brother, Dadson.\n\nSomewhere in June 1947, we received a charming gentleman, he was introduced to me by my brother as Kwame Nkrumah, General-Secretary of the UGCC. During the day, my brother went out with Nkrumah to address various meetings of the local UGCC branch in town. . . . One day, as they came back and I was serving Kwame Nkrumah, he asked me why I have not been attending the UGCC meetings in town. I was amazed by his question and I honestly told him I thought politics was only men’s business. For the next twenty or so minutes, Kwame Nkrumah explained to me all they were doing and the importance of everybody, especially women, to get involved.\n\nBy the time Kwame Nkrumah left . . . my interest was aroused in politics. At work, I began explaining issues to my colleague seamstresses and customers. Whenever I was traveling to visit my dressmaking clients, I talked on trains about the need for our liberation and urging people to join the Tarkwa branch of the UGCC and summoning people together to hear news of the campaign for self-government.\n\nHannah eventually became a key supporter of the UGCC and an advocate for freedom. When the leaders of the UGCC, also known as the Big Six, were arrested and detained by the British colonial government for their alleged role in the 1948 riots, Hannah Kudjoe raised funds, mobilized people, and led a petition for their release. It is said that she even sold some of her personal belongings to support the movement.\n\nShe was a founding member of the Committee on Youth Organization within the UGCC, and when Nkrumah broke away from the UGCC and formed the Convention People’s Party (CPP), Hannah also moved with him and joined the CPP, becoming the first woman to do so. She served as an organizer and Propaganda Secretary of the CPP.\n\nHannah Kudjoe was also an active participant of the Positive Action, a movement that organized a series of political protests that eventually led to Nkrumah’s election victory and the formation of an independent nation. She inspired massive support for the CPP through campaigns which earned her the nickname the “Convention Hannah” After Ghana achieved victory and became an independent state, Hannah Kudjoe founded the All-Africa Women’s league in 1957 which later became the Ghana Women’s League.\n\nThroughout the late 1950s, Kudjoe continued her dedication to social welfare work in the northern regions of the country. She focused on educating women on hygiene, dress, and parenting techniques. Additionally, she also initiated various philanthropic projects in the northern regions of the country.\n\nShe away passed away in March 1986. I believe more could be done to honor this national icon than what she has received thus far.\n\nRebecca Naa Dedei Aryeetey\n\nRebecca Naa Dedei Aryeetey, also known as Naa Dedei Ashikinsha, was a prominent Ghanaian businesswoman, political activist, and feminist. She was well-known for her flour business in Accra. Born in 1923 in Osu, she spent her childhood in James Town, Accra.\n\nFollowing her primary education she entered the flour business. Her success in this industry made her wealthy and influential, earning her the nickname “Ashikinsha,” meaning “flour” in Ga. She was known for being a major financial supporter of the Convention People’s Party (CPP) and led CPP women’s activities from her home in Kokomlemle, Accra.\n\nAs a political activist of the Convention People’s Party (CPP), Naa Dedei played a significant role in Ghana’s efforts to gain independence by providing funding and campaigning for the party. She financed and campaigned for Kwame Nkrumah’s first political campaign, which resulted in him winning the Ashiedu Keteke seat in the legislature. It is alleged that her close relationship with Nkrumah was perceived as a threat by rival political parties, which may have led to her untimely death. According to reports, she accompanied Nkrumah to a CPP function in Ho and was served food that she later complained of stomach ache. This ultimately led to her death at the age of 38 from suspected food poisoning.\n\nNaa Dedei’s image was featured on Ghana’s 50 pesewa coin and some double-decker buses in Accra were nicknamed “Auntie Dedei” in her honor I believe that further efforts should be made to pay tribute to her legacy.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnderstanding the sacrifices and struggles of our forebears can help us appreciate the opportunities and privileges we have today, and can motivate us to use those advantages to make a positive impact in our country and the world. They serve as role models for how to be active and engaged citizens, and can inspire us to pursue the ideals of freedom, justice, and equality."
