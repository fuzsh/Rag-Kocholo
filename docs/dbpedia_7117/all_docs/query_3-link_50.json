        "text": "The article describes the Bureau of African Affairs Collection. First it introduces the history of the archive by examining the crucial events that influenced its state and accessibility. Then, it describes the contents of the collection, underlying its importance for the study of Kwame Nkrumah’s domestic and foreign policies and African nationalism at a continental level. The documents included in the Bureau of African Affairs Collection provide unique insights into both Nkrumah’s foreign and domestic policies. In particular, they include invaluable information on his Pan-African policy. Moreover, the documents shed new light on the presence of African liberation movements in Ghana in the period 1957 to 1966. Thus, this Collection can attract scholars interested in both Ghanaian history as well as the history of Pan-Africanism and African nationalism at a continental level.\n\nKwame Nkrumah remains a towering figure in African history. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s non-violent campaign of civil disobedience to achieve political ends, he led present-day Ghana to independence in 1957. Nkrumah made Ghana a beacon of hope for not only Ghanaians but also people of African descent throughout the world. Perhaps no other African leader of the 1950s and 1960s personified the dreams, principles and aspirations of this era. At the centre of my analysis of Nkrumah&#39;s political, social and economic thought will be his own writings. I begin my re-examination of Nkrumah&#39;s life and thought by focusing on the political discourse and controversies surrounding him. The focus of Chapter 1 is his sojourn in America, where he pursued his academic studies. Chapter 2 examines his period of political activism in London between 1945 to 1947 under the ideological guidance of George Padmore. This prepared him for the leadership of the new political party he founded, the Co...\n\nExecutive Summary This paper examines Nkrumah's work about the question of nationalism; it evaluates Nkrumah's personal determination in an attempt to create favourable conditions in promoting nationalism in Africa. It discusses the desire for self-governance in order to regain the former glory of pre-colonial Africa. Nkrumah points out that an African should be accorded freedom to develop personhood in order to make possible the creative and constructive contribution of the ideas for social change. Nkrumah wants an African to recognize him-or herself as a rational and moral being in order to play his or her rightful role as an active member of African society. The paper points out the possibility of making nationalism a joyful reality in different parts of the world, and in Africa in particular. It emphasizes both personal autonomy and communal responsibility aimed at contributing to making nationalism in Africa what it should be: a living and creative force in modern life. It suggests that each person in the community should be recognized as the basic unit.\n\nThis article advances the beginning of a method to Afrocentrically evaluate the works of Nkrumah and the ideology of Nkrumahism. 1 It will also address some key concepts, sources of data, and a rationale for the selection of such data sources. A description of Afrocentricity and its impact on disciplines used to examine African phenomena is given as a map of the possibilities of philosophical examinations."
