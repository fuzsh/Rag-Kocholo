        "text": "GHANA’S BIG SIX\n\nTHEY WERE THE BLACK STARS OF AFRICA\n\nThe \"Big Six\" refers to six prominent leaders of the Ghanaian independence movement, pivotal figures in the country's journey to independence from British colonial rule. They played crucial roles in advocating for Ghana's sovereignty and self-governance. The Big Six are:\n\nKwame Nkrumah: Often regarded as the foremost leader in Ghana's struggle for independence, Nkrumah was the founding father of the modern Ghanaian state and the first Prime Minister and President of Ghana after independence in 1957.\n\nEbenezer Ako-Adjei: Ako-Adjei was a key figure in the fight for independence and was one of the founding members of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), one of the earliest political parties in Ghana.\n\nEdward Akufo-Addo: Akufo-Addo was a prominent lawyer and politician who played a crucial role in Ghana's independence struggle. He later became the Chief Justice of Ghana and eventually the President of Ghana from 1970 to 1972.\n\nJ.B. Danquah: Joseph Boakye Danquah was a lawyer, politician, and intellectual who co-founded the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) with Kwame Nkrumah. He was a staunch advocate for Ghanaian independence and played a significant role in shaping the country's political landscape.\n\nEmmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey: A founding member of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), Obetsebi-Lamptey was an influential figure in the independence movement. He served as the Minister of Justice and Attorney General in Ghana's first independent government.\n\nWilliam Ofori Atta: William Ofori Atta was a prominent politician and one of the founding members of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC). He was a key strategist in the independence movement and played a significant role in Ghana's transition to self-governance.\n\nThese six individuals, collectively known as the Big Six, are celebrated for their efforts in securing Ghana's independence and laying the foundation for the nation's development and progress.\n\nWhile Ghanaian leaders were building forces to take down British control, other African giants were also fighting in their respective countries for their liberation, in Nigeria Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe also spearheaded the fight for independence. It all started when in 1947 group of elegant intellectuals who had gotten quality education from overseas built up an idea that Africa must get its freedom and for that matter, Ghana must show an example, this urged them to form a political party called UGCC (United Gold Coast Convention) and by 1948 Kwame Nkrumah was invited to join them and they eventually formed the elite group. These six vibrant politicians were later called the BIG SIX; a name that reverberates throughout Africa till these days.\n\nIndeed the Big Six were resilient and brave, but as fate decree in all things soon there were disagreement among the Big Six. Disagreement in the policies and in their approach, while some thought that they must negotiate the independence with methodical process others thought they must get the independence immediately. Kwame Nkrumah eventually broke away from the UGCC party and formed his own party called CPP. In this case J B Dankwah was the main leader insisting on the methodical process and so these people became such bitter enemies.\n\nWHAT DOES THE STARS SAY ABOUT THIS SEPARATION AND BITTER ENMITY\n\nInfospacetalk uses astrology as a tool for understanding mysteries and the psychological circumstances of men so we shall look into why such men of high intellectual attainment could not find common policies to combat the domination of the British government. Dr. J B Danquah was the leader of the group and when Dr. Kwame Nkrumah joined he was put in charge as a secretary, this allowed him to interact widely with the public and thereby became very popular, they worked very cordially till the aspect of policy implementation came up and J B Danquah thought they must follow a gradual process and Nkrumah said they must demand independence immediately, (Independence now), this was the beginning of the separation; and the bitter enmity between the two.\n\nASTROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS\n\nDr J B Danquah’s zodiac sign which influences his personality and self-image was Pisces. This in Astrological terms is classified as Ascendant, the Ascendant is symbolized as the temperament and reflects completely your attitude towards people and circumstances, as a Piscean J B Danquah was soft and have lots of sympathy and consideration for logical conclusions, in addition to these temperament consideration of his emotional nature which impacted his attitude was reflected in his Moon. His Moon is seen in the Zodiacal sign of Aquarius and this further reflects a person who considers a broader perception of human relationship and network, and formation of common wealth, perhaps in the type of association the Senegalese had with the French government or the Ivorian’s association with the French. On the otherwise Dr Nkrumah had Sagittarius on the Ascendant, the Zodiacal sign which symbolizes ambition and higher aspirations; it is also a fire sign as with the fire signs always, impatience and so he demanded for immediate independence. As fate always brings people together, the ascendant which reflects self-image, the two of them the self-image and temperaments were at odds with each other, J B Danquah was water sign and Nkrumah was of fire breed and the two element are not in harmony at all ad in further consideration their emotional natures represented by the Moon forces were also in a frictional conflict. J B Danquah’s Moon was in Aquarius and Aquarius is an air sign where as Nkrumah’s Moon was in Scorpio the vindictive sign. Scorpio is a water sign and inclined to emotions, is revengeful and can go all out to seek revenge for wrong done to him. This zodiac sign further influenced Nkrumah’s aspirations and the deep feelings of craving for self-rule. Ironically Aquarius and Scorpio are both fixed signs and bitter emotional conflict between these two signs can be very deep and damaging. A further analysis of their horoscope is very interesting which explains their destiny and how the two were not meant to work together because the teamwork was not there, and their emotions could not flow together, Nkrumah’s horoscope reflects someone forceful and will go all out to grab what he seeks, while J B Danquah’s nature urges him to follow any logical deductions that may eventually bring good result."
