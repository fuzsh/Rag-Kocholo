        "text": "Education and early career\n\nGrant was born in 1878 in Beyin, Western Nzema, into an influential merchant family. He was the son of William Minneaux Grant and Madam Adjua (Dwowa) Biatwi of the Aboradze clan, and the grandson of Francis Chapman Grant,[1] proprietor of the Gold Coast Times and treasurer of the Fanti Confederation.[6]\n\nGrant was educated at Wesleyan School in Cape Coast now Mfantsipim School and through private tuition given by Joseph D. Abraham, a wealthy merchant friend of his father's.[1] Grant was subsequently employed in the timber trade, first at Axim and then for five years in the Ivory Coast.[6] In 1896, he established his own firm, George Grant and Company.[1] He prospered as a timber merchant, with a flourishing export business, at a time when the trade was dominated by European companies.[6]\n\nHe visited Britain in 1905 and by the time the First World War broke out in 1914, he had built up business contacts with leading timber companies in Europe and the United States. Between 1914 and 1919 he chartered ships to transport timber to Britain and the USA. He opened his own offices in London, Liverpool and Hamburg between 1920 and 1922, and in the Gold Coast he expanded operations to Dunkwa, Sekondi and Akim Abuakwa.[6] In 1926 he was appointed to the Legislative Council, representing Sekondi. Grant was also a member of the Aborigines' Rights Protection Society and was instrumental in many development projects,[1] including introducing street lighting and pipe-borne water to Sekondi and Axim.[2]\n\nPolitical activism and later life\n\nDuring and after the Second World War, Grant realised that Africans in the Gold Coast were suffering many colonial practices that were discriminatory and unfavourable,[1] and he decided to take steps to deal with the inadequacy of representation of African interests.[6] He invited J. B. Danquah and others to a meeting to launch a nationalist party. Some 40 people, including lawyers R. A. Awoonor-Williams, Edward Akufo-Addo, and Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey, met in Saltpond and the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) was founded on 4 August 1947, with the goal of achieving self-government. Kwame Nkrumah was elected UGCC secretary general, after being recommended by Ebenezer Ako-Adjei,[2] and Grant paid Nkrumah's £100 boat fare to return to Ghana from Liverpool that year.[7]\n\nNkrumah later split from the UGCC to form the Convention People’s Party (CPP), and Grant eventually concentrated more on his businesses than politics. However, they maintained contact, and Nkrumah visited him two days before Grant's death in Axim on 30 October 1956, at the age of 78.[2] In 1955 he had suffered an attack of apoplexy from which he never completely recovered.[8]"
