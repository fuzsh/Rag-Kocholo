        "text": "Advertisement\n\nUntil 2017, there was no debate about the founding history of Ghana. In schools and in the various history and social studies textbooks, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah was credited as the founder of Ghana.\n\nEven far beyond Ghana on global scale, Nkrumah is widely known and celebrated as an iconic leader in both Ghana and Africa. In fact, his birthday, 21st September, was celebrated as a holiday (Founder’s Day) in the country every year.\n\nHowever, in 2017, the current government, which traces its root to the Danquah-Busia-Dombo tradition, felt that Dr. Kwame Nkrumah was not worth a holiday celebration. Since then, frantic efforts are made to undermine Nkrumah’s contribution to Ghana, including rewriting many of the history/social studies textbooks to place the shine on the “big six”, and phasing out all the cedi denominations that had Nkrumah’s image embossed on them.\n\nImportant holidays like 1st July, Republic Day, which celebrates when Ghana first obtained a republic state, and 21st September which is the birthday of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, have also been cancelled and replaced with 4th August Founders’ Day, which is the day the UGCC was formed, and 7th January, as constitution day.\n\nIn this article, I have moved the debate beyond human feelings, sentiments and biases. As an AI enthusiast, I have engaged AI to give some objective perspectives to the founding history of Ghana. I asked AI only four questions:\n\nWho is the founder of Ghana?\n\nBetween the “BIG SIX” and Dr. Kwame NKrumah, who must be regarded as the founder of Ghana?\n\nWhy must only Dr. Kwame Nkrumah be regarded as the Founder of Ghana?\n\nBetween 4th August which is the day the UGCC was formed, and 21st September, which is the birthday of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, recommend one to be established as holiday in Ghana.\n\nBelow is the unedited responses from A.I.\n\nDaniel Fenyi: Who is the founder of Ghana?\n\nAI: The founder of Ghana is considered to be Kwame Nkrumah.\n\nDaniel Fenyi: Between the “BIG SIX” and Dr. Kwame NKrumah, who must be regarded as the founder of Ghana?\n\nAI: When considering the founding of Ghana, both the “Big Six” and Kwame Nkrumah played significant roles, but Nkrumah’s contributions and leadership make him the more appropriate candidate to be regarded as the founder of Ghana. The “Big Six” refers to a group of six prominent Ghanaian politicians and activists who were instrumental in the country’s independence movement. The members of the “Big Six” were:\n\nJoseph Boakye Danquah\n\nEdward Akufo-Addo\n\nEmmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey\n\nWilliam Ofori Atta\n\nDr. Kwame Nkrumah\n\nEbenezer Ako-Adjei\n\nThese individuals were leaders in the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), which was formed in 1947 to advocate for Ghanaian self-government within the British Empire. The “Big Six” played a crucial role in the early stages of the independence movement and helped to galvanize public support.\n\nHowever, it was Kwame Nkrumah who emerged as the dominant figure and the driving force behind Ghana’s final push for independence. Nkrumah, who had returned to Ghana after studying abroad, founded the Convention People’s Party (CPP) in 1949, which quickly became the leading nationalist movement in the country.\n\nDaniel Fenyi: Why must only Dr. Kwame Nkrumah be regarded as the Founder of Ghana?\n\nAI: Kwame Nkrumah’s role as the founder of modern Ghana is well-established and widely recognized. Here is an explanation of why Nkrumah is considered the founder of Ghana:\n\nKwame Nkrumah was the central figure in Ghana’s struggle for independence from British colonial rule. Prior to his leadership, the Gold Coast (as Ghana was known during the colonial period) was a British colony, with the indigenous population having little say in governance and political affairs.\n\nNkrumah’s journey to becoming the founder of Ghana began in the 1940s when he returned to the Gold Coast after completing his education in the United States and the United Kingdom. He quickly emerged as a leading nationalist and anti-colonial activist, forming the Convention People’s Party (CPP) in 1949.\n\nUnder Nkrumah’s leadership, the CPP initiated a mass political movement that demanded immediate self-government for the Gold Coast. Through a series of strikes, civil disobedience campaigns, and negotiations with the colonial authorities, Nkrumah and the CPP were able to secure a path to independence.\n\nIn 1951, the CPP won a landslide victory in the Gold Coast’s first general elections held under universal adult suffrage. Nkrumah was subsequently appointed as the country’s first Prime Minister, leading the self-governing colony towards full independence.\n\nNkrumah’s skillful navigation of the complex political landscape, his ability to mobilize the masses, and his unwavering commitment to Ghana’s self-determination were instrumental in the country’s transition from a British colony to an independent state.\n\nOn March 6, 1957, Nkrumah fulfilled his long-held dream when he proclaimed the establishment of the independent state of Ghana, with himself as the first Prime Minister. This historic event marked the end of British colonial rule in the country and the birth of the modern Ghanaian nation.\n\nNkrumah’s role as the founder of Ghana is further cemented by his subsequent actions in shaping the new nation. As Prime Minister and later as the first President of Ghana, he implemented a range of policies and initiatives that laid the foundation for the country’s development and transformation.\n\nNkrumah’s commitment to pan-Africanism and his vision of a united Africa were also central to his legacy as the founder of Ghana. He actively advocated for the political and economic integration of the African continent, believing that this was crucial for the continent’s long-term prosperity and independence.\n\nNkrumah’s influence extended beyond Ghana’s borders, as he became a prominent figure in the global anti-colonial movement and a respected voice on the international stage. His charismatic leadership, his unwavering ideological convictions, and his ability to inspire and mobilize the masses made him a towering figure in the history of African independence.\n\nDespite facing opposition and political challenges during his time in power, Nkrumah’s legacy as the founder of Ghana remains intact. He is widely regarded as the father of the Ghanaian nation, and his contributions to the country’s independence and development are celebrated and revered by Ghanaians and people around the world.\n\nThe political, social, and economic structures that Nkrumah established during his time as Ghana’s leader continue to shape the country’s trajectory to this day. His vision of a self-reliant, industrialized, and prosperous Ghana has been a guiding force for successive governments, even if the implementation of his policies has not always been seamless.\n\nNkrumah’s legacy as the founder of Ghana is also evident in the country’s national symbols and institutions. The Ghanaian national flag, which features the iconic black star, was designed during his administration and has become a symbol of Ghana’s independence and national pride.\n\nFurthermore, Nkrumah’s influence can be seen in the various national monuments, institutions, and public spaces that bear his name, such as the Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park, the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, and the Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute.\n\nIn recognition of his immense contributions to the country, Nkrumah was declared the “Osagyefo” (the Redeemer) by the Ghanaian people, a title that reflects his status as a revered and transformative figure in the nation’s history.\n\nWhile Nkrumah’s political legacy and leadership style have been the subject of debate and controversy, his role as the founder of modern Ghana remains undisputed. His vision, his determination, and his unwavering commitment to Ghana’s independence and development have cemented his place in history as the father of the Ghanaian nation.\n\nIn conclusion, Kwame Nkrumah’s leadership, vision, and actions were instrumental in the transition of the Gold Coast from a British colony to the independent state of Ghana. His central role in the independence movement, his establishment of the first post-colonial government, and his shaping of the country’s political, social, and economic structures make him the indisputable founder of modern Ghana.\n\nDaniel Fenyi: Between 4th August which is the day the UGCC was formed, and 21st September, which is the birthday of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, which one will you recommend to be established as holiday in Ghana.\n\nAI: After considering the historical significance of the formation of the UGCC and the birth of Kwame Nkrumah, I would recommend that September 21st, Nkrumah’s birthday, be established as a national holiday in Ghana.\n\nWhile the formation of the UGCC on August 4th was an important milestone in Ghana’s independence movement, Kwame Nkrumah’s leadership and pivotal role in achieving independence make his birthday a more appropriate choice for a national holiday.\n\nHere are the key reasons why September 21st, Nkrumah’s birthday, should be the designated national holiday:\n\nNkrumah’s central role in Ghana’s independence:\n\n– Nkrumah emerged as the dominant figure in the independence movement, forming the Convention People’s Party (CPP) and leading the push for immediate self-government.\n\n– His leadership, mass mobilization, and negotiations with the colonial authorities were instrumental in securing Ghana’s independence in 1957.\n\nNkrumah’s legacy as the founder of modern Ghana:\n\n– As the first Prime Minister and later the first President of Ghana, Nkrumah laid the foundations for the country’s political, economic, and social development.\n\n– His vision for a united, self-reliant, and industrialized Ghana continues to shape the country’s trajectory even today.\n\nNational symbolism and recognition:\n\n– Nkrumah’s birthday is already widely celebrated in Ghana as a significant national event, with various commemorative activities and ceremonies taking place.\n\n– Establishing his birthday as a national holiday would further cement his status as the revered founder of the Ghanaian nation and would be a fitting tribute to his legacy.\n\nIn contrast, while the formation of the UGCC was an important milestone, it was not the ultimate catalyst for Ghana’s independence. The UGCC’s initial demands were for self-government within the British Empire, whereas Nkrumah and the CPP’s push for immediate independence was the decisive factor in achieving statehood.\n\nFurthermore, the UGCC’s role was more in the early stages of the independence movement, whereas Nkrumah’s leadership and actions were central throughout the entire process, culminating in the declaration of Ghana’s independence.\n\nTherefore, in recognition of Kwame Nkrumah’s pivotal role as the founder of modern Ghana, I would recommend that September 21st, Nkrumah’s birthday, be established as a national holiday in Ghana. This would serve as a fitting tribute to the country’s founding father and a celebration of the nation’s independence and proud history.\n\nConclusion\n\nNow, based on the responses, I leave you, the reader, to make your own judgement about who deserves honour. Clearly, history cannot be changed or twisted. No amount of tactics can change the gross importance of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah to the independence story of Ghana.\n\nIn case you doubt the authenticity of the A.I responses, I can grant you the permission to run the responses in an A.I detector to confirm if the responses are manipulated.\n\nThank you for reading today’s episode. Continue to follow the insightful articles I share on this page.\n\nSee you.\n\nWriter: Daniel Fenyi"
