        "text": "The Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo government sits comfortably at the top of the list of governments since Ghana's independence that have had the tallest records of appointees serving in various ministerial portfolios.\n\nThe 'elephant-sized' government of the Nana Akufo-Addo regime was announced right after the New Patriotic Party assumed office in 2017, with many questioning why a new government had to have so many people serving in ministerial positions.\n\nThe list of 110 ministers at the time was eventually given a little slash, but the undeniable fact that the government of the sitting president has, in Ghana's history, presented the most voluminous ministerial list is unquestionable.\n\nIt must also be noted that during his presidential campaign, Nana Akufo-Addo promised to cut superfluous government spending.\n\nAt independence, however, when Osagyefo Dr Kwame Nkrumah formed his government as the country's first president and prime minister, he also nominated a handful of people to help him steer the business of administering a country.\n\nIn this Ghana Month article, GhanaWeb brings you the list of all the twelve (12) people who served as the first set of ministers of the newly independent Ghana in 1957.\n\nHere they are:\n\nTrade and Labour and Leader of the House: Kojo Botsio\n\nKojo Botsio (21 February 1916–6 February 2001) was a Ghanaian diplomat and politician.
