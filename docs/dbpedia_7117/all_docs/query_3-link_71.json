        "text": "Founders' Day is a national public holiday observed to commemorate the contributions of all the people, notably the \"Big Six\"[1][2] who led the struggle for Ghana's independence.[3] The Founder's Day was formerly called \"Founder's Day\" with the letter \"S\" appearing after an apostrophe and it was celebrated to earmark the achievements of Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah.[4]\n\nKwame Nkrumah was the first President of Ghana and a member of the \"Big Six\".[5] He was born on 21 September, hence, the \"Founder's\" Day celebration on 21 September in each year in honour of his participation in the Ghanaian movement for independence from British colonial rule.[6] Other members of the \"Big Six\" were Edward Akufo-Addo, Joseph Boakye Danquah, Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey, William Ofori Atta, and Ebenezer Ako-Adjei.[7] There were several thoughts and realizations of the leaders of the Present President Akufo Addo's regime that other members of the \"Big Six\" who were part of the struggles for Ghana's independence must be honour as part of the celebration.[8][9]"
