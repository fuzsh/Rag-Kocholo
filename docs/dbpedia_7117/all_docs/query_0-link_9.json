        "text": "The Big Six\n\nThe Big Six of Ghana have made an indelible mark on the country's history, exhibiting the spirit of bravery, dedication, and patriotism. These exceptional people were instrumental in the fight for Ghana's independence from colonial domination. The names of the Big Six have persisted in Ghanaian history to this day. Their efforts and sacrifices are woven into the fabric of Ghana's history, reminding us of the strength of unity and the human spirit's resilience.\n\nThe names of the Big Six of Ghana became heroes for their bravery when they fought for independence and were arrested by the government of Ghana. They were later released after the people came together to protest for their release. Who are the Big Six? Here are the essential details of the Big Six.\n\n1. Kwame Nkrumah Ghanaian politician Kwame Nkrumah. Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah was born on September 21, 1909. He grew up in a rural village called Nkoful in the Nzema region. Nkrumah joined a Catholic mission school in Half Assini, where he later worked as a teacher in the government training institution in Accra. He got a teaching certificate in 1930 at Prince Walls College and joined an anti-colonial resistance movement known as Black Nationalism. In 1935, Kwame Nkrumah went ahead to further his education at Black Lincoln College in Pennsylvania in the United States of America. Key to note is that as he continued studying, Nkrumah earned a living working as a dishwasher. In 1945, Nkrumah went to London to further his education at the London School of Economics, where he studied a PhD in Anthropology. Kwame Nkrumah's close relationship with Trinidadian involved him in the needs of Black Nationalism, leading to racial discrimination's end. He founded the Black African Students Association in Canada and America. He was nominated as the general secretary of the West African Secretariat in the year 1945. He was later selected as the regional secretary of the Pan African Federation, where he organized the fifth Pan African Congress. The conference was presented by various countries such as Nigeria, Nyasaland, the Gold Coast, Liberia, and Togoland. He later returned to Ghana in 1947, where he met with Dr. J.B Danquah, who saw him join the United Gold Coast Convention. The convention wanted to end the Second World War. During that period, Kwame Nkrumah established the Ghana National College, and no one got involved. Later, it was known as the University of Ghana and became the first National University. He was then imprisoned because of a misunderstanding of his party, which was engaged in a strike and led to his sentence of three years in Fort James prison in Accra. In 1951, he won a landslide victory despite his absence, which resulted in his release on 12 February. Kwame died of prostate cancer in April 1972 at the age of 62 while in Romania.\n\n2.
