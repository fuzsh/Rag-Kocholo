        "text": "Advertisement\n\nLawyer and historian, Yaw Anokye Frimpong, has disclosed that there is nothing like ‘The Big Six’ in Ghana’s history regarding the country’s struggle for independence.\n\nHe says the people who were described as such belonged to the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) who got arrested after the 1948 riots.\n\nSpeaking at a commemorative lecture organised by Onua TV’s morning show, ‘Maakye‘, on the occasion of Nkrumah’s 52nd memorial, the historian indicated that the 1948 riots which led to the shooting and killing of three ex-service men brought about that phrase.\n\nHe explained that after the governor received the petition from the soldiers, they realised the handwriting was Nkrumah’s, making them draw a conclusion that the riot was orchestrated by the UGCC.\n\nHe said the petition was drafted on the bended back of one of the officers on their way to the castle.\n\nFollowing the protest, the four other leaders of the UGCC were arrested together with Nkrumah and Ebenezer Ako Adjei, who convinced the ex-service men with Nkrumah to go for their ex-gratia.\n\nReporting the arrest, Mr. Anokye said the dailies said “the big six leaders of the UGCC” have been arrested, leading to the popularity of the phrase ‘The Big Six’, and not necessarily that all of them played a pivotal role in Ghana’s road to independence.\n\nHe said if there should be anything like ‘The Big Six’ pertaining to the independence of Ghana, the likes of Paa Grant, Gbedemah and others should have joined Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, and not the leaders of the UGCC who got arrested because of Nkrumah’s handwriting on the petition.\n\nThe Big Six were Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah; Dr. Joseph Boakye (‘J.B.’) Danquah; Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey; Ebenezer Ako-Adjei; William Ofori Atta and Edward Akufo-Addo.\n\nNkrumah at the time was part of the UGCC with the five others before forming the CPP.\n\nThe three ex-servicemen whose shooting led to the 1948 riots were Sergeant Adjetey, Corporal Attipoe and Private Odartey Lamptey."
