        "text": "Edith Cresson - who as French prime minister in the early 1990s plumbed new depths of unpopularity - is the commissioner at the centre of the EU fraud crisis.\n\nThe BBC's Justin Rowlatt looks at the track record of a \"flame-haired and fiery-tempered woman\"\n\nThe Commission fraud inquiry said the research commissioner \"failed to act in response to known, serious and continuing irregularities over several years\".\n\nMs Cresson was found guilty of not reporting failures in a youth training programme from which vast sums went missing.\n\nShe was also criticised for showing favouritism in hiring her dentist as an AIDS expert in 1995.\n\nThe man was later judged to be unqualified and his work was deemed to be grossly deficient.\n\nBut none of the criticisms of her said she had gained personally.\n\n'Maybe I was a little careless'\n\nAfter the publication of the report, Ms Cresson protested at being singled out as the black sheep among the commissioners.\n\nMs Cresson failed to report irregularities to Mr Santer, inquiry said\n\n\"Maybe I was a little careless,\" she told France 2 television.\n\n\"The parliament put in place a committee of experts who reached the conclusion there was a collective responsibility for the malfunctions which are very old, which didn't even take place under this Commission,\" she said.\n\nAsked about her political future, she replied \"Strong convictions bring problems, difficulties that you need to know how to overcome.\"\n\nUnpopular prime minister\n\nMs Cresson is no stranger to controversy; her uncompromising leadership style made her one of France's least popular prime minister's during her brief tenure in office, from 1991-1992.\n\nFrench President Francois Mitterrand chose her for the post as he believed she could help shake the country out of its lethargy.\n\nIt is said she was a good friend to President Mitterand - it was even rumoured that she had been his mistress.\n\nTaking up the challenge, she said: \"To get the country moving it is necessary to let off some bombs. I shall commence the bombardment.\"\n\nOutspoken politician\n\nMs Cresson, often compared with Margaret Thatcher, has become notorious for a string of controversial statements, including calling her cabinet \"creeps\". She once said one in four British men was homosexual.\n\nBefore taking up her post as prime minister, Ms Cresson had gained cabinet experience handling trade, European affairs and agriculture.\n\nWhile agriculture minister she failed to get on with France's farmers who called her the \"perfumed one\" while she returned the compliment calling them, \"conservatives and woman-haters\".\n\nShe won a seat in the European Parliament in 1979.\n\nMs Cresson, who was born into a well-to-do family in the Parisian suburbs in 1934, was taught English by her British nanny.\n\nAs she grew up she turned her back on the conservative politics of the French middle classes, saying: \"One of the most obvious characteristics of the bourgeoisie is the boredom it generates.\""
