        "text": "Every Commonwealth country has a prime minister. They help keep the country running smoothly, and contribute to the parliamentary system of government. It’s safe to say that without a prime minister, a country would not run properly.\n\nIn this article, we’re going to look more closely at some of the world’s oldest prime ministers, so without further ado, let’s get right into it.\n\n7. Eugene Koffi Adoboli\n\nPhoto Source\n\nEugene Koffi Adoboli served as Prime Minister of Togo for less than two years, from May 1999 to August 2000. Before becoming Prime Minster, Adoboli worked as an international civil servant at a United Nations conference in Geneva. He also worked as a civil servant for over 40 years at the United Nations Joint Inspection Unit.\n\nDid you know?\n\nEugene Koffi Adoboli was arrested for embezzlement and sentenced to jail for 5 years. He was also widely criticized in Togo for failing to improve the economy.\n\n6. Fernando José de França Dias Van-Dúnem\n\nPhoto Source\n\nFernando José de França Dias Van-Dúnem was the Prime Minister of Angola for around 3 years in the late 90s. Before he got into politics, Van-Dúnem worked in academia as a research assistant. He later worked as a lecturer and taught at the University of Burundi, teaching students Public International Law, Constitutional Law, and Administrative Law.\n\nDid you know?\n\nBefore Fernando José de França Dias Van-Dúnem became Prime Minister, he was a member of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, and still is part of this movement today.\n\n5. Édith Cresson\n\nPhoto Source\n\nÉdith Cresson belongs to the Socialist Party and is currently a politician. She served as Prime Minister of France for a year between 1991 and 1992, making her the first woman to do until Élisabeth Borne was appointed in 2022.\n\nUnfortunately, due to sexism and her strong views, Cresson was forced to leave office because the Socialists did not vote for her in the 1992 elections.\n\nDid you know?\n\nCresson’s tenure as Prime Minister is widely known for being one of shortest terms served in France.\n\n4. Paul Biya\n\nPhoto Source\n\nPaul Biya is currently the oldest President in the world, making him the oldest head of state in the world but before that, he served as the Prime Minister of Cameroon for over 5 years.\n\nIn terms of his political career, Biya worked his way up under President Ahmadou Ahidjo’s rule. His various positions included being the minister of national education Cabinet director and the president’s civil cabinet director as well.\n\nDid you know?\n\nPaul Biya has foreign relations with Israel, France, China, and Nigeria.\n\n3. Suchinda Kraprayoon\n\nPhoto Source\n\nSuchinda Kraprayoon is now a retired politician and former army general. His career as a politician began after a coup d’état took place in 1991. Before being appointed Prime Minster, Kraprayoon served as a leader of the National Peacekeeping Council (NPKC). It was this council that caused the coup d’état to get rid of Chatichai Choonhavan, who was Prime Minister of Thailand at the time.\n\nLater on, in 1992, Kraprayoon was appointed Prime Minister, but this decision was hugely unpopular, and he resigned two months later.\n\nDid you know?\n\nAfter resigning from his post as Prime Minister, Kraprayoon became the chairman of Telecom Holdings.\n\n2. Thanin Kraivichien\n\nPhoto Source\n\nThanin Kraivichien began his career as an associate judge and worked at the Ministry of Justice. His judicial career was highly successful, and he quickly became the Supreme Court of Thailand’s president.\n\nKraivichien served as the Prime Minister of Thailand from 1976 to 1977 and, later on, was appointed to the Privy Council. He is Thailand’s oldest Prime Minister.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThanin Kraivichien was famously an anti-communist. He even hosted a television show and attacked communism on it, and was a member of Nawaphon, an anti-communist group.\n\n1. Mahathir Mohamad\n\nPhoto Source\n\nMahathir Mohamad has had an extensive career in Malaysian politics. He is one of the oldest Prime Ministers in the world and has served for 24 years as Prime Minister! This makes him the longest-serving Prime Minister of Malaysia and one of the longest-serving Prime Ministers in the world.\n\nHis career as a politician has seen him achieve many great things, such as removing legal immunity for the royal family and undermining judicial independence.\n\nDid you know?\n\nMahathir Mohamad is actually a doctor by trade. He studied medicine and established a practice in his hometown. He was also the first Malay doctor in his hometown.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this article, we walked you through a list of the oldest prime ministers in the world.
