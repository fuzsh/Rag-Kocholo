        "text": "Liz Truss, who was unveiled as Britain’s new Prime Minister on Monday, joins a group of over a dozen European women who are either president or prime minister of their country.\n\nHere is the list, which does not include Ursula von der Leyen, who became the first woman president of the European Commission in December 2019:\n\nBritain\n\nIn Britain, which is part of Europe but no longer part of the EU, Truss won the leadership race of the ruling Conservative Party, automatically making her leader of the country after Boris Johnson’s resignation in July.\n\nTruss is the third woman prime minister after “Iron Lady” Margaret Thatcher, who was in charge from 1979 to 1990, and Theresa May, who governed from 2016 to 2019 — all Conservatives.\n\nDenmark\n\nSocial Democrat leader Mette Frederiksen became her country’s youngest-ever prime minister in June 2019 when she was elected premier at the age of 41.\n\nDenmark’s first woman prime minister was Helle Thorning-Schmidt, also from the Social Democrats, who served from 2011 to 2015.\n\nEstonia\n\nFormer EU auditor Kersti Kaljulaid, 52, became the first female president of the Baltic state of Estonia in October 2016. The position is a largely ceremonial one.\n\nKaja Kallas in January 2021 became Estonia’s first woman prime minister. Her father Siim Kallas was prime minister from 2002-2004.\n\nFinland\n\nIn December 2019, Sanna Marin, a Social Democrat, became the youngest sitting prime minister in the world at the age of 34.\n\nFinland’s third female prime minister has been in the headlines recently over pictures of her dancing and partying with friends.\n\nFrance\n\nElisabeth Borne, a 61-year-old engineer, was named French prime minister in May, becoming only the second woman to hold the position after Edith Cresson, a Socialist, who held the job for less than a year in the early 1990s.\n\nGreece\n\nKaterina Sakellaropoulou, a trailblazing lawyer, was elected Greece’s first female president in January 2020.\n\nWhile the presidency is a mainly ceremonial role in Greece, Sakellaropoulou had already broken new ground in the judiciary by becoming president of the country’s top court in 2018.\n\nHungary\n\nKatalin Novak, a close ally of Prime Minister Viktor Orban and former minister for family policy, was elected Hungary’s first ever woman president in March 2022.\n\nThe presidency is a largely ceremonial role.\n\nLithuania\n\nLithuanian former finance minister Ingrida Simonyte, a 47-year-old rock and ice hockey fan, was appointed prime minister of a centre-right government in December 2020.\n\nLithuania has a strong tradition of female leadership, with “Baltic Iron Lady” Dalia Grybauskaite spending a decade in power from 2009 to 2019.\n\nSlovakia\n\nLiberal lawyer and anti-graft campaigner Zuzana Caputova, 48, took office in June 2019 as Slovakia’s first woman president.\n\nA political novice, she had comfortably beaten the ruling party’s candidate in elections. In Slovakia, the president has less power than the prime minister but can veto laws and appointments of senior judges.\n\nSweden\n\nDespite being a country that champions gender equality, Sweden never had a woman as prime minister before Magdalena Andersson, a Social Democrat, who won the top job in November 2021.\n\nAn economist who had served as finance minister for seven years, Andersson had a rocky start. Hours after becoming premier she resigned after her budget was rejected by parliament and the Greens quit her coalition. Four days later she was re-elected.\n\nRest of Europe\n\nElsewhere in Europe, outside the EU, other women currently in power are: Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili, Iceland’s Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir, Kosovo’s president Vjosa Osmani, Moldova’s president and prime minister Maia Sandu and Natalia Gavrilita, Serbia’s openly-gay Ana Brnabic, and Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon."
