        "text": "One of my favourite French expressions is ‘remercier’. Used not to thank someone, but rather to fire them. Or to ‘let them go’, as we so kindly put it in English. To me, ‘remercier’ illustrates all of the subtlety and indirectness of the French language, and why it is the language of diplomacy.\n\nNot that I would know much about that: I’m about as indirect and diplomatic as my French bulldogs.\n\nThis week Emmanuel Macron ‘thanked’ his prime minister for the past two years by accepting her resignation. Here again, it makes it sound like she wanted to leave. But no, essentially she was forced out so that the president could appoint a new prime minister who would in turn form a new government. Why? That’s where it gets interesting.\n\nIn France, the president is elected to run the country for a 5-year term (reduced from 7 years for the first time in 2002). The President of the French Republic is the head of state and the commander in chief of the armies. He is like the king, or at least the CEO. He gets to make all the tough decisions and takes the credit when things go well (or tries to as his political opponents sling mud). And when they don’t? He (or she, at least in theory – France has yet to elect a woman to this role) takes the blame. All of it. The French president is rarely very popular, unless he gives people more money or extra time off. Or the weather is particularly good that year, and all the public holidays fall near the weekend.\n\nThe ‘Premier Ministre’ or prime minister is appointed by the president to get the job done. In the words of Francois Mitterrand, the only French president I’ve known who seemed to have the respect of the people, when asked to describe his relationship with his PM: « Je décide, il exécute. » (I decide, he implements). The prime minister does the real work, getting his hands dirty, fighting in the political trenches as it were.\n\nSince Macron was re-elected in May 2022 and up until this week, the Prime Minister was Elisabeth Borne. She was only the second woman in French history to have been appointed to the role, after Edith Cresson in 1991. Borne certainly seemed competent and appeared to be doing a good job, a job she apparently wanted to keep. So why change?\n\nLow approval ratings for Macron. Rising popularity of the far right. And succession planning. There is now a limit of two consecutive terms as president. Macron is currently serving his second term and so will not be able to run again in 2027. So, he needs an heir apparent.\n\nEnter Gabriel Attal.\n\nThe youngest French prime minister ever, Attal is only 34. Even younger than Macron was when he became president at 39 back in 2017.\n\nI must say I liked Gabriel Attal the first time I saw him in his role as government spokesman a few years ago. He has a talent for communications which, while that may seem like a given, is not always the case in France.\n\nAnd, as I learned from the New York Times, Gabriel Attal is our first ‘openly gay’ PM. The French don’t discuss their political leaders’ private lives much. It is seen as bad taste, and nobody’s business but their own, unless they get caught lying or cheating. (I hear the cynics saying not ‘if’ but ‘when’.) I guess it was an open secret but as I haven’t followed French politics very closely, it was news to me.\n\nThis makes the new prime minister’s appointment not only a true ‘premier’ for France and, in my view, that’s good news.\n\nWhat do you think?"
