        "text": "Senior members of the European Parliament are warning that if the report finds the slightest evidence of wrongdoing by Cresson or any other European Commissioner – and it is widely predicted it will – those involved will have to resign.\n\nIf they do not, they say, the assembly will take the ‘nuclear option’ of dismissing President Jacques Santer and his entire team at a special plenary session on 22 March.\n\nThat would plunge the EU into crisis just two days before Union leaders meet in Berlin for a special summit aimed at getting agreement on the Agenda 2000 proposals for reforming key spending programmes.\n\nThe report, which is likely to run to 150 pages, will be delivered to Commissioners and senior parliamentarians at 5pm next Monday (15 March). The European Commission and the heads of Parliament’s political groups will then hold separate meetings to discuss its findings ahead of a meeting between Santer and party leaders the following day.\n\nWell-placed Commission and Parliament sources say the most likely outcome is that Cresson will be forced to resign, but that the rest of the team will stumble on for their remaining nine months in office.\n\nThe mood among MEPs has hardened since January, when they backed away from their threat to sack Santer’s team over allegations of cronyism, corruption and administrative incompetence.\n\nSocialist Group leader Pauline Green told members of the Parliament’s largest political grouping last week that “if, after investigation by the independent experts, any individual Commissioner is found wanting, then he or she must go. Gender, nationality and political affiliation is irrelevant.”\n\nThe Parliament’s second largest group, the Christian Democrats, has remained notably silent on the issue, but is almost certain to join Greens, Liberals, Nationalists and others in calling for heads to roll if the committee finds evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nSanter has also performed a U-turn from the ‘back me or sack me’ stance he took ahead of January’s censure vote and now accepts that if the behaviour of individual Commissioners is ‘called into question’ by the committee, then they must go.\n\nEight Commissioners have so far been hauled before the committee of five men and women to be grilled: Cresson and Santer, Manuel Marín, Emma Bonino, Erkki Liikanen, Sir Leon Brittan, Hans van den Broek and João de Deus Pinheiro.\n\nOf these, Cresson and Marín are the most vulnerable, although the likelihood of the Spaniard being forced out has faded since his face-saving performance before the Parliament in January.\n\n“We would like to get them all by the scruff of the neck and throw them in the canal, but short of that we will settle for Cresson,” said one MEP.\n\nIf Cresson is found guilty of wrongdoing but refuses to go voluntarily, Santer could take legal action in the European Court of Justice to try to force her out under Article 160 of the EU treaty. This states that if a Commissioner “no longer fulfils the conditions required for the performance of his duties or if he has been guilty of serious misconduct”, he or she can be compulsorily retired by the ECJ.\n\nCresson, who has been mired in controversy since the end of last year, has come under further attack since January’s vote, following the publication last month of a damning inquiry drawn up by the Commission’s own fraud-busting unit UCLAF into the Leonardo education programme, run by her department. The Commission has forwarded UCLAF’s findings to the Belgian police."
