        "text": "Edith Cresson (born January 27, 1934, Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, France) is known for being the premier of France from May 15, 1991, to April 2, 1992, the first woman in French history to serve as premier.\n\nDaughter of a French civil servant, she studied at the School of Higher Commercial Studies, earning a doctorate in demography, and in 1959 married Jacques Cresson, an executive with the automaker Peugeot. She joined the Socialist Party in 1965 and worked vigorously in François Mitterrand’s failed presidential campaign of that year. She ran unsuccessfully for a parliamentary seat in 1975 but was subsequently elected mayor of Thuré (1977), member of the European Parliament (1979–81), and mayor of Châtellerault (1983). After Mitterrand’s election to the presidency in 1981, Cresson served in a number of ministries—agriculture, tourism and foreign trade, industry and foreign trade, and European affairs—and became known for her outspokenness and combativeness."
