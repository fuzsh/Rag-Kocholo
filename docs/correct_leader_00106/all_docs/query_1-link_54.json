He first worked as second secretary at the French embassy in London in 1977 – 1978 and then as first secretary from 1978 to 1981. From 1981 through 1985, he worked at the Press and Information department in Paris before joining the EastWest Institute in New York City from 1985-1986. Between 1986 to 1990, Mr. Vimont was the second councillor at the Permanent Representation of France at the European Community in Brussels.
