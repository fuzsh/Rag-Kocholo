        "text": "The role of gender in the French executive is both a new and an old phenomenon. It is new in the sense that it has only recently attracted much attention from the public, the media and scholars, with the candidacy of Ségolène Royal in 2007 throwing the male-dominated tradition of the presidency into sharp relief. It is an old phenomenon, however, in many respects. The absence of women from the Elysée (the presidential residence) and, with the brief exception of Edith Cresson in the early 1990s, from Matignon (the Prime Minister’s residence) demonstrates the extent to which executive office in France has always been gendered to the masculine. Royal was by no means the first woman to stand for the presidency, although she was the first to qualify to the second round. Her predecessors include Arlette Laguiller, Huguette Bouchardeau, Marie-France Garaud, Dominique Voynet, Christine Boutin, Corinne Lepage and Christiane Taubira (Sineau 2008, 106). Furthermore, since the introduction of universal suffrage for electing the president in 1962, presidential elections in France have presented an unusual opportunity for women voters to make their presence felt and to put their concerns on the policy agenda, to the extent that Mariette Sineau credits presidential elections with ‘allow[ing] women to come out of a long period of political insignificance, finally making them visible and audible as autonomous political subjects’ (Sineau 2008, 10).1"
