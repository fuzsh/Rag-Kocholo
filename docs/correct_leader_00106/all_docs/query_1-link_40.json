        "text": "Title: FRANCE: FRENCH PRIME MINISTER MICHEL ROCARD RESIGNS AND IS REPLACED BY EDITH CRESSON\n\nSummary: (FILE - MAY 8, 1991) (VISNEWS) TS/GV ROCARD IN PARLIAMENT ANNOUNCING FRANCE JOINING GULF WAR\n\nEmbargoed: 30th May 1991 13:00\n\nKeywords:\n\nLocation: France, France\n\nCity:\n\nCountry: France\n\nTopics: Domestic Politics\n\nReuters ID: LVA7ZFVVMU1JDTLG2HSHPCF2RP8J\n\nAspect Ratio:\n\nStory Text: , SOVIET UNION\n\nFrench Prime Minister Michel Rocard resigned on Wednesday (May 15) after three years in office and was replaced by former European Affairs Minister Edith Cresson -- France's first woman prime minister.\n\nSixty-year old Rocard had been rebuked by President Francois Mitterrand for failing to reduce unemployment. Mitterrand has said he wants the government to pay more attention to social issues.\n\nPolitical analysts said Rocard's resignation does not mean the end of his political career. He has not openly declared himself a candidate, but he is reported to be keen to stand in the presidential election in 1995.\n\nCresson, who is 57, left Rocard's cabinet eight months ago in disagreement over economic policies. She will lead the government towards a general election due by 1993. Her appointment makes her one of the few women to hold a top public position in France since Joan of Arc led the country's armies nearly 600 years ago. Most French women ministers have held secondary posts and there are only four women in the outgoing 35-member cabinet of Michel Rocard. The French National Assembly rarely has more than 10 per cent of women among its 577 legislators, although they outnumber male voters.\n\nSpeaking on French television on Wednesday evening, Mitterrand said Cresson was the best person for the job of Prime Minister. He also expressed confidence in the future and said everything would be satisfactory if people stuck together.\n\n<strong>Source: BBC/REUTERS/REUTERS LIBRARY/TF1 1\" VIDEOTAPE</strong>\n\nCopyright Holder: FILE REUTERS (CAN SELL)\n\nCopyright Notice: (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2015.
