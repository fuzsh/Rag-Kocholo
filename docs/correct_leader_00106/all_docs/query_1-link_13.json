        "text": "Edith Cresson, the controversial former French prime minister and European commissioner, yesterday became the most senior EU official ever to be charged with fraud and abuse of confidence.\n\nIf found guilty she could be jailed for up to five years and the European commission would be likely to strip her of her generous EU pension of about £26,000 a year.\n\nMs Cresson - famed for her unwillingness to ever say sorry or admit fault - has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and alleges that the matter has been resurrected \"to damage France's image\".\n\nBut after a long investigation the Belgian authorities have charged her with fraud, forgery and abuse of confidence.\n\nShe is the first serving or former commissioner to face charges related to her time in office.\n\nThe move is highly embarrassing for France. It named her yesterday as one of the luminaries selected to sit on a special government panel tasked with shaping \"the future of Europe\".\n\nBelgian prosecutors allege that the Socialist politician committed serious and repeated fraud during her stint as EU research and education commissioner from 1995 to 1999.\n\nMore specifically they allege that she and her subordinates falsified contracts, forged other people's handwriting and embezzled EU funds for personal gain.\n\nMuch of the alleged wrongdoing is linked, they say, to her controversial decision to hire her dentist and close friend as a highly paid EU adviser on HIV/Aids, a subject about which he knew nothing.\n\nIt was revelations about her dentist, the late René Berthelot, which triggered the collapse of the entire commission in 1999.\n\nHe received some £85,000 for two years' work, during which time he produced a total of 24 pages of notes subsequently deemed to be of little or no value.\n\nSeven current and former EU officials who worked with Ms Cresson have been charged with similar offences as well as the more serious charge of corruption.\n\nThe Brussels public prosecutor's office must decide whether the investigating magistrate who filed the charges against Ms Cresson has made a strong enough case to bring her to trial. Under the Belgian judicial system the act of being charged and summoned to trial are quite distinct.\n\nPressure on Ms Cresson is building up from another quarter - her former employer, the European commission. Last week it sent her a letter giving her two months to answer similar, albeit less serious, allegations.\n\nIt has made it clear it will take her to the European court of justice and strip her of her EU pension if her answers fail to convince.\n\nMs Cresson is best known in the UK for claiming that one in four Englishmen is gay and for attributing the economic success of the Japanese to their \"ant-like\" qualities."
