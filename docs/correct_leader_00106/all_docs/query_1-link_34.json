        "text": "After nearly 20 years of presidential protection, the disgraced European education commissioner Edith Cresson was left defenceless yesterday as it became clear there would be no high-level pressure for her reinstatement.\n\nMs Cresson, aged 64, was defiant during radio and television interviews, but neither the French president's office nor the Socialist Party, of which she is a member, gave her any encouragement. The chill contrasted with the friendly patronage offered by the late Francois Mitterrand and, until recently, by his successor, Jacques Chirac.\n\nBut Ms Cresson's most resolute opponents are within the Socialist Party, where many of its leaders harbour resentment over their treatment when she was prime minister for 10 months in 1991 and 1992 and earned a reputation for arrogance.\n\n'She has become an embarrassment for the left as a whole,' one party official said. 'If she remained in the job there would be a howl of protest from her political enemies as well as the media which has been determined to topple her for months.'\n\nBecause of Ms Cresson's overbearing reputation and her Thatcher-like attitude towards male rivals, Lionel Jospin's Socialist-led government is now in an odd situation. While under pressure not to turn its back on a leftwing nominee it appears ready to support the reinstatement of a conservative, financial commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy, who is highly rated by both president and prime minister.\n\nThe atmosphere of revenge within the top ranks of the Socialist movement was also stoked yesterday by the French media. Ms Cresson has been mistrustful of the press since speculation that her promotion to prime minister was due to a special relationship with Mr Mitterrand, who called her his 'little soldier'.\n\nBut her running warfare with a hostile press corps has been compounded by revelations of what the EU Commission inquiry called her 'favouritism' in appointments of friends to 'fictional' jobs. Ms Cresson has used threats of libel action to cover up the precise nature of her relationship with a former dentist, Rene Berthelot, aged 70, a special scientific adviser with whom she shares a flat.\n\nYesterday, in one of many interviews in which she denied any wrongdoing, the education commissioner insisted Mr Berthelot was 'not my dentist' and had been recruited at Chatellerault, where she was mayor until 1997, to advise on the 'effects of ageing'. She was not pressed on reports that Mr Berthelot had only produced one short and apparently unused report.\n\nMs Cresson's critics in the press range from the rightwing financial magazine, L'Expansion, to the leftwing Liberation, which she tried to gag over what the paper calls the Cresson-Berthelot affair and her appointment of her hagiographer, Elisabeth Schemla, to another well-paid advisory post.\n\nIn an article headed 'Edith Cresson, more ego than euro', Liberation said yesterday that other commissioners had blocked Ms Cresson's bid for a Commission vice-presidency because she was too overbearing and had a 'gut hatred' for some officials.\n\n'Her political clumsiness in the Berthelot affair in which she complained of a German plot was badly thought out by a commissioner claiming to be supported by the president's and prime minister's offices,' the paper said. 'Few will regret her departure.'\n\nL'Expansion this month published a league table of commissioners in which Ms Cresson was bottom, with a mark of 11 out of 40. The score was accompanied by the comment that 'maintaining her in her post undermines the whole institution'.\n\nFirst in the table was the Belgian fair trading commissioner, Karel Van Miert (32 out of 40), Ms Cresson's most implacable enemy. They have clashed continually over policy, and Ms Cresson has accused Mr Van Miert of being an American lackey.\n\nL'Expansion's table placed the British commissioner Sir Leon Brittan fourth with 27 points and the remark: 'Obtains results despite French opposition.' His colleague Neil Kinnock (25) came sixth and was judged to be 'underestimated and a hard worker'."
