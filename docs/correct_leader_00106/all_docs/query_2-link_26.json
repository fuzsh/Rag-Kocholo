        "text": "PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron has chosen Elisabeth Borne, a left-leaning technocrat, to lead his new government, putting an end to weeks of speculation after the presidential election in April.\n\nBorne, 61, was named the new prime minister of France following the resignation of Jean Castex, the Elysée said Monday.\n\nBorne, the country’s second female prime minister after Socialist Edith Cresson in 1991-1992, will be in charge of steering through Macron’s controversial pension reform.\n\nThe president reportedly wanted to promote a woman, and said he wished to appoint “someone who was strong on social issues, environmental and production issues.”\n\nAfter a handover meeting with Castex, Borne said it was urgent “to act more quickly and more strongly” on climate change. “We can achieve that in uniting the strength of our regions more strongly,” she said, adding that the “right answers” will be found by staying “close to the French people.”\n\nShe dedicated her nomination to “all the little girls” in France who should follow their dreams. Her new government is expected to be announced in the coming days.\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nWith her experience as a senior civil servant in key areas, Borne brings a safe pair of hands to Macron’s inner circle as he pushes through a number of reforms over the next five years.\n\n“She has a very good track record and if we want to reach full employment, appointing a labor minister is a sensible move,” said a minister speaking on condition of anonymity, before the appointment.\n\n“She’s from the left and that is significant at the moment,” the minister noted.\n\nIn last month’s presidential election, far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon came in a close third with 22 percent of the vote, behind Macron and the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, and has vowed to lead the opposition against Macron. The president is under pressure to keep moderate left-wing voters on board, with a focus on ecology and welfare issues.\n\nBorne’s appointment was immediately slammed by Macron’s opponents on both the far left and the far right.\n\n“She is a sign of continuity for Macron, it’s a new season of social and environmental abuse that is opening,” Mélenchon said during a live video feed. “Her appointment is deceptive, we are told she is a woman of the left, but we don’t think she deserves that label.”\n\n“In appointing Elisabeth Borne as prime minister, Emmanuel Macron displays … his wish to continue his policy of disdain … of social destruction, of fiscal racketeering,” tweeted Le Pen.\n\nAfter appointing two conservative prime ministers during his first term, Macron has chosen Borne — a former head of the Paris metro network who has historically been close to the Socialist Party.\n\nA low profile\n\nA graduate of France’s elite Ecole Polytechnique, Borne served as Socialist Ecology Minister Ségolène Royal’s chief of staff in 2014 and has spent time working in the French civil service and the private sector.\n\nShe has also served as transport minister and ecology minister under Macron and shepherded reforms of rail company SNCF’s pensions system. Several union representatives hailed Borne’s “ability to listen” during talks to end strikes at the rail company in 2018.\n\nAs transport minister, Borne had the tough job of convincing the French public – and rail workers in particular – of the benefits of the free market, required by EU law. Ending state-owned SNCF’s monopoly and opening France’s railway market to competition was no easy task as she faced strong pushback from unions and massive strikes.\n\nBorne went on to spend less than a year as ecological transition minister in 2019-2020 and struggled to make her mark on the portfolio. She nonetheless managed to push through laws on clean mobility, long-term energy planning, waste and the circular economy. In her final weeks in office after the start of the coronavirus pandemic, she focused on boosting cycling.\n\nWhile Borne has worked on key reforms during Macron’s first presidential term, she is relatively unknown among the wider public. This should be an advantage in her relations with Macron, who had a more tempestuous relationship with his first prime minister, the popular Edouard Philippe, who harbors his own presidential ambitions.\n\nHowever, it also means she might struggle to impose her vision and lead her government with authority.\n\nSeveral other women, such as UNESCO chief Audrey Azoulay and the conservative former deputy speaker of the National Assembly, Catherine Vautrin, were reported to have been among those also considered for the job.\n\nUpcoming battles\n\nBorne will have little time to settle into her new post as France launches into parliamentary elections in June, in which both the far right and far left will likely pose a big challenge after their strong showings in the presidential election. Supporters, however, say Borne is used to facing opposition and landing results in her past appointments.\n\nBorne is also running as a candidate in the parliamentary elections for Macron’s La République en Marche party. Her name was circulated shortly after Macron won the presidential election, prompting speculation as to why he took so long to choose his prime minister. Some have asked whether Borne was his fallback choice for prime minister or whether he is seeking to shorten the campaign ahead of the June election.\n\nIn an interview with the Journal du Dimanche, Cresson said French politics remained a “macho” environment even three decades after she served as prime minister under President François Mitterrand.\n\n“She [Borne] will need lots of courage,” Cresson said.\n\nElisa Braun, Giorgio Leali and Louise Guillot contributed to reporting"
