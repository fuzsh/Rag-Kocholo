        "text": "[T]here was a fashion in France but also I think elsewhere to say that industry was finished and now it was services…I’ve always been against it, I was so angry…If there is no more industry, there is no more research. It’s clear. And if there is no more research, its the end. So industry is not simply smoky factories. The industry of the future is robotics, its fab labs [fabrication laboratories]…I have always pushed for research that had industrial applications.\n\nÉdith Cresson, Historical Archives of the European Union, interview, 6 May 2006, INT989, pp. 28-29\n\nÉdith Cresson served as Socialist Prime Minister of France (1991-1992); & later as European Commissioner for Science (1995-1999). As far as I am aware, Cresson pursued high-tech industrial policy as Prime Minister, notably, the attempted merger of Thomson & CEA-I. She also seems to have taken a pragmatic interest in privatization; and, indeed, later articulated libéralisme de gauche (c.f. UK’s Blairism) in relation to science and industry.\n\nOne should take note in this regard of her 1998 book with an austere name, Innover ou Subir; and her involvement in a now long-forgotten EU report, La Société, Ultime Frontière, or Society, The endless frontier (official English title obviously evoking the American report of 1945, Science, the endless frontier).\n\nAs such, I have a feeling Cresson stands across shifts in the way science and industry were seen in relation to the state in Europe through the 1990s, and indeed, may well be a crucial figure in these shifts. Astonishing levels of misogyny were directed against her & have thus far prevented objective appraisal of her record. These must be peeled away.\n\nBorn 1934 as Édith Campion, in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, Cresson graduated from HEC (business school) with a PhD entitled La vie des femmes d’agriculteurs et d’ouvriers dans le canton rural de Guémené-Penfao (Loire-Atlantique). Joining the Socialist Party in 1971, she was elected to public office for the first time in 1977; later, she successfully held many senior government positions including prime minister (I greatly profited from a biographical article: Morazzani, 2019, Women Leaders in European Foreign Policy: Édith Cresson).\n\nIn France, we are so convinced that we are better than the others, that if we have a very fine product or a very good idea, the others must accept it. [But] we don’t think that the other person might have something else in their head. Napoléon said: “What does the enemy want?”…the French never concern themselves enough with that. They believe it is enough to have a good idea, a fine product, a sound concept and everyone will find it marvelous and applaud. Things don’t happen like that.\n\nÉdith Cresson, Historical Archives of the European Union, interview, 6 May 2006, INT989, p. 11\n\nMy aim here is to gather my notes on Cresson’s agenda in relation to science & industry *from 1991 onwards*. This is just stuff I have gathered over the years, not a systematic analysis, or anything that can be taken too seriously. Basically, just trying to work out things like what was her vision? What can we learn from it today?\n\nIndustrial policy as French Prime Minister (1991-1992)\n\nToday we don’t even know what we want to do in nuclear power or electronics. We also don’t know what we expect of the public enterprises; we concern ourselves with them every three years at the time of the appointment of the CEO. No control. No directives….This is not a question of nitpicking interventionism [dirigisime tatillon], but rather of assuming one’s responsibilities as shareholder, just like any shareholder [which means] not only to pay, but to get involved, to understand the strategy, to discuss this strategy, and to come up with conclusions.’\n\nCresson, cited in Schmidt, 1996, From State to Market?: the Transformation of French Business and Government, p. 185\n\nThe above some very sensible sentiments, addressing as far as I can understand the age-old question of what state-owned firms ought to stand for in an otherwise capitalist society. While serving as French Prime Minister, Cresson seems to have searched for answers to this and related questions, as she pursued a high-tech industrial policy focused on electronics.\n\nHer rhetoric, reflecting as it did policy and business consensus in France, was that industrial policy had to be pursued at a European (rather than national) level, i.e., that the continent ‘dared not depend on other countries to supply products essential to its technological future or defense’ (Schmidt, op. cit., p. 172).\n\nCresson’s industrial policy apparently centered on the merger of the high-tech firms Thomson & CEA Industrie (CEA-I), with the goal of creating a kind of ‘Toshiba français’. (She also undertook partial privatizations of some French firms, notably in the oil and gas industry – Elf & Total.) The high-tech merger would, according to Pomian (1992), lead in subsequent steps to the restructuring of France’s electronics, IT, and telecommunications sectors, e.g., Bull, France Telecom, etc. – in Pomian’s terms, the ‘sea serpent’ of French industrial policy. As is of course well known, policy execution was cut short by Cresson’s firing from the Matignon after the regional elections.\n\n[Cresson’s] operation to merge Thomson-CEA-I had, at least in the speeches of its promoters, the appearances of un grand projet, although journalists did not hesitate to speak, from the start, of an industrial ‘Meccano set’…[But electronic] components remain much more abstract than an airplane or a telephone. The airplane lets one dream, and everyone needs a telephone. It is very difficult to explain to the general public why France must have its own [electronic] component industry when the French have become accustomed to buying Japanese electronics, considered to be the most reliable and the best.\n\nPomian, 1992, La dernière éclipse du volontarisme industriel: la fusion Thomson-CEA Industrie, in: Quaderni\n\nActions as European Commissioner for Science (1995-1999)\n\nIn the European Commission’s famous Growth, competitiveness, employment White Paper [1993]…it diagnosed ‘comparatively limited capacity to transform scientific breakthroughs and technological achievements into industrial and commercial successes’, and proposed to remedy this by building a ‘European research and technological development space’ on the foundations of the internal market. This project took shape under the aegis of Commissioner Édith Cresson…in a context where the ‘knowledge economy’ paradigm made ever stronger links between scientific, educational and industrial policies. The aim was to encourage national governments to stimulate knowledge production through research, its dissemination through education, as well as its economic impact through innovation. Henceforth, research, education and innovation inseparably defined the ‘knowledge triangle’.\n\nBruno, 2013, Éditorial: Ne cherchez plus, innovez! in: Revue Française de Socio-Économie\n\nCresson’s oversight as European Commissioner stretched across Science, Research and Development (DG XII), the Joint Research Centre, and Human Resources, Education, Training and Youth (DG XXII). The above quotation from Bruno supplies an overall strategic rationale for Cresson’s actions in Brussels; noting in particular the key guiding influence of the white paper published two years before Cresson entered the Commission.\n\nAll this being said synoptically, I feel it would be useful to know more of the detail on Cresson’s intellectual approach across what was a substantial portfolio. Regrettably, quick searches in French & English of Google Books, Google Scholar, & the relevant online archive databases (EUI, University of Pittsburgh) turned up little *online* material (see table below for what I found). I live in hope there is wonderful resource already out there that I have not seen (or will be soon).\n\nCresson’s apparent interest in intelligence économique (IE), and its connection to the activities described below (some of which all fall within that category), is of unknown significance. For example, the Green Paper cited in the table beneath makes explicit reference to IE (and related topics). It also references the European Commission’s Institute for Prospective Technological Studies in Seville, giving it a remit to support decision-making on new technology and its potential impact on employment (p. 22).\n\nThe corollary of the overall approach to innovation adopted throughout this Green Paper is “economic intelligence” as a strategic tool for decision-making against a background of globalized trade and the emergence of the information society. Economic intelligence can be defined as the coordinated research, processing and distribution for exploitation purposes of information useful to economic operators…Japan has quite deliberately made information management one of its strategic advantages. The United States is working on coordinating the exploitation and protection of their information potential via joint government/industry initiatives… Europe as a whole is still a long way behind its main rivals.\n\nGreen Paper on Innovation COM (95) 688, p. 19\n\nIE, while of course meaning literally what it says, seems to have meant more in the French policy discourse (& the European Green Paper), i.e., that France (& Europe) lacked it, as compared to alleged competitors. According to Monino & Sedkaoui (2016; p. 97), Cresson was the leading figure in French politics to call for IE to be applied in France and, during her tenure as prime minister, commissioned a report on it (rapport Martre; 1994).\n\nCareer after resigning from the European Commission\n\nI have not followed Cresson’s career subsequent to the Commission, but I found out she launched the Écoles de la 2e chance (E2C) initiative (noting the identical terminology in the 1995 Green Paper cited above).\n\nAn innovative system: the 2nd Chance Schools. My vision is that the 2nd Chance Schools give young people who have left the education system with neither diploma nor qualification the skills necessary for social inclusion, stable employment, & engaged citizenship [intégration sociale, professionnelle et citoyenne]\n\nCresson, undated, Le mot de la présidente\n\nConclusion\n\nHow to appraise Cresson’s record in terms of science & industrial policy? I simply lack the knowledge and understanding to draw conclusions, but at this juncture the following struck me as interesting lines of inquiry (the latter three relate, I think, to how her agenda impacts the wider picture of change)\n\nMisogyny\n\nThe first, and most obvious strand, is the extraordinary misogyny directed at Cresson. It is therefore fair to say that astonishing misogyny clouded appraisal of Cresson’s record (having myself read a good number of both French & English language articles about her – the salient feature is the misogyny). Even the infantilizing language about Meccano sets, cited above, seems suspect in this regard – & as Cresson herself noted, misogynists (les machos) could not tolerate an intelligent woman, let alone one in charge.\n\n2. Relationship of policies to long-standing struggle with high-tech industrial policy, at the nexus of IT, electronics, and telecom.\n\nI wonder if it is relevant here to note previous French (and, indeed, European) concerns about ‘falling behind’ in electronics & IT? These had led to R&D-focused investments such as Esprit (European Communities), Minitel (FR), and Alvey (UK) in the 1980s; not to mention France’s famous Cyclades scheme in the 1970s (co-developed with the American Arpanet). We could even go back to Plan Calcul (1966-1975); or the UK’s creation of International Computers Ltd (ICL) in 1968 as a national champion, under Tony Benn.\n\nNone of the above investments had created a European champion in electronics but perhaps reflect a long-running fixation on national (& European) champions. While these various projects are still in need of proper appraisal, they might possibly have reinforced the age-old saw that Europe was OK at state-backed R&D but not good at cashing in on it because it seemed to lack the big, market-dominating, firm to do so.\n\nAccordingly, merger, or lack thereof, of companies such as Thomson, Bull, and the like, had been a French government bugbear since the 1970s. France, and perhaps Europe, had been in a continuous search for an industrial policy in this high-tech field for decades (& the rhetoric remains remarkably similar today).\n\n3. Economic intelligence and relationship to rational action by the state.\n\nCresson seems to have had an interest in intelligence economique as a means to inform state action. This is reflected in the comments made by Monino & Sedkaoui regarding her commissioning of the rapport Martre while prime minister; and the later references to the idea in the European Commission’s 1995 Green Paper. I think this story would benefit from knowledge of how the French government related to information; I look for a French version of Thomas’ 2015 book Rational Action (which covers the American and British cases).\n\n4. Role in intellectual agenda of that intriguing and influential group on the French left, which also included Delors, Lamy, Strauss-Kahn (?), etc., associated with the first (early 1980s) Mitterrand government. Subsequent to the failure of the national approaches taken in that government, quest for European solutions.\n\nDSK served under Cresson as a minister; The 1993 European Commission White Paper noted above prepared under the Delors Commission and later implemented when Cresson took over as Commissioner. Various other connections. It seems, therefore, to understand what happened, one would really need to understand the intellectual history of this group (I lack that understanding and am never likely to gain it).\n\nMy current very limited understanding of this period in general is that different states sought different solutions to the problem of science and industrial policy in a globalized economy (i.e., where national investments could not, even in principle, accrue to the nation that made the investment). One solution (of a kind) was the science policy, pursued notably by UK from the 1980s (whereby one de-emphasizes application-oriented activities in favor of abstract R&D, often conducted in universities). A second solution was the kind of nationalist industrial policy proposed in the early 1980s Mitterrand government; this collided with the force of international capital. A third was the European knowledge economy rhetoric we noted above, which strongly emerged in the mid-1990s through Cresson, Bangemann, and others in the European Commission. Yet, at the point that Cresson was Prime Minister (early 1990s), it seems like the course was perhaps not fully resolved in any of these directions, at least in terms of French policy.\n\nWas there, indeed, a sincere attempt under the Cresson government to reposition the state in what were (and indeed still are) seen as industries of the future? Schmidt concludes Cresson had little room for maneuver; the state no longer had the tools, either in principle, or practice, to achieve the goals set. But of course, that was not actually tested. It is therefore, in my view, regrettable that Cresson was not given a chance to evolve her policy through the 1990s, in that it seemed to have elements of both national, and European, & therefore might have presented an interesting alternative.\n\nWhether or not Cresson’s agenda represented a new beginning in the search (still incomplete) to define an industrial policy in a globalized world, well, I cannot say. But developing an industrial policy in the conditions we face is difficult, and I am not sure anyone has yet produced a good answer.\n\nOverall – having read about her record I am left with considerable admiration for her intellectual and political agenda. She grappled with the key questions that remain as pertinent today, as they were when she was at the height of her political power. But I simply do not know enough to draw solid conclusions about the exact policy settings she chose; it seems to me, though, that Cresson’s work needs detailed and objective reappraisal, based on archives and other documents.\n\nIf we are to be objective, I suspect we might find that Cresson was a pivotal figure in the evolution of French and, indeed European, science and industrial policy.\n\nThe opening of the French economy to the world economy and the advancement of European integration weakened the ability of the State to intervene [unilaterally]. A policy made ‘against someone’, in this case, against the Brussels Commission, is not good policy; and it becomes difficult to justify in a period of hymns to the glory of European unity and the Maastricht Treaty. Especially since the EU is supposed to help share the increasingly high R&D costs for new technologies. The Thomson-CEA merger shows that when European industrial unity breaks down, States have great difficulty in inventing an adequate industrial policy.\n\nPomian, op. cit.\n\nNote on sources\n\nSanter Commission: hearing of Édith CRESSON, Commissioner-designate for Research, Science & Technology (1995)\n\nInterview with Édith Cresson (Paris, 29 January 2008), Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l’Europe (CVCE)\n\nWeizmann Institute President Appointed Special Advisor to Madame Edith Cresson (1997)\n\nResearch for Industry: Task Forces Established, in: Innovation & Technology Transfer, July 1995, p. 3\n\nEnergie, Poste et Telecommunications: quel avenir pour le service public en France et en Europe?, 26 March 1998 (record in U.S. Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information)\n\nFaure & Massacret, 1997, Le Livre blanc sur l’éducation et la formation: Objectifs, commentaires, bilan et perspectives\n\nDenéchère, undated, Les femmes dans la politique européenne de la France: une question de socio-histoire diplomatique\n\nCresson, 1999, Europe needs research, research needs Europe: main speeches on community research 1995-1999\n\nCVCE: Edith Cresson\n\nCroché, 2006, Qui pilote le processus de Bologne? in: Éducation et sociétés\n\nMorazzani, 2019, Women Leaders in European Foreign Policy: Édith Cresson).\n\nDrumaux & Mattijs, 1997, Organisation et légitimation de la politique industrielle européenne: le cas des programmes ESPRIT et Télématique, in: Politiques et Management Public\n\nAndré, 2006, L’espace européen de la recherche: histoire d’une idée, in: Journal of European Integration History\n\nBruno, 2011, Comment gouverner un « espace européen de la recherche » et des « chercheurs-entrepreneurs » ? Le recours au management comme technologie politique, in: Innovations\n\nBruno, 2013, Éditorial: Ne cherchez plus, innovez!, in: Revue Française de Socio-Économie: ’30 years ago, British liberal weekly The Economist was already saying: ‘Invented in Europe, patented in the United States, made in Japan’. Under this dramatic headline, it summarized the then widespread discourse on ‘eurosclerosis’; the Old Continent’s inability to escape the decline to which the 1973 crisis had condemned it, for lack of entrepreneurial daring, risk appetite and inventiveness. It was not enough to have ideas about how to make up for the lack of [cheap] oil, one had to convert them into useful innovations. This is the ‘European paradox’ which the Delors Commission wanted to tackle in 1993. In its famous Growth, competitiveness, employment white paper, imbued with ‘Schmidt’s theorem’ [idea attributed to German Chancellor Schmidt that ‘today’s profits are tomorrow’s investments, and jobs the day after’], it diagnosed ‘comparatively limited capacity to transform scientific breakthroughs and technological achievements into industrial and commercial successes’, and proposed to remedy this by building a ‘European research and technological development space’ on the foundations of the internal market. This project took shape under the aegis of Commissioner Édith Cresson, then Philippe Busquin, in a context where the knowledge economy paradigm made every stronger links between scientific, educational and industrial policies. The aim was to encourage national governments to stimulate knowledge production through research, its dissemination through education, as well as its economic impact through innovation.
