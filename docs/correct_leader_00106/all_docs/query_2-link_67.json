        "text": "Synopsis\n\nBorne, 61, succeeds Jean Castex, whose resignation was expected after President Emmanuel Macron's reelection last month. Macron and Borne are expected to appoint the full government in the coming days. Borne is the second woman to hold the position after Edith Cresson, who was prime minister in 1991-1992 under Socialist President Francois Mitterrand.\n\nElisabeth Borne was appointed France's new prime minister on Monday to become the second woman to hold the post in the country.\n\nBorne, 61, succeeds Jean Castex, whose resignation was expected after President Emmanuel Macron's reelection last month.\n\nMacron and Borne are expected to appoint the full government in the coming days.\n\nBorne is the second woman to hold the position after Edith Cresson, who was prime minister in 1991-1992 under Socialist President Francois Mitterrand.\n\nShe has served as Labor Minister in Macron's previous government since 2020. Before that, she was transport minister and then minister of ecological Transition, also under Macron.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Jean Castex resigned Monday in an expected move after the reelection last month of centrist President Emmanuel Macron, who will quickly name a replacement.\n\nCastex came to the Elysee presidential palace on Monday to formally offer his resignation, which the president \"accepted,\" the Elysee said in a statement.\n\nMacron is expected to name a new prime minister shortly. French media say Labor Minister Elisabeth Borne is the favorite for the job. In France, it's common for presidents to have more than one prime minister during their terms.\n\nMacron and his new prime minister will then hold talks in order to appoint France's full new government in the coming days.\n\nThe new prime minister's first mission will be to make sure that Macron's centrist party and its allies do well in France's parliamentary election in June. The vote, scheduled for two rounds, will determine which group holds the majority of seats at the National Assembly, which has the final say over the Senate in France's law-making process.\n\nMacron also promised a bill addressing the rising cost of living in France, where food and energy prices are surging. It will be prepared by his new government and is expected to be presented just after the parliamentary election.\n\nIf Macron's party wins a majority in the Assembly, the prime minister will then need to ensure that pension changes promised by the president are put into law, including raising the minimum retirement age from 62 to 65. The proposed changes have been criticized by workers, unions and left-wing voters.\n\nMacron also promised that the new prime minister would be directly in charge of \"green planning,\" seeking to accelerate France's implementation of climate-related policies. Macron vowed to go \"twice as fast\" in his second term to curb greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhy leading doctors and scientists pin hope on green jackfruit to fight fatty liver and cancer\n\nYoungsters are roaming around derivatives fire.
