        "text": "French Prime Minister Edith Cresson is at the center of a furor over an interview in which she was quoted as saying 25 percent of Anglo-Saxon males were homosexual. Conservative lawmaker Tony Marlow declared Monday that Parliament should \"stand up for\" the British.\n\n\"Mrs. Cresson,\" he said, \"has sought to insult the virility of the British male because the last time she was in London she did not get enough admiring glances.\"\n\nLondon newspapers were quick to defend the English male, and the tabloids dredged up cliches abut \"Gay Paree,\" noting that some French men carry handbags and kiss each other in public.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph said the reported remarks by Cresson, France's first woman prime minister, were unfair. If British Prime Minister John Major painted such a stereotype of French women, he would be \"turned out of office\" for racism and sexism.\n\nCresson was quoted as responding to a suggestion that in Anglo-Saxon countries men preferred the company of other men: \"Yes, but the majority of these men are homosexual _ perhaps not the majority _ but in the U.S.A. there are already 25 percent of them, and in England and Germany it is much the same.\"\n\nOther quotes:\n\n\"In France, it's seen as all right if a man . . . has affairs, casual flings. In America I know he mustn't, but here . . . that sort of thing is part of ordinary life. . . . I see nothing unseemly about it _ rather amusing, in fact.\"\n\n\"I believe that women have exactly the same sexual appetites as men do; there is no difference, and women also can have passing affairs in the same way as men. I do not think that in either case it is . . . something to be laughed at; it is simply a biological fact.\""
