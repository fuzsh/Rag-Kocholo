        "text": "At the Palais de Matignon, the French prime minister's residence, Elisabeth Borne has moved down to the first floor. The second-floor windows needed to be changed. Her austere office had been identically reproduced in the Salon Bleu room, which looks out on the garden. Unlike former prime minister Edouard Philippe, who readily commented on his favorite objects – an artillery saber or a naval anchor – the second-ever woman to hold the position displays nothing personal. There is only one photo of her, in the company of an Indigenous Amazonian chief. There is also a poster of the Route du Rhum sailing race, a model of a metro train – a souvenir of her time as director of the Paris transport system – and some green plants. Behind her desk, there is a drawing by the son of an aide. \"A dragon,\" she explained, surprised that no one had recognized the creature.\n\nMs. Borne welcomed Le Monde to her office on August 1. She insists on being called \"Madame la première ministre\" – in Edith Cresson's time (under President François Mitterrand), the title was referred to by the masculine \"le premier minister,\" even when held by a woman. Ms. Borne was preparing to leave for vacation in the south of France, after signing the budget instructions to be sent to the ministries on Monday, August 8. She wore a strict black dress, her short hair the same color as her eyes, silver. She was exhausted. The legislative session had been rough and eventful. But it ended with the adoption of the budget amendment bill and a bill on purchasing power. It was a hard-fought victory for the government, which lost its absolute majority in June and must now deal with a turbulent opposition. \"We were concerned that we would not be able to secure a majority,\" she said. \"I put a lot of effort into examining how we could find a way forward. The French wanted us to show that we could work together, build compromises.\"\n\nSince her appointment on May 16, Ms. Borne has met all the parliamentary group presidents. Drawing on her e-cigarette, she asked them all the same straight question: \"What do you intend to do?\" Olivier Marleix, who leads the right-wing group Les Républicains (LR) in the Assemblée Nationale, appreciated these \"new\" considerations and the fact that the Polytechnique graduate \"does not pretend.\" \"She is an engineer who, when faced with a problem, tries to find solutions – an asset, in these circumstances. There is nothing worse than sensing the fake friendliness of those who try to manipulate you.\" She found the same goodwill from the LR leader in the Sénat, Bruno Retailleau, who considered her profile \"out of step with the return of politics\" but praised her \"frankness\" and her \"technical knowledge.\" The conversation was more heated with the president of the Parti Socialiste (PS) group, Boris Vallaud, who was chief of staff for a left-wing minister at the same time as she was, under President François Hollande. Ms. Borne asked him if the Socialists were prepared to form a coalition with the government. Mr. Vallaud answered no. She insisted:"
