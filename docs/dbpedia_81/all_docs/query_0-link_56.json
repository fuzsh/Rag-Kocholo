        "text": "On November 2, 2011, the US Congress awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor this nation can bestow, on the 100th Battalion, the 442nd RCT, and the Nisei who served in the Military Intelligence Service. Over 300 veterans of the 100th, the 442nd, and MIS from across the land, many in wheelchairs and some of them with oxygen tanks, received the honor at the US Capitol Building, Emancipation Hall. Eight members of Congress, led by former Speaker John Boehner, paid high tribute to the military role played by Nisei during WW II. National press coverage, including TV, was extensive.\n\nHighlights of the three-day program included the US Congress presentation of the CGM at the US Capitol, US Army Tribute to the 100, 442, and MIS, laying of wreaths at the National WW II Memorial, a gala dinner, and a program at the National Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism, where the names of over 800 Nisei who died in line of duty are inscribed on a granite wall. The inclusion of MIS and arrangements of these events were made by the National Veterans Network (NVN), an association of Nisei organizations and supporters headed by Christine Sato-Yamazaki. Lieutenant General Joseph F. Peterson and Major General Antonio M. Taguba served as principal liaison with the US Army. VA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki’s remarks at the CGM Gala Dinner can be read here.\n\nTo see Bill S. 1055, click here. The added significance of PL 111-254 is US Senator Daniel Inouye’s signature as President Pro Tempore of the US Senate, a position that is 3rd-in-line for the Presidency. In January 1942, shortly after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the draft classification for Japanese Americans was changed from 1-A (eligible for military duty) to 4-C (alien, unfit for military duty). It is remarkable that by 2011, a Japanese American could be 3rd-in-line for the Presidency in case of an emergency. Reforms since the end of WW II speak of the greatness of America.\n\nThe Congressional speakers were House Speaker John Boehner; U.S. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader; U.S. Congressman Adam Schiff, House sponsor of PL 111-254; Ralph Hall of Texas; U.S. Senators John McCain, Chairman Senate Armed Services Committee; Barbara Boxer, sponsor of PL 111-254; Mitch McConnell, Minority Leader; Harry Reid, Majority Leader, and Daniel Inouye. Senate Chaplain Barry C. Black and House Chaplain Patrick Conroy provided the opening and closing invocations, respectively. Each speaker, except Inouye, spoke eloquently of the loyalty, courage and patriotism of the Nisei in combat in Europe and Asia while many of their families were detained at home in barbed wire enclosed detention camps guarded by armed sentries. Inouye, the only Congressional speaker who received a standing ovation before and after his brief remarks, thanked the U.S. Congress and the American people “for this extraordinary distinction” and said the honor applies to all Nisei veterans of WW II and the men who sacrificed their lives to protect our freedom. Speaker Boehner presented the CGM consecutively to the three veterans, allowed each veteran to hold it momentarily and retrieved it each time. Boehner then passed the CGM to a representative of the Smithsonian Institution, the custodian of all CGMs. The US Mint also produced bronze replicas of the CGM. At the November 2nd dinner at the Washington Hilton Hotel, Ms. Donna Fujimoto Cole of Houston, TX, presented each Nisei veteran with a CGM replica in bronze. This photo shows, from left to right, Hamasu, Boehner, Ito, U.S. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, Ichikawa, and U.S. Senator Inouye.\n\nWe hope our presentation of photos, videos, printed matter and narratives have contributed to your knowledge of the Japanese American experience during WW II and its Legacy. Please let us know if we have met or not met your expectations, if we have failed to address certain issues, if we have embellished the facts, if you wish to challenge a point, or, if you have a question: javapotomac@gmail.com."
