        "text": "Major General Alfred M. Gruenther, representing Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson in the official ceremony at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey on July 3, 1946, enumerated the decorations and awards won by the 442nd and said, “Your outstanding record was unsurpassed by any other unit of comparable size.”\n\nGruenther said every Division in the 5th Army wanted the Nisei and soon the Sixth Army Group succeeded in getting the 442nd transferred to France. General Mark Clark, Commander of the 5th Army in Italy obtained General Dwight Eisenhower’s approval for the return of the 442nd to break the 6-month stalemate on the Italian front. Gruenther said “You participated with distinction in the final attack which brought about the surrender of the German group of Armies in Italy on May 2, 1945.”\n\nYour outstanding record was unsurpassed by any other unit of comparable size.\n\nMajor General Alfred M. Gruenther\n\nThe National Veterans Network collaborated with the the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service, and the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center to share the extraordinary story of the 100th Infantry Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team and Military Intelligence Service on a seven-city tour. The original Congressional Gold Medal along with war time photos and objects were on display at seven prominent history museums nationwide attracting 325,000 visitors in a span of 32 weeks."
