        "text": "My fathers comments:\n\nMy Congressional Gold Medal Experience\n\nby Francis Masateru Fukuhara\n\nOn November 2, 2011 the Congressional Gold Medal was bestowed upon the 100th Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the Military Intelligence Service in recognition of their outstanding accomplishments during World War II. These segregated units of the United States Army were composed mostly of Nisei who in the fear and hysteria following the bombing of Pearl Harbor were illogically classified by the draft board as 4-C, a designation of enemy aliens regardless of their native born, American citizenship.\n\nIn the spring of 1943, the Army decided to form a segregated Nisei combat unit, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, which would be deployed in Europe. Early in 1944, their draft designation was changed from 4-C to 1-A and Nisei men were actively drafted primarily as replacements for the 100th/442nd Regimental Combat Team and for training as linguists in the MIS for deployment in the war against Japan. For the relatively short time they were permitted to serve, in both the European and Asian War Theatres, the Nisei accomplishments were extraordinary. The 100th/442nd RCT was the most highly decorated unit in U.S. military history and one of their battles was included among the ten most important battles in United States history.\n\nThe linguists of MIS participated in almost every major air, sea and land battle in the war against Japan. The language and intelligence expertise provided by the Nisei of MIS gave a huge strategic advantage to the Allied Forces in the Pacific War. The Nisei of MIS were credited by General MacArthur’s Chief of Intelligence for shortening the war by two years with commensurate savings in resources and manpower. All of this was accomplished by the Nisei while many of their family and friends were still incarcerated in concentration camps by the very government for which they fought.\n\nFor me, the Gold Medal Presentation Ceremony was a remarkable experience. Having lived through the insult of being classified an enemy alien by my own beloved country; suffering the humiliation of being evacuated from my home and incarcerated behind barbed-wire in one of America’s concentration camps; and being eye-witness to the rampant anti-Japanese social/economics of pre-World War II and West Coast America, the messages conveyed at the ceremony were particularly heart-warming. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that the most powerful people in the nation would rise, one after the other, to condemn the racial prejudices of the past and applaud the accomplishments of the Nisei soldier!\n\nI was particularly surprised at the presence and remarks of Senator John McCain, the senior Senator from Arizona. The same McCain who voted against Martin Luther King Day and Redress for Japanese Americans had high praise for the Nisei soldier and commented on the bipartisan support for the CGM award. I felt the CGM Award Ceremony was a once in a lifetime event for Japanese Americans.\n\nThe Congressional Gold Medal is the highest honor awarded by Congress. The award is as old as this nation with the first Medal awarded to George Washington by the First Continental Congress. It has since been awarded 146 times to such famous inventors such as the Wright Brothers and Thomas Edison, humanitarians like Mother Teresa, Pope John Paul II and Dalai Lama and athletes such as Jesse Owens, Jackie Robinson. As Gold Medal recipients we have very illustrious company.\n\nI was always told that you are known by the company you keep. The CGM was a totally unpredictable honor which I shared not because of any particular accomplishment, other that being associated with some extremely high achievers, the Nisei Veterans in World War II.\n\nReflecting back to November 2, 2011, it was my honor to accompany my father, Samon Horii to this once in a lifetime, historic event to receive the Congressional Gold Medal and to attend the ceremony at the U.S. Capitol. My father served in the Military Intelligence Service.\n\nWhen my father made this trip to Washington DC, he was 95 years old, healthy and still quite active. I remember, he was so happy and excited that he was going for the first time to see the U.S. Capitol, National World War II Memorial, the National Japanese American Memorial, Arlington Cemetery to see the Changing of the Guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, the many Smithsonian Museum and much more. My husband, Russell and I were so glad we were able to share in this wonderful experience with him.\n\nNow, we have many memories and stories to share with our children so they can appreciate the importance of the sacrifice and service the Nisei soldiers did for our country. Looking back, we are very thankful that we always made the time to be a part of his amazing life. In 2019, my father passed away at the age of 103 years old. He lived a long and fascinating life. From his many stories, we all learned so much from him. Our family will always cherish all of the memories and stories we have and this is my father’s legacy that will live on with our children and future generations.\n\nIn Loving Memory of Samon Horii\n\nJoyce Horii Chung & Russell Chung\n\nHow proud Dad was to receive the award. The 2011 CGM event was so well organized and made the vets and families feel very special during that weekend. Dad enjoyed seeing friends and connecting with the other vets. Unfortunately, he became ill right before the formal ceremony at the US Capitol and had to spend a night in the hospital. Members of the 100th Battalion visited him and other Nisei vets there. The doctors and nurses worked diligently so he could be released in time for the banquet. Before he was discharged, the medical staff came to congratulate him. In a separate incident, when our family was waiting at the airport to return home, a man asked if Dad was a CGM recipient, asked to see the medal and thanked him for his service. He offered Dad his first-class seat and also told the flight crew about the award. The pilots came back to speak with him. During a layover in Omaha, the flight attendant made an announcement that Dad was on the plane and the passengers gave him a round of applause.\n\nAfter the event Dad’s face lit up whenever the subject came up. For a man who never talked very much about it before, he willingly shared his award and his MIS experience in Japan with family and Colorado organizations, including Valley High School (Platteville) and the Lakewood Heritage Center. He was so honored and cherished the CGM, and we (his family) feel the same. Thank you.\n\nCongressional Gold Medal Ceremony: A Personal Reflection\n\nby Gloria Kumagai\n\nOn October 31, 2011, my brother, Alex, my husband, Steven Savitt, and I took my dad, Hisashi “Butch” Kumagai, to Washington, D.C. for the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony. This event honored the Japanese American soldiers of the 100 Infantry Battalion, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, and the Military Intelligence Service (MIS). The medal is Congress’ highest civilian award.\n\nApproximately 300 Japanese American veterans made the trip, bringing their families with them, spanning four generations – Nisei, Sansei, Yonsei, and Gosei – totaling about 2,500! There were over 30,000 Japanese Americans who served in WWII. Aging and health prevented many from attending. I felt fortunate that Dad, at 93 years old, could make the trip. It was an emotional sight to see the veterans, many of whom came with their walkers, wheelchairs, and canes. Unfortunately, one veteran passed away, and two veterans were hospitalized due to heart problems during the time we were there.\n\nDad and I had to board a bus on the day of the ceremony at 7:00 a.m. to go to the U.S. Capital Visitor Center. We sat in Emancipation Hall until 11:00 a.m. when the ceremony began. Dad sat with the veterans; Alex and I sat in an auditorium and watched a live broadcast of the ceremony. Steve watched the ceremony at the hotel. Speakers included House Speaker John Boehner, Senator Daniel Inouye, and Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. Senator Barbara Boxer and Representative Adam Schiff, both Democrats and sponsors of the legislation honoring the Japanese American soldiers, also spoke. Senator John McCain told the vets that they did everything and more that was asked by our country.\n\nThanks to private donors, each veteran received a replica of the Congressional Gold Medal. The original medal is in the Smithsonian. The medal can be ordered from: http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/medals/?action=medal&ID=30\n\nDad visited the hospitality area as much as possible to find and re-connect with his buddies from the G Company. Five of them attended the ceremony. He also re-connected with the wife of his foxhole buddy, who passed away in 2000. It was eye-opening to hear their stories of growing up and their experiences during the war. These were very fortunate individuals who made it home. Dad rarely spoke about the war when I was growing up. I found out how he was registered as an enemy alien while in camp. He signed up for civilian defense training and was released from camp. Two days later, he was given the status of A1 and drafted into the army!\n\nDad had the energy to visit the World War II memorial. We also went to the National Japanese American Memorial that was built with private donations from the Japanese American community. I discovered that two of my uncles were donors. This memorial is a must see if you visit Washington, D.C.\n\nA gala dinner was the concluding activity, attended by over a thousand persons. General Eric Shinseki, who waa head of the Veteran Affairs Department, was the featured speaker and received a standing ovation. Three stories of vets were shared, which told of the experiences, sacrifices, and subsequent post-WWII life – typical of Japanese American soldiers. This was the highlight of the program. The dinner was a nice way to celebrate the awarding of the medal and acknowledge the vets again.\n\nThis was a once in a lifetime event – unforgettable – which I am glad that I was able to share with my Dad. It certainly deepened my understanding of and appreciation for our WWII Japanese American vets. This event also presented an opportunity to recognize the richness of the legacy the vets are leaving us.\n\nGloria Kumagai\n\nVeterans: Kenichi Matsuoka, Kaname Takemoto, Tom Asaki, Goro Asaki, Chuck Inada, Harry Kiyomura\n\nUnits: Military Intelligence Service, 100th Infantry Battalion, 442nd RCT\n\nLily’s husband Kenichi Matsuoka was an instructor at Camp Savage, Minnesota, and then as a Staff Sergeant was sent to Warrenton, Va. There he was in charge of a group of kibeis at the Army Signal Corp. where they translated Japanese codes, etc… Lily was the only wife at Warrenton and gave birth to Karen there.\n\nAlice Takemoto, of Kensington, Maryland, was the wife of Kenneth Kaname Takemoto; originally from Kauai, HI, he served in the 100th Btn as an infantryman and combat medic in Co B and Med Co. He was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster. His professional career spanned 32 years as a scientist at the National Institute of Health.\n\nHarriet Ishimoto was on the staff of Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives. Serving in the district office, Harriet coordinated developmental activities with the Nikkei community, and after the ceremony, coordinated the Gold Medal’s tour with the Smithsonian Institution. Harriet’s father, Harry Kiyomura of San Mateo, CA, served in HQ Co, 100th, in Italy and during the Occupation. He was awarded the Bronze Star during his service in Italy and received his gold medal in a ceremony hosted by Rep. Zoe Lofgren (CA).\n\nHarriet’s husband, Norman Ishimoto, had three uncles receiving the medal, two posthumously. Present for the ceremony was Goro George Asaki, a veteran of the MIS. He served in the Battle for Manila and in the Tokyo area during the Occupation.\n\nTwo of Norm’s uncles served in I Co: Goro’s elder brother Tom Asaki of Hanford, CA, and Charles (Chuck) Inada, of Gilroy, CA. Neither would speak of any experiences; they each were awarded the Purple Heart. We know further of their military service only that Tom (even though the eldest son of five so exemptible, and with six sisters) enlisted immediately after Pearl Harbor, and was trained as a medic before activation of the 442.\n\nNorm’s father, Paul Itsuo Ishimoto, enlisted in the MIS but was disqualified due to having recently survived tuberculosis; he was first interned in Hillcrest TB Sanitarium. He was able to serve in the last year of the war with the Research and Analysis unit of the Office of Strategic Services in Washington, DC.”\n\nA year prior to the Ceremony, dad had a debilitating stroke that left his left side paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair. It was questionable if he was going to able attend. My sisters and I were conflicted; a cross country plane flight? The logistics were complicated. Everything seemed like an obstacle. I was nervous. I was so concentrated on simply getting him there.\n\nBut it all became very clear as soon as we arrived in Washington DC.\n\nBeing handicapped, Dad and I were the last to leave the plane. But outside of the arrival tunnel, there had assembled a throng of veterans and local families. When we made our way down, they saluted, they cheered, they applauded. Tears welled up in Dad’s eyes. It became clear at that very moment that this was very important. This was very special. This was a recognition of a lifetime and I was thankful that it was happening and that we had made the effort to make sure that dad had a part of it. The commemoration and events were yet to come, but, with this moment, we knew how significant this time was.\n\nOn November 2nd, 2011 our family witnessed history. The United States Congress awarded the Congressional Gold Medal to the 100th Infantry Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team and Military Intelligence Service. Seeing these veterans gathered in the United States Capitol Visitor Center, Emancipation Hall before members of the United States Congress was awe-inspiring. After almost 70 years the country finally recognized the extreme conditions under which the Japanese American soldiers served and their valiant sacrifices on the battlefield while their families were incarcerated in internment camps. Their loyalty and allegiance was questioned and denied by their country, but these veterans still chose to serve. The Army leadership in attendance acknowledged the bravery of these men and recognized the soldiers who did not make it home. It was a proud moment for the Taniguchi family, the Japanese American community and the country.\n\nThe celebration continued at the Congressional Gold Medal Gala Dinner where there was an energy that filled the room. It was a wonderful culmination of the ceremonies as President Barack Obama congratulated these Japanese American heroes and passed along the country’s gratitude to these dedicated soldiers on behalf of the United States of America.\n\nWe shared these special moments with wives, uncles, aunts, cousins and friends who came from all over the country to recognize the heroism of our Dad, Kazuto Taniguchi, 442nd, L Company; Uncle Victor Matsui, MIS; and friends Sam Yokota, 442nd, L Company and Harry Kanada, 442nd, K Company. Our family was honored to be there for these World War II veterans who exemplified what it truly means to be an American and fight for their families and their country. These veterans received a long overdue honor that recognized their loyalty and significant contributions during a time of discrimination.\n\nI was the co-chair of the San Diego CGM Ceremony on March 11, 2012 in San Diego. I was at the Capitol for the CGM ceremony on November 2, 2011 and received the CGM for my uncles, Frank Mitoshi Wada and Ted Teruo Wada. After I returned to SD from WA, I talked to several JA organizations in SD and asked for their help to present CGM to eligible veterans living in SD. With the help of the SD JACL, VFW Post 4851 and Japanese American Historical Society of SD, I was able to purchase CGM replicas from the US Mint and present 59 CGM to 442nd and MIS veterans. The CGM ceremony in SD was planned in less than 45 days and we had an overflow attendance of 540. Unfortunately, we were not able to get a group photo of all the recipients. Our photographer did take some photos of individual families.\n\nSince the March 11, 2012 ceremony, I have personally present an additional 22 CGM to families of eligible veterans. I was provided an eligibility list from Jim Yamashita back in 2012 and communicated with him and Terry Shima on making sure I was presenting CGM to eligible veterans/families."
