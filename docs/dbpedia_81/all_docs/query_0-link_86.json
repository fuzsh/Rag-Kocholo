        "text": "3-320th FA COMMENTS\n\nHello, all - your trusty scribe here. Lots going on this last week here at Kandahar Airfield. Several different VIPs, including the Chief of Staff of the Army, GEN Eric Shinseki, and the Commander of the Screaming Eagles, MG Richard Cody, visited us. They took the opportunity to pin on dozens of awards to deserving soldiers who participated in Operation Anaconda, and to award the \"combat patch\" - the authorization to wear the 101st Airborne Division patch on our right sleeves. I have a feeling that everyone will have their sewing kits out tonight. I'll provide a roll-up next week of everyone who received an award. As of this writing, MG Cody is still in the process of getting around to all of the units here on KAF, so they haven't all been awarded just yet. Also, we're still standing by to receive the plan to re-deploy back to the states. No news just yet. In the meantime, we're all keeping our heads in the game, and continuing to train and prepare for future missions.\n\nMajor Dennis W. Yates\n\nBrigade Fire Support Officer LTF 626th COMMENTS\n\n\"This is the first time since World War II that the U.S. Army has fought directly for the American people...and everyone I meet asks me to pass on their gratitude to the great Rakkasans...\"\n\nParaphrased from Gen. Eric K. Shinseki's (Army Chief of Staff) address to Task Force Rakkasan, Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan 7 April 2002.\n\n(BG Cody and SGT Langford)\n\nWhat a great week. Some of our Army's most prominent leaders have taken time from their busy schedules to visit our soldiers in Afghanistan and to thank them for their patriotism, sacrifice and effort. Sergeant Major of the Army Jack Tilley led off the all-star cast as he spoke to LTF NCOs, passing on leadership advice and passing out coins. Not far behind, was Army Chief of Staff, General Eric Shinseki, who pinned Bronze Stars and Air Medals on some of our Task Force Rakkasan soldiers. Among the honorees were our very own Sergeants First Class Wright and Wade of HQ/A Company, who have been recognized for their extraordinary contribution to the success of Operation Anaconda (see photos). Later that day, MG Cody, COL Wiercinski, and CSM Hill honored Assurgam soldiers by awarding Meritorious Service Medals to SGT Huddleston, SPC Muex, SPC Walker and gave a host of other awards to Assurgam warriors for their accomplishments. MG Cody and DCSM Hill remained behind afterward to share a meal and talk to our soldiers.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, our Commanding General swore in three great soldiers for reenlistment. In the photo you'll see SGTs Langford and Neufeld (of Maintainer fame), and SPC Sagun (B 626) in front of the Tori on Kandahar Airfield. Reenlistment in a combat zone is particularly rewarding, because our soldiers are making a patriotic decision to remain with the team (and financially rewarding because the bonuses are TAX FREE!) Discussions are under way for potential replacement dates and units for Task Force Rakkasan. I know that this has been weighing heavily on your minds. Rest assured, as soon as we know, we'll let you know. We plan to notify the rear detachment as soon as a decision is reached, though I have a feeling that the news will spread very quickly. I hope that you are all enjoying the spring weather in Tennessee and Kentucky. Though the weather here has been relatively mild, spring just hasn't been the same without the trees, gardens, family and friends. We're all looking forward to our Fort Campbell reunion. Have a great week and please keep us in your thoughts and prayers; you are in ours. Assurgam 6...out\n\nTF 3-101st\n\nAVN COMMENTS\n\nIt has been a busy week for 3-101 Aviation Regiment. This week saw the arrival of several VIPs from the United States including the Chief of Staff of the Army, GEN Eric Shinseki, and the 101st Airborne Division Commander, Major General Richard A. Cody. General Cody spent some time in our area presenting awards to several soldiers for their actions during Operation Anaconda. Additionally, he presented the battalion with the 101st Combat patch to be worn on the right shoulder and was able to find time to eat a dinner of spaghetti with about 30 of our soldiers. Yesterday, MG Cody flew up to Bagram where there was another awards ceremony for the soldiers up there. Both Fox News and CNN were present and we're hoping you got to see some video clips back in the states. There were also several print journalists and photojournalists present so we are optimistic about the press coverage. The big news around Kandahar is that they have erected both a PX tent that is fairly well stocked and another shower tent that has almost completely eliminated the lines. We have two new morale phones set up so hopefully communications to the rear will work out more smoothly. The limiting factor for outgoing phone calls, however, is the satellite switch which can only hold so many voice lines at once, so we sometimes spend 10-15 minutes dialing and re-dialing phone numbers hoping to get through. Below is a picture of MG Cody talking to the Battalion after our awards ceremony here in Kandahar."
