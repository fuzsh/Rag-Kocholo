        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP -- Tommy R. Franks,\n\nthe Army general who commanded U.S. forces to battlefield victories in Afghanistan\n\nand Iraq, has decided to retire after 36 years in uniform.\n\nFranks made no announcement, but\n\nDefense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld issued a brief statement Thursday saying\n\nFranks had informed him ''of his desire to step down as the commander of the\n\nU.S. Central Command in the weeks immediately ahead'' and plans to retire from\n\nthe Army this summer.\n\n''He has served our country with\n\ngreat distinction,'' Rumsfeld said. ''I consider myself privileged to have worked\n\nso closely with him over these many months.''\n\nThe White House has not said who\n\nwill be named to replace him as head of the military command most-directly involved\n\nin the global war on terrorism. The job requires Senate confirmation.\n\nFranks' senior deputy in the Persian\n\nGulf, Army Lt. Gen. John Abizaid, is considered a leading candidate for the\n\ntop job. The command is responsible for U.S. military activities in 25 countries,\n\nfrom Kazakhstan in Central Asia to the Arabian Peninsula to the Horn of Africa.\n\nAnother candidate is Franks' other\n\ndeputy, Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Michael DeLong.\n\nIt had been widely expected within\n\nthe military that Franks would retire after deciding not to take the Army chief\n\nof staff post that will be relinquished June 11 by Gen. Eric Shinseki.\n\nHis normal two-year term at Central\n\nCommand was extended for one year in July by Rumsfeld, who worked closely with\n\nFranks on Afghanistan and Iraq war plans.\n\nMilitary analysts generally give\n\nFranks high marks for the war plans he conceived for Afghanistan and Iraq. Both\n\nachieved success with relatively few U.S. casualties.\n\nPHOTO:\n\nFRANKS:\n\nIraq victory.\n\n(End of published text\n\nThe St. Petersburg Times quoted\n\nFranks' wife, Cathy, as saying she was pleased that her husband was ready to\n\nkeep a promise he made early in their marriage -- that at some point he would\n\nretire.\n\n''I'm glad to know that he's a man\n\nof his word,'' she said.\n\nShe said it was possible the general\n\nwould stay on the job until fall if it took that long to get a replacement confirmed\n\nby the Senate. His one-year extension is to expire July 1.\n\nFranks is 57 and has served as head\n\nof a warfighting command; there are few options within the military for him.\n\nHis recent predecessors at Central Command have retired after serving in that\n\npost, including Norman Schwarzkopf, who led U.S. forces to victory against Iraq\n\nin 1991.\n\nLike President Bush, Franks grew\n\nup in Midland, Texas. He attended the same high school as first lady Laura Bush,\n\nwho was a year behind him. Tommy Ray, as he was known while growing up, loved\n\nfast cars, Elvis and hunting, according to boyhood friends.\n\nAfter two years at the University\n\nof Texas at Austin, Franks dropped out and joined the Army. He was commissioned\n\na second lieutenant in 1967 as a graduate of the Artillery Officer Candidate\n\nSchool at Fort Sill, Okla., and in short order he was serving with the 9th Infantry\n\nDivision in Vietnam.\n\nAfter the Vietnam war, Franks intended\n\nto leave the military but stayed on when selected for the Army's ''Bootstrap''\n\ndegree completion program for promising officers. He attended the University\n\nof Texas at Arlington.\n\nBush has called Franks a ''down-to-earth,\n\nno-nonsense guy.''\n\nThe Army has taken Franks from one\n\nworld hot spot to another -- the demilitarized zone in Korea, a changing Europe,\n\nthe Iraqi desert as deputy commander of the 1st Cavalry Division during the\n\nfirst Gulf War.\n\nHis commendations have included\n\nfour Legion of Merit medals, three Bronze Stars with ''V'' for valor, an Air\n\nMedal with ''V'' and an Army Commendation Medal with ''V.''\n\nJust months after Franks took charge\n\nof Central Command in July 2000, suicide bombers blew a hole in the USS Cole\n\nas it refueled in Yemen, killing 17 American sailors. It was Franks who had\n\napproved Yemen as the refueling site, a decision questioned by some in Congress\n\nbecause of anti-American sentiment in that country.\n\nThe Cole attack was only a taste\n\nof the worldwide terror threat that reached America on Sept. 11, 2001. On Sept.\n\n12, Franks got the order from Rumsfeld to draw up military options for the president.\n\nLess than a month later, on Oct. 7, the airstrikes in Afghanistan began.\n\nFranks said in a speech months ago\n\nthat he already had worn the uniform for a long time.\n\n''My wife reminds me frequently\n\nhow long I've worn it,'' he said. ''She reminds me that I told her on the day\n\nwe were married I was going to get out of the United States military. I remind\n\nher that some day I am going to.''\n\n------\n\nOn the Net:\n\nFranks' official biography: http://www.centcom.mil/aboutus/cdrbio.htm\n\nCentral Command: http://www.centcom.mil"
