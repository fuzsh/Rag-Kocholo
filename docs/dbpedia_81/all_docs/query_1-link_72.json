        "text": "While the San Diego Padres enjoyed a day off before their series against the Washington Nationals, catcher Kyle Higashioka visited the National Museum of the United States Army in D.C. Higashioka was there to accept a medal honoring his grandfather, G. Shigeru Higashioka, who fought in World War II as part of the 100th Infantry Battalion.\n\nKyle Higashioka, known for his defense-first catching and timely home runs, grew up in Southern California and has recently been traded from the New York Yankees to the Padres. Beyond his baseball career, he carries a family legacy. His grandfather, G. Shigeru Higashioka, was a Japanese American who served in the Army from 1943 to 1945 while his family was imprisoned in an incarceration camp in Salinas, California.\n\nDespite being classified as “enemy aliens,” many Nisei soldiers, including Higashioka’s grandfather, fought for the United States. Their contributions were largely unrecognized until the unit was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2011. On July 22, Kyle Higashioka received a replica of the medal.\n\nReflecting on his grandfather’s service, he mentioned the difficult position Japanese Americans were in during the war and the choice they made to prove their loyalty through military service. Kyle Higashioka military ties extend to both sides of his family, and his work with the Special Operations Warrior Foundation led the MLB Players Trust to connect him with the National Veterans Network.\n\nChristine Sato-Yamazaki, Executive Director of the National Veterans Network, helped uncover details about Higashioka’s grandfather’s service. He was a student in Tulsa in 1943 before joining the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, which played a crucial role in Italy and France. During his museum tour, retired Gen. Eric K. Shinseki explained that G. Shigeru Higashioka had been awarded a Bronze Star for his bravery and likely qualified for a Purple Heart.\n\nThe research also revealed that Kyle’s great uncles, who were interned in camps during World War II, played baseball to pass the time. Baseball had been a significant part of the Japanese American community even before the war. When forced into camps, they formed teams within their barracks. A camp newspaper confirmed that Higashioka’s great uncles played baseball at the Poston War Relocation Center.\n\nKyle Higashioka, who knew about his other grandfather’s service in the Pacific Theater and his baseball skills, was surprised to learn about his great uncles’ involvement in baseball. Despite the hardships faced, perseverance and a love for baseball were evident traits passed down through the generations."
