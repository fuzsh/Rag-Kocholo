        "text": "Patriot Award\n\nThe Patriot Award is the highest award the Society can bestow to an individual. The award is reserved for those persons who, through their life’s work, have distinguished themselves as Americans dedicated to freedom and the ideals represented by the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. Their dedication to freedom evidences no limitations; their love of fellow man is not qualified; their allegiance to our flag with full understanding of its demands is without reservation.\n\nBob Hope Award for Entertainment\n\nThe Bob Hope Award is reserved for those persons who, through their life’s work in the entertainment industry, have distinguished themselves by outstanding service to or positive portrayal of the United States Military in literature or film.\n\nBob Hope dedicated much of his 80-year career to entertaining American troops both at home and abroad. He went straight to the center of a crisis to deliver a reminder of home to those serving our country, just when they needed it most. Bob Hope used his talents to heal by showing his compassion, empathy, uplifting spirit, and respect for country."
