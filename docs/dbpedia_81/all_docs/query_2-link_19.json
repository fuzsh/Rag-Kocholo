Waxman, from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, submitted the following FIRST REPORT together with ADDITIONAL VIEWS On July 17, 2008, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform approved and adopted a report entitled ``Misleading Information from the Battlefield: The Tillman and Lynch Episodes.'' The chairman was directed to transmit a copy to the Speaker of the House. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report summarizes what the Oversight Committee has learned about (1) the misleading information given to the Tillman family and the public following the death of Corporal Patrick Tillman on April 22, 2004, and (2) the misleading information released about the capture and rescue of Private Jessica Lynch in Iraq in March and April, 2003. Corporal Tillman and Private Lynch are the two most famous soldiers in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The misinformation in both their cases is an unconscionable distraction from their actual service and heroism. Their dedication to country and willingness to voluntarily put themselves at great risk are extraordinary examples of patriotism and bravery. The military has conducted seven separate investigations into Corporal Tillman's death by friendly fire in the mountains of Afghanistan. Two early Army investigations focused on reconstructing the events that resulted in the shooting. The scope of later investigations was broadened to include evaluations of whether military officials complied with the Army's casualty notification regulations, whether military personnel involved in Corporal Tillman's death committed criminal acts, and whether the previous investigations had been properly conducted. These investigations have looked down the chain of command, resulting in punishment or reprimands for enlisted personnel and officers who acted improperly before and after Corporal Tillman's death. To date, the highest ranking officer to receive a punishment related to Corporal Tillman's death is a three-star general. In contrast, the Committee's investigation into Corporal Tillman's fratricide has looked up the chain of command. The purpose of the investigation has been to determine what the top officials at the White House and the Defense Department knew about Corporal Tillman's fratricide, when they knew this, and what they did with their knowledge. The Committee's investigation adds many new details to the Tillman story. But on the key issue of what senior officials knew, the investigation was frustrated by a near universal lack of recall. The Committee interviewed several senior officials at the White House, including Communications Director Dan Bartlett, Press Secretary Scott McClellan, and chief speechwriter Michael Gerson. Not a single one could recall when he learned about the fratricide or what he did in response. Similarly, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld told the Committee: ``I don't recall when I was told and I don't recall who told me.'' The highest-ranking official who could recall being informed about Corporal Tillman's fratricide was former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers, who said, ``I knew right at the end of April, that there was a possibility of fratricide in the Corporal Tillman death.'' General Myers testified that it would have been ``logical'' for him to pass this information to Secretary Rumsfeld, but said ``I just don't recall whether I did it or not.'' He also said he could not recall ``ever having a discussion with anybody in the White House about the Tillman case, one way or another.'' The Committee's investigation into the inaccurate accounts of Private Lynch's capture and rescue also encountered a consistent lack of recollection. Witnesses who should have possessed relevant information were interviewed by the Committee. They said they had no knowledge of how the report that Private Lynch fired her weapon and was wounded during her capture was spread to the media and the public. Nor could they explain why it took so long for the military to correct the inaccurate story of the ``little girl Rambo from the hills of West Virginia'' that was widely reported during the opening days of the Iraq war. The White House Response to Corporal Tillman's Death The death of Corporal Tillman on April 22, 2004, generated a flurry of attention and action inside the White House. On the day following his death, April 23, White House officials sent or received nearly 200 e-mails concerning Corporal Tillman. Several e-mails came from staff members on President Bush's reelection campaign, who urged the President to respond publicly to Corporal Tillman's death. The White House did respond, rushing out a statement notwithstanding a Department of Defense policy intended to provide a 24-hour period for private grieving before officials publicly discuss a casualty. In comparison to the extensive White House activity that followed Corporal Tillman's death, the complete absence of any communications about his fratricide is hard to understand. The Committee requested all White House documents related to Corporal Tillman. The White House provided what it described as a complete response, giving the Committee access to approximately 1,500 pages of e-mails and other documents and withholding only drafts of a speech in which the President discussed Corporal Tillman. Yet there is not a single discussion of the fratricide in any of these communications. On April 29, 2004, Major General Stanley McChrystal sent a ``personal for'' or ``P4'' memorandum up his chain of command. This memo warned that the President might be preparing a speech about Corporal Tillman without knowing that he was killed by friendly fire, and it urged the generals receiving the memo to prevent any ``unknowing statements by our country's leaders which might cause public embarrassment if the circumstances of Corporal Tillman's death become public.'' When the President spoke about Corporal Tillman's death in a speech at the White House Correspondents' Dinner two days later, the President commented on Corporal Tillman's character and his sacrifice in enlisting, but did not address the circumstances of Corporal Tillman's death. The Committee interviewed seven officials in the White House about the response to Corporal Tillman's death. Universally, these officials said they could not recall when they learned about the fratricide or when the President learned. Former presidential speechwriter Michael Gerson, who worked on the President's May 1 speech at the Correspondents' Dinner, said that he could not remember when he learned about the friendly fire, whether he knew about it while preparing the Correspondents' Dinner speech, or whether he ever discussed the fratricide with the President. Former Communications Director Dan Bartlett said he did not have a ``specific recollection'' of when he learned of the friendly fire. Asked whether he informed the President of the fratricide, he stated, ``I don't remember a particular conversation, but I can't rule out that I talked to him about it.'' Former Press Secretary Scott McClellan said he also could not remember when he or the President learned about the fratricide. Secretary Rumsfeld's Response to Corporal Tillman's Death Secretary Rumsfeld took a personal interest in Pat Tillman's enlistment in the U.S. Army Rangers in 2002. Just after Corporal Tillman enlisted, Secretary Rumsfeld sent him a personal note commending him for his ``proud and patriotic'' decision. Around the same time, Secretary Rumsfeld wrote a ``snowflake'' memorandum to the Secretary of the Army, noting that Corporal Tillman ``sound[s] like he is world-class'' and saying, ``We might want to keep our eye on him.'' Testifying before the Committee, Secretary Rumsfeld said he had no recollection of when he learned about the fratricide or what he did in response. He testified, ``I don't recall when I was told and I don't recall who told me. But my recollection is that it was at a stage when there were investigations under way.'' General Myers's Response to Corporal Tillman's Death The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Richard Myers, learned of Corporal Tillman's death soon after it occurred. One day after Corporal Tillman's death, General Myers called the commissioner of the National Football League to inform him of the incident. General Myers also learned quickly about the possible fratricide. He told the Committee that he knew by the end of April, but could not recall whether he informed Secretary Rumsfeld or President Bush. General Myers did recall discussing the fratricide with his public affairs advisor, telling him, ``We need to keep this in mind in case we go before the press. We've just got to calibrate ourselves. With this investigation ongoing, we want to be careful how we portray the situation.'' General Myers told the Committee that he had no responsibility to share the information about the possible fratricide with the Tillman family or the public. General Abizaid's Response to Corporal Tillman's Death General John Abizaid, commanding general at CENTCOM and the main addressee on General McChrystal's P4 message, testified that due to a delay at his headquarters, he did not receive the P4 message until approximately May 6, 2004, a week after it was sent. When he finally received the message, he immediately called the Joint Chiefs chairman, General Myers, and discovered that General Myers was already aware of the potential fratricide. General Abizaid also testified that after returning from theater to Washington, DC, he informed Secretary Rumsfeld sometime between May 18 and May 20, 2004, that ``there was an investigation that was ongoing, and it looked like it was friendly fire.'' The Response of Other Senior Military Leaders to Corporal Tillman's Death The Committee investigated the response of other top military leaders in Corporal Tillman's chain of command, including General Bryan Brown of U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and Lieutenant General Philip Kensinger of U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC). General Brown testified to the Committee that he received General McChrystal's P4 message in late April, but made no effort to notify his superiors or the Tillman family about the potential fratricide. He said he made the ``bad assumption'' that these tasks would be handled by the ``normal chain of command.'' General Kensinger declined to testify before the Committee in August 2007, but later agreed to be interviewed by Committee staff. He acknowledged that he did not inform the Tillman family as soon as he found out about the potential fratricide, but claimed that he only learned about the fratricide after attending the May 3, 2004, memorial for Corporal Tillman. This version of events was contradicted by General Kensinger's deputy, Brigadier General Howard Yellen, who told Committee staff that he spoke with General Kensinger about the fratricide within two or three days after it occurred. It was also contradicted by Lieutenant Colonel David Duffy, who testified that he personally delivered the P4 message to General Kensinger three days before the memorial service, and by Colonel Clarence Chinn, deputy commander of the 75th Ranger Regiment, who testified that General Kensinger informed him that Corporal Tillman's death was a possible fratricide. The Response to the Capture and Rescue of Private Jessica Lynch In the opening days of the Iraq war, a false account of the capture and rescue of Private Jessica Lynch became a front-page story across the country. Defense Department officials have openly acknowledged that the account of Private Jessica Lynch's capture and rescue in the opening days of the Iraq war was an ``awesome story,'' but they could not explain to the Committee how and why the embellished account became so widely disseminated. Key public affairs officials told the Committee they could not recall any details of the Jessica Lynch incident. I. INVESTIGATIONS INTO CORPORAL TILLMAN'S DEATH A. INVESTIGATIONS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE There have been seven investigations conducted by the Department of Defense into the death of Corporal Tillman in Afghanistan on April 22, 2004, and the Department's response. Each investigation has had serious flaws or limitations on its scope. In the days following Corporal Tillman's death, the 2nd Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment conducted an Army Regulation 15-6 investigation (commonly referred to as a ``15- 6'' investigation) into the circumstances surrounding the casualty.\\1\\ This investigation reportedly concluded that Corporal Tillman's death was a likely fratricide.\\2\\ In a subsequent review of this investigation, the Defense Department Inspector General concluded that it was ``tainted by the failure to preserve evidence, a lack of thoroughness, and the failure to pursue investigative leads.'' \\3\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Captain Richard M. Scott, Commander, Headquarters & Headquarter Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, AR 15-6 Final Report [Incomplete Draft] (Apr. 29, 2004). \\2\\ Id. Although a complete draft of Captain Scott's report has not been located, the Department of Defense Inspector General collected available drafts and exhibits and identified Captain Scott's major findings. Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Review of Matters Related to the Death of Corporal Patrick Tillman, U.S. Army, at 7 (Mar. 26, 2007) (IPO2007E001). \\3\\ Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Review of Matters Related to the Death of Corporal Patrick Tillman, U.S. Army, at 2 (Mar. 26, 2007) (IPO2007E001). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- In early May, the commander of the 75th Regiment decided not to approve the battalion-level investigation because ``he did not find the work thorough or complete and concluded further investigation by someone more senior from the regimental level was required.'' \\4\\ He instead authorized a new regimental-level 15-6 investigation, which was approved by U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) on May 28, 2004.\\5\\ This investigation concluded that ``CPL Tillman's death was the result of fratricide during an extremely chaotic enemy ambush.'' \\6\\ The Inspector General found this second 15-6 investigation also ``lacked credibility,'' in part because the investigator ``failed to visit the scene,'' ``failed to identify and interview relevant witnesses,'' and drew conclusions that ``were not based on evidence included in the report.'' \\7\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ Id. at 20. \\5\\ U.S. Central Command, Report of Fratricide Investigation (May 28, 2004) (containing May 8, 2004, AR 15-6 report by Lieutenant Colonel Ralph L. Kauzlarich, Executive Officer, 75th Ranger Regiment). \\6\\ Id. at 1. \\7\\ Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Review of Matters Related to the Death of Corporal Patrick Tillman, U.S. Army, at 2, 31-32 (Mar. 26, 2007) (IPO2007E001). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- In August 2004, after an inquiry from the Tillman family, Army officials discovered that another investigation required by Army regulations, a ``safety investigation,'' had not been initiated.\\8\\ Three months later, in October 2004, the friendly fire incident was belatedly reported to the Army's Safety Center, which produced a report in December of that year.\\9\\ The safety report concluded that a ``high volume of fire'' from several Rangers ``struck one of the Rangers in the fighting position, fatally wounding him.'' \\10\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ Id. Army rules require both a 15-6 ``legal'' investigation and a prompt safety investigation in cases of fratricide. Army Regulation 385-40 (1994); DOD Instruction 6055.7 (2000). \\9\\ Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Review of Matters Related to the Death of Corporal Patrick Tillman, U.S. Army (Mar. 26, 2007) (IPO2007E001). \\10\\ U.S. Army Safety Center, U.S. Army Accident Report, Date of Accident 040422 (undated). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- In response to further inquiries from the Tillman family, the Army's Special Operations Command (USASOC) authorized in November 2004 another 15-6 investigation into the events surrounding Corporal Tillman's death. This investigation was completed in January 2005.\\11\\ The scope of this investigation included not only the circumstances of Corporal Tillman's death, but also subsequent communications within Corporal Tillman's chain of command.\\12\\ One of this investigation's conclusions was that the Army's failure to immediately tell the Tillman family about the fratricide suspicions was ``due to a desire to complete the investigation and gather all available facts, so as not to give the family an inaccurate or incomplete picture of what happened.'' \\13\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ Brigadier General Gary M. Jones, U.S. Army Special Operations Command, Army Regulation (AR) 15-6 Investigation--CPL Patrick Tillman (Jan. 7, 2005). \\12\\ Id. \\13\\ Id. at 10. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Reviewing this third 15-6 investigation, the Defense Department Inspector General concluded that the report ``did not address accountability for failures by the chain of command--to comply with Army policy for reporting and investigating friendly fire incidents, to coordinate with other investigative authorities, to provide timely information concerning suspected friendly fire to CPL Tillman's next of kin, and to ensure accuracy in documentation submitted in support of the Silver Star'' posthumously awarded to Corporal Tillman.\\14\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\14\\ Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Review of Matters Related to the Death of Corporal Patrick Tillman, U.S. Army, at 3 (Mar. 26, 2007) (IPO2007E001). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- After Corporal Tillman's family and others questioned the thoroughness and objectivity of this fourth Army investigation, the Department of Defense Inspector General and the Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID) undertook concurrent investigations into Corporal Tillman's death. The results of these two investigations were provided to the Acting Secretary of the Army, Pete Geren, on March 26, 2007.\\15\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\15\\ Id. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The IG investigation found that ``Corporal Tillman's chain of command made critical errors in reporting Corporal Tillman's death and in assigning investigative jurisdiction in the days following his death.'' \\16\\ The IG also determined that a Silver Star posthumously awarded to Corporal Tillman was based on documents with ``materially inaccurate statements'' that ``erroneously implied that CPL Tillman died by enemy fire.'' \\17\\ An official from the Inspector General's office testified before the Committee that the IG concluded that two statements written in support of the Silver Star award had been altered ``somewhere in the approval chain.'' \\18\\ But he stated that his office did not attempt to determine which computers were used to alter the statements or who had access to the statements when they were altered.\\19\\ Nevertheless, the IG concluded that Corporal Tillman's ``immediate superiors believed his actions merited the award'' notwithstanding the friendly fire.\\20\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\16\\ Id. at 2. \\17\\ Id. at 54. \\18\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Testimony of Thomas Gimble, Acting Defense Department Inspector General, Hearing on Misleading Information from the Battlefield, 110th Cong., at 99 (Apr. 24, 2007) (Serial No. 110-54). \\19\\ Id. \\20\\ Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Review of Matters Related to the Death of Corporal Patrick Tillman, U.S. Army, at 54 (Mar. 26, 2007) (IPO2007E001). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The CID investigation concluded that the soldiers who fired at Corporal Tillman ``believed they were under enemy fire and were returning fire at enemy combatants.'' \\21\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\21\\ U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, Report of Investigation into Death of Corporal Tillman and AMF Soldier Thani, at 2 (Mar. 19, 2007). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Neither the IG nor the CID investigation examined the actions of top military leaders including the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. For example, neither report determined whether these leaders were forwarded General McChrystal's P4 message. On the same day the IG and CID reports were completed, March 26, 2007, Acting Secretary Geren directed the commander of the Army Training and Doctrine Command, General William Wallace, to independently review the findings of the earlier investigations into Corporal Tillman's death.\\22\\ As a four- star general and one of the highest-ranking officers in the Army, General Wallace had the authority to independently investigate the matter and discipline officers below his rank. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\22\\ Executive Summary, Army Action--Department of Defense Inspector General (DoDIG) Report Related to the Death of Corporal (CPL) Patrick D. Tillman (undated). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- On July 31, 2007, the Army wrote Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Tom Davis that General Wallace had completed his review and generally supported the findings of the IG and CID investigations.\\23\\ This letter also informed the Committee that General Wallace had sanctioned seven officers for their actions in the aftermath of Corporal Tillman's death.\\24\\ The officers sanctioned included four general officers and three field-grade officers. The highest-ranking officer to be sanctioned was now-retired Lieutenant General Philip Kensinger, the former commander of the Army's Special Operations Command (USASOC).\\25\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\23\\ Letter from Major General Galen B.

Tillman (undated). \\25\\ Id. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Also on July 31, 2007, Army Secretary Pete Geren publicly announced General Wallace's findings. Although he denied that there was a ``conspiracy . . . to deceive the public,'' he stated: [T]here was a perfect storm of mistakes, misjudgments, and a failure of leadership that brought us where we are today, with the Army's credibility in question about a matter that strikes at the very heart of Army core values--our commitment to our fallen soldiers and their grieving families; soldiers' loyalty to fallen soldiers.\\26\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\26\\ Defense Department Briefing with Secretary of the Army Pete Geren and Vice Chief of Staff of the Army General Richard Cody (July 31, 2007). CENTCOM Commander General John Abizaid, in testimony before this Committee, assessed the military's response to Corporal Tillman's death more bluntly, saying, ``It's very difficult to come to grips with how we screwed this thing up. But we screwed this thing up.'' \\27\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\27\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Testimony of General John Abizaid, Hearing on the Tillman Fratricide: What the Leadership of the Defense Department Knew, 110th Cong., at 217 (Aug. 1, 2007) (Serial No. 110-49). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- B. THE COMMITTEE'S INVESTIGATION The Committee began its investigation into Corporal Tillman's death in April 2007. On April 24, 2007, the Committee held a hearing during which it received testimony from two members of Corporal Tillman's family, an Army Ranger who was an eyewitness to Corporal Tillman's death, the acting Department of Defense Inspector General, and the commander of the Army Criminal Investigation Command.\\28\\ The Committee also took testimony from former Private First Class Jessica Lynch, who described the misinformation surrounding her capture and rescue in Iraq in 2003. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\28\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Hearing on Misleading Information from the Battlefield, 110th Cong. (Apr. 24, 2007) (Serial No. 110-54). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Members of Corporal Tillman's family and Private Lynch testified that government officials spread inaccurate accounts of what happened to Corporal Tillman and Private Lynch on the battlefield. They stated that these misleading narratives provided inspiring stories of heroism for the American public, but they fundamentally mischaracterized the two soldiers' actual conduct and sacrifice. Corporal Tillman's brother Kevin Tillman, a former Army Ranger who served together with his brother in Afghanistan, testified that the story of Corporal Tillman's death by enemy fire that spread in the weeks after his death was ``utter fiction,'' and said he believed it was intended to distract the public from the unsuccessful siege of Fallujah, the emerging story of detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib, and other bad news about the war.\\29\\ He stated: ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\29\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Testimony of Kevin Tillman, Hearing on Misleading Information from the Battlefield, 110th Cong., at 17 (Apr. 24, 2007) (Serial No. 110-54). In the days leading up to Pat's memorial service, media accounts, based on information provided by the Army and the White House, were wreathed in a patriotic glow and became more dramatic in tone. A terrible tragedy that might have further undermined support for the war in Iraq was transformed into an inspirational message that served instead to support the nation's foreign policy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\30\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\30\\ Id. Following the April 24, 2007, hearing, Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis decided that the Committee's investigation into Corporal Tillman's fratricide would focus on the actions of officials at the top of the chain of command. Specifically, the Committee sought to determine when the President, senior White House officials, the Secretary of Defense, and other top military leaders learned that Corporal Tillman had been killed as a result of friendly fire and what they did upon learning this information. The Committee also posed questions regarding the dissemination of misleading information pertaining to the capture and rescue of Private Lynch. The Committee held a second hearing on August 1, 2007, during which it received testimony from former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld; former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Richard Myers; former commander of U.S. Central Command, General John Abizaid; and former commander of U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), General Bryan Brown, about their knowledge of the circumstances of Corporal Tillman's death.\\31\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\31\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Hearing on the Tillman Fratricide: What the Leadership of the Defense Department Knew, 110th Cong. (Aug. 1, 2007) (Serial No. 110-49). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- In the course of the Committee's investigation, the Committee requested that the White House produce all documents received or generated by any official in the Executive Office of the President from April 22 until July 1, 2004, that related to Corporal Tillman.\\32\\ The Committee reviewed approximately 1,500 pages produced in response to this request. The documents produced to the Committee included e-mail communications between senior White House officials holding the title of ``Assistant to the President.'' According to the White House, the White House withheld from the Committee only preliminary drafts of the speech President Bush delivered at the White House Correspondents' Dinner on May 1, 2004.\\33\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\32\\ Letter from Henry A.

Fielding, Counsel to the President, to Henry A. Waxman, Chairman, and Tom Davis, Ranking Minority Member, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (Aug. 10, 2007). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The Committee also conducted nontranscribed interviews of three former assistants to the President: former Director of Communications Dan Bartlett, former Press Secretary Scott McClellan, and former Chief Speechwriter Michael Gerson. Because these officials indicated they had only a limited recall of the events in question, they were not called back for a transcribed interview or deposition. Transcribed interviews were conducted with four other former White House officials: former Spokesman Taylor Gross, former Director of Fact-checking John Currin, former National Security Council (NSC) Director of Communications Jim Wilkinson, and former NSC Press Secretary Sean McCormack.\\34\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\34\\ No contemporaneous transcript was produced from the interview with Mr. McCormack, but an unofficial transcript was created from an audio recording of the interview. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The Committee reviewed over 31,000 documents produced by the Department of Defense. The Committee conducted transcribed interviews of six current or former general officers: General Bantz Craddock, former senior military assistant to Secretary Rumsfeld; Admiral Eric Olson, former deputy commander of U.S. Special Operations Command; Lieutenant General John Sattler, former director of operations at U.S. Central Command; Lieutenant General James Lovelace, former Director of the Army Staff; Lieutenant General (Retired) Philip Kensinger, former commander of U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC); and Brigadier General (Retired) Howard Yellen, former deputy commander at USASOC. In addition, the Committee interviewed seven other officers and civilian officials from Secretary Rumsfeld's office, the office of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and USASOC. II. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS RELATED TO CORPORAL TILLMAN A. THE MILITARY SERVICE OF CORPORAL PATRICK TILLMAN Patrick Tillman, a defensive back for the Arizona Cardinals, and his brother Kevin Tillman, a former professional baseball player, enlisted in the United States Army in May 2002. Although the Tillman brothers refused to talk publicly about why they were joining the Army, their enlistment was widely reported in the media. Their father, Patrick Tillman, Sr., explained to one newspaper that his sons did not want recognition ``separate from their peers'' because they felt all the soldiers with whom they served deserved equal recognition.\\35\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\35\\ Ex-Player Tillman Likely in Danger Zone as an Army Ranger, Washington Times (Mar. 21, 2003). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Both Pat and Kevin Tillman trained as elite Army Rangers and were assigned to the A Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, based in Fort Lewis, Washington. Their battalion did a tour of duty in Iraq in 2003 and began a tour in Afghanistan in 2004. At the beginning of this tour, both Pat and Kevin Tillman held the rank of Specialist (E4). On April 22, 2004, during operations in a rugged region of eastern Afghanistan, the Tillmans' platoon was divided into two parts (``serials''). Specialist Pat Tillman was a part of Serial 1, which proceeded towards the village of Manah, Afghanistan, through a narrow canyon. Specialist Kevin Tillman was a part of Serial 2, which was supposed to take a different route, but ultimately changed plans and followed Serial 1 along the same canyon road.\\36\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\36\\ Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Review of Matters Related to the Death of Corporal Patrick Tillman, U.S. Army (Mar. 26, 2007) (IPO2007E001). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- During its passage through the canyon, Serial 2 came under attack. When the Rangers in Serial 1 heard the sounds of the ambush, they dismounted from their vehicles and took positions to assist Serial 2. As Serial 2 emerged from the canyon, several Rangers riding in the lead vehicle opened fire on a nearby ridge, killing Specialist Pat Tillman and an Afghan soldier who had been conducting operations with the platoon, and injuring two other Rangers, including the platoon leader. The Army posthumously awarded Tillman the Silver Star and promoted him to the rank of Corporal.\\37\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\37\\ Id. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- As he testified at the Committee's hearing on April 24, 2007, Specialist Kevin Tillman did not witness the firefight that took his brother's life. He also testified that he was quickly flown back to Bagram Air Base and later accompanied his brother's remains back to the United States.\\38\\ He told the Committee that during these events, he was under the impression that his brother had been killed by the enemy.\\39\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\38\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Testimony of Kevin Tillman, Hearing on Misleading Information from the Battlefield, 110th Cong., at 18 (Apr. 24, 2007) (Serial No. 110-54). \\39\\ Id. at 30. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- B. INITIAL PENTAGON REACTIONS On the morning of April 23, 2004, news of Corporal Tillman's death broke in the United States. Initial reports from a Defense Department spokesman in Afghanistan indicated that a U.S. soldier, identified later that day as Corporal Tillman, had ``died after a firefight with anti-coalition militia forces about 25 miles southwest of a U.S. base at Khost, which has been the scene of frequent attacks.'' \\40\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\40\\ Former NFL Player Killed in Afghanistan, Associated Press (Apr. 23, 2004); U.S. Military Says NFL Player Killed in Afghanistan Exemplified All Soldiers' Patriotism, Associated Press (Apr. 24, 2004). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- On April 23, 2004, and in the following days, thousands of stories, commentaries, and tributes to Corporal Tillman appeared in newspapers, television, and the Internet. An internal ``Weekend Media Assessment'' produced by the Army Chief of Staff's Office of Public Affairs on Monday April 25, 2004, reported that the story of Corporal Tillman's death had helped generate the most media interest in the U.S. Army ``since the end of active combat last year.'' \\41\\ The report also noted that ``The Ranger Tillman story had been extremely positive in all media.'' \\42\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\41\\ E-mail from David Compton, Office of the Army Chief Public Affairs, to numerous addressees (Apr. 25, 2004). \\42\\ Id. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- E-mails reviewed by the Committee also show that the news of Corporal Tillman's death was discussed by public affairs officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Army on April 23, 2004, potentially including a ``front office'' morning meeting led by Secretary Rumsfeld's public affairs chief, Mr. Larry Di Rita.\\43\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\43\\ E-mail from Lieutenant Commander Jane Campbell, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, to Major Kristen Carle, Office of the Army Chief for Public Affairs (Apr. 23, 2004). (Reporting that Corporal Tillman's death ``was a topic of the discussion at the front office this morning and CJCS PA [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Public Affairs] is also involved.''). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Although Mr. Di Rita told Committee staff he could not recall any particular discussions he had about Corporal Tillman's death on April 23, 2004, documents produced by the Department of Defense show that Mr. Di Rita sent two e-mails that day related to Corporal Tillman. In the first of these e- mails, Mr. Di Rita responded to a request from the White House Media Affairs Director, who was seeking information about Corporal Tillman for a Sports Illustrated reporter.\\44\\ Mr. Di Rita responded that he would ``see what we can do. details are sketchy just now.'' \\45\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\44\\ E-mail from Lawrence Di Rita, Office of the Secretary of Defense, to Jeanie Mamo, Director of White House Media Affairs (Apr. 23, 2004). \\45\\ Id. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- In the second e-mail, Mr. Di Rita responded to a Department of Defense aide who had drafted a statement for the Department of Defense to use to respond to press inquiries.\\46\\ Mr. Di Rita edited the proposed statement and sent it back to the aide. His revised version stated, ``[o]ur thoughts and prayers go out to the family of Army Sgt Pat Tillman,'' and noted, ``[w]e mourn the death of every servicemember who makes the ultimate sacrifice in the Global War on Terror.'' \\47\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\46\\ E-mail from Lawrence Di Rita, Office of the Secretary of Defense, to Bryan Whitman, Office of the Secretary of Defense (Apr. 23, 2004). \\47\\ Id. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The same day, April 23, a memo was prepared by the Army Human Resources Command for the Army Deputy Chief of Staff G-1, Lieutenant General Franklin Hagenbeck. This executive summary (``EXSUM'') document explained that Corporal Tillman's casualty ``was a high-profile death because SPC Tillman was a member of the Arizona Cardinals and SPC Kevin Tillman was a former minor league baseball prospect in the Cleveland Indians organization when they enlisted together for three years.'' \\48\\ The summary said that in accordance with the Army's policy of holding casualty information for 24 hours after the soldier's family has been notified, the Army would not officially announce Corporal Tillman's death until 11 p.m. that night. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\48\\ Shari Lawrence, Army Human Resources Command, ``EXSUM'' Document (Apr. 23, 2004). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- C. EARLY REPORTS OF FRIENDLY FIRE As the Tillman family and the American public absorbed the news that Corporal Tillman had been killed in Afghanistan, apparently by enemy forces, suspicions that he had actually been killed by friendly fire quickly traveled through the Department of Defense. But while military officials at the highest levels knew within a matter of days that Corporal Tillman's death was a likely fratricide, they did not share this information with the Tillman family or the public for another month. Members of Corporal Tillman's platoon knew almost immediately he had been killed by his fellow Rangers.\\49\\ Moreover, within 24 hours, the top officers in Corporal Tillman's battalion and regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Bailey and Colonel Craig Nixon, also knew about the suspicions of friendly fire and had authorized the first Army Regulation 15-6 investigation into the circumstances of his death.\\50\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\49\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Testimony of U.S. Army Specialist Bryan O'Neal, Hearing on Misleading Information from the Battlefield, 110th Cong., at 94 (Apr. 24, 2007) (Serial No. 110-54); Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Review of Matters Related to the Death of Corporal Patrick Tillman, U.S. Army, at 13 (Mar. 26, 2007) (IPO2007E001). \\50\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Testimony of Thomas Gimble, Acting Defense Department Inspector General, Hearing on Misleading Information from the Battlefield, 110th Cong. (Apr. 24, 2007) (Serial No. 110-54). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Within several days, Colonel Nixon, the commander of the 75th Ranger Regiment, transmitted the information that Corporal Tillman may have been killed as a result of fratricide to Major General Stanley McChrystal, the commander of the joint task force in Afghanistan under which Corporal Tillman's battalion was operating.\\51\\ General McChrystal subsequently called General Bryan Brown, the top officer at the U.S. Special Operations Command, the combatant command under which Corporal Tillman's battalion operated in Afghanistan.\\52\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\51\\ Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Interview of Lieutenant General Stanley McChrystal, at 3 (Nov. 26, 2006). \\52\\ Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Interview of General Bryan Brown, at 5 (Nov. 17, 2006). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Colonel Nixon also informed Brigadier General Howard Yellen, the deputy commander of the Army Special Operations Command, the Army administrative command responsible for the 75th Ranger Regiment. According to General Yellen, on April 24 or April 25, 2004, he informed his commander, Lieutenant General Philip Kensinger, of the potential fratricide.\\53\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\53\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Brigadier General Howard Yellen (Retired), at 39 (July 25, 2007). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A few days later, on April 29, 2004, General McChrystal sent a message to the top generals in Corporal Tillman's chain of command alerting them that the first 15-6 investigation was nearing completion and would find that ``it is highly possible that Corporal Tillman was killed by friendly fire.'' \\54\\ According to General McChrystal, Colonel Nixon assisted him in preparing the message.\\55\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\54\\ ``Personal For'' message from Major General Stanley McChrystal to General John Abizaid, General Bryan Brown, Lieutenant General Philip Kensinger (Apr. 29, 2004). \\55\\ Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Interview of Lieutenant General Stanley McChrystal (Nov. 26, 2006). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The principal addressee of this communication was General John Abizaid, commander of CENTCOM, the geographic combatant command that includes Iraq and Afghanistan. The message was also sent to two recipients for ``information'' purposes. These recipients were General Brown, the SOCOM commander, and General Kensinger, the commander of USASOC.\\56\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\56\\ ``Personal For'' message from Major General Stanley McChrystal to General John Abizaid, General Bryan Brown, Lieutenant General Philip Kensinger (Apr. 29, 2004). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General McChrystal sent this communication as a ``personal for'' or P4 message, a format flag rank officers reserve for sensitive, ``for-your-eyes-only'' information. Such a communication, according to General Abizaid, is ``designed to pass information that's considered very, very important.'' \\57\\ According to General Myers, information in a P4 is ``supposed to be pretty close hold.'' \\58\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\57\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Testimony of General John Abizaid, Hearing on the Tillman Fratricide: What the Leadership of the Defense Department Knew, 110th Cong., at 190 (Aug. 1, 2007) (Serial No. 110-49). \\58\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Testimony of General Richard Myers, Hearing on the Tillman Fratricide: What the Leadership of the Defense Department Knew, 110th Cong., at 190 (Aug. 1, 2007) (Serial No. 110-49). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General McChrystal's P4 message stated: Sir, in the aftermath of Corporal Patrick Tillman's untimely yet heroic death in Afghanistan on 22 April 04, it is anticipated that a 15-6 investigation nearing completion will find that it is highly possible that Corporal Tillman was killed by friendly fire. This potential is exacerbated by the unconfirmed but suspected reports that POTUS [President of the United States] and the Secretary of the Army might include comments about Corporal Tillman's heroism and his approved Silver Star medal in speeeches [sic] currently being prepared, not knowing the specifics surrounding his death. . . . I felt that it was essential that you received this information as soon as we detected it in order to preclude any unknowing statements by our country's leaders which might cause public embarrassment if the circumstances of Corporal Tillman's death become public.\\59\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\59\\ ``Personal For'' message from Major General Stanley McChrystal to General John Abizaid, General Bryan Brown, Lieutenant General Philip Kensinger (Apr. 29, 2004). The day before General McChrystal sent this P4 message, speechwriting staff from both the Department of Defense and the White House had contacted a public affairs official at USASOC, Carol Darby, seeking information about Corporal Tillman's enlistment, rank, previous duty assignments, and reason for enlisting.\\60\\ White House staffer John Currin informed the USASOC official he was seeking this information for a speech President Bush would deliver at the May 1, 2004, White House Correspondents' Dinner.\\61\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\60\\ E-mail from Carol Darby, Media and Community Relations Division Chief, U.S. Army Special Operations Command, to Lieutenant Colonel Hans Bush, Chief of Public Affairs, U.S. Army Special Operations Command (Apr. 28, 2004). \\61\\ Id. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Admiral Eric T. Olson, the deputy commander of SOCOM in April 2004, told the Committee that the point at which General McChrystal sent the P4 would have been the appropriate time to tell the Tillman family about the possibility of fratricide. According to Admiral Olson, ``as soon as there is solid indication of the cause of death, that should be communicated to the family.'' \\62\\ Admiral Olson said he did not see the P4 when it was sent in April 2004, but he told the Committee that the information in the P4 was sufficiently certain to share with the family before the memorial service. His ``after-the- fact'' reflection was: ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\62\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Admiral Eric T. Olson, at 60 (July 27, 2007). But now having seen the contents of that P4, during which General McChrystal said it's highly probably there was fratricide, and that P4 was released before the memorial service, it would have been reasonable to expect that the family was informed of the possibility of fratricide.\\63\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\63\\ Id. at 61. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- D. THE SILVER STAR AWARD AND CORPORAL TILLMAN'S MEMORIAL SERVICE On April 29, 2004, the same day General McChrystal sent his P4 message, the Army posthumously awarded Corporal Tillman the Silver Star, an honor reserved for Army soldiers who have demonstrated ``gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States.'' \\64\\ Prior to the award's approval by the acting Army Secretary on April 29, 2004, several officers in Corporal Tillman's regiment who were aware of the possibility of friendly fire, including the regimental commander, Colonel Nixon, reviewed and edited the Silver Star award.\\65\\ Yet the final Silver Star citation asserted that Corporal Tillman ``put himself in the line of devastating enemy fire.'' \\66\\ Both of the eyewitness statements submitted with the Silver Star paperwork were altered by somebody within the 75th Regiment's chain of command.\\67\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\64\\ Army Regulation 600-8-22 Sec. 3-10(b) (2006). \\65\\ Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Review of Matters Related to the Death of Corporal Patrick Tillman, U.S. Army, at 53 (Mar. 2007) (IPO2007E001). \\66\\ Silver Star Award Citation for Corporal Patrick D.

The release stated that Corporal Tillman was being awarded the Silver Star ``for his selfless actions after his Ranger element was ambushed by anti-coalition insurgents during a ground assault convoy through southeastern Afghanistan.'' \\68\\ The release also referred to ``hostile fires directed at the Rangers'' and stated that Corporal Tillman ``was shot and killed while focusing his efforts on the elimination of the enemy forces and the protection of his team members.'' \\69\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\68\\ U.S. Army Special Operations Command, Army Awards Silver Star to Fallen Ranger (Apr. 30, 2004). \\69\\ Id. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- According to Brigadier General Howard Yellen, USASOC's deputy commander in April 2004, the release did not explicitly say how Corporal Tillman was killed, but ``for the civilian on the street, the interpretation would be that he was killed by enemy fire.'' \\70\\ When interviewed by the Committee, General Kensinger said he did not recall reviewing the release, but ``possibly could have.'' \\71\\ He agreed that ``a member of the public reading this probably would have concluded or assumed that Corporal Tillman had been killed by the enemy.'' \\72\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\70\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Brigadier General Howard Yellen, at 69 (July 25, 2007). \\71\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Lieutenant General Philip Kensinger, Jr. (Retired), at 54 (Feb. 29, 2008). \\72\\ Id. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Three days after this Army press release, on May 3, 2004, a memorial service was held for Corporal Tillman in San Jose, California. During the ceremony, Senior Chief Petty Officer Steven White, a personal friend of Corporal Tillman and a Navy SEAL, gave a eulogy in which he described the circumstances of Corporal Tillman's death using language that suggested he was killed by enemy forces.\\73\\ According to Senior Chief White, a member of the 75th Regiment had read him portions of the Silver Star citation that morning, and he based his speech on this information. Testifying before the Committee in April 2007, Senior Chief White said he felt ``let down'' by the military because he was given inaccurate information to present publicly. He told the Committee: ``I'm the guy that told America how he died, basically, at that memorial, and it was incorrect. That does not sit well with me.'' \\74\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\73\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Hearing on Misleading Information from the Battlefield, 110th Cong., at 110 (Apr. 24, 2007) (Serial No. 110-54). \\74\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Testimony of Senior Chief Petty Officer Stephen White, Hearing on Misleading Information from the Battlefield, 110th Cong., at 111 (Apr. 24, 2007) (Serial No. 110-54). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- E. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE FRATRICIDE The information that Corporal Tillman had likely been killed by friendly fire was not shared with the American public until the morning of May 29, 2004. On that day, the Saturday of the Memorial Day weekend, Lieutenant General Philip Kensinger appeared at a press availability at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the headquarters of the Army's Special Operations Command, and announced that an Army investigation had concluded that ``Corporal Tillman probably died as a result of friendly fire while his unit was engaged in combat with enemy forces.'' \\75\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\75\\ U.S. Army Special Operations Command, Press Statement: USASOC Announces Tillman Investigation Results (May 29, 2004) (online at news.soc.mil/advisories/Press-Media%20Releases/2004/040529-01.htm). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General Kensinger's statement was the only public statement issued by any Department of Defense or White House official acknowledging that Corporal Tillman had not been killed by the enemy, as the American public had believed for more than a month. When he was asked why the White House played no role in the public fratricide announcement, former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan told Committee staff, ``We would leave that to the proper department, and that would be DOD.'' \\76\\ White House Communications Director Dan Bartlett, asked why the White House issued a statement after Corporal Tillman died but not after the fratricide was announced, explained these events ``were fundamentally different things.'' \\77\\ According to Mr. Bartlett, media interest in a presidential statement about the fratricide ``was not there.'' \\78\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\76\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Scott McClellan (Sept. 10, 2007). \\77\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Daniel Bartlett (Sept. 12, 2007). \\78\\ Id. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Evidence reviewed by the Committee suggests that one reason the Department of Defense publicly released this information on May 29, 2004, was because the Tillman family had already begun learning about the friendly fire and because the media was about to report it.\\79\\ In the days before this announcement, the Department of Defense scrambled to release the information in a way that would cause the least amount of public relations damage to the Department. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\79\\ See, e.g., E-mail from Colonel George Rhynedance, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, to Bryan Whitman, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs (May 29, 2004) (``No one will ever tell you, but nice job on this one. May have minimized . . . damage by pushing the panic button early.''). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The second Army 15-6 investigation into Corporal Tillman's death was substantially completed by May 16, 2004.\\80\\ The conclusion of this investigation, authored by Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Kauzlarich, was that ``Corporal Tillman's death was the result of fratricide during an extremely chaotic enemy ambush.'' \\81\\ Over the next two weeks, the report moved upward through the regiment's chain of command. On Friday, May 28, 2004, CENTCOM's director of operations, Lieutenant General John F. Sattler, signed off on the report on behalf of General Abizaid, the CENTCOM commander.\\82\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\80\\ Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Review of Matters Related to the Death of Corporal Patrick Tillman, U.S. Army, at 29 (Mar. 2007) (IPO2007E001). \\81\\ U.S. Central Command, Report of Fratricide Investigation, at 11 (May 28, 2004). \\82\\ Id.; House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of General John F. Sattler, at 50 (July 24, 2007). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General Sattler told the Committee that during this period, General Abizaid called him at CENTCOM headquarters in Qatar and asked him to review Colonel Kauzlarich's investigation. General Sattler recalled that General Abizaid told him reviewing the report was a top priority, ``so whatever I thought was my number one priority no longer was.'' \\83\\ General Sattler concurred with its findings.\\84\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\83\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of General John F. Sattler, at 46 (July 24, 2007). \\84\\ Id. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Although officials told the Committee that the military was waiting for the investigation to be signed before notifying the family, the record shows that two Tillman family members were actually informed of the friendly fire before May 28, 2004. Earlier in the week, the 2nd Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment had returned to its headquarters in Fort Lewis, Washington, where Specialist Kevin Tillman encountered the members of his platoon for the first time since his brother's death. Fearing that Kevin Tillman would hear about the friendly fire from his fellow soldiers, the 2nd Battalion's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Bailey, was authorized to disclose the information to Kevin Tillman and Corporal Tillman's wife, Marie Tillman.\\85\\ According to Colonel Nixon, the commander of the 75th Ranger regiment, Colonel Bailey asked for this authorization after he determined that ``Kevin was getting some sense of what was going on.'' \\86\\ The Department of Defense Inspector General concluded that Kevin and Marie Tillman were informed of the friendly fire on May 26 and May 27, 2004, respectively.\\87\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\85\\ Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Interview of Colonel James Craig Nixon, at 121 (Oct. 28, 2006). \\86\\ Id. \\87\\ Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Review of Matters Related to the Death of Corporal Patrick Tillman, U.S. Army, at 44 (Mar. 2007) (IPO2007E001). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- At the same time General Sattler was reviewing the report, other high-level Pentagon officials began preparing for public release of the finding of fratricide. On May 28, Larry Di Rita, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, and General Brown, the SOCOM commander, coordinated a video teleconference to plan the public announcement of the fratricide.\\88\\ According to various interviews conducted by the Committee, the video teleconference included Mr. Di Rita, General Brown, Admiral Olson, General Kensinger, CENTCOM chief of staff Major General Steve Whitcomb, various public affairs officials, and at least one lawyer.\\89\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\88\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Colonel Hans Bush (Sept. 19, 2007). \\89\\ Id.; House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Admiral Eric T. Olson (July 27, 2007). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mr. Di Rita told Committee staff that he recognized at the time that this was a ``very important public event'' \\90\\ He recalled that that he was ``brought in to it, on the basis of my professional responsibilities, which was to help with the public affairs posture on this incident.'' \\91\\ While military public affairs officers were planning to release the fratricide information in a ``passive'' posture, in which the Department would only respond to press queries, Mr. Di Rita decided to adopt an ``active approach'' and hold a press conference to release the information. Describing the teleconference, Mr. Di Rita explained: ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\90\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Lawrence Di Rita, at 69 (Sept. 24, 2007). \\91\\ Id. at 63. I spent time working with the responsible offices . . . deciding that it was something that probably required some public interaction, as distinct from an announcement. I seem to recall that we discussed the importance of this, the fact that it was fairly large news, that what everybody believed to be true was no longer the case, no longer true, and that it required more of a public presentation than a simple announcement, particularly inasmuch as this thing had been concluded late in the week, or at least they were prepared to announce it late in a week, and I thought it was important.\\92\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\92\\ Id. According to Admiral Olson and General Brown, during the teleconference, General Brown suggested that Mr. Di Rita make the announcement since it was such a high-profile matter.\\93\\ Mr. Di Rita apparently decided that his ``responsibilities'' for managing the announcement did not extend to actually making the announcement. He told the Committee, ``a public affairs officer, to me, was not the answer.'' \\94\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\93\\ General Bryan Brown, Response to Questions from BG Jones (Dec. 9, 2004) (``[W]e initially told Mr. DiRita that OSD PA should make the announcement. They determined it should be a uniformed member of the chain of command. The logical choice was LTG Kensinger. I agreed.''). \\94\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Lawrence Di Rita, at 67 (Sept. 24, 2007). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Admiral Olson described the following discussion: As I recall, General Brown suggested that the Public Affairs Office for the Secretary of Defense be the one to make the announcement as a defense matter. Larry Di Rita thought it was more appropriate for a uniformed officer to make the announcement. Then the question was who is the appropriate uniformed officer. It is not a SOCOM responsibility, it was an Army responsibility. Because General Kensinger had an Army chain of command outside of SOCOM, the discussion just sort of circled in on General Kensinger as the appropriate officer.\\95\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\95\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Admiral Eric T. Olson, at 40 (July 27, 2007). Another teleconference participant also recalled that Mr. Di Rita recommended that General Kensinger make the public announcement. Colonel Hans Bush, who was the head of USASOC's public affairs office at the time, recalled, ``General Brown acknowledged the recommendation and then said, General Kensinger, you meet the criteria.

THE WHITE HOUSE RESPONSE Testimony and e-mails obtained by the Committee show that White House officials were intensely interested in the news of Pat Tillman's death. On April 23, the White House rushed out a press statement acknowledging Corporal Tillman's death twelve hours before the Department of Defense publicly confirmed the casualty. This early statement was issued notwithstanding a military rule intended to protect military families from media attention during the first 24 hours after learning about a casualty. A week later, on May 1, 2004, President Bush gave a speech discussing Corporal Tillman's military service. Yet when the Committee inquired into how and when White House officials learned Corporal's death was a fratricide, the White House provided no responsive e-mails, and each of the former officials interviewed by Committee staff professed to have no recollection. A. NEWS BREAKS AT WHITE HOUSE There was intense interest in the news of Corporal Tillman's death at the White House as the story broke in the press on the morning of April 23, 2004. Documents and interviews with White House officials show that as White House staff members learned the news from cable television and other media sources, they quickly shared and discussed it with their colleagues and friends. According to former White House Communications Director Dan Bartlett, he discussed Corporal Tillman's death directly with President Bush. Mr. Bartlett told Committee staff that he ``had conversations with the President about this news event.'' \\107\\ Although Mr. Bartlett claimed he could not recall what was said, he told Committee staff that he ``likely'' discussed with the President the ``appropriate response'' for the White House to take.\\108\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\107\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Daniel Bartlett (Sept. 12, 2007). \\108\\ Id. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Barry Jackson, a deputy to President Bush's political adviser Karl Rove, sent Mr. Rove language for a potential presidential tribute to Pat Tillman.\\109\\ Speechwriter Matthew Scully wrote an e-mail to fellow speechwriter Michael Gerson highlighting Corporal Tillman's death as a ``big story.'' \\110\\ Condoleezza Rice, then National Security Advisor, was informed of Corporal Tillman's death by her executive assistant, Army Major Jennie Koch Easterly.\\111\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\109\\ E-mail from Barry Jackson, Deputy to the President's Senior Advisor, to Karl Rove, Senior Advisor to the President (Apr. 23, 2004). \\110\\ E-mail from Matthew Scully, Deputy Director of Presidential Speechwriting, to Michael Gerson, Assistant to the President for Speechwriting (Apr. 23, 2004). \\111\\ E-mail from Jennie M. Koch, Executive Assistant to the National Security Advisor, to Gregory Schulte, Executive Secretary, National Security Council (Apr. 23, 2004). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Several high-level staff members of President Bush's reelection campaign contacted White House officials to suggest public responses to Corporal Tillman's death. Matthew Dowd, the campaign's chief strategist, sent an e-mail to Mr. Bartlett, writing, ``You hear about pat tilman? Potus should call his family or go to Arizona or his hometown.'' \\112\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\112\\ E-mail from Matthew Dowd, Chief Strategist, 2004 George W. Bush presidential campaign, to Daniel Bartlett, Assistant to the President for Communications (Apr. 23, 2004). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mark McKinnon, the campaign's media advisor, also e-mailed Mr. Bartlett, saying: ``Realize President really shouldn't do anything that he hasn't done for any other soldier killed in the military, but certainly think he could say something about he exemplifies the ultimate in humility, heroism and sacrifice.'' \\113\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\113\\ E-mail from Mark McKinnon, Chief Media Advisor, 2004 George W. Bush presidential campaign to Daniel Bartlett, Assistant to the President for Communications (Apr. 23, 2004). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Commentators and reporters contacted the White House to offer advice. For example, Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan e-mailed the White House's Director of Strategic Initiatives, Peter Wehner, recommending that he ``find out what faith Tillman practiced and have the president go by that church and light a candle or say a prayer.'' \\114\\ Karl Rove exchanged e-mails about Pat Tillman with Associated Press reporter Ron Fournier, under the subject line ``H-E-R-O.'' In response to Mr. Fournier's e-mail, Mr. Rove asked, ``How does our country continue to produce men and women like this,'' to which Mr. Fournier replied, ``The Lord creates men and women like this all over the world. But only the great and free countries allow them to flourish. Keep up the fight.'' \\115\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\114\\ E-mail from Peggy Noonan to Peter Wehner, White House Director of Strategic Initiatives (Apr. 23, 2004). \\115\\ E-mail from Ron Fournier to Karl Rove, Senior Advisor to the President (Apr. 23, 2004). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- In total, the White House staff sent or received nearly 200 e-mails relating to Corporal Tillman's death on April 23, 2004. B. STATEMENT ISSUED PREMATURELY At approximately noon on April 23, 2004, the White House issued a statement of condolence from the President. Before releasing this statement, White House officials failed to confirm with the Defense Department that Corporal Tillman had actually died. They also failed to determine whether information about the casualty, which occurred during a special operations mission, was classified. Moreover, the White House rushed to release its statement notwithstanding a military requirement intended to protect military families from media attention during the first 24 hours after a casualty. Taylor Gross, the White House spokesman responsible for media outlets in the South and Southwestern United States, told Committee staff that he drafted a White House statement on the morning of April 23 after receiving several calls from Arizona media outlets.\\116\\ He sent the draft to Communications Director Dan Bartlett and Press Secretary Scott McClellan for approval at 11:40 a.m. The statement read: ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\116\\ Although various e-mails reviewed by the Committee referred to this as a ``statement'' or a ``comment,'' Mr. Gross explained that he had technically written a ``response to an inquiry,'' rather than a ``presidential statement'' because it was released only in reply to particular queries. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Taylor Gross, at 61 (Sept. 5, 2007). Other White House officials also told the Committee that they saw a distinction between Mr. Gross's ``response to questions'' and a more formal, proactive ``presidential statement.'' White House officials were unhappy with news coverage of Mr. Gross's April 23 comment, possibly because the press referred to it is as a ``statement'' from the White House. See E- mail from Scott McClellan, White House Press Secretary, to Suzy DeFrancis, Deputy Assistant to the President for Communications (Apr. 23, 2004). Pat Tillman was an inspiration on the football field and in his private life. As with all who made the ultimate sacrifice in the war on terror, his family are in the thoughts and prayers of President and Mrs. Bush.\\117\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\117\\ E-mail from Taylor Gross, White House spokesman, to Daniel Bartlett, Assistant to the President for Communications (Apr. 23, 2004). Minutes later, both Mr. Bartlett and Mr. McClellan approved the message on behalf of the President. Mr. Bartlett noted that the statement might ``set a precedent,'' but wrote ``I'm fine with it.'' \\118\\ He later clarified: ``good to go.'' \\119\\ Speaking to Committee staff, Mr. Bartlett explained that he made this decision due to the high level of media interest in the story. According to Mr. Bartlett, the story of Pat Tillman ``made the American people feel good about our country . . . and our military.'' \\120\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\118\\ E-mail from Daniel Bartlett, Assistant to the President for Communications, to Scott McClellan, White House Press Secretary (Apr. 23, 2004). \\119\\ E-mail from Daniel Bartlett, Assistant to the President for Communications, to Taylor Gross, White House spokesman (Apr. 23, 2004). \\120\\ Id. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mr. Bartlett's response to Matthew Dowd's April 23, 2004, e-mail, which suggested that the President visit Corporal Tillman's family, offers additional insight into the White House's approach to the reports. He wrote: I agree he is a hero. But there will be a lot of pressure not to single out one guy just because he was a football player. We are providing a statement to AZ press, but we will need to discuss anything further.\\121\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\121\\ E-mail from Daniel Bartlett, Assistant to the President for Communications, to Matthew Dowd, Chief Strategist, 2004 George W. Bush presidential campaign (Apr. 23, 2004). When Committee staff asked Mr. Bartlett whether there were further discussions within the White House about responding to Corporal Tillman's death, Mr. Bartlett said he thought it was likely there were discussions, but he did not have any specific recollection of them.\\122\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\122\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Daniel Bartlett (Sept. 12, 2007). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Although Mr. Gross's statement was approved by President Bush's top communications advisors, it appears that no one in the White House confirmed with the military whether Corporal Tillman had actually died. The White House also did not confirm with the military that it could talk publicly about Corporal Tillman, whose regiment regularly participated in sensitive missions. According to Mr. Gross, ``by and large things are confirmed by the White House before they're stated,'' whether in ``a reactive statement or a proactive statement.'' \\123\\ But Mr. Gross told Committee staff that he drafted this statement quickly (``about a two-hour turnaround time''), without consulting the Defense Department.\\124\\ Mr. Gross stated: ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\123\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Taylor Gross, at 67 (Sept. 5, 2007). \\124\\ Id. at 42. I personally did not verify with DOD, but I got my statement approved via my normal chain of commend. . . . You know, again, frankly, confirming--confirming that was--you know, that's above my pay grade. That was for a superior.\\125\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\125\\ Id. at 52. Mr. Gross's superiors did not verify the statement either. Mr. McClellan told Committee staff that ``the way it usually was done was, you know, you confirm he was killed.'' \\126\\ But Mr. McClellan asserted that confirmation of these facts was not his job, and that he did not attempt to verify the statement before approving it for release. He also did not check whether information relating to Corporal Tillman's death was classified, explaining, ``It was obvious. It was in the news.'' \\127\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\126\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Scott McClellan (Sept. 10, 2007). \\127\\ Id. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Likewise, Mr. Bartlett said, ``I did not take any formal steps'' to confirm the information.\\128\\ Nevertheless, he ``personally was under the impression that this was true'' based on the ``totality of information coming from the media.'' \\129\\ Mr. Bartlett also denied that confirming the accuracy of a presidential statement was his job. He explained: ``Generally my conversations with DOD were at a much higher level.'' \\130\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\128\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Daniel Bartlett (Sept. 12, 2007). \\129\\ Id. \\130\\ Id. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- If White House officials had checked with the Department of Defense, they would have learned that the Department had not yet publicly announced Corporal Tillman's death. In accordance with a policy intended to give the families of war casualties a 24-hour private grieving period, the Defense Department did not announce the casualty until late that evening.\\131\\ This 24- hour policy was mandated by an act of Congress, the Military Family Peace of Mind Act, which President Bush signed into law in November 2003 as part of the Fiscal Year 2004 National Defense Authorization Act.\\132\\ The act sought to ``provide service members' next-of-kin with a period of privacy before the public is made aware of service members' death.'' \\133\\ In the case of Corporal Tillman, the family was not notified until approximately 10:00 p.m. on April 22. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\131\\ Department of Defense, Instruction Number 1300.18 (2008). \\132\\ Pub. L. 108-136. \\133\\ U.S. House of Representatives, Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 1588 (Report 108-354), at 695 (Nov. 7, 2003). Representative Walter B. Jones, the original sponsor of the act, explained that some military families ``had little time to grieve'' because they were forced to ``fend off aggressive press inquiries'' in the hours after a loved one's death. A 24-hour delay on publicity, he said, ``would not unreasonably impair the public's access to information about military activities, but could provide an immeasurable amount of relief to those who have endured the loss.'' Statement of Representative Walter B. Jones, Congressional Record, E889 (May 7, 2003). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- An hour after the White House released its statement, deputy press secretary Claire Buchan learned that DOD was not yet confirming Corporal Tillman's death. She sent an e-mail to Scott McClellan and Trent Duffy, another deputy press secretary, with the subject line ``alert--do not use tillman statement.'' \\134\\ The e-mail stated, ``dod is not confirming that he is dead--next of kin still being notified. unfortunately taylor's statement is on the wire.'' \\135\\ Later in the afternoon, Ms. Buchan e-mailed National Security Council spokesman Sean McCormack and asked him to ``bug your friend at DOD'' about the Tillman casualty announcement. Mr. McCormack quickly wrote back that DOD was ``not confirming yet. this will soon become a problem.'' \\136\\ Later that night, Scott McClellan concurred, writing, ``Media affairs commented when asked for reaction from arizona press. They did not check to verify if it had been confirmed.'' \\137\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\134\\ E-mail from Claire Buchan, Deputy White House Press Secretary, to Trent Duffy, Deputy White House Press Secretary, and Scott McClellan, White House Press Secretary (Apr. 23, 2004). \\135\\ Id. \\136\\ E-mail from Claire Buchan, Deputy White House Press Secretary, to Sean McCormack, NSC Press Secretary (Apr. 23, 2004). Mr. McCormack told the Committee he had no recollection of the events described in this e-mail. \\137\\ E-mail from Scott McClellan, White House Press Secretary, to Suzy DeFrancis, Deputy Assistant to the President for Communications (Apr. 23, 2004). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Noam Neusner, a speechwriter for President Bush, criticized the hastily issued comment as it was reported in the press, noting that it inappropriately equated Corporal Tillman's football career with his military service. In an e-mail obtained by the Committee, he wrote: That statement, as quoted, was ridiculous. Pat Tillman wasn't a hero on the football field. He played football. But he died for his country. We shouldn't try to tie the two things together--he didn't.\\138\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\138\\ E-mail from Noam Neusner, Special Assistant to the President for Economic Speech Writing, to Erin Healy, Assistant White House Press Secretary (Apr. 23, 2004). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- C. DISCUSSION OF CORPORAL TILLMAN IN PRESIDENTIAL SPEECH On May 1, 2004, President Bush delivered a speech during the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner. The President devoted a significant portion of the speech to a discussion of Corporal Tillman. According to Dan Bartlett, ``We made a strategic decision to pay tribute to the troops'' during the 2004 speech because the White House ``got singed pretty bad'' for a previous speech in which the President's jokes were considered inappropriate during wartime.\\139\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\139\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Daniel Bartlett (Sept. 12, 2007). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Documents reviewed by the Committee show that White House officials had decided to include Corporal Tillman in the Correspondents' Dinner speech by April 27, 2004. On that day, White House Research Assistant Lee Bockhorn e-mailed White House speechwriter, Michael Gerson, a number of press clippings in response to Mr. Gerson's request for the ``'most moving'' stuff on Tillman, particularly anything he said.'' \\140\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\140\\ E-mail from Lee Bockhorn, White House Research Assistant, to Michael Gerson, Assistant to the President for Speechwriting (Apr. 27, 2004). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- In his speech, the President spoke about the sacrifices of military personnel, singling out Corporal Tillman's service. He said: The loss of Army Corporal Pat Tillman last week in Afghanistan brought home the sorrow that comes with every loss and reminds us of the character of the men and women who serve on our behalf. Friends say that this young man saw the images of September the 11th, and seeing that evil, he felt called to defend America. He set aside a career in athletics and many things the world counts important, wealth and security and the acclaim of the crowds. He chose, instead, the rigors of Ranger training and the fellowship of soldiers and the hard duty in Afghanistan and Iraq. Corporal Tillman asked for no special attention. He was modest because he knew there were many like him, making their own sacrifices. They fill the ranks of the Armed Forces. Every day, somewhere, they do brave and good things without notice. Their courage is usually seen only by their comrades, by those who long to be free, and by the enemy. They're willing to give up their lives, and when one is lost, a whole world of hopes and possibilities is lost with them.\\141\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\141\\ President George W. Bush, Remarks at White House Correspondents' Dinner (May 1, 2004). One sentence in this passage--``Friends say that this young man saw the images of September the 11th, and seeing that evil, he felt called to defend America''--was the subject of extensive discussions during the speechwriting process. Although the White House did not give Committee staff access to the earlier drafts of the President's speech, it appears from e-mails that in at least one of the earlier drafts, this sentence read, ``Pat Tillman saw the burning towers on television and felt called to fight the evil behind it.'' \\142\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\142\\ E-mail from John Currin, White House Director of Fact- Checking, to Michael Gerson, Matthew Scully, and John McConnell, White House Speechwriters (Apr. 28, 2004). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- White House e-mails reviewed by the Committee show that John Currin, the White House Director of Fact-Checking, quickly discovered that he could not find any substantiation for the statement that Corporal Tillman had enlisted after he ``saw the burning towers on television.'' When Mr. Currin asked White House speechwriter Matthew Scully about the source of this statement, Mr. Scully responded: ``Should be in news accounts.'' \\143\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\143\\ E-mail from Matthew Scully, deputy director of Presidential Speechwriting, to John Currin, White House Director of Fact-Checking (Apr. 28, 2004). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- In an effort to confirm this statement, Mr. Currin contacted Carol Darby, a public affairs officer at U.S. Army Special Operations Command, to ask whether she could confirm why Pat and Kevin Tillman had joined the Army. According to Ms. Darby, she told him: No, that I could not, that I had never talked to either of the brothers and I had never seen anything in print of any sort that stated why they joined the Army. But I had seen press reports where Pat's coach had spoke of something along those lines, but it really didn't give exactly why Pat joined the Army. And he asked if I could send him some of those press reports and I did have those.\\144\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\144\\ House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Interview of Carol Darby, at 39 (Sept. 18, 2007). After speaking with Ms. Darby and receiving her faxed articles discussing Corporal Tillman's enlistment, Mr. Currin urged the speechwriting team to change or remove text claiming that Corporal Tillman joined the Army as a result of the attacks of September 11. On April 28, 2004, he wrote to ----------------------------------------------------------------------- speechwriter Matthew Scully: My DoD contact, who checked with the Rangers, confirm that he never gave any media interview or discussed the reason why he left the NFL to join the Rangers. . . . [G]iven that he never spoke to the press about his reasons for joining the Rangers, we simply do not have support for the statement that he decided to join the Rangers after seeing the burning towers on television.\\145\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\145\\ E-mail from John Currin, White House Director of Fact- Checking, to Matthew Scully, deputy director of Presidential Speechwriting (Apr. 28, 2004). Two hours later, Mr. Currin e-mailed Michael Gerson, the ----------------------------------------------------------------------- chief White House speechwriter: There is no direct support for the statement that Pat Tillman saw the burning towers on television and felt called to fight the evil behind it. Tillman and his brother never discussed their reasons with the press, nor have their parents. Tillman kept his reasons to himself. The people at Fort Lewis, the base for Tillman's unit, could not confirm that September 11 was the reason why Tillman joined the Army. All that I and Carol Darby at USASOC (Ft. Lewis) could find is mention in a news article from March 2003 that says that ``friends say the brothers were deeply affected by the September 11 terrorist attacks and felt compelled to enlist.'' We do not know if these friends were speculating about Tillman's reasons or if they had direct knowledge of Tillman's reasons. The bottom line is that Tillman never stated publicly his reasons for joining the Rangers, and it is speculation that he did so because of September 11.\\146\\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\146\\ E-mail from John Currin, White House Director of Fact- Checking, to Michael Gerson, Matthew Scully, and John McConnell, White House Speechwriters (Apr. 28, 2004). Mr. Currin thought the issue was important enough that he sent a third message to the speechwriters on the following day, April 29. In this e-mail, he wrote that Ms. Darby of USASOC had offered to call the Tillman family on his behalf, but Mr. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Currin advised against it. He wrote: As I mentioned yesterday, Pat Tillman and his family never spoke about the reasons why he chose to leave the NFL and join the Army, and the statement in the remarks for the correspondence dinner attributing his motivation to seeing the burning towers on 9/11 is speculation. I spoke yesterday with Carol Darby at Ft. Lewis (the base"
