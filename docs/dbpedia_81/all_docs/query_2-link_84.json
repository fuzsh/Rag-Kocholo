        "text": "“No sir, we’re not going to do that,” she recalls telling the wide-eyed superior. “You’re jeopardizing my men, my crew.”\n\nShe remembered that incident when discussing one of the formative experiences of her political career: The freshman congresswoman bucked the White House to vote against funding Syrian rebels in the war against ISIL. At first, Duckworth (D-Ill.), the good soldier, wanted to go along with her superior, President Barack Obama. She told his people that she would vote “yes with reservations.” But then she realized that while the White House was promising to avoid long-term commitments, the Defense Department was vowing a three-year entanglement. As she sat down to write an op-ed that would explain her yes vote, she realized she couldn’t go through with it.\n\n“I think my willingness to take that stand does come out of my military background, that sometimes you’ve got to stand up to the boss and say, ‘Sir, I disagree. That’s the wrong thing to do,’” Duckworth said.\n\nDuckworth has also discovered that politics requires more than taking a firm stand — a lesson that suggests a military background isn’t always the best proving ground for political leadership. The well-known Iraq War veteran and Purple Heart recipient has encountered one frustration after another with a Congress that keeps fighting about the same things — and with a Department of Veterans Affairs bureaucracy that she claims has blocked her at every turn. She has had to learn new techniques, low key and indirect, if she wants to get anything done.\n\n“In the military, once the boss makes a decision, or once you’ve made a decision to execute, to do something, then you execute it,” Duckworth said. Now, “I feel like we fight the same battles over and over again, and I’ve only been there two years.”\n\nDuckworth’s experiences help explain why military veterans, who bring a unique set of values to politics — selflessness, a sense of mission — often experience a culture shock when they arrive in the Capitol. Washington, Jackson, Grant, Eisenhower — career military officers make up some of the most sculpted-in-marble political leaders, as well. But there haven’t been as many crossing the threshold into politics lately, as those identified as presidential timber have either demurred (Colin Powell) or failed to get far off the launching pad (Wesley Clark). More often, candidates with less prominent military backgrounds have used their service as a character reference, without claiming that the rigors of military life translate easily into politics.\n\nThe big reasons, political operatives note, are obvious: Today’s Congress is slow and inefficient, bureaucracies don’t move as quickly as battalions, decisions don’t get made with crisp salutes. But others might be more surprising, like the fact that military officers are trained not to talk about themselves — as opposed to the team — and hate asking donors for money.\n\n“We look at it as, veterans should be seen as one of those underutilized resources, if you will,” said Seth Lynn, executive director of Veterans Campaign, a nonpartisan group that trains military veterans to run for office. “They have the selflessness and leadership and discipline to succeed at this, but they’re underutilized because there’s no politics in the military.”\n\nFor many veterans, Lynn said, the nature of service is indelibly appealing, but that of politics is bitterly distasteful, particularly in an era of ever-escalating partisan attacks and a never-ending chase for money.\n\n“It’s almost as if the military psychologically prepares you not to do it,” Lynn said. “It’s so antithetical to the culture of the military, asking people to give money to you.”\n\nEven though the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have produced a new group of war veterans, members with military experience are still a shrinking share of Congress. At the beginning of the current Congress, 108 members of the House and Senate had military experience, according to the Congressional Research Service — just 20 percent of the total membership. That number will decline in the House when all of this year’s races are settled, while the Senate may add a veteran for the first time since 1982. Nonetheless, the overall numbers represent a stunning drop from the heyday of the World War II generation. As recently as the early 1980s, 64 percent of the members of Congress had worn the country’s uniform; in the early 1970s, as many as 73 percent had served. For many of those veterans, such as the legendary pairing of Republican Ted Stevens and Democrat Daniel Inouye on the Senate Appropriations Committee, service in World War II served to cement a bipartisan bond.\n\nToday’s dwindling numbers are still sufficient to keep Congress stocked with enough veterans to weigh in on key military decisions and oversee the Veterans’ Affairs committees. But the notion of military service as a force for unity and collective action is increasingly quaint.\n\nFor her part, Duckworth struck up an unlikely friendship with Darrell Issa, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman and chief tormentor of the Obama administration. She says she bonded with him over their military experience — he served in the Army in the 1970s — and then worked together on a bill to crack down on abuse of a program to give federal bidding preference to veterans with disabilities. (The bill, however, suffered the typical fate: dying in subcommittee).\n\n“One of the first things we talked about was him flying around in [Huey helicopters], with the crazy Huey pilots, and I told him, ‘Well, actually, Mr. Chairman, I started out flying Hueys.’ He said, ‘Well, that makes a lot of sense,’” Duckworth recalls.\n\nThat doesn’t mean military veterans never become partisans, of course — John McCain, John Kerry and Issa are all proof of that. But it does mean that they at least start with a common experience that may make them more open to working with the other side for a greater cause. “Is that leadership? Well, yeah, I think it is,” Lynn said. “It’s a willingness to work with the other side. It takes a lot of fortitude to do that.”\n\nSome veterans, like McCain and Kerry, have made the transition easily, and their war records became part of their political stories. And most voters know the story of Duckworth’s war injuries from her helicopter crash in Iraq in 2004. But other candidates have deliberately kept their military service out of their campaigns. Seth Moulton, a former Marine who just won a congressional seat in Massachusetts, received two awards for valor in Iraq — the Bronze Star Medal and the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal — and didn’t disclose them until The Boston Globe wrote about it.\n\nMoulton’s efforts to downplay the extent of his service suggests that being a veteran is an appealing credential to many voters — but not, in itself, a qualification for political office. Thus, Lynn notes, many candidates with military experience make the mistake of aiming too high on their first run for office, before they’re ready. “They may say, ‘Well, I’ve beaten the odds before. What were the odds I was going to get through SEAL training?’” Lynn said. But in military terms, he said, trying to win a congressional race with no previous political experience would be like “trying to succeed as the captain of a ship or a battalion commander right off the bat.”\n\nDuckworth didn’t succeed on her first try, either. She lost in 2006, then became the director of the Illinois Department of Veterans’ Affairs, then joined the Obama administration in 2009 as assistant secretary of Veterans Affairs. It was only after her many frustrations with the VA — where she saw firsthand the now-infamous bureaucratic delays and resistance to change — that she decided to run for Congress again. In 2012, she unseated Republican Rep. Joe Walsh and took over the 8th District seat.\n\nDuckworth says she was a better candidate the second time around, having had the governmental experience to add to her military background. But by that point, she had also experienced the frustration of trying to get anything done in the VA bureaucracy — like spending two years trying to get approval for a style guide for VA documents that specified the font and colors that would be used in the agency logo. Until then, she said, “every department was paying a marketing firm to design a new booklet or a pamphlet for every booklet and pamphlet that the VA produces.”\n\nShe also says she saw how then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki asked for metrics to determine how the agency would make progress in cutting down the wait times for veterans’ medical appointments. The Veterans Health Administration came up with the 14-day wait time as a goal, but Duckworth says the fact that it let the VA facilities report the wait time themselves — as opposed to using outside groups — was a recipe for deception.\n\n“It never occurred to him that there would be bad actors within VA who would lie. And he was outright lied to. But part of the problem was, we let them self-report” when hospital directors’ bonuses were tied to the goal, Duckworth said.\n\nThe main lesson she has learned in her first term in Congress, she says, is that sometimes the best way to get legislation passed is to go the indirect route.\n\nAs a freshman member of the minority party, Duckworth says she knows she never would have had a chance to pass bills on their own. But she says Buck McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee — the other committee she serves on — agreed to include some of her initiatives as part of the defense authorization bill last year so they wouldn’t require separate votes. That’s how she was able to succeed with amendments like recovering $900 million in funds from unused Stryker combat vehicle parts.\n\nThe lesson to other military veterans who might run for office, Duckworth says, is that the military experience gets them only so far — and they’ll still have to learn a large new set of skills to succeed.\n\n“The military experience is good, and it’s a starting point, but if you think that that’s going to make you an excellent legislator, then you have a lot to learn,” she said. “Because learning to be a legislator, learning to compromise, learning to listen to other people, learning to figure out ways to find alternate courses of action, alternate ways to get things done that may not be the most direct way, is also part of being a successful legislator.”"
