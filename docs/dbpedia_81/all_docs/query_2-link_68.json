        "text": "FOB would like to say Happy Birthday to the US Army! US Army Birthday History: The American revolutionary war started on April 1775. The fighters that enlisted to fight against the British forces were militia groups paid for and equipped by the colonies, but without any organization, command, or strategy. Different groups fought under different banners which showed a lack of unity on the part of the US against their common enemy. When a battle was approaching in Boston in June, it became clear that Congress should find a solution for the militia strategy, which wasn't working. After the Committee of the Whole reached an agreement, the American Continental Army was created, with George Washington as its commander. This allowed riflemen to enlist and serve in the army, and a committee was appointed to create the rules and regulations for the said army. The first branch of the American military to be founded on that day was the Infantry. Over the year, the U.S. Army has significantly expanded its forces. The first Army service training program for new recruits took place between 1777 and 1778. In 1787, with the signing of the United States Constitution, it became defined that the acting President of the United States also acts as the Commander-in-Chief of the army. With the United States Declaration of Independence only having been enacted on July 4, 1776, this means that the American army is older than the country it serves. #USArmy #militaryhistory #fob\n\nFor a student of tactics, battlefield visits highlight to an observer the factors that separate successful and disastrous outcomes. A visit to the former battlefield at Long Tan is very worthwhile. It brings the difficulties of fighting a sub-unit battle into focus, considering the disadvantageous ground and disrupted command, control and communications. Without the plantation trees, there is almost no cover, very little appreciable dead ground. Without the interdiction and protective fire provided by the supporting artillery during the battle, the outcome would likely have been very different. From a logistics perspective, ammunition availability was a significant limitation and without the very risky re-supply operations undertaken by helicopter, D Coy would have exhausted their stocks. The expenditure of artillery ammunition far exceeded planned rates, even at the higher end. Factors such as the weather and time of day also played their part in influencing the outcome. The effect becomes easier to visualise when you see the ground. I think it's important to thank the government of Vietnam for permitting the Long Tan memorial's continued presence and allowing Australians to visit and remember their dead. Its important to remember that there were many Vietnamese killed during the battle and that their families grieve too. Read the history. Visit the memorial at the battlefield if you can. https://lnkd.in/gQ4kFvgP\n\nRussian President Mr. Putin sadly had to decide and start the special military operation engaging in an effort to protect the Russian people living in Ukraine, the security of his country and citizens due to many extremist powers within and around the Ukrainian government. All attempts from the Russian side had failed to produce results through the Minsk agreements which were not honored and many attempts through diplomacy. Our intelligence service and government failed to understand that Russia as a whole love and respect their country as we do here in the US. Additionally we underestimated their potential continuing aggressively to weaken Russia using Ukraine and their government. Meanwhile rallying our allies in order to have support. We froze Russian assets billions, we adopted Ukraine and paid for all their needs, from state of the art military supplies, training, intelligence services, to catering for all the warriors and destroying their gas pipelines to Europe. Still not enough why? What happened? Why is Russia still up and running? McDonald's closed in Russia and their still making hamburgers and fries? What's going on? Can this be an act of God since this is happening in his kingdom?\n\nHistory in 60 Seconds: What do you know about Roman Legions? The Roman legion was the backbone of the powerful Roman army for centuries. Here's a breakdown of some key points: 1) Elite Infantry: For most of the Roman Empire's history, legions were the elite heavy infantry of the Roman army. 2) Citizen Soldiers: Early legions were composed entirely of Roman citizens. After reforms by Marius in 107 BC, citizenship wasn't a requirement, but it remained a prestigious role. 3) Size and Organization: The size of legions varied over time, but typically consisted of around 5,200 men during the height of the Empire. They were structured into smaller units called cohorts, centuries, and contubernia. For comparison, a US Army brigade consists of a few battalions and anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers. A colonel is generally in command. Video: Historic Vids\n\n\"A regiment is more than a mere organization; it is in truth a family, with its ancestors and descendants, its pride and its possessions, and through all its vicissitudes a strong sense of community and continuity.\"-Lord Wavell Two interesting pieces in my feed this morning that are related- one, from the Ottawa Citizen, arguing that Canadian Army ceremonies, such as the sentry programme at the National War Memorial and the Changing of the Guard on Parliament Hill, serve as a very effective recruitment tool for the profession of arms in this country, and ought to be strongly supported. The other, from the Harvard Business Review, discussing the utility of workplace rituals in building and maintaining strong functional organizational teams. Nobody understands the value of tradition and ritual better than an infantry rifleman. From taking the Loyal Oath upon attestation, to various Mess exercise both solemn and hilarious, to Regimental parades, to the variations in titles and ranks and drill.....these are the things that inspire the soldiers of the Loamshire Fusiliers to be demonstrably superior to the lesser beings of the Natulanteland Rifles. With the resulting positive effects on the battlefield. In a pre-election rush to spend billions on Canada's armed forces, those at the very head of our military would be wise to keep in mind the value of these seemingly bizarre, quaint, confusing, and endearing symbols, rituals, beliefs, and behaviours- they go to the very heart of the Regimental system, and are the foundation of the profession of arms.
