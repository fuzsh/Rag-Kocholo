        "text": "Invasion of France, secure the Cherborg peninsula south of Normandy.\n\nSpearheaded the XV Corp break -through in Central France.\n\nNov.'44, halted the savage counter-attack of the Panzer LEHR Division that threatened the Allied XV Corps.\n\nAdvanced through the breached Maginot Line, withstanding tremendous enemy counter-offensives in the forest of Ardennes.\n\nDec. '44 - Jan. '45, southern flank of the The Battle of The Bulge, underwent retreat and repeated counter-attacks against the Allied Forces trapped in the Vosges Mountains.\n\nMar.27, '45. 2nd Platoon first allied unit to cross the Rhine River. (P.S. Does that make me the first nisei to cross the Rhine River in WW II?)\n\nFirst unit to cross the Neckar River to secure Heidelberg.\n\nMay 1, '45, withstood the last counter-offensive of WWII in the Bavarian Alps to open up the Brenner Pass link to northern Italy.\n\nToo many, from the beginning to the end of the war. Here are a few:\n\nMy experience at the recruitment office in San Francisco when I tried to enlist on Dec. 8, 1941. Refer to document in file.\n\nMy army was made up of a cross section of: country boys, college boys, hillbillys, farm boys, northern city boys, red necks from the deep south boys. All white caucasians, except me, and one other nisei in another unit. When assigned to an all white unit, at first I would be greeted with hostile stares, called a chink or a Jap! Once we were in combat, that hostility disappeared of course. Survivors of combat became lifetime buddies. One such buddy named his boy after me.\n\nCombat pay. Infantry men in combat get combat pay. The combat medic, who goes through the same combat, does not. My platoon members always embarrased me on pay day by passing the hat around and then coming over to me and saying - ''Here's your combat pay, Doc.''\n\nCombat Infantryman Badge, the C.I.B. The C.I.B. is awarded only to infantry men who went through combat. This piece of tin is the most treasured of all awards to an infantry man. It is displayed above all other medals. (Notice that when you see pictures of famous generals, like Colin Powell, Eric Shinseki, William F. Dean, they will have a chestful of medals. The C.I.B. will be displayed on top.) When I parted from my platoon, they gave me a beat up C.I.B. and told me to ''wear it proudly''.\n\nThe Battle of Fern Pass, or, a typical day in the life of a combat medic. This horrific battle demonstrates the futility of war - so many casualties and deaths 4 days from the end of the European war."
