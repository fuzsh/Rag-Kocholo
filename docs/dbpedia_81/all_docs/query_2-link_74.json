The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 4:02 p.m., in Room 334, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Ann Marie Buerkle [Chairwoman of the Subcommittee] presiding. Present: Representatives Buerkle, Roe, Runyan, Michaud, Reyes, and Donnelly. Also Present: Representative Walz. OPENING STATEMENT OF ANN MARIE BUERKLE, CHAIRWOMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH Ms. Buerkle. Good afternoon, and thank you all for being here this afternoon. Before we would begin, I would like to ask unanimous consent--although I don't see him here yet, for our colleague, Mr. Tim Walz from Minnesota, to sit at the dais and participate in today's proceeding. Without objection, so ordered. Today, we meet to discuss the role of faith-based and community providers in helping servicemembers, veterans, and their families transition from active duty to civilian life and the need to foster better communication, education, and collaboration between the Department of Veterans Affairs and these critical community resources. The responsibility for each one of us to care for those who have borne the battle has never been so strong with the brutal toll of a decade of war and a bad economy. We continue to hear stories of veterans from past conflicts and our recently returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan struggling to find a home, a job, or a helping hand. The need to meet these honored heroes where they are and provide them the care, the hope, and the help they earned has never felt so immediate. As a Nation, we are uniquely blessed to live in a country with a rich history of civic pride and responsibility, and it is to these communities where our veterans return home, where they have maintained their existing relationships, and, more often than not, where they first turn for help. While the primary responsibility for caring for our veterans does and should lie with the VA, faith-based and community groups are playing an increasingly key role in supporting the varied needs of our servicemembers, veterans, and their families. They act as a bridge to accessing Federal, State, and local programs and services. Members of the clergy in particular are often the first point of contact with the veteran grappling with the wounds of war. Data from the VA National Chaplain Center indicates that four out of ten individuals with mental health challenges seek clergy assistance, more than any other mental health providers combined. We already know that faith-based and community groups can be effective in filling known gaps in VA care and supporting the day-to-day needs of a veteran population. However, a district symposium I held in my home district of Syracuse last December revealed to me a shameful lack of communication, collaboration, and coordination between the VA and these critical community resources and, subsequently, an urgent need to act to establish meaningful partnerships between the VA and nongovernmental organizations. With more of our servicemembers returning home each day, we cannot afford to let any opportunity to better support our veterans pass us by. Where partnerships exist, they need to be strengthened. Where they don't, they need to be fostered. For a veteran or a loved one in need, every door should be an open door. Again, I thank all of you for joining us this afternoon. I look forward to a productive and ongoing conversation. I now recognize our Ranking Member, Mr. Michaud, for any remarks he might have. [The prepared statement of Ann Marie Buerkle appears on p. 39.] OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL H. MICHAUD, RANKING DEMOCRATIC MEMBER Mr. Michaud. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I, too, would like to thank everyone for attending today's hearing. This hearing is intended to open up the broader thought process and better understanding on how the VA and community organizations collaborate to support veterans and their families. More than 2 million servicemembers have been deployed since September of 2001, with hundreds of thousands of them being deployed more than once. As of February 2012, more than 6,000 troops have been killed and over 47,000 have been wounded in action in the recent conflicts. When these servicemembers come home and take off the uniform, many of them have the expectation that life will just pick up where they left off before they were deployed. However, this is not the case. Many of them struggle to reconnect with their families and communities. They find themselves feeling isolated and unable to cope. The Department of Veterans Affairs reports that half of the OEF, OIF, and OND population that has access to VA health care has sought mental health treatment. Post-traumatic stress disorder is the number one reported mental health concern among this population. With so many OEF, OIF, OND servicemembers and veterans experiencing psychological wounds, reports suggest that there is an increase in the rates of suicide, alcohol and drug abuse, homelessness, and domestic violence. For this reason, it is essential that our servicemembers, veterans, and their families receive the help they need and that they have necessary tools to rejoin their communities. These programs and resources would not be possible without the thousands of community organizations across the country that work in partnership with the VA. At this hearing, I want to hear more about the reintegration challenges that servicemembers, veterans, and veterans' families face as well as the challenges the VA and community organizations face as well in providing support services. We need to identify potential solutions to these barriers and how we can strengthen these partnerships. Despite historic increases in the VA funding over the past 5 years as the Nation prepares for an influx of returning veterans, reintegration efforts are simply not possible without collaboration between the Federal Government, business sector, and nonprofit organizations; and more needs to be done to facilitate these partnerships. I would like to take the time to thank our panelists for being here today, this afternoon, and I look forward to working with you as you support the Nation's veterans. I would especially like to thank Mr. Morris and Mr. McCoy for their service as chaplains in the Minnesota National Guard and the VA's National Chaplains Center respectively. In 2009, I led a congressional delegation to Afghanistan and came to learn that our servicemembers rely immensely on their chaplains for emotional support. Every trip since then I have come to respect the unique insight that our chaplains possess in terms of mental health, spiritual guidance, and the overall well-being of our servicemen and women. I look forward to hearing your testimony today as well. I want to thank you once again, Madam Chair, for having this very important hearing this afternoon. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Michael Michaud appears on p. 39.] Ms. Buerkle. Thank you, Mr. Michaud. Now I would like to invite our first panel to the witness table. With us today is Andrew Davis, a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraq Freedom, the Director of the Veterans Services for Saratoga County, New York, and the founder of the Saratoga County Veterans Resource Initiative. Mr. Davis served in both Afghanistan and Iraq with the U.S. Army 75th Ranger Regiment where he earned the Bronze Star with Valor, the Combat Parachutist Badge, and the Combat Infantryman's Badge and is a true American hero. Mr. Davis, thank you for your service to this country. It is an honor to have you here today with us, and I very much look forward to hearing your testimony. You may begin. STATEMENT OF ANDREW DAVIS, VETERAN, DIRECTOR, SARATOGA COUNTY VETERANS SERVICE AGENCY, SARATOGA COUNTY, NEW YORK Mr. Davis. Good afternoon, Chairwoman Buerkle, Ranking Member Michaud, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for the invitation to discuss the role of community providers and faith-based organizations in helping servicemembers transition to civilian life and the need for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to use these resources and collaborate. My name is Andrew Davis. I am currently the Director of the Saratoga County Veterans Service Agency and the founder of the Saratoga VRI. I have been a veterans advocate since separating from the service in 2004 where I served as a United States Army Ranger for 5 years, to include two tours of duty in Afghanistan and one in Iraq. Upon returning to my home in Minnesota to further my education, I was faced with my first taste of how little I knew about being a veteran. In fact, like many of my peers, I was unsure if I even was a veteran. I was on a campus of 40,000 students, and I didn't know any veterans around me. Because of this, I founded a nonprofit veterans support organization on the campus of the U of M to aid returning veterans in connecting with earned benefits and services. In later roles as a congressional staffer and a Department of Defense Transition Assistance Advisor, I saw firsthand the disconnect between veterans, their families, and the systems that are intended to support them. For the past 3 years, I have spent my career as a veterans advocate, either training accredited benefits counselors or being one myself; and this has provided me a frontline view of what is lacking in outreach and networked support to our veterans and their families. Last, I am currently an enrolled patient with the Veterans Health Administration in VISN-2 and use both the Albany Stratton VA Medical Center and Clifton Park Community-Based Outreach Clinic regularly. Veterans and the ways they serve have changed significantly over the last decade, resulting in the need for changes in the way our country, in turn, serves them. The veterans of today tend to be more geographically dispersed and more mobile than previous generations. Families and communities are affected and changed differently than ever before with multiple deployments and the unique use of the Guard and Reserve. Many of these individuals suffer from a lack of a ``Fort New York'' or a ``Fort Minnesota'' or a central support system, making the local community even more crucial in the reintegration process. Despite a constant bombardment of media in all forms that afford the public access to our current wars, issues facing our neighbors, friends, family members, and other local veterans are often invisible to us as communities. Add to this a military culture that can encourage emotional toughness and self-sufficiency, and we face a large potential public health problem. Last, the uniqueness that makes our military and our veteran population great also means that there is not a one- size-fits-all support system that can be created nationwide. We must garner community support and use community services to serve our veterans and their families completely. First and foremost, the population of veterans that find their way into the VA system of care or benefits system merely by accident is staggering. I can safely say that approximately five to seven veterans knock on my door weekly for some form of unrelated government service to find they are eligible for veterans benefits or care because of their service to this Nation. Just last week, a young Marine with two tours of duty in Afghanistan appeared in my office asking for directions to the office that handles unemployment benefits. This Marine outlined he had no idea what services he was eligible for or how to use his 5 years of free health care. So we sat down with him and helped him. If this Marine had not knocked on the wrong door, he would not have met with my staff to turn on his GI Bill benefits or learn where he could get health care. By all appearances, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has recognized the need for community outreach but holds their hopes in the idea that top-down, one-sided information will filter down to the grassroots folks at the bottom helping individuals. For example, in the VISN-2 of Upstate New York, a few competent and well-trained veterans justice coordinators have been hired and put in place. However, the operative words here are ``a few.'' These people are responsible for numerous counties and for interacting with courts, district attorneys, and law enforcement, when in fact the police officers on the beat may be able to help them immediately. The correct mindset for reaching veterans must transition to a ``no wrong door'' approach. This can and should be created through a localized national training by VA, veterans advocates, and other experts to all members of the local communities. These newly created veteran-friendly communities would have the tools to make referrals to the proper resources, whether a veteran walks into a rectory, a tax assessor's office, or is pulled over during a traffic stop. Additionally, outreach and assistance programs cannot be reactionary in nature. The time to begin helping a veteran in legal trouble, for example, is upon first interaction, not just at sentencing. In fact, in my own transition, it was a police officer who pulled me over for driving in Minneapolis like I had been in Haditha and Bagram and introduced me to my first veterans advocate and helped me to realize that difficulty transitioning was normal. Additionally, I now receive as an accredited service officer a large number of referrals from local police officers that I call my friends. In sum, we as a Nation must stand committed to ensuring that sustainable and quality supportive services are accessible to veterans and their families right in their communities. I believe this can be done by leveraging resources that largely already exist in a cost-effective manner. The VA has the geographical disbursement and expertise to lead change, but we must think outside the box and look to those who are ready and willing to assist in our own backyards. The requirements to make this successful are not numerous. In many cases, putting out outreach staff and community advance is all it will take. We must begin immediately leveraging relationships and expertise that has long existed. Thank you again to the Committee for allowing me to speak to these important issues. [The prepared statement of Andrew Davis appears on p. 40.] Ms. Buerkle. Thank you very much, Mr. Davis; and, again, thank you for your service to our country. I am going to begin by yielding myself 5 minutes for questions. In your written testimony, you remark that after leaving the military you, as well as some of your peers, were unsure if you were even a veteran. If you look at the overall scheme of things, that is incredible, with the service that you gave to our Nation. I would like you to, if you could, expand on that statement and give us some insight into that. Mr. Davis. Absolutely. I like to point that out, ma'am, at any chance I can. In my eyes, a veteran was my grandfather at the American Legion who was telling World War II stories when I was a young kid. Additionally, I think there is a large confusion among our Guard and Reserve population and even those who support these wars from the homeland who may not even think of themselves as a veteran when you consider the folks who are coming home missing limbs or who have served multiple tours in combat. So an important distinction I like to point out to community members who are interested in helping is asking somebody if they or a family member have ever served in the United States military, as opposed to are you a veteran, because that can be sort of a dicey question. Ms. Buerkle. Thank you. Can you talk about how we can get to that veteran community when they are processing out and they are still active duty? How can we make it known to them that they would qualify for veteran assistance? Mr. Davis. Ma'am, I think one important thing to understand is that, no matter where we separate from, there is a very good possibility that is not where we are going to stay. I can tell you from my own experience separating in Fort Benning, Georgia, and returning to Minnesota, I got every resource available to me to stay in Fort Benning, Georgia, but I wasn't staying there. So the veteran returning to Syracuse from Marine duty in Camp Pendleton needs to be provided in Syracuse that local contact, whether that is a veterans service agency director or whether it is a VA clinic contact. But they need the contacts at home, not where they are separating from. Ms. Buerkle. Can you tell me how you think that the VA's reluctance to integrate with community resources may have obstructed your transition or other veterans' transitions into becoming a veteran? Mr. Davis. Yes, ma'am. I think the important thing that veterans need to understand when they are separating from duty is that every benefit needs to be turned on with the process of an application. For me, going to the University of Minnesota and having to use GI Bill benefits, I guess I just assumed somebody on campus was going to be there to help me, another veteran or somebody who was responsible for this benefit. But there wasn't one out of 40,000 that was there to assist with that effort. So if the VA had seen that this massive college campus was going to attract veterans, they may have put somebody proactively there or trained somebody. That is just education. But that person could also refer me to a health care resource or something similar. Ms. Buerkle. So now you are director of a community program; and I would like you to, if you could, describe for us your interactions with the VA now and what kind of relationship you have and how the VA is treating your group? Mr. Davis. Madam Chair, we come in quarterly to the VA hospital in Albany, and we do get to hear about departmental changes. We get a top-down budget overview of what the VA hospital director is dealing with. It does tend to be a fairly one-sided conversation. We hear about changes to the orthopedics ward or something like that, and we occasionally get to talk about an issue that is facing maybe one of our veterans. But as far as being able to have a two-way conversation about how to improve, that does not take place. In addition, I would point out that we hold events as county agencies that are for the purpose of outreach. The VA is invited to all of those, and I would be remiss if I told you that they were at all of those. They rarely take advantage of those community activities, at least in my area. Ms. Buerkle. I don't mean to ask you to speak or try to be in the mind of the VA, but why do you think there is a reluctance to collaborate with some of the outside groups rather than just the VA? Mr. Davis. Purely speculation, ma'am. I would say they may feel that they are the experts and the veterans should come to them and they can't share that load. But, again, that is purely speculation. I also would say that maybe it has never happened before, so maybe there is some reluctance to jump in and try something new. Ms. Buerkle. And last, if you could--and I just have a few seconds left--what barriers do you see for more effective relationships between the VA and some of the outside service groups? Mr. Davis. Ma'am, I think information sharing is obviously a fear among all agencies, how do we talk about veterans and get the proper consent for issues that they may be facing, whether it be mental or physical health care. But I also think staffing is something they always fall back on, and I have seen that take place in my area. Ms. Buerkle. I thank you very much, Mr. Davis. I now yield 5 minutes to the Ranking Member, Mr. Michaud. Mr. Michaud. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I also want to thank you, Mr. Davis, for your service to this great Nation of ours. I appreciate it. Speaking about mental health, do you have any suggestions for us or the VA on creative approaches to addressing the mental health needs of returning veterans and their families? Mr. Davis. Sir, I appreciate the question. I would say that one thing that comes up often among my veterans is a reluctance to go physically to a VA mental center or even to a VA vet center, which is even more comfortable for that mental care, and a strong leaning toward paying out of pocket for private providers in their own backyard. So if there was some way to leverage that outsourcing, for lack of a better term, I would say that would go a long ways. But, too, also opening more mental health care to families and children out there where that family dynamic has changed through deployment, sometimes multiple deployments, sir. Mr. Michaud. Thank you. You mentioned the collaboration between the VA and the local community resources, some of the things that they should do. Is there anything in particular that you can tell this Subcommittee on what can we do to encourage more of that particular collaboration between the two? Mr. Davis. Sir, I think the VA needs to get out into the community a little more. My experience has been that there is not a shortage of people out in my communities that want to help, whether that be mental health providers on the private side or whether it be churches and law enforcement where I get a lot of my referrals from. They are ready to help, but they are not really sure where to send people to, because the VA, at least in my area, hasn't been out in force giving them cards and saying what they do. Mr. Michaud. You made an interesting point, and I actually heard Judge Russell, who is a judge in New York for the Veterans Court, and he made a good point and you just reemphasized that point. A lot of times veterans don't feel that they are veterans, and he rephrases the question now is how many people served in the military. When you look at outreach, I know the VA is trying to do more in outreach, getting veterans into the VA system, what do you think that we should do for more of an outreach type of program? Because a lot of veterans out there are not signing up because they don't realize that they are eligible. How do you envision us doing a better job in getting people into the VA system? Mr. Davis. Sir, I believe the question does need to be rephrased across the board. I think anytime we are looking to help veterans we need to ask that, have you or a family member ever served in the United States military, and that really breaks the ice. But, too, it allows me as an advocate and all of my peers as advocates to really start to look at what benefits might be available. I hate to put it this way, but the thing that gets a lot of veterans in my door is you might be missing out on some significant savings financially or on some serious financial benefits, whether it be a property tax exemption or disability compensation or free health care. So money gets people in the door, unfortunately, but also asking the right questions. Mr. Michaud. Do you think the Governors of each State and probably the President ought to do an executive order requiring every Federal agency or State agency that has an interaction, whether it is unemployment benefits, Medicare, or Medicaid, that one of the first questions that they ask is have you ever served in the military and somehow getting that information to the VA so they can reach out to those types of individuals? Mr. Davis. Yes, sir. I think every temporary assistance office, social services department, Medicaid, Medicare, but also every college application at a State-run school should have that question being asked and it should generate some sort of referral. Again, that no-wrong-door approach is crucial in helping these folks. Mr. Michaud. You had mentioned in your testimony that the VA interaction, that there is more of it dealt with on the VHA side versus the VBA side. How do you think the interaction between the two should be between VHA health and benefits side? Mr. Davis. Sir, I think one thing I am up against oftentimes with my clients is explaining the siloed barriers within the VA, that the cemetery administration and the health care administration and the benefits administration are not one entity. So you can actually theoretically get care at the VA hospital for 40 years and never have a disability claim put in, and vice versa, and I think that is confusing to veterans. And I think oftentimes when a veteran has a real problem with a claim within the VBA, they tend to blame the doctor at the hospital at the VHA, and vice versa, and it is not fair to the VA employees, but it is also not fair to the veteran to not understand that disparity. So I think having a more across-the-board understanding, but also, when we are talking to VHA, VBA and VCA should be in the room as well, and vice versa. Mr. Michaud. Thank you very much. I yield back, Madam Chair. Ms. Buerkle. Thank you. I now recognize the gentleman from Tennessee, Dr. Roe. Mr. Roe. Thank you. I just have a couple of questions for Mr. Davis. Again, thank you for your service to our country. I appreciate that. I think probably the first time I ever realized I was a veteran was somebody asking me to stand up at a Lincoln Day dinner. I never really thought about it very much. And, obviously, until you need those benefits, you don't. Last Congress, I went to Afghanistan with Mr. Michaud, and just got back from Afghanistan again on a CODEL I led about 4 months ago. And we stopped in Landstuhl. I think the DoD is doing a better job of informing, at least from when I got out. Really, it was a couple of days and you were gone, not really knowing what benefits you had, if any. So I think they are doing a better job today. Where is the breakdown? Because there is so much access to information. It is just that our soldiers, when you have made that determination that you are going home, you go home and you don't think about it until you have a problem. Then, like you say, when you are at Benning or where I grew up near Fort Campbell, Kentucky, you have all kinds of support there. But if you move down to Hole in the Wall, Tennessee, you may not. We have a VA hospital in our community. People know where to go. But that is not necessarily for everyone, there are only three of them in the State of Tennessee. So how would you best get that information out to people? How do you do that? Mr. Davis. Well, sir, as my friend Colonel Morris will probably say, you are given the world's most important information as a veteran at the world's worst time by the world's worst briefers. As you are attempting to move your family and your livelihood back home or to the new location in this country, you are not thinking about those benefits, as you say. So even just having a contact card printed out for you at your transition would be a lot more helpful than a 130-slide briefing on the big picture of benefits. So the first thing I would say is we need to start teaching people how to be veterans at the beginning of their service and throughout their service, as opposed to right in the last 2 weeks. But the second piece is getting people in who are actually advocates to brief, as opposed to the payers of the benefits, meaning the big-picture VA folks giving us that long PowerPoint presentation. Mr. Roe. I know our veterans service officers where we are do a tremendous job. And people come in, they really don't know the difference between these acronyms--VBA, VA. I mean, it is all one to them. They just think it is one. You are absolutely right. I see it all the time in my congressional office. If a disability claim is not moving forward and we get in on it, they don't know that the VA has nothing to do it. The hospital where they are going doesn't have anything to do with that. That is a totally different issue. I don't know that that is important. All the veteran wants is their benefits taken care of. So you would suggest a simple thing to do would be just be some contact, just a card with contact information. We ought to be able to make that happen pretty easily, if you think that would be helpful. Mr. Davis. I do, sir. I think attached to that DD-214 when you leave Fort Campbell should be here is the six most important people in your home county you need to see: unemployment, veterans advocate at the service office. You know, you name it. But these are the go-to folks when you get home. Mr. Roe. If you need some help, if the issue comes up, contact one of these people; and, like you said, there is no wrong door. Mr. Davis. Yes, sir. Mr. Roe. Any of them can open the door. I am not going to disagree with anything you said, except for one thing. I don't think the needs of veterans have changed at all. I had an aunt that knew my great-grandfather who survived the Civil War, and my great grandmother had said that he was never right after that war, meaning that he had problems. There just were no benefits then. I think veterans have experienced the same things. I think we are doing a better job. The GI Bill is spectacular. That is all I can say about it. It wasn't kicked out very well, but the Secretary has smoothed out some of those bumps. When a person goes and gets their veterans' benefit for their GI Bill, you are saying that the University of Minnesota, a huge, great university, didn't have any help. I mean, they have thousands of people working at that college, and so do most colleges that are of any size like that. They had no one there who knew what to do for you, where to send you? Mr. Davis. No, sir. And I can say that that has improved greatly across the country. Just 2 years ago, we kicked off a veteran-friendly campus event around New York; and we saw great universities like Syracuse University who have full offices for veterans. But that was not in existence when I separated in 2004. Mr. Roe. So just in a short time you have been able to see that? Mr. Davis. Yes, sir. Mr. Roe. Once again, thank you for your service. I yield back. Ms. Buerkle. Thank you, Dr. Roe. Now I recognize the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Donnelly. Mr. Donnelly. Thank you, Madam Chair; and, Mr. Davis, I too want to thank you for everything you have done for our country. There is no way we can ever repay your hard work, your dedication, and everything you have done for us; and we are very much in your service and in your appreciation. I wanted to ask about the Saratoga County Veterans Resource Initiative. What role does the VA play in the gatherings that you have when you gather quarterly to check best practices? Mr. Davis. Sir, to date, we have had six meetings, and the VA has been present at one, and it was the second meeting, and that was in the form of the families outreach program that existed at the Albany VA Medical Center. The VHA and the Vet Center have been invited to every meeting and have yet to have much participation. Mr. Donnelly. Did they tell you why? Mr. Davis. Every time, sir, it has been that they didn't have the staff or they hadn't gotten approval to attend. Mr. Donnelly. Okay. And I apologize if I missed this early on in your testimony, but, at those gatherings, have they proved pretty fruitful for you? Mr. Davis. Yes, sir. At the very beginning, we learned how this room full of people that all knew each other had no idea what any of us did on behalf of veterans, so at that very level it started being helpful. In addition, I don't go more than 3 days without a call from a fellow member of the Resource Initiative with a referral from a veteran who came into their office. So, yes. Mr. Donnelly. So have you found that there is a lot of people trying real hard, but it is like a bunch of cars driving past each other and nobody knows what is going on in the other cars? Mr. Davis. Yes, sir. Exactly. Mr. Donnelly. Okay. Well, I promise you we will work real hard with you, take the lessons you have given us, and try to make sure we can spread the things you are doing to the rest of the country. Thank you again, sir. Ms. Buerkle. Thank you. I now yield to the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Bilirakis. Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you so much for holding this hearing, Madam Chair. I appreciate it. Thank you for your service, sir. We are pretty active in our congressional district. I have an advisory council. We have a resource fair on an annual basis. We just finished a jobs fair that was very well attended. I visit the VFWs, as does my staff, American Legions, what have you, and also go to the VA. But what more can we do as a congressional office. I know that one of the reasons you are here is to testify on behalf of how we can bring the VA closer to our veterans. What more can we do? Do you have any suggestions? You know, we can always do more. What can we do as a congressional office to further that goal? Mr. Davis. Sir, it sounds like you are doing a lot of the things that I would suggest. But one thing I often point out to congressional staff is that veterans, when they come to a congressional staff member, have never, many times, filed a claim or even interacted with the VA for the first time. They are just under that assumption that they are a veteran who is eligible for something and in turn is not getting what they deserve. So that reverse referral to a local advocate, whether it be an American Legion service officer or whether it be a county person or a State person I think is the first step I would take. Because, oftentimes, your staff is very overwhelmed and may not know everything about the local benefits or the State benefits on top of the Federal, or vice versa. So a reverse referral would be a big suggestion I would make. Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you very much. I yield back, Madam Chair. Ms. Buerkle. I now yield to the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Runyan. Mr. Runyan. No questions. I yield back. Ms. Buerkle. Thank you. We will wait for Mr. Reyes. Mr. Reyes, I know you just joined us. We have Mr. Davis here, if you have any questions. Mr. Reyes. I have no questions. Ms. Buerkle. I guess that is it for questions, Mr. Davis. Again, thank you very much for your testimony and for your comments. You are now excused. Mr. Davis. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Buerkle. I invite the second panel to the witness table. With us today is Chaplain John Morris, the Joint Force Headquarters Chaplain from the Minnesota National Guard. Chaplain Morris is a Colonel in the Minnesota National Guard and is the co-founder of the Beyond the Yellow Ribbon Initiative which facilitates collaborations between the Minnesota National Guard, VA, and local faith-based and community resources to support the reintegration of Minnesota's National Guard combat veterans. I would like to thank you, Chaplain Morris, for your service to our Nation and for your very important advocacy efforts. I will now yield to Mr. Donnelly to introduce our next witness. Mr. Donnelly. Thank you, Madam Chair; and it is a great honor to have Dr. MacDermid Wadsworth. Madam Chair, fellow Health Subcommittee Members, I would like to introduce you to Dr. Shelley MacDermid Wadsworth, an Associate Dean of Purdue University's College of Health and Human Sciences. As a Notre Dame grad, it pains me to mention Purdue, but I will do so anyhow. Dr. MacDermid Wadsworth also serves as director of Purdue's Military Family Research Institute which works to improve the lives of servicemembers and their families in Indiana and across the country by strengthening and supporting the efforts of military and civilian organizations to provide services, education, and training to military families. I just want to mention Purdue has done an extraordinary job with this, and we are incredibly grateful. We are grateful to Dr. MacDermid Wadsworth, who knows how many people in our State serve and how dedicated the families and everyone is. And I just want to say that your work is making a difference in the lives of everyone, not only in our State but in the country. Thank you very much. Ms. Buerkle. Thank you, Mr. Donnelly, and welcome, Dr. MacDermid Wadsworth. Also joining our second panel is Dr. David Rudd and Dr. George Ake. Earlier in my opening comments I mentioned we had a symposium in Syracuse, and I was honored to welcome both of you to Syracuse for that event. I don't believe it was snowing that day, and we had a very successful symposium. Dr. Rudd is the Dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Utah, where he also serves as Scientific Director for the National Center for Veterans Studies. In addition, he was recently elected Distinguished Practitioner and Scholar of the National Academies of Practice in Psychology. Dr. Rudd is also a Gulf War veteran, and I would like to thank him for his honorable service to our Nation in uniform and for his continued dedication to improving the lives of his fellow veterans through his research. Thank you, Dr. Rudd. Dr. Ake is an Assistant Professor of Medical Psychology at the Duke University Medical Center, and he is here today on behalf of the American Psychological Association. Dr. Ake is a child psychologist and has worked extensively with the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, where his work has focused on assisting children and families who have experienced stressful and traumatic life events, including a military deployment and its aftermath. He is a recent winner of the Durham, North Carolina, Police Department's Community Service Award, and it is an honor to have him with us today. I thank you all very much for being here this afternoon. I am eager to begin our discussion. So, Chaplain Morris, we will start with you. Thank you very much. STATEMENTS OF CHAPLAIN JOHN J.

DAVID RUDD, PH.D., ABPP, DEAN, COLLEGE OF SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, SCIENTIFIC DIRECTOR, NATIONAL CENTER FOR VETERAN STUDIES, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH; AND GEORGE AKE III, PH.D., ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF MEDICAL PSYCHOLOGY, DUKE UNIVERSITY, AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION STATEMENT OF CHAPLAIN JOHN J. MORRIS Colonel Morris. Chair Buerkle, Ranking Member Michaud, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the honor of being here. I am Chaplain Morris. I am the State Chaplain of the Minnesota National Guard, and I am fortunate to be the co- founder of the Beyond the Yellow Ribbon Program that you made the national standard for the reintegration of the Reserve and the Guard. I am a three-tour combat veteran. I am the son of a combat veteran. I am the father of two combat veterans. I am here as a fan of the VA. I am a customer. I am also a close collaborator, and my daughters are customers. The Minnesota Guard has had a very productive relationship with the VA, and I think we have something to share with the Nation, but I will encapsulate it in this story from Saturday. I was at an event for 2,500 of our families whose soldiers are now serving in Kuwait. We were feeding them. A mother came up to me and said, you don't remember me. My son came home with a local infantry unit from Kosovo, and you were at the reintegration event, and I asked you to help my son. I want you to see him. He is doing so much better. I sat down with the young man. I indeed had pulled him out of the registration line that morning 30 days after returning from a 9-month tour in Kosovo. He was high on crack. We immediately took him to the emergency room of the local hospital in Rochester, Minnesota. After a 72-hour hold there, he was taken to St. Cloud VA for inpatient chemical dependency treatment. And he was proud to tell me a year and a half later he was straight, he was sober, he was married, and introduced me to his wife, who was pregnant with twins, and he was facing a tremendous future. That is the collaboration that we have with the VA in Minnesota. We have done the RINGS 1 and 2 study with our First Brigade, which is on its second combat deployment. The Minneapolis VA has done a tremendous longitudinal study with our soldiers and their families that I think is going to set straight some of the mythology around PTSD and over-reporting of that problem and an under-reporting of the impact that healthy community reintegration-based programs can have on returning veterans. We have pushed VA teams far forward to enroll our demobilizing soldiers at demob sites around the country. We have had the VA actually train our command and staff--I was a part of this in 2009--preparing to deploy to Iraq. We had the VA train our commanding general and all of our leading staff in the polytrauma unit in Minnesota. We got a first-hand look at what war is really like, the impact of the weaponry of war and on the human body and what combat trauma can do. So we have a good relationship, but I think the VA could do even better, and so I am here today to talk about some of those problems and some of the solutions. The VA suffers under the perception of being a very isolated institution, and it has a stigma. All we hear about it is bad things. We rarely hear the great things they do. From loss of laptops and compromise of our security to homeless veterans who commit suicide, the mantra of bad news about the VA is steady, and it really affects the community's view of the VA. And I can say that as a person who deals every day with community leaders throughout Minnesota. The institutionalism of the VA which Andy Davis so well alluded to is a problem and it keeps the VA inside its building and not always out in the community sharing its knowledge with us who are on the ground working with the majority of the veterans. I think, unfortunately, the steady mantra about PTSD, 25 percent--whatever it is, the CBO report that came out last week saying 21 percent--I think it is over-reported, and it is not substantiated, and it has created an impression that the VA is the only institution that can solve combat trauma, that all veterans have it, and it is contributing to a double-digit unemployment rate among our veterans--which is truly the problem we have. It is getting work. It is not getting mental health care. Minnesota is the land of 10,000 mental health and chemical dependency treatment centers. We like to say it is 10,000 lakes, but it is 10,000 treatment centers. There are plenty of people who want to help us with mental health. That is not our biggest problem. And we are caught in some kind of a loop between the VA and Congress trumpeting a problem, when the bigger problem is being underfunded and underaddressed. And we can fix it, and we can do it in Minnesota, and we are going to do it. We have gotten the VA to come out into the community and work with us, get on to our drill floors and talk to our families. We have had the VA come and meet with our physicians and share the knowledge that the VA has so that the provider out in rural America can take care of families and veterans. We have synchronized services so that when somebody leaves VA care they can tie into Yellow Ribbon communities to get the care they need. And we have asked the VA to not only publish what they know in academic journals but to share with lay people through veterans organizations and through our political and elected representatives so that news can get down and counter the steady stream of bad news. I think the VA's one important part of the reintegration process--it is not the only part, and it is not the most important part--the most important part of the reintegration process is the community. It is our responsibility to bring our soldiers all the way home and to take care of their families. We sent them to war. It is our job to bring them back. The VA is a partner in that, but it is not a stand-alone partner. It is not the only partner. It is a partner. Every State that is empowered through its Governor to partner with its VA will be an effective State in reaching its communities and empowering them to bring their veterans all the way home. At the end of the day, we are going to live in communities, we are going to serve in communities, and if we can't learn to be productive in our communities, it won't matter how good the VA is. We still won't be all the way home. Madam Chair, thank you for this privilege to be here; and, Committee Members, thank you for what you are doing. It is an honor to be here, and it has been a great privilege for me as part of my career to have this chance to share this with you. [The prepared statement of John Morris appears on p. 43.] Ms. Buerkle. Thank you very much Chaplain Morris. Dr. MacDermid Wadsworth. STATEMENT OF SHELLEY MacDERMID WADSWORTH, PH.D. Ms. Wadsworth. Thank you. Chairwoman Buerkle, Congressman Michaud, and distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for convening this hearing; and thank you to Representative Donnelly for such a kind introduction. I am proud to be a faculty member at Purdue University, the land grant institution for the great State of Indiana, and also to direct the Military Family Research Institute. I am pleased to report that we were involved in several innovative collaborations involving the VA. Our vision is to make a difference for families who serve. My institute has created or participates in collaborations involving VA partners in the areas of homelessness, higher education, vocational rehabilitation, behavioral health care, outreach to community partners, and research. Our higher education initiative, for example, is putting mechanisms in place that could help every student, servicemember, and veteran in Indiana and potentially reduce GI Bill costs with the help of VA certifying officials, the Indiana Commission on Higher Education, and others. The vocational rehabilitation effort for which we serve as the evaluation partner has been a national leader in placing wounded warriors in employment and keeping them there; and, again, without VA professionals at the table, this would not have occurred. Based on these experiences, I know that successful collaborations are possible, can benefit military and veterans' families significantly, and can contribute substantively to the VA mission. I identify several keys to success in my written statement but will focus my remarks here on challenges and opportunities that might benefit from policy or legislative attention. Number one: Create clear points of entry for prospective collaborators in multiple VA tracks. Prospective community partners, particularly those located at a physical distance from a medical center, find it very difficult to determine whom to approach to partner, and the independence of the medical centers means that there must be a local connection. The VA Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships is very important, but there are still many untapped partners who can multiply the reach of the VA. Number two: Develop mechanisms to separate the ``wheat'' from the ``chaff'' among prospective partners. VA professionals are understandably wary of showing favoritism to particular organizations. Unfortunately, this means that reputable partners with much to offer may get held at arm's length, the same as bad actors. Number three: Reduce structural barriers to collaboration. It is difficult to get information from the VA sometimes. It is difficult for outsiders to engage in research with VA populations. It is difficult for community partners to find and connect with military and veteran families, particularly in low-density areas. Sometimes it feels as though there is a fence around the VA. Number four: Provide tangible incentives and benefits to community and VA partners who collaborate effectively. Collaborations do take resources, but they also can generate resources by attracting additional contributions of skills, people, money, or information. Compared to the costs of services that don't get used and clients who don't get served, collaborations can be very cost-effective instruments. It has been our great honor to work to make a difference for military and veteran families. We are inspired by the commitment and dedication shown by professionals in many sectors who share that mission, and we are eager to continue collaborating to make positive change. Thank you for all you do to try to make sure that our Nation's veterans receive the care and support they have been promised. This concludes my statement. Thank you for your kind attention. [The prepared statement of Shelley MacDermid Wadsworth appears on p. 46.] Ms. Buerkle. Thank you very much, Dr. MacDermid Wadsworth. Dr. Rudd, you may proceed. STATEMENT OF M. DAVID RUDD, PH.D., ABPP Mr. Rudd. Chairwoman Buerkle, Ranking Member Michaud, and Members of the Subcommittee, I very much appreciate the opportunity to testify on behalf of the National Center for Veterans Studies and the University of Utah. Chairwoman Buerkle, I am very pleased and would tell you enthusiastic about seeing you taking leadership on what I believe to be a critical issue on the reintegration of veterans into society after having served so admirably in terms of our Nation and our needs. You have my written statement. I am not going to repeat much of what is in the statement. I do want to highlight a few critical points. I want to comment on Colonel Morris' note about the issue of reintegration and misunderstanding. I think it is important to recognize that, since the Gulf War, less than 1 percent of Americans have served in the Armed Forces. This is a tremendous shift from World War II when almost 9 percent served; Korea and Vietnam, both greater than 2 percent served. And as we have fewer and fewer Americans serving in the Armed Forces the possibility for misunderstanding, the possibility for difficulty in reintegration is compounded; and I think that probably speaks to the issue that was raised by Colonel Morris, which I think is a vital one. I would like to speak about a couple of areas of research and highlight a few things that I think sheds some light on the opportunity for reintegration, in two areas in particular: one, universities; and, two, organizations, communities of faith and local churches. Some recent work by the Pew Research Center revealed that 27 percent of veterans reported that readjustment to civilian life was either difficult, somewhat difficult, or very difficult. The survey also revealed significant burdens of service identified by servicemembers, with 48 percent reporting strains in family relationships, 47 percent frequently feeling irritable or angry, 44 percent reporting problems reentering civilian life, and 37 percent reporting post-trauma symptoms. This doesn't necessarily mean post-traumatic stress disorder but trauma-related symptoms. Despite the fact that many veterans transition from military life with few problems, I think these data indicate the significance of the problem, and it has been fairly profound over the course of the last 5 years. The Pew data offer insight into the source of the problem as well, particularly in terms of emotional and psychological adjustment. Among those having experienced combat, 50 percent or more report post-trauma symptoms, a difficulty with family relationships. When they were queried about factors reducing the probability for successful reentry into civilian life, veterans identified traumatic experiences and physical injury as the most significant variables. Of importance for this hearing, veterans identified attending church at least weekly as the most important variable associated with an easy and successful reentry into civilian life. A remarkable 67 percent identified attending church once a week or more as making reentry easier. Clearly, the social connections and support offered by religious communities and institutions around the Nation are essential for our veterans. I would tell you that they really possess enormous opportunity to help veterans transition. I think that Colonel Morris spoke to this issue in terms of stigma that is associated with mental health problems, with PTSD in particular. The opportunity for intervention, the opportunity for assistance in local churches is truly remarkable. I would tell you that, of the veterans that I know, the veterans that I have worked with would much rather go to local clergy than to go to a clinical psychologist, to go to a psychiatrist, to go to a mental health specialist. With the right training, with the right resources, that kind of a partnership is precisely one that we need to pursue; and I would like to see the VA take a lead in that area. Now, I can tell you a little bit about my own work that I think has helped clarify the severity and the magnitude of the problems in terms of emotional and psychological issues faced by veterans, and a very specific subset of veterans that I would speak to are student veterans. We recently did a national survey looking at student veterans transitioning from the service back on to university campuses, and I would tell you that, arguably, this is the second-best place to capture veterans, is on university campuses, that outside of the medical centers, outside of the Veterans Benefit Administration, this is where you will find veterans. If you look at the data that are in my statement, you will find that the numbers are fairly profound in terms of the rates and the magnitude of the reported problems. Now, what is interesting is that those veterans are on campus, those veterans are functioning on campus, and I would tell you that they are functioning quite well, but they need assistance. Making sure that campuses are well prepared is something that is critical for us to do. So I would encourage you, in terms of looking for partnerships and expanding partnerships that the VA has already pursued, universities are a wonderful place, communities, organizations, institutions of faith, local churches are a wonderful place. Those are places where veterans will go, those are places where veterans don't feel the severity and the magnitude of stigma, and the opportunity to help is tremendous. So I would encourage you to think about those two areas specifically. I would be happy to talk to you in a little bit more detail if you have questions afterward. But, Chairwoman Buerkle, thank you very much for your time. [The prepared statement of David Rudd appears on p. 49.] Ms. Buerkle. Thank you, Dr. Rudd. Dr. Ake. STATEMENT OF GEORGE AKE III, PH.D. Mr. Ake. Good afternoon, Chairwoman Buerkle, Ranking Member Michaud, and Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the 154,000 members and affiliates of the American Psychological Association regarding the collaboration between the Department of Veterans Affairs and community organizations to support veterans and their families. As a child psychologist at Duke University Medical Center and with the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, my work focuses on assisting children and families who have experienced traumatic life events, including military combat and its aftermath. I am honored to speak with you today about the collaborative work that I and my colleagues are engaged in to support our Nation's military and veteran families. Collaboration among all sectors of society is needed to support the health and well-being of veterans and their families. This includes key partnerships with policymakers, government agencies, universities, the health care community, and the faith-based community. Scientific evidence continues to identify psychological and neurological disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal ideation, and traumatic brain injury as some of the signature wounds of recent conflicts. While psychologists and other health professionals play an essential role in helping veterans and families to address these challenges, partnerships and collaborations with other sectors of society are also critical. While there are numerous specific programs for veterans and their families, many families rely upon the support of faith- based providers as a first point of contact. The members of this community who are here today will address these issues, but I want to underscore the extraordinary value of our collaborative mental health work with faith-based providers related to military and veteran families, a partnership which enriches our work in many ways. I would like to express my deep appreciation to you, Chairwoman Buerkle, for your leadership in advancing collaboration between the mental health faith-based communities and military and veteran families. The unique military and veterans mental health workshop that you hosted for faith-based providers in your district in December served as a wonderful example of the collaboration that is possible across sectors. I was honored to join the distinguished panel of experts that you assembled. Such events help to break down barriers and foster partnerships that benefit veterans and their families. Replicating this training in other congressional districts could serve as a valuable resource. Collaboration between military and faith-based and other community systems is especially important as we consider 2010 Department of Defense data which estimates that 44 percent of the 1.4 million active duty and National Guard-Reserve personnel who deployed to combat missions as a part of OEF, OIF, and OND are parents. DoD also estimates that nearly 2 million children in the United States have parents who are active duty or Reserve personnel, many of whom have experienced multiple combat deployments. Some military families face severe challenges during reintegration, such as a parent who returns changed due to the winds of war or financial hardship, homelessness, marital discord or violence and other difficulties. Still other families experience the grief and loss associated with their loved one's fatal combat injury or even suicide. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the context and challenges for children and families of veterans, as well as the role of the family in facilitating a successful transition to stateside service or civilian life. To support veterans, their families need easy access to collaborative programs and supports through VA and many other service sectors. As a member of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, we are proud to contribute to such efforts. The NCTSN is an initiative launched by Congress in 2000 to develop a national collaborative network to improve best practices and standards of care for children and families affected by traumatic stress, including military families. Our 130 centers in 40 States collaborate with many organizations, including the VA, DoD, the National Guard, the American Psychological Association, faith-based organizations, and many others. We offer evidence-based interventions, educational materials, curriculum for civilian providers, and much more, all available on the Web site. My written testimony offers many specific examples of this work, including a Welcome Back Veterans program at the Duke University for training community clinicians, a collaboration with the VA's National Center for PTSD to train providers, including military chaplains, on acute stress interventions, collaboration with the military chaplains, and a family resilience program called FOCUS now being used at more than 20 military installations, a partnership with the TAPS program to help military families after the death of a loved one, and the ADAPT parenting program for Reserve families in Minnesota. In conclusion, we have seen the collaborative efforts between the military and veteran communities and partners such as faith-based providers, mental health professionals, and others have yielded effective services for our military and veteran families. The American Psychological Association, Duke University Medical Center, and the National Child Traumatic Stress Network all stand ready to continue our collaborative efforts with the Subcommittee, the VA, the DoD, our community- based partners, and the military and veteran community to address these important issues. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today and for your leadership and commitment to our Nation's veterans and their families. [The prepared statement of George Ake appears on p. 51.] Ms. Buerkle. Thank you all very much. I will now yield myself 5 minutes for questions. I will start with Chaplain--Colonel Morris. As an experienced chaplain and someone who has been in the military and a veteran, first of all, do you think there is value with the faith-based community; but, beyond that, how can we integrate that transition using faith-based services? Colonel Morris. Madam Chair, there certainly is value in collaboration between faith-based institutions and the VA and being a part of the reintegration process. We do this in Minnesota in a variety of ways. We train clergy in every community that wants to be a yellow-ribbon community in how to help military families during deployments, and then how to help returning combat veterans reintegrate into their community and into their family. Another thing that faith-based organizations can do is be a part of the employment process. The military does not provide guidance counseling, nor should it, to veterans preparing to leave in how to reenter this free market globally oriented economy. It is a tough transition to find a job here when you have been hauling a rifle around the mountains of Afghanistan. Faith-based organizations have employed people who have done it. Life-to-life transfer, those skills, job-seeking support groups and faith-based organizations are a grass-roots, easy- to-tap sort of a resource that doesn't cost anybody anything, and it provides that sense of community that a veteran needs to hang in there to find that job. This is just a couple of examples. There are plenty more that can be done to tap that virtually untapped segment of our community. Ms. Buerkle. Thank you. Dr. Ake, what is, if any, the VA's involvement with the National Child Traumatic Stress Network? Mr. Ake. To my knowledge there are many different collaborative efforts, including a Webinar tomorrow, a master speaking series from Zero to Three, and the National Child Traumatic Stress Network focused on making sure services are available to veteran families. And so the network often draws on the expertise of many different entities working with military and veteran families to speak on their perspective on how to help them. Ms. Buerkle. So that is your group, not the VA. Are you working directly with the VA? Mr. Ake. I think that is one example as far as drawing on VA speakers for the master speaker series, but there are others related to the Adapt program in Minnesota where there is an after-deployment adapting parenting tools program pulling from several different groups, but I would need to defer to the partners that are actually doing those initiatives. Ms. Buerkle. Thank you. Dr. Wadsworth, in your testimony you talk about structural barriers more so with the veteran population. Can you expand on that a little bit? Ms. Wadsworth. Yes. I think because the Veterans Administration and those who care about the Veterans Administration care a lot about making sure that veterans privacy is protected, making sure that veterans are never subjected to care that is of substandard quality. There are many rules and policies and restrictions and checks and balances in place to try to ensure that all those things happen, but the result is that it can make it very difficult to move forward in collaboration. My primary identity is as a researcher. If I would like to conduct a study of a VA population, the study must be led by a Veterans Administration principal investigator, and that is a structural barrier because it means I have to find somebody who would agree to let me partner with them to do the study. We have a partner who we work with to do outreach. They actually arranged for us to receive the funding instead of them, because we can work with hotels and do logistics more easily than they can. So people find creative workarounds. But these same policies, in many cases that are put in place to protect, end up serving as barriers. Ms. Buerkle. Thank you. And last, Dr. Rudd, you mentioned education being the second-best place to serve as a safety net to locate veterans. Do you have any suggestions for how we can integrate that piece into education with our universities and our colleges and our community colleges? Mr. Rudd. Well, I think there are a number of things we can do. The VA has already implemented the Vet Success on Campus program, which provides actually benefits counselors and rehabilitation counselors that work on university campuses, so they are hired and employed by the VA but actually are placed on the university campus, which is a very good program. But I would tell you that the kind of barrier that exists is a really simple one. So if you take that program as an example of which the University of Utah just started participating this year, the VA has broadly expanded that program over the course of the last year. One of the issues for us, we ultimately were able to work through it, was that we didn't actually get to be involved in the interview process for the hiring of that employee. So we had two employees hired. We didn't get to participate in the interview process because it is a VA employee, but yet they are going to work full time on our campus. Real partnering means that you participate fully. It doesn't mean we get to make the decision, but it means we get to be intimately involved in that partnership, and I think expanding that program would be wonderful. The VA is also experimenting with the placement of psychologists in counseling centers, and so if you look in the University of Texas at Austin, this past year they hired a VA psychologist to work specifically in the counseling center to provide therapy, given issues of stigma at local VA medical centers, and these are individuals that are trained very specifically in the treatment of combat-related trauma. That is a wonderful program. It would be nice to see that expanded and, again, to have that be a true partnership so that you don't necessarily get to dictate who is hired but you are involved in the process of hiring and making sure that it is the right person for the campus. The last thing that I would suggest is that universities as a whole could do a better job at probably the issue that Colonel Morris spoke to, which is really giving credit for military experience. We need to do a better job at giving soldiers credit for life experiences and technical training that they have, and providing college credit for that that facilitates employment. So I would tell you on the university side, we can do a better job. And actually our center is going to pursue some effort nationally about trying to coordinate that in terms of giving academic credit, facilitating the employment picture for veterans. Ms. Buerkle. Thank you all very much. I now yield 5 minutes to the Ranking Member, Mr. Michaud. Mr. Michaud. Thank you, Madam Chair. Once again I would like to thank the four panelists for your testimony this afternoon. Colonel Morris, what would you say is the biggest difference there is between reintegration between Guard and Reserves as opposed to the Active military? Colonel Morris. Sir, I have done it both ways. Andy and I spent a lot of time talking about this. I think that the Federal soldier, sailor, airman, and marine, the Active Duty or the reservist, have the most difficult challenge. Generally they are returning to a place different than they served, and often if they are a Reservist, their unit has been pulled together from diverse geographic locations, and they are going home alone or in ones and twos. I have gone to war as a person all by myself, the Army of one, and it is not fun to come home as the Army of one. Guard units generally return as a community, out of an armory located in a community; they have built-in camaraderie and community support. I think the Guard actually has an advantage in terms of reintegration. I think the toughest organization for reintegration is the United States Marine Corps, an elite, proud group. And elite warriors across the services that are serving on Active Duty have a very tough challenge coming back. They leave a very community, they have a lot of secrets, and they come back to a public that absolutely does not understand what they have done, and they are by themselves. They have the hardest challenge, no doubt. Mr. Michaud. Thank you. Dr. Rudd, you mentioned the Pew Research Center, and part of the study had talked about--you mentioned 44 percent of the post-9/11 veterans say their readjustment to civilian life was difficult by contrast to just 25 percent of veterans who served in earlier eras. What do you distinguish--or do you know in this study why the difference? Is it because if you look at what is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan, a huge influx of Guard and Reserves, or do you think there is a distinction between Guard and Reserves in the readjustment versus Active military? Mr. Rudd. I think that is a great question. I would tell you, it is somewhat speculative, it is probably a combination of those things. I think reintegration is problematic from one perspective in that fewer and fewer Americans serve in the Armed Forces, and so fewer and fewer understand the issues that military face. I think, too, I think a larger portion of the combat mission has fallen to Guard and reservists, which makes it a little bit more difficult in terms of reintegration. The primary problem, if you look at the West, if you look at Utah as an example, one of the challenges for our Guard individuals is the dispersion after they return, that they are dispersed into relatively low populated areas, limited access to service, and limited access to one another, so that there is limited access to one another. One of the wonderful things about student veterans is that they have an opportunity to gather on a campus, they have an opportunity to identify on a campus, and that helps. And I think that that is a part of what churches do. I think that they provide an opportunity to gather, provide that critical emotional support. So I think it is probably a confluence of factors and that these have been unique wars. It is a unique time in our history, and the way that we structured the military is very much unique relative to Vietnam, relative to Korea, and relative to World War II, and as a result I think the reintegration challenges are unique. Mr. Michaud. Thank you. Dr. Wadsworth, you discussed in your testimony the structural barriers to collaboration as it pertains to the VA system. Do you find the same barriers are there dealing with the Department of Defense? Ms. Wadsworth. There certainly are some barriers. I would say that over the course of this war, DoD has really come to understand that they cannot rely on simply their own resources to meet the needs, particularly of the Reserve component, and with the closing of bases and the increased reliance on the Reserve component, they must partner with communities. I think they still are working out their models, but there are many, many examples of partnerships really permeating throughout the country. For example, an extensive partnership with the cooperative extension system, which means that DoD now has a reach into every county in the country. Mr. Michaud. My last question is for Colonel Morris. How many community organizations does Beyond the Yellow Ribbon Initiative work with? Is it pretty much throughout your State? Colonel Morris. Sir, we have 73 communities that the Governor has officially recognized as yellow-ribbon communities, dozens of corporations and different entities, faith-based organizations, that have been recognized as well. The adjutant general's plan is that every community in Minnesota that has a National Guard, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve facility will be a yellow-ribbon community. We anticipate being well over a hundred. Each community has to train every aspect of their community: faith-based, law enforcement, behavioral mental health, education and employers. So it is an extensive effort to get every community online to do what they really want to do, and that is go Beyond the Yellow Ribbon and take care of their military families and their veterans. Mr. Michaud. Great. Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Ms. Buerkle. Thank you, Mr. Michaud. I now yield to the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Runyan. Mr. Runyan. Thank you, Madam Chair. I know, Dr. Rudd just kind of answered my question in just giving the opportunity to meet and talk, but I can tell you firsthand in my district there is actually a faith-based hospital system that does a lot of the mental health for the joint base there in my district. And it has been a tremendous help because it really comes on-- especially when you talk about the West, but in my district, too, access to care is a huge part of it. And I think what the chaplain is really saying, and I want to ask you this, because that is the ultimate issue is the access, whether it is religious based or whether it is on a college campus. In the programs you run, what is that initial hurdle? What got that ball rolling to make this a community-based--to get the community involved? Because I know the community on many levels in the Guard--in dealing with the Guard is involved. But on this aspect of it, what was the one thing that got the ball rolling and allowed it to happen? Colonel Morris. Well, two things, sir. Our previous adjutant general hired me with this statement: I don't want my soldiers treated the way I was when I came home from Vietnam. Go fix that. Pretty big challenge. But what he was saying is I don't want my soldiers stigmatized by the people who sent them to war. So that put it right down at the community level. It is very obvious in Minnesota where we have a lot of trained behavioral mental health professionals, chemical dependency professionals, that anybody needing that kind of care is much more comfortable using their TRICARE benefits in their backyard, with people that they know and trust, versus traveling to a large institution that is unfamiliar to them. But helping those people understand what our peculiar set of issues might be, how to get that training, that was a challenge for us at first, because the people with that training are inside the VA. So getting them to come out and share the wealth of experience with the provider at the local level was initially a tough hurdle to overcome, and we have overcome it; and now maybe too well, because now we have a constant message of, ``You are mentally ill, you are a victim. You went to war.'' Most of us are not mentally ill, most of us were not traumatized in war. The fact of the matter is, after three combat tours, I can certify most of us were bored to death. We never saw anybody to shoot, and we never fired our weapon. We were never fired at. So we have a whole different set of issues to deal with. But we have trumpeted that issue so well that I have a steady stream of mental health providers offering me help, more than I could probably use. Good collaboration with the VA; I just don't have enough employers. That is my next hurdle. Mr. Runyan. I think we would all agree on that as we continue to--our unemployment in our men and women coming home continue to rise. And with that I yield back, Chairman. Ms. Buerkle. Thank you. Mr. Donnelly. Mr. Donnelly. Thank you, Madam Chair. This would be to Dr. Rudd and Dr. Wadsworth. When you talk about college programs and college models that you have, is there any effort being put in now to, in effect, almost putting like a college, here is a model college program together, something that can be used at IU or at TCU or at Rice or at any other schools that are out there that they can almost get a turnkey program? Mr. Rudd. I think there are. I can tell you that actually our center is leading an effort on two fronts. One on the mental health front; but also more broadly, just on student reintegration, we are actually trying to initiate forming a national consortium to do that very thing, to say here are best practices on college campuses both in terms of how you work with distressed students, but more importantly, how you work with transitioning students from their education to employment. And really trying to create community partnerships is a piece of that, so that we can help individuals find jobs and make the transition. So I would tell you that there is some effort. The other thing I would tell you is that the VA actually has been very proactive in this area. We have the Assistant Secretary for Policy and Planning is going to come visit our campus at the end of March for this very issue. We are looking at exploring how do we partner, how do we get models in place, and then how do we distribute and, most importantly, how do we do that quickly? Mr. Donnelly. Dr. Wadsworth. Ms. Wadsworth. Yes, I think the data are still not completely clear about exactly which strategies work the best, but we do know promising practices. In Indiana we have actually been working with institutions across the State, so we approached it right from the beginning at a systemic level, and we try to think about it from a life-cycle perspective: What do colleges and universities have to do to be well prepared for students when they first get there, including transfer credit; how do they best support them while they are there; and how do they ease the transition from the campus? And so we are working with systems of higher education to try to help them remove some of the structural barriers, and that is where the transfer credit issue really can come in. We also work closely with student veteran organizations who are a key element, I think, in providing a sense of home on campus where student veterans can find each other and help each other. Mr. Donnelly. Thank you very much. Dr. Morris, or Chaplain Morris, one of the areas that has continued to break everyone's hearts here is the suicide of vets, and a lot of these cases you hear afterwards say, Well, I saw one or two people, but they never really understood me. I just wonder if you have any ideas on what organizations or what people or what are the critical elements to best have someone who can understand that person when they talk to them? Colonel Morris. Sir, first of all, after Indiana beat Minnesota twice this year in basketball, I am struggling with depression. Mr. Donnelly. Well, sir, we haven't won a national championship in about 25 years, so we give it a good run ourselves. Colonel Morris. Minnesota tragically leads the Nation in terms of the National Guard in suicide, so this is an issue that has got the entire focus of our Governor, adjutant general, and all the staff. I wish I had a magic answer for you, sir. We have thrown everything against this problem that we possibly can. I think General Chiarelli, before he retired, his exhaustive report to the Army on this issue highlighted several things. We need to do a better job screening before people come into the military because we know that we have seen suicides of people who brought preexisting conditions to us. In the Minnesota Guard, most who committed suicide never had deployed. Some committed suicide prior to ever going to basic training. Something was going on in their lives before they came to us. Now, how can we all be more alert? We focus most of our effort on that. Is it the first sergeant, the first line leader, is it the company commander, is it the chaplain? We have decided to train them all down to the squad level leader. We have also decided to train families, and so we are working aggressively in all our reintegration academies to train our families in suicide prevention. That is a step we have never considered before. We are doing that full fledged. We train local clergy, we train the local behavioral mental health providers. But, again, we are cognizant that we are fearful that we are going to create a stigma against the people we are actually trying to help, that, again, we are all mentally ill, and we know we are not. We know that society has a suicide problem, not just the military, but we are owning this problem, and we are facing it head on because these are precious soldiers who we have invested so much in and want so much to retain, but we haven't found the magic bullet of the person to solve the problem. Mr. Donnelly. Well, thank you very much for your efforts on this, and obviously it is a concern to all of us because these men and women come back having served our country, and they reach out, and what you hear time after time is, ``I couldn't find anybody who really understood what I am going through.'' And so we will stay after it, but thank all of you for your help. Madam Chair, I yield back. Thank you. Ms. Buerkle. Thank you, Mr. Donnelly. I now yield to the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Reyes. Mr. Reyes. Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate the opportunity to be here. I am wondering, if we go back even to the days of the Romans, if they didn't deal with these same kinds of issues. And I say that because I came back from Vietnam after serving with some really bad guys that society had said, ``You have a choice, go to jail or go to the Army.'' And those were very good soldiers that exemplified, the bad cards that they were dealt for many different reasons. Obviously I don't know what happened to them after we came back from Vietnam. I can only use my example that having come back under the circumstances that we came back under, where we weren't received well, we each individually wrestled with the question, what I did for the past 13 months, was that worth it for these people that are ungrateful? But what got me through was my family. My family and a priest that my mom said, You know, you need to go to Father Velazquez and have him help you through this. So community and family are an important part of the healing process. But I am wondering, for those soldiers that were dealt the bad hand, that went and excelled under the most difficult circumstances anybody who has been in combat can tell you it sucks. It is the most difficult challenge you will ever face. But they did it, and they excelled. I don't know if it was because they came from the inner cities or they came from gangs, or whatever the situation was. I can tell you, they were very good soldiers that knew how to fight, and fought and distinguished themselves. So you fast-forward to today, and the situation is dramatically different. The country appreciates the all- volunteer force. I am a little bit troubled, Chaplain, by the fact that you make a statement that some of these people had issues when they joined the military. I thought we had a way of screening, because these are all volunteers in today's military. They are supported, at least in my community, 110 percent by the people of El Paso, Texas; including Fort Bliss, White Sands, and Holloman. So I am wondering, should the VA be doing some kind of research that includes either case histories or organizations or a community's role in how you embrace your soldiers? Wel send them into combat on the drop of a hat and therefore, we better be there for them when they come back with nightmares and, all the things that a lot of us experienced but got through because of our family and because of a priest or a rabbi or another religion figure. Sometimes a buddy would do help get you through an experience. So should the VA be doing some kind of comprehensive research? You know, here it is centuries after the Roman legions, and before that the Vikings. I am just thinking, if you were in combat, no matter whether it is modern or ancient, that is pretty tough stuff that you have to deal with. So anybody have any thoughts on that? Colonel Morris. Sir, Chaplain Morris. First of all, thank you for your service and welcome home. I want to tell you something about your generation, sir. Referring back to my general's challenge to me, don't let this generation be treated like me. It was pointed out to me very quickly by Vietnam veterans that despite the stigma of America, you now lead this Nation in every area of productivity; you run our universities, our hospitals; you are our political leaders; you have attained the highest offices in the land despite the stigma heaped on you. And I keep using that illustration with my young veterans: If you could attain the position you have today, despite all you went through, we should be able to go to Mars and back with all the goodwill that we have today, and all the gains we have today are because of the pain of the Vietnam veteran. So, sir, I salute you and your colleagues. Welcome back, you have done a great job. Should the VA study this issue? They are, sir. The Minneapolis VA, the RINGS 1 and RINGS 2 study will be the definitive study on the challenges of reintegration, and has within it the seeds for understanding how to successfully bring soldiers all the way back. This brigade that is in Iraq today from the Minnesota Guard is under the research of the Minneapolis VA, and I think when this longitudinal study is put together, we are going to have the answers to the questions that you raise. But I do think, sir, we have to do a better job in the all-volunteer Army screening for prior mental health issues. I intervened personally in Iraq in five cases where soldiers were suicidal. They were on medication prior to enlisting in the military, knew they couldn't enlist if they took and owned up to what they were on under the care of a psychiatrist. They stopped taking the medication, made it through basic, made it through advanced individual training, got into combat, and spiraled to become suicidal. They should have never been on the battlefield. We do not provide much screening for mental health issues other than to ask you, Do you have a history and are you taking any medication? That is a pretty low bar. So undoubtedly, I am telling you from firsthand, we have taken people in and we are taking people in who should not be in the military because of conditions that they are afflicted with. We have to do a better job on the front end if we want to see that suicide rate go down. Mr. Reyes. Thank you. Madam Chair, maybe that is something that we can pursue via a hearing at a later date, because I really do think it is important, especially if we have that sense that there are those that are coming into an all- volunteer force. Maybe we ought to find out what percentage you would think that they were. But it is something worth pursuing. Ms. Buerkle. It certainly is worth pursuing. Thank you all very much for your testimony and for answering our questions, and you are all dismissed. Thank you. I invite the third panel to the witness table. Joining us on our third panel is Reverend E. Terri LaVelle, director of the Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in the Office of the Secretary for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs; and Chaplain Michael McCoy, Sr., associate director for the National Chaplain Center for Veterans Health Administration in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Before we begin your testimonies, I would like to thank Chaplain McCoy for his service to the Navy. Reverend LaVelle, you may proceed. STATEMENTS OF REV. E. TERRI LaVELLE, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR FAITH-BASED AND NEIGHBORHOOD PARTNERSHIPS, OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS; AND CHAPLAIN MICHAEL McCOY, SR., ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL CHAPLAIN CENTER, VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS STATEMENT OF REVEREND E. TERRI LaVELLE Reverend LaVelle. Chairman Buerkle, Ranking Member Michaud, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss VA's outreach to faith- based, nonprofit community leaders and organizations to better equip them to work with our veterans, their family survivors, and caregivers. As director of the Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships since September 2009, every day I draw on my experience as a registered nurse, ordained minister, and program director to connect faith-based nonprofit and community leaders to the people, programs, and services VA offers our veterans. Our primary goal, focus, and mission is to get our veterans the help they need and deserve. The Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, along with VA colleagues from across the country, work hard to develop strong partnerships with faith-based, nonprofit and community leaders and to provide them with the information on VA services and invite them to participate in VA programs. Every day, servicemembers are returning home to stay, some after multiple deployments. After returning home--returning home can be challenging. Often I hear stories about how difficult it is for these veterans to connect with family, settle into a new routine, and find work. These challenges may seem commonplace to us, but they represent unique stresses for our veterans. Many veterans seek help and support from family, their place of worship, or their community. When they do, we at the Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships make sure these individuals are well equipped to provide information on VA's programs and services. Just as important, we make sure that every leader knows at least one VA staff person he or she can call on when working with a veteran, someone who can act as a resource and help them help the veteran in need and find useful VA programs and services. We do this by cohosting outreach events across the country to introduce faith and community leaders to the programs and services VA provides. We try to help these leaders understand how to work with VA and other partners and, in doing so, expand and enhance the ministries and programs they currently have in place that can serve veterans. For example, sometimes the only thing keeping a veteran from getting the health or mental health or benefit services he or she needs from the VA is not having a way to get to the necessary clinic or office, so an organization may want to provide transportation through their existing transportation ministry, providing each veteran with a dependable free ride. The organization can work with VA's voluntary service office, which is located at every VA medical center, to coordinate a volunteer transportation program. Volunteer services is ready with all the information the organization needs to spring into action. In addition, many faith-based organizations have counseling ministries or programs unfamiliar with the unique challenges veterans face returning home--and their families. VA chaplains and social workers will provide training to community leaders, pastors, lay leaders, and support staff to help them understand the unique needs and challenges veterans may be facing. In all of our outreach efforts, VA includes both local and regional VA staff as panelists and roundtable participants and a VA chaplain who can provide an understanding on the special needs of veterans returning from deployment. We grow our relationships with community and faith-based leaders by hosting quarterly conference calls, maintaining an informative Web site, and sending information out on a regular basis to over 1,200 Listserve members, and our Listserve is growing all the time. We know our veterans come from a variety of different backgrounds, cultures, and faith traditions and that they represent the diversity that makes up our great country, so we continue to expand our outreach by developing new relationships with diverse communities. Madam Chairwoman, I believe that, without a vision, that people perish; but under the leadership of Secretary Shinseki and the Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, our veterans will not perish. We offer a vision and a plan for preparing faith-based and community leaders with the tools they need to serve our veterans in their communities. I would also like to extend my thanks to all of my fellow panelists and our elected officials who have served in our military for your service and your sacrifice. I am now prepared to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Reverend LaVelle appears on p. 54.] Ms. Buerkle. Thank you very much, Reverend LaVelle. Chaplain McCoy, you may proceed. STATEMENT OF LIEUTENANT COMMANDER MICHAEL McCOY, SR. Lieutenant Commander McCoy. Chairwoman Buerkle and Ranking Member Michaud, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to speak about the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Chaplain Service's outreach efforts with community and faith-based organizations. As a VA chaplain over the last 21 years and a former Navy chaplain, I have found one of my greatest joys has been working with veterans and providing meaningful programs to aid them in their healing. My testimony today will cover three programs created by VA chaplains to help build bridges between VA, the faith-based communities, and neighborhood leaders to aid in the spiritual care of our returning veterans and their families. The VA National Chaplain Center started the Veterans Community Outreach Initiative to educate community clergy about the spiritual and emotional needs of our returning veterans and their families. Nationwide, VA chaplains have conducted over 200 training events and provided education to approximately 10,000 clergy through this effort. As a result, clergy across the Nation are learning to help veterans identify and cope with readjustment challenges the veterans and their families face following deployment, identify the psychological and spiritual effects of war trauma on survivors, and serve as a trusted and knowledgeable resource for veterans to use to connect with VA. Just a week ago I received a phone call from a local pastor in Virginia who had attended one of our outreach events. He said, ``I am very impressed by the passionate commitment and excellent resources available to veterans, and I need your help. Today a member of my church, whose son recently returned from deployment in Iraq, called me, hopeless, his father did, and in despair. He said the young man had just been arrested and put in jail in Richmond, Virginia. His father said his son was clearly experiencing PTSD, but he didn't know how to help him. Can you help"
