Eric Shinseki shakes hands with World War II Nisei veteran and Congressional Gold Medal recipient Lorry Nakata in Portland following a ceremonial luncheon held to pay tribute to Oregon's Japanese-American veterans.\n\nIn This Issue...\n\nNisei Soldiers Honored\n\nDirector's Message\n\nAfordable Care Act\n\nOregon Nisei Iwasaki survived racism\n\n2013 Veterans Day Events\n\nIRS Education Tax Credit Changes\n\nVeteran's Family Honored In Bend\n\nPutting Veterans Back To Work\n\nWreaths Across America Holiday Honors\n\nUnderage Military Veterans\n\nMarion County Veteran Treatment Court\n\nNisei Soldiers Honored\n\nDirector's Message\n\nCameron Smith, Oregon Department of Veterans’ Affairs\n\nAfordable Care Act\n\nDoes it affect Veteran health Benefits?\n\nOregon Nisei Iwasaki survived racism\n\nPrivate Art Iwasaki (far right) poses in front of an all-ranks club at Camp Shelby, Miss. In 1943 with other Nisei soldiers from the 442nd Regimental Combat Team before being shipped out for combat duty in Europe.\n\nThe third son of a dairy farmer in Hillsboro, Arthur Iwasaki, was part of a large all-American family. The dairy was founded in 1916 by B.Y. (Billy) Iwasaki along with his three sons George, Ike, and Art. The dairy farm would later become a vegetable farm and by the 1930s the family added bedding plants to their garden vegetable and produce business.\n\nWhen the U.S. entered World War II in December 1941, like many other Oregonians, he was ready to serve\n\n\"I knew I had to go and didn’t feel any different about entering,\" Iwasaki remembers.\n\nIn early 1942, the draft board sent Iwasaki \"greetings\" and shipped him to the Presidio in Monterey, California for induction into the Army. During ‘boot camp\" at Fort McClellan Alabama, he recalled, \"they didn’t seem to treat me any different.\"\n\nYet, the Japanese heritage he and other Nisei soldiers had concerned the Army. So much so that they sent them to Fort Thomas, Kentucky where Iwasaki and other Japanese American soldiers had their draft classification changed from 1A (available for immediate service) to 4C (Non-declarant alien). He and the others would remain at that post for approximately two years.\n\n\"We were just another prisoner, except we weren’t guarded. When President Roosevelt toured through the camps we were locked up in the motor pool and he couldn’t even see our commander-in-chief. That really bothered me, but we didn’t complain,\" Iwasaki said.\n\nIn 1943, the War Department, in dire need of manpower, reversed its policy and sent recruiters to the relocation camps asking for volunteers to form a new Japanese American combat unit, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team (RCT). Volunteers were also accepted from Hawaii where 12,500 men had volunteered.\n\nThe Nisei volunteers were combined with Japanese Americans still in the military and were sent to Camp Shelby, Mississippi for combat training. Private Iwasaki and other Nisei replacements were transferred back to Alabama to complete basic training for a second time.\n\nSome Nisei also were members of the Military Intelligence Service Civil Censorship Detachment (MIS) in the south Pacific. These Nisei servicemen were attached to other military units to provide translation, interpretation and interrogation services. They were instrumental in deciphering and translating an important captured document that described Japanese plans for a counterattack in the central Pacific.\n\nWhile the 442nd was being formed and trained, the 1,432 men of the Nisei’s 100th Battalion had entered combat in Italy on Sept. 26, 1943. Their battalion’s officers were Caucasian.\n\nWith their combat training now complete, Iwasaki and hundreds of Nisei soldiers assigned to the 100th Battalion were deployed to Europe in August 1944. They landed in Naples, Italy where they joined the newly formed 442nd RCT. Iwasaki was assigned as a radio operator with the 3rd Battalion Headquarters, I Company.\n\nTransported to Marseille, France, the regiment was directed to Epinal, France to join with the 7th Army’s 36th Division. Ordered to capture the town of Bruyeres, the 442nd fought a bitter house-to-house battle and captured more than 200 German soldiers.\n\nFighting in the Italian campaign bloodied the battalion as it suffered heavy casualties thus earning the nickname \"Purple Heart Battalion.\"\n\n\"I learned quickly how to dig a foxhole and to cover it with branches as German artillery fire was exploding in trees overhead,\" Iwasaki remembered. \"Shrapnel injured anyone below who was exposed.\"\n\n2013 Veterans Day Events\n\nClick Here For An Up To Date Statewide Veterans Day Event Guide\n\nVeterans Day discounts and specials can be found online at\n\nwww.militarybenefits.info/veterans-day-discounts-sales-deals-free-meals..\n\nIRS Education Tax Credit Changes\n\nThere have been recent changes to the tax credits for college expenses that can affect veterans taxes when using their education benefits. The American Opportunity tax credit, which expanded and renamed the already-existing Hope scholarship credit, can now be claimed in tax-years 2009 through 2017 for expenses paid for tuition, certain fees and course materials for higher education. The tax credit can also be claimed for expenses for the first four years of post-secondary education instead of just the first two.\n\nUnlike the other education tax credits, the American opportunity tax credit includes expenses for course-related books, supplies and equipment that are not necessarily paid to the educational institution with the Post 9/11 GI Bill. It also differs from the Hope scholarship credit because it allows the credit to be claimed for four years of post-secondary education instead of two.\n\nThis tax credit is worth up to $2,500 of the cost of tuition, fees and course materials paid during the taxable year. Also, 40 percent of the credit (up to $1,000) is refundable. This means veterans can get it even if they owe no taxes.\n\nIn general, qualified expenses for the education tax credits for veterans include tuition and required fees for the enrollment or attendance at an eligible post-secondary educational institution. To be creditable, the expenses paid during a taxable year must relate to: (1) an academic period that begins in the same taxable year; or (2) an academic period that begins in the first three months of the following taxable year.\n\nThe following expenses do not qualify: room and board, transportation, insurance, medical expenses, student fees unless required as a condition of enrollment or attendance, same expenses paid with tax-free educational assistance, same expenses used for any other tax deduction, credit or educational benefit.\n\nFor the American opportunity tax credit, qualified expenses have also been expanded to include expenditures for course materials, as well as tuition and required fees. The term \"course materials\" means books, supplies and equipment needed for a course of study whether or not the materials are purchased from the educational institution as a condition of enrollment or attendance.\n\nSome or all of these expenses will be recorded on Form 1098-T, Tuition Statement. The veteran should receive a Form 1098-T from the educational institution that they attended. If the veteran does not receive a Form 1098-T, they should contact the educational institution and request the form.\n\nVeterans will also be able to reduce their tax liability by one dollar for each dollar of credit for which they are eligible. If the amount of the American opportunity tax credit for which they’re eligible exceeds their tax liability, the excess will be refunded to them up to the lesser of 40 percent of the credit or $1,000.\n\nWith these new tax breaks, it is important for veterans to prepare their taxes wisely and make sure they are accurate. The IRS has an educational tax website that can assist veterans with any questions they may have concerning educational tax breaks at www.irs.gov/Credits-&-Deductions\n\nVeteran's Family Honored In Bend\n\nBrad and Helen Andre receive a state flag honoring his father's death from ODVA Director Cameron Smith.\n\nBEND -- Brad Andre is the son of a Vietnam veteran who had been missing in action for nearly 44 years. In April, the news he had been waiting for since childhood arrived.\n\nHis dad, Major Howard V. Andre, Jr., had been found.\n\nMajor Andre and his crew mate, Major James Sizemore, went missing in action in Xiangjhoang Province, Laos during the Vietnam War following an aerial combat mission in 1968. But, in April, his remains were located and soon identified.\n\nOn September 23, the Tennessee native was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery in Washington DC next to Sizemore. Brad Andre and his wife Helen attended the services. However, the night before the graveside ceremony, Brad, his sister Nancy and his son Bradley, a U.S. Naval Academy Midshipmen 1st Class, placed their POW-MIA bracelets, bearing Major Andre’s name into the casket.\n\nAt the request of Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, ODVA Director Cameron Smith presented that state’s flag, a commemorative coin and certificate of honor, plus a personal letter from the governor to Brad Andre on Oct. 12.\n\n\"I can’t imagine what it would be like to wait for more than 44 years to learn the fate of a parent who was lost during war time,\" Smith emotionally said before the presentation. With the Tennessee state flag in hand, Smith then turned, kneeled and presented the flag to the Andre’s.\n\n\"On behalf of a grateful state and nation, thank you for your father’s service,\" Smith said. \"May God bless you and your family.\"\n\nOther than to thank Smith, the state of Tennessee and the Military Officer Association of America for hosting the presentation, Brad and Helen Andre were quiet after the ceremony. \"This allows us to have closure in dad’s death. It’s still an emotional time. I’m proud of my dad’s service. I still miss him.\"\n\nAndre’s red metal bracelet had his dad’s name and rank inscribed on it plus \"USAF 7-8-69 LAOS\" to honor the date of his death during the war. Brad told the Bend Bulletin newspaper that beforehand he had no intention of ever taking the bracelet off.\n\n\"I’d worn that same bracelet for 25 years and I wasn’t going to part with it,\" he said. \"Before the funeral my thoughts were not to take it off, but it was kind of neat to do that and before I knew it I’d placed it in there. Even though it’s just symbolic, it’s closure.\"\n\nPutting Veterans Back To Work\n\nToday more than ever, there is a concentrated effort across the country to employ veterans not only at the state and federal levels, but in the private sector as well. Both corporate America and the media are embracing veterans and doing their part to support their transition into the civilian workforce.\n\nVeterans have the proven ability to learn new skills and concepts and they can enter the workforce with identifiable and transferable skills proven in real-world situations. Returning service members bring unique skills and experience to the civilian workforce. Because of their training and their work ethic, many companies report that veterans make excellent employees, with a higher rate of retention.\n\nThe first ever national televised show, \"Hiring America\" is dedicated to jobs and career direction for returning U.S. military veterans, is now being aired across the nation. It is hosted by television news reporter Gigi Stone from Good Morning America and ABC News.\n\nThe purpose of the show is to connect U.S. veterans to businesses and organizations that have a focused initiative on hiring military men and women. The show’s format connects vets to employers and CEO’s of companies while also providing great insight and education from some of the top leaders in the country. The show can be currently seen on the Pentagon Network or by going to www.hiringamerica.net.\n\nFederal agencies are also making hiring veterans a priority after the VOW Act of 2011. In one area of the act there is a mandate that requires all federal agencies to have 10 percent of their employees to be veterans by 2014. Each of these agencies have designated a point of contact that is responsible for making sure this mandate is met within their agency. By visiting www.fedshirevets.gov you can connect which each one of these individuals for employment opportunities within their agency.\n\nIn Oregon, veterans can contact the Oregon Employment Department’s veteran representatives (DVOP) who specialize in removing hurdles they may have with finding employment. Vet Reps are highly trained individuals that can assist in a number of different areas to get veterans job ready and connected to employers. To connect with any DVOP, visit your local Oregon Worksource center or\n\ngo to www.worksourceoregon.org/veterans\n\nBusinesses in Oregon have also partnered with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in participating in the \"Hiring Our Heroes\" job fairs that have been taking place all over the state. These veteran only events are a unique environment where employers that are hiring connect with veterans one on one.\n\nPhil Maas, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Northwest manager, said, \"The Hiring our Heroes events in Oregon have been a great success. It is a culmination of working with multiple entities in each community and focusing all our efforts on getting veterans hired. Businesses in Oregon have also stepped up to the plate in supporting the events and making a commitment to make veterans part of their own workforce.\"\n\nBusinesses such as Cambia, Home Depot, Safeway, Intel, and Platt Electric have made it a priority to support this initiative. The result has been great connections, often leading to job offers and meaningful employment.\n\nVisitwww.hiringourheroes.org to find out more information about Hiring Our Heroes and the next event in your area.\n\nWreaths Across America Holiday Honors\n\nClick to edit this placeholder text.\n\nCivil Air Patrol Cadets from the Medford Composite Squadron in Medford Oregon render salutes to at the annual Wreaths Across America event held at Eagle Point National Cemetery in December of 2012.\n\nBringing a sense of remembrance and respect by placing holiday wreaths on the graves of fallen military service members in national and local cemeteries throughout the United States is the mission of Wreaths Across America (WAA).\n\nA national nonprofit organization founded in 2007, WAA’s mission is carried out by coordinating wreath-laying ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery, as well as veterans’ cemeteries and other locations. The organization has since expanded to include more than 1,000 local volunteer groups in all 50 states representing more than 800 cemeteries, military memorials and other state government locations.\n\nIn 2008, and each year since, the U.S. Congress has issued a proclamation in December to officially recognize \"Wreaths Across America Day.\" This year, Sat., Dec. 14, is the recognized day.\n\nMany Oregon volunteers and organizations have been involved with WAA’s holiday initiative since it started in 2007. Volunteers include members of the Oregon Civil Air Patrol, Gold Star Wives Willamette Valley Chapter, Oregon Young Marines, Old Guard Riders, Virgil T. Golden Funeral Services, Rogue Valley Veterans and Community Outreach, and Oregon Boy Scout Troop 870.\n\nThis year there are 10 Oregon cemeteries where wreath laying events will take place: Centennial Park, La Pine, Deschutes Memorial Gardens, Bend, Eagle Point National Cemetery, Eagle Point, Hawthorne Memorial Gardens Grants Pass, Hillcrest Memorial Park, Grants Pass, Lane Memorial Gardens, Eugene, Roseburg National Cemetery, Roseburg, Springfield Memorial Gardens, Springfield, West Lawn Memorial Park, Eugene, and Willamette National Cemetery, Portland.\n\nLast year more than 400,000 wreaths were placed at 815 locations across the country. More than 1,200 of those wreaths were laid on the graves of Oregon veterans.\n\nWreaths Across America also conducts several programs to honor our veterans, including our popular \"Thanks a Million\" campaign, which distributes thank you cards to people all over the country to share with veterans a simple \"thank you\" for their service.\n\nIf you would like to get involved with this year’s events, go to the WAA national website,\n\nwww.wreathsacrossamerica.org\n\nand connect directly with the point of contact for each of the scheduled events in Oregon.\n\nThe Oregon Department of Veterans’ Affairs will be holding a state capital wreath laying ceremony December 9, beginning at 11:30 a.m., at the Capital Medal of Honor Memorials in Salem. For more information please contact Marc Huchette at ODVA at 503-332-0587.\n\nUnderage Military Veterans\n\nPvt. Willie L. Paradise, age 16 Pvt. Frank Buckles, age 16\n\nJoining the military before the age of consent was once almost commonplace, especially during World War II. Those under the age of 18 would lie or get their parents to verify they were either 18 or give their approval for their son to join.\n\nIt has been recorded that many of these underage volunteers were around 16 when they joined and some were as young as 13. As the decades went by, many of these veterans discovered one another. Many joined the ranks of Veterans of Underage Military Service (VUMS) after learning they were free from prosecution for lying about their underage service.\n\nA Coast Guard retiree, Allan Stover, founded the VUMS in 1991. Since then, more than 2,800 veterans have joined.\n\nOregon veteran and VUMS member Willie Paradise joined the National Guard in 1955 at age 16. \"Not all of our members lied about their age. One guy thought he was old enough because his brother said so,\" Paradise said.\n\n\"If you are one of that rare breed, a kid that enlisted underage, you should be very proud,\" Paradise added. \"We once kept it a secret, but now we strongly proclaim it as a badge of honor. VUMS members are living history and their legacy won’t ever be repeated. We are losing members all the time.\"\n\nThis year, VUMS’s oldest member, who had family in Oregon, joined the military at age 16. When Frank Buckles passed away in Feb. 2011, at age 110 he reportedly was the last World War I veteran in the U.S. During World War II, Buckles was captured by Japanese forces while working in the shipping business, and spent three years in the Philippines as a civilian prisoner.\n\nThe late Jeremy Michael Boorda, joined the Navy at age of 15.He was a product of an enlisted-to-officer commissioning program in the early 1960s. During his career he went from seaman recruit to admiral. In 1993, he became the Commander in Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe and at age 56, in 1994, he was assigned as the 25th Chief of Naval Operations.\n\nJacklyn Lucas joined at 14 and earned the Medal of Honor five days before his 17th birthday. He was the youngest to earn the medal since the Civil War. Jack Vessey joined the National Guard at 16, rose to the rank of general and served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n\"Too Young the Hero\" is a movie about Calvin Leon Graham’s life story. He was 12 years old when he enlisted, was a VUMS member and was played by Rick Schroeder in the movie. Also, five books have been published with short autobiographical stories by VUMS members.\n\nParadise said VUMS needs help locating veterans throughout the U.S. who are not aware of this unique organization and may be interested in joining the group. VUMS meets in Portland on the first Friday each month for lunch at Gregg’s Backyard Grill, 3554 S.E. 82nd Ave., at 10:30 a.m.\n\nFor more information: www.oldvums.org\n\nor contact Paradise at paradisewp@juno.com or 503-665-1739.\n\nMarion County Veteran Treatment Court\n\nMarion County Sheriff Jeff Meyers (left), Marion County Analyst Allycia Weathers (center left), Marion County Circuit Judge Vance Day (center right), and Marion County Sheriff Commander Kevin Schultz received the Federal Grant by the Bureau of Justice Assistance grant money funding the Marion County Veterans’ Treatment Court (VTC).\n\nSALEM – Criminal justice involvement and incarceration among American military veterans have long been a national concern. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, about 10 percent of prison inmates are veterans, of which a majority served during a time of war.\n\nIn support of veterans within the justice system in Oregon, the Marion County Veterans Treatment Court (VTC) has been awarded a $348,435 Federal Grant by the Bureau of Justice Assistance.\n\nThe award was made following an extensive and competitive application process. Marion County Circuit Judge Vance Day said this is directly attributable to the partnership between the Circuit Court, District Attorney’s office, Sheriff’s Office, the Oregon Department of Veterans’ Affairs (ODVA), various community agencies and veteran peer volunteers.\n\nVeterans Treatment Courts use various partners at the local, state and federal level to reducing repeat offenders and prioritizes treatment over incarceration. These courts allow the community to respond with the intervention, rather than punishment to bring wellness to the veteran defendant.\n\nNationwide, the incarceration rate of veterans (630 per 100,000) is less than half that of nonveterans (1,390 per 100,000).\n\nThat circumstance may be explained largely by age, given that in the general population, veterans are considerably older than nonveterans. A report by U.S. Department of Justice also indicated that like the veteran population as a whole, a majority of incarcerated veterans served during a wartime period and may have mental health issues that contributed to their offense.\n\nODVA Director Cameron Smith said the new VTC is a solid program, but is not a get out of jail free card.\n\n\"These participating veterans must admit guilt and participate in a rigorous program of treatment and community service,\" Smith said. \"There is close judicial supervision of the veteran’s compliance and progress which brings about a higher level of accountability by the veteran and helps to assure their participation in rated VA and Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) services and benefits.\"\n\nTo be considered for the VTC, a veteran must be diagnosed with a treatable substance abuse and/or mental health disorder. Admission decisions are made by a treatment team review incorporating prosecution, defense, probation and VA treatment personnel recommendations.\n\nMarion County’s VTC held its first hearing in Salem on Oct. 26, 2012, in Judge Day’s courtroom.\n\n\"This grant will help us to get to the next level of effective intervention in the lives of our service men and women who, because of their experience in the military, develop challenges which unfortunately end up being addressed by the criminal justice system,\" Day said.\n\nThe Bureau of Justice Assistance grant will be disbursed over the next three years through Marion County and will be used to partially staff the court, train personnel, and assist the veteran participants.\n\nTo learn more about Marion County’s Veterans Treatment Court, call Elan Lambert, 503-999-9358."
