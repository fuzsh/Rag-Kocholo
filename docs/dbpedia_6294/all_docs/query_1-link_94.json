        "text": "The medals of the next Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024 have been unveiled! Whether they are gold, silver or bronze, they will all contain a very special piece of metal that was once part of the Eiffel Tower. Cut into a hexagon, the geometric shape evokes France to the point of becoming its nickname. Also on the same side, thin lines are projected at irregular intervals all around the iron hexagon. Struck rather than engraved, these rays bring relief and shine to a medal that is far from smooth. More information here https://lnkd.in/eRZn98tR Following this announcement, let’s have a look at the medals of the previous editions, thanks to our OSC Reference Document on Olympic Summer Games medals. Available on the Olympic World Library here https://lnkd.in/eRaBMEbv, you will discover each medal, illustrated by a photo of its obverse and reverse, and with a description of the design and the technical details. This document is part of our OSC Reference Collection, accessible here https://lnkd.in/eQ5mkNqV.

The most remarkable moment came during the 400m individual medley final, where the crowd erupted in cheers for every stroke of his competition as he shattered the world record, leaving a lasting mark in Olympic history. Leon’s achievements didn’t just bring home medals—they galvanized the entire nation of #France. His remarkable performances united the country in pride and celebration, reminding us all of the power of sports to bring people together. #Sports have a unique power to unite people across the world, #transcending borders, #cultures, and differences. #Athletes from different nations come together not just to compete, but to showcase the best of #humanity— such as resilience, determination, and, above all, sportsmanship. Despite a world too often divided by various challenges such as geopolitics, sport politics, egocentrism, narcissism, sports stand as an example of how competition can coexist with friendship and unity. At the end of the day, you need your fellow human to compete, don’t you? And it is in sports that the world plays for a better, more connected world. #Sportsmanship #UnityInSports #GlobalCommunity #Camaraderie\n\nI Bet You Didn’t Know: The Olympics - I Bet You Didn’t Know winners in the ancient Olympics received free meals, free pass to the Colosseum and Wreath Bouquets. -I Bet You Didn’t Know in 393, AD Roman Emperor Theodosius banned the Olympics because he felt it encouraged paganism. - I Bet You Didn’t Know for the 1924 games Paris created the first Olympic Village.

These Games were the first to award the traditional gold, silver, and bronze medals to the top three finishers in each event. The gold medals presented at these Games consisted of solid gold, as the metal was cheaper to obtain prior to World War I. The 1908 London and 1912 Olympic Games also utilized solid gold medals, however, these were the last ones to do so. 2. The iron hexagon is made of a piece of Eiffel tower 3. Olympic gold medal is estimated at $1,027. And it's made of....1% Gold! But that makes sense, because if it was completely made of gold it would cost over $44k in raw materials. 4. On the backside that's the view from the Panathenaic stadium in Greece, the acropolis is in the right place but on the right the lykavitos hill has been replaced by the Eiffel Tower.\n\n（*TODAY*）* France vs Fiji LIVE STREA.Ms Rugby Bronze medal Game ON TV Channel 27 July 2024 Watch Now: https://t.ly/ywf_7 Watch Now: https://t.ly/ywf_7 Where can I find the full schedule for the 2024 Paris Olympics?

Day 2 of #WC2WB kicked off today with a panel conversation unpacking what it means and what it takes to win well. Paralympic athletes Vanessa Low OAM and Angie Ballard talked about the importance of knowing athletes individually, finding ways for each athlete to be at there best when it matters most. The pursuit of “winning well” in a Paralympic context [and arguably every context with the aim of optimising human performance] requires understanding the person, their impairment and unique needs for unlocking performance. A few takeaways on how to go the distance in pursuit of excellence in sport: ✅Value people beyond their performance. ✅ Keep the bigger plan in mind ✅ There is always something that can be done to improve. Keep moving forward. ✅The joy of sport is in the here and now. Don’t just look at the results. Enjoy the process. Paralympics Australia Australian Sports Commission #highperformance #paris2024"
