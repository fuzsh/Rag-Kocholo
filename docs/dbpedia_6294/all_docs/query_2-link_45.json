        "text": "Images: Triathlete (FR) Aout 1995\n\nI’m guessing you know by now that I’m a huge France Iron Tour nerd. I’ve already done podcasts about the 1993 and 1994 editions.\n\nSo here’s a preview of the 1995 race. It’s a quick translation of the article above. They call the 1995 race the 2nd edition of the FIT. Because 1993 was technically just a 2 day trial race. To test the concept a bit before a full launch the following year.\n\nThe main body of the article is an interview with Carole Gally. The FIT co-founder and organiser. Here we go!\n\nHeadline. Coming Soon To Your TV Screen.\n\nSubheading: On the eve of the second edition the FIT is hoping to get its second wind. Carole Gally explains it all.\n\nCarole. Explain how and why you had the idea to create the FIT.\n\nThe story starts in 1990. When I met Jean-Luc Capogna. He had the idea to organise a triathlon tour like cycling’s Tour de France.\n\nOf course. We had no pretensions to make the event as big as the Tour de France. Our goal was just to get more people. And the media. Interested in the sport of triathlon.\n\nSimilarly. There was never any question of creating a gruelling endurance test. Rather the length of stages would be based on the Olympic Distance. To show competitive, high speed racing.\n\nWe then got some hands-on organising experience by starting triathlons in Grenoble and Alpe d’Huez. The idea was of course to eventually send a triathlon up the famous Tour de France mountain. Note. The 1992 Triathlon International de Grenoble was the first race to do this.\n\nLast year (1994) when we felt ready. We launched the FIT. We decided on 4 stages in 5 days. We didn’t think we needed to, even if it might be a long term goal, to design an actual tour of France. This year we have 6 stages in 8 days. Next year it will be something like 12 stages in 15 days.\n\nYou do however want to create a Tour de France alter-ego?\n\nAbsolutely. But a triathlon one.\n\nHow long did it take to get the FIT up and running? For Example. To plan race courses and get permission from local authorities.\n\nA full year. We started by negotiating with towns. Presenting what would be expected of them as potential stage venues. In terms of both the race and the financial commitment. We prioritised towns that already had some experience with hosting triathlons.\n\nOnce we’d come to an agreement with a town we then met two or three times before the event. From October to March we worked on finding sponsors. Only then did we begin planning the technical aspects of the tour.\n\nHow many people are involved in putting on the event?\n\nWe have 3 full-time employees. Carole Bertrand. Lucie Badoil. And me. But we also organise the Dauphine Libere 10 km in Grenoble.\n\nIn terms of the FIT we can also count on 60 or so volunteers from the team that puts on the TIGRE. Or the Triathlon International de Grenoble. They can act as local project managers or race directors.\n\nWhat do you expect this year in terms of media coverage and public awareness?\n\nWe have an agreement with the TV stations France 2 and France 3 to televise Stage 1 in Strasbourg on the 20th August. Then there’ll be a daily stage summary on the programme Tout Le Sport at 8PM every evening.\n\nOn Saturday 26th August Samedi Passion will also show a look-back at the first 5 stages. And on Sunday Sport Dimanche and Stade 2 (France’s most famous sports show) will show highlights of the final stage.\n\nWe can also count on the radio stations France Info and Radio France to cover the race. As well as local and national newspapers.\n\nSubheading: Marceau Absent\n\nThis year two big French clubs won’t be taking part. Poissy and Le Racing. Does this worry you?\n\nI can’t say it doesn’t. Concerning Le Racing. They told me they have financial problems. Poissy however was concerned that 3 of their best athletes would be involved in the World Military Championships. They therefore don’t want to do the FIT just to make up the numbers.\n\nIf Poissy toes the line it's with a strong team. Not only are they interested in the image of the club but doing the FIT is also an expensive undertaking. About 100,000FF (€15,000). If Olivier Marceau and Serge Lecrique were available. That would change everything. For them. But unfortunately they’re not.\n\nIs La Coupe De France Des Clubs on 17th September a little close to the FIT to allow clubs to field their best teams in both events?\n\nNo. The reason Poissy is not coming is because they can’t bring Marceau. The calendar has nothing to do with it.\n\nThe FIT now has a solid budget. What is still needed to make an even bigger impact in the sport of triathlon?\n\nCorrect.\n\nWe have a total of 800,000FF (€120,000) available and a Peugeot 806 as first prize. I think we need a few more years of experience and ironing out small problems. As well as a tour that covers more of the country.\n\nI think in terms of media coverage and attracting the best athletes. We’re already doing a great job. The FIT just needs a bit more time to mature.\n\nBack to me now. Ross. So where and when were the six stages?\n\nStage One took place in Strasbourg (my old home town) on Sunday 20th August 1995. It was an Olympic Distance race that started at 11:00.\n\nThe two-lap swim was in a lake called the Bagersee. About 5km from the town centre. The bike was a flat two-laps to the town centre and back.\n\nAnd the run was 3 laps in the lake-side and in the forest next to baggersee. I think the finish was on the beach.\n\nStage Two was in Besancon on Monday 21st August 1995. Besancon. By the way. Is 250 km from Strasbourg. The Sprint Distance race was planned to start at 18:15. So giving time for the teams to make the drive south.\n\nThe swim was 750m downstream in the fast-flowing Doubs river. The bike was 3 laps with the pretty-tough climb of La Voselle on each lap. And the run was two laps along the river and through town.\n\nThe race moved to Vichy for Stage Three on Wednesday 23rd August 1995. Therefore the athletes had a rest day on Tuesday. To train, to chill and to make the 300 km drive from Besancon.\n\nNote. Vichy hosted Stage One of the 1994 FIT.\n\nAgain. The format was a Team Time Trial. Swim together. Bike together. As much as possible. To maximise drafting and speed.\n\nThe clock is stopped when the first three athletes from a team cross the line. Race start was at 15:00 and the distances were 900m / 24 km / 5.6 km. With teams leaving every 45 seconds.\n\nStage Four was an Olympic Distance triathlon in St. Etienne on Thursday 24th August 1995. With the race start planned for 15:00.\n\nThe swim was at the Saint Victor Dam. 12 km from St. Etienne town centre. The bike was then 2 laps between Saint Victor and the village of Roche La Moliere. And was described in the preview as vallonee. Or rolling. The run was 3 laps back at Saint Victor. Around the Base Nautique and the village.\n\nNow let's look at Stage Five. 150 km away from St. Etienne. In Grenoble. Again. A town that had a stage in 1994. A sprint triathlon starting at 19:00 in the evening was planned.\n\nThe swim was again supposed to take place in the Isere river. Listen to TSP8 to hear Scott Molina talking about how fast the flow was. In fact, the race preview even states that the river has strong currents.\n\nHowever, there was a big change to this stage due to the river conditions. More details when I go through the race in a future podcast.\n\nThe bike was due to be two laps. With therefore 2 laps of Le Col de Vence. Which is a pretty steep, semi-urban climb. With a tight, technical descent. Then a two lap river-side run.\n\nThe final stage. Stage Six. Starting at 10:45 on Sunday 27th August. So the athletes had another rest day between stages 5 and 6. Although it was only a 50km drive between Grenoble and the race start in Vaujany.\n\nThe race was another Olympic Distance race from the EDF Lac Du Verney to the top of Alpe D’Huez. Which is listed as 1100m of positive denivele. The pre-race guide says the swim was 500m. But I think that’s a typo. The run was again 2 laps in and around the village at 1850m of altitude.\n\nI’m pretty sure it was the same route as the 4th and final stage in 1994. However, in 1994, if you remember, they used a time trial start based on general classification times after the first 3 stages.\n\nSo. Who planned to take part? Let’s take a look at the teams together.\n\nNote. There were changes. Which I’ll go through in the race reports and results in that future episode. Here’s the 10 teams.\n\nSt. Quentin en Yvelines.

That will be worn by the leaders of the various classifications everyday.\n\nThere are 9. Too many? We’ll find out when we deep-dive into the race reports and results. In fact, they’re not really jerseys like those awarded in cycling. They’re triathlon crop tops. That we all wore back then.\n\nSNCF Iron Jersey. Overall GC leader.\n\nArena Blue Jersey. Swim leader.\n\nMavic White Jersey. Best cyclist.\n\nGeant Supermarkets Red Jersey. Best runner.\n\nTricolore Jersey. Highest French athlete on GC.\n\nHertz Yellow and Black Jersey. Best daily GC progression..\n\nMaillot Etape. Daily stage winner.\n\nGreen Jersey. Hot spots leader.\n\nBlack Jersey. Leading team.\n\nI’m still planning to do one of the Iron Tour routes as a bike trip. Probably in the summer of 2025. Riding between stage towns. Not driving like the athletes did. And also re-creating the stages.\n\nI’ve already punched the 1994 and 1995 routes into google maps to see how much riding would be involved with the stages and the transfers. The 1994 tour would be about 500 km. And this 1995 one is nearer 1100 km.\n\nNote also for 1995 there was still no women’s FIT planned.\n\nLinks:"
