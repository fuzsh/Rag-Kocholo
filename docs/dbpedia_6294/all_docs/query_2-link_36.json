        "text": "1960 meeting of the INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE, JUDO was accepted as a demonstration sport for the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympic Games.\n\nFor READING\n\nEssen, Hans van, “2004 Olympic Games Judo”, Nieuwegein, Netherlands, Infostgrada sport, 2004, 294p, LIB\n\nSoames, Nicolas: Inman, Roy, “Olympic judo: history and techniques”, Aylesbury, United Kingdom, Crowood, 1990, 253p, ISBN 185223489.\n\nKoizumi, Gunji. (1947, April) Judo and the Olympic games. Budokwai Quarterly Bulletin (pp. 7-8).\n\nPRE-HISTORY of Olympic Judo by T. Plavecz\n\nJudo was created in 1882 by Jigaro Kano, who later became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Prior to 1964, it had never been on the Olympic Program. Kano made some tentative inquiries about adding judo to the program in 1928, but realized the sport was not practiced in a sufficient number of countries, and that attempt went nowhere. The International Judo Federation (IJF) was formed in 1949, but judo was not yet close to an Olympic sport, although World Championships began in 1956. In 1955, Charles Palmer (GBR), later to be president of IJF, attended the Congress of the European Judo Union and discovered that the European nations had been pressing the IOC to include judo for several years. The request was denied because the IOC did not feel that the event could be fair without weight categories, and the judo authorities had always preferred to hold only one, open class.\n\nIn 1958, Tokyo was awarded the 1964 Olympic Games. The Japanese judo authorities sent a formal request to the IOC to include judo in the program of the 1964 Olympic Games. At the 1960 IOC Session in Roma, judo was approved for the 1964 Olympic Program, although only as an “optional sport,” at the discretion of the host nation. This was not understood at the time by the judo community.\n\nThe weight class question was decided in favor of weight classes. They had been held at the United States’ championships since the early 1950s and the European Championships made them standard in 1957. The Japanese had opposed weight categories but in 1962, [Anton Geesink] of the Netherlands won the World Championship in the open class in a dominating manner. The Japanese were now concerned that if only an open class were contested, they would be left with no judo titles, which was unthinkable to them. It was elected to use the European standard of a lightweight (<68 kg.), middleweight (<80 kg.) and heavyweight class (>80 kg.). Britain, France and Belgium pushed for the inclusion of an open class, and this became the fourth category.\n\nThe final question was professionalism. Many judo competitors spent time teaching the sport as well, which was not allowed by the amateur code in 1964. This was even true of Geesink. In Japan, some judo administrators lobbied to ban Geesink, reasoning that although some Japanese would also be affected, second-line Japanese judo players could likely beat the rest of the amateur world. It was eventually settled that the amateur status of the judo competitors was declared by the various NOCs, and the Netherlands declared that Geesink followed the rules of amateur status. Interestingly, Geesink attempted to compete in the 1960 Olympics in wrestling but the Dutch NOC removed him from the team because he was teaching judo in France.\n\nAfter the success of the 1964 Olympic judo events, the judo world expected that judo would continue on the Olympic Program, but such was not the case. The sport had been admitted to the 1964 Olympic Program only as an optional sport, and in 1966, when the program for the Mexico City Olympics was announced, judo was not on it. Charles Palmer of Britain had been elected president of the International Judo Federation in 1965, and he began to lobby the IOC to change the ruling eliminating judo. He was told that the IOC had given the Organizing Committee discretion to choose 18 of the 21 Olympic sports, and they did not choose judo. In 1967, Palmer met with the General Assembly of International Sports Federations (GAISF) and the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC), who both supported the inclusion of judo on the 1968 program. He then met with the IOC Executive Board and made a presentation. But Lord Burghley, IOC Vice-President interrupted and told Palmer that his presentation was a “waste of time.” He said that the _Olympic Charter_ stated that the program could not be changed after the invitations had been sent out, and then added, “I sent them out this morning.” And thus, no judo was contested at the 1968 Olympics.\n\nThere were some changes since the 1964 Olympics. The program was expanded to six divisions – five weight classes and an open category. The format for each class was changed to a now standard one – two single-elimination pools, with those losing to the winner of each pool participating in repêchage pools, to advance four to semi-finals and finals. The judo rules had been changed as well, with greater penalties against passivity now in place. The athletes were different as well, becoming more muscular and adopting the Western style of strength moves, rather than the Japanese skillful techniques. And the Japanese were no longer considered unbeatable, as in 1964. Finally, the length of the matches was shortened. Preliminary round matches lasted six minutes, semi-finals eight minutes, and the finals 10 minutes.\n\nOlympic Judo Years\n\n1964 – (men Only)\n\n1968 – (none)\n\n1972 – (men Only)\n\n1976 – (men Only)\n\n1980 – (men Only)\n\n1984 – (men Only)\n\n1988 – (men Only, with women’s as a demonstration only)\n\n1992 – (Men and Women)\n\n1996 – (Men and Women)\n\n2000 – (Men and Women)\n\n2004 – (Men and Women)\n\n2008 – (Men and Women)\n\n2012 – (Men and Women)\n\n2016 – (Men and Women)\n\nWEIGHT CATEGORIES\n\nWeight divisions\n\nMen\n\nUnder 60 kg\n\n60–66 kg\n\n66–73 kg\n\n73–81 kg\n\n81–90 kg\n\n90–100 kg\n\nOver 100 kg\n\nWomen\n\nUnder 48 kg\n\n48–52 kg\n\n52–57 kg\n\n57–63 kg\n\n63–70 kg\n\n70–78 kg\n\nOver 78 kg\n\nThey were introduced for the OLYMPIC GAMES in 1964. Until then World Championships were open to all weights in one category, but starting with the Tokyo Olympics 3 weight categories (-68kg, -80kg, +80kg) were introduced in addition to the open category The categories (classes) were expanded to 6 for the 1972 Olympics, and 8 for the 1980 Olympics. In 1992 the open weight category was dropped from the Olympics so there are currently 7 weight categories for both men and women in the Olympics. In 1998 the weight classes were changed to the following: female categories are: up to 48kg, 52kg, 57kg 63kg 70kg, 78kg, and above 78kg ; male categories are: up to 60kg, 66kg, 73kg, 81kg, 90kg, 100kg, and above 100kg. Until the 1984 D.G in Los Angeles (inclusive) there was an 8th, all-weight category. The one also 5 team categories: up to 52kg, 57kg, 63kg, 70kg and above 70kg (women) and up to 66kg, 73kg, 81kg, 90kg, and above 90kg (men).\n\nFor READING\n\nGlass, George, “Competitive Judo: Throwing Techniques and weight control, London, United Kingdom, Faber and Faber, 1977, 93p.\n\n1964 OLYMPIC GAMES\n\nTOKIO, JAPAN\n\nOKT. 20-23\n\nGeneral\n\nThe first time the Games had been staged in Asia, the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo represented the rehabilitation of Japan after the second world war.

More than 5,100 athletes from 93 nations competed, with greater representation from Africa and Asia than ever before, but the USA were still the most successful nation in Tokyo.\n\nA. Geesink won the final\n\nJudo\n\nAt the first Olympic Judo event in Tokyo there were 74 participants from 27 countries.The 1964 judo events took place in the Nippon Budokan – the Japanese Military Arts Hall. The matches were held on a traditional Japanese tatami, set in the center of the stadium. Preliminary round matches lasted 10 minutes, and the finals were 15 minutes. Most of the competitors had spent at least some time training in Japan. The exception was the Soviet team, which brought athletes who had converted to judo from the traditional Soviet jacket wrestling sport of sambo. In each class, the athletes were separated into various round-robin pools. The winner of each pool qualified for the knock-out round, or effectively quarter-finals.

GEESINK’s victory was a shoking blow to the Japanese, even he was two-time world champion and the clear favorite. Kaminaga set an Olympic speed record that would last for 28 years when he threw his opponent of the Philippines in four seconds. Geesink, the Giant from Utrech had become the first non-Japanese to win a world championship. Kaminaga was probably better technically but Geesink was a superb athlete. Geesink won his semifinal fight with Boronovskis in only 12 seconds.\n\nFor Reading:\n\nhttp://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ka/akio-kaminaga-1.html\n\n1968 OLYMPIC GAMES\n\nMEXICO CITY, MEXIKO\n\nNo Judo Event\n\nPolitics kept judo out of this Games. Judo was accepted as a \"full\" sport for men in the 1972 Munich Olympics.Charles Palmer (1930-2001) /and the IJF/ worked hard to get judo included in the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Sir Charles succeeded and judo (for men) was made a permanent part of the Olympic Games.\n\nFor Reading:\n\nCharles Palmer\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20060818062543/http://www.britishjudo.org.uk:80/home/palmer_hall_of_fame.php\n\n1972 OLYMPIC GAMES\n\nMUNICH, GERMANY\n\nAUG. 31-SEP. 5\n\nGeneral\n\nThe Munich Olympic Games will be forever associated with tragedy. True they surpassed all previous Games in terms of scale - 7134 athletes from a staggering 121 nations took part in 195 events, but ten days into this festival of sport, on the early hours of September 5, eight Palestinian terrorists belonging from the Black September group entered the Olympic Village, killed two members of the Israeli team and took nine more hostage. During a failed rescue attempt at the military airport of Fürstenfeldbruck, all nine the Israeli hostages, a German police officer, and all but three of the terrorists were killed. The Munich Massacre was undoubtedly the blackest day in Olympic history.\n\nThe Games were suspended and a memorial service was held in the main stadium. But 34 hours later, the International Olympic Committee ordered the competitions to resume as a mark of defiance to the terrorists.\n\nJudo\n\nIn 1968 there was no Judo event, but in 1972 the event was expanded to 6 men's weight classes as follows: Lightweight (-63 kg/-139 lbs), Half-Middleweight (-70 kg/-154 lbs), Middleweight (-80 kg/-176 lbs), Half-Heavyweight (-93 kg/-205 lbs), Heavyweight (Over 93 kg/205 lbs), and Openweight.\n\nJapan had the two most recent World Champions in this class, but instead chose Toyokazu NOMURA, who had won two silver medals at the Worlds in the half-lightweight division.\n\nHis five matches had lasted a total of 10:49. Two-time Japanese world champion Fumio Sasahara , was unexpectedly thrown and defeated by 22-year old Shota CHOCHOSHVILI\n\nof Tbilisi, Georgia.\n\nMEN\n\nLIGHTWEIGHT\n\n(63 kg-139 lbs)\n\nFINAL MATCH\n\n1.

Organisers greatly under-estimated the cost of hosting the Games, with budgets expanding to four times initial estimates. In addition, 24 countries boycotted Montreal, including 22 African nations who opposed New Zealand’s presence at the Games after the All Blacks rugby tour of South Africa during the Apartheid era. Nearly 1000 fewer athletes competed in Montreal than did in Munich four years earlier.\n\nThe Soviet Union finished as the most successful nation at the Montreal Games, winning 49 gold medals, followed by the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) with nine fewer, and the United States third - the first time an American team had not finished in the top two nations.\n\nJudo\n\nAt Montreal Dave STARBROOK won a bronze medal for the UK (under 93 Kg), which was his second Olympic win. Allen COAGE also won a bronze medal (over 93 Kg) for United States. Keith Remfrey was only beaten by Haruki Uemura of Japan. In Open Category he won a silver medal. NINOMIYA (half-heavyweight), who won three of his four preliminary fights in one minute or less, had to lose more than 25 pounds to make the weight limit. In 1974, Angelo Parisi married a French woman and relocated to the other side of the Channel. He was unable to compete at 1976 Games in Montreal as he was still in the process of becoming a French citizen.\n\nMEN\n\nLIGHTWEIGHT\n\n(63 kg-139 lbs) FINAL MATCH\n\n1.

Only 80 nations took part in the 1980 Games.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Soviet Union dominated the medals. The hosts won 87 gold medals, the East Germany claimed 47, and Bulgaria eight. Excluding the East Germans, Soviet athletes won more gold medals than the combined totals of the other 78 competing teams. Despite the absence of the sporting powers USA, Germany and Japan, there was superb athletic competition, with British athletes to the fore.\n\nJudo\n\nThe JUDO competition at the OLYMPIC GAMES was the first time that the medal count was not dominated by Japan as the country joined the boycott of the games because of the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Medals were awarded to male judoka in eight competitions, seven WEIGHT CATEGORIES (Extra Lightweight (-60 kg), Half Lightweight (-65 Kg), Lightweight (-71Kg), Half-Middleweight (-78 kg), Middleweight (-86 kg), Half-Heavyweight (-95 kg), Heavyweight (Over 95 kg),and the open competition — two more than in 1976. All events were held at the Palace of Sports of the Central Lenin Stadium at Luzhniki (south western part of Moscow). Arthur Mapp won a bronze, and Neil ADAMS won a silver medal for UK. He needed less than four minutes to defeat his first three opponents, but in the final he lost. A 21-year old Italian, Ezio GAMBA won. He was the only Italian judoka to resist the anti-Soviet boycott. He traveled to Moscow on his own. Angelo PARISI (heavy-weight) was born in Italy, and he was a former member of the British team who married a French woman and changed citizenship. There were – because of anti-Soviet boycott – no two great Japanese world champion, Sumio ENDO and Yasuhiro YAMASHITA.\n\nEXTRA-LIGHTWEIGHT\n\n(60 kg –132.25 lbs)\n\nFINAL MATCH\n\n1.

With less than a minute to go, Parisi executed a superb seoi-otoshi, a complex shoulder throw, to put his opponent onto the mat. In doing so, he became the first Frenchman to win an Olympic judo gold, just a few days ahead of Thierry Rey, who repeated the feat in the -60kg. And on 2 August, Parisi went on to add a silver in the open category competition.\n\nOPEN\n\nFINAL MATCH\n\n1. Dietmar LORENZ GDR YUSEI-GACHI 7:00 2. Angelo PARISI FRA\n\n3. András Ozsvár HUN\n\n3.

Soviet Union, Cuba, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Mongolia, Afghanistan, North Korea, Vietnam, Angola, Ethiopia, Laos.\n\nThe Los Angeles Olympic Games of 1984 brought Hollywood glitz to proceedings, most memorably in a spectacular Opening Ceremony featuring grand pianos, marching bands and a rocket-propelled stuntman flying around the stadium. However, like Moscow four years earlier, the 1984 Games were somewhat marred by a multi-nation boycott. The Soviet Union this time led the protest, winning the support of a number of Eastern European nations including traditionally powerful teams from East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland.\n\nAlthough some events were drastically depleted, and a record 140 nations still participated, bringing more than 6,700 athletes together for a festival of sport. Unsurprisingly, the hosts dominated events, winning a record 83 gold medals. Communist China appeared for the first time, signalling their arrival as an Olympic power with 15 gold medals . The Olympic programme continued to expand, with 21 new events added, 12 of them for women\n\nJudo\n\nIn Los Angeles Neil ADAMS was strongly tipped to become the UK’s first Olympic judo gold medallist. But his opponent Frank WIENEKE (West Germany) threw him with SEOINAGE and ADAMS won the silver. It was the first time in his entire career that ADAMS had lost a match by IPPON.

Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson’s disqualification for a failed drugs test - the day after he had sensationally defeated fierce rival Carl Lewis in the men’s 100 metres in a stunning world record time of 9.79 seconds – sent shockwaves through the sporting world and overshadowed the many other fairly contested events. Lewis was awarded the gold medal and Johnson left the Games in disgrace, his record wiped from the book. Nine other athletes were disqualified after failing dope tests in Seoul and in the boxing ring, controversy raged at the judges decisions.\n\nThough no-one knew it at the time, these would be the last Olympic games in which the USSR would compete. Soviet athletes won 55 gold medals, and the hosts Korea twelve. More than 8000 athletes from 160 nations set a new benchmark for participation at the Games, and a record 52 won medals. Tennis returned to the programme after a 64-year absence, and table-tennis, was included for the first time.\n\nJudo\n\nThe JUDO competition at the Summer Olympics continued the seven weight classes first used at the 1980 Games. The open division was eliminated from the competition. Women's judo made its first appearance at the Olympic Games, as a demonstration sport. Basically, this meant that the winners could not call themselves Olympic champions. The players chosen were the medallists from the previous year's World Championships plus three of the top players from the continents not represented by any of the first four entrants. Japan failed to claim the top of the medal count for the first time in an Olympics in which they participated, coming in third behind South Korea and Poland.\n\nPeter SEISENBACHER from Austria and Hitoshi SAITO from Japan won the gold medal in their weight classes, defending their titles from 1984, and becoming the first judoka to win gold at two Olympics.\n\nMEN\n\nEXTRA-LIGHTWEIGHT FINAL MATCH\n\n(60 kg-132.25 lbs) SHIDO 5:00\n\n1.

The Catalans provided a festival of sport that was spectacular right from the opening ceremony, in which a flaming arrow fired by Spanish archer Antonio Rebollo lit the Olympic flame. Images such as that of China’s pint-sized teenage diving sensation, Fu Mingxia, launching herself from the 10m platform with the city skyline as a backdrop, helped continue the visual feast.\n\nThe changing face of European politics also brought fresh impetus to the Games. The Communist Bloc had crumbled and the Berlin Wall had fallen – many of the new independent republics of the former Soviet Union joined forces to compete as the Unified Team, and recently-unified Germany competed as a single entity again. The Unified Team led way with 45 gold medals, eight more than the United States. But the host nation had a wonderful games with thirteen gold medals. In sixteen previous appearances at the Games prior to 1992, Spain had won just four .\n\nJudo\n\nThe JUDO competition at the Summer Olympic was contested in fourteen weight classes, seven each for men and women. The seven men's weight classes continued to be those first used in 1980. This was the first Olympic competition to award medals to women judoka; women competed in 1988 as a demonstration sport.

However, the organisers struggled to maintain the momentum and spirit created by the Barcelona Games, and some wonderful sporting performances were almost overshadowed by transport difficulties and accusations of over-commercialisation. The Games were further rocked by a terrorist bomb in the Centennial Olympic Park which tragically killed one spectator, Alice Hawthorne, and wounded 110 others.\n\nBoxing legend Muhammad Ali, who had begun his amazing career with a gold medal at the Rome Games of 1960, returned to the Olympic arena to light the flame at the opening ceremony. 197 nations participated - 28 more than the previous benchmark - and the home nation topped the honours table with 44 gold medals.\n\nJudo\n\nThis page shows the final results of the Judo Competition at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Kye Sun-Hui surprised spectators by winning gold in the women's extra-lightweight event.
