        "text": "Thus, the best there's been (so far) since the return of the sport to the Games now more than two decades ago (and the debut of the Paralympics wheelchair tennis listings, too)...\n\n*Graf's \"Golden Slam\"*\n\n1988 Seoul Singles Gold - Steffi Graf (FRG) def. Gabriela Sabatini (ARG)\n\n...6-3/6-3. The most-difficult-to-get cog in the wheel that was Steffi's \"Golden Slam\" -- winning all four slams and Olympic Gold in 1988. Graf was the more-than-appropriate winner of the Gold medal as tennis returned to the Games for the first time in sixty-four years. The German had an overall record of 72-3 in '88. Graf's Golden triumph wasn't just the most expected of all Olympic tennis results, but it was also the most historic. Her run in South Korea came in the midst of a 45-match winning streak (tied for the longest of her career) and stretch in which she went 76-1 during a period spanning the 1988-89 seasons. In fact, from 1987-90, Graf strung together the four best statistical years of her career, putting up a stunning combined won-lost mark of 305-12.\n\n===============================================\n\n*Great Golden Scot!*\n\n2012 London Singles Gold - Andy Murray (GBR) def. Roger Federer (SUI)\n\n...6-2/6-1/6-4. Great Britain's long national tennis nightmare (well, the first of them, anyway) came to an end as the Scot became the first British man to claim Olympic singles Gold in 104 years, since Josiah Ritchie stood atop the medal stand at yet another Summer Games held in London in 1908. The result in the final was a complete reversal of Murray's fortune on the very same Centre Court grass at the All-England Club one month earlier, when Federer defeated him in a four-set Wimbledon final to win career slam title #17. The loss prevented Federer, who'd had to go 4:26 to win his semifinal over Juan Martin del Potro, from finally claiming Olympic singles Gold, the only major singles title to elude him during his career. Murray's win provided the foundation for a more confident, aggressive game that allowed the Scot to conclude his summer by claiming his first career slam crown at the U.S. Open, ending Britain's 76-year drought (Fred Perry '36) of men's slam champs. In 2013, Murray won Wimbledon, as well, to become the first home-grown British men's winner at SW19 in seventy-seven years.\n\n===============================================\n\n*Serenativity Unbound*\n\n2012 London Singles Gold - Serena Williams (USA) def. Maria Sharapova (RUS)\n\n...6-0/6-1. As great as Williams has been at various stages throughout her long career, she may have never been better than she was in the London Games. She never lost a set, dropped serve only once, defeated three players who'd been ranked #1 (and another who'd been #2), including the reigning #1 (Victoria Azarenka) and #3-ranked (Sharapova) players in the world to complete a Career Golden Slam while becoming the first woman to sweep both the singles and doubles Golds since her sister Venus in 2000.\n\nSerena was so good her spectacular serve wasn't even necessary. When she did see fit to use it at full power and effectiveness, sometimes it felt like an additional weapon she'd found reason to pull out of her back pocket to bludgeon her already beaten, bloodied and bedraggled opponent just a little bit more. You know, simply to remind them who they were dealing with. Truthfully, it was almost overkill. But not really. For Serena-at-her-best is all about the absolute destruction of anything in her path. In the final, that poor soul was Sharapova. A couple of months earlier, she'd completed her Career Grand Slam in Paris, returned to #1 and was the toast of tennis once again. But a month after winning Wimbledon (her first slam win in two years), Williams returned to the AELTC to hand Sharapova her worst defeat on the very same court on which Serena had lost to the Russian in the '04 SW19 final that launched the then 17-year old's superstar career.\n\nThe Olympic title run added Serena to the elite list of players who have won each of the sport's six biggest singles crowns: the four slams, Olympic Gold and their tour's year-end championships. The others are Graf and Andre Agassi (Rafa Nadal is an ATP World Tour Finals win away, while both Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic are missing Olympic singles Gold).\n\nThat summer, after returning to action following what could have been a life-threatening pulmonary embolism, Williams found a late-career fountain of youth that would see her go on to win three of the next five slams. From the start of the summer of '12 until the Rio Games of '16, Williams had jumped her career major total from thirteen to twenty-two, tying Steffi Graf for the most in the Open era. A year later, she surpassed the German with #23 by winning (while secretly pregnant) the Australian Open.\n\n===============================================\n\n*PicaPower to the People!*\n\n2016 Rio Singles Gold - Monica Puig (PUR) def. Angelique Kerber (GER)\n\n...6-4/4-6/6-1. In the biggest Olympic tennis shocker ever, #34-ranked Puig is crowned the women's singles champion in Rio, becoming the first person representing Puerto Rico to ever claim Olympic Gold. In all, it was a performance for the tennis ages. Two Top 5 wins, victories over three players who had won a combined four slams (and five by the end of '16), including two reigning major champions and what would be three of 2016's slam champs, was quite the feat for a player who came into the Games with just a single tour title (won two years earlier) to her credit.\n\nPuig rode her fiery, aggressive game to five straight wins that got progressively more astounding as the week went on, including victories over #4-ranked Roland Garros champ Garbine Muguruza -- her first career Top 5 win -- in the 3rd Round, and two-time slam winner Petra Kvitova in the semis to assure herself a medal. The lowest-ranked woman to ever play for singles Gold, Puig then upset #2-ranked (and eventual year-end #1) Australian Open (and, soon, U.S. Open, too) champ Angelique Kerber in the final. After ending the German's spotless Rio set record in the 1st, Puig pulled away in the 3rd, taking a 5-0 lead en route to the victory.\n\nOn the final day of play, Puig earned the title of \"Olympic Legend.\" In Puerto Rico, for sure. For the rest of her life, and for generations thereafter.\n\n===============================================\n\n*La Petit Taureau's Greatest Victory?*\n\n2004 Athens Singles Gold - Justine Henin-Hardenne (BEL) def. Amelie Mauresmo (FRA)\n\n...6-3/6-3.\n\nSmack dab in the middle of her bout with the cytomegalovirus that kept her out of action for the three months prior to Athens, Henin put together maybe the most remarkable performance of her career. She survived a 5-1 3rd set deficit against Anastasia Myskina in the SF, then took out Mauresmo for the Gold. It was only later, once the full knowledge of her illness was known, that we found out just how deep into her reserve that Queen Justine had had to dig to pull this one out. Following her Athens win, still fighting the virus, Henin only played one more tournament (losing in the 4th Round of the U.S. Open) the rest of the '04 season.\n\n===============================================\n\n*Venus & Serena: Together Forever*\n\n2000 Sydney Doubles Gold - Serena Williams/Venus Williams (USA) def. Kristie Boogert/Miriam Oremans (NED) 6-1/6-1\n\n2008 Beijing Doubles Gold - Serena Williams/Venus Williams (USA) def. Anabel Medina-Garrigues/Virginia Ruano Pascual (ESP) 6-2/6-0\n\n2012 London Doubles Gold - Serena Williams/Venus Williams (USA) def. Andrea Hlavackova/Lucie Hradecka (CZE) 6-4/6-4\n\n...as has pretty much been the case throughout their careers, the toughest out in all of tennis is the Williams Sisters on the doubles court. They've played together at four Olympics. Until their shocking 1st Round loss in Rio in '16, they'd gone 15-0 and won three Golds for their efforts. With both having also won singles Gold (Venus in '00, Serena in '12) their four career Golds are the most won in Olympic tennis history.\n\n===============================================\n\n*The Russians Have Their Day*\n\n2008 Beijing Singles Gold - Elena Dementieva (RUS) def. Dinara Safina (RUS) 3-6/7-5/6-3\n\n2008 Beijing Singles Bronze - Vera Zvonareva (RUS) def. Li Na (CHN) 6-0/7-5\n\n...after populating the WTA landscape with their deep pool of talent during the 2000's, the Russians went into China and took care of business, completing the first sweep of the medal stand in Olympic tennis in one hundred years. Showing the Hordettes' depth, the women who earned the honors weren't any of the three Russians who'd won grand slam singles titles, but instead were three of their countrywomen who'd all failed to do so in their careers (going 0-7 in slam finals). Former #3 (and two-time major finalist) Dementieva retired two years later, hailed as possibly the best player never to have won a major title. After winning in '08, the Russian held up her Gold-winning moment as not only the best of her career... but also one that she'd cherish even more than she ever would an actual grand slam crown. Safina ranked as high as #1 and reached three slam finals, while Zvonareva reached #2 and played in two.\n\n===============================================\n\n*The Golden Summer of Venus*\n\n2000 Sydney Singles Gold - Venus Williams (USA) def. Elena Dementieva (RUS)\n\n...6-2/6-4. The conclusion of Williams' spectacular summer of 2000, during which she notched grand slam victories at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, came with her claiming of Olympic singles Gold Down Under. Also grabbing the Sydney doubles Gold with sister Serena, Venus became the first woman since Helen Wills in 1924 to sweep both medals at the same Olympics. Twelve years after Venus accomplished the feat, Serena matched it in London, taking her first singles Gold and third in doubles (w/ Venus, of course).\n\n===============================================\n\n*Keeping It In the Family... eventually*\n\n1996 Atlanta Singles Gold - Andre Agassi (USA) def. Sergi Bruguera (ESP)\n\n...6-2/6-3/6-1. Agassi and Steffi Graf are two of the three players (w/ S.Williams) to have ever won all four slams, plus Olympic singles Gold and a season-ending tour championship title. Before he won Gold on American soil, Agassi had already won titles at three different slams, but he was still viewed as something of an \"underachiever.\" After Atlanta, he'd win five more slams and go down as one of the game's most celebrated ambassadors. Agassi finally won his first Roland Garros title in 1999, completing his career \"Six Pack\" of the sport's biggest singles crowns, something that Graf had finished up eleven years earlier. Agassi and Graf were married in 2001 and had two children.\n\n===============================================\n\n*The Kid Before the Comeback*\n\n1992 Barcelona Singles Gold - Jennifer Capriati (USA) def. Steffi Graf (GER)\n\n...3-6/6-3/6-4. At 16, with all her long-talked about promise still seemingly in front of her, Capriati took down the defending Olympic champion to become the youngest-ever tennis Gold medalist. But, by the end of 1994, Capriati had been arrested for drug possession and would miss nearly two full years of WTA action. She'd finally return in '96, but wouldn't play a complete season until '99. In 2001, eight and a half years after winning Gold, her gradual comeback took flight as she won the first of what would be three slam titles and reached #1. Twenty years after her Olympic triumph, Capriati's career arc was completed when she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\n===============================================\n\n*The Surprise Medalist*\n\n2004 Athens Singles Gold - Nicolas Massu (CHI) def. Mardy Fish (USA)\n\n...6-3/3-6/2-6/6-3/6-4. Talk about a stunner! With his win, Massu became Chile's first-ever Olympic Gold medalist (and then the first two-timer when he won in doubles with Fernando Gonzalez). He was the first man to sweep the singles and doubles Golds since Vincent Richards in 1924.\n\n===============================================\n\n*Home is Where the Heart Is*\n\n1996 Atlanta Singles Gold - Lindsay Davenport (USA) def. Arantxa Sanchez Vicario (ESP)\n\n...7-6/6-2. Since the sport's Olympic return in '88, the only woman to win singles Gold in her home nation has been Davenport. A 20-year old Davenport was the second of three straight U.S.-born Olympic women's champions (sandwiched between Capriati and Venus). She'd go on to win three slams from 1998-00 before essentially being overtaken at the top of the game by the crafty Martina Hingis, then the Williams sisters.\n\n===============================================\n\n*Twice is Nice*\n\n2016 Rio Singles Gold - Andy Murray (GBR) def. Juan Martin del Potro (ARG)\n\n...7-5/4-6/6-2/7-5. Four years after winning Gold in London, Murray becomes the first player in Olympic history (Steffi Graf's '84/'88 two-fer kicked off with the sport being just a demonstration event in L.A.) to successfully defend the singles Gold. The Scot avoided the likes of Federer (DNP), Nadal and Djokovic (both defeated by Delpo) in the draw, but his win gave a Golden glow to what was a career year.\n\nHaving reached the Australian Open and Roland Garros finals earlier in the season, Murray won his second Wimbledon title, reached the #1 ranking for the first time in November (and finished '16 there), won the ATP World Finals crown and was 75-9 (23-3 in majors) on the year.\n\n===============================================\n\n*The Twins Have It*\n\n2012 London Doubles Gold - Bob Bryan/Mike Bryan (USA) def. Michael Llodra/Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (FRA)\n\n...6-4/7-6(2). The Bryan twins complete a Career Golden Slam by taking men's doubles Gold at the London Games. The only other doubles duos to accomplish the feat are three-time Gold winners Serena & Venus Williams and the Woodies, Todd Woodbridge & Mark Woodforde, who won Olympic Gold in 1996 four years before completing their major title set with a Roland Garros title in 2000.\n\n===============================================\n\n*First of Her Kind*\n\n2012 London Singles Bronze - Victoria Azarenka (BLR) def. Maria Kirilenko (RUS) 6-3/6-4\n\n2012 London Mixed Doubles Gold - Victoria Azarenka/Max Mirnyi (BLR) def. Andy Murray/Laura Robson (GBR) 2-6/6-3 [10-8]\n\n...just days after celebrating her 23rd birthday, the world #1 from Belarus reacted to her Bronze medal-winning feat in a joyous way that was very similar to how she'd likely have reacted to winning Gold. Azarenka won Belarus' very first Olympic tennis medal with a Bronze Match victory over Kirilenko, then a day later teamed with Mirnyi to claim the nation's first Gold, as well, by defeating the home favorite Brits to become the champions of the first Mixed Doubles competition held at the Olympics since 1924.\n\n===============================================\n\n*Roger \"versus\" Rafa*\n\nWhile Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have done battle numerous times in their grand slam pasts, they've never met in the Olympics. In fact, their fates at the Games couldn't be more different. Federer, the all-time men's slam title leader, has participated in four Olympics (as the #1 seed three times) but never won Gold in singles. Defeats in '04 (2nd Round to Tomas Berdych) and '08 (QF - James Blake) were preceded by a Bronze Medal Match loss to Italy's Arnaud Di Pasquale in Federer's Olympic debut in '00. In 2012, on his favored grass at the All-England Club after having just won slam title #17 at Wimbledon, the stage seemed set for one additional Golden coronation. But Federer was forced to play a 4:26 semifinal vs. Juan Martin del Potro. He won 3-6/7-6(5)/19-17 in the longest three-set men's match in the Open era, with the 3rd set alone lasting 2:43. In the final, he simply wasn't the same legendary Fed. Whether the marathon win cost him his best chance at Gold will forever be a \"what if?,\" but the fact remains that, one month after defeating Andy Murray in the Wimbledon final, Federer lost in straight sets to the Scot in the Olympic final at the AELTC. The resulting Silver was the first medal won by the Swiss in singles play, but the loss to Murray could be Federer's Olympic swan song, as he was forced to withdraw from the '16 Rio Games with a knee injury and the postponed (until '21) '20 Tokyo event would come a year after Federer underwent *two* knee procedures at age 38.\n\n2008 Beijing Singles Gold - Rafael Nadal (ESP) def. Fernando Gonzalez (CHI) 6-3/7-6/6-3\n\n2016 Rio Doubles Gold - Marc Lopez/Rafael Nadal (ESP) def. Florin Mergea/Horia Tecau (ROU) 6-2/3-6/6-4\n\n...meanwhile, Nadal has played in two Olympics, winning singles Gold in Beijing in '08, then in doubles in Rio eight years later. One day after the '08 Games, Rafa became #1 in the rankings for the first time, ending Federer's record 237 week streak in the top spot, after having spent a record 160 consecutive weeks at #2.\n\nNadal had a chance for Golden sweep in '16, but ultimately won no singles medal in Rio. After losing in a final set TB to Juan Martin del Potro in the semis, the Spaniard fell to Kei Nishikori in the Bronze Medal Match.\n\n2008 Beijing Doubles Gold - Federer/Wawrinka (SUI) def. Aspelin/Johansson (SWE)\n\n...6-3/6-4/6-7/6-3. Federer HAS won an Olympic Gold medal, though. In the same Beijing Games in which Nadal was crowned singles champion, he and Swiss teammate Stan Wawrinka claimed the top spot on the doubles medal stand.\n\n===============================================\n\n*Big Time Russians*\n\n2016 Rio Doubles Gold - Ekaterina Makarova/Elena Vesnina (RUS) def. Timea Bacsinszky/Martina Hingis (SUI)\n\n...6-4/6-4. Makarova & Vesnina become the first all-Russian pair to win Olympic doubles Gold, taking the title in Rio without dropping a set.\n\nThe duo would prove to be one of best big-event pairs of the era. Already with Roland Garros (2013) and U.S. Open (2014) titles in hand, the Hordettes would win the '16 WTA Finals and '17 Wimbledon, as well. With their Rio win, it left them just an Australian Open title away from becoming the first women's duo to win all four majors, Olympic Gold and the year-end championships. Makarova/Vesnina lost in the '18 final in Melbourne (as they had in '14). Both players reached WD #1 the following June, but Vesnina (who had a baby) hasn't played since that season, while Makarova retired in January 2020.\n\nOn a side note, Hall of Famer Hingis' appearance in Brazil, at age 35, was her first in Olympic competition in twenty years. After her \"Dream Duo\" MX pairing with Roger Federer fizzled because of Fed's knee surgery, and Stan Wawrinka ultimately skipped the Rio Games, Hingis didn't play MX at all, while her original WD partner, Belinda Bencic, went out with a wrist injury. Additionally, during the Olympics, Hingis had announced her 17-month, three-slam winning partnership with Sania Mirza was over. But Timea Bacsinszky's early singles loss in Rio allowed both women to be the Olympic \"savior\" for the other, as their Silver run provided both with their first career medals.\n\n===============================================\n\n*The Argentine Survivor*\n\n2012 London Singles Bronze - Juan Martin del Potro (ARG) def. Novak Djokovic (SRB)\n\n...7-5/6-4. After losing a marathon 19-17 3rd set in the semifinals vs. Roger Federer, at 4:26 the longest three-set men's match in the Open era (the 3rd set alone lasted 2:43), del Potro would have been given a pass had he suffered a letdown and not had enough left to fight for a medal. But this was a player who'd shown great promise while winning the U.S. Open at age 20 in 2009, only to have to battle back against a career-altering wrist injury and a slew of ailments over the years ever since. In London, he looked as good as he'd looked in years, pounding those thundering groundstrokes that he used to take down both Federer and Nadal in Flushing Meadows. Rather than go home from London empty-handed, he took Bronze by taking out Djokovic, who led in winners, aces and 1st serve win percentage. But Djokovic was 0-for-6 on break point attempts, while del Potro was 2-for-6. And that was the difference in a straight sets victory that brought Delpo to his knees... in a good way.\n\n2016 Rio 1st Round - Juan Martin del Potro (ARG) def. Novak Djokovic 7-6(4)/7-6(2)\n\n2016 Rio SF - Juan Martin del Potro (ARG) def. Rafael Nadal (ESP) 5-7/6-4/7-6(5)\n\n...four years later, with Federer not in the Olympic event, del Potro (playing with a protected ranking due to his latest injury break due to wrist surgery) took out the #1 (Djokovic) and #3 (Nadal) seeds, only to fall short of Gold in the final vs. #2 Andy Murray. Still, the run gave the Argentine a Silver to go along with his previous Bronze.\n\n===============================================\n\n*When They Were Young*\n\n1984 Los Angeles Women's Final - Steffi Graf (FRG) def. Sabrina Goles (YUG) 1-6/6-3/6-4\n\n1984 Los Angeles Men's Final - Stefan Edberg (SWE) def. Francisco Maciel (MEX) 6-1/7-6\n\n...four years before tennis became an official medal sport again, it was a demonstration, non-medal event in L.A.. As it turned out, the results in L.A. proved to be quite prophetic. The winners? A 15-year old, #8-seeded Steffi Graf of West Germany, three years before her first slam victory (she'd go on to win 22), and 18-year old Swede Stefan Edberg (#3), who'd win the first of his six career slams the next season in Australia. Four years later, Graf would win the first singles Gold in tennis' official return to the Games, then pick up a Silver in '92. Edberg won the Bronze in '88.\n\n===============================================\n\n=HONORABLE MENTIONS=\n\nIn 1992 in Barcelona, Marc Rosset becomes the answer to a trivia question, becoming the only Swiss man to win Olympic singles Gold. In the 20+ years since, Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka have combined to win 23 singles slam titles... but Rosset still stands alone atop Switzerland's tennis medal stand.\n\n===============================================\n\nIn 2016, sixteen years after she'd won swept the singles and doubles Golds in Sydney, 37-year old Venus Williams was playing in Rio. Arguably the player who loves the Olympics more than any other, Williams played with a viral illness and was dumped out of the 1st Round of singles on Day 1. Then she and sister Serena lost their first Olympic doubles match ever on Day 2. After at first being noncommittal about playing Mixed Doubles, thinking she'd be busy in the other two draws, Venus teamed up with Rajeev Ram (himself a late addition to the U.S. team) and very nearly wrote what could have been a storybook ending to the greatest-ever Olympic tennis career.\n\nAfter saving two MP in the 1st Round vs. Bertens/Rojer, the U.S. duo went all the way to the Gold Medal Match, where they won the 1st set and held a 6-3 lead in the 3rd set TB vs. Mattek-Sands/Sock. A win would have given Venus a record fifth tennis Gold, and made her the only player to win Gold in singles, doubles and mixed. But it wasn't meant to be. Still, Venus remains tied with Serena with the most tennis Golds (4), and her Silver medal matches 1920's star Kitty McKane's record of five career Olympic tennis medals. She's won the most tennis medals, male or female, since the sport's return to the Games in 1988.\n\nAnd while there may be some disagreement about whether or not Venus loves her Olympic participation MORE than any other athlete, before making a decision, one should probably take a look at her extended reaction to winning the MX semifinal contest over Mirza/Bopanna, which simply assured her of a fifth medal and another shot to play for Gold. It's priceless, really.\n\nOh, and did I say something about Venus *nearly* writing a storybook ending? Of course, she'll likely get another shot at that in Tokyo in 2020 2021 at age 40 41.\n\n===============================================\n\nYevgeny Kafelnikov defeats Tommy Haas in the 2000 men's singles final in Sydney, becoming the first Russian to win Olympic tennis Gold\n\n===============================================\n\nIn Seoul (1988), Slovak-born Miloslav Mecir, playing for Czechoslovakia, wins the men's singles Gold. To date, no other player representing either side -- Czech Republic or Slovakia -- of the former Soviet era nation has won Olympic tennis Gold.\n\n===============================================\n\nIn the 2012 2nd Round in London, Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga defeats Canada's Milos Raonic in an Olympic record 25-23 3rd set. In the final set alone, Tsonga led 129-128 in total points. Although, for the match, the losing Raonic held a 180-178 edge.\n\n===============================================\n\nBefore the Williams Sisters, another U.S. women's duo -- Florida-born Mary Joe Fernandez & Puerto Rico-born Gigi Fernandez (no relation) -- teamed to win back-to-back Olympic doubles Golds in 1992 (Barcelona) and 1996 (Atlanta)\n\n===============================================\n\nAfter Jelena Dokic came up short in her medal quest Down Under in the Sydney games in '00, losing in the Bronze Medal Match to Monica Seles, Alicia Molik pulled off the feat by taking Bronze four years later in Athens, defeating three seeds (#4 Elena Dementieva, #8 Ai Sugiyama & #3 Anastasia Myskina). Molik defeated Myskina, months after the Russian sparked her nation's tennis revolution by winning at Roland Garros, in the Bronze Medal Match. Myskina had blown a 5-1 3rd set lead to eventual Gold medal winner Justine Henin-Hardenne in the semifinals. Molik is still the only Australian singles player, male or female, to win a medal in Olympic history.\n\n===============================================\n\nHave you heard? The talent pool of Czech tennis women is *very* deep.\n\nIn 2016, that reality played out on the Rio medal stand, where four *different* Czechs won Bronze medals in the event's three eligible competitions. In singles, it was Petra Kvitova. In doubles, Lucie Safarova & Barbora Strycova, who'd upset two-time defending Gold medalists Venus & Serena Williams (who been 15-0 in their Olympics career) in the 1st Round, while Lucie Hradecka teamed with Radek Stepanek in Mixed.\n\nLater that year, the Czech Republic claimed a third straight Fed Cup title, and a fifth in six years.\n\n===============================================\n\nAnd a couple of misses...\n\n*The Best Laid Plans...*2004 Athens Doubles Gold - Li Ting/Sun Tiantian (CHN) def. C.Martinez/Ruano Pascual (ESP) 6-3/6-3\n\n2008 Beijing Doubles Bronze - Yan Zi/Zheng Jie (CHN) def. A.Bondarenko/K.Bondarenko (UKR) 6-2/6-2\n\n2008 Beijing Singles Bronze - Vera Zvonareva (RUS) def. Li Na (CHN) 6-0/7-5\n\n...in 2004, four years before China hosted the games in Beijing, Li Ting & Sun Tiantian earned the first Chinese medal in tennis. The Chinese tennis federation put much effort into building up the sport within the nation in time for Beijing, banking on even greater success there. Right on schedule, the Chinese Fed Cup team reached the semifinals for the first time in '08. Then came the Beijing Games. The Russian sweep of the singles medal stand (medalists Safina & Zvonareva went 4-0 vs. Chinese opponents) meant zero medals were earned there for the home nation, as Li Na succumbed to the pressure of the moment and lost in the Bronze Medal Match. Meanwhile, Yan & Zheng's Bronze in doubles was actually a step back (or two) from the success the Chinese had had four years earlier. China failed to win any tennis medals in 2012 or '16.\n\n2008 Beijing SF - Rafael Nadal (ESP) def. Novak Djokovic (SRB) 4-6/6-1/4-6\n\n2008 Beijing Singles Bronze - Novak Djokovic (SRB) def. James Blake (USA) 6-3/7-6(4)\n\n2012 London SF - Andy Murray (GBR) def. Novak Djokovic (SRB) 7-5/7-5\n\n2012 London Singles Bronze - Juan Martin del Potro (ARG) def. Novak Djokovic (SRB) 7-5/6-4\n\n2016 Rio 1st Round - Juan Martin del Potro (ARG) def. Novak Djokovic (SRB) 7-6(4)/7-6(2)\n\n...while Novak Djokovic is a 17-time slam champ, 5-time year end singles #1, 5-time ATP World Tour Finals champ and led Serbia to a Davis Cup crown in 2010, he's managed to win just one Bronze medal in his Olympic career. He's lost to both Rafa Nadal and Andy Murray in semifinals, and to Juan Martin del Potro in back-to-back Olympic matches stretched over two Games. He's avoided a shocking medal shutout by upending James Blake (who'd defeated Roger Federer in the QF) for Bronze in '12, but remains a Gold medal away from joining the likes of Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi and Serena Williams as the only players to win singles crowns at all four slams, the Olympics and the tour championships.\n\n===============================================\n\nOver the course of her Paralympics history, Dutch wheelchair tennis legend Esther Vergeer did what she did pretty much everywhere during her career: win just about everything. In all, she won more medals (8) and more Golds (7) than any other tennis player in the Games' history, sweeping the singles and doubles three times (2000, '04 and '12).\n\nVergeer lost just one match in her Paralympic career, in the '08 Beijing Doubles Gold match (w/ Jiske Griffioen) vs. another all-Dutch duo, Korie Homan & Sharon Walraven.\n\nVergeer's final competition was at the '12 Games in London, as she retired in early 2013. Somehow, despite being *the* most dominant tennis athlete at any level of professional tennis in her lifetime, Vergeer has not *yet* been inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\n===============================================\n\nIn 2012 in London, Japan's Shingo Kunieda defended his '08 Beijing Gold to become the only back-to-back men's wheelchair singles champion in Paralympics history. Having also won Gold in '04 in the men's doubles, he's won five total Paralympic medals (w/ 2 Bronze in doubles).\n\n===============================================\n\nDutch woman Jiske Griffieon swept the singles and doubles at the Rio Paralympics in 2016, replicating countrywoman Vergeer's three-time feat (even defeating the same woman -- another countrywoman, Aniek van Koot -- that Vergeer did in the '12 singles final). Griffioen had won the '12 singles Bronze in London, after having lost to Vergeer in the semis.\n\nThree of the four women's singles semifinalists hailed from the Netherlands.\n\n===============================================\n\nIn the inaugural Paralympics wheelchair tennis competition in 1992 in Barcelona, the Netherlands' Monique van den Bosch and the U.S.'s Randy Snow both swept the singles and doubles Golds in their respective competitions.\n\nBeginning what would be a tradition in Paralympic women's tennis, it was an all-Dutch final as van den Bosch defeated countrywoman Chantal Vandierendonck, then the two joined forces to win the doubles. The now-married Kalkman-van den Bosch would repeat with Vandierendonck as doubles champion in '96 in Atlanta, and pick up Silver in singles. She'd previously won a Silver in the singles in the '88 (Seoul) demonstration event (Vandierendonck won Gold), as well as a Gold and Bronze in the 1984 \"Summer Paralympics\" in New York in WC table tennis.\n\nKalkman was inducted into the Int'l Tennis Hall of Fame in 2017, three years after Vandierendonck had also been enshrined in Newport.\n\nSnow won a Bronze in wheelchair basketball at the '96 Paralympics, and was the first Paralympian inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame. Having died in 2009, Snow was posthumously inducted into the Int'l Tennis Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\n===============================================\n\nDutch women have dominated the Paralympic medal stand, taking all 14 singles and doubles Golds in the women's competition since the inaugural events in 1992, as well as claiming all seven singles Silvers and seventeen of the twenty-one overall singles medals (27/42 s+d).\n\nThe seven singles Golds have been split up between Vergeer (4), van den Bosch (1), Maaike Smit (1) and Jiske Griffioen (1). The fourteen doubles Golds have been won by five different all-Dutch duos, including two back-to-back winners in Kalkman-van den Bosch/Vandierendonck (1992/96) and Smit/Vergeer (2000/04).\n\n===============================================\n\nAussie David Hall leads all men's Paralympic tennis players with six total medals from 1996-2004. Hall won singles Gold in Sydney in '00, as well as three Silvers ('96/'00 MD, '04 MS) and two Bronze ('96 MS/'04 MD).\n\nHall received a Medal of the Order of Australia for his 2000 Gold medal. He was inducted into the Int'l Tennis Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\n===============================================\n\nAniek Van Koot, though she's been ranked #1 and won 18 (3s/15d) slam titles, has often lived in the shadow of other contemporaries. The Dutch woman has a similar history in the Paralympics, reaching two singles finals (2012 and '16) but losing to a pair of players who swept both the singles and doubles competitions. She won a doubles Gold with one of her conquerors (Griffioen '16), but lost to the other (Vergeer '12) in another (w/ Griffioen) Gold medal doubles match.\n\n===============================================\n\nWhile current wheelchair #1 Diede de Groot *could* one day have her eye on some of the slam records of countrywoman (and mentor) Vergeer, she's got a *long* way to go when it comes to challenging her Paralympic glory. The young Dutch woman has (so far) won just one medal, a doubles Silver in 2016 (w/ van Koot) as a 19-year old in Rio.\n\n\"Diede the Great\" had yet to win her first slam crown in '16 (she now has 15 -- 7s/8d), but she nearly picked up two medals at the Games, coming in 4th Place in singles after losing the Bronze match to Yui Kamiji. It's the only Paralympics medal won to date by the 22-time slam champ (7s/15d) from Japan.\n\n===============================================\n\n**WOMEN'S SINGLES MEDALISTS, since
