        "text": "*Originally published in Dutch in the exhibition catalogue De ontdekking van het dagelijks leven: Van Bosch tot Bruegel (Uncovering Everyday Life: From Bosch to Bruegel), Rotterdam, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, 2015. This essay introduces an exhibition at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen on the development of everyday life as a subject for painting. It provides an overview of the art of the first cohort of painters – along with printmakers – who developed the genre between 1500 and 1570. In the process, it treats the forerunners to 16th-century genre painting, Bosch’s immense contributions at the beginning of the period, and depictions of peasants as introduced by Pieter Aertsen and picked up by Pieter Bruegel. The essay closes with discussion of the uniqueness of the contributions of Netherlandish artists, their selectivity of subject matter, the possible functions of the paintings, and the role that humor played.\n\nThe article aims at analysing the cartography in the Netherlands during the XVIIth century, starting from a comparison with the artistic production in the same period. Art and cartography will be shown as results of the same economic, social and political context, deeply changed since the independence of the late XVIth century. The contacts and interactions between the two areas of interest will be studied, in order to investigate the causes and peculiarities of the cartographic development occurred in the Netherlands in the XVIIth century, which was defined as an «happy industry» in the Golden Age. The article is based on Vermeer’s and other Dutch artists paintings, hosted in the exhibition Vermeer. Il Secolo d’Oro dell’arte olandese [Vermeer. The Golden Age of the Dutch art]. In many of those artworks, the artists exemplary reproduced maps and globes, giving a clear idea of which role the geographical elements have had in the Dutch development and the article will try to explain why they were distributed that much.\n\nThis paper focuses on depictions of port cities and river harbours, integrated in the background landscapes of Early Netherlandish panel paintings. As compositional parts of larger landscape settings, these motifs were quite popular in the southern Low Countries and especially in Antwerp during the first decades of the sixteenth century. A thorough investigation into their precise nature and significance has hitherto been lacking. It is the aim of the present article to fill this gap and investigate to what extent the emergence and evolution of this specific kind of imagery can be linked to larger societal developments in the southern Low Countries and in the distinctive urban culture of Antwerp more specific."
