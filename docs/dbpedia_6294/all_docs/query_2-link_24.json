        "text": "By Randy Walker\n\n@TennisPublisher\n\nSo August 16 is the birthday of Tony Trabert, who, for those young enough to not know, was one of the all-time great American tennis players. Trabert won five major singles titles, five major doubles titles and perhaps closest to his heart were being the leading member of the U.S. Davis Cup team for many years as a player and captain, leading the team as a player to an historic win over Australia in 1954 and as captain to wins in 1978 and 1979.\n\nTrabert actually was two match wins away from winning the Grand Slam in 1955, winning Wimbledon, the U.S. and French Championships, but lost in the semifinals to start the year at the Australian Championships. For years he was the voice of American tennis as the commentator for the U.S Open on CBS alongside Pat Summerall and he also served for many years as the President of the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nOne of things that I always also associate with Tony Trabert is….the city of Cincinnati. Which is why the Cincinnati Open should pay homage to this all-time tennis great and name its stadium court for Trabert.\n\nTrabert was born there on August 16, 1930 and grew up there, attending Walnut Hills High School. He stayed in Cincinnati for college, going to the University of Cincinnati, incredibly playing on both the tennis and basketball teams. He won the NCAA singles title for the Bearcats in 1951 before he served in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War (although he served on the USS Coral Sea in the Mediterranean) and then touring the world in tennis and winning 56 career amateur singles titles.\n\nI was reminded of Trabert’s birthday by my former U.S. Tennis Association colleague Mark Preston, also the former long-time writer and reporter for Tennis Magazine. Preston wrote an homage on his Facebook page, along with photos of he and Trabert and an personally autographed copy of Sports Illustrated with Trabert on the cover from the 1950s. “Tony Trabert wasn’t just one of the greatest champions ever to play the sport of tennis, but also one of the grandest and most gracious gentlemen ever to walk this earth,” wrote Preston. “I was incredibly fortunate to call him my dear friend. I miss him a lot, particularly today, on his birthday, when we always made a point of connecting to catch up. A quick phone call invariably turned into an hour-long back and forth of jokes and stories and lots of love. Happy heavenly birthday, my friend. I’m sure you’re working on getting us a table… ”\n\nI responded to the post, writing, “I threw this out on Twitter/X earlier this week that the Cincinnati Open should name their Stadium Court after Tony, who was the greatest tennis player to ever come out of Cincinnati, and, of course, was not only one of the all-time great player but, arguably on par with Roger Federer, as one of classiest gentlemen in the sport. Cincinnati is one of the most historical events in American tennis but it hardly exudes or celebrates its history, so this can be a step in that direction and certainly honor one of the legends in American tennis.”\n\nThe Cincinnati Open is one of the four biggest tennis tournaments in the United States and one of the 10 biggest in the world. It has played since 1899, making it also one of the oldest tournaments in the world and the longest running tennis event in the United States played at the same city (remember, the modern-day U.S. Open started in Newport, Rhode Island before moving to New York in 1915.) Full confession is that I have never been on-site to the Cincinnati Open, but I don’t get much of a vibe from afar/on television of the history of the tournament. For example, the U.S. Open is played at the Billie Jean King USTA National Tennis Center and the stadium is named for Arthur Ashe. There is also the Arthur Ashe Commemorative Garden and the U.S. Open Court of Champions, that honors the all-time greats in the history of the event. There is also a statue honoring Althea Gibson on the grounds as well. When TV coverage goes to or comes out of commercial at the U.S. Open, you usually catch a glimpse of some of these historical commemorations as part of the TV coverage.\n\nAt the Cincinnati Open, which is technically played in the town of Mason, Ohio, you usually only see scenes of roller coasters from the nearby King’s Island Amusement Park, which, with all respect, doesn’t really exude any feelings of reverence or historical significance for the tennis demographic. (Although 11-year-old kids probably are excited about that). Wouldn’t it be great to have a statue of Trabert on site – and the court in his name to match – to show off and offer more talk about the legacy of tennis in Cincinnati and of this great citizen of Ohio? (Rather than there be stories about the Applebees at the tournament as Ben Rothenberg wrote years ago here: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/sports/tennis/applebees-a-suburban-staple-for-cincinnati-masters-players.html and what seems to be something that many people talk about in relation to the Cincinnati event.) Having commentators refer to “Next on Trabert Stadium….is Carlos Alcaraz against Gael Monfils” rather than just using the generic term “Stadium?” Events that celebrate its history are just more highly regarded, in my opinion.\n\nFor a deeper dive on the Trabert career, here is how tennis historian an Hall of Famer Bud Collins described him as seen in the book “The Bud Collins History of Tennis” (for sale and download here https://a.co/d/34Q5BGq)\n\nTony Trabert\n\nHall of Fame—1970\n\nOne of the finest seasons ever achieved was the 1955 of Tony Trabert, who won three of the four singles majors—French, Wimbledon and U.S.—and two of the doubles, Australian and U.S., earning the No. 1 peak. Triplers are rare, but none of them won more than 100 singles matches or 30 singles and doubles titles as Tony did that year.\n\nWithin the most productive season for an American man were 18 singles triumphs (of 23 tournaments)—106-7, with a 36-match winning streak—plus 12 doubles titles alongside Davis Cup teammate Vic Seixas. Amassing 13 U.S. titles in singles and doubles, he was one of two Americans (the other, Art Larsen) to win singles championships on all four surfaces. Other than grass at Forest Hills, he won the 1955 Indoor over Ham Richardson, 11-13, 7-5, 9-7, 6-3; the 1953 Hard Court over Tom Brown, 6-4, 11-9, 6-4; the 1951 Clay Court over Larsen, 6-8, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 8-6, and, 1955, over Bernard Bartzen, 10-8, 6-1, 6-4. But Tony stands alone in victoriously traveling that surface route in doubles, too. Alas for Trabert, a semifinal defeat by Ken Rosewall at the 1955 Australian may have cost him a Grand Slam.\n\nAn exceptional athlete, Marion Anthony Trabert was born Aug. 16, 1930, in Cincinnati where he grew up. He was a standout basketball regular for the University of Cincinnati, for which, as an All-American, he also won the U.S. Intercollegiate singles in 1951. Traditionally the French Championship has been the most difficult battleground for American men. Tony won five titles at Roland Garros, notably the singles in 1954, over Art Larsen, 6-4, 7-5, 6-1, and 1955, over Swede Sven Davidson, 2-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-2. He also won the doubles in 1950 (with Bill Talbert) and 1954-55 (with Seixas). Thirty-four years passed before another American guy followed him, Michael Chang in 1989, and Tony was there as a telecasting witness.\n\nFor five years, Trabert was a mainstay of the U.S. Davis Cup team, along with Seixas. In each of those years, 1951-55, the Yanks reached the challenge round final against Australia. Tony’s best-remembered match may have been a defeat, a tremendous five-set struggle with Lew Hoad on a rainy afternoon in 1953 at Melbourne. Hoad won out, 13-11, 6-3, 2-6, 3-6, 7-5, to tie the series, 2-2, and Rosewall hung onto the Cup, 6-2, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, over Seixas.\n\nMore determined than ever, Trabert and Seixas, led by Capt. Bill Talbert, returned to Australia a year later, where Trabert beat Hoad, 6-4, 2-6, 12-10, 6-3 on opening day. Seixas bumped Rosewall in four. Then, together Vic and Tony busted an American dry spell of four years by taking the doubles from Lew and Ken, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2, 10-8—the only U.S. seizure of the Cup from the Aussies during an eight-year stretch, 1950-57.\n\nThough an attacker with a powerful backhand and strong volley, competitive right-hander Trabert also had exceptional groundstrokes. In winning the U.S. singles twice, 1953 over Seixas, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3, and 1955 over Rosewall, 9-7, 6-3, 6-3—plus Wimbledon in 1955 over Kurt Nielsen, 6-3, 7-5, 6-1—he did not lose a set. Wow. Following the custom of the time, Trabert, as the top amateur, signed on with the professionals to challenge the ruler, Pancho Gonzalez, on a head-to-head tour in 1956. Gonzalez won, 74-27. Trabert was runner-up to Alex Olmedo for the U.S. Pro singles title in 1960, having won the doubles with Rex Hartwig in 1956.\n\nWhen his playing career ended, Trabert worked as a teaching pro, an administrator for the pro tour, as an astute television commentator on tennis as well as the president of the International Tennis Hall of Fame. In 1976, he returned to the Davis Cup scene as the U.S. captain, leading the Cup-winning teams of 1978 and 1979. He had four years in the U.S. and world’s Top 10: 1951, 1953, 1954, 1955—No. 1 in each, respectively 1953 and 1955—before turning pro. His amateur career was interrupted by service in the U.S. Navy.\n\nMAJOR TITLES (10)—French singles 1954, 1955; Wimbledon singles, 1955; U.S.\n\nsingles, 1953, 1955; Australian doubles, 1955; French doubles 1950, 1954, 1955; U.S.\n\ndoubles, 1954. OTHER U.S. TITLES (13)—Intercollegiate singles, 1951; Indoor singles,\n\n1955; Clay Court singles, 1951, 1955; Hard Court singles, 1953; Indoor doubles,\n\n1954, with Bill Talbert; 1955, with Vic Seixas; Clay Court doubles, 1951, 1955, with\n\nHamilton Richardson; 1954, with Seixas; Hard Court doubles, 1950, 1953, with Tom\n\nBrown; Pro doubles, 1956, with Rex Hartwig. DAVIS CUP (As player)—1951, 1952,\n\n1953, 1954, 1955, 16-5 singles, 11-3 doubles; (As Captain)—1953, 1976, 1977, 1978,\n\n1979, 1980. Record 14-3 (2 Cups). SINGLES RECORD IN THE MAJORS—Australian\n\n(4-2), French (18-2), Wimbledon (13-2), U.S. (23-5).\n\nBy Randy Walker\n\n@TennisPublisher\n\nSo the Hall of Fame Open in Newport, R.I. is now no longer an ATP Tour level event.\n\nThe 48th and final edition of the event as an tour event on the ATP Tour calendar ended with U.S. Olympian Marcos Giron defeating Alex Michelsen 6-7, 6-3, 7-5 in a thrilling final in front of a sell-out crowd. Next year, as part of a restructuring of the ATP Tour’s summer schedule, the event will return, but as a combined men’s and women’s 125-level Challenger event. To compare with baseball, the event will more or less be the AAA baseball equivalent in tennis. For the most part, the transition from “minor league tennis” to the “the show” can be seamless as there are a good number of players playing Challengers who fans will see play in Grand Slam tournaments or ATP or WTA tournaments perhaps even just after playing a Challenger. Most Challengers feature players ranked No. 100 and lower, however it is not uncommon to have a handful of top 100 players playing in Challengers.\n\nAs charming and historic as the Hall of Fame Open has been through the years, it probably has had the worst player fields of any ATP 250–level event, mostly due to the fact that it is held the week after Wimbledon and on grass, when players are putting the grass season behind them and preparing for the U.S. Open on hard courts. In 2024, the Hall of Fame Open had only 10 of its 28 singles players ranked in the top 100, led by top seed and defending champion No. 25 Adrian Mannarino and No. 2 seed and eventual champion Marcos Giron, ranked No. 46. The lowest-ranked direct entry in the field was Benoit Paire at No. 227. In 2023, the lowest ranked direct entry was Michelsen, who actually had an incredible run to the final, when he got into the event with a ranking of No. 250.\n\nThrough the years, many of players with low-rankings have had inspiring runs in Newport, as documented in my book “On This Day In Tennis History” (for sale and download here: https://a.co/d/ceAgJ7G) In 1993, Greg Rusedski was ranked No. 151 when he won his first ATP title. Leander Paes, a member of the 2024 Hall of Fame class, was ranked No. 120 in the world when he won the title in Newport in 1998, Prakash Amritraj, the son of 2024 Hall of Fame class member Vijay Amritraj, was ranked No. 305 in the world in 2008 when he was the singles runner-up in Newport. In 1991, Bryan Shelton, the father of current top U.S. pro Ben Shelton, was ranked No. 147 when he won the title in Newport. In 2006, Mark Philippoussis, ranked No. 214 in the world, also won the title in Newport, although he was once ranked in the top 10.\n\nSo what can fans expect player fields to look like for the joint men’s and women’s 125-level Challenger in 2025? For example, one can look at this week’s Chicago 75 Challenger (slightly lower than a 125 event) where the top seed is Terence Atmane of France, ranked No. 120. Benjamin Bonzi of France, ranked No. 136, is the No. 2 seed. Five players who competed in the main draw of Newport are in the field in Chicago, Li Tu, ranked No. 208, Marc Polmans, ranked No. 217, Alex Bolt, ranked No. 210, Coleman Wong, ranked No. 170 and Gabriel Diallo of Canada, ranked No. 165.This week’s 125 Challenger in Zug, Switzerland has No. 87 Botic Van De Zandschulp as the top seed and No. 146 Matteo Gigante as the No. 2 seed.\n\nWhat about a potential women’s field? This week’s WTA 125-level Challenger is in Warsaw, Poland and the top seed is No. 109-ranked Rebecca Sramkova of the Slovak Republic and the No. 2 seed is No. 110-ranked Mai Hontama of Japan. The lone American entry in Warsaw is Alycia Parks, who is ranked No. 124. Since the “Newport Challenger” is obviously in the United States, the field will certainly feature more American players and one can expect a handful of up-and-coming young American players, seeking ATP and WTA ranking points to help them move up to the higher levels of tennis, to receive wild card entries into the tournament.\n\nA combined men’s and women’s event in Newport starting in 2025 means twice the number of matches for fans. For the ATP Tour Hall of Fame Open, there were 25 total main draw singles matches and 15 main draw doubles matches. For the combined Newport Challenger, there will be 32-player singles draws and 16-team doubles draws. This means there will be 62 main draw singles matches and 30 main draw doubles matches for both genders combined. (Pray for little or no rain as there can’t be night play on grass!) The Hall of Fame announced that five match courts will be used for the event, which probably also means laying out two courts (or perhaps three courts) on the Stadium Court grass footprint, as was done in the past.\n\nThe total prize money for the 2024 Hall of Fame Open as an ATP event was $742,350 with the winner, Giron, earning $100,000, the runner-up Michelsen earning $58,000 and first round losers earning $7,000. Giron earned 250 ATP ranking points as the winner and Michelsen, as runner-up, earned 165 ranking points. The total prize money for the Newport Challenger, which will offer equal prize money for both men and women, will be about $160,000 per event (men and women), so it is about a 75 percent decrease in prize money (for the men, of course). Each singles winner will receive about $20,000 and the runner-up about $12,000 and first round losers will earn about $1,000. The winners will receive 125 ranking points and the runner-up will earn 64 ranking points.\n\nWhile the prize money will be much smaller, there shouldn’t be too much of a drop off in level of play. However, it will be interesting to see the player fields based on the fact that many players may want to focus on getting ready for the hard court season. Also, the Newport Challenger will be held during the second week of Wimbledon, July 6-13 with the tournament’s opening day occurring on the middle Sunday of Wimbledon and players who are in the top 100 will be at Wimbledon, unsure of when they will be eliminated in singles, doubles or mixed doubles. However, for players who wish to play at Wimbledon in the future and want to get some experience playing more grass court tennis, the Newport Challenger provides that opportunity.\n\nBy Randy Walker\n\n@TennisPublisher\n\nAfter 2024, the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships, the only grass court pro tennis tournament outside of Europe, will be no longer.\n\nThe ATP Tour announced on November 8, 2023 that the long-time annual tournament held on the historic grounds of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I. will be “retired” in a new-look ATP Tour schedule. Basically, with the events in Canada and Cincinnati going from one-week events to two week events, tournament weeks needed to be sacrificed. Newport, held the week after Wimbledon, and the Atlanta Open, played the week after Newport, were the sacrificial lambs.\n\nIn announcing their tournament’s upcoming swan-song in 2024, the International Tennis Hall of Fame labeled its email blast press release “New era of professional tennis to begin in 2025 for International Tennis Hall of Fame.” The Hall of Fame’s press release stated in its first sentence, “The International Tennis Hall of Fame will be introducing new professional tennis events in Newport in 2025” and then stated. “The ITHF is also in the process of reimagining professional tennis in Newport with the expectation that beginning in 2025 a new era of pro tennis on the historic courts will begin.”\n\nDan Faber, the new Hall of Fame CEO, said in the press release, “World-class tennis has been part of the fabric of Newport for nearly 150 years and will continue to have an ongoing presence at the International Tennis Hall of Fame. The ITHF is actively exploring the opportunities to host new professional tennis events in Newport. In addition, we will continue to strengthen our digital programming, museum and visitor experience, worldwide presence, and presentation of the Ultimate Honor in Tennis – induction into the Hall of Fame.”\n\nNewport is undoubtedly one of the most historic and treasured venues for tennis. A major part of promoting tennis (or any type of event) is promoting its history and tradition. High-level tournaments have been held at the Newport Casino since 1881 when the first edition of the modern-day U.S. Open was held there. The site hosted the U.S. Championships until 1914 and continued to host annual events in the summer grass court events on the “Eastern Circuit” as well some Davis Cup matches among other special events.\n\nSo what event will replace the officially sanctioned ATP Tour event? The Hall of Fame could go “full circle” and have an exhibition event, which is exactly what the inaugural edition of the Hall of Fame Championships was in 1976, when Vijay Amritraj won the title. At the time, in only the eighth full year of pro tennis in the “Open Era,” the event was not an ATP sanctioned event but was labeled an exhibition event. It was actually then held in September after the U.S. Open and not in the current July date. To boot, the semifinal and final-round matches were best-of-five set matches with Amritraj beating Brian Teacher 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 in a four-set final. (The ATP, retroactively, recognized this, among other events during this nebulous era of pro tennis, as an “official” event for the sake of player’s historical records.)\n\nIn 2025 and 2026, there will still be an open week after Wimbledon on the pro tennis calendar and, presumably, before the start of the Washington, D.C. combined ATP and WTA tournament, which could allow for some ATP and WTA pros to play some sort of Newport exhibition event – perhaps an eight or 16-player mini prize money tournament – that would not conflict with an ATP or WTA tournament that week in North America. This would be, presumably, the week where the traditional ATP clay-court events are held in Gstaad, Switzerland and Bastad, Sweden, as part of a mini clay-court circuit that also includes the 500-level event in Hamburg, Germany. This is also the week where the new Hopman Cup was played in Nice, France on clay in 2023. Could perhaps the Hopman Cup find a new home in Newport for this week after Wimbledon?\n\nDuring the 2023 Hall of Fame Open, a “Ultimate Tennis Showdown” event was held in Carson, California, that was won by U.S. No. 1 Taylor Fritz over Wu Yibing in the final. Could this event slide into the Newport week? This event featured an experimental format (read more here https://www.uts.live/) which would be in the spirit of the Hall of Fame’s founder, Jimmy van Alen, who hosted several events at the Newport Casino with experimental formats, including tiebreaker matches (which were not implemented in official tennis until 1970) and matches where players had to serve from farther behind the baseline than normal.\n\nSome have speculated that perhaps the Hall of Fame Championships could continue as a WTA event. The Newport Casino did host a women’s Virginia Slims event from 1971 to 1998 as you can read here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Slims_of_Newport It could also continue as an ATP Challenger event, one rung below the ATP Tour level. If one analyzed some of the draws of past ATP editions of the Hall of Fame Championships have you would see that the fields were not unlike some Challenger level events, minus one or two higher-ranked players who likely accepted guarantees to play the event. In 2023, Alex Michelsen, with a ranking of No. 250, gained a main draw entry into the tournament, which is about as low as a ranking as one can remember receiving a direct entry into an ATP event and is more on par with a Challenger event. Despite the relatively weak field by ranking, the tournament in 2023 featured sold out crowds most of the week, which is indicative how popular this event was in Rhode Island and the New England area, regardless of the ranking quality of the field. A Challenger-level event would feature a similar-level field, minus a few top 40 or so ranked players.\n\nMore speculation has included a “senior” tennis event to replace the Hall of Fame Championships. The Newport Casino, in recent years, have hosted a separate senior event on the former Outback Champions Series tour, run by Jim Courier’s company InsideOut Sports & Entertainment. In 2008, it received added attention when John McEnroe was defaulted from his match, as documented here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMnT_-AjRo. This was first held separately from the Hall of Fame Open as a stand-alone multiple-day event in August, but later was held in conjunction with the event as a four-player one-day event that was held before the Sunday singles final. However, this tour, most recently branded as the PowerShares Series, is on pause and not currently hosting any tournaments.\n\nWhile the Hall of Fame decides on what type of event will replace its ATP tournament, the organization does look forward to many years of blockbuster Hall of Fame inductees, including likely first-ballot inductees such as Maria Sharapova and Bob and Mike Bryan in 2025, Roger Federer in 2027 (with perhaps Serena Williams, who has yet to officially announce her retirement technically, joining him) and then Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka to follow when they finally officially hang up their sneakers.\n\nBy Randy Walker\n\n@TennisPublisher\n\nThe induction of Goran Ivanisevic into the International Tennis Hall of Fame brought back my personal most memorable moment in the career of this Croatian sports legend. Surprisingly, it is NOT him winning Wimbledon in the epic five-set “People’s Monday” final against Patrick Rafter in 2001.\n\nFor me, it was a moment that probably very few people know of and if they did, they probably forgot it. It was a dramatic five-set United States vs. Croatia Davis Cup doubles match between Ivanisevic and Ivan Ljubicic against Mardy Fish and James Blake during the 2003 United States vs. Croatia Davis Cup first round in Zagreb, Croatia and it came in what was perhaps the deepest depth of Ivanisevic’s career. After the euphoria of finally winning his first major title at Wimbledon in 2001, Ivanisevic was stricken with terrible arm problems that significantly impaired his famous left-handed sling-shot serve. He barely played in the year before this Davis Cup series in February of 2003, fighting through the tremendous pain and negative emotions he was enduring.\n\nAndy Roddick, the top dog in American tennis at the time, pulled out of this tie with injury and exhaustion after reaching the semifinals of the Australian Open the week before, including his famous 21-19 in the fifth set quarterfinal win over Younes El Aynaoui in four hours and 59 minutes. This left James Blake and Mardy Fish to carry to the load for the United States in this tie against Ivan Ljubicic (the future coach of Roger Federer), Mario Ancic and Ivanisevic in the doubles. I go into greater depth of this match in an excerpt in my ebook “U.S. Davis Cup Team Stories – The Bryan Brothers Debut In A 2003 Season of Change” (For download here https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0851FR9JN/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_3WAJZ89A18PB5VVFYDWM via @amazon) below where I describe the happenings and my observations while serving as the U.S. Davis Cup team’s press officer. What made this moment so memorable for me was that Ivanisevic had barely played in a year, was in terrible pain and not playing so great the first two sets of the match, but somehow willed himself over the finish line as he and Ljubicic staged the incredible two-sets-to-love comeback over Fish and Blake to give Croatia the important 2-1 lead in the best-of-five-match series. The crowd was only about 3,000 strong as that was all the arena could fit, but they were LOUD in the intimate environment and they obviously went beserk when their national hero just lead their nation to a huge victory in this Davis Cup series.\n\n“Her-Vas-KA” was shouted by the fans (the Croatian word Hrvaska which the name of their country in their native language) followed by three claps or three foot stomps or three drum bangs. I have a framed poster of this Davis Cup series on my wall in my New York City apartment that denotes the series being between Hrvaska and “SAD” which is the initials in Croatian for Sjedinjene Amerieke Drzave, or United States of America. The U.S. team and contingent was obviously “sad” after this doubles match and the impending tie loss to the Croatians the next day, clinched by Ljubicic over Blake, but I was fixated on watching Ivanisevic enjoy this moment of victory and redemption.\n\nThe moment that I will never forget is watching Goran step onto the now vacated chair umpire stand and forcibly ripping the microphone out of its secure position. The crowd, which were chanting and singing, drumming and stomping at an unbelievable decibel in this small compact arena, almost immediately went silent when they saw that their man, their hero, their national symbol Goran Ivanisevic wanted to speak to them.\n\n“Hvala” I won’t forget him saying, which is “Thank you” in Croatian as I was amazed at how quickly the crowd went from pandemonium to silence. The crowd was hanging on the next words to come out of Goran’s mouth. He paused for a few more moments and then started singing some sort of song that sounded like a Croatian soccer or sports song. The crowd again went bonkers and the Croatians joined Goran in singing this song, the sound reverberating off the low ceiling of the arena. Bud Collins, the Hall of Fame tennis journalist who was there covering the match for the Boston Globe, said that he found out the lyrics to the song equated to “Let’s Stomp on the Americans” – which I am sure other countries are named and used in this song, based on what international team the Croatians beat in soccer, handball, basketball or whatever. It was one of those atmospheric moments that defined what was great about Davis Cup.\n\nThe way that this crowd were so reverential toward Goran just stayed with me. He commanded them like he was a conductor of an orchestra. It was one of his last great match victories. He would only play 24 more singles and doubles matches in his career, finally able to return to Wimbledon, the site of his greatest triumph, in 2004 to say goodbye to the sport that gave him so much.\n\nThe excerpt on this USA vs. Croatia series from “U.S. Davis Cup Stories” is found below…\n\nMuch of the buzz entering the first round series centered around the status of 2001 Wimbledon champion and Croatian sporting legend Goran Ivanisevic. Since his celebrated win at the All England Club in 2001, Ivanisevic had been plagued with injuries and underwent surgery on his left shoulder in May of 2002. Despite playing only three ATP singles matches in the previous 12 months due to the recovery from his surgery, Ivanisevic was determined to make his return against the Americans. He had played in the Heilbronn Challenger level event in Germany the week before Davis Cup, only to withdraw in the second round with tremendous pain in his shoulder.\n\n“I couldn’t do anything, my arm hurt terribly,” Ivanisevic said. “I suffered for 10 months, underwent an operation to feel better and now this…I’ve never felt so miserable….I’ll let him give me 30 injections if that’d help. I’m in such a state that I’d go to Tibet on foot if I knew that would help,” he said. “I’m totally lost.”\n\nNot surprisingly, he was not drawn to play singles against the Americans, but in doubles with Ivan Ljubicic. Fish, ranked No. 74 in the ATP rankings, was drawn to face No. 52-ranked Ljubicic to start the tie off, with Blake and Mario Ancic playing the second singles match.\n\nUnder a backdrop of a loud, flag-waving jam-packed crowd of 2,800 in the tiny Dom Hall Sportova, which resembled a high school gym than a major sporting arena, Fish and Ljubicic opened the proceedings. Ljubicic, with his future brother-in-law banging a drum to incite the small but overflowing and vocal crowd, took advantage of the fast conditions on the indoor carpet serving with equal abandon on both first and second serve. With Fish showing nerves in his first away Davis Cup action and his first ever Davis Cup singles match, he was tentative on his normally solid return of serve and was unable to hook onto Ljubicic’s blistering serves. Only after 97 minutes – at 1-2 in the third set – was Fish able to look at a break point – only to see it disappear behind a Ljubicic service winner. Of Ljubicic’s 70 service points, 30 were aces, 19 were service winners, while 16 were double faults. Final result, Ljubicic in straight sets by a 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 margin.\n\n“I’ve never played anybody with a serve like that,” said Fish of Ljubicic. “I couldn’t read his serve and I just didn’t have an answer…I’ve never seen a first and second serve like that.”\n\nBlake took the court with the swagger of the team leader and jumped on and dominated Ancic, easily winning the first two sets 6-1, 6-2 before maneuvering through a third set-tie-break to square the matches at 1-1 after the first day of play.\n\n“Davis Cup is a lot of pressure and I think it’s a lot of fun out there,” said Blake. “It’s a great atmosphere out there having a biased crowd. There is going to be pressure in every match, with varying degrees. I went into it looking it as if it was another live Davis Cup rubber.”\n\nWhile there was little doubt that Fish and Blake would pair in the doubles, there still remained a minor mystery on whether Ivanisevic would take the court the next day. Said Croatian captain Nikki Pilic of Goran’s availability for the Saturday doubles, “I think he will make his decision. I have made my decision already. If he has a good arm, like today (in practice), I think he will play.”\n\nAn electric atmosphere greeted Ivanisevic as he strolled onto the court with Ljubicic on Saturday afternoon. The scene, according to Bud Collins of The Boston Globe was of pandemonium. “Horns toot, a drum rat-a-tat-tats, shrill whistles pierce the fetid air and the checker board flags of Croatia flap everywhere,” he wrote.\n\nIvanisevic was playing in only his second complete match since undergoing left shoulder surgery on May 15, 2002. His appearance the previous week in Heilbronn, Germany was first event since April 6, 2002, when he and Ljubicic defeated Guillermo Canas and Lucas Arnold of Argentina in the Davis Cup quarterfinal in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe rust showed early for Ivanisevic, who struggled with his serves and stumbled on volleys and returns, trying desperately to find his rhythm against the energized Blake and Fish. Leading two-sets-to-love, Blake and Fish appeared in complete control, until the third set tie-break. With the Croatians leading 4-2 in the tie-break, Fish served up a double fault to put the set on the Croatians racket with Ljubicic serving at 5-2, but Blake and Fish won both points on Ljubicic’s serve, to cut the lead to 4-5. Blake then served to Ivanisevic, who floated a sitter return that Fish netted on top of the net, giving Croatia two set points. A bungled volley by Blake then gave Croatia the third-set tiebreak.\n\n“It was a screwy tiebreaker,” Blake said later. “Hard to believe – on a fast court, and strong servers. But I thought we were OK.” A loose service game by Fish in the first game of the fourth set, cemented the momentum change for the Croatians. At 4-4 in the fifth-set, the Croatians broke Blake at love for a 5-4 lead, with Ljubicic then serving out the incredible 3-6, 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-4, 6-4 victory for the vital 2-1 lead.\n\nWrote Collins of Ivanisevic as the match concluded, “He was beaming ecstatically after hugging Ljubicic at the conclusion of their enthralling 3-hour-4-minute rebound. They leaped, danced, and pitched their rackets into the joyful crowd. Ivanisevic grabbed a microphone to thank the crowd and lead them in a victory song. The essence of the lyrics: “We stomped the Americans!”\n\nSaid Ivanisevic, “I knew it was going to be tough because 11 months, I played (one) challenger, but not a match like this. This is Davis Cup. It was really the first time in my life (I was) lost, that you don’t know what you are doing on the court. Nervous, heavy, no ideas. Then (Ivan) was telling me, ‘Come on, don’t worry it’s going to come, we need one break, we need something to happen.’ By the end of the second set, I start to play better and felt it that we were going to be OK. Blake played very good and also Fish, but Blake was the guy who was really pushing. Third, fourth and fifth set, everything open…I had great pain in my elbow, biceps, everywhere, but I said, doesn’t matter what happen, you have to finish this match….\n\n“I was taking painkillers and I said to Ivan, ‘We are going to break Blake in the fifth set,’ because he is playing too good, he has to do something wrong, Yesterday, he didn’t do anything wrong and today almost three hours, he didn’t do anything wrong and nobody can do it. And then we had good returns in the last game and it was great….I needed this match. Wimbledon was different. I forgot how to play this kind of match. I was so happy I didn’t what to do, where to go, where to jump. I really need this match. I need to feel, because when you play Challenger and you win a match and nobody is jumping, but when you beat the USA in doubles from two sets to love down and after 11 months without this type of match, you have to be happy. … I knew I play good at the practice. I was very nervous today. Very stiff, very lost, but I knew it would break somewhere and I did it. I started to play well later….volley, return everything was great. Crowd was great…this is crowd this is what you say, when you have home advantage when we have crowd like this and crowd can lift you. Without this crowd, we couldn’t win today….I was so stiff, so tight, so much pressure. I started to feel my serve at the end of the second set. I served the best in the fifth set when I had the most pain. I wouldn’t stop for anything. Even with a broken shoulder I would play, but I think it’s going to fine. Now I can take off for the next five months.”\n\nThe match marked the first time since 1965 that an American doubles team has lost in Davis Cup after leading two sets to love. In 1965, Dennis Ralston and Clark Graebner lead Spain’s Luis Arilla and Manuel Santana two sets to love, only to lose 4-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 11-9 in Barcelona.\n\nSaid Blake, “They served great. They kept their heads high. They stayed positive. Goran, I think, got better as the match progressed. He served better than you can expect from someone coming off an eight-month layoff.”\n\nBlake chose his post-match press conference to also vent at some of the Croatian fans in the crowd, who called out during points, in between first and second serves, during serves, during overheads. “I feel like I was a little disappointed with the lack of class of some of the fans, but some of them might not be tennis fans, so that is possibly to be expected,” said Blake. “It didn’t really have a place in a match that was supposed to about goodwill and friendship between countries. I feel like I was more disappointed with the referee’s decision not to do anything about it and not control the situation when that’s their job and that’s the rule. I don’t think that affected us that much besides one incident of calling out in the middle of a point, which obviously affected concentration during that point. We tried to put that behind us.”\n\nInstead Blake chose to look ahead to the fourth rubber of the series between he and Ljubicic and, hopefully for the Americans, a live fifth rubber between Fish and Ancic. “I still see a good chance for me,” said Blake, “and I’d love to give Mardy the chance to be the hero”\n\nOn Sunday, Blake withstood the Ljubicic barrage of aces and after losing the first set, stole the second set tie-break and took a 4-2 lead in the third and appeared in complete control of the match. But Ljubicic went on a run of four straight games to win the third set, benefiting from two loose service games from Blake in the eighth and tenth games of the fourth set. Ljubicic carried his momentum to win in four sets- 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-3 – to clinch the tie for Croatia.\n\nby Randy Walker\n\n@TennisPublisher\n\nBefore you participate in the new “fan voting” for the International Tennis Hall of Fame, read this!\n\nI have been in some discussions via my Twitter profile @TennisPublisher about statistics with regard to what is a “Hall of Fame worthy” resume through the years.\n\nI have generally felt that winning two major singles tournaments gets you into the Hall of Fame. You could also win only one major singles title but could also get in if you reached a few other major finals and reached the No. 1 ranking in the world and won over 20 singles titles. Doubles specialists would probably have to win at least eight major doubles titles with at least one from each of the four. Winning the Davis Cup / Fed Cup and an Olympic medal should also help in giving you consideration.\n\nFans can go to vote.tennisfame.com to submit their votes. The deadline for fans to vote is October 7.\n\nYevgeny Kafelnikov\n\n2 majors singles titles (1996 French Open, 1999 Australian Open)\n\n1 major singles runner-up finish\n\n4 major doubles titles (1996, 1997, 2002 French, 1997 US Open)\n\n26 career singles titles\n\n27 career doubles titles\n\nCareer high singles ranking: No. 1\n\nDavis Cup titles: 2002\n\nOlympic accomplishments: Won Olympic gold in singles in 2000\n\nOther: First player from Russia, man or woman, to rank No. 1 and win a major singles title. The last man to win singles and doubles titles at the same Grand Slam tournament at the 1996 French.\n\nCurrent Hall of Famer Career Comparison: By comparison, Kafelnikov’s career is better than his fellow Russian Marat Safin, who was inducted in 2016. Safin also won two majors and reached No. 1 in the world like Kafelnikov, but no doubles majors, but won 11 fewer singles titles, 25 fewer doubles titles and did not win an Olympic medal, like Kafelnikov’s gold in Sydney. Kafelnikov’s record is also on par with the record of two major winners Ilie Nastase and Stan Smith and is certainly better than Michael Stich, this year’s inductee, who won one major (albeit Wimbledon) and reached two other finals, did not reach No. 1 in the world, won eight less singles titles, 17 fewer doubles titles.\n\nKafelnikov was not a popular player with a “bad guy” image so you could also compare him to that of Ilie Nastase, who, like Kafelnikov won two majors (the French and US Opens) and was also world No. 1.\n\nGoran Ivanisevic\n\n1 major singles title (2001 Wimbledon)\n\n3 major singles runner-up finishes (1992, 1994 and 1998 Wimbledon)\n\n0 major doubles titles\n\n22 career singles titles\n\n9 career doubles titles\n\nCareer high ranking: No. 2\n\nDavis Cup titles: 2005\n\nOlympic accomplishments: At the Olympic Games in Barcelona, he won won bronze medals in both singles and doubles for Croatia, a state that had only recently declared independence. In order to earn his single bronze medal, he won four straight five-set matches, a unique feat in the open era.\n\nOther: Reached at least the quarterfinals at all four majors, including the semifinals at the US Open in 1996\n\nCurrent Hall of Famer Career Comparison: Andy Roddick and Michael Chang are worthy comparisons here as each also entered the Hall of Fame with only one major title and multiple runner-up showings at majors (Roddick 3 Wimbledon final losses and 1 U.S. Open final loss and Change 1 U.S. Open final loss and 1 French Open final loss). Like Chang, Ivanisevic reached No. 2 in the world. Chang won 34 singles titles, Roddick won 32 and Ivanisevic won 22. Ivanisevic also won 9 doubles titles and won two Olympic medals.\n\nSergi Bruguera\n\n2 major singles titles (1993, 1994 Roland Garros)\n\n1 major singles runner-up finish (1997 Roland Garros)\n\n0 major doubles titles\n\n14 career singles titles\n\n3 career doubles titles\n\nCareer high ranking: No. 3\n\nDavis Cup titles: 0\n\nOlympic accomplishments: Silver medal at the 1996 Olympics\n\nOther: Reached at least fourth round at all four majors, but not past the fourth round other than the French. Opened the door to an armada of Spanish greats, including Al Costa, Juan Carlos Ferrero and Rafael Nadal.\n\nCurrent Hall of Famer Career Comparison: Patrick Rafter, like Bruguera, won two majors and back-to-back as he did at the 1997 and 1998 US Opens. Rafter also reached two other major finals at Wimbledon in 2000 and 2001 (and reached at least the semifinals at the French and Australian) which is better than Bruguera’s other runner-up finish at the French and fourth-round finishes elsewhere. Rafter reached the No. 1 ranking famously for only one week, which tops Bruguera’s career high of No. 3. They are virtually equal in singles titles as Rafter won three fewer titles than Bruguera with 11. The Spaniard, however, does have an Olympic silver medal, which adds to his case. Jan Kodes is a fair comparison to Bruguera. Manuel Orantes, a fellow Spaniard like Bruguera, only won a single major title at the 1975 U.S. Open and only played one other major final at the French in 1974, which is not as good a record as Bruguera, despite Orantes winning 36 singles titles to Bruguera’s 14. Yannick Noah is another one-Slam inductee to compare to. He only won the 1983 French and only reached one other semifinal at a major at the 1990 Australian. Noah did win 23 singles titles and 16 doubles titles and reached a career singles ranking of No. 3 and No. 1 in doubles. Noah’s personality as a global ambassador certainly helps his cause as a Hall of Famer.\n\nThomas Muster\n\n1 major singles title (1995 Roland Garros)\n\n0 major singles runner-up finish\n\n0 major doubles titles\n\n44 career singles titles\n\n1 career doubles titles\n\nCareer high ranking: No. 1\n\nDavis Cup titles: 0\n\nOlympic accomplishments: Did not compete\n\nOther: Reached two Australian Open semifinals (1989, 1997) and three US Open quarterfinals but was 0-4 in his career at Wimbledon. Despite his reputation as one of the best clay court players ever, he only reached the French Open semifinals twice – in 1995 en route to the title and in 1990, losing to Andres Gomez.\n\nCurrent Hall of Famer Career Comparison: Again, once can compare Muster and his one major title with that of Andy Roddick and Michael Chang. Muster was No. 1 in the world and won 44 career titles to Roddick’s 32 and Chang’s 34. Roddick, however, reached four other major finals. Chang also reached two other major finals, losing to Muster in the 1995 French final, and his career-high was one-rung lower at No. 2.\n\nAlso, Muster’s credentials should be compared to Yannick Noah, who also won his only major at the French in 1983. Muster won 21 more singles title than Noah and had a high\n\nYannick Noah is another one-Slam inductee to compare to. He only won the 1983 French and only reached one other semifinal at a major at the 1990 Australian. Noah did win 23 singles titles and 16 doubles titles and reached a career singles ranking of No. 3 and No. 1 in doubles.\n\nJonas Bjorkman\n\n0 major singles titles\n\n0 major singles runner-up finishes\n\n9 major doubles titles (career Grand Slam in doubles)\n\n6 career singles titles\n\n54 career doubles titles\n\nCareer high singles ranking: No. 4 (No. 1 in doubles)\n\nDavis Cup titles: 3\n\nOlympic accomplishments: No medals\n\nOther: Reached two career major singles semifinals (1997 US Open and 2006 Wimbledon) and won a career Grand Slam in doubles (3 Australian, 2 French, 3 Wimbledon, 1 U.S. Open)\n\nCurrent Hall of Famer Career Comparison: Todd Woodbridge won 16 majors doubles titles, which is seven more than Bjorkman. Woodbridge won 83 doubles titles, 29 more than Bjorkman. Woodbridge also reached a major semi in singles at Wimbledon in 1997. Mark Woodforde won 12 major doubles titles, five more than Bjorkman and won 67 doubles titles, 13 more than Bjorkman, and also reached a Grand Slam semifinal in singles at the Australian Open in 1996. “The Woodies” also won Olympic gold and silver as a team.\n\nMary Pierce\n\n2 major singles titles (1995 French, 2000 Australian)\n\n3 major singles runner-up finishes (1994, 2005 French Open, 1997 Australian Open)\n\n2 major doubles titles (2000 French doubles, 2005 Wimbledon mixed)\n\n18 career singles titles\n\n10 career doubles titles\n\nCareer high singles ranking: No. 3\n\nFed Cup titles: 2\n\nOlympic accomplishments: No medals\n\nCurrent Hall of Famer Career Comparison: Let’s compare Pierce with fellow Frenchwoman and Hall of Famer Amelie Mauresmo, who also won two major singles titles (2006 Australian Open and 2006 Wimbledon) but Piece reached three more major finals than Mauresmo. Mauresmo won 25 career titles, which is seven more than Pierce, but Pierce won seven more doubles titles, including the 2000 French doubles title. Pierce only reached a career high of No. 3, two rungs lower than Mauresmo’s career high of No. 1.\n\nLi Na\n\n2 major singles titles (2011 French Open, 2014 Australian Open)\n\n1 major singles runner-up (2013 Australian Open)\n\n0 major doubles titles\n\n9 career singles titles\n\n2 career doubles titles\n\nCareer high singles ranking: No. 2\n\nFed Cup titles: 0\n\nOlympic accomplishments: Fourth-place at 2008 Beijing Olympic Games\n\nOther: The first player from China to win a major singles title. Her final-round matches were watched by more people than perhaps any tennis match in the history of the world, being seen alone by over 100 million people in China (Super Bowl like numbers in that country alone). She is a major reason why there has been such an explosion in interest in tennis in China.\n\nCurrent Hall of Famer Career Comparison: Amelie Mauresmo again can be a comparison here as she also won two major singles titles. Li Na reached an additional major singles final and won only nine career singles titles (against 25 for Mauresmo), which is a low number for a potential Hall of Famer.\n\nConchita Martinez\n\n1 major singles title (1994 Wimbledon\n\n2 major singles runner- up finishes (1998 Australian, 2000 French Open)\n\n0 major doubles titles\n\n33 career singles titles\n\n13 career doubles titles\n\nCareer high singles ranking: No. 2\n\nFed Cup titles: 5\n\nOlympic accomplishments: 3 Olympic medals in doubles, silver in Barcelona, bronze in Atlanta, silver in Athens\n\nOther: Won five Fed Cup titles for Spain alongside Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, which is fourth-place all time.\n\nCurrent Hall of Famer Career Comparison: Jana Novotna also won one major singles title (at 1998 Wimbledon), reached two other final-round finishes, a career high ranking of No. 2 and three Olympic medals just like Martinez. Novotna has 24 singles titles to 33 for Martinez. However, Novotna won 12 major doubles titles (and four in mixed doubles) and won 76 doubles titles (to 13 for Conchita). Novotna won one Fed Cup title to five for Conchita.\n\nLleyton Hewitt made a triumphant debut on the Invesco Series QQQ circuit Sunday winning his debut event at the International Tennis Hall of Fame by defeating Tommy Haas 7-6(2) in the one-set championship match.\n\nHewitt, the Australian Davis Cup captain and still active on the ATP World Tour, handed Haas his first-ever loss on the North American tennis circuit for champion tennis players over the age of 30 in the final. Haas made his Invesco Series debut earlier this year in Charleston, S.C. where he won the title beating Andy Roddick in the final. Haas also won the title at the Kohala Coast in Hawaii, defeating John McEnroe in the title match.\n\nHaas took the early lead against Hewitt, breaking serve for 2-0, before Hewitt bounced back to reeled off five consecutive games, buoyed by his amazing return of serve. With Hewitt serving for the match at 5-3, Haas was able to break back with the help of some incredible passing shots to eventually force the deciding tiebreaker. In the tie-breaker, Hewitt proved to be relentless getting off to an early mini-break and never looked back.\n\n“This is the first time I’ve played on the Invesco Series and it was really fun,” said Hewitt. “The conditions were a bit tough as we had to wait out the rain for most of the day but I played well when we got out there and had a great time doing it”.\n\nDue to threatening weather Sunday in Newport, the Invesco Series QQQ matches were delayed to be played after the 12:30 pm ATP singles final, instead of before, as originally scheduled. Hewitt defeated James Blake 6-3 in the first semifinal match, while Haas followed by beating U.S. Davis Cup captain Jim Courier 6-3.\n\nDespite the loss, the 40-year-old Haas remains on top of the Invesco Series QQQ rankings earning 200 ranking points to increase his ranking point total to 1,000. Philippoussis, who won the last Invesco Series QQQ event in May in Toronto, remains in second with 500 points. By winning 400 points with the title, Hewitt, age 37, moves into a tie with the 59-year-old McEnroe for third place in the rankings.\n\nThe Invesco Series QQQ continues on August 19 at the ATP World Tour’s Winston-Salem Open in Winston-Salem, N.C. featuring Blake, Roddick, Ginepri, and Michael Chang.
