        "text": "An Olympic medal is awarded to successful competitors at one of the Olympic Games. There are three classes of medal: gold, awarded to the winner; silver, awarded to the runner-up; and bronze, awarded to the third-place competitor. In addition to generally supporting their Olympic athletes, some countries provide sums of money and gifts to medal winners, depending on the classes and number of medals won.\n\nMedal designs have varied considerably since the first Olympic Games in 1896, particularly in size and weight. A standard obverse (front) design of the medals for the Summer Olympic Games began in 1928 and remained for many years, until its replacement at the 2004 Games as the result of controversy surrounding the use of the Roman Colosseum rather than a building representing the Games' Greek roots. The medals of the Winter Olympic Games never had a common design, but regularly feature snowflakes.\n\nIntroduction and early history[]\n\nThe olive wreath was the prize for the winner at the Ancient Olympic Games. It was an olive branch, of the wild-olive tree that grew at Olympia,[1] intertwined to form a circle or a horse-shoe. According to Pausanias it was introduced by Heracles as a prize for the winner of the running race to honour Zeus.[2]\n\nWhen the modern Olympic Games began in 1896 medals started to be given to successful competitors. However, gold medals were not awarded at the inaugural Olympics in 1896 in Athens, Greece.[3] The winners were instead given a silver medal and an olive branch,[4] while runners-up received a laurel branch and a copper or bronze medal.[5] In 1900, most winners received cups or trophies instead of medals.\n\nThe custom of the sequence of gold, silver, and bronze for the first three places dates from the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri in the United States. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has retroactively assigned gold, silver and bronze medals to the three best placed athletes in each event of the 1896 and 1900 Games.[6][7] If there is a tie for any of the top three places all competitors are entitled to receive the appropriate medal according to IOC rules.[8]\n\nMedals are not the only awards given to competitors; every athlete placed first to eighth receives an Olympic diploma. Also, at the main host stadium, the names of all medal winners are written onto a wall.[8]\n\nProduction and design[]\n\nThe IOC dictates the physical properties of the medals and has the final decision about the finished design. Specifications for the medals are developed along with the National Olympic Committee (NOC) hosting the Games, though the IOC has brought in some set rules:[8][9]\n\nRecipients: The top three competitors receive medals\n\nShape: Usually circular, featuring an attachment for a chain or ribbon\n\nDiameter: A minimum of 60 mm\n\nThickness: A minimum of 3 mm\n\nMaterial:\n\nFirst place: It is composed of silver (at least .925 grade) covered with 6 grams of pure gold.\n\nSecond place: It has the same composition as the first place medal without the gilding. [10]\n\nThird place: It is mostly copper with some tin and zinc (worth approximately $3).[11]\n\nEvent details: The sport for which the medal has been awarded should be written on the medal\n\nThe first Olympic medals in 1896 were designed by French sculptor Jules-Clément Chaplain and depicted Zeus holding Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, on the obverse and the Acropolis on the reverse.[3] They were made by the Paris Mint who also made the medals for the 1900 Olympic Games hosted by Paris. This started the tradition of giving the responsibility of minting the medals to the host city. For the next few Olympiads the host was also given the ability to choose the medal design.\n\nTrionfo[]\n\nIn 1923 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) launched a competition for sculptors to design the medals for the Summer Olympic Games. Giuseppe Cassioli's Trionfo design was chosen as the winner in 1928.[3][12][13] The obverse brought back Nike but this time as the main focus, holding a winner's crown and palm with a depiction of the Colosseum in the background.[12] In the top right section of the medal a space was left for the name of the Olympic host and the Games numeral. The reverse features a crowd of people carrying a triumphant athlete. His winning design was first presented at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The competition saw this design used for 40 years until the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich became the first Games with a different design for the reverse side of the medal.[3]\n\nCassioli's design continued to inspire the obverse of the medal for many more years, though recreated each time, with the Olympic host and numeral updated. The obverse remained true to the Trionfo design until the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, where the IOC allowed an updated version to be created. For the next few events they mandated the use of the Nike motif but allowed other aspects to change.[9] The trend ended in 2004 due to the negative publicity in reaction to the design of medal for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Wojciech Pietranik, the designer of the medal, along with the organisers of the Games were criticised by the Greek press for using the Roman Colosseum rather than the Greek Parthenon.[3][14] Pietranik's original design had featured the Sydney Opera House on the obverse but the IOC concluded that it should be replaced by the Colosseum and a chariot rider. He made the changes and, despite the criticism, the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games decided to continue with the design as it was, noting that there was insufficient time to complete another version and that it would be too costly.[9] The error had remained for 76 years until a new style depicting the Panathinaiko Stadium was introduced at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.[15] This new obverse design would go on to be used at the 2008 and 2012 Games.\n\nCustom reverse designs[]\n\nThe German Olympic Committee, Nationales Olympisches Komitee für Deutschland, were the first Summer Games organisers to elect to change the reverse of the medal. The 1972 design was created by Gerhard Marcks, an artist from the Bauhaus, and features mythological twins Castor and Pollux.[16] Since then the Organising Committee of the host city has been given the freedom of the design of the reverse, with the IOC giving final approval.\n\nComparison between Summer and Winter[]\n\nThe IOC has the final decision on the specifications of each design for all Olympic medals, including the Summer Games, Winter Games, and Paralympic Games. There has been a greater variety of design for the Winter Games; unlike with the Summer Games, the IOC never mandated one particular design. The medal at the inaugural 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France did not even feature the Olympic rings. Nike was featured on the medals of the 1932 and 1936 Games but has only appeared on one medal design since then. One regular motif is the use of the snowflake, while laurel leaves and crowns appear on several designs. The Olympic motto Citius, Altius, Fortius features on four Winter Games medals but does not appear on any Summer Games medal.\n\nFor three events in a row, hosts of the Winter Games included different materials in the medals: glass (1992), sparagmite (1994), and lacquer (1998). It was not until the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China that a Summer Olympic host chose to use something different, in this case jade. While every Summer Olympic medal except for the 1900 Games has been circular, the shapes of the Winter Games have been considerably more varied. The Winter Games medals are also generally larger, thicker, and heavier than those for the Summer Games.\n\nIndividual design details[]\n\nSummer Olympic medal designs[]\n\nDetails about the medals from each of the Summer Olympic Games:[16][17]\n\nGames Host Details Designer(s) Mint Dia.\n\n(mm) Thk.\n\n(mm) Wgt.\n\n(g) image 1896 Athens, Greece Obverse: Zeus holding Nike\n\nReverse: The Acropolis Jules-Clément Chaplain Paris Mint 48 3.8 47 1900 Paris, France Obverse: Winged goddess holding laurel branches; Paris in the background\n\nReverse: A victorious athlete holding a laurel branch; the Acropolis in the background\n\nNote: The only Olympic medal that is not circular Frédérique Vernon Paris Mint 59 x 41 3.2 53 1904 St. Louis, Missouri Obverse: Nike holding a laurel crown and a palm leaf\n\nReverse: An athlete holding a laurel crown; Greek temple in the background Dieges & Clust Dieges & Clust 37.8 3.5 21 1908 London, Great Britain Obverse: An athlete receiving a laurel crown from two female figures\n\nReverse: Saint George atop a horse\n\nEdge: \"Vaughton\", event name and winner Bertram Mackennal Vaughton & Sons 33 4.4 21 1912 Stockholm, Sweden Obverse: An athlete receiving a laurel crown from two female figures\n\nReverse: A herald opening the Games with a statue of Pehr Henrik Ling behind him Bertram Mackennal (obverse)\n\nErik Lindberg (reverse) C.C.

Before then all the medals were awarded at the closing ceremony, with the athletes wearing evening dress for the first few Games. For the first time at the 1932 Games the competitors received their medals immediately after each event atop a podium.[8]\n\nThe 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy were the first in which the medals were placed around the neck of the athletes. The medals hung from a chain of laurel leaves, while they are now hung from a coloured ribbon.[16] When Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics the competitors on the podium also received an olive wreath crown.\n\nSee also[]\n\nJames Brendan Connolly, recipient of the first winner's medal"
