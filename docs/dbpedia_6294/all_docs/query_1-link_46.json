        "text": "There has been plenty of drama on the third day of the Paris Olympics, with the United States men’s gymnastics team winning their first medal in 16 years in dramatic circumstances.\n\nThe team was inspired by Brody Malone, who competed in five of the six events and helped Team USA to hold off Britain and Ukraine to win bronze. Japan surged to gold in the final rotation, while China took silver.\n\nAway from Bercy Arena, the United States women’s basketball team thrashed Japan 102-76 while Canada’s 17-year-old sensation Summer McIntosh won her first career individual Olympic gold medal, dominating the women's 400-meter individual medley.\n\nElsewhere in Paris on Monday, Novak Djokovic beat Rafael Nadal in their 60th and most likely final meeting in the men’s tennis singles, while triathlon swimming training was canceled once again because of pollution in the River Seine.\n\nMedal table | How to follow\n\nIncredibly close.\n\nDown to the final two in the women's 10m air rifle, Ban Hyojin of South Korea, 16, and Huang Yuting of China, 17, went into a shoot-off after Ban shot a 9.6 with her final effort.\n\nHuang, who had already won a gold medal in the mixed 10m air rifle alongside Sheng Lihao, shot 10.3 - Ban shot 10.4 - ever so slightly closer to the target. It literally could not have been a closer margin.\n\nBan finishes with an Olympic record of 251.8 - technically the same final score as Huang. What were you doing at 16?!\n\nSwitzerland's Audrey Gogniat grabbed bronze with a score of 230.3, pipping American Sagen Maddalena to the medal spots, with the 30-year-old from Woodland, California finishing fourth.\n\nGood question. Sunday at Teahupo'o in Tahiti ended with every surfer representing host nation France qualifying for the round of 16.\n\nJohanne Defay received four stitches in her head after colliding with the reef on Saturday but recovered brilliantly to beat the strong Molly Picklum of Australia in the heat.\n\nDefay said: “Yesterday on my first wave I had a fall… it just went so big, I went straight into the coral with my head, I had four stitches.\n\n“They made me go through the concussion protocols and the results were so-so, so they made me go through them all again this morning... There’s no trauma, so we’re happy.”\n\nFrenchman Kauli Vaast beat South Africa's Matthew McGillivray in the men's competition. But Defay has drawn Tahiti local and compatriot Vahine Fierro in the third round - meaning one home favourite will bow out.\n\nTime: 3 p.m. ET, 9 p.m. in Paris\n\nTV: USA Network and Peacock\n\nThe U.S. women’s basketball team opens its pursuit of another gold medal against Japan in Villeneuve-d’Ascq, France.\n\nThe Americans have won seven consecutive Olympic gold medals — last missing the top of the podium in 1992.\n\nThe U.S. roster shows a preference for veterans this year, with the youngest players — Sabrina Ionescu and Jackie Young — 26 years old.\n\nA’ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart, the last two WNBA MVPs, lead the team, while 42-year-old Diana Taurasi is going for a record sixth gold medal.\n\nTraining ahead of the Olympics triathlon competition has been cancelled for a second successive day because of concerns over the water quality in the Seine.\n\nSunday’s familiarisation session was called off after tests on the levels of pollution in the river deemed it unsafe for swimming.\n\nThe same heavy rain that hampered Friday’s opening ceremony has seen the water quality affected after concerns were already raised over its suitability and safety ahead of the Games.\n\n“Following a meeting on water quality held this morning (Monday) … a joint decision was taken to cancel the swim leg of the triathlon familiarisation which was due to be held on 29 July at 8am,” a joint statement from Paris 2024 organizers and World Triathlon read.\n\nThe running and bike familiarisation sessions will go ahead as planned.\n\nTime: 2:30 p.m. ET, 8:30 p.m. in Paris\n\nTV: NBC and Peacock\n\nAustralia’s Ariarne Titmus captured her first gold medal of the Paris Games on Saturday, fending off Canadian Summer McIntosh and American Katie Ledecky in the women’s 400-meter freestyle final.

She is also the world record holder with a time of 1:52.23, which she set at this year’s Australian trials.\n\nIn Canada, the talk has been that this could be Summer’s Summer Olympics.

A two-time world champion in the event, McIntosh set a world record at the 2024 Canadian trials.\n\nTime: Not before 7:30 a.m. ET; 1:30 p.m. in Paris\n\nTV: Peacock and NBCOlympics.com\n\nOne of the greatest tennis rivalries will be renewed today when Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic play on Court Philippe-Chatrier.\n\nIt will be the 60th and perhaps final time Nadal and Djokovic will face one another in their storied careers. Nadal has 22 Slam singles titles while Djokovic is the all-time leader with 24. Both players are familiar with Roland Garros, the site of the annual French Open.\n\nNadal has a record 14 French Open titles while Djokovic has three. Djokovic has a 30-29 lead in the career head-to-head against Nadal.\n\nThis will be Nadal’s third match in three consecutive days; he won his opening-round doubles match alongside Carlos Alcaraz on Saturday. On Sunday in the men’s singles first round, Nadal won in three sets over Hungary’s Márton Fucsovics.\n\nBoth players are at different points in their careers.

Last time on the podium: Beijing, 2008. Sixteen years ago.\n\nThe U.S. squad of Asher Hong, Paul Juda, Brody Malone, Stephen Nedoroscik and Fred Richard finished fifth in qualifying Saturday — the same place the Americans finished in the final in Tokyo. They’ll face stiff competition today.\n\nChina, which has won two of the last four Olympic gold medals, finished first in qualifying. Japan, the reigning world champion, finished second.\n\nThe medals (which do look nice, to be fair) feature a hexagonal piece of scrap iron from the original construction of the Eiffel Tower, with the Games logo engraved into it.\n\nThe back of the medals depict Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, inside the beautiful marble Panathenaic Stadium in Athens, Greece, where the first modern Olympics were held in 1896.\n\nAround 5,084 medals will be made by the French mint. Fun fact: 98.8% of the gold medals are made with silver, just 1.13% of gold in them.\n\nOf course, most will be based in the capital city of France, Paris, in the north of the country.\n\nBut the ‘City of Light’, famous for its art museums (like the Louvre), architecture (like the Arc de Triomphe) and, of course, the Eiffel Tower, isn’t the only place hosting events of the Games.\n\nLille, Marseille, Bordeaux, and Lyon are among the other cities involved in mainland France.\n\nIt has: 2024 is the third occasion it has hosted the Games (after 1900 and 1924), with this year’s event the centenary of 1924, when American swimmer Johnny Weissmuller won three gold medals.\n\nParis joins London, England, at the top of the lists of cities to have hosted the Games three times.\n\nLondon did so in 1908, 1948, and 2012."
