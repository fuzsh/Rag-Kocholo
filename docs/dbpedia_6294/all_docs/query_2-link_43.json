        "text": "The starting lineups for the Paris Olympics cycling events are being finalised as nations go through the difficult process of filling their entry quotas with their best medal candidates.\n\nFind out who is racing at the Olympics in cycling below.\n\nCyclingnews is compiling a list of teams as they are announced for the cycling events, which begin with the individual time trial for men and women on July 27th and wrap up with track cycling through August 11th.\n\nThe biggest controversy in the selections so far has been the exclusion of defending men's road race champion Richard Carapaz from Ecuador's team. The country qualified only one position and awarded the entry to Jhonatan Narváez instead.\n\nFrance passed over Evita Muzic in their road team, selecting Juliette Labous, Audrey Cordon-Ragot, and Victoire Berteau over the Vuelta Femenina stage winner.\n\nFollowing the Tour de France, Tadej Pogačar withdrew from the Olympic selection for Slovenia.\n\nRoad Race - Men\n\nYacine Hamza
