        "text": "Our live coverage of the 11th day of the 2022 Winter Games is winding down, but we‚Äôre here to catch you up on the biggest moments of the day.\n\nA lot of the action in Beijing happened in overnight US hours ‚Äî so if you slept through it all, here‚Äôs what you need to know:\n\n‚õ∏ Russian skater earns top score in emotional return to the ice\n\nEmbattled teen skater Kamila Valieva is on to Thursday‚Äôs free skate medal event after posting the top score during Tuesday‚Äôs short program. Valieva, who only this week learned she‚Äôd be permitted to continue competing despite a December failed drug test, turned in an 82.16.\n\nValieva‚Äôs score was top in the field, and after finishing her program the 15-year-old Russian, broke into tears on the ice as the emotions of the past few days appeared to catch up with her.\n\nA controversial ruling by a top sports court has allowed Valieva to continue her pursuit of Olympic glory ‚Äî though said pursuit will undoubtedly be forced to bear the weight of incredible scrutiny and increased attention.\n\nAnd remember: The field in Thursday‚Äôs women‚Äôs free skate medal event will be larger than initially anticipated. Before today‚Äôs competition, the IOC changed the rules in case Valieva is ultimately disqualified ‚Äî 25 skaters will go through to the longer program on Thursday, one more than the usual 24.\n\nüõ¢Chinese skater ‚Äúadds oil‚Äù to rebound from early Olympic struggles\n\n‚ÄúAdd oil.‚Äù In English, the phrase is ‚Äî at best ‚Äî confusing, conjuring up ideas of either culinary guidance or automobile maintenance. But in Chinese the words were music to the ears of figure skater Zhu Yi.\n\n‚ÄúAdd oil‚Äù is the Chinese equivalent of ‚Äúgo go‚Äù ‚Äî and it‚Äôs just what Yi needed to hear as the 19-year-old took the Beijing ice Tuesday, where she landed all of her jumps and earned a satisfactory score of 53.44.\n\nA series of falls ‚Äî one in Sunday‚Äôs team short program, and two during Monday‚Äôs team free skate ‚Äî unleashed a fury on Chinese social media. But after solidly rebounding Tuesday, Yi allowed a smile to cross her face, appearing to appreciate the support she‚Äôd received from the loud crowd in attendance.\n\nUltimately, however, Yi‚Äôs skate was not strong enough to send her to the final, as she finished 27th overall and failed to qualify for Thursday‚Äôs medal event.\n\nü•á 2022 is already China‚Äôs top Winter Olympics effort\n\nChina has solidified it‚Äôs most-decorated Winter Olympics. With teen snowboarder Su Yiming earning gold in Tuesday‚Äôs big air event, the host nation now has six gold medals to its credit, passing the country‚Äôs previous high of five in 2010 in Vancouver.\n\nAt only 17 years old, Su is China‚Äôs youngest-ever Winter Olympic champ.\n\n‚õ∑ Chat with mom helps Eileen Gu earn skiing silver\n\nEileen Gu‚Äôs Olympic dreams were sinking fast. So the 18-year-old did what many teens might: she phoned home.\n\nAfter plummeting into 8th position, and with a podium finish seeming rather unlikely, the teen skiing sensation reached out to her mom.\n\n‚ÄúMy mum knows me very well and she knows the way my brain works with pressure,‚Äù said Gu, who spoke to her mom during the event.\n\n‚ÄúI talked to her after the first run. She was like: ‚ÄòPretend your second run is your third run, pretend you have no more chances.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nGu then put her mom‚Äôs advice into action, ripping off a remarkable final run, good enough to get her back into contention.\n\nShe‚Äôd ultimately earn silver in the women‚Äôs freeski slopestyle, proving once again, that ‚ÄúMom Knows Best.‚Äù\n\nWith just three pilots to go, Switzerland‚Äôs Michael Vogt sat in gold medal position for the two-man bobsled event.\n\nMere minutes later, he found himself finishing outside the podium places.\n\nFrancesco Friedrich and brakeman Thorsten Margis capped a historic day for Germany at the Yanqing National Sliding Centre, taking gold on the final run of the evening to secure a famous one-two-three finish for their country.\n\nIt is the first time in Winter Olympic history that a nation has swept the podium in a bobsled event.\n\nFriedrich‚Äôs time of 3:56.89 put him ahead of compatriots Johannes Lochner and Christoph Hafer in silver and bronze respectively.\n\nAfter the most unusual of pre-Games preparations, Friedrich reflected on a ‚Äúcrazy two weeks‚Äù heading into Beijing.\n\n‚ÄúWe have to wait and wait and wear every day the mask in every situation; eating fast, then the mask on,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúThen the competition start and we feel good, we know that we are good in pushing ‚Ä¶ I did it really good the first run, then in the second run, I make some mistakes which lose us time.\n\n‚ÄúIn the third run, we say we have to fight, we have to attack Hansi [Johannes Lochner] ‚Ä¶ we go, and it worked, we did it.‚Äù\n\nHaving won two golds in Pyeongchang four years ago, Friedrich‚Äôs triumph in Beijing pens another chapter in a glittering career of dominance ‚Äî with the potential to complete a never-before-seen double defense in the four-man event which begins on Saturday.\n\nThe 31-year-old Friedrich is a 13-time world champion across two-man, four-man and team events, cementing his place as the most decorated pilot in bobsledding world championship history and one of the greatest of all time.\n\nThe key to his success? Love what you do.\n\n‚ÄúI have the luck that what I do is my job,‚Äù Friedrich said. ‚ÄúI love that and it makes (it) so much fun, and it‚Äôs my daily job. I give all for that.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only a small time in our life, and we must use it 110% or you should do another thing.‚Äù\n\nThe women‚Äôs singles skating short program is underway at Beijing‚Äôs Capital Indoor Stadium, and all eyes are on the Russian Olympic Committee‚Äôs (ROC) Kamila Valieva, who is now warming up on the rink.\n\nAged just 15, the Russian figure skating star finds herself at the center of a doping scandal that has inflamed mistrust of the Russian athletic establishment, pressed sporting organizations and athletes around the world to call for reform, and seen the International Olympic Committee (IOC) postpone medal ceremonies for any event that could place Valieva on the podium.\n\nOfficials are still investigating whether Valieva or her entourage broke anti-doping rules, after a test she took in December was found to be positive for a banned substance.\n\nOn Tuesday, an IOC official said Valieva is blaming the doping violation ‚Äî in which she tested positive for a heart medication that experts say can improve stamina ‚Äî on contamination from her grandfather‚Äôs medication. Her coach, Eteri Tutberidze, told Russian state news agency Tass they are ‚Äúabsolutely sure‚Äù she is innocent.\n\nOn Monday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport cleared Valieva for participation in the women‚Äôs singles competition ‚Äî the question will now be if the 15-year-old can tune out the noise.\n\nOrdered 26th on the scheduling, Valieva is expected to be out on the ice around 8:52 a.m. ET or 9:52 p.m. local time and will perform to ‚ÄúIn Memoriam‚Äù by Russian composer Kirill Richter.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nChinese figure skater Zhu Yi bounced back from a torrent of social media criticism last week as she was cheered on to a solid showing in the short program of the individual event on Tuesday.\n\nThe 19-year-old was the subject of widespread vitriol on Chinese social media after a fall in the team short program last Sunday, and she broke down in tears the following day after falling twice during the team free skate to finish fifth for her routine.\n\nYet from the minute she took to the rink for her short program individual routine, Zhu received nothing but unyielding support from the crowd at Capital Indoor Stadium.\n\nHer entrance was welcomed by roaring applause and shouts of ‚Äúadd oil‚Äù ‚Äî the Chinese equivalent of ‚Äúgo go‚Äù ‚Äî according to CNN staff at the stadium.\n\nSkating to ‚ÄòPaint it Black,‚Äô the support continued unwavering as Zhu recovered from a wobbly opening jump to successfully land all her jumps in an altogether assured performance that was rewarded with a 53.44 score.\n\nA smiling Zhu waved happily at the camera and received more applause at the announcement of a result which leaves her ranked 12th of 15 at the time of writing.\n\nZhu needs to place in the top 25 of the field of 30 to qualify for the free skating final on Thursday.\n\nTypically, it is only the top 24 that progress, but this has been changed due to the ongoing doping scandal surrounding the Russian Olympic Committee‚Äôs (ROC) Kamila Valieva.\n\nThe 15-year-old figure skater ‚Äî who was found to have tested positive for a banned substance in December ‚Äî is slated to perform as the 26th competitor and is expected to be out on the ice around 8:52 a.m. ET or 9:52 p.m. local time.\n\nAthletes train their entire careers for a shot at winning Olympic gold.\n\nBut for every moment of glory for one athlete, there is often a moment of misfortune for another.\n\nOn Tuesday, Japan‚Äôs speed skaters were unfortunately on the receiving end of heartbreak.\n\nWith Japan leading Canada in the team pursuit final and seemingly on course to be crowned Olympic champions, Nana Takagi got one of her blades caught in the ice on the final corner, causing her to fall and crash into the barriers.\n\n‚ÄúTo be honest, I was in an excellent mood (before the race),‚Äù Takagi said. ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôm going to complete my best skate in the past one and a half weeks, together with my sister (Miho).\n\n‚ÄúMy mind hasn‚Äôt recovered from the fall. It‚Äôs hard for me to think or talk about it right now.‚Äù\n\nBut despite that heartbreak, the Japanese skaters still embodied the Olympic spirit.\n\nAfter the race, as a crestfallen Nana cried at the side of the track, her teammate and sister Miho immediately went over to console her.\n\n‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt find any words to tell her at that moment,‚Äù Miho said. ‚ÄúI just wanted to be close to her and give her a hug.\n\n‚ÄúIn this event, to fall, we understand the pressure will be on. We cannot turn it around, we cannot change it. That is frustrating.\n\n‚ÄúYou may feel they should not be held responsible, but that skater who falls will feel guilty. So I knew I had these mixed feelings and that is why I hugged my sister,‚Äù Miho said.\n\n‚ÄúWe did what we can. We made plans together on how to skate faster (and) we were confident in skating our best.\n\n‚ÄúEnding the race with a fall just made it hard to judge our performance, but still I think we raced our best.‚Äù\n\nThe third skater on the team, Ayano Sato, said she had ‚Äúmixed feelings of regret and joy.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf we focus only on the result, as we were aiming for a gold medal, it‚Äôs just disappointing.\n\n‚Äú[But] the time we spend together thinking about how to deliver our best performance, how to skate even faster, this time itself is priceless to me.‚Äù\n\nEileen Gu‚Äôs medal hopes did not look promising after two runs of the women‚Äôs freeski slopestyle event at Genting Snow Park.\n\nDuring her second run, Gu had fallen backwards off the rail, a mistake which had plunged her to eighth position and with a distant chance at a second medal of Beijing 2022 after winning gold in the big air event.\n\nAs the poster child for a new type of Chinese athlete and one with sky-high aspirations ‚Äî Gu has been candid that she hoped to win medals in all three of the events she was competing in ‚Äî the pressure was mounting on the 18-year-old‚Äôs shoulders.\n\nSo Gu did what many teenagers do in times of need: she talked to her mom.\n\n‚ÄúMy mom knows me very well and she knows the way my brain works with pressure. I‚Äôve done a lot of work, read a lot of psychology books, did a lot of research on my own brain to see how I deal with pressure. And now, we know that I perform well under it.\n\n‚ÄúSo in the first round, in the second round, I wasn‚Äôt fully in the zone, if that makes sense. I wasn‚Äôt in that headspace.\n\n‚ÄúAnd my mom could see that, so I talked to her after the first run. She was like: ‚ÄòPretend your second run is your third run, pretend you have no more chances.‚Äô I was like: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm trying,‚Äô but I guess my imagination is not that good.‚Äù\n\nAnd as the saying goes, mother knows best ‚Äî Gu produced a stunning final run to surge back into the medal hunt, eventually finishing with a silver just 0.3 points behind gold medalist Mathilde Gremaud.\n\nRead more about how Gu‚Äôs mother helped her win her second medal of the Games here.\n\nJ√∏rgen Graabak chased down the leading pack to take home a brilliant gold medal for Norway in the men‚Äôs individual large hill/10km Nordic combined in a time of 27:13.3.\n\nThere was a tense race between four skiers down the finishing straight, with Graabak just pipping teammate Jens Lur√•s Oftebro on the line by 0.4 seconds.\n\nOftebro‚Äôs silver made it a Norwegian one-two, with Japan‚Äôs Akito Watabe taking home bronze.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what dreams are made of. It‚Äôs unreal to be honest, I can‚Äôt quite believe it,‚Äù said Graabak. ‚ÄúI have to see the replay first. It‚Äôs hard to believe, but of course, I‚Äôm really happy.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt demanded everything I‚Äôve got, so I‚Äôm really, really tired at the moment. It was a really tough race, starting over two minutes behind. I didn‚Äôt think it was possible. It‚Äôs unreal, I don‚Äôt know what to say.‚Äù\n\nGerman Manuel Faisst was the unfortunate skier to come in fourth after a grueling battle.\n\nEarlier in the race, Norway‚Äôs Jarl Magnus Riiber had perhaps one of the Winter Olympics‚Äô biggest nightmares.\n\nLeading by more than 40 seconds after his performance in the ski jump portion of the event, Riiber took a wrong turn and headed down the home straight prematurely ‚Äî instead, he should have taken the other turn to begin his second lap.\n\nRiiber had to turn around and ski the wrong way up the finishing straight to go back and begin his second lap, which cost him the entire lead he‚Äôd built up. He eventually finished eighth.\n\nRiiber was only allowed out of isolation yesterday after a positive Covid test and perhaps hadn‚Äôt had the time to scope out the course.\n\nAlthough its exact origins can‚Äôt be accurately traced, curling is a sport believed to have originated in the 16th century.\n\nPaintings from Flemish artist Pieter Bruegel appear to portray an activity similar to curling being played on frozen ponds.\n\nIn 1540, John McQuhin ‚Äî a notary in Paisley, Scotland ‚Äî appeared to produce the first written evidence of curling.\n\nWritten in Latin, McQuhin recorded in his book a challenge between John Sclater, a monk in Paisley Abbey, and Gavin Hamilton, a representative of the Abbot. It said that Sclater threw a stone along the ice three times and asserted that he was ready for the agreed contest.\n\nWhile an exact date can‚Äôt be pinpointed, according to the World Curling Federation, the sport was played during its early stages on frozen lochs and ponds in northern Europe.\n\nIt became popular across the world as emigrating Scots introduced curling to countries with similar climates.\n\nThe first official rules of curling were drawn up in Scotland and adopted by the Grand Caledonian Curling Club ‚Äî which became the sport‚Äôs governing body ‚Äî in 1838.\n\nThe Club was renamed to the Royal Caledonian Curling Club in 1843 after Queen Victoria took a liking to curling after a demonstration on the ballroom floor of Scone Palace.\n\nAlthough international curling matches have been recorded since the 19th century, the first official international matches took place at the first Winter Olympics in 1924 in Chamonix, France. Great Britain defeated Sweden and France in what was retroactively accepted as curling‚Äôs Olympic debut.\n\nCurling was also a demonstration sport at the 1932 Winter Games, and later on in 1988 and 1992. This designation meant the sport wasn‚Äôt played for medal competition.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt until 1998 that the International Olympic Committee granted medal status to men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs curling. It was introduced to the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan and has gone on to be a popular inclusion to the Games.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nNorway completely dominated the men‚Äôs speed skating team pursuit final, leading the Russian Olympic Committee from start to finish to win gold.\n\nThe Norwegians opened up a 0.26 second gap over their opponents in the opening lap and it was a lead they never looked like relinquishing, eventually finishing a whopping 2.27 seconds clear.\n\nAfterwards, the team expressed their elation and relief for their achievement.\n\n‚ÄúIt is a lot to take in, it‚Äôs incredible. It is what we have worked for together with this team,‚Äù said Peder Kongshaug.\n\nHallgeir Engebr√•ten added, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs everything. It is something special to take a gold medal with the team. We have had our ups and downs. To be able to stand here as a trio, as Olympic champions, that‚Äôs just amazing.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt means everything. I had a hard summer with almost no training (from a bike crash in May 2021),‚Äù said Sverre Lunde Pedersen. ‚ÄúTo be here with a gold medal, it‚Äôs hard to describe. Russia beat us pretty well in the semifinal. Our plan was to go for it and it worked. We skated faster in the final. It was perfect.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs Norway‚Äôs 11th gold medal of Beijing 2022, cementing the country‚Äôs place at the top of the medal table.\n\nIn the B Final, the US beat the Netherlands to take the bronze.\n\nChinese snowboarder Su Yiming said there‚Äôs no controversy after the head judge for Olympic snowboarding admitted to missing an error made by eventual slopestyle gold medalist Max Parrot.\n\nThe 17-year-old Su won silver in the event last Monday but could have left with gold had judges not missed Canada‚Äôs Parrot grabbing his knee ‚Äî rather than his board ‚Äî during a jump on his pivotal second run.\n\nIn an interview with snowboarding website Whitelines the following day, head judge Iztok Sumatic explained that the judges did not see a camera angle that clearly showed the mistake and ‚Äî ‚Äúpushed for time‚Äù ‚Äî put the scores up.\n\nHaving only seen the angle TV viewers saw after the score had been processed, Sumatic likened the situation to the infamous Diego Maradona ‚ÄòHand of God‚Äô goal against England at the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\n\nSumatic admitted that the scores would have been ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù had the error been seen, but maintained that Parrot still showcased an ‚Äúinsane run‚Äù regardless of the controversial jump.\n\nSpeaking after his big air gold medal triumph on Tuesday, Su said there ‚Äúhas been no controversy‚Äù following the slopestyle incident.\n\n‚ÄúWe [Parrot and I] came to the Olympic Games out of our same passion for snowboarding. I know he is also quite hardworking, and I respect him a lot.\n\n‚ÄúI would like to congratulate him on his gold medal in the men‚Äôs snowboard slopestyle and today‚Äôs great result (bronze). I‚Äôm happy for both of us.‚Äù\n\nSu‚Äôs big air win saw him become his country‚Äôs youngest Winter Olympic champion and secured China‚Äôs sixth gold of Beijing 2022 ‚Äî already topping their previous record of five at Vancouver 12 years ago.\n\n‚ÄúI had many dreams when I was a child,‚Äù Su said. ‚ÄúTo be an Olympic champion was one of them, and today, I already realized my dream.\n\n‚ÄúThere will be more and more challenges in the future. I will be more concentrated on my goals. All I need to do is to deliver all my efforts to achieve my goals.‚Äù\n\nCanada won the women‚Äôs speed skating team pursuit in dramatic fashion, as a Japanese skater slipped and crashed on the final corner with her team leading.\n\nJapan were ahead by 0.32 seconds going into the final half-lap and seemingly on course to be crowned Olympic champions, but Nana Takagi got one of her blades caught in the ice, causing her to fall and slide into the barriers.\n\nWith the clock only stopping when the third of the three skaters crosses the line, that meant Canada snatched the gold medal at the very last moment and broke the Olympic record in the process.\n\n‚ÄúIt feels really surreal right now. There is such high emotion. Going into the race we wanted to make ourselves proud,‚Äù Valerie Maltais said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt want to put pressure on ourselves, it is a privilege to be in this final. Coming across the line, I just couldn‚Äôt believe it.‚Äù\n\nIsabelle Weidemann added: ‚ÄúWe are still thinking, is this real? We knew we had a strong team, we knew we could put pressure on Japan and all the other strong teams today. I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôd thought about this possible outcome.‚Äù\n\nAs the shocked Canadian skaters celebrated their victory, the three Japanese skaters ‚Äî Takagi in particular ‚Äî were inconsolable on the other side of the track.\n\nIn the B Final, the Netherlands ‚Äî who would have been expecting to reach the A Final and compete for gold ‚Äî beat the Russian Olympic Committee to win bronze.\n\nNorway won gold in a dramatic finish in the men‚Äôs biathlon 4x7.5km relay on Tuesday, with a time of 1:19:50.2.\n\nThe Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) looked primed to take gold after taking a commanding lead in the race but Eduard Latypov missed four of his five shots to end their gold medals hopes.\n\n‚ÄúI am also disappointed and I ask for forgiveness that this happened. We fought for the gold and we were not able to do it,‚Äù Latypov told reporters after the race. ‚ÄúWe all wanted it and the guys did everything that they could to achieve this and on my leg, it did not work out.‚Äù\n\nLatypov‚Äôs costly slip-up allowed Vetle Sj√•stad Christiansen to swoop in and claim the win for Norway.\n\n‚ÄúIt was such high pressure. It was the perfect race for me. I was completely blacked out or I don‚Äôt remember anything, but I woke up and we‚Äôd won the gold medal,‚Äù Christiansen said.\n\n‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt look so good after 50% of the race, but anything was possible at that point,‚Äù Norway‚Äôs Tarjei B√∏ said after the race.\n\nSturla Holm L√¶greid‚Äôs poor first leg looked to take Norway out of gold contention, but Latypov‚Äôs mistakes allowed for redemption.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been very emotional. When you think you messed up the relay and the gold is out of reach and you just wish you gave it your best and when you know you‚Äôre performing at the lower level, it‚Äôs just very hard ‚Äî especially in the Olympics, when you‚Äôre disappointing your teammates,‚Äù L√¶greid said.\n\n‚ÄúBut when it was gold in the end, I was just so happy and I couldn‚Äôt hold my tears back.‚Äù\n\nWith France‚Äôs silver, Quentin Fillon Maillet makes history as the first biathlete to win five medals in a single Games. According to Beijing 2022, he is also the first male Winter Olympian to win five medals in a single Games since Lake Placid 1980.\n\nThe Russian Olympic Committee clinched bronze.\n\nFounding president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), Dick Pound, said it could be ‚Äútime for a time-out for Russia in the Olympics‚Äù following the drugs scandal surrounding 15-year-old figure skater Kamila Valieva.\n\nOn Monday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled Valieva could continue competing in Beijing, despite testing positive for a banned heart medication in a sample from December.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, the [Russian] government cannot explain why nobody will play with them. And the answer is, it‚Äôs because you cheat.‚Äù\n\nSome background: Monday‚Äôs decision from CAS only determined whether Valieva could still take part in the Beijing Games.\n\nThe IOC has made it clear that her case ‚Äî and the people surrounding her ‚Äî will continue to be investigated long after the closing ceremony.\n\nRussian athletes are prohibited from competing in the Olympics Games under their country‚Äôs flag due to sanctions imposed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA because of the country‚Äôs ‚Äúsystemic manipulation‚Äù of anti-doping rules during the 2014 Sochi Games.\n\nPound, who is also a former vice-president of the IOC, said the punishments the ROC faced since Sochi have been ‚Äúlenient‚Äù and ineffective, and banning the team from competition would get Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúattention.‚Äù\n\nChina‚Äôs Eileen Gu took silver in the freeski slopstyle event on Tuesday, a week after winning gold in the big air, saying it feels ‚Äúso, so special.‚Äù\n\nGu was under huge pressure to nail her third run after falling backward off the rail in her second ‚Äî a costly mistake that plunged her into eighth place.\n\nJust like she did at last week‚Äôs big air finals, Gu managed to come back with a stunning performance that landed her in second place. On Weibo, China‚Äôs social media platform, fans pointed at her ability to keep calm and overcome pressure.\n\nGu said her goal coming into the Olympics was to win one gold and podium in another event. Gu is also competing in the freeski half pipe competition.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve already met that goal and I‚Äôm going into my strongest event. Feeling really good right now and super excited to see what the next couple of days bring,‚Äù she said.\n\nHowever, her ‚Äúbiggest goal‚Äù is to inspire young girls in China and worldwide to get into skiing,‚Äù she said.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a joke‚Äù that Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva is being allowed to compete in the Winter Olympics after failing a drug test, American former Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon told CNN.\n\nRippon also compared Valieva‚Äôs situation to that of Team USA‚Äôs Sha‚ÄôCarri Richardson, who was banned from the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics after a positive marijuana test ‚Äî calling it a ‚Äúdouble standard.‚Äù\n\nValieva, 15, is at the center of a drugs controversy after providing a positive test for a banned heart medication in December. Yesterday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport gave her the green light to compete anyway.\n\nRippon said the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC), which Valieva competes for, should be kicked out of the Olympics.\n\nRippon said the Russians have ‚Äúrepeatedly shown that they don‚Äôt want to play by the rules.‚Äù\n\nComparing it to his own experience, Rippon ‚Äî who won bronze in the team event at Pyeongchang 2018 ‚Äî said he was scared to even take a multivitamin when he was competing.\n\n‚ÄúDouble standard‚Äù: On Monday, Richardson questioned on Twitter why Valieva was allowed to continue competing, months after a positive test for cannabis derailed her own Olympic dreams.\n\nRippon said there was a ‚Äúdouble standard‚Äù in how the two cases were handled.\n\n‚Äú[Richardson‚Äôs] a young black woman. We all wanted to cheer for her. Her personality is amazing. She‚Äôs an incredible athlete. She tested positive for marijuana. Immediately you saw ‚Ä¶ the US anti-doping agencies said you can‚Äôt compete. She was on TV the next day, apologizing, taking accountability,‚Äù Rippon said.\n\nIn Valieva‚Äôs case, the Russian doping agency first suspended her and then lifted the provisional ban after an appeal from the teenage skater.\n\nAll eyes will be on Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva on Tuesday as she takes to the ice after being cleared to compete despite a failed drugs test.\n\nHere‚Äôs what to watch today:\n\nRussian star cleared to skate: Figure skater Kamila Valieva will compete in the women‚Äôs single skating short program after being given the green light from the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The 15-year-old is favorite to win gold, but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Valieva won‚Äôt feature in any medal ceremonies. The athlete plans to skate to ‚ÄúIn Memoriam‚Äù by Kirill Richter and attempt a triple axel as well as a triple flip in her program.\n\nHome favorite goes for gold: China‚Äôs Eileen Gu is through to the women‚Äôs freeski slopestyle final, but needed a strong finish to book her spot after a slow start to qualifying. ‚ÄúQuali‚Äôs are way more nerve-wracking than finals,‚Äù the Chinese star said after posting a 79.38 best score on Monday. The 18-year-old has already won big air gold at her home Games.\n\nSkater returns after barrage of abuse: California-born Chinese figure skater Zhu Yi, who faced a torrent of social media criticism after she fell on the ice while performing in the team competition, will compete in the women‚Äôs single skating short program. After her fall, the hashtag ‚ÄúZhu Yi has fallen‚Äù was viewed more than 200 million times within hours on social media platform Weibo, before apparently being censored.\n\nDownhill double gold bid: Italy‚Äôs Sofia Goggia is aiming to become only the second woman to win back-to-back Olympic golds in women‚Äôs downhill after a hurried return from injury. Switzerland‚Äôs Corrine Suter and Austrians Ramona Siebenhofer and Mirjam Puchner will also fancy their chances today, while American Mikaela Shiffrin will be aiming to make up for the disappointment of failing to finish in her favored events.\n\nNew Zealander fights for second gold: Zoi Sadowski-Synnott will jump for another Olympic medal in the big air final after executing her last leap to near-perfection in qualifying. The New Zealander, 20, cruised through as top qualifier. She won her first gold in slopestyle ‚Äî New Zealand‚Äôs first in 70 years of competing at the Winter Olympics.\n\nMen‚Äôs big air battle: Canadian Max Parrot could win his second gold of the Games after topping the big air qualifying standings as his compatriot and defending champion, Sebastien Toutant, failed to advance after a crash. Chinese teen Su Yiming and decorated snowboarder Mark McMorris also reached the final. Home favorite Su earned the best single score in Monday‚Äôs competition, much to the delight of the crowd. Japan‚Äôs Takeru Otsuka, who delivered one of the most technical runs in his last attempt, finished second in qualifying, with Team USA‚Äôs Red Gerard in third.\n\nSkier eyes double gold: Norway‚Äôs Birk Ruud is looking to win his second Olympic gold medal at Beijing 2022 when the men‚Äôs freeski slopestyle begins today. Ruud won the inaugural freeski big air and is aiming to become the first man to win the Olympic slopestyle/big air double.\n\nA drugs test controversy that has overshadowed Beijing 2022 is set to rumble on after the Winter Olympics finishes.\n\nFor now, teenage figure skater Kamila Valieva has won a temporary reprieve ‚Äî the 15-year-old gets to compete in the women‚Äôs single skating competition on Tuesday.\n\nBut, if she wins this week, there will be no gold medal ceremony or bouquet of flowers to hold and when she heads back to Russia, Valieva will enter a bureaucratic limbo as different sporting and doping organizations contest the implications of the skater‚Äôs positive test for the banned heart drug trimetazidine, which is commonly used to treat people with angina.\n\nOn Monday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that Valieva can compete for the remainder of this year‚Äôs Winter Games, despite testing positive for a prohibited substance ahead of Beijing 2022.\n\nThe Valieva controversy has reignited doubts about the Olympic movement‚Äôs handling of Russian athletes competing at successive Games, but also the oversight of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and its working relationship with the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC), International Skating Union (ISU) and WADA had all called on CAS to reinstate a suspension Valieva was given by RUSADA over a doping violation concerning a test sample taken in December.\n\nIn a statement, CAS said it had decided Valieva should be allowed to compete due to ‚Äúexceptional circumstances,‚Äù including specific provisions linked to her status as a ‚Äúprotected person‚Äù under the WADA code, because she is a minor.\n\nThe CAS also noted Valieva did not test positive during the Winter Olympics. In making the decision the panel considered ‚Äúfundamental principles of fairness, proportionality, irreparable harm,‚Äù a statement said.\n\nRead more:"
