        "text": "Lin’s victory meant she joined Imane Khelif in reaching the final at their ­respective weights after the Algerian thrashed Thailand’s Janjaem Suwannapheng on Tuesday in the -66kg ­category.\n\nThe nature of this victory was ­emphatic too, with Lin, the No 1 seed, sweeping the three rounds on all five of the judges’ scorecards on Court ­Philippe-Chatrier at Roland Garros.\n\nThe strength difference was not as stark here as in Khelif’s bout, with ­Yildiz the aggressor throughout. But her attacks were wild and her defence was vulnerable, with Lin consistently piercing ­Yildiz’s guard with sharp ­counters off the ropes.\n\nYildiz remained undeterred and they exchanged gung-ho punches in the centre of the ring early in the second. Lin’s work was cleaner, although she was caught by a lead right hand that elicited gasps from the crowd. When Lin responded by landing a punch on the back of her opponent’s head, those briefly turned to boos.\n\nIt had little influence on the outcome, though, with Lin superior in all facets. Yildiz appeared to lower the ropes in the Taipei corner in a gesture of respect to her opponent after the verdict was announced but then made the XX gesture in protest in the centre of the ring.\n\nThe International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday repeated allegations that Lin and Khelif both failed a gender eligibility test because of the presence of certain chromosomes at the World Boxing Championships in March last year, but the IOC has described the process as “wholly flawed”.\n\nKhelif is undefeated in 12 bouts since her results at those World Championships were annulled. Lin has lost only once in eight bouts. Both are ­overwhelming favourites to take gold.\n\nMatt Lawton & Rick Broadbent: The world-record holder Lamecha Girma suffered a horrific fall during the 3000m steeplechase. The Ethiopian struck his head after tumbling over a hurdle and lay on the track where medics attended.\n\nThe French newspaper L’Equipe reported that the 23-year-old had been initially knocked out before leaving the track on a stretcher, but has since regained consciousness. He has since been taken to hospital, where he is being assessed for head injuries.\n\nMorocco’s Soufiane El Bakkali, the USA’s Kenneth Rooks and Kenya’s Abraham Kibiwot took the medals, but thoughts are all with Girma.\n\nRick Broadbent: A lot of people leave the Olympics with a lot of what ifs. Matthew Hudson-Smith is one after becoming the fifth fastest man in history and still not getting the gold. He gave it everything though.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum Molly Caudery must be looking at the pole vault final and wondering. Australia’s Nina Kennedy won gold with a season’s best mark of 4.90 metres, the same height that got her a share of World Championship gold last year. Katie Moon, of the USA, takes silver with 4.85m with Canada’s Alysha Newman taking bronze.\n\nCaudery remains the best in the world this year in terms of heights reached with 4.92m. Right height, wrong place.\n\nTeam GB may have already won an impressive 12 golds in Paris so far, but here is how close they have come to increasing that number.\n\nAdam Peaty (Swimming, 100m breaststroke) — 0.02sec\n\nMatthew Richards (Swimming, 200m freestyle) — 0.02sec\n\nBen Proud (Swimming, 50m freestyle) — 0.05sec\n\nWomen’s coxless four — 0.18sec\n\nAmber Rutter (Skeet shooting) — lost in a shoot-off\n\nTommy Fleetwood (Golf) — lost by one shot\n\nJosh Kerr (Athletics) 1,500m — 0.14sec\n\nMatthew Hudson-Smith (Athletics) 400m — 0.04sec\n\n1896 Charles Gmelin (bronze)\n\n1908 Wyndham Halswelle (gold)\n\n1920 Guy Butler (silver)\n\n1924 Eric Liddell (gold), Guy Butler (bronze)\n\n1936 Godfrey Brown (silver)\n\n1964 Ann Packer (silver)\n\n1968 Lillian Board (silver)\n\n1984 Kathy Smallwood-Cook (bronze)\n\n1996 Roger Black (silver)\n\n2000 Katharine Merry (bronze)\n\n2008 Christine Ohuruogu (gold)\n\n2012 Christine Ohuruogu (silver)\n\n2024 Matthew Hudson-Smith (silver)\n\nMatthew Hudson-Smith has to settle for silver after being pipped by Quincy Hall of the United States right at the end.\n\nThe British athlete had been leading on the home straight and looked like he was on course to take gold, but the American came from nowhere to snatch it from him by running a personal best of 43.40sec.\n\nHudson-Smith finished only 0.04sec behind, breaking his own European record. Muzala Samukonga, from Zambia, takes bronze.\n\nMatthew Hudson-Smith is just moments away from taking to the track for the men’s 400m final, which is set to get under way in about five minutes.\n\nWe have just seen the semi-finals of the women’s event, where Team GB’s Amber Anning ran a personal best of 49.47sec to advance.\n\nElgan Alderman: Vinesh Phogat was disqualified from an Olympic wrestling final for missing her target weight despite starving herself and cutting off her hair, much to the despair of India’s prime minister.\n\nPhogat, 29, qualified for the final in the 50kg category, having weighed in successfully before her Wednesday bouts. The run to the final included a historic victory over Yui Susaki, the defending champion. Her weight-cutting routine involves eating no food, exercising and spending hours in the sauna. On her two previous Olympic appearances, she competed in the 48kg and 53kg category.\n\nWhen it came to the final, however, Phogat was 100g too heavy and was disqualified without a medal. Cuba’s Yusneylys Guzmán, who lost to Phogat in the semi-finals, has taken her place against Sarah Hildebrandt of the United States. Phogat was disqualified and will not win a medal.\n\nDinshaw Paudiwala, the chief medical officer of the India team, said Phogat was set to shed 1.5kg. “Vinesh had three bouts, and hence, small amounts of water had to be given to prevent dehydration,” he said. “Her post-participation weight was found to be increased. The coach initiated the normal process of weight cut that he has always employed with Vinesh and felt confident that it would be achieved.\n\n“All possible drastic measures, including cutting off her hair, were used. However, she was not below her allowed weight of 50kg.\n\n“As a precautionary measure, Vinesh was administered IV fluids following disqualification to prevent dehydration. We are also getting blood tests performed at the local hospital to ensure that all is well. All of Vinesh’s parameters were normal throughout this process, and she feels perfectly well.”\n\nThe Indian Olympic Association has protested against the decision, on the instruction of Narendra Modi, the country’s prime minister. Politicians in India have called for an investigation into the incident.\n\nRick Broadbent: Noah Lyles returned to his new favourite stadium and, to the surprise of absolutely nobody, took it slacker-easy in his 200m heat. He gets beaten by Letsile Tebogo who finishes in 19.96sec, with Lyles clocking 20.08sec.\n\nKenneth Bednarek looks smooth once again to win his semi-final, while the third American, Erriyon Knighton, also wins his race. Of course, having three semi-finals is awkward for those of us who are not very good at fractions in the first place. Let’s hope they sort it out by 2028.\n\nAnyway, big names missing out include Wayde van Niekerk and the 2021 Olympic champion Andre de Grasse.\n\nMore good news for Team GB at velodrome, with Jack Carlin and Hamish Turnbull both advancing to the quarter-finals of the men’s sprint.\n\nCarlin, who won bronze in this event three years ago, narrowly beat Trinidad and Tobago’s Nicholas Paul won by 0.004 seconds to advance while Turnbull defeated Israel’s Mikhail Yakovlev by an even closer margin of 0.001.\n\nThe United States, who set narrowly defeated Great Britain in the previous round, have beaten New Zealand to win gold in the women’s team pursuit.\n\nThe US team consists of Jennifer Valente, Lily Williams, Chloe Dygert and Kristen Faulkner.\n\nAnother medal for Team GB in the velodrome as they beat Italy to take bronze in the women’s team pursuit!\n\nThings weren’t looking good for the British quartet in the first half of the race, with the Italians taking a sizeable lead, but they were able to reel them in and, in the end, claimed a comfortable win by over two seconds.\n\nEthan Hayter has been speaking to BBC TV after he appeared to come off his saddle as Team GB missed out on gold to Australia in the team pursuit final:\n\n“We were so close and I could see it. It was nearly five laps at the end and I just really gave too much, and my whole body went weak and I really struggled to hold myself on the bike in the end.\n\n“Sorry to the guys but I think we gave everything and we can be proud of that silver medal.\n\n“It was really there for the taking for us and we kind of knew that. We went out to get it but just came short in the end, so it’s a shame.”\n\nJohn Westerby: Great Britain’s men lost a dramatic final of the team pursuit when an error on the final lap forced Ethan Hayter off course, handing victory to Australia in a desperately tense race. The British team had been fighting hard to make up 0.17sec over the final 500 metres of the 4km race when Hayter appeared to touch wheels with a team-mate and came off his saddle, ensuring that the Australians would not be overhauled.\n\nBut the velodrome is once again proving productive for the British team, with three medals in as many events, a second silver added to a similar result for the men’s team sprint, and the gold for the women’s team sprint on Monday.\n\nIt marks Team GB’s 1,000th medal across both summer and winter Olympics. The number doesn’t include medals won in arts competitions in Games between 1920-1948.\n\nItaly have just beaten Denmark to take bronze in the men’s team pursuit and the Team GB quartet are now taking to the track.\n\nThey are facing Australia with gold going to the winner.\n\nKeegan Palmer has claimed gold for Australia in the men’s park final.\n\nThe 21-year-old successfully defended the Olympic title he won in Tokyo three years ago with a score of 93.11 in his first run that no other competitor was able to match.\n\nTom Schaar, of the United States, came closest with a score of 92.23 in his second run to take silver and Brazil’s Augusto Akio won bronze.\n\nAttention now turns back to the velodrome, where Great Britain are looking to add two more medals to their haul tonight in the team pursuit.\n\nThe men are up first and are guaranteed a medal when they take on Australia for the gold at 5.33pm.\n\nTeam GB will then have the chance to claim bronze in the women’s event when they face Italy at 6.17pm.\n\nCraig Lord: Eleventh-hour uncertainty over when and where the Olympic 10km swim marathons will be raced here in Paris continue to dog athletes and coaches, who complained that years of professional preparation could be washed away by “amateur” planning.\n\nThe women’s race is scheduled to start at 7.30am — but swimmers, coaches and the media will not find out whether it will go ahead until 4am. The men’s race is due to start at the same time on Friday, but again, whether it takes place will be decided by 3.30am water tests.\n\nThe level of bugs such as E.coli in the river has been too high for several days, but organisers are confident that the fine weather will tip readings far enough in the right direction to get the green light tomorrow morning.\n\nA source close to the process told The Times that in the event of bad news from the laboratory the women’s race would be postponed, in the hope of Friday bringing better results. This would allow the 24 women and 31 men to race either together or apart on one of the last three days of the Games, which close on Sunday.\n\nAn exasperated member of a team with two medal hopes in the marathons told The Times on condition of anonymity: “It’s the Olympics! Are there other events where you get to know where and in what conditions you’ll get to swim in a couple of hours before lining up without any chance of testing those conditions out?\n\n“We work with the kids for years getting them used to the variables that they can face in the marathon. It’s a great setting in the Seine but it’ll be the first time any of these swimmers have taken on a river swim — and one with a strong tidal flow too. It just feels like our professionalism is up against an amateur plan that relies on a last-minute test of water quality that will decide all the things we need to know and prepare for well in advance, like what day, what kind of waters… simple stuff like that.”\n\nElgan Alderman: A rubbish opening day for Team GB at Le Golf National. A sizeable hill to climb for Hull and Hall.\n\nCharley Hull carded a nine-over 81 in one of the early groups. Only the two golfers from Finland, Ursula Wikstrom and Noora Komulainen, performed worse. The world No11 is known for smoking on the course, a habit she says helps ease her ADHD, but smoking is not permitted at any Olympic venues. Hull, who was vaping instead, said her poor form was down to a shoulder injury, caused by a fall in the shower, that has kept her off the course over recent weeks. “I feel a bit rusty,” Hull said. “It’s been five weeks since I’ve last played properly a four-day event. Hopefully, I’ve got the rust off me.”\n\nGeorgia Hall was a late starter but fared little better, with 74. Ireland’s Leona Maguire was also way off the lead on six over. Nelly Korda is on evens and ahead of her are 11 players under par, the best of them by some margin France’s Céline Boutier, who leads on seven under. Lilia Vu, the world No2 from the United States, is poised on two under in a small group, the gap to Boutier bridged by South Africa’s Ashleigh Buhai on four under.\n\nThe final of the men’s park skateboarding is going on right now, with Australia’s Keegan Palmer leading after the first run thanks to a score of 93.11.\n\nGreat Britain’s Andy Macdonald, 51, had been involved in the prelims earlier in the day, but his score of 77.66 was not enough to send him through.\n\n• Read more: Andy Macdonald: Lessons in being a ‘rad dad’ from Team GB’s skateboarder\n\nElgan Alderman writes Sailing alert! There is some wind, just about enough for dinghies on water, as the programme approaches its conclusion tomorrow. Sadly for Team GB, it doesn’t make much difference to the medal table whether there is a zephyr or not.\n\nMichael Beckett was fourth going into the medal race of the men’s dinghy and needed to get some distance between him and Peru’s Stefano Peschiera. It did not go as hoped, and Beckett was last in the finale to finish sixth overall, with Peschiera content to mark him and finish just in front to take the bronze. Australia’s Matt Wearn held on to gold ahead of Cyprus’s Pavlos Kontides.\n\nThat is six of ten events complete and Britain have only one bronze to their name. Even that wasn’t as good as expected, with Emma Wilson dominating the opening series of the iQFOiL but finishing last in the final.\n\nJohn Westerby writes: It will be a bronze medal at best this evening for Great Britain’s women in the team pursuit after they were beaten by United States in their semi-final. Anna Morris, Elinor Barker, Josie Knight and Jess Roberts finished their 4km in 4min 4.908sec, which was a new British record, but some 0.279sec adrift of the Americans. The British quartet will face Italy in the bronze medal match this evening, with the US facing New Zealand for gold.\n\nA bronze medal would be a noble effort for the British, whose plans were thrown into disarray six weeks ago by the injury that ruled out Katie Archibald, the de facto team leader. With Archibald on board, the British were world champions last year, ahead of New Zealand, but the Kiwis have been the quickest team in Paris.\n\nJohn Westerby writes: Another small step for Emma Finucane, convincingly taken as she qualified with comfort from the first round of the keirin. After winning gold in the team sprint, the bunch sprint event is the second leg of her attempt to win a hat-trick of golds.\n\nMuch can go wrong in both the keirin and the individual sprint, but in her heat Finucane hit the front with just under two laps remaining and managed to stay out in front, ahead of Lea Friedrich, of Germany, progressing to the quarter-finals tomorrow. Katy Marchant will have to go again in the repechage to earn her place, finishing third in her heat.\n\nRick Broadbent writes: In the second heat of the men’s 5,000m, Jakob Ingebrigtsen returned from his 1,500m disappointment the previous night to win, but he was struck an angry tone as a cameraman ambled across the track just in front of the entire field.\n\n“It’s amateurish and should not happen at the Olympics,” he told Norwegian media. “It happened on a curve and I was behind enough to avoid it. It’s a big camera. I guess he realised it quite quickly, but the damage was already done. In the worst case, the runners get the race destroyed. The worst case for all of us is there will be a larger field in the final.”\n\nJohn Westerby writes: I won’t say we’re getting World Record Fatigue in the velodrome… but they’re certainly coming thick and fast. Well, fast, anyway. Another one has bitten the dust in the flying 200m, the qualifier for the men’s individual sprint. The riders build up to their single lap – ie with a ‘flying’ rather than standing start – and then sprint hell for leather against the clock.\n\nMatthew Richardson, of Australia, was the first to set a new world best, lowering the previous record of 9.100sec to 9.091sec. He became a former world record holder a few minutes later, when Harrie Lavreysen, one of the Dutch trio who won the men’s team sprint last night, shaved off another 0.003sec.\n\nJack Carlin was the leading British rider in fifth place on 9.247sec, with Hamish Turnbull seventh on 9.346sec.\n\nJohn Westerby writes: Hello from day three in the velodrome, where it’s sweltering once again. Temperatures have been around 30 degrees, which ensures two things: one, that the IOC’s official drinking water supplier will sell truckloads of bottles; two, that the times on the track will be quick.\n\nWe saw world records broken by the British women and the Dutch men in winning team sprint golds, while the Aussie men set a new landmark for the team pursuit yesterday, with the final against Team GB to come today.\n\nThis afternoon, Emma Finucane returns to the track for the first time since winning gold in the team sprint, the first of a possible hat-trick of golds for the 21-year-old from Carmarthen. She’s riding in the first round of the keirin, a chaotic sprint race in which anything can happen, but Finucane will hope to have the speed to stay out of trouble.\n\n● Read in full: Emma Finucane: Cycling dream began on military base with a £1 membership\n\nOne of the Olympic’s most unusual sports is done for the day and that is the sport climbing. To be precise, the women’s speed climbing. You know the sport; where athletes rag it up to the top of a wall as if gravity just plain forgot about them. Freaky Spider-Man kind of viewing.The gold medal has gone to Poland’s Aleksandra Miroslaw.\n\nThe women will be back tomorrow as they have a go at the boulder and lead event, which is what the men took on earlier today, with GB’s Toby Roberts and Hamish McArthur both advancing into the final. On Thursday, the men get their shot at the speed climbing.\n\n● Read more: Sport climbing to breaking: the 5 unusual Olympic sports at Paris 2024\n\nRick Broadbent writes: Ben Pattison applies the afterburners to torch down the home straight to win his 800m heat in 1min 45.56secs. The bronze medallist from the World Championship has a finish that could lift him into medal contention again here. That time is faster than Algeria’s Djamel Sedjati, widely-tipped to take the gold, but it is going to get much faster from here.\n\nPattison is a resilient figure who needed heart surgery when he was 18 after being diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a congenital heart defect that can occasionally cause cardiac arrest. His heart rate would sometimes top 240 beats per minute.\n\nHe looked comfortable today and makes it through along with Elliot Giles, a late stand-in for the injured Jake Wightman, and Max Burgin, who had to work hard for his place but is the fastest of the Brits to get through in 1min 45.36secs.\n\nRick Broadbent writes: It all works out in the end for George Mills who is advanced to the 5,000m final after the chaos of the heats. Two other fallers, Mike Foppen and Thierry Ndikumwenayo, also get through. Mills needs to learn from this though. It was a terribly slow race and he found himself in a boxed-in position. He looked to go for a gap that was not there, but gets to learn the lesson and try again.\n\nJames Gheerbrant writes: That was a fantastic effort by Britain’s Toby Roberts in the lead semi-final of the combined climbing. He gets as close to the top of the wall as we’ve seen anyone get, bar Spain’s defending champion Alberto Gines López – and his superior score from the bouldering semi-final means that, with one climber left to go, Roberts is currently the top qualifier for the final!\n\nJapan’s Sorato Anraku reaches almost exactly the same point on the wall as Toby Roberts, and by virtue of his higher score in the bouldering, he becomes the top qualifier. Roberts qualifies in second place though, and will clearly have strong claims on a medal in Friday’s combined final. And there’s even better news for Great Britain: Hamish McArthur has snuck into the final too in the eight and final qualifying spot!\n\nRick Broadbent writes: Chaos in the 5,000m as George Mills goes tumbling and takes three others with him. He gets up, jogs to the finish line and makes a beeline for France’s Hugo Hay. Mills, son of former England footballer Danny, clearly thinks he was pushed. There is a fair bit of pushing and shoving after the line too. There is a chance Mills gets reinstated but he had got himself in a terrible position in a congested 21-man field. Hay gives his verdict: “They pushed me in fact. I didn’t feel anything. The Englishman came up to me and was very angry. Everybody was pushing each other and I didn’t think that I put my shoulder into him.”\n\nThere is more drama in the second heat as a cameraman casually walked across the track in front of the entire field. Jakob Ingebrigtsen is far from happy about that. After the disappointment of finishing fourth in the 1,500m last night, he calms down enough to win the heat.\n\nMills told the BBC: “The French lad took me down.” When asked what he had said to him at the end of the race, he said: “I’m probably not allowed to say [on TV].” Mills said he expected British officials to lodge a complaint.\n\nJames Gheerbrant writes: Sky Brown stands on the lip of the skate bowl in the Place de la Concorde. It has been a long, hot slog of a day, at the end of a long, hard Olympic cycle, one in which she has been pushed and pulled in many different directions. The effort to qualify in surfing as well as skateboarding, which took her to Brazil and Puerto Rico. The tug-of-war between her schoolwork and the demands of media and sponsors. The painful strapping of her dislocated shoulder, redone by a Team GB physio in the hours between the heats and the final.\n\nBut now, in this moment of stillness before her third run of the Olympic final, it’s just her, her board, and a precipice that somehow feels like the safest, most comforting place in the world. Everything else melts away. She drops her board and steps on to it in one smooth movement, and for 45 seconds, she just flows.\n\nAn hour later, she is beaming, holding the second Olympic bronze medal of her young career, with her other arm around the Japanese skater, Cocona Hiraki, who snatched the silver away from her with the final run of the competition. But that’s the thing about women’s skateboarding at the Olympics: it makes all the old tropes of sport as a zero-sum game — medals snatched, hopes dashed, rivals crushed — feel utterly obsolete.\n\n● Read more: Sky Brown defies pain of heavy fall to claim second skateboard bronze\n\nJames Gheerbrant writes: The lead semi-final of the combined climbing event is an extraordinary spectacle: today, it’s the men’s turn, and they have to try to get as high as possible up a wall which looks absolutely impossible, with a savage overhang. You get points for how high you climb, which are added to your bouldering score. A decent effort on the lead wall from Britain’s Hamish McArthur puts him third for now, but he’ll likely a few places as we see some of the better lead climbers.\n\nRick Broadbent writes: The split times from last night’s epic 1,500m final make for interesting reading. At 1,000m Jakob Ingebrigtsen had upped the pace to 13.9 seconds for each 100m and was a second ahead of Cole Hocker. From that point Hocker was faster over every 100m split and made up 1.6 seconds on the Norwegian. From 600m to 1,000m Josh Kerr and Hocker ran almost identical splits, but on the last lap Kerr lost 0.6 seconds to Hocker. A tighter line would have helped bridge that so Ingebrigtsen literally got in the way. Yared Nuguse in third also ran the last 200m in the same time as Hocker. They both covered the final 100m in a staggering 13 seconds. What a race.\n\nElgan Alderman writes: The women’s competition is under way at Le Golf National. Britain’s Charley Hull, unable to smoke on this course, is among the early starters and began with a double-bogey six. An American world No1 took gold for the men and Nelly Korda will look to emulate Scottie Scheffler. The defending champion is low on form: her phenomenal run of six victories in seven tournaments turned into three successive missed cuts, before she finished tied 26th at the Amundi Evian Championship last month. Korda is in the trio that played away before 9am UK time, and she too went over par at the opener. Team GB’s other representative, Georgia Hall, is among the later starters at 11.17am UK time, alongside Ireland’s Leona Maguire. As well as Korda, there are two more 2024 major champions – Amy Yang and Yuka Saso – in the field.\n\nTom Kershaw writes: Imane Khelif continued to defy the storm of gender scrutiny surrounding her participation at the Olympics with a resounding victory over Thailand’s Janjaem Suwannapheng to advance to the final of the women’s under-66kg division.\n\nKhelif swept all five judges’ scorecards and forced the referee to intervene and deliver a standing count in the final round in front of a raucous crowd on Court Philippe-Chatrier at Roland Garros, where dozens of Algerian flags were visible in the stands, and the 25-year-old’s victory was announced to a deafening cheer.\n\nKhelif celebrated with a defiant, emotionally charged dance in the centre of the ring and will now face China’s Yang Liu, the second seed, in the gold-medal bout on Friday night, as the controversy that has dominated this Games continues to become further inflamed. Khelif refused to entertain the furore again here, simply saying that she wanted to make the Arab world proud.\n\n● Read more: ‘I don’t care what anybody says’ – defiant Imane Khelif one win from gold\n\nRick Broadbent writes: Gabby Thomas works nights in a ­volunteer health clinic in Texas, but she can do good on the track too as she showed by becoming the 200m ­Olympic champion.\n\nThe 27-year-old Harvard neurobiology graduate is a mix of grace and power, and the fourth-fastest woman over this distance in history. With Jamaica’s Shericka Jackson missing, she took full advantage and clocked 21.83 seconds to take a clear victory from Julien Alfred, St Lucia’s 100m champion, with the USA’s Brittany Brown taking bronze.\n\nDina Asher-Smith was in the mix and was 0.02sec away from becoming the first British woman to make the 200m podium since Dorothy Hyman in 1960. Nevertheless, she will be frustrated that she has gone faster than her time of 22.22 this summer.\n\n● Read more: Dina Asher-Smith misses bronze by 0.02sec as Gabby Thomas wins 200m title\n\nJohn Westerby writes: Second place in an Olympic final is a little more palatable when you have been beaten by an unquestionably great opponent. The Great Britain men’s team sprint trio of Ed Lowe, Hamish Turnbull and Jack Carlin were unable to emulate their female counterparts, who had won gold in this event the night before, but Team GB have made their customary strong start in the velodrome with a gold and silver in the first two events, with plenty of power to add in the coming days.\n\nThe vast swathes of orange among the crowd in the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines velodrome, though, spoke of a near certainty among Netherlands supporters that, barring unexpected mishaps, a second consecutive Olympic gold in this event would be heading their way. Roy van den Berg, Harrie Lavreysen and Jeffrey Hoogland had set a world record in the semi-final earlier in the evening and that landmark appeared a mere warm-up as they surged around the velodrome three times in only 40.949 seconds.\n\nBy the end of the first lap, Van den Berg had opened up a gap of 0.223 on Lowe and Lavreysen extended the advantage to 0.673 against Turnbull on the second leg before Hoogland held off Carlin’s charge on the third circuit.\n\n● Read more: Jason Kenny’s prodigies beaten by ‘Dutch team in league of their own’\n\nRick Broadbent writes: For Jakob Ingebrigtsen, a child prodigy turned withering provocateur, this was the most humbling yet. The sour grapes of old had fermented into an intoxicating rivalry after Josh Kerr beat him at last year’s World Championships. And he was beaten again on Tuesday night. For the third time in a row by the Scot in shades, but also by two Americans. A look of near-contempt at life spread across his face at the end.\n\nCole Hocker was the plot twist as he broke the Olympic 1,500m record. Maybe Kerr thought he was there after he had overhauled Ingebrigtsen, who had run the right race by going off at a blistering pace and hoping he could shake off the rest. Kerr clung to his coat-tails. And then found himself in Hocker’s contrails. What a mesmerising, unpredictable, jaw-dropping thriller.\n\nIn truth, the rivalry with Kerr has been reductive for Ingebrigtsen. It has been great for the sport and the media, but you feel the Norwegian was done as soon as Kerr went past him. That was all that mattered and it had grown into something more important than a medal. He had said he could beat Kerr blindfolded. Ultimately, the obsession about one man left a blind spot. Sad for the searchers of soundbites, but he should start focusing on himself.\n\n● Read more: Jakob Ingebrigtsen was humbled, but he’ll be back – he’s no fraud\n\nMatt Lawton writes: Jakob Ingebrigtsen may have once suggested he could beat his rivals ­blindfolded but, even with his eyes wide open here at the Stade de France, he would not have seen this coming.\n\nJosh Kerr was the man he had identified as the big threat to his hopes of defending his Olympic title, and the bitter adversary he has engaged in a year-long verbal joust.\n\nIt had started when Kerr out-kicked him to World Championship gold in Budapest last summer and it was still going on when the two of them emerged for this mesmerising 1,500m final. While Kerr entered the arena with a confident swagger and a signal to the crowd that a “vicious battle” was about to commence, Ingebrigtsen simply held up a single finger — No 1.\n\nSuch was their focus on each other, however, as they fought, shoulder to shoulder, along the closing straight, they overlooked the very real threat posed by Cole Hocker. Sensing Kerr starting to come past him, the Norwegian Ingebrigtsen moved wide, and in doing so opened the door to a fast- finishing 23-year-old US champion suddenly presented with the inside track to the line."
