Bosch`s business area `water heating systems` meets the press; International im globalen Wettbewerb. Bosch Geschaeftsbereich Thermotechnik stellt sich der Fachpresse vor\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAnon.\n\n1996-08-01\n\nThe business area `water heating systems` has developed into an internationally operating enterprise of the Bosch group. Its factories are distributed over seven countries: Junkers at Wernau (Germany), Worcester at Worcester (Great Britain), Radson at Houthalen (Belgium), Vulcano at Aveiro (Portugal), e.I.m. leblanc at Drancy and Brest (France) and at Lecong (PR China).- The article reports impressions gathered at a meeting of representatives of the technical press, organized by Bosch Thermotechnik at Aveiro, Portugal. This colloquy in a European site of production enabled representatives of the press to inform themselves on the spot on the internationality of the enterprise. (orig.)

However, there appear to have a wide spread misunderstanding of its real structure and attributes. This article discuss the needs for us to understand it a little more. Also, it presents the general misconceptions about MARC, the compatibility of MARC, the structure of MARC, standardization and - data communication, and some major issues related to MARC format. In this library automation age, MARC is a key element in library services, and it deserves us to take another look.\n\nFull Scale Alternative Catalyst Testing for Bosch Reactor Optimization\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBarton, Katherine; Abney, Morgan B.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nCurrent air revitalization technology onboard the International Space Station (ISS) cannot provide complete closure of the oxygen and hydrogen loops. This makes re-supply necessary, which is possible for missions in low Earth orbit (LEO) like the ISS, but unviable for long term space missions outside LEO. In comparison, Bosch technology reduces carbon dioxide with hydrogen, traditionally over a steel wool catalyst, to create water and solid carbon. The Bosch product water can then be fed to the oxygen generation assembly to produce oxygen for crew members and hydrogen necessary to reduce more carbon dioxide. Bosch technology can achieve complete oxygen loop closure, but has many undesirable factors that result in a high energy, mass, and volume system. Finding a different catalyst with an equal reaction rate at lower temperatures with less catalyst mass and longer lifespan would make a Bosch flight system more feasible. Developmental testing of alternative catalysts for the Bosch has been performed using the Horizontal Bosch Test Stand. Nickel foam, nickel shavings, and cobalt shavings were tested at 500 C and compared to the original catalyst, steel wool. This paper presents data and analysis on the performance of each catalyst tested at comparable temperatures and recycle flow rates.\n\nHyMARC (Sandia) Annual Report\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAllendorf, Mark D.

This unprecedented suite of capabilities, capable of probing all relevant length scales within storage materials, is already having a significant impact, as they are now being used by both Seedling projects and collaborators at other laboratories within HyMARC. We expect this impact to grow as new Seedling projects begin and through collaborations with other scientists outside HyMARC. In the coming year, Sandia efforts will focus on the highest impact problems, in coordination with the other HyMARC National Laboratory partners, to provide the foundational science necessary to accelerate the discovery of new hydrogen storage materials.\n\nImplementing a short-term loyalty program : case: Bosch Lawn & Garden and the Ventum short-term loyalty program\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nLogvinova, Veronika\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn 2015, one of the Bosch Home and Garden divisions, Bosch Lawn and Garden, has made a strategic decision to adopt a points-based short-term loyalty program called Ventum LG in the German supermarkets and petrol stations.

A primary focus was placed on alternate carbon formation reactor concepts to improve useful catalyst life for space vehicle applications, and make use of in situ catalyst resources for non-terrestrial surface missions. Current state-of-the-art oxygen recovery systems onboard the International Space Station are able to effectively recover approximately 45 percent of the oxygen consumed by humans and exhausted in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2). Excess CO2 is vented overboard and the oxygen contained in the molecules is lost. For long-duration missions beyond the reaches of Earth for resupply, it will be necessary to recover greater amounts of constituents such as oxygen that are necessary for sustaining life. Bosch technologies theoretically recover 100 percent of the oxygen from CO2, producing pure carbon as the sole waste product. Challenges with this technology revolve around the carbon product fouling catalyst materials, drastically limiting catalyst life. This project successfully demonstrated techniques to extend catalyst surface area exposure times to improve catalyst life for vehicle applications, and demonstrated the use of Martian and lunar regolith as viable catalyst Bosch Reactor Development for High Percentage Oxygen Recovery From Carbon Dioxide materials for surface missions. The Bosch process generates carbon nanotube formation within the regolith, which has been shown to improve mechanical properties of building materials. Production of bricks from post reaction regolith for building and radiation shielding applications were also explored.\n\nMARC Program Research and Development: A Progress Report\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHenriette D.

Morgan B.; Mansell, James M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nUtilizing carbon dioxide to produce water and hence oxygen is critical for sustained manned missions in space, and to support both NASA's cabin Atmosphere Revitalization System (ARS) and In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) concepts. For long term missions beyond low Earth orbit, where resupply is significantly more difficult and costly, open loop ARS, like Sabatier, consume inputs such as hydrogen. The Bosch process, on the other hand, has the potential to achieve complete loop closure and is hence a preferred choice. However, current single stage Bosch reactor designs suffer from a large recycle penalty due to slow reaction rates and the inherent limitation in approaching thermodynamic equilibrium. Developmental efforts are seeking to improve upon the efficiency (hence reducing the recycle penalty) of current single stage Bosch reactors which employ traditional steel wool catalysts. Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI), with support from NASA, has investigated the potential for utilizing catalysts supported over short-contact time Microlith substrates for the Bosch reaction to achieve faster reaction rates, higher conversions, and a reduced recycle flows. Proof-of-concept testing was accomplished for a staged Bosch process by splitting the chemistry in two separate reactors, first being the reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) and the second being the carbon formation reactor (CFR) via hydrogenation and/or Boudouard. This paper presents the results from this feasibility study at various operating conditions. Additionally, results from two 70 hour durability tests for the RWGS reactor are discussed.\n\nValidation of Bosch' Mobile Communication NetworkArchitecture with SPIN\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nRuys, T.C.; Langerak, Romanus\n\nThis paper discusses validation projects carried out for the Mobile Communication Division of Robert Bosch GmbH.

Hydrothermal treatment of grape marc could be an efficient way for producing solid fuels on-site at the wineries. In this work the effects of treatment temperature and liquid pH on grape marc char and liquid properties were determined based on laboratory experiments and the combustion characteristics of char were assessed through thermogravimetric analysis and fuel ash classification. The results showed that hydrothermal treatment increased the energy and carbon contents and decreased the ash content of grape marc. The effect of liquid pH was statistically significant (p < 0.05) only for the determined carbon yield of liquid samples. The energy yield from grape marc was maximized at lower treatment temperatures, which also decreased the content of less thermally stable compounds in the attained char. Higher treatment temperatures decreased grape marc solid, carbon and energy yields and led to an increase in thermally labile compounds compared to lower temperatures likely due to the condensation of liquid compounds or volatiles trapped in the pores of char particles. The alkali metal contents of char ash were reduced coupled with an increase in respective phosphorus. Overall the results support the use of hydrothermally treated grape marc in solid fuel applications, if elevated levels of ash phosphorus can be tolerated.\n\nMy week: Marc Armour.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2017-03-11\n\nMarc Armour, is a fourth-year vet student at the Royal Veterinary College.

K.\n\n2014-04-01\n\nThe Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis has been suggested to be the most important invention of the 20th century, and called the âBellwether reaction in heterogeneous catalysisâ. We examine the catalyst requirements for a new low-pressure, low-temperature synthesis process. We show that the absence of such a process for conventional transition metal catalysts can be understood as a consequence of a scaling relation between the activation energy for N2 dissociation and N adsorption energy found at the surface of these materials. A better catalyst cannot obey this scaling relation. We define the ideal scaling relation characterizing the most active catalyst possible, and show that it is theoretically possible to have a low pressure, low-temperature Haber-Bosch process. The challenge is to find new classes of catalyst materials with properties approaching the ideal, and we discuss the possibility that transition metal compounds have such properties.\n\nLaser with Bosch: a flexible tool in serial production of an automotive supplier\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRapp, Juergen\n\n2003-03-01\n\nLaser technology in Bosch-production has an already over twenty-five year old tradition and with the advancement of laser beam sources and process engineering always new ranges of application have been found. The advantages of the laser as a tool for material processing lie in the fact that it fulfills the Bosch-specific requirements regarding the product spectrum (small, heat sensitive construction units) and serial production strategies (line manufacturing with high numbers of pieces) by favorable process advantages, like short process times, small energy input and good automizability. The main operational areas of the laser are at present in the product ranges automotive equipment and electronics. Especially in the fuel injection technology manufacturing is hard to imagine without laser material processing. Lasers are used with Bosch in various ways for welding, marking, surface treatment, soldering and drilling. In addition trimming and scribing of semiconductor elements is applied for controllers and sensors. Laser cutting -- with the exception of precision cutting of rotational symmetric parts -- is used only in the manufacturing of prototypes because it is uneconomic in mass production compared to punching and has no technological advantages. Future main areas of development will be microjoining and -ablation, joining of plastics and surface finishing.\n\nCommissioning and first clinical application of mARC treatment\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDzierma, Yvonne; Nuesken, Frank G.; Kremp, Stephanie; Palm, Jan; Licht, Norbert P.; Ruebe, Christian\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe modulated arc (mARC) technique has recently been introduced for Siemens ARTISTE linear accelerators. We present the first experiences with the commissioning of the system and first patient treatments. Treatment planning and delivery are presented for the Prowess Panther treatment planning system or, alternatively, an in-house code. Dosimetric verification is performed both by point dose measurements and in 3D dose distribution. Depending on the target volume, one or two arcs can be used to create highly conformal plans. Dosimetric verification of the converted mARC plans with step-and-shoot plans shows deviations below 1 % in absolute point dose; in the 3D dose distribution, over 95 % of the points pass the 3D gamma criteria (3 % deviation in local dose and 3 mm distance to agreement for doses > 20 % of the maximum). Patient specific verification of the mARC dose distribution with the calculations has a similar pass rate. Treatment times range between 2 and 5 min for a single arc. To our knowledge, this is the first report of clinical application of the mARC technique. The mARC offers the possibility to save significant amounts of time, with single-arc treatments of only a few minutes achieving comparable dose distribution to IMRT plans taking up to twice as long.

In such situations the driver may be supported by controlling the longitudinal and the lateral forces on the tires. The Vehicle Dynamics Control System of Bosch (VDC) does that by controlled braking of individual wheels which makes the vehicle motion approach the nomial motion intended by the driver. It uses signals to derive the driver`s intent (steering wheel angle, brake pressure, engine torque) and signals to dervie the actual motion of the vehicle (yaw rate, lateral acceleration). The support of the driver is not limited to coasting conditions. Also during full braking (ABS), partial braking, engine drag, free rolling and acceleration (ASR) of the vehicle the system supports the driver in all safety critical situations. In this paper an overview of the VDC is given. The goal of the development of VDC, the physical background, the concept of the system, the control and the controller algorithm are described. The benefit of VDC is demonstrated by an experimental test. (orig.)

The marc extract of red grape cultivars reveals plant defence inducer properties. Treatment with grape marc extract efficiently induced hypersensitive reaction-like lesions with cell death evidenced by Evans Blue staining of tobacco leaves. Examination of the infiltration zone and the surrounding areas under UV light revealed the accumulation of autofluorescent compounds. Both leaf infiltration and a foliar spray of the red grape extract on tobacco leaves induced defence gene expression. The PR1 and PR2 target genes were upregulated locally and systemically in tobacco plants following grape marc extract treatment. The grape extract elicited an array of plant defence responses making this natural compound a potential phytosanitary product with a challenging issue and a rather attractive option for sustainable agriculture and environmentally friendly practices.\n\nA novel implementation of mARC treatment for non-dedicated planning systems using converted IMRT plans\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDzierma, Yvonne; Nuesken, Frank; Licht, Norbert; Ruebe, Christian\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe modulated arc (mARC) technique has recently been introduced by Siemens as an analogue to VMAT treatment. However, up to now only one certified treatment planning system supports mARC planning. We therefore present a conversion algorithm capable of converting IMRT plans created by any treatment planning system into mARC plans, with the hope of expanding the availability of mARC to a larger range of clinical users and researchers. As additional advantages, our implementation offers improved functionality for planning hybrid arcs and provides an equivalent step-and-shoot plan for each mARC plan, which can be used as a back-up concept in institutions where only one linac is equipped with mARC. We present a feasibility study to outline a practical implementation of mARC plan conversion using Philips Pinnacle and Prowess Panther. We present examples for three different kinds of prostate and head-and-neck plans, for 6 MV and flattening-filter-free (FFF) 7 MV photon energies, which are dosimetrically verified. It is generally more difficult to create good quality IMRT plans in Pinnacle using a large number of beams and few segments. We present different ways of optimization as examples. By careful choosing the beam and segment arrangement and inversion objectives, we achieve plan qualities similar to our usual IMRT plans. The conversion of the plans to mARC format yields functional plans, which can be irradiated without incidences. Absolute dosimetric verification of both the step-and-shoot and mARC plans by point dose measurements showed deviations below 5% local dose, mARC plans deviated from step-and-shoot plans by no more than 1%. The agreement between GafChromic film measurements of planar dose before and after mARC conversion is excellent. The comparison of the 3D dose distribution measured by PTW Octavius 729 2D-Array with the step-and-shoot plans and with the TPS is well above the pass criteria of 90% of the points falling within 5% local dose and 3 mm distance\n\nLIBER MARC Harmonization Task Force - Format activities in European countries\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRenate GÃ¶mpel\n\n2004-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The LIBER MARC Harmonization Task Force has its origins in an initiative of the past President of LIBER, Professor Elmar Mittler from the GÃ¶ttingen State and University Library. Professor Mittler asked Dr Elisabeth Niggemann from Die Deutsche Bibliothek to take part in the meeting of the MARC Harmonization Coordinating Committee in Ottawa in May 2001. Following that meeting the LIBER MARC Harmonization Task Force was founded at the LIBER Annual Conference in July 2001 in London. The LIBER MARC Harmonization Task Force held its first meeting on 14 January 2002 at Die Deutsche Bibliothek Frankfurt am Main, with the aim of gaining an overview of format activities in Europe. The group's aim was to concentrate on European developments and to build up stronger cooperation in the library world in order to strengthen Europe's international influence. The LIBER MARC Harmonization Task Force held a second meeting at the IFLA 2002 Conference in Glasgow and discussed the first draft of its report and recommendations to LIBER. After final discussion within the group, this report has been further revised and was submitted to LIBER. The aim of the report is to give an overview of format activities in European countries and to make recommendations to LIBER regarding the use and development of data formats in Europe. The annex includes reports on migration activities from different countries.

E.; Majewski, S. R.; Plez, B.; Schiavon, R.; Shetrone, M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe present a new grid of model photospheres for the SDSS-III/APOGEE survey of stellar populations of the Galaxy, calculated using the ATLAS9 and MARCS codes. New opacity distribution functions were generated to calculate ATLAS9 model photospheres. MARCS models were calculated based on opacity sampling techniques. The metallicity ([M/H]) spans from â5 to 1.5 for ATLAS and â2.5 to 0.5 for MARCS models. There are three main differences with respect to previous ATLAS9 model grids: a new corrected H 2 O line list, a wide range of carbon ([C/M]) and Î± element [Î±/M] variations, and solar reference abundances from Asplund et al. The added range of varying carbon and Î±-element abundances also extends the previously calculated MARCS model grids. Altogether, 1980 chemical compositions were used for the ATLAS9 grid and 175 for the MARCS grid. Over 808,000 ATLAS9 models were computed spanning temperatures from 3500 K to 30,000 K and log g from 0 to 5, where larger temperatures only have high gravities. The MARCS models span from 3500 K to 5500 K, and log g from 0 to 5.

Roy; Chaffee, Alan L.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPressurized thermal decomposition of two marine algae, Pinus radiata chip residue and grape marc using high temperature, high pressure reactions has been studied. The yields and composition of the products obtained from liquefactions under CO of a mixture of biomass and H 2 O (with or without catalyst) were compared with products from liquefaction of dry biomass under N 2 , at different temperatures, gas pressures and for CO runs, water to biomass ratios. Thermochemical reactions of algae produced significantly higher dichloromethane solubles and generally higher product yields to oil and asphaltene than Pinus radiata and grape marc under the reaction conditions used. Furthermore, the biofuels derived from algae contained significant concentrations of aliphatic hydrocarbons as opposed to those from radiata pine and grape marc which were richer in aromatic compounds. The possibility of air transport fuel production from algae thus appears to have considerable advantages over that from radiata pine and grape marc. - Highlights: â¢ Liquefaction of algae gave more oil than that of Pinus radiata and grape marc. â¢ Reactions under CO/H 2 O produced higher yields of oil than N 2 . â¢ Water to biomass ratio had little effect on the yields. â¢ Bio-oil from algae contained substantial amounts of aliphatic hydrocarbons. â¢ Pinus radiata oil was low in N but high in O\n\nMicro-scale energy valorization of grape marcs in winery production plants\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nFabbri, Andrea; Bonifazi, Giuseppe; Serranti, Silvia, E-mail: silvia.serranti@uniroma1.it\n\n2015-02-15\n\nHighlights: â¢ BioMethane Potential of grape marcs was investigated. â¢ Grape marcs were characterized to realize a micro-scale energy recovery. â¢ Comparative BMP batch-tests utilizing lab-scale reactors were performed. â¢ Biogas valorization by grape marcs anaerobic digestion at small scale is evaluated. - Abstract: The BiochemicalMethanePotential (BMP) of winery organic waste, with reference to two Italian red and white grapes (i.e. Nero Buono and Greco) by-products was investigated.

Owing to the increase in Australian wine production for home and export, and the decrease in Spirits consumption, marc could be in surfeit- Marc seeds for example, still contain oil and tannins which are useful products. So the titular study by EPR was undertaken. Grapeseeds of various varieties were collected on the vine, and from marc after fermentation. The meal remaining from marc seeds after oil extraction was also collected, and climate was taken into account. From this very limited trial, there appears to be no obvious effect of climate on phenolic content. In most cases, the phenolic content of grapeseeds post-winemaking is lower than that pre-winemaking, consistent with the winemaking process significantly affecting phenolic content. For grapeseed meal, in most cases the phenolic content is lower than that of the seeds used to produce the meal. This 'negative' effect of the oil extraction process is consistent with our previously unpublished work (commercial - in - confidence), but is not necessarily economically significant\n\nFilamentous fungi isolated from grape marc as antagonists of Botrytis cinerea\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJoviÄiÄ-PetroviÄ Jelena P.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In this paper we report on the isolation and identification of three filamentous fungi from grape marc, and antifungal effect of their cell-free culture filtrates on the growth of Botrytis cinerea, causal agent of gray mold. Grape marc is a waste material that has been used as soil amendment in sustainable agriculture. Isolates originating from grape marc were identified on the basis of morphological features and internal transcribed spacer rDNA or Î²-tubulin gene sequencing. The presence of three different species, Penicillium paneum, Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus fumigatus has been detected expressing different effect on the growth of B. cinerea. The effect of crude culture filtrates of selected fungi on B. cinerea growth was tested. Heat sensitivity of the established inhibition effect was examined by autoclaving the crude culture filtrate prior to testing. Additional aim was to determine whether antifungal effect was influenced by previous exposure to B. cinerea in dual liquid cultures. Crude culture filtrate of A. fumigatus K16/2 showed the lowest suppression of B. cinerea growth. A maximal percentage inhibition achieved within the study was 38.2%, 39.8% and 23.8 for crude filtrates of P. paneum K7/1, P. chrysogenum K11/1 and A. fumigatus K16/2, respectively. Presence of B. cinerea in dual liquid culture induced significant increase in antifungal capacity of the culture filtrates in comparison to pure culture filtrates of the chosen isolates. The antifungal activity of all of the isolatesâ culture filtrates retained after heat treatment suggesting the presence of some thermostable antifungal metabolites. The results indicate the complexity and specificity of the interaction between filamentous fungi and B. cinerea. Grape marc is a good source for isolation od B. cinerea fungal antagonists and their antifungal metabolites. Specificity of fungal-fungal interactions suggests that further research on the antagonistic mechanisms and\n\nHybrid concepts of the co-operation GETRAG-BOSCH and their realisation in a demonstrator car; Hybridkonzepte der Kooperation GETRAG-BOSCH am Beispiel eines Demonstratorfahrzeugs\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBlankenbach, Bernd; Blessing, Uli Christian [GETRAG KG, Untergruppenbach (Germany); Imaseki, Takashi; Richter, Boyke [Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart (Germany)\n\n2009-07-01\n\nAt present, the partners of hybrid co-operation Getrag KG (Untergruppenbach, Federal Republic of Germany) and Robert Bosch GmbH (Stuttgart, Federal Republic of Germany) develop a hybrid demonstrator vehicle.

White grape marc samples from Malvazija istarska, Chardonnay and Muscat Blanc were obtained as by-products in standard white wine production, while red grape marc samples from Teran and Cabernet Sauvignon were obtained after standard red wine production procedures. Marc from red grape variety MuÅ¡kat ruÅ¾a poreÄki was obtained during the production of rosÃ© wines. All fermented marc samples were distilled using a traditional copper alembic. The obtained distillates were subjected to GC/MS and GC/FID analyses. Malvazija istarska distillates exhibited exceptionally high methanol content. Distillates from white grape varieties were found to be characterized by higher C6 alcohol and 1-propanol concentrations, while red grape distillates contained higher amounts of the majority of alcohols, acids, and esters. In MuÅ¡kat ruÅ¾a distillates intermediate concentrations of many important aroma compounds were found. It was concluded that differences in the production technology parameters, depending on the variety, resulted in differences in secondary aroma profiles, most evident between distillates from white and red varieties. These findings were confirmed applying stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA, which resulted in 100 % correct classification of distillates according to the variety and corresponding production technology.\n\nDREM: Infinite etch selectivity and optimized scallop size distribution with conventional photoresists in an adapted multiplexed Bosch DRIE process\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nChang, Bingdong; Leussink, Pele; Jensen, Flemming\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe quest to sculpture materials as small and deep as possible is an ongoing topic in micro- and nanofabrication.

In passato, il tentativo di spiegare il comportamento morale a partire dalla teoria dellâevoluzione Ã¨ stato intrapreso dal padre fondatore dellâevoluzionismo Charles Darwin, successivamente da T.H. Huxley e da H. Spencer e infine dal sociobiologo E. Wilson a metÃ degli anni â70 del Novecento. Oggi questa impresa Ã¨ stata ereditata dallo psicologo evoluzionista Marc Hauser, le cui indagini prendono avvio da unâanalogia tra facoltÃ morale e facoltÃ linguistica. Questa analogia gli consente di affermare che la pluralitÃ di codici morali adottati dagli uomini nelle differenti culture dipende da un numero limitato di principi morali, nello stesso modo in cui la varietÃ di lingue con cui gli uomini si esprimono, dipende da un numero limitato di principi linguistici universali. Dunque, sembrerebbe che lâevoluzione biologica abbia plasmato dei principi morali universali e uniformi che si presentano costanti in tutti gli uomini a prescindere dalla loro appartenenza culturale. Come vadano intesi i principi morali universali e quale rapporto intercorre tra di essi e i vari codici morali sarÃ lâargomento di questo saggio, il quale tenterÃ di analizzare la proposta di Marc Hauser allâinterno della cornice dei rapporti tra etica ed evoluzionismo.\n\nCharacterization and differentiation of monovarietal grape marc distillates on the basis of varietal aroma compound composition.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLukiÄ, Igor; MiliceviÄ, Borislav; BanoviÄ, Mara; Tomas, SreÄko; Radeka, Sanja; PersuriÄ, Dordano\n\n2010-06-23\n\nTo investigate the varietal aroma compound composition of monovarietal grape marc distillates made from six different varieties (Vitis vinifera L.) in the region of Istria (Croatia), 30 samples were subjected to GC/MS and GC/FID analysis. A total of 73 compounds were identified: 45 monoterpenes, 20 sesquiterpenes, 3 diterpenes, and 5 C(13)-norisoprenoids. The largest number and the highest concentration of monoterpenes were found in Muscat Blanc, followed by Rose Muscat of Porec (Muskat ruza porecki) distillates, which were both characterized as highly aromatic. Lower, but still significant monoterpenol content was determined in distillates made from Istrian Malvasia (Malvazija istarska) grape marc. Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Teran distillates exhibited poorer monoterpene profiles, while Teran distillates contained elevated sesquiterpene concentrations. It was concluded that investigated monovarietal grape marc distillates significantly differ in varietal aroma compound composition. Stepwise linear discriminant analysis provided efficient discrimination models, and extracted various monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and C(13)-norisoprenoids as important differentiators of distillates according to varietal origin.\n\nMineke Bosch, Ulrike Krampl, Hanna Hacker (Hg.: Spektakel.

Major volatile compounds which present risk to human health (such as methanol, furfural, and acetaldehyde and ethyl alcohol content were compared to European Union Regulation and other values found in previous studies. Â The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety of grape marc spirits considering their content in major volatile compounds by comparison with the requirements of European Union Regulation. We investigated the ethyl alcohol content by electronic densimetry and 10 major volatile compounds (acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, methanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, amyl active alcohol and furfural by Gas Chromatography coupled with Flame Ionization Detector. We used reference chemicals to identify these compounds and 3-pentanol as internal standard to quantify the volatiles. Results were compared with the requirements of European Union Regulation. All major volatile compounds registered values in accordance to EU Regulation and the grape pomace spirits samples do not present any kind of risk for consumption.\n\nIs Marc-Antoine Jullien De Paris the \"Father\" of Comparative Education?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEpstein, Erwin H.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nMore than any other historical figure, Marc-Antoine Jullien of Paris has been considered the \"Father\" of Comparative Education, and his \"Esquisse d'un ouvrage sur l'Ã©ducation compare\", appearing in 1816-17, has been viewed as that field's originating source.

Two examples of SRC are the Spatial Numerical Association of Response Codes (SNARC) and the Markedness Association of Response Codes (MARC) effects. According to the polarity correspondence principle, these two SRC effects occur because of a match between the most salient dimensions of stimulus and response. Specifically, the SNARC effect would be caused by a match between right-sided responses and large numbers, while a match between right-sided responses and even numbers would give rise to the MARC effect. The aim of the present study was to test the validity of the polarity correspondence principle in explaining these two SRC effects. To this end, we applied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over left and right posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which is thought to be the neural basis of salience processing, during a parity judgement task. Results showed that cathodal tDCS over the PPC significantly reduced the MARC effect but did not affect the SNARC effect, suggesting a dissociation between the two effects. That is, the MARC would rely on a salience processing mechanism, whereas the SNARC would not. Despite this interpretation is in need of further experimental confirmations (i.e., testing different tasks or using different tDCS montages), our results suggest that the polarity correspondence principle can be a plausible explanation only for the MARC effect but not for the SNARC effect.

In response, the Online Audiovisual Catalogers (OLAC created a task force to study the issues related to creating and using FRBR-based work-level records for moving images. This article presents one part of the task force's work: it looks at the feasibility of creating provisional FRBR work-level records for moving images by extracting data from existing manifestation-level bibliographic records. Using a sample of 941 MARC records, a subgroup of the task force conducted a pilot project to look at five characteristics of moving image works. Here they discuss their methodology; analysis; selected results for two elements, original date (year and director name; and conclude with some suggested changes to MARC coding and current cataloging policy.\n\nHerbal distillates: A new era of grape marc distillates with enriched antioxidant profile.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAndreou, Vasiliki; Strati, Irini F; Fotakis, Charalambos; Liouni, Maria; Zoumpoulakis, Panagiotis; Sinanoglou, Vassilia J\n\n2018-07-01\n\nGrape marc distillates are traditional alcoholic beverages, produced mostly in the Mediterranean countries. The present study proposes the enrichment of a Greek traditional grape marc distillate (tsikoudia) with selected herbs to enhance its natural antioxidants and functional properties. Total phenolic content, the antiradical and antioxidant activities, as well as the phenolic and sugar profiles using NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy were evaluated. The enrichment of distillates with Syzygium aromaticum L., Jasminum officinale L. and Eucalyptus globulus Labill. exhibited the highest total phenolic content as well as the highest antioxidant and antiradical activities, whereas the lowest values were observed with Hippophae rhamnoides L. and Lycium Barbarum Mill. The implementation of NMR and FT-IR spectroscopies attested to the presence of phenolic compounds and of specific carbohydrates in herbal distillates, postulating their migration from selected herbal species to tsikoudia and probably contributing to their organoleptic characteristics. The target of this approach leads to new added-value distillates with enhanced characteristics. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The coefficients of the series so obtained satisfy linked first order differential equations, and on eliminating terms associated with odd parity harmonics a second order system results which can be solved by established finite difference or finite element techniques. This report describes modifications incorporated in MARC/PN to allow for anisotropic scattering, and the modelling of irregular exterior boundaries in the finite element option. The latter development leads to substantial reductions in problem size, particularly for three dimensions. Also, links to an interactive graphics mesh generator (SUPERTAB) have been added. The final section of the report contains results from problems showing the effects of anisotropic scatter and the ability of the code to model irregular geometries.

Therefore, there were cultivated two strains of Lactobacillus sp. on five different growth medium. The protein biosynthesis and evolution of lactic fermentation were monitored by determining the optical density (OD of the culture at a wavelength Î» = 600 nm and by counting the colony forming units (CFU by serial dilutions and seeding on plates and by determination of lactic acid obtained. The results showed that the fermentation medium represented by diffusion solution of the marc, enriched with peptone is economically profitable compared to other culture media containing peptone, yeast extract, glucose, minerals, amino acids and vitamins presented in the literature.\n\nProperties of slate mining wastes incubated with grape marc compost under laboratory conditions.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nParadelo, Remigio; Moldes, Ana BelÃ©n; Barral, MarÃ­a Teresa\n\n2009-02-01\n\nThe effect of the addition of spent grape marc compost (GMC) and vermicompost (GMV) as amendments to slate mining wastes was evaluated in a laboratory incubation experiment. Mixtures of slate processing fines (SPF), with three doses of each amendment (4%, 8% and 16% compost, dry weight), plus a control were incubated at 25 degrees C in the laboratory for 90 days. The changes in the chemical and biological properties of the mixtures (pH, total C, total N, inorganic N, available nutrients, microbial biomass carbon and dehydrogenase activity) were investigated during the incubation period, and once it was finished, the phytotoxicity of the mixtures was determined by the germination of Lolium multiflorum Lam. seeds. The addition of the amendments significantly increased the nutrient concentrations of the SPF and enhanced biological activity by increasing microbial biomass and enzymatic activity. Results improved with higher doses; within the composts, GMV showed a better performance than GMC. These results prove the suitability of grape marc-derived amendments for the biochemical amelioration of mining wastes, and highlight the benefits of organic amendment in restoration projects.\n\nGlycoprotein 5 of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus strain SD16 inhibits viral replication and causes G2/M cell cycle arrest, but does not induce cellular apoptosis in Marc-145 cells\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMu, Yang; Li, Liangliang; Zhang, Beibei; Huang, Baicheng; Gao, Jiming\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCell apoptosis is common after infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). PRRSV GP5 has been reported to induce cell apoptosis. To further understand the role of GP5 in PRRSV induced cell apoptosis, we established Marc-145 cell lines stably expressing full-length GP5, GP5 Î84-96 (aa 84-96 deletion), and GP5 Î97-119 (aa 97-119 deletion). Cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell apoptosis and virus replication in these cell lines were evaluated. Neither truncated nor full-length GP5 induced cell apoptosis in Marc-145 cells. However, GP5 Î97-119 , but not full-length or GP5 Î84-96 , induced a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase resulting in a reduction in the growth of Marc-145 cells. Additionally, GP5 Î84-96 inhibited the replication of PRRSV in Marc-145 cells through induction of IFN-Î². These findings suggest that PRRSV GP5 is not responsible for inducing cell apoptosis in Marc-145 cells under these experimental conditions; however it has other important roles in virus/host cell biology. - Highlights: â¢ Marc-145 cell lines stable expression PRRSV GP5 or truncated GP5 were constructed. â¢ GP5 Î97-119 expression in Marc-145 cell induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. â¢ Expression of GP5 and truncated GP5 could not induce Marc-145 cells apoptosis. â¢ PRRSV replication in Marc-145-GP5 Î84-96 was significantly inhibited\n\nMees, kes nÃ¤inud kÃµige rohkem moodsaid aedu / Marc Treib ; interv.

Treatment time and dosimetric linearity\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDzierma, Yvonne; Nuesken, Frank; Licht, Norbert; Ruebe, Christian [Universitaetsklinikum des Saarlandes, Homburg/Saar (Germany). Klinik fuer Strahlentherapie und Radioonkologie\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe mARC technique is a hybrid rotational IMRT modality operating in ''burst mode''. While it is generally assumed that it will be slower than VMAT, the real limits of operation have not been defined so far. We here present the first systematic study of the technical limits on mARC treatment. The following scenarios are considered: 18, 30, 36 or 45 arclets per rotation (spacing between 20 and 8 ), flat and flattening-filter-free (FFF) energy, arclet width 4 or 2 , from 1 MU/arclet to 1000 MU/plan. All scenarios are irradiated, treatment times are measured and treatment parameters reported. Dose linearity was assessed by point dose measurements of the 18 arclet plans with 1-30 MU per arclet. Minimum treatment times (no MLC movement, few MUs) depend strongly on the number of arclets per rotation (1 minute for 18 arclets to 1:50 min for 45 arclets), and rise linearly with MU/arclets after a given cut-off value depending on scenario, arclet width and available maximum dose rate. MLC movement adds up to 2 minutes of treatment time, but generally less (ca. 45 seconds in realistic plans). The rules by which irradiation parameters are selected by the firmware can be partly discovered. The choice of dose rate is most clearly defined. For the flat 6 MV energy, the highest available dose rate (300 MU/min) is always applied. For FFF 7 MV dose rate is reduced for arclets with few MUs, so that an arclet is irradiated in no less than 0.3 s. Only for the case of 1 MU/arclet can this constraint not be met (the technical limit on the dose rate if 500 MU/min for FFF 7 MV). In this case, dosimetric linearity is reduced. In all other instances, deviations from linearity at low MU remain below 2%. Treatment times of down to 90 seconds are technically achievable for treatment with FFF beams using up to 36 arclets per rotation (arclet spacing every 10 ) for up to 900 MU/plan, comparable to VMAT treatment times. The values provided here are meant to serve as a reference\n\nIdentification of a new cell line permissive to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection and replication which is phenotypically distinct from MARC-145 cell line\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nProvost Chantale\n\n2012-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract Background Airborne transmitted pathogens, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV, need to interact with host cells of the respiratory tract in order to be able to enter and disseminate in the host organism. Pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM and MA104 derived monkey kidney MARC-145 cells are known to be permissive to PRRSV infection and replication and are the most studied cells in the literature. More recently, new cell lines developed to study PRRSV have been genetically modified to make them permissive to the virus. The SJPL cell line origin was initially reported to be epithelial cells of the respiratory tract of swine. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine if SJPL cells could support PRRSV infection and replication in vitro. Results The SJPL cell growth was significantly slower than MARC-145 cell growth. The SJPL cells were found to express the CD151 protein but not the CD163 and neither the sialoadhesin PRRSV receptors. During the course of the present study, the SJPL cells have been reported to be of monkey origin. Nevertheless, SJPL cells were found to be permissive to PRRSV infection and replication even if the development of the cytopathic effect was delayed compared to PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells. Following PRRSV replication, the amount of infectious viral particles produced in SJPL and MARC-145 infected cells was similar. The SJPL cells allowed the replication of several PRRSV North American strains and were almost efficient as MARC-145 cells for virus isolation. Interestingly, PRRSV is 8 to 16 times more sensitive to IFNÎ± antiviral effect in SJPL cell in comparison to that in MARC-145 cells. PRRSV induced an increase in IFNÎ² mRNA and no up regulation of IFNÎ± mRNA in both infected cell types. In addition, PRRSV induced an up regulation of IFNÎ³ and TNF-Î± mRNAs only in infected MARC-145 cells. Conclusions In conclusion, the SJPL cells are permissive to PRRSV. In addition, they are\n\nOn the Science and Teaching of Emotional Intelligence: An Interview with Marc Brackett\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHeller, Rafael\n\n2017-01-01\n\nOver the past two decades, researchers have gathered a wealth of evidence showing the critical roles that emotional intelligence plays in education, work, and life.

The cost is estimated as the potential loss of goods and services due to the imposition of countermeasures, measured by a lost contribution to the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A primary aim in developing such a method is to provide the basis for clear quantitative inputs to difficult decisions in emergency planning; decisions on whether to apply countermeasures, and on the extent to which they should be applied. The method should also provide useful inputs to nuclear siting policy and to safety design assessments. While the method should aid decision-making, it does not measure all the costs; other major costs of nuclear accidents, such as the loss of nuclear plant capacity and the social disruption caused by countermeasures require separate additional assessment. The models in the MARC procedure for accident assessment are under continuing review. This memorandum records the method currently included in ECONO-MARC; additional models and improved procedures will be incorporated, as appropriate, in the future.

A qualitative comparison has been made of the features of the constituent sub-models of the two codes, and potentially the most important differences identified. The influence of these differences has been investigated quantitatively by comparison of the predictions of the two codes in a wide variety of circumstances. Both intermediate quantities and endpoints used as a measure of risk have been compared in order to separate the variables more clearly. The results indicate that, in general, the predictions of MARC and CRAC2 are in good agreement.\n\nComparison of the foodchain transport models of WASH-1400 and MARC using the accident consequence model UFOMOD\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSteinhauer, C.\n\n1985-04-01\n\nWithin the frame of the contract with the European Community 'Methods for Assessing the Radiological Impact of Accidents' (CEC-MARIA) comparative accident consequence assessments were performed with the computer code UFOMOD, replacing the currently implemented foodchain transport model of the WASH-1400 study by the dynamic transport model of the MARC methodology. The calculations were based on the release category FK2 of the German Risk Study with meteorological data representing four different regions of the Federal Republic of Germany. The study of seasonal variations was carried out with the MARC data for four representative times of deposition with an agricultural practice adopted in the UK. In this report the differences are presented which are observed in the potential doses due to ingestion, the areas affected by food-bans and the late health effects when using both models and taking the influence of seasonal effects into account.

This strategy has detected football players at medical risk during mandatory precompetition medical assessments. Additionally, FIFA has (1) sponsored internationally accepted guidelines for the interpretation of an athlete's ECG, (2) developed field-of-play-specific protocols for the recognition, response, resuscitation and removal of a football player having sudden cardiac arrest and (3) introduced and distributed the FIFA medical emergency bag which has already resulted in the successful resuscitation of a football player who had a sudden cardiac arrest on the field-of-play. Recently FIFA, in association with the Institute of Sports and Preventive Medicine in SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany, established a worldwide Sudden Death Registry with a view to documenting fatal events on the football field-of-play. These activities by F-MARC are testimony to FIFA's continued commitment to minimising sudden cardiac arrest while playing football. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Early diagnosis through effective screening programs is likely to improve vision outcomes. The ETDRS seven-standard-field 35-mm stereoscopic color retinal imaging (ETDRS of the dilated eye is elaborate and requires mydriasis, and is unsuitable for screening. We evaluated an image analysis application for the automated diagnosis of DR from non-mydriatic single-field images. Patients suffering from diabetes for at least 5 years were included if they were 18 years or older. Patients already diagnosed with DR were excluded. Physiologic mydriasis was achieved by placing the subjects in a dark room. Images were captured using a Bosch Mobile Eye Care fundus camera. The images were analyzed by the Retinal Imaging Bosch DR Algorithm for the diagnosis of DR. All subjects also subsequently underwent pharmacological mydriasis and ETDRS imaging. Non-mydriatic and mydriatic images were read by ophthalmologists. The ETDRS readings were used as the gold standard for calculating the sensitivity and specificity for the software. 564 consecutive subjects (1128 eyes were recruited from six centers in India. Each subject was evaluated at a single outpatient visit. Forty-four of 1128 images (3.9% could not be read by the algorithm, and were categorized as inconclusive. In four subjects, neither eye provided an acceptable image: these four subjects were excluded from the analysis. This left 560 subjects for analysis (1084 eyes. The algorithm correctly diagnosed 531 of 560 cases. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 91%, 97%, 94%, and 95% respectively. The Bosch DR Algorithm shows favorable sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing DR from non-mydriatic images, and can greatly simplify screening for DR. This also has major implications for telemedicine in the use of screening for retinopathy in patients with diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe Haber Bosch-harmful algal bloom (HB-HAB) link\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGlibert, Patricia M.; Maranger, Roxane; Sobota, Daniel J.; Bouwman, Lex\n\n2014-10-01\n\nLarge-scale commercialization of the Haber-Bosch (HB) process is resulting in intensification of nitrogen (N) fertilizer use worldwide. Globally N fertilizer use is far outpacing that of phosphorus (P) fertilizer. Much of the increase in N fertilizers is also now in the form of urea, a reduced form of N. Incorporation of these fertilizers into agricultural products is inefficient leading to significant environmental pollution and aquatic eutrophication. Of particular concern is the increased occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in waters receiving nutrient enriched runoff. Many phytoplankton causing HABs have physiological adaptive strategies that make them favored under conditions of elevated N : P conditions and supply of chemically reduced N (ammonium, urea). We propose that the HB-HAB link is a function of (1) the inefficiency of incorporation of N fertilizers in the food supply chain, the leakiness of the N cycle from crop to table, and the fate of lost N relative to P to the environment; and (2) adaptive physiology of many HABs to thrive in environments in which there is excess N relative to classic nutrient stoichiometric proportions and where chemically reduced forms of N dominate. The rate of HAB expansion is particularly pronounced in China where N fertilizer use has escalated very rapidly, where soil retention is declining, and where blooms have had large economic and ecological impacts. There, in addition to increased use of urea and high N : P based fertilizers overall, escalating aquaculture production adds to the availability of reduced forms of N, as does atmospheric deposition of ammonia. HABs in both freshwaters and marginal seas in China are highly related to these overall changing N loads and ratios. Without more aggressive N control the future outlook in terms of HABs is likely to include more events, more often, and they may also be more toxic.\n\nAplikace logistickÃ½ch technologiÃ­ Just-in-Time a Just-in-Sequence ve spoleÄnosti Robert Bosch spol. sÂ r.o.\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nÅ TEFKOVÃ, Iveta\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis work is mostly oriented to define theory and application of principle Just in Time ( JIT ), Just in Sequence (JIS ) and related methods in Robert Bosch Ltd.Part goals are define theoretical basis of JIT and JIS from knowledge of Czech and foreign literature and detailed analysis of particular methods.

In addition to colour indices and evaluable polyphenols, all samples were described by sensorial analysis. There were significant differences in the mean concentrations of the majority of phenolic compounds among the samples. Gallic and benzoic acids were the most abundant and samples aged in Q. robur from Galicia (NW of Spain) had the highest concentration of most of the determined phenols. Grape marc distillates aged in Q. robur obtained the highest values of all sensorial attributes, whereas samples aged in Q. petraea and Q. alba obtained similar scores. Principal component analysis accounted for 88.32% of total variance, showing a good separation of aged distillates in terms of phenolic compounds and colour characteristics, according to the species and origin of the oak wood used in the ageing process.\n\nKinetic-quantum chemical model for catalytic cycles: the Haber-Bosch process and the effect of reagent concentration.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKozuch, Sebastian; Shaik, Sason\n\n2008-07-03\n\nA combined kinetic-quantum chemical model is developed with the goal of estimating in a straightforward way the turnover frequency (TOF) of catalytic cycles, based on the state energies obtained by quantum chemical calculations. We describe how the apparent activation energy of the whole cycle, so-called energetic span (delta E), is influenced by the energy levels of two species: the TOF determining transition state (TDTS) and the TOF determining intermediate (TDI). Because these key species need not be adjoining states, we conclude that for catalysis there are no rate-determining steps, only rate determining states. In addition, we add here the influence of reactants concentrations. And, finally, the model is applied to the Haber-Bosch process of ammonia synthesis, for which we show how to calculate which catalyst will be the most effective under specific reagents conditions.\n\nThe Belgian Minister of Economy, Energy, Foreign Trade and Science Policy, Marc Verwilghen, with CERN's Director-General, Robert Aymar.\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nMichel Blanc\n\n2005-01-01\n\nMarc Verwilghen, Belgian Minister of Economy, Energy, Foreign Trade and Science Policy, came to CERN on 8 April 2005, where he visited the CMS assembly hall and underground cavern, as well as the hall where the LHC superconducting magnets are being tested.\n\nThe effect of major adverse renal cardiovascular event (MARCE) incidence, procedure volume, and unit cost on the hospital savings resulting from contrast media use in inpatient angioplasty.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKeuffel, Eric; McCullough, Peter A; Todoran, Thomas M; Brilakis, Emmanouil S; Palli, Swetha R; Ryan, Michael P; Gunnarsson, Candace\n\n2018-04-01\n\nTo determine the net economic impact of switching from low-osmolar contrast media (LOCM) to iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM; iodixanol) in patients undergoing inpatient coronary or peripheral angioplasty in the United States (US). A budget impact model (BIM) was developed from a hospital perspective. Nationally representative procedural and contrast media prevalence rates, along with MARCE (major adverse renal cardiovascular event) incidence and episode-related cost data were derived from Premier Hospital Data (October 2014 to September 2015). A previously estimated relative risk reduction in MARCE associated with IOCM usage (9.3%) was applied. The higher cost of IOCM was included when calculating the net impact estimates at the aggregate, hospital type, and per hospital levels. One-way (Â±25%) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses identified the model's most important inputs. Based on weighted analysis, 513,882âUS inpatient angioplasties and 35,610 MARCE cases were estimated annually. Switching to an \"IOCM only\" strategy from a \"LOCM only\" strategy increases contrast media cost, but prevents 2,900 MARCE events. The annual budget impact was an estimated saving of $30.71 million, aggregated across all US hospitals, $6,316 per hospital, or $60 per procedure. Net savings were maintained across all univariate sensitivity analyses. While MARCE/event-free cost differential was the most important factor driving total net savings for hospitals in the Northeast and West, procedural volume was important in the Midwest and rural locations. Switching to an \"IOCM only\" strategy from a \"LOCM only\" approach yields substantial net global savings to hospitals, both at the national level and within hospital sub-groups. Hospital administrators should maintain awareness of the factors that are likely to be more influential for their hospital and recognize that purchasing on the basis of lower contrast media cost may result in higher overall costs for patients undergoing inpatient\n\nEvolution of the stability parameters composting two-phase olive mill waste with grape marc and vine branches\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGarcia-Gallego, A.; Lopez-Pineiro, A.; Albarran, A.; Rato, J.

P.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nModern olive-oil extraction technology generates a large amount of two-phase olive mill waste (TPOMW) in Mediterranean countries, with composting being a viable alternative to the traditional disposal of these residues. Vine branches and grape marc also constitute abundant organic residues in these countries. TPOMW was composted with vine branches and grape mar as bulking agents for use as organic amendment.

Today the documentation of all finite element programs includes a variety of step-by-step examples of differing complexity, and in addition, all software companies offer professional workshops on different topics. As such, rather than competing with these, the book focuses on providing simple examples, often single-element problems, which can easily be related to the theory that is discussed in finite element lectures. This makes it an ideal companion book to classical introductory courses on the finite element method.\n\nFirst Approach to the Analytical Characterization of Barrel-Aged Grape Marc Distillates Using Phenolic Compounds and Colour Parameters\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRaquel RodrÃ­guez-Solana\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Phenolic compounds (benzoic and cinnamic acid derivatives were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with multiple wavelength detector (HPLC-MWD in grape marc distillates aged in Quercus petraea, Quercus robur and Quercus alba wooden barrels. In addition to colour indices and evaluable polyphenols, all samples were described by sensorial analysis. There were signifi cant diff erences in the mean concentrations of the majority of phenolic compounds among the samples. Gallic and benzoic acids were the most abundant and samples aged in Q. robur from Galicia (NW of Spain had the highest concentration of most of the determined ph"
