Biomarkers derived from imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as biomarkers based on the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood, have become immensely important especially for the early identification of individuals who are likely to develop a neurodegenerative disorder, since an established notion is that potentially successful treatments should be deployed as early as possible in the disease process.\n\nThis early identification of neuropathological processes using adequate biomarkers currently not only supports reliable clinical diagnoses but also serves the recruitment of suitable candidates for clinical treatment trials, and renders possible the application of these biomarkers as outcome measures in treatment trials.\n\nIn particular the recent development of methods to map the accumulation of conformationally faulty forms of proteins and the subsequent synaptic impairment in vivo using PET has profoundly changed the way these processes can be identified at an early, presymptomatic disease stage. The Schöll group is using the most recent developments in molecular imaging by means of PET in combination with other neuroimaging- and fluid-based biomarkers, as well as neuropsychological profiling to develop holistic, validated, and usable tools for such an early identification.\n\nCollaborations\n\nThe establishment of the Schöll group was strongly coupled with the recent inauguration of the Imaging- and Intervention Center (Bild- och Interventionscentrum – BoIC) at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital, which for the first time offers resources for research involving molecular imaging modalities in West Sweden.\n\nThe group has furthermore established extensive national collaborations with researchers and clinicians at the University of Gothenburg / The Sahlgrenska University Hospital, and with researchers at Lund University, the Karolinska Institute, and Umeå University. Internationally, the group collaborates actively, amongst others, with researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, University College London, Stanford University, and McGill University\n\nContact Information\n\nMichael Schöll\n\nmichael.scholl@neuro.gu.se\n\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry\n\nSahlgrenska University Hospital\n\nBlå stråket 15, 3rd floor\n\nGothenburg, Sweden\n\nVisiting Addresses:\n\nSahlgrenska University Hospital\n\nMemory Clinic\n\nWallinsgatan 6\n\n431 41 Mölndal\n\nREAL AD\n\nThe REAL AD study is a longitudinal study that aims to advance early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease with a simple blood test and lay the logistical groundwork for widespread use of AD biomarkers in primary care. The study seeks participants aged 50 to 80 in Västra Götaland, encouraging individuals to sign up or share the opportunity.\n\nTo begin, the participants complete mandatory health questionnaires and optimal dementia-related questionnaires digitally via the HOPE study platform. Second, they undertake cognitive assessments using the \"neotivTrials\" app or Cognitron website. Finally, participants make an appointment for a blood test at one of VGR Närhälsan's 106 health centres, which will be analysed with an exhaustive panel of markers in Blennow's lab at the University of Gothenburg. All participants will be invited back 18 months later for another round of remote testing and blood biomarker measurement, followed by cognitive testing alone at 27 and 36 months. To validate the blood tests, select participants will also undergo CSF or PET testing.\n\nWe are live!! The study was launched on April 22, 2024.
