        "text": "City guide to Barcelona's Best Modern Buildings\n\nBarcelona, Spain\n\nText & photos: Kasper Christiansen\n\nSince the construction of Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion for the World Exhibition in 1929, Barcelona has been at the vanguard of modern architecture in Europe. The building by Mies van der Rohe is one of the first so-called modern buildings in Europe. It came out of the Bauhaus school and brought with it a whole new way of thinking architecture.\n\nRead about our Tour to the modern architecture in Barcelona Visit the most important modern architecture in Barcelona together with an expert English-speaking architecture guide.\n\nThe change in style is especially significant in Barcelona. Until the 1920's, Barcelona had been completely dominated by Art Nouveau (called modernisme in Catalan and modernismo in Spanish). With functionalism came a style that was at the same time classic and modern, but first of all was radically opposed to the baroque and ornamented style of Art Nouveau.\n\nHowever, even though early functionalism is closely linked with Barcelona, it is not until recent years that vanguard modernism \"came back to\" Barcelona. Of course, there are exceptions (one significant one is the Fundació Miró by Josep Lluis Sert, a Catalan architect that worked with Le Corbusier in Paris around 1930).\n\nThe Olympic Games and its significance for Barcelona\n\nIn many ways the celebration of the Olympic Games in 1992 meant the beginning of a new era - also in the field of architecture. Out of the Olympic Games in 1992 came a new and more attractive city. 10.000 apartments were built, the beaches were cleaned up, three new highways were constructed and many green areas and parks were designed. Today, Barcelona is a modern and dynamic city.\n\nIn the years up to The Olympic Games Barcelona entered a process of construction that really hasn't stopped again. Old industrial areas were rehabilitated, new parks were designed and a total of more than 300 new buildings were planned by approximately 150 architects.\n\nSince then, new interesting, modern architecture has continued to come up in Barcelona. Today, Barcelona offers an overwhelming amount of fascinating, modern buildings that have changed the urban landscape of Barcelona radically. To name just a few: Norman Foster, Santiago Calatrava, Jean Nouvel and Richard Rogers as well as local architects like Enric Miralles and Ricard Bofill have been building in Barcelona over the last two decades.\n\n14 modern highlights\n\nTo help you choose a few of the most interesting of Barcelona's modern buildings, here is a list of some of the best works.\n\n1. Hotel W by Ricard Bofill\n\nA beautiful building that is home to one of the best hotels in Barcelona. The building looks like a sail, thus the nickname 'Hotel Sail' (Hotel Vela in Spanish), in comparison to the famous Burj Al Arab in Dubai.\n\nHotel W has several interesting restaurants and bars, among these the eclipse bar on the 26th floor, and the Restaurant Bravo on the first run by local gourmet chef Carles Abellan. The building rises towards the sky from the marina in the southern part of Barceloneta. The building has been criticized for being too close to the sea by environmental associations, but it is also acclaimed for being one of the most interesting works of architecture in Barcelona over the last years.\n\nThe architect Ricard Bofill is also the designer of the Terminal 1 and 2 in the Airport of Barcelona and The National Theatre (Teatre Nacional de Catalunya). Abroad he has among other things built the wine cellars of the acclaimed Château Laffite Rothschild.\n\n2. The Communication Tower by Santiago Calatrava\n\nSantiago Calatrava had his breakthrough in Barcelona with this beautiful communications tower. Calatrava rose to fame and was seen for the first time during the Olympic Games in 1992 in Barcelona. Since then, he has turned into an international superstar in modern architecture, building New York, Zurich and Venice.\n\nThe communications tower is a both unique an aesthetically close-to-perfection structure on the Montjuïc Hill in Barcelona that looks like a white dart being thrown at the sky. It can be seen from most points in Barcelona and is today one of the main architectonical attractions of the city. Early drawings and sketches from Calatrava's hand show that the inspiration comes from a kneeling woman.\n\nThe base of the antenna can be seen as a tribute to local architect Antoni Gaudí. It consists of a mosaic of broken tiles in the style of Gaudi's trencadís found in so many of his works: (the rooftops of Palau Güell, Casa Batlló and Casa Milà and in the famous, meandering bench in Park Güell). The Communication Tower changes perspective from different angles, so when you visit it, be sure to walk around it.\n\nCalatrava rose to fame and was for the first time seen as a coming superstar in architecture. Since then Calatrava has been building in New York, Zurich, Venice, etc. The idea of the complex structure of the roof comes from the school designed for Sagrada Familia by Antoni Gaudí. The structure has the form of a hyperbolic paraboloid, one of the favourite geometrical forms of Gaudí.\n\n3. Mercat Santa Catarina by Miralles/Tagliabue\n\nThe Santa Catarina Market, close to La Seu Cathedral, was the first covered market to be built in Barcelona (1848), using the space left by the demolishment of the Santa Catarina convent. In 2005 the market was completely renovated by Enric Miralles and Benedetta Tagliabue from EMBT.\n\nThe idea of the complex structure of the roof comes from the school designed for Sagrada Familia by Antoni Gaudí. The structure has the form of a hyperbolic paraboloid, one of the favorite geometrical forms of Gaudí.\n\n4. The Museum of Modern Art (MACBA) by Richard Meier\n\nThe American architect Richard Meier built the Museum of Modern Art in Barcelona in 1995. Before the construction of the museum this area was a worn down quarter but after the building process finished, new cafés, restaurants, hotels, etc. began to thrive close to the museum. Also, an open space was made in front of the museum on the Plaça dels Angels.\n\nThe museum is a characteristic white building, typical of Meier's other works (for example the Ghetty Museum in Los Angeles). The building is also used for other purposes than exposing art, here among the electronic music festival Sonar.\n\nMore modern architecture - The Diagonal Mar Zone and the 22@-area\n\nThe Diagonal Mar (also called the Forum Area) is the area in Barcelona with some of the most interesting modern architecture to be visited. The area is ideal if you are short on time and do not have a car to get around.\n\nYou can start with the main building in the area, the Forum Building (see above) by the Swiz architects Herzog & de Meuron. Close by, you will find Josep Lluís Mateo's Centre de Convencions Internacional de Barcelona (CCIB) and the Diagonal Zero Zero Tower by Enric Massip Bosch (see above). For this area Zaha Hadid designed the spectacular Torre Espiral, but the building will not be built, since the economical crisis made the proyect non-viable.\n\nCloser to the sea you will see a beautiful structure arise, the Photovoltaic Power Plant by Martinez Lapeña - Torres Arquitectos, providing electricity to more than 1000 houses in the area Diagonal Mar Area. If you continue up the Diagonal Street (in the direction of the city center) and you will see the funny looking Diagonal Mar Park designed by Enric Miralles on your left hand."
