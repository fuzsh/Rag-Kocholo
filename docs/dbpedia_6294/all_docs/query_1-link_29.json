After the passage of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1761 in 1962 in response to South Africa's policy of apartheid, the nation was barred from the Games. (This did not, however, apply to the Paralympics. South Africa made its Paralympic Games d√©but in 1964, and continued to compete until 1976, included, after which the Dutch Parliament declared its participation in the 1980 Summer Games would be undesirable. From then on, South Africa was absent from the Paralympics until 1992. See: South Africa at the Paralympics.[1][2])\n\nAfter the negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa commenced in 1990, the nation was allowed to rejoin the Olympic movement. The South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee was created in 1991, and South Africa returned to the Games at the 1992 Summer Olympics (and the 1992 Summer Paralympics). South Africa also participated in the Winter Olympic Games in 1960, and since 1994.\n\nSouth African athletes have won a total of 73 medals, with athletics, boxing, and swimming as the top medal-producing sports. The most recent Medal was won by the Men's Lightweight Four Rowing Team of Sizwe Ndlovu, Matthew Brittain, John Smith and James Thompson on 2 August 2012 at the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nMedalists[]\n\nSummer Games[]\n\nMedal Name Games Sport Event Gold Reggie Walker 1908 London Athletics Men's 100 metres Silver Template:Sortname 1908 London Athletics Men's Marathon Gold
