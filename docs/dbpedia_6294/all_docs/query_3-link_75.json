        "text": "A tender process for the National Velodrome and Badminton Centre (Dublin, Ireland) project has been given the go-ahead by the Government.\n\n‘THE IRISH TIMES’ stated that the facility will have a 250 meter cycling track and up to 12 badminton courts in the in-track area in addition to spectator seating and ancillary facilities.\n\nIt will be located in the National Sports Campus in Blanchardstown (Dublin, Ireland) and is scheduled to be completed in 2027. The construction of the facility will mean the track cyclists will no longer need to travel abroad to train.\n\n‘THE IRISH TIMES’ quoted the Minister for Sport Catherine Martin as stating that the facility will “support the next generation of athletes. The National Velodrome and Badminton Centre will provide state-of-the-art track cycling facilities for our cycling athletes who currently have to travel abroad for training and competition as well as providing the sport of badminton with a permanent home featuring integrated training, gym and medical facilities. The funding provided to build these training facilities will allow the athletes in both sports to reach optimal performance levels on the international stage.”\n\nThe Minister of State for Sport Thomas Byrne said continued Government investment was “essential” to increasing participation levels in all sports across all sectors of the society.\n\nUnderlined Byrne, “In order to achieve our participation targets, we must continue to provide world-class sporting facilities.”\n\nObserved Dr. Úna May, Sport Ireland Chief Executive, “This is an exhilarating next step in advancing what is already a world-leading location for sport. The National Velodrome and Badminton Centre will provide our athletes with top-class training facilities and will allow us to host competitions right here in Ireland significantly enhancing the high-performance environment on the Sport Ireland campus. It’s exactly the sort of continued investment that is absolutely crucial for boosting participation from grassroots levels to elite athletes. We’re all enjoying the Olympics (Paris 2024) and this will only enhance the high-performing Irish cyclers’ chances of international, Olympic and Paralympic medals in the future.”\n\nThe Sport Ireland, formerly the Irish Sports Council, is a statutory authority that oversees and partly funds the development of sport within Ireland. It is located at the National Sports Campus in the townland of Sheephill near Abbotstown House in Dublin, Ireland.\n\nVelodrome Deets\n\n‘FAULKNERBROWNS ARCHITECTS’ stated that the above project will provide the first indoor velodrome track in Ireland and is part of the wider campus masterplan launched by the Government of Ireland in 2022. With both athlete and community facilities, the centre will aim to encourage participation in sport and promote the benefits of cycling to the wider community.\n\nThe National Velodrome and Badminton Centre will include a 250m cycle track with 12 badminton courts within the infield and around 1,000 permanent seats for the spectators. The other spaces, including the entrance and the café, the changing rooms, the offices, the training facilities, and the bicycle hire/stores will sit under the track at the ground level.\n\n‘FAULKNERBROWNS ARCHITECTS’ further stated that the velodrome will provide a permanent home for Cycling Ireland (national governing body for the sport of cycling in the island of Ireland) and Badminton Ireland (the national governing body for the sport of badminton in Ireland and Northern Ireland) at a landmark venue for national and international events. The building will also be multifunctional with 2,500 temporary seats to accommodate non-sporting events and activities.\n\nThe FaulknerBrowns Architects design proposals feature light- colored, concave metal cladding surrounding the arena level in a continuous ribbon reminiscent of the cycling components. Improvements to the landscape surrounding the centre and within the campus have also been approved including a new pedestrian and cycle route into the site, planting new trees and wildflower meadows and creating sustainable urban drainage features.\n\nNewcastle upon Tyne (UK)-based the FaulknerBrowns Architects is a creative, international practice experienced in making buildings and places where people do better. They have a reputation for using their expertise and experience to question the traditional typologies, challenging what a particular building or place may look like, how it might be used, and the ways it can impact the society.\n\nThe design studio is recognized for their work in architectural design, master planning and strategic thinking. Their team of talented architects, designers and technologists deliver projects of varying scale and complexity for the clients internationally.\n\nContinue to follow Coliseum for latest updates on venues business news.
