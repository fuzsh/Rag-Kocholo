        "text": "Justus of Ghent (flourished 1460–80, Urbino?, duchy of Urbino [Italy]) was a Netherlandish painter who has been identified with Joos van Wassenhove, a master of the painters’ guild at Antwerp in 1460 and at Ghent in 1464.\n\nIn Justus’s earliest known painting, the Crucifixion triptych (c. 1465), the attenuated, angular figures and the barren landscape articulated by short, taut curves reveal the influence of the painter Dieric Bouts. The Adoration of the Magi (c. 1466) shows the continued influence of Bouts in its figures. In 1473–74 Justus of Ghent was in Italy, where he painted the Communion of the Apostles. This is the only absolutely authenticated picture by the master. It was painted at the bidding of Federico da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino, who was introduced into the picture. Although this work is unmistakably Netherlandish, it shows that Justus had begun to be influenced by the simplicity of composition and idealization of forms characteristic of the Early Renaissance style in Italy. Several of the 28 portraits of famous men that decorated the duke’s studiolo have also been definitely attributed to Justus. Uncertainty remains about the attribution of several paintings to the Spaniard Pedro Berruguete, who is believed to have worked with Justus during his tenure in Urbino from approximately 1475 to 1478.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWho Painted the Most Expensive Paintings in the World?\n\nJustus brought his northern traditions to Italy and there combined them with those of the Italian school. His development was gradual, and his later works are difficult to distinguish from those of Italian masters."
