        "text": "After nine straight days of winning medals, Day 10 was the first day of Paris 2024 that Team Canada struck out from reaching the podium. Nevertheless, Team Canada athletes put on a show–here’s what you need to know.\n\nParis 2024 Competition Schedule\n\n3×3 Basketball\n\nCanada lost its semifinal and bronze medal match in 3×3 basketball and will leave Paris with a fourth place finish.\n\nThe quartet of Katherine Plouffe, Michelle Plouffe, Paige Crozon, and Kacie Bosch had high hopes of medalling in Canada’s first Olympic 3×3 basketball appearance, but came up short in two close and competitive games on Monday.\n\nFirst they lost to the eventual gold medallists Germany by one point in the semifinal – a German basket in the dying seconds sealed a 16-15 win.\n\nIn the bronze medal game, Canada had an edge on the U.S., but gave up a 7-1 run in the closing minutes. The Americans won 16-13 to take bronze.\n\nCanada finishes in fourth place with a 5-5 record. All five of their losses came to teams that qualified for the semifinal round.\n\nDiving\n\nCaeli McKay and Kate Miller competed in the preliminary round of the women’s 10m platform. McKay posted the third-highest score in the prelims, moving on to the semifinal. Miller placed 20th in the prelims, missing out on advancing to the semifinal by two spots.\n\nIn the semifinal, McKay posted a score of 308.85 to place seventh, advancing her to the 12-person final on Tuesday.\n\n“The job’s done for today. The job’s not done for the whole event,” said McKay. “I’m really happy I made the finals. It was a very up and down day. I had some good stuff. I had some not so great stuff. Overall, I was relatively consistent, which I was really happy with. I have a lot of stuff I can improve on, so I’m quite relieved with that.”\n\nREAD: McKay & Miller remain proud after fourth-place finish in 10m synchro at Paris 2024\n\nParis 2024 Olympic Games Information Hub\n\nAthletics\n\nAlysha Newman and Anicka Newell competed in the women’s pole vault qualification. Newman cleared 4.55m to move on to the final. Newell cleared 4.40m, and will not advance to the final.\n\nIn the first round of the men’s 3000m steeplechase, Jean-Simon Desgagnés ran an 8:25.28 to secure his place in the final.\n\nIn the first round of the men’s 200m Brendon Rodney ran a season’s best time of 20.30, but it was not enough for an auto-qualification, and he will move on to a repechage heat. Aaron Brown raced to a time of 20.36 in his heat, and will also advance to the repechage. Andre De Grasse secured himself a spot straight to the semifinals with a 20.30 by finishing second in his heat.\n\nZoe Sherar raced in the first round of the women’s 400m, running a time of 51.97. She will move on to a repechage heat. Lauren Gale also raced in the women’s 400m, running a time of 53.13. She will also move on to a repechage heat.\n\nAudrey Leduc and Jacqueline Madogo raced for Canada in the women’s 200m semifinals. Leduc clocked a 22.68 to finish sixth in her heat, while Madogo finished with a 22.81 to finish seventh in her heat. The last time Canada had two women in the 200m semifinal was 1976. Neither Leduc or Madogo advanced to the final.\n\nArtistic Swimming\n\nCanada is in seventh place after the team technical routine, the first of three routines that will count towards the final result. The Canadian team scored 262.4808 and look ahead to the free routine on Tuesday.\n\nBeach Volleyball\n\nTeam Canada beach volleyball duo Melissa Humana-Paredes and Brandie Wilkerson took down the American team of Kristen Nuss and Taryn Kloth in two sets (21-19, 21-18). The Canadians now advance to the quarterfinals.\n\nWrestling\n\nLinda Morais was the first Canadian wrestler to see action at Paris 2024. She was defeated 8-2 by Nigeria’s Blessing Oborududu in a 1/8 final in the women’s 68kg event.\n\nTrack Cycling\n\nKelsey Mitchell, Lauriane Genest, and Sarah Orban placed eighth in the final of the women’s team sprint.\n\nTyler Rorke, Nick Wammes, and James Hedgcock are ranked eighth after qualifying of the men’s team sprint heading into Tuesday’s first round.\n\nThe men’s team pursuit squad of Dylan Bibic, Mathias Guillemette, Michael Foley and Carson Mattern ranked eighth in qualification, which moves them onto the first round on Tuesday, but the best they can finish overall is fifth.\n\nSailing\n\nSarah Douglas finished 10th in the opening race series of the ILCA 6 class. She will compete in the medal race tomorrow, taking the final qualifying spot after nine races. After five races in the Formula Kite class, Emily Bugeja sits in 19th place.\n\nEquestrian – Jumping\n\nTeam Canada was represented by Mario Deslauriers (Emerson), Erynn Ballard (Nikka Vd Bisschop) and Tiffany Foster (Figor) in individual jumping. Deslauriers was the top Canadian, finishing in 31st (74.93), followed by Ballard in 37th (76.60), and Foster in 50th (76.78). None of the Canadians will advance to the final.\n\nTable Tennis"
