        "text": "British Olympian Katie Archibald dislocated her ankle, broke her lower leg and 'ripped' two ligaments off the bone during the accident\n\nOlympic cyclist Katie Archibald has had to pull out of this summer‚Äôs Paris 2024 Olympics following an accident in her backyard.\n\nOn Thursday, June 20, the two-time British Olympic champion, 30, revealed a trip in her backyard led to her not only dislocating her ankle, but also breaking her leg and damaging her ligaments.\n\n‚ÄúI tripped over a step in the garden and managed to, somehow, dislocate my ankle; break my tibia and fibula; and rip two ligaments off the bone. What the heck,‚Äù her Instagram caption read as she shared two photos of herself from the hospital.\n\nIn the first snap, Archibald smiled slightly as she looked at the camera while sitting in bed.\n\nShe then shared a photo of her left leg in a cast with an arrow drawn at the bottom of her thigh and over her knee.\n\nRelated: Team USA's Paris Olympics Uniforms Are Here and Dangerously Cool, According to One Athlete ‚Äî See the Looks\n\n‚ÄúThat was on Tuesday, and since then I've been in full princess mode (assuming it took a full team of A&E doctors and nurses to get Cinderella's foot back in line with the slipper üëç),‚Äù she added before stating that her surgery ‚Äúto pin the bones back together and reattach the ligaments‚Äù took place on Wednesday.\n\nArchibald added that she hopes to head home ‚Äúthis afternoon,‚Äù as well as sharing her thanks with the hospital staff at Manchester Royal Infirmary.\n\n‚ÄúA hundred apologies for what this means for the Olympic team, which I've been told won't involve me,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI'm still processing that bit of news, but thought I better confirm it publicly instead of leaving it to the grapevine (trip hazard and all that).‚Äù\n\nRelated: Simone Manuel Has ‚ÄòHealing‚Äô Race to Qualify for Paris Olympics After Dealing with Frustrating Illness\n\nShe then signed the post off with, ‚ÄúMight be back with more updates, might be gone from the socials for a bit - TBC. Ciao for now. Katie x.‚Äù\n\n\"Wishing you a speedy recovery, Katie ‚ù§Ô∏è,\" wrote Team GB in the comment section, while six-time Olympic gold medalist Chris Hoy added, \"Oh Katie‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry. What an absolute kick in the teeth. Get well soon and rest up. ‚ù§Ô∏è.\"\n\nBritish Cycling also shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) amid the athlete‚Äôs injury news.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\n‚ÄúEarlier this week, Katie Archibald had an accident at home which has resulted in a broken ankle which she has since had surgery on,‚Äù the organisation wrote. ‚ÄúFollowing medical advice, this unfortunately means that Katie will be unable to compete at the upcoming Olympic Games.‚Äù\n\n\"We share in Katie‚Äôs heartbreak over her injury, and the cruel manner in which she has been denied the chance to ride for the medals she so coveted in Paris,\" the post continued. \"Our focus is now on providing Katie with the best possible support as she begins her recovery, and we know that the whole cycling community will be right behind her for every step.\"\n\nNever miss a story ‚Äî sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nArchibald first won gold at the Olympics at Rio 2016 in the team pursuit competition.
