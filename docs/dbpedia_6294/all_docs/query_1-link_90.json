        "text": "Advertisement\n\nThat's all for today!\n\nWhat a day of action it has been. The Olympics never disappoints. Good news is, we get to do it all again tomorrow! We hope you have enjoyed our coverage and please join us for another day of top-tier sport tomorrow.\n\nMatt Hudson-Smith's didn't know his family were watching him secure Olympic silver!\n\nMatt Hudson-Smith reflects on his silver...\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, he said: 'sometimes the journey is better than the outcome. It's been a hell of a journey and I’m grateful'.\n\n'Olympic silver, not many can say that.I saw my family, I didn’t even know they were here! Bit of a shocker really, I hate them watching me!\n\n'It’s been a hell of a journey. We knew it would come down from the 50, he had another gear, I hit it a little bit too late. But this is just the start, my time is going to come.\n\n'I thought I’d cleared the field, I knew someone was going to come but I wasnt trying to ease up and he got me on the line. It happens. It’s been crazy, I’ve just got to keep building on it.'\n\nWell, that's pretty cool!\n\nMeanwhile, history for Jamaica!\n\nLin Yu Ting makes the 57KG boxing final by beating Esra Yildiz Kahraman!\n\nGender row boxer Lin Yu-ting will fight for an Olympic gold medal after defeating Turkey's Esra Kahraman in the semi-final of the women's 57kg division.\n\nREAD OUR FULL REPORT HERE.\n\nMatthew Hudson-Smith denied gold but claims silver for GB!\n\nGreat Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith claimed his first Olympic medal with silver in a 400 metres final won by American Quincy Hall.\n\nThe Wolverhampton athlete was leading into the closing stages when Hall found another gear to snatch gold in a personal-best 43.40.\n\nHudson-Smith finished four hundredths of a second behind to lower his own European record, with Zambia's Muzala Samukonga claiming bronze.\n\nHall's winning time to beat world silver-medallist Hudson-Smith was good enough for the fifth-fastest in history at 400m.\n\nNEXT UP: Matthew Hudson-Smith...\n\nMatthew Hudson-Smith is looking to become the first British man since Eric Liddell in 1924 to claim Olympic gold in the men's 400m.\n\nHudson-Smith cruised to a victory in his semi-final with a time of 44.07, easing up down the stretch after building a sizeable lead over his rivals.\n\nWhile Hudson-Smith is heavily favoured to secure top spot on the podium - he isn't without his fair share of competition tonight.\n\nUSA's Quincy Hall - who qualified with a strong time of 43.95 - is tipped to do well this evening.\n\nWomen's 400m semi-finals...\n\nKlaver picked up a yellow card in the first semi-final after her hand went up before the gun. She remained in the race but the athletes had to reset on the starting block. It ended up being Eid Naser, Adeleke, Jaeger who finished in the top three spots.\n\nMeanwhile, there was another false start in the second semi-final but this time it was Nielsen. She was awarded a yellow card before returning to the starting block.\n\nPaulino of Dominican Republic crossed the finish line first, with Holmes coming in second for the US. Nielsen came in third but unfortunately it's not enough to take her into the final, as Klaver and third-placed Jaeger in the first semi-final registered better times.\n\nThe third and final semi-final also saw Kaczmarek come first, Anning of Great Britain come second and Williams of Barbados come third.\n\nMen's 200m semi-finals take place\n\nBednarek made it look easy during the first semi-final in 20s flat. Alexander Ogando of the Dominican Republic came in second while Andre de Grasse came in third with a time of 20.41.\n\nIn the second semi-final, Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo emerged victorious with a time of 19.96s. While Noah Lyles came in second at 20.08. It was Makanakaishe Charamba who came in third with a time of 20.31s.\n\nThe final semi-final saw US wonderkid Erriyon Knighton emerge victorious with a time of 20.09s.Liberia’s Joe Fahnbulleh cames second in 20.12s and Zimbabwe’s Tapiwanashe Makarawu came in third in 20.16s.\n\nGB fall at the seventh hurdle in the men's 400m hurdles!\n\nAlastair Chalmers fell over the seventh hurdle in the men's 400m hurdles on Wednesday evening. As a result, he finished last in his semi-final.\n\nThe final will feature world record holder Karsten Warholm of Norway, Alison dos Santos of Brazil, and Rai Benjamin of the USA.\n\nDisappointment for GB in 100m hurdles...\n\nGB will not feature in the men's 100m as Tade Ojora finished seventh in his semi-final. Instead, it will feature a US trio of Daniel Roberts, Grant Holloway and Freddie Crittenden alongside a Jamaican trio of Hansle Parchment, Rasheed Broadbell and Orlando Bennett.\n\nIt was another gripping race!\n\nGB claim bronze in team pursuit!\n\nElinor Barker, Josie Knight, Anna Morris and Jess Roberts won bronze for Great Britain in the women's team pursuit.\n\nThe Team GB quartet were behind Italy for much of the race but came storming back in the final kilometre to win by two and a half seconds.\n\nIt was a strong result for a team that had to quickly recalibrate their plans for these Games after two-time Olympic champion Katie Archibald, one of the strongest track riders in the world, broke her ankle in June to be ruled out of the Games.\n\nGB go for gold... again!\n\nElinor Barker, Josie Knight, Anna Morris and Jessica Roberts will take to the velodrome next for a chance at the gold medal. They will take on the Italian quartet of Elisa Balsamo, Martina Fidanza, Vittoria Guazzini and Chiara Consonni.\n\nGB are looking to pick-up their fourth successive Olympic medal in this event - having claimed gold in 2012 and 2016 before securing silver in Tokyo.\n\nNot bad going!\n\nEthan Hayter: 'We were so close, I could see it!'\n\nTeam GB spoke to BBC shortly after picking up silver in the team pursuit. Hayter, who almost fell off his bike at the end, spoke first, saying: 'We were so close and I could see it.\n\n'It was nearly five laps at the end and I just really gave too much, and my whole body went weak and I really struggled to hold myself on the bike in the end.\n\n'Sorry to the guys but I think we gave everything and we can be proud of that silver medal.\n\n'We were super happy to win a silver medal but it was really there for the taking for us and we kind of knew that. We went out to get it but just came short in the end, so it’s a shame.'\n\nDan Bigham went on to add: 'We rode the fastest ride we have ever done on every ride”, and “literally we all gave it everything”.\n\n'It was scrappy because you are on the limit. You are riding quicker than you have ever ridden before and as Ethan said we probably gave it that little bit too much. We are really leaning on him at the moment because he is anchoring the team and he has the legs to do it.\n\n'At the end of the day Ethan is still human and it is on us to make sure we deliver him in that best place and we maybe gave him a bit too much work to do there.'\n\nTake a look for yourself...\n\nHow Ethan Hayter lost control of his bike!\n\nGreat Britain won silver in the men's team pursuit at Paris 2024 to deliver Great Britain's 1,000th medal in Olympic history.\n\nAustralia had been narrowly ahead on the time splits for almost the entire race, but their victory was effectively confirmed long before they crossed the line as Ethan Hayter lost control of his bike with a little under 400 metres to go.\n\nAlthough he somehow remained upright, Hayter dropped down on to the top tube of the bike and lost all momentum, allowing Australia to ease over the line.\n\nWhat a race that was...\n\nHeartbreak for Team GB!\n\nHeartbreak for Team GB on the last lap of the race! Ethan Hayter did well to stay upright but their hopes of gold disapeared in that split second. It's Australia who emerge victorious.\n\nItaly take men’s team pursuit bronze\n\nItaly have secured the bronze medal finishing in a time of 3:44.197 after Denmark struggled to maintain their pace on the final couple of laps.\n\nMeanwhile, New Zealand finished fifth ahead of France earlier, while Canada came seventh and Belgium came eighth.\n\nTeam GB go for gold!\n\nTeam GB will be going for gold in the men's team pursuit final shortly. They are looking to overthrow world record holders Australia.\n\nGB have made one change to the team that qualified. Dan Bigham has come in to replace Ollie Wood.\n\nMake sure you stay tuned as we bring you live updates!\n\nAustralia take gold in Skateboarding!\n\nAustralia’s Keegan Palmer claims gold in the men's park final in skateboarding. He secured a score of 93.11 to beat USA's Tom Schaar. Meanwhile, Brazil's Augusto Akio managed to get his hands on bronze.\n\nBut, not did they claim medals, they also recieved a standovation from the likes of Snoop Dogg and skateboarding icon Tony Hawk.\n\nWhat you can expect tonight...\n\nSo, what is the schedule:\n\nWomen's pole vault final\n\nMen's 400m hurdles semi-finals (Featuring GB's Alistair Chalmers)\n\nMen's 200m semi-finals (featuring Noah Lyles)\n\nMen's discus final\n\nWomen's 400m semi-finals (Featuring GB's Amber Anning, Laviai Nielsen, and Victoria Ohuruogo)\n\nMen's 400m final (featuring GB's Matt Hudson-Smith)\n\nMen's 3000m steeplechase final\n\nNo better time...\n\nLot's more to come this evening!\n\nWhat a night of action we have to come.\n\nWe have everything from the artistic swimming final to the women's pole vault final. Not to mention the men's 200m semi-finals and the men's 400m & 110m hurdles sem-finals!\n\nSo, make sure you stay tuned as we take you along for the ride!\n\nLet's switch it up!\n\nI think you guys have heard enough from me, don't you?\n\nWell, you'll be happy to know that it's time for me to leave this blog (I know you are all smiling as you read this).\n\nI am handing over to the wonderful Charlotte Daly who will take you through all tonight's action.\n\nIt's going to be one hell of a night!\n\nTurnbull OUT\n\nOh no, Hamish Turnbull is lagging behind Azizulhasni Awang.\n\nThe Malaysian rider is pulling away, but wait, Turnbull is starting to respond.\n\nThe Brit is gaining, and gaining, but he has left it too late - Awang crosses the line first.\n\nTurnbull has to settle for the repechage.\n\nTurnbull's time to shine\n\nIt's time for Hamish Turnbull...\n\nHe is up and running now in his last 16 ride, can he follow in Jack Carlin's footsteps?\n\nIt's going to be tough.\n\nCarlin qualifies for quarters\n\nThat is how it's done.\n\nJack Carlin makes light work of Cristian Ortega of Colombia as he leads the whole way before coasting over the line.\n\nBeautiful riding and that's him through.\n\nAnother Aussie goes through\n\nThese quarter-finals are flying by.\n\nAnother Australian has just put the gauntlet down, Leigh Hoffman. He joins Matthew Richardson in the quarter-finals.\n\nGuess who's next?\n\nYes, Jack Carlin of Great Britain. Can he book his place in the next round?\n\nDominant Richardson\n\nMy word. Now that is what you call dominance from Matthew Richardson.\n\nThe Australian has just battered Vasilijus Lendel, he accelerated away from him as if he was not there.\n\nI expected him to win, but that is a statement.\n\nMen's sprint last 16 begin\n\nNow it's time to get excited.\n\nThe velodrome is back in action and we start with the men's sprint quarter-finals.\n\nGreat Britain have both Jack Carlin and Hamish Turnbull in action in this one, if they win, they go through. If they don't, the repechage awaits.\n\nWorld Record holder Harrie Lavreysen has just gone up first and cruised through, which was to be expected.\n\nThese races are rapid, so Carlin will be up very soon.\n\nKenny: 'GB favourites for bronze'\n\nLaura Kenny, Five-time Olympic gold medalist in cycling, on BBC Sport:\n\nThe second ride from Team GB was brilliant, it was the fastest a British team has ever gone. You can't ask for more than that really. For the bronze medal against Italy, I think they are the favourites going into that ride.\n\nGB women take on Italy for Bronze\n\nWe could get two medals in team pursuit tonight if we are lucky.\n\nThe women were just edged out by the USA, who will partake in the gold medal race, but they will still battle for bronze.\n\nBritain go up against Italy and are strong favourites to take home a medal, they beat them by over two seconds earlier today.\n\nStrap yourselves in everyone, the forecast is that it will be training medals later this evening on the tracks and beyond.\n\nApologies for the rubbish jokes...\n\nWATCH: How team pursuit qualified\n\nWhen I tell you these lads are rapid, I mean it.\n\nYesterday they nearly broke the world record in qualification to the gold medal race.\n\nJust look at them going, they are burning up the track. Fire extinguishers will need to be on standby for the final.\n\nI feel that record will go tonight.\n\nMen's team pursuit going for gold\n\nTonight has the potential to be golden for Team GB...\n\nAs well as Matt Hudson-Smith going in the 400m final at the Stade de France, Great Britain are also in a final in the cycling.\n\nThe men's team pursuit are set to take on Australia this evening in what could be a belter of a final.\n\nBritain have struck gold in this event in three of the last four Olympics, so it's in their DNA.\n\nCan the quartet of Ethan Hayter, Ollie Wood, Dan Bigham, and Ethan Vernon bring it home again?\n\nWe will have to wait and see.\n\nToday's headlines\n\nWill a day of the Olympics ever be uneventful? Of course not.\n\nDay 12 has been just like every other day, packed with action. There is still so much more to come too.\n\nLet's take a look back at today's biggest headlines before getting stuck in this evening, eh?\n\nMicky Beckett missed out on a medal in the men's dinghy after the final run was re-started due to light winds.\n\nGeorge Mills of Team GB was involved in a heated argument with France's Hugo Hay after he was involved in a dramatic collision in the 5000m heats, but he has qualified for the final still.\n\nTeam GB's women have qualified for the bronze medal race in the team pursuit.\n\nCharley Hull is rock bottom in the women's gold after a nightmare first day\n\nHudson-Smith's hunt for gold\n\nIs it Matt Hudson-Smith's time?\n\nThe Great Britain 400m runner is looking to follow in Keely Hodgkinson's footsteps by winning gold on the track tonight.\n\nHe has been in imperious form this year and is a narrow favourite to strike gold come 8.30pm this evening.\n\nIt won't be easy, though.\n\nThe legendary Kirani James, who won gold in the event at London 2012, will be in the lane next to him.\n\nJames is aiming for his fourth consecutive Olympic medal in the event after silver in Rion, and bronze at Tokyo.\n\nThen there is Michael Norman, the world champion in 2022 will be looking to bring glory back to the United States.\n\nThere are going to be fireworks in this final.\n\n'Tough week for Beckett'\n\nShirley Robertson, Two-time Olympic gold medallist, speaking on BBC Sport:\n\nMickey Beckett is going to be heartbroken. It has been a tough week. When he looks back at this medal race, there was a lot of desperation, a lot of errors. Really really tough.\n\nTonight at the Stade de France\n\nEvery night is a cracking one when it comes to Athletics.\n\nThis evening will be no different, there are some huge races last the Stad de France this evening.\n\nMany Brit's are involved, and there is even a certain Noah Lyles too.\n\nSo, what is the schedule:\n\nWomen's pole vault final\n\nMen's 400m hurdles semi-finals (Featuring GB's Alistair Chalmers)\n\nMen's 200m semi-finals (featuring Noah Lyles)\n\nMen's discus final\n\nWomen's 400m semi-finals (Featuring GB's Amber Anning, Laviai Nielsen, and Victoria Ohuruogo)\n\nMen's 400m final (featuring GB's Matt Hudson-Smith)\n\nMen's 3000m steeplechase final\n\nWearn sails to GOLD\n\nIt's back-to-back golds for Australia's Matt Wearn!\n\nHe flies over the line to win the men's dinghy in style, what a performance from the Aussie sailor.\n\nCyprus' Pavlos Kontides gets silver yet again and Stefano Peschiera holds on for the bronze.\n\nThat means that Micky Beckett misses out on the medals, so cruel.\n\nPenalty for Peschiera and Beckett\n\nStefano Peschiera and Micky Beckett are really struggling in their battle over the bronze in the men's dinghy.\n\nThe Peruvian sailor is first to get a penalty and you are thinking that Beckett has a late boost.\n\nBut then he gets a penalty himself...\n\nThey now close in for the line and the bronze has slipped through the Briton's fingers, he will finish fourth.\n\nDevastating.\n\n'Difficult start for Beckett'\n\nShirley Robertson, Two-time Olympic gold medallist, speaking on BBC Sport:\n\nWhat a difficult start for Mickey Beckett. It is very light winds, it is hard to manouvre. They are not even hiking out, they are not at full power.\n\nBeckett struggling\n\nOh dear, not a good start for Micky Beckett.\n\nThe Briton started so well in the previous run before it was abandoned, but he is having a nightmare this time.\n\nHe has already been penalised twice...\n\nBeckett is still in the fight for bronze, but it is going to be a monumental start after the start he has had.\n\nA long way to go, though.\n\nSaling back underway\n\nThe wind is back, and you know what that means...\n\nAfter the men's dinghy final was abandoned earlier due to light winds, the action has re-started.\n\nMicky Bennett qualified in fourth but was second when the last race was abandoned.\n\nThat means nothing now, though, he has to do it all again.\n\nMacdonald: 'Experience of a lifetime'\n\nAndy Macdonald, GB's 51-year-old skater, speaking to the BBC:\n\nThat is how you're supposed to do it, get your run down, and then everything else is a bonus. Experience of a lifetime being at the Olympics. The first run I didn't do the gnarly heel flick. That's a trick I invented and I didn't want to bail on a trick that I invented.\n\nThen on my second round I put that in, then in my third round I put in the fake 540 that is the one that did it for me in Budapest, it was totally bonus if I could make it here. I did a backflip for the fans, thank you, and good night.\n\nIt was a long shot from the get-go. Thanks to Team GB for getting me here, paying for the plane tickets and getting me to the six stops on the tour. There is very few things that bring the world together, sport is one of those things and the Olympics is one of them.\n\nBrits on the bike\n\nIt was a brilliant morning on the bike from Great Britain.\n\nThat's just the beginning as well, many of them will be back later today as they continue to compete for medals.\n\nHere are some of the best shots from Team GB's cyclists from this morning's action.\n\nThe top is my favourite, Jack Carlin is really concentrating there...\n\n'Spectacular Macdonald'\n\nEd Leigh, skateboarding commentator, on BBC Sport:\n\nA scream coming from the famous yellow helmet of Andy Macdonald - that's to everyone who says you're too old. I show you Andy Macdonald, 51 years of age, and laying down a competitor run. Take a bow, that was spectacular.\n\nWhat's on tonight at the Velo?\n\nThere will be a little break from the action at the velodrome, but not to worry, it won't be for long.\n\nSo, what is on this evening on the track:\n\nMen's sprint last 16 (featuring GB's Jack Carlin and Hamish Turnbull)\n\nMen's team pursuit finals (GB in gold medal race)\n\nWomen's team pursuit finals (GB in bronze medal race)\n\nMen's sprint quarter-finals\n\nWATCH: Marchant makes it through\n\nThat look like it hurt.\n\nIf you didn't manage to catch Katy Marchant's keirin repechage, here it is.\n\nShe went early and it just about paid off, but my word I bet her legs were in pain by the line.\n\nCyclists really are made of tough stuff.\n\nEnjoying every second\n\nSeeing these photos, all you can do is smile.\n\nAndy Macdonald is just living his best life in Paris. No pressure, just vibes.\n\nI could add about another 30 photos to this post where Macdonald is beaming with delight.\n\nI'll stick to just a couple.\n\nNetherlands through to hockey final\n\nSome things never change, do they?\n\nIn women's hockey, the Netherlands have just dismantled Argentina 3-0 to book their place in the gold medal match.\n\nIt will be their sixth successive Olympic final, that's just a ridiculous level of consistency.\n\nThey will wait to see whether it's Belgium or China who they will meet on Friday 9 August.\n\nThe second semi-final begins at 18:00 BST.\n\nWATCH: Macdonald impresses\n\nLet's take a look at Andy Macdonald in action.\n\nThis is his first run, the lowest scoring of his three, but he still showed what he has in his locker.\n\nAnd just look at his smile, I don't imagine anybody will be able to wipe that off his face for a long time.\n\nWatch, and enjoy.\n\nMacdonald finishes 18th\n\nWhat a final run from Andy Macdonald.\n\nHe improves with every round to finish in 18th. The result is not what matters to him, though. He just had a belting time.\n\nAs a pioneer of the sport alongside Tony Hawk, he must be buzzing to be at an Olympic Games.\n\nI bet he never thought this day would come.\n\nMacdonald loving life\n\nAndy Macdonald is having the time of his life.\n\nHe currently sits in 18th after two runs but he does not care one bit, he is just happy to be there.\n\nThe amount of 'wooos' he belted out after that second run just showed what a great time he is having.\n\nHe did it so much it was tough to count, I got to seven and gave up.\n\nIt's what you love to see.\n\nGB's Marchant in keirin quarters\n\nJob done for Katy Marchant.\n\nShe will have been a bit bummed out that she even had to race the repechage, but it's better than not progressing, right?\n\nShe broke away from the group early and the riders started to catch her on the final straight.\n\nBut she held onto make it through to the quarter-finals of the keirin in second.\n\nGreat racing, Katy!\n\nMen's dinghy abandoned\n\nYou have got to be kidding me...\n\nThe men's dinghy is being affected by light winds again and the race has been abandoned.\n\nMicky Bennett had risen to second, but that doesn't matter anymore, he has to start all over again.\n\nGutting for the Briton.\n\nMacdonald takes to the park\n\nWow, Andy Macdonald is some skater.\n\nThe legendary Tony Hawk claps his the Brit as he starts his run - they have skated together for years.\n\nMacdonald starts his run really well with some superb tricks, he is having a great time out there.\n\nBut he overshoots one and falls out of the park.\n\nHe doesn't care though, the Brit has a huge beaming smile as he walks away from his first run, throwing his board into the air.\n\nHe scores 72.07, which puts him 19th on the leaderboard with two runs to go. The top eight qualify for the final.\n\nHorrible round for Hull\n\nHull and Hall are not having a very good day at the golf...\n\nGreat Britain's Charley Hull has finished the first round at the foot of the leaderboard, posting a whopping nine-over 81.\n\nIf you don't know what that means, it's basically not very good.\n\nHer team-mate Georgia Hall has also struggled this morning, she is three over after nine.\n\nA bad day for the Brits on the course.\n\nBritain's Beckett into silver medal position\n\nWow, what a start from Micky Beckett!\n\nThe Team GB sailor has had a dream start in the em's dinghy as Pavlos Kontides and Stefano Peschiera have both been penalised.\n\nI mean, it's early days so don't get too excited, but it's a perfect start.\n\n51-year-old Macdonald's time is here\n\nWhat a story, eh?\n\nGreat Britain's Andy Macdonald is about to take part in the men's skateboard park at the age of 51.\n\nThat's not far off my dad's age, and I'm pretty sure he couldn't even get two feet on a board let alone do tricks.\n\nImpressive stuff, it's going to be fantastic to watch.\n\nSailing is on... finally\n\nIn Sailing you need wind, and there just simply hasn't been any in France.\n\nWell, the breeze has finally decided to pick up a little bit, meaning the sailing can finally take place.\n\nThe men's dinghy medal race is now underway Micky Beckett of Great Britain, who is a two-time world medalist, is in action.\n\nHe qualified fourth, so a medal is certainly a realistic dream.\n\nCan it be achieved? We will have to wait and see.\n\nTurnbull takes it\n\nPhoar, that really was close.\n\nHamish Turnbull holds back and closely follows his pray until he launches at the bell.\n\nIt takes him longer than he would like to get around Zhou, but he flies past him in the knick of time.\n\nJob done, he's through to the next round.\n\nTurnbull time\n\nI told you these heats go quickly.\n\nBritain's Hamish Turbuull is up next in the men's sprint, he is up against China's Zhou Yu.\n\nI foresee this being a very tightly fought race.\n\nThey are both on their bikes and raring to go, who will come out on top?\n\nComfortable for Carlin\n\nLight work for Jack Carlin.\n\nHe just sits off Tyler Rorke until it's go time, then whoosh, like a bullet he flies past him and its curtains.\n\nHe even eases off over the line, which looked fairly comfortable for the Brit.\n\nHe claimed bronze in Tokyo, so it isn't really a surprise.\n\nCarlin goes in heat five\n\nIt's nearly Carlin time!\n\nWe are just a couple of heats away from seeing British rider Jack Carlin, who was part of the team sprint trio to win silver yesterday.\n\nHe goes up against Canada's Tyler Rorke, which is by no means an easy race.\n\nExpect it to be pacy...\n\nAustralia's Richardson safely through\n\nThese riders really don't hang about, do they?\n\nMatthew Richardson of Australia makes light work of Sirmanese cyclist Jaïr Tjon En Fa.\n\nI mean, it's not a surprise. The Aussie briefly held the world record this morning before it was broken not long after.\n\nHe is certainly one of the favourites for gold.\n\nTime for men's sprint\n\nNow the excitement ramps up a bit.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love a bit of team pursuit, but there isn't any event for exciting than the sprint.\n\nTwo riders against each other playing a bit of cat and mouse before an all-out sprint to the line.\n\nWinners go through, while the losers face a repechage. The action is just enthralling.\n\nGreat Britain have two riders in the heats, Jack Carlin and Hamish Turnbull.\n\nCan they make it through?\n\nGB go for Bronze\n\nAnd breathe...\n\nGreat Britain are in the hunt for bronze as they beat Italy's time by a monster two seconds. That's a lot.\n\nWith the time they have posted, you'd expect a bronze medal has their name on it, right?\n\nWell, it's the Olympics - anything can happen.\n\nNew Zealand will race for GOLD\n\nNow that is what you call a demolition.\n\nNew Zealand tore up the track and they pulled away from the European Champions Italy with ease.\n\nFor a while they were on world record pace, but they seemed to back off on the last lap.\n\nThat record is there for the taking in the final.\n\n'Great to watch'\n\nChris Boardman, Olympic cycling champion, speaking on BBC Two:\n\nWhen I saw the team from America go slower at the start, I thought that was the opportunity to go for it, but they tidied up so much. When it was so close and I saw the tyre going, it was close. Great to watch. Both teams were hugely faster than yesterday, that's a lot to ask. It's huge.\n\nGreat Britain await their fete...\n\nIt's a waiting game now for Great Britain.\n\nTheir time of 4.04.908 seconds should be enough for the bronze medal race, but you just never know.\n\nThey will be eagerly watching this race between New Zealand and Italy. The Kiwis are currently flying.\n\nI bet the nerves in the GB camp are jangling, right now.\n\nUSA hold off Team GB!\n\nOh my word, this is so, so close!\n\nGreat Britain are suddenly catching the US, they are reeling them in. But is it too late?\n\nIt is. USA take the race by just a quarter of a second. They qualify for the gold medal race.\n\nI really thought Britain had done it for a second, but it just wasn't to be.\n\nWhat a race!\n\nAnd they're off...\n\nThanks, Luke. You have steered the ship excellently.\n\nI am straight into the action with the women's team pursuit and after 1750m, USA are just three-tenths of a second ahead of Great Britain.\n\nIt's ridiculously tight, I can't call it.\n\nBritain have work to do, but they aren't out of it just yet.\n\nFuming French skateboarder volleys his helmet into the air after slip-up\n\nSacré bleu!\n\nFrench skater Vincent Matheron took his rage out on his helmet after falling off his board.\n\nNot sure he's directing the blame in the right direction there.\n\nAnd now, I'm handing you over to Harry Bamforth for the women's team pursuit race and the rest of the afternoon.\n\nTeam GB up soon in the women's team pursuit\n\nHold your horses - and your bikes - because we have more Team GB action up shortly.\n\nElinor Barker, Josie Knight, Anna Morris, and Jessica Roberts will be up against the USA in the women's team pursuit first round.\n\nFancy a race, Speed?\n\nLove him, roll your eyes at him. Whatever you think of IShowSpeed, it would seem he's here to stay on our screens for the time being. Enough footballers seem happy enough having him around.\n\nNow Polish Olympic sprinting star Ewa Swoboda Swoboda has called him out after he claimed that 'nobody in the world' could beat him in a race.\n\nWouldn't put it past him to say yes...\n\nSwoboda saw her individual Olympic hopes ended at the semi-final stage of the women's 100m when her time of 11.08secs was only enough for fourth place.\n\nWatch: How Harrie Lavreysen set a world record in the men's cycling sprint\n\nThis is the fastest we've ever seen somebody ride a bike in human history. Let that sink in. Nobody has ever ridden a bike faster than this.\n\nEmma Finucane STORMS through women's keirin heat\n\nWow. What a ride.\n\nBy the end, she had a couple of bike lengths on the pack.\n\nOnly Lea Friedrich could get anywhere near her, closing down at the end.\n\nThird-placed Taky Marie-Divine Kouame was 0.631 seconds back! Rapid from Finucane.\n\nEmma Finucane up now\n\nWe'll bring you her result shortly. Part of Team GB's world record-breaking sprint trio on Monday. Can she add another gold in the keirin? Heats now.\n\nFrench runner reveals what he said to George Mills in on-track row\n\nHugo Hay has revealed what he told George Mills amid their furious confrontation after their men's 1500m heat.\n\nMills, the son of former England footballer Danny, squared up to Hay, who he felt caused a mass collision on the final straight of the race.\n\nRead more below.\n\nReplays showed Hay appearing to give Mills a slight push as they ran side-by-side, with the Team GB star then going down in a collision with three others unfortunate runners.\n\nAround the Games\n\nDay is dull for Charley Hull\n\nThere's not many holes left to turn her day around.\n\nCharley Hull is rock bottom of the standing as she's eight over par after 13 holes.\n\nAll going wrong for the Kettering native. She provides plenty of entertainment value and has done so well in her career but things just haven't worked out for her today.\n\nKaty Marchant drops into repechage round\n\nGutting for Katy Marchant. Round the final bend, she looked out of her women's keirin heat and like she might come fourth, forced into the outside lane.\n\nThen she turned on the afterburners and suddenly surged alongside the leading pack, leading to a dramatic photo-finish.\n\nNot enough, though. She comes third behind Ellesse Andrews and Mathilde Gros.\n\nShe'll get another chance in the repechage round, but if you miss out on that, you're out for good.\n\nTeam GB darling Emma Ficucane up later in heat five.\n\nMen's dinghy medal race delayed\n\nNot sure when it will be getting underway and no official announcement has been made, but the race is not underway and has been delayed as per the Olympics app.\n\nWe've got Michael Bennett in contention for whenever it gets underway.\n\nJack Carlin and Hamish Turnbull through in men's sprint cycling - while world record is set\n\nEasy enough for the British duo.\n\nThey come fifth and seventh respectively to stand themselves in great stead for the competition going forward.\n\nMeanwhile, Harrie Lavreysen stuns the crowd as he sets a world-record time of 9.088s. Fantastic. His average speed? A ridiculous 79.225 km/h.\n\nAustralia's Matthew Richardson must be feeling aggrieved - he'd set the a world record himself just moments before!\n\nSky Brown's message for fans after second bronze medal\n\nSky Brown had this message for fans after hoovering up her second bronze Olympic medal at the age of 16. Some going.\n\nThe skateboarding is crazy, right? An 11-year-old was competing yesterday. 11! I think at that age, the big rage in my primary school were finger-sized skateboards called Tech Decks. We weren't brave enough for the real thing.\n\nParis enjoys economy boom\n\nSmall businesses in Paris have benefited from a 26 per cent hike in sales, according to Visa.\n\nFrance has seen the biggest up-tick from American travellers (up 64 per cent), followed by German and Spanish tourists.\n\nIt's great when the Games can have a positive impact on the local community.\n\nElliot Giles: I stayed ready - look at me now!\n\nGreat story for Elliot Giles if you're unfamiliar.\n\nIt was a huge blow last Thursday when Jake Wightman - the 2022 world 1500m champion set to represent Team GB in the 800m - had to pull out of the Olympics.\n\nIn stepped Elliot Giles brilliantly today, and he's now in the semi-finals.\n\nHear from him below.\n\nReeve Walcott-Nolan makes women's 1500m semis\n\nSecond-time Olympian Reeve Walcott-Nolan has made it through to the women's 150mm semi-finals after finishing second in her repecharge heat with a time of 4:06:73.\n\nSome don't like the format, but she'll be glad to have had the second chance.\n\nWhat's coming up?\n\nPlenty to whet the appetite over the next couple of hours:\n\nAndrew Macdonald in the men's park skateboarding prelims - aged 51!\n\nEleanor Aldridge and Connor Bainbridge in the women's and men's kiteboarding\n\nReeve Walcott-Nolan in the women's 1500m repechage round (last chance)\n\nHamish Turnbull and Jack Carlin in the men's track cycling sprint qualifying - both having been part of our team sprint silver\n\nMichael Beckett in the men's dinghy medal race\n\nEmma Finucane and Katy marchant in the women's cycling track keirin first round\n\nTeam GB in the women's cycling track team pursuit (Elinor Barker, Josie Knight, Anna Morris, and Jessica Roberts)\n\nJohn Gimson and Anna Burnet in the mixed multihull medal race\n\nOlympics titan admits he was 'outsmarted' by rival\n\nAn outspoken Olympics favourite admitting they were 'outsmarted' by their rival and that their 'big mouth' let them down?

Jack Laugher might well be an Olympian diver, but in that brief frame, he looks absolutely terrified to be one. I won't budge on this.\n\nToby Roberts and Hamish McArthur into the boulder and lead final\n\nNice work.\n\nToby Roberts came second in the men's boulder semi-final, with Hamish McArthur eighth. That's enough for a place in Friday's final.\n\nThey've got the lead semi-final later, and their scores in that will be added to those from this morning, but top eight is all you need overall so it's a good start for the two.\n\nMcArthur said: 'I can’t complain at all, I had a great time out there and I loved every minute.\n\n'I felt like I performed really well, I felt unbelievably close to getting more tops.\n\n“The round was really hard.

French lad took me down.\n\n'Probably not allowed what to say (what I said to him after). I haven't spoken to anyone yet but they'll put an appeal in I hope.\n\n'It was perfect a qualifier for mne. I was just biding my time to hit the home straight, and then bang, hit the deck.\n\n'I don't mind it when it's messy, I even managed to hurdle a fall.

Well, 14 hours, but it's not much after last night's 1500m, where he lost his Olympic title. He's the world champion for the 5000m.\n\nBritain's Sam Atkin hoping to claim a scalp in this second men's 5000m heat.\n\nDisaster strikes for George Mills?\n\nAnd oh, it's a calamity in the men's 5000m as four runners collide and stumble over each other in the final straight! Mo Ahmed had fallen ahead of the final lap.\n\nThe judges will shortly decide each athlete's fate - just because you've fallen doesn't necessarily mean you're out if you weren't responsible.\n\nNarve Gilje Nordas confirmed as winner. A nervous wait.\n\nBut with Patrick Dever having crossed the line 13th and Mills 18th, it doesn't look overly promising.\n\nCharley Hull steadies waters\n\nThree pars in a row for Charley Hull and that's stopped the rot after a double bogey to start.\n\nShe's joint-25th as we speak, with fellow Brit Georgia Hall only teeing off at 11.17am.\n\nLuxury hotel staff didn't recognise Serena Williams amid spat\n\nOne of the most laughable episodes of the Games for me - Serena Williams kicking off about not being admitted to a rooftop restaurant despite it being fully booked, her subsequently shaming them on social media, and then staff admitting they didn't even recognise her.\n\nNot that it would matter if they did, right? If it's booked out, it's booked out. Go somewhere else. McDonald's is never far away.\n\nThe 23-time Grand Slam winner took to X to publicly complain about the treatment she received at The Peninsula Hotel on Monday, sharing her annoyance at the way in which her visit went down.\n\nHuge reception for Frenchman Jimmy Gressier\n\nThe French have been super passionate this year - surprise, surprise - and Jacob Gressier is the latest to feel the warm embrace of the crowd at the Stade de France. Big cheers for him on the start line.\n\nGeorge Mills and Patrick Dever up now in the men's 5000m\n\nGeorge Mills (pictured) and Patrick Dever are up in the first heat for the men's 5000m.\n\nThe world record time for this is 12:35.36, so you'll probably have to wait at least that long to know the result, but bear with us...\n\nThey've got to finish in the top eight to qualify.\n\nTeam GB athlete back to the grind on FRIDAY\n\nBe careful who you badmouth when you're stuck in traffic on the way to work on Friday. You might just be behind an Olympian.\n\nAnd if you notice someone leaping around the office, well, they probably are an Olympian.\n\nJacob Fincham-Dukes came fifth in the long jump last night at the Stade de France but there is little time to soak up the emotions after that result.\n\nHe's back to the grind on Friday. Now imagine what he could do if he didn't have to work full-time.\n\nRead more below.\n\nJacob Fincham-Dukes put in an impressive performance during the weekend's qualifiers to book his place in the final at Stade de France on Tuesday evening.\n\nOne to watch later this morning: Ben Pattison\n\nBen Pattison didn't think he'd get his shot at the Olympics when he was told surgeons would have to brun off part of his heart in 2020.\n\nAgainst all the odds, here he is, via a bronze medal in the 800m in Budapest's World Championships last year.\n\nOnly Seb Coe has covered the distance faster.\n\nYou can see him in action from 10.55am in the first round of the men's 100m. What a story.\n\nGreat start for Hamish McArthur\n\nI promise he isn't as terrified of climbing as he looks here.\n\nTwenty-two-year-old Yorkshire man Hamish McArthur has brought a 14-strong contingent of fans out to his event today and is currently sat third as he grapples for a place in the final. He only found out he was coming in June - how far can we go?\n\nWe also have Toby Roberts in this event and he places seventh so far, with the top eight making the final.\n\nJosh Kerr: There IS beef between me and Jakob Ingebrigtsen\n\nNobody paid attention to Cole Hocker last night. Not until he doused the supposed 1500m duopoly with cold water.\n\nJosh Kerr was meant to be the golden boy, and in the end, silver is nothing to be ashamed of. He ran a superb race and is now a two-time Olympic medalist. But it's his rivalry with Norwegian foe Jakob Ingebrigtsen that many thought would light up the final.\n\nNow, on the comfort of the Eurosport sofa, Kerr has opened up on their rivalry - and revealed there is 'real beef' and what makes him 'sting'.\n\nOLIVER HOLT AT THE STADE DE FRANCE: They brought the two rivals out on to the track last. No one could be in any doubt that this men's 1500 metres final was being built around their feud.\n\nAnd the first gold medal of the day goes to...\n\nSign me up for the speedwalking. At the pace I overtake the dawdlers on the streets of London, I'd have a medal in the bag.\n\nSpain claim the first gold of the day, and I would say they did it at a canter, but that would be too fast.\n\nMaria Perez and Alvaro Martin are seen here celebrating their marathon race walk mixed relay triumph. You'll never sing that.\n\nWatch: Hurdles no match for Cindy Sember\n\nHere is Cindy Sember's run from before, by the way. Any budding hurdle-clearers, take note.\n\nAfter a slow start, the Michigan-born athlete found her groove.\n\nHaving come fourth in the 100m hurdles in Rio in 2016, she's back with a vengeance.\n\nGood start in the diving\n\nPlenty to be optimistic about in the men's 3m springboard diving.\n\nAfter two attempts, Jack Laugher places fifth and Jordan Houlden (pictured) is seventh. Three contestants have even dived three times, so of course they'll have a points advantage. The top 12 qualify for the final so it's plain sailing so far.\n\nAndrea Spendolini-Sirieix shares deep message on Instagram\n\nAndrea Spendolini-Sirieix was left in tears after finishing sixth in the 10-metre platform and bravely admitted that three years ago she 'did not want to be alive'.\n\nShe is already a hero to so many, as her father, celebrity chef Fred Sirieix, pointed out - and a bronze medalist alongside Lois Toulson.\n\nNow she has shared an emotional message won Instagram. It's a long way, and very heartfelt.\n\nRead more below.\n\nThe 19-year-old diving star had bravely made the confession earlier this week after she finished sixth in the individual 10m diving event.\n\nWhat have we got on this morning?\n\nThere's an eclectic mix up for us this morning, sweeping across turf, pool, and track. The line-up through to 11am looks something like this.\n\nWomen's golf - Charley Hull and Georgia Hall\n\nMen's 3m diving springboard semi-final - Jack Laugher and Jordan Houlden\n\nMen's boulder and lead semi-final - Hamish McArthur and Toby Roberts\n\nMen's 5000m round one - Sam Atkin, Patrick Dever, and George Mills\n\nMen's 800m round one - Max Burgin, Elliot Giles, and Ben Pattison\n\nOlympics Breakfast Briefing with SIR STEVE REDGRAVE\n\nFeeling lost in the morass of events? Let Sir Steve Redgrave be your guiding light.\n\nIn the latest instalment of his Olympics Breakfast Briefing, which has become its own institution over the last fortnight, Redgrave reflects on another day of highs and lows for Team GB and previews the action waiting for us today.\n\nTeam GB are continuing to dazzle at the 2024 Olympics with Josh Kerr surpassing his rival Jakob Ingebrigsten to clinch silver in the men's 1500m.\n\nEarly smiles for Team GB - Cindy Sember feels 'ready for a medal'\n\nCindy Sember has come second in her women's 100m hurdles heat with a time of 12.72s. A positive start to the day as she's into the semis. .\n\n'It felt pretty good. I have a lot more in the tank but it was good to get the nerves and jitters out. I'm blessed to be here and I'm happy and healthy,' she told BBC Sport.\n\n'I'm ready for a medal. I'm capable. With God's grace I'll be alright.'\n\nGood morning\n\nHello and welcome to Mail Sport's live blog of day 12 of the Olympics.\n\nWe've got a few medal hopes up today - culminating with Matthew Hudson-Smith in tonight's men's 400m final - and we'll be bringing you all the action and reaction right here on Mail Sport."
