        "text": "1895-1990\n\nTalbert \"Ted\" Abrams was born in Tekonsha, Michigan on August 17, 1895. His lifelong interests in aviation centered on experimental aircraft, commercial airline services and aerial photography.\n\nAbrams served in the Aviation Section, United States Marine Corps, and the United States Air Corps from 1917-1919 during and after World War I. He married and started the ABC Airline (Always Be Carful) in 1922. He left the airline industry and founded Abrams Aerial Survey Corporation in 1923. He made his first aerial survey for the Michigan State Highway Department in September of 1925 using aerial cameras that he himself developed.\n\nSince its start in 1923, the company annually completes precision aerial surveys and remote sensing for thousands of highways, transmission and pipe lines miles for states, counties, cities, and industry. Abrams himself has lived, worked, and traveled in 96 countries.\n\nAbrams has received many honors, one of which was his initiation into the OX-5 Aviation Hall of Fame. He is especially proud of the fact he has Federation Aeronautique International Pilot License No. 282, signed by Orville Wright, and the United States Transport Pilot License No. 599. Abrams also received three honorary degrees for his contributions to aviation and to society.\n\nAbrams was enshrined on December 17, 1987 for his long and illustrious career in developing the state-of-the-art aerial photography adopted and used around the world today. He is very proud and pleased to have had the wonderful lifelong experience of being able to make the contributions he made for a great country like the United States.\n\n1935-\n\nColonel John Amundson was born on January 31, 1935, in Decorah, Iowa. After graduating from high school, he studied at the University of Minnesota for a year before entering the U.S. Air Force Aviation Cadet program. In May 1956, he completed U.S. Air Force flight training in May 1956 and was commissioned a second lieutenant. He completed advanced flight training in the B-47 nuclear bomber. He served as B-47 Aircrew Commander with the 310th Bombardment Wing, Schilling Air Force Base, Salina, Kansas, until 1965, with tours of duty in Alaska, Guam, England, Spain, and North Africa. During his B-47 tour, he earned a bachelor s degree. In 1957, he married his wife, Margaret. Their five children and their many grandchildren and great-grandchildren have been of the utmost importance to him.\n\nIn early 1965, then Captain Amundson was assigned as a pilot of the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft. In 1967, he was named Chief, U-2 Branch, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. He had U-2 tours of duty in Alaska, the Continental U.S., and Vietnam. One of the U-2 aircraft he flew now hangs in the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1971, Amundson earned a master s degree in computing science from Texas A&M. He was then assigned to Strategic Air Command Headquarters at Offut Air Force Base, Omaha, Nebraska. While at Offut, he was assigned as a C-131 pilot, in addition to his managerial duties with data systems. He was assigned temporary duty in Thailand to assist with U-2 operations in Southeast Asia, until his promotion to Lieutenant Colonel required him to stop flying.\n\nIn 1977, Amundson graduated from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, where he was promoted to Colonel. He retired from the Air Force in 1980, after 25 years of service, having last served as Director of Data Systems at Defense Logistics Services at the Federal Center in Battle Creek. The Air Force awarded him the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the Air Force Commendation Medal with one oak leaf cluster, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Bronze Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Legion of Merit.\n\nAs a civilian, John Amundson used the GI Bill to obtain additional flight ratings, and then served as Director of Flight Operations for three different companies, including the Stryker Corporation. He was chief pilot for the Air Zoo and flew Air Zoo fighters at air shows, including the Grumman F8F Bearcat in the historic Cat Flight . In addition, he was the FAA Designated Pilot Examiner for the Air Zoo's Ford Tri-motor, and logged more than 500 hours in that aircraft. Colonel Amundson has flown more than 13,000 hours, including 1,200 hours as an instructor in 85 types of aircraft. In 2010, the Federal Aviation Administration honored him with the Wright Brothers Master Pilot Award for his more than fifty years of safe flying. Colonel Amundson is a life member of the Air Force Association, the Experimental Aircraft Association, the Flying Octogenarians, and is a long-time member of ye Anciente and Secret Order of Quiet Birdmen, Kalamazoo Hangar.\n\nColonel John D. Amundson was enshrined in the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on April 21, 2018, for his significant contributions to both military and civilian aviation.\n\n1917-2004\n\nCol. Norman C. Appold was born in Detroit, Michigan on April 3, 1917 and graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in chemical engineering. After completing his studies, he voluntarily joined the U.S. Army Air Corps immediately before Pearl Harbor.\n\nHe graduated from the Aviation Cadet Training Program in 1942, commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant. After completing pilot training, he served as a B-24 pilot in the 376th Bomb Group Association, completing 63 missions.\n\nAppold was involved in Operation Tidal Wave, code name of the historic low-level attack of oil refineries at Ploesti, Romania on August 1, 1943. This was the first large-scale, low-level strike by heavy bombers against a well-defined target of World War II up to that time. B-24's of the 8th and 9th Air Forces undertook the 2,400 mile flight from Benghazi, Libya. Due to heavy defenses and the low altitude of the raid, casualties were high, with 53 of 178 B-24s lost, and 440 crew members killed and 220 captured or missing.\n\nAppold, piloting G.I. Ginnie, leading four other aircraft through intense ground fire, bombed the Concordia Vega refinery and successfully returned to Libya. Appold received the Distinguished Service Cross for his heroism that day.\n\nAfter retiring from the Air Force in 1963, Appold joined the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company where he was instrumental in the development of the C-5 and C-141 aircraft. He retired from Lockheed as a Vice President in 1984. In addition to the Distinguished Service Cross, Appold was awarded the Silver Star, Legion of Merit with one Oak Leaf Cluster, Distinguished Flying Cross with three Oak Leaf Clusters, Air Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, an Air Force Commendation Medal, as well as numerous service awards. Appold was enshrined in the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on April 19, 2008.\n\n1920-2004\n\nLt. Col. Kelvin Bailey was born on December 29, 1920 in Canada. His family soon moved to Dearborn, Michigan, where Bailey would graduate from Dearborn High School in 1941. During High School, Bailey made his first solo flight in 1939.\n\nImmediately following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Kelvin Bailey joined the United States Marine Corps, hoping to be a Marine aviator. He completed boot camp and was assigned to the Marine Corp Recruit Depot Property Office. He applied for flight training and was accepted into the Navy’s Flight Training Program. Bailey received his Naval Aviator Wings and was commissioned a Marine Corps 2nd Lt. in October 1943. He was assigned to the south Pacific flying the SBD Dauntless. During World War II, Bailey flew 116 combat missions. He was awarded three Asiatic/Pacific Battle Stars, the Presidential Unit Citation, Distinguished Flying Cross, and several Air Medals.\n\nAfter World War II, Bailey flew for the Marine Corps Reserve and as a pilot for Air California Airlines. During the Korean War, he was ordered to active duty and deployed to Korea, earning two Battle Stars on his Korean Service Ribbon. After the Korean War, Bailey was selected as the staff pilot for Medal of Honor recipient Major General Christian Schilt. He flew as an Agency Pilot at Washington National Airport, where he transported presidential candidates.\n\nWhile in Washington DC, Bailey was asked if he would consider moving to California to fly as Walt Disney’s pilot. Walt Disney stated that he wanted “only the best” pilot. Bailey spent 13 years as Chief Pilot for Walt Disney Productions. After flying over 32,000 accident-free hours in 33 different types of aircraft, Bailey’s flying career ended suddenly after a car accident. Kelvin Bailey passed away at the age of 84 in his Burbank, California home, on April 19, 2004.\n\nFor his long and distinguished flying service to his nation, and for his enduring legacy as one of our state’s most distinguished civilian pilots, Lt. Col. Kelvin W.A. Bailey is inducted into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on October 15, 2020.\n\n1925-1987\n\nAchiever, visionary, showman, historian and pilot extraordinaire, Bill Barber was a man for all aviation seasons and a model of unfailing professionalism and talent.\n\nDestined to spend a lifetime in the cockpit, Barber's illustrious career got off to an early start in 1936 with his first solo flight in his native Minnesota at age 11. Later, he became a commercial airline pilot and logged more than 30,000 hours of pilot-in-command time.\n\nHaving deep respect and affection for the bygone barnstormer era, Barber soon set his sights on becoming a top-tier stunt pilot. Over an airshow career that spanned 25 years, he developed a soaring repertoire of acts that thrilled audiences coast to coast. He entertained hundreds of thousands with dead-stick sequences, a rope ladder pickup, car-top landings, team aerobatics, skywriting, wingwalking and comedy crowd-pleasers.\n\nBarber was an inveterate collector of showplanes. His diverse fleet included a Clipped Wing Cub, Curtiss Flacon, Bucker Jungman, Pitts Special S-IS and a powerful Black Wasp Boeing Stearman known as the \"Black Baron.\" Amazingly, Barber one performed 14 different aerobatic airshow acts during a two-day Chicago show, shifting between aircraft of varying flight characteristics with ease and earning a well-deserved reputation as \"Aerobatic Flying's Renaissance Man.\"\n\nHis renowned spread to include the international arena. In 1962, he captained the first United States Aerobatic Competition Team in Budapest. Barber shaped the future of airshow entertainment and competition by serving as the first United States representative to the International Aerobatics Rules meeting in Paris. Invited by ranking Washington, D.C. officials, he also played a pivotal role in the formation of the Aerobatics Division of NAA.\n\nBarber was awarded the Wilkenson Sword of Excellence and has been inducted into the Airshow Hall of Fame and the Aerobatics Hall of Fame. In his honor, the Bill Barber Award for Showmanship is presented to an outstanding airshow personality each year at EAA's AirVenture Show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin-the world's premier aviation event.\n\nAn authentic, modern-day hero, Bill Barber's legacy endures as one of the most colorful chapters in the long and glorious history of aviation. He was enshrined in the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on October 11, 2003.\n\n1893-1925\n\nLt. Cyrus K. Bettis was born January 2, 1893, in Carsonville, Michigan.\n\nBitten by the flying bug early on, he received his pilot license in 1916 from the O. E. Williams Flight School, attending alongside fellow Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame enshrinees Elwood J. Junkin and Clayton J. Brukner, who would eventually co-found the WACO Aircraft Company.\n\nBettis left his longtime position as manager with the Michigan State Telephone Co. on February 3rd, 1918 intent on joining the U.S. Army as a flying cadet. He began military flight training at the University of Illinois school of Military Aeronautics, and completed it at Call Field, Wichita Falls, TX in September, 1918. Assigned to patrol the Mexican border, he proved to be an exceptional pilot and was reassigned to serve as a flight instructor in the Philippines. In addition to his training duties, it was here that he became one of the first pilots to fly an aircraft at night. Rising to the rank of first lieutenant, he was transferred to Selfridge Field, Mount Clemens, MI in 1923 to join the army s elite 1st Pursuit Group, where he was eventually selected to represent the U.S. Army in the National and International Air Races. Hugely popular at the time, air races served as a test bed for new aircraft designs and innovations, and the racing circuit drew notable aviators such as James Jimmy Doolittle, Amelia Earhart, and Glenn Curtiss. Pilots and manufacturers from around the world competed to push the limits of aircraft speed and durability, and news of the latest victories made international news on a regular basis. Piloting a Curtiss R3C single-engine biplane, Bettis won the John L. Mitchell Trophy Race in Ohio on Oct. 4, 1924, setting a course record of 175.41 mph that would stand for the next six years. Eager to follow up this win, he entered the Pulitzer Trophy Race the following year. Considered the marquee event of the National Air Races, the Pulitzer Trophy race was founded by publishing magnates Ralph, Joseph Jr., and Herbert Pulitzer to encourage the development of faster and more reliable military aircraft. Consisting of 4 laps around a circuitous 32-mile course, pilots had to stay below 400 feet while completing tight turns just outside of tall pylons marking the edges of the course. There was little margin for error, and crashes and mishaps were commonplace as both pilots and machines were pushed to the limits of endurance and engineering. Competing against the world s best military pilots at the time, Bettis, a relative newcomer, piloted his Curtiss R3C through the course at a blistering 249.34 mph, setting a new World Record and earning him the Pulitzer Trophy. This new record also earned him the coveted Mackay Trophy, which was established by Clarence H. Mackay, an industrialist and aviation enthusiast, and presented annually by the National Aeronautic Association to recognize the most meritorious flight of the year .\n\nOn August 23, 1925, Bettis was piloting the lead plane in a flight of First Pursuit Air Squadron aircraft returning to Selfridge Field from Philadelphia. Flying though heavy fog, the wing of his plane struck a tree in the Jacks Mountain region of Pennsylvania. Knocked unconscious in the resulting crash, he awoke to find he had numerous injuries, including a broken leg and jaw. Concerned that rescuers would be unable to locate him in the dense woods, he crawled through the night, eventually reaching a road where he was discovered by two young boys. Sadly, he died a week later at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C., after contracting meningitis. An airport in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, was named Bettis Field in his honor. When Westinghouse bought the land in 1949, they also paid tribute to him by naming their new facility the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory.\n\nFor his fearless and adventurous pursuit of advancement and excellence in aviation, Cyrus Bettis extols the virtues of the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame.\n\n1922-2019\n\nMaj. Gen. Richard L. Bodycombe was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1922 and raised in Grosse Pointe, Michigan. He earned a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science from the University of Michigan in 1948 and 1952, respectively.\n\nIn May 1944, he was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant after completing flying training at Turner Field, Georgia. After he completed training in B-24 Liberators, he reported to the 782n\n\nBodycombe earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal and the Purple Heart as a Liberator pilot during World War II. After hostilities ceased in Europe, he separated from the Army Air Corps and returned to the U.S. However, he was recalled to active duty in 1949 and assigned to the 60th Troop Carrier Group at Wiesbaden Air Base in Germany to participate in the Berlin Airlift where he flew C-47s and C-54s. When Operation Vittles concluded, he was assigned to the 7167th Special Air Missions Squadron at Wiesbaden for the remainder of his three-year tour of duty.\n\nBodycombe served for one year as aide to Maj. Gen. Harry A. Johnson, commander, 10th Air Force at Selfridge Air Force Base in Michigan. His next assignment was the 63rd Troop Carrier Wing, which was being organized at Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma. He served as a C-124 aircraft commander in the 52nd Troop Carrier Squadron and later, when the 63rd Troop Carrier Wing transferred to Donaldson Air Force Base in South Carolina, he became assistant operations officer for the 63rd Troop Carrier Group.\n\nIn 1955, he was selected as a founding faculty member of the U.S. Air Force Academy. Following that key assignment, Bodycombe began a career in the U.S. Air Force Reserves that resulted in his selection as a major general, and eventually in his appointment as commander of all U.S. Air Force Reserve federal forces. He retired from the Reserves in 1982 and pursued a civilian flying career that ultimately resulted in his selection as Ford Motor Co.'s chief pilot.\n\nIn 1983, Bodycombe joined a small group of dedicated Detroit-area residents who formed the Yankee Air Museum. One of their primary goals was to obtain a flyable B-24 bomber that was built by the Ford Motor Co. in its World War II factory at Willow Run Airport in Ypsilanti, Michigan. In the following years, the Yankee Air Museum prospered and began collecting flyable vintage military aircraft including a B-17, B-25 and C-47. Bodycombe became director of flight operations as the organization began to fly its aircraft in air shows throughout the Eastern and Southeastern regions of the country.\n\nBodycombe's flying hours total more than 21,500 with qualification in more than 50 types of military and civilian aircraft. He currently resides in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He and his wife, Karin, have three children: Brian, Peter and Christopher. General Bodycombe passed away on January 23, 2019.\n\n1881-1956\n\nWilliam E. Boeing Sr. was born in Detroit, Michigan on October 1, 1881. His interest in aviation was sparked by an air meet he attended in 1910. Boeing learned to fly in 1915, and subsequently purchased a Martin seaplane. It was flown to Seattle in October of that year and finding it to be quite unsatisfactory; Boeing set out to build a better one.\n\nBoeing was joined by Conrad Westervelt, an engineering officer in the Navy, who had the task of collecting and analyzing every bit of technical information available. On July 15, 1916, Boeing piloted the first two flights of the new B & W seaplane. Pacific Aero Products Company was established in 1916 which became Boeing Airplane Company a year later.\n\nThe company did well during World War I building trainer-type seaplanes for the Navy, but in the aeronautical drop that followed the war the company even manufactured household furniture and boats to stay alive.\n\nBoeing never doubted that he was on the right track. In 1921, the company's first break came when it received a large contract for pursuit planes from the Army. In 1927 they received the Chicago-San Francisco airmail route. Boeing's newly formed Boeing Air Transport service flourished, and to it was added other airlines under the banner of the Boeing system, later United Air Lines.\n\nKnowing that progress could be best made by pooling industry resources and know-how, Boeing teamed up with Frederick Rentschler of Pratt and Whitney to form the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation. Boeing served as company chairman until 1934.\n\nUnited Aircraft and Transport Corporation grew to become a leader in the manufacture of multi-engine aircraft, commercial jet transports, and space vehicles. In 1934, the year of his retirement, Boeing received the Daniel Guggenheim Medal and was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame.\n\nBoeing was enshrined on October 26, 1991 for his contributions to the production of both military and commercial aircraft as a leader in America's aeronautical progress in the early years of flight.\n\n1933-\n\nWilliam Francis Bos was born in Muskegon, Michigan on May 22, 1933. Bill received a bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in Aerospace Engineering. After graduation in 1956, he went to work for Lear Inc., Aircraft Engineering Division, Santa Monica, California designing various systems for the Learstar, including a complete electrical flap actuating system.\n\nHe went on to Chrysler Corp., Missile Division in late 1956 as an analytical engineer where he established design criteria for ballistic missiles, analyzed stability of the suspension system for the Redstone missile transporter, and was responsible for the aerodynamics and aeroballistics analysis in the preliminary missile design department. While at Chrysler, he was assigned to the Army Ballistic Missile Agency in Huntsville, Alabama as part of Werner von Braun's rocket team, conducting design analysis of the aerodynamic heating of reentry bodies, including the first ablative nose cones to survive reentry.\n\nIn 1960 he joined Bendix Systems Division as a senior Engineer responsible for aeroballistics studies and systems analysis for several missile systems.\n\nIn 1962 he was appointed to the NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C. as the Technical Assistant to the Director of Launch Vehicle and Propulsion Programs, responsible for advancing the state of the art in launch vehicle program design for cost effectiveness. Bill served as Executive Secretary of NASA Launch Vehicle and Propulsion Advisory Committee from 1962 to 1964. In 1965, he became Launch Vehicle Program Manager at NASA Headquarters, Office of Manned Space Flight. Bill has also published four papers on launch vehicles. In 1968, he returned to Bendix Systems Division as a Senior Staff Engineer.\n\nReturning to Muskegon in 1970, he established Bos Engineering, P.C., a consulting firm. His many clients included the British Aircraft Corporation, for whom he designed the flight path optimization program for the Concord supersonic aircraft.\n\nWilliam F. Bos was enshrined on October 19, 1996 into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame for his outstanding contributions to the United States aerospace program, to supersonic flight and for his dedication and love of space flight and aviation.\n\n1935-2012\n\nJohn F.X. Browne is a world renowned pilot and traveler. His exploits have literally taken him to all the continents and all four corners of the earth.\n\nBrowne started his flying instruction at Detroit City Airport in 1962. He earned his instrument rating in 1965 and his air transport rating in 1970. In 1971 he received Category II ILS approach authorization, the first one issued in the Central Great Lakes Region for light aircraft.\n\nHe is holder of 23 World Records on International Flights in light aircraft (Piper Aztec) including flights around-the-world, over the north pole, and transpacific.\n\nDuring these flights he has crossed the Atlantic six times, the Pacific three times (north, central, and south), as well as crossings of the Indian and Arctic Oceans with landings and over-flights on all continents except Antarctica.\n\nBrowne was enshrined on December 17, 1987 for outstanding contributions in developing the knowledge required for access by general aviation in international travel. His accomplishments were many and varied. His continued travel, notably to Antarctica in 1987, the only continent he has not landed on, will be yet another accomplishment. Browne, with his diligence and foresight, has indeed assisted all of those in aviation by proving that flying is safe, enjoyable, and possible on the international level. To this end, this award is most solemnly and respectfully dedicated.\n\n1896-1977\n\nClayton J. Brukner was raised in Battle Creek, Michigan, and it was here where he met Elwood J. \"Sam\" Junkin, a lifelong associate with whom Clayton shared a love of aviation. After graduating from high school in 1915, the pair became involved with the O.E. Williams Aeroplane Co. in Fenton, Michigan, where Brukner learned the mechanical aspects of airplanes.\n\nIn 1917, Brukner and Junkin headed to New York to work at the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Corp., followed by work at the Aeromarine Plane and Motor Co. in New Jersey. It was here that they met Harold C. Deuther, George E. \"Buck\" Weaver and Charlie Meyers. Between the fall of 1919 and the spring of 1920, the DBJ Aeroplane Co. was formed by Deuther, Bruckner and Junkin in Lorain, Ohio.\n\nIn 1920, Deuther returned to his home in New York and Weaver again joined the group. They established a formal company called the Weaver Aircraft Co. The first airplane built by the group was a high-wing parasol called the \"Cootie.\" The aircraft was damaged on its first test flight and rebuilt as a biplane. In 1921 the Weaver Aircraft Co., known by the acronym WACO, built its first practical airplane, the Waco Model 4.\n\nIn 1922, Weaver left the Weaver Aircraft Co. as Brukner and Junkin moved operations to Medina, Ohio. In 1923 the Weaver Aircraft Co. closed its doors, moved to Troy, Ohio, and reorganized as the Advanced Aircraft Co., with Brukner as president and plant manager.\n\nIn 1927 the Model 10 was introduced and became the leading aircraft registered in the United States with more than 1,200 aircraft sold. In 1929 the company again reorganized and became the Waco Aircraft Co.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1938, with Brukner at the helm, the Waco Aircraft Co. outsold all other competitors two-to-one. Wacos, consisting of both open and closed cockpit biplanes, were found in 36 countries, making it the most successful aircraft company in the United States.\n\nFollowing World War II, the Waco Aircraft Co. made the decision to stop producing aircraft. Brukner sold the company to Allied Industries in 1963 and it closed its doors for good in 1965.\n\nBrukner passed away on December 26, 1977. He was enshrined into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on May 21, 2011.\n\n1922-2006\n\nProfessor Harm Buning was born in The Hague, Netherlands, on July 31, 1922. He grew up in Holland and came to the United States in 1945, sponsored by his uncle, renowned physicist and teacher, George Uhlenbeck. Arriving in Ann Arbor in December of 1945, Harm received his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in aerospace engineering from the University of Michigan (U-M) in 1949 and 1951. After a three-year teaching position at Oregon State, he returned to his alma mater as an assistant professor, rose to professor in 1963.\n\nHarm’s early interest was in aerodynamics and aircraft performance, but as the Space Race began, he realized the importance of astrodynamics and became an expert in mission analysis and spacecraft design. It is estimated that Professor Buning taught nearly all the U-M Aerospace Engineering’s 2,600 graduates during his 40 years of teaching. Some of his students include, Gemini IV astronauts Jim McDivitt and Ed White, Apollo 15 astronauts Dave Scott, Jim Irwin, and Al Worden, and Skylab 2 astronaut Jack Lousma.\n\nEd White invited Harm to the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas to teach orbital mechanics to the first two groups of astronauts. Professor Buning would make many trips to Houston to teach astronauts orbital rendezvous and docking: skills that would prove crucial for success of the manned lunar landings and space station programs. Professor Buning’s students at Houston included those he taught at the U-M, as well as Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and many others.\n\nHarm Buning was awarded the Thurnau Award for teaching excellence in 1988. Professor Buning retired from U-M in 1992. Harm Buning passed away on May 12, 2006. He has a graduate teaching award and scholarship fund named in his honor.\n\nFor his dedication and contributions to education, aerospace, and spaceflight, and his legacy as a professor and mentor to many of our nation’s spaceflight pioneers, Harm Buning was inducted into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on October 15, 2020.\n\n1932-\n\nPete Burgher was born July 18, 1932, in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. Later becoming a pilot, world traveler, author, and aviation record holder, Pete's love of aviation started at age six when he rode shotgun for his uncle delivering new Luscombe aircraft to customers in the eastern states. He received his private pilot's license in 1960, and holds additional ratings of commercial pilot with instruments and multi-engine land and sea. He has a total of 7,000 accident-free hours.\n\nPete's professional career started at Santa Barbara College in 1950, where he majored in political science. He went on to earn a Master's Degree from Columbia University in 1956, and from there began work at the international accounting firm of Arthur Young and Company, where he was made partner in charge of Michigan offices in 1972. He retired from Young and Company in 1979.\n\nIn 1980, Pete purchased Marelco Power Systems in Howell, Michigan. During the ensuing years, Pete's interest in aviation continued to develop, eventually leading him to become the Acting Chairman of the Rhode Island Governors Air Transportation Development Committee, chairman of the Michigan Aeronautics Commission from 1975-76, and the AOPA's regional representative from 1985-1994. Pete also founded the Flight Freedom Foundation Inc., to preserve and protect the general aviation system in 1994.\n\nPete has set 56 world class and U.S. National records flying his MX-1 Ultralite from Detroit to St. Petersburg, Florida during the week of July 25-31, 1982. He also set a world record flying his twin Comanche from Fort Myers to New Orleans in October, 1991.\n\nPeter H. \"Pete\" Burgher was enshrined on October 14, 1995 for his lifelong dedication to general aviation, the community, and education.\n\n1932-\n\nLt. Gen. Richard A. Burpee was born October 3, 1932 in Delton, Michigan. After graduating from high school in 1951, Burpee went on to earn an undergraduate degree in 1959 and a Master's degree in Public Administration in 1965. His professional military schools include: Squadron Officer School, Air Command and Staff College, National War College, and Advanced Management.\n\nEntering the Air Force in December, 1953, Burpee received his wings and Second Lieutenant commission at Bryan Air Force Base, Texas in March, 1955. He served as an instructor pilot at Bryan AFB and Reese AFB until June, 1962. He then was selected as an exchange officer with Royal Canadian Air Force for two years. In January, 1967, he began F-4 qualification training and was assigned to Cam Ranh Bay Air Base, Vietnam where from August, 1967 until September, 1968 he flew 336 F-4 combat missions.\n\nUpon returning to the United States he was assigned to HQ, U.S. Air Force. In 1971, he served as FB-111 Aircraft Commander at Pease AFB and Commander of the 509th Bombardment Wing until April, 1975, when he was appointed Director, Training for Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, SAC HQ.

Bush is inducted into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on October 9, 2021.\n\n1916-2004\n\nGilbert A. Cargill was born in Oberlin, Ohio on June 4, 1916. He had at all times encouraged minority youth to enter aviation as a career while striving to set an example by maintaining the highest level of professionalism and safety.\n\nHe graduated from Oberlin College in 1937 with a major in mathematics and a minor in physics and soon began teaching in Cleveland. In 1941 his childhood dream of obtaining his pilot's license was finally allowed to become a reality through the government sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program. In August, 1941 Mr. Cargill obtained his long awaited pilots license and continued on to receive his commercial license with an instructor rating in October 1942. In January 1943 he moved up to military flight instructor, flying Stearman PT-17s and AT-6s. In 1967, he moved to Troy, Michigan to become a flight instructor, and in October of that year he began teaching mathematics at Aero Mechanics High School. For many years he taught ground school to students after school on his own time.\n\nIn October 1972 the FAA appointed Cargill to be the first black designated pilot examiner in Michigan. He was appointed a safety counselor in 1975 and was subsequently honored in 1981 by the Great Lakes Regional FAA for outstanding support of the Safety Counseling Program. In September 1975 he obtained his coveted ATP certificate.\n\nHe was appointed to the Michigan Aeronautics Commission in 1985 by the Gov. James Blanchard, serving as chairman in 1988, and was reappointed for a second term. He has also been an active member of the Negro Airmen International (NAI) for many years, including serving two years as national president.\n\nIn June 1987 Cargill and a friend, John McFarlin, made a historic flight from Detroit to London, England in a Cessna 210 in a total flight time of 25 hours.\n\nCargill was enshrined on October 13, 1989 for his unending and tireless commitment to the advancement of aviation through education of the next generation. He died July 16, 2004 in Shaker Heights, Ohio.\n\nEugene “Gene” Carolan was born on March 12, 1947, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, but moved to Detroit, Michigan. He graduated from Detroit Henry Ford High School in 1965. In 1967, he was drafted into the United States Army. After graduation from Basic Training, Gene attended Army Officer Candidate School (OCS). Upon graduating from OCS, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. Gene volunteered and completed training as an Army Helicopter Pilot. After earning his Army Aviator Wings, Gene was sent directly to Vietnam where he served as an Army Helicopter Pilot and as an Infantry Officer in combat. Serving as a Cobra Gunship Pilot, Assault Helicopter Pilot, and leader of soldiers and airmen in Vietnam, Gene was awarded the Silver Star, Distinguished Flying Cross, several Air Medals, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart.\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Gene attended Eastern Michigan University and earned a degree in accounting in 1972. Gene joined the Michigan Army National Guard in 1977 and served for over two decades as an Officer and Helicopter Pilot. He served as a Helicopter Platoon Leader, Air Cavalry Troop Commander, and Assault Helicopter Battalion Commander. Gene was directly responsible for the successful training and mentoring of an entire generation of Michigan Army National Guard Helicopter Pilots, many of whom subsequently deployed on tours of duty to our nation’s wars in the Middle East.\n\nGene retired from the Michigan Army National Guard in 1997 as a Colonel and was placed on the Retired List of the United States Army when he turned 60 years of age in 2007. In the private sector, Gene was a CPA, owning his own accounting firm, championing small businesses in the Lansing area, and serving as the President of Junior Achievement of Mid-Michigan. Col. Eugene “Gene” Carolan passed away on July 22, 2021.\n\n1896-1970\n\nWalter J. Carr was born on January 15, 1896 in Ladd, Illinois. As an \"early bird\" in aviation, he had a multi-faceted career as a designer of aircraft, test pilot, instructor, and military officer, logging more than 20,000 hours of flight time.\n\nTrained as a railroad engineer, Carr first became interested in aviation when he helped repair two planes at a county fair in 1912. He entered the Chicago Flying School, receiving federal license 442, and after graduation entered the exhibition circuit, performing at fairs and other events throughout the country.\n\nWhen World War I broke out, Carr joined the aviation section of the Army Signal Corps and served as a flight instructor. After the war, he continued barnstorming began to design and build aircraft for the Paramount Aircraft Manufacturing Company of Saginaw. He also helped operate the Detroit, Saginaw, and Northern Airway. The depression put the company in receivership, but he was soon back in business, operating a skywriting service. In 1932, he designed and built the \"Carr Special,\" a long-wing monoplane with OX-5 engine in which he won 22 races in two years. In 1937, he test piloted the \"Explorer\" aircraft built by Abrams Aerial Survey Company.\n\nWhile serving as chief test pilot for Barkley-Grow at Detroit City Airport in the 1930s, Carr was chosen by Eddie Stinson to fly the first tri-motor to China and form the first Chinese airline. He flew the Canton to Hanoi route for a year before returning to the U.S.\n\nCarr joined the Michigan Aeronautics Commission in 1942 as a pilot and inspector, but when World War II broke out the 45 age limit was waived so he could return to uniform. When the war was over, he returned to the MAC where he remained until his retirement in 1962.\n\nIn 1967, at the age of 71, Carr took over the controls of a Lear executive jet and flew it at 535 miles per hour at an altitude of 28,000 feet.\n\nCarr was enshrined on November 7, 1991. He was a legend in Michigan aviation and his contributions to the development of aviation were many.\n\n1935-1967\n\nLt. Cdr. Roger B. Chaffee was born February 15, 1935, in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nIntroduced to aviation by his father, a former barnstorming pilot, Chaffee's early interests were model airplanes and science. Graduating from high school in 1953 with his sights on an engineering career, he entered the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corp (NROTC) at Illinois Institute of Technology, later transferring to Purdue University from which he received a degree in aeronautical engineering. It was here, in his last semester, he began flying.\n\nCompleting Navy flight training in 1959, he received assignment in the overhaul and repair of the A3D twin-engine jet photo reconnaissance plane and became one of the youngest pilots ever to fly in the A3D. Aerial flights taken during his flights over Florida's Cape Canaveral and Cuba were later used to map the area which became the launching center for the United States space program and to prove the existence of Russian missile bases in Cuba.\n\nChaffee was accepted in October, 1963, as one of the 14 people in the third group of astronauts in the United States space program. After completing training, he was selected for the first manned flight of the Apollo project in NASA's effort to progress toward the goal of landing a man on the moon by 1969. A tragic loss, he died on January 27, 1967, with two other astronauts, when the Apollo I spacecraft caught fire on the launch pad at Cape Kennedy, Florida.\n\nA Navy pilot with more than 2200 flying hours, mostly in jets, Chaffee was awarded the Navy Air Medal and NASA Distinguished Service Medal.\n\nChaffee was enshrined on October 22, 1994 for his contributions to the United States as a pilot, engineer, and astronaut. He is noted for his leadership and dedication to the advancement of the United States space program.\n\n1923-\n\nDr. John A. Clark, Professor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan, was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1923 and grew up in Royal Oak. After graduating from Royal Oak high school in June, 1941, he attended Lawrence Institute of Technology for a short time. With the outbreak of World War II, John, like many others of his generation, enlisted in the Army Air Corps in August, 1942, and was called for active duty in February, 1943. After completing military schooling and basic and multi-engine flight training in April, 1944, he was transferred to the Las Vegas Army Air Base to train as a B-17 Bomber copilot. It was here that John met his future wife, the late Marie Mountain Clark, who was serving as a Women Airforce Service Pilot (WASP). After completing B-17 training, John and his crew picked up a new B-17G in Nebraska, and made their way across the Atlantic to join the 100th Bomb Group, Eighth Air Force, known at the Bloody 100th due to their heavy combat losses, at Thorpe Abbots, East Anglia, England. Between October, 1944, and March, 1945, John completed 32 combat missions over Europe. He kept meticulous notes and records of all briefings, as well as a diary of his combat missions, all of which were incorporated into a book in 2001 titled An Eighth Air Force Combat Diary . He concluded his wartime service rated as a First Pilot, with over 600 hours in the B-17G, 300 of them in combat.\n\nFollowing separation from the U.S. Army Air Force in July, 1945, he married his late wife Marie, and enrolled in the University Of Michigan s College of Engineering. John continued to fly during his undergraduate years, serving as a pilot on a variety of aircraft with the 107th Bomb Squadron of the Michigan Air National Guard. He was also employed as a Research Associate by the U of M Aeronautical Research Center at Willow Run Airport, conducting studies on Ramjet engines for aircraft and missile applications. He graduated in 1948 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering, left the Michigan Air National Guard, and began work as a Research Engineer with United Aircraft Corporation in East Hartford, CT, where he worked to solve cooling problems with Ramjet engines. While there, he developed a proposal for the measurement of the static temperature of high-velocity gas flows in aircraft gas turbine exhausts, which he pursued as his Master s thesis topic at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). John received both his Master s and his Doctorate (Sc.D)\n\ndegrees from MIT in Mechanical Engineering by 1952 and joined the faculty as an assistant professor. In 1957, he joined the faculty at the University of Michigan, and was soon promoted to Chairman, Department of Mechanical Engineering. In his time spent at MIT, U of M, and throughout his later career, John worked on a wide variety of initiatives, including the establishment of a flight research program with the U.S. Air Force, research involving the\n\npropulsion systems of the Saturn Rocket, and research on heat transfer, thermal dynamics, and solar energy. Dr. Clark s broad national and international career in research and consulting also included serving as a member of President-elect Ronald Reagan s transition team for energy. Highly regarded in this field, Dr. Clark has authored over sixty technical papers and book contributions and has received numerous awards and honors from both the\n\nscientific and academic communities.\n\nBecause of his great contributions to aviation through both his service to his country as a pilot in World War II and in the advancement of aerospace science and technology through his research, John A. Clark embodies the virtue and qualities extolled by the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame.\n\nDanny Clisham announced at his first air show entirely by chance in October 1965, . Danny was in Elkins, WV as a ferry pilot for Bill Barber in an air show produced by Johnny Skyrocket Morgan. The show hired a local TV color man as its announcer who was quickly over matched for the job. Danny climbed on to the hay wagon to offer help, but instead, the TV anchor handed the microphone over to Danny and raced away. On that day, a legend was born.\n\nDanny immediately raised the game of the air show industry by viewing himself as an entertainer first and a pilot second. He decided that a suit and a boutonniere were appropriate so air show announcers were viewed more as Masters of Ceremonies. Years later, Danny would begin wearing his signature white suit.\n\nIn fifty years of air show announcing, Danny has seen just about every dynamic and static act in the industry and watched as air shows have increased in terms of entertainment value, skill and professionalism. He has seen show producers, skywriters, wingwalkers, pilots, ground acts, designers and builders all leave their mark on the air show industry. Danny has also watched the crowds at air shows grow exponentially as forward thinking show directors added sponsorships, corporate chalets and events within the event to attract more attendees, loyal attendees who come back to the shows year after year. The crowd makes all the difference, according to Danny. The spontaneous applause of a crowd held in rapt attention to an act is the most exciting and energizing thing that can happen at an air show.\n\nAir show announcing is one aspect of Danny s love for all things aviation. He spent his adult career as a professional airline pilot and retired from American Airlines with more than 30,000 hours of flight time. In fact, he holds a Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI) speed record for a commercial route \" a record that has not been broken for 30 years.\n\nDanny, still an active pilot, owns three general aviation aircraft. He has also worked as an aviation consultant on movies and for television shows.\n\nInduction into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame is the latest in a lengthy list of honors that includes: Induction into the ICAS Foundation s Air Show Hall of Fame; the ICAS Sword of Excellence; the Clifford W. Henderson Achievement Award; Honorary Membership in The Canadian Forces Jet Demonstration Team; The Art Scholl Memorial Showmanship Award; General Aviation News & Flyer Readers Choice Award; and the Bill Barber Award for Showmanship.\n\n1909-1996\n\nVice Admiral Thomas F. Connolly was born in October, 1909 in St. Paul, Minnesota. A 1933 U.S. Naval Academy graduate, he retired from the Navy in 1971 after 38 years of distinguished service.\n\nAs Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air Warfare) in the midst of congressional hearings concerning naval procurement of the F-111B fighter-bomber, he courageously upheld the tenants of naval aviation in the face of extreme opposition to urge its rejection. In its place, the mainstay carrier fighter of the past 25 years, the F-14 Tomcat was developed and named for Admiral Connolly.\n\nAfter earning a Masters of Aeronautical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he became a test pilot and co-authored a university-level text book on airplane aerodynamics. He established the Navy's elite Top Gun test pilot training center, commanded two carriers, was Commander Naval Air Pacific, and the first flag officer assigned for Navy Space requirements and programs.\n\nHe was instrumental in developing the modern aircraft carrier program, the first operational navigational satellite system, the Navy's Pacific missile range, Sidewinder missile, and a naval ordinance requirements system.\n\nAdmiral Connolly's awards and honors include three Distinguished Flying Crosses and three Air Medals earned during World War II, two Legions of Merit awards, the Award for Achievement of the National Aviation Club, the Kitty Hawk Memorial Award, and, in 1998, he was inducted into the Naval Aviation Hall of Honor in Pensacola, Florida. In addition, competing as a member of the American team in the 1932 Olympics, he won a bronze medal in gymnastics for rope climbing.\n\nAdmiral Connolly, who died in Holland, Michigan in 1996 at the age of 86, was enshrined into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on September 25, 1999 for his outstanding contributions to naval aviation and space programs.\n\n1924-2021\n\nMary Rawlinson Creason was born on November 20, 1924, in Greenwood, Delaware. Mary began flying prior to her 1944 graduation from Western Michigan College, and during her long aviation career she played a major role in aviation safety and education programs for the state of Michigan.\n\nAfter Mary's initial solo in 1943, she went on to earn private, commercial, and airline transport pilot licenses. Rated on both single-engine land and sea and multi-engine land airplanes, she began teaching in 1964 and by 1995 had accumulated over 10,500 flight hours, 5,500 of which as a flight instructor. She has held positions as an air taxi pilot, flight and ground instructor, airport manager, fixed base owner and operator, airplane salesperson, aviation writer and publisher, and has volunteered as an FAA Accident Prevention Counselor. She continues to teach, write, and promote aviation education and safety. Early on in her career, Mary faced the hardships of discrimination against women pilots, an experience she attributes to her drive to excel in her aviation skills.\n\nMary began working for the state of Michigan's Bureau of Aeronautics in 1977 as Editor of Michigan Aviation, while also serving as an air transport pilot, coordinator of safety, and development of educational programs. Later she became Administrator of the Safety and Services Division and then Assistant Deputy Director. After her retirement in 1989, Mary was appointed by Governor Blanchard to the Aeronautics Commission and served as its Chairman in 1991.\n\nAccepting a presidential appointment, Mary served as a member of the Womens/Citizens Advisory Committee on Aviation to the FAA from 1969 to 1974. She participated in many national and state air races, placing in the top ten four times in national races, and top five four times in the Michigan SMALL Race. She has received many awards, trophies, and citations during her long and illustrious career.\n\nA catalyst for the promotion and advancement of aviation, aviation safety, and aviation education, the effect of Mary's involvement has spread through the thousands of students and associates with whom she has been in contact.\n\nMary Rawlinson Creason was enshrined on October 14, 1995, for her dedication to Michigan aviation for over 50 years.\n\n1944-\n\nFirst Lieutenant James L. DeVoss attended elementary, high school, and junior college in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and graduated from the University of Michigan with a B.S. in Zoology and Chemistry. After joining the United States Air Force in 1967, he trained as an F-105 Thunderchief (THUD) pilot and was eventually deployed to fly combat missions over Vietnam and Northern Laos.\n\nOn June 16, 1969, DeVoss took off as flight lead on what he described as a \"typical mission\" , his 71st since arriving in Southeast Asia. DeVoss and his flight were to bomb roads and vehicles used as part of the \"Ho Chi Minh Trail\", the main supply route of the North Vietnamese Army. After dropping his bombs at their second target, DeVoss rolled in behind his wingman to cover him on his run. While there was heavy anti-aircraft fire in the area, DeVoss didn't recall feeling any strike his aircraft. \"I didn't see or hear anything,\" said DeVoss. \" I was on the radio telling the guys to rejoin so we could hit the post-strike tanker to get some gas and go home when, all of a sudden, the nose of the plane started to weave around real funny-like. I thought 'This can't be happening to me!', but it was...\"\n\nDeVoss fought to stay in the air but found his controls unresponsive. Suspecting a hit to the aircraft s hydraulic system, he increased his speed to stabilize and began to run through the checklist for ejecting. After jettisoning his wing tanks to reduce weight, the aircraft nosed over unexpectedly and began rapidly gaining speed. As the pilots in DeVoss' flight screamed \"Get out! Get out!\" over the radio, he surveyed his situation and found he had well exceeded safe ejection speed. With no alternative, he was forced to \"punch out\" at over 700 miles per hour. As he left the aircraft, the shock of the high-speed wind broke his left arm and both of his legs. Badly injured, thinking his left arm had actually been torn off, he maintained consciousness and continued to follow the ejection sequence as he'd been trained. While his parachute deployed successfully, he found he was unable to control his descent and was impaled by bamboo shoots when he hit the ground. Despite this, he was still able to administer basic first aid and deploy his emergency beacon and radio. He contacted his flight, who began to coordinate search and rescue efforts while flying cover over his position.\n\nWhen a pilot goes down in combat, their rescue is considered \"all hands\" meaning every available resource is diverted to the effort. One of the rescue units responding to DeVoss' emergency was trained in the use of film equipment, and the entire mission was recorded. The Air Force determined Lt. DeVoss' survival was due largely to his precise adherence to correct emergency procedures, and the film of his rescue was used in an Air Force rescue training film titled Faces of Rescue, which is still in use today.\n\nFor the past 45 years, DeVoss has shown the film and lectured for countless groups and organizations free of charge, emphasizing the depth of training of each U.S. Air Force Pilot, and his own personal patriotic dedication to our country and our military forces. Lt. DeVoss was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, Purple Heart, Air Medal with oak leaf clusters, Air Force Presidential Citation, the National Defense Medal, and the Vietnam Service Medal. Unable to continue to fly due to his injuries, DeVoss was employed by the Amway Corporation from 1972 through 2015, and was responsible for the creation and initial management of nine American-owned, locally operated Middle and Eastern Europe affiliates of the company.\n\nFor his selfless dedication and sacrifice, James DeVoss embodies the virtues of the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame.\n\n1912-1990\n\nBeaumont \"Pard\" Diver was born in Deerfield, Michigan in 1912 and began his career in aviation when he started working at Meyers Aircraft Co. in Tecumseh in 1940. While there, he helped design and build the Meyers OTW, 145 and 200. He also signed the airworthiness certificates for all three aircraft and made them official airplanes.\n\nDiver made the creation and restoration of many one-of-a-kind projects possible. If parts were not available, he would fabricate them. He excelled in aircraft aluminum and was known for his ability to make just about any part necessary to keep the plane flying.\n\nDiver worked at Meyers Aircraft Co. for more than 50 years, and in 1990 was honored by Michigan Aviation Magazine. The magazine acknowledged the five decades of expertise Diver devoted to the design and construction of the exclusive handmade Meyers single-engine biplanes and thousands of experimental aircraft parts.\n\nOn August 11, 1990, Diver passed away while working on an airplane he helped build and patent. He was the last of the original FAA licensed Meyers repairmen. After his passing, the Al Meyers Airport in Tecumseh was officially renamed the Meyers-Diver's Airport. Diver often said he was thankful for living in the time of history that he did. The advances in his lifetime amazed him as he went from flowing behind two mules before the advent of electricity, to his own ride on the Concorde jet, breaking the sound barrier.\n\nDiver is warmly and fondly remembered not only in Southeast Michigan, but around the world wherever there are aviators who had the privilege of working with him. He had an interest in people and learned everything important about those he worked with. His love for his family, friends and country shined through unmistakably. His trademark red baseball cap became the accepted garb for Meyers Aircraft Owners Association members, who known how reliable and safe their airplanes are, thanks to Diver's careful and painstaking efforts.\n\nBeaumont \"Pard\" Diver was enshrined into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on May 21, 2011.\n\n1924-2013\n\nUrban Leonard Ben Drew was born in Detroit, Michigan on March 21, 1924. He entered the U.S. Army Air Force in October, 1942 and graduated as a 2nd Lieutenant and received his pilot's wings in 1943. Lt. Drew arrived in England aboard the Queen Elizabeth in May of 1944 and was assigned to the 375th Fighter Squadron, 361st Fighter Group, based at Bottisham, Chambridgeshire. During his tour with the \"Yellow Jackets,\" Drew completed 75 missions, the last of which on November 1, 1944. He rose to the command of \"A\" flight of the 375th Squadron and rotated to the U.S. in December of 1944.\n\nAmong his victories, most notable were the two Messerschmitt ME-262 jet aircraft shot down on October 7, 1944. This made Ben Drew the first allied airman to destroy two German jets in aerial combat. On September 18, 1944 Drew helped destroy, with the aid of two wingmen, the largest aircraft then in existence, a Luftwaffe Blohm & Voss BV-268 six-engine flying boat at Lake Schaal in Northern Germany.\n\nAfter completion of his European tour, Drew served with the 413th Fighter Squadron, 414th Fighter Group, flying P-47N-5s from Iwo Jima in the Bonin Islands. After the war, Drew helped reconstitute the Michigan Air National Guard, serving with the 127th Fighter Group. He completed his military service as a Major with the following record: Six Luftwaffe aircraft destroyed, one damaged (air), one destroyed (ground). His decorations include the Air Force Cross, two Distinguished Flying Crosses, and 14 Air Medals.\n\nIn 1983, at a Pentagon ceremony, Mr. Vernon Orr, then Secretary of the U.S. Air Force, presented Major Drew the Air Force Cross 39 years after he downed two ME-262 jet fighters.\n\nAfter 1953, Mr. Drew was heavily involved in commercial aviation. He was a principle with several air cargo and charter operations. He brokered aircraft internationally and provided the C-47 aircraft and flight crews for the filing of the movie \"A Bridge Too Far.\"\n\nUrban \"Ben\" Drew was enshrined in the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on September 25, 1999 for his long and dedicated aviation career as a pilot in war and in peace. He passed away April 3, 2013.\n\n1894-1955\n\nIvan H. Driggs was born April 8, 1894 in Lansing, Michigan. He graduated from high school in 1912 and attended Michigan Agriculture College. Taking a job as a draftsmen at the Burgess Company, Marble Head, Mass. In 1914, he began an aviation career that spanned more than forty years until his death in 1955.\n\nThroughout the years of 1915 and 1916 he designed, built and flew an airplane, the first of many that would follow. In 1917 he went to McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio, where he designed improvements to the Nelson gun synchronizer. Following World War I, he supervised the mechanical design of the RB-1-the first airplane with practical retractable landing gear, wing flaps, enclosed cockpit, streamlined fuselage and full cantilever wings- at the Dayton-Wright Co.\n\nIn 1923, he helped start Consolidated Aircraft Co. in East Greenwich, Rhode Island.

Here he designed the Luscombe Phantom, the first production light plane with an all metal frame and monocoque fuselage. In 1936 he joined the Glenn L. Martin Co. in Baltimore, Maryland as head of Research and Development.\n\nWhen J.S. McDonnell started McDonnell Aircraft Corp. in 1939, Ivan became its Vice President and Chief Engineer. When World War II began in 1941, Ivan joined the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics becoming Director of the Research Division and then Chief Scientist of the naval Air Development Center overseeing the Electronic, Armament, Aircraft Instrument, Photographic, Guided Weapon and Medical Development laboratories.\n\nHe was appointed a Fellow in the Royal Aeronautical Society and Institute of Aeronautical Sciences, and received an Honorary Doctorate from Stevens Institute of Technology.\n\nIvan H. Driggs was enshrined in the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on October 19, 1996 for his outstanding contributions to aviation from its earliest days of fabric covered, piston engine powered aircraft to the era of jet powered aircraft.\n\n1922-2005\n\nLt. Col. Howard R. Ebersole was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1922. After high school graduation in 1938, he served two years as a radio operator on Ford Motor Co.'s ships before enlisting in the Army Signal Corp. In 1942, Ebersole was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant and attended flight training. He became a qualified B-24 pilot in 1944. He was then assigned to the 392nd Bomb Group, 8th AF, and flew 16 combat missions over Europe.\n\nIn December 1945, Ebersole transferred to the Reserve Forces and enrolled in the University of Michigan's College of Engineering. He received a BSEE in January, 1951 and was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. He was assigned to Luke AFB in Arizona as a captain and commanded the F-51, F-80 and F-84 academic training section. Ebersole was sent to Korea in 1952, and flew 100 combat missions (30 in the F-51 and 70 in the F-80), during one of which he shot down a MiG-15.\n\nAt Selfridge AFB in Michigan between 1956 and 1957 he earned an MSEE degree from the University of Michigan in addition to his pilot and instructor pilot duties. At Holloman AFB in New Mexico, he was a test pilot and project officer for the F-101B operational qualification. In addition, he was the F-102/GAR-11 (first nuclear warhead air-to-air missile) Category II test director. In 1966, he directed the Missiles and Munitions Branch, HQ, Tactical Air Command in developing the operational and technical specifications for today's \"smart bombs\" and improved air-to-air missiles.\n\nEbersole retired from active duty in 1969 and became an associate professor in the Aerospace and Engineering Department at Mississippi State University and deputy director/test pilot in the Raspert Flight Research Laboratory. In 1976-1977, Ebersole joined the Rockwell International as senior project engineer for the B-1 crew escape systems tests at El Segundo, California and Holloman AFB high-speed track.\n\nEbersole had more than 11,500 flying hours and 2,760 glider flights.

After graduating from Detroit Pershing High School, he joined the Air Force. Airman Edwards applied and was accepted into the Air Force Academy, however, because he chose marriage, he attended Officer Candidate School (OCS).\n\nEdwards received his commission as a 2nd Lieutenant and completed Air Force Pilot training. He flew the F-100 and the F-101 Voodoo. During his off-duty time at various assignments, Edwards participated in university courses and earned a Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nDue to the racist actions of some in the Air Force, Edwards felt that resigning his commission in 1964 was in the best interests of him and his family. He moved back to Detroit shortly thereafter.\n\nThat same year, he completed all of his civilian pilot ratings, including commercial instructor and multi-engine. Edwards applied to United Airlines and passed the qualifying test with flying colors. The airline was ready to hire him until they realized he was African American, at which point they suggested he get some heavy multi-engine flying time.\n\nIn 1965-1966, United hired 120 pilots with no flying experience, allowing them one year to get their certification. Edwards applied, but was turned down. In 1967, the U.S. Justice Department met with the Tuskegee Airmen, who encouraged Edwards to join in a class action lawsuit against United.\n\nWhile waiting for the wheels of justice to turn, Edwards founded AERO\n\nServices Inc., a freight transport company and flight school. He also served as plant manager for Chrysler Corp. at its Warren and Centerline facilities.\n\nThe lawsuit settled in 1976. The judge decreed that Edwards' ratings and flight experience would qualify him for United's next new pilot class. This decree also opened all jobs at United Airlines for minorities and women. To overcome another last-minute barrier, he earned an engineer's rating in only two days.\n\nIn 1976, Edwards became a founding member of the Organization of Black Airline Pilots, now the Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals. He flew the 727, 757, 767, DC-10 and the 747-100, 200, and 400 for United Airlines. He retired from United in March, 2000. Edwards was elected President of the Detroit Chapter of the Tuskegee Airmen in 2003, and enshrined into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on October 11 of the same year. He passed away December 7, 2010.\n\n1920-2012\n\nCol. Marvin \"Sonny\" Eliot was born December 5, 1920 and raised in Detroit, Michigan and attended Central High School and Wayne State University, where the broadcasting career for which he is best known.\n\nEqually impressive is his aviation career, which began at Wayne County Airport. He soloed in a piper cub and received his license in 1940. The next year he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and trained in many military planes including the C-47 and C-39.\n\nAfter training, during which he saw duty at bases in Texas, Arizona and Kansas, Eliot was shipped to England and was assigned to the 392nd Heavy Bomb Group, flying B-24s in the Eighth Air Force based in Norwich. He was shot down over Gotha, Germany by FW190s on his 16th mission, was captured and spent 16 months as a POW in Stalag-Luft 1 in Barth, Germany. The Gotha mission made him a battle-hardened veteran of the grimmest days of the air war. The 392nd committed 36 air crews to this mission and lost 73 planes, the third heaviest losses of the war. It earned the group the Presidential Unit Citation for one of the most vital air strikes of the aerial war.\n\nHis other honors include the Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Medal and Purple Heart.\n\nAfter World War II duty he was still devoted to flying, amassing over 7,500 hours of flight time. While at Channel 4 TV and WWJ Radio in Detroit, Eliot won many news media awards for promotion and public awareness of aviation. He has flown extensively throughout the U.S., Canada and Mexico in his own aircraft(C-120) and has been an FAA prevention counselor for many years. He holds the rank of Colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve and was named Air Force liaison officer for the 1st Congressional District.\n\nHome from the war in 1945, he returned to Detroit and spent the next 57 years on the city's airwaves with WWJ and the TV channels 4 and 2, where Eliot earned his greatest fame as a weatherman.\n\nHis witty weather reports have been named the nation's best by the National Association of TV Program Executives (NATPE).\n\nMarvin \"Sonny\" Eliot was enshrined into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on October 6, 2001. He passed away November 16, 2012 at the age of 91.\n\n1944-\n\nRobert E. Ellis was born on January 15, 1944 in Cabool, Missouri. After graduating from high school in Mountain Grove in 1962, he attended Missouri University and left to pursue a career in the automobile industry. Upon graduating from Bailey Technical Institute in St. Louis, he purchased a Phillips 66 service station that he ran until he made a bid to purchase a Ford Motor Co. dealership in 1967. The dealership bid was rejected and Ellis moved his family to Kalamazoo where he worked for his brother as an apprentice aviation mechanic at Kal-Aero Inc., a fixed-base aircraft maintenance facility at the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport. In 1976, Ellis attended Kings Aviation Technology School in Knoxville, Tennessee where he successfully fulfilled the requirements to receive an FAA Airframe and Powerplant License.\n\nAfter eight years of working at Kal-Aero Inc., the last five of which he managed the aircraft engine overhaul division, he moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee where he served as the chief of corporate aircraft maintenance for Brock & Blevins Inc., a corporation engaged in building atomic power plants.\n\nIn 1977, Ellis accepted the first employee position of general manager for the newly established Kalamazoo Aviation History Museum, now known as the Air Zoo. His title was later changed to executive director until 2010, when he was named president and CEO.\n\nEllis' early responsibilities included the development and running of the newly established aviation museum, as well as the maintenance and restoration of World War II aircraft, which participated in air shows across the country. Six of these aircraft received Grand Champion Awards at the EAA's annual air shows in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Ellis was also responsible for the development of staff to introduce educational and Scout programs for children of all ages.\n\nIn 1985, Ellis championed the first expansion of the museum as newly-acquired aircraft could no longer be exhibited indoors. The expansion tripled its size of the museum to 45,000 square feet and included a larger exhibit hall, a video theater, a new museum store, and a larger library. In 1992, at Ellis' request, the board approved the introduction of a simulator where guest could experience flights in a Corsair. As a result, attendance doubled.\n\nIn 2000, he came up with an innovative and engaging concept for the Air Zoo to reach a broader audience by designing a new 120,000-square-foot aviation attraction. The new attraction featured a more interactive and entertaining approach to paying tribute to America's aviation pioneers. It featured the Midwest's first 4-D theater, the Montgolfier Balloon Race, amusement park-style rides and even more aircraft for guests of all ages to enjoy.\n\nIn 2011, the Air Zoo expanded yet again, thanks to Ellis' continued quest to provide the best possible experience possible to every guest. A 50,000-square-foot exhibit hall was added to the main building to make room for new and current exhibits, aircraft, and space artifacts. This new East Wing gallery houses the Space: Dare to Dream exhibit, along with an exhibit about women in aviation and space. It also features a gallery for WWII aircraft, a climate-controlled archive and a library.\n\nUnder Ellis' vision and leadership, the museum's creative presentation of the history of flight, its educational programs and its unique interactive attractions for families distinguish the Air Zoo from all other aviation museums. The Air Zoo is the first and only aviation museum of its kind.\n\nEllis has served as a board member for the Michigan State Bureau of Aeronautics Education Coalition, the Kalamazoo County Chamber of Commerce, and the board chair for the Kalamazoo County Convention and Visitors Bureau. He has also served as an advisory board member for the Virginia Aviation Museum and a master of ceremonies for the Kalamazoo County Chamber of Commerce. Ellis has been featured as a speaker at numerous conferences, including the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's Mutual Concerns Seminar.\n\n1940-\n\nJohn M. Ellis III was born in Springfield, Missouri on December 24, 1940. John's aviation career started when he had a flight in a J-3 Cub piloted by his father when he was six years old. Since then, John has amassed more than 9,000 accident-free hours as a pilot. John graduated from the University of Missouri in 1962, the same year he received his private pilot's license.\n\nJohn entered the U.S. Navy and received his wings in 1963 at the Naval Air Station in Kingsville, Texas. During his naval career he flew seven different types of naval aircraft including three supersonic types.\n\nJohn moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan in late 1967 and opened a fix-base operation known as Kal-Aero Inc. and continues to serve as president and General Manager.\n\nStarting Kal-Aero with four full-time and three part-time employees, over the years Kal-Aero has grown into one of the largest aviation maintenance and repair facilities of corporate aircraft in the United States currently employing over 320 people. The facility is located in Battle Creek, Michigan.\n\nHis Michigan aviation interests and affiliations include the Michigan Aviation Trade Association, The Michigan Association of Aviation businesses, an officer and Director of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) War Birds, a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, Vice Chairman and Safety Officer of the International Council of Air Shows (ICAS), and President of the High on America Air Show Board.\n\nJohn has flown more than 100 different aircraft types and holds an FAA certificate for low level aerobatics and performs in various air shows in World War II era aircraft.\n\nJohn Ellis, pilot, businessman and aviation promoter was enshrined into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on October 19, 1996 for his many contributions to his country and to the State of Michigan with over 30 years of working unselfishly developing a major Michigan Aviation Business.\n\n1908-2002\n\nCdr. Michael R. Erard was born on October 5, 1908 near Argyle, Michigan. He was a member of four military air forces, logging more than 14,000 accident-free hours of flight time in 53 years.\n\nErard was only 16 years old when he saw a squadron of P-1s fly over his parents' farm, deciding then that flying was going to be his life. He obtained his pilot's license in 1926 and operated his own flying school until 1929 when the Depression forced him to close it. He joined the Michigan Air National Guard the next year as a private and was soon a pilot and a second lieutenant. He resigned in 1933 when he received his letter of acceptance into the French Air Force. Erard was the only American who served actively as a military pilot in the French Air Force since WW I.\n\nHe returned to the U.S. in December 1937, and then joined Lockheed Aircraft Corporation on the production flight test staff. In 1940 he was accepted into the U.S. Air Force as a flight instructor. In January 1943, Erard transferred to the U.S. Naval Air Force to take charge of the entire Free French Navy Primary Pilot Training Program. He remained in the U.S. Navy until his retirement in June, 1963.\n\nErard was decorated with the Aeronautical Medal by the French government in 1983 and was inducted into the Aviation Pioneers Hall of Fame in 1986. He was also selected as \"Airman of the Year\" by the Yankee Air Force in 1986.\n\nErard was enshrined on October 26, 1991 for his dedication to flying and the advancement of aviation. His love of aviation and dedicated military service serve as an example and inspiration to all. He passed away January 19, 2002.\n\n1893-1966\n\nBrig. Gen. Floyd E. Evans was born on November 24, 1893 in Hinkley, Illinois. His military career began as a corps cadet at the University of Illinois in July 1917. He completed flying school at Dayton, Ohio, received his pilot's wings and was commissioned a first lieutenant in November 1917. From March 1918 to March 1919 he served with the American Expeditionary Forces 88th Observation Squadron in France. He was discharged August 14, 1919 from the U.S. Army with the rank of Captain.\n\nIn December 1919 he was appointed a Major in the Officer Reserve Corps and served until May 1926 when he joined the 107th Observation Squadron, Michigan National Guard. In June 1931 he was appointed as the Division Aviation Officer, 32nd Infantry Division, Michigan National Guard. In October of 1940 he re-entered active Federal duty for World War II, serving as a military observer in the Allied Forces Campaigns in West Africa. He separated from Federal Service in January 1946.\n\nJoining the staff of Headquarters Detachment, Michigan National Guard in March, 1947 as a Lieutenant Colonel he served as the senior air officer until his retirement as a Colonel on January 27, 1954. At that time he had complied over 34 years of service to state and country. He was promoted to Brigadier General (Retired) on December 1, 1960.\n\nFor his military service, Brig. Gen. Evans was awarded the U.S. Commendation Medal with Palm; World War I Liberty Medal with five stars; the Purple Heart Medal; the French Croix deQuirre; the American Defense Medal; the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal; and the World War II Victory Medal.\n\nIn June 1930, Governor Green appointed him to the Michigan State Board of Aeronautics and six months later appointed him Director-a position he held for 14 years. In additional to the enforcement of air regulations, Evans initiated many of today's Michigan Aeronautics Commission programs. He advanced aerial tourism by promoting air tours and initiating the nation's first Sunday morning \"Dawn Patrol.\"\n\nBrig. Gen. Floyd E. Evans was enshrined into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on October 10, 1998 for his long and exemplary military aviation career and his dedicated service to Michigan.\n\nBorn in 1911, Ralph Fletcher grew up in Portage, MI, and attended Western State Teachers College (now Western Michigan University) in Kalamazoo.\n\nEventually graduating in 1932 from the Milwaukee School of Engineering with a BS degree in electrical engineering, Fletcher joined the United States Navy in 1937, earned his wings in December of 1938, and served as a carrier pilot assigned to patrol the Pacific Ocean aboard the U.S.S. Saratoga from 1938-39.\n\nReassigned to Scouting Squadron 72 flying from the U.S.S. Wasp, he participated in Atlantic operations until January 1942. At the onset of WWII, then-Lieutenant Fletcher was reassigned to the U.S. Naval Air Station in Miami, FL as a fighter and dive-bomber instructor, and later served as the Commanding Officer of the Air Station’s Night Flying Division. Deployed to the Pacific in 1944 as the Aviation Officer for Amphibious Group 12 (and later the 5th Amphibious Force), Fletcher saw combat throughout the Central and Western Pacific and over Japan. Retiring from active duty in 1946, he served in the Naval Reserves until 1951, and retired at the rank of Captain.\n\nAs a civilian, Ralph Fletcher briefly served as Senior Test Engineer for the Sikorsky Division of the United Aircraft Corporation and was then employed by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (now the Federal Aviation Administration), Washington, DC, in multiple capacities from 1946 to 1972, where he eventually retired as Chief, Designation & Documentation of the Airspace Utilization Division, Air Traffic Service.\n\nFor his service to our nation and for his dedication and contributions to aviation, Captain Ralph H. Fletcher is inducted into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on October 9, 2021.\n\n1924-2018\n\nCol. Walter B. Forbes served as a USAF pilot in World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam. He was assigned to the 48th Fighter Group, 9th Air Force, Europe during World War II.\n\nBorn in Niles, Michigan, Forbes' passion for aviation began when he was just five years old and his grandparents lived next to the community's grass airstrip. One day, Henry Ford's Tri-Motor landed on that airstrip. After taking a ride on the airplane with his aunt, Forbes was hooked on planes.\n\nBy the time he was 20, he flown his P-47, the Gal From Kalamazoo, on 72 combat missions over Europe and including a mission over Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944 in support of the D-Day Invasion. He also destroyed one confirmed German ME-109 and provided air support for General Patton's march into Paris and Belgium. After World War II, Forbes also ended up flying a Republic F-84, North American F-86 and the North American F-100 Super Sabre.\n\nDuring the Korean War, he flew 2,600 Transpac hours over the Pacific, Asia and the Middle East. He was assigned as commanding officer to the F-100 Training Wing, Nellis Air Force Base where he taught pilots how to fly the F-100s. Forbes flew 67 missions during Vietnam-mostly at night-interdicting transportation. He also served on Air Staff at the Pentagon for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nForbes retired as a colonel and was awarded the Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross with cluster, Air Medal with 16 clusters, Joint Services Commendation Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal and a Bronze Star. He logged more than 5,100 hours of flight time in military jets including single-engine props, twin-engine props, four-engine props and single-engine jets. He also logged more than 900 hours in civilian aircraft.\n\nForbes lived in Kalamazoo with his wife and was an active volunteer at the Air Zoo. He was enshrined into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on April 18, 2009, and passed away February 3, 2018.\n\n1893-1943\n\nEdsel Bryant Ford, the only child of Henry Ford and Clara Bryant, was born in Detroit, Michigan in November, 1893.\n\nAs Edsel Ford matured and assumed responsibility in the Ford Motor Co., he and his father watched the development of aviation with interest. In 1921, Edsel Ford subscribed to and became a director of the Detroit Aviation Society, and in 1922 became an officer and director of the Aircraft Development Co. which was formed to build the first all-metal dirigible.\n\nThe following year he donated $10,000 to guarantee the prize money for the Pulitzer Trophy Air Race held at Selfridge Field in Mt. Clemens, Michigan. He was elected to the finance committee of the National Aeronautic Association in 1923 and became active in its fund solicitation drive.\n\nBy this time the Fords had become aware of William Stout and his efforts to build the first all-metal commercial airplane in the United States, and thus Edsel Ford became a stockholder in the Stout Metal Airplane Co. When the Fords purchased the company in 1925, Henry Ford commented: \"This interest in aviation is largely Edsel's idea and he deserves the credit. Airplanes belong to another generation.\"\n\nEdsel Ford was very active in the promotion of the National Air Tours (1925-1931) that demonstrated to the public the safety and reliability of commercial aviation and the need for modern airfields across the United States.\n\nEdsel Ford was the primary sponsor of Richard Byrd's Arctic and Antarctic expeditions. Ford contributed generously himself and solicited donations from other prominent businessmen. Byrd wrote Edsel Ford regarding these expeditions: \"The whole thing would have been impossible without your backing and encouragement. I owe a great deal to a great many people, but I owe more to you than all the rest put together.\"\n\nWith the advent of World War II and the failing health of his father, Edsel Ford was active in the operations of the Ford war production machine epitomized by the vast Willow Run bomber plant, where, as forecasted but widely ridiculed, these mammoth planes were produced at the rate of one an hour.\n\nEdsel Ford passed away in 1943 at the age of 49. He was enshrined into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on October 11, 2003.\n\n1863-1947\n\nHenry Ford was born in Springwells Township, Wayne County, Michigan on July 30, 1863. Though his life's work began with the mass production of automobiles, he was also a pioneer in the field of aviation.\n\nFord's interest in aviation began in 1909 when he helped his son build a monoplane. Though it flew briefly, it was destroyed in a crash and Ford's interest in aviation waned. However, during the war Ford mass produced \"Liberty\" aircraft engines, then, in 1923, he invested in the Stout Metal Airplane Company. The Stout all-metal \"Air-Transport\" was perfected, and, pleased with the design, Ford purchased several and used them to establish the world's first regularly-scheduled airline devoted to the business needs of a single company. Called the Ford Air Transportation Service, it carried Ford auto parts and company mail between Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, and Buffalo.\n\nAlso, to promote confidence in aviation, Ford sponsored an annual Ford Reliability Tour that involved non-military aircraft flying a scheduled route with stops at numerous cities.\n\nIn 1925 Ford acquired the Stout Metal Airplane Company and made it an operating division. With the introduction of the Ford Tri-Motor in 1926, and Ford Airplane Manufacturing Division became the world's largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft. He built the Ford Airport at Dearborn in 1926. It was the world's first truly complete and modern airport. In addition, Ford developed a midget \"Flivver\" airplane that promised to bring the personal aircraft within the means of the average person.\n\nThough the Depression temporarily forced Ford to discontinue his aviation activities, during WWII, the Ford Motor Company mass-produced Pratt and Whitney \"Double Wasp\" aircraft engines and Consolidated B-24 \"Liberator\" bombers.\n\nFord was enshrined on September 15, 1990 for his dominant role in the advancements of the aircraft industry in Michigan.\n\n1920-1998\n\nCapt. Robert F. Freitag was born in Jackson, Michigan on January 20, 1920. After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1941 with a degree in aeronautical engineering, Freitag went on to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for graduate work in aeronautical engineering in 1941-42. He was also commissioned an ensign in the Naval Reserve in 1941.\n\nFreitag has been involved in the guided missile and rocket field since 1945, with assignments that included aerodynamic development of Navy guided missiles, establishment of supersonic wind tunnels, and guided missile intelligence assignments.\n\nIn 1951, he received a special commendation from the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet for planning and operations associated with the first Navy guided missiles employed during the Korean War. From 1953 until 1955, Freitag was assigned to the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics where he was in charge of the REGULUS missile program. In 1955, he became Project Officer in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations on the Jupiter and Polaris intermediate range ballistic missiles and the Vanguard earth satellite. That assignment was followed by a tour of duty as range planning officer, leading up to his appointment as Special Assignment to the Commander, Pacific Missile Range.\n\nIn 1959, Freitag became the director of space and astronautics systems development, supporting research, operational planning, and program management at the Bureau of Naval Weapons. From 1963 to 1986 he worked for NASA negotiating international agreements for space programs, and has also worked on Mercury, Gemini, Apollo-Soyuz and Spacelab programs. He passed away on April 21, 1998. He was enshrined into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on November 7, 1992 for his efforts in the advancement of aviation through his work with both the Navy and NASA on missile technology.\n\n1925-2009\n\nRobert A. Fuhrman was born on February 23, 1925 in Detroit, Michigan. During his long career with the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, he rose to positions of trust and responsibility achieved by very few in the aerospace field.\n\nHe graduated from the University of Michigan in 1945 with a degree in aeronautical engineering and earned a master's degree from the University of Maryland in 1952. Fuhrman joined Lockheed in 1958 as technical staff head of Polaris systems development and advanced to chief engineer of the Missile Systems Division in 1964 and to vice president and assistant manager of the Missile Systems Division in 1966. He became president of the Lockheed-Georgia Company, builders of the C-5A, in 1970. In 1971, he was selected as president of Lockheed-California Company, home of the famous Skunk Works and builders of the L-1011 and the Navy P-3A Orion. Two years later he became executive vice president at LMSC.\n\nIn 1988 Fuhrman became vice chairman of the board and chief operating officer for the entire Lockheed Corporation. He became a senior advisor to Lockheed and also served as the chairman of the boards of directors of two wholly owned subsidiaries of Lockheed: Lockheed Canada Inc. and Lockheed Space Operations Company.\n\nIn addition to his work at Lockheed, he had also served on many government boards and panels, including the President's national Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee and the Defense Science Board. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering and is a senior member of the American Astronautical Society. In 1987 he was elected an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\n\nFuhrman was enshrined on October 26, 1991 for his lifelong dedication to the advancement of the aerospace industry. He remained a senior advisor for Lockheed until his death on November 25, 2009 in Pebble Beach, California.\n\n1919-2002\n\nCol. Francis Stanley Gabreski was born to Polish immigrants in Oil City, Pennsylvania on January 28, 1919. \"Gabby\" began flying lesions while at the University of Notre Dame, and when World War II erupted with the Nazi invasion of Poland, Gabreski eagerly joined the Army Air Corps, earning his wings in 1941. As a second lieutenant, he joined a fighter unit at Wheeler Field in Hawaii. On the morning of December 7, 1941, he managed to get airborne in a P-36 fighter, but by then the Japanese pilots were nowhere to be found.\n\nBecause he spoke Polish and had strong feelings about what the Nazis had done to Poland, Gabreski asked to be assigned to a Polish fighter united attached to the Royal Air Force. He flew missions over Europe with Polish pilots early in 1943 before joining the United States 56th Fighter Group in Britain.\n\nHe went on to become known as America's World War II Air Ace in Europe. Flying single-engine P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, Gabreski downed 28 German aircraft between August, 1943 and July, 1944. He also destroyed three more aircraft on the ground.\n\nGabby was captured in July, 1944 after crash landing near Koblenz, Germany and endured 10 months as a prisoner of war. After the war, Gabreski worked for Grumman Aerospace and was also head of the Long Island Rail Road-the nation's busiest commuter line.\n\nIn August, 1949, Gabreski was reassigned to the 56th Fighter Group at Selfridge Air Force Base in Michigan as Commanding Officer. He was later assigned to the 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing in Korea and became Commander of the 51st Fighter Interceptor Wing. While with the 51st, Gabreski became history's eighth \"Jet Ace.\" Flying an F-86 Sabre jet, he shot down six Soviet built MiG-15 fighters and shared credit for the downing of another.\n\nGabreski flew 266 combat missions in two wars, twice earning his \"Ace\" status by destroying 31 enemy aircraft in World War II and 6 and-a-half enemy aircraft in Korea for a total of 37 and-a-half aircraft.\n\nAfter his war-time duties, Gabreski served in several important military positions and completed Command and Staff School to become Deputy Chief of Staff Operations for the Ninth Air Force in 1955. Gabreski then went to Okinawa to become Commander of the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing in 1950. Two years later he served as Director of the Secretariat for the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Air Force in Hawaii, and later as its Inspector General.\n\nIn 1964, he became commander of the 52nd Fighter Wing and left the Air Force from this assignment in 1967, ending a military career that earned him nearly every military air honor.\n\nAmong his many decorations were: The Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star with Oak Leaf Cluster, Distinguished Flying Cross with nine Oak Leave Clusters, Air Medal with four clusters, the Bronze Star, the French Legion D'Honneur and Croix de Guerre with Palm, Polish Cross of Valor, the British Distinguished Flying Cross and the Belgian Croix de Guerre.\n\nLater in life, Gabby lived in Dix Hills, New York. He died January 31, 2002. He was enshrined into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame on October 8, 2005.\n\nVice Adm. Richard K. Gallagher was born in Traverse City, Michigan. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in June 1976 and was designated a naval aviator in September 1977 at Chase Field in Beeville, Texas. He earned a bachelor's degree in physics and a master's degree in public administration from George Washington University, and attended the military's Industrial College of the Armed Forces.\n\nGallagher's first fleet assignment was to Fighter Squadron 103 where he was deployed twice aboard the USS Saratoga, flying both the F-4J and F-4S. In October 1981, he reported for pilot transition in the F-14 to Fighter Squadron 101 at Naval Air Station Oceana, where he remained as an instructor.\n\nFollowing an F-14 fleet tour in Fighter Squadron 143, Gallagher reported to Naval Strike Warfare Center in Fallon, Nevada in October 1987.

Eisenhower spanning Desert Shield and Desert Storm.\n\nHe went on to command the Navy Fighter Weapons School, TOPGUN, from September 1993 to December 1994, flying the F-16N and F-14. He underwent nuclear power training in January 1995 and served as the executive officer of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower from September 1996 to October 1997.\n\nGallagher commanded the USS Inchon-the world's only mine counter measures command and support ship-from January 1998 to June 1999. From there, he became the third commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis. While on this tour, he piloted the F/A-18 Hornet from his own flight deck, and was proud to become an honorary master chief petty officer.\n\nHe then was promoted to flag rank and assumed duties as the head of Policy with NATO at SACLANT in Norfolk, Virginia from 2001 to 2003. In October of 2003, Gallagher assumed command of Carrier Group 4, which was re-designated Commander, Carrier Strike Force Training Atlantic in October of the following year.\n\nThe Gallaghers then departed to Europe for seven years where he was the U.S. European Command's director of the European Plans and Operations Center, and then remained in Germany to become the EUCOM deputy commander. His last assignment on active duty was in Brussels, Belgium as the U.S. military representative to the NATO Military Committee.\n\nVice Admiral Gallagher has logged more than 4,000 flight hours and 800 carrier landings while operating a number of different fighter aircraft, including the F-4, F-14, F/A-18 and F-16N.\n\nHe has received two Defense Distinguished Service Medals, two Defense Superior Service Medals, four Legions of Merit, two Meritorious Service Medals, two Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals, the NATO Meritorious Service Medal, and numerous other awards.\n\nIn September 2012, Gallagher retired from the Navy after 36 years. He was recently awarded the \"Amicus Wimpina\" medal by the good people of Bad Wimpfen, Germany, signifying their long relationship and mutual respect. He has also participated in two forums on Iran sponsored by the Hinckley Institute of Politics in Salt Lake City and UCLA, dealing with issues regarding the Iran-U.S. relationship, giving his expert opinion on the subject. Gallagher currently volunteers with the National Ability Center of Park City, Utah, helping those with disabilities learn adaptive skills through sports and recreation.\n\n1941-\n\nBill Gehman was born April 2, 1941 in Vermontville, MI. His life has been dedicated to the improvement of aviation not only in Michigan, but also across the nation. His love of aviation was passed on to him from his father who had been a pilot since the late 1930s.\n\nBill received his solo license on his 16th birthday, followed by his private pilot's license on his 17th birthday, and has been flying ever since. He has received his commercial, instrument, and multi-engine ratings, along with a C.F.I. and an airframe and powerplant license.\n\nIn 1965, Bill graduated from Western Michigan University with a degree in aviation engineering. He began his aviation career with Peckham Engineering, an airport engineering firm. In 1963, he married Cynthia Rae Anderson and they went on to have three children: Deborah, Melissa and William Ray.
