        "text": "Olympic volleyball is headed to Paris for the first time.\n\nTwenty-four teams across the men's and women's tournaments will take their turn on the court to compete for the highest place on the podium.\n\nParis is hosting the Olympic Games for the third time, after doing so in 1900 and 1924. However, it will be the city's first time hosting Olympic volleyball tournaments, as volleyball did not become an Olympic sport until 1964.\n\nHere is everything to know about volleyball at the 2024 Olympics in Paris.\n\nWhich volleyball teams will compete at the 2024 Olympics?\n\nHere is the full list of teams participating in the men's and women's Olympic volleyball tournaments this year:\n\nMen's volleyball teams\n\nPool A\n\nFrance\n\nSlovenia\n\nCanada\n\nSerbia\n\nPool B\n\nPoland\n\nItaly\n\nBrazil\n\nEgypt\n\nPool C\n\nJapan\n\nUnited States\n\nArgentina\n\nGermany\n\nWomen's volleyball teams\n\nPool A\n\nFrance\n\nUnited States\n\nChina\n\nSerbia\n\nPool B\n\nBrazil\n\nPoland\n\nJapan\n\nKenya\n\nPool C\n\nItaly\n\nTurkey\n\nNetherlands\n\nDominican Republic\n\nWhere will volleyball be played at the 2024 Olympics?\n\nMatches will take place at the South Paris Arena, which is located nearby the most visited Paris attractions such as the Eiffel Tower, Champ de Mars and Bois de Boulogne.\n\nVolleyball schedule for the 2024 Olympics\n\nVolleyball action in Paris will span almost the full duration of the 2024 Olympics.\n\nThe competition begins on Saturday, July 27, and will conclude on Aug. 11, the same day as the Closing Ceremony.\n\nWhat's new for volleyball at the 2024 Olympics?\n\nOlympic volleyball is getting a fresh serve in 2024.\n\nThe format has been revamped this year with a streamlined format designed to maximize player performance. Gone are the days of relentless matches every two days; teams will now have a more manageable schedule of three pool matches within three groups of four.\n\nThis shift from group five matches to three not only ensures players arrive at the quarterfinals with greater stamina; it also creates a more balanced competition with 12 teams divided equally in the opening stage.\n\nThe top two teams from each pool, along with the two best third-place finishers, will earn quarterfinal spots. From there, it's a single-elimination tournament until an Olympic champion is crowned.\n\nPrevious Olympic volleyball champions\n\nThe United States women's national volleyball team soared to its first ever gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics, beating Brazil in the championship match.\n\nThe men's volleyball competition in Tokyo saw France emerge victorious, snatching the gold medal from the feared Russian team, while Argentina beat volleyball powerhouse Brazil for bronze.\n\nWhich country has won the most Olympic gold medals in volleyball?\n\nAhead of the 2024 Olympics, the Soviet Union still leads the rankings in Olympic volleyball, having won a total of 12 medals from 1964 to 1988. Brazil and the U.S. are tied for second, having won 11 medals each.\n\nWho are the best men's and women's volleyball team in the world?\n\nItaly is the highest-ranked women's national volleyball team worldwide in the International Volleyball Federation's world rankings. The U.S. sits at fifth in the women's rankings heading into the 2024 Olympics."
