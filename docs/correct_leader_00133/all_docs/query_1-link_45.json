        "text": "In the 1998 general elections, the ruling coalition led by the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) was challenged by four opposition parties spanning the political spectrum: the right-wing Slovak Democratic Coalition (SDK), the centre-left Party of Civic Understanding (SOP), the centrist Hungarian Coalition (SMK) and the reformed communist Party of the Democratic Left (SDL). Debate during the campaign which opened on 26 August focused primarily on economic issues and the country’s entry into the European Union and NATO.\n\nShortly before the elections, in May, the Electoral Law was amended in several ways, especially as regards electoral constituencies and the vote threshold needed to gain National Council representation. The polling days were monitored by some 200 observers of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), who declared the voting free and fair. A high turnout gave a clear majority (93 of 150 seats) to the opposition forces although the HZDS of outgoing Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar edged the SDK, led by Mr. Mikulas Dzurinda, to maintain its leading parliamentary position. Since all opposition parties refused to form a new Government with HZDS, the Speaker of Parliament (in the absence of a President of the Republic, the post being vacant since March 1998) invited Mr. Dzurinda to form the new Government; he did so and, on 30 October, became Prime Minister at the head of a four-party (SDK, SDL, SMK, SOP) coalition Cabinet."
