        "text": "VIENNA, 25 November 2011 – The OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, Dunja Mijatović, today expressed concern over the wiretapping of journalists in Slovakia and asked the authorities to ensure a prompt and thorough investigation.\n\nOn 21 November dailies Pravda and Nový Čas claimed that their reporters as well as the head of Slovakia's news television channel TA3 had been wiretapped by the Military Defence Intelligence (VOS).\n\n“Eavesdropping and surreptitious surveillance of journalists endangers media freedom, and is against international standards and OSCE commitments,” said Mijatović.\n\n“I welcome that the highest authorities have condemned these actions and ordered thorough investigations,” Mijatović wrote today in a letter to Foreign Minister Mikuláš Dzurinda. She referred to Prime Minister Iveta Radičová’s public statement that wiretapping of journalists is incompatible with basic principles of democracy and rule of law.\n\nThe Representative requested the authorities to keep her Office informed on the progress of the investigation."
