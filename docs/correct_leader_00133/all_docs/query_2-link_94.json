        "text": "International Taskforce on Ukraine’s Security and Euro-Atlantic Integration outlines a clear path for Ukraine to join NATO and proposes immediate steps to reinforce Ukraine’s security.\n\nThe International Taskforce led by former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak today released a report entitled Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic Future: Paving the path to peace & security.\n\nThe report outlines concrete proposals to immediately reinforce Ukraine’s security, help to contain and then end the war, and bridge Ukraine to its future in NATO. It recommends:\n\nIssuing an invitation at the NATO Summit in Washington D.C. for Ukraine to start accession talks to join the alliance and inviting the NATO-Ukraine Council to define specific conditions for membership.\n\nSetting a clear timeframe for Ukrainian NATO membership of no later than July 2028, provided specific conditions are met.\n\nContaining the war as a first step to ending the war, by strengthening Ukraine and its allies’ efforts to deny Russia’s operational success on land, at sea, and in the air.\n\nLifting all caveats on types of conventional weapons delivered to Ukraine and all caveats on their use against military targets inside Russia.\n\nBringing the web of bilateral security agreements between Ukraine and its partners under the framework of an international compact.\n\nBuilding Ukraine’s future force so that it can reach – before the end of the decade – a size and structure robust enough to defend against a future conventional attack by Russia and positively contribute to NATO’s collective defence plans.\n\nA commitment by NATO Allies to spend the equivalent of 0.25% of their GDP on military assistance to Ukraine.\n\nUnblocking the $300 billion of frozen Russian assets and using them to support Ukraine.\n\nSetting clear reform and governance benchmarks for Ukraine, fully aligned with the EU accession process.\n\nDeveloping a set of assurances on the defensive nature of Ukraine’s future NATO membership.\n\nThe full report is available here – Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic Future: Paving the path to peace & security\n\nSpeaking following the release of the report, former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said:\n\n“Bold action is needed to deliver a Ukrainian victory and a sustainable peace. NATO leaders need to make clear that our support for Ukraine’s security and sovereignty is irreversible. This report sets out clear measures to achieve that through enhanced economic and military support to contain and end Putin’s war. It also recommends NATO leaders open accession talks with Ukraine at the Washington D.C. summit in July. Bringing Ukraine into NATO is the surest path to lasting peace and security in Europe.”\n\nAndriy Yermak, Head of Office to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy added:\n\n“Strong and clear decisions at the NATO Summit in July will be extremely important for the future just peace in Ukraine and the entire Euro-Atlantic region. They will also be a good motivation and strong support for the Ukrainian military and all our citizens,”\n\nReport signatories from the International Task Force on Ukraine’s Security and Euro-Atlantic Integration:\n\nCo-Chairs\n\nHead of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak\n\nFormer Prime Minister of Denmark and Secretary General of NATO Anders Fogh Rasmussen\n\nMembers\n\nFormer President of Lithuania Dalia Grybauskaitė\n\nFormer President of Poland Aleksander Kwaśniewski\n\nFormer Prime Minister of Finland Sanna Marin\n\nFormer Prime Minister of Poland Marek Belka\n\nFormer Prime Minister of Slovakia Mikuláš Dzurinda\n\nFormer Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt\n\nFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\n\nFormer Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Defence of Canada Peter MacKay\n\nFormer Minister of Foreign Affairs, Interior and Defense of France Michèle Alliot-Marie\n\nFormer Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom Lord William Hague\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to NATO Ivo H.
