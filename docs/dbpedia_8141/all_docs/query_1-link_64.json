        "meta_description": "Around the year 1930, as noted by Ronald Schuchard, T. S. Eliot moved beyond the opposition of classicism and romanticism, replacing it with a juxtaposition of orthodoxy and modernism. However, as Eliot’s recently published letters and prose suggest, Eliot created yet another contrariety by using these terms from 1926 onwards to imply the mismatch between his classicism and “modernism.” Indeed, in his correspondence, reports, reviews, commentaries and records of spoken addresses written between 1926 and 1933, the references to modernism – or perhaps just the ways in which he makes use of the term – range from condescending to contemptuous. This paper, in trying to outline Eliot’s wrestling with the term modernism between 1926 and 1933 – a narrative inferred from his side remarks, personal comments and little jibes – shows that to T. S. Eliot classicism was essentially an antidote to modernism. It also tries to demonstrate that, at the time, Eliot used the word modernism, meaning not only modernism in literature but also (predominantly, perhaps) modernist theology.",

        "text": "12In the late 1920s and early 1930s – no matter if in a report, pamphlet, commentary, or a review – when Eliot uses the word modernism, he conflates its meaning with that of sloppiness, confusion, and muddle. In February 1928, in his review of Selected Letters by Baron Friedrich von Hügel, Eliot explains that the confusion in the modernists’ way of thinking does not arise from their effort to bridge the gap between the olden religious emotion and contemporary scientific discoveries, but from their attempt to harmonize “antagonistic currents of feeling within themselves” (Complete Prose 3, 338-339). Such reconciliation – the harmonizing of conflicting pulls and desires – if ever possible (though dangerously bordering on quietism), cannot be attempted at all without an external point of reference. Theological modernism, however, locates the point of reference within the inner circle, in the realm of individual psyche. To Eliot, this is vagueness (which he berated in his letter to Hutchinson). It is modernism being elusive about a clear borderline between the human and the divine, the natural and the supernatural, the atheistic and religious. Its danger is not arriving at the conclusion that there is no God, but concluding that there is a god that looks very much like oneself. Thus theological modernism evades the specifically Eliotean either/or. It is notable that Eliot is not worried by his friends being atheist but by their becoming heretics. He expresses this sentiment in a letter to Richard Aldington (of February 24, 1927), regarding Leonard Woolf and J. M. Robertson as standing in contrast against Bertrand Russell and Murry, and stating that – “for the sake of Faith” – honest atheism is ever welcome as a rational critique (Letters 3, 424).\n\n14After his journalism had taken a decisively social and political turn, in the talk delivered in 1933 on the “Opening of the Anglo-Catholic Summer School of Sociology,” Eliot made a note of the modernist attitude as manifested in politics. However, in political practice, Eliot finds the qualities of modernism – such as its openness to historical relativism, the opposite of an uncompromising support of an absolute principle – justifiable. In the address printed as “Catholicism and International Order” (hardly a eulogy), Eliot mentions the League of Nations as the effect of the romantic, even sentimental, Rousseauism. But he tolerates what he calls the League’s “Modernism in the political field” (P4, 538) more easily than modernism in religion, or modernism underlying literary sensibility. Indeed, Eliot’s reference to the modernism of the League of Nations, when the aesthetic modernist movement was at its height, can serve as a denouement of this brief delineation of Eliot’s use of the term.\n\n15But Eliot’s wrestling with the meanings of the word, as recorded in his letters, spoken addresses and reviews, seems to have reached its height, or perhaps the nadir of his exasperation, in the letter (of Sept. 9, 1930) sent by Eliot as editor of the Criterion to Brian Coffey, then a young poet. In the letter Eliot asks Coffey whether, per chance, he knows “what the word Modernist means,” admitting, rather laconically, even flippantly, his own puzzlement on the matter (Letters 5, 313). Coffey’s answer to this question is formed very much along Eliotean lines: “that which is obviously the product of its particular age” (Letters 5, 313n1). On the force of this reply, then, the modernist is the opposite of the classicist. It is what is valid in its contemporary setting, whereas the classicist is what is perennial. The classicist – the opposite of the modernist in the same measure as of the romantic – is what is permanent. In Eliot’s thought, initially, it indicates an external authority beyond the mutable self, to be replaced around 1926-27 by a reference to an eternal power beyond the changing world."
