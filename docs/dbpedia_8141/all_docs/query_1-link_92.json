He was part of the modernist movement which included James Joyce, T.S. Eliot, Robert Frost, H.D., William Carlos Williams and numerous others. The modernists were interested in experimental literary forms that differed from the previous generation of poets. Pound was also an essayist, editor, critic and translator.\n\nThe Cantos is a series of 120 poems which are considered to be Poundâs epic masterpiece. These poems combine ancient and modern history with Poundâs own experience. They touch on themes like culture and economics. The Chinese language and several European languages are used in parts of The Cantos. The multiple languages, along with a wide number of themes and cultural references make this poem extremely wide in scope.\n\nThis collection comes from St. Elizabethâs Hospital for the Criminally Insane, where Pound stayed from 1946-1958\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nThe Ezra Pound Papers, The Cantos contains two books, letters and manuscripts which are typescripts, photocopies and/or carbon copies. Additionally, there is a fragment of a typed outline of Cantos LII-LXXI."
