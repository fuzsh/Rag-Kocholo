        "text": "Two points from Eliot's literary criticism\n\nIn the essay \"Tradition and the Individual Talent\" Eliot says that poetry involves an extinction of the personality of the author, justifying the use of an inscrutable persona. Much of Eliot's poetry \"hides\" the personality of the author in dramatic monologue (see Robert Browning handout), and his claim also echoes Keats's idea of \"negative capability.\" Eliot's \"removal\" of the poet from the poetry parallels the \"disappearance of the author\" in modern fiction. (Consider \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" in this light of its being a dramatic monologue.)\n\nIn an essay on Hamlet , regarding the \"objective correlative,\" Eliot implies that the work in its objective existence called for a collaborative effort which would be different for different readers so that it would suggest no agreed story or interpretation; its relationship to what went on in the poet's mind is impenetrably obscure and irrelevant. Eliot suggests that each text has meaning only as it is constructed in the mind of the reader.\n\nThe poetry\n\nNo apparent internal logicno transitions or logical sequencing as we're accustomed to find in poetry\n\nThe poetry is more subtle, more suggestivethemes are not stated, thereby requiring the reader's participation in the construction of \"meaning\"\n\nEliot's poetry typically blends the modern and contemporary with the traditional, particularly in allusions to the culture and literature of an eclectic array of historical periods and places\n\nThe poetry we're reading takes us \"inside the poetic mind,\" in a sense, just as Joyce's Ulysses takes us into the \"prosaic\" mind. The poetic mind, perhaps naturally, is less directly comprehensible, and it is often difficult to see the seams of thought or the paths of particular associationsor the reasons for them. Eliot works mainly by presenting a series of images and/or symbols which are often not organized in the linear and logical order we find in most pre-modernist literature. For the patient, willing, and open-minded reader, Eliot's poetry \"works\" when the reader lets go of traditional expectations about poetry and allows the various images collect or deliver meaning as a sort of modern-art \"collage\" or aggregation of images, symbols, and subtle suggestions and allusions.\n\nOn The Waste Land\n\nEliot wrote the poem in a period of personal despair: problems with wife, parents, and work. Mostly written\n\nduring a period of treatment for deep depression.\n\nThe poem's finished state owes much to the editorial advice of Ezra Pound, a leading American modernist poet, who convinced Eliot to cut the poem's length nearly in half.\n\nEliot called his \"explanatory\" footnotes \"a remarkable exposition of bogus scholarship,\" and said they were written to pad out original text. He joked that the notes experienced \"almost a greater popularity than the poem itself.\"\n\nThe primary motif in the poem is dryness and barrenness. The complicated interplay of the present with traditional myths of fertility from the past work together to imply the barrenness of modern life. Sex is unsatisfying and leads to abortion, there is no new life in the desert of modern life, no fertile growth.\n\nThe fruitful, rich past appears to beckon into the barren present, and in image, myth, and allusion, \"The past fades into the present, and the present fades into the past.\""
