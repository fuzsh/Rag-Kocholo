        "text": "T.S Eliot was a poet, essayist, publisher, playwright, literary critic and editor. He is considered one of the 20th century's major poets, he is a central figure in English-language Modernist poetry.\n\nEliot first attracted widespread spotlight for his poem \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" in 1915, which, at the time of its publication, was considered outlandish.\n\nThe opening lines of the poem are now famous, comparing the evening sky to \"a patient etherised upon a table\", were considered shocking and offensive, especially at a time when Georgian Poetry was hailed for its inceptions of the nineteenth century Romantic Poets.\n\nThe poem waste-land is known for its\n\nvague nature—its slippage between irony and prophecy; its abrupt differences in speaker, location, and time.\n\nThis structural complexness is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of modern literature, a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, James Joyce's Ulysses.\n\nAsh-Wednesday is the first long poem written by Eliot, after his 1927 transformation to Anglicanism. Published in 1930, it deals with the battle that occurs when a person who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes pertained to as Eliot's \"conversion poem\", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human salvation.\n\nOne cannot deny that his experiments in diction, style, and versification resurrected English poetry, and in a series of critical essays, he broke down old orthodoxies and built new ones."
