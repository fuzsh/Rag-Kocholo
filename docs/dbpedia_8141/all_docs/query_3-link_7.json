Eliot's modernist poetry explores themes of alienation, decay, and psychological malaise in the modern world. His works portray a society lacking in culture, faith, and morality. Characters struggle with fragmented identities and inability to form relationships with themselves or others. Eliot viewed modern life as insecure and unstable, which he conveyed through experimental poetic forms. His works depict the psychological toll of modernity and individuals' search for meaning in a disillusioned world.",
