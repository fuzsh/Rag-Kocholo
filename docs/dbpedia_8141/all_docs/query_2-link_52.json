        "text": "T.S. Eliot, whose full name is Thomas Stearns Eliot, was an American-British poet, essayist, publisher, playwright, literary critic, and editor. He is considered to be one of the greatest poets of the 20th century and a central figure in English-language Modernist poetry. Eliot was a daunting intellectual who, many believe, wasn’t fascinated by the romantic ideals of life. He believed in seeing the perversion and subversion as they were – London Bridge is falling down – and also recording the same in his verse. An acclaimed poet, playwright and literary critic of repute, Eliot’s life was full of achievements any literary personality dreams of.
