This is the Ultimate TS Eliot Cheatsheet to help you prepare for and ace your exams.\n\nTable of contents:\n\nWhat is Mod B: The Critical Study of Literature\n\nKey contextual points\n\nThemes for all poems\n\nCommon TS Eliot techniques\n\nWant to see an exemplar TS Eliot essay?\n\nWhat is Mod B: The Critical Study of Literature\n\nMod B requires you to closely examine your texts and evaluate its textual integrity and significance.\n\nThis means that you determine whether or not the text has a unity of form and ideas and whether the values and themes are still relevant today.\n\nIn our Year 12 Module B: The Critical Study of Literature Guide, we go through this in detail. Read this guide to see the breakdown of each syllabus dot-point in detail.\n\nThis is the list of TS Eliot poems that you are required to study for Mod B:\n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\n\nPreludes\n\nRhapsody on a Windy Night\n\nThe Hollow Men\n\nJourney of the Magi\n\nKey contextual points\n\nUnderstanding TS Eliot’s context will help you unpack his poetry and understand the purpose of his poems.\n\nHaving a strong understanding of Eliot’s context will also help you decide a text’s canonical status. If you need a refresher of canonical statuses, read our HSC English Study Guide: TS Eliot Part 1.\n\nModernism\n\nTS Eliot is one of the most renowned Modernist poets.\n\nModernism is a movement that arose during the 1800s and became popular after World War I. Modernists explored the individual mind and criticised rules, tradition and routines.\n\nThey broke out of traditional rules, and conventions, and were experimental. Modernist artists also found new ways to explore identity.\n\nSecularity\n\nDuring Eliot’s time, the world was becoming increasingly secular. This means that people were rejecting religion for various reasons (eg. religion restricts and controls human feelings and actions).\n\nThere was also an increased understanding of individual psyches and psychoanalysis. People were beginning to understand psychic struggles, especially with the trauma of WWI.\n\nEven Eliot himself struggled to find the right faith. It wasn’t until after the 1920s that he converted to Anglo-Catholicism. We can see this change in his poems.\n\nTechnology\n\nThe Second Industrial Revolution occurred during the mid-1800s – 1900s.\n\nFactories began to use more efficient technology to mass-produce goods. There was a focus on productivity and capitalist ideals. And, people were expected to work long hours to earn money.\n\nEliot was highly critical of this lifeless routine.\n\nStill struggling with Eliot during this shutdown?\n\nOur Matrix English Advanced Module B Course for TS Eliot will give you an in-depth understanding of the text. You will learn from expert English teachers, have access to extensive resources and improve with in-depth feedback. Learn more.\n\nThemes for all poems\n\nYou need to explore the themes to analyse whether or not a text has canonical status. If a theme is universal, then it will be universally relevant.\n\nLet’s take a look at Eliot’s commonly explored themes.\n\n[Note: You may find that not all poems are analysed under every theme. This is because the theme isn’t as strongly explored as the others.]\n\nTime\n\nEliot explores the subjectivity of time and how our actions are shaped by our perception of it.\n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock: “There will be time, there will be time / To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet; / There will be time to murder and create,”\n\nThe repetition of “there will be a time” highlights Prufrock’s perception that time is neverending; a detrimental thought as life is finite.\n\nPreludes: “With the other masquerades / That time resumes,“\n\nEliot parallels time with a “masquerade”, criticising how humans shape their lives around an illusion; the clock.\n\nRhapsody on a Windy Night: “The moon has lost her memory.”\n\nEliot explores how memory [and everything else] will decay over time as though they have a life of their own. Death is inevitable.\n\nThe Hollow Men: “Life is very long / Between the desire / And the spasm / Between the potency / And the existence”\n\nThe men are stuck in the place between death and the after-life. Time seems to go on infinitely in a state of desolation and despair.\n\nDesire\n\nEliot explores how the modern world causes individuals to lose sight of their desires as they are so caught up in their monotonous routines.\n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock: “I do not think that they will sing to me…. We have lingered in the chambers of the sea / By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown / Till human voices wake us, and we drown.”\n\nThese lines allude to The Odyssey; the sirens sing to Odysseus because he’s a hero. However, the persona is not a hero because he has no real ambitions and therefore has not achieved anything worthwhile.\n\nPreludes: “You tossed a blanket from the bed, / You lay upon your back, and waited; / You dozed, and watched the night revealing“\n\nThe monotonous lines highlight how individuals are simply completing activities because it has become a part of their routine. They have no real desire for anything.\n\nRhapsody on a Windy Night: “The last twist of the knife”\n\nThis is a bleak ending to the poem. It highlights how there is no real hope or desire left in a lonely world… only impending death.\n\nThe Hollow Men: “The eyes reappear / As the perpetual star… The hope only / Of empty men.”\n\nThe metaphor of the eyes being the perpetual star represents how the “eye”s are the men’s last salvation and hope in this desolate place.\n\nJourney of the Magi: “Just the worst time of the year / For a journey, and such a long journey”\n\nThe Magi are searching for a sense of comfort and spiritual answer in Jesus and God… It is a long and painful journey.\n\nFaith / Religion\n\nEliot’s world was becoming more secular. So, people began to question their religion and faiths, including Eliot.\n\nPreludes: “His soul stretched tight across the skies / That fade behind a city block,”\n\nEliot refers to God being omniscient and omnipresent.\n\nThe Hollow Men: ” Here the stone images / Are raised, here they receive / The supplication of a dead man’s hand”\n\nThe stone images allude to the passage in the bible where the Israelites were punished by God because they began to worship the false Gods instead.\n\nJourney of the Magi: “… this Birth was / Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.”\n\nThe Magi is questioning their religion. He likens Jesus’ birth to agony and death, as opposed to the supposed enlightenment.\n\nLoneliness / Isolation\n\nEliot believed that individuals are more isolated and lonely in the modern world because of the onerous social and labour demands. Think about the modernism movement.\n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock: “In the room the women come and go / Talking of Michelangelo.”\n\nEliot highlights how people are always coming and going in the modern world. No one stays for long.\n\nPreludes: “And newspapers from vacant lots; / The showers beat / On broken blinds and chimney-pots,“\n\nEliot describes a desolate waste-city. With the increasing financial, social and mental burden of the modern world, no one has time to look after anything or anyone anymore.\n\nRhapsody on a Windy Night: “Every street lamp that I pass / Beats like a fatalistic drum,”\n\nThe streetlamps are not beating. It is the persona’s heartbeat. As such, this highlights how the persona is so lonely, he can hear his own heartbeat and mistakes it for company.\n\nThe Hollow Men: “In this last of meeting places / We grope together / And avoid speech / Gathered on this beach of the tumid river”\n\nThe men are together physically together, but they are mentally isolated from one another. They “avoid speech”, so they can never connect.\n\nJourney of the Magi: “With an alien people clutching their gods.”\n\nThe Magus believes that his previous religious peers are now “aliens” because he is questioning his faith. He is alone.\n\nMental Psyche\n\nThere was an increased understanding of psychoanalysis. So, Eliot explores the search for identity and the mental struggles of living in the modern world (especially after WWI) and the struggle to find one’s identity.\n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock: “No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;\n\nAm an attendant lord, one that will do”\n\nHamlet is known for his mental inner conflicts. By comparing the persona to Hamlet, Eliot is highlighting the persona’s existential questions.\n\nPreludes: “The thousand sordid images / Of which your soul was constituted; / They flickered against the ceiling.”\n\nEliot highlights how individuals’ souls are suffering from their own thoughts and memories… which worsens because of their loneliness.\n\nRhapsody on a Windy Night: “A broken sprig… rust that clings to the form”\n\nThe sprig represents the persona’s mind, and the rust symbolises the decaying of the mind\n\nThe Hollow Men: “We are the hollow men / We are the stuffed men”\n\nThese men are empty and have no feelings or identity. They have lost themselves in the modern world.\n\nJourney of the Magi: “I should be glad of another death”\n\nThe Magus seems to desire another “death” because he is now suffering from the realisation that his religion isn’t what he thought it was.\n\nCommon TS Eliot techniques\n\nYou can evaluate the significance of Eliot’s poems by analysing the techniques. These techniques reveal themes and underlying messages of the poem.\n\nSo, let’s examine Eliot’s most commonly used techniques in his poetry.\n\nMetaphor\n\nMetaphor is when one thing is said to be another thing.\n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock: “I have measured out my life with coffee spoons”\n\nThis highlights Prufrock’s obsession controlling his life… even if it turns out futile.\n\nPreludes: “The burnt-out ends of smoky days”\n\nThe end of a day is compared to the burning of a cigarette butt.\n\nRhapsody on a Windy Night: “Dissolve the floors of memory”\n\nMemory is being likened to dissolvable floors. This highlights the vulnerability of memory and how easy it is to forget things.\n\nThe Hollow Men: “We are the hollow men, / We are the stuffed men”\n\nThe men are likened to scarecrows. They have no emotions or real identity.\n\nThe Journey of the Magi:\n\nThe whole poem is an extended metaphor for the 3-wise men’s journey from the Bible.\n\nPersonification\n\nWhen an inanimate object is given human qualities.\n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock: “The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes”\n\nEliot gives the yellow fog cat-like qualities. This enhances the visual imagery of the smoke being alive and over-taking the city-life. The smoke is also symbolic of Prufrock’s desire to be loved. See Motif.\n\nPreludes: “You had such a vision of the street / As the street hardly understands;”\n\nThis further emphasises how lonely individuals are in the modern world… to the extent that the streets can hardly understand them\n\nRhapsody on a Windy Night: “The street lamp said, “Regard that woman / Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door”\n\nThe street lamp forces the persona to view different perspectives. This highlights how lonely the persona is… he only has streetlamps and the moon to provide him company.\n\nThe Journey of the Magi: “The cities hostile and the towns unfriendly”\n\nThe cities are personified to show their hostility towards the magi.\n\nAllusion (literary, historical and religious)\n\nAllusions are references to literature, historical events or religious texts.\n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock: “No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;“\n\nThis literary allusion is ironic because the audience are able to clearly draw similarities between Prufrock and Hamlet’s self-consciousness and existential questions.\n\nPreludes: “His soul stretched tight across the skies”\n\nThis is a religious allusion to God himself, being omniscient and omnipresent.\n\nThe Hollow Men: “For Thine is the Kingdom”\n\nThis is an allusion to the Bible. This particular line references the belief in redemption and the birth of Jesus.\n\nThe Journey of the Magi\n\nThe whole poem alludes to the 3-wise men from the Bible. It tells the story from a less common perspective. In addition, it begins with the opening of Lancelot Andrewes Christmas sermon to James I and his family from 1622.\n\nMotif\n\nA motif is an image or idea that consistently reoccurs throughout the text.\n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock: “yellow smoke” / “yellow fog”\n\nThe yellow smoke appears consistently throughout the poem. It can also represent Prufrock’s desire to be loved or wanted. As such, when it nozzles at the windows, it is illustrating how Prufrock fails to take any real action to make connections.\n\nPreludes: Time eg. “Six o’clock”, “At four and five and six o’clock”\n\nTime represents the rigid routines and structure of the modern world.\n\nRhapsody on a Windy Night: The lamp and moon\n\nThe streetlamp and the moon provide the only source of light in the persona’s life. In other terms, he is so lonely, that these 2 inanimate objects are his only source of solitude.\n\nThe Hollow Men: Dry eg. “As wind in dry grass”, “In our dry cellar”, “This is the dead land/This is the cactus land.”\n\nThe dry land represents lost faith, as it has lost all water. Water is symbolic of hope and faith.\n\nThe Journey of the Magi: Cold winter\n\nThe cold winter is a motif used to represent hardship.\n\nFirst-person/unreliable narration\n\nEliot explores inner conflicts and mental deterioration. As such, his narration is often unreliable, as we don’t actually know what is truly happening. We only understand what the persona believes and thinks.\n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock:\n\nPrufrock is written in 1st-person language as a stream of consciousness. Eliot shifts from one idea to the next without any common associative link or thought.\n\nPreludes:\n\nPreludes is written in 1st person language by an omniscient voice. Eliot also uses second-person language (“you”) in this poetry too.\n\nRhapsody on a Windy Night:\n\nThis poem is written in both 1st and 2nd person language. The narration is quite unreliable because they are unstable and alone in their own thoughts. This is especially shown through the rhythm and musicality.\n\nThe Hollow Men:\n\nThe Hollow Men is written in 1st person language in a very experimental free-verse style. This highlights the instability of the mind.\n\nThe Journey of the Magi:\n\nThe poem is written in 1st person language. This creates a more personal journey.\n\nEpigraph\n\nA short quotation, usually used at the beginning of a text to suggest the theme.\n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock: “S’io credesse che mia risposta fosse / A persona che mai tornasse al mondo, / Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse. / Ma percioche giammai di questo Fondo / Non torno vivo alcun, s’i’odo il vero, / Senza tema d’infamia ti rispondo.”\n\nThis is quoted by the character Guido in Dante’s Inferno. Guido shares his insecurities and sins to Dante. This epigraph draws parallels between Prufrock and Guido’s; both are sharing their deepest insecurities.\n\nThe Hollow Men: “Mistah Kurtz-he dead / A penny for the Old Guy”,\n\nEliot refers to Guy Fawkes and the novel Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad.\n\nThe Journey of the Magi: “A cold coming we had of it, / Just the worst time of the year / For a journey, and such a long journey: / The ways deep and the weather sharp, / The very dead of winter.”\n\nWhile this is not strictly an epigraph because Eliot doesn’t quote Bishop Lancelot Andrewes’ Sermon word-by-word, he did adapt it into the poem. As such, Eliot is reaffirming his search for faith and the hardships that follow.\n\nMusicality / Rhythm\n\nMusicality refers to the stressed and unstressed syllables in poetry. It is similar to a music bar.\n\nFor example, JOUR-ney. “JOUR” is the stressed syllable, whereas, “ney” is the unstressed syllable.\n\nRhythm refers to the pace and beat of your poem.\n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock:\n\nEliot writes in a stream of consciousness in this poem. There is no regular rhythm. Instead, the pace quickens and slows down depending on Prufrock’s thoughts. For example, his repetition of the extended metaphor of the cat (“yellow fog”) throughout the poem enhances the musicality of the poem and feelings of anxiety.\n\nRhapsody on a Windy Night\n\nThis poem has a very irregular rhythm and musicality. This is representative of an unstable mind as the persona is slowly losing their memory and thoughts. As such, the poem creates high tension and anxiety.\n\nThe Hollow Men:\n\nEach section of The Hollow Men has a different rhythm. It starts off repetitive and dry and becomes much more intense and mechanised. The last section (Section V) is especially different from the other Sections as it is very, very repetitive. The beginning of each line alternates from “Between the…” to “And the…”. They also end with “Falls the Shadows”. The final stanza repeats “This is the way the world ends” 3 times. This highly repetitive section creates an autonomous and intense feeling."
