        "text": "Writer Virginia Woolf stated that human nature underwent a fundamental change 'on or about December 1910.'\n\nUnderstanding the context of literary modernism (specifically, modernist poetry) is important. What prompted such a “fundamental change” in human nature? The rise of cities; profound technological changes in transportation, architecture, and engineering; a rising population that engendered crowds and chaos in public spaces; factory life; and the aftermath of WWI. These influential factors contributed to making individuals feel less unique and more alienated, fragmented, and at a loss in their daily lives and larger worlds.\n\nIndeed, the speaker of modernist poems characteristically wrestles with the fundamental question of “self,” often feeling fragmented and alienated from the world around him. In other words, a coherent speaker with a clear sense of himself/herself is hard to find in modernist poetry, often leaving readers confused and “lost.”\n\nSuch ontological feelings of fragmentation and alienation, which often led to a more pessimistic and bleak outlook on life as manifested in representative modernist poems such as T.S. Eliot’s “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” (1917), were prompted by fundamental and far-reaching historical, social, cultural, and economic changes in the early 1900s. These changes transformed the world from one that seemed ordered and stable to one that felt futile and chaotic.\n\nFor many, high modernism is perhaps best characterized by the emergence of a new kind of poetry. The battle cry of the modernists—\"make it new\"—is reflected in the experimental, difficult, highly allusive nature of much of the poetry written during this time.\n\nProbably the easiest truism to make about the poetry of the early twentieth century, a time known by the name Modernism, is that it was boldly experimental. It was more experimental with regard to form and subject than poetry had been in any period in its English-language history. (The only time to rival it occurred in the late middle ages, when syllabic, alliterative verse gave way to meter and rhyme.) In the Modernist period, long-standing conventions of meter and rhyme were swept away, with nothing as definite as syllable or meter to determine the length of a line, and no definite pattern of sound. One of the most prominent and influential poets of the era, the American Ezra Pound, stated at one point that it was his task to “break the back of the iamb”—which, as you learned several weeks to, had been the most prominent feature of poetry since the time of Chaucer.\n\nPound and the Modernists had great success in freeing poetry from the straitjacket of meter. Although traditional forms and meters did not disappear, they no longer dominated poetry. It was a time when it seemed that almost anything was possible. Poems varied from the astonishingly simple verse written by William Carlos Williams, H.D., and Amy Lowell, to the highly allusive, imbricated verse of Pound and T.S. Eliot.\n\nIf twentieth- and twenty-first-century students in the English speaking world are quick to take the stand that a poem means whatever the reader thinks it means (a statement that would not have occurred to a living soul between Adam and about 1920), we probably have the Modernists to thank for it. Although there’s no evidence I know of to suggest that Modernists anticipated that state of affairs in which readers confronted with the difficulty of the text simply gave up and declared “It means whatever I want it to mean,”they perhaps unwittingly invited their readers to do so. The fact is that much of this poetry assumes a reader as adept in poetry and, in fact, in all of literature as the authors were themselves—and sometimes adept in other things as well (Ezra Pound now and then included Chinese characters in his poems even though he did not read or speak Chinese). Modernists often expected their readers to do the necessary research, to struggle through and find out what their writing was all about. (James Joyce, a writer of fiction, once suggested that to understand his work, a reader would have to devote his entire life to studying it.) These works do not imply the knowledge base or reading sophistication of the average 18-year old. And much of this poetry is too open or too associative in its logic to be easily restricted to any single, monolithic understanding.\n\nMuch of the literature of the time manifests a desire not to give up on reading but to change the way that we read. If you try to read Eliot’s poetry in the same way that you read Beowulf, Paradise Lost or Lyrical Ballads you will be frustrated. The hierarchy of value has been broken. In that hierarchy allusions support—are subject to—a singular, central meaning. In Modernist poetry, the element of meaning, while still absolutely present, is no longer king; it is limited, but no longer necessarily singular.\n\nIn fact, Modernist poetry takes advantage of an aspect of language which poetry would seem to have a natural affinity for: even the simplest, easiest-to-understand utterance is potentially infinite in its meaning—or in its ability to create and become involved with meaning. There’s nothing radical about that claim. For a word to be transferable from any one context to any other context it must be infinitely transferable. Most often actual uses of language—me talking to you, me writing this lecture to you, you talking on the phone to your mother, Shakespeare performing the ghost of Hamlet’s father—work very hard to limit the ways that the words can be taken. But this does not affect the fact that language is in itself illimitable. It is like liquid which must be precisely held in a solid container or it goes everywhere. The container will give it measurable shape. In itself it has no shape but will conform for the moment to whatever shape it finds itself in. Modernist poetry still gives language shape, but it tends to give it a looser shape, shapes that let more of its inherently shapelessness appear.\n\nThat’s not to say that all twentieth-century poetry or even all Modernist poetry is this way. In addition to Williams and Eliot and Pound, there is Robert Frost, and Elizabeth Bishop, and Edna St. Vincent Millay, and William Butler Yeats—and of course many many others—who work in traditional forms. Eliot himself often rhymes, often writes in iambic pentameter. So does Williams and sometimes even Pound. There’s a lot of experiment going on in Modernist poetry; it involves every aspect of language. Early twentieth-century poetry is characterized more by this experimentation than by its frequent lack of meter or rhyme.\n\nWhile not every poet of the mid- to late-twentieth century took Whitman as the model, the poetry of this Postmodern era generally became simpler, easier to read, while it retained the poetic movement away from traditional forms dominated by rhyme and meter. Indeed, during the sixties and seventies it would have been difficult to find a newly published poem that rhymed. At present poetry is doing nothing more profoundly than trying to figure out why it exists in a world in which more and more poetry is published by smaller and smaller presses for fewer and fewer readers, most of them academics, poets, or students. Poetry still has occasional high-profile moments, such as when Maya Angelou read a poem at Bill Clinton’s second inaugural, or when a celebration of poetry was abruptly cancelled at the White House for fear the invited poets would use the platform to protest America’s invasion of Iraq. But at present poetry in the English-speaking world, leads a mostly underground life. It is still everywhere, most people, most of the time, manage to ignore it.\n\nThere were those, like Wallace Stevens, who said that poetry did not need to have a meaning. But that’s not the same as saying that poetry means whatever you want it to.\n\nRemixed from:\n\n“Indroduction to Modernist Poety.” Edisitement. 2022. https://edsitement.neh.gov/curricula/introduction-modernist-poetry CC BY 4.0.\n\nLindsay, Alan & Candance Bergstrom. “Introduction to Poetry.” Public Consulting Media. 2019. https://www.publiconsulting.com/wordpress/introtopoetry/ CC BY 4.0.\n\nSawler, Trevor. “Modernist Poety.” The Modernist Web. 2022. http://www.modernistweb.com/page/Copyright CC BYNC ND.\n\nMODERNIST POEMS\n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\n\nby TS Eliot\n\nS’io credesse che mia risposta fosse\n\nA persona che mai tornasse al mondo,\n\nQuesta fiamma staria senza piu scosse.\n\nMa perciocche giammai di questo fondo\n\nNon torno vivo alcun, s’i’odo il vero,\n\nSenza tema d’infamia ti rispondo.\n\nLet us go then, you and I,\n\nWhen the evening is spread out against the sky\n\nLike a patient etherized upon a table;\n\nLet us go, through certain half-deserted streets,\n\nThe muttering retreats\n\nOf restless nights in one-night cheap hotels\n\nAnd sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:\n\nStreets that follow like a tedious argument\n\nOf insidious intent\n\nTo lead you to an overwhelming question ...\n\nOh, do not ask, “What is it?”\n\nLet us go and make our visit.\n\nIn the room the women come and go\n\nTalking of Michelangelo.\n\nThe yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,\n\nThe yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,\n\nLicked its tongue into the corners of the evening,\n\nLingered upon the pools that stand in drains,\n\nLet fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,\n\nSlipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,\n\nAnd seeing that it was a soft October night,\n\nCurled once about the house, and fell asleep.\n\nAnd indeed there will be time\n\nFor the yellow smoke that slides along the street,\n\nRubbing its back upon the window-panes;\n\nThere will be time, there will be time\n\nTo prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;\n\nThere will be time to murder and create,\n\nAnd time for all the works and days of hands\n\nThat lift and drop a question on your plate;\n\nTime for you and time for me,\n\nAnd time yet for a hundred indecisions,\n\nAnd for a hundred visions and revisions,\n\nBefore the taking of a toast and tea.\n\nIn the room the women come and go\n\nTalking of Michelangelo.\n\nAnd indeed there will be time\n\nTo wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”\n\nTime to turn back and descend the stair,\n\nWith a bald spot in the middle of my hair—\n\n(They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”)\n\nMy morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,\n\nMy necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin—\n\n(They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”)\n\nDo I dare\n\nDisturb the universe?\n\nIn a minute there is time\n\nFor decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.\n\nFor I have known them all already, known them all:\n\nHave known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,\n\nI have measured out my life with coffee spoons;\n\nI know the voices dying with a dying fall\n\nBeneath the music from a farther room.\n\nSo how should I presume?\n\nAnd I have known the eyes already, known them all—\n\nThe eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,\n\nAnd when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,\n\nWhen I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,\n\nThen how should I begin\n\nTo spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?\n\nAnd how should I presume?\n\nAnd I have known the arms already, known them all—\n\nArms that are braceleted and white and bare\n\n(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)\n\nIs it perfume from a dress\n\nThat makes me so digress?\n\nArms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.\n\nAnd should I then presume?\n\nAnd how should I begin?\n\nShall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets\n\nAnd watched the smoke that rises from the pipes\n\nOf lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...\n\nI should have been a pair of ragged claws\n\nScuttling across the floors of silent seas.\n\nAnd the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!\n\nSmoothed by long fingers,\n\nAsleep ... tired ... or it malingers,\n\nStretched on the floor, here beside you and me.\n\nShould I, after tea and cakes and ices,\n\nHave the strength to force the moment to its crisis?\n\nBut though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,\n\nThough I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,\n\nI am no prophet—and here’s no great matter;\n\nI have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\n\nAnd I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,\n\nAnd in short, I was afraid.\n\nAnd would it have been worth it, after all,\n\nAfter the cups, the marmalade, the tea,\n\nAmong the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,\n\nWould it have been worth while,\n\nTo have bitten off the matter with a smile,\n\nTo have squeezed the universe into a ball\n\nTo roll it toward some overwhelming question,\n\nTo say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead,\n\nCome back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”—\n\nIf one, settling a pillow by her head,\n\nShould say: “That is not what I meant at all;\n\nThat is not it, at all.”\n\nAnd would it have been worth it, after all,\n\nWould it have been worth while,\n\nAfter the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,\n\nAfter the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the\n\nfloor—\n\nAnd this, and so much more?—\n\nIt is impossible to say just what I mean!\n\nBut as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:\n\nWould it have been worth while\n\nIf one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,\n\nAnd turning toward the window, should say:\n\n“That is not it at all,\n\nThat is not what I meant, at all.”\n\nNo! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;\n\nAm an attendant lord, one that will do\n\nTo swell a progress, start a scene or two,\n\nAdvise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,\n\nDeferential, glad to be of use,\n\nPolitic, cautious, and meticulous;\n\nFull of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;\n\nAt times, indeed, almost ridiculous—\n\nAlmost, at times, the Fool.\n\nI grow old ... I grow old ...\n\nI shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\n\nShall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?\n\nI shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.\n\nI have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.\n\nI do not think that they will sing to me.\n\nI have seen them riding seaward on the waves\n\nCombing the white hair of the waves blown back\n\nWhen the wind blows the water white and black.\n\nWe have lingered in the chambers of the sea\n\nBy sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown\n\nTill human voices wake us, and we drown.\n\nRemixed from:\n\nEloit, T.S.(1998) Prufrock and Other Observations.
