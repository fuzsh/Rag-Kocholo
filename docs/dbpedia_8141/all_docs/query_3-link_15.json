        "text": "I’ve been experimenting with several of the AI platforms, attempting to learn all that I can about how the systems work and how to produce the best images from the prompts that I provide. My favorite platform is Midjourney, which is what I used to create the images for this poem. It’s a relatively straight-forward process over all, but there is a bit of learning when it comes to some of the finer aspects of telling AI exactly what it is that you want. Whether then AI can actually provide you with your desired results is another issue altogether, as I’ve discovered first-hand over the past week.\n\nI haven’t officially made an announcement yet, but you can buy my AI work in the form of prints and merchandise at my new AI store front. It’s a separate enterprise from my normal artistic pursuits but I felt that I didn’t want to get left behind when this technology really takes off. . .which will probably happen tomorrow! That may seem like an exaggeration, but anyone using AI to create art will tell you that ‘tomorrow’ could be any day now. Do check out my prints though and do let me know if there’s anything that a(I) can create for you.\n\nMy Favorite Poem\n\nWhich brings me to The Hollow Men, by T.S. Eliot, my favorite poem. I thought what better way to put Midjourney’s AI to the test? Surely, not even artificial intelligence can handle all of Eliot’s lines in a cohesive manner. I found this to be true. But in some cases, the visuals came pretty close to matching a visual interpretation of the lines. I’ll let you be the judge though.\n\nFor each of the images below, the corresponding lines from the poem were fed into the bot a prompts, exactly as written, no other commands given except to make the images all in a 3:2 ratio. Other than that, you’re seeing only the results from Eliot’s own words.\n\nI’ve also created a YouTube version here. You can watch it at the end of the post as well.\n\nT.S. Eliot's poem \"The Hollow Men\" is a haunting meditation on the human condition. The poem is a complex and dense work that explores themes of emptiness, despair, and spiritual emptiness. Eliot wrote the poem in the aftermath of World War I, a time of great social and cultural upheaval, and it reflects the disillusionment and despair that many felt at the time.\n\nThe poem opens with the lines \"We are the hollow men / We are the stuffed men,\" a paradoxical statement that sets the tone for the rest of the work. The \"hollow men\" are empty and devoid of substance, while the \"stuffed men\" are bloated with meaningless material possessions. Eliot's use of paradox and irony throughout the poem serves to underscore the emptiness and futility of the human condition.\n\nThe hollow men are described as \"shape without form, shade without colour,\" indicating their lack of identity and individuality. They are \"quiet and meaningless,\" existing in a state of apathy and resignation. The poem also features several allusions to Dante's Inferno, with references to the \"twilight kingdom\" and the \"dead land.\" These allusions serve to reinforce the sense of spiritual emptiness and despair that permeates the poem.\n\nOne of the most famous lines from the poem is \"This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper.\" This line captures the sense of quiet resignation and acceptance of the emptiness and futility of life that pervades the poem. The poem ends with a repetition of the phrase \"This is the way the world ends,\" underscoring the sense of finality and inevitability of the human condition.\n\nOverall, \"The Hollow Men\" is a powerful and thought-provoking work that explores the darkest aspects of the human psyche. Eliot's use of paradox, irony, and allusion creates a complex and layered poem that rewards careful reading and reflection. The poem's themes of emptiness and despair continue to resonate with readers today, making it a timeless work of literature."
