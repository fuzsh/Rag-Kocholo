        "text": "T.S. Eliot was no stranger to classical literature. Drawing allusions from everything from the Fisher King to Buddhism, ‘The Waste Land‘ was published in 1922 and remains one of the most important Modernist texts to date.\n\nModernist poetry, beginning in the early 20th century, advocated experimentation and break with traditional writing methods, especially elaborate and structured Victorian poetry. ‘The Waste Land‘ is considered defining poem of literary modernism as it employs experimentation in form while portraying the decadent contemporaneous time instead of Victorian idealism.\n\n‘The Waste Land‘ has such vast and complex references that Eliot had to provide end notes to the poem. Some of the mythology used within the poem includes the Hindu Upanishads, Buddhist lore, and the Arthurian Legends woven throughout the narrative, bringing forth several different voices.\n\nSummary\n\nIt is difficult to tie one meaning to ‘The Waste Land‘. Ultimately, the poem itself is about culture: the celebration of culture, the death of culture, and the misery of being learned in a world that has largely forgotten its roots. Eliot wrote it as a eulogy to the culture that he considered to be dead; at a time when dancing, music, jazz, and other forms of popular culture took the place of literature and classics, it must have felt, to Eliot, as though he was shouting into the wind. However, ‘The Waste Land’s merit stems from the fact that it embodies so much knowledge within the poem itself. It serves as a living testimony to the enmeshed pattern of the human spirit and human culture.\n\nHowever, the fragmented writing that Eliot was famous for – see also ‘The Love Story of J. Alfred Prufrock‘ – makes the poem a daunting one to analyze. It is split up into five sections, each of which has a different theme at the center of its writing, as well as addendums to the poem itself, which were published largely at the behest of the publisher himself, who wanted some reason to justify printing The Waste Land as a separate poem in its own book.\n\nAlthough not a part of the poem quoted below, the allusions start before that: the poem was originally preceded by Latin epigraphy from ‘The Satyricon’, a Latin fiction written by Gaius Petronius in the late 1st century AD about a narrator, Encolpius, and his hapless and unfaithful lover. The phrase reads, in English, ‘I saw with my own eyes the Sibyl of Cumae hanging in a jar, and when the boys said to her, ‘Sibyl, what do you want?’ she replied, “I want to die.”\n\nNot a cheery way to start the poem: the oracle Sibyl is granted immortality by Apollo, but not eternal youth or health, and so she grows older and older and frailer and never dies. The meaninglessness of the oracle of Sibyl’s life is a testimony and an allusion to the meaninglessness of culture, according to Eliot; by putting that particular quotation from ‘The Satyricon’ at the start, he encapsulates the very sense of The Waste Land: culture has become meaningless, and dragged on for nothing.\n\nFollowing that quote, there is a dedication to Ezra Pound, “il miglior fabbro.” Originally, ‘The Waste Land‘ was supposed to be twice as long as it was – Pound took it and edited it down to the version that was later published. However, “il miglior fabbro” can also be considered to be an allusion to Dante’s ‘Purgatorio’ (‘the best smith’ writes Dante, about troubadour Arnaut Daniel), as well as Pound’s own ‘The Spirit of Romance’, a book of literary criticism where the second chapter is ‘Il Miglior Fabbro’, translated as ‘the better craftsman’. Although originally written in ink, later versions of the poem included the dedication to Pound as a part of the poem’s publication.\n\nIn the end notes of ‘The Waste Land,’ Eliot talked about the influence of some texts on the poem stating, “Not only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested by Miss Jessie L. Weston’s book on the Grail legend: ‘From Ritual to Romance’ (Cambridge). Indeed, so deeply am I indebted, Miss Weston’s book will elucidate the difficulties of the poem much better than my notes can do; and I recommend it (apart from the great interest of the book itself ) to any who think such elucidation of the poem worth the trouble. To another work of anthropology I am indebted in general, one which has influenced our generation profoundly; I mean ‘The Golden Bough’; I have used especially the two volumes Adonis, Attis, Osiris. Anyone who is acquainted with these works will immediately recognise in the poem certain references to vegetation ceremonies.”\n\nDiscover more T.S. Eliot poems.\n\nDetailed Analysis\n\nPart One: Stanza One\n\nI. The Burial of the Dead\n\nApril is the cruellest month, breeding\n\nLilacs out of the dead land, mixing\n\nMemory and desire, stirring\n\nDull roots with spring rain.\n\nWinter kept us warm, covering\n\nEarth in forgetful snow, feeding\n\nA little life with dried tubers.\n\nSummer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee\n\nWith a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,\n\nAnd went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,\n\nAnd drank coffee, and talked for an hour.\n\nBin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.\n\nAnd when we were children, staying at the arch-duke’s,\n\nMy cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,\n\nAnd I was frightened. He said, Marie,\n\nMarie, hold on tight. And down we went.\n\nIn the mountains, there you feel free.\n\nI read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.\n\nImmediately, the poem starts with the recurring imagery of death: ‘April is the cruelest month, breeding / Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing / Memory and desire, stirring / Dull roots with spring rain.’ Note the cadence of every –ing ending to the sentence, giving it a breathless, uneven sort of reading: when one reads it, there is a quick-slow pace to it that invites the reader to linger over the words.\n\nThe use of the word ‘winter’ provides an oxymoronic idea: the idea that cold and death can somehow be warming – however, it isn’t the celebration of death, as it would be in other poems of the time, but a cold, hard fact. Winter is the time for normal life to hibernate, to become suspended, and thus the anxiety of change and of new life is avoided. At the time of writing, Eliot was suffering from an acute state of nerves, and it could well be the truth behind the poem that change was something he was actively avoiding.\n\n‘Starnbergersee,’ and its shower of regenerating rain, refers to Countess Marie Louise Larisch’s native home of Munich. The reference to ‘Hofgarten’ also calls back to Munich; it is a garden in the center of Munich, located between the Residenz and the Englischer Garden, and she stands as a symbolic reference to old European values. Marie Louise Larisch’s presence in the poem can be put down for quite a few reasons – after the crushing misery of the First World War, Marie Louise Larisch was a symbol of Old-World Europe, the kind from before the war.\n\nThe two experiences recounted here could also well be seen as the dualistic nature of the world. Before the war – Marie and her cousin went sledding, exuding a sense of excitement and adventure, ‘in the mountains, there you feel free,’ and then the reference to ‘drank coffee, and talked for an hour,’ which could stand for the post-war world – boring and sterile and emptied of all meaning and value, unlike the pre-war world. The separation of the two stanzas by the German language further emphasizes the idea that, while both are alike, the two worlds remain different from each other – ‘Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch’ means ‘I am not Russian at all, I come from Lithuania, I am a real German.’ This phrase further emphasizes the separation that the reader might also be feeling due to the disruption caused by a different language.\n\nStanza Two\n\nWhat are the roots that clutch, what branches grow\n\nOut of this stony rubbish? Son of man,\n\n(…)\n\nLooking into the heart of light, the silence.\n\nOed’ und leer das Meer.\n\nHere is another of Eliot’s allusions, ‘son of man/ you cannot say or guess’, which is directly lifted from The Call of Ezekiel in the ‘Book of Ezekiel’. The religious allusion could be considered a response to the vast technological advancements of the time, where science was taking great leaps; however, the spiritual and cultural sectors of the world were desolate.\n\n‘A heap of broken images’ shows the fragmented nature of the world and the snapshots of what the world has become to further pinpoint the emptiness of a world without pillars of culture and religion – a world without meaning and spiritual belief. Eliot himself noted that this is from Ecclesiastes 12, a book within the Bible that discusses the meaning of life and the duty of man to appreciate his life. The references to shadows seem to imply that there is something larger and far greater than the reader skulking along beside the poem, lending it an air of menace and the narrator an air of omnipotence, of being everywhere at once.\n\nThe German in the middle is from Tristan and Isolde, and it concerns the nature of love – love, like life, is something given by God, and humankind should appreciate it because it so very easily disappears. In Tristan and Isolde, the main idea behind the opera is that while death conquers all and unites grieving lovers, love itself only causes problems in the first place, and therefore it is death that should be celebrated, and not love. The use of it in Eliot’s poem adds to the idea of a welcomed death, of death, needing to appear.\n\nAnother reference to tragic love and uniting death occurs in the use of the flower ‘hyacinth.’ Hyacinth was a young Spartan prince who caught the eye of Apollo, and in a tragic accident, Apollo killed him with his discus. Mourning his lover, Apollo turned the drops of blood into flowers and thus was born the flower Hyacinth. There are twofold reasons for the reference to Hyacinth: one, the legend itself is a miserable legend of death once more uniting thwarted lovers, and, two, the allusion to homosexuality would have, itself, been problematic. Homosexuality was not tolerated at the time of Eliot’s writing, so he could be attempting to give the silenced a voice by referencing Hyacinth, one of the most obvious homosexual Greek myths. However, to continue with the same theme in the poem, the evidence of love will be lost to death, and there will be nothing more existing. Additionally, the allusions to death also convey the idea of regeneration or rebirth in another form which happens after death (as evident in the case of the Spartan Prince whose death led to the birth of the flower Hyacinth).\n\nThe stanza ends with another quote from Tristan and Isolde, this time meaning ‘empty and desolate sea.’\n\nStanza Three\n\nMadame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,\n\nHad a bad cold, nevertheless\n\n(…)\n\nTell her I bring the horoscope myself:\n\nOne must be so careful these days.\n\nCleanth Brooks writes: “The fortune-telling of “The Burial of the Dead” will illustrate the general method very satisfactorily. On the surface of the poem the poet reproduces the patter of the charlatan, Madame Sosostris, and there is the surface irony: the contrast between the original use of the Tarot cards and the use made by Madame Sosostris. But each of the details (justified realistically in the palaver of the fortune-teller) assumes a new meaning in the general context of the poem. There is then, in addition to the surface irony, something of a Sophoclean irony too, and the “fortune-telling,” which is taken ironically by a twentieth-century audience, becomes true as the poem develops–true in a sense in which Madame Sosostris herself does not think it true. The surface irony is thus reversed and becomes an irony on a deeper level. The items of her speech have only one reference in terms of the context of her speech: the “man with three staves,” the “one-eyed merchant,” the “crowds of people, walking round in a ring,” etc. But transferred to other contexts, they become loaded with special meanings. To sum up, all the central symbols of the poem head up here; but here, in the only section in which they are explicitly bound together, the binding is slight and accidental. The deeper lines of association only emerge in terms of the total context as the poem develops–and this is, of course, exactly the effect which the poet intends.”\n\nThe Phoenician sailor could be a reference to Shakespeare’s ‘The Tempest’; in this particular stanza, several images intermesh between water and rock, starting with the allusion to the tempest (water being the symbol used by Eliot for rejuvenation and regeneration) and then moving on to the idea of Belladonna, ‘the lady of the rocks’, i.e., the never-changing and desolate landscape of the Waste land itself. Once more, it moves to water – the ‘man with three staves’ being the representation of the Fisher King, who was wounded by his own Spear and is regenerated through water given to him from the Holy Grail.\n\nStanza Four\n\nUnreal City,\n\nUnder the brown fog of a winter dawn,\n\n(…)\n\n‘Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again!\n\n‘You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!”\n\n‘Unreal City’ refers to Baudelaire’s ‘The Seven Old Men’, from Fleurs du Mal. It was written at the time when Paris was considered a decadent, overwrought paradise of science, technology, and innovation, but not very much culture; thus, Paris, in Baudelaire’s writing, takes on a nightmarish landscape. Here, Eliot uses it in much the same effect: a nightmarish landscape that is not quite Paris and is not quite London but is meant to stand in for several places at once.\n\n‘Mylae’ is a symbol of warfare – it was a naval battle between the Romans and Carthage, and Eliot uses it here as a stand-in for the First World War to show that humanity has never changed, that war will never change and that death itself will never change.\n\n‘Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men’ is a paraphrasing of a quote from John Webster’s ‘The White Devil’, a play about the Vittoria Accoramboni murder. In the play, a character named Marcello is murdered, and his mother tearfully implores Flamineo to keep ‘the wolf far thence, that’s foe to men / for with his nails he’ll dig them up again’. If he is dug up again, then his spirit will never find rest, and he will never be reborn – here, Eliot, capitalizing on the quote, changes it so that the attempt to disturb rebirth is seen as a good thing. After all, Eliot is implying, who would want to be reborn in a world without culture?\n\nPart Two: Stanza One\n\nII. A GAME OF CHESS\n\nThe Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne,\n\nGlowed on the marble, where the glass\n\n(…)\n\nSpread out in fiery points\n\nGlowed into words, then would be savagely still.\n\nThe second part moves on from the description of the landscape – the titular Waste Land – to three different settings and three more different characters. The title is taken from two plays by Thomas Middleton, wherein the idea of a game of chess is an exercise in seduction.\n\nDecadence and pre-war luxury abound in the first part of this stanza. The references to ‘throne’ could be attempting to pinpoint to Europe, or England, more specifically, but even without the remits of place, the idea is of pre-war Europe, the seductive and vicious Old World that American writers harped on about in their works. However, the luxury that is written about seems empty. The ‘golden Cupidon’ hides his face, and the reference to jewels, ivory, and glass seems to show an empty wealth – everything that is mentioned in the poem is a symbol of extravagance; however, the fact that it is glass and ivory and jewels seems to suggest a certain fragility in its wealth. Even the colors seem muted, and the light seems to be fading throughout the first stanza, shedding light only for a moment; as we read, the extravagance seems to be withering. ‘Laquearia’ is a type of paneling.\n\nThe reference to ‘Paradise Lost’ – ‘sylvan scene / The change of Philomel, by the barbarous King’ – can allude to everything that the world has lost since the First World War: innocent soldiers, innocence in general, this sense of nothing every quite being right again. It can also stand for the violent death of culture, given away to the vapidity of the modern world. There is a sense of altogether failure in this section – the references to Cleopatra, Cupidon, Sylvan scenes, and Philomela are references to failed love and to the destruction of the status quo. The description of the woman moves from powerful and strong – her wealth is her shield – to weak, thereby showing again the difference between pre-war and post-war Europe, specifically pre-war and post-war England. Once a noble country, now it is old and doddering, crumbling (‘sad light / a carved dolphin swam’; ‘withered stump of time’).\n\nStanza Two\n\n“My nerves are bad to-night. Yes, bad. Stay with me.\n\nSpeak to me. Why do you never speak? Speak.\n\nWhat are you thinking of? What thinking? What?\n\nI never know what you are thinking. Think.”\n\nHere we see the insanity of the woman, thereby symbolizing that all her wealth has not done a thing for her mind, lending the fragmented poem an even bigger sense of fragmentation and giving it a sense of loss, though the reader does not yet know what we have lost. As this was written at the height of spiritualism, one could imagine that it is trying to draw an allusion to those grief-maddened mothers and mistresses, and lovers who contacted spiritualists and mediums to try and come into contact with their loved ones. Alternatively, one can take it as the embodiment of England, trying to reach out to her dead.\n\nStanza Three\n\nI think we are in rats’ alley\n\nWhere the dead men lost their bones.\n\n(…)\n\nAnd we shall play a game of chess,\n\nPressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door.\n\n‘I think we are in rats’ alley/Where the dead men lost their bone’ – is a reference to the First World War again – the trenches were notorious for rats, and the use of this imagery further lends the poem a sense of decay and rot.\n\nThe stanza causes further fragmentation of the poem, to the point where even the grammar seems to be suffering; ‘Shakespearian Rag’ was a renaming of the ‘Mysterious Rag’, and it is furthermore emphasizing the death of culture for popular, high society dances and popular culture in general. However, it is interesting to note that the poem mentions Shakespeare again – once more, the reader thinks of ‘The Tempest’, a play set on a little island beset by ferocious storms.\n\nThe lack of purpose and lack of guidance can be considered to be one of the causes of madness and a further descent into fragmentation in the poem. There is a loose sense of time in this particular stanza – from ‘the hot water at ten./ And if it rains, a closed car at four. / And we shall play a game of chess, / Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door’. It lends the poem a sense of suspended animation, as it did in the beginning; however, here, the guideless manner of the people seems to be loosely defined by very small happenings – their days are structured through moments rather than planned out.\n\nStanza Four\n\nWhen Lil’s husband got demobbed, I said,\n\nI didn’t mince my words, I said to her myself,\n\n(…)\n\nTa ta. Goonight. Goonight.\n\nGood night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.\n\n‘Lil’ could be a reference to Lilith, Adam’s first wife, who was thrown out of Eden for being too dominant. However, in the poem, it could also be considered that Lil is merely a friend of the narrator’s – a woman who was unfaithful to her husband; here again is referenced the cloying and ultimately useless nature of love (‘And if you don’t give it to him, there’s others will, I said’). This seems to be built upon the idea of sex as the ultimate expression of manliness, a theme that Eliot enjoyed exploring in his works. The fact that the woman hints that there are ‘others who will’ implies that she herself is sleeping with her friend’s husband, however, we cannot be certain of this.\n\nThis last part of the stanza seems to show the minutiae of the upper class in shoddy lighting – with a hard emphasis on the nature of womanhood and on the trials of womanhood. Lil is ‘only thirty-one’ but looks much older; she took pills to ‘bring it off,’ which we later understand is to induce abortions, and throughout the poem, the other woman attempts to give her advice; however, the irony is that the other woman is, as well, miserable, and wrapped up in her own misery to the point where her advice seems to be a little skewed.\n\nPeppered throughout the latter stanza of the poem is the phrase ‘hurry up please its time’ giving a sense of urgency to the poem that is at odds with the lackadaisical way that the woman is recounting her stories – it seems to be building up to an almost apocalyptic event, a dark tragedy, that she is completely unaware of.\n\nThe last line references Ophelia, the drowned lover of Hamlet, who famously thought ‘a woman’s love is brief’. Therefore, we know for sure that this particular stanza of the poem is referencing sex – the ultimate pleasure for a man and the duty of a woman.\n\nAdditionally, the poem alludes to the loveless, infertile, and sterile sexual relationships of the decayed modern world. The debased sexual relationships indicate the lack of genuine human connections emphasizing the meaninglessness and spiritual desolation of the postwar world.\n\nPart three: Stanza One\n\nIII. THE FIRE SERMON\n\nThe river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf\n\nClutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind\n\n(…)\n\nBut at my back in a cold blast I hear\n\nThe rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.\n\nThe line ‘Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song’ is from Spenser’s ‘Prothalamion’, and it alludes to a marriage song. In Spenser’s work, water represents a joyous occasion, which is at odds with its usage in Eliot’s Waste Land. Here, the water once more represents the loss of life – although there is a sign of human living (indicating the possibility of rebirth), there are no humans around.\n\nThe reference to ‘nymph’ could be a calling back to the overarching idea of sex.\n\nStanza Two\n\nA rat crept softly through the vegetation\n\nDragging its slimy belly on the bank\n\n(…)\n\nThey wash their feet in soda water\n\nEt, O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole!\n\nThere is no reason given, ultimately, for the wreckage of the Waste Land; however, following the idea of the Fisher King, we can assume that as the narrator suffers, so too does the world. The world, with the loss of culture, is now a barren Waste Land, and with the onset of wars, has only served to become even more ruined and destroyed.\n\n‘Sweeney and Mrs Porter in the spring’ is a reference to the legend of Diana, the hunting goddess, and Actaeon. Actaeon spied on Diana in the bath, and Diana cursed him to become a stag, who was torn to pieces by his own hounds. Here, Eliot again presents the destruction caused by loveless but lustful sexual relationships.\n\nEt, O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole’ and ‘O those children’s voices singing in the dome’, – is French and from Verlaine’s Parsifal, about the noble virgin knight Percival, who can drink from the holy grail (Arthurian legend) due to his purity. It stands in this poem as a criticism of the contemporaneous debased sexuality.\n\nStanza Three\n\nTwit twit twit\n\nJug jug jug jug jug jug\n\n(…)\n\nTo luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel\n\nFollowed by a week-end at the Metropole.\n\n‘Mr. Eugenides’ has a dual meaning here – tying back to the merchant in Madame Sosostris’ tarot cards, as well as standing in for the behavior of soliciting gay men for affection. Canon Street Hotel and the Metropole were well known for this sort of behavior among homosexual men, and thus once more, Eliot paints the cheapest possible sight of love.\n\nStanza Four\n\nAt the violet hour, when the eyes and back\n\nTurn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits\n\n(…)\n\nBestows one final patronizing kiss,\n\nAnd gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit…\n\nTiresias is from Greek Mythology, and he was turned into a woman as a punishment by Hera for separating two copulating snakes. In the poem, it just serves, again, as a symbol of the cheapness of sex and affection.\n\nThe scene that plays out illustrates Eliot’s idea about the death of higher beliefs, such as the idea of romance and love. Note the lack of intimacy evidenced in the description above.\n\nStanza Five\n\nShe turns and looks a moment in the glass,\n\nHardly aware of her departed lover;\n\nHer brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:\n\n“Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.”\n\nWhen lovely woman stoops to folly and\n\nPaces about her room again, alone,\n\nShe smoothes her hair with automatic hand,\n\nAnd puts a record on the gramophone.\n\nAgain, the stanza contains references to Shakespeare’s ‘The Tempest’.\n\nStanza Six\n\n‘This music crept by me upon the waters’\n\nAnd along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.\n\nO City City, I can sometimes hear\n\nBeside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,\n\nThe pleasant whining of a mandoline\n\nAnd a clatter and a chatter from within\n\nWhere fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls\n\nOf Magnus Martyr hold\n\nInexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.\n\nThe river sweats\n\nOil and tar\n\nThe barges drift\n\nWith the turning tide\n\nRed sails\n\nWide\n\nTo leeward, swing on the heavy spar.\n\nThe barges wash\n\nDrifting logs\n\nDown Greenwich reach\n\nPast the Isle of Dogs.\n\nWeialala leia\n\nWallala leialala\n\nElizabeth and Leicester\n\nBeating oars\n\nThe stern was formed\n\nA gilded shell\n\nRed and gold\n\nThe brisk swell\n\nRippled both shores\n\nSouth-west wind\n\nCarried down stream\n\nThe peal of bells\n\nWhite towers\n\nWeialala leia\n\nWallala leialala\n\nA reference to Elizabeth I and the First Earl of Leicester Robert Dudley, who were rumored to be having an affair.\n\nStanza Seven\n\n“Trams and dusty trees.\n\nI made no comment. What should I resent?”\n\n(…)\n\nO Lord Thou pluckest me out\n\nO Lord Thou pluckest\n\nburning\n\n‘To Carthage then I came’ references Augustine’s journey to overcome his secular and pagan lifestyle. Contrasting with the earlier part of the Fire Sermon, where Buddha was preaching about abstaining, here the poem turns to Western religion – however, regardless of their position, they’re written into the poem with a slightly mocking overtone.\n\nPart Four: Stanza One\n\nIV. DEATH BY WATER\n\nPhlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,\n\nForgot the cry of gulls, and the deep seas swell\n\nAnd the profit and loss.\n\nA current under sea\n\nPicked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell\n\nHe passed the stages of his age and youth\n\nEntering the whirlpool.\n\nGentile or Jew\n\nO you who turn the wheel and look to windward,\n\nConsider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.\n\nThe cycle of rebirth and regeneration is shown: the drowned sailor returns to the water and will be reborn again in time as he has ‘entered the whirlpool’, and thus re-entered the cycle of life.\n\nPart Five: Stanza One\n\nAfter the torch-light red on sweaty faces\n\nAfter the frosty silence in the gardens\n\n(…)\n\nWe who were living are now dying\n\nWith a little patience\n\nThe final section of the poem opens up with a recounting of the events after Jesus was taken to prison in the garden of Gethsemane and after the crucifixion itself. Notice the almost apocalyptic language used in this part of the description, the way the language itself seems to emphasize the silence through the use of language words – ‘shouting’, ‘crying’, and ‘reverberation’ are all words of noise; however, this section of the poem brings about an almost deathly quiet, and an intermeshing of life and death that makes it difficult for the reader to tell whether the states exist separately or together. ‘He who was living is now dead’ also ties back to the idea of the rebirth sequence.\n\nStanza Two\n\nHere is no water but only rock\n\nRock and no water and the sandy road\n\n(…)\n\nFrom doors of mud-cracked houses\n\nIf there were water\n\nThe apocalyptic imagery continues in the following section of the stanza. Once more, the poem returns to its description of the rock: the barren, desolate Waste Land of life that calls back to the cultural Waste Land that Eliot is so scornful of, the lack of life that corroborates a lack of human faith. Water, the symbol of rebirth and regeneration, is surrounded on all sides by death.\n\nStanza Three\n\nAnd no rock\n\nIf there were rock\n\n(…)\n\nDrip drop drip drop drop drop drop\n\nBut there is no water\n\nThe stanza seems to have a longing for water and thus leaving the idea of rebirth ambiguous.\n\nStanza Four\n\nWho is the third who walks always beside you?\n\nWhen I count, there are only you and I together\n\nBut when I look ahead up the white road\n\nThere is always another one walking beside you\n\nGliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded\n\nI do not know whether a man or a woman\n\n—But who is that on the other side of you?\n\nThe hooded figure can be seen as some sort of guardian, an allusion to the Biblical passage where Jesus joins two disciples in walking to the tomb in Sepulchre and a guide through the chaotic mess of the world that is left behind. It is unclear if Eliot is implying that poetry should itself be the guiding principle that all people follow.\n\nStanza Five\n\nWhat is that sound high in the air\n\nMurmur of maternal lamentation\n\n(…)\n\nVienna London\n\nUnreal\n\nAnother reference to the total destruction rendered by war – ‘falling towers’ also called the Biblical imagery of the tower of Babylon.\n\nStanza Six\n\nA woman drew her long black hair out tight\n\nAnd fiddled whisper music on those strings\n\n(…)\n\nTolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours\n\nAnd voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.\n\nThe line ‘The woman drew her long black hair’ alludes to Medusa and the evil powers humans are attracted to. It again emphasizes sterile, infertile, and almost devilish sexual relationships and connections humans make in the modern world.\n\nStanza Seven\n\nIn this decayed hole among the mountains\n\nIn the faint moonlight, the grass is singing\n\n(…)\n\nIn a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust\n\nBringing rain\n\nThe cock in the stanza refers to the Bible and specifically to the prelude to the crucifixion and the betrayal of Christ by Peter; the reference ultimately alludes to the underlying idea of rebirth and regeneration as it indicates Jesus’ resurrection. “Bringing rain” also alludes to the cyclic regeneration that nature follows; the stanza exudes subtle hope for the desolate Waste Land through the rebirth, which takes place only after death.\n\nStanza Eight\n\nGanga was sunken, and the limp leaves\n\nWaited for rain, while the black clouds\n\n(…)\n\nGaily, when invited, beating obedient\n\nTo controlling hands\n\nIn this stanza, the landscape transforms from the European Waste Land to the lush jungles of India and the holy Ganges.\n\nEmpty faith is once more symbolized explicitly by the ’empty chapel’. This can also reference the Chapel Perilous – the graveyard for those who have sought the Holy Grail and failed.\n\nStanza Nine\n\nI sat upon the shore\n\nFishing, with the arid plain behind me\n\n(…)\n\nWhy then Ile fit you. Hieronymo’s mad againe.\n\nDatta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.\n\nShantih shantih shantih\n\nIn the very last stanza, Eliot hints at the reason for the fragmentation of this poem: so that he could take us to different places and situations. Ruins, no matter where they are, are always ruins, and madness and death will never change, regardless of the difference in place.\n\nThe imagery of the fisherman sitting on the shore – ‘with the arid plain behind me’ – is a direct allusion to the Fisher King and his barren land. ‘Shall I ate least set my lands in order?’ is a quote from the Bible, from the Book of Isaiah: “Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live”.\n\nMichael H. Levenson puts the last stanza into perspective from a linguistic point of view: The poem concludes with a rapid series of allusive literary fragments: seven of the last eight lines are quotations. But in the midst of these quotations is a line to which we must attach great importance: “These fragments I have shored against my ruins.” In the space of that line, the poem becomes conscious of itself. What had been a series of fragments of consciousness has become a consciousness of fragmentation: that may not be salvation, but it is a difference, for as Eliot writes, “To realize that a point of view is a point of view is already to have transcended it.” And to recognize fragments as fragments, to name them as fragments, is already to have transcended them not to a harmonious or final unity but to a somewhat higher, somewhat more inclusive, somewhat more conscious point of view. Considered in this way, the poem does not achieve a resolved coherence, but neither does it remain in a chaos of fragmentation. Rather it displays a series of more or less stable patterns, regions of coherence, and temporary principles of order; the poem not as a stable unity but engaged in what Eliot calls the “painful task of unifying.”\n\nHistorical Background"
