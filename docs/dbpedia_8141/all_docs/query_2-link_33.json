        "text": "Poet, essayist, playwright, and social critic T. S. Eliot was one of the defining voices of the 20th century and an integral part of the Modernist movement. He won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1948 “for his outstanding, pioneer contribution to present-day poetry.” The recently published first paperback edition of The Poems of T. S. Eliot is the authoritative collection of his works, scrupulously edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue who offer in-depth commentary to accompany Eliot’s well-known masterpieces, the poems of his youth, love poems from his final years, and two books of verse. The commentary illuminates the creative activity that came to constitute each poem, calling upon drafts, correspondence, and other original materials to take us inside a mind that never ceased exploring.\n\nWhat follows are two poems from the second volume, from the section “Practical Cats and Further Verses.”\n\nThe Naming of Cats\n\nThe Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,\n\nIt isn’t just one of your holiday games;\n\nYou may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter\n\nWhen I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.\n\nFirst of all, there’s the name that the family use daily,\n\nSuch as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo or James,\n\nSuch as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey—\n\nAll of them sensible everyday names.\n\nThere are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,\n\nSome for the gentlemen, some for the dames:\n\nSuch as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter—\n\nBut all of them sensible everyday names.\n\nBut I tell you, a cat needs a name that’s particular,\n\nA name that’s peculiar, and more dignified,\n\nElse how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,\n\nOr spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?\n\nOf names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,\n\nSuch as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat,\n\nSuch as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum—\n\nNames that never belong to more than one cat.\n\nBut above and beyond there’s still one name left over,\n\nAnd that is the name that you never will guess;\n\nThe name that no human research can discover—\n\nBut THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.\n\nWhen you notice a cat in profound meditation,\n\nThe reason, I tell you, is always the same:\n\nHis mind is engaged in a rapt contemptation\n\nOf the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:\n\nHis ineffable effable\n\nEffanineffable\n\nDeep and inscrutable signular Name.\n\n• • •\n\nMr. Mistoffelees\n\nYou ought to know Mr. Mistoffelees!\n\nThe Original Conjuring Cat—\n\n(There can be no doubt about that).\n\nPlease listen to me and don’t scoff. All his\n\nInventions are off his own bat.\n\nThere’s no such Cat in the metropolis;\n\nHe holds all the patent monopolies\n\nFor performing surprising illusions\n\nAnd creating eccentric confusions.\n\nAt prestidigitation\n\nAnd at legerdemain\n\nHe’ll defy examination\n\nAnd deceive you again.\n\nThe greatest magicians have something to learn\n\nFrom Mr. Mistoffelees’ Conjuring Turn.\n\nPresto!\n\nAway we go!\n\nAnd we all say: OH!\n\nWell I never!\n\nWas there ever\n\nA Cat so clever\n\nAs Magical Mr. Mistoffelees!\n\nHe is quiet and small, he is black\n\nFrom his ears to the tip of his tail;\n\nHe can creep through the tiniest crack,\n\nHe can walk on the narrowest rail.\n\nHe can pick any card from a pack,\n\nHe is equally cunning with dice;\n\nHe is always deceiving you into believing\n\nThat he’s only hunting for mice.\n\nHe can play any trick with a cork\n\nOr a spoon and a bit of fish-paste;\n\nIf you look for a knife or a fork\n\nAnd you think it is merely misplaced—\n\nYou have seen it one moment, and then it is gawn!\n\nBut you’ll find it next week lying out on the lawn.\n\nAnd we all say: OH!\n\nWell I never!\n\nWas there ever\n\nA Cat so clever\n\nAs Magical Mr. Mistoffelees!\n\nHis manner is vague and aloof,\n\nYou would think there was nobody shyer—\n\nBut his voice has been heard on the roof\n\nWhen he was curled up by the fire.\n\nAnd he’s sometimes been heard by the fire\n\nWhen he was about on the roof—\n\n(At least we all heard somebody who purred)\n\nWhich is incontestable proof\n\nOf his singular magical powers:\n\nAnd I have known the family to call\n\nHim in from the garden for hours,\n\nWhile he was asleep in the hall.\n\nAnd not long ago this phenomenal Cat\n\nProduced seven kittens right out of a hat!\n\nAnd we all said: OH!\n\nWell I never!\n\nDid you ever\n\nKnow a Cat so clever\n\nAs Magical Mr. Mistoffelees!\n\nThomas Stearns Eliot was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1888. He moved to England in 1914 and published his first book of poems in 1917. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948. Eliot died in 1965.\n\nSir Christopher Ricks is the William M. and Sara B. Warren Professor of the Humanities at Boston University, having formerly been a professor of English at Bristol and at Cambridge. He is a member of the Association of Literary Scholars, Critics, and Writers, of which he was president (2007–2008)."
