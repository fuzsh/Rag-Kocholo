Eliot's poetry often deals with disillusionment and fragmentation of modern life, using complex language and innovative forms. Yeats, on the other hand, focused on themes of Irish folklore, mythology, and politics, with a more traditional poetic style and use of symbolic imagery. Both poets were concerned with the state of the world and humanity, but expressed their views in distinct ways.",
