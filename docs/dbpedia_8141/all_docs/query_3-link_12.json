        "text": "T.S. Eliot, the remarkable poet of the modernist era who became the liaison between the traditional and modern world with his transparent treatment of traditional and modern themes. His predisposition towards spirituality and his apprehension of essential modernism with a critical approach has become the catalyst to the production of some of the classics in modern poetry. Eliot's 'The Waste Land' is considered to be the most important literary creation of the 20th century that continues to influence and illustrate the changing social and political dynamics at all periods in history.\n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock is another masterpiece from the oeuvre of Eliot, is also a portrayal of a tormented ‘modern man’ who is suffocated with the inevitable existential crisis caused from the fated millennial social constructs. A comparison of these two poems on the grounds of the theme of alienation will help us develop a greater understanding of the modern world and its powerful attributes in shaping the lives of human beings.\n\n“The Waste Land” essentially written after World War 1 is a perfect amalgamation of disillusionment, alienation and religious experience written to surpass darkness and desolation. There is vivid imagery that comes to Eliot's disposition in painting a picture of social subjugation, alienation and depravity. “The Waste Land” treats alienation as something inescapable and a curse on modern humanity. He employs various symbols to depict this alienation in the poem.\n\nThe co-existence in humankind itself serves as the source of alienation. The crowd crossing London Bridge in “The Burial of the Dead,” serves an excellent example for this, people whom Eliot says \"death had undone,\" who \"fixed [their]eyes before [their] feet\" rather than looking at those around them ( WL 63, 65). The marching people closer to the old church in London is once called to unite through the ‘bell tolls’ has now acquired a “dead sound” (WL 67) a mere sound “by which to set one’s watch” (Bolton 194­195). Eliot skillfully describes how the coexistence of humanity has ironically added to the disintegration of the same with the invasion of modernity. Eliot also uses religion to explore the essentiality of alienation when Buddha asks the monks to disown the earthly pleasures in \"The Fire Sermon\". It is fascinating to explore the theme of alienation in Eliot’s poetry which is juxtaposed to the prevalence of human contact.\n\n“The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” is the manifestations of a middle-aged man trapped in the entropy of modernism. The poem resonates itself with theological and traditional romantic creations. Eliot portrays the unpropitious alienation communicated in the form a theatrical dramatic monologue. The poem becomes the graveyard of the aspirations and desires of a man who has given up on the prospects of happiness, an alien thought in the modern era. The alienation developed in the troubled psyche of a modern man is thus quite apparent in the poem. Prufrock represents any diffident man who is unable to match the expectations of modern society; he is the man who has given up on the prospects of finding his love interest as he doesn’t fit the social presuppositions. The theme of alienation can be identified in the indecisiveness of Prufrock to pursue his love interest. This arises from his inability to conform to the social standards established in modern society. The cowardice to explore the possible happiness is developed from the realization that he is a pitiable misfit in the society expressed better as “an insect sprawling on a pin”. The sense of alienation is further strengthened with his observation of how women look down at him in dismay. The estrangement is widely communicated with his inability to instill a desirable move towards happiness.\n\nA kind of attachment with alienation is developed by Prufrock which pushed him to put away the prospect of asking ‘the question’ at the communal event. He says “There will be time, there will be time” is exactly the kind of alienation and the feeling of diffidence that arise from it. This pushes him to be invisible and passive in front of his love. He continues to rethink the possibility of approaching the women with the lines “to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet” to show his futile attempts to connect with society. His inability in the pursuit of happiness and decision-making bears testimony to social anxiety, clearly transmitted using the enjambed lines. The fear represented in the line \"Do I dare?\" is an indication of the cohesive feeling that Prufrock has with the deserted life. Prufrock's position in society as an outcast can be further analyzed as his own choice. He identifies the people around him to be unapproachable and devoid of human sentiments which further adds to his fear of joining them. This forces him to identify himself to be away from society and his disdain towards its principals. This attitude is further represented in his attitude towards life itself in the lines \"measured out his life with coffee spoons”\n\nPrufrock is the representative of a wider flock of socially unacceptable outcasts, whose identity becomes vague in the modern world. The theme of alienation in wasteland also represents the inevitable alienation in the society brought upon by modernity. These two poems thus become the mirrors to the society which is relevant even today as the world is exposed to inconsistent political episodes and uncontrollable social expectations.\n\nReferences\n\nEliot, T.
