Through an exploration of their poetry, the paper analyzes the key themes, stylistic innovations, and formal experimentation that characterized Modernist verse. The study investigates the influence of historical and personal contexts on the poets' works and examines their contributions to the development of Modernism. The comparative analysis highlights both the shared elements and distinct approaches of Eliot, Yeats, and Pound, emphasizing their impact on the broader landscape of English poetry. The conclusions underscore the significance of these poets in reshaping literary traditions and offer insights into the enduring relevance of the Modernist Movement.",
