        "text": "Page 139 →\n\n5\n\nT. S. Eliot (1888-1965)\n\nIntroduced and Edited by Nancy K. Gishn\n\nIn 1914, having just met T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound praised \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" as \"the best poem I have yet had or seen from an American.\" Eliot, he wrote to Harriet Monroe, had \"actually trained himself and modernized himself on his own\" (Stock 166). Eliot's modernism as well as his poetic importance were thus affirmed early. With the appearance of Prufrock and Other Observations in 1917 and The Sacred Wood in 1920, Eliot established himself as both avant-garde poet and literary critic, and with the publication of The Waste Land and winning of the Dial poetry prize in 1922, his reputation was assured. Although early reviews of The Waste Land were mixed, most readers came to share Conrad Aiken's view that it was \"intensely modem\" in its fragmentation and \"one of the most moving and original poems of our time\" (Aiken 97, 99).\n\nWhile Eliot's early poems share a vision of personal and social disintegration, the later work, from the Ariel poems and Ash Wednesday to Four Quartets, articulates a conservative and religious response to such a world. His criticism, too, moves from aesthetic to cultural and religious issues. As both poet and man of letters he was admired, even acclaimed, throughout his life, winning the Order of Merit and the Nobel Prize for literature in 1948, the Hanseatic Goethe Award in 1955, and the Dante Gold Medal in 1958. Moreover, as literary critic, editor of the Criterion, and director of Faber and Faber, Page 140 →Eliot helped shape the course of literature and ideas in England and America for much of this century.\n\nEliot's early and steady success was based in part on his poetic innovations—his use of symbolism, precise images, wit, ironic juxtaposition, allusion, and quotation, as well as his urban and contemporary settings with taxis, gramophones, and cigarette ends. But in a broader sense Eliot's place as a major, if not the major, modernist poet was defined by criteria he himself established. In \"Tradition and the Individual Talent,\" Eliot argued that no artist could be evaluated in isolation. \"He\" must be set, \"for contrast and comparison, among the dead. ...\" Moreover, \"in a peculiar sense he will be aware also that he must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past\" (Eliot, Selected Essays 4-5). This judgment and comparison goes both ways: \"The existing monuments form an ideal order among themselves, which is modified by the introduction of the new (the really new) work of art among them\" (5). By experimental techniques which nonetheless pointed toward, incorporated, and affirmed \"the mind of Europe,\" Eliot seemed to demonstrate most fully his own definition of the individual talent that mattered. Eliot's \"tradition\" was European, white, and male. Yet, ironically, as Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar note, the \"really new\" art was women's (Gilbert and Gubar 162). By his own criteria, then, Eliot was placed in an ambivalent position by women's writing. Excluded almost by definition from \"the dead\" writers by which they were to be judged, yet offering the \"really new\" which could alter that past, they constituted both a threat and a challenge. In his one poetic portrait of a woman writer, Eliot describes her as genuine slut and pseudopoet, imitative and immature. Fresca's debility seems generalizable, since \"women grown intellectual grow dull / And lose the mother wit of natural trull\" (The Waste Land 27).\n\nBut if woman as writer was, in general, a threat, Djuna Barnes and Marianne Moore, in particular, constituted a challenge. Both were supported, edited, published, and praised by Eliot. With both he maintained friendships and corresponded for many years. Yet in his reviews and introductions to their work an ambivalent response to women writers emerges almost in spite of his stated intentions.\n\nHis correspondence with Barnes begins with a discussion of Nightwood, which Faber and Faber published in 1937. The letters continued to Eliot's death in 1965, becoming friendly, chatty, even confidential over the years. He wrote the introduction for the first American edition of Nightwood in 1937 and reprinted it as a review in The Criterion. During the previous year he had carefully edited the novel's text, cutting lines, phrases, and several long passages. In light of these cuts, his emphasis on the character of the doctor takes on special interest.\n\nEliot's introduction (printed below) opens with a tribute to Barnes's \"great achievement of a style\" and closes by placing Nightwood in relation to tradition. That Barnes's prose style is so \"alive\" as to appeal to readers of poetry, and that the book has \"a quality of horror and doom very nearly Page 141 →related to that of Elizabethan tragedy,\" acknowledges it as a \"really new\" work of art both cohering with and slightly altering the \"ideal order\" of the canon. The rest of the essay, however, focuses on the novel's characters and the centrality of Doctor Matthew-Mighty-Grain-of-Salt-Dante-O'Connor in a way that is striking, not only for its apt recognition of Barnes's psychological acuity—\"the book is not a psychopathic study. The miseries that people suffer through their particular abnormalities of temperament are visible on the surface: the deeper design is that of the human misery and bondage which is universal\"—but also for its failure even to note O'Connor's own \"particular abnormality\" as a fundamental issue.\n\nEliot acknowledges the pattern of relations of all the characters, yet he retains a sense of O'Connor's role as pivotal. It is O'Connor who, \"hypersensitive\" in his awareness of others, uses his obsessive talk to \"save the situation,\" to \"[squeeze] himself dry for other people,\" to \"drown the still small wailing and whining of humanity,\" and \"make more supportable its shame and less ignoble its misery.\" O'Connor, as Eliot presents him, is somewhat distanced from his fellow sufferers, more conscious if no more \"real.\" And while this may be accurate in itself, it obscures O'Connor's profound complicity in their lives. For the book's center is Robin Vote and the women who love her and whom she leaves and betrays. O'Connor's deepest despair is that he feels he too—psychologically—is a woman. His obsession with humiliation and the \"dark\" stems not simply from a heightened consciousness but from a consciousness of his own condition as one of irreparable and hopeless desire— the fundamental condition of marginalization and otherness. Eliot makes of him an almost religious figure, distantly related to Henry Harcourt Reilly in his \"desperate disinterestedness and . . . deep humility,\" his participation in, and authoritative recognition of, the shame of merely human and temporal need. Though O'Connor is obsessed with the nature of sin and sinners, his God is also \"she,\" the perpetrator of the great error of making him physically male and psychologically female and dooming him to a hell of gender confusion and defamation.\n\nEliot's erasure of O'Connor's deepest obsession becomes more striking when set against his editorial cuts in Barnes's text. The passages he removed are predominantly O'Connor's speeches about his transvestism and homosexual experience. Several make explicit what is less overt in the published text: when acting out this behavior publicly, O'Connor is persistently humiliated. That Eliot's introduction never acknowledges what, as editor, he reduced suggests a shift of emphasis oddly transformed into a religious stance.\n\nIn a discussion of literary canon formation, Susan Heinzelman takes over the legal concepts of \"hard,\" \"easy,\" and \"weird\" cases, demonstrating that law and literature shape women's experience through comparable uses of discourse. Briefly, \"easy\" cases are those in which clearly applicable rules non-controversially generate answers; \"hard\" cases are those in which rules are generated by \"vague, ambiguous, or simply opaque\" language, which therefore requires active interpretation on the part of the judge. In \"weird\" cases, Page 142 →on the other hand, the language is dear but cannot apply directly because the issue at hand confuses interpretation. Weird cases, therefore, say nothing about the law and are, characteristically, translated into hard cases in order to be solved—as, for example, the Baby M case, in which issues of reproductton and women's control of their own bodies are redefined as a dispute over contracts.\n\nWomen's writing persistently presents itself as \"weird,\" that is, as failing to fit the given \"law\" or set of rules extractable from the \"tradition.\" Eliot's strategy is to translate the weirdness of O'Connor's obsession and of the book's preoccupation with gender into the \"hard\" case of applying rules for poetry versus prose, pladng it within \"the\" tradition (Elizabethan) and defining its center as a recognition of the nature of sin.\n\nIn a similar manner Eliot's genuine admiration for Marianne Moore's technical brilliance and originality is troubled by questions of a woman's tradition and a woman's style. Eliot first wrote to Moore in 1921 to thank her for her Dial review of The Sacred Wood and to praise her work. Though slightly formal and reserved (it took twenty-five years to go from \"Miss\" and \"Mr.\" to \"Tom\" and \"Marianne\"), their correspondence was mutually admiring, respectful, and warm in praise. They became friends, lunching together when Eliot was in New York and sharing a dry wit, conservative values, and a care for precision and technical proficiency. Moreover, as Cleo Kearns has argued, they undoubtedly influenced each other's work.\n\nEliot's review of Poems and Marriage, printed below, opens with a political definition: \"fine art is the refinement, not the antithesis, of popular art.\" Moore's art, he argues, is truly aristocratic in that it derives from and perfects a people's language. He identifies and praises three formal methods by which this occurs: \"a quite new rhythm,\" a \"peculiar and brilliant\" use of American jargon, and \"an almost primitive simplicity of phrase.\" Yet her brilliant and new techniques are brought to bear on an art firmly rooted in classical as well as American history. As with Barnes, Eliot carefully places Moore's \"individual talent\" within \"tradition.\"\n\nIt is all the more astonishing, then, to come upon the gratuitous \"compliment\" to Moore's \"feminine\" affiliation with Christina Rossetti, a poet with whom she would seem to have little else in common. Why, one wonders, can he \"never forget\" that their poems are by women? His insistence on this fact effectively contradicts his own argument; it both asserts an alternative writing outside the \"tradition\" of poets whose gender apparently can be forgotten and foregrounds their shared exclusion from that writing as well. Separated from canonical writers by the \"particularity\" of their womanhood, yet distinguished also from women writers whose \"particularity\" is not a \"positive virtue,\" they are left in isolation, idiosyncratic and indefinable.\n\nThat the Dial review reflects an unease with women as writers, to be overcome in a special case, is supported by a similar, if less emphatic, passage in Eliot's 1935 introduction to Moore's Selected Poems, also printed below. Here again he focuses on Moore's technical brilliance in relation to the past, coneluding Page 143 →with what must have been his highest encomium, that her poems are part of \"that small body of writings . . . engaged in maintaining the life of the English language.\" That this formal induction into the canon is an exception, however, is highlighted by reference to one other woman for the purpose not of establishing tradition but of denying it. H. D. appears as a possible \"slight influence\" on just one early poem, or at least more influence than any other practitioner of \"imagism\" whose aim \"so far as it had any\" was to concentrate on the visual. Both H. D. and the style with which she had been identified are introduced simply to be dismissed, in a reductive strategy emphasizing Moore's movement into more serious company.\n\nIn this introduction, as in the Dial review, Eliot appears to cut Moore out from the company of women and to place her unambiguously as an \"individual talent\" within the English literary tradition. Yet the ambivalence with which he must make such a claim emerges in seemingly irrelevant comparisons, either to connect her with another woman whose \"positive virtue\" transcends \"particularity\" or to disconnect her from possible membership in a trivializing women's tradition.\n\nWhile Eliot's admiration of Moore never waned, he partially withdrew his support of Bames. In 1957 he wrote an introduction for Antiphon with allusions to Nightwood so ambiguous and constrained that Barnes felt betrayed. Whether he felt her work had declined or whether her material placed too much pressure on his concerns with women writers is not clear, but the contrast to his undiminished praise of Moore suggests the greater ease with which the latter could be assimilated. Yet in both cases, by assimilation or intrusion, gender disrupts carefully constructed criteria of canonization by revealing the weirdness suppressed in transforming a \"particularity\" into simply a \"hard case.\"\n\nWORKS CITED\n\nAiken, Conrad. \"An Anatomy of Melancholy.\" New Republic 7 Feb. 1923.

I have already committed two such impertinences; this is the third, and if it is not the last no one will be more surprised than myself. I can justify this preface only in the following way. One is liable to expect other people to see, on their first reading of a book, all that one has come to perceive in the course of a developing intimacy with it. 1 have read Nightwood a number of times, in manuscript, in proof, and after publication. What one can do for other readers—assuming that if you read this preface at all you will read it first—is to trace the more significant phases of one's own appreciation of it. For it took me, with this book, some time to come to an appreciation of its meaning as a whole.\n\nIn describing Nightwood for the purpose of attracting readers to the English edition, I said that it would \"appeal primarily to readers of poetry.\" This is well enough for the brevity of advertisement, but I am glad to take this opportunity to amplify it a little. I do not want to suggest that the distinction of the book is primarily verbal, and still less that the astonishing language covers a vacuity of content. Unless the term \"novel\" has become too debased to apply, and if it means a book in which living characters are created and shown in significant relationship, this book is a novel. And I do not mean that Miss Barnes's style is \"poetic prose.\" But I do mean that most contemporary novels are not really \"written.\" They obtain what reality they have largely from an accurate rendering of the noises that human beings currently make in their daily simple needs of communication; and what part of a novel is not composed of these noises consists of a prose which is no more alive than that of a competent newspaper writer or government official. A prose that is altogether alive demands something of the reader that the ordinary novel-reader is not prepared to give. To say that Nightwood will appeal primarily to readers of poetry does not mean that it is not a novel, but that it is so good a novel that only sensibilities trained on poetry can wholly appreciate it. Miss Barnes's prose has the prose rhythm that is prose style, and the musical pattern which is not that of verse. This prose rhythm may be more or less complex or elaborate, according to the purposes of the writer; but whether simple or complex, it is what raises the matter to be communicated, to the first intensity.\n\nWhen I first read the book I found the opening movement rather slow and dragging, until the appearance of the doctor. And throughout the first reading, I was under the impression that it was the doctor alone who gave the book its vitality; and I believed the final chapter to be superfluous. I am now convinced that the final chapter is essential, both dramatically and musically. It was notable, however, that as the other characters, on repeated reading, became alive for me, and while the focus shifted, the figure of the doctor was by no means diminished. On the contrary, he came to take on a different and more profound importance when seen as a constituent of a whole pattern. He ceased to be like the brilliant actor in an otherwise unpersuasively performed play for whose reentrance Page 145 →one impatiently waits. However in actual life such a character might seem to engross conversation, quench reciprocity, and blanket less voluble people; in the book his role is nothing of the kind. At first we only hear the doctor talking; we do not understand why he talks. Gradually one comes to see that together with his egotism and swagger—Dr. Matthew-Mighty-grain-of-salt-Dante-O'Connor—he has also a desperate disinterestedness and a deep humility. His humility does not often appear so centrally as in the prodigious scene in the empty church, but it is what throughout gives him his helpless power among the helpless. His monologues, brilliant and witty in themselves as they are, are not dictated by an indifference to other human beings, but on the contrary by a hypersensitive awareness of them. When Nora comes to visit him in the night (Watchman, What of the Night?) he perceives at once that the only thing he can do for her (\"he was extremely put out, having expected someone else\")—the only way to \"save the situation\"—is to talk torrentially, even though she hardly takes in anything he says, but reverts again and again to her obsession. It is his revulsion against the strain of squeezing himself dry for other people, and getting no sustenance in return, that sends him raving at the end. The people in my life who have made my life miserable, coming to me to learn of degradation and the night. But most of the time he is talking to drown the still small wailing and whining of humanity, to make more supportable its shame and less ignoble its misery.\n\nIndeed, such a character as Doctor O'Connor could not be real alone in a gallery of dummies: such a character needs other real, if less conscious, people in order to realize his own reality. I cannot think of any character in the book who has not gone on living in my mind. Felix and his child are oppressively real. Sometimes in a phrase the characters spring to life so suddenly that one is taken aback, as if one had touched a wax-work figure and discovered that it was a live policeman. The doctor says to Nora, I was doing well enough until you kicked my stone over, and out I came, all moss and eyes. Robin Vote (the most puzzling of all, because we find her quite real without quite understanding the means by which the author has made her so) is the vision of an eland coming down an aisle of trees, chapleted with orange-blossoms and bridal veil, a hoof raised in the economy of fear; and later she has temples like those of young beasts cutting horns, as if they were sleeping eyes. Sometimes also a situation, which we had already comprehended loosely, is concentrated into a horror of intensity by a phrase, as when Nora suddenly thinks on seeing the doctor in bed, \"God, children know something they can't tell; they like Red Riding Hood and the wolf in bed!\"\n\nThe book is not simply a collection of individual portraits; the characters are all knotted together, as people are in real life, by what we may call chance or destiny, rather than by deliberate choice of each other's company: it is the whole pattern that they form, rather than any individual constituent, that is the focus of interest. We come to know them through their effect on each other, and by what they say to each other about the others. And finally, it ought to be superfluous to observe—but perhaps to anyone reading the book for the first time, it is not superfluous—that the book is not a psychopathic study. The miseries that people suffer through their particular abnormalities of temperament are visible on the Page 146 →surface: the deeper design is that of the human misery and bondage which is universal. In normal lives this misery is mostly concealed; often, what is most wretched of all, concealed from the sufferer more effectively than from the observer. The sick man does not know what is wrong with him; he partly wants to know, and mostly wants to conceal the knowledge from himself. In the Puritan morality that I remember, it was tacitly assumed that if one was thrifty, enterprising, intelligent, practical and prudent in not violating social conventions, one ought to have a happy and \"successful\" life. Failure was due to some weakness or perversity peculiar to the individual; but the decent man need have no nightmares. It is now rather more common to assume that all individual misery is the fault of \"society,\" and is remediable by alterations from without. Fundamentally the two philosophies, however different they may appear in operation, are the same. It seems to me that all of us, so far as we attach ourselves to created objects and surrender our wills to temporal ends, are eaten by the same worm. Taken in this way, Nightwood appears with profound significance. To regard this group of people as a horrid sideshow of freaks is not only to miss the point, but to confirm our wills and harden our hearts in an inveterate sin of pride.\n\nI should have considered the foregoing paragraph impertinent, and perhaps too pretentious for a preface meant to be a simple recommendation of a book I greatly admire, were it not that one review (at least), intended in praise of the book, has already appeared which would in effect induce the reader to begin with this mistaken attitude. Otherwise, generally, in trying to anticipate a reader's misdirections, one is in danger of provoking him to some other misunderstanding unforeseen. This is a work of creative imagination, not a philosophical treatise. As I said at the beginning, I am conscious of impertinence in introducing the book at all; and to have read a book a good many times does not necessarily put one in the right knowledge of what to say to those who have not yet read it. What I would leave the reader prepared to find is the great achievement of a style, the beauty of phrasing, the brilliance of wit and characterisation, and a quality of horror and doom very nearly related to that of Elizabethan tragedy.\n\nNightwood.

The Egoist Press, London.\n\nMARRIAGE (Manikin Number 3). By Marianne Moore. 10mo. 20 pages. Monroe Wheeler. $0.25.\n\nTwo years ago Miss Moore's book of Poems—so far as I know her only book—was published in London by The Egoist Press; and then I undertook to Page 147 →review it for The Dial. This promise, for one reason after another, I never fulfilled. Now another poem has appeared, Marriage, published by Manikin, printed apparently in Germany, and with a parenthetical introduction by Mr Glenway Wescott. Meanwhile I have read Miss Moore's poems a good many times, and always with exactly the same pleasure, and satisfaction in something quite definite and solid. Because of a promise which, because of the long delay, may be considered as having been broken, and because I can only, at the moment, think of five contemporary poets—English, Irish, American, French, and German—whose work excites me as much as, or more than, Miss Moore's, I find myself compelled to say something about them. Not that there is much that is usefully said about any new work of art—I do not rate criticism so highly; but one ought, in honesty, to publish one's beliefs.\n\nMr Wescott has, in fact, written a good introduction; I only think that his distinction between proletariat art and aristocratic art is an artificial and unimportant distinction with dangerous consequences. So far as a proletariat art is art at all, it is the same thing in essence as aristocratic art; but in general, and at the present time, the middle-class art (which is what I believe Mr Wescott to have in mind when he speaks of proletariat art—(the proletariat is middle class in America) is much more artificial than anything else; it plays with sham ideas, sham emotions, and even sham sensations. On the other hand a real aristocracy is essentially of the same blood as the people over whom it rules: a real aristocracy is not a Baltenland aristocracy of foreign race. This apparently purely political definition applies to art as well: fine art is the refinement, not the antithesis, of popular art. Miss Moore's poetry may not seem to confirm this statement. I agree with Mr Wescott that it is \"aristocratic,\" in that it can only please a very small number of people. But it is not, or not wholly, aristocratic in the Baltenland sense. I see in it at least three elements: a quite new rhythm, which I think is the most valuable thing; a peculiar and brilliant and rather satirical use of what is not, as material, an \"aristocratic\" language at all, but simply the curious jargon produced in America by universal university education—that jargon which makes it impossible for Americans to talk for half an hour without using the terms of psychoanalysis, and which has introduced \"moron\" as more forcible than \"idiot\"; and finally an almost primitive simplicity of phrase. There may be more. Up to the present time Miss Moore has concerned herself with practising and perfecting a given formation of elements; it will depend, I think, on her ability to shatter this formation and painfully reconstruct, whether Miss Moore makes another invention equal in merit to the first.\n\nRhythm, of course, is a highly personal matter; it is not a verse-form. It is always the real pattern in the carpet, the scheme of organization of thought, feeling, and vocabulary, the way in which everything comes together. It is very uncommon. What is certain is that Miss Moore's poems always read very well aloud. That quality is something which no system of scansion can define. It is not separable from the use of words, in Miss Moore's case the conscious and complete appreciations of every word, and in relation to every other word, as it goes by. I think that Those Various Scalpels is an excellent example for study. Here the rhythm depends partly upon the transformation-changes from one Page 148 →image to another, so that the second image is superposed before the first has quite faded, and upon the dexterity of change of vocabulary from one image to another. \"Snow sown by tearing winds on the cordage of disabled ships:\" has that Latin, epigrammatic succinctness, laconic austerity, which leaps out unexpectedly (altogether in Talisman).\n\n\"your raised hand an\n\nambiguous signature:\"\n\nis a distinct shift of manner; it is not an image, but the indication of a fulness of meaning which is unnecessary to pursue.\n\n\"blood on the stone floors of French châteaux, with\n\nregard to which guides are so affirmative:\"\n\nis a satirical (consciously or unconsciously it does not matter) refinement of that pleasantry (not flippancy, which is something with a more definite purpose) of speech which characterizes the American language, that pleasantry, uneasy, solemn, or self-conscious, which inspires both the jargon of the laboratory and the slang of the comic strip. Miss Moore works this uneasy language of stereotypes—as of a whole people playing uncomfortably at clenches and clevelandisms—with impeccable skill into her pattern. She uses words like \"fractional,\" \"vertical,\" \"infinitesimal,\" \"astringently\"; phrases like \"excessive popularity,\" \"a liability rather than an asset,\" \"mask of profundity,\" \"vestibule of experience,\" \"diminished vitality,\" \"arrested prosperity.\" If this were all, Miss Moore would be no different from her imitators. The merit consists in the combination, in the other point of view which Miss Moore possesses at the same time. What her imitators cannot get are the swift dissolving images, like the mussel shell\n\n\"opening and shutting itself like\n\nan\n\ninjured fan\"\n\nand phrases like\n\n\"the sea when it proffers flattery in exchange for hemp\n\nrye, flax, horses, platinum, timber and fur.\"\n\n\"Truth is no Apollo\n\nBelvedere, no formal thing. The wave may go over it if it likes.\"\n\nor a magnificence of phrase like\n\n\"I recall their magnificence, now not more magnificent than it is dim\"\n\nPage 149 →\n\n(how like Valery's \"entre les pins palpite, entre les tombes\" or like his “éternellement, Eternellement le bout mordre\"). And also they cannot imitate her animals and birds—\n\n\"the parrakeet—\n\n. . . destroying\n\nbark and portions of the food it could not eat.\"\n\nMr Wescott, if he agrees with all or even with a part of what I have written, will probably consider it as an affirmation of his belief in a kind of \"aristocratic\" art drawing no sustenance from the soil. \"An aristocratic art, emulating the condition of ritual.\" But of course all art emulates the condition of ritual. That is what it comes from and to that it must always return for nourishment. And nothing belongs more properly to the people than ritual—or indeed than aristocracy itself, a popular invention to serve popular needs. (I suppose the Ku Klux Klan is a popular ritual—as popular as a ritual can be in a country where there are only variations within the middle class.) Miss Moore's relation to the soil is not a simple one, or rather it is to various soils—to that of Latium and to that of Attica I believe (or at least to that of the Aegean littoral) as well as most positively to the soil (well top-dressed) of America. There are several reasons (buried in this essay) why Miss Moore's poetry is almost completely neglected in England, beside the simple reason that it is too good, \"in this age of hard striving,\" to be appreciated anywhere.\n\nAnd there is one final, and \"magnificent\" compliment: Miss Moore's poetry is as \"feminine\" as Christina Rossetti's, one never forgets that it is written by a woman; but with both one never thinks of this particularity as anything but a positive virtue.\n\nDial 75.6 (1923): 594-597.\n\nIntroduction to Marianne Moore's\n\nSelected Poems\n\nWe know very little about the value of the work of our contemporaries, almost as little as we know about our own. It may have merits which exist only for contemporary sensibility; it may have concealed virtues which will only become apparent with time. How it will rank when we are all dead authors ourselves we cannot say with any precision. If one is to talk about one's contemporaries at all, therefore, it is important to make up our minds as to what we can affirm with confidence, and as to what must be a matter of doubting conjecture. The last Page 150 →thing, certainly, that we are likely to know about them is their \"greatness\", or their relative distinction or triviality in relation to the standard of \"greatness\". For in greatness are involved moral and social relations, relations which can only be perceived from a remoter perspective, and which may be said even to be created in the process of history: we cannot tell, in advance, what any poetry is going to do, how it will operate upon later generations. But the genuineness of poetry is something which we have some warrant for believing that a small number, but only a small number, of contemporary readers can recognise. I say positively only a small number, because it seems probable that when any poet conquers a really large public in his lifetime, an increasing proportion of his admirers will admire him for extraneous reasons. Not necessarily for bad reasons, but because he becomes known merely as a symbol, in giving a kind of stimulation or consolation, to his readers, which is a function of his peculiar relation to them in time. Such effect upon contemporary readers may be a legitimate and proper result of some great poetry, but it has been also the result of much ephemeral poetry.\n\nIt does not seem to matter much whether one has to struggle with an age which is unconscious and self-satisfied, and therefore hostile to new forms of poetry, or with one like the present which is self-conscious and distrustful of itself, and avid for new forms which will give it status and self-respect. For many modem readers any superficial novelty of form is evidence of, or is as good as, newness of sensibility; and if the sensibility is fundamentally dull and secondhand, so much the better; for there is no quicker way of catching an immediate, if transient, popularity, than to serve stale goods in new packages. One of the tests—though it be only a negative test—of anything really new and genuine, seems to be its capacity for exciting aversion among \"lovers of poetry\".\n\nI am aware that prejudice makes me underrate certain authors: I see them rather as public enemies than as subjects for criticism; and I dare say that a different prejudice makes me uncritically favourable to others. I may even admire the right authors for the wrong reasons. But I am much more confident of my appreciation of the authors whom I admire, than of my depreciation of the authors who leave me cold or who exasperate me. And in asserting that what I call genuineness is a more important thing to recognise in a contemporary than greatness, I am distinguishing between his function while living and his function when dead. Living, the poet is carrying on that struggle for the maintenance of a living language, for the maintenance of its strength, its subtlety, for the preservation of quality of feeling, which must be kept up in every generation; dead, he provides standards for those who take up the struggle after him. Miss Moore is, I believe, one of those few who have done the language some service in my lifetime.\n\nSo far back as my memory extends, which is to the pages of The Egoist during the War, and of The Little Review and The Dial in the years immediately following, Miss Moore has no immediate poetic derivations. I cannot, therefore, fill up my pages with the usual account of influences and development. There is one early poem, A Talisman, not reprinted in the text of this volume, which I will Page 151 →quote in full here, because it suggests a slight influence of H.D., certainly of H.D. rather than of any other \"Imagist\":\n\nUnder a splintered mast\n\nTorn from the ship and cast\n\nNear her hull,\n\nA stumbling shepherd found\n\nEmbedded in the ground,\n\nA sea-gull\n\nOf lapis-lazuli,\n\nA scarab of the sea,\n\nWith wings spread—\n\nCurling its coral feet,\n\nParting its beak to greet\n\nMen long dead.\n\nThe sentiment is commonplace, and I cannot see what a bird carved of lapis-lazuli should be doing with coral feet; but even here the cadence, the use of rhyme, and a certain authoritativeness of manner distinguish the poem. Looking at Miss Moore's poems of a slightly later period, I should say that she had taken to heart the repeated reminder of Mr. Pound: that poetry should be as well written as prose. She seems to have saturated her mind in the perfections of prose, in its precision rather than its purple; and to have found her rhythm, her poetry, her appreciation of the individual word, for herself.\n\nThe first aspect in which Miss Moore's poetry is likely to strike the reader is that of minute detail rather than that of emotional unity. The gift for detailed observation, for finding the exact words for some experience of the eye, is liable to disperse the attention of the relaxed reader. The minutiae may even irritate the unwary, or arouse in them only the pleasurable astonishment evoked by the carved ivory ball with eleven other balls inside it, the full-rigged ship in a bottle, the skeleton of the crucifix-fish. The bewilderment consequent upon trying to follow so alert an eye, so quick a process of association, may produce the effect of some \"metaphysical\" poetry. To the moderately intellectual the poems may appear to be intellectual exercises; only to those whose intellection moves more easily will they immediately appear to have emotional value. But the detail has always its service to perform to the whole. The similes are there for use; as the mussel-shell \"opening and shutting itself like an injured fan\" (where injured has an ambiguity good enough for Mr. Empson), the waves \"as formal as the scales on a fish\". They make us see the object more clearly, though we may not understand immediately why our attention has been called to this object, and though we may not immediately grasp its association with a number of other objects. So, in her amused and affectionate attention to animals—from the domestic cat, or \"to popularize the mule\", to the most exotic strangers from the tropics, she succeeds at once in startling us into an unusual awareness of visual patterns, with something like the fascination of a high-powered microscope.\n\nPage 152 →\n\nMiss Moore's poetry, or most of it, might be classified as \"descriptive\" rather than \"lyrical\" or \"dramatic\". Descriptive poetry is supposed to be dated to a period, and to be condemned thereby; but it is really one of the permanent modes of expression. In the eighteenth century—or say a period which includes Cooper's Hill, Windsor Forest, and Gray's Elegy—the scene described is a point of departure for meditations on one thing or another. The poetry of the Romantic Age, from Byron at his worst to Wordsworth at his best, wavers between the reflective and the evocative; but the description, the picture set before you, is always there for the same purpose. The aim of \"imagism\", so far as I understand it, or so far as it had any, was to induce a peculiar concentration upon something visual, and to set in motion an expanding succession of concentric feelings. Some of Miss Moore's poems—for instance with animal or bird subjects—have a very wide spread of association. It would be difficult to say what is the \"subjectmatter\" of The Jerboa. For a mind of such agility, and for a sensibility so reticent, the minor subject, such as a pleasant little sand-coloured skipping animal, may be the best release for the major emotions. Only the pedantic literalist could consider the subject-matter to be trivial; the triviality is in himself. We all have to choose whatever subject-matter allows us the most powerful and most secret release; and that is a personal affair.\n\nThe result is often something that the majority will call frigid; for feeling in one's own way, however intensely, is likely to look like frigidity to those who can only feel in accepted ways.\n\nThe deepest feeling always shows itself in silence;\n\nnot in silence, but restraint.\n\nIt shows itself in a control which makes possible the fusion of the ironic-conversational and the high-rhetorical, as\n\nI recall their magnificence, now not more magnificent\n\nthan it is dim. It is difficult to recall the ornament,\n\nspeech, and precise manner of what one might\n\ncall the minor acquaintances twenty\n\nyears back. . . .\n\nstrict with tension, malignant\n\nin its power over us and deeper\n\nthan the sea when it proffers flattery in exchange\n\nfor hemp,\n\nrye, flax, horses, platinum, timber and fur.\n\nAs one would expect from the kind of activity which I have been trying to indicate, Miss Moore's versification is anything but \"free\". Many of the poems are in exact, and sometimes complicated, formal patterns, and move with the elegance of a minuet (\"Elegance\", indeed, is one of her certain attributes.) Some of the poems (e.g. Marriage, An Octopus) are unrhymed; in others (e.g. Sea Unicorns and Land Unicorns) rhyme or assonance is introduced irregularly; in a Page 153 →number of the poems rhyme is part of a regular pattern interwoven with unrhymed endings. Miss Moore's use of rhyme is in itself a definite innovation in metric.\n\nIn the conventional forms of rhyme the stress given by the rhyme tends to fall in the same place as the stress given by the sense. The extreme case, at its best, is the pentameter couplet of Pope. Poets before and after Pope have given variety, sometimes at the expense of smoothness, by deliberately separating the stresses, from time to time; but this separation—often effected simply by longer periods or more involved syntax—can hardly be considered as more than a deviation from the norm for the purpose of avoiding monotony. The tendency of some of the best contemporary poetry is of course to dispense with rhyme altogether; but some of those who do use it have used it here and there to make a pattern directly in contrast with the sense and rhythm pattern, to give a greater intricacy. Some of the internal rhyming of Hopkins is to the point. (Genuine or auditory internal rhyme must not be confused with false or visual internal rhyme. If a poem reads just as well when cut up so that all the rhymes fall at the end of lines, then the internal rhyme is false and only a typographical caprice, as in Oscar Wilde's Sphinx.) This rhyme, which forms a pattern against the metric and sense pattern of the poem, may be either heavy or light—that is to say, either heavier or lighter than the other pattern. The two kinds, heavy and light, have doubtless different uses which remain to be explored. Of the light rhyme Miss Moore is the greatest living master; and indeed she is the first, so far as I know, who has investigated its possibilities. It will be observed that the effect sometimes requires giving a word a slightly more analytical pronunciation, or stressing a syllable more than ordinarily:\n\nal-\n\nways has been—at the antipodes from the init\n\nial great truths. \"Part of it was crawling, part of it\n\nwas about to crawl, the rest\n\nwas torpid in its lair.\" In the short-legged, fit\n\nful advance. . . .\n\nIt is sometimes obtained by the use of articles as rhyme words:\n\nan\n\ninjured fan.\n\nThe barnacles which encrust the side\n\nof the wave, cannot hide . . .\n\nthe\n\nturquoise sea\n\nof bodies. The water drives a wedge . . .\n\nIn a good deal of what is sometimes (with an unconscious theological innuendo) called \"modernist\" verse one finds either an excess or a defect of technical attention. The former appears in an emphasis upon words rather than Page 154 →things, and the latter in an emphasis upon things and an indifference to words. In either case, the poem is formless, just as the most accomplished sonnet, if it is an attempt to express matter unsuitable for sonnet form, is formless. But a precise fitness of form and matter mean also a balance between them: thus the form, the pattern movement, has a solemnity of its own (e.g. Shakespeare's songs), however light and gay the human emotion concerned; and a gaiety of its own, however serious or tragic the emotion. The choruses of Sophocles, as well as the songs of Shakespeare, have another concern besides the human action of which they are spectators, and without this other concern there is not poetry. And on the other hand, if you aim only at the poetry in poetry, there is no poetry either.\n\nMy conviction, for what it is worth, has remained unchanged for the last fourteen years: that Miss Moore's poems form part of the small body of durable poetry written in our time; of that small body of writings, among what passes for poetry, in which an original sensibility and alert intelligence and deep feeling have been engaged in maintaining the life of the English language.\n\nThe original suggestion was that I should make a selection, from both previously published and more recent poems. But Miss Moore exercised her own rights of proscription first, so drastically, that I have been concerned to preserve rather than abate. I have therefore hardly done more than settle the order of the contents. This book contains all that Miss Moore was willing to reprint from the volume Observations (The Dial Press, New York, 1924), together with the poems written since that date which she is willing to publish.\n\nSelected Poems.
