        "text": ": Thomas Stearns Eliot, the man of letters, had an unfathomable religious sensibility. His quest for belief holds together the diversified elements of the modern man’s fragmented being and gives a sense of direction in his life. The paper aims to explore the life span of T. S. Eliot, his work and age which leads to the various stages of social and economic changes in mindset of modern society. His work which is known to be milestone of the literature implies the strong impact on the contemporary writer. His writing generated the interest in the society to blend and open up the thoughts of east and west. It gives the acute sense of divinity which indulge into the ocean of the positivity and peace of mind in the modern but deviated society.\n\nAt the present paper, we aim at explaining T.S. Eliot’s own poetry considering his own essays on the art of writing poetry. Thomas Stern Eliot (1888-1965) was a British essayist, publisher, playwright, literary and social critic, being regarded “one of the twentieth century’s major poets” (Bush, 1999) in the English language. Eliot’s poetry was seen as representative of the Modernist movement, beginning with The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufock (1915) and followed by some of the best-known poems, including The Waste Land (1922), The Hollow Men (1925), Ash Wednesday (1930) and Four Quartets (1943), among others. He was also known for his work as a playwright, although he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948 due to his pioneer contribution to nowadays poetry. T.S. Eliot also made significant contributions to the field of literary criticism, strongly influencing the school of New Criticism. It is, in fact, this arena of the literary criticism the main topic which will be dealt throughout the whole paper. In the current essay, we will explain Eliot’s critical ideas, in other words, what he conceives of poetry and the art on writing poetry, and how his own critical ideas influence on his own poetry. The poet introduces the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist’s previous works. He also covers the idea of an objective correlative which shall be dealt with in this paper. We should also consider that Eliot revived, when writing his own poetry, the interest in the Metaphysical Poets as well as in Shakespeare and, specifically, in Hamlet. After having explained the existing relationship between his own criticism and his own poetry, we will conclude the current paper by explaining what Eliot conceives of the concept of communicating.\n\n• Eliot was born in 1888, in St. Louis, Missouri. He was a bright and hardworking student, who experienced a classical, wide−ranging education. Eliot studied philosophy and French literature at Harvard. In 1909 he graduated from Harvard with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy, and he finished his master’s degree in philosophy a year later. Over the next six years, he pursued further graduate studies in philosophy at a number of institutions in the United States and Europe, including Harvard, the Paris Sorbonne, Marburg in Germany, and Merton College, Oxford, ultimately completing his dissertation in 1916. • During the period of his studies, he met two people who would prove to be influential to his writing. The first was fellow poet Ezra Pound, who became Eliot’s friend, mentor, and editor. The second was Vivien Haigh−Wood, who was a British ballet dancer, whom he met and married in 1915 while studying in England. He and Vivien settled in London the same year, but they experienced a troubled relationship from the start, due in a large part to Vivien’s neurotic illnesses. The dark tone of Eliot’s poetry during the 1910s and 1920s is often attributed to his marriage. In 1915 Eliot started teaching in London. In 1917 Eliot left teaching to work in the Colonial and Foreign Department as clerk at Lloyds Bank in London, a position he held until 1925. At the same time, he became assistant editor of the Egoist (1917–1919), a literary magazine, in which he published Prufrock, and Other Observations (1917).\n\nAt the outset of my paper I will put forth how the nature of the modern world can be best interpreted if one's reading admits the conditional mode of such approximation. Such an exercise will enable me to explore Eliot's early poems which refuse to get pigeonhole in any watertight critical compartment. In this paper I use the phrase \"death of the author\" in a more general sense than the one assumed in Roland Barthes celebrated essay The Death of the Author (1967). Probably inspired by the postmodernists' extensive practice of authors rewriting previous texts, Roland Barthes declared the Author dead to all times and cultures. However, I am set out to bring arguments against Barthes' contention, that \"a writer no longer contains within himself passions, humors, sentiments, impressions, but that enormous dictionary, from which he derives a writing which can know no end or halt[...]\" (1967) by reading the select poems of T.S. Eliot in tandem with his life to present how such an activity can generate newer ways of engaging with them, as the 'text' of the poet's life can also be a constituent of what we term as 'context.' While scrutinising these poems, I will highlight how the poet's detachment from his subject and his deep involvement simultaneously go together. The proof in my argument is provided by T.S. Eliot's statement, \"But of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to escape from these things\" from his celebrated essay Tradition and Individual Talent (1919). Furthermore, I use the term \"impersonality\" in a general vein, though I am well aware that the modernists' professed poetics of \"impersonality\" (in a line descending from Baudelaire through Mallarme to T.S. Eliot) is, however, somehow at loggerheads with their prioritizing of the self over the other, or what Virginia Woolf understood by \"moths\" and \"middlebrows\" getting in the way of the elect."
