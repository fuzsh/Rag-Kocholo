        "text": "“Poetic originality is largely an original way of assembling the most disparate and unlikely material to make a new whole.”\n\nT.S Eliot was one of the twentieth century’s major poets primarily due to the way his unique poetic style changed the face of Modernism. He wrote poetry using different styles and images which differed distinctly all through the whole of his poetic career. Eliot used paradox throughout his poetry, and also wrote theory on the notion of bringing together disparate ideas in order to create something new. Many of these contrasting notions come from the various voices he uses throughout his poetry, such as, and most famously in, The Waste Land. Eliot’s name is that which is largely associated with Modernism, and this is largely due to his approach on bringing notions and voices – polar opposites at face value – and having them coalesce; an idea adopted from the Metaphysical poetry of John Donne, George Herbert and Andrew Marvell amongst many. What truly makes Eliot’s poetry modern is the variety of such disparate ideas and voices, ‘and the way Eliot builds extraordinary bridges between the voices, the tones and the dramatic levels.’ This can be noticed from Eliot’s early poetry such as ‘The Love Song of Alfred J. Prufrock,’ to his monumental The Waste Land, and also in his later poetry, showing that although Eliot may have changed some aspects of his poetry in terms of style and theme, he retained that aspect that was most integral to him: keeping poetry modern.\n\nIn ‘Tradition and the Individual Talent,’ Eliot changed the way poetry was to be written and read. The essay was a cultural indictment about the importance of art. Here, Eliot attempts to reconcile the two contrasting and disparate ideas; that of tradition and individuality. Tradition is that which connects society to the past, something which seems contradictory to individuality at face value; they stand on opposing poles. However, tradition for Eliot was ‘not a rule to be followed, but a largely unconscious inheritance,’ which is continually modified within the poet. The way forward was to combine the two notions. Eliot wanted to make a case for tradition without parting from the idea of individual talent. He begins by outlining the misconception people have of praising artists who bring forth completely new compositions forward, ‘dwell[ing] with satisfaction upon those poet’s difference from his predecessors; we endeavour to find something that can be isolated in order to be enjoyed.’ Contrarily, it is only when ‘we approach a poet without his prejudice’ that one will find ‘that not only the best, but the most individual parts of his work may be in those in which the dead poets, his ancestors, assert their immorality most vigorously.’ Like Pound and other modernists, Eliot was invested in those paradoxes of tradition in relation to creativity in that ‘the most original talent is not only bound to tradition but is to most likely reaffirm it.’ Eliot’s essay explains that for one to be contemporary, one must be in touch with the history of art thus far as well as the present. Thus, the artist must obtain a ‘historical sense of perception, not only of its past, but of its presence.’ Eliot’s sense of modernism comes through in this essay since it highlights his core beliefs on poetry and the poet. The correlative principle is that no artist has complete meaning in isolation, but must be judged ‘for contrast and comparison, among the dead.’ Eliot’s other criticisms and poetry rest heavily on this theory where ‘the past should be altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past.’ His poetry thus abounds with echoes of the great works of literature, and oftentimes these are merged together in a seemingly disoriented way. However, the new links that are formed between these classical tales establish new relationships out of seeming contradictions, and ‘present to the mind of the reader a parallel, by means of contrast.’ ‘The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock’ exhibits the roots of this philosophy, containing the fragmented thoughts of the protagonist Prufrock, while he is struggling to conduct himself in a social situation. Discordant contrasts are more evident in Eliot’s later poetry, which further develops the bridging of these contrasting ideas. The Waste Land itself can be thought of ‘as a sequence of attempts to unify the world through the unification of individuals.’ The one-eyed merchant merges into the Phoenician sailor – the latter being not so wholly different from Ferdinand of Naples. Similarly, the women in the poem are one woman, emblematic for the entire gender. The two sexes meet in the profit, Tiresias, who is ‘throbbing between two lives’; an ‘Old man with wrinkled female breasts.’ The Waste Land established a new mode of writing through its disparate connections. Eliot purposely interweaved fragments from different texts in order for readers to glimpse at the traditions of the past. The goal for a poem such as The Waste Land was partly to allow people to see the connections and knowing the past – where references were taken from – and to make new connections in relation to the modern world. Eliot’s connections significantly changed Modern poetry. The Wasteland became ‘the poem from which most modern verse in English has flowed – the poem every poet today finds in [their] path, the poem that once and for all changed our idea of what to expect of a modern poem and a modern world.’\n\nEliot succeeded in bringing together disparate ideas and voices together firstly by looking back to his predecessors, and applying fragments from their poetry to his own. His poetry, most famously The Waste Land, is filled with fragments taken out of older literature and placed in a new context. As Eliot declared himself in his essays, the poet does not have complete meaning alone. Looking back to one’s ancestors, all the while being a part of the present day, would allow an ordinary writer to transcend into a true contemporary. In his essay ‘What Dante Means to Me,’ Eliot continues this line of thought by using Dante in his poetry in order ‘to establish a relationship between the medieval inferno and modern life.’ Here, again, Eliot is seen taking two things that do not seem to fit together well, Medieval past and modernity – creating a bridge where they are not yoked together, as how Ben Jonson seems to think of disparate ideas, yet merged to create a new idea. This philosophy is found in many of Eliot’s critical papers can be seen even in his pre-Waste Land poems. ‘The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock’ is an early work where Eliot depicts the fragmentation of modern life through the displaced images in Prufrock’s narrative. The fragments in his later poetry all interconnect to depict a new and modern way of understanding the twentieth century. In poems such as The Waste Land and Four Quartets, Eliot illustrated the fragmentation of the society he lived in through images showcasing disconnectedness, all the while simultaneously creating a sense of hope for a better and united world.\n\nIn the year 1922, Eliot’s The Waste Land was published. It was also a year where many Modernist movements occurred and when the aftermath of The First World War set the tone for what followed. The poem itself produced a sense of shock. The Waste Land both ‘extended and dislodged tradition’; it broke away from Romantic poetry and instead returned to the wit of the Metaphysical poets. Eliot’s notion of marrying two polar opposite ideas and having them coalesce is one taken from the poetry of John Donne, George Herbert and Andrew Marvell. Eliot saw that the Metaphysical poets managed to capture seemingly disparate concepts and uniting them; they were able to ‘feel their thought[s] as immediately as the odour of a rose. […] When a poet's mind is perfectly equipped for its work, it is constantly amalgamating disparate experience; the ordinary man's experience is chaotic, irregular, fragmentary.’ The Metaphysical poets used conceits, in which the ideas they expressed in their poems had no clear-cut connection between them. In one of John Donne’s poems, ‘A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning,’ the physical separation of two lovers is compared to a compass: ‘Our two souls, therefore, […]/ If they be two, they are two so, / As stiff twin compasses are two.’ Eliot argues that conceits go further than merely comparing two unrelated ideas – they create ‘a development by rapid association of thought which requires considerable agility on the mind of the reader. ’ In his essay on the Metaphysical poets, Eliot emphasizes how ‘the most powerful effect is produced by the sudden contrasts of associations,’ and this is reflected in his own poetry. The Waste Land, for example, is filled with so many allusions that it is still to this day very much open to interpretation. While the poem’s contemporaries looked upon the poem as radical and meaningless, new readers are astounded by the shifting tones and alternating voices. Critics today still argue on which voice dominates the poem, if any. The poem treats myth, religion, history, and art as subject to the same fragmentation as it does modern life. Nothing escapes ‘the cruellest month’ of April, which mixes ‘Memory with desire, stirring / Dull roots with spring rain.’ Ultimately, what makes Eliot’s poetry unique and modern is his ability to unite these voices and tones, as well as the poem’s many allusions.\n\nDisparate and contradictory notions are more evident in Eliot’s later poetry, however, there are elements which come through in his early poetry which pre-empt his later thoughts. Eliot’s ‘The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock’ is one of Eliot’s significant early poems in which his style of modernism is set, and in which the rest of his poetry follows. It reinforces and varies ‘the note of boredom with different images of staleness.’ Eliot explains the effect of ‘Prufrock’ in ‘Tradition and the Individual Talent.’ The individual parts of all aspects of poetry are affected by a wholly new element which is added on to it. ‘Prufrock’ is not like Eliot’s later poetry where contradictory notions are placed alongside one another in a seemingly strange unison. However, Prufrock’s voice is that which lingers throughout Eliot’s entire career. The poetry post-Prufrock becomes even more fragmented so, by the time Eliot came to writing The Waste Land, the voice in the poem had completely disintegrated. Eliot’s Prufrock’ is ‘originary in the way it prompts succeeding poems to readjust their relations, propositions, [and] values,’ and sets the tone for the poet’s modernist style. Besides its fragmentary themes, the poem’s form highlights the characteristics of modern poetry. Eliot was highly influenced by the French symbolists who thought that it was impossible to use conventional language to describe and depict sensations as they are experienced. For this reason, Eliot argued that poets should look for a way to express their emotions through an ‘objective correlative’: ‘in other words, a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall be the formula of that particular emotion; such that when the external facts, which must terminate in sensory experience, are given, the emotion is immediately evoked.’ Thus, through the use of the objective correlative, Eliot mirrors the style of Donne, Herbert and other Metaphysical poets alike. He has found a way to be able to connect a variety of elements together, building bridges between seemingly disparate notions. The poem is littered with symbols, all of which represent certain emotions. The corruption of city life is described with the imagery of ‘half-deserted streets,’ ‘cheap hotels,’ and ‘sawdust restaurants,’ while the ‘yellow fog’ can be identified as the objective correlative for the protagonist’s inertness. Eliot’s use of figurative language in this poem reflects his fragmentation from the rest of society. One example is the way Eliot discusses humanity through a conceit using human body parts; the reference to detached body parts – hair, hands, eyes, faces – reinforces the idea of the loss of humanity by reducing human beings to fragments. Prufrock seems to think of himself only in terms of the ‘bald spot in the middle of [his] hair.’ He worries about the face he must present to the world; even though his ‘necktie is rich and modest,’ he worries about what ‘[t]hey will say: ‘But how his arms and legs are thin!’ This objective correlative in ‘Prufrock,’ ‘implies that people are isolated from each other just like their body parts in the modern world and this leads to loneliness among people.’ Furthermore, the poem abounds\n\nwith fragmented sentences such as,\n\nAnd time yet for a hundred indecisions,\n\nAnd for a hundred visions and revisions,\n\nBefore the taking of a toast and tea.\n\nAccording to Güven, the fragmentation in these lines correlate with the inconsistency and dissonance of modern life. Additionally, the unequal number of lines and speech rhythms indicate the chaos which occurred during the twentieth century. The poem ends where it began, with Prufrock unable to explain himself; ‘It is impossible to say what I mean!’ Eliot’s most important achievement with ‘Prufrock,’ lay in the new poetic tone it produced. Eliot broke away with ‘the traditional voice, intonation, and cadence of previous verse. His new tone was angular, difficult and complex.’ As with Eliot’s later poetry, the disparate lines, and images in ‘Prufrock’ aim to merge different aspects of the modern world together, and form a new unified whole. It is not about highlighting separate features of the twentieth century, however, producing diverging images beside each other emphasizing its entirety. Thus, Eliot created a style through ‘Prufrock’ which was original through its disparate imagery and which, in doing so, spoke volumes about modern culture.\n\nThere are themes which are shared at the end of Eliot’s poetic career which were present at the very beginning, such as with ‘Prufrock,’ the opening poem of his first book. ‘Prufrock’ is divided into an outward personality and a thinking, sensitive inert being. Already in his poetry, there is a dissociation between the inner self and the outer personality; his inner-self and the relationship with the world is portrayed as a sharp contrast to the timid, nervous man who worries how he may appear to others, ‘My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin – / (They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!).’ It is a dissociation which ‘is continually ascribed to a failure of nerve, an essential timidity.’ There lies this timidity in many of Eliot’s other poems, such as the speaker in The Wasteland, who fails to address the hyacinth girl. The speaker recalls when he meets the hyacinth girl for the second time, ‘when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,/ Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not/ Speak’. Similarly, is hollow men are hypnotized by eyes they ‘dare[d] not meet in dreams.’ According to J.C.C Mays, ‘Eliot's heroes fail to confront their own selfhood from the beginning, whether this is conceived as a Dantesque heart of light or a Conradian heart of darkness.’ Throughout Eliot’s literary career, he has portrayed a variety of distinct voices. With ‘Prufrock’, there lay a ‘dandyish irony’; the polyphonic Waste Land; and the meditative tone of Eliot’s later religious poetry. This begs the question as to which poetic voice should be characterized as ‘the real Eliot.’ According to Malcolm Bradbury, the answer to this lay ‘in the variety itself, and the way Eliot builds extraordinary bridges between the voices, the tones, and the dramatic levels.’ Certainly, it is this way with his poetry; Eliot’s ability to connect disparate notions to coalesce into new meaning is his defining characteristic as a modernist writer. Thus, the movement in his poetic style may be thought of in the same way. For one of the reasons Eliot is such a monumental figure in the twentieth century is that he was always seeking to define ‘what kind of creature the poet of modernity might be.’ In his essay on Donne and the other Metaphysical poets, Eliot claims that ‘when a poet’s mind is perfectly equipped for its work, it is constantly amalgamating disparate experiences […] in the mind of the poet these experiences are always forming new wholes.’ Eliot established the need for the modern poet to be able to recover a ‘wholeness of sensibility, a modern “wit,” where thought and feeling are reconciled.’\n\nThe Waste Land is a poem in which many things converge. Eliot incorporates many myths into the poem, at times placing them adjacent to mundane scenes, such as when the rape of Philomela in ‘A Game of Chess’ is alluded to again – ‘jug jug jug jug jug jug/ So rudely forc’d’ – as the love scene between the typist and her lover takes place in the ‘The Fire Sermon.’ The structure of the poem is not a consistent narrative; it takes the reader from the collapsing of huge empires to the pitfalls faced in a rudimentary urban life, leading to a vision of possible salvation, while cities fall. ‘If the detail here is difficult, the underlying myth of a search of a search for fertility and redemption is not hard to see.’ Eliot ends his poem by quoting Sanskrit, the first known language to be spoken and written. He is tying the end of the world with the beginning, as well as providing a possibility of salvation for the collapsing modern world.\n\nThe fragments of older poetry taken by Eliot to compose his pieces make their content disparate. The method of fragmentation ‘was a way of relating the past to the present, the mythic and religious sensibility to the world of the mundane, the history of art to its contemporary task.’ In fact, the poem can be said to be made up almost entirely of different fragments, such as in the epigraph of the myth of the Sybil from Ovid to its allusions to Dante. The opening reference to the cruel April month ‘mixing/ Memory and desire,’ can be attributed to Dante’s lament for Francesca caught with her lover, Paolo, in the pit of Lust in Hell, in Canto V. This allusion is relevant to Eliot as it suggests a relationship between Dante’s Hell of desire experienced by the lovers and the poet’s Hell of desire which stunts creativity. Due to its many allusions and connections, the poem’s narrative appears inconsistent; The Waste Land ‘is a poem of anti-climax, of contemporary sterility, and it is, therefore,tempting to read all its many poetic echoes and illusions as a series of parodies, where the poetic dignities of the past are mocked by the vulgarities of the present.’ Thus, the lyrical quality is set there to create an opposite effect – ‘O the moon shone bright on Mrs Porter / And on her daughter / They wash their feet in soda water.’ However, the pattern of the poem is more complex. Several of the five sections begin by drawing upon and making a pastiche of the literature of the past, such as the very beginning of the poem where Eliot draws upon the April month in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales and changes the April of regeneration as it being ‘the cruellest month.’ These images then move on to a variety of scenes from the modern world, displaying modern despair and sterility. What lay behind these lyric arrests are evocations of pain and suffering, modern fragility and the suffocating presence of endless anxiety. Precisely due to these elements within the poem, Malcolm Bradbury asserts that Eliot ‘becomes the great lyricist of the fragile sensitivities of the present.’ The poem’s broken images, seemingly contradictory and disparate, are used to create the desolate and fragmented image of a wasteland. The wasteland Eliot depicts is a moral one, however, it is also intellectual, socio-political, as well as physical because nothing grows out of the earth except for dead bodies, ‘That corpse you planted last year in your garden, / Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?’ Eliot’s declaration that the modern poet should reconcile intellect and feeling to create a new disparate awareness – one that encompasses not one aspect of modernity but many – is most clear in The Waste Land. Tiresias, the ‘old man with wrinkled dugs,’ is there to serve this function. This sense of the double-gender allows him to read the world from two points of view, reconciling and integrating not only the male and the female, yet the past and present, and ‘the relation of things foretold to the events of time.’\n\nThe Waste Land went through countless amounts of Ezra Pound’s edits one being the poem’s original epigraph. One of the most disparate insights in Eliot’s poem is the change he made in the epigraph to prelude The Waste Land. With Pound’s aid, Eliot exchanged a section from Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness to a passage from the Satyricon. In the latter text, a Sybil who wished for eternal life now longs for physical death. Unlike the original epigraph, where Eliot quote’s Kurtz’s ‘cry that was no more than a breath – “The horror! The horror!”’, the passage of the Sybil ‘only ambiguously relates to the contemporary situation Eliot evokes in the poem.’ The Sybil’s longing for the end of life seems to contrast significantly with the opening of the poem which, according to Harriet Davidson, ‘seems to yearn for the living death the Sybil can no longer bear.’ The story of the Sybil serves as another disjointed piece of the entire poem. The epigraph of a text sets the tone; thus, it is very noteworthy to acknowledge the great differences between Conrad’s Heart of Darkness and the Satyricon – there is no apparent connection between the two. While the Sybil wishes to escape the futility of life, Kurtz's response of horror ‘is not to an empty or even necessarily meaningless life, but to his rather too full embrace of human possibilities quite beyond the bounds of \"proper\" behaviour.’ Davidson argues that the change ‘suppresses Eliot's appreciation of his contemporaries, instead impressing upon the reader the seriousness of classical scholarship.’ However, both showcase different aspects of the modern life Eliot saw to depict in his poem. These two episodes are no different from the many other disparate images throughout the poem as they embody contrasting aspects of modernism in the twentieth century. However, they can only be disseminated once the reader is aware of the original epigraph. It is interesting to note the different stance the entire poem would have had should the first option have been retained. Ultimately, these two epigraphs are contradictory instances which serve to create new meaning when one is set alongside the other. Both Kurtz and the Sybil showcase that death is not the only horror. Kurtz’s cry of agony at the horror of his life and death are mirrored with the Sybil’s repugnance to a sterile and changeless world without the possibility of death, life, loss, or love. The Waste Land implies both horrors. Throughout the poem, there is a contrast between the images of the ‘little life with fried tubers,’ and dry desert, with rain and the sea. These images are sustained by two distinct voices. ‘This voice speaks with authority and finality as it recurs in scenes throughout the poem where the vision of barrenness and revulsion from life is intensely clear and controlled. This voice contrasts with the babel of many voices speaking in metonymically rendered narrative scenes full of movement and change.’ These different voices range between class and gender, human and non-human voices of the nightingale, the cock and the thunder, and the many voices from literature in the various allusions within the poem. The poem’s many abrupt changes, as well as the mutations in the voices in the poem, blur the boundaries between the characters’ identities, which further increases the reader’s confusion about who is speaking. These modes of sterile propriety and fertile impropriety cause despair in their own way, however, neither is entirely repudiated. What is responsible for much of the drama in the poem arises from the mixing and interweaving of these two modes as ‘desire disrupts order and desire for order sets up paradoxical and unbearable tensions.’ The poem thus frustrates the reader who expected to follow its themes and images in an orderly way. Rather, its form depicts the mutability which arose in modernist literature from the very opening of the poem in its various tones and voices.\n\nWritten after The Waste Land, Four Quartets uses language and allusions to parallel Eliot’s perception of the cyclical, repetitive patterns of life and death. While The Waste Land focusses on man’s relationship with a fragmented culture, Four Quartets deal with man’s relationship with the divine, the universe and time. The Four Quartets are abundant in the use of paradox, which allows two contradictory notions to simultaneously exist within the reader’s mind. Thus, in these poems, disparate notions are portrayed through the ambiguity of language itself as well as in his practice of alluding to other texts through intertextuality. Each of the five sections considers spiritual existence, consciousness and, most significantly, the past’s relationship to the present. ‘Burnt Norton,’ the poems first installment which focuses on time, opens with the paradox where a brief moment of eternity is caught;\n\nTime present and time past\n\nAre both perhaps present in time future\n\nAnd time future contained in time past\n\nIn these lines, Eliot sets forth the metaphysical paradox of time. How can the present moment lay in the future, and how can past event lay concurrently with the present and the future? Here Eliot claims that it is fact that the past and the present both exist in the future in the same way that the future exists in the past. Eliot creates insights within the reader’s mind ‘through poetry’s emotional, hypnotic manipulations’ which force the reader to endure the intellectual contradictions and paradoxes of life until Eliot, the poet, ‘is completely ready to abandon himself to the idea of the timeless.’ Four Quartets is filled with paradoxes which resolve themselves after the paradox has been issued. This vies well with Eliot’s idea of poetry; that contrary ideas are presented abreast one another only to create a larger concept within the reader’s mind; such as:\n\nFootfalls echo in the memory\n\nDown the passage which we did not take\n\nThese footfalls occur where they could not possibly echo, ‘[d]own the passage which we did not take. However, the paradox is resolved since the echoes occur ‘in the memory’ where anything is possible. The second quartet, ‘East Cocker’ begins with a reference to Mary Queen of Scots. As she is about to die, Mary says, ‘In my end is my beginning.’ In his poem, however, Eliot reverses this paradox, ending ‘East Cocker’ with ‘In my beginning is my end.’ In altering the famous words of the Scottish queen, Eliot turns despair into hope through the power of paradox. He does so in many other instances within this section in Four Quartets,\n\nIn order to possess what you do not possess\n\nYou must go by the way of dispossession.\n\nas well as,\n\nWe must be still and still moving\n\nInto another intensity\n\nFor a further union\n\nEliot seems to be presenting an answer to the problems he saw with modern life in a paradox. By bridging together two seemingly contradictory concepts, Eliot is creating unity which can be mirrored in society. In ‘The Dry Salvages,’ Eliot again invokes paradox, portraying ‘the way forward [as] the way back,’ up as down, and time the healer as time the destroyer. The voices of the sea in this section may represent voices from the past:\n\nThe sea howl\n\nAnd the sea yelp, are different voices\n\nOften heard together: the whine in the rigging,\n\nThe menace and the caress of waves that breaks on water […]\n\nAnd the wailing warning from the approaching headland\n\nAre all sea voices, and the heaving groaner\n\nRounded homewards\n\nThe sea, which is made up of different voices, may allude to those voices of the great predecessors, which culminate in a ‘historical sense of perception, not only of its past, but of its presence.’ Here their presence is felt again, not as different fragments placed aside one another, but as a ‘wailing warning’ to return ‘homewards’. Thus, ‘the way forward is the way back.’ The voices of the sea can be linked to those found in The Wasteland which also is suffused with an array of different characters, however, in ‘The Dry Salvages’ the multitude of voices are speaking as one. As the voices of the past calling out to the present, Eliot manages to ‘form new wholes throughout the poem, merging not only individuals but different cultures and different moments in history.’ The last section of Four Quartets, ‘Little Gidding,’ is largely concerned with the past, present, and future and how each generation of humanity seem to be connected.\n\nWhatever we inherit from the fortunate\n\nWe have taken from the defeated\n\nWhat they had to leave us – a symbol:\n\nA symbol perfected in death.\n\nAnd all shall be well and\n\nAll manner of thing shall be well\n\nBy the purification of the motive\n\nIn the ground of our beseeching.\n\nThe final section of ‘Little Gidding’ mirrors the fifth movement in The Waste Land in that it too speaks of a new beginning through the end of the world; ‘What we call the beginning is often the end/ And to make an end is to make a beginning.’ At the end of The Waste Land, Eliot, quoting the Upanishads, writes, ‘Datta. Dayadhvam. Damayata. / Shantih shantih shantih’ ‘The Peace which passeth understanding’ Eliot explains to the reader in the poem’s notes on why he used this particular reference. Here there is still no rain in sight – the arid wasteland remains as it was at the very beginning. However, there is a possibility of rain. There is hope, something which does not even seem possible in such a world. The voice here is that coming from the dawn of Western civilisation and speaks directly to the inhabitants of the wasteland. The poem ends not with an achievement of peace, yet with the potential for it.\n\nEliot created new and unique poetry in arguing that ‘the most powerful effect is produced by the sudden contrasts of associations.’ These contrasts serve to enhance a oneness within these elements which had gone unnoticed before, such as the connection between a rose and a flame. Eliot firmly believed that it was them modern poets’ duty to reconcile thought and feeling, something which had been lost since the time the Metaphysical poets had been active. In doing so, the poet is able to create a disparate awareness of his views on life through his poetry. In composing poetry about the fragmentation of modern life in fragments, such as in The Waste Land, readers are able to see modern life in a more objective way that was not evident to them before. For Eliot, as well as Pound, ‘the fragmentary nature of modern poetry was an endeavour both to express and to heal the fragmentation of the modern psyche and modern culture.’ The method of such disparate and fragmenting ideas was a way to connect the past to the present, the mundane to the spiritual, and history with the contemporary. Eliot’s new and discordant connections aimed to unite modern life and culture since it was only through this unity that salvation could be achieved from the sterility and dryness that Eliot felt encompassed the twentieth century. The Wasteland established both a relation to as well as a separation from tradition by intertextuality, pastiche, and parody. What Eliot found most important in uniting thought and feeling was that this created a wholeness of sensibility, a modern wit, which the modern poet needed in order to be able to form new wholes. Eliot manages to do this also by reaching out and using elements which are not usually considered poetic. In fact, he claimed that,\n\nthe business of the poet was to make poetry out of the unexplored resources of the unpoetical; that the poet in fact, was committed by his profession to turn the unpoetical into poetry.\n\nIn Four Quartets, Eliot conceived a work about time and humanity’s place within it. In The Waste Land, Eliot weaves in his experience of modern life and turned it into an inspiring and timeless poem. As he learned from Laforgue, it was ‘the sort of material that I had, the sort of experience that an adolescent had had, [which] could be material for poetry; and that the source of new poetry might be found in what had been regarded as the impossible, the sterile, the intractably unpoetic.’ Taking unpoetic subjects and ideas, and weaving them into a new whole only added to Eliot’s poetic originality and legacy.\n\nThroughout Eliot’s The Waste Land and Four Quartets, there lay a common theme of unity. The reference to the Upanishads is meant to symbolize a new beginning – that to be ride of the dry waste land, we must go back to the very start of it all. Thus, Eliot harks back to Sanskrit to get this message across, the first Indo-European language with which many cultures share words and meanings. Four Quartets is also about ‘that which returns, which keeps coming back, and its theology, its imagining of human maturation, is rooted in journeys of re-visitation, in returns to where we started from.’ Both poems are filled with contrasting images containing many voices, however, they both seem to be concluding at a very similar and fundamental point. The image of the fire and the rose becoming one, and the voice of the Upanishads usher in a new beginning and a new hope for a better future. His poetic originality lay in how he manages to bridge such polar opposites together effortlessly – making his connections seem as if they have always existed in plain sight.\n\nIn many of his poems, T.S. Eliot connects fragmented elements in order to create an entirely new concept in the reader’s mind. The disparate images were intended to paint a portrait of lost ideals and despondency between individuals in the twentieth century. In bringing together disparate and unlikely links, Eliot created a sense of unity which connected the past to the present. This avant-garde aspect in Eliot’s poems laid a new path in the way people wrote and read poetry, and it sanctified Eliot’s place as a true Modernist poet."
