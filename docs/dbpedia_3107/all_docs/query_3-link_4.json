        "text": "The following are updates to previously-reported items and other recent regulatory filings and actions concerning Upper Midwest broadcast stations. This report is created by the author and is not an official report of the FCC.\n\nIowa\n\nThe FCC granted Townsquare Media’s WJOD/103.3 (Asbury-Dubuque) a construction permit to move its transmitter to the WDBQ/KLYV tower in Dubuque. It will remain a Class C3 station, changing its facilities from 6.6kW/196m at its present site southeast of the city to 18kW/118m directional from the WDBQ site.\n\nNeil Lipetzy completed the buyout of his partners in Community First Broadcasting on Dec. 31. The company owns 11 full-power radio stations in Iowa (see the original report for a complete list).\n\nMinnesota\n\nThe FCC granted Alpha Media’s K269EC/101.7 (Mankato), which is currently off the air, to relocate to a transmitter site in North Mankato, remaining 250 Watts. The application indicates it will again relay KMKO-FM/95.7 (Lake Crystal) when it returns.\n\nCalvary Chapel of Twin Falls’ K201IQ/88.1 (Fergus Falls), which was recently displaced by the sign-on of a new station, was granted a construction permit to move to 90.7 as K214FP. It will also upgrade from 190 to 250 Watts.\n\nThe University of Northwestern-St. Paul was granted the callsign KDGR for its future station on 88.1 in Grand Rapids.\n\nNeil Lipetzy completed the buyout of his partners in Community First Broadcasting on Dec. 31. The company owns KKOJ/1190 and KUXX/105.7 (Jackson).\n\nNebraska\n\nNebraska Educational Telecommunications Commission’s K209FS/89.7 (Columbus) requested an extension of special temporary authority to remain silent as it continues work to relocate to a new site. It also has a construction permit to move to 88.1 since it was displaced from its previous frequency by the sign-on of a new station. As previously noted, K209FS had provided the only strong public radio signal to the city of about 24,000 people; NETC also has a construction permit to build full-power station KUNE-FM/88.7 (Columbus).\n\nThe University of Northwestern-St. Paul’s K219LV/91.7 (Hemingford) was granted a construction permit to upgrade from 36 to 170 Watts and switch to a non-directional antenna.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nNeil Lipetzy completed buyout of his partners in Dakota Broadcasting on Dec. 31. The company owns KMOM/105.5 (Roscoe-Aberdeen) and KABD/107.7 (Ipswich-Aberdeen).\n\nWisconsin"
