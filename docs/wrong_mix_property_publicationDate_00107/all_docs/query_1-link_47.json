        "text": "The Holographic Excitation\n\nThe gang celebrates Halloween at Stuart's comic book store. Meanwhile Leonard and Penny discover a new spark in their relationship when he seduces her with science. And while Howard can't stop talking about space, it takes iconic astronaut BUZZ ALDRIN (guest starring as himself) to get him grounded again.\n\nKiller Chat\n\nInternet sexual predators become the victims when a serial killer decides to get revenge by murdering them in order to permanently stop their behavior. Meanwhile, Charlie faces one of his more complicated problems: saying goodbye to Larry who is leaving for a six month NASA space shuttle mission.\n\n16 Chefs Compete\n\nAfter the contestants struggle to work together during opening night in the dining room, Chef Ramsay presents the red and blue teams with a communication challenge. Each contestant will wear a chef jacket with the dish they must complete written on the back of the jacket, while their teammates must read off the instructions to that contestant in order for him/her to properly prepare the dish. The team that correctly completes the most dishes will win a relaxing retreat in Santa Barbara, while the losing team must prepare the kitchen for the next dinner service, which involves gutting 100 lbs. of seabass. Later, during the dinner service, the teams will cook their second dinner service for VIP guests, including astronaut Buzz Aldrin. Find out which team will deliver an out-of-this world successful dinner service, and which team will struggle to manage the simplest tasks."
