MC Buzz is out of this world and in the house. And, admittedly, just a little bit pitchy.\n\nAstronaut Buzz Aldrin, 79, who has had his share of rendezvous with pop culture, launches three projects today, including a rap video that features Snoop Dogg, Soulja Boy and Quincy Jones. What can the real Buzz Lightyear be thinking?\n\nRobert Pearlman\n\nEditor\n\nPosts: 42981\n\nFrom: Houston, TX\n\nRegistered: Nov 1999\n\nposted 06-23-2009 07:22 AM Making of Buzz Aldrin's Rocket Experience w/ Snoop Dogg and Talib Kweli Robert Pearlman\n\nEditor\n\nPosts: 42981\n\nFrom: Houston, TX\n\nRegistered: Nov 1999\n\nposted 06-23-2009 09:19 AM Lisa Cannon, Aldrin's stepdaughter, back-up singer and rap scribe, posted a comment to the song's iTunes page:\n\nI had a lot of fun writing this song for Buzz -- and he did a great job recording it, with the help of some serious rappers. Buzz hopes all of you will ride on a rocket someday to experience space. Remember a portion of the proceeds goes to the nonprofit Sharespace Foundation, and to benefit these charities: National Space Society, Planetary Society, and Astronaut Scholarship Foundation.\n\nAJ\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 511\n\nFrom: Plattsburgh, NY, United States\n\nRegistered: Feb 2009\n\nposted 06-23-2009 11:04 AM Funny idea, but honestly annoying to watch.

No one has to buy Buzz products. While I suspect he takes up a bit of the strain from the limited / unaffordable Armstrong items, I like the Buzz items I own in their own right. I'm pleased to have him in my collection - although I won't be adding the rap track to my personal collection...\n\ngliderpilotuk\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 3398\n\nFrom: London, UK\n\nRegistered: Feb 2002\n\nposted 06-23-2009 04:23 PM Great choice of partner in Snoop Dog: banned from entering Australia; refused a visa by the UK; banned for life from British Airways... substance abuse, guns, violent disorder... perfect role model, just perfect.

Cute, but why?\n\nThe idea, as alluded to in USA Today, was apparently Lisa Cannon's, who as noted earlier is Aldrin's stepdaughter, a former professional singer and the person who wrote the rap.\n\n\"I'm not too good at carrying a tune, but I do have rhythm,\" says Aldrin, who got the idea from a family member who felt the genre would have a broad reach. \"I want kids interested in space. It's their future.\"\n\nThe site behind the videos, Funny or Die, founded by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay's production company, has a large following and a reputation for showing celebrities doing things they normally wouldn't.

Some people may not agree with that, but that is a valid reaction that I've encountered in a number of people. I have a certain amount of sympathy and as well as affection for Buzz and I'm looking forward to seeing him at NASM in July, but I don't have too many illusions about him or other astronauts at this point.

And people here are right, he does a lot to push space exploration, certainly more than Neil Armstrong does. However, I think this rap song was a bit undiginified, and I am glad in this instance that he was not the first man on the moon.

But I wound up admiring Buzz's energy, ability and attitude to this opportunity. Buzz is certainly his own man, but he is reaching out every way he (or his publicist) can think of to other people, trying to stimulate interest in space. Many of us get satisfaction from similar outreaches.\n\nGo Buzz!\n\nMax Q\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 399\n\nFrom: Whyalla South Australia\n\nRegistered: Mar 2007\n\nposted 06-24-2009 07:10 AM Hey I dont like the Tune so I will not be going out of my way to hear it again.

Teens and kids are not morons just because they are young.\n\nIf Mr. Aldrin wishes to perform a rap song, that's up to him. If he wishes to appear on everything hawking his website, that's fine too. For whatever reason he seems to enjoy the spotlight and is willing to do what it takes to remain there. That's his choice.\n\nPersonally, that's not for me but if it works for Mr. Aldrin, again, that's his choice. Just please, no reality TV role because that's just about all that is left for the man to do.\n\ngarymilgrom\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 1966\n\nFrom: Atlanta, GA\n\nRegistered: Feb 2007\n\nposted 06-24-2009 08:41 AM Buzz is an outgoing person who speaks what's on his mind - period. Look at the wonderful help he's given to others with his honest writing on depression and alcoholism. His current focus is getting young people to look skyward - terrific! This wonderful country needs such help - our kids lag the world in maths and engeering; and a rap song might influence more kids than another lecture. **Might** is the operative word because we need to explore every avenue for stimulating kids on space.\n\nI think Neil's private and Buzz's outgoing personalities are a great complement to each other. NASA could not have picked a better first landing team, and America is fortunate to have them both.\n\nxlsteve\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 391\n\nFrom: Holbrook MA, USA\n\nRegistered: Jul 2008\n\nposted 06-24-2009 10:18 AM I, too, thought the rap was a bit silly, and what some people have said about Buzz's over-exposure resonates with me (and I've posted about it on another thread here). But Buzz is not answerable to me or anyone else for doing what he feels he needs to, and I am certainly not in a position to evaluate his motives. I may not always agree with everything he does, but he has definitely earned the right for me to cut him some slack. I've come to the conclusion, as others have said here, \"Buzz is Buzz.\" Robert's comment about Buzz's celebrity pushing us towards the Moon and Mars is a valid one. At the end of the day I think we're better for his being here and doing what he does, warts and all, than not.

That said, I'm still all for him recording it; I'm also all for Buzz writing emotionally frank biographies and simple and direct children's books. I just pick the things he produces that interest me.\n\nIs he too hard sell? Probably yes. So are Coca Cola, Snickers, McDonalds etc but no-one reading this has to ask what those names mean. By putting himself out there so much the same is true for Buzz; if he then chooses to trade upon his own name to talk, write, rap, sing or yodel about space travel then, again - I'm all for it.\n\nspaceheaded\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 147\n\nFrom: MD\n\nRegistered: Feb 2003\n\nposted 06-24-2009 04:00 PM My first thought was this was just plain funny.

Personality-wise no Al Bean, but he's working hard at this great mission of his, and I admire him for that.
