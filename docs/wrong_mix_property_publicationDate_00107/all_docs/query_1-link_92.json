        "text": "Retired astronaut Buzz Aldrin, and Brig. Gen. Robert C. Nolan II, commander of the Air Force Flight Test Center, headlined the Flight Test Historical Foundation's 2nd Annual Excellence in Aviation Awards event May 14 at the Proud Bird Restaurant in Los Angeles.\n\nThe event annually honors those who played a significant role in the country's aviation and space exploration achievements and offered those attending a rare opportunity of meeting America's finest aerospace pioneers.\n\nWith tickets going for a $125 a person, the award celebration was also a fundraiser for the Flight Test Historical Foundation to raise money to help relocate the AFFTC Museum outside the West Gate at Edwards.\n\nThis year's honorees are retired flight test pilot Robert J. \"Bob\" Gilliland, along with Frank Robinson, founder of the Robinson Helicopter Company and Jans K. Neelsen, a long-time trustee of the Flight Test Historical Foundation.\n\nThe awards were presented by Mr. Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, and General Nolan.\n\nThe high-dollar event drew more than 130 people who had the honor of personally meeting and chatting with the retired NASA astronaut who was the Lunar Module pilot on Apollo 11, the first manned lunar landing in history, General Nolan and the three award-winning honored guests.\n\nFlight Test Historical Foundation Chairperson, Lisa Gray, welcomed attendees and thanked them for helping the foundation raise the funds needed to begin construction of the new museum.\n\nMs. Gray gave a brief explanation of the Foundation's mission and said it was established to preserve the aviation history of Edwards by supporting and enhancing the AFFTC Museum.\n\n\"Even more importantly, we strive to present that history to the public in a way that encourages and inspires the next generation of scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians to pursue the innovations and advances that make our nation great,\" she said.\n\nMs. Gray said the aviation pioneers being honored at the event embody that ideal.\n\nGeneral Nolan thanked the Flight Test Historical Foundation for its interest in preserving the history of Edwards and gave a brief history of the base.\n\nThe location of the flight test center was the inspiration of Gen. Henry \"Hap\" Arnold in 1933 when General Arnold was a commander of a bomber squadron and his mission at the time was to find a place where he could quietly train his troops to go to war.\n\n\"He found that place at Muroc's dry lake beds, which is now Edwards Air Force Base,\" General Nolan said.\n\nThe characteristics that drew General Arnold to California's high desert still benefit the flight test center today - the remote location, open air space, great weather and 360 flying days a year.\n\nWhen General Arnold first came to Muroc he envisioned turning it into an ideal training ground.\n\n\"We've taken that vision and we've transitioned that vision today into the Air Force Flight Test Center,\" General Nolan said, adding, \"What Hap brought us in the 1930s we continue today.\"\n\nEvery day men and women at Edwards make history, General Nolan said. \"But as we continue to make history, the very excitement the potential of aviation holds, is only eclipsed by what has gone before us.\"\n\nThe challenge now is to preserve that history and the museum does that in 3-D, he said.\n\nNASA Dryden also contributes to the rich history at Edwards and General Nolan reached out to the director of NASA Dryden to partner with the Air Force and move forward with the quest to build the museum.\n\n\"We're going to raise the money and make this museum a reality,\" General Nolan said and invited everyone to join the exciting journey.\n\nVoice actor, Ken Wolt, emceed the event and introduced the 2011 honorees and explained briefly why they were this year's Excellence in Aviation Awards winners.\n\nHe said Mr. Neelsen volunteered to host the first Flight Test Historical Foundation 'Gathering of Eagles' fundraising dinner to benefit the AFFTC Museum at Edwards.\n\n\"For his tireless efforts, generosity and many contributions to the Flight Test Historical Foundation, we are proud to honor Jens as a 'Friend of the Foundation.'\"\n\nA retired Air Force pilot, Mr. Gilliland was awarded for being an \"amazing\" pilot and an American icon. After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy, he transferred into the United States Air Force.\n\nMr. Gilliland served a combat tour in Korea where he flew an F-84 in a fighter-bomber unit. He later became an Air Force test pilot and flew most of the aircraft in the Air Force inventory.\n\nAfter retiring from the Air Force, Mr. Gilliland went to work for Lockheed (now Lockheed Martin) and flew all models of the F-104 Starfighter. He made the first flight of the SR-71 and took the aircraft to mach 1.5 and 50,000 feet. He has logged over 6,500 hours in many different aircraft.\n\nMr. Robinson, founder of the Robinson Helicopter Company, was the third recipient. Since 1988, Robinson Helicopter Company has manufactured more helicopters than any other helicopter manufacturer in the world. Mr. Robinson is considered to be the driving force behind the company's success.\n\nWhen asked about how he became part of that famous first landing on the moon, Mr. Aldrin said it was a tribute to being in the right place at the right time.\n\n\"I deserved to be there, but that doesn't always mean you're going to get there,\" he said about having been chosen to pilot the Apollo 11 flight.\n\nAfter the awards were given out many gathered around the celebrated astronaut to talk about his famous walk on the moon.\n\nHe said May 25 is the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's speech to Congress about sending a man safely to the moon and back. He believes the upcoming anniversary of that speech is an opportunity for President Barack Obama to make a proclamation about America's space future.\n\n\"Unfortunately I just don't think that will happen,\" he said.\n\nHe added the United States should lead the efforts to create a permanent presence on Mars by 2035.\n\nThe evening culminated with guests dancing the night away to the music of Barbara Morrison and her band."
