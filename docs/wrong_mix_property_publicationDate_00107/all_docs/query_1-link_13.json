        "text": "Who was the second person on the Moon?\n\n19 minutes later Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin joined Armstrong and became the second man to set foot on the Moon.\n\nMichael Collins stayed on board the command module Columbia, in lunar orbit.\n\nWhere did Apollo 11 land?\n\nIt took NASA two years worth of studies to come up with five possible landing points on the Moon. They assessed where would be best using high resolution photos of the lunar surface. However upon descending towards the lunar surface, the lunar module Eagle landed west of their planned target point. The Eagle was moving too fast.\n\nEagle eventually landed on a region of the Moon called the Mare Tranquillitatis, known as ‘the Sea of Tranquility’.\n\nWhen Eagle landed, Armstrong radioed:\n\n‘Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.’\n\nThe response from Mission Control came with a slight misspeak due to relief that everything had gone smoothly:\n\n“Roger, Twan— Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.\"\n\nApollo 11 landings: minute by minute\n\nWhat time did Apollo 11 land on the Moon?\n\nEagle landed at 8.17pm UK time (20:17:40) on 20 July 1969 with around 25 seconds of fuel left. If they had been forced to fly for any longer, they likely would have run out of fuel.\n\nThe hatch was opened at 11.43pm. At 2:51am on 21 July, Armstrong began his descent to the surface and made history.\n\nThe three astronauts on Apollo 11\n\nThe Apollo 11 crew consisted of three men.\n\nNeil Armstrong - Mission Commander\n\nEdwin ‘Buzz’ Aldrin - lunar module pilot\n\nMichael Collins - command module pilot\n\nThere were three parts to the spacecraft.\n\nThe command module, which was the part that would return to Earth and was where the three astronauts spent most of their time. It was known as Columbia.\n\nThe lunar module, which was the part that would actually land on the Moon. This was known as Eagle.\n\nThe service module, which supported the command module supplying things like oxygen and water.\n\nAll three astronauts had previously completed NASA space missions as part of the Gemini space programme. None of them went into space again following Apollo 11.\n\nApollo 11 facts\n\nThe Apollo 11 crew had to go through customs\n\nAfter landing back on Earth, the Apollo 11 crew had to go through customs - as though they were returning from another country rather than from space. The items they declared included Moon dust and Moon rocks.\n\nNeil Armstrong got the quote wrong\n\nNeil Armstrong had reportedly planned to say ‘One small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.’ He even claimed that he did say 'a' but that it was inaudible.\n\nThe crew were put into quarantine\n\nThis was in case they brought back any disease or germs from the Moon.\n\nBuzz Aldrin drank wine on the Moon\n\nThe lunar module pilot took communion on the Moon. He did so privately because of a lawsuit against NASA about the broadcasting of religious activities from the Moon.\n\nThe crew were well prepared\n\nNeil Armstrong couldn’t afford to take out life insurance in case anything went wrong on the mission. As an alternative, Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins signed hundreds of photographs so that Armstrong’s family could sell them in a worst case scenario.\n\nThey had to fill in their expenses\n\nBuzz Aldrin claimed back $33.31 in expenses upon returning to Earth. He claimed for a journey from Houston Texas to the Moon, and back.\n\nLots of the Moon rocks are lost\n\nRichard Nixon gifted 270 of the Moon rocks brought back from Apollo 11 to the nations of the world. Of these, only 180 are accounted for.\n\nKennedy saw the Moon landing happen - in a way\n\nAs the landing happened, the words that Kennedy had spoken at the beginning of the decade flashed on a screen at the Kennedy Space Centre:\n\n“I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.”\n\nFollowed by:\n\n“Task accomplished”\n\nApollo 11 Moon landing\n\nThe landing of Apollo 11 was not only the culmination of the Space Race, but of years worth of technical and scientific planning and design.\n\nThe Apollo 9 and 10 missions also took place in 1969 and were integral to the success of the Moon landing.\n\nWhilst on the lunar surface Armstrong and Aldrin collected Moon dust and rocks to be brought back to Earth. The lunar dust was described as ‘powdery’ and it stuck to the spacesuits of Aldrin and Armstrong. The pair also tested moving around on the surface, experimenting with kangaroo hops and loping to get around.\n\nThey ensured that the world knew that it was the USA who had reached the Moon first, by planting an American flag. The hard surface of the Moon and the thin layer of dust meant that the pole was not planted very firmly in the ground. When the lunar module took off from the surface, the exhaust engine caused the flag to topple over.\n\nThe astronauts also received a phone call from President Richard Nixon whilst on the lunar surface. Nixon described it as ‘the most historic phone call ever made.’\n\nApollo 11 launch\n\nThe Apollo 11 mission launched on July 16 1969 13:32. The rocket was Saturn V which had launched 13 times from the Kennedy Space Center over six years.\n\nOnce they had launched, they traveled for three days before reaching lunar orbit. Once in lunar orbit Armstrong and Aldrin moved into the Eagle, ready to descend to the surface.\n\nWhen Eagle separated from Columbia to begin its descent, Armstrong reportedly said ‘the Eagle has wings’."
