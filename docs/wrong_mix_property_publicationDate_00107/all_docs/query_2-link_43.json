        "text": "May 12, 2000 — Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the Moon, will embark on an ambitious 18-state, 43-city, 2-month tour tomorrow to promote the release of his new technothriller The Return according to his publisher Forge (a division of Tom Doherty Associates). The 358-page hardcover is scheduled to hit shelves nationwide May 15.\n\nBeginning in Florida, where he twice launched into space, Aldrin will also visit museums, planetariums, universities, military bases and stores located in Alabama, California, Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington and in the capital, Washington, DC.\n\nRead an excerpt from The Return\n\nAppropriately, Aldrin's trip will end where he completed what may be his most famous tour — to the Moon — in Texas.\n\nIn The Return, Aldrin and co-author John Barnes tell the story of Scott Blackstone, a former NASA astronaut and the agency's choice to manage its new Citizen Observer program. Tasked with flying everyday Americans to orbit, Scott's project is cancelled before it can even begin after a tragedy with the Space Shuttle.\n\nWhen it appears that the loss may have been intentional, Scott, along with those who share his ideas are forced to mount a daring rescue of the International Space Station, of the space program and of American idealism itself.\n\nThe release marks the second collaboration for authors Buzz Aldrin and John Barnes, who first joined together in 1996 to write Encounter With Tiber. Barnes is the award winning author of Orbital Resonance, A Million Open Doors, Mother of Storms, and many other titles. Aldrin's previous work includes his autobiography Return to Earth and Men From Space, in which he describes his voyage to the Moon as well as his thoughts on the United States' future in space.\n\nWhile touring with The Return, Aldrin is also scheduled to appear on over 20 television broadcasts, including the Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, and The Late Show with David Letterman.\n\nNote to collectors: According to his office, Aldrin will only sign copies of The Return during this tour. He will not autograph memorabilia or copies of his other books.\n\nHere are the dates and locations for Aldrin's tour:\n\nDate Time City Location 5/13 2:00pm Lake Buena Vista, FL 2 R's: Reading & Riting 5/15 7:00pm San Diego, CA Mysterious Galaxy 5/16 6:30pm Pasadena, CA Vroman's 5/18 1:00pm New York, NY Borders Books & Music 5/18 7:00pm New York, NY Museum of Natural History 5/19 12:00pm Philadelphia, PA Barnes & Noble 5/20 2:00pm Dayton, OH Wright Patterson Air Force Base 5/20 4:30pm Dayton, OH Books & Co. 5/22 7:00pm Cincinnati, OH Joseph-Beth Booksellers 5/24 5:30pm Chicago, IL University Club of Chicago 5/25 7:00pm Chicago, IL Borders Books & Music 5/31 7:00pm Lexington, KY Joseph-Beth Booksellers 6/01 4:00pm Fort Knox, KY Fort Knox Military Base 6/01 7:00pm Louisville, KY Hawley-Cooke Booksellers 6/02 4:00pm Fort Campbell, KY Fort Campbell 6/03 12:00pm Nashville, TN Davis-Kidd Booksellers 6/03 6:00pm Jackson, TN Davis-Kidd Booksellers 6/05 12:00pm Cape Canaveral, FL Kennedy Space Center 6/05 7:00pm Winter Park, FL Borders Books & Music 6/06 12:00pm West Palm Beach, FL South Florida Science Center 6/06 7:00pm Sebastian, FL Performing Arts Center 6/07 7:30pm Boca Raton, FL Liberties 6/08 1:00pm Davie, FL Buehler Planetarium 6/08 7:00pm Ft.
