But then again, neither is Neil Armstrong's autograph.\n\nThe value we attach to these autographs on the marketplace is more a matter of supply and demand, not a judgement of rarity.\n\nGary\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 11\n\nFrom: Florida\n\nRegistered: Apr 2002\n\nposted 05-04-2009 09:05 AM Buzz Aldrin signed some moon surface lithos for me while he was here in Cape Canaveral this weekend for the Astronaut Hall of Fame Inductions. I was thrilled to add these lithos to my personal collection. He was a gentleman and very professional and I appreciate the time he took to do this for me it was an honor.

Nothing really noteworthy or new, but an enjoyable 45 minutes. He seemed to be in good spirits.\n\nAfterwards, he began signing his book \"Magnificent Desolation.\" He was in a very good mood, laughing, smiling, and making small friendly comments to all attendees, especially the kids.\n\nHe was only signing \"Magnificent Desolation,\" no other books or memorabilia. I saw a few people with photos, Life Magazines and such, and I had also brought my copy of \"Voices from the Moon\" by Andrew Chaikin, just in case.\n\nAll-in-all, it was a good couple of hours.\n\nRick Mulheirn\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 4540\n\nFrom: England\n\nRegistered: Feb 2001\n\nposted 03-18-2011 01:50 PM I'd be interested to hear other members experiences at signing events attended by Buzz Aldrin. In particular, does he have an issue signing Edwin E. Aldrin as opposed to Buzz? Spacefest\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 1168\n\nFrom: Tucson, AZ\n\nRegistered: Jan 2009\n\nposted 03-18-2011 01:50 PM Yes. He legally changed his name to Buzz. Rick Mulheirn\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 4540\n\nFrom: England\n\nRegistered: Feb 2001\n\nposted 03-18-2011 02:41 PM Thanks for the feedback. It is a shame he will no longer sign \"Edwin E\" particularly as that is how he \"signed\" the plaque left on the moon. Such a signature would be historically more relevant. shadow1789\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 16\n\nFrom: United Kingdom\n\nRegistered: Apr 2012\n\nposted 04-06-2012 10:15 AM I was thinking of attending Autographica later this year (2012) until I read about the prices he charges for his signature.

His appearances are still met with a line of collectors desiring his autograph.\n\nAnd even if he didn't, like all astronauts, he is free to set his own signing policies.\n\nIf you desire his autograph but cannot afford his direct price, you can usually find secondhand examples selling for less, depending on the type of item. If it's only the signature that matters to you, then that may be the best solution.\n\nDaugherty54\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 621\n\nFrom: Cabot, Arkansas, USA\n\nRegistered: Sep 2010\n\nposted 04-06-2012 05:34 PM Buzz's fees are not really all that unreasonable. Considering the signature is of the second man ever to set foot on the moon on the first landing and it's probably a fair price.

I have been unable to justify paying the high prices for autographs but am just pleased to go to these events and meet these legends who without exception have been willing to shake hands, have a conversation and answer any questions I have asked even though I have informed them that I wont be purchasing a signature. Out of respect I try not to be too intrusive.\n\nBuzz Aldrin gave a talk at the Royal Festival Hall in London a few years ago and I bought his book which had his signature on a bookplate inside which I was more than pleased with.\n\nAlthough it is nice to have an autograph to me it is not the most important thing. I am just happy to have met them and feel honoured to have done so thanks to the people who make this possible.\n\ndavidcwagner\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 1011\n\nFrom: Albuquerque, New Mexico\n\nRegistered: Jan 2003\n\nposted 04-07-2012 02:23 PM Buzz signed for free at a 2001 space conference in Albuquerque. He was especially patient with children. Signed my item that had a really nice Armstrong signature for free without a blink.\n\nPaid $600 in 2008 for Aldrin to sign an Apollo model and add \"Apollo XI LMP Columbia Eagle.\" It was a bargain. He cheerfully posed for photos with previously signed items like a flown Apollo 11 flight plan page.\n\nI may not get another item signed at the current prices but I am grateful for the opportunity to choose.\n\ngarymilgrom\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 2130\n\nFrom: Atlanta, GA\n\nRegistered: Feb 2007\n\nposted 04-09-2012 12:24 PM When I met Buzz at an ASF event he was very open and accomodating, talking about his personal life as well as Apollo and the specifics of orbital rendezvous.\n\nAt an outdoor event (airshow) where autographs were not permitted he maintained his friendly demeanor, calling other astronauts together for a group portrait and posing several times as we in attendance futzed with our cameras. Overall a very positive experience.\n\nCritter\n\nNew Member\n\nPosts: 2\n\nFrom: Baltimore MD, USA\n\nRegistered: Apr 2012\n\nposted 05-02-2012 11:34 AM I have looked at several pictures of Buzz Aldrin but the picture (signed by all three) I have of the 'Prime Crew of Fifth Manned Apollo Mission' has his signature signed as 'Edwin E Aldrin Jr'.

I had him sign one two years before that with just his name and mission information. It always seemed so empty when I looked at it on my wall that I had to get another one with the plaque added. While I wasn't happy about the fee, I'm more than thrilled with the final product. To me, that's all that really matters.\n\nAs for my meeting with Buzz, I have only good things to say about him. I've been to two of his shows and he's signed stuff for me at both shows. He was very nice both to me and my daughter.\n\nneo1022\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 325\n\nFrom: Santa Monica, CA\n\nRegistered: Jun 2013\n\nposted 10-07-2013 05:14 PM Last May (2013), I was heading to an interview at Northern Arizona University. My flight arrived into Phoenix late, and as a result, I just missed my connection to Flagstaff â the plane hadn't left yet, but the gate was closed and they wouldn't let anyone else on board.â¨\n\nAs I was standing at the check-in desk trying to talk my way onto the plane, this old guy comes up behind me and starts raising hell with the gate clerk, demanding to speak to the pilot, cursing, etc. I turn around to see who's making such a commotion, and see this guy who looks an awful lot like Buzz. After shouting at the guy for a minute or two, he pauses. I look at him and ask, \"Are you Buzz Aldrin?\" He looks over at me and say, \"Yeah I'm Buzz Aldrin, now get that damn pilot on the phone...!\"\n\nAnyway, long story short, Buzz and I ended up renting a car together and I spent the next two hours driving him up to Flagstaff (where he was attending the IAA Planetary Defense Conference). On the drive up talked about lots of things: Mars missions, SpaceX, politics, and diving. I didn't have the nerve to ask him anything about Apollo XI or his experience on the moon mission, but he wasn't shy about giving his opinion on the current space program! A few times during the drive, I glanced out my driver's side window at the almost-full moon above the horizon. Then I'd glance over at the man who sitting next to me â amazed that I had ended up here, driving one of the very first moonwalkers through the Arizona night. An amazing evening indeed.\n\nOnce we got to Flagstaff and dealt with the rental car, he gave me his business card and some contact information. As he handed it to me, I saw that it was a very cool Apollo XI card with the mission emblem and a little astronaut logo. I couldn't resist asking him to sign it for me (which he did). At the time I didn't know he was such a reluctant public signer âÂ probably never would have asked otherwise.\n\n(Best moment: When we were waiting at the rental car place, he took out his iPhone to call his niece to pick us up in Flagstaff. He looked for the phone number in his contact book for a few seconds, then, having difficulty reading the small letters, he handed the phone to me: \"What does that say...?\" I looked at the phone number. \"It says Neil Armstrong.\" Buzz paused a moment, looked at me, then said: \"Don't think he's gonna be picking up any time soon...\" Priceless!)\n\njamato99\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 150\n\nFrom: Leesburg, VA USA\n\nRegistered: Apr 2003\n\nposted 10-09-2013 03:24 PM Wow!!!

While it was still a thrill to see a member of Apollo 11 in person and have him sign something, I can't get past the feeling that Buzz simply didn't give a rip about the people who had come to see him at this event.\n\nPlease don't get me wrong. I do realize that the book signing line was very long, and I certainly didn't expect a photo with him or to carry on a conversation, but he repeatly ignored the people in line who were thanking him for signing their book, for his service to his country, etc. Not a smile, nod of the head, or anything to acknowledge their sincere thanks.\n\nRobert Pearlman\n\nEditor\n\nPosts: 51279\n\nFrom: Houston, TX\n\nRegistered: Nov 1999\n\nposted 04-26-2014 07:18 PM I'm sorry to hear your experience with Buzz today wasn't ideal.\n\nI doubt he meant any disrespect. He's participated in a lot of these types of events over the years and sometimes he's personable with everyone who approaches, and other times he's focused on signing only.\n\nBuzz is today as dedicated to advancing humanity into space as he has ever been (perhaps even more so). His passion for the topic comes through clearly, even over the phone. I suspect that for a long time now, he's considered signing as a means to that end, and would enjoy it more if people took more interest in what is written in the book than what he writes on it.\n\nBut that said, I think he genuinely understands the reasons why crowds turn out for his appearances and is appreciative for it, even if he may not always exhibit it.\n\nOn edit: By the way, you mention \"not a smile,\" but see this tweet.\n\nSpaceyInMN\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 367\n\nFrom: Andover, MN\n\nRegistered: Dec 2013\n\nposted 04-26-2014 08:48 PM I'm happy to see that smile. I was near the front of the line for the book signing, and I can honestly say that he wasn't even making eye contact with people at that time. I will agree with you, though, on his passion for space exploration. He gave a couple presentations during the day and was very enthusiastic and passionate while giving them.\n\nI also can completely understand that signing hundreds of items at events like this over the course of 50 or so years would get very old and tedious. I'm glad he still does these events. I will be reading his book, although I have a few to get through before I start in on it.\n\nmoonnut\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 280\n\nFrom: Andover, MN\n\nRegistered: Apr 2013\n\nposted 04-26-2014 11:08 PM Jason, glad to see ya got out there.

Am I correct in suggesting that this only became \"official\" in the last 10 years or so and for how long prior to that did Buzz stop signing Edwin E. unofficially?\n\nThe Antiques Roadshow last weekend repeated a show that included an Apollo 11 crew litho framed with individual crew signatures on index cards. The experts believed the signatures were genuine when they clearly were not (it was discussed on this forum after the show was initially aired a year or two ago).\n\nI posed the initial question about Edwin E. over Buzz in the hope that a known date for the switch would help authenticate or otherwise signed pieces such as the Antiques Roadshow \"Edwin E.\" example obtained post flight circa 1969.\n\nRobert Pearlman\n\nEditor\n\nPosts: 51279\n\nFrom: Houston, TX\n\nRegistered: Nov 1999\n\nposted 06-25-2021 03:14 PM I don't know if it dates earlier, but Aldrin was not signing his former name by the time he took part in his first autograph show in 2004.
