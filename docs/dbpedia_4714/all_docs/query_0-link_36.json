        "text": "Ranking the best pizzerias in America is contentious business. And you could argue, ridiculous. Like ranking birthdays. Or Christmases. How can you really rank something so nuanced, diverse, and… beloved?\n\nHaving curated a list of America’s best pizzas annually since 2012, researched additions, and visited as many places as possible, I get the difficulty of the effort. Having read the comments, I also get the compulsion to hate-read such an effort.\n\nOver time, The Daily Meal’s list of 101 best pizzas in America has taken on a life of its own. Two of my favorite pizza obsessives, Barb and Eric (Barb has a Ph.D. in molecular and developmental biology, Eric is a mechanical engineer) of 101 Pizza Places, have made it their mission to visit every pizzeria featured on every list. (If you love pizza and you’re not following them on Instagram, check them out.) And last year, Pizza Today called the 101 “one of the most sought-after listings” in the pizza-sphere. It’s a serious undertaking (read the comments — you’d be crazy not to take it seriously).\n\nThough not a perfect list, by virtue of the fact that it relies on experts across America, I do think its the best.\n\nEvery year’s intro examines movement from list to list — the number of states featuring pizzerias, east coast versus west coast, how the big pizza cities compare with each other. The order of the list changes somewhat from year to year, and up to about 20 new places climb on annually. (On any given year, I’ve typically hit about 50 to 60 places out of the 101.) Only two pizzerias have ever been ranked #1: Frank Pepe has topped the list five times and Di Fara has ranked first twice.\n\nBut I’ve never looked at all the pizzerias together. By my count, since the first list (35 pizzerias in 2012) a total of 214 pizzerias have been featured over the course of seven years. Eight closed (though Una Pizza Napoletana and Pizzeria Beddia reopened). To my knowledge, this is the first time all the pizzerias have been featured together on a map for ease of reference.\n\nOne of the most interesting things I’m reminded, looking at all the pizzerias this way, is that none have ever made the list from the following 15 states: Vermont, New Hampshire, West Virginia, Indiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Montana, Idaho, and Utah. That’s not for lack of effort in terms of looking for great places or experts from these states. They’ve just never gotten critical mass. I can’t believe there’s really not great pizza there though…\n\nThink you know of a great place that should be featured? Know someone (or consider yourself a pizza expert) who you think should be a panelist to vote on the next 101? DM me @nycbestpizza. Meanwhile, check out the full lists below. — Arthur Bovino (April, 2019)\n\nThis year’s list spanned 23 states. The top 11 states for pizza included New York (29); California (10); Connecticut (9); Illinois (9); New Jersey (5), Pennsylvania (5); Massachusetts (4); Oregon (4); Georgia (3); Rhode Island (3); and South Carolina (3). For the fourth year, the birthplace of American pizza, New York, featured the most pizzas. It was a resurgent year all-around for the Empire State, adding two pizzerias to its 27 spots in 2015. In 2016, Brooklyn reigned once again, but it and Manhattan both dropped two spots, falling to 11 and 9 respectively. Queens (3) and Staten Island (1) both dropped spots since last year, and the Bronx held strong with the one and only Louie and Ernie’s. One fewer state was represented this year (so long, Missouri), which enabled Illinois to gain ground on Connecticut as one of the top four states for pizza.\n\n#1 Di Fara"
