        "text": "Downtown Denver\n\n16th Street Mall\n\nDenver has one of the most walkable downtowns in the nation. But you can save on shoe leather by riding the free shuttle bus on the 16th Street Mall – it makes everything in downtown easy to reach and stops at every corner. Renowned architect I.M. Pei designed the gray and pink granite pathway to resemble the pattern of a diamondback rattlesnake. This area is home to some of the most popular places to visit in Denver, like Denver Union Station and the LoDo Historic District. You can easily spend a full day sightseeing at these downtown Denver attractions. After dark, horse-drawn carriages clatter up and down the mall.\n\nLarimer Square\n\nVictorian buildings house specialty boutiques and unique chef-driven restaurants with one-of-a-kind stores and distinctive fashion and exclusive offerings in this urban shopping and dining district.\n\nLower Downtown (LoDo) Historic District\n\nDenver's happening historic district is filled with turn-of-the-century warehouses, now home to 90 brewpubs, sports bars, restaurants and rooftop cafes. While you're in Lower Downtown (LoDo), stop by Rockmount Ranch Wear for a snap-button Western shirt at the store where they were invented; or sip a handcrafted beer at the Wynkoop Brewing Company, Denver's first brewpub opened by former Denver Mayor and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper.\n\nDenver Union Station\n\nDenver Union Station has undergone a massive restoration that transformed the landmark into a transportation, dining, shopping and entertainment hub, and hotel. The historic, Beaux-Arts 1914 train terminal is now a foodie destination, with a dozen restaurants and bars, from farm-to-table favorite Mercantile dining + provision to the Terminal Bar, situated in the station's old ticket windows. A handful of local retailers includes a branch of the popular Tattered Cover Book Store. Union Station is also fulfilling its original role as a major ground transportation hub, serving as an Amtrak, light rail and shuttle bus station with direct rail service to Denver International Airport.\n\nArts & Culture\n\nDenver Art Museum\n\nDenver Art Museum recently celebrated the reopening of the Martin Building (formerly known as the North Building). First opened in 1971, the fortress-like structure was designed by Italian architect Gio Ponti and Denver-based James Sudler Associates. The building has been fully renovated with expanded gallery space, plus stunning views of the city skyline and Rocky Mountains. The building showcases Asian art, Indigenous arts of North America, Northwest Coast and Alaska Native, European and American art before 1900, Latin American and art of the ancient Americas, photography, textile art and fashion, and Western American art collections. The museum's other striking building resembles a titanium crystal with peaks and shards designed by Daniel Libeskind.\n\nMeow Wolf Denver\n\nMeow Wolf Denver's Convergence Station is an unforgettable and transformational experience for all ages. Discover immersive, mind-bending art across the four alien worlds of C Street, Eemia, Ossuary and Numina. Uncover the secrets within.

Here, visitors can recharge from their cosmic exploration, and find sustenance in tasty treats and bold brews from local vendors.\n\nClyfford Still Museum\n\nClyfford Still, considered one of the most important painters of the 20th century, was among the first generation of Abstract Expressionist artists. The Clyfford Still Museum, which opened at the end of 2011, was founded to promote the late artist's work and legacy. Still's estate – 2,400 artworks – has been sealed off from the public since 1980.\n\nMurals & Street Art\n\nOne of the best museums in Denver is the city itself. Denver street artists have been busy brightening (and enlightening) the urban landscape for decades by making canvases of the city’s alleyways, building exteriors, warehouses, garage doors and storefronts. See our guide to find out where you can see passionate works by local muralists like Pat Milbery and Detour.\n\nThe Blue Bear at the Colorado Convention Center\n\nTheColorado Convention Center is home to “I See What You Mean,” AKA the giant Blue Bear that peers into the Center’s interior. Created by Colorado-based artist Lawrence Argent, the curious blue bear stands 40 feet tall – you can walk under it and get a great photo.\n\nCraft Beer\n\nDenver is famous for its craft beer. It brews more beer than any other U.S. city and there are 150 brewpubs, breweries and taprooms in the metro area. So where to you begin? Let the Denver Beer Trail be your guide into a world of IPAs, stouts and lagers in their natural environments. You'll be amazed at all the ways brewers are getting creative with flavors. If you want something truly unique, check out Oakwell Beer Spa, which combines a day spa with a craft beer bar. Yes, you can soak in a bubbly beer bath infused with hops, barley and seasonal herbs. And kick back in their cozy taproom stocked with a rotating selection of Colorado's finest beer, wine and cider.\n\nHistory & Western Heritage\n\nHistory Colorado Center\n\nThe History Colorado Center, one of Denver’s newest cultural attractions, is designed to ignite imaginations of all ages about Colorado history through high-tech and hands-on exhibits, programs for children and adults, and special events.\n\nColorado State Capitol\n\nStand exactly 5,280 feet above sea level (one mile high!) on the west steps of the Colorado State Capitol, then climb to the rotunda for a panorama of snowcapped peaks.

Free tours are available on weekdays.\n\nColorado Railroad Museum\n\nSurrounded by towering Western buttes, the Colorado Railroad Museum combines a spectacular location with more than 100 narrow and standard gauge locomotives, cabooses and cars. Exhibits include a working Roundhouse, model railroads, photographs and artifacts, much of it housed in a replica of an 1880s-style depot. Train rides every Saturday on the Galloping Goose take guests on a third of mile loop of track, while \"Steam ups\" and special events including \"A Day Out With Thomas\" occur throughout the year.\n\nBuffalo Bill Museum & Grave\n\nWelcome to the Wild West! Buffalo Bill Cody's exciting story as Pony Express rider, army scout, buffalo hunter and showman comes to life at the Buffalo Bill Museum & Grave, high atop Lookout Mountain.

It's also where you'll find Denver Zoo and the Denver Museum of Nature & Science (DMNS).\n\nWashington Park\n\nKnown locally as Wash Park, it's consistently picked by residents as their favorite. The long, rectangular park has two lakes, paddle boat rentals, bike rentals, shade trees, a two-mile jogging path, mountain views and a huge area for volleyball tournaments, but it's the gardens that people like the best. Dogs on leashes are welcome and on most days there are almost as many canines as humans. See our guide for exploring Wash Park.\n\nElitch Gardens Theme & Water Park\n\nThe only downtown theme park in America is really two parks in one: on one side of Elitch Gardens Theme & Water Park, experience 53 thrill rides, including looping roller coasters; on the other side, cool off in a wet 'n' wild water park with tubes waterslides and wave pools. The park is open from early May to early November.\n\nAlso, check out Denver's lesser-known, hidden gem parks and the city's best urban hikes.\n\nNature & Science\n\nDenver Museum of Nature & Science\n\nFrom stunning prehistoric fossils to an exploration of outer space, The Denver Museum of Nature & Science never fails to astound and amaze with realistic visions of the past, present and future.

Ride the Georgetown Loop Railroad over a 100-foot high trestle to neighboring Silver Plume, tour historic homes and shop on the quaint Main Street that has been used in films featuring Clint Eastwood and John Denver.\n\nEcho Lake and Mount Blue Sky\n\nFrom I-70 take Exit 240 and then Colorado Hwy. 103 to Echo Lake\n\nMount Blue Sky Scenic Byway, the highest paved road in North America, climbs 9,000 feet from Denver, passing through five life zones en route to the 14,264-foot high summit. This is one of Colorado's 54 fourteeners (peaks that climb to 14,000 feet and above), and one of only two in the nation that you can drive up. Stop at Echo Lake along the way for hiking trails, fishing, picnic tables and an unusual eight-sided log cabin restaurant. At timberline, Denver Botanic Gardens maintains a trail that winds through wildflowers. Due to snow, the Mount Blue Sky Highway is generally open to the top only between Memorial Day and Labor Day.\n\nBoulder\n\nHome to the University of Colorado, Boulder has been described as the \"the city nestled between the mountains and reality.\" A recent study pegged it as the \"happiest\" city in America. You'll find out why when you stroll past the shops, cafes and street performers on the Pearl Street Mall, or take a hike on the city's 200 miles of trails. Nearby attractions include the National Center for Atmospheric Research with a museum on weather and global warming, and towering Eldorado Canyon State Park, one of the most famous technical climbing centers in America."
