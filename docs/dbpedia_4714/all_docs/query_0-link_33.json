        "text": "Who’s Got the Best Sicilian Pizza In New Jersey?\n\nWhatever pizza places YOU frequent for a crispy slice of Sicilian, is the best. This list will point folks in the direction of Jersey pizza lover’s favorite places for a good pie or slice of Sicilian.\n\nI published a list last Fall and have learned a lot since then. I thought it was a good list, and then I got schooled by people here in Jersey who eat pizza nearly every day. They didn’t give me a verbal beatdown, they just let me know that I left off a few places. They were fairly gentle with their critiques. Robyn escapes sleeping with the fishes, this time.\n\nClick Here For 2023’s List For Best Sicilian Pizza In New Jersey\n\nWhat’s The Best Way To Judge Pizza’s Taste & Texture?\n\nIn my opinion, ordering a full pie is the way to go when attempting to judge the taste and texture of good pizza.\n\nI order slices most of the time, and I try to time it so I can get a slice from a pie fresh out of the oven. I always ask, “What’s coming out of the oven for slice service?” The only time I get a reheated slice is when I see a pie sitting in the display that looks too incredible to pass up.\n\nIf I like it, I’ll order a full pie next time I’m feeding more than just myself.\n\nWhen I moved to New Jersey, I needed to gather information and a bit of an education from people who have spent a lifetime of eating Sicilian pizza in the Garden State.\n\nOrigin Of Sicilian Pizza\n\nAccording to Basil Pizza Bar: Sicilian pizza is believed to have first been made in Sicily, during the 19th Century. During those periods, various kinds of pizza were popular with constant experiments in enhancing the flavor.\n\nAccording to La Cucina Italiana: Sicilian pizza is derived from sfincione, a street food synonymous with Palermo, Sicily’s capital. Nowadays, it’s topped with tomato sauce, but the original version was complete with anchovies, sliced tuma (Sicilian cheese made from raw sheep’s milk), breadcrumbs with grated pecorino cheese, onions, salt, and extra-virgin olive oil. It originated in Bagheria, a town in the commune of Palermo, around six miles from the city center.\n\nSicilian-style pizza was introduced to the United States by Sicilian immigrants in the mid-20th century. Topping Sicilian pies with mozzarella most likely happened because most Italian bakeries and restaurants in New York City would have had access to good quality, low cost mozzarella.\n\nThe dough making method and preparation is different from the Neapolitan and other kinds of pizza.\n\nI love Sicilian Pizza’s thick spongy dough which is prepared from a combination of flour, water, olive oil, and yeast. It is pressed and placed on a square baking pan coated with olive oil along with toppings such as tomatoes or tomato sauce, and all the good things that make a fine Sicilian pie.\n\nAgain, I combed through the pages of my favorite local food sites and social media food pages to see where the Jersey Sicilian pizza eating experts go for the ultimate Sicilian pizza eating experience."
