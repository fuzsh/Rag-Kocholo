        "text": "We're sure this one will get you talking: Yelp just released its list of the 100 best pizza spots in the U.S. and, shockingly, New York does not top the ranking.\n\nCompiled based on Yelp Elites' shared favorites (\"our most passionate and trusted reviewers and influencers,\" the company explains in a statement), the survey, which you can browse through in full right here, crowns Pequod's Pizzeria in Chicago as the very best of its kind in America.\n\nWe can't say we're surprised: Pequod's Pizzeria has, after all, appeared on two seasons of the massively popular TV show The Bear.\n\nInterestingly enough, however, the location deals with its own fair share of critics who are constantly debating whether the pies that Pequod's slings out should qualify as traditional Chi-town deep dish pizza.\n\n\"We call it pan pizza, but really, it’s just our pizza: a unique take on traditional Chicago pizza,\" said General Manager Sean Asbra to Yelp. \"It’s thick, with a soft bready center, a crispy bottom and a caramelized cheese crust around the edge.\"\n\nWe'll let Chicagoans argue about that while moving on to analyze the New York spots that make an appearance on Yelp's list.\n\nAt number three is the iconic Lombardi's, considered by many to be the very first pizzeria to open in the United States back in 1905.\n\nYelp Elite reviewers quoted in the press release pay tribute to the spot's \"throwback, warm and welcoming\" aesthetic and its \"old school Italy feeling.\" We would like to add that the menu items on offer are consistently good, earning the destination the fanbase it enjoys.\n\nPrince Street Pizza, which now boasts locations in Los Angeles, Miami and San Diego as well, also makes the ranking at spot number seven, with Olio e Più, the excellent West Village trattoria following at number eight. We suspect that Olio e Piú's custom-built, 1,000-degree wood-burning brick oven that was important from Naples has a lot to do with the restaurant's popularity. (Fun fact: according to Executive Chef Danilo Galati, the oven produces pizzas in 60 to 90 seconds, reports the press release.)\n\nWe'd be remiss not to mention the other New York spots that made it to the top 100: Di Fara Pizza (#16), Rubirosa (#25), Bleecker Street Pizza (#28), Juliana's (#30), John's of Times Square (#31), Kesté Pizza & Vino (#43) and John's of Bleecker Street (#46).\n\nBelow, find the top 100 best pizza joints in the US according to Yelp Elites:\n\n1.
