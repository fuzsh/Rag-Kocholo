        "text": "Pizza lovers in Alpharetta will soon have another convenient option for grab-and-go pizza.\n\nA new location of Pizza Hut is planned for 5620 Commerce Boulevard, according to construction plans. The 1,533-square-foot space, formerly occupied by Vogue Hair Salon, is located between Dollar Tree and Moe’s Southwest Grill. This will be the third Pizza Hut location in Alpharetta.\n\nThe Pizza Hut menu includes a variety of pizza, wings, melts, pasta, breadsticks and dessert. The chain was founded in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nThe team behind the new Alpharetta location is Flynn Group. The company was founded in 1999 as an operator and developer of Applebee’s and has since grown into the largest franchisee operator in the world. In addition to Pizza Hut and Applebee’s, the Flynn portfolio also includes Taco Bell, Arby’s, Panera, Wendy’s and Planet Fitness. (The acquisition of 37 Planet Fitness gyms last fall ushered in the rebrand from the former name Flynn Restaurant Group to Flynn Group.)\n\nFlynn acquired more than 900 Pizza Hut restaurants in 2021, a deal that was the largest franchisee-to-franchisee acquisition ever.\n\nAccording to a site map, Flynn has 74 Pizza Hut locations in Georgia."
