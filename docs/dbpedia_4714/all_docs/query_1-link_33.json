        "text": "SAGINAW TWP, MI – Years after the Bay Road location closed, Pizza Hut is returning to Saginaw Township.\n\nA new location is coming soon to 5775 S. State St., at the intersection of State and Wieneke, near Biggby Coffee, The Souper Cafe, West Side Decorating Center and Jet’s Pizza.\n\nRay Hausbeck, Saginaw Township’s assistant director of community development, said the new Pizza Hut is going into a space formerly occupied by Verizon.\n\n“Verizon just downsized their suite there, and so it left some square footage,” he said, noting the space is to be converted into two suites.\n\nAlthough rumors of another chain restaurant opening alongside the new Pizza Hut are swirling, a second tenant has not been confirmed yet, Hausbeck said.\n\nElsewhere in Saginaw Township, Popeyes and Wingstop are two chain restaurants preparing to open new locations on Bay Road.\n\nRelated: See where Popeyes is building its next mid-Michigan restaurant\n\nNearby Pizza Hut locations can be found on Euclid Avenue in Bay City and on Saginaw Road in Midland, according to the company’s website.\n\nSaginaw Township previously had a Pizza Hut at 3199 Bay Road. Another nearby Pizza Hut location, 2160 Center Ave. on Bay City’s East Side, also closed in the last decade.\n\nWant more Bay City- and Saginaw-area news?
