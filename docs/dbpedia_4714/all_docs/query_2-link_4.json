        "text": "The year was 1985. It was a magical time when hair defied gravity, neon spandex defied explanation, and pizza came in one of two choices: tasty or cheap, but that would soon change. In September, we swung our door open for the first time and introduced Albertans to our dream of delivering great value on top-notch food. Like Cabbage Patch Kids, our unique melange of palate pleasing pizzas at pocketbook-protecting prices caught on fast. Almost over night – give or take 24 months – 17 new Pizza 73 outlets popped up in Edmonton and Calgary. Today there are over 85 Pizza 73 stores across Western Canada with more opening soon. Each delivering on our promise to serve up a “Better meal. Better deal.” every time. Our menu has grown too. When we started out, we offered a limited number of pizzas. Now we cook up 25 varieties of specialty pizzas, offer over 20 different toppings, four styles of crust (Traditional, Super Pan, Sesame Seed and Gluten Free), and seven types of sauce (Traditional, BBQ, Donair, Sriracha Honey Garlic, Pesto, Buffalo and Creamy Garlic) for you to create your own pizza, and prepare eight flavours of wings. We even whip up an assortment of fresh side dishes such as boneless wings, wedgies, dipping sauces and salads daily. Headquartered at a brand new 40,000 square foot state-of-the-art Head Office & Distribution Centre on 164th Street in northwest Edmonton , Pizza 73 continues to be a leader in technology, personnel and food products. We were the first Alberta pizza company with a Central Call Centre, which means that in every region we feed, one telephone number connects you to our operators, who then pass your order on to your neighbourhood Pizza 73. That’s why our meals make it to your door so fast, hot, and delicious.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.pizza73.com\n\nExternal link for Pizza 73\n\nIndustry\n\nFood and Beverage Services\n\nCompany size\n\n501-1,000 employees\n\nType\n\nPublic Company\n\nFounded\n\n1985"
