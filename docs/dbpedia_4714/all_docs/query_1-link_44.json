And how you’re having fun with our little mishap yesterday,” the location’s general manager Marc Girard posted on Facebook. “Damm (sic) auto correct.”\n\n“Marketing done right,” one amused person commented on the post.\n\nThe local hospital’s charitable foundation even jumped in on the fun, according to CTV News.\n\n“Hey Timmins Pizza Hut … stick to Pizza, we’ll handle the circumcisions,” the Timmins and District Hospital Foundation wrote on social media Thursday, with an edited version of the sign."
