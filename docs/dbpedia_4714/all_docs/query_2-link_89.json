        "text": "Calgary – Pizza 73 plans to introduce beer as a new beverage item for takeout and delivery customers at locations across Alberta in 2021.\n\nThe service was launched at 23 locations across Alberta on Aug. 23 and more sites are expected to follow this fall. Customers in the select Alberta cities will be able to purchase beer for takeout or for delivery with any food purchase. Pizza 73 has plans to license most of its restaurants across Western Canada by Summer 2022.\n\nTo promote the launch, the chain created a limited-edition large pizza box featuring six pop-out drink coasters that is available at select locations across Alberta.\n\n“Being a Western Canadian brand, Pizza 73 knows Western Canadians,” said Dayna Palmer, senior marketing manager for the company. “Our customers are looking for a great beer pairing when it comes to pizza or wing night, and are continuously looking for ways to save time. By making beer delivery available right to their door with their go-to Pizza 73 order, we can save them valuable time.”"
