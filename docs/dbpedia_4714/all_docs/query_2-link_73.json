Pizza 73 corporate headquarters are located on the 17th floor of Canadian Western Bank Place in Edmonton.\n\nPizza 73 Franchise Cost & Initial Investment\n\n****Pizza 73 employs a different approach to franchising. While most companies charge a royalty payment as a percentage of sales, a Pizza 73 franchise does not charge a royalty fee at all. Rather, the parent company shares profits equally, so that the company and its franchisees grow together, or take losses together. If a Pizza 73 franchisee doesn’t make a profit, Pizza 73 corporation doesn’t charge a percentage fee."
