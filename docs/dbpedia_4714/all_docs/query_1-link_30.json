EYM Group previously sued Pizza Hut on March 15 in Texas alleging a breach of contract, the NWI Times reported.\n\nA Pizza Hut spokesperson provided the following statement to NBC Chicago Friday afternoon:\n\n\"While some local franchisee-operated restaurants have temporarily closed, Pizza Hut remains committed to providing outstanding service and products to our valued customers. The company is working to transition these locations and expects many of them will reopen soon. To find a Pizza Hut location nearest you, please visit https://locations.pizzahut.com.\""
