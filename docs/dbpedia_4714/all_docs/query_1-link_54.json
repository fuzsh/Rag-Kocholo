The results were too good to keep to myself.\n\nSure, here's a song about former Pizza Huts in the style of the Beastie Boys:\n\nVerse 1: Used to serve up hot pizzas, now they're just shells But you can still see that iconic roof, can't you tell? Once it was the place to go, to grab a slice with your friends But now it's just a memory, of how it used to be back then\n\nChorus: UTBAPH, it's what they call it now Used to be a Pizza Hut, but that was long ago The roof is still red and round, and the sign's still up high A testament to a time, when pizza ruled the sky\n\nVerse 2: From coast to coast, they're scattered all around Houses, shops, and offices, that used to be the joint downtown Families gathering 'round the table, enjoying some pizza delight But now it's just a memory, of a simpler time and sight\n\nChorus: UTBAPH, it's what they call it now Used to be a Pizza Hut, but that was long ago The roof is still red and round, and the sign's still up high A testament to a time, when pizza ruled the sky\n\nBridge: Some people say they're eyesores, but we see the history Of a time when things were simple, and the pizzas were a treat So let's raise a glass, to the UTBAPHS of the past And all the memories, they bring back that will forever last\n\nChorus: UTBAPH, it's what they call it now Used to be a Pizza Hut, but that was long ago The roof is still red and round, and the sign's still up high A testament to a time, when pizza ruled the sky\n\nOutro: So the next time you see one, take a moment to reflect On all the memories, that it helped us to collect And let's keep the UTBAPHS, alive in our hearts For they'll always be a part, of our pizza loving arts.\n\nShould I revive this blog? Do you miss it? Tweet at me and let me know. Maybe it is time to bring it back to life."
