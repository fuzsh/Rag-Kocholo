        "text": "Pizza 73 has launched beer at over 40 locations throughout Alberta\n\nCALGARY, AB, Sept. 20, 2021 /CNW/ - Pizza 73, has officially announced its plans to introduce Beer as a new beverage item at locations across Alberta in 2021. August 23 marked the initial launch at 23 locations across Alberta, with more sites to follow this fall. Customers in the select Alberta cities will have the opportunity to purchase beer for takeout or for delivery with any food purchase. Pizza 73 has plans to license most of its restaurants across Western Canada by Summer 2022.\n\nIn celebration of the launch at Pizza 73, an exclusive limited edition large pizza box featuring 6 pop-out drink coasters is now available at select locations across Alberta, while supplies last.\n\n\"Being a Western Canadian brand, Pizza 73 knows Western Canadians. Our customers are looking for a great beer pairing when it comes to pizza or wing night, and are continuously looking for ways to save time. By making beer delivery available right to their door with their go-to Pizza 73 order, we can save them valuable time. In addition, our beer-loving customers can get a limited edition Pizza 73 Beer Coaster Box with their beer and pizza order; a very cool piece of Pizza 73 that they'll now have in their homes to keep,\" said Dayna Palmer, Senior Marketing Manager, Pizza 73.\n\nPizza 73 has a history of adding new extensions to their menu assortment over the years. Chicken wings, now a staple in the industry, were unique to the pizza industry when Pizza 73 added them to the menu, and their Everyday Deal, in the early 90's. Pizza 73 has continued over the years to provide an array of innovative items over the years including our Gluten Free pizza and chicken options, our Dairy Free Cheeze and Cauliflower Crust.\n\nFor more information on Pizza 73's new beer launch or to place your order, visit www.pizza73.com.\n\nAbout Pizza 73\n\nEstablished in 1985, Pizza 73 aims to satisfy every customer by providing excellent quality food and true value in a fast and friendly manner.
