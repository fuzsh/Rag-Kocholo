His illustrations of popular customs were inspired by accumulated documents as well as his imagination in order to visualize a nostalgic sentiment toward an idealization of past rural life.\n\nMasson, Henri (Belgian/Canadian, 1907–1996)\n\nMasson emigrated from Belgium to Canada as a teenager. In his early professional life he worked as an engraver, painting in the evenings. His first solo exhibition of paintings was at the Picture Loan Society in 1934. He exhibited internationally, and today his work is held in major institutions in Canada, including the Vancouver Art Gallery; Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto; and National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa.\n\nMathieu, Georges (French, 1921–2012)\n\nA sculptor, designer, illustrator, and painter who became interested in abstract painting in the 1940s.
