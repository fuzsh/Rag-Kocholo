Stuart is considered to be an early power forward, a forward who combines physical play with scoring ability.\n\nPlaying career[]\n\nBruce and his brother Hod played for Ottawa in 1899. In 1900, they moved to Quebec City for business. They started playing hockey again in 1901, joining the Quebec Bulldogs. He then played professional in Pittsburgh and Houghton in the old International Professional Hockey League. Stuart joined the Wanderers in time to win the Stanley Cup in 1907, and then captained the Senators in 1909 to the Cup.\n\nIn 1910, when the National Hockey Association (NHA) imposed a salary cap, cutting player's salaries in half, Stuart attempted to form a rival league. The rival league failed to organize, as the Montreal Arena was refused to the players. Stuart returned to captain the Senators to the 1911 Stanley Cup. Stuart retired from playing after the 1910–11 season.\n\nDespite his age, he attended his induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961. He died not long after.\n\nPreceded by\n\nHarvey Pulford Ottawa Senators captains\n\n(Original Era)\n\n1908-11 Succeeded by\n\nMarty Walsh"
