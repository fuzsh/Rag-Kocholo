        "text": "Born into a musical family in Staunton, Virginia in 1987, Tim grew up constantly surrounded by music. His love of music first came from seeing jam sessions at his godfather’s house rockin’ parties as a young child. Enthralled by the creativity and passion of the professional musicians around him, Tim began studying piano at age 5, and later added saxophone at age 11. A quick study and natural at the instrument, Tim began performing professionally as a freelance saxophonist at age 16, where he cut his teeth in the bars, clubs, and wedding bands of the Shenandoah Valley. Driven to instill his passion for music in others, Tim decided to pursue a degree in Music at Bridgewater College in Bridgewater, Virginia after graduating high school in 2005. Studying saxophone with Dave Pope, Charles “Bucky” Clark, and David Snively, as well as jazz improvisation with trumpeter Tim Weir and keyboard/arranging/composition with Dr. Larry Taylor, Tim further refined his skills as not just as saxophonist, but as a well rounded artist-educator. A recipient of the 2009 Outstanding Jazz Band Member and the prestigious Nelson T. Huffman Award for Musical Excellence, Tim would go on to become a licensed music teacher in the state of Virginia after graduating from Bridgewater Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Arts in Music with a Concentration in Pre K-12 Instrumental Music Education in 2009.\n\nIn the fall of 2009, Tim would shift his focus from teaching to performance as he auditioned for and was selected as a saxophonist in the United States Army. Tim completed Basic Combat Training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and was an accelerated graduate of the Basic Musician's Course at the Army School of Music at Little Creek Naval-Amphibious Base in Virginia Beach, Virginia (completing the 23 week program in just 7 weeks.) From there, Tim would be assigned to his first duty station with the 98th Army “Silver Wings” Band, based at the United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE) in Fort Rucker, Alabama.\n\nDuring his time with the “Silver Wings,” Tim has served as a senior instrumentalist, clinician, and the saxophone section leader. He has performed on saxophone and keyboard throughout the Southern United States with some of the U.S. Army’s finest commercial groups including the “Wiregrass Jazz” (jazz combo), “Blackout Brass Band” (New Orleans style brass band) and “Crossfire” (pop/rock group) as well as performances with the “Silver Wings Ceremonial Band” and “Silver Wings Concert Band.” These groups bring professional quality music to tens of thousands of Americans throughout the military, civilian, and academic communities of the southern United States each year. Tim has also been an active clinician, giving numerous master classes on saxophone techniques and jazz fundamentals to hundreds of middle and high school students throughout United States.\n\nRead more\n\nOutside of the Army, you can find Tim performing with artists like saxophonist Michael Lington, guitarist Aaron Bostic, and singer-songwriter Chad Hall at national music festivals like the Verizon Wireless BamaJam, Pensacola Jazz Festival, Fort Rucker Freedom Fest & MWR Summer Concert Series, or the St. Andrew’s Bay Jazz & Mardi Gras Festivals. Not just a sideman, Tim also actively leads two of the hottest groups in the Florida Panhandle; 10 piece New Orleans funk-rock band the “Dirty South Brass Band” and the experimental jazz project known as “OLIO” (with trumpeter Arzo Tureaud). Additionally, Tim has contributed to several recording projects, most recently in collaboration with bassist Alvin Dawkins for the soundtrack of the short film “The Coloring” produced and released by Abuzz Film works (2010.) Due to the hard work and of the entire cast and crew, “The Coloring” was a regional success and subsequently awarded a “Silver ADDY Award” by the American Advertising Federation in 2010, just 3 months after its’ premiere in theaters. Tim has also contributed his musical talents on a gospel album entitled “Music for a Better Life,” by the jazz group “Major Changes.” This album features Danish pianist/organist Jan Nielsen on Hammond B-3 with special guests Chris Nguyen on drums, Melvin Burks on trumpet, Danish songwriter Sorren Sebber Larsen on guitar, Marcus Hart on electric bass, and Tim Stuart on saxophone.\n\nThroughout his musical career, Tim has had the opportunity to work with many fantastic professional musicians, artist/educators, and musical ensembles from around the world including; The Artie Shaw Big Band, Just Jazzin’ Big Band, and The Stonewall Brigade Band. Saxophonists Michael Lington, Dave Pope, Henning Munk, & Ashu. Trumpeters Graham Breedlove, Tim Weir, Melvin Burks, Koli Givens, & Arzo Tureaud. Guitarists Vince Lewis & Soren Sebber Larsen. Pianists Georg Schroeter, Liz Barnes, Hod O'Brien, & Jan Nielsen. Trombonists Tom McKenzie & Steve Coonley. Percussionists Wes Crawford, Eric Nolley, & Chris Nguyen.
