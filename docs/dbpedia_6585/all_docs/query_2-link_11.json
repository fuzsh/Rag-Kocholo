The name is obviously derived from that of Steward of the Royal Household, and was probably first used as a surname by Walter, the third of the family to occupy the hereditary office of Steward, and who died about 1210. Its origin naturally suggests that the name was first Stewart. Because of the close connection that for a long time existed between Scotland and France, the French forms, Stuart and Stewart, were afterward adopted by some branches of the family. It is said that Sir John Stewart of Darnley and D’Aubigny, who was for some time in the service of the French court, was the first to use the French spelling of the name. Mary, Queen of Scots, because of her residence in France and her attachment to French customs and fashions, helped to introduce the French spelling in the Royal Court, although her son, James 6th of Scotland and 1st of England, some times wrote his name Stewart; and in the death warrant of Charles 1st, the name is spelled Stewart. From the time of Queen Mary historians have used the French form, Stuart, in referring to members of the Royal family. The ancestral origin of the family involves much that is legendary or traditional, but if we should dismiss the un- authentic part as unworthy of credence we should be doing something that we do not do in dealing with other matters or that historians do not do in dealing with matters of history. Much of early history would have to be omitted if we were to omit everything that was not genuinely authen¬ ticated or incapable of being proved by unimpeachable testimony. One fact that cannot be controverted is that the family of Stewart or Stuart furnished Scotland with her rulers or her kings and queens, for some three hundred years, and England with hers for about one hundred years.

The first of the kings was Robert Stewart, afterwards known as King Robert II. He was the son of Walter, the itizth hftre/lilary I^ord High Steward of the Royal Household of Scotland, by his wife, the Princess Marjory, daughter of King Robert the Bruce. Once when Scotland was making a fight for independence she sent an envoy to the Papal Court, to Pope Boniface 8th to try to prove that the female line of the Scotch dynasty was older than that of the English dynasty. Just what evidence, if any, he produced in order to prove his state¬ ments made to the Pope, we do not know, but, however, the story was that an Egyptian Princess Scota was the founder of the Dalriad or Scotch dynasty. According to the story she married Gathelus, a son of Cecrops, King of Athens, and she was a daughter of the Pharaoah who was drowned in the Red Sea. She and her husband, together with a con¬ siderable company or retinue, in order to escape the plagues of Egypt fled to Spain, from there to Ireland, and thence to Scotland, bringing with them the coronation stone of Scone. It is generally believed that the real founder of the Dalriadic dynasty was Fergus Mor Mac Earca. Dalriada was the old name of the northern part of the country of Antrim in Ireland. The Dalriads were descended from Carby Riada (Rioghfhada, i.e., of the long wrist) a son of a chief of the Scots in Ireland, who crossed over into Scotland, the land of the Piets. About 500 A.D. the Dalriads under Fergus passed over into what is now known as Argyllshire and founded the kingdom of Dalriada, which later became the Kingdom of Scotland. The male line has accurately been traced beyond any question of doubt by historians and genealogists to Alan, father of Walter, the first Steward of the Royal Household of King David I, who reigned from 1121 to 1153. But they are not agreed as to the ancestral origin of Alan. Some historians support the tradition that the male Stuart line goes back through Kenneth Mac Alpine, who became in the year 811 King of the united Dalriads, Piets and Scots, to Fergus, reputed founder of the line of Scottich Kings, who began to reign, according to some authorities in the year 330 B. C. If that story is true then the male and female lines go back to a common ancestral origin.

D. Other historians assert that Alan was of Breton origin, and was descended from an earlier Alan, who was Dapifer or Seneschallus of Dol in northern France. Regardless of where he came from it is agreed that he had two sons, the elder of whom, Alan, was a leader of the Crusade in 1097; the younger, Flaad, was the father of the agreed ancestor, Alan. Alan, the son of Flaad, had a son Walter, who came to Scotland and was appointed by King David I (1124-1153) Steward of the Royal Household. Alan, the son of Walter, succeeded as High Steward. He died in 1204, leaving a son, Walter, who was appointed Judiciary of Scotland in addi¬ tion to the hereditary office of Steward. It is said that this Walter was first to use the hereditary office as a surname, giving to himself and to his descendants the name of Stew¬ art. He had three sons, Alexander, the eldest and his suc¬ cessor; Sir John who was killed in Egypt; and Sir Walter, known as “Bailloch,’ the freckled, who became the Earl of Menteith. James, the son of Alexander, was the fifth High Steward of Scotland; and Waller, the son of James, was the sixth High Steward. This Walter when only twenty-one years of age commanded with Douglas, one wing of the Scots army at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. In the year 1314 King Robert the Bruce sent young Walter Stewart, the son of James, to the English border as an envoy to meet and escort home his second wife, Elizabeth, and Marjory, a daughter by his first wife, who had been held as prisoners in England and had just been liberated. The following year the King bestowed his daughter Marjory in marriage upon the young Stewart. There was born to this union a son who became Robert II, the first of the Stewart Kings. Robert Stewart, on the death of Edward Bruce, brother of Robert Bruce, was declared heir to the Scottish throne, provided no male heir should be born to Robert Bruce. But some time afterward a son David II, was born to Bruce. Fortunately, however for Robert Stewart, King David died YJII/A'l TUA rt'd 40 YSIO'/f! owl-vliinj rlgi.v/idi sny/iVR nror! ?/ anil o«fi V 9/Bil sw #oiiv/ ,3n i qlA oi:v‘ dknii^l oi av/oh &a o fma .(i i -< . ;i/ n n. £3 , d !>» ;?. f nig no nots'iti lo a«w nsiA indi in^ « aaj&rK>i?ifl todiO lo egoifriggaJl .ttmvi i imdhon m (a(l b no mU f-.JKjC. „■ /j bi;il a ' *CffJ bir • n *• * ft* ••• »*;> An* >>>> .7 ;\\dCf {« shnsniD M >o T?b«ol u ahw n?dA .root!- > nobb ,inf<i«ri6 b 'Jib mi i9ii! l 'j !J ?. , «/ ^ci ’ 1 /logouov nrli .nrlA oi siHfif) orfv/ /: tfffV/ ! a js bull .he*!\"! lo not1 9if) ,md4 (J cl r-i*£fl) f fbviid g v/ r -c tip t>o 3cv *’<£ -brid; re< /loi io i - od! .Moffo nil ;uwfl orii lo tr wr^\\< ,fiox ; gii.yc .* ,1-0 m btub *11 vrjrT^tfc ' 5<' bob »o:o -iJ/ ii iii bml!v>o«' In • '>b,u**j :»> .<ir i>b .vjtio*// ziiU JofO bine «\\ tl lo ooflRo ^ftuidmad ari) of r r ] ,3fitMrwi: B pb aoitto Tiubbawf 9fU ^cu oi ie*j fi ^ idU 7 ><i 1. > s»r :eci n fi Pin, rrx )f aid oi* L f: 1! n?r.:L; < grti/:; -am aid ban bA'i adi /iabmurafA fanoa otmd bad ol{ .Jtii ,*i 7 ni# bn ; ' ; v (,« I }»Ii>I •/ n fv/ nd l i.Z ; fc x a h«H erf) oixiHood afiw .-'ofdin? *>r{ \\rijoniofl p/s n;/ond : mxh o#f! xh v ,gofnr.l lo nog or?

A Scottish historian, Fordun, thus describes Robert Stew¬ art: “A comely youth, tall and robust, modest, liberal, gay and courteous and, for innate sweetness of his disposition, generally beloved of all true hearted Scotsmen.” The Stewarts or Stuarts continued upon the throne of Scotland from father to son, in unbroken succession from King Robert II, to James 5th, who was succeeded by his daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots. Her son James 6th of Scotland and 1st of England, took descent on his father s side through the Earl of Lennox, head of the second branch of the Stewart family. The Earls and Dukes of Lennox were descended from Sir Alexander Stewart of Darnley, who was a grandson of Sir John of Bonkyl, a son of Alexander, the fourth High Steward of Scotland. Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, eldest son of Matthew, Earl of Lennox, was the husband of Mary, Queen of Scots. It might be of some interest to note here that at the second jubilee of the late Queen Victoria, an English clergyman and genealogist prepared a chart by which he tried to prove that the Royal line was descended from Judah. He had a tabular list of a thousand names bv which he traced the descent of Robert II, the first Stuart King, back through Kenneth Mac Alpine to Fergus Mor Mac Earca. From Fergus he traced the line to Ferquhard, the son of Angus the Pro¬ lific, thence to Ezekiel, and from Ezekiel to Kings David and Solomon, thence back through nine generations to Judah. ... . .

The usual tartan worn by members of the family was the red colored pattern known as the Royal Stewart tartan. There were, however, at least four other tartans worn; the dress tartan, more white than red: the old tartan; the hunt¬ ing tartan; and the Bonnie Prince Charlie tartan. The Stewarts of Appin, a part of Argyllshire, together with the Stewarts of Athole, were considered in the High¬ lands as forming the Clan Stewart. The chief of the Clan Appin was known as Mac Iain Stiubhart Van Appin. How¬ ever, there were several other clans of Stewarts, such as the Stewarts of Ardsheal, the Stewarts of Strathgarry, the Stewarts of Invernahyle, the Stewarts of Fasnacloich. It seems that the Stewarts of Allanton, Ballechin, Tanachie, and Dalguise spelled their name Steuart. The marching song of the Scottish Stewarts has been translated as follows: The heath clad Ben we’ll soon ascend, Through Glen Laoigh we’ll soon descend, Our points of steel we’ll swiftly send, Thro’ every loon that bars us. We will up and march away, We will up and march away, We will up and march away, Daring let of all men. O’er the hills we’ll speed along, Through Glencoe unwearied on, Our King the burden of our song, Asking leave of no man.

The armorial bearings used by various branches of the family number eighty-five, that number being recorded in the Lyon Register of Arms at Edinburgh. The first arms to be borne by the family are those adopted by the High Stewarts of Scotland in the twelfth century. They consist of an escutcheon, or shield of a gold color, with a fesse, or band drawn horizontally across the center, one-third in width of the escutcheon, the band being divided like a chess board into checks of blue and silver. When Robert Stewart ascended the throne as Robert II, he abandoned the paternal arms of Stewart for the Royal Arms of Scotland. i :uAri iXAirr?. to rnoroiH JIrtfiw Jor? ni Amos «*ao8T>ricl Dis'ff JIbo too in o*Ib esixn;))! o»?M 4cqcj i lliw yvrml oUJisd .null 3///; it// tjjo lift bo A '({Bin 0} uurn norlw *jn ft d«W > » ' 'A- V i I . noiu LI a b lol &aiiaG W*ru ibrnni *rfB qjj II iw e;// fv«wis ifoieni bn is qu ffiw 9 7/ .u.r : If > to Is! gnhuQ ♦r i ,r h.fv 'u ^viboi bftOffriB duT ni bs? fo:>oi gnfob to lnuin *Bfh ylri; 3 lotlama vlinurt :r ••!'•■ »v lft 9/1 f il‘pTC/TvbM ? in/ i *i* }e Jl 0 .1 91 J rfj-dH *>/ i j yd botcjobi y.-.o/B >ib yfimct mil y*l >ciiod l <1 i^ienao ysiH iuiock* < I H f >wl dJ ni baai)tr>2 h> aliawoi-i jo r9za-/'f c ilt;w fJoh)j blojq « to buiite to aosiftaiimo an lo fH <) tilii tdO ^JS \\U »£• 1(*t T///V b 3 f ‘ ■ b • k ■ /i j’/lia bu~ 00 Id io &jL>et.rj uJni f: x>«i ii )*19do>* irO ^rioiff5 «■•! >l !

Rut from the time of the settlement at Jamestown until along about the time of the Revolutionary War they came in goodly numbers. There were more than two hun¬ dred members of the Stuart family in the Colonial army from the Colony of Massachusetts alone. There were prob¬ ably even more from Virginia. Not only the date of the arrival of the first Stuart is un¬ known but also the place of his arrival and the place where he settled and made his home. Probably the first Stuart to settle in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia was Archibald Stuart. He first settled in western Pennsylvania near the present little city of Wash¬ ington, or, as it is popularly known today, Little Washing¬ ton. It was about 1728 when he came to western Pennsyl¬ vania. But about two years after that dale, because the governor of the Pennsylvania colony enforced some act of legislation that was highly objectionable to members of the Presbyterian faith, Archibald Stuart and most of the other Presbyterians living in that section of the colony moved to the Valley of Virginia. Stuart settled at or near the site of the present little town of Waynesboro, about twelve miles east of Staunton, at the foot of the Blue Ridge mountains. Several years later two brothers of Archibald Stuart came to Virginia. They were John and David Stuart. David Stuart settled in the Greenbrier country. He was the father of Col. John Stuart who was at the battle of Point Pleasant, a famous battle of the white settlers against the Indians led by Cornstalk. Several of Col. John Stuart’s descendants are still living in Greenbrier and adjoining counties. What became of David Stuart's brother John we do not know. We can find no trace of him in any of the local records or histories. He may have gone back to his people in Scotland. Archibald Stuart was born in Londonderry about the latter part of the 17th century. He married Jane, or Janet Brown. Of this marriage the following children were born: Thomas, Eleanor, Alexander and Benjamin.

Judge Archibald Stuart, a grand¬ son, was a very prominent member of the Virginia Con¬ vention that ratified the Constitution of the United States. Another descendant was Alexander II. H. Stuart, of Staunton, who was Secretary of the Interior in the cab¬ inet of President Pierce. Another was the famous Con¬ federate cavalry leader, Gen. James E. B. Stuart. The most distinguished descendant now living is ex-Governor Henry Carter Stuart, of Elk Garden, Virginia. Ex-Gov¬ ernor Stuart is a nephew of the great Confederate cavalryman. Archibald Stuart died in 1761 on his farm about two miles southwest of Waynesboro. During his residence in Augusta he acquired large landed estates. But ex-Gov- ernor Stuart has far greater landed estates than his early Virginia ancestor ever had. It is said that he owns about one hundred thousand acres of land. On this vast acreage he pastures more cattle than any other farmer or dealer east of the Mississippi River. \" ' Vri .i'. i'/ tft to lodmom Insnimoiq r»v « *,w f \" a II u labncxoiA )a*pns > :n ~££rr.

He came from Scotland, the land of his birth, and settled in the Augusta colony of Virginia in what is now Highland county. When he was horn and when he came, we do not know. One account states that he was born about 1732 and came to America about 1755. He bought land of one George Wilson at the mouth of Shaw’s Fork on the Cowpasture River and settled there in 1759. From that time until his death there was his home. Just what blood relationship, if any, there was be¬ tween Archibald Stuart and William Stuart, we do not know. It is probable that they were closely related, they may have been brothers but there is no positive proof of any such relationship. The old Elk Stuarts always claimed that they were related to Gen. James E. B. Stuart. Whether they based this belief on anything but the iden¬ tity of surnames, we do not know. Of course if they were kinsmen of the famous Confederate general, then Archi¬ bald Stuart and William Stuart were related. No doubt all the Stuarts who came from Scotland and Ireland were related, but the relationship existing among some of the families was very distant, so distant that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to trace. William Stuart’s coming to America is thus described in Morton’s History of Highland County: “Stuart, a young Scotchman, had a thrilling experi¬ ence in reaching these mountains. Being well educated, he expected to follow a profession. The ship on which he took passage was captured by Spanish pirates and the crew was killed. He was the only passenger and was put on the South Atlantic shore with no clothing save a piece of canvas and without his chestful of books. Thence he drifted northward to the Augusta colony, doing at first manual labor. His soft hands and intellectual air brought him a welcome invitation to teach school, and he followed this calling the rest of his life. But downcast y , -i.> Cl? •?

Stuart settled just below the mouth of Shaw’s Fork.” The story of William Stuart’s marriage is given in Morton’s History as follows: “The name of his wife, Margaret Usher, uncovers a romance. One Edward Usher eloped with the daughter of an English nobleman named Perry and came to America. Their four children were daughters, one dying in infancy. Usher died while they were yet small, and the widow went to England, hoping for a reconciliation with her father. He recognized her on the road as he drove by in his carriage, but being still angry he tossed her a shilling, telling her that was all she would have from him and that she must mind her brats herself. She returned to America, her children, if not also herself, finding their way to the Augusta colony, probably to Fort Dickenson. “James Knox became the guardian of Anne Jean, and wilh a portion, at least, of her inheritance he purchased for her a negro girl. Several years later she married Loftus Pullin. Margaret Usher, as before stated, mar¬ ried William Stuart. The third sister, Martha, married Col. John Dickenson, the only son of Capt. Adam Dick¬ enson. The stern parent finally relented and provided for his daughter by will. Hut the search he instituted failed to discover her, and no knowledge thereof coming to her descendants for many years, the matter went by default.” The bond executed by James Knox as guardian of Ann Jean Usher was the first fiduciary bond ever recorded in Augusta County. The bond was as follows: “Know all men by these presents, that We, James Knox, John Brown and Andrew Pickens, are held and firmly hound unto John Lewis, Gent, first Justice in Com¬ mission of the Peace for the county of Augusta, for and in behalf and to the Sole use and behoof of the Justices of the said County, and their successors in the sum of one hundred Pounds ($333.33) Current Money; to be paid to the said John Lewis, his Exrs.

Loftus Pullin, who married Ann Usher, was one of the first settlers of the Bullpasture. Little or nothing is known of his life prior to his settlement on the Bullpasture or of his descendants. There are still in Virginia a few fam¬ ilies bearing the name of Pullin or Pullen. It is very probable that Loftus Pullin was their early ancestor. There is living in Richmond at the present time a banker and man of considerable prominence of the name of A. M. Pullen. Loftus Pullin, together with his brother-in-law, Wil¬ liam Stuart, was a soldier in the French and Indian War. They were in a company known as Capt. Preston's Rangers.

Capt. Adam Dickenson, the father of Col. John Dick¬ enson, was the leading pioneer on the lower Cowpasture. It is not known just what year he came to that section of Virginia. In 1733 he was living at Hanover, New Jersey. In 1742 he was an iron-worker in Lancaster County, Pa., but seems to have moved in the same year to Prince George County, Md. When Augusta was organized in 1745, he alone of 21 justices in the first county court, represented the portion of the county west of the Shenan¬ doah mountains. Adam Dickenson owned the first grist mill in that region. John, only son of Adam Dickenson, was born in 1731 and died in 1799. At the age of 22 he was a captain of horse, and during the next 25 years he saw much military service on the frontier. He was at the battle of Point Pleasant. For injuries received in Indian fights he was granted a pension of 50 pounds a year. In 1777 he was promoted to the rank of Colonel. Col. John Dickenson’s children were Mary, Martha, Nancy, Adam, Jean and John. The only grandson to fin¬ ish his days in Bath County was John Usher Dickenson. Capt. Adam Dickenson and Col. John Dickenson were no doubt the early Virginia progenitors of the Barbour County Dickcnsons. ran*: I Aur-i 10 _ SI -'i.?r ion 1o n .ill n air . ,iSiw*T7 . ‘ fil/' y-i n^n oi 7/ ,nca .Biejiuji. ni i-oi ‘ n nciq oMbt* r ir .i. • j r.r/«> ooj no*no;oKJ nu:b A .;q&D ■ iioiJ )*>« tedi of orf i«o^ ifidw nwon>! ion u I ,f / (,|j. ) ‘l )!

Prior to 1738 the entire Shen¬ andoah Valley, with much more territory west and south¬ west, was a part of Orange County. In 1738 it was cut olT from Orange and divided into two counties, Frederick and Augusta. However these two counties were not duly organized as counties until 1745. In 1777 Rockingham County was formed from Augusta; in 1780, Bath; and in 1847, Highland. In December of 1745 the county court of Augusta was organized and held its first sitting. Prior to that time it had become the refuge and abiding place of a strong body of Scotch-Irish immigrants. The bounds of the county were limited on the north by what was known as Fairfax’s Northern Neck Grant, and by the boundaries of Maryland and Pennsylvania to the westward of Fair¬ fax; on the east by the Blue Ridge mountain; on the south by the Carolina line. On the west its territory em¬ braced all the soil held by the British without limit or extent. For about 12 years the county court of Augusta was the only court and repository of records within that district. From the end of that period from time to time its jurisdiction was restricted by the erection of other coun¬ ties as the demands of the settlers required. Its original Constitution embraced all Virginia west of the Blue Ridge (with the exception of the Northern Neck Grant, whose southern boundary was in the present county of Shenan¬ doah, and western, through the counties of Hardy, Hamp¬ shire, and northward to the Potomac) ; the whole of the present state of West Virginia; a portion of the present western Pennsylvania, including Pittsburgh, which was, at times, the seat of the county court; and the lands on the waters of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The first officers of Augusta County were: James Pat¬ ton, sheriff; John Madison, clerk; Thomas Lewis, sur¬ veyor. Col. James Patton, the first shcrifT of Augusta, was con¬ sidered the richest man of the Augusta settlement.

He was killed in battle in 1755 in the French and Indian War. The section of Augusta in which William Stuart set¬ tled, the upper Cowpasture, later became a part of Bath County, and still later it became a part of Highland County. The following interesting description of High¬ land County is taken from Morton’s History: “In form the county is an irregular quadrangle, its corners looking nearly toward the four cardinal points of the compass. The transverse distances are about 30 miles in a northerly and 27 miles in an easterly direction. The area, according to the books of the county surveyor is 291,445 acres, or 455-3/8 square miles. According to the boundary survey of 1848, it is 390 square miles. “East and west Highland has natural boundaries. In the former direction the line follows the crest of the lofty Shenandoah, or Great North Mountain. In the latter di¬ rection it follows the backbone of the Alleghany system. The bordering counties arc Augusta and Bath in Vir¬ ginia, and Pendleton and Pocahontas in West Virginia. “Between the bordering ranges four parallel elevations run entirely through the county, dividing it into five well defined valleys. Passing from west to east, we may term these the Alleghany, the Bluegrnss, the Monterey, the Bullpasturc and the Cowpasture valleys. Several minor elevations occur, the most conspicuous being Middle Mountain, Little Mountain and Shaw’s Ridge. “The Main Alleghany, or Alleghany Front, is fairly regular in altitude, the average being about 4,000 feet. Lantz Mountain, forming the eastern border of what we have called the Alleghany Valley, is known in the south as Little Mountain. “The next of the principal ridges is known as Back Creek Mountain south of Vanderpool Gap, as Monterey Mountain between Vanderpool and Crabbottom gaps, and as Backbone Mountain north of the latter. Jack Mountain, the next of the Highland ranges, is the most elevated of those lying within the county. In the main arm of Jack Mountain four miles south of Monterey, is • j:-j in,' oj * ill mute i )i;5 no mill ritew -in* T^irmut f . -tec.

The name of the knob is derived from the hollow sound produced by footfalls on a certain limited spot, apparently the roof of a cavern. “Bullpasture Mountain, the fourth of the leading in¬ ternal ridges of Highland, is quite high, yet is less a well defined range than any of the others. It is a belt of table land, occupying almost the entire breadth between its bordering rivers and cut by deep ravines into a labyrinth of hills. “East of Bullpasture Mountain is Shaw’s Bidge, a low narrow, isolated eminence entering from Pendleton and terminating abruptly at the mouth of Shaw’s Fork. Still further west is the massive Shenandoah Mountain, its lofty sky line being quite uneven and showing toward the southeast corner of the county a deep depression. “It is now in order to mention the five valleys of High¬ land. The westernmost, which we call the Alleghany Valley, is deep, quite narrow, and thinly peopled. In the south it is drained by Back Greek, flowing southward. In the north it is drained by Straight Fork, a tributary of the North Fork. “The next, or Bluegrass Valley, illustrates two notable features of the Appalachians. It is crossed by slight di¬ vides rendering its drainage complex instead of simple. It is also canoe shaped, being quite long in comparison with its breadth. Its length, in fact, is that of the county. In the northern half of the county, the Bluegrass Valley is much broader than in the southern, and is distin¬ guished by the name of Crahbottom, a contraction of Crabapple Bottom. The upper and middle sections of the Crahbottom are rendered double by a very low ridge. The western and lower part of these sections is curiously interrupted by low, oblong hills, running not with the valley but across it. Toward the center is a large expanse of comparatively smooth land, almost suggestive of a Western prairie. This is the original Crabapple Bottom, the name not having been applied at first to the entire section of Bluegrass Valley now known as the Crab- bottom. “The Monterey Valley is so broken by minor ridges 't. vv.f ?

North of its center a rather high cross ridge passes from Monterey Mountain to Jack Mountain, and on this water parting lies the county seat. The hilly district reaching to the Pendleton line is known as the Straight Greek Valley. Except as to the pastures of Big Valley and the fine bot¬ toms of Jackson’s River, the Monterey Valley falls quite short of Bluegrass Valley in agricultural importance. “The Bullpasture Valley is drained throughout by the river of the same name. Its lowlands are almost wholly to the west of the stream. Above the belt of river bottom lies a considerable breadth of low tableland, sometimes hilly and sometimes comparatively level. The Bullpasture Valley proper reaches into Bath as far as Burnsville, where it merges into the narrow valley of Dry Fork. “Beyond Bullpasture Mountain is Cowpasture Valley, similar in its characteristics to the one last named. The uplands lie on the left bank rather than the right, and except for Shaw’s Ridge in the upper half, it is quite free from minor elevations. “The average altitude of the county is quite high — about 2800 feet — and the series of cross ridges throws the drainage in opposite directions. Highland is, there¬ fore, a birthplace of rivers. No fewer than ten streams flow out of it, while only two or three insignificant trib¬ utaries flow into it. Northward of the cross ridges, High¬ land lies in the basin of tbe Potomac; southward it lies in the basin of the James. In the former section are the upper courses of Laurel Fork, Straight Fork, South Branch, Blackthorn, South Fork and Brushy Fork. In the latter section are the upper courses of Back Creek, Jackson’s River, the Bullpasture, and the Cowpasture. “At Hightown is a red roofed barn, the rainwater from which feeds both the Potomac and the James. Nearby is the spring which is the fountain head of the South Branch of the Potomac. In coursing down the Crabbot- tom tbe brook rapidly gains volume, especially from Spring Run and Wimer Run, which issue, respectively from the coves on the western and eastern sides of High Knob.

Toward the county line Jackson’s River is the upper course of the James River and should bear the same name. “The Bullpasture is formed at Doe Hill by the union of the three brooks, one of which rises in Pendleton county. At McDowell it receives on the right the ei ght mile tributary of Crab Run. At the Bath line the Bull- pasture is a longer and larger stream than is Jackson’s River at the same border. Just within the Bath line it turns eastward, its foaming waters passing through a narrow and picturesque gap into the Cowpasture Valley at Williamsville. “To the above named point the Cowpasture is a shorter and smaller stream. It is properly a tributary, although below the confluence it retains the name of the united waters. Above, the Cowpasture has no tributaries of any length, save Shaw’s Fork and Benson’s Run.” i I b <je»> moiiruM* ; :oht ■'* Mfil' fi’uoc ? ,n vol .mimia Him biqBi bne ^ill fcnitoatlos bns ,fi ^olrlpitl 18 «i*ah iov rH /nogJaai* *tu<kj lo ooitote *>Hm s/ft b *to ^Hfltnb ,q*3 In- jidhtv«sV dj iioxfU ft aw In omidov sldaiobituoo b i Kjr.ii •('] r.[ m vi e’fnw 4 oii r( () ino!> odt hifiwoT tioir.u s>/!f y ; H ooO hi br-fmol a\\ oifila«qUii8 cu V' ooloflKi.9cI ni eoerj doidw to oho f«4ooid ooirii 9fU lo -• ‘hi r t * * :> i i ih silt iA .nijr' Iai3 1 > yik uriiJ oiim s'noHihei ni nr.iil mtints Iojb isftnol w ui oujtesq • b iifcucwiD ;.nb««q ®i;>Jsiw gainiiiol ?.li Jr/cv/j^no miut /•hi ‘Jif i q/7o? *ift oloi q«;’ oupKSiiftoiq hntft woiifin idj iotia u e?s CTmta&qvroD od) !nioq bsaign ovodc otU oT” rfpimritbi fYiiikKlhi S3 ’(fisqoifj i-i Jl .tncnte idUania bna 1‘iHrsfi )iu to orton idJ ani#; j*i li oonouRnoo orH wolsd Mif; -o z-':ib: - f (> > d • i;» >.cqw< ) oitl ,'jvod /> .ioJnvr ’..-or t^n^i h [ no jho*] iViid2 ovfis /h* ioI ' 18 History of Stuart Family CHAPTER VI In 1746 Thomas Lewis, the surveyor of Augusta County, laid oh* 21 tracts of land on the Bullpasture and the Cow- pasture. But nearly all these tracts were on the former stream. In addition to this work he ran lines for 14 per¬ sons, nearly or quite all of whom were then living in that community. At that time there were not quite 6,000 white persons living in Augusta. The county seat was then known as Beverly’s Mill Place. The settlers on the Bullpasture at the time of Lewis’s survey were: Alexander Black, John Carlile, Robert Gar¬ ble, Wallace Ashton, Loftus Pullin, Richard Bodkin, James Miller, Matthew Harper, William Warwick, James Largent, William Holman, John Mc’Creary, Samuel Dela- montony, Archibald Elliott and Robert Armstrong. Black lived just above the mouth of the Bullpasture. The others, mentioned above, lived on the Bullpasture itself in the order in which they are named as one ascends the river. The Carliles lived and died on their homesteead, which was held by members of the family many years after the pioneers died. The late John G. Carlisle, a famous Kentucky statesman, was a descendant of those Bull- pasture Carliles. Wallace Ashton, another of the original settlers, soon disappeared from sight. As to what became of him, noth¬ ing is known. Wallace Estill got posession of the farm and lived on it about 20 years. He sold to John Peebles and removed to Botetourt. Pullin has been mentioned in a preceding chapter. Bodkin came with sons nearly grown. During the next 40 years nearly all the family drifted out of that section. Miller came with sons, John, William, and Hugh. Harper soon left. Of Warwick, Largent and Holman, nothing is known other than that they once lived on the Bullpasture. And little or nothing is known of Delamon- tony, Elliott and Armstrong. John Mc’Creary sold his land to Bodkin in 1763. It appears he had a son who married a daughter of Black.

Mc’- Creary, one-time Governor of Kentucky and one-time U. S. Senator from that State. Thomas and Hugh Hicklin are named in 1756. They lived below the Carliles. Robert Graham was living be¬ low the Carliles in 1755. Samuel Given purchased the Bodkin homestead in 1762. Samuel Ferguson was living above McDowell in 1754. Other settlers of that period were: William Wilson, Samuel Wilson, William Mc- Candless, William Johnson, Robert Duflield and Joseph Malcomb. On the Cowpasture in 1754 were Hackland Wilson, William Price and Charles Gillam, or Gilliam. James Trimble, a surveyor and land speculator, had three tracts on this river at that time. George Wilson, another land speculator, had several tracts, one of which he sold in 1759 to William Stuart. Stuart settled just below the mouth of Shaw’s Fork. The earliest settlers on Shaw’s Fork were John and James Shaw. They gave their name to the stream and to a mountain. They were there about 1756. In 1766 Thomas Devericks settled in that neigh¬ borhood. Farther down the Cowpasture at the mouth of Benson’s Run, James Anglen was living in 1751. On Jackson’s River William and Stephen Wilson were living in 1753 and David Moore in 1759. The Wilsons were ancestors of the late William L. Wilson, who was one of the most distinguished statesmen West Virginia ever produced. The first known settler in Crabbottom, the real garden spot of Highland, was Robert Cunningham, who pur¬ chased a tract of James Trimble in 1761. Later settlers in the Highland area were: James Burn¬ sides, Andrew Lockridge, Dawson Wade, Edward Hines, Abraham Hempenstall, Tully Davitt, John Iliner, John McCoy, George Benson, William Price, Thomas and Peter Wright, George Nicholas, David Bell, David Frame, Robert and John Dinwiddie, William Given, James Mor¬ row, Peter Hull, Bernard Lantz, Michael Arbogast, John Gum, Palsor Naigley, Peter Zickafoose, William Ren¬ ick, William and Francis Jackson and Henry Erwin.

Most of them settled on the Bullpasture, the Cowpasture, and Crab- bottom. George Benson purchased in 1776 on the Cowpasture at the mouth of the run which bears his name. He was a son of Matthias Benson, who died in 1794. From those Highland Bensons the Barbour County Bensons are des¬ cended. The late U. S. Senator Joseph Benson Foraker, of Ohio, was also a descendant of those Highland pioneers. \"!9rfl ; .»M .OVi brc OKf fit>r*ted oiorU iwHlM Ms d«i*> h i . .oirl8j?' ro>) oib ,oiuleaqHi 8 sol bo'lloa .aioMod ^ tvr rV, O jfJ - K~l m iwarfotiiq noacnH dgio^O oftw $H «ffi rrrmi i( ;il/.r nin orM lo ill worn o*H iB o«od) incrrf MKi iff b»ib orf w jiaenofl a/udlloM lo nog b . i ' i: ‘ >c(A >i > ^ ••' /J •••;'» Ai’ .t>oha9J hfTRhfv H 9«o*U lo tnatMYwmU b Ocfe *bw foutO >o History of Stuart Family 21 CHAPTER VII The Indians used the Shenandoah Valley as a hunting ground and as a road over which Southern and Northern tribes traveled to and from battle engagements. It does not appear from records available that there were any Indian villages in the valley. The Indians prized the valley greatly as a hunting ground, and bitterly strug¬ gled to repel the white invader. It was the scene of many bloody encounters between the two races. From the establishment of the county in 1745 until the outbreak of the French and Indian War, the inhabitants of Augusta got along with the Indians without any serious difficulties. The news of Braddock’s disastrous defeat reached Augusta one week after the battle. It brought consterna¬ tion to the settlers. Many of them left their homes and hastened across the Blue Ridge to the older and more thickly settled communities. But the majority of the settlers were of sterner stuff. They remained and de¬ fended their homes. There were no fights of any consequence between the whites and the Indians in the area now comprised by the county of Highland. A few women and children were carried off as prisoners and a few white men were killed, but the losses suffered in that area were insignificant as compared to the losses in some other sections of Augusta. There was only one fort in Highland. Of course every house, or cabin, was built with the view to protection of the inmates from Indian attacks. It was built of heavy logs, and had loopholes through which those within could fire upon the savages. It had only one or two win¬ dows, and they were so small that a person could not crawl through them. The cabin was built near a spring and at some distance, if possible, from any place that might afford ambush or concealment for the foe. The Highland fort was built on the Bullpasture River, a few miles south of the present village of McDowell. It was built on land that was afterwards owned by the late Lewis M. McClung, a prominent and aged citizen of Highland, who died in the year 1927.

At the time the fort was built, about 1754, the stream that is now known as the Bullpasture River was probably called Clover Creek. The records of Augusta show that the stream was first known as Newfoundland Creek. Just when it was given the name of Bullpasture we are unable to say. We understand the site of the fort is still plainly dis¬ cernible. Of course all the timber used in its construc¬ tion long ago disintegrated into dust of the ground or was destroyed by human agencies, but marks of the founda¬ tion are yet in evidence. There is no record of the fort’s ever having been at¬ tacked. But for several summers the settlers of that com¬ munity lived in it, because they did not know what hour they might be attacked. During the winter seasons the settlers were fairly free from attacks. The Indians did not roam about much in the winter time. From the outbreak of the French and Indian War until General Wayne’s victory in 1795 no cabin in Highland was free from the menace of the red man, for any con¬ siderable time. Indeed it seems that the homes of that region were not safe until a later period. We have been informed that in the winter of 179G-’97 the Indians were so numerous and hostile that the remains of our pioneer ancestor, William Stuart, had to be carried across the Bullpasture Mountain and interred in or near the Clover Creek stockade or fort. It is said the Indians would dig up the body of every white person they could find in order to get the scalp. For the protection of the settlers two men would take enough food to last three or four days and go out into the forest to look for Indian trails and signs. Upon finding evidence of the presence of savages they would at once proceed to warn the settlers. These men were called rangers. They would cover a territory of many miles in circumference, sometimes as many as 30 miles. When their provisions gave out they would return to the settle¬ ment, and then two other men similarly equipped would go out into the forest to look for the savages. Many of the rangers became more proficient than the Indians in ! so rjftmui i _ i>;'| jA i' \\ TO ol -m!’ *;:> i tfi.kiA c'Yfl ViJ' idr / tfti/il ti ■ 1!>1 1<5 3llt t Vw IU‘ B a 7/ J Ofb omit b'lKaa ^hitidcnq *«w *!5?iH 97ut<'i:qt(uH 9fU aft uy/oft:4 won i» 1 f!l -voita r.

Our an¬ cestor, William Stuart, it appears, saw much service as a ranger. At the commencement of the French and Indian War he joined a company of rangers under Captain William Preston. His hrothers-in-law, Loftus Pullin and John Dickenson, were also members of Capt. Preston’s rangers. That part of Augusta embraced by the present county of Bath suffered far more from Indian depredations than did the Highland area. A tribe of Shawnee Indians lived in the southern part of Bath. Those sections of Augusta which later became Alleghany and Pendleton counties suffered more at the hands of the Indians than did Highland. In Bath there were Forts Lewis, Dickenson, Dinwiddie, and another at a place now known as Green Valley, which seems to have been named Fort Nelson. Several whites were killed at Fort Dinwiddie, among whom were James Stuart and John Byrd. The latter’s wife and six children were carried away into captivity. James Stuart, one of the victims at Dinwiddie, was probably a brother of William Stuart. He came to the Cowpasture in 1750 where he received by patent some 300 acres of land. He was killed in 1757. That same year there was horn to William Stuart and Margaret Usher Stuart their first child, who was given the name of James Stuart. But it is very probable the child was named for his paternal grandfather rather than for an uncle. It is a custom in Scotland, and has been from time immemorial, to name the eldest son for his father’s father. Of course James Stuart, who was killed at Fort Dinwiddie, may have been William Stuart’s father, hut it is not likely that he was. However we have no evidence to prove or disprove it. John Byrd’s wife and six children were captured while fleeing from their home to Fort Dinwiddie. The only one of the family that ever returned was John Byrd, Jr., who was 8 years old when captured. He was lf> when he came hack to the community from which he was carried away a prisoner. When he returned he was wearing a gold chain fastened to punctures in his nose and ears.

The name of the county is said to have been proposed by Andrew H. Byrd, a delegate from Bath, upon the suggestion of Samuel Ruckman, member of a well known Highland family. The justices appointed by the Governor met in Mon¬ terey May 20, 1847. They were George W. Amiss, Em¬ manuel Arbogast, Abel II. Armstrong, David H. Byrd, James Brown, Andrew Byrd, James B. Campbell, Ben¬ jamin Fleisher, George Hicklin, Peter Hull, Thomas Jones, John H. Pullin, Samuel Ruckman, John Sitling- ton, Reuben Slaven, Adam Stephenson, Jr., and Charles Stuart. Charles Stuart, one of the justices mentioned above, was the eldest son of Edward Stuart, I, and a brother to Edward Stuart, II, and Robert, John, and William Stuart of Harrison. Major Peter Hull, the first president of the court or hoard of justices, was named as the first sheriff’ of High¬ land. His sureties were Andrew II. Byrd, Jas. B. Camp¬ bell, John Graham, Frederick K. Hull, and Charles Stuart. Adam Stephenson, Jr., was chosen clerk of the court; John C. Woodson, commonwealth’s attorney; Joseph Layne, commissioner of the revenue (assessor) ; Thomas Campbell, surveyor; John B. Stuart, coroner. Householders living on the Bullpasture in 1848, as lo¬ cated on the map of the county surveyor, were: R. T. Gray, Widow Hicklin, Edward Curry, C. Malcomb, John Stuart, W.

The earliest preachers in the Highland area of whom we have any record were James Ward, William Taylor, Jared Morgan, Otlio Wade, William C. Ilolcomb, William J. Rider, Thomas Edmond, John S. Pullin, Thomas E. Morton, and George W. Varner, nearly all of whom were old-time Methodist circuit riders. The Rev, Otlio Wade married Catherine Callahan, a daughter of Charles Callahan, of Rockingham, and a sis¬ ter to Mary Callahan, wife of Edward Stuart, Sr. It was Otlio Wade who officiated at the marriage of Edward Stuart, II, and Peggy Stuart. The Rev. Wade was ordained by the famous Bishop Francis Asbury. His ordination reads as follows: “Know all men by these presents that Francis Asbury, bishop of the Methodist Church in America, under the protection of Almighty God, and with a single eye to his glory, by the imposition of my hands and prayer, have this day set apart Otho Wade for the office of a Deacon in the said Methodist Episcopal Church, a man whom I judge to be well qualified for that work; and do hereby recommend him to all whom it may concern, as a proper person to administer the Ordinances of Baptism, Mar¬ riage and the Burial of the Dead, in the absence of an Elder, and to feed the flock of Christ, so long as his Spirit and Practice are such as become the Gospel of Christ, and he continueth to hold fast the Form of sound Words, according to the established Doctrines of the Gospel. “In Testimony Whereof, I have herewith set my hand and seal, this 4th. day of March in the year of our Lord, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Nine. “Francis Asbury. “Done in Harrisonburg.” The first school teacher in Highland was William Stuart, the progenitor of the Highland and Harrison d£ -117/ t9nm i irut ill i // ,nol‘ioT/i aBinoiff tnoJToM fneilliV/ ,niwO ndoi ,niwO bjboM (rrr.vO ,A rmiilii' ; ,niw’i> Jiodojl nil l»dA ,b '.a >i *1 bivoG ,no< jo. fiT : »C1 ruo8fi9?i .11 - rnodv/ \\o AiDic haftlrl^iH sd) ill ewfoimq )»i!w o 1 ' » fill iW tdimrdol 1 d) «Tf ‘ 7/ ,;>'>» 7 • t*l i<) .li afimoiP # ri 1 1 1 sj *f wk>l ,bt]orriba:- efiffiot!

He was probably tbe first school teacher in all the vast area west of the Shenandoah Mountains. lie may have been the first in Augusta County. However, we are not at all sure of that. But our examination of the records and history of Augusta fails to bring to light any¬ one who did any teaching prior to the time of William Stuart. From what information we can find, William Stuart was well educated, especially in mathematics. It seems that soon after his arrival in America he began teaching and taught quite regularly for a number of years there¬ after. Another early teacher was John Sprowl, or Sproul, an Irishman, who was teaching at his home near the mouth of Dry Branch about 1790. He also did surveying in addi¬ tion to his work as a teacher. It is our understanding that ex-Governor Sproul of Pennsylvania is a descendant of the early Highland teacher of that name. Some others who taught in the Highland area in the early days, but at a much later period than William Stuart and John Sprowl, were James McNulty, William C. Holcomb, Jacob Bird, David H. Bird, James Slaven, Wil¬ liam Lowery, Mitchell Meadows, William S. Thompson, John Bradshaw, Patrick Mallory, Joel Hidy, John A. Hidy, William Life, James Ervine, George Dameron, and S. C.

We only wish we knew more. It is very probable that we shall never know any more about him than we now know. We know of no more information about him in any of the records or histories or archives of Augusta, Bath and Highland. We know nothing at all of the man’s mental and physical characteristics, except that he must have possessed all the courage and hardi¬ hood which we associate with the typical pioneer and frontiersman. None of our ancestors whom we personally knew ever saw the Scotch pioneer, William Stuart; and we do not remember ever hearing any of them relate any incident or history of his life that had been handed down to them by any of their immediate forebears. Our Grandmother Peggy Stuart was born four years after the death of her Grandfather William. If she had any history or tradition of him, we do not recall ever hearing her tell it. Her hus¬ band, our Grandfather Edward Stuart, was horn the same year in which his Grandfather died. According to one authority that we found, William Stuart was horn about 1732, and came to this country about 1755. Whether those dates are correct or approximately correct, we do not know and have no means of determining. We believe, however, that they are not far wrong, if they are wrong at all. We do know just about the time of his death. We know he made a will on December 27, 1796, and in Feb¬ ruary of 1797 the will was probated in the clerk’s office at Warm Springs. Hence he died some time between those dates. We are justified, we think, in saying he died in 1797. We know that William Stuart married Margaret Usher, daughter of Edward and Anne Usher; that he was a sol¬ dier in the French and Indian War, and was given land by the English government for his services in that war; that he was a member of Capt. William Preston’s com¬ pany of rangers; that in 1759 he settled at the mouth of Shaw’s Fork, on the Cowpasture, on land purchased of George Wilson, a prominent land speculator of the time; xi mfHAm ft al HfluJ2 mr.ill'W loo/foici .odJ Juodfi noitafiriolnl iuO nr ,( luodr yiorn yns wood -ir/sri tied* aw )*dJ sldedcriq hpojta ^dtemJojntub Iftoiaydq bns lo)ri?mi e’jiSfO 3d) io -dnnd bna di|ft*UJoo ad) Ha bdaaottsoq 9vi?d Jaiffm arl Jj§rf! bm iDOftoiq Isyiqy) or!) dl:*r 9)aion&?a ow dA: n boor! lava v ran A yftuatMnoq 07/ inocfw moiaaoriB iuo lo onoVI ftioUfani yns ob fn mod) lo ynft jjnhaod nova lOdmairm modi o) awob bobnsri nas»d bed Jad) giif eid lo wiotaid *io o: dio fibriflir) 11 in ./ floaoiol . ,i ba ran i mdi \\o vne yd 13d Ho ritaa 1 of!) 13)1*5 rm*y mol mod bb w JibijI2 vggo*! nojJioBi) yioteid yrm bmi oi’w II .xnnifliV/ lodtelBimD -fcijfi *ioU i H >t vs* $aiiit‘nf v. n tlioai Ion ob 3w fi id lo on i /$# 3d) mod B£// ,)i8ijJ2 btBwb'l idrftBlbnalO mo ,bnud ion ob aw 'to'tvsoo Join mbunqq* *10 Idstiod oib zoJeb ,s #n >d oh iinifirfm'dob lo anodcn on ovnd ‘ rtg wowl • c /s 5 vo. t if .j,rio*3 fj if i Jon 91c yoill Jfift? . owon yVr .dm ) ail Ho on il in?) )noda Jaiq won . ob 0 \"V .He In -do [ . i m ,'#TvI io(‘ i!::)'j(i no ! iw fi o 1 )ii v/ 1 softie a'lhota ad) ni bslcdoiq aaw lliw ad) VfPtl Ho yietn ' rn haib ad fcaivn* « i .dnirfl ov* .bailliaui oob aW .asJab /radaU JmttjmJ *oni nxi JinnJS msilliV/ tadf worn! oW - •• • n* d . rod .'. oiiui b*u; b owb. . lo loidgufdj t 0 * aw bins fi ;V7 n i I biis fbno H 01 t in .uib ii fi) ni aodwisa arid 10I Inorfifnavog r!ail^i3 a/J) yd -rnoa a iioJaai1! .)qar) lo ladmarn a new ad liiil) lo Ijjfoiii ax II )u >ai))d« 9il I ni )b<;i iibi Ho yin f :o i :a.^dnjq ■ • d no ,rm!*rcrwoO aid no io3 8* /nd^ a if!

As we have stated before, we are informed that he was for some years clerk of the county court of Augusta. The deed to the land at the mouth of Shaw’s Fork, William Stuart’s home place, was made by George and Elizabeth Wilson, May 16, 1759. The number of acres was 105, and the consideration was 20 pounds, English sterling. The land adjoined land belonging to the Carliles. On February 10, 1761, William and Jean Sprowl deeded to William Stuart, for 30 pounds, 168 acres on the Cow- pasture. And on August 11, 1773, Dawson and Rachel Wade, of Botetourt, deeded to William Stuart over 100 acres on the Bullpasture, adjoining the land of Alex McCandles. William and Margaret Stuart, on May 14, 1767, sold to James Bodkin, for 27 pounds, 105 acres on the Cow- pasture, adjoining the land of James Clemons. The wit¬ nesses to this transaction were John Carlile, Hugh Hicklin, Francis Jackson, and William Black. The executors named in William Stuart’s will were his sons, James and William, the eldest and the youngest. The witnesses were Alex Wiley and John G. _ (the surname is illegible). The will conveyed land on the Cowpasture and the Bullpasture. The legatees or devisees were his wife and seven children. We know even less about Margaret Usher Stuart than we do about William Stuart. And in nearly all cases is that true of our knowledge of the wives of the pioneers. We are thrilled as we read or hear about the deeds and adventures of the pioneer men, but very seldom is any¬ thing ever said about the pioneer women, who, no doubt, were just as brave as the men and who, in general, suf¬ fered more of the hardships and privations of those times than did the men. How we wish we knew the life history of our early Virginia ancestress, Margaret Usher Stuart! The annals of her life would make a story more thrilling than any work of fiction. But that story is lost to us forever. The story of the romance of her parents, Edward Usher and Anne Perry, has already been told.

We have heard our Grandmother Peggy tell it many times, with but slight variation from the story as given in an early chapter. She doubtless received the story from the lips of her grandmother. Many, many times we have heard Grandmother Peggy talk about Lord Perry and the Ushers. But at that time we were not at all interested in family history, and un¬ fortunately we paid hut little attention to her talks about our ancestors. Hence we can recall but little of what we heard her tell. Usher is an Irish name. One of Ireland’s most distin¬ guished prelates and scholars was James Usher, who died in 1056 and who was Protestant Archbishop of County Armagh. He was also a writer of note. We do not know when our Great-Great-Grandmother Margaret Usher Stuart died, but it was several years after the death of her husband, probably 20 or more. We are sure Grandmother Peggy remembered her well. William Stuart, who was a brother of our grandfather and who was a year or two younger than Grandmother Peggy, remembered seeing her. Some of his grandchildren say that they very distinctly remember hearing him talk about seeing her. Of course if she lived as long as 20 years after the death of her husband, all our great-grand¬ father’s family saw her and remembered her. The children born to William and Margaret Stuart were James, Edward, John, Usher, William, Mary and Jean. All married except Usher. James, Edward and John were soldiers in the Bevolution. Two of them, Ed¬ ward and John, were at Yorktown at the surrender of Cornwallis. James Stuart * James Stuart, the eldest of the children of William and Margaret Stuart, was born January 7, 1757. In 1778 he served at Clover Lick Fort under Capt. Andrew Lock- ridge; in 1779 at Warwick’s Fort under Capt. Thomas Hicklin; in 1781 under Capt. Peter Hull and Col. John McCreary. For a while he served as a substitute for James Garble. October 20, 1794, he married Nancy Moore. to xli** «il * nwofljl y {ci mo i 8bw » moit jioiimi’iv Iri'jil t bid rfliw XnB/r b ‘9* Y.\\ V wilUb H> afi£ •xsUiMfa vhaa rrr. ni 09 rig * v7°** ' * 4»iftoffibari^ in > aqil aii *1 X10*'* Jli; *3MV 1,J- * lariJoaiittiBiO isari »v*ft OW B9rtiiJ yn am •v.n«M j mi) f cilt U< tufl -in aria ‘J a fit b«a yna'- bioJ luooa / ’* juodfc a din I *nri o) uoilci-iiJA Jud bUq aw *bJsnuiiol -n:i;:ib t«o<n •'bufiietl io arrO .amen rle i! no el lade .olotjt lo isJiw » o/l« /.iv/ oil .rfg ii on A i3ri)ombn8iri-lcoiD ltoiO -ruo narlw won)!
