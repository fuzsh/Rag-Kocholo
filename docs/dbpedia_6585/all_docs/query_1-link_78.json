        "text": "Sketch of Life\n\nJohn Hall, III was born on March 21, 1980, to his mother, Tawana Ragland, and his father, John Hall, Jr. in Indianapolis, Indiana. He received his primary and secondary education in the Indianapolis Public School System. Later in life he earned his G.E.D. and returned to trade school.\n\nHaving professed a belief in Christ, he was baptized. His church affiliation was New Life Community Church of Truth under the leadership of Chief Apostle Sylvia Toney.\n\nJohn was a member of the International Hod Carriers and Laborers Union, Local #120. He later received his journeyman license. Even when not working, John Hall, III wore that hard hat very proudly. He also said that his great aunt Dora Lee Pence told him as a child, “Never let anyone tell you, you are a nobody, because you are a somebody.” He held that saying very close to his heart.\n\nEveryone who knew him knew that he loved his family and his friends beyond measure. John was the type of person that would pop up over your house at any given time just to check on you. He also would call any time of the day or night.\n\nJohn Hall, III was a friend for life if you met him. He loved to spend time with his son, AJon. He enjoyed fishing, cooking, and barbequing for the holidays. He kept a smile on his face and loved to joke.\n\nJohn Hall, III departed this earthly life December 30, 2022, at the age of forty-two years nine months and ten days. He was preceded in death by his father, John Hall, Jr.; grandfather, John W. Ragland; his grandmother, Willie Mae Hall, and a sister, LaChelle Hall-Wilson.\n\nHe leaves to cherish his memory his mother, Tawana Thompson; son, AJon Hall; grandmother, Carolyn Ragland; sisters, Amanda Boyd, Tiara Johnson, Nanticia Ridgnal, and Keesha Johnson; brothers, Jonathan Young and Edmund Hall, Sr.; aunts, Gloria Jean Hall and Stephanie Coleman; uncles, John D. Ragland and Joel Marcus Ragland; great aunt, Mary Bailey; great uncle, Ronald Bailey; special friend, Denise Richardson, a host of cousins, other relatives, loved ones and friends.\n\nRemembered in\n\nLove\n\nI have loved thee with an everlasting love.\n\n-Jeremiah 31:3\n\nHumbly Submitted The Family"
