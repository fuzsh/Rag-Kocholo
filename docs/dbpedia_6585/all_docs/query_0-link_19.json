        "text": "Athlete : Hockey\n\nYear Inducted: 1966\n\nDate of Birth: November 10th, 1881\n\nBorn in: Ottawa, Ontario\n\nCharles Bruce Stuart (deceased) was a Canadian amateur and professional ice hockey forward who played for the Quebec Bulldogs, Ottawa Senators, Montreal Wanderers, Portage Lakes Hockey Club, Pittsburgh Victorias and Pittsburgh Professionals from 1899 to 1911. Stuart is considered to be an early power forward, a forward who combines physical play with scoring ability, in hockey history.\n\nBruce and his brother Hod played for Ottawa in 1899. In 1890, they moved to Quebec city for business. They started playing hockey again in 1891, joining the Quebec Bulldogs. He then played professional in Pittsburgh and Houghton in the old International Professional Hockey League. Mr Stuart joined the Wanderers in time to win the Stanley Cup in 1908, and then captained the Senators in 1909 to the Cup.\n\nIn 1910, when the National Hockey Association (NHA) imposed a salary cap, cutting player’s salaries in half, Stuart attempted to form a rival league. The rival league failed to organize, as the Montreal Arena was refused to the players. Stuart returned to captain the Senators to the 1911 Stanley Cup. Stuart retired from playing after the 1910–11 season and managed a shoe store he owned in Ottawa until 1952 along with some coaching.\n\nDespite his age, he attended his induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961."
