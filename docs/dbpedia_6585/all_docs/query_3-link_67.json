        "text": "Born into a musical family in Staunton, Virginia, American saxophonist Tim Stuart cut his teeth performing with R&B, Soul, and Funk bands throughout Virginia at the tender age of 16. That early \"on the job\" education greatly influenced his sonic and professional direction, serving as both catalyst and testing ground to help find and develop his musical voice. The unique synthesis of fiery rock tone, tasty soulful grooves, and dynamic musical interplay that grew out of those early experiences on the road has propelled him to a successful career as a go-to musician for military bands and civilian recording artists across the globe. Not just another one trick pony, Tim has performed world wide on both saxophone and piano/synth with artists like Michael Lington, Nick Black, Rebirth Brass Band, Vince Lewis, Jan Nielsen, Marc Breitfelder, Hod O'Brian, Bob McChesney, the Artie Shaw Big Band, the US Army Blues, and the NATO Jazz Orchestra. As a group leader, his groups have opened on tour for international stars like Daughtry, comedians/TV stars Jay Leno & George Wallace, Miranda Lambert, Collective Soul, Sam Hunt, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Snarky Puppy, and Midnight Spaghetti and the Chocolate G Strings. He has performed live on US, European, and Middle Eastern TV & radio numerous times for events such as the NFL Pro Bowl Beach Party, Kentucky Derby, Wigan, Bansko, and Tournai International Jazz Festivals and had over 30 arrangements and original compositions performed by U.S. and International military bands across the globe.\n\nTim currently resides in Fort Walton Beach, FL along Floridaâ€™s beautiful Emerald Coast with his wife Kate and son Lennox. As a military musician, he can be found performing with various ensembles from the 313th Army Band (Huntsville, AL) and on various recordings with ensembles from the SHAPE International Band (Belgium) and 25th Infantry Division Band/Army Music Hawaii (Oahu, HI). Outside the military, Tim performs with recording artist Wayne Deaton in the hybrid Top 40 group \"Down to Party,\" as well as alongside acclaimed dueling pianist Nate Sangsland at Old Florida Fish House in Santa Rosa Beach, FL in addition to maintaining an active private saxophone studio and freelancing with groups across the US. He also performs as a single act for clubs, weddings, and corporate events along the Emerald Coast via \"Solo Sax Live!\" which blends live music with studio recorded backing tracks.\n\nTim is an endorsing saxophone artist for Warburton modular saxophone necks and exclusively uses Keilwerth, Cannonball, and Martin saxophones, the Akai EWI 4000s wind synth, Alexander Superial & Harry Hartmann Carbon Fiber saxophone reeds, Pro Tec saxophone cases, and Francois Louis & Vandoren ligatures. He also uses Westone IEM's, AKG, Telefunken, & sE Electronics microphones, and Roland, Korg, & Studiologic keyboards."
