        "text": "More or less a guess. But if you look at the history of the game and how players even up from era to era there is \"some\" truth to it, IMHO.\n\nFor example, Hod Stuart was one of the very best players in the early 1900's. He was one of the biggest players in the game at 6'0'' 190 lbs (you can view these findings in the ATD bio sections). If you adjusted due to his birth year, he'd be around 6'4'' and 230 lbs. Now if you take that he was one of the bigger players in the 1900-1910 range, it makes sense that he'd be 6'4'' or 6'5'' today. Think Chris Pronger or thereabouts.\n\nOver time, people evolve. So does science. Players are bigger, stronger, faster due to genetics, nutrition, weight trainings, supplements etc, etc. There is just so much more knowledge about training your body and players are on average, a good deal bigger today than 100 years ago.\n\nYeah, chickens are feeded with antibiotics for faster gain in weight.\n\nWe are feeded with chickens, so there you go.\n\nActually if go even further in history, for example if you visit some museums, castles or so...the average human in medieval or renesaincce was about 160cm.\n\nDonÂ´t I know it... IÂ´m an history nerd not only in hockey... and me being 188 cm, itÂ´s no joy visiting castles...\n\nNot so far back, but on the same subject: Napoleon complex is built on an myth. He actually stood around 5 feet 6 inches tall in modern international units. That sounds short, but the average male french in late 1700/earlie 1800 was 5 feet 5 inches in modern international units.\n\nMore or less a guess.

Likely some lived past 100 too. Yet the average life expectency might be 30 years old.\n\nIt is meaningless to adjust say Jean Beliveau's height based on his birthdate. It is meaningless in a single person.\n\nAll of which is why saying players from long ago couldn't play vs today's players is ridiculous IMO (which i always here). You have to compare era to era and understand that folks 100 (hell even 30-40 years) years ago didn't have the same advancements in many areas to play as fast or as big as guys today.\n\nSize always has been and and and always will be irrelevant in great hockey players. Every era has elite small and big guys. Patrick Kane And Shea Weber... Karlsson. Henri Richard and Beliveau. Like what 7/8 inches and maybe 50 lbs different? The exact same years overlapping? Gretzky vs Mario. Still no one is like Lindros... It has been 25 years since he was drafted. No one is just a pile of natural muscle like him.\n\nThe increase in average human height since industrialization is because of childhood nutrition:\n\nhttp://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-are-we-getting-taller/\n\nYeah. Anyone who tries to pass that off as biological evolution (and I see a lot of younger sports fans make those claims) doesn't understand the fundamental concepts of evolution. The increases we see over the decades is a result of better nutrition as you pointed out; but also better medical care, better control of chronic childhood diseases, cleaner water and air, ect. In other words, a multitude of external influences that have nothing to do with our genetics evolving. Genetically we're identical today with a human being living in ancient Babylon."
