Personal life

Born in Los Angeles, the only child of Sumner Aaron Cummings (1919-1977), a businessman, and Jan Mae (née Lies; 1928-2015), a bookkeeper. In June 2000, Cummings gave birth to a daughter, Anneke DiPietro, by her partner Donald DiPietro.

Film and television

Quinn Cummings began her career after being discovered by famed cinematographer James Wong Howe. She soon began landing roles in numerous television commercials, eventually winning the role of Marsha Mason's daughter, Lucy McFadden, in the 1977 film The Goodbye Girl. Cummings' performance was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture.

In 1978, Cummings landed a recurring role on the drama series Family. In 1985, Cummings also appeared in the short-lived ABC sitcom, Hail to the Chief, playing the daughter of the first female President of the United States (played by Patty Duke, who had previously appeared with Cummings in the 1980 telefilm The Babysitter).

During the late-1980s, Cummings acted occasionally and worked as a casting agent. In the 1990s, she quit acting because she wasn't comfortable living her life in the public eye and stated that, ..."nobody could conceive of hiring me". She went on to attend UCLA for two years, and had a stint recruiting writers to publish short stories online. Her last acting role was in a 1991 episode of Blossom.

Recent years

Inspired by the birth of her first child, Cummings created the HipHugger, a stylish, sling-type device for carrying a baby. She was the president of the HipHugger company, before selling it in 2006.

In February 2005, Cummings created The QC Report, a blog which discusses the ironies of modern life from the point of view of a career-mom in her thirties. It has received numerous recommendations including Newsweek's BlogWatch pick of the week.

Books and publications

Cummings' first book, Notes From The Underwire: Adventures from My Awkward and Lovely Life was published in July 2009 by Hyperion Books. Her second book, The Year of Learning Dangerously, which explores the current state of home schooling in America, was published by Penguin Books in August, 2012. (Cummings discusses why she decided to homeschool her daughter in a similarly titled YouTube video). Pet Sounds, a collection of (mostly) humorous stories relating to animals and pet ownership was released in the summer of 2013.

Cummings' work has also been featured in numerous publications, including The Wall Street Journal, Time magazine, People magazine, The Atlantic, Salon, Los Angeles magazine, The Huffington Post, Good Housekeeping, and others.
