        "text": "Quinn Cummings@laurenosandler's book THIS IS ALL I GOT is compelling, maddening, heartbreaking. She won't see this, because she seems to never be on here but it's an absolutely fascinating look at how the social safety net is gone, and what that means for one smart, pregnant woman. (Source)\n\nQuinn CummingsHAPPY PUB DAY @tomandlorenzo for LEGENDARY CHILDREN, the most fascinating, readable, dishy book on queer history, maybe ever. If you love @RuPaulsDragRace, if you're a member of the fam or if, like me, you just adore the community, get it. In LA? Get it @vromans. (Source)\n\nQuinn CummingsGot kids? Was once one? Youâre going to find this book fascinating. Wish I had it when Kid was 11; would have saved a great deal of shouting. In Los Angeles? Get it @vromans. #bookstagram #bookshelf #parenting https://t.co/lRQCvuMLJk (Source)\n\nMalcolm GladwellFor reasons I cannot explain, David Epstein manages to make me thoroughly enjoy the experience of being told that everything I thought about something was wrong. I loved Range. (Source)\n\nSusan CainItâs a joy to spend hours in the company of a writer as gifted as David Epstein. And the joy is all the greater when that writer shares so much crucial and revelatory information about performance, success, and education. (Source)\n\nKobe BryantThis book looks at how an emphasis on specialization can actually hamper our ability to really excel at something. It aligns with what I try to do when I am coaching, in my stories, and what weâre doing with Mamba Sports Academy â create all-around athletes who can think critically and make assessments in real time to enhance their play rather than rely only on a narrow set of skills.
