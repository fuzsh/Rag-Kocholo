        "text": "“Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.” — John Adams\n\nI frequently begin my work online with the phrase “A small story”; today, just to be ornery, I shall begin with two small stories.\n\nSmall Story #1:\n\nI knew a talent manager who looked for new children to represent at beauty pageants. Not the winners, mind you; those children were no longer capable of acting like actual children if they sensed attention from adults. No, she specialized in the ones who came in last, the ones who wandered off-stage, the bored little brother throwing a Nerf around. Anyway, I once dropped off something for her at a pageant and noticed the rented Days Inn conference room was 95% parents, contestants, siblings and relatives, save one row of about seven middle-aged men, staring intently at the stage.\n\n“Are those…fathers?” I mumbled as I handed her the bag she had forgotten. She looked at them and rolled her eyes.\n\n“No,” she said, “Those are…fans of children’s beauty pageants.”\n\n“OH MY GOD!” I screamed, involuntarily. Luckily, a small child onstage was butchering “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” so it wasn’t noticed. I then said, “Why did the coordinators let them in?”\n\nShe smirked and said, “Because they bought tickets.”\n\nSmall Story #2:\n\nWe have a friend who adores going to Thailand. He loves the food, the beaches, the quiet, the vicious yet gifted masseur he sees every year every day of his trip. He gets out of the big cities as quickly as he can but this last trip he had about six hours between the plane landing and the bus taking him to the middle-of-nowhere idyll where he annually vacations. He and his friend decided to walk around a surprisingly quiet local park that late afternoon, eat some street food, relax. They came around a bend and discovered a seating area and what appeared to be some kind of kid’s lip-sync contest with American pop songs. The kids were enthusiastic, the families were loudly supportive, it was that perfect combination of familiar and unexpected you can only pray for when you’re just getting your legs back under you after being on a plane for 18 hours. The two men sat nearby, soaked in the humidity and the familial conviviality until our friend started looking around.\n\n“The audience was,” he reported to us later, “About seventy Thai adults, about forty Thai preteens and about eleven white men.”\n\nOur friend and his travel companion left, quickly, before someone thought they, shall we say, had bought the ticket.\n\nWhere there are children, there are adults. Not every adult is benign. This is an inarguable statement, even in this glorious Age of Rage into which we have slid. Humans are notoriously bad as assessing where actual risk is. For example, the thought of that flight to Thailand fills me with nausea even though I know as well as anyone that my next trip to Glendale is far, far, FAR more likely to get me killed. I know I’m wrong and I still gummy up before a flight so that everyone doesn’t have to hear my aria, “What Was That Noise” because my data doesn’t override my panic and what is panic, really, but responding to data with, “But what if you’re wrong about plane safety…?”\n\nStatistically, I’m not wrong. I still behave as if I am.\n\nThis can go the other way as well; if we could learn from the actions of humans — either ourselves or others — there would be no more hangovers. As a born and bred Angeleno, I assure you that not one person has ever actually sent the cops on a high-speed car chase and gotten away but, damn it, there it is, on the TV again. Humans are not designed for this kind of risk-assessment. We have been recognizably human for over 200,000 years and during 99% of that time, we were designed to live in small groups of related beings, protecting the weakest among us and not eating what the smart ones told us to avoid. The further we get from that model, the harder it is for us to maintain our sanity, our sense of what’s right, our sense of ourselves.\n\nWhich brings us to children on social media. I am about to say something which will send a bunch of people around the bend.\n\nThe absolute bend.\n\nIf children are under the age of consent and are on social media where anyone can see them, they are being trafficked.\n\nBreathe.\n\nBreathe.\n\nWhatever you want to say, trust and believe someone has already shrieked it at me online. Now, let me explain why I’m correct. I didn’t say, “Sex-trafficked,” I said, “Trafficked.” The way you know they’re two different things is that there’s an extra word involved to indicate it’s a specialized form of trafficking. Here is the US Department of Justice definition of trafficking:\n\nHuman Trafficking is a crime involving the exploitation of a person for labor, services, or commercial sex.\n\nNow, just for clarity, let’s look up “Exploitation” in the old dictionary:\n\nThe act of exploiting.\n\nFair, but perhaps less than completely helpful. Let’s try “Exploiting”:\n\nTo make use of meanly or unfairly for one’s own advantage.\n\nThere we go. Children — being under the age of consent — can never consent. When someone decides, for whatever reason, to put their child online for remunerative gain — which is what we’re talking about on YouTube, on TikTok, on Instagram — they are being exploiting for labor and services.\n\n“That’s some bullshit, Quinn; those children are just having fun.”\n\nWe have no idea how many times Mom ran little Paysleigheeye through that slide before she got the shot she liked. Maybe the child wanted to do it; maybe she didn’t. Maybe she kind of didn’t but has already learned it’s not worth the fight. We will never know.\n\nWhich leads to the inevitable parry-riposte at me in the comments:\n\n“SO I GUESS YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE ACTED YOU BITTER KAREN FUCK YOU YOU’RE JUST JEALOUS.”\n\nAsk any actor how often they work. The answer is, “Never.” Statistically, in any year, 14% of the Screen Actor’s Guild’s union members make less than $30,000 and the union is a smaller cohort of the larger population. There is far more supply than demand. It’s entirely possible a child, even with an agent, will never book a job and will eventually get out because it’s boring to just audition. Yes, there are parents who are awful but you know how auditions work? The parent is in the waiting room and the kid goes into the room with the casting director and an associate. I worked commercial casting; I promise you, the kids who don’t want to be there make it abundantly clear once Mom is on the other side of the door. And if a child does book a job, there are laws and oversight in place to protect them. It’s not perfect — looking at you Nickelodeon — but the horror there was that if predators want to commit harm, they will deactivate the systems in place to keep them from their impulses. The predator there hired children whose parents didn’t know what their rights were and the parents were more concerned about getting their child fired than speaking up because, again, we’re terrible as assessing risk. On a set, there is a job, you do your job, you go home, where the job is not. When your parent is making the mortgage off your TikTok fans, you are never off the clock.\n\nYou know what we call people who can’t refuse to work? Give you a hint; 1861–1865.\n\n“THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. EVERYONE GETS TO PARENT THE WAY THEY LIKE.”\n\nAbsolutely. I have no expectation of changing the people suckling off that rancid teat. My goal is simple; I want to ruin looking at stranger’s kids for the average person. I want to put the lightest layer of slime all over it for you, and you, and you. I want you to be our friend in that park in Thailand, realizing he and his friend were just enjoying a summer night but, to the outside eye, just looked like another couple of American would-be rapists. I want to use strong words like “Rancid teat” and “Would-be rapists” to make this revenue stream less profitable. These parents — either innocently or not — have decided that strangers are more important to them than their children and if you think I’m overstating that, I ask you one question:\n\nWhat benefit does a child get from being seen by thousands of strangers?\n\nLet’s try another one:\n\nWhat benefit does the parent get?\n\nThe answer to the first is “Nothing” and the second is “Headpats from strangers and maybe money.” So the parents are creating content, using people who cannot consent, to attract and retain the attention of strangers. Our job as parents, our prime directive, the one job that if we fail it doesn’t matter how great we were at the other stuff, is to keep our children as safe as we can. There is no, not one, NOT A SINGLE ONE, reason to hand your children’s images to strangers for their delight. I won’t even talk about the news story that 50 Australian girls had their innocent images doctored into CSAM and put online. I won’t mention how AI is being trained on children’s faces. Those were two stories within one week.\n\n(https://www.wired.com/story/ai-tools-are-secretly-training-on-real-childrens-faces/)\n\n(https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/australia-schoolgirls-ai-nude-photos-scandal-b2561104.html)\n\nLook on the bright side; it’s not as if AI is getting better, smarter, more seamless with each passing hour.\n\n“YOU’RE JUST JEALOUS. AND BITTER,”\n\nOf what, exactly. Being the finest child-trafficker at your local Whole Foods, which you pay for with the money they make? I’m good, thanks. As the saying goes, “A hit dog will holler.”\n\nGod, I hate the phrase. Don’t hit dogs. But the idea that their rage at me is, at least in part, because they suspect I’m right seems valid. Their fury that I’m coming for THEIR friend, who they KNOW LOVES their kids and HOW DARE THAT BITTER BITCH QUINN SAY SOMETHING MEAN ABOUT MY FRIEND (that I have never met) is, at its heart, just awfully sad. So many people are so lonely. We’re designed to thrive when we’re sitting around the hard-earned fire at the end of the day, blankets of stars overhead and people we know and trust surrounding us, sharing food, keeping an eye out for our children, our future. We currently have none of this. The chasm between a real community and what modern society has insisted is “Just like community (here, buy some crappy stuff and work seven more jobs)” is making us crazy. Our children are the canaries in the coal mine of crazy and we’ve collectively decided that’s fine.\n\nAnd we cannot alter that state of facts and evidence until we’re willing to say it out loud.\n\n“YOUR FOUL MOUTH RAN YOUR EX HUSBAND RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF ANOTHER MAN. THAT’S WHY YOU’RE SO ANGRY.”\n\nOkay, that one’s fair."
