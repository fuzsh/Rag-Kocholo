        "text": "From Wikipedia:\n\nThe Bob Cummings Show (also known as Love That Bob) is an American television sitcom which was produced from 1955 to 1959, and originally sponsored by R.J. Reynolds' Winston cigarettes. The program began with a half-season run on NBC, then ran for two full seasons on CBS, and returned to NBC for its final two seasons. The program was later rerun in the daytime hours on ABC and then syndicated under the title Love That Bob.\n\nThe series starred Robert Cummings as a dashing young Hollywood photographer, Air Force reserve officer, and ladies' man, Bob Collins. The character's interest in aviation and photography mirrored Cummings' own in real life, with his character's name the same as the role he played in You Came Along (1945). The series also starred Rosemary DeCamp.\n\nThe Bob Cummings Show was important in the development of several careers. Its creator, producer and head writer was Paul Henning, later producer of major 1960s hits such as The Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, and Green Acres. Regulars in the show included Ann B. Davis, who twice won Emmy awards for playing \"Schultzy\". Henning apparently remembered cast members Nancy Kulp and Joi Lansing favorably, as both had roles on The Beverly Hillbillies, Miss Kulp as Miss Hathaway (secretary to banker Milburn Drysdale- a character similar to the one she appeared as- \"Pamela Livingston\"- on Cummings' show) and Miss Lansing as Gladys.\n\nPerhaps the biggest career boost was received by young Dwayne Hickman, a student at Loyola University in Los Angeles, who appeared as Bob's nephew and became a favorite with young women in the audience. After The Bob Cummings Show ended, he was cast as the lead in The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis.\n\nThis program represented the height of Cummings' television career. Although he made many further appearances as a guest star and again starred in a series in the early 1960s, My Living Doll, he never again achieved the success on television that he had with this program, which was rerun in off hours until black and white television series lost almost all of their audience in the 1970s and were essentially retired from syndicated distribution.\n\nCreated by Paul Henning\n\nDirected by\n\nRod Amateau\n\nBob Cummings\n\nFred DeCordova\n\nStarring\n\nRobert Cummings\n\nRosemary DeCamp\n\nAnn B.
