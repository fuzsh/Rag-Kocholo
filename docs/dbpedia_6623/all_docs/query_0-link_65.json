In 1985, Cummings also appeared in the short-lived ABC sitcom, \"Hail to the Chief\", playing the daughter of the first female President of the United States (played by Patty Duke).\n\nDuring the late-1980s, Cummings acted occasionally and worked as a casting agent. In the 1990s, she quit acting because she wasn't comfortable living her life in the public eye and stated that, ...\"nobody could conceive of hiring me\". She went on to attend UCLA for two years, and had a stint recruiting writers to publish short stories online. Her last acting role was in a 1991 episode of \"Blossom\".\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn June of 2000, Cummings gave birth to a daughter, Anneke DiPietro. She currently lives in Los Feliz, California with her daughter and her long-time boyfriend, Donald DiPietro.\n\nRecent Years\n\nInspired by the birth of her first child, Cummings created the HipHugger, a sling-type device for carrying a baby. She began selling the HipHugger and is now the president of the HipHugger company.\n\nIn February 2005, Cummings created \"The QC Report\", a blog which discusses the ironies of modern life from the point of view of a career-mom in her thirties. It has received numerous recommendations including \"Newsweek's\" BlogWatch pick of the week.\n\nFilmography\n\n*\"The Goodbye Girl\" (1977)\n\n*\"Listen to Me\" (1989)\n\nTelevision\n\n*\"Big Eddie\" (Unknown episodes, 1975)\n\n*\"Jeremiah of Jacob's Neck\" (1976)\n\n*\"The Six Million Dollar Man\" (1 episode, 1976)\n\n*\"Night Terror\" (1977)\n\n*\"Visions\" (1 episode, 1977)\n\n*\"Intimate Strangers\" (1977)\n\n*\"Starsky and Hutch\" (1 episode, 1978)\n\n*\"Baretta\" (1 episode, 1978)\n\n*\"CBS Library\" (1 episode, 1980)\n\n*\"Family\" (36 episodes, 1978-1980)\n\n*\"The Babysitter\" (1980)\n\n*\"Darkroom\" (1 episode, 1981)\n\n*\"Grandpa, Will You Run with Me?\" (1983)\n\n*\"Remington Steele\" (1 episode, 1984)\n\n*\"Hail to the Chief\" (Unknown episodes, 1985)\n\n*\"The Love Boat\" (1 episode, 1986)\n\n*\"Blossom\" (1 episode, 1991)\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\nAcademy Award\n\n*Nominated: Best Actress in a Supporting Role, \"The Goodbye Girl\" (1978)\n\nGolden Globe\n\n*Nominated: Best Motion Picture Actress in a Supporting Role, \"The Goodbye Girl\" (1978)\n\nYoung Artist Award\n\n*Nominated: Best Young Actress in a Movie Made for Television, \"Grandpa, Will You Run with Me?\" (1984)\n\n*Won: Best Young Actress in a Television Series, \"Family\" (1981)\n\n*Nominated: Best Juvenile Actress in a TV Series or Special, \"Family\" (1980)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n*imdb name|id=0191944\n\n* [http://qcreport.blogspot.com/ Quinn Cummings' Blog]\n\n* [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7937373/site/newsweek/ Newsweek Blogwatch]\n\n* [http://thehiphuggeronline.stores.yahoo.net/history.html The HipHugger Online]"
