        "text": "Although it started as a masculine first name, Quinn has evolved to a gender-neutral English variation of the famous Irish patronymic surname Ó Cuinn and McQuinn, which referred to the “descendant of Conn.” It could also have come from the forename “Conn,” which comes from Old Irish ‘cond,’ meaning “intellect” or “wise,” or ‘cenn,’ meaning “chief.” So, “wise” or “counsel” are other potential derivations of the name.\n\nWhat Does Quinn Mean?\n\nQuinn is an Irish surname derived from the older Gaelic O’Cuinn, meaning “descendant of Conn.” Conn is a traditional Irish forename that means “chief” or “leader.” Quinn may also have come from Irish-Gaelic ‘Ceann,’ which means “sense” or “intelligence.” In its Latin origin, the meaning of Quinn is “a girl who is as pretty as two,” while the meaning of Quinn in Greek is “fifth born” or “queen.”\n\nOrigin\n\nQuinn is a short one-syllable sweetheart derived from the Irish surname that checks off many boxes regarding baby name trends of today. Historically, the O’Cuinn clan served as quartermasters (supplying arms and provisions) to the kings of Ulster of Ireland for over four centuries. Although initially, Quinn was freely used on both genders in the United States, it gained greater acceptance as a name for baby girls.\n\nGender\n\nFemale\n\nPronunciation\n\nKuin\n\nKwin\n\nSyllables\n\n1 syllable\n\nLength/Letter\n\n5 letters\n\nName Variations/Spellings\n\nQuinn name variations are substitutes with a modern twist on more traditional takes.
