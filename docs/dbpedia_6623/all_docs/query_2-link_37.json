        "text": "Living in Beverly\n\nLease Massachusetts office, research, light manufacturing, or educational space on the large MA campus of Cummings Center, and then live in this delightful seaside community. Beverly, this exceptionally pleasant north-of-Boston town – with long stretches of beautiful oceanfront beaches and a population of about 39,000 – offers a wealth of amenities. Its wonderful public school system and several new or newly restored school buildings are the talk of the area. And sparkling Beverly Harbor offers some of the finest sailing and boating in all of New England.\n\nSettled in 1626, the city boasts Endicott College, North Shore Community College and Montserrat College of Art. The city has long been home to some of America’s most historic families and their gracious estates.\n\nBeverly is bordered by Salem to the south, Danvers to the west, Wenham to the north and Manchester-by-the-Sea. Beverly is 18 miles north of Boston, 88 miles south of Portland, Maine, and 238 miles from New York City. The vast majority of Beverly High School graduates attend four-year, private colleges.\n\nVisit Wikipedia The Free Encyclopedia for extensive Beverly information on-line.\n\nBeverly business history\n\nBeverly residents have watched an interesting shift over the past 50 years. The city’s business nucleus changed from a partially industrial city, with huge manufacturers such as United Shoe Machinery Corporation, to a city now featuring more than 500 professional services, computer and biotech industries now housed in Cummings Center.\n\nThis rebuilt former headquarters of United Shoe Machinery Corporation, long known as \"The Shoe,\" is a 1.7 million square foot architectural landmark and historic district. With the completion of 500 Cummings Center, Cummings Center now has a total of two million square feet. With a total of about 4,200 jobs, Cummings Center has brought more than 2,000 new jobs to Massachusetts.\n\nPublic transportation – bus and commuter rail – comes right to the door of Cummings Center, which makes it very convenient for staff members. Beverly has five commuter rail stops along its long expanse of coastline, and six access points to Route l28, Boston’s famous \"Technology Highway.\" Cummings Center is also less than two miles from Beverly Airport, a very popular local facility, reportedly with two 5,000' asphalt runways, plus hangers, service, tie-down facilities and charter availability. Beverly is well equipped to serve the needs of modern Massachusetts commercial real estate users. The biotech cluster in Beverly, MA is truly extraordinary as well.\n\nGoing way back, oceanside Beverly is the birthplace of the U.S. Navy. The first ship commissioned by the Continental Navy sailed from Beverly Harbor. Surprisingly, this New England city was also the location of the country’s first cotton mill and its first Sunday school as well. Today the upscale community is 85 percent residential, and offers a rich cultural and academic life, in addition to its first-class boating, beach activities, airport and spectacular golfing.(Courtesy Beverly Chamber of Commerce)\n\nYou were born here. You always thought you'd bring your family and your business back here - someday. You never thought you'd spend your whole life somewhere else. It was just going to be for a year or two after college. Why not do it now? Why not move back?\n\nIf you are a business owner or manager, your gateway to New England is Cummings Center in Beverly, MA.\n\nIt is a gleaming new building, like a phoenix rising up from the famous and venerable old shoe machinery factory. Though the exterior integrity of one of America's most architecturally significant buildings was maintained, the workers of yore would never recognize the metamorphosis inside. It is so appealing, in fact, that businesses have signed leases in record numbers - in record time. Space is going fast. More than 2,000 brand new jobs have been created. Cummings Center already produces a combined payroll of more than $200 million annually.\n\nClick to enlarge\n\nSince its April 28, 1996 opening, more than 500 businesses have signed on with more than 1.6 million square feet of MA office, executive office, laboratory and research space already leased. And Cummings Properties customizes every tenant's space to its exact specifications.\n\nMany Cummings Center firms do business with each other, as well as with the public. All tenant firms benefit from every possible amenity, without ever leaving Cummings Center - from childcare, to dry cleaning, to tax services, to banks, to restaurants, to the state-of-the-art North Shore Athletic Club.\n\nFor more information, click here for Cummings Center tenant comments and website links.

Isaac (Comins) Cummings landed here in 1638 and settled in the part of Ipswich that is now Topsfield, Massachusetts.\n\nIsaac was the (eight times) great grandfather of Cummings Center's founder, Bill Cummings. His life and that of many of his North Shore descendants is well documented in the 1903 book, \"The CUMMINGS MEMORIAL, A Genealogical History of the Descendants of Isaac Cummings, an Early Settler of Topsfield, Massachusetts,\" by Reverend George Mooar. Isaac was a deacon of the church, a constable, and in 1676, moderator of the Ipswich Town Meeting.\n\nBill Cummings was a descendant of Isaac Cummings on the line: Isaac, Isaac, John, Samuel, Richard, Philip, Ambrose, Erastus, Augustus and Augustus Cummings. The second Isaac was born about 1633, based on court testimonies that he was 60 years in 1692 and 63 years in 1696. He married Mary Andrews of Rowley Village (Boxford) on November 27, 1659. Born in Rowley Village on June 7, 1666, John Cummings was the fifth of their 10 children, and he married Susanna Town in Topsfield on December 24, 1688.\n\nJohn and Mary's son, Samuel, was born February 14 in 1708 or 1709, and married Susanna Hood in Middleton. They became early residents in the part of Stoughton, MA now known as Sharon, where Samuel died on December 11, 1704. Samuel and Susanna's 10th of 12 children, Richard, was born February 19, 1750, and married Jemina (Smith) Robbins of Walpole, MA in 1774, but soon moved to Sterlington (Union) Maine, where they built the second house there, the same year. (See \"COME SPRING,\" an early history of Union, Maine.)\n\nRichard and Jemina's son Philip married Hannah Grafton and died in Waldoboro, Maine in 1867. They had eight children including Ambrose, their firstborn. On September 21, 1833, Ambrose married Mary Ann Nash of Waldoboro, Maine, where he died in 1873. Their firstborn of 10 children was Erastus Grafton Cummings, who was born March 14, 1834 and died in 1929.\n\nErastus married Almire Knowlton in Monroe, Maine on April 9, 1860, and enlisted in the Union Army on August 29, 1862. Their firstborn of five children was Augustus William Cummings, who was born in Waldo (Smallville), Maine in 1862.\n\nAugustus married Nettie Marie Barstow in Somerville, MA on October 30, 1891. She was a native of Nobleboro, Maine, the daughter of George Barstow and Sarah York. Their fourth of five children was Augustus W. Cummings, Jr., who was born on January 24, 1899. Augustus Jr. married Dorothy Purington, who was born in Sunapee, New Hampshire on May 1, 1906, and they begot Bill Cummings, who was born in Somerville, MA on March 11, 1937.\n\nExtensive information about the Cummings Geneology is available through the family website, www.IsaacCummingsFamily.org."
