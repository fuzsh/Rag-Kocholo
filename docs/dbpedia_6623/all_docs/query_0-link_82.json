If you live in USA send a properly stamped and self addressed envelope (minimum size 8.5\" x 4\") with your request letter and a photo. You can include a piece of cardboard to keep the photo from bending in shipping and also add \"Do Not Bend\" on the envelopes. Send your letter and wait. On average, there is going to be a 3+ month wait for a response. If you do not live in USA, you can purchase your american stamps here *For information on postage prices to receive a letter from USA click here."
