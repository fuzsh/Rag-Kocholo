        "text": "Sometimes, two people meet, and the blend of their ambitions and skills multiplies the impact they would have had as individuals.\n\nKathleen Boyt Smith was born near Winchester in England on June 20, 1901. Her parents were missionaries, and she grew up in Algeria, speaking both English and French. She came to the U.S. to enroll at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, and contracted tuberculosis between her junior and senior years in medical school. She sought treatment at the Trudeau Sanatorium in New York State, which was recognized as a premier institution for treatment of TB.\n\nLewis Stanley Jordan was born in New York State on June 5, 1896. He served in the Motor Transit Corps of the U.S. Army during WWI and then resumed his education at the Cincinnati College of Medicine. Dr. Lewis Jordan contracted tuberculosis and entered the Trudeau Sanatorium as a patient. After he was healed, he remained there as a staff member and met a patient named Kathleen Smith.\n\nWhile Kathleen completed her medical education, specializing in the care of infants and children, Dr. Lewis Jordan accepted a position as physician at the Southwestern Sanatorium at Worthington, MN, in 1927. He moved to Granite Falls in 1929 to become the superintendent and medical director at Riverside Sanatorium, a tuberculosis hospital created by a commission from Chippewa, Lac qui Parle, Renville, and Yellow Medicine counties. The sanatorium also took patients from Big Stone, Brown, Redwood, and Swift counties.\n\nDr. Kathleen Jordan completed her internship in July 1930, and the two doctors were married in August. From then on, their work was guided by two philosophies: “No one is safe from tuberculosis until all are safe” and “Tuberculosis must be found before it can be treated.”\n\nAt the time, the medical profession was still trying to convince people that tuberculosis was not inherited but was contagious and spread by a germ. TB was also being passed from cows to humans via unpasteurized milk. A law passed by the state legislature in 1923 provided for the testing of all cattle over the next 10 years. The State Live Stock Sanitary Board supervised the administering of tuberculin tests, quarantining of affected cattle, and reimbursement for those slaughtered. Although the program was met with strong resistance in several areas, in 1934 Minnesota was designated as the 19th state to be accredited as having tuberculosis-free herds (less than 1 percent reacting to tuberculin). Tuberculin testing on herds was not popular in Riverside’s rural area, and it is not surprising that all of its counties were among the last to be accredited. The very last county to be accredited in Minnesota was Renville in 1934.\n\nAs the program began to show some success in slowing infection rates, the doctors Jordan asked, “Could we use that method with humans? If we test the youngsters, could we, if they are positive, watch them and prevent the disease from developing? Could we find the source of infection that turned them into a reactor and take care and hospitalize that person and remove them from being the source of infection?” This approach had also occurred to Dr. J. Arthur Myers, who was president of the Minnesota Public Health Association at that time. He offered Dr. Kathleen a position as “field survey physician” and encouraged the Jordans to pioneer a testing program out of Riverside Sanatorium.\n\nThat’s what they set out to do in 1930, and selling the idea wasn’t easy. The test was basically the same as that for the cattle. Most familiarly known as a Mantoux test, it involved injecting a small amount of purified protein derivative from Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacillus between layers of the dermis on a forearm. A person who had been exposed to the TB bacteria would form a raised reddened patch at the site of injection. TB could not be contracted from the injection, but many myths were spread about the procedure. Because of that, a lot of education needed to be done first.\n\nThe Jordans wanted to concentrate their efforts on schools, because children could have what was called “primary tuberculosis,” often mistaken for a cold. It could heal itself with calcification in the lungs around the germ, although it would cause a positive test reaction and be visible on an x-ray. The TB would often lie dormant until the teen years and then develop into active disease. At that point, the child would be contagious and could become deathly ill. Early detection and treatment could prevent that from happening.\n\nThe service-area counties totaled 3,800 acres and contained 265 rural school districts and 27 small towns and cities having both public and parochial schools. Many schools would not let them test, and the Jordans never went into a school without permission from the school board. In some districts, anti-testing people would stir up the other parents against the idea. By the 1930s, though, some school districts were requiring a physical checkup, so the Jordans bribed the schools. If the school would sign up at least 50 percent of parents or 50 percent of school children for tuberculin tests, Dr. Kathleen would do all of the school physicals that year at no charge. The first year, only 10 schools took them up on that offer.\n\nDr. Lewis’ role in this effort was twofold. If a person reacted to the Mantoux test, the next step was for them to be x-rayed at the sanatorium to confirm the presence of a tubercular lesion. People were asked to pay $1 if possible, but most of the cost was covered by Christmas Seal donations. If the person was indeed ill with tuberculosis, Dr. Lewis followed up with contact tracing to find others who might be contagious. In order to eliminate a waiting list and make room for potential admissions to the sanatorium, he had already rearranged furniture to temporarily exceed the 44-bed capacity for which the building was designed. Because of the sanatorium’s small size and equally small budget, Dr. Lewis read x–rays and did his own laboratory work.\n\nSeveral incidents helped turn the tide in attitudes toward testing. One involved a music teacher at Montevideo who died from far-advanced tuberculosis and had infected several students, two of which were admitted to Riverside. The school board passed a ruling that all school teachers and employees had to be tested. Another impetus was the high incidence of tuberculosis in Renville County, the one that was last in the state to comply with cattle testing in 1934.\n\nWith support from lay organizations such as Rotary, Kiwanis, Lions, American Legion, PTAs, and Farm Bureau, the Mantoux testing began. Tests were done with written permission from parents and guardians. Dr. Kathleen’s approach with younger children was to have them look to their right and shoot an imaginary lion or bear with their right arm while she quickly administered the Mantoux test to the left arm.\n\nIn 1930, an average 13.9 percent of all school children in the four counties reacted to tuberculin. In 1946, positive reactors within the four counties ranged from 1.8 to 2.7 percent. A follow-up study in 1950 revealed some dramatic drops in positive reactors from 1930 percentages. Clara City parochial went from 30.5 percent to 3.6 percent, Fairfax public school dropped from 21.3 percent to 2.2 percent. The improvement came not from using the test in isolation, but from combining it with its unusual-for-the-time unified system of contact tracing, isolation, and treatment.\n\nMeanwhile, some areas of the state were engaged in mass public x-ray inspections with mobile x-ray vans. The Jordans argued against this and believed that it was more important to concentrate testing efforts where clinical tuberculosis was likely to exist. After all, in order for tuberculosis to develop, contact infection needed to occur. Eliminating the sources of infection through identification and follow-up was their targeted approach.\n\nThe Jordans were invited to present their findings to the American School Health Association meetings in 1946 and 1950. The Journal of School Health published “Results of Twenty Years of Mantoux Testing in Schools” in 1950.\n\nIt is estimated that every two years Dr. Kathleen administered Mantoux tests to 18,000 public school children in the sanatorium’s service area. She is also credited with testing a total of 1.5 million school children throughout Minnesota as part of the Christmas Seal organization’s testing program that continued into the late 1950s. Dr. Myers, in his 1949 book Invited and Conquered, wrote that Dr. Kathleen probably did more tuberculin testing than any other living person.\n\nWith the advent of streptomycin, tuberculosis became curable, and sanatoriums became obsolete. Because of their testing work and the health surveys conducted at nearby Native American communities, the Riverside Sanatorium was the last small sanatorium to close. By 1963, the formidable Jordans had finally worked themselves out of a job.\n\nDr. Lewis opened a clinic in Granite Falls and did follow-up work with former TB patients until he died in 1965. Dr. Kathleen died in 1993 at the age of 92. In a 1982 interview about their achievements, Dr. Kathleen said, “It was a great feeling to be working together on a goal.”\n\nSources:\n\nJordan, L.

Perhaps social isolation is depressing enough without having it occupy your end table or bedroom dresser. Although our situations can be tiresome and frustrating, I think we all need a reminder that our particular type of quarantine would be envied by a population beset by several contagious and potentially fatal diseases, including tuberculosis. We have access to 24-hour entertainment and several means of communication. They spent months and years on bed rest with few diversions or distractions.\n\nIn recognition of their personal sacrifices, I am recommending books that feature tuberculosis patients and sanatoriums. The books on this list are generally available at bookstores, libraries, the publishers, or Amazon.com.\n\nFiction:\n\nQueen of Hearts: Coming of Age in a Hospital Bed by Martha Brooks is a young-adult book, but interesting enough to be read by adults, too. The author was raised in a medical family at a TB sanatorium in Manitoba and the details are accurate. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2011.\n\nBreathing Room by Marsha Hayles places 13-year-old Evvy in Minnesota’s fictional Loon Lake Sanatorium. Hayles’ father was a doctor at Mayo Clinic, and this book presents a realistic experience in a story that will satisfy adult readers, too. Square Fish, 2013.\n\nThe Air We Breathe by Andrea Barrett is set in an upstate New York sanatorium during World War I. It continues characters and relationships established in an earlier book by the author, so the intrigues take a back seat to accurate sanatorium experiences. W. W. Norton & Company, 2007\n\nEnd of Temperance Dare by Wendy Webb is a supernatural thriller set in a sanatorium on Lake Superior. It’s a satisfactory mystery read, with sanatorium details secondary to the plot. Lake Union, 2017.\n\nThe Sanatorium by Suzanne Wilson is loosely based on the experiences of her aunt at Glen Lake Sanatorium in Minnesota. It is self-published and available as an e-book.\n\nNon-fiction\n\nStronger than Death: The Story of AnnaLeana Tonelli by Rachel Pieh Jones is about one woman’s dedication to fighting TB in Africa. Part of her challenge was persuading nomadic peoples to remain in one spot and isolate. Tonelli was assisinated in 2003, one of many health care workers killed during local wars. Plough Publishing, 2019.\n\nOpen Window: The Lake Julia Sanatorium by Pat Nelson is part memoir and part history of a sanatorium at which her parents worked. Independently published, 2020.\n\nI Wanted to Live by Will Ross is an out-of-print book, but used copies can be found online. It is worth reading for its first-person narrative of having one’s life upset by TB and a sanatorium stay. Wisconsin Anti-Tuberculosis Association, 1953.\n\nInterrupted Lives: The History of Tuberculosis in Minnesota and Glen Lake Sanatorium by Mary Krugerud begins with a summary of the spread of TB in the state and the formation of a unique county system of care. The bulk of the book is about care and treatment in the state’s largest sanatorium, with many quotes and comments from interviews with former patients and employees. North Star Press, 2017\n\nThe Girl in Building C: The Story of a Teenage Tuberculosis Patient is a collection of letters written by Marilyn Barnes from Ah-gwah-ching State Sanatorium to her parents in St. Peter, MN. The letters were edited and annotated by Mary Krugerud. Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2018.\n\nYes, the last two recommended books are mine. If you want to read books about the history of tuberculosis and of current medical efforts at treatment and eradication, I recommend Spitting Blood by Helen Bynum and Catching Breath by Kathryn Lougheed. Although we might consider tuberculosis to be a historical curiosity, worldwide it is the leading cause of death from contagious disease. The existing vaccine is not effective enough to eradicate tuberculosis. The effectiveness of sanatoriums to isolate and treat patients is being considered in countries like India, which has the highest incidence of tuberculosis in the world and also one of the highest of levels of COVID-19.\n\nDr. Thomas J. Kinsella is remembered now by only a few elderly tuberculosis survivors and some retired physicians who studied under him at the University of Minnesota Medical School. During his lifetime, though, he was regarded as one of the best chest surgeons in the United States. He won praise for his exceptionally calm and caring bedside manner, as well as for his skills in medical care and diagnosis.\n\nThomas Kinsella was born in in Mower County, Minnesota, in 1895. He graduated from high school and college in Montana, returning to Minnesota to enroll at the University of Minnesota. He received his Medical Doctor degree in 1920 and followed that with a fellowship at the Mayo Clinic. Then, while serving as an assistant in surgery at Nicollet Clinic, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. In June 1922, he entered Cragmore Sanatorium in Colorado Springs. By January 1923, he had recovered enough to begin part-time work at the sanatorium as an assistant physician. Dr. Kinsella carried the memory of this experience into the relatively new field of thoracic surgery.\n\nWhen Dr. Kinsella joined the medical staff at Glen Lake Sanatorium in September 1925, the sanatorium was only nine years old. It had recently turned away from the cottage model of TB treatment and constructed a hospital with modern surgical suites. In 1928, Kinsella became the sanatorium’s lead surgeon. By 1934, he had performed 435 major chest operations and 500 phrenic nerve surgeries, as well as general surgeries. His record of 211 consecutive surgeries without an operative or post-operative fatality was heralded as unequalled in an era when fatal infections often followed an otherwise successful surgery.\n\nDr. Kinsella began lecturing at the University of Minnesota, and in 1936 he left Glen Lake to be a clinical professor in surgery at the U. He also acted as surgical consultant to the Veterans’ Administration Hospital in Minneapolis and to Ah-gwah-ching, the State Sanatorium near Walker. As if that didn’t keep him busy enough, he accepted a staff appointment at Minneapolis General Hospital and continued a consulting relationship with Glen Lake.\n\nDoctor Kinsella was recognized for several “firsts,” including the first successful pneumonectomy for carcinoma on July 20, 1937. He was the first in the state to do extrpleural pneumonolysis with paraffin and extrapleural pneumothorax for treatment of tuberculosis. Other firsts included experimental work on bilateral thoracoplasty, Graham cautery lobectomies, and pneumonectomies.\n\nHis patients put him first on their list of favorite doctors for very human reasons. He was honest with them and included them in decisions, which was unusual for the time. He believed that having more information about their condition lessened their anxiety. Teenager Marilyn Barnes had three thoracoplasties performed by Dr. Kinsella in the early 1940s, before the availability of streptomycin. Her parents initially refused to give permission for surgery that would remove ribs and permanently deform her chest. Armed with information about long-term survival, she persuaded them to change their minds. Marilyn mentioned Dr. Kinsella in her letters home after each surgery: “I’m so thankful to have such a wonderful surgeon as Kinsella.” “I’m so crazy about that man – Kinsella – he’s a great kidder and what personality!!” “I’m also thankful to have Dr. Kinsella – he’s swell.” Marilyn married, had two children and a teaching career, and is 92 years old as of this writing. In 1964, Dr. Kinsella retired from the University of Minnesota, and he closed his private office on July 1, 1965. He died on November 12, 1969 at the age of 74.\n\nInformation for this article is from “Terrace Topics” January 1934, V1,#5, p.1; from “Invited and Conquered” by J. Arthur Myers, Webb Publishing, 1949; and from the Marilyn Barnes Robertz collection at the Minnesota Historical Society.\n\nMore information about tuberculosis treatment in Minnesota can be found at http://www.mnsans.com/\n\nThe 1955 telephone directory of Glen Lake Sanatorium in Hennepin County, Minnesota can be mined for a short history lesson. The East and West Cottages had closed and were crossed out. They were used for almost 40 years as half-way housing for patients who were healed but not ready to return to work or home. Glen Lake San still had a Research Laboratory listed and a Streptomycin Nurse because it was participating in national TB drug testing, which it had done since the late 1930’s. The Glen Lake Store and the Oak Terrace Post Office were still open, although the post office was under the supervision of Hopkins by then. There was a Veterans Service Office because Glen Lake was taking overflow of Korean veterans from the Minneapolis Veterans Administration Hospital. It had done the same during World War II.\n\nDr. Frost was the medical director and administrator at this time. He had contracted tuberculosis during his medical student residency in 1927. Frost then served as the medical superintendent and only full-time physician at Buena Vista Sanatorium in Wabasha from 1928 to 1939. He served in World War II, worked at the VA Hospital, and then came to Glen Lake in 1950.\n\nSeveral others on the list were long-time employees, including some who had arrived at Glen Lake as patients and remained as employees. The stigma of tuberculosis was strong, and people sometimes had a problem finding employment in the “real world.”\n\nDoctors Shih Tsai (1947-1959) and Wen Yue (1954-1962) had come from China on fellowships and stayed in the United States when political issues in China made it unwise to return.\n\nDoctors Dorothy Hutchinson (1930-1962) and Frances King (1941-1960) were primarily assigned to female patients. Dr. King had been a missionary doctor in China and left when the world war began. Because she had cared for women in rice paddies and huts, she did not coddle her patients and some considered her to be unsympathetic. Dr. Hutchinson was an early advocate of birth control and counseled discharged female patients on family planning. This was fairly radical in the early 1930’s. The American Medical Association didn’t incorporate conception-related instruction in curriculum until 1937.\n\nSome employees still lived on campus, paying for room and board that was a bargain considering that laundry and cleaning services were included. Male employees lived across the road in the Men’s Building, near the power plant. Females lived in either the nurses’ wing or the staff wing of what was commonly called the Nurses’ Home.\n\nThe internal radio station was still operating, under the call letters WGLS. It was begun by a patient who had hijacked the sanatorium’s public address system to broadcast records in the 1920’s. The confiscation of his equipment resulted in 350 letters to the administrator. The sanatorium applied for and received a license under the call letters KNUT. Patients were trained to run the station equipment, which was located by the building’s auditorium. The system was also wired to provide bed patients with a choice of three local radio stations. Glen Lake was the first hospital in the U.S. to run a radio station of this capacity.\n\nMore information about Glen Lake Sanatorium is in my book, Interrupted Lives: The History of Tuberculosis in Minnesota and Glen Lake Sanatorium.

Rudolph’s toddler son was admitted to the sanatorium’s Children’s Building in 1939 for the first of two hospitalizations. Virgil didn’t leave from that visit until 1945, at age 9. His mother, who lived in North Minneapolis, tried to visit him every two weeks.\n\nVirgil, like many of the children at the sanatorium, had tuberculosis in his body, not his lungs. Virgil might have had a respiratory infection that was dismissed as a cold but was, in fact, TB. If, as a toddler, he swallowed anything he coughed up, the bacteria would have survived digestion in his stomach and entered the small intestine. From there, TB bacteria could have accessed the lymph system and found a vulnerable part of his body to invade.\n\n“As I got older, I wore a cast on my leg. Three years on the right leg. In fact, it started out, it was a full cast, way up to my chest to down there. That was ugly.. . I had a cast over my leg. I always had to find clothes that would go over my leg. The cast came up to my chest. They cut open for my stomach. It was terrible. It was heavy.”\n\nHe wore the cast for almost three years. Virgil had surgery on his leg in March of 1944. After he recovered, he could finally participate in some of the recreational activities.\n\n“I can recall in the summer time, they used to take us swimming. They used to go to Christmas Lake. And they used to put the children in a truck, and just with bench-type seats in there. All these children. And then we used to head for the lake. Nobody ever got hurt, but I look back and how terrible a way to transport children at that time. But, you see, there was no traffic. No concern.”\n\nVirgil kept pace with his education because of the sanatorium’s school. One time his teacher, Mrs. Grenier, asked him to visit her home nearby. “And growing up like I did, that’s the first time, outside of Glen Lake, that I saw furniture. Not hospital type of furniture, but home furniture. I’ll always remember that.” Because of the casts, one of Virgil’s legs was shorter than the other. He would always need to wear shoes with built up soles.\n\nWhen Virgil was a teenager, tuberculosis returned in the form of meningitis. He was fortunate that a cure had been recently discovered – TB meningitis in young people previously had an almost 100 percent fatality rate. He was there two-and-a-half years, but in the Main Building, not Children’s.\n\n“That second time was really a blow. Oh, it was terrible. I received the last sacraments of the church, it was so bad. I even remember the priest’s name. He was Father Fleming. The second time, I have to tell you, when I got meningitis, was really worse than the first time. I became paralyzed. Finally I came to a full recovery and could walk once more.”\n\nOne of the side effects of the early treatment with streptomycin was deafness. Virgil lost much of his ability to hear. His mother enrolled him the Michael Dowling School for Crippled Children, which was founded by a handicapped legislator who championed equal education for all.\n\nMichael Dowling had a swimming pool, dedicated by Franklin Roosevelt. Virgil said, “That was really my first taste of water. To make a long story short, I became a Y member for 55 years. If it wasn’t for the Y, I wouldn’t have met my wife. Being single, I got to talking to our lifeguard, who was also a special ed teacher at Morris Park Elementary School. She asked me if I would mind coming to the children because of my physical disability. I said, “Yes.” So then I went out to Morris Park Elementary School in Minneapolis, which is not too far from the airport and the military outlet there at the airport at that time. I was told to go to Miss Stansfield’s room, and that’s where I met my wife [Janyce].”\n\nIn 2008, the meningitis returned, somewhat in the manner of post-polio syndrome. He was misdiagnosed as having Parkinson’s until a physician realized the connection to his old tuberculosis infection. He needed surgery, but something went wrong. “Having to go from being able in the morning to stand, take my shower and do everything for myself, and then all of a sudden, boom, I’m capable of hardly doing anything. So that was a physically and psychologically big drop.”\n\nVirgil used a wheelchair and an EZ Stand chair to continue to live at home. Virgil passed away on October 25, 2016.\n\nVirgil Israelson and his wife Janyce were interviewed by Mary Krugerud on October 13, 2014, in Farmington, MN.\n\nThe Interrupted Lives series is based on interviews with, or stories about, people who spent part of their lives in tuberculosis sanatoriums. Some regarded them as “lost years.” Other said their confinement might have changed their lives for the better. Most of them are mentioned briefly in my book Interrupted Lives: A History of Tuberculosis in Minnesota and Glen Lake Sanatorium (North Star Press, 2017). This series is the rest of the story, in their own words when possible, with interview excerpts edited for length or clarity. None of the interviewee’s words have been changed.\n\nThank you for reading. Mary Krugerud\n\nPoor nutrition and long hours of work contributed to the development of active tuberculosis. Add damp, unsanitary dressing rooms and crowded train rides to those conditions, and it’s apparent why vaudeville performers often fell victim to the dreaded disease.\n\nMany simply worked until they couldn’t perform any longer, and they were left to fend for themselves wherever they last appeared. If the dancers, actors, and singers were in Minneapolis, the place they landed could be Glen Lake Sanatorium. Although there were county residency requirements, those were sometimes waived if there were empty beds available.\n\nFawn Lynn, born Florence Morse, was billed as a “stepper” in the “Paris Revue of 1922” in which her husband, Emmett Lynn, was the “principal comedy.” In the 1920s, they traveled the East Coast and Midwest, including at least one show in Manitoba, Canada. By 1929, they had their own troupe – the Emmett Lynn Players. In about 1933, Fawn was on tour with Jack Mulhall when, instead of going on to Chicago, she later recalled that she was sent “to open at Glen Lake for an ‘indefinite run’.” Indefinite turned out to be three years at the sanatorium, plus three years recovering with family in Minnesota. By the time she was well, Emmett had stopped touring and made a career change to the movie business. He appeared in many B westerns as the bumbling sidekick. Although it appears that Fawn joined him for a while in California, his 1958 death certificate notes that he was divorced. Fawn passed away in Richfield MN in 1990, at age 87.\n\nWorthy Turner was the featured star of a black jazz band led by white bandleader Henry Thompson. This allowed them to play in the south at black clubs such as Griffis’ Negro Pleasure Garden – where seats could be provided “for white spectators who wish to listen to the orchestra” – and at white venues such as the Ritz Ballroom in Oklahoma City. A tour of one-night stands through the upper Midwest in the late 1930s landed Worthy at Glen Lake. As one of only three blacks in the sanatorium, he wrote an article for the newsletter in which he described his encounters with other patients as civil, but indifferent. He thought that most of them were victims of a feeling bred into them as a complex. He asked readers if they believed in democracy for all races, excluding the Negro. Turner returned to his home state of Texas and died there in 1993.\n\nGilbert Reichert, who claimed to be 8’4” for his sideshow appearances, was officially measured at 7’ 6”. He was on tour with an unnamed circus when he became ill and was brought to Glen Lake in 1938. Two beds were cut and welded together to accommodate his size. He stayed only about a month, riding on double cots in a train’s baggage car in order to return to his home in Cleveland to recover there. He died in 1961 at age 49.\n\nIrving Sandler was a tap dancer on the vaudeville circuit in the early 1930s. While at Glen Lake from 1936 to 1939, he used his connections to persuade entertainers passing through Minnesota to stop in the sanatorium’s auditorium. One was Lawrence Welk, who was playing at the Orpheum with his orchestra. Sandler stayed involved in the entertainment business, advertising Sandler Distributing in 1960s Billboard magazines.\n\nFor more information about TB and vaudeville, read this Atlantic article about the Will Rogers Memorial Hospital in “The Tuberculosis Hospital that Treated America’s Vaudeville Stars” https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/05/vaudeville-tuberculosis/526875/\n\nThe Interrupted Lives series is based on interviews with, or stories about, people who spent part of their lives in tuberculosis sanatoriums.
