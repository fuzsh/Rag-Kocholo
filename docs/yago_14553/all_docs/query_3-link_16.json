These women, including many with Yale connections, are just a few of those who have made significant contributions to medicine.\n\nAncient Greece\n\nMetrodora writes On the Diseases and Cures of Women\n\nMetrodora (c. 200–400 CE), a female Greek physician, wrote the oldest medical text known to have been penned by a woman. Among many other innovations, she pioneered surgical treatments for breast and uterine cancers.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\n12th Century\n\nThe first woman gynecologist\n\nAlthough an early collection of treatises called the Trotula was mistakenly attributed for centuries to a woman by that name, medieval Europe did produce a learned woman considered an expert in medical diagnosis and treatment: Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179), a German Benedictine abbess who wrote two volumes on medicine titled Causae et Curae.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\n16th Century\n\nThe birth of nurse-midwifery\n\nLouyse Bourgeois (1563–1636) paved the way for the modern profession of nurse–midwifery as royal midwife to King Henry IV of France and his wife Marie de Médicis. She delivered the babies of the French aristocracy and made important contributions to obstetrics through her writings.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\n1820\n\nFlorence Nightingale is born\n\nNightingale (1820–1910) fundamentally changed the role of nursing in hospitals and introduced standards of hygiene that reduced hospital infections.

Steitz discovers snRNPs and their role in gene splicing\n\nA professor of molecular biophysics and biochemistry at Yale, Steitz (1941–) was the first woman graduate student in the lab of James Watson, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, before she began her own pioneering work in RNA.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\n1984\n\nFirst woman named head of a department at Yale School of Medicine\n\nCarolyn W.
