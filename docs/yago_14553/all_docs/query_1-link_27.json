        "text": "Skip to content\n\nTwo hundred years ago, a child was born into chattel slavery. She grew up to become a liberator. Abolitionist. Diviner. Healer. Nurse. Naturalist. Freedom fighter. Military raid leader. Spy. Scout. Suffragist. Daughter. Sister. Wife. Mother. Aunt. Friend. National Icon. This is the legacy of Harriet Tubman (1822–1913), born Araminta Ross, called Minty in her youth, and heralded as Moses in her extraordinary adult years of emancipatory action.\n\nThe Harriet Tubman Bicentennial Project is an online initiative from Ms. honoring the bicentennial anniversary of the birth of Harriet Tubman, launched on Feb. 1 and culminating on March 10, 2022, with a commemorative section in the Spring 2022 print issue. The project sheds light on the history and legacy of this groundbreaking feminist icon through a history timeline; an essay series by scholars in diverse fields; conversations with Tubman descendants, creatives and experts; a slavery reparations calculator; and original art and poetry, to which the public is invited to send submissions.\n\nRead More\n\nwww.nettricegaskins.com\n\nHarriet Tubman is Born\n\nHarriet Tubman is born sometime in late February or early March and is named Araminta Ross, the fifth out of nine children born enslaved to Harriet “Rit” Green (ca 1785-1880) and Benjamin “Ben” Ross (ca. 1780-1871), both enslaved, in Dorchester County, Maryland. Also this year: On April 25, Monrovia, capital of Liberia, is founded by the American Colonization Society for the repatriation of U.S.-born and formerly enslaved African Americans. On July 2, Denmark Vesey (1767-1822) is hanged with 34 other men for plotting a slave insurrection in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nMinty’s Early Childhood\n\nAraminta is nicknamed “Minty” as a child. Around this time (1824-1826), Minty, her mother, and siblings are separated from her father Ben and moved ten miles away to Bucktown to live with a different enslaver, Edward Brodess (1801-1849). Also this year: After seizing control of all of Hispaniola, Haitian President Jean-Pierre Boyer (1776-1850) invites African Americans to emigrate to Haiti, the first nation in the world to permanently abolish slavery after it had won its independence in 1804 after warring with France. Thousands depart in 1824 and continue through 1826.\n\nMinty’s Sister is Sold\n\nMinty’s fourteen-year-old sister, Mariah Ritty (aka Rhody), is sold by Brodess to a Mississippi slave trader. The family never sees her again. Also this year: Haitian President Boyer agrees to pay France 150 million francs in slavery reparations – including for every enslaved person lost during the Haitian war for independence – in exchange for international recognition of the country’s sovereignty and to avoid another war. This debt will devastate Haiti economically before it is paid off over one hundred years later.\n\nTwo Founding Fathers Die on July 4\n\nOn July 4, the second and third U.S. presidents, John Adams (1735-1826) and Thomas Jefferson (1843-1826), die within hours of each other, both men’s legacies secured as “founding fathers” of the nation. Jefferson’s legacy is further secured as author of the Declaration of Independence and the biological ancestor of both white and Black descendants, having children respectively with his wife Martha Jefferson (1748-1782) and his wife’s enslaved half-sister Sally Hemings (1773-1835), the latter who was one of over 600 bondspeople owned by Jefferson.\n\nMinty is Leased Out\n\nFrom 1827 to 1831 and after, Minty is frequently leased by Brodess to different neighboring farmers, who subject her to physical abuse while she works domestic, childcare, and farm duties, in addition to trapping muskrats. She frequently falls sick due to neglect, and she deeply misses her mother and siblings.\n\nDavid Walker Makes His Appeal\n\nFree Black abolitionist David Walker (1796-1830) publishes the pamphlet, An Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World, which calls for the enslaved to rebel against their enslavers.\n\nIndian Removal Act\n\nOn May 28, President Andrew Jackson (1767-1845) signs the Indian Removal Act into law as the nation expands its borders and subsequently turns indigenous lands in the southeast into slave plantations. The “Trail of Tears” begins when the Cherokee are forced to give up their Georgia homeland and are marched westward at gunpoint toward Oklahoma territory. Thousands die. Some Cherokees bring with them the enslaved African Americans that they own.\n\nA Year of Liberators\n\n– On January 1, white abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879) launches the newspaper The Liberator (running from 1831-1865). – In February, Mary Prince (1788-after1833) from Bermuda becomes the first Black woman to publish a slave narrative. – On August 21, an enslaved uprising in Southampton, Virginia, led by Nat Turner (1800-1831), leads to multiple deaths of enslavers and a subsequent crackdown on enslaved communities, including new restrictive slave laws. Turner is executed for his part in the insurrection.\n\nThe Night of Meteor Showers\n\nOn the night of November 12, the Leonid meteor shower, which frightens Minty, is visible throughout the Western hemisphere. Minty witnesses it with one of her brothers when sneaking out in the night to visit her mother Rit, who had been leased by Brodess to Mills plantation. The meteor storm terrifies almost everyone who sees it, believing it signaled the “end of the world.” The event intensifies the Second Great Religious Awakening that swept the country during this era and increases the scientific interest in astronomy.\n\nBritish Abolition of Slavery\n\nOn August 1, the United Kingdom abolishes slavery in the British colonies, including Canada.\n\nMinty is Severely Injured\n\nIn her early adolescence (sometime between 1834 and 1836), Minty suffers a life-threatening injury while on an errand to a neighborhood store when an overseer misses his target, subsequently striking her in the head with a two-pound weight. This near-fatal injury leads to lifelong debilitating seizures that Minty believes give her messages from God, beliefs influenced by the Second Great Religious Awakening that flourishes with Black women religious leaders: Sojourner Truth (1797-1883), Rebecca Cox Jackson (1795-1871), Zilpha Elaw (ca.1790-1873), and Jarena Lee (1783-1864).\n\nWomen Write Their Political and Religious Views\n\n– Angelina Grimke Weld (1805-1879) rebels against her white slaveholding family in South Carolina when she writes the pamphlet, An Appeal to the Christian Women of the South, urging Southern women to oppose slavery. She and her sister Sarah Grimke (1792-1873) join the Quakers and the abolitionist movement, but like Maria W. Stewart (1803-1879) who was the first American-born woman and Black woman speaking in public, they are criticized for speaking publicly as women. – Jarena Lee becomes the first African American woman to publish a book-length autobiography.\n\nMinty Heals\n\nFrom 1837-1840, Minty recovers from her head injury and regains her strength. Brodess leases her to a slaveholder in Madison, near where her father is living and working. She works as a domestic, a field hand, and a dock worker. On the wharves, she meets and learns valuable information from Black seamen and dock workers who tell her about the Underground Railroad. Her father teaches her survival skills to live off the land and navigate the region’s forest, fields, and waterways without being noticed. Minty, her mother, and brothers live and work with Ben during this time.\n\nAbolitionism Intensifies at the Dawn of the Victorian Age\n\n– Frederick Douglass (1818-1895), born Frederick Bailey, escapes from slavery in Baltimore with help from his free wife, Anna Murray (1813-1882). They settle in New Bedford, Massachusetts, a haven for freedom seekers and a hotbed of anti-slavery activism. He changes his name in freedom and becomes friends with William Lloyd Garrison. – Anti-slavery societies flourish across cities in the North. – On June 28, the coronation of Queen Victoria (1819-1901) ushers in the Victorian Era. She will rule the United Kingdom and its empire for 64 years.\n\nAmistad Slave Ship Rebellion\n\nJoseph Cinque, or Sengbe Pieh (ca.1814-1879) of the Mende people, leads an insurrection on the Spanish slave ship Amistad en route to Cuba. The ship is later brought into custody by the United States, and Cinque and his fellow surviving Africans are tried for mutiny and murder of the ship’s crew. They are eventually acquitted for defending themselves against slavery on board an illegal slave ship in The United States v. Amistad Supreme Court decision. Americans raise funds to help them return to Sierra Leone.\n\nMinty’s Father is Freed\n\n– Tubman’s father Ben is manumitted and given ten acres of land around his house. – In June, the World Anti-Slavery Convention takes place in London. Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902) and Lucretia Mott (1793-1880) attend, but as women, they are forbidden to speak publicly.\n\nTwo More Sisters of Minty Are Sold\n\nDuring this time (1841-1843), Minty’s sisters, Linah (ca. 1808-unk.) and Soph (ca. 1813-unk.), are sold by Brodess to the Deep South. He keeps their small children, whom he tries to later sell. Minty and her family are devasted. Brodess tries to sell Minty’s youngest brother Moses (ca. 1832-unk.), but Rit threatens to kill Brodess, so he backs down, and Moses is saved.\n\nMinty Marries and Becomes Harriet Tubman\n\nMinty marries a free man, John Tubman (1818-1867), and changes her name after marriage to her mother’s name, Harriet. She has already negotiated a contract with her enslaver, giving him money to hire herself out to other slaveholders for wages so that she can earn enough money to pay him and buy her freedom. Also this year: Physician J. Marion Sims (1813-1883), inventor of the speculum, begins his medical experiments on the enslaved women Anarcha, Betsy, and Lucy in Alabama, which last approximately four or five years.\n\nFrederick Douglass’s Narrative\n\nFrederick Douglass publishes Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, which details his life under slavery before he escapes to freedom.\n\nMexican-American War Begins\n\nThe United States declares war on Mexico over disputed territories.\n\nHarriet Tubman’s Legal Battle for Freedom\n\n– Tubman discovers that her mother should have been set free in 1830 as part of the terms of an old will. She hires a lawyer to investigate, sparking a ten-year lawsuit amongst the heirs named in the will. These legal documents detail the history of the Ross family. Also this year: – On July 26, the American colony Liberia becomes an independent nation. – In December, Douglass starts his abolitionist newspaper The North Star in Rochester, New York, which runs until 1851.\n\nFrench Abolition and Women’s Rights\n\n– On April 27, France abolishes slavery in its colonies. – After two years of the Mexican-American War, the United States expands its territories in the southwest. – The first women’s rights convention in the United States is held from July 19-20 at Seneca Falls, New York. Stanton and Mott are among the organizers for the event, as they had both resolved to address women’s rights when they were excluded from the World Anti-Slavery Convention.\n\nHarriet Tubman Escapes from Slavery\n\nHarriet Tubman attempts escape from slavery twice when Brodess dies, and his widow threatens to sell her to settle debts. She and two brothers, Ben and Henry, who set off on September 17, are featured in a runaway ad seeking $300 for their recapture.

The London Astronomical Society (which some years later would receive a royal charter and become the Royal Astronomical Society) began its publication.\n\nIn 1835 Araminta is 13 years old, and she learns much about trees from her father. When she accidentally gets in the way (in some reports of this story, Araminta directly intervenes in the abuse of another enslaved young person), an overseer opens her skull with a blunt object. She will live and lead with temporal lobe epilepsy for her entire life. In 1835 she may have seen Halley’s comet for the first time. Two years ago, she had already witnessed the Leonid meteor showers. Her destiny is already aligned with the stars.\n\nIn 1844 Araminta gains the lasting name Tubman. Her marriage to John Tubman is not as lasting.\n\nIn 1849 Araminta learns of an attempt to sell her, she escapes alone.\n\nOver the next decade Harriet Tubman leads around 70 enslaved people to freedom, the reward for her capture when she first escaped priced at $100. Later, an anti-slavery activist who petitioned for Tubman to get paid for her services during the Civil War, claimed that a bounty on her head was once worth $40,000 (the equivalent of millions of dollars in our own day). While this amount is not based in fact, we are reminded of the monetary value placed on enslaved people and their attempts at escape. The rigors of the Fugitive Slave Act and the price on her head conscript all the energy capitalism into seeking her capture. All the energy of capitalism fails.\n\nIn June 1863 Harriet Tubman plans and executes the Combahee River Uprising. With the help of 8 scouts and a Union Army former participant in John Brown’s raid on Harper’s Ferry, about 800 people enslaved on rice plantations run into the river to their freedom. Tubman sings to guide them to the boats. 35 plantation buildings burn to the ground.\n\nAfter the Civil War the US Army stalls decades on Tubman’s pension for her time as a crucial scout and the architect of Combahee Uprising, a pivotal battle in the war. Many years later they only give her a widow’s pension because her second husband was also a veteran. And when she finally received a pension in her own right, it was for her work as a nurse, not as a spy or scout. After the war she goes to the home she built for her family members in Auburn, NY.\n\nIn 1896 Harriet Tubman attends the founding meeting of the National Association of Colored Women, along with Ida B. Wells, Mary Church Terrell and others. The organization still exists today.\n\nIn 1910 Halley’s Comet comes back around.\n\nIn 1913 Harriet Tubman passes away surrounded by loved ones, cared for in the home for the aged and chronically ill that she created in Auburn NY for her family and community, a disabled visionary held by the vision of care she created through love. Out of this world.\n\nIn 1922 Carter G. Woodson includes a woodcut of Harriet Tubman leaning on a rifle in The Negro in Our History, considered by many to be a founding text of the field of Black History.\n\nI wrote this poem in 2022 to honor Harriet Tubman’s cosmic bicentennial.\n\nDark Energy for Harriet Tubman Read by Alexis Pauline Grumbs\n\nIn the dead of night\n\nNorth Star, rivers, mossy trees\n\nHushed sounds, secrets, run\n\nLaura Pantoja\n\nDreams of God,\n\nWoman of Freedom,\n\nGuide for All\n\nIsabella Calisi-Wagner\n\nOne step at a time\n\nYou liberated thousands\n\nYou are our hero\n\nLaura Pantoja\n\nMoses of her people\n\nQueen of underground railway\n\nborn enslaved, freed all\n\nMegha Sood\n\nFollowed your path home\n\nRescuer, freedom fighter\n\nLiving legacy\n\nLaura Pantoja\n\nMoses was her name\n\nShe guided most brave souls to\n\nBritish Canada\n\nRochelle Bush\n\nHarriet Tubman\n\nstill guides us in darkest night\n\ntoward freedom’s light\n\nBree Michele\n\nprayed for your heart\n\nbefore I prayed you dead\n\nGod heard the second\n\nShalewa Mackall\n\nA star leading to\n\nfreedom, shining through the dark,\n\nbrilliance from within\n\nChristina Fasse\n\nHarriet Tubman,\n\nyour torch stays lit through tunnels,\n\ngroves of railroad-trees\n\nStephen Mead\n\nShe planted gardens—\n\nliteral, figurative—\n\nfreedom flourishing…\n\nSharan Strange\n\nConsistent courage\n\nWoman leader helper friend\n\nCherish forever\n\nKatie MacIntyre\n\nfreedom dream giving\n\nof a timeless Black woman\n\nlife and legacy\n\nT'Sey-Haye M.

Originally written to celebrate nature and the seasons, haiku poems have since expanded to other subjects.\n\nHarriet Tubman, a lover of nature who ushered so many to freedom, relied on her skilled knowledge of forests and waterways to rescue freedom seekers on their way to the north. For Tubman’s bicentennial, we invite you to submit an original haiku in honor of her legacy.\n\nSubmissions will be moderated for appropriate language and proper formatting.\n\nYour Haiku*\n\nYour Name\n\nEmail\n\nCAPTCHA\n\nΔ\n\nWhat Do We Owe Harriet Tubman?\n\nHarriet Tubman struggled with money throughout her life. She fought tirelessly for financial compensation for her services during the U.S. Civil War as a nurse, scout, spy, and military-raid leader (the first woman in U.S. history to lead a military raid). Despite the refusal of the U.S. government to grant Tubman a veteran’s pension, Tubman and her allies never stopped pursuing this goal. In 1899, she was finally given this pension, which was adjusted to $20 a month.\n\nBased on the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, 2016, Office for National Statistics, we created a similar calculator and invite you to formulate just a snapshot of what Tubman is owed, based on just some of the unpaid enslaved labor she performed before she escaped from slavery in 1849 at the age of 27.\n\nHarriet Tubman’s Labor During Slavery\n\nHours/day\n\nWorking “Sunup ’til sundown” (est. 12 hours/day)\n\nWages/day\n\nEstimated wages\n\nest. $1.00/day\n\nest. $1.08/day\n\nest. $1.20/day\n\nest. $0.80/day\n\nest. $0.80/day\n\nest. $1.00/day\n\n1842 weekly wages\n\n1842 annual salary\n\n21-year total\n\n21-year total at today’s dollar value\n\n21-year total with interest since 1827\n\nest. 6 days/week with Sundays off\n\nest. years Tubman worked while enslaved\n\n$1 in 1842 is equivalent in purchasing power to about $33.73 today.\n\nThese are general estimates of the wages paid during the nineteenth century for each type of work.
