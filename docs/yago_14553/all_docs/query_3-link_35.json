Clerk, Wise County Circuit Court (ORDER) 08/15/2024 A mandamus petition by an inmate is dismissed in part and granted in part. The writ does not lie against a circuit court clerk because petitioners money orders were insufficient to pay the filing fees and the clerk had no duty to file his pleading, see Code § 17.1-275(A)(13). In his second claim, petitioner alleges he mailed to the General District Court a motion for judgment seeking money damages and an affidavit in forma pauperis affirming eligibility for IFP status, attaching an inmate trust account statement for a two-month period. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, the clerk had a ministerial duty to file his pleading, without passing judgment on their validity, under Code § 16.1-86. While Code § 8.01-691 requires a prisoner seeking IFP status to provide the court with a certified copy of his inmate trust account for the preceding 12 months, it does not require submission of the account statement at the time of filing or otherwise provide that tendered action will not be filed without the trust account statement. Accordingly, the clerk had a ministerial duty to file petitioners motion for judgment when tendered. Petitioner shall return his motion for judgment and IFP application to the court (if they were returned to him), and a writ of mandamus is issued directing the clerk to receive and immediately file the action. The Clerk of this Court shall certify copies of this order which shall have the same force and effect as if a writ of mandamus were formally issued and served.\n\n230333 Eckard v. Commonwealth 08/01/2024 In an appeal from the Court of Appeals affirmance of a conviction on 12 counts of possession of child pornography in violation of Code § 18.2-374.1:1(A)-(B), review is limited to the issue whether the circuit court erred by denying the defendants motion to set aside the jury verdict for alleged juror misconduct. In this case, the inadequacy of the appellate record, coupled with defendants unsubstantiated arguments in the trial court and on appeal, fully support the opinion of the Court of Appeals that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to set aside the verdict without an evidentiary hearing. Here, reasonable jurists could agree to disagree on whether the motion and exhibits warranted an evidentiary hearing  a trial court could with great care and caution exercise its sound discretion to hold (or not hold) such a hearing in this case. The judgment is affirmed.\n\n230599 Durham v. Commonwealth 08/01/2024 In a criminal appeal raising search and seizure as well as sufficiency of the evidence issues, the searching officer had an objectively reasonable belief that defendant had been sipping alcohol from a cup in his car, coupled with the odor of alcohol and a bottle of liquor observed in a rear footwell, giving the officer probable cause to search the vehicle for further evidence of drinking while driving or even driving under the influence of alcohol. Once inside the passenger compartment, the officer could search every part of the vehicle that might conceal the objects of his search. This allowed him access to the center console, as he reasonably thought that it could contain small, single-serving bottles of alcohol that he referred to as miniatures. It was when the officer pushed the button unlatching the console that he encountered a revolver. Overall, these facts, when taken in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, create a picture consonant with the requirements of probable cause and without offense to the Fourth Amendment. The Court of Appeals determination on the motion to suppress was correct, and its sufficiency of the evidence ruling upholding convictions for possession of a firearm by a nonviolent felon under Code § 18.2-308.2 and unlawfully carrying a concealed firearm under Code § 18.2-308 are also affirmed.\n\n220807 Gaskins v. Clarke (ORDER) 07/25/2024 Upon consideration of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, petitioners argument that Code § 53.1-187 requires his Virginia sentence be credited for time spent incarcerated in Maryland is without merit; he has not demonstrated being housed in a state or local correctional facility as defined by Code § 53.1-1 while confined there and has not established entitlement to credit toward his Virginia sentence for that confinement. The further argument that the Due Process Clause requires his Virginia sentence be credited for time he spent incarcerated in Maryland is also without merit. Although Virginia obtained primary jurisdiction over petitioner when it arrested and later convicted him on a charge in Fairfax County, it relinquished that primary jurisdiction when it released him on bail pending appeal. Maryland then obtained primary jurisdiction when it arrested petitioner on the Prince Georges charges. Only after the charges were dismissed did Maryland relinquish that authority. Consistent with these changes in authority, he has received credit for the time spent incarcerated in Maryland after charges were dismissed. Due Process does not require granting credit toward his Virginia sentence for time spent incarcerated on charges subject to Maryland authority. His argument that failure to award the sentence credit would violate the Fifth Amendments prohibition on double jeopardy is not properly before this Court as it was not raised in the initial petition and petitioner has not sought nor been granted leave to amend to include this claim. The petition is dismissed.\n\n240105 White v. Dotson (ORDER) 07/18/2024 Upon consideration of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed February 9, 2024, a rule to show cause, respondents motion to dismiss, and petitioners reply, the Court is of the opinion that the motion should be granted and that the petition should be dismissed. Petitioners challenge to the failure of the Virginia Department of Corrections to use a particular arrest date as the starting point for his accrual of Earned Sentence Credit is rejected. The plain language of Code § 53.1-202.2(A) shows that petitioners eligibility to earn such credit under Code § 53.1-202.3(B) did not begin upon his arrest, but upon his sentencing to serve a term of incarceration for a qualifying felony and his incarceration following a final order of the committing court. He has no statutory or constitutional right to receive sentencing credit for his good behavior while incarcerated. His due process argument fails because he has not established a deprivation of a legitimate, protected interest in his life, liberty, or property, and his equal protection claim is rejected because he has not alleged facts demonstrating treatment different from others similarly situated as a result of intentional or purposeful discrimination. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed, and the rule is discharged.\n\n230521 Page v. Portsmouth Redevelopment & Housing Authority 07/03/2024 The circuit court and the Court of Appeals of Virginia erred in concluding that the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars a claim by a property owner against the Portsmouth Redevelopment and Housing Authority (PRHA), on the grounds that it had negligently damaged a building that he owned when demolishing its own structure. It is here held that sovereign immunity does not shield PRHA from tort liability under the circumstances of this case. In sum, the Court of Appeals erred in applying the approbate-reprobate doctrine to limit plaintiffs argument on appeal and in affirming the circuit courts holding that sovereign immunity barred his negligence claim against PRHA. The judgment is reversed, and this case is remanded to the Court of Appeals with instructions to further remand the case to the circuit court for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n240352 School Board of Stafford County v. Sumner Falls Run, LLC (ORDER) 07/03/2024 In a suit against a county school board and the Virginia Department of Transportation, on interlocutory appeal under Code § 8.01-670.2, the judgment is reversed. The Declaratory Judgment Act itself does not expressly waive sovereign immunity and this Court has never held that it waives such immunity. Sovereign immunity can bar a declaratory action against the Commonwealth unless the General Assembly has made its intent clear that immunity is waived. The judgment below to the contrary is reversed. Sovereign immunity does not bar a declaratory action based on a self-executing provision of the Constitution of Virginia, but only if the case presents a justiciable controversy  involving specific adverse claims based on present, not future or speculative, facts ripe for judicial assessment. The Act does not give courts authority to render advisory opinions, decide moot or speculative questions. The declaratory judgment sought here does not implicate a self-executing provision of the Constitution, thus the circuit court should grant VDOTs plea of sovereign immunity. It is not alleged here that defendants are on the cusp of damaging property under Article I, § 11, and no taking has yet occurred. Thus, the action is premature on the takings claim. Plaintiff claims that the School Board plans to take more property than necessary, but it is not clear on the record whether this aspect of the action is premature or justiciable. This case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order and longstanding principles of justiciability for declaratory judgment actions. Combined case with Record No. 240353\n\n240353 Virginia Department of Transportation v. Sumner Falls Run, LLC (ORDER) 07/03/2024 In a suit against a county school board and the Virginia Department of Transportation, on interlocutory appeal under Code § 8.01-670.2, the judgment is reversed. The Declaratory Judgment Act itself does not expressly waive sovereign immunity and this Court has never held that it waives such immunity. Sovereign immunity can bar a declaratory action against the Commonwealth unless the General Assembly has made its intent clear that immunity is waived. The judgment below to the contrary is reversed. Sovereign immunity does not bar a declaratory action based on a self-executing provision of the Constitution of Virginia, but only if the case presents a justiciable controversy  involving specific adverse claims based on present, not future or speculative, facts ripe for judicial assessment. The Act does not give courts authority to render advisory opinions, decide moot or speculative questions. The declaratory judgment sought here does not implicate a self-executing provision of the Constitution, thus the circuit court should grant VDOTs plea of sovereign immunity. It is not alleged here that defendants are on the cusp of damaging property under Article I, § 11, and no taking has yet occurred. Thus, the action is premature on the takings claim. Plaintiff claims that the School Board plans to take more property than necessary, but it is not clear on the record whether this aspect of the action is premature or justiciable. This case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order and longstanding principles of justiciability for declaratory judgment actions. Combined case with Record No. 240352\n\n230410 Powell v. Knoepfler-Powell 06/27/2024 In an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming a circuit court judgment denying a motion to modify the custody arrangement between divorced spouses, the trial court erred by relying on the uncorroborated portions of a childs notes in determining whether it was in the childs best interests to modify the custody arrangement. Accordingly, the portion of the Court of Appeals decision that affirmed the judgment of the trial court is reversed and this matter is remanded with instructions to remand the case to the trial court for reconsideration, in light of the present decision. Additionally, as noted in the Court of Appeals opinion, the trial court should also address the clerical errors in the child custody and support order regarding the ex-wifes residential address and ex-husbands work telephone number.\n\n230327 Bland-Henderson v. Commonwealth 06/20/2024 In the appeal of a criminal case, the Court of Appeals did not err in applying Code § 19.2-295 by affirming the circuit courts denial of an untimely request for jury sentencing, because the defendant had waived his right to jury sentencing by missing the statutory deadline to request it. However, there is no presumption that shall commands directed at private litigants are mandatory. Regarding voir dire, the Court of Appeals did not err under the provisions of Code § 19.2-262.01 in affirming the circuit courts decision to prohibit the defendant from questioning the jury panel about the mandatory minimum sentence, because voir dire on sentencing ranges is irrelevant to a jurors fitness to serve, when the jury will not be sentencing the defendant. The judgment is affirmed.\n\n230491 Board of Supervisors v. Leach-Lewis 06/20/2024 In an appeal involving a county zoning ordinance provision, the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Virginia holding that a county Board of Zoning Appeals was required to consider whether search of a residence, conducted by a zoning official who was investigating a zoning violation, complied with the Fourth Amendment, is reversed. The proceeding at issue, a review of a notice of violation of a zoning ordinance, was a civil proceeding, and the BZA was not required to examine the constitutionality of the search underlying the notice of violation. It is further concluded that the residences in question were being used as an office as that term is defined in the zoning ordinance. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and final judgment is entered on this appeal in favor of the county.\n\n230625 Westrick v. Dorcon Group, LLC (ORDER) 06/06/2024 There is no reversible error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals, applying a narrow interpretation of the term modify, and concluding that a paragraph a deed of subdivision did not permit adding add new restrictions to certain lots. Restrictive covenants on land are not favored and must be strictly construed, and when the terms of a restrictive covenant are clear and unambiguous, the language used will be taken in its ordinary signification, and the plain meaning will be ascribed to it. Any ambiguity in the disputed term must be strictly construed against the appellants, in a manner that avoids the imposition of additional restrictions, and appellants cannot rely on a provision that addresses a change to the deed of subdivision to justify the challenged amendment. While a restrictive covenant may include a provision establishing a mechanism by which the parties, or some number of them, may modify or terminate the restriction, here the pertinent provision of the deed of subdivision did not permit the appellants to impose the new restrictions set forth in the challenged amendment, and the lot owner never agreed to the new restrictions. Under these circumstances, the challenged amendment and the new restrictions are invalid and unenforceable. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. This order shall be published in the Virginia Reports and certified to the Court of Appeals and the Circuit Court of Loudoun County.\n\n230403 Thomas v. Commonwealth 05/30/2024 In a criminal case begun with a charge of aggravated malicious wounding of the victim with a razor-knife, desiring to dispose of the case expeditiously as an uncontested matter due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the parties agreed to a new plea agreement in early May of 2020 after their first plea agreement, reached in January of 2020, was neither accepted nor rejected by the trial court. When the trial court became aware of the second plea agreement, which had been accepted by a judge designate, the original trial court judge demanded that the first plea agreement be enforced, despite the parties having withdrawn their assent to that agreement and the original trial court judge having neither accepted nor rejected that agreement. The trial courts insistence upon and eventual implementation of a plea agreement that the parties had revoked was reversible error because parties are free to modify or renegotiate a plea agreement when a court has not yet accepted the agreement. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court. Therefore, the judgment of conviction is vacated, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. The case is remanded to the Court of Appeals with direction to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, and upon remand, the parties will be returned to the status quo ante: an indictment for aggravated malicious wounding.\n\n230260 Carter v. Wake Forest 05/09/2024 In an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeals of Virginia that the Circuit Court for the City of Martinsville lacks personal jurisdiction over Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center and Wake Forest University Health Sciences (collectively, Wake Forest), it is concluded that the defendants did not purposefully avail themselves of the privilege of conducting activities in Virginia. It is undisputed that Wake Forests contacts with Virginia were in response to telephonic or electronic communications initiated by plaintiff while she was in Virginia. Decedent did not rely on solicitations or advertisements by Wake Forest in deciding to seek treatment in North Carolina, and all of his appointments with the Wake Forest doctors occurred in North Carolina. In other words, plaintiff and her father were the sole link between Wake Forest and Virginia. This is an insufficient basis to establish personal jurisdiction over the non-resident defendants. A mere reaction or response to a message or telephone call, without more, is not purposeful availment. As the Supreme Court has stated, while a defendants contacts with the forum State may be intertwined with his transactions or interactions with the plaintiff, a defendants relationship with a plaintiff or third party, standing alone, is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction. Here, the communications between plaintiff and Wake Forest are more aptly characterized as isolated or attenuated and are insufficient to give rise to jurisdiction. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n230365 Montalla, LLC v. Commonwealth 05/09/2024 The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred portions of the plaintiffs complaint against the governmental defendants relating to construction inspection services, and that the doctrine of accord and satisfaction barred the remainder. On this appeal, no opinion is expressed upon the ultimate merits of plaintiffs contract claims, and it is simply held that sovereign immunity does not preclude a circuit court from resolving those claims. Furthermore, in concluding that the Court of Appeals, at this stage of the proceedings, erred in finding that the settlement agreement barred portions of the complaint, no opinion is expressed as to whether accord and satisfaction might act as a bar once evidence is taken, and plaintiff is no longer entitled to the benefit of all reasonable inferences being drawn in its favor. That is a question to be answered on remand. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the Court of Appeals with direction that this case be remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n230511 Commonwealth v. Garrick 05/09/2024 In an appeal from convictions for possession of heroin and possession of a firearm by a violent felon, the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of constructive possession of the narcotics and the weapon. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the judgment of the trial court convicting the defendant on both charges is reinstated.\n\n240270 Leggett v. The Sanctuary at False Cape Condo. Ass'n. (ORDER) 05/02/2024 In a dispute between condominium unit owners and their Condominium Association and Board of Directors, the circuit court abused its discretion in a March 14, 2024 order, by erroneously determining that Code § 8.01-189 precludes an award of injunctive relief in a declaratory judgment proceeding, even if the standards for injunctive relief are met. Code § 8.01-189 is explicitly limited to those suits brought merely to obtain a declaration of rights, and makes clear that pendency of such suits does not, without more, provide a basis for injunctive relief. Missing from Code § 8.01-189 is any language suggesting that injunctive relief to which a litigant otherwise would be entitled is precluded if that litigant also has filed a declaratory judgment action. Absent a clear manifestation by the General Assembly of an intention to abrogate the circuit courts ability to grant an injunction, its power to do so remains intact. As a result, if a litigant is otherwise entitled to injunctive relief, the fact that a declaratory judgment action is pending does not prevent a circuit court from awarding that relief, and it was an abuse of discretion to hold otherwise. The circuit courts order denying petitioners motion for an injunction is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the circuit court to consider the merits of petitioners request for an injunction. This order shall be published in the Virginia Reports and certified to the Circuit Court of Virginia Beach.\n\n230316 Hannah v. Commonwealth 04/18/2024 Considering the defendants appeal from a circuit court judgment reimposing the suspended portions of his sentences on one felony conviction and one misdemeanor conviction, in which he challenged the circuit courts jurisdiction to the hold a probation revocation hearing and the sufficiency of the Commonwealths evidence regarding his violation of a condition of probation prohibiting the unlawful use, possession, or distribution of controlled substances or paraphernalia, the judgment of the Court of Appeals concluding that amendments to Code § 19.2-303.1 and § 19.2-306 did not divest the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction to hear the revocation proceeding and that his arguments were procedurally defaulted by operation of Rules 5A:18 and 5A:20 is affirmed.\n\n230514 Vasquez v. Dotson 04/18/2024 Considering a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which the petitioner, who pleaded guilty in 2019 to, inter alia, an amended charge of conspiracy to commit a felony, namely, first-degree murder in violation of Code § 18.2-22, asserts that he has a right under the early-release statute, Code § 53.1-202.3, to an early release from prison; the literal text of that statute, when contextually construed using neutral principles of statutory interpretation, demonstrates that it applies to his conspiracy conviction. Petitioner was never convicted of murder in violation of Code § 18.2-32, and because the General Assembly chose not to disqualify conspiracy to commit murder from the calculation of enhanced earned-sentence credits under Code § 53.1-202.3, the petitioner is entitled to these credits and thus to early release from prison. The petition is granted, and a writ of habeas corpus is awarded and issued, ordering that the petitioner be released from custody.\n\n230379 Commonwealth v. Browne (ORDER) 04/11/2024 On an appeal from a judgment rendered by the Court of Appeals of Virginia, the Court is of the opinion that this appeal is moot. At his revocation hearing, the defendant conceded that he violated several conditions of his probation and suspended sentences. This appeal only involves a challenge to the punishment imposed as a consequence of the revocation. Since the defendant has already served the period of active incarceration imposed by the circuit court, this appeal is now moot, notwithstanding the alleged erroneous application of the pertinent provisions of Code § 19.2-306.1. His incarceration cannot be undone by the Court  he cannot be ordered to serve a lesser period of incarceration because he has already served the entire period of incarceration imposed by the circuit court. Furthermore, the circuit courts application of Code § 19.2-306.1 has not caused defendant a continuing injury. The sentencing limitations set forth in Code § 19.2-306.1 only apply to first and second technical violations, and this defendant has already committed more than two technical violations. Thus, the alleged misclassification of the violations at issue in this case can no longer affect him in subsequent revocation proceedings. The defendants suspended sentences have been revoked based on at least two prior technical violations, thus the sentencing limitations set forth in Code § 19.2-306.1 will no longer apply to him. Therefore, this Court vacates the memorandum opinion and judgment of the Court of Appeals, reinstates the judgment of the circuit court, and dismisses this case.\n\n230199 Emergency Physicians of Tidewater v. Hanger 04/04/2024 In a medical malpractice case in which plaintiff alleged that the healthcare defendants negligently failed to treat her low blood sodium  causing a seizure, resulting in a traumatic brain injury from a fall  the defendants did not waive their right to appeal the question that the fall could have been caused by other factors, and that the defendants should have been granted a proffered jury instruction supporting their theory of the case. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the Court of Appeals for entry of a mandate to the trial court consistent with the opinion herein.\n\n230343 Commonwealth v. Holman 04/04/2024 On the Commonwealths appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeals of Virginia reversing a defendants conviction for use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, the approbate and reprobate doctrine bars the defendants attempt to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on the charge of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. At trial, the defendant consistently staked out the position that he was not challenging the charge of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. Counsel stated the defendant was changing his plea to a guilty plea to the offense of unlawful wounding, and the statements of his attorney were part of a deliberate and well-crafted trial strategy designed to forestall a conviction for the charge of aggravated malicious wounding. Having approbated to the charge of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, the defendant now seeks to reprobate by challenging the sufficiency of the evidence for that charge. The approbate and reprobate doctrine forecloses precisely this kind of conduct. Moreover, under settled law, the approbate and reprobate doctrine precludes resort to the ends of justice exception. Therefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and final judgment is entered on this appeal in favor of the Commonwealth.\n\n230248 Warren v. Commonwealth (ORDER) 03/14/2024 Upon consideration of the record, briefs, and argument of counsel, the Court is of the opinion that there is no reversible error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which held that the circuit court did not err in striking a prospective juror for cause per Va. Code Ann. § 8.01-338, or in excluding evidence pertaining to defendant's proposed necessity defense based on relevance and requiring a defendant to proffer evidence on each element of the necessity defense at the motion in limine. Accordingly, the Court affirms the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the reasons stated in Warren v. Commonwealth, 76 Va. App. 788 (2023).\n\n230323 United Services Automobile Association v. Estep (ORDER) 03/14/2024 Upon consideration of the record, briefs, and argument of counsel, the Court is of the opinion that there is no reversible error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals, holding that there was a tangible nexus between an accident and the insureds use of a vehicle as a vehicle, as loading the trunk compartment was a legitimate and expected use of it. Accordingly, the Court affirms the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the reasons stated in United Services Auto. Assn v. Estep, 77 Va. App. 16 (2023).\n\n220382 Commonwealth v. Smith 02/29/2024 In an appeal from convictions for statutory rape and object sexual penetration of a child under the age of thirteen, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in the manner in which it addressed the defendants multiple requests for expert assistance and, accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals on those issues is reversed. The Court of Appeals refusal to dismiss the indictment on the basis of inadvertently recorded video conferences between defendant and his counsel is affirmed, because the record establishes that defendant suffered no prejudice. Finally, it is concluded that the defendants mandatory life sentence for the rape of a young child does not infringe the prohibition on cruel or unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. The judgment is reversed in part and affirmed in part. Final judgment is entered on this appeal.\n\n230115 McCants v. CD & PB Enterprises, LLC 02/15/2024 In an action for conversion of a collectible automobile, the judgment of the Court of Appeals reversing a jury verdict for the owner against a vehicle repair shop, and one of its part-owners, is reversed, and the jury verdict is reinstated.\n\n220445 Sample v. Commonwealth 02/08/2024 In an appeal from a conviction for the crime of attempted robbery, in which the defendant assigns error to the trial courts denial of his motion to suppress an out-of-court identification and subsequent in-court identification, and to the denial of a motion to strike the evidence as insufficient, the conviction is affirmed after considering whether a single-photo showup in which the victim identified the defendant was impermissibly suggestive and, even if it were, whether it was nonetheless constitutionally reliable and thus admissible under the totality of the circumstances. It is determined that the evidence presented was sufficient to convict this defendant of attempted robbery. The judgment of the Court of Appeals, affirming the decision of the trial court, is affirmed.\n\n230344 Fary v. Commonwealth (ORDER) 01/18/2024 Upon consideration of the record, briefs, and argument of counsel, the Court is of the opinion that there is no reversible error in the judgment below. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed for the reasons stated by the en banc majority in Fary v. Commonwealth, 77 Va. App. 331 (2023) (en banc).\n\n211061 Vlaming v. West Point School Board 12/14/2023 In its dismissal of a discharged teachers complaint against a school board, a high school principal, an assistant principal, and the superintendent (collectively, the School Board), alleging constitutional, statutory, and breach-of-contract claims, the circuit court erred in finding that these counts failed to state legally viable causes of action. The judgment is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings.\n\n211114 Schmuhl v. Clarke 12/14/2023 In this appeal from denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which it was claimed that trial counsel were ineffective due to an alleged misunderstanding of the law regarding the admissibility of mental state evidence which resulted in petitioners inability to present crucial expert testimony regarding his sanity at the time that he committed his crimes, it is apparent that, taken as a whole, trial counsels actions in this case amounted to an unsuccessful attempt to extend the existing law to their clients benefit. The record clearly establishes that trial counsel made a thorough investigation of the law and facts and chose a course of action that they believed had the best chance of success. This is precisely the type of representation that is expected from competent attorneys. Accordingly, it cannot be said that trial counsels performance was deficient. The decision of the habeas court denying the petition for such relief is affirmed.\n\n230127 Commonwealth v. Delaune 12/14/2023 When a Commonwealths Attorney elects to apply a new, mitigating statute in a criminal proceeding, the Attorney General may not challenge that election on appeal by arguing that the statute at issue only applies prospectively. Thus, in this case, the Attorney General is bound by the Commonwealths Attorneys agreement to proceed under Code § 19.2-306.1. On the merits, subsections (A) and (C) of the statute address the range of punishment a court may impose upon the revocation of a suspended sentence and prohibit imposition of a term of active incarceration based on a first technical violation for drug use. Here, the defendants violations of the terms of her probation and suspended sentence by drug use and absconding from supervision constitute technical violations under Code § 19.2-306.1(A). Therefore, the circuit court could not impose a term of active incarceration based on this violation, under Code § 19.2-306.1(C). The defendants absconding is automatically classified as a second technical violation under Code § 19.2-306.1(A), thus the circuit court could impose a maximum of 14 days of active incarceration based on this violation, and it erred in ordering 60 days of active incarceration in this case. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n230400 Verizon Virginia LLC v. SCC 11/30/2023 In an appeal by a telecommunications company from a decision by the State Corporation Commission dismissing its petition for a declaratory judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the contention that the Commission has subject matter jurisdiction over this petition pursuant to Code §§ 33.2-1815(B) and 33.2-1821 is rejected, and the judgment of the Commission is affirmed.\n\n220596 Commonwealth v. Puckett 11/22/2023 In a case where the trial court convicted a defendant of malicious wounding and ordered him to pay restitution to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS) for a small portion of the victims medical bills that DMAS had paid on the victims behalf, the judgment of the Court of Appeals holding that the trial court had erred as a matter of law in doing so is reversed. Final judgment is entered on behalf of the Commonwealth on this appeal.\n\n210389 McKeithen v. City of Richmond 10/19/2023 In an as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of the escheat provision of Code § 58.1-3967, where a city obtained a judicial sale of a parcel of property subject to a statutory lien for delinquent taxes and the sale proceeds wholly satisfied the citys tax lien, the holding of the circuit court that the statute required it to award a portion of the surplus sale proceeds to the city rather than an unsatisfied junior lienor, while required by the text of the escheat provision, nevertheless violates Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of Virginia concerning the taking of private property. The circuit court erred in failing to so rule, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n220536 Moison v. Commonwealth (ORDER) 10/19/2023 Considering defendants appeal from his convictions on multiple counts of aggravated sexual battery by a parent under Code § 18.2-67.3 and taking indecent liberties with a child under Code § 18.2-370.1, in which he argued that the circuit court erred in determining that the proffered testimony of a witness indicating that the defendant remained outside of the witness home with her for several hours instead of accompanying his two minor daughters inside to sleep constituted inadmissible alibi testimony not timely disclosed pursuant to Rule 3A:11(d)(2), the Court of Appeals erred in addressing the merits of defendants argument where the defendants assignment of error indicated that the proffered testimony was not evidence of an alibi because it was instead offered to impeach by contradiction the testimony of his daughters, who were the victims. However, defendant never argued at trial that the proffered testimony was offered for impeachment purposes; rather, he only argued that it was not alibi evidence. As a result, defendants argument was waived. That portion of the Court of Appeals judgment is reversed, but judgment upholding the conviction is affirmed.\n\n220715 Commonwealth v. McBride 10/19/2023 In an appeal by the Commonwealth from a decision by the Court of Appeals of Virginia, it is held that Rule 3A:15 does not preclude the circuit court from reconsidering a motion to strike that was erroneously granted in a criminal case. While the Double Jeopardy Clause imposes some restrictions on a trial courts authority to reconsider a motion to strike, those limitations do not apply here. Consequently, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and final judgment is entered on this appeal in favor of the Commonwealth.\n\n230172 Anderson v. Clarke 10/12/2023 On a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, asserting that the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) failed to timely release the petitioner from prison because it undercalculated his earned sentence credits (ESCs), pursuant to amendments to Code § 53.1-202.3 adopted by the General Assembly in 2020, the judgment of the circuit court concluding that he was not entitled to immediate release is affirmed.\n\n211071 Monroe v. Monroe 07/20/2023 In a shareholder-derivative suit by the minority shareholder of a closely held Virginia corporation against his wife, the majority shareholder, in which the trial court rejected the derivative claim and imposed sanctions for pursuing it, the plaintiff had standing to appeal the sanctions award entered against him personally as the plaintiff under Code § 13.1-672.5. Because the sanctions order violated Rule 1:1, the May 12, 2021 Final Order was the final order in this case, and the order granting sanctions three months later is vacated.\n\n220665 Prease v. Clarke 07/06/2023 On a state prisoners petition for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that he was wrongfully denied earned sentence credits on his convictions for attempted aggravated murder that, if awarded, would result in his immediate release from incarceration, the petition is granted. By its plain language, Code § 53.1-202.3 establishes that all inmates are eligible for expanded earned sentence credits unless they were convicted of an offense that is enumerated under subsection A, and here the petitioner was convicted of attempted aggravated murder, which is not one of the enumerated offenses that is ineligible for expanded earned sentence credits under subsection A. Nor is attempted aggravated murder one of the other specifically enumerated offenses ineligible for expanded earned sentence credits under the statute. Thus, there is no basis in the governing statutes for denying the petitioner expanded earned sentence credits on his attempted aggravated murder convictions. The petition is granted, and a writ of habeas corpus is issued to the Director of the Virginia Department of Corrections ordering that this prisoner be released from custody.\n\n220223 Tomlin v. Commonwealth 06/29/2023 The defendant left her 80-year-old mother in a squalid condition lying on the floor of her apartment for at least two days, resulting in her mothers need for emergency medical care and hospitalization. The trial court convicted defendant of abuse or neglect of an incapacitated adult causing injury in violation of Code § 18.2-369(B). The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, as does this Court.\n\n210988 City of Hampton v. Williamson 06/08/2023 In a citys appeal from a circuit court decision to grant a petition for a writ of mandamus, requiring production of certain documents ancillary to a grievance panel hearing, having provided the grievant with its list of witnesses and a binder with the documents furnished to the grievance panel, the city has clearly met its obligation under Code §15.2-1507(A)(10)(b)(3) and, regardless of whether the city intends to use the documents in the grievance binder, as it originally suggested, or to rely solely on witness testimony, a writ of mandamus does not lie here. The circuit courts judgment is reversed, and the petition for a writ of mandamus is dismissed.\n\n220378 Walker v. Commonwealth 06/01/2023 In an appeal from a conviction for bank robbery and use of a firearm in commission of robbery, second or subsequent offense under the provisions of Code § 18.2-53.1, the convictions are affirmed. The argument that the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution requires a court to pre-screen eyewitness identification testimony before the eyewitness can be permitted to make an identification of the defendant for the first time in open court is rejected. In addition, the jury was properly instructed that the defendant was subject to the second or subsequent offense provisions of Code § 18.2-53.1 for using a firearm in the commission of robbery. The convictions are affirmed.\n\n210779 Gloss v. Wheeler 05/18/2023 In a petition for mandamus and injunctive relief brought by two residents of a county alleging a violation of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (VFOIA), the circuit court erred in granting a motion to strike by the defendant Board of Supervisors (Board) members on the theory that the gathering at issue  a meeting of the police departments Citizens Advisory Board  did not constitute a meeting under VFOIA. The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n220072 Oreze Healthcare v. Eastern Shore Community Svcs Board 05/04/2023 In a breach of contract claim relating to a lease of real property, the circuit court erred in holding that the plaintiffs conveyance of the real property to a third party prohibited it from pursuing a breach of contract claim against the defendant based upon a prior lease agreement for that property between the parties. Plaintiffs sale of the property to a third party after the lease was terminated did not transfer that claim to the third party as successor in interest simply by execution of the deed. While plaintiff could have assigned its right to the breach of contract claim to the third party, here the deed conveying the property was silent as to that claim and  absent an assignment  the deed could neither extinguish plaintiffs right to pursue the claim nor transfer the claim to the third party. For the reasons set forth in the present opinion, the circuit courts judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n\n220643 Brown v. Virginia State Bar 05/04/2023 In an appeal of right from an attorney disciplinary proceeding before a three judge panel, the circuit courts finding that this lawyer violated Rule 1.7(a)(2) by engaging in sexual relations with his divorce client during the representation is supported by the record, and the finding that he added a fault ground for divorce against his client, as well as other findings of fact with which the lawyer takes issue, are likewise supported by the record. Additionally, the Virginia State Bar, in its assignment of cross-error, merely asked for a reversal and final judgment as to the claimed Rule 2.1 violation, with the previously issued public reprimand on another proven violation extended to encompass the Rule 2.1 violation in the event of a reversal. However, an affirmative finding of a Rule 2.1 violation would require a remand and further sanctions proceeding, which was not requested. Therefore, given that the Bar did not ask for a rules-required remand in the event of a reversal, the Court does not consider the Bars assignment of cross-error. As a result, the circuit courts decision is affirmed.\n\n220116 Suffolk City School Board v. Wahlstrom 04/27/2023 In the plaintiffs action alleging that a city School Board and two school officials violated the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (VFOIA), Code § 2.2-3700 et seq., by denying her free entry to a public meeting of the Board, the trial court did not err in awarding relief to the plaintiff because the Board violated the statute, or in denying her claims against the individual defendants. The case is remanded for determination of the fees and costs she is entitled to recover since she substantially prevailed in the suit.\n\n220034 Williams v. Commonwealth 04/20/2023 The appellant pled guilty to an amended misdemeanor charge for obstruction of justice, and later filed a petition for expungement of the original felony charge of accessory-to-murder charge, which the Commonwealth did not oppose but the circuit court denied. Where a petitioner is convicted of a lesser included offense of the original charge, the original charge does not qualify for expungement. When a charge is not a lesser included offense, inquiry turns on whether it is a completely separate and unrelated charge and the petitioner may occupy the status of innocent. Determining whether an amended charge is completely separate is not a mechanical application of the test under Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932). Rather, a court should (1) compare the conceptual similarities and differences between the charges and (2) examine whether they share a common nucleus of operative facts. The burden is on a petitioner to show that the original charge, later amended, qualifies as otherwise dismissed. Here, the circuit court did not rely on a Blockburger comparison of the elements but on Code § 19.2-231, governing amendment of a charging instrument, to determine whether the amended obstruction of justice charge was completely separate from and unrelated to the original charge. Given this opinions clarification of the standard that applies to review of expungement petitions when the claim is that the original charge was otherwise dismissed, the judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded for new consideration of the petition.\n\n220185 DeLuca v. Commonwealth (ORDER) 04/13/2023 The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed for the reasons stated in DeLuca v. Commonwealth, 73 Va. App. 567 (2021), holding that because the testimony of his own counsel was never prejudicial to him, the attorneys role as both lawyer and witness was not automatically prohibited by the lawyer-witness rule, and the attorney acted at all relevant times as the defendants counsel, both nominally and in fact, thus this defendants right to counsel was not violated. Further, because the record supports the conclusions that, despite his claims at the hearing, the defendant was not mistaken about his reporting obligation when he entered certain pleas, and that the motion to withdraw was filed in bad faith, the trial court did not err in refusing to allow him to withdraw his guilty pleas.\n\n220058 Ranger v. Hyundai Motor America 04/06/2023 In an appeal from the circuit courts grant of summary judgment in a case arising under Virginias Lemon Law, Code § 59.1-207.9 et seq., to satisfy the refund requirements under the statute, a manufacturer is not required to pay pre-litigation attorneys fees. In this case, because the manufacturers refund satisfied the requirements of the Lemon Law, the trial courts grant of summary judgment is affirmed.\n\n220039 Yourko v. Yourko 03/30/2023 In an appeal from a decision in a divorce case on a husbands motion to amend the final decree, the equitable distribution order, and a Military Pension Division Order (MPDO), in which a husband contended that the parties had erred in calculation of his disposable retired pay and, as a result, the MPDO required him to pay approximately 140% of his disposable retirement pay in violation of federal law, and further sought to have the indemnification provisions in the MPDO struck as void ab initio, the Court of Appeals erred in interpreting Howell v. Howell, 581 U.S. 214 (2017) to forbid courts from recognizing indemnification provisions related to military retirement pay in property settlement agreements, and further erred by overruling Owen v. Owen, 14 Va. App. 623 (1992) and its progeny. Regarding division of military retirement benefits, federal law does not prevent a husband and wife from entering into an agreement to provide a set level of payments, the amount of which is determined by considering disability benefits as well as retirement benefits. Nor does federal law bar courts from upholding such agreements or from enforcing indemnification provisions that may be included to ensure that payments are maintained as intended by the parties. The Court of Appeals decision is reversed, and the circuit courts decision dismissing the husbands motion to amend the final decree is reinstated.\n\n211143 Berry v. Board of Supervisors 03/23/2023 In an appeal by resident taxpayers from a circuit court decision dismissing claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against a county Board of Supervisors, the Countys Continuity Ordinance did not authorize the Board to consider and adopt a revised zoning ordinance in an electronic meeting, and neither that Ordinance nor Code § 15.2-1413 conflicted with or superseded VFOIAs open meeting requirements. Nor did the General Assembly, in 2020 budget enactments, supplant VFOIAs open meeting requirements or authorize the Board to adopt the zoning modification at meetings conducted by electronic means. The circuit court erred in concluding that the Boards adoption of the revised zoning ordinance mooted the plaintiffs declaratory judgment action and in dismissing the residents complaint as premature. Neither the statute, nor the Continuity Ordinance, nor budget enactments by the General Assembly authorized the Board to consider and adopt the zoning modification in meetings conducted by electronic communication means without a quorum of the public body or any member of the governing board physically assembled at one location. Its purported adoption was void ab initio. The judgment below is reversed, and final judgment is entered on this appeal.\n\n211126 Commonwealth v. Barney 03/16/2023 In an appeal from a conviction where the defendant had handed a note to a store cashier demanding money or her life, the cashier took the threat seriously because she saw the defendant place her hand in a pocket and point what appeared to be a handgun at the cashier. A jury convicted the defendant of using a firearm during the commission of a robbery. The judgment of the Court of Appeals (vacating the jury verdict, holding that the jury instructions were flawed and that no rational jury could find that the defendant had a firearm in her pocket) is reversed, rejecting both grounds relied upon by the Court of Appeals. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, the conviction entered by the circuit court is reinstated, and final judgment is entered for the Commonwealth.\n\n220230 Horn v. Webb 02/09/2023 In litigation between neighboring parties owning land near a lake, the evidence supports the circuit courts rejection of a claimed prescriptive easement for the defendants to store small watercraft, such as canoes, on the plaintiffs land, and an award of compensatory damages for such storage is affirmed. However, the judgment is reversed in connection with the claim of a prescriptive easement to dock a boat on the plaintiffs property. Even if it is assumed that the original docking was permissive, the prior sale of the land vitiated the permission granted by the original owners. No evidence indicates that any of the subsequent owners granted any kind of permission to dock a boat on their land. Defendants established the existence of a prescriptive easement to dock a boat as well as to maintain the electrical wiring and outlet to charge the boat. Finally, award of punitive damages is reversed, because nothing in the record establishes malice on the part of the defendants in filing their own lawsuit to vindicate their property rights. Thus, the judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for entry of an order consistent with the judgment of this Court.\n\n211021 Morgan v. Board of Supervisors 02/02/2023 In an action by several homeowners seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the Board of Supervisors of Hanover County violated Virginia law when it approved rezoning and special-exception requests that authorized construction of a large distribution and warehousing facility nearby, the circuit court erred in finding that the homeowners allegations did not allege a sufficient factual basis for standing. The court also erred when it dismissed Counts VI, VII, and VIII on the alternative ground that those Counts asserted speculative claims not ripe for adjudication. No opinion is offered, however, on the merits or demerits of the various claims pleaded by the homeowners or what, if any, judicial relief should be awarded at the conclusion of this case. The appealed judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n\n211226 Colas v. Tyree 01/26/2023 In a case arising from a police detectives shooting of the decedent, testimony about the circumstances was received from the defendant detective called an adverse witness by the plaintiffs. The detective testified that, when he fired the fatal shot, he was acting in defense of another officer, because the decedent (who was experiencing acute mental distress) had been tackled by that officer, had fallen to the ground, had picked up a knife, and was holding the knife in the air in close proximity to the other officer, who was lying on the ground next to him. The plaintiffs own uncontradicted evidence established that the defendant detective was justified in firing the shot. Applying the adverse party witness doctrine, the estate is bound by this uncontradicted evidence. Accordingly, the judgment awarding the plaintiffs damages on a theory of battery is reversed and final judgment is entered for the defendant detective.\n\n210893 Forness v. Commonwealth 01/19/2023 In an appeal from denial of a petition to expunge a felony arrest record, since every driving-while-intoxicated charge implicates the same underlying offense, a violation of Code § 18.2-266, it is clear that Felony DWI and DWI Second involve the same offense but with different sentencing enhancements: the difference between the two charges is one of degree and not of kind. In the present case, amendment of the arrest warrant related only to the sentencing enhancement sought to be imposed, not the underlying offense. Given that the actual offense that petitioner was charged with remained the same, it simply cannot be said that the amendment resulted in a completely separate and unrelated charge. Accordingly, the amendment did not render the original Felony DWI charge otherwise dismissed for the purposes of Code § 19.2-392.2, and therefore, the circuit court properly dismissed the expungement petition.\n\n211032 County of Isle of Wight v. International Paper Company 12/29/2022 On remand from the decision in International Paper Co. v. County of Isle of Wight, 299 Va. 150 (2020), the circuit court held that International Paper had established by a preponderance of the evidence that the Countys tax scheme violated the requirement of uniform taxation in the Constitution of Virginia, and it ordered a full refund of the taxpayers machinery and tools tax (M&T tax) for the applicable year. The Countys appeal from this decision, contending that the circuit court erred in finding its tax scheme unconstitutional, and, in the alternative, that it erred in the relief it granted, is rejected, and the circuit courts judgment is affirmed across the board.\n\n211033 Morgan v. Commonwealth 12/29/2022 In an appeal from a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon while intoxicated in violation of Code § 18.2-308.012, the rule of lenity applies, an ancient maxim of the law that all such statutes must be construed strictly against the state and favorably to the liberty of the citizen. By enacting this statute, the General Assembly specifically targeted persons permitted to carry concealed handguns and sought to prevent them from carrying a handgun in a public place while intoxicated, it did not envision preventing the transportation of a handgun within a bag located in a vehicle. Rather, the legislature sought something more specific, intending to deter intoxicated individuals from physically carrying a concealed handgun  whether it be in their waistband, pocket, etc.  in and out of public establishments. In this case, the defendant had a valid concealed weapons permit and provided it to the officer during the traffic stop. He did not physically carry the handgun on his person, but rather, the handgun was holstered in a small, zipped backpack on the front passenger seat of his vehicle. Under these facts, this defendant did not carry the handgun as contemplated by Code § 18.2-308.012, and his conviction was in error. The conviction is reversed.\n\n211050 Arch Insurance Company v. FCVbank 12/29/2022 In a surety companys appeal from a circuit court judgment striking its conversion and unjust enrichment claims (after disallowing a forensic accounting asset-tracing expert to testify), the governing legal principle is that when a company obtains a right through subrogation, it is placed in the position of its subrogor and can have no greater rights than those of the subrogor. Both of the surety companys assignments of error stem from the circuit courts underlying legal conclusion that it was incapable of demonstrating a priority right to the disputed funds as a matter of law. Because the surety companys rights were limited to those of its subrogor, a mechanical contracting company, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.\n\n211048 Hartford Underwriters Insurance Co. v. Allstate Insurance Co. 12/08/2022 The judgment of the circuit court granting a first amended complaint in interpleader with accompanying prayer for declaratory relief filed by the plaintiff insurer, and apportioning the interpleaded funds, is affirmed.\n\n220004 GEICO Advantage Insurance Co. v. Miles 12/01/2022 In an appeal by two related insurance companies from a decision of the circuit court granting summary judgment to an insured on the issue of whether each of the two insurance policies at issue provided separate tranches of insurance for uninsured motorist (UM) coverage and underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage, the circuit court erred in its interpretation of Code § 38.2-2206 and the insurance policies. The statute and each of the applicable policies provide only a single tranche of coverage applicable to both UM and UIM claims. The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and final judgment is entered for the insurers.\n\n220130 Appalachian Voices v. State Corporation Commission 10/27/2022 In an appeal by a nonprofit environmental organization from an order of the State Corporation Commission (SCC or the Commission) that approved a petition by Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO) to obtain a rate-adjustment clause pursuant to Code § 56-585.1(A)(5)(e), the Commission did not fail to apply the proper legal standard to the utilitys request to recover projected costs of purchasing allowances through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cap-and-trade market regulating CO2 emissions by electric utilities. The judgment of the Commission is affirmed.\n\n210787 The Daily Press v. Commonwealth 10/20/2022 In consolidated appeals challenging three rulings by the circuit court relating to a pending criminal case in which a police officer was indicted for second-degree murder of a suspect during an arrest, and other offenses, three trial court holdings are reversed  barring public access to a pretrial bail hearing, keeping certain motions and exhibits under seal, and finding that the City of Newport News lacked standing to oppose any public access to sealed documents that it had previously produced in response to a subpoena. The proceedings are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Combined case with Record No. 210827\n\n210827 City of Newport News v. Commonwealth 10/20/2022 In consolidated appeals challenging three rulings by the circuit court relating to a pending criminal case in which a police officer was indicted for second-degree murder of a suspect during an arrest, and other offenses, three trial court holdings are reversed  barring public access to a pretrial bail hearing, keeping certain motions and exhibits under seal, and finding that the City of Newport News lacked standing to oppose any public access to sealed documents that it had previously produced in response to a subpoena. The proceedings are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Combined case with Record No. 210787\n\n210848 Hawkins v. Town of South Hill 10/20/2022 In an appeal from the partial denial of a mandamus petition, turning on the scope of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (VFOIA) personnel information, in which the petitioner requested documents related to employment disputes in the defendant town, as well as attorneys fees and costs, because the circuit court applied a definition of personnel information different from that outlined below, the judgment is reversed and this matter is remanded for the court to review and, if necessary, redact and release the documents at issue. Since the petitioner failed to obtain a ruling from the circuit court as to who, if anyone, was the prevailing party or the issue of attorneys fees and costs, he has waived those issues on appeal. The judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and the case is remanded.\n\n210972 Williams v. Janson 10/20/2022 In an appeal by owners of land from a circuit court order that they convey it in fee simple after an auction was held, the auction, as advertised, was an auction with reserve because the advertisement did not state that it would be an absolute auction. The owners never explicitly stated that the auction was absolute or without reserve during the pre-auction announcement; nor was any statement made that limited the ability to withdraw the property from sale, reject bids or otherwise nullify the auction. A statement that property will be sold to the high bidder is a mere declaration of intention to hold an auction at which bids will be received. Such statements are usually merely preliminary negotiation, not intended or reasonably understood to affect legal relations, and the owners statement was virtually identical to language included in the advertisement, which plaintiff conceded indicated that the auction was an auction with reserve. Accordingly, the circuit court erred in its determination that the auction was an absolute auction, and its judgment compelling conveyance of the property to the plaintiff is reversed. Final judgment is entered for the defendant owners.\n\n210800 Ashland, LLC v. Virginia-American Water Co. 10/13/2022 In an action by a corporate customer of a water supply utility for an alleged breach of contract for the supply of water, the circuit court erred in concluding that Article IX, Section 4 of the Constitution of Virginia deprived the circuit court of jurisdiction to adjudicate the contract claim. The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n210934 Cornell v. Benedict 10/13/2022 In an appeal from the granting of pleas in bar by two individuals associated with a counseling and psychotherapy service  who joined its board of directors during the last months of its operation  the judgment is affirmed. The circuit court did not err in sustaining these individuals pleas in bar because Code § 40.1-2 adopts a narrower definition of employer than the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, and thus excludes individuals from implied employer liability under Code § 40.1-29(J). The judgment is affirmed.\n\n210935 Taylor v. AIDS-Hilfe Koln e.V. 10/13/2022 The circuit court properly admitted to probate the will of a decedent who held dual citizenship in Germany and in the United States. The court also appointed an administrator for the estate and awarded the proceeds of a brokerage account to a German charity. In review of a challenge to these decisions on a number of grounds, it is concluded that the circuit court properly admitted the will to probate and appointed an administrator for the decedents estate. The decision of the circuit court granting relief on Counts II and III of the complaint is reversed and vacated, and final judgment is entered.\n\n210320 AV Automotive, LLC v. Gebreyessus 09/15/2022 In an appeal by automobile dealership entities from a circuit courts decision to impose sanctions against them under Code § 8.01-271.1, awarding all attorneys fees claimed by a terminated salesperson, the circuit court was within its discretion to award sanctions against the appellants. However, the circuit court abused its discretion in awarding sanctions for appellants failure to notify one of its employees of his expert witness designation and abused its discretion in failing to segregate the sanctionable claim from the attorneys fees requested. Accordingly, the sanctions award is reversed, and the case is remanded the circuit court for a recalculation of the attorneys fees commensurate with this opinion.\n\n210501 Fines v. Rappahannock Area Community Services Board 09/08/2022 Examining six attributes pertinent to a determination whether a particular entity occupies the status of a municipal corporation, the defendant board lacks two of the criteria entirely and only possesses some of the characteristics of two others. Prior case law indicates that the more statutory autonomy the entity possesses and exercises the more likely it is to be declared a municipal corporation, and here  when compared to other entities operating under more autonomous statutory authority  the defendant board looks less like a municipal corporation than an auxiliary of the establishing authorities. Here, the circuit court erred in finding that the defendant board possessed sufficient attributes of a municipal corporation. The pivotal point in this case is whether the defendant board is immune from tort liability and case law has consistently described the nature and scope of a claimed immunity as a matter of substantive state law. The circuit court erred in granting the plea in bar, as the defendant is not entitled to sovereign immunity. The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n\n210391 Appalachian Power Co. v. State Corporation Commission 08/18/2022 In consolidated appeals by an electric power company and the Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Counsel Division, challenging various rulings made by the State Corporation Commission during its triennial review of the power companys rates, terms, and conditions pursuant to Code § 56-585.1, the Commission erred in finding that it was not reasonable for the company to record its costs associated with early retirement of certain coal-fired power plants as asset impairments. The Commission did not err by implementing depreciation rates from a 2017 depreciation study for the years 2018 and 2019, did not err by refusing to apply Code § 56-585.1(E) retroactively, and did not err in finding that certain of the power companys affiliate expenses to be reasonable. All remaining issues in both appeals are now moot. For the reasons discussed in the present opinion, the disposition of the Commission is reversed in part and affirmed in part, and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Combined case with Record No. 210634\n\n210634 Office of the Attorney General v. State Corporation Commission 08/18/2022 In consolidated appeals by an electric power company and the Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Counsel Division, challenging various rulings made by the State Corporation Commission during its triennial review of the power companys rates, terms, and conditions pursuant to Code § 56-585.1, the Commission erred in finding that it was not reasonable for the company to record its costs associated with early retirement of certain coal-fired power plants as asset impairments. The Commission did not err by implementing depreciation rates from a 2017 depreciation study for the years 2018 and 2019, did not err by refusing to apply Code § 56-585.1(E) retroactively, and did not err in finding that certain of the power companys affiliate expenses to be reasonable. All remaining issues in both appeals are now moot. For the reasons discussed in the present opinion, the disposition of the Commission is reversed in part and affirmed in part, and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Combined case with Record No. 210391\n\n210640 Ames Center, L.C. v. Soho Arlington, LLC 08/18/2022 Claiming the status of a third-party beneficiary of a long-term ground lease, a developer filed a declaratory-judgment action against the lessee of an adjoining property, seeking to resolve conflicting interpretations of a lease provision. After holding that the developer was a third-party beneficiary, the circuit court concluded that its work was done and dismissed the case as having no further justiciable controversies to resolve. The dismissal is reversed, and the case is remanded to the circuit court to resolve the remaining contest over the scope of the developers rights as a third-party beneficiary of the lease.\n\n210569 Hill v. Commonwealth 08/11/2022 The circuit courts disposition, finding a convicted defendant in violation of probation and sentencing him to serve the balance of his previously suspended sentence, is affirmed. The Court of Appeals did not err in affirming the circuit courts 2020 revocation order. The defendants misconduct occurred during an expressly stated period of probation that necessarily implied a corresponding period of sentence suspension. The circuit courts order was consistent with, not violative of, the revocation power authorized by Code § 19.2-306(A), and the judgment is affirmed.\n\n220113 Haley v. Virginia State Bar 08/11/2022 In an appeal from a decision of the Virginia State Bar Disciplinary Board, no error is found. The Board has broad discretion when imposing sanctions, and on appeal the penalty imposed will be viewed as prima facie correct and will not be disturbed unless it is determined, upon independent review of the record, that the penalty was not justified by the evidence or was contrary to law. Here, the attorneys 18-month suspension was an appropriate sanction. The evidence established that he engaged in a long pattern of dishonest conduct in multiple jurisdictions and had previously been disciplined for similar forms of misconduct. The Board has the authority to set the effective date of a sanction and, in determining the effective date of a sanction, its decision is subject to review for an abuse of discretion. The Board did not abuse its discretion when it refused to stay the attorneys suspension under the circumstances of this case.\n\n210530 Commonwealth v. Kilpatrick (ORDER) 08/04/2022 In a prosecution on multiple counts of computer solicitation of a minor in violation of Code § 18.2-374.3(C), the circuit courts exclusion at trial of expert testimony offered to show that the defendant did not believe he was communicating with a minor, and that he lacked any motive to solicit a minor, if error, was harmless as a matter of law. In this case, the appellant has waived any argument that the claimed error in excluding the defense experts testimony violated his due process rights or any other constitutional principle. Thus, the decision may be upheld on the ground that any evidentiary error involved is harmless if it can be concluded that it did not influence the jury or had but slight effect. To reach this conclusion, the evidence of guilt must be so overwhelming that it renders the error insignificant by comparison such that the error could not have affected the verdict. Here, taken as a whole, the evidence of the defendants prurient interest in the person he was communicating with was overwhelming and, therefore, the proffered expert testimony on motive would not have influenced the jury or would have had but slight effect. Thus, any presumed error in excluding the expert testimony was harmless. The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n210568 Coxcom, LLC v. Fairfax County 07/14/2022 Because the Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) preempts the countys collection of Business and Professional Occupational License (BPOL) taxes for the sale of internet access services, the judgment of the circuit court is reversed and this action is remanded for a determination of the refund due to the taxpayer.\n\n210509 Patterson v. City of Danville 07/07/2022 In a medical malpractice case against a physician who treated the patient in a citys adult detention center, the circuit court did not err in concluding that the doctor was entitled to the protection of derivative sovereign immunity as an employee and agent of the governmental body, and that the allegations of gross negligence were insufficient as a matter of law. The judgment dismissing the case on sovereign immunity grounds is affirmed.\n\n210414 City of Charlottesville v. Regulus Books, LLC 06/09/2022 In a challenge to assessment of taxes on an author of legal fiction works under a citys business, professional and occupational license tax, the freelance writers business is not covered by the ordinance, and the circuit courts judgment ordering the city to refund his tax payments because the ordinance is unduly vague is affirmed on the alternative ground that the ordinance does not apply to this author. The circuit court erred by awarding the writer recovery of costs not essential for the prosecution of the suit and that portion of the judgment is reversed; the case is remanded to the circuit court for deduction of such costs from its award.\n\n210560 Marsh v. Roanoke City (ORDER) 06/09/2022 There is no reversible error in the judgment of the circuit court dismissing a petition for writ of certiorari challenging a board of zoning appeals decision that refused to find that operation of a halfway house in the petitioners neighborhood violated the local zoning ordinance. The petition  while making reference to Roanoke City and City of Roanoke  failed to name the Roanoke City Council as a party as required by Code § 15.2-2314. Failure to name the governing body as a necessary party within the 30-day window contemplated by the statute is a defect that, when timely raised, requires dismissal of the petition. The argument that petitioners should be permitted to amend their complaint under Code § 8.01-6 is also rejected, since Roanoke City is a misnomer for the City, not the Council. As the City is not the proper party to the petition, the repeated references to Roanoke City amount to a misjoinder, rather than a misnomer, and accordingly Code § 8.01-6 has no application in this case.\n\n210721 Seymour v. Roanoke County Board of Supervisors 06/09/2022 In their second amended complaint, neighboring property owners challenging a localitys decision to grant a special use permit to a wildlife rehabilitation center, which plaintiffs alleged would cause an increase in traffic on a private easement, harming them in several ways, the allegations of the second amended complaint  viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs  are sufficient to establish that the appellants may have standing to challenge the special use permit at issue. The circuit court erred in sustaining demurrers and dismissing the case with prejudice for lack of standing. The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n\n201523 Board of Supervisors v. Route 29, LLC 06/02/2022 In an action by the owner of rezoned property, the circuit court did not err in overruling the defendant Countys demurrer because the complaint alleged sufficient facts to state a claim that a transit proffer operated, in this instance, as an unconstitutional condition which is not enforceable. The Countys argument that voluntary conditional proffers need not bear an essential nexus, nor be roughly proportional, to the impacts of the development in question is without merit. The circuit court also did not err in denying the Countys motion to strike the evidence because evidence presented at trial was sufficient to prove that the transit proffer lacked an essential nexus and was not roughly proportional to the impacts of the rezoned property project, and, therefore, should not be enforced. The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.\n\n201329 Edwards v. Omni International Services, Inc. 05/26/2022 In a personal injury/premises liability action in which the plaintiff intended to name the owner of a defective dock at a lake resort as the defendant but named another corporation instead, the error was a misnomer subject to correction, but the four-part test under Code § 8.01-06 required for the revised pleading to relate back to the date of the filing of the original pleading was not met. The circuit court did not err in sustaining the resort owners plea in bar on statute of limitations grounds, or in dismissing the case with prejudice. Accordingly, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.\n\n210538 Anders Larsen Trust v. Board of Supervisors 05/26/2022 On a petition for a writ of certiorari by owners and occupants of residential properties immediately adjacent to a proposed residential treatment center for teenage girls, challenging decisions by the Countys Zoning Administrator and the Board of Zoning Appeals that no special use permit was required for this use of the subject property, the decision of the circuit court concluding that the neighbors lacked standing is reversed. The allegations made by the neighbors are sufficient to establish that they have immediate and substantial interests and allege burdens distinct from those suffered by the general public, and thus had standing. The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n\n201510 Chesapeake Hospital Authority v. State Health Commissioner 05/19/2022 In an appeal by a hospital authority operating a regional medical center, challenging a denial by the State Health Commissioner of an application for a Certificate of Public Need to authorize a new open-heart surgery service and additional cardiac catheterization equipment, the Commissioner made an error of law in misinterpreting the regulatory term services within the State Medical Facilities Plan provision at 12 VAC § 5-230-450(A)(2), and the courts below erred in applying the harmless error doctrine to an error of law in an administrative agency case under the Virginia Administrative Process Act, Code § 2.2-4000 et seq. The case is remanded for reconsideration by the Commissioner consistent with this opinion.\n\n210260 LaRock v. City of Norfolk 05/19/2022 In deciding a former city employees petition for implementation of a grievance panels decision to reinstate her and award backpay, the circuit court erred in refusing to implement the grievance panels decision. The circuit court may not substitute its view of the facts for that of the panel, consider additional facts not presented to the panel, or consider the grievance de novo. In this case, the circuit court refused to enforce the panels decision for an improper reason, and  by applying the clean hands doctrine  it invoked equitable powers where it was not entitled to do so. Here, refusal to implement the grievance panels decision deprived the former employee of her statutory right to a second grievance proceeding to grieve new allegations against her. The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded with directions that the circuit court enter an order which requires that the former employee be reinstated to her position and receive full backpay from the date of her termination in accordance with the panel's decision.\n\n210489 In Re: Hon. Adrianne L. Bennett (ORDER) 04/21/2022 In a newspaper publishers petition to intervene in a closed case, treated as a motion to vacate a sealing order in which this Court exercises discretion in ruling on requests to loosen or eliminate restrictions on sealed documents, and in light of the tradition of openness for court records anchored in the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and in Article I, Section 12 of the Constitution of Virginia, there is a presumption that court records should be accessible to the public. Although certain records of the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission are made confidential by statute, Code § 17.1 913, that statute does not apply to a mandamus proceeding filed in this Court. Here, the record warrants revisiting the order sealing the records of the mandamus proceeding and exercise of the authority to unseal this order. In addition, in the interest of openness and transparency, the remainder of the case is unsealed sua sponte, with the exception of two attachments to the petition for a writ of mandamus which remain under seal.\n\n210382 Boyle v. Anderson 04/14/2022 In an action charging breach of fiduciary duty by a trustee, neither the Virginia Uniform Arbitration Act, Code §§ 8.01-581.01 to -.016 (VUAA) nor the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (FAA) compels enforcement of an arbitration clause in the trust document, which is not a contract, and a beneficiary of a trust is not a party to an agreement to arbitrate. The circuit courts refusal to compel arbitration, appealed as in interlocutory matter pursuant to Code § 8.01-581.016, is affirmed.\n\n210443 Erie Insurance Exchange v. Jones 04/14/2022 In an action for declaratory relief concerning insurance coverage under a homeowners policy for injuries sustained by a passenger riding on the back of a small all-terrain vehicle (ATV) when she was struck by a tree branch, coverage was not available on the theory that the ATV was a land motor vehicle under the policy, because that provision was limited to injuries sustained on the property of the insured. The contention that the ATV was a farm type vehicle qualifying for coverage under the terms of this policy is rejected on this appeal. The ATV is a multi-purpose vehicle not designed and used primarily for farming. Final judgment is entered for the insurer.\n\n210318 Wills v. Wills (ORDER) 04/07/2022 In an appeal from a final order awarding a divorce to the husband and addressing matters of equitable distribution, spousal support, child custody, and child support  in which the parties presented 18 assignments of error and cross-error, including matters relating to whether the parties' \"Postnuptial Agreement,\" signed approximately one month after the date of the marriage, had been abrogated  there is no reversible error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals and the judgment is affirmed for the reasons stated in Wills v. Wills, 72 Va. App. 743 (2021). With regard to the second assignment of error, the trial courts award of prejudgment interest was based on its erroneous application of Code §§ 20-60.3(14) and -78.2, and affirmance of the Court of Appeals decision is limited to its determination that retroactive child support is not synonymous with an arrearage requiring an award of prejudgment interest under Code § 20-78.2. No position is taken regarding whether prejudgment interest could be awarded as part of a retroactive child support award under Code § 8.01-382.\n\n201007 Sidya v. World Telecom Exchange Communications 03/24/2022 In a suit by a telecommunications company charging misappropriation of protected trade secrets, tortious interference with business expectancy, and civil conspiracy, on this third appeal the defendant-appellants challenges to the trial courts partial final judgment are rejected on the issues of sufficient evidence supporting the trade secrets, tortious interference, and civil conspiracy claims, compliance with prior remand instructions in determining compensatory damages, trebling damages under Code § 18.2-500(A), awarding supplemental attorney fees and interest thereon, and running the award of interest from the date of the jury verdict rather than the date judgment was entered on the verdict. The trial court erred in refusing to strike the evidence offered in support of this plaintiffs claim for attorney fees incurred before and during trial, erred in awarding post-judgment interest on the punitive and treble damages, and its holdings on those issues are reversed. The trial courts latest decision is be affirmed in part, reversed in part, and the case is remanded with directions to amend the partial final judgment in accordance with this opinion.\n\n201419 Kittrell v. Fowler (ORDER) 03/24/2022 In a multi-party litigation involving claims of breach of fiduciary duty and other causes of actions regarding a widows successive interests and trust arrangements following her husbands death, heard as an interlocutory appeal pursuant to Code § 8.01-670.1, assuming arguendo that a claim exists for the rescission of a 2006 transaction transferring the widows minority interest in an LLC , the claim belongs to the widows estate as it would have belonged to the widow during her lifetime. Upon her death in 2014, any viable claim relating to the sale of her interest in the LLC passed to her estate and may only be pursued by the estates personal representative, under governing case law and Code §§ 8.01-25, 64.2-519, and 64.2-520. Because neither of the present appellees is the personal representative of the widows estate, they lack standing to bring such a claim. The circuit courts decision on this issue is reversed, the appellees claims regarding the 2006 transaction are dismissed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order.\n\n201349 California Condominium Association v. Peterson 03/17/2022 In a condominium associations in personam claim against the former owner of two units for unpaid special assessments, alleging breach of a provision in the condominium declaration requiring payment of all prior assessments at the time units are sold to new owners, the circuit court erred in holding that the associations failure to introduce the declaration into evidence at an ore tenus hearing precluded it from deciding whether to grant or deny the plea in bar on this issue. The declaration, conveyance deed, and settlement statement were all made exhibits to the associations complaint, and the former unit owner stipulated that his plea in bar assumed arguendo the factual allegations in the amended complaint. The circuit courts holding that the declaration could not be considered is reversed and this case is remanded for further proceedings.\n\n201515 Stahl v. Stitt 03/03/2022 In an action controlled by Uniform Commercial Code provisions regarding presentation, payment or dishonor of checks in the banking industry, as enacted in the codes of both Virginia and West Virginia, the plaintiff niece  who was a Payable on Death (POD) beneficiary of a Virginia bank account held by her aunt  did not have a vested interest in a check drawn on the aunts West Virginia bank when it was initially presented for payment, and she therefore could not rely on the prompt payment of the check. Consequently, she did not have standing to enforce the midnight deadline rule under the statutes, and her eventual acquisition of the Virginia account after the aunt died failed to alter the fact that she could not rely on the prompt payment of the check when it was initially presented to the West Virginia bank. Nor could she rely on prompt payment following a second presentment of the check in light of the particular circumstances of this case. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err when it granted the West Virginia banks motion for summary judgment, denied the plaintiff nieces motions related to the second presentment, and dismissed her amended complaint.\n\n201413 Farah v. Commonwealth 02/17/2022 In an appeal challenging the result of a circuit court proceeding to determine what portion of a settlement in a personal injury case is subject to the Commonwealths lien as a result of Medicaid program payments toward the plaintiffs extensive medical care, it is held that Virginias apportionment statute does not conflict with precedent from the United States Supreme Court and, further, the factual findings of the circuit court must be sustained under the deferential standard of review. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n201263 Virginia Department of Taxation v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco 02/10/2022 In a taxpayers consolidated applications for correction of erroneous assessment of corporation income taxes for a period of years, the circuit court did not err in holding that the Department of Taxations corporation income tax assessments for the years in issue were erroneous and ordering the Department to refund to the taxpayer the amount of its overpayments on the assessments for those years. Leaf tobacco simply stored in a Virginia warehouse for a period of time was not used in Virginia for purposes of the income apportionment formula prescribed by the taxation statutes. The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.\n\n201310 Godlove v. Rothstein 02/03/2022 An appeal in an easement dispute has been rendered moot by sale of one of the properties involved, and the parties agree that the trial courts judgment should be vacated. There is no longer any live controversy to be resolved, nor do the parties have any legal interest in the outcome of this appeal. When a prevailing party voluntarily and unilaterally moots a case, preventing an appellant from obtaining appellate review, vacatur of lower court judgments is generally appropriate and ensures that those who have been prevented from obtaining the review to which they are entitled are not treated as if there had been a review. Vacatur strips the decision below of its binding effect and clears the path for future relitigation. With this understanding, this appeal is dismissed as moot and the trial courts judgment is vacated. Because this case is now moot, leaving no substantially prevailing party on appeal, the request to tax costs against the appellee is denied, and each party is ordered to pay his own respective, incurred costs.\n\n210011 Cortez-Rivas v. Commonwealth 02/03/2022 In a rape case where one police officer had translated during a detectives crime-scene interrogation of the defendant, but a different officer testified at trial  translating independently from body-camera footage of the same interview  there was no violation of the defendants rights under the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution. Assuming, without deciding, that statements translated from one language into another by a translator can constitute testimonial evidence, thus triggering the protections of the Confrontation Clause, those protections were satisfied here because the translator whose evidence was used at trial testified in person, subject to cross-examination. The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Virginia denying an appeal is affirmed.\n\n200803 Smallwood v. Commonwealth 01/13/2022 A judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the circuit courts revocation of a defendants deferred disposition and convicting him for possession of heroin  due to his failure to pay court costs as provided in a plea agreement and deferral order  is affirmed. Statutes that permit the circuit court to impose alternatives to incarceration are highly remedial and use of these tools lies within the broad discretion of the circuit court. The plain language of Code § 18.2-251 states that, upon violation of a term or condition, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and, in this case, it is undisputed that the payment of court costs was included as a term or condition of the deferral order. Here, the defendants obligation to pay court costs was an express condition of his deferred finding of guilt originated with his plea agreement. The judgment of the Court of Appeals upholding the conviction is affirmed.\n\n201322 Emmanuel Worship Center v. City of Petersburg 01/06/2022 In a bill of review proceeding brought by owners of property arguably used for religious purposes to challenge a decree of sale for delinquency in tax payments, the circuit court erred when it dismissed the bill of review on the theory that the underlying action was an action at law. The circuit court further erred when it held that because more than three years had passed since these taxes were assessed, they were beyond review and that the property owners could not raise any defenses to the assessments. The judgment is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the circuit court for a determination whether the property in question was used for religious worship as defined in Code § 58.1-3606, and consequently whether any delinquent taxes were owed on the property.\n\n210054 Robol v. Virginia State Bar 01/06/2022 In an appeal of right from a decision of the Virginia State Bar Disciplinary Board suspending an attorneys his license to practice law for four years, no error is found in the Boards decision. Upon reviewing the present case, under established legal standards, it is concluded that the Board did not err when it determined that the Virginia attorney violated Rules 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, and 8.4 of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct. The plain language of these Rules establishes that associate members are attorneys who remain subject to the Bars jurisdiction and regulation, and the Bar acted within its authority when it pursued disciplinary action against this Virginia attorney for actions committed while he was an associate member of the Bar.\n\n210027 Commonwealth v. Richard 12/29/2021 In a case involving distribution of methamphetamine, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendants proffered jury instructions regarding a single buyer/seller relationship  as an exception to potential conspiracy liability  because there is not more than a scintilla of evidence to support the circuit court giving such instructions. Therefore, the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the defendants conviction for conspiracy. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the defendants conviction for conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance is reinstated.\n\n201145 Carter v. Commonwealth 12/22/2021 A felony conviction for assaulting a police officer is affirmed. The defendant made no verbal or non-verbal demand for the officer to leave the premises, and he was not a trespasser. The defendant resorted to violence immediately, hence her use of force against the officer to expel him was not lawful. Nor was there a Fourth Amendment violation in the officers completing entry into defendants residence to accomplish her arrest. The judgment of conviction is affirmed.\n\n201202 Stoots v. Marion Life Saving Crew, Inc. 12/22/2021 In a wrongful death action against paramedics and a nonprofit rescue service, the circuit court did not err in concluding that the paramedics, who did not receive compensation for their services on the day in question and were not shown to have acted in bad faith, were entitled to statutory immunity under Virginias Good Samaritan law, Code § 8.01-225(A)(5). Since there was no verdict holding that the paramedics were not negligent, however, the immunity of the paramedics was not a sufficient basis for finding that the rescue service itself was immune from this claim. The judgment is affirmed in part, and reversed in part, and plaintiffs claim against the rescue service is remanded for further proceedings.\n\n201362 Garner v. Joseph 201362 12/16/2021 In a prior litigation to apportion the riparian rights of the owners of two adjacent shoreline lots, the holders of an easement created by deed in favor of a third, neighboring lot across one of the two properties were necessary parties, without whose participation judgment could not properly be entered. In the present action, the rulings of the circuit court on summary judgment and demurrer that the owners of the easement were not necessary parties in that prior case and lacked standing to challenge the judgment entered in the prior proceeding are reversed. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n201160 Ehrhardt v. SustainedMED, LLC 12/02/2021 In an action by the purchaser of corporate shares seeking indemnification and other relief from the defendant sellers of those shares, under express provisions of a stock purchase agreement, the circuit court erred in awarding an amount of recovery for attorneys fees and litigation costs and expenses that  when added to other relief afforded to the plaintiffs in these proceedings  exceeded an express cap on the maximum indemnification amount allowed under indemnification provisions of the agreement. The circuit courts judgment regarding recovery of attorneys fees, litigation costs, and expenses awarded to the plaintiff is reversed, and final judgment is entered on this appeal awarding the plaintiff attorneys fees and costs in the total amount of $24,999.94, representing the maximum additional relief allowed by the parties agreement in light of other relief awarded to the plaintiff.\n\n201204 Commonwealth v. Cady 10/28/2021 In prosecution for misdemeanor reckless driving in violation of Code § 46.2-852, the requisite mens rea requires a reckless disregard by the driver for the consequences of his act and an indifference to the safety of life, limb, or property of others; what distinguishes a speeding violation from misdemeanor of reckless driving, and the misdemeanor from felony of involuntary manslaughter, is the likelihood of injury to other users of the highways. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing at trial, a rational trier of fact could reasonably infer from the evidence that this accident was not the result of a mere split-second, momentary failure to keep a lookout, an act of simple negligence  but rather a lengthy, total, and complete failure to keep a lookout, satisfying the recklessness requirement to support a conviction for reckless driving. The Court of Appeals erroneously held as a matter of law that no rational jury could have found this defendant guilty of reckless driving. That judgment is reversed, and the trial courts conviction order is reinstated.\n\n200840 Phillips v. Rohrbaugh 10/21/2021 In a daughters claims for both an equitable and a statutory accounting from her brother in his former capacity as an agent managing their fathers financial affairs pursuant to a power of attorney and in his present capacity as co-executor of their fathers estate, and her claim against the other co-executor of her fathers estate, seeking an equitable accounting, the circuit court did not err in granting demurrers as to all claims and dismissing the action because, under the facts pleaded, neither theory of accounting applies to this case. The judgment is affirmed.\n\n201245 Ayers v. Brooke Road, LLC 10/21/2021 In ruling on complaints to have several confessed judgments vacated a decade after they were entered, t"
