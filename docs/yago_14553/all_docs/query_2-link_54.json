During my time at IBM, I have been able to grow professionally as well as personally, building my project management, administration, relationship management and service design skills, gaining an understanding of a professional environment and working with several well known clients, whilst developing my knowledge of the Healthcare and Life Sciences industries. Iâ€™d like to say a massive thanks to David Cole for giving me the opportunity to work at ibm and for his endless support, to Nicole Mather for her leadership and encouragement, and to Holly Gray, Caroline Stanger and George Droungas for their mentorship throughout my year, constantly sharing their wisdoms and ensuring that I was always learning and increasing my responsibility. Thank you to anyone else I have worked with this year at IBM, I hope to cross paths with you all again in the future! ðŸŒŸ I am now looking forward to heading back to Loughborough University to finish my degree in Information Management and Business ðŸŽ“"
