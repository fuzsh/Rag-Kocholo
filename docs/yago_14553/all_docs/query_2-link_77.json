        "text": "At the time of our nation’s founding, Abigail Adams reminded her husband John to always “remember the ladies.” It was good advice then, and her words are still appropriate today. During the 2023-25 term, Minnesota Daughters will “Remember the Ladies” by focusing attention on the contributions of women to the history of our nation, our state, and our communities.\n\nAs one of the world’s largest women’s service organizations, DAR can and should leverage our varied interests, talents and experiences to create lasting impact in our communities. As we approach the 250th anniversary of the founding of our country, it is a good time to tell the stories of the women who contributed to our independence and those who, since then, have helped shape our country.\n\nThe symbol of this administration will be the showy lady slipper. State project pins feature three blossoms, highlighting the triple focus of Women’s History, Women’s Issues and Women Veterans. Proceeds from sales of pins will support programs and services benefitting women in the state.\n\nMany DAR committees lend themselves to service projects or programs in line with the theme. Consider programs on women in history, have supply drives for a crisis nursery or battered women’s shelter, support the women’s health clinic at the VA Hospital, provide hygiene supplies to local schools.\n\nThe scripture is from Psalms 31:25, part of its description of a virtuous woman: “Strength and honor are her clothing; she is confident about the future.”"
