This Minnesota town was named after the great lumber baron T.B. Walker, who was at the time one of the ten richest men in the world. Due to the many saloons and brothels, Walker’s wife did not want to live in town, so they established the nearby town of Ackley.\n\nFast forward to the mid 1900s – Walker becomes the Up North destination. At one time there were over 100 resorts around Leech Lake. While the number of resorts has declined, the service and accommodations of Leech Lake resorts are better than ever. Due to the many shops, restaurants and location on Leech Lake combined with up north hospitality, Walker finds itself on many ‘Top Ten List’ for Mn vacationers."
