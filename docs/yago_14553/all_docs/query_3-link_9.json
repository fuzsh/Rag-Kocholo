        "text": "DISCUSSION\n\nOur data show that, among HIV-infected patients, variations in CXR appearance and AFB smear at initial presentation with PTB occur continuously as patients present with lower CD4 counts. Previous studies have shown that AFB smear-positive PTB and the CXR findings of cavitary disease and upper lobe infiltrates are relatively less common in HIV-infected compared to non-HIV-infected persons.9,15–17 Radiographic characteristics such as mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, and lower lobe and miliary disease have been shown to be relatively more common in HIV-infected compared with non-HIV-infected persons,12,18 as has normal CXR.19 However, few studies have examined the relationship between level of immune suppression as measured by absolute CD4 cell count and the clinical and radiographic findings in HIV-infected patients with PTB across a spectrum of immune suppression rather than the dichotomous CD4 cut-off of greater or less than 200.12,18,20 Analysis of trends across multiple CD4 cell count strata shows that changes in CXR appearance of PTB occur in a continuous fashion across the range of CD4 counts rather than at a CD4 cell count threshold, and allows for a more nuanced understanding of how PTB presentation varies as patients present with lower CD4 cell counts. The continuous variation in CXR appearance of PTB across a wide range of CD4 cell counts suggests that CXR becomes increasingly insensitive for PTB diagnosis in HIV with advancing immunosuppression, even in patients with CD4 cell counts as high as 350 cells/µl.\n\nOur findings reinforce some of the immense challenges in TB diagnosis faced by clinicians in resource-limited settings relying on symptoms, smear and/or CXR, and the importance of routine culture for TB diagnosis in HIV-infected patients. The limited sensitivity of symptoms in active case finding has been demonstrated. 21–23 In addition, symptoms at presentation among HIV-infected TB suspects are non-specific and in our population were exceedingly common, even in patients without PTB (data not shown). AFB smear is also insensitive in patients with HIV, and performed worst in patients with advanced immune suppression. Although our study population had a relatively low prevalence of AFB smear-negative disease (16% in HIV-infected patients overall compared to past estimates of 30–50%,11,15,24 likely a function of the NTLP’s role as a referral center), the trend indicates that in some settings, the prevalence of AFB smear-negative PTB in HIV-infected patients with advanced immune suppression may exceed 50%.\n\nFrom the clinician’s point of view, our data suggest that CXRs cannot be used to rule out PTB in patients with advanced immunosuppression. A normal CXR at the time of presentation with PTB represents a major obstacle to PTB diagnosis. Our findings are consistent with previously published estimates of HIV-infected patients presenting with normal CXRs of approximately 2–22%.11,12,19,25 Along with limited sensitivity of CXR in patients with HIV infection is the problem of specificity, as the differential diagnosis for an abnormal CXR in an HIV-infected patient is broad and includes common diseases such as bacterial and fungal pneumonia. However, an abnormal CXR still remains a useful tool in PTB suspects, and the positive predictive value of CXR for PTB will likely remain high in settings with high TB prevalence. On the other hand, given the combination of nonspecific symptoms and a relatively high proportion of smear-negative PTB cases among culture-confirmed patients presenting with CD4 cell counts < 100, our finding of frequent normal CXRs in PTB patients with advanced HIV underscores the difficulty of diagnosing PTB in high HIV prevalence settings. Efforts to build capacity for routine sputum culture of TB suspects, HIV testing and earlier initiation of ART are likely to reduce the burden of unrecognized TB in communities with high HIV prevalence and TB incidence, until more sensitive, rapid, and point-of-care TB diagnostics are available.\n\nOur study has several limitations. As the NTLP is a referral center for Uganda, it is likely that patients with PTB seen at the NTLP have more severe or clinically advanced PTB in comparison with a general TB population. Patients are often referred when community providers have a high suspicion for TB, and delays between referral and evaluation at the NTLP are common. These factors may select for smear-positive patients and explain the relatively low prevalence of AFB smear-negative PTB. Another potential limitation is our inability to confirm whether or not subjects were taking ART at the time of presentation, as immunologic restoration due to ART might impact the presentation of PTB independent of CD4 count. Based on a self-report of negative HIV status and using cross-referenced data from another ongoing clinical study of ART-naïve patients in this population, we were able to confirm that at least 61% of subjects were not taking ART. It is possible that our definition of ‘culture-confirmed’ using ≥1 colony-forming unit (cfu) of M. tuberculosis in sputum culture may have led to the misclassification of PTB cases. This case definition, in contrast to a definition requiring a higher colony count (e.g., ≥10 cfu), increases the risk that we included subjects with false-positive cultures in our PTB group. However, on reanalysis using a definition of ‘culture-confirmed’ of ≥10 cfu of M. tuberculosis in sputum culture, the results remained unchanged.\n\nThe strengths of our study include restricting our analysis to culture-confirmed cases of PTB and the availability of CD4 cell counts at the time of presentation with PTB. Few studies in sub-Saharan Africa have evaluated PTB presentation according to CD4 count in culture-confirmed PTB cases, and to our knowledge none have been as large.12,26 The large sample size allowed for evaluation of PTB presentation across a much higher resolution of CD4 strata than has been previously published, and for analysis of the relatively uncommon outcome of normal CXR in PTB.\n\nImprovement in our understanding of the impact of declining CD4 cell count on the presentation of PTB allows clinicians to more accurately assess their patients’ likelihood of PTB and clarifies the limitations of current diagnostic tools among HIV-infected patients. Patients most in need of a rapid TB diagnosis, the most severely immune-suppressed, remain at highest risk for misdiagnosis given the poor performance of CXR, symptom screening and sputum microscopy in this group. Further research into developing more sensitive, rapid and point-of-care diagnostics for M. tuberculosis, as well as validation of their efficacy among HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression, should be made an urgent priority."
