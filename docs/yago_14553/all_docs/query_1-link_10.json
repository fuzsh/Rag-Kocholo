Jun 1869 Hillsborough, Orange County, NC m., Rose Mary Rosborough.\n\nFAMILY AND DNA NOTE: I wish to thank David Walker davwal@netease.net for sharing his family history which was written down by his father, William Pinckney Walker Jr. in 1961. Some time after 1869, Aaron H. Walker wrote in his biography: \"My ancestors as far back as I can learn came from Ireland and settled in Maryland in or about what year, I have never been able to learn - only that it was before the war for Independence. My Great Grandfather was named John, and in company with one of his brothers, Philip, moved and settled in Orange County, N.C., about 10 miles North West of Hillsborough before the Revolutionary War and as a soldier took part in it on the side of the Colonies, and for Independence. My Great Grandfather John married a Miss Ashford and they had eleven sons, but no daughters. My (Aaron Walker) parents raised three sons and four daughters.\n\n9.

William 2nd m.aft.1806 Grimsby Twp., Lincoln Co., Ontario, Elizabeth Baldwin b.1762 poss. Ontario d. 25 Jun 1817 Grimsby Twp., Lincoln Co., Ontario.\n\nRESEARCHER NOTE: Any maiden names, birth date or birth location information posted on various search sites for the older generations of these Walkers is just conjecture and not proven.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: HILLSBOROUGH, LITTLE RIVER, ORANGE COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA: In June 1965 Hugh Conway Browning held a long conversation with Mr. George Walker, born in 1888, son of Thomas Walker, grandson of Phillip Walker, great grandson of Robert Walker, and great-great grandson of William Walker. Mr. George Walker related that as a youngster his grandfather had told him a great number of items relating to his family history. Among them being that William Walker Sr, the first of his family in this area, came to Hillsborough, Little River, Orange County, North Carolina around 1767, from Canada. William returned to Canada taking with him all members of his family except his son, Robert, who on April 18, 1791, married Eleanor Latta, a daughter of John Latta, Sr. The residence of Mr. George Walker is located in the Schley-Caldwell area of Orange County, north of the present day road which runs by New Sharon Church and continues to the intersection of this road and the Guess Road at Hopkins Cross Roads. This was the home place of his great grand father, Robert Walker. The house was built for Robert by a man named Hanks about the time that Phillip Walker, (George Walker's grandfather) was four years of age, which indicates that the house was built about 1814. According to a note written by Miss Myrtle Walker, sister of George Thomas Walker, Robert (poss. meant William Walker b.1743?) Walker came from England to Canada, then from Canada to North Carolina on two horses.\n\nLand Transaction Records:\n\n1. In a deed dated 15 Nov 1784, Barney Grimes and Mary his wife, conveyed to William Walker 100 acres of land located on the south branch of Little River, it being part of a 360 acre tract of land granted to Thomas Perkins by John, Earl of Granville, 6 Dec 1761.\n\n2. In a deed dated 3 Jul 1787, Thomas Riggs conveyed to William Walker 100 acres of land located on the waters of Little River.\n\n3. In a deed dated 7 Apr 1788, Alexander Hunter and Susannah his wife, conveyed to William Walker 200 acres located on the south side of the North Fork of Little River.\n\n4. In a deed dated 30 Dec 1789, James Riggs conveyed to William Walker 100 acres of land located on the waters of Little River.\n\n5. In a deed dated 14 Dec 1791, John Mitchell and Elizabeth his wife, conveyed to William Walker 213 acres of land located on the waters of Eno River.\n\n6. In a deed dated 30 Aug 1793, William Walker conveyed this tract of land to Levi Whitehead (Whitted?).\n\n7. In a deed dated 28 Nov 1793, William Walker conveyed this tract of land to William Dunnegan.\n\n8. In a deed dated 17 Feb 1794, William Walker conveyed this tract of land to William Roark.\n\n9. In a deed dated 22 Apr 1794, William Walker conveyed this tract of land to Robert Walker.\n\n10. In a deed dated 22 Apr 1794, William Walker conveyed this tract of land to Robert Walker.\n\nThe aforementioned land transactions indicates that the known land purchases in Orange County, North Carolina were in November 1784 by William Walker Sr. Also, that he purchased other tracts of land in the years that followed. The probability is that William Sr came into Orange County around 1767, his eldest son Robert, was born in 1767 in North Carolina, and that William disposed of his real estate holdings not later the April 1794. It is also noted that the two April 1794 land transactions were to his eldest son Robert. According to a note written by Miss Myrtle Walker, sister of George Thomas Walker, Robert (poss. meant William Sr. ?) Walker came from England to Canada, then from Canada to North Carolina on two horses. This was about the time William left Orange County, North Carolina to Canada.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: GRIMSBY, CLINTON AND NORFOLK COUNTIES, ONTARIO, CANADA: William Walker Sr. served in the British army under Lord Cornwallis. The Ontario land granted, No. 139, to William Walker Sr. was located in Lincoln County, Grimsby Township on Con VII Lots 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Later the map of Clinton township, shows William Walker Sr. had also owned land on Con B, F and I Lots 19 and 20 on the shore of Lake Ontario. This land was at the end of Thirty Road, which at that time was known as \"The Harbour\", a port of call for lake boats for many years. He named his home \"Walker Hall\", which still stands on the shore of Lake Ontario on the original Crown lands granted to him in 1794 where he lived until his death in 1819. His grandson, John S. Walker, built onto the Hall in 1848. The Hall still exists as a Teashop and is no longer owned by the Walker family. William Walker is credited by some with having been Clinton township's first settler. He was active in the social and business life of both Clinton and Grimsby townships. In 1804, William was recorded as one of five \"Freeholders\" to choose two representatives of the district to run for members of the Assembly of Upper Canada and his name was on the voters list of 1812, 1816, and on all subscription lists for the building of the first church in Grimsby township.\n\nAround 1793, William Walker Sr., with his wife Sarah, nine of their children, David and Elizabeth Palmer's family, and the widow Margaret McCool's with her family came to Ontario, Canada.\n\nWilliam's petition for land grants:\n\nDated 10 July 1794 (W 1/9) - William Walker Sr. states that he has \"Just arrived with his Family\", (eleven in number, four of which are men able to bear Arms), from North Carolina, has suffered everything but Death by the American Revolution, had property in Land, 800 acres all of which was taken from him and Sold by the Rebels ( that were then Stiled); OC - Recommended. Grant No. 139.\n\nFurther \"He begs leave to inform your Excellency that he faithfully adhered to the British Government and can procure Witnesses of his Loyalty. He now prays for an allotment of Land adequate to his Family and does hope you will please to consider his long travel near 1000 miles and give him a grant that he may immediately improve, for his further subsistence or such other relief as that your Wisdom may seem meet and your Petitioner will ever pray\"; OC - Ordered that the petitioner and his family have a grant of 1200 acres.\n\nOn 13 May 1796 (W 2/46) late of North Carolina; came 2 years ago; has wife and 10 children; received 1200 acres; was in the army of Lord Cornwallis; lost all his property, both real and personal; lost 800 acres of Land; has expended upwards of L700 to raise sufficient supplies for his family; requested additional lands at the Long Point Settlement; OC - If the petitioner's children are of age they will receive lands in their own right. Rec 8 Nov 1799 (W Misc 1796 - 1815/34) - the following have been on their lots at Townsend about 3 years and have from 10 acres upwards cleared: Ralph Walker; Isaac Walker; William Walker Jr; John Walker; Sarah Walker m., Joseph McCool; Margaret Walker m., William McCool; Thomas Walker; Ann Walker m., John Henry; Philip Walker. (Between the years 1861 through 1890, several of the children of those named in the above record moved their families to Kent, Montcalm, Ionia, and Saginaw Counties, Michigan.)\n\nRESEARCH NOTE: The following Will was transcribed from a photocopy of the original hand-written Will of William Walker Sr. The photocopy was somewhat difficult to transcribe and transcription errors were inevitable due to some guesswork in reading it.\n\nLAST WILL AND TESTAMENT\n\nIn The Name of God Amen, I, William Walker of the Township of Clinton, County of Lincoln and District of Niagara, Yeoman, considering the uncertainty of this mortal life and knowing its appointed for all men once to die, being weak and infirm in body but of (sound?) mind and memory thanks be to Almighty God - do make ordain and constitute this my Last Will and Testament in manner and form following - That is to say first I give and commit my soul unto the hands of almighty God that gave it and my body to the earth to be buried in a decent and Christian like manner at the discretion of my executors herein after named and as to my worldly estate where with it hath pleafed (pleased) Almighty God to blef (bless) me with I give Bequeath and Dispose of in the following manner -\n\nThat is To Say First I give to my eldest son Robert Walker, In Orange County State of North Carolina, the sum of One Hundred Pounds New York Currency if called for within the space of seven years after my decease.\n\nI give to my son John the like sum of one hundred pounds of like money.\n\nI give to my son William the sum of one hundred pounds like money.\n\nI give to my son Ralph Walker the sum of Four Hundred pounds like money as above said and\n\nI give and bequeath to my son Thomas one Hundred pounds like money.\n\nI also give and bequeath to my grandson Archibal McKool, son of William McKool, the sum of two hundred pounds like money.\n\nI give and bequeath to my son Phillip the sum of one hundred pounds like money all the above said gifts and bequeaths to be paid in one year after my decease.\n\nI also give to my daughter Margaret Mckool one hundred pound like money to be paid her by my executors in year after my decease together with my large cafe (case) of drawers.\n\nI Alfo (also) give to my daughter Sarah McKool the sum of one hundred pounds like money and in like manner, together with my beft (best) bed and bedding with the curtains thereunto belonging.\n\nI give and bequeath to my daughter Nancy Henry the sum of five pounds like money.\n\nI give and bequeath to my granddaughter Sarah Henry my small cheft (chest) of drawers.\n\nI alfo (also) give to my granddaughter, Elizabeth Walker, daughter of my son Ifaac (Isaac), two hundred pounds like money as afore said together with my long smoking coat.\n\nI give and bequeath to my granddaughter Catharina Walker, daughter of my said son Isaac, one hundred pounds like money to be paid to my said granddaughters as they may severally come of lawful age.\n\nI give and bequeath to my granddaughter Sarah Walker, daughter of my said son Isaac, the sum of twenty pounds like and to paid in like manner when she becomes of lawful age.\n\nI also will and order that my dwelling houfe (house) and lot wherein I now live with the appurtenances, thereunto belonging to sold by my executors with the two years after my deceafe (decease) and the money arising therefrom to be disposed of for the following manner, that is to say, I give to my two daughters, Margaret and Sarah McKool, fifty pounds each out of the last mentioned property of my said houfe (house) and lot the remainder to be equally divided among my three sons to wit, Ralph, Thomas and Philip and my granddaughter, Elizabeth Walker, daughter of my said son Isaac, and I do further will and order that all the remainder of personal property not heretofore bequeathed shall be sold by my executors and the money arising therefrom to be equally divided among all the legatees heretofore named both children and grandchildren excepting my son Robert and my granddaughter, Sarah, daughter of John Henry, and lastly I do by these presents nominate and appoint my sons Ralph Walker and Thomas Walker and my trusty friend Jonathan Woolverton, Executors of this my Last Will and Testament and I do hereby revoke all former Wills or Executors by me made.

Beckwith. -- \"The first settlers arrived in this township about 1820, settling near the west center of town, among the first being John Colton, Daniel and John Jenks, Antony Connor, and William Phillips, while further south were Moore and George Hussey. In 1825 Zadoc Reeves located in the Jenks settlement, having come from Carlisle, where he had settled in 1819, to build a distillery for Jenks, he being a carpenter and millwright. Another old settler, and probably the first one, was Matthew Gray, who devoted his time entirely to hunting, following that as his sole means of livelihood. His wife used to wear shoes made of untanned hog skin, and his own garments were nearly all trophies of his success in the chase. Shortly after the arrival of Reeves came Sylvester Ripley, Isaac Kruzan, Thomas Patterson, James Watson, Joseph Hoskins, Ralph Wilson, the Montgomerys, Moody Chamberlain and Hulse, and a little later, 1835, arrived the Dickerson family and Peter Collins, who settled toward the east side of the township. These were shortly followed by Silas Pierce, John Harper, Isaac Hall and Alfred B Pegg. The last named was the builder and owner of the Round House, or, rather, Octagon House, from which the trading point known as Round House Corners takes its name.\"\n\nBURIAL NOTE: Elizabeth and Thomas are buried near Clay Co., IN.\n\nChildren are:\n\n6.

Walker Sr. but there is a confusing twist with him. I had for some time been confused about her name, was it Sarah or Sallie. Her name is Sarah but she was often referred to as Sallie. You may already know, I m not sure, but the Mary listed in the 1900 census, as John s wife is his second wife. Sarah died in 1892. It confused me for a long time because my father spoke of an Uncle John and Aunt Miss Carden. I knew this couldn t be his aunt because she died of course long before he was born. But John Carden was still living on the Walker farm with his second wife when my father was born and lived there until he died in 1938.
