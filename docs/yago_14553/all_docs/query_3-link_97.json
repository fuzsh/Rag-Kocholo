        "text": "Helpful Information\n\nIn America today, more people are marrying someone from a different religion or racial/ethnic group. According to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, nearly 37% of Americans are married to someone of a different faith.1 Additionally, the 2010 U.S. Census reported that 10% of Americans are married to someone of a different race.2 Researchers have offered several possible explanations for these growing trends.\n\nCouples are more likely to marry outside of their faith when these contributing factors are in play:\n\nThey are more independent of their family, do not feel a need to be of the same faith as their parents, experience a divorce, or expect a more balanced division of household responsibilities.3\n\nDiverse immigrants provide local residents knowledge about and exposure to religious difference and build acceptance of other religions in American society.4\n\nInterracial couples are more likely to marry when these contributing factors are in play:\n\nThey have a common religious orientation, education level, or global perspective.\n\nRacial boundaries weaken, differences narrow, and language and residential barriers diminish, thus making intermarriage more likely to occur.\n\nImmigrants of the third generation or later are more comfortable with the local language and culture.5, 6 Intermarriage can benefit immigrants or ethnic minorities to become part of the dominate culture, though they may lose identification with their own.7\n\nChoosing a Suitable Partner\n\nWhen selecting a life partner, values, beliefs, and other cultural and religious factors are evaluated in a filtering, stage-like process called Stimulus-Values-Roles or SRV. In the Stimulus stage, couples are attracted to each other. In the Values stage, couples analyze each other's values and beliefs, including cultural and religious traditions, to determine whether they are similar to or different from their own. In the final Roles stage, couples determine how various roles (e.g., childrearing, division of household chores, breadwinner, etc.) will be carried out in the relationship and whether or not the fulfillment of these roles can produce an enduring relationship. Couples determine partner-compatibility in each of these stages through filtering out potential partners who don't match their criteria.8\n\nYou may want to consider the SVR model as you think about your cultural and religious values; think about how you can leverage the challenges any differences may bring with the existing strengths in your relationship. As you do, you will be better prepared to determine the roles and responsibilities each of you will assume in your marriage.\n\nReligious Differences/Similarities and Marital Happiness\n\nResearch indicates that couples are generally more satisfied with their marriages when their belief systems are more similar or homogamous.9, 10, 11, 12, 13 In fact, the findings revealed that divorce rates were lower when spouses had the same religious affiliation,14, 15 were generally more religious, 16, 17 and regularly attended religious services together.18 Additionally, the degree to which couples did not share the same religious or theological beliefs predicted the frequency and type of conflicts they experienced, including an increased likelihood of divorce.19 Interestingly, more disagreements were found among highly religious couples who had different belief systems.20, 21\n\nGenerally, religiousness, or religiosity, was found to be a predictor of marital satisfaction. Joint religious attendance among homogamous couples, for example, led to greater marital satisfaction,22 and greater religiosity was related to higher levels of marital adjustment.23 Regarding gender differences, the more that husbands attended religious services and were generally more religious, the lower the frequency of marital arguments and the higher the marital adjustment scores in first marriages and remarriages.24, 25 For women in a remarriage, however, there were no differences in levels of marital adjustment regardless of the wife's level of religiosity. In fact, religiosity wasn't as strong for either men or women in remarriage, so it may not be a strong predictor of marital adjustment. However, when both the wife and husband were religious, they reported higher levels of marital adjustment.26 The risk of divorce in first marriages increased when the husband attended religious services more frequently than his wife. Theories speculate that regular joint church attendance provides a protective effect for the marriage by providing consistent social networks of like-minded individuals and strengthens bonds by reinforcing ideology and lifestyles.27 In addition to religious service attendance, regular in-home worship activities28 and other joint religious activities, coupled with fewer religious differences,29 increased marital satisfaction.\n\nIn sum, these findings seem to indicate that the greater the similarities in religious beliefs and behaviors, the higher the marital happiness. Further, couples are more satisfied in their marriage when they are similarly religious.\n\nRacial Differences/Similarities and Marital Happiness\n\nCouples of different racial and ethnic backgrounds tended to view their differences primarily as cultural rather than racial, with the exception of when they were initially attracted to their partner, or if they had experienced incidences involving prejudice or discrimination.30\n\nBeing of different races can definitely pose a challenge for intercultural couples. These challenges can definitely be overcome. However, if couples face disapproval and social pressure from families and society, their relationships may become highly stressful as a result.\n\nOur review of studies on stress in intercultural marriages found at least five particular sources of stress:\n\nMajor differences in cultural and world views\n\nMacrocultural reactions (negative responses from society and family) and microcultural differences (values, beliefs, and traditions within the couple)\n\nCommunication styles\n\nReligious and ethnic beliefs\n\nHaving an unbalanced view of their intercultural marriage (i.e., they distort or deny the differences, rather than integrate the similarities and differences into an overall balanced perspective)\n\nFurther, stress experienced in intercultural marriages may also be related to childrearing, time orientation, gender role expectations, connections to extended family, and particularly, which family subsystem will take priority or be dominant.31\n\nNot all intercultural marriages are stressful and divorce prone. However, research indicates that interracial marriages were 13% more likely, in one report, to divorce than same-race marriages.32 Though interracial marriage did not predict divorce per se, they were generally less stable and the risks varied by ethnicity. Among Whites, the ethnic group least likely to participate in interracial marriage, women tended to report the most stress. Among Native Americans, the ethnic group most likely to be involved in an interracial marriage (at over 50%), the distress rate was about twice as high as it was for Native Americans who were not involved in an intermarriage. The distress rate for Hispanics was elevated only when they married non-Whites, reaching over twice the rate of those married homogamously to other Hispanics. Interestingly, studies have found that if intermarriage improved the socioeconomic status of Hispanics or White women, the distress rate decreased.\n\nIntermarriages involving African Americans were the least stable (especially with a White wife).33, 34 Rates of distress also increased among Hispanics and Native Americans who intermarried. Intermarriage among Asians did not elicit increased distress for any groups, which may be a result of the fact that they are among the most integrated minority group in American society.35 In fact, marriages with an Asian partner were generally more stable than White homogamous marriages. Interestingly, the success of all of the marriages, except Asian–White, was predicted by the most divorce-prone group represented in the couple, rather than a balance of the two. The Asian–White couple's risk of divorce was a result of the balance of the two groups.36\n\nPotential cultural differences that must be negotiated were highlighted in one study that focused on Asian Indian-White marriages. These couples found that their families of origin were outspoken about disapproval and concern about protecting future generations, transmitting cultural values and traditions, and connecting with other generations in the family. Marriage outside of the race or culture was seen as a disruption of a sense of community, cultural heritage, and identification.\n\nWithin the Asian Indian community, partner selection tends to be carefully orchestrated within social status and income, with education and employment as key variables for consideration. Staying within the same range on these factors assures power and status equity within the families. Because marriage is a communal affair for the Asian Indian community, Asian Indian–White couples are often concerned and aware of social image and potential censures that could limit their ability to integrate into the existing community.\n\nCouples who overcome these challenges are more likely to focus on their similarities and perceive differences as strengths that broaden their view and enrich their relationship. They carefully discuss and negotiate the expectations and possible repercussions of conflicting cultures. Strengths in these relationships arise from spousal support, trust, and belief in each other. Immersion in either's culture can bring a unique sensitivity and awareness of differences, but also broaden their worldview.37\n\nIn sum, intercultural marriages across ethnicities experience different levels of stress and resiliency. The complexities can potentially be overcome successfully with careful negotiation and communication.\n\nOther Factors of Marital Success"
