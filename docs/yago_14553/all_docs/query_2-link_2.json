They later lived in Minneapolis, Minnesota and had eight children. Walker was president of Northwestern Hospital, now Abbott Northwestern Hospital of Allina Hospitals & Clinics, from 1862 to 1917, president of the Bethany Home now Walker Methodist Home, and worked with or was a member of the Women's Council of the City of Minneapolis, Hennepin Avenue Methodist Church, the Nonpartisan National Women's Christian Temperance Union, and the Minneapolis Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage to Women. Walker died in New York City in 1917 and was buried in Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis. Her gravestone says \"Harriet Hulet Walk er\" but she is called \"Harriet G. Walker\" by the Minnesota Historical Society as well as by Isaac Atwater."
