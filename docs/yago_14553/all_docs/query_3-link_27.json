She teaches introductory biology, genetics, bioinformatics, and research methods, and directs undergraduate research in her laboratory. In her lab, students annotate phage genomes as a part of the HHMI SEA-PHAGES program. Other students study the sensory and behavioral genetics of insects, using ants as a model system to explore how chemical contaminants change gene expression in the brain, and lead to abnormal behaviors. Brown-Kennerly enjoys teaching and advising students and has received university honors including the Women of Webster award from the Multicultural Center and International Student Affairs (MCISA), Learning Happens Everywhere from Student Affairs, and the Faculty Advising Excellence Award from Academic Affairs.\n\nBrown-Kennerly holds a BS in Biology from the University of Michigan, and a PhD in Genetics and Molecular Biology from Emory University. She pursued postdoctoral research in proteomics at the University of Washington in Seattle and was a research assistant professor in the Department of Genetics at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nMeza K, Elfrink J, Polzin R, Stanley R, Kodikara R, Brown-Kennerly V.

The photoreaction that is investigated is based upon the solid-state [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. They utilize this light induced reaction with the goal of synthesizing unique molecules that contain cyclobutane rings. Within the area of thermal expansion, Groeneman researches the ability to control the direction and magnitude of the tensors of expansion by varying the type and strength of non-covalent interactions that sustains these solids. In a similar manner, he also investigates the role of motion capable and incapable components play on the overall thermal expansion within these molecular crystals.\n\nProfessor Groeneman holds a BS in Chemistry from Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville and a PhD in Chemistry from the University of Missouri.\n\nGoogle Scholars Website\n\nH.R.
