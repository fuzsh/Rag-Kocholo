Mrs. Clinton Walker House (1951), Carmel Point in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California

Della Brooks Walker (1902-1984) wasn't just any Walker. She was married to Clinton Walker (1875-1944), who was the son of T. B. Walker, founder of The Walker Art Center.

In 1945, Mrs. Walker wrote Frank Lloyd Wright asking him to design a house for a property she owned in Carmel by the Sea. It took 5 years to design and build. Although it was enlarged in 1956, Initially, it was 1,000 square feet with three bedrooms, three baths, a kitchen and a 400 square foot living area.

"That is the kind of house I promised my client. This "cabin on the rocks" is not a family house but a haven at the seaside for a single individual living in specific comfort of her own choosing." - Frank Lloyd Wright

Thomas Church was the Landscape Architect

The 3,000 square foot roof is two and a half times the size of the 1,200 sq. ft. house and carport.

The triangular tables are by Margaret Bruton. The Bruton sisters lived just up the coast in Monterey. A similar grouping was shown in the 1954 Arts of Daily Living Exhibition in Pomona, CA.

The monoblock chairs are a weird move if you ask me.

The house is still owned by the Walker family.

This was one of the stops on a recent trip up Highway 1.
