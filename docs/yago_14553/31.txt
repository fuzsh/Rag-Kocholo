From the Lakewood Cemetery tour booklet:

Thomas Barlow Walker came to Minnesota in 1863 and began to acquire timber lands and set up sawmills throughout the state. Within 10 years he was among the most wealthy and influential men in Minneapolis. During the 1870's Walker's interests turned to art. In 1916 Walker and his wife began planning a new gallery to house his art collection. The Walker Art Gallery opened in May 1927, shortly before his death.

Son of Platt Bayless Walker (1808-1849) and Anstis Keziah Barlow Walker (1814-1883). Walker married Harriet Granger Hulet (1841-1917) on December 19, 1863. They had eight children: Gilbert M. (1864-1928), Julia A. (1865?-1952?), Leon B. (1868-1887), Harriet (1870-1904), Fletcher L. (1872-1962), Willis J. (1873-1943), Clinton L. (1875-1944), and Archie D. (1882-1971) Walker.
