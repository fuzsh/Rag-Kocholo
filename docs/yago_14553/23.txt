Porter (a semi-invalid), penciled the following entry in his diary that day: "clear cooler fine day. Whit took Wellington to Haddam to get a marriage license this morning. I went down with them. On the way home we filled the machine full of laurel...the church is to be decorated with daisies and ferns. Louise and Wellington were married a 4 o'clock this afternoon. There was a large crowd. Lots of autos. Everything went fine. All had a good feed afterwards, and all went home tonight. Whit took Wellington and Louise to Saybrook (train station?) about eight o'clock. Pa (Wallace Porter) went with them. Albert (family retainer) hoed potatoes this afternoon." The diary is in the posssession of Charles E. Rounds, Jr, 107 Mt. Vernon St., Boston, MA 02108 (2013).
