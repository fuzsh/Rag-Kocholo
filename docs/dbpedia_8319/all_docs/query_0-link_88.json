        "text": "Self-Portrait as Allegory of Painting, by Artemisia Gentileschi (Italy) c. 1638\n\nIt is always bittersweet when a contest comes to a close. The Women Artists contest generated so much interest in historic, underrepresented artworks and had part of the world abuzz in discovery and new creation.\n\nChoosing our finalists was no easy task, and Alarie Tennille, as our guest judge, had her work cut out for her in choosing the winners.\n\nPlease read the work of all our finalists here.\n\nWe say a hearty congratulations to the winners, again to the finalists, and a huge thank you to each and every participant.\n\nAnd a huge thank you to Alarie Tennille for sharing her talent and time with us. Alarie has been part of the Review from the beginning, contributing a wealth of poetry and expertise as a prize nomination consultant. We can't thank her enough for everything.\n\nThe runners up will receive $50 each and the winner will be awarded $100. Congratulations again!\n\nAlarie Tennille:\n\nCongratulations to all 24 finalists! You displayed such a broad range of style and approach that it was a pleasure to read your fine work and a bit of a struggle to choose only three prizes. Of course it’s a subjective call. There’s no other way to compare writing, but I did read my top contenders several times over and read them aloud. I also read them on different days and at different times to try to eliminate any judgements based purely on my mood of the hour.\n\nThe two runners up are equally ranked, but I arranged them with “Persephone” between the other poems for balance, since it’s the only poem written in more formal structure to a dark, realistic painting.\n\nTwo Runners Up\n\nLynne Kemen for “Group IV, No.3. The Ten Largest, Youth”\n\nIt’s fitting, giving the theme of our contest, that Kemen pointed out the femininity of the art with all warm colour, “nothing pointy or masculine,” and only round shapes that spiral, spin, and roll, much like her words on the page. I adore strong endings, and all three winners delivered those. Kemen leaves us with “delicate writing/ loopily scrawled,/ no signature, you know it’s me” –an intimate, satisfying, yet unexpected closure.\n\nMary McCarthy for “Persephone”\n\nAs a writer of ekphrastic poems myself, I find it more challenging to write to a traditional painting that tells a well-known story. What will surprise readers? What did the artist leave out?\n\nMcCarthy does a brilliant job of using lush writing to emphasize the chiaroscuro, the contrast of light and dark, in the art. I suspect this year all of us can related to what Persephone would feel coming out of the cold darkness into the warm and fecund earth, alive with flowers. Notice she does not tell us why Persephone was locked away from life. We already know that. While Romaine Brooks interprets the story through color and the contrast of light and dark, McCarthy makes us feel the emotion of the legend. In 2021, we, too, grow “ripe for resurrection.”\n\nFirst Prize\n\nSheila Lockhart for “You Are Here”\n\nIt tickles me that Lockhart did a stellar job matching everything about her poem to a canvas by the very Queen of Ekphrasis, Lorette C. Luzajic. Each time I read it, I find something else to compliment, but I’ll try not to keep you all day. She mirrors the art’s style with loose, mostly unpunctuated, stream of conscious writing. Her words bounce about and change direction much like the bee’s bobbing, hypnotic flight. This was one of the longer poems in the contest, but goes by so quickly, you want to read it over again.\n\nThe title was taken from the painting. “You Are Here” plants us firmly in a place and time, then we leap around the cosmos on a magical journey, while being oh so serious about science, logic, and decoding the “hidden source of happiness” that will direct us to our own honey. Imagine counting new galaxies appearing in front of you, “one two three/ five hundred and sixty seven.” Specific numbers must mean it’s true, right? This poem was pure delight for me. I hope Lockhart will share what she learns when she completes that last “tiny calculation.”\n\nGroup IV, No. 3. The Ten Largest, Youth, by Hilma af Klint (Sweden) 1907\n\nGroup IV, No. 3. The Ten Largest, Youth\n\nBurnt orange background for warmth\n\nroundness, spirals, buttery pinwheels-\n\nnothing pointy or masculine.\n\nSeashells, wombs,\n\neaster eggs in a basket\n\nComets cartwheeling, planets spinning\n\nYou are here.\n\nRolling baked rolls with cinnamon-\n\nspirals, round, soft\n\ntops, toys, skeins of yarn, tails trailing.\n\nRoundness reaching into hugs,\n\nsweet embrace, delicate writing\n\nloopily scrawled,\n\nno signature, you know it’s me.\n\nLynne Kemen\n\nLynne Kemen lives in the Great Western Catskills of Upstate New York. Her chapbook, More Than A Handful (Woodland Arts Editions), was published in October 2020. Five of her poems appeared in Seeing Things Anthology, Robert Bensen, Ed. She has been published or has forthcoming poems in La Presa, Silver Birch Press, The Ravens Perch, Blue Mountain Review, What We See In our Journeys Anthology, Martin Willitts, Jr, Ed.\n\nSpring, by Romaine Brooks (USA) c. 1913\n\nPersephone\n\nStill wearing winter’s shadow\n\nlike a cloak over her shoulders\n\nshe rises pale as the new moon,\n\na whisper of light\n\npromising to wax full\n\nabove the softening earth.\n\nLike the first spring greens\n\nwaking from a long dream\n\nher thoughts are folded close,\n\nseeds praying for release.\n\nShe steps into light\n\nlike the gate of morning\n\nbreathing flowers\n\nonto the lambent air.\n\nWhere each day is the first day,\n\nand she forgets there was ever\n\nany other season\n\npast her last grey dreaming\n\nin the cold underworld,\n\nwhere she slept and waited\n\ncradled in the roots of trees,\n\nlistening to the songs\n\nof rock and water\n\nthat kept her company\n\nuntil she grew ripe enough\n\nfor resurrection.\n\nMary McCarthy\n\nMary McCarthy is a retired RN who has always loved writing and art, finding both inexhaustible sources of inspiration. Her late discovery of ekphrastic work suits her natural inclinations, deepening the experience of appreciation and creation , making the journey from image to words both an exploration and an adventure. Her work has appeared in many journals and anthologies, most lately in The Plague Papers, edited by Robbi Nester, The Ekphrastic World, edited by Lorette C. Luzajic, and the latest issue of Earth’s Daughters.\n\nYou Are Here, by Lorette C. Luzajic (Canada) 2021"
