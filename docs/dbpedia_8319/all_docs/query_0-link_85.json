        "text": "My faces are big â€“ 7 feet tall. Theyâ€™re big but somehow intimate. They change as you move close in to the painting and then retreat. When I started to paint faces I tried to figure out how to fill in these expansive foreheads and spaces between the other features. I decided to treat these spaces as separate abstract paintings. Up close my paintings are an abstract mix of lines, dots, drips and splatters but from a distance some CHANGE to almost photo real. And you cannot see the forest and the trees at the same time. You interpret the paint differently depending of your viewing distance. You get two paintings for one. This is known as global versus local vision. The artist Chuck Close is well known for this.

This is a reality which you create by projecting your own emotions and seeing the painting through the lens of your own history. I also try to create an ambiguity for you to deal with. This is an ambiguity which you resolve with certainty one day and another way the next. There is a mystery which keeps you coming back - both to the physical painting to see how it was painted and then also to see how it makes you feel. There is a duality and contrast that creates this mystery. It is despair and sadness versus hope and resolve in the same image. Meet Destiny 33. She is a digital hybrid painting. Tell me how she makes you feel?

Romanticism should come to life through tender actions between the characters, and the high contrast should visually provide a striking juxtaposition. The backdrop should feature elements from ancient mythology, such as legendary creatures, gods and goddesses or other mythological symbols. It should not mirror or portray any specific culture or civilization, but rather a blend of numerous mythologies, thus creating a setting that is romantic, surreal and slightly mysterious.\n\nMy portraits start with an ambiguous expression, shared gaze and uncertain context calculated to provoke you into creating the narrative. I suggest certain features and realistically detail others. I use a limited pallet of acrylic paint along with metallic and iridescent colors that produce changing patterns with changes in lighting and view angle. Sometimes I paint multi-views. Frequently I paint facial features slightly out of alignment. Other methods include the use of inconsistent line and shading cues, e.g., lines for one expression and shading for another and I frequently paint slightly different expressions from one side of the face to the other. This frequently results in an expression which causes the viewer to exclusively see one or the other expression at different times. These variations, along with time, half remembered memories, and your state-of-mind, might make my images appear more real. The original Cubists thought so. They also believed that time, the fourth dimension, could be incorporated in their work so as to cause the viewer to process and perceive their cubist work as more real. They said they painted successive appearances in to a single image reconstituted in time. I now see Cubism as a way of perceiving reality.

Imagine a black sun at your core, a dark luminosity that is less innocent and more interesting than naÃ¯ve sunshine. The Black Sun symbolises the shadow aspect of our psyche while the golden sun underneath shows how integrating our shadow can help us transmute spiritual lead into gold. ðŸŽ¥ The video demonstrates how to use oil painting in alla prima technique to explore self-empowering process work.
