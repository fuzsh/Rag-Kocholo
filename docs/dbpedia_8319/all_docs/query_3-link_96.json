Romaine Brooks was an early 20th century American painter known for interrogating gender norms through her artwork. She often painted portraits of herself and other women in masculine or androgynous clothing and poses that challenged societal expectations. Brooks drew inspiration from her own experiences of exploring gender and sexuality as a wealthy expatriate artist living in Europe. Her paintings focus on psychology and gender performance, presenting complex portraits that lack clear gender definitions. Brooks was part of progressive artistic circles but did not follow any single movement or style. Today she is recognized for being ahead of her time in pushing boundaries around gender through visual art.",
