        "text": "Large changes in artistic idiom after 1900 tracked through the representation of the human form as it did through all traditional subjects\n\nAs the century turned, the two most influential works of art – for subject matter and idiom and for the expansion of the use of colour – were probably these:\n\nLes Demoiselles d’Avignon, 1907, oil on canvas.\n\nPablo Picasso, 1881-1973, Spanish. MOMA, NY\n\nDance (I), 1909, oil on canvas.\n\nHenri Matisse, 1869-1954, French. MOMA, New York\n\nTheir work was built, in great part, on the edifice constructed by Paul Cézanne, 1839-1906, French)\n\na generation older than Matisse and almost two older than Picasso, Cézanne pushed towards an abstracted figuration in his paintings of people\n\nwhich produced, not a fleeting impression, but a concentration, a distillation, of the object, landscape, or figure seen.\n\nLes Cinque Baigneuses (below) is said to be a primary source for Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon.\n\nMatisse, when he was a young man, bought, on installment, one of Cézanne’s paintings of bathers. He kept it for almost 40 years.\n\nHe studied it and drew from it, he said, the moral courage to sustain his revolutionary trajectory through the use of colour and form.\n\nFive Bathers (Cinq Baigneuses), 1877–1878. Oil on canvas.\n\nPaul Cézanne, 1839-1906, Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia\n\nPortrait of a Woman, c. 1900, oil on canvas.\n\nPaul Cézanne, 1839-1906. Private collection on loan to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC in 2018\n\nA third important development came from the mind of Marcel Duchamp who moved the artistic compass from art as the creation of material objects representing the reality of the world as the artist sees it\n\ntowards art as concept representing mental constructions of the world as the artist’s mind formulates them.\n\nThe Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass), 1915-1923, oil, varnish, lead foil, lead wire, and dust on two glass panels.\n\nMarcel Duchamp, 1887-1968, American born France. Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nThe artist’s published notes say that this is a work describing a constant state of sexual frustration.\n\nThe top half of the glass is the Bride’s Domain.\n\nThe lower half belongs to the Bachelors – the Bachelor Apparatus – men and various artifacts – all with meanings in the artist’s private lexicon – whose intended uses are for the capture of the bride.\n\nThe artist began making this work as soon as he reached New York. It took him 8 years to make. It was shattered in transit and the artist meticulously patched up the glass, contented with what he thought of as a fortuitous completion.\n\nHere is Marcel Duchamp’s Bride fleeing downstairs, away from the bachelors pursuing her,\n\naway from from the socio-political and religious constraints which have held women in places not of their own choosing since time immemorial.\n\nNude Descending a Staircase, 1912, oil on canvas.\n\nMarcel Duchamp,1887-1968, American born France.
