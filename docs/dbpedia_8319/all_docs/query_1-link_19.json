        "text": "ROMAINE BROOKS 1874 - 1970\n\nTwo Paintings by Romaine Brooks or Comparative Seeing for Beginners\n\nI.\n\nA young man sits at a grand piano. His eyes are closed, his hands, at the center of the keyboard, are in the middle of playing. He is highly focused. His profile, his ear, his hands, physique are all very fine, the skin deathly pale. The androgynous pianist is portrayed before a beige-gray, monochrome ground in profile. The line of his back is optically lengthened by his cape. Severe, ebony contours lift the seated pianist into the image foreground, and lend him dramatic autonomy.\n\nThe smooth surface of the piano is noticeable due to the reflections and light reflexes on its top, towards the bottom it becomes a vivid, inky expanse. The realism of the instrument and the pianist is only spelled out in as much detail as necessary. The reduced, abstract expanses are painted in a vivid style. The sitter wears a perfectly fitted black suit with a white shirt and has a type of cape thrown over his shoulders. Black fabric is draped over the piano stool, falling in folds. All of the clothing items are menswear that befit the sitter’s rank. The figure and the actually monstrous instrument are unified by their color. Like a dark frozen wave, its swell beginning with the pianist’s back and breaking out of the right side of the picture.\n\nRenata Borgatti, Au Piano, 1920\n\nThe musician is shown in a heroic moment of great sincerity and concentration. She is completely introspective, creating and hearing music simultaneously. A female dandy. The figure of the dandy, an extravagant variety of gentleman, is characterized by elegance, perfect manners and ambiguous sexuality. The dandy is also a master of performative role-playing with bourgeois conventions and concepts of class. As a conscious performer of identity (including the knowledge of own limitations), the dandy has represented a modernistic type of person since the 19th century. He is a culturally potent figure, distanced from himself. Renata Borgatti, who was the painter’s lover for a short time on the island Capri, is portrayed in this painting as an impressive author-pianist, embodying depth and intellectualism.\n\nRomaine Brooks called her pictures from 1920 on portraits of modern women, and always gave them titles that identified the figures, who usually had a masculine demeanor, as women, for instance her famous portrait of the painter Hanna Glucksmann Peter (A Young English Girl) from 1923-1924.\n\nII. Le Piano, 1910\n\nA young woman sits in an armchair facing 8 o’clock from the viewer’s perspective. She is in profile, looking out to the left side of the picture. A horizontal black stripe of paint behind her highlights her pale face. To the right edge of the painting, a cut-off “leg” implies that the piece of furniture in the background must be a piano. The veil, lifted back, is in line with her status, and it curves up, blackish-brown, above the edge of the piano, and cascades down her back. Despite the achromatic, reduced colors of the painting, the face of the sitter seems vivid and clear. The white flowers, cultivated nature and iconographic heralds of innocence, are the frontmost and also the lightest part of the picture.\n\nThe figure is sitting up very straight on the upholstery, still wearing her voluminous coat. Her stillness highlights the fact that she has just arrived, or is about to leave. Romaine Brooks also painted a situation of heightened attentivity and focus here: listening to music.\n\nThe girl’s ear, the organ which the music enters, is the point of the image that our gaze is drawn to and stays. Since the figure is looking out of the image to the left, and parallel image axes are predominant, the focal point is to the left above the center of the picture (instead of to the right, as usual). We can feel the anatomy in detail, sense every bone, and also see her small earring. “Lady at the piano” is a common trope of interior painting around the turn of the century. The piano as a symbol of economic prosperity and an attribute of higher education turned the player herself into a status symbol. The location of the piano, usually a bourgeois salon, represented the interface towards the outside world within a private environment, so it accordingly it served as a space of representation. Unlike James McNeill Whistler, who paints a pianist in a similar composition in 1859, in a detailed, domestic and bourgeois scene, and gives her a child listener, Romaine Brooks almost completely eschews the addition of symbolical attributes.\n\nAlthough the painting from 1910 fulfills the conventions of interior painting and genre painting, what we see here is a strong individual, occupied with an intellectual activity, as is so often the case with Romaine Brooks. The young listener is completely and fully the subject of her surroundings. In the two pictures, painted 10 years apart, Romaine Brooks illustrates the experience of music wonderfully through her two protagonists.\n\nAutofiction IV or Comparative Seeing for Beginners\n\nIn 1995, at the age of 20, I attended the course “Training Comparative Seeing for Beginners with Originals” at the Free University of Berlin. Almost exclusively young women viewed and described paintings by men at the public collections on Berlin’s Museum Island, under the guidance of an art history professor who was mellow with age. It was terrible and great at the same time. After the first shock over the ritual of the formalist approach and my new, stuffily academic surroundings, I found my way from seeing to recognizing. Speechlessness and then finding words, the norms of liberal arts language, the corset of form-based visual comparison were an instructive lesson in visual thinking and description. During these collective sessions of viewing art, which were free from biographical, historical or class-related anecdotes (after all, the canonization was to occur via the comparative formation of style), I saw and felt very clearly, for the first time, that something was wrong with the gender ratio of all participants involved, including the protagonists of the paintings. I only recognized the full scope of my academic “primal scene” much later.\n\nRoseline Rannoch\n\nScroll down for German version"
