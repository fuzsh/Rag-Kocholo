        "text": "Discussion of examples of queer abstraction by lesbian feminist artists in the 1970s, with a focus on single works by Louise Fishman, Joan Snyder, and Harmony Hammond (along with brief accounts of more recent abstracting paintings by Amy Sillman and Christina Quarles). In Katy Siegel and Mark Godfrey, eds., 'Making Their Mark: Art by Women in the Shah Garg Collection' (New York: Gregory R. Miller & Co, 2023), 70-79.\n\nWhile Tee Corinne has been widely recognized as a preeminent lesbian and feminist artist of the last forty years, little has been written about her as an artist or art historian in any substantial way. This article attempts to shed light on Corinne's investment in creating explicitly sexual lesbian visual art and art historical writings that put pressure on the categories of artist and art historian between the 1970s and early 2000s. Corinne's work manages to fulfill feminist ideals while also working outside of the norms set up in both the lesbian and mainstream realms of art and art history.\n\nThree artists from New Mexico who identify as lesbian or queer create work that is informed by their life experiences. Their works show no literal explanations but depict symbolic resolutions. Who they are and what they have experienced have had a strong impact on their work. Through specific materials and distinct color palettes they share certain elements of their identities and experiences with viewers. It is the viewer’s task to try and discover what the works are about and what each artist has communicated. Two of the artists, Harmony Hammond and Helen Cozza, identify themselves as lesbian and Erin Forrest identifies herself as queer.\n\n\"Coded: The Hidden Love of J. C. Leyendecker,\" directed by Ryan White (New York: Imagine Documentaries, 2021) is a short documentary film on the life and work of one of the most prolific illustrators of the “golden age” of American illustration (1895-1960). This review describes the film’s creative techniques for bringing Leyendecker’s story to a contemporary audience and the larger historical contexts in which it situates his life, work, and career. It interrogates the film’s claims that Leyendecker’s homosexuality explains the “coded” homoerotic themes in some of his paintings and contributed to his fall from favor in the 1930s and erasure from popular historical memory after his death in 1951. It argues that despite being visually innovative, Coded presents a muddled and contradictory argument largely due to its reliance on two conflicting narratives of the gay and lesbian past. Finally, it suggests some alternative avenues for exploring the significance of Leyendecker’s work by better situating it within the early twentieth century history of gender, sexuality, and popular visual and consumer culture in the United States."
