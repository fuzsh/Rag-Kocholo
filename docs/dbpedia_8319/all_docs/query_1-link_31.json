        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n2 Romaine Brooks’s La France Croisée allegory, androgyny, and aPProPriation Elizabeth Richards Rivenbark Women have always participated in war, supporting their loved ones, tending to their wounded, and mourning their dead as well as through more active and subversive means, but the role women played during the Great War went well beyond the private sphere. During this war women became the public face of nursing, a practice that had grown exponentially with the weapons and systems of modern warfare. The cultural memory of nurses participating in the Great War is shaped to a large extent by the poster campaigns propagated by governments to rally troops and nonprofit organizations, most notably the Red Cross. Images such as the wellknown Red Cross poster The Greatest Mother in the World shaped cultural memory of wartime nursing as motherly and Christian while others emphasized femininity and the independence of the “new woman” as parallels to nursing and volunteerism. Romaine Brooks’s La France Croisée also represents this face of war but in painting: woman as an allegory of France, as Christian crusader, and as nurturer. The woman’s headdress signals her caregiver’s profession and the large red cross at her shoulder identifies her as working with the Red Cross organization, although she is remarkably different from the women typically pictured on Red Cross propaganda posters with motherly figures tending to wounded soldiers and orphaned children or Gibson Girl–style youths beckoning for help. Brooks’s nurse is statuesque, not cherubic; she is strong in her stature and confident gaze, not alluring and tender. This Byronic representation of nursing helped set the tone for the role of women in the Great War, as the painting became a prominent image when reproductions of it were sold to raise money for the French Red Cross. This chapter explores the collective memory surrounding women’s participation in the Great War with special attention to the role of nursing as well as the personal symbolism of the artist found in the painting. As an American expatriate in Paris and a woman of nontraditional gender and sexual identity, Brooks’s role in creating an image that would come to represent the face of women in the war and a painting adopted as a symbol of the 47 b ro ok s’s L a f r a n c e c r o i s é e Red Cross reflects a reception that would hardly be paralleled in today’s often conservative climate. Part of the history of Brooks’s painting must consider the history of reproductions and war imagery in France, because the image was replicated in print form as a fund-raiser for the Red Cross. Posters and prints were a lucrative and popular form of art in France as early as the seventeenth century but became ever more popular as production means became simpler and cheaper in the nineteenth century. The majority of reproductions were not of fine art but of religious subject matter or current events, including images of war.1 The most well-known early lithography in France came from the craftsmen in Nancy and Epinal in Lorraine whose posters were known as images d’Epinal, and many of the popular images of war from these posters influenced artists as they created the visual iconography for the Great War.2 The imagerie d’Epinal began as a French folk tradition, and many of the images produced maintained a visual naïveté that appealed to its audience; according to Jay Winter, the childlike quality suggested a timelessness to the images so as to make the war seem imaginary and story-like and so served as a buffer from the brutal nature of war.3 The imagerie d’Epinal created a romanticized version of the war that emphasized bravery and nationalism. A common figure found in this form is the female allegory for France or Marianne. Winter discusses one such woman in a poster titled The Victory of the Marne where a fierce woman marches forward alongside the army with the tricolor at her back.4 She is no mortal woman but a winged victory, armored Athena, and capped Marianne combined. Like La France Croisée, a city burns along the horizon and plumes of smoke fill the sky, though Brooks’s somber tone in both coloration and demeanor sharply contrasts with the image d’Epinal. The two images were produced at roughly the same time, La France Croisée produced sometime between the..."
