He further wrote, "Our script traces the emotional journey of a forgotten genius who is slowly losing his mind. Since awareness and support for mental health issues is sharply lacking in India, we chose the 'Mental Health Awareness Month' to make the announcement."

The film revolves around the mental health issue and the film is likely to go on the floors by the end of this year.
