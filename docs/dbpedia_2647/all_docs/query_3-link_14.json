        "text": "Mumbai: Filmmaker Hansal Mehta on Wednesday marked 10th anniversary of his 2013 biographical drama film 'Shahid', saying the movie has given him a lot and started his collaboration with actor Rajkumar Rao.\n\nThe critically-acclaimed film is based on the life of lawyer and human rights activist, Shahid Azmi, who was assassinated in 2010 in Mumbai.\n\nSharing the official poster of the film on Instagram, the filmmaker said the film had marked his new innings as a filmmaker.\n\n\"10 years of #Shahid. Just a lot of gratitude for what it has given to all of us. Shahid Azmiâ€™s unfortunate killing gave me a new life as a filmmaker. This film began my fondest collaboration with @rajkummar_rao,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nThe 55-year-old director also tagged the rest of the film's cast, including Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, Prabhleen Sandhu and Baljinder Kaur, as well as co-writer Apurva Asrani, producers Anurag Kashyap, Sunil Bohra and casting director Mukesh Chhabra.\n\n\"Always thankful to @ronnie.screwvala and #SidRoyKapur for championing this small film with a big heart. Thank you Shahid Azmi,\" he added."
