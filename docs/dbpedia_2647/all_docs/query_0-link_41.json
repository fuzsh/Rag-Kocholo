This is not just a film for us, it's an emotion for all of us who were involved in making this film. Have so many people to thank starting with my friend, father, brother, director @hansalmehta sir,\" the actor wrote.\n\n\"The film that gave me my voice. Eternal gratitude to the team that made it happen. #8YearsofShahid,\" the filmmaker wrote.\n\nAsrani, who had co-written and edited the film, took to Twitter and noted how \"Shahid\" was instrumental in changing several lives.\n\n\"#Shahid is the true story of a man who stood alone against an oppressive system. The film was made with pure love and passion and changed many lives, including mine. Eternal gratitude to captain @mehtahansal, @RajkummarRao and our fantastic team. #8YearsOfShahid,\" he wrote."
