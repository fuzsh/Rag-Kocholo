Who can forget his open letters to Kangana Ranaut, with whom he fought tooth and nail for his due credit? Now, he is fighting for getting unnecessary credit - somewhere he was not supposed to be credited. The writer-editor has called out Raj Kapoor Awards for Excellence in Entertainment, established by thedailyeye. The awards have allegedly wrongly attributed Apurva as part of the jury. Apurva Asrani Points Out the Sexism in the Reception Towards Milind Soman's Nude Pic and Poonam Pandey's 'Obscene' Photoshoot!\n\nAlso Read | Paava Kadhaigal Movie Review: Kalidas Jayaram and Sai Pallavi’s Segments Stand Out in This Netflix Anthology That Is Hard-Hitting But Not As Impactful (LatestLY Exclusive)\n\nApurva took to Twitter and clarified, \"This must be a misunderstanding. I have been named as a jury member for #TheDailyEye awards & I have NOTHING to do with them. I have not seen many of the winning titles, let alone the nominations & was NEVER contacted to be on the jury.\"\n\nIn an article published on dailyeye, the author wrote, \"...jury comprising director of photography Faroukh Mistry, editor-writer Apurva Asrani, sound designer Kunal Mehta, senior government officer Sushil Poddar, film scholar Dhruv Somani and actor Asha Parekh, chaired by our resident OTT reviewer Khalid Mohamed.\" R Balki's 'Find Me a Better Actor than Alia Bhatt or Ranbir Kapoor' Statement Gets a Strong Reaction from Swara Bhasker, Apurva Asrani and Others.\n\nAlso Read | Andhadhun Tamil Remake: Santhosh Narayanan Roped In As The Film’s Music Director!\n\nApurva's Tweet Reads\n\nManoj Bajpayee, who is a good friend of Apurva, found this hilarious. He also reacted to the 'fake news'.\n\nManoj Wrote\n\n\"Strange. I hope they remove my name & put out a clarification,\" Apurva replied to Manoj.\n\nThis is not the first time Manoj and Apurva have poked fun at Bollywood and its many wrongdoings. Just recently, they had talked about a certain journalist who developed hard feelings for them. A year ago, Apurva had called out the journalist for his blind articles, and Manoj had supported his friend."
