        "text": "Mumbai: Melody queen Lata Mangeskhar's reaction to Ranu Mondal, stating that the internet sensation should \"be original\" and \"imitation is not art\", has disappointed many fans and social media users, who feel the legendary singer could have been \"more gracious\". \"Such a superstar and so ungracious,\" wrote a user on Twitter. These are also joined by the Bollywood celebrity Apurva Asrani who won a National Film Award for Best Editing in 2000 for the film 'Snip!'. He tweeted along with an article carrying legendary singer's reaction on Ranu- \"This statement lacks grace. Reminds me of my childhood when original talents like Runa Laila, Suman Kalyanpur, Usha Uthup & Sadhna Sargam didn't get their due because Lataji ruled the roost. Only imitators survived, somewhat. #RanuMondal #LataMangeshkar\". \"A poor lady sang on a railway platform for a living. #RanuMondal's voice was miraculously noticed by SM and she became a star. Inspiring Lata ji could have been more gracious, complimented and helped her. This lecture on \"imitation\" was avoidable,\" another user said. \"Imitation is not art\": Lata Mangeshkar REACTS on Ranu Mondal who became a viral sensation after singing ‘Ek Pyar Ka Nagma Hai’ Apurva Asrani ALSO - 'Simran' co-writer Apurva Asrani slams Kangana Ranaut after another credit controversy with ‘Manikarnika’ A user \"disagreed\" with Mangeshkar and called her \"a bit harsh\", while another said that this could have been taken in \"true spirits by a senior artist like Lataji\". Mondal, who has now recorded three tracks for singer-composer Himesh Reshammiya for his upcoming movie 'Happy Hardy and Heer' titled 'Aadat', 'Teri Meri Kahani' and 'Ashiqui Mein Teri 2.0', became an overnight social media sensation after a video of her singing Lata Mangeshkar's soulful number \"Ek pyaar ka nagma hai\" at Ranaghat railway platform went viral on the internet last month. \"I Look After Ma, Still Everyone Blames Me\": Ranu Mondal's Daughter Elizabeth Sathi Roy The video has paved the way for her phenomenal rise from a street singer to a debutante playback singer in Bollywood.
