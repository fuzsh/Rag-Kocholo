        "text": "Bollywood actor Shahid Kapoor, who has made his mark in the film industry with his remarkable performances in many of his films, shared his experience of working in Hansal Mehta's film Shahid. As 2013 biographical drama Shahid completed five years on Thursday, Rajkummar, who got his first National Award for his performance in the film, became nostalgic and reminisced its glorious journey.\n\n\"And it's five years of 'Shahid'. A very special film which gave me and my dearest Hansal Mehta sir, our first National Award, and got me my first Filmfare Award. Thanks for all the unconditional love. As Shahid says, 'Waqt lagta hai par ho jaata hai' (It will take time but it will happen for sure). More power to all our real life heroes,\" the 34-year-old actor wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe film's editor Apurva Asrani also celebrated five years of \"Shahid\" and tweeted: \"'Shahid' brought me back from oblivion and changed my life forever. Thank you Hansal and team 'Shahid'.\"\n\nThe film was based on the real life story of murdered lawyer-activist Shahid Azmi. Rajkummar essayed the titular role of a lawyer who represents the accused in high profile terror cases.\n\n(With IANS Inputs)"
