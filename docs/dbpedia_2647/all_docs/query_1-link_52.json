Storytelling (on film) occurs in three stages: on paper (writing), on sets (direction) and in the editing room. Apurva Asrani has had the experience of wearing all three hats. He’s been an integral part of some of the finest Hindi films in the last 20 years. Spoke with Asrani about his experiences working with RGV, Kalpana Lajmi, Hansal Mehta and Nagesh Kukunoor; his role in persuading RGV to switch from Steenbeck to Avid; the personally cathartic experience of writing ALIGARH; Indian queer cinema; and struggles of gay men in India.Asrani was articulate and insightful with his responses, and bared his soul on several issues he holds close to his heart. I greatly appreciated that. I think you’ll too. Part 2 of my conversation with Apurva Asrani.
