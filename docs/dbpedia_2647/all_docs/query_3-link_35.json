        "text": "Shahid Kapoor has started shooting for his next film titled Deva. The action thriller was announced last year and since then fans are excited. Well, today Shahid Kapoor shared a new photo from the set of the film which left all his fans more excited. He has sported an intense look and the photo has also gone viral on social media.\n\nTaking to his Instagram handle, Shahid Kapoor wrote, “Do what you love and you don’t need to work another day in your life ! Making movies is magic. On set DEVA .” In the photo, we can see Shahid wearing a black colour tee and denim. He is in his character mode and understanding what his director is saying. He is listening to him. One of the fans wrote, “Can’t wait For This One #Deva” Another wrote, “Looking tough! Waiting for Deva.”\n\nTake a look here:\n\nThe actor took to Instagram to announce his new film on the occasion of Dusssehra last year. He also shared the first look in which Shahid appeared to be playing the role of a police officer in the movie. In the photo, Shahid was seen flaunting his short hairdo while holding a gun in his hand. The actor sported a bracelet and wore a half-button shirt with a pair of khakee pants. Shahid completed his look with a pair of sunglasses that reminded us of Kabir Singh. Sharing the photo, Shahid revealed that he is locking Dussehra 2024 for Deva. “DEVA in theatres on Dussehra 11th October 2024,” he wrote. The film also stars Pooja Hegde.\n\nDeva will be directed by Rosshan Andrrews and is produced by Zee Studios and Roy Kapur Films. Producer Siddharth Roy Kapur said “We are thrilled to embark on the exciting journey of DEVA with Shahid, Rosshan and Zee Studios. This is a script that has the potential to reach out to audiences across the entire spectrum, and with an incredible cast and crew in place, we can’t wait to bring it to life. See you in cinemas worldwide with DEVA next Dussehra!”\n\nHe was last seen in Teri Baaton Mein Uljha Jiya. The film was loved by audience. It also stars Kriti Sanon in the lead role."
