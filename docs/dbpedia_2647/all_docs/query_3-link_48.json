        "text": "Mumbai, 14th Feb 2023 (NewsHelpline) - Filmmaker Hansal Mehta walks down the memory lane and share some candid details about his award winning movie, Shahid, and dedicate his movie to entire cast and crew, along with backers.\n\nHelmed by Hansal Mehta and portrayed by Rajkumar Rao, 'Shahid' brought National film awards for both the actor and director.\n\nMehta posted a long note with the first poster of the film. He wrote, \"And this was the first concept/desperate pitch poster of Shahid made from the stills taken by @rumrainroad and @jaihmehta. The film did not have a title yet. Many advised against the name Shahid as its title because nobody watches a film with a Muslim title”\n\n“One person even suggested changing the protagonist's religion. Another suggested we change the ending - make it happy. Let the protagonist not die advised the director of a very, very successful film. The producer @sunil_s_bohra was unflinching in backing us. Well, Shahid does live on. Through a film called Shahid. Through the performance of an actor called @rajkummar_rao. Through the big deeds of his short life. And yes @mitchinder did not shoot the film. An early partin Govandi was shot by @nusratfjafri and most of the film was shot by @anujdhawan13 with little help from @miteshdop. @apurva_asrani edited the film. @castingchhabra helped cast some exceptional people including @mohdzeeshanayyub, #Baljinder @vipin.sta @itsshalinivatsa @vinraw and so many more. @kaykaymenon02 and #YusufHusain did the film pro bono. Apurva and I also became part of the writing/rewriting process. The film was not made by one person. It was some amazing people and blessings from an unknown force that made this film see light of day\" read the full note.\n\nBased on a true story, 'Shahid' revolves around Shahid Azmi and his family who are terrorised during the Bombay riots. The movie tracks Shahid's personal and professional journey from close quarters.\n\nHansal Mehta is currently busy with The Buckingham Murders, starring Kareena Kapoor in the lead role. Along with series Scam 2003."
