        "text": "Mumbai: When first teaser trailer of ‘Simran’ credited its leading lady as co-writer, the main writer Apurva Asrani dismayed over the ignorance to his ‘real’ contribution in the film. The problem soon changed into a raging controversy over the film’s writing credits. Director Hansal Mehta not just parted ways with his frequently collaborated writer-editor, but also accused him of damaging the film for publicity.\n\nAfter the series of explosive interviews by Kangana Ranaut, ‘Simran’ was expected to do great at the box office but it met to the mixed reviews from both critics and audiences alike. While everyone unanimously praised Kangana’s brilliant acting, the weak screenplay and convoluted second half was criticised. The film ultimately underperformed with the collection of 13 crores so far and is declared average at box-office.\n\nThe writer-editor recently posted his version of the film on Twitter by making ‘original’ script public – This latest move is getting divisive response from the people, as some are praising Asrani’s original work, while others are calling it as generic as the one made its way to the theatres.\n\n'Simran’ was released on September 15 along with Farhan Akhtar’s ‘Lucknow Central’. While the former trumps over the latter business wise, both films failed to make any significant mark on the box office."
