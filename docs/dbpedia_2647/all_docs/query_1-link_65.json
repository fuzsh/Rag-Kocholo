        "text": "The Queen of Bollywood Kangana Ranaut is known to be very particular about her films. But, has the actress got editor-writer Apurva Asrani sacked from her upcoming film Simran?\n\nWell, latest buzz suggests so! It was reported that Kanagana wasn’t very happy with the edit of Simran. So, filmmaker Hansal Mehta asked Apurva to discontinue.\n\nFurther reports suggest that the Rangoon actress is sitting on the edit herself.\n\nAlso Read: It’s a wrap for Kangana Ranaut starrer Simran, Hansal Mehta shares an adorable pic\n\nIn an interview with SpotboyE.com, Apurva Asrani confirmed the news of the termination of his services as an editor for Simran and said, “I continue to be the writer of the film but yes my services as an editor of the film have been terminated.”\n\n“I have edited almost the entire film except the final touch work in the last leg of the schedule. I haven’t spoken to Hansal till now but yes I won’t deny that I am not hurt as we have set up this collaboration 16 years back and have delivered some National Award winning work”, Apurva said.\n\nWhen asked if Kangana was the reason of this development , Apurva refused to comment and added, “Hansal stopped taking my calls a while back, especially after Mumbai Mirror’s article on Kangana sharing the credits as a writer for Simran.”"
