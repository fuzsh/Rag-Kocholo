Since awareness and support for mental health issues is sharply lacking in India, we chose the 'Mental Health Awareness Month' to make the announcement.\" Have a look at his tweet here :\n\nThe story of the film attempts to address the mental health issue and the film is likely to go on the floors by the end of this year.\n\nApurva is known for editing some of the critically acclaimed films like \"Shahid\", \"Children of War\", \"CityLights\", \"Aligarh\" among others.\n\nHe bagged the National award for the film \"Snip!\" in 2001.\n\nStay tuned to BollywoodLife for the latest scoops and updates from Bollywood, Hollywood, South, TV and Web-Series."
