        "text": "How difficult is film making as a business in India? Here is a statistics. If you go to Screen Writers Association in India, you can find these stats. Out of every 100 scripts that are registered (Ideas converted into scripts for execution) only 1 gets into production (the analysis of pre-movie making process begins). Out of 100 scripts that get in production only 1 gets made in an actual movie. Out of 50 movies that are made only 1 gets a proper release. Out of 250 movies that are roughly made in Hindi language (Bollywood) in India per year, only 4 to 5 are remembered by an average audience per year. There are independent regional film industries in India in each state (making hundreds in each state) in different regional languages, while Bollywood/ Hindi film industry is centered in Mumbai. Source - Varun Grover during one of his podcast interviews (quite an insightful panel with fellow stand up comics also all from IITs .. link in the comments), on his today's first directorial debut released film \"All India rank\", where he is also the director, script writer. Made on a budget of Rs 5 crore. The first draft was made in 2014 in terms of script and current film that is released which is 75% different than the original draft. Varun Grover is an accomplished lyricist, scriptwriters, actor, stand up comic, in Hindi film industry. The film is set in 90s when Varun himself an IIT graduate went through the IIT coaching process and expresses that journey as a semi-auto biographical concept. Indian Institute of Technology schools (IITs) are India's premier institute for technology for undergrad education that has a rigorous entrance exam with barely some 15 to 20k seats but hundreds of thousands students appearing for the exam to admission for undergraduate courses. I often compare startups with film making process, where the odds of success are many times highly against you as a newcomer. #filmmaking #movies #business #entrpreneurship #media #scriptwriting\n\nSo, this review of the new web-series called #HeeraMandi, available on #Netflix, is kind of special for me because it's been 12 years since I started writing for The Express Tribune. What began as a mere passion for expressing my views on entertainment and art has evolved into a journey of over 100 reviews on this platform alone. But let's set aside the sentimentality for now and dive into the intricacies of this web series review. On the whole, Heeramandi is one of the weakest series that is lethargically written by writers and dully performed by actors. It is a stretched affair that offers no entertainment but visually it is a magnum opus. There are many offs in the series, for instance the cast of the show is not relevant, the beautiful Urdu language is butchered, script is mediocre and direction is linier. Cinematic exposure to works like Bol, Pakeezah, Umrao Jan Ada, and Anarkali is necessary to find the sweet-spot in narrating a tale like this.

At the core of the problem is the lack of investment by Hindi film corporations and studios in writers and good scriptwriting. The Hindi industry will spend hundreds of crores on production and fees for top talent but does not want to pay young and emerging writers a few lakhs to develop a pool of good screenwriters. In regional cinema, writing and execution are given equal importance because producers' personal funding is at stake‚Äîit's not always somebody else's money. Producing is as much a creative job as is financing & execution. Audiences can sense good content and spend their time and money accordingly. The success of Hindi films like 12th Fail, Laapataa Ladies, and Munjya is proof of where the pot of gold lies. The solution & opportunity: Invest in writers and take risks with fresh stories & the rewards will come.\n\nAtul‚Äôs Song A Day is a site created from pure passion for songs. A unique site with not just lyrics, but the stories behind Hindi Film & Non-Film Songs. The site has covered over 18000 songs to date! I am subscribed to the site and it was a pleasant surprise to see a song from \"Bhairavi\", the first feature film that I worked on as an Assistant Director to Arunaraje Patil. The story behind the song brought back memories of the intense 50-days shooting schedule and my transformation from someone who stuttered giving the clap nervously on the first day of the shoot to confidently handling most of the departments by the end. A trial by fire that saw me learning everything about filmmaking from an excellent teacher - Arunaraje Patil. (Thank you, Aruna ji!) What helped was that there were only three assistants in the direcation department, and only two when the Chief Assistant fell ill and left in the middle of the schedule. I started off as the junior-most, but by the end of the gruelling schedule was practically the only Assistant Director left standing. I stayed through the editing and post-production and learnt from one film what many take a number of films to learn. Aruna ji's attention to detail across departments and preparation for every shot was one learning that has stayed with me through my work in television, film and PR. Her mastery of editing taught me a huge amount about structuring a narrative as everything I had read in Karel Reisz's Techinque of Film Editing came to life. Editing on the Steenbeck, not a single extra frame made it to the final cut. If you haven't read Arunaraje's autobiography, \"Freedom - My Story\", please do! (The shooting schedule also showed me the capacity of the human body to continue to function even when pushed beyond its limits. During the hectic shoot, there was no time to fall ill. I remember a fever coming on during a lunch break on an outdoor that lasted till the break ended :). But when the train from Bangalore pulled into VT station (as it was called then), I could feel my body give up and by the time I reached home, I was down with a high fever. Of course, I recovered in time for the edit that started in a week!) #filmmaking #directing #editing #storytelling #learningexperience\n\nRecently saw the movie Manjummel Boys, and my! It took my breath away. Quite literally. üò∂ I was told it was a classic survival thriller, but something about it was different from the rest thrillers, making me itch to watch it more! No need to say, I was on my sofa, opened Disney Hotstar, and started the film. Also, I am one of the cinematics who prefers watching films in the original language rather than dubbing. Just makes it all the more authentic to watch üòÜ (just my opinion, not shaming others!) Anyway, when I tell you that I did not expect the kind of movie this was going to turn out to be, I mean it! In many of the thriller movies, the climax of the film is usually foreshadowed with an eerie and apocalyptic score which rises nearing the peak of the film. And the audience grips itself waiting for it to happen. Not this film. No. Like in real life, where there is no background music to such harrowing moments, the movie puts the audience in the dark, not letting them know when and what will happen. And it was gut-wrenching yet fantastic at the same time! üëè Malayalam films are top-tier! And Manjummel Boys is just the tip of the iceberg! A must-watch! #post #manjummelboys #malayalamfilm #filmreview #writing #cinematic #contentwriting #mustread\n\nArousak (2016) Director: Reza Farahmand Duration: 60 minutes Genre: Documentary Synopsis: \"Arousak\" narrates the story of a middle-aged woman who intervenes in the relationship between a German girl and an Iranian boy. Leveraging her life experiences, she sows doubt in the girl about the strength of their relationship, which is based on \"Sighe\" (temporary marriage in Iran). The title \"Arousak,\" meaning both doll and puppet in Persian, metaphorically underscores the dynamics of control and influence within the narrative. My Role as Editor: I edited this documentary using Adobe Premiere Pro. Editing \"Arousak\" presented unique challenges, primarily because documentaries often lack a script, relying instead on real events, interviews, and raw footage. Crafting a compelling narrative arc from this material demanded significant creativity and technical skill. Without a script to guide me, I had to piece together a cohesive story that was engaging and true to the documentary‚Äôs essence. This required experimenting with various storytelling techniques to maintain the audience‚Äôs interest while staying true to the facts. The process was demanding but immensely rewarding, pushing my creative and technical boundaries. Ultimately, it resulted in a captivating film that transports audiences to another world, enriching both my professional and personal growth.\n\nI've knocked on the door of every production house in Mumbai, trying to pitch my story. It's been a long journey of 7 years and over 300+ rejections, but I still hold on to my belief. One day, I know my efforts will pay off. without any reference in Bollywood, you cannot pitch your story to a film production house or to a producer. All production houses provide email addresses on their official websites for pitching scripts. But the person who is appointed by the production house to read the script, he takes only the story of the people he knows.(his friends and his relatives) And he will give you that one simple answer. 1. \"Currently this not what we are looking for\" 2. \"We are not accepting unsolicited script\" 3. \"We have already lineups for movies same genre\" 4. \"Not interested\" 5. \"This not our genre\" 6. \"We are not accepting out side script\" XYZ......... But they don't think for even a second about how hard we worked on our story, and how our families are also hoping it will succeed. #changetheworld #bollywood #storytellers #dreamers #writers #struggling #pitching #story #nevergiveup #rejections #successstory #filmproduction #producers #contentwriters #scriptwriter\n\nüé¨ The Dilemmas of a Screenwriter ü§Ø As a Bharatiya screenwriter aspiring to make my mark in the Hindi Film Industry, I find myself caught in a fascinating conundrum. On one side, we witness senseless Bollywood movies raking in massive amounts of moolah. These films seem to defy all rules of screenplay writing, taking bizarre twists and turns that leave us wondering, \"Who are these people watching these movies?\" ü§î On the other hand, there's a world of screenplay writing books and gurus who dissect Hollywood classics, analyzing every element of storytelling with surgical precision. üìö‚úçÔ∏è The sad reality is that we often feel torn between these contrasting worlds. How do we balance the creative chaos of Bollywood with the structured brilliance of Hollywood? üåü In this journey, we, Bharatiya screenwriters, have a unique opportunity to bridge these gaps, infusing our storytelling with the richness of our culture and the wisdom of both worlds. üé≠ Let's embrace the challenge, break new ground, and create cinema that's not just entertaining but also thought-provoking. üìΩÔ∏è‚ú® #ScreenwriterDilemmas #BollywoodVsHollywood #BharatiyaCinema #StorytellingJourney üé•üåü"
