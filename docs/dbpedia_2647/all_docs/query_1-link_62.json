        "text": "Manoj Bajpayee will be reuniting with his Aligarh writer-editor Apurva Asrani for a film he will be co-producing. The actor has roped in Apurva as the director of the film. According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, the film will go on floors by the year-end with a completely bound script.\n\nIn an interview to the daily, Manoj Bajpayee said that he has always believed that Apurva has the qualities to direct a film and should have changed directions a long time ago. He said, \"It’s already too late in the day but as they say, better late than never. It will be an amazing experience to be working under his direction.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe writer-actor duo bonded during the making of Ram Gopal Varma’s Satya. Apurva revealed that after Manoj saw the edit of the film he suggested him to turn director. He said, \"So, I took a tissue paper and wrote on it that he would act in my first film and paid him Re 1 as a signing amount back in 1998.\"\n\nManoj said that they’ve been considering many ideas but when he suggested this one, Apurva was excited. Apurva said, \"It’s an emotional story of a forgotten genius who’s slowly losing his mind. The film attempts to understand if compassion and faith can reverse a mental illness.\"\n\nWhen did the idea of turning producer came to Manoj? The actor said that he thought about it when he hit a low, both physically and professionally, before Prakash Jha’s Raajneeti. He said, \"That’s when I realised that I couldn’t wait for people to come to me with good roles. I had to think up ideas myself and approach new filmmakers. There are three more films currently being scripted on subjects I suggested with three new directors. For this one, I thought of Apurva because it’s a difficult subject and with his sensitivity and sensibility, I think he can pull it off beautifully and intelligently.\"\n\nALSO READ | Manoj Bajpayee receives Padma Shri from President Ram Nath Kovind\n\nALSO READ | Manoj Bajpayee on his Padma Shri: No one has abused me for the award"
