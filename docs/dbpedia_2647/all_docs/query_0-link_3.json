        "text": "Just when Simran writer Apurva Asrani accused Kangana Ranaut of \"arm-twisting\" her way into getting an additional writing credit on the film, the writer of Shahid, Sameer Gautam Singh, accused Apurva of a similar thing. Sameeralleged in a Facebook post that Apurva browbeat director Hansal Mehta into giving him a screenplay credit and \"hijacked the credit and positioned himself as the writer.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nApurva took to Facebook to clarify , \"The director insisted on me getting an 'additional screenplay' credit. I did not demand it.\"\n\nIndiaToday.in got in touch with Shahid writer Sameer Gautam Singh, who said, \"He (Apurva) said Hansal sir willingly gave him the credit. Apurva was not even a part of the team when we started work, I was there. Hansal sir knows the struggles that I have gone through. Does it not sound absurd that he would rob a man who was there from the first day for no reason? Apurva is lying.\"\n\nAs for Apurva's claim that Hansal also \"chose to give himself an 'additional screenplay' credit,\" Sameer said, \"Hansal sir and I went to his bungalow near Lonavala for a month and worked on the script together. I was on the sets, constantly re-writing and improvising scenes. We did all the work. Apurva has been giving interviews claiming he is the co-writer of the film, but he never lifted a pen, he was never on the sets (of Shahid).\"\n\nBut Hansal had himself praised Apurva's contribution to the narrative in an interview with IndiaToday.in. Sameer clarified, \"Nobody is denying that Apurva did a fab job as an editor. But obviously, Hansal sir was not ready to give him an additional credit for screenwriting. That was forced.\"\n\n\"Apurva suggested that we show Shahid dying in the beginning. I did not agree. There are differences of opinion between people, but it's for the betterment of the film. That was the only departure from the script. But that's a suggestion. Everyone who works on a film gives inputs, but that doesn't mean that the director of photography can ask for a co-director credit,\" the writer said.\n\nApparently, even after the festival cut, Hansal wanted to keep working on Shahid and make it better. But Apurva refused to edit the film further unless he was given a screenplay credit, said Sameer. After several verbal altercations, Apurva got his way.\n\nSameer was unhappy about sharing his awards with Apurva. He asked, \"How can Apurva be shameless enough to stand on a podium and accept an award that wasn't his? If he is indeed the best editor in town, why didn't he get a nomination for editing?\"\n\nSlamming Apurva for calling Hansal spineless, Sameer said, \"His career was dead, Hansal sir was the one who gave it life, made him relevant again. Apurva was waiting for a moment to snatch the spotlight, but he did not realise he had skeletons in his closet that could come tumbling out.\"\n\nAsk him about the Simran row, and Sameer says, \"Whatever I have heard about Simran is already out there. Apurva tried but he's not a writer. Kangana and Hansal sir were not happy with it. A lot of the writing was actually done in the US.\"\n\nSameer had called Apurva a \"repeat offender.\" There were reports that Apurva had pulled off a credit-hijacking stunt during the making of Aligarh too. Apparently, Ishani Banerjee had written the film, but Apurva demanded that he get the credit. Sameer said, \"I was not a part of Aligarh, so I can only tell you what I have heard. Given his history, I would not be surprised. Even as an editor, he has taken credit for things he hasn't done. I know this because I have heard stories from editorial circles.\"\n\nALSO READ: Apurva Asrani slams Kangana for stealing credit, now Shahid writer claims he did the same\n\nadvertisement\n\nALSO READ: Simran writer Apurva Asrani slams Kangana Ranaut for 'lying' that she developed the script"
