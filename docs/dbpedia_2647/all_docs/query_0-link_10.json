        "text": "But all’s well that ends well – years later, the former whiz-kid got his groove back after he was called in from his hiatus by filmmaker Hansal Mehta to work on Shahid. Now the more sorted and still charming, Apurva is the proud writer and editor of Hansal’s Aligarh, which opens MAMI 2015.\n\n(Excerpts from my Q&A with Apurva below, you can watch the VIDEO or read through the TEXT version.)\n\nBy 19, I had done a whole bunch of films, and I was doing the promos of Daud, Ram Gopal Varma’s film and that’s where we met. And he was very excited by the spin on his material on the table. I was already in awe of him and so the opportunity to do the Daud promo was something I put a lot of effort into. Ramu and I really bonded during that period.\n\nWe used to hang out at Ramu’s apartment at Versova, there used be this durbar where vodka and whiskey flowed freely and everyone from the film including actors Manoj and Urmila used to hang out and discussions used to happen, Anurag used to write something, Saurabh used to write something, something would be shot the next day, we would review it. I used to him assist him on set.\n\nBut he gathered himself pretty quickly and it changed the way that scene was being shot, Sushant’s initial reaction was of anger when Satya slashes his face, but when we shot again, Sushant screamed like a little child, and fell down on the ground in horror, screaming and holding his face. That horror was real. That horror was the horror that everyone was feeling inside, that Ramu was feeling inside at that point of time.\n\nIt would be very arrogant of me to actually say that something went wrong with him. If you look at it, he’s still doing what he did then. He is still making films that he believes in. He can have the most outrageous idea and go make a film. He picks talent from no where and makes films with them. That’s what he did then, that’s what he’s doing now. If you ask him, I don’t think he knows, because he’s doing the exact same thing that he’s been doing.\n\nI did contact him, there was this whole phase where I had a career slump, where I was not getting much work and so I ate humble pie. So I went to him, I went his house, he invited me for lunch, I tried to get myself back to work with him, to edit for him but he was adamant that he would not repeat me or many of us.\n\nI mean, he liked me and I’m still extremely fond of him, but I couldn’t answer that. I have to admit I am one of those few editors who come out and say that I did this and I cut that because, I believe that editors are very unsung, editors and writers, they are capable of weaving a lot of magic and they have a very strong hand in putting together some great films. But we have this whole thing ki editor ko behind the scenes rehna chahiye. Why?\n\nThere was never a discussion about it. At that point of time, I was like, Anurag has never called me after Satya, now I am working on a film that he is producing. I always wondered, because Anurag had actually hugged my after Satya and said “Apu I want you to edit all my films, par tu nahin karega”, I said “Kyon?”, he said “Meri biwi edit karegi”. I used to be like damn! When I heard they had separated, I tried again, I said “Ab?”, he just laughed.\n\nHansal had very little money, he was putting his own money and getting some from Sunil Bohra and he would shoot a little bit, stop, shoot again, not know if he would ever shoot again. But at that time we kept ourselves excited by editing. Let’s try and do this with the cut, lets try and go in this direction, what if we don’t put this as the next scene, what if we cut out this sequence completely that you are planning to shoot, what if we create a sequence like this, so we would discuss it like that.\n\nWe would discuss those scenes which got written and eventually became part of the film. And now he had those scenes which he had to shoot. So it was built like that because we had those periods. And also, there would be scenes that I would just write there. There was more than just reshaping the film. I got a chance with Hansal and Sameer in actually writing scenes.\n\nHansal got an email from this young girl in Delhi who worked in a corporate job – Ishani Banerjee, she had seen Shahid and she was very moved by the film she sent him an email saying there is this case of this professor, I don’t know if you have heard about it but I really think you should make a film about it.\n\nBut they are both pretty much the same thing. Neither of them requires you to go on to set, working with actors and all of those things. There is a lot of imagination involved. Its very solitary. You’re taking ideas, thoughts, characters and you’re moving them around and you’re building narratives and you’re deciding how much is too much and how much is too less and whether this character is required or not required, whether you should say those lines, not say those lines, whether you should say anything at all. Where do I end the film, where do I begin the film, both give you the chance to do those things."
