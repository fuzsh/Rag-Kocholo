        "text": "National Award-winning film editor and screenplay writer Apurva Asrani is all set to make his solo directorial debut, which will feature actor Manoj Bajpayee. Apurva is known for editing some of the critically acclaimed films like \"Shahid\", \"Children of War\", \"CityLights\", \"Aligarh\" among others. He bagged the National award for the film \"Snip!\" in 2001. Apurva made announcement through social media.\n\nMaking the announcement on social media, Apurva wrote: \"Pleased to announce my solo directorial debut, co-produced by and starring my 'Satya' and 'Aligarh' star, Manoj Bajpayee.\n\nBox office collection: Avengers: Endgame crosses this milestone in Indian box office\n\nHe further wrote, \"Our script traces the emotional journey of a forgotten genius who is slowly losing his mind. Since awareness and support for mental health issues is sharply lacking in India, we chose the 'Mental Health Awareness Month' to make the announcement.\"\n\nThe film revolves around the mental health issue and the film is likely to go on the floors by the end of this year.\n\nAkshay Kumar shares Pic Sooryavanshi goes on floors, Simmba and Singham also gives company\n\nOn the workfront, Manoj Bajpayee was last seen in the dacoit drama Sonchiriya, which was highly appreciated and loved by his audiences. He will be seen in The Family Man and in a significant role in the titular role in Bhonsle that release later this year."
