        "text": "I don't talk about it much here, but I'm also an editor of fiction. I recently participated in a virtual seminar on literary editing for The Tennessee Williams & New Orleans Literary Festival. The festival asked me to list five things I wish writers knew about literary editors. Here are my five: 1. Professionalism counts: Read the submission guidelines before applying. More importantly, read the magazine thoroughly. Send the piece with a short cover letter of three to four sentences with a note of why you think we‚Äôre suitable for your story. 2. Understand that when editors say yes, they are taking a risk on you. There‚Äôs no risk in saying no, but editors are responsible for your work when they say yes. In the years I was at Guernica, I had to justify my choices to other editors. I was responsible for those stories to readers. So, respect the process. Wait longer than you‚Äôd like to hear from editors. Lower the risk by being cooperative and professional. You are in a partnership. 3. If your submission is rejected, be polite and professional, but submit a new story to that same magazine AGAIN. Don‚Äôt be afraid to do this. In my experience, when I was the fiction editor at Guernica, many people were rejected as much as three times before they were accepted. 4. Become a part of the community. Volunteer. Introduce yourself to editors and writers. Find editors on social media and comment on their posts. Go to readings. Start readings in your community. Buy books at author readings‚Äîeven better, preorder their books. Do other writers favors. Read their stories. Start your own magazine. Do all of this because it‚Äôs easy to tell which writers are fully committed lifers and which are just passing through. Committed lifers tend to succeed; daytrippers rely on luck. 5. Editors are just people looking to publish stories. They have a quota to meet (a certain number of stories to publish), so they want to like your work. If they reject your story, though? Know that rejections can come from reasons you can‚Äôt control, such as your story being too similar in subject matter to another one the magazine already published. Also‚Äîthis is just a theory‚Äîbut I think the longer a magazine is in business, the more inertia there is in the process regarding new writers. In short: Don‚Äôt assume rejection is a comment on your worth as a writer. Just keep writing and submitting. Writers are the best, but getting where you want to be requires a thick skin. Editors are (usually) also writers. It comes to this: We know how difficult the process can be‚Äîand we‚Äôre not out to get you. #publishingtips #literaryfiction\n\nAs an aspiring filmmaker in India, I was always discouraged from taking up screenwriting as a specialization. You'd get a lot of \"you won't get hired that often\" and \"there is nothing to learn in screenwriting\" from people. I went ahead and specialized in screenwriting anyway at Northwestern University. Fun two years where I was exposed to a very structural and methodical approach to writing and creativity. When I returned to India and started working in the industry, the quality of scripts - even from some of well established, high paying screenwriters baffled me. The craft of writing in India was severely missing. People had good ideas, good settings, good stories but terrible scripts. They were poorly structured, conceptualized, and written. Film is a subjective medium, no doubt. But within the realm of subjectivity, there's scope for craft building. Subjectivity should never be the excuse for mediocrity. The state of writing in India isn't surprising. People often write because they \"have to, to make a film\". The knowledge required for this is often acquired during your gig. So if you're surrounded by some great creatives, that's a win; if you aren't, tough luck. Writers come from diverse career backgrounds in the country. So despite having diverse stories to tell, their storytelling is often safe and often not engaging. The land of stories lacks good storytellers. I shared the frustration about the state and infrastructure of writing and writers with Anshulika Dubey, who at that time was just starting this wonderful initiative with INK Global Foundation, with support from Ford Foundation and Netflix. The Writers INK Institute was designed to be a screenwriting lab specifically for skill building. The aim was not just to make sure good projects come out of the lab, but good writers. This year I had the privilege of joining this initiative as their Program Manager and hope to take the initiative forward to bigger and braver directions in the coming years. Applications for this year's lab is open now. Apply!\n\nWhat is the role of ethics in Media Production? The role of ethics in media production is paramount for maintaining credibility and integrity in storytelling. Ethical considerations encompass accuracy, fairness, transparency, and responsibility, ensuring that information is presented truthfully and respectfully to audiences. In today's digital age, where misinformation spreads rapidly, ethical media production serves as a safeguard against manipulation and bias. By adhering to ethical standards, media professionals uphold public trust and contribute to a more informed and empowered society. Nowhere is this more applicable than in the realm of screenwriting and content creation. Screenwriting is not only a form of creative expression it is also a rite of passage and comes with a certain degree of responsibility. What kind of story concepts can we as screenwriters create that would shine a light on issues that are relevant to the community while being entertaining‚Ä¶? Why is it harder to raise funds for movies that have characters who are real and relatable and not over the top caricatures? Case in point being the action hero walking in slow motion towards the camera while something blows up in the background spreading across the screen in a ball of fire - which only serve to tickle our fantasy rather than make us feel and think‚Ä¶.?! ü§î #ethics #media #production #indiefilms #producer #screenwriting #stories #scripts #crossovermovies #Indiancinema #films #webseries #CharacterActress #TVSerials #characterartist #dakbungalowfilms #FeatureFilms #Acting #IndianTelevision #Drama #Comedy #Thriller\n\nLooking for scriptwriters! ‚úç This project has been a longstanding dream of mine. Currently I am looking for scriptwriters who would like to join the writers' circle. Answering some of the questions posed by those who have already seen this advert: 1. Do you need experience? It would be great if you do have screenwriting experiences. However, if you're a fiction writer in general with amazing ideas and loves to watch TV shows, that is sufficient too! I am looking for more passion than years and years of experience tbh. So, do send the work that you have completed along with your CV! 2. Is it paid? Yes, it is. However, this is not a monthly paying gig. The pre-production will take six months and the entire payment will be given at the end of it or broken into two portions on a three month basis. 3. Is it full-time? No, it's not. After the writer pool is finalised, we will be working on selected weekends and after working hours, depending on everyone's availability. 4. What are the exact positions available? Currently we have one to two positions for assistant executive writer, about three positions for staff writers. 5. What is the project? It is a TV show. Do apply and see! Once everyone is shortlisted, we can have a chat :) #filmmaking #scriptwriting #tvwriting #srilanka\n\nWhy do fiction writers feel inspired to collaborate on the Havilland Storyline?

Then you will want to know well what genre your writing falls under. Editors often have specialties. For instance, I edit literary fiction, memoir, general nonfiction, academic writing, and dystopian/apocalyptic fiction, which is a subgenre of science fiction. While I have read widely and enjoy other genres, such as romance, detective, mystery, and some fantasy works, I don't consider myself an expert in those genres and thus do not offer my editing services for such works. As a writer, it's helpful that you know what genre you are working in because an editor will want to know what your work is trying to be. If you are writing horror, but it contains mostly elements of comedy and romance, then maybe you are mislabeling your genre. They will be very different works, and an editor may not read your work in the spirit in which it was written. When the main characters descend into the dark basement and an unveiling of hearts and a love scene takes place, an editor who thinks she is editing horror may comment: \"the tradition of the horror genre is that the protagonist discovers something horrific and disturbing in the dark basement, not everlasting love. Consider revising for adherence to genre tropes.\" Readers have certain expectations when they read genre fiction. That's why they read it. Genres do cross-pollinate, however, and rarely is a work purely one genre. Mystery, thriller, and detective works overlap quite a bit, as do thriller and horror, or mystery and horror. Literary fiction can be all over the board too, from the highly philosophical to the highly metaphysical to the highly realistic depiction of contemporary life. If you have difficulty naming the genre you are writing, an editor can help you label your work appropriately. But remember, labels are only valuable insofar as they help you and readers to understand your work. Great novels often defy genre conventions. Take care of your writing, and the genre will take care of itself. = = = üé∏ I'm Lee G.

However I want to congratulate all the writers and Adam Conover at Writers Guild of America West who have continued to see this 146 day strike through! A deal is currently being made between the WGA and Hollywood. Keep standing up for your God given talent! Studios want blueprints to a Box office return, nothing more. That is how they see your writing talent! This is all your movie script is to them, a mere blueprint. They want your creative mind and writing abilities, (something that many of them do not posses) for their next vacation in Hawaii. They expect to pay you peanuts in return. The same can similarly be said in Journalism today. If a screenplay is merely a blueprint or transcript of a movie (or play), then why did we cover the tragedies of Shakespeare in school? Moreover the works of modern playwrights such as, Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible\", or Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett's, \"The Diary of Anne Frank\". These were physically printed in my English & Grammar textbooks throughout grade school! Why? Because a script is a literary composition, within its own format. A screenplay is no different than a poem or novel. It's a story, moreover, an artistic medium, seeking to take the reader somewhere. To experience something, they might never be able to experience in real life. A screenplay is a writer being transparent with you about their inner emotions. Studios cannot function without their writers. Without a screenwriter or playwright, they have no story. They have nothing new to create. As we have seen in the writer's strike. Why? They're not creative. In the words of, screenwriter, director, filmmaker, and editor, Robert Rodriguez, ‚ÄúStart with a screenplay. (Do you know how to write?) No? Good. Everyone else writes the same way. Start writing your way. That makes you unique. You can take writing classes, that‚Äôs good. But don‚Äôt bother to go to film school. Or you‚Äôll be making films like everyone else. You want to see a new film? How do you write a script?‚Ä¶Just make a screenplay for a movie you can actually make... What you need to learn is that being creative is not enough in this business. You have to become technical. Creative people are born creative. You‚Äôre lucky. Technical people however can never be creative. It‚Äôs something they‚Äôll never get. You can‚Äôt buy and find it? Study it. You‚Äôre born with it. Too many creative people don‚Äôt want to learn how to be technical, so what happens? They become dependent on technical people. Become technical you can learn that. Be creative and technical, you‚Äôre unstoppable‚Ä¶\" Maybe it's time for screenwriter's to go further. Learn the technical side of Hollywood. Cut the middle man out, and you'll have a bigger return. After all that is what the Elite Studios are trying to do with screenwriters. Even to the point of proposing A.I. to write for us? Why not give them a taste of their own medicine.\n\nWriter Diaries... All the best writers I know are going home. You, on the train station, bags packed, rankling and bruised. You have all the bitterness of a failed love affair, your affair with this city, with the film industry. You're wondering how you're going to ask your parents that you need their help, once again. I'm here to tell you it is not your fault. Producer says Indian screenwriters are not up to the mark. I ask, dear producer, are your executives looking outside established networks? Because I've read some of the best scripts of my life in this past year and they were all by Indians who wanted to experiment. Producer says, this is a business transaction. How can I pay for a script I don't want to make? I ask, dear producer, why do you not pay for the scripts you do want to make? The free outlines that cut your development cost. The shows commissioned for six months that get cancelled in three. You do pay for your actor's entourage to have a great time on your set. Does that cost ever show on screen? Producer says, this is a business, dear. Yes, dear Sir. What is the building block of your product? A tightly bound script. How much did the film industry make this year? 10,000Cr Gross. I want to ask you how much of that is going to writers? 0.00001%? Writer wants dignity. Rent. Food. The ability to pay for your parents to have a decent vacation. Humari bhi responsibilities hai. Why are we all juggling three jobs? None of them are going to pay us on time, if they pay us at all. So I don't blame you, dear writer for saying goodbye to all this shit. I'm so angry that you had to go home because your place is here. I know you are an investment that will not blow immediately, but will eventually burst forth like a Fortune 500 stock. I'm sorry nobody had the foresight to invest long-term. I'm sorry that nobody understood the dignity of your labour. I will find a way to bring you back. Are you angry? Share your story so we know that we are not alone."
