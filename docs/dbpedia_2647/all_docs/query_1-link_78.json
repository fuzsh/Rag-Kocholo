        "text": "Three years ago, Manoj Bajpayee and Apurva Asrani created magic on screen with Aligarh. And now, the two are teaming up once again. According to reports, the writer-editor of Aligarh is making his directorial debut with a film starring Manoj Bajpayee in the lead. The actor said that he always believed in Asrani’s strength and that he should have changed his direction long back. He said that it is late in the day but better late than never and that it will be an amazing experience working under Asrani’s direction.\n\nAsrani, who is also co-producing the film, will roll by the end of 2019. He said that it is an emotional story of a forgotten genius who's slowly losing his mind. He said that the film attempts to understand if compassion and faith can reverse a mental illness.\n\nAsrani revealed during a media interaction that Bajpayee was the first person who suggested that he should turn a director after he saw his editing on Ram Gopal Varma’s Satya. Asrani also revealed that way back in 1998, he took a tissue paper and signed Bajpayee to star in his first film, paying him Rs 1 as signing amount.\n\nBajpayee was last seen in Abhishek Chaubey's Sonchiriya, co-starring Sushant Singh Rajput, Bhumi Pednekar, Ranvir Shorey and Ashutosh Rana in key roles. This year, the actor was also honoured with India's fourth highest civilian honor Padma Shri for his contributions to the field of art.\n\n2018 also saw many of Bajpayee's releases including Milap Zaveri's Satyameva Jayate, Devashish Makhija's Bhonsle, Dipesh Jain's Gali Guleiyan, Neeraj Pandey's Aiyaary and Ahmed Khan's Baaghi 2."
