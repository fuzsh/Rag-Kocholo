        "text": "First of all I’d like to say that I have honestly no idea how to make a game, so we ALL thank and appreciate the work the DEVS go to creating titles for us to enjoy, however as we are all Forza fans on here, some constructive feedback about Forza Motorsport is well needed for its longevity and future - especially after it won “game of the year” which a lot of fans are puzzled as to why it won including myself.\n\nDevs - What is going on with Forza Motorsport?\n\nThe whole redesign of the game format has been disappointing. From the “ground breaking” AI we race to the car modification system and lack of diversity of events and things to do in the game, oh and the downgrade in graphics we all received once the game was released as well and are still experiencing. (I’m using a 3080 graphics card).\n\nThe events and other stuff to do within the game:\n\nThe builders cup is unexciting and I don’t feel the want/need to even complete the series.\n\nThe lack of diversity of the events and races also contributes to my above point. There is no cool and quirky events to do. All there is to do constantly is practice laps and then a race which due to the terribly performing AI makes and repetitiveness of the events, makes it bland and very mundane.\n\nI highly suggest to add events like;\n\nA GYMKHANA style event\n\nSomething like the coffee cup breaks in Grand Turismo\n\nDrifting events\n\nDrag racing events\n\nEvents suited more towards specific cars such as a TOUGE style event with Japanese cars, F1 style safety car events/response vehicle events - even though this is not ‘racing’ it’ll be great to have something other than practice laps and races in the game for events and things to do.\n\nAdding Licenses would add another interesting and challenging layer within the game. (Such as a normal car license, GT track license, F1 license, response car license, truck license, etc. There is literally less content in this game than ANY other Forza game that has been released.\n\nDitch the car point system and go back to focusing on driver XP\n\nMany of the players feel that the new car upgrade progression system is just a way to get us to play the game more. This system should be ditched and you should go back to being able to spend money on upgrading cars just like in Forza Horizon. Instead of using the car point system to level up cars.\n\nI highly recommend using this system to gain driver XP instead.\n\nIn addition to this, you need to bring back the rewards just like in Forza Motorsport for leveling up your driver. You need the ability to chose a reward - credits, a car or a racing suit and I don’t understand why this was removed.\n\nI also highly recommend bringing back the race mod cards that you could purchase and use within races to earn more credits, XP. (Please whatever you do DONT add the car upgrade progressions system to the new Forza Horizon that is currently in development).\n\nThe car sounds need a complete overhaul\n\nThe car sounds are just not up to a standard and financial budget that Turn 10 studios have to be able to create a game. Take The Crew Motorfest for example. There is proper backfire, turbo sounds, engine sounds, gear box farts, overrun, etc.\n\nThe car sound wont even change when you add a custom exhaust just like in Horizon 5 and I’m struggling to understand why audio wasn’t focused on when the game was in development.\n\nThe AI need an update or overhaul\n\nWhen the game was in development, the Developers of the game were emphasizing how ‘ground breaking’ the AI was.\n\nThe AI has nothing but accidents in EVERY first corner of every racet\n\nThey crash into you or crash themselves in the silliest ways and just simply can’t drive very well at all.\n\nForza Motorsport 7 AI was better than the AI in this game unfortunately.\n\nThe assets in the game and the graphics\n\nWhen screenshots were released of the game while it was in development looked absolutely amazing and it was hyped up to the moon, however once the game was release, the game failed to deliver on graphics - amazing sunsets, lots of grass assets, visual air affects, reflections and I hate to mention it, the puddle effects in Forza Motorsport 7 were much better.\n\nThere is NO Auction House\n\nWhy is there no auction house? This doesnt make sense and this is a disappointment that it’s not in the game. I don’t think this needs much of an explanation.\n\nLack of real life racing suits\n\nForza Motorsport 7 did this perfectly. It needs to be brought back. All you get are Turn 10 studios produced racing suits which aren’t realistic or exciting.\n\nI’m sorry to say but this game DOES NOT deserve the ‘game of the year award’. This game existing in its current state is damaging to Turn 10 financially and to the Forza Motorsport game. Take the reviews of the game for example on Steam, the Microsoft store and Xbox store, they are all negative - its what the community really thinks about the game and this has lead to the player count in a 24 hour period being 1K players for Steam. Freaking Need for Speed Unbound has DOUBLE the players that this game does. I have been a huge Forza fan ever since Horizon 3 dropped which made me stop playing Grand Turismo completely and switch Forza Horizon and Motorsport as it use to offer more than what Polyphony Digital and any other studio could offer at the time (FH5 still does). At the current state of this game, I personally will be uninstalling it and moving to Grand Turismo 7. I purchased the premium edition of the game for about $150 AUD and I do not think this game was worth what I purchased it for due to the many bugs/glitches, bland and boring events and things to do throughout the game, terrible lighting and graphics and non diverse and not updated car choice.\n\nI think what i’m trying to say is that Forza Motorsport, lacks diversity, soul and character and i think that this is ‘just another racing game’. I don’t know about you but i would’ve happily waited another year for the game to release if was polished more rather than be in the state that it was when It was released.\n\nNote: This is my opinion and you might feel differently and or disagree with me so please keep comments on this post respectful towards Turn 10 Studios and myself as I’m simply voicing my opinion."
