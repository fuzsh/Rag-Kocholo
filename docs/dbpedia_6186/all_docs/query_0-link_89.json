        "text": "21 photos\n\nPhoto: Xbox Game Studios\n\nAfter a very rocky launch and seven updates, the folks over at video game developer Turn 10 are burning the midnight oil, trying to fix their flagship title with incremental updates almost every month. On Steam, Forza Motorsport has frozen in time and space with a 40% User Score. It's only gone up 2% since the beginning of 2024. It makes you wonder if there's any point.\n\nWhile Xbox's Gran Turismo 7 rival doesn't seem to have even a remote chance to catch up with Polyphony Digital's behemoth racing game, at least the team is doing their best to recuperate the damage done from the October 2023 release.\n\nLast month, Turn 10 released Update 6, which saw improvements in vital areas like Car Progression. Before, you couldn't install certain car parts on the car you wanted unless you put in the hours and leveled that car up to the developer's unreasonable expectations. Luckily, you can now do so regardless of your car level.\n\nSome other fixes and improvements also followed, which were warranted, given that the game was buggy at launch. Sometimes, the track underneath your car simply disappeared for no reason, so we're not just talking about minor bugs.\n\nIn the recent Update 7, things got even better. The first item on the list is the \"Brands Hatch\" new track, a welcomed addition. It's pretty famous in Europe because of its fast straights, tight corners, and elevation changes, which will put your driving skills to the test. Forza Motorsport converted Brands Hatch into a Grand Prix and Indy circuit because why not?\n\nPhoto: Xbox Game Studios\n\nThe Retro Racer Tour is a compelling mode involving racing legendary vehicles like the 1981 Ford #2 Zakspeed Racing Capri Turbo, the 1969 Lola #10 Simoniz Special T163, the 1967 Brabham BT24, or the 1988 Jaguar #1 Jaguar Racing XJR-9. If you complete the required challenges, you will be rewarded with the 1977 Renault #15 Equipe Renault Elf R.S. 01.\n\nDon't forget about the 1975 BMW #25 BMW Motorsport 3.0 CSL from Multiplayer and Rivals. There are new additions each week in the Multiplayer mode, so remember to log in weekly. The Open Tour is all about the 1960s. After completing the E, D, C, and B classes, you will unlock the 1964 Brabham BT8.\n\nLastly, Car Pass holders get the 2019 Ginetta G55 GT4, the 1970 Matra-Simca #146 Equipe Matra-Simca MS650 Tour de France, and the 2016 Ligier #11 Euro international JS P3.\n\nUpdate 7 will stay around for five weeks before Update 8 will be deployed sometime in the middle of May. In the meantime, let's hope that Sony's superior racing game will finally greet the PC platform for the first time in its 27-year history.\n\nThe PS5 Pro is reportedly coming out this fall and is rumored to have some wicked ray-tracing skills. Hopefully, we'll also get a tuned version of Gran Turismo 7, with real-time ray-traced reflections and global illumination during actual gameplay, not just in some glorified slideshow."
