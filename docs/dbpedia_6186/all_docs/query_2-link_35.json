Have in mind that even though this is a list of some of the most outstanding driving games it is far from a chart and they are not in a particular order, just our picks for impressive racing titles in gaming, but in order to qualify for our list, the entrees would need to have any of the following features: exciting tracks, awesome cars, cool multiplayer modes, options to be played with peripherals and of course to be available on the list of Steam games.\n\nSo, get ready and start your engine, because this one is going to be a long drive with lots of intense moments and high-speed routes! There will be many drags, chases, and races all throughout, so be sure to arrive with the best gear and focus! Ready! Set! GO!\n\nForza Horizon 4 [2018]\n\nDeveloper: Turn 10 Studios | Publisher: Microsoft Game Studios\n\nPublished on Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, Xbox Series X and Series S\n\nWe are starting our list with Forza Horizon 4, which has so many great qualities that it could easily be one of the best arcade racing games of all time. The visual graphics are simply magnificent and the open-world scenic environments are created to depict a combination merge between Edinburgh and the Lake District, both places being a home of some of the highest-quality roads in the United Kingdom.\n\nLike in most of the best Forza games, the selection of cars is quite huge and every one of them has a custom set of improvement options, what is new to Forza Horizon 4 are the whole-body kits designed after the realistic model versions.\n\nThis entry in the Forza series was a total hit regardless of the bits of negativity around its release, the multiplayer mode was team-based, so it was not possible to reach the victory alone and it all depended on how well your team performed during the race.\n\nAnother cool feature for this particular title was the game's second expansion, which was created in a partnership with LEGO. Players were able to drive around a re-modeled environment styled in LEGO-fied versions of real-life cars, such as the game's cover car - the McLaren Senna.\n\nForza Motorsport [2005 - 2023]\n\nDeveloper: Turn 10 Studios | Publisher: Microsoft Studios\n\nPublished on Xbox Cloud Gaming, Xbox Series X and Series S, Microsoft Windows\n\nStaying on track with Forza game titles, we should definitely mention one more and it may be a bit surprising that the first game in a series would outrank a game a couple of generations ahead of it, but just like it was the case with some of the other original and initial franchise entries such as for example Gran Turismo, the first ever Forza Motorsport game was actually incredibly good for the time it was made in.\n\nEven though it got released all the way back on the original Xbox, the reception was full of glaring and there were tons of rave reviews praising the game about its steadily increasing difficulty level and appealing gameplay. Forza Motorsport was rather accessible for players to enjoy even the ones that were new to the genre but also managed to deliver some harder tracks for the more experienced audience.\n\nAnother really well received aspect was the dynamic soundtrack and this turned out to be a major selling point not only for this initial entry in the Forza series but also for the first three Forza Motorsport games as a whole. It was later reinvented in the Forza Horizon series as the main point of the game's theme, which was based on an imaginary festival in the Australian outback titled Horizon; this all eventually turned into a Forza brand of its very own.\n\nBurnout 3: Takedown [2004]\n\nDeveloper: Criterion Games | Publisher: EA Games\n\nPublished on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, Xbox\n\nBurnout 3 is referred as one of the best driving games of all time even though it heavily restricted the options to customize your vehicle and did not focus on creating a realistic handling experience. It is still a leading title that racing game fans have a special place for in their hearts and souls.\n\nBurnout 3: Takedown brings the complete package of great visual graphics, gameplay that would keep you glued to the screen for days and an awesome soundtrack, we can definitely say it brings us many incredible memories because this type of games is not something that is produced often these days.\n\nCriterion games used to create and compile their own soundtracks, but it all changed when they started working with EA, allowing them to incorporate licensed music from popular bands, thus boosting further the action-fueled craze, paired with an extra-aggressive gameplay experience that made Burnout 3 to be much more about the violence on the road than racing - players could fight their way through the civilian traffic as opposed to race through it. The main objectives became to knockout and eliminate the other opponent drivers into a huge crash that leads to their oblivion and to this way rush your body full of crunchy adrenaline.\n\nThis more intense and action-driven concept became such an inspirational theme for racing games of the future that it later created titles such as Blur and Split/Second: Velocity.\n\nGran Turismo [1997]\n\nDeveloper: Polys Entertainment | Publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nPublished on PlayStation 1\n\nHere it comes, another titan that could easily be the number one racing game of all time... the original in the Gran Turismo series. If you were around for the original PlayStation era, this was the game to put your skills to the ultimate driving test.\n\nThe five-year-long development cycle time was absolutely worth the wait as it was quite revolutionary for its period. The concepts Gran Turismo introduced were so new and rich for its time that you could actually play it on and on for a number of hours and still not get bored or exhausted at all.\n\nAs a franchise, it is one of the longest running titles in the racing games genre right next to the likes of the Need for Speed series with each next title raising the bar higher with great new graphics, more new cars to drive and experience and updates to make the AI opponents even more challenging.\n\nComing with two different modes - Arcade and Simulation - the original Gran Turismo features 140 cars to choose from and 11 different tracks to race on with them.\n\nArcade mode gives you much more freedom of choice about the car and course which you could use in order to unlock even more vehicles and locations as a reward. Simulation mode on the other hand was focused around getting various drivers’ license types so that you are able to enter certain events and is more championship based – you could say that this was the game's career mode of sorts.\n\nTrials Evolution: Gold Edition [2012]\n\nDeveloper: Redlynx | Publisher: Ubisoft\n\nPublished on Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360\n\nLet us turn to something else now, on bikes with two wheels to be more specific, next on our list comes the Trials Evolution: Gold Edition, which marks the grand coming to the PC gaming platform for the Trials franchise. As one of RedLynx’s most popular franchises, the Trials series made its first more significant hit in the games industry with the release of Trials 2 SE on the PC back in 2008.\n\nThat indie breakout later led to even further success on the Xbox platform, but ever since it arrived on PC, gamers have been on the lookout for more of the same and Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is what they had been waiting for so long. So, the time has come to rise to the challenges, beat the clock and yourself while performing some awesome tricks at the same time!\n\nThe Gold Edition is actually two Trial games merged in one; it contains all of the content from the original, best-selling XBLA game Trials Evolution. In addition to that, all of the single player tracks and skill challenges from Trials HD could be found in Trials Evolution – in effect doubling the amount of content offering players with two complete games in one, neither of which has actually ever before been accessible for the PC gamers.\n\nTrials Evolution: Gold Edition is fully optimized and enhanced to the maximum for the PC. All of the amazing features of its forerunners – from the in-game editor, player sharing of tracks, and global Leader Boards are going to be integrated into the game in a way that fits the new platform perfectly. There is no way around it, if you have not yet tried this entry, then it is surely time to do so as soon as possible!\n\nColin McRae Rally 2.0 [2000]\n\nDeveloper: Codemasters | Publisher: Codemasters / Ubisoft\n\nPublished on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 1, Game Boy Advance\n\nThe classic Colin McRae games are somewhat now having a life of their own in the vast shadow of the popular DiRT Rally games franchise, but back in the days when the release of Colin McRae Rally 2.0 on the original PlayStation 1 was the thing, it had a splendid reception with both critics and players at the same time because of the realistic graphics and damage effects the vehicles were getting, with perhaps the single downside of the game having difficult tracks that players had trouble mastering to perfection, since it does have a reputation of being quite tedious and demanding in this regard.\n\nIt is however a commonality with this type of off-road rally gaming titles though, as they are notorious for being quite a bit more merciless when compared to other racing games based on the streets and professional tracks. When speaking about tracks, CMR2 has 8 different ones to master based in countries all around the world, with the option to have a go at them during different weather conditions and time of day. You are able to race on these with a decent selection of 22 real-life car models with a detailed system for fine-tuning your vehicle stats according to the environment and levels.\n\nComing strong as the second installment in the Colin McRae game series its release was far from having no rivals, but maybe the most notable competitor was Gran Turismo 2, which actually released a year earlier in 1999.\n\nAnd in case you are feeling a bit of a nostalgia for this classic title but do not have a working PlayStation 1, Codemasters have released a remake version of CMR2 with a variety of improvements in 2013, which is available on Steam, Android, and iOS.\n\nForza Horizon 5 [2021]\n\nDeveloper: Turn 10 Studios / Playground Games | Publisher: Xbox Game Studios\n\nPublished on Xbox Series X and Series S, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, Xbox Cloud Gaming, GeForce Now\n\nFor the next entry we got Forza Horizon 5 simply because it absolutely delivers on an impressive racing game journey with incredibly fast speeds and intense experience. Forza Horizon 5 offers players an array of fantastic locations for players to race on with the beautiful selection of supercars from various prestigious manufacturers from around the globe.\n\nForza Horizon 5 has visually stunning graphics and effects, which comes as no surprise, adding greatly to the excitement as players manage to go through the various obstacles, avoid traffic, and surpass the cars of their opponents on the motorways.\n\nYour next Ultimate Horizon Adventure awaits you! Get to explore the lively and picturesque landscapes of Mexico while driving in some of the world’s greatest car models ever in deserts, lush jungles, old cities, secret ruins, beach coastlines, wide canyons and even a volcano in various weather conditions and settings.\n\nImmerse yourself in the complex campaign containing tons of challenges each of them coming with a reward for engaging in the activities you love. Meet with and go against new characters and then choose the possible outcomes of their missions in this Horizon Story.\n\nPlay together with other players and enter the Horizon Arcade, create your own tracks with the new EventLab gameplay toolset that would allow you to make custom races, challenges, stunts, and even completely new game modes. You are able to customize your cars in a lot more ways with new options such as the feature to open and close convertible tops, paint different details, and so many more.\n\nForza Motorsport 7 [2017]\n\nDeveloper: Turn 10 Studios | Publisher: Microsoft Studios\n\nPublished on Microsoft Windows, Xbox One\n\nThere is definitely space for one last Forza entry on our list, since if you are into racing games just for the pure kicks and thrills of the race, then surely Forza Motorsport 7 is the right racing game for you.

To keep things compact we would have to pick just one entry and our choice came down to Need for speed Heat – an exciting racing experience that puts you up against a city’s corrupt police force all the while you are doing your best to get into the elite ranks of street racing. In Need for Speed Heat you would need to hustle hard throughout the day and put it all on the line at night, when the lines of the law get kind of blurry as the sun starts to set. All of the action takes place in Palm City, which is the host of the Speedhunter Showdown, a sanctioned competition where you can earn big money in order to customize and improve your collection of high-performance cars.\n\nAt night, drive up the intensity by taking active part in illegal street races that can build your reputation, allowing you access to higher-stake races and better parts.

The game effectively simulates almost all real-life cars it features including the likes of Ferrari Mercedes, Porsche, Koenigsegg, Lamborghini, Pininfarina, Bugatti, Hennessey, Aston Martin, Rimac Nevera, Pagani, McLaren, Nissan and many more.\n\nEach of the cars in the game has a beautiful and stylish design and powerful stats that allow for high-speed action on the highly-detailed racetracks, providing a mesmerizing show of speed.\n\nTest Drive Unlimited Solar Crown [2024]\n\nDeveloper: KT Racing | Publisher: Nacon\n\nTo be published on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S, Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Windows Expected release date: September 12, 2024\n\nLast but most certainly not least with over a decade since the last installment comes one upcoming title, we would like to steer your focus to –Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown. Test Drive seems to be partaking in an entirely different race, set in Hong Kong, the game is centered entirely around the Solar Crown competition, a challenge for drivers from all over the world to prove themselves as the ultimate Solar Champion. You have a single very simple aim – to be the very best possible as well as a simple path ahead to do it – drive as fast as you can!\n\nThe driving experience in Test Drive would certainly not fail expectations circulating around it as it is described as fun, immersive, and even a bit silly at times but also grounded whenever necessary because of its commitment to realistic car design and controls.\n\nSo far, the preview build has teased plenty of dealerships, races, and diverse events that would be accessible when the game gets released to market but rumors are that it would not be that easy to unlock new cars and parts like it may be in other titles on our list, but the invested efforts into reaching new unlockables would certainly feel as worth and much more rewarding it once you get there!\n\nIt is clear from developer talks and commentary that the driving and role-playing experience were thought of as equally responsible for the game’s ‘fun’ factor and appeal. Another major factor that the game boasts is the one-to-one accurate replication of the Hong Kong area the action takes place in, so if you have never been there then this could pose a great opportunity to try out the roads digitally since after all video games present a wonderful option to escape reality a bit! One thing is for sure though; we cannot wait to see it available on the list of Steam games.\n\nWow! What a ride this was!\n\nWe could probably have a massive blast with so much horsepower packed in one article and hopefully you agree with our picks for Best Driving Games of All Time! Do you think we missed any major franchise or a favorite you would have liked to see on the list?\n\nThe world of racing Steam games is so vast and covers so much ground it would simply be impossible to encapsulate into a list of just 15 entries, so perhaps in the future we would extend our list with a second part for it, so if you have any suggestions that we should add, do not hesitate to send us a message and let us know about it!\n\nAs always, we ask you to stay tuned for more important news in gaming coming from us in the very near future, because there are lots of interesting things to come ahead!"
