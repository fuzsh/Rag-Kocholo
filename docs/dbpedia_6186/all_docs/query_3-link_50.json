        "text": "@Maddie47 I agree that 'Compatible' isn't quite the right word here as the game itself isn't running on the XB1 hardware - but that doesn't stop Gamers from being able to 'access' and 'play' the game on an XB1 - and more likely to be a 'better' experience than 'Native' would offer.\n\nAs I said, I agree the game itself is NOT compatible with XB1 hardware so pointless even considering 'buying' if you only have an XB1. But at least XB1 gamers have an option to play that isn't costing at least several hundred to get the hardware to play it, don't have to upgrade or miss out.\n\n@Maddie47 As I said, I agree that 'Compatible' is a bit misleading but if you do have Game Pass Ultimate, then you can play Forza Motorsport using your XB1.\n\nWhilst the game isn't running locally, its still using the HDMI out to display the game and your XB1 controller too. The 'Only' difference is where the game is actually running and as I stated before, the game itself isn't 'Compatible', but you don't have to miss out or upgrade to play on an XB1.\n\nIt is still accessible and playable through XB1 hardware, viewed and controlled the same as 'local' running games so in essence, its not too dissimilar.\n\nThe main issue I have with the word compatible is that it makes it seem as though you could buy the game and it would work on an XB1. Its 'only' accessible/playable on XB1 through streaming and, if MS removes it from cloud, it would no longer be accessible/playable, and certainly 'not' Compatible to buy.\n\nI agreed with you that Compatible was NOT the right word but if you do have Ultimate, then it is playable on an XB1, just not 'locally' but you can still access and play it.\n\nThe XB1 is 'compatible' with Xbox Cloud but not the Game itself. You cannot go and buy Forza and expect it to 'work' on an XB1 console because the two are not Compatible.\n\nBecause the game is accessible on Cloud and the XB1 is 'compatible' with Xbox Cloud, then you can access and play any 'Cloud' enabled games whilst they 'remain' on that service but as soon as it leaves Game Pass Cloud, even if it remains on Game Pass to 'download' to play, it no longer can be played on an XB1 because the game itself has no 'compatible' version for that Hardware.\n\nSo in my mind, Forza Motorsport is NOT compatible with XB1 but is still playable/accessible on XB1 because the XB1 is Compatible with MS's Xbox Cloud gaming service - which just so happens to have Forza added to it for the 'forseeable' future.\n\nMy only issue with the Headline is that it does make it seem like Forza is Compatible with the Hardware which may lead to someone purchasing thinking it would work. I would perhaps swap 'Compatible' with Playable/accessible on XB1 thanks to Game Pass Cloud Compatibility with the Hardware - as @Moonglow points out, not all hardware is 'compatible' with Xbox Cloud (XB360, PS3/4/5, Switch etc) although other devices, inc Mobiles, Samsung TV's, Laptops, Handheld Tablets/PC's etc are ALL compatible with Game Pass Cloud, even if the Hardware can't run the game on its hardware locally..."
