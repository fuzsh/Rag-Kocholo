Come connect with us. And if you’re ever in downtown Redmond, stop by our studio to check out some of Forza’s past cover cars in our lobby collection. We’re right next door to our colleagues at the 343 Industries & Minecraft studios, and stop-bys are welcome during normal business hours. Come late enough in the day, and who knows, maybe afterwards you can catch up with some of our folks relaxing at one of the neighborhood brew pubs after hours. We can chat about all things Forza!\n\nWebsite\n\nhttps://turn10studios.com/\n\nExternal link for Turn 10 Studios\n\nIndustry\n\nComputer Games\n\nCompany size\n\n201-500 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nRedmond, Washington\n\nType\n\nPublic Company\n\nFounded\n\n2001"
