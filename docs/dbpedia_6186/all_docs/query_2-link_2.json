        "text": "I find myself wishing that Playground Games would talk over production of the Motorsport Series. With their past game releases it seems that they have kicked Turn10 down to 2nd or 3rd place as developers.\n\nOr at least have the 2 studios work together if Motorsport is just to big for 1 developer!\n\nYou watched credits? It lists PG multiple times… There is an extra “Special Thanks to Playground Games” section.\n\nThe bigger joke is the complete outsourced stuff…\n\nGerman translation lists 3 people but whole game feels like “Bing translate”\n\nOr all the tester listed… start the game and u see how they tested\n\nI think you missed the part where Horizon 5 came out and it was quite literally Horizon 4 ported to a new map with less features and cars, It was also unplayable for many people (including myself).\n\nThey have made progress, particularly in the last year. But allow me to point you to the first year that was basically as dry as the current state of Motorsport. They touted features that were no more than facades, IE: Evolving world. They bungled partnerships. Re released the same DLC, Then released an inauthentic DLC based on a motorsport discipline(the map was good). They’ve had more than their fair share of terrible development. And even with the current state of motorsport, I still think T10 probably has retained marginally more actual car people than PGG.\n\nUltimately, While they are providing some decent content now. I’d actually imagine T10 changing more on Motorsport in the same 2 year time. At least I very much hope so. For their own sake, if anything.\n\nI don’t know what you’re talking about. Turn 10 was created by Microsoft period, playground was created by 3 dudes who then pitched an open world forza game to turn 10 who were looking to expand on the forza franchise.\n\nTurn 10 would not exist without being created by Microsoft and playground games wasnt created to make horizon but certainly won the lottery by having as much success as theyve had with horizon. They are a talented group of people with a lot of pedigree in racing games so they deserve the accolades, but they were smart to team up with that Microsoft money and turn 10s assets.\n\nThats exactly why you create your own studio,\n\nis the hope that you can create your idea. People leave studios all the time and do things like this. They were formed in 2009 and made a deal with turn 10 in 2010. Gavin Raeburn, one of the 3 that started playground left and started a new studio, mike brown just left playground last year to do the same. This is what they do, it might work out it might not.\n\nI don’t know where youre distance and tax theory comes in, or what information you’ve uncovered that’s not available to anyone else because ive not seen anything like that. But it sounds like you went a little too deep down this rabbit hole."
