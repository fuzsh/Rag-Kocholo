        "text": "Forza Horizon is not Forza Motorsport 4. Horizon is a vast, open world version of the popular racing series. It takes place in Colorado, on the roads and freeways, not on the track like the previous games. In Horizon, the player will drive across the map, exploring the roads, racing against other competitors while building fame. Fame is used as a leveling system, and allows the player to rank up, unlocking new races and events.\n\nFor returning Forza fans, Horizon differs in a few key ways from 4. The handling of the cars has changed, to make it more appealing to the casual crowd. Simulation driving has been turned down just a notch, to provide a more laid back feel. Drifting, sliding, and general crazy driving has been brought to the forefront. Penalties no longer exist, and crashing into some stuff is even encouraged. However, the game has new draws, previously unseen in Forza. Day and Night now cycle, allowing players to view their cars in varying conditions, and traffic makes an appearance on almost every road, making for interesting last minute dodges to avoid crashing.\n\nHorizon comes with its own car list, that has been trimmed down from Forza 4. Since this game takes place at a racing festival, the cars are geared more towards ones you would find at such an event. Casual cars, ones not typically used in racing, have been stripped from the roster, with an aim at focusing the game on fast, fun and powerful racing machines. The cars still handle like the real world versions, although unlike the previous installments, the tuning options have been brought back to more simplistic, pick up and play style.\n\nHorizon is an open world game, so instead of just selecting tracks like previous entries in Forza, the player drives across the map to locations. Races make up the bulk of the experience, but there are other optional things the player can do. Barn Finds pop up and allow the player to hunt down a barn that is housing a rare car. Sponsor Challenges exist to entice the player into risky driving. Drifts, high speeds, close calls, all reward the player with points, allowing them to level up a Fame meter."
