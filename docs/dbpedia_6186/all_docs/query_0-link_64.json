        "text": "The next Forza Motorsport is just around the corner here we have the update program for its live cycle. Below you have the video. Further down, we leave you with the article published last week about the game’s features.\n\nForza Motorsport will expand with new cars, tracks, career tours and online events. Here’s how we’re building an evolving racing platform to give players a steady flow of new challenges and gameplay experiences.\n\nForza Motorsport launches on October 10 with over 500 cars, 20 completely rebuilt tracks and our new career and online racing modes. It’s a massive game from day one and it’ll continue to grow over time.\n\nWe want to ensure you always have something new to play in Forza Motorsport . That’s why we built the game to be an evolving racing platform. Once the game has been released, we expect to regularly add new content with monthly content drops that will help you fall in love with cars through skill and competition, as well as tweaks to gameplay and systems.\n\nTracks\n\nNew free tracks will be coming to Forza Motorsport on a regular basis, introducing new challenges for you and your friends to master. Due to the extensive development timeline required to accurately rebuild these detailed environments to work with our new physics systems, our monthly updates may not always include a new track. With that said, we are excited to reveal that Yas Marina – completely rebuilt using the latest track layout – is coming in November with Update 2.0. The updated circuit features a more flowing hairpin allowing for better racing and overtaking opportunities.\n\nWe do have another track planned for December that we will show you soon, and as previously revealed, our most accurate Nordschleife ever will be released in Spring 2024. Every new track we add to Forza Motorsport will include fully dynamic 24-hour time-of-day with weather and track evolution.\n\nNew cars, career tours, online events, and limited-time Rivals will be introduced to Forza Motorsport, and these will arrive through our monthly updates.\n\nForza Motorsport will introduce new cars in a variety of ways. Some will be released directly into the Showroom and can be acquired with in-game credits. Others are unlocked as rewards for completing the Featured Tour or Open Tour. There will also be a new Car Pass car introduced every week until Car Pass is complete.\n\nLive Events\n\nLive events in Forza Motorsport include Featured Tours in Career Mode, Spec Series and Open Series in Featured Multiplayer, and Featured Rivals. These events will spotlight new cars obtainable from the Showroom at a 30% discount for a limited time.\n\nFeatured Tours\n\nFeatured Tours are limited-time career events organized around themes. The first of these is the Track Tour, showcasing different varieties of cars built for competition on the track. Each week there will be a new series of races featuring different types of track cars, including that week’s Spotlight car.\n\nThese series do not have to be completed in a particular week – you have until 2 weeks after the end of the entire tour to complete it; this gives players more flexibility to enjoy the content at their own pace.\n\nHere are the weekly series and Spotlight cars that you will get to experience in this initial Featured Tour:\n\nFeatured Tour Spotlight Car Availability Track Day 2022 Subaru BRZ October 5 Built to Race 2020 KTM X-Bow GT2 October 12 Track Exotics 2014 Ferrari FXX K October 19 Prototype Power 2019 Ginetta #6 Team LNT Ginetta G60-LT-P1 October 26\n\nPlayers who complete all 4 series within the Featured Tour will unlock a Showcase event. Regardless of where you place in the series, the reward car is yours upon completion. For October, this will be the new-to-Motorsport 2020 Acura #6 ARX-05 DPi.\n\nThere is also an Open Tour with four PI class series – C Class, B Class, A Class, and S Class – and these will be refreshed with new content and a new theme every month. The first Open Tour celebrates German manufacturers and completing all four series unlocks a new reward car.\n\nOne more note about Career Mode and its live content – no matter where you finish in a race or series, you will always progress to the next event or series. Be it first or last place, or somewhere in-between, we want you to race your way. There are also no restrictions on car builds, car level or driver level to play any of the content in the game including our live events.\n\nFeatured Multiplayer\n\nFeatured Multiplayer includes both Spec Series and Open Series.\n\nSpec Series events use pre-tuned cars to ensure players are competitive with one another, while Open Series events allow you to bring the car of your choice within that class.\n\nSome Spec Series are available long-term, such as the Qualifier Series for new players, and our highly competitive Forza Touring Car and Forza GT racing divisions.\n\nThese online events are a great place to meet new friends in our community, level up cars, and build skills together through competition. Here’s a look at the calendar of Featured Multiplayer events to be cycled in and out in the weeks after launch:\n\nSpec Series Open Class Series Spotlight Series Availability GTX Sportscar Series R Class Series October 5 Formula Mazda Spec Series A Class Series 2020 KTM X-Bow GT2 October 12 Early LMP Series C Class Series 2016 Porsche 911 GT3 RS October 19 Early Factory Racecar Series P Class Series 2019 Ginetta #6 Team LNT Ginetta G60-LT-P1 October 26\n\nFeatured Rivals\n\nHere’s a look at the calendar of Featured Rivals events available in the first month of Forza Motorsport:\n\nRivals Event Car Track Availability Welcome to Forza Motorsport 2024 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray Maple Valley – Full Circuit October 5 *Welcome VIPs! 2020 Corvette Stingray Coupe Forza Edition Laguna Seca – Full Circuit October 5 Spotlight – Subaru BRZ 2022 Subaru BRZ VIR – South Circuit October 5 Spotlight – KTM X-Bow GT2 2020 KTM X-Bow GT2 Road America – Full Circuit October 12 Spotlight – Ferrari FXX K 2014 Ferrari FXX K Mugello – Full Circuit October 19 Victory Lap 2023 No. 01 Cadillac Racing V-Series.R Hakone – GP Circuit October 19 Spotlight – Ginetta #6 G60 2019 Ginetta #6 Team LNT Ginetta G60-LT-P1 Spa – Full Circuit October 26\n\n*VIP Rivals events require VIP Membership, available in the Premium Edition or Premium Add-Ons Bundle, sold separately.\n\nRivals will challenge you to reach your best lap time, and feature leaderboards so you can track how you stack up against your friends, others in your region, and the world.\n\nIn addition to Featured Rivals, you can always set your fastest lap time on our leaderboards using a custom tuned car on your favorite tracks in Time Attack.
