        "text": "forza motorsports\n\nthe video game Forza Motorsports has some serious issue's with its A.I. i keep getting run off the track by other players yet i keep getting the penalties the game is a total waste of time and money\n\nDate of experience : March 13, 2024\n\nBad product\n\nBad product. Loosing data, can not submit ticket, & no ability to contact. I'd give 0 stars if possible. Every time you try to submit a ticket, it makes you sign into MS, forwards to TURN10 & recycles same procedure over & over. Crash/freeze/data loss/slow loading/white screen/no profile recognition. Everything in the book, PURE GARBAGE MICROSOFT/TURN10\n\nDate of experience : January 25, 2024\n\nGreedy and lazy trash development\n\nGreedy and lazy trash development. Kids 8-14yrs of age is there main focus making children's games that play and look like **** and cost over $100. Own up to this monumental **** up and apologise and fix your game or refund and close down forever you are officially one of the worst now and always will be haha good job turn 10\n\nDate of experience : November 15, 2023\n\nWaiting 16 days for Support for in-game…\n\nWaiting 16 days for Support for in-game problem, unable to type letter/numbers from UPPER LETTERS 1 onwards in create vinyl groups for my cars. Everything else works great. If, as I suspect this is a \"game bug\" seeing how new Motorsport is, at least I should get a notification of it?! As bad as PlayStation Support, once they got your money, no one cares!\n\nDate of experience : October 28, 2023\n\nWhat even is this game\n\nWhat even is this game? I'm typing this while still waiting in the intermission to join an online race for the last 10 mins? Constantly kicked from the server after Qualifying, Selecting a livery, or just crashing on launch.\n\nPenalty system is still embarrassing, Handling is worse, And even after typing this my race still hasn't started.\n\nImagine sitting on a title for this long and just serving your embarrassing crap to customers. I've been trying since launch day to be patient with this game, but what is the point?\n\nDate of experience : November 03, 2023\n\nApparently a 1st Party Dev... Lol\n\nConstant crashing on Forza motorsport, hanging on upgrades, random crashing, caching on every start up. It would be comical if it wasn't infuriating. Look at 1st party Sony titles and you can understand why MS has resorted to anti consumer practices like buying entire publishers. I only leave this review because Forza Motorsport is my favourite racing game since Drive Club on PS4, but the fact I have so much down time btwn crashes and caching to leave reviews like this speaks volumes. F+(K u I want a refund on my season pass.\n\nDate of experience : October 21, 2023\n\nLied about Motorsport being 'rebuilt…\n\nLied about Motorsport being 'rebuilt from the ground up' and released a game too buggy to be seriously playable. I have been a keen Forza Fan since the first version. So this is hugely disappointing. Ended up canceling my Gamepass as this was the only game I was really passionate about. Maybe they will get the chance to fix it, but their silence on all the issues now is telling.\n\nDate of experience : November 21, 2023\n\nI enjoyed herpes more than this\n\nHave released a game that is less developed than a bag of soft stool samples. Honestly, what inbred cumsock of a person thought this game was in any way shape or form ready for someone to play and enjoy. I would rather eat a yard of poo than attempt to play this game in its current form. This is enshittification of Forza.\n\nDate of experience : October 27, 2023\n\nForza motorsport online sucks at the moment.\n\nThe online racing in your latest title is f***ing awful. The penalties don't work. I constantly get smashed or spun out or I get a penalty. Sort your f***ing game out. Spent 2 years boasting about improved ai a d penalty system when really it's a load of S***\n\nDate of experience : October 14, 2023\n\nThe game has gone down hill.\n\nThe game has gone down hill.\n\nWas a brilliant friendly game, but now turned into appalling game full of cheating glitching and ramming.\n\nNobody knows how to race without ramming or cheating.\n\nThe game is full of bugs and 80per cent not fixed.\n\nCustomer service as much use as a chocolate fire guard.\n\nDo not hardly respond and make it awkward as possible to report stuff.\n\nGame crashes and scoring is not accurate.\n\nNot worth money unless you want a severe headache.\n\nEven playground games when you report to head office your accused of spamming.\n\nNo interest in anything but making money.\n\nDate of experience : October 17, 2021\n\nForza Horizon 3\n\nbeautiful game with excellent physics, soundeffects and more than enough options for doing. doesn't take that long to get a few million CR. i got 3,5 million CR in 5 days of playing only an hour a day. you can adjust everything you want to make it harder or more easy. you don't HAVE to do something either, u can do whatever u want. also, i bought the VIP Membership wich has double loot in wheelspins, extra cars, like the Pagani Zonda R, wich is my favorite car. i also got Hot Wheels and Blizzard Mountain, wich u definitly got to check out, CAUSE ITS WORTH IT!\n\nThank you for this beutiful game!\n\nDate of experience : May 04, 2021\n\nso i decided to play this game again…\n\nso i decided to play this game again but thats kinda impossible since the only lobby i can get into theres a player afk named POWEROFJSUS\n\ncant join friends, cant play, cant have fun, cant join sessions, disconnected from servers when i try to join\n\nthanks turn10 im uninstalling your crappy game\n\nDate of experience : March 13, 2019\n\nCostum free Lobby settings\n\nThe only thing i hate in these new games is that the multyplayer is so boring... and the most i hate about the \"forza horizon 4\" is that you can't make a costum free lobby and setting changes in your costum free lobby like in forza horizon 1 and motorsports 4. I'm waiting years and still nothing 😔\n\nDate of experience : May 05, 2020\n\nTURN 10 STUDIOS if your going to make a…\n\nTURN 10 STUDIOS if your going to make a game the put the time and effort into it before u bloody well release the game. FORZA HORIZON 5 crap. Iv paid £90 for the full game and have my car pass but u make exclusive cars that can only be earned. You quick on taking people money for the game just not giving them what they want. Make Forza better otherwise I can see TURN 10 going down hill very fast. Forza was a good game to play till you messed it all up and releasing glitchin games. Oh and another thing car release dates if they say the date then release them on that date not the next day.\n\nDate of experience : April 29, 2022\n\nWorst Customer service ever\n\nWorst Customer service ever. I tried to dispute a banned account and they took weeks to reply. I stopped after 3 weeks of waiting. Bought a new account/game copy and i couldnt play online. I disputed why i cant access online, they said an account associated with my pc was banned. Told them i tried disputing that years ago and they never replied. They basically said oh well. ask them idc about that account, Im talking about my new one. I havent done anything and they said yeah we cant do nothing. go over to reddit and people said they have been unshadow banned.\n\nDate of experience : June 14, 2020\n\nMy game save become corrupt\n\nMy game save become corrupt, locally and server-side. Contacted the support desk, who told me to reset my entire FH4 progress, I lost everything. However, they did state initially that they would compensate me with some rare cars, wheelspins and clothing items, etc. After over a month, of sending emails back and forth, they did not compensate me whatsoever. And, I was left with an account that I could no longer use. I had to start from scratch in a new account. They are the most useless company I have ever come across for support, They are quick to ban people, but as for problems with the game, well you may as well give up before you start.\n\nDate of experience : April 14, 2021"
