        "text": "Problem is despite the back to back failures, they keep on promoting the people at the top who are ultimately responsible: how are people like Alan Hartman and Matt Booty getting additional responsibilities when they've already shown themselves incapable of managing the ones already on their plate? It's not fair that rank and file devs with bags of talent get laid off while the buffoons in charge keep screwing up and get rewarded regardless.\n\nThere is a skeleton of a great game here but it's been wrecked by mismanagement.\n\nAgreed, and the \"just wait for\".....(Insert Perfect Dark, Avowed, Fable, etc) just doesn't fly anymore. Yes I know there is a dev video next week. There were dev videos for Halo, and Forza, and Starfield, and Sea of Thieves and....... I don't think i was ever an obnoxious Xbox fan constantly preaching to others, but I did fully support them with my money and time with multiple version of each consoles, games, accessories. I was a damn beta tester for Xbox live and still have my beta test kit. To have to relegate that to the side for PS5 and Switch hurts. I know it shouldnt and its stupid.....but it does.\n\nAgreed, and the \"just wait for\".....(Insert Perfect Dark, Avowed, Fable, etc) just doesn't fly anymore.

I was a damn beta tester for Xbox live and still have my beta test kit. To have to relegate that to the side for PS5 and Switch hurts. I know it shouldnt and its stupid.....but it does.\n\nI don't want to give up just yet as like you I have too much money invested in the Xbox ecosystem (I got an OG Xbox on launch), even if I am not convinced that those at the very top can up their game.\n\nIt's weird that Forza has gotten to the point where Horizon has become the lead for the franchise.\n\nI'd argue that's been the case since FH1 at the earliest, FH3 at the latest. That's a 12 to 8 years ago range, so not recent and around half of Xbox's life potentially.\n\nThat's nice and all, but there's still giant issues I have with this game not mentioned which is the incredibly dull single player mode, it being devoid of any creativity or personality with the presentation (wtf happened after FM3 and 4?), and the lack of different modes like drag racing and drifting. I don't see how this game will ever not be just a giant disappointment and let down to me as a fan since 2005 of the series.\n\nDrifting and drag racing doesn't have any interest to me personally, but, I think the bigger issue is that the core track/\"featured\" racing they have gone with doesn't offer anything beyond 3-5 lap races regardless of classes or career progression.\n\nPrior games had short/medium/long races and actual showcases/scenarios, and in some cases, relevant Achievements too. Even the Achievements in FM8 are mostly incredibly easy and have been done 6/7 times already by this point (share a tune, share a replay, share a pic etc) - there isn't even an Achievement for completing the sparse racing series that don't change on a weekly/monthly basis.\n\nI love Forza and have since the first one.... this whole release after being without a new game for so many years is just such a massive letdown. It feels like 2 years ago they said \"Oh shit we need to start working on this\" and either started work or rebooted it... while the racing feels good which is important every other thing around that that made Forza special to me is missing. I just do not understand the choices made at every step on this game.\n\nI keep going back to see if I am missing something and it just never fully clicks and never feels like a Forza game. This statement from Turn 10 does nothing for me as far as making me excited to come back to the game. I hope there is some sorta of Halo like turn around but we are a long ways from that point and Turn 10 seems to be stuck in mud lately so who knows.\n\nIt helps that Horizon5 have many point to point races where you won't get turn 1 pileup and there aren't 24 cars on track.\n\nI don't see how point-to-point races solves the problem of a turn 1 pileup, it's not like you don't still have a first turn that everyone's driving into; the only thing I can think of is that sometimes the point-to-point routes have a longer stretch of mostly straight road before that first turn, which can help stretch out the pack, but there's nothing inherent about a point-to-point race that would cause this. In general, Horizon does show some funkiness with the AI racers in turn 1 but it's usually not quite as bad as what I see in Motorsport. Subsequent laps in Motorsport don't have the same pileup issue either because by that point the pack has stretched out and the AIs can negotiate each other's positions better.\n\nThe lower number of competitors does seem like it would help Horizon, yeah. Maybe a controversial opinion: if having 24 competitors on a track is the problem, cut it in half and go back to the way it was in 7. To me it would be the difference between a playable game and an unplayable game. I don't really give a shit about having 12 more AI drivers to deal with (it's not like I miss them in Horizon or previous Forzas), and I feel like you can keep the 24-car grids in multiplayer if people would miss it there.\n\nObviously people have brought up the game-specific issues, but I also think Forza is a bit of a victim of the polarisation of racing games. It feels like every game on the market is trying to fit into one of these three concepts:\n\nAn iRacing-like (this includes Forza, GT, and the F1 games as well as the other PC sims; common thoroughfares are being online focused at the expense of single-player content, repeated online races structured to start at specific times and split by driving skill and a safety ranking, the most popular races all being in race cars and the most popular of those being in a GT3-level class, tracks are all real life or if they are fictional then they are to real life track standards, in-depth penalty systems, having a laser focus on the racing and simulation as opposed to any fun/fluffy extras or side modes),\n\nA Forza Horizon-like, or\n\nA Mario Kart-like.\n\nEven without the launch issues, I just don't know how you stand out from the crowd as a new racing game in 2023-24 when there's so much similarity out there.\n\nI don't see how point-to-point races solves the problem of a turn 1 pileup, it's not like you don't still have a first turn that everyone's driving into; the only thing I can think of is that sometimes the point-to-point routes have a longer stretch of mostly straight road before that first turn, which can help stretch out the pack, but there's nothing inherent about a point-to-point race that would cause this.

Admittedly I didn't play this Forza that much because of all of the issues mentioned in this thread really, but most of the races I did do were only like 3-5 laps depending on track length. It feels kind of weird having that many cars while also having such a short amount of laps, because it just encourages more aggressive playstyles to move up in places.\n\nWhat does that even mean?\n\nI kinda get what they mean. The career mode for example felt like it kind of had no personality to it. Very dry. Even GT7 which also has kind of a poor single player, had some personality with the menus, and the dialogue from the bar owner from what I remember.\n\nI get they wanted to make the game feel a bit more serious with the practice laps, and going into the main races but I'm sure they could have done something instead of it just feeling like you're clicking through screens/menus while listening to a kind of dull voice over.\n\nI'm reminded of the latest Grid, which isn't a direct comparison since it's a bit more arcadey really, but the career was about you being on a team going up the ladder. It was incredibly cheesy, but man it gave it personality and made me remember it you know, haha.\n\nObviously people have brought up the game-specific issues, but I also think Forza is a bit of a victim of the polarisation of racing games.
