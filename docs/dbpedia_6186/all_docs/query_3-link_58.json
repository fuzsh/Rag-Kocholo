        "text": "When was the Forza Motorsport 8 release date? The latest main series game in the hyper-realistic racer is kitted out with new gadgets. There’s even a brand new single-player mode that introduces would-be tinkerers to the art of car-building.\n\nThe developers at Turn 10 Studios talk a big game regarding the improvements made to every one of its racing games, and the Forza Motorsport reboot, also referred to as Forza Motorsport 8, is no exception. With so much new stuff introduced to the eighth game in the Motorsport series, we pop the bonnet and take a peek inside to see what makes this racer tick and when the Forza Motorsport 8 release date was.\n\nForza Motorsport 8 release date\n\nThe Forza Motorsport 8 release date was Tuesday, October 10, 2023, at 12:01am local time, when the Microsoft game was released to PC and Xbox Series X/S.\n\nForza Motorsport 8 gameplay\n\nOn launch, Forza Motorsport 8 featured over 500 cars to collect, race, and customize. There are also more than 800 unique upgrades. Of these vehicles, 100 will be brand new to the series and feature among them “the most modern race cars we’ve ever featured on our roster”, according to Gabe Garcia, Vehicle Art Director at Turn 10 Studios. Moreover, you can race them across 20 different environments that constantly change depending on the weather.\n\nNew to the series is a single-player career mode that delves deep into modifying your ride to perform the best it can in any race. Take a look at our Forza Motorsport review to see just what we think of this new feature.\n\nAs racing is a brutal sport at times, the physics engine needs constant upgrading, and the advancements in the physics model are greater than Forza Motorsport 5, 6, and 7 combined. In addition, materials and shaders are built with ray tracing in mind, with natural light responses on the paint, with dirt accumulation and paint chipping reflecting better what happens in the game. It will also support a native 4K resolution and ray tracing, running at 60fps on Xbox Series X, so these settings are achievable on higher-end PCs as well.\n\nForza Motorsport 8 is natively compatible with Windows Sonic and Dolby Atmos. The re-recorded library will give you a vast range of sounds, including those of any upgrades. If you ride a car with a turbo, this makes a distinctive sound in real life; that sound is in Forza Motorsport 8. Regional track announcers and tire and suspension audio improvements also help with immersion, as do new Forza Motorsport features such as dynamic type-of-day weather systems and lighting tweaks.\n\nForza Motorsport 8 track list\n\nA total of 20 tracks were released with Forza Motorsport on launch day, with more added in the following months. Some of these Forza Motorsport tracks are familiar to racing fans and series veterans, while others are brand-new courses never seen before in the series.\n\nWill Forza Motorsport 8 be on Game Pass?\n\nAs this is a game from a Microsoft first-party studio, Forza Motorsport 8 is from day one on Game Pass."
