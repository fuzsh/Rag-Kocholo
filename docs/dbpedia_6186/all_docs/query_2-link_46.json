The Crew Motorfest aims to answer this question. The new thing from Ubisoft – which arrives today on PlayStation, Xbox and PC – is a mix between an arcade driving game and the large open worlds to which the French company has already accustomed us. Hundreds of cars to choose from to explore the main island of the Hawaiian archipelago: O’ahu. As in the Force Horizon – saga in which it has always been inspired The Crew – one of the main attractions of the game is driving freely through the open world. And go from the ash slope of a volcano, to the paradisiacal beaches of O’ahu, to the humid and lush jungle or to the streets of crowded Honolulu. All this choosing from more than 600 vehicles with options dating back to the 1950s. Read also Marc Brugat Content The Crew Motorfest is organized in playlists. There are 15 available at launch, but Ubisoft plans to release more throughout Season 1. Each playlist It is a small themed campaign and upon completion the player is rewarded with a unique vehicle. When entering one of these specific matches, not only do the vehicles change, but the island of O’ahu is adapted and decked out for the occasion. In the Made in Japan playlistFor example, Honolulu is filled with neon and in the Lamborghini campaign the island adopts a more Italian aesthetic. But the most interesting game mode is Vintage Garagewhich invites players to explore the evolution of cars between the 50s and the 90s. In this playlist, the gameplay adapts to the technology of the time so be prepared to drive without ABS or power steering. In addition, GPS did not exist, so orientation in races is based on photographs and maps.
