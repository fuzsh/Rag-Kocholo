        "text": "In the 8th generation racing games became a niche genre.\n\nThey had been a staple game for a long time, and one of the major genres since the 5th generation, because racing games tend to make for great tech demos and are easier to make look good on 3D systems because computer graphics simulate the look of cars much better and more easily than they do organic life forms, and since they tend to have limited mechanics and physics interactions.\n\nDevelopers have gotten much better at making graphics look good, and complex gameplay is the norm, so racing games don't stand out the way they used to and consumer interest has dropped. Now we have a few \"major\" legacy series, some indie or semi-indie stuff, and some specialty developers who make games for the remaining niche audience.\n\nAll that is to say that the reason we're not getting games like Blur or Motorstorm or Split/Second anymore is because racing just isn't what it once was. Gran Turismo and Forza have their audience, and the Dirt and Dirt Rally games and WRC games and such have their audience, and of course there's Mario Kart, but everything else is pretty small time.\n\nUbisoft tried to make The Crew happen. It didn't.\n\nEA kept producing Need for Speed games because it has been a major franchise for them and maybe they're still profitable with microtransactions, but they have not made a splash.\n\nDrive Club opened its doors. Nobody wanted to be a member.\n\nSo what was good about 8th generation racing? Forza Horizon was the biggest and most important series for mainstream gamers, and the Forza Horizon games are my favorite racing games ever, so that was nice. The Dirt games were pretty good for people who like rally style stuff. Mario Kart was good. There was some good even more niche stuff, even if it wasn't as polished as the big budget games used to be.\n\nWhat was bad? The absence of racing games, and especially creative racing games. Sonic Team Racing tried to do something new, but the vast majority of games that weren't little indies were either pitched right up the middle or were simulators. There was no real attempt at evolving the genre or doing weird or interesting things like Burnout or Split/Second used to. The genre is stagnant and shrinking and it needs a fighting game style renaissance.\n\nI think the Forza Horizon series is basically the only racing series to appear in the Giant Bomb personal game of the year lists for the last generation. What does that tell you? Nothing good.\n\n@gtxforza: I don't know why you would expect the 8th gen to be like the 90s. Racing games had clearly moved to a different model by the time the 7th gen was coming to an end. What I didn't expect was how much the genre would shrink after that and how low the quality of high budget racers would be. Think about how many disappointing racing mainstream racing games came out in the 8th gen. Most of the Need for Speeds. Both The Crews. Driveclub. Even Gran Turismo, while liked by many, wasn't a full entry.\n\nForza Horizon is the only series that consistently put out highly acclaimed and popular games during the whole gen, and if it wasn't only on Xbox it would be the biggest franchise in the genre right now. It already reviews better than the other stuff and has more media buzz.\n\nThere are lots of arcade racers popping up these days but they're either bare bones (Sonic Team Racing) or lower budget affairs. You have true indies like Hot Shot Racing and Horizon Chase Turbo and you have smaller games from actual publishers like Overpass and Gravel, but just not a lot of big budget affairs.\n\nI don't really think Dirt 5 is a love letter to Sega Rally or Motorstorm or Shox: Rally reinvented, which is a very obscure title. It's just an arcadey rally game. It doesn't have the thin tracks or slidey physics of Sega Rally and it doesn't have the 'tude of Motorstorm. It's fine or what it is but I think it's just a Dirt game made more arcadey as an attempt to make it more commercially viable and to differentiate from the more sim based Dirt Rally series.\n\nI will say that Dirt 5 has the best visual weather effects I've ever seen in a racing game. So it has that going for it, even though the audio mixing on the music is also the worst I've ever seen in...any game ever.\n\nThe new Codemasters games in general are quite good. I haven't played Dirt 5, but the Dirt Rally games and Dirt 4 were quite fun. I've played hundreds of hours of both Dirt Rally games using a wheel and they're still fun and challenging. The F1 games have improved significantly since F1 2015. They now are leaning into a more competitive mindset and have made the games more challenging. The driving now feels lightyears better and the AI is much better about not crashing into you.\n\nForza however, I am much less positive about. Forza 6 and 7 have been hugely disappointing for me. I even bought the Forza-themed Xbox One when it came out but did not enjoy Forza 6 at all. I didn't like that they leaned more into a curated experience rather than letting you race what you want. Forza 7 has leaned even more into that and it honestly ruined the franchise for me. The stupid cutscenes between races where they try to make you care about fictional racing drivers are both boring and way too long. I've played a few hours of Forza 7 now and it's genuinely felt like I've spent more time staring at menus, waiting for transition animations (do they really need to show the pitlane and stuff before a 3 lap race?), and watching cutscenes than actually racing in the game. Not only that but I find the AI in both Forza 6 and Forza 7 to be bad. I try to play without rewind but I ended having to use it a lot because the AI will happily crash into you, even if you do everything in your power to avoid them.\n\nAt least most of the sim games have been good like Assetto Corsa. I haven't played Forza Horizon past the first one but I'm sure those are fine too."
