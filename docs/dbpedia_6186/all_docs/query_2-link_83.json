Eh, I'm not so sure about that. It's also pretty stupid that the Game Awards combines the two since they're both pretty different genres and enough games come out every year that would fill categories for separate awards. I mean, between 2K and EA, they put out enough sports games to fill the category every year and there are still a few one-offs that could supplement it. Racing, at the very least, has an F1, rally, and MotoGP game that fit in with the occasional cart racer.\n\nShame about the GT movie too, I thought it was rather good, but I do understand how The Last of Us beat it out.\n\nFamine\n\nGTP Editor, GTPEDIA Author\n\n85,734\n\nRule 12\n\nGTP_Famine\n\nDec 8, 2023\n\n#3\n\nJust in case anyone thinks I'm exaggerating about the 18 seconds, here's the entire segment for the category, cued up:\n\nThat's it. That's the whole thing.\n\nIt's also pretty stupid that the Game Awards combines the two\n\nFun fact: only one game that doesn't have cars in it and could only possibly be classed as sports has ever won this award...\n\n... and that was based on four-wheeled motion too: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 in 2020. Every other one of the nine winners has been a car or kart game - MK8, Rocket League, FH3, FM7, FH4, CTR Nitro, FH5, GT7, and now FM2023...\n\nLast edited: Dec 8, 2023\n\nDec 8, 2023\n\n#4\n\nAbout Best Sports/Racing Game, I don't even get why almost every nominee was a racing game this year. It would be better of separating the Sports and Racing Game into two separate categories if it keeps acting like that. Even the previous years' nominees were equally spread out, spread across other fields of sport like basketball, skateboarding, etc.\n\nPlus, what about Ride 5, F1 Manager 23, Lego 2K Drive, MotoGP 23, and EA Sports WRC as possible nominees? I'm surprised that ACC didn't get nominated for Best Sports/Racing Game in its release year.\n\nHopefully, next year, TGA's board would at least care about true sim racing games like GTR Revival, Assetto Corsa 2 and Rennsport instead of slapping arcade racers in a sports-themed category.\n\nLast edited: Dec 8, 2023\n\n360\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nZedNinetySix &\n\nVeinz\n\n5,050\n\nOntario\n\nDec 8, 2023\n\n#6\n\nNow they can stamp “award winning” on every copy to make it look better than it actually is.\n\n122\n\nLondon\n\nDec 8, 2023\n\n#7\n\nI couldn't help but laugh when it won 'Best Sports/Racing Game'.\n\n25\n\nUnited States\n\nDec 8, 2023\n\n#8\n\nThere really should be a separation of Sports from Motorsports games, clearly there's enough titles for two.\n\nWe're not surprised GT7 didn't win right?

Then again, the likes of Kunos and other predominantly PC heavy Sim developers don't tend to move around or promote nealy as much product as a first party name like Sony or Microsoft and third-party names like Epic, EA and Ubisoft.\n\nLast edited: Dec 8, 2023\n\n8,013\n\nGTP_Royalton\n\nDec 8, 2023\n\n#18\n\nI think Forza winning is more of a commentary on the state of current racing games\n\nI think both Franchises are played out and either need big changes in leadership or we need a completely new franchise in the mix\n\nLast edited: Dec 8, 2023\n\n2,148\n\nDec 8, 2023\n\n#19\n\nI really like FM23. Not sure why there's so much negativity.

GT7 won the award last year, even though it's no way near as good as it should be.\n\nMeanwhile, there are other franchises as racing games go, but their games usually pale in content, which is a problem when you are competing with games that are generalists (GT and Forza), specially on which cars they offer.\n\n5,003\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nMW3Fan34\n\nDec 8, 2023\n\n#21\n\nIts truly sad to see how far both Forza and racing games as a whole have fallen honestly, what happened last night was an absolute slap in the face to the entire genre itself and has practically set a REALLY bad precedent for any future big budget racers in the near future.\n\nThis damn genre deserves better, not this mediocre, broken and unfinished nonsense we keep getting now on a yearly basis like what Forza did this year, if the industry praises **** like this, the state of both this franchise and racing games as a whole will NOT get any better moving forward, only worse.\n\nAlso good luck thinking that there's nothing fishy of sorts with Forza winning Best Sports/Racer every single year its nominated at this point after yesterday because good luck convincing me it wasnt just because of brand recognition.\n\nLast edited: Dec 8, 2023\n\n2,471\n\nsomewhere near Trial Mountain\n\noldbusanubis\n\nDec 8, 2023\n\n#22\n\nThat's why you need a $4,600 watch...\n\nTo quote Jeff Dunham's \"Walter\" character: \"Good thing it's not made in Croatia.\"\n\nLast edited: Dec 8, 2023\n\nGTvsForza\n\n8,586\n\nThe Gem State\n\nGTvsForza\n\nGTvsForza\n\nDec 9, 2023\n\n#23\n\nA lot of YouTube people are on the \"RIGGED\" boat.

Most awards are probably rigged. Just like the Oscars. Doesn't mean they're bad games or bad movies. Just that there's an agenda of sorts.\n\n2,759\n\nDec 9, 2023\n\n#29\n\nMeh. GT7 still has better gameplay and better graphics. And from what I have seen, the racing and AI in FM are laughable.\n\nSingle the Spec II update, GT7 remains the best casual racing game ever made."
