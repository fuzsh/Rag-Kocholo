        "text": "VOLUNTEER: There are always volunteer opportunities in becoming a County Coordinator in the TXGenWeb Project. If you are interested in adopting a county, please check out the Orphan Counties list and then contact Carla Clifton. If this is too much to bite off at one time, then contact any existing County Coordinator and ask how you can help them. They may need someone to transcribe records, photograph cemeteries, or do Look-Ups out of books you own or have access to. The time you devote is up to you.\n\nSURFING: We can always use another hand at Surfing TXGenWeb county websites. This is a program where volunteers surf a set of counties once a month to help select a website worthy of being named County of the Month. Contact Laura Gregory Roberts, the Committee Chairperson, if you might be interested. You do not have to be a county coordinator to volunteer as a Surfer. Best of all... This only requires about 2 to 4 hours per month of your time. The County of the Month is judged based on this Basic Criteria."
