        "text": "We have had this discussion many times, but I'll take a shot at answering it. The \"grow south\" plan was initiated by the city of Dallas and focuses on attracting new development to the southern half of the city proper.\n\nThe thing about the southern suburbs is that they are indeed growing, just not at the rates of some of the northern suburbs. This isn't a metro area where suburbs on one 'side' are losing large numbers of residents and businesses to the other 'side.'\n\nThere has been a lot of growth in the area and potential catalysts for further growth, for example:\n\n--The I-20 corridor and areas near I-45 are booming with logistics/distribution-related developments. Amazon, Wayfair, BMW, and Quaker Oats/Pepsico all operate large distribution facilities in southern Dallas County and others continue to seek out the area. Places like Wilmer and Hutchins now have enough of an employment base that apartment complexes and residential subdivisions with new homes from the $200s are going up. That would have been unheard of five years ago.\n\n--UNT-Dallas is still expanding with ambitious plans for the campus and surrounding areas. A mixed-use development called University Hills at I-20 and Lancaster Road is in the works.\n\n--Cedar Hill continues to be a shopping and retail hub for southwest Dallas County.\n\n--Further south, Waxahachie is still attracting development and serves as an employment center for Ellis County.\n\n--Southwestern Dallas county and northern Ellis county have mostly middle class demographics, which has played a prominent role in attracting new residents and businesses to the area.\n\nThe area lacks is a huge corporate presence, but you have to start somewhere. While the southern suburbs are viewed as lower cost/more affordable, we are experiencing increased home prices, low inventory, etc. found elsewhere. Even with all the recent growth, places like Cedar Hill and Lancaster aren't even half 'built-out' yet and neither are the places further south, so the southern suburbs still have a lot of potential. They may never be the \"it\" places to live in DFW, which changes from place to place every couple of years, but can still offer a good quality of life for those choosing to live there.\n\nThis forum is heavily and overwhelmingly dominated by posters in northern Dallas and the northern suburbs. Its been that way since I joined back in 2007 and remains that way today. I do believe that perceptions about the area, at least on this forum, have improved. Eleven years ago, the few who inquired about any of the southern suburbs would be told to look elsewhere, often by people living in other parts of DFW with little to no encounters in the communities they were steering people from. There are still blanket generalizations and negativity that pops up from time to time. With more members from the area joining and participating over the years, however, its much less of an issue now. When seen as a viable option to a poster, its no longer uncommon to see Cedar Hill, DeSoto, Lancaster, Midlothian, Waxahachie, Red Oak and others being recommended for consideration. The wholesale \"writing off\" of every single school and school district south of Dallas has also calmed down to an extent as well.\n\n__________________\n\nModerator for the Dallas, Fort Worth, Toledo & Shreveport-Bossier City forums.\n\nModerator posts will always appear in RED and can only be discussed via Direct Message.\n\nHelpful Links: Terms of Service (TOS) | FAQ Forum | Realtor Advice\n\nLast edited by Acntx; 09-15-2018 at 12:29 AM.."
