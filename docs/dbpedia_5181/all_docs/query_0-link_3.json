As of 2020, its population was estimated to be 192,455.[1] The county seat is Waxahachie.[2] The county was founded in 1849 and organized the next year.[3] It is named for Richard Ellis,[4] president of the convention that produced the Texas Declaration of Independence. Ellis County is included in the Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metropolitan statistical area.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 952 square miles (2,470 km2), of which 935 square miles (2,420 km2) are land and 16 square miles (41 km2) (1.7%) are covered by water.[5]\n\nLake Waxahachie is located about five miles south of Waxahachie in Ellis County, Texas. Owned and operated by Ellis County Water Control and Improvement District Number One on behalf of the city of Waxahachie, the lake was formed by impounding the Waxahachie Creek in 1956. The water covers about 650 acres and has a maximum depth around 50.[6][7] The former community of South Prong was located beside the creek before the lake was created.[8] There has been a country club and a two-acre public park with boat ramp since the lake was completed.[9] The lake is a recreational resource for the entire county.\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nInterstate 35E\n\nInterstate 45\n\nU.S. Route 67\n\nU.S. 77\n\nU.S. 287\n\nState Highway 34\n\nState Highway 342\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nDallas County (north)\n\nKaufman County (northeast)\n\nHenderson County (east)\n\nNavarro County (south)\n\nHill County (southwest)\n\nJohnson County (west)\n\nTarrant County (northwest)\n\nCommunities\n\n[edit]\n\nCities (multiple counties)\n\n[edit]\n\nCedar Hill (mostly in Dallas County)\n\nFerris (small part in Dallas County)\n\nGlenn Heights (mostly in Dallas County)\n\nGrand Prairie (mostly in Dallas and Tarrant Counties)\n\nMansfield (mostly in Tarrant County and a small part in Johnson County)\n\nVenus (mostly in Johnson County)\n\nOvilla (small part in Dallas County)\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\nTowns\n\n[edit]\n\nCensus-designated place\n\n[edit]\n\nBristol\n\nUnincorporated communities\n\n[edit]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1850989—18605,246430.4%18707,51443.2%188021,294183.4%189031,77449.2%190050,05957.5%191053,6297.1%192055,7003.9%193053,936−3.2%194047,733−11.5%195045,645−4.4%196043,395−4.9%197046,6387.5%198059,74328.1%199085,16742.6%2000111,36030.8%2010149,61034.3%2020192,45528.6%2023 (est.)222,82915.8%\n\nEllis County, Texas - Demographic Profile\n\n(NH = Non-Hispanic) Race / Ethnicity Pop 2010[13] Pop 2020[12] % 2010 % 2020 White alone (NH) 97,987 106,495 65.49% 55.34% Black or African American alone (NH) 13,161 23,738 8.80% 12.33% Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH) 565 710 0.38% 0.37% Asian alone (NH) 811 1,525 0.65% 0.79% Pacific Islander alone (NH) 87 202 0.06% 0.10% Some Other Race alone (NH) 155 790 0.10% 0.41% Mixed Race/Multi-Racial (NH) 1,683 6,963 1.12% 3.62% Hispanic or Latino (any race) 35,161 52,032 23.50% 27.04% Total 149,610 192,455 100.00% 100.00%\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.
