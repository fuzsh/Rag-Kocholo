        "text": "The 1.7 mile intersection of US 67 at Lake Ridge Parkway in Ellis & Dallas counties will undergo renovations and new construction. TxDOT has proposed the construction of a grade-separated interchange which will have six 12-foot lanes, a 10-foot raised median, and Texas U-turns. The proposed improvements also include the reconstruction of US 67’s main lanes and frontage roads (from north of Shiloh Road to south of Mt. Lebanon Road).\n\nTxDOT is expecting to get environmental clearance in Spring 2021. After the project receives environmental clearance, right-of-way will be acquired. Roughly 60.4 acres will be condemned by TxDOT for the project and one commercial building will be displaced. ROW acquisition is anticipated to begin in the summer of 2021. Afterwards, utility relocation and construction will begin."
