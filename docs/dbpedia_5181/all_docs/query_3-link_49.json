        "text": "Being convicted of a crime will likely come with a number of court-ordered penalties, but even long after one’s obligations and penalties have been fulfilled, an individual with a criminal record might find themselves facing extreme prejudice and significant hardship.

When an individual’s record is expunged, the is no record for individuals in the public to find, and the release or dissemination of those records is prohibited by any agency.\n\nFurthermore, unless the party whose records were expunged is being questioned under oath, they do not have to disclose the history of a criminal record or the fact that their record was expunged. If an individual with an expunged record is being questioned under oath, all they may have to say is that there was a cleared record, but they do not have to go into detail about the criminal activity or the expunction thereof.\n\nUnder Texas expunction law, an individual may have their criminal record expunged for the following reasons:\n\nThey were arrested but not charged with a crime or found not guilty of a crime\n\nThey were later acquitted of the crime\n\nThey were pardoned\n\nThe offense occurred when the individual was a juvenile, and the offense was:\n\na misdemeanor committed prior to age 17 and was punishable by a fine;\n\na violation of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Code by a minor; or\n\na violation by a minor of the Education Code for failure to attend school\n\nThey were found guilty of a Class C misdemeanor but received a deferred adjudication and completed the agreed to terms of their punishment. Some examples of Class C misdemeanors include the following:\n\nTheft of less than $100 or something valued less than $100\n\nPublic intoxication\n\nDisorderly conduct\n\nDriving without a valid drivers license\n\nA deferred adjudication is a type of plea deal whereby the defendant pleads guilty or no contest to criminal charges in exchange for meeting certain requirements set forth by the court. The court may order that the defendant goes for treatment, does community service, serves a probationary period, or does some other type of diversion program. Upon completion of the court’s demands, the defendant may be able to avoid a conviction or have the charges against them dismissed.\n\nTo have your criminal record expunged, you will need to apply separately for each offense on your record. Some requests for expunction can be approved, while others are denied.\n\nIf an individual is found guilty or pleaded guilty or no contest to any other type of crime than a Class C misdemeanor, their record may not be eligible for expunction, but their record may be eligible for non-disclosure if they received deferred adjudication.\n\nWhat Is Non-Disclosure of a Criminal Record?\n\nNon-disclosure is an option for individuals with a criminal record who are not eligible for expunction. Unlike an expunction (which clears your criminal record), non-disclosure leaves your criminal record as it is but makes it completely inaccessible to the public. However, certain public agencies may still be able to access your criminal record.\n\nNon-disclosure is available to individuals who have completed all terms of their deferred adjudication. Under Texas law, an individual with a criminal record, including misdemeanors, can seek to have their record sealed as soon as they complete their deferred adjudications. It is important to note that individuals with a felony on their record must wait at least five years to have their record sealed. For each crime on your criminal record that you are seeking to have sealed, you must apply separately. Some crimes may be approved for non-disclosure, while others may be denied.\n\nThere are some crimes that are never eligible for non-disclosure, including the following:\n\nSexual assault\n\nIndecency with a child\n\nProhibited sexual conduct\n\nUnlawful pornography, including child pornography\n\nKidnapping or unlawful restraint of a person under 17 years of age\n\nAggravated kidnapping\n\nEntering the dwelling place of another with the intent to commit one of the above-listed crimes\n\nViolation of a protective order\n\nFamily violence\n\nStalking\n\nAbandoning or endangering the life of a child\n\nInjuring a child, elderly, or disabled person\n\nMurder and capital murder\n\nAttempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit any of the above-listed crimes\n\nDetermining whether you are eligible to have your criminal history sealed and understanding what the process is for non-disclosure is confusing and requires a deep knowledge of the law. Likewise, understanding the process and eligibility requirements for expunction can be challenging for the average person. In circumstances where you are seeking to have your criminal record expunged or sealed, it is best to contact an experienced expunction attorney like those at the Law Offices of Mark T.
