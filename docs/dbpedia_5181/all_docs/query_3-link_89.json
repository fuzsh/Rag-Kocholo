        "text": "Advanced Ticket Sales Rules\n\nOnline tickets purchasing is provided as a convenience for our customers, and to speed up the transaction time at the box office.\n\nPurchasing your movie tickets online does NOT reserve or guarantee a parking spot. Parking is FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED – based on the time of arrival at the theatre. Weekends are extremely busy, especially in the summer months, and it is highly advised to arrive EARLY to get into the theatre on crowded nights.\n\nAll sales are FINAL – There are NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES for online ticket purchases. You must redeem the ticket at the theatre on the night it was purchased.\n\nFollow the online instructions, and print out your ticket (with barcode) on your printer and bring it to the theatre, or bring the credit/debit card used to purchase the tickets with you and present it at the box office for validation.\n\nI agree"
