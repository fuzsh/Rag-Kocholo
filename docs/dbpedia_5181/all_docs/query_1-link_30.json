        "text": "More than 150 years in the making, Waxahachie is a community that takes great pride in its rich heritage, which visitors instantly see through the historically preserved buildings and homes throughout the city. Though modern, progressive and thriving, the city’s pulse resonates with the history of Texas.\n\nThrough the years, Waxahachie has earned much acclaim, as evident in its many monikers. Known as the Gingerbread City and the Crape Myrtle Capital of Texas, Waxahachie also claims the title of The Best Little Hollywood in Texas, thanks to the filming of Bonnie and Clyde in the city in 1967. Enjoy shopping in the Historic Downtown District, which is anchored by the state’s most photographed courthouse, or dine at one of the city’s many fine restaurants or tearooms. Annual events include Scarborough Renaissance Festival, Gingerbread Trail Tour of Homes, SCREAMS, Texas Country Reporter Festival, Candlelight Home Tour and Bethlehem Revisited.\n\nWaxahachie, TX is technically a suburb of Dallas, Texas. Waxahachie, however, is located centrally in Ellis County, not Dallas County. Conveniently located off of I-35 and US HWY 287, it is just about 25 miles from downtown Dallas. For people looking to get out of the big city, yet still maintain the feel that you have stores, shops and a good amount of local businesses to serve you, then Waxahachie is a great place to live. The drive to Dallas and other nearby cities is convenient with I-35 running right next to Waxahachie. If you want to work in Dallas, yet live far enough outside the city, then your morning and evening commutes will not be that difficult. It is nice for residents here to have the big city nearby to enjoy, yet still have it far enough away to feel like you live outside the hustle and bustle of the big city.\n\nAbout Waxahachie\n\nWaxahachie, TX is a great place to work and live. A suburb of Dallas, located just south of Dallas in Ellis County, it has been growing and flourishing for years. This growing town has a great school system, loads of new businesses and has a diverse area to move your family to. Rich with historic homes and a wonderful past, Waxahachie has been around since the mid 1800′s.\n\nHave you ever seen the Richardsonian Romanesque courthouse in the middle of downtown? This is by far considered by many to be the most beautiful of older courthouses in the entire state of Texas. This specific style of building was named after the famed architect Henry Hobson Richardson. He has built courthouses and other buildings like this all over the United States.\n\nWaxahachie, TX is also the home for many exciting events. The famed Gingerbread Trail Festival takes place every year. It is a great event that is fun for the whole family. From outdoor vendors, crafts and the amazing tour of some of the oldest homes in the area, it is exciting for people of all ages. Another huge event that has taken place here were two movies that were filmed in the heart of Waxahachie: Places of the Heart with Sally Fields and Tender Mercies with Robert Duvall.\n\nWaxahachie has some great wide-open spaces. If you are looking to get out of the city and into an area that is not filled with buildings and huge neighborhoods with tons of homes, then Waxahachie could be for you. Let’s say you’re looking for some acreage to build a small home, or are looking for maybe a farm. Believe it or not, those things still do exist in the area. Everywhere you turn on the outskirts of town you will find land that may just suit your needs.\n\nLiving in this town has some great opportunities for various types of living. You can live in the heart of the downtown area in one of the antique homes on some of the nearby streets. You can also live in some of the newer and older neighborhoods that surround the city. And if you are just hankering for some country living, Waxahachie, TX has that too. There is a lot of lands still left in Ellis County. Waxahachie has no shortage of acreage for those seeking the solitude of the country, yet are still close enough to the city for fun, games, and shopping.\n\nScarborough Renaissance Festival\n\nIt is that time of the year again; the Scarborough Renaissance Festival will be coming to the Waxahachie, TX area April 9 – May 30 – Weekends and Memorial Day Monday – 10 AM to 7 PM. If you have not been to one before, you may want to consider taking the whole family. There are tons of things to do there for every age in attendance. There are great shows featuring The Joust, The Royal Falconer, Don Juan and Miguel, Daniel Duke of Danger and so much more. There are also tons of rides and attractions. You may find yourself needing to come more than one day just to see and experience it all. For more information, check out this site at http://www.srfestival.com/.\n\nWaxahachie farmers market\n\nDoes Waxahachie have a farmers market? Yes, they sure do. The farmers market is typically held from May to October in the very historic courthouse area every Saturday. It is specifically on Franklin Street right between College and Rogers. Going local is a great way to support the area’s small farmers. This helps to bring money back into the local economy supporting the residents and businesses that this area depends on. And let’s face it- there is something great about freshly picked and locally grown produce. There are vendors of all types in the square on Saturdays offering up fresh produce, honey and other goodies. So bring the family and come out and see what your local Waxahachie Farmers Market has to offer. We think you will be pleasantly surprised.\n\nGingerbread Trail in Waxahachie, Texas\n\nHistory of Waxahachie\n\nArea Attractions :"
