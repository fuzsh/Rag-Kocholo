        "text": "OUR STORY\n\nEllis County Coalition for Health Options, DBA Hope Health was originally established in Waxahachie, Texas in 1999 as Hope Clinic. Hope began when a group of caring individuals and leaders came together to discuss their deep concerns about the number of uninsured and indigent people in Ellis County who lacked access to health care. This faith-based, not-for-profit corporation’s purpose was to provide comprehensive health care services for the entire family. Hope Health’s very existence has always been the result of community driven efforts.\n\nA 2005 contract with Ellis County leveraged tax dollars to provide health care access for more people in the community, while at the same time improving health outcomes for those persons qualified for the County Indigent Health Care Program.\n\nIn March 2009, again with broad-based community support, Hope received the designation as a Federally Qualified Health Center. The main purpose of the FQHC Program is to enhance the provision of primary health care services in underserved urban and rural communities. This designation gives the health center the ability to serve Medicare and Medicaid patients as well as to receive federal grant monies, enhanced reimbursement, and support services from HRSA.\n\nWe provide comprehensive health care services including adult and pediatric primary health care, women’s health, dental care and restoration, in addition to behavioral health assessment and treatment with fees based on income."
