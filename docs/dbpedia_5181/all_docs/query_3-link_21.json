        "text": "Flood hazard maps, also known as Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), are important tools in the effort to protect lives and properties. They indicate the risk for flooding throughout Tarrant and Dallas Counties. However, the maps became outdated. Tarrant County maps were last updated 10 years ago. Dallas County maps were previously updated 5 years ago. Since then, water flow and drainage patterns have changed dramatically due to surface erosion, land use and natural causes. The likelihood of inland and riverine flooding in certain areas has changed along with these factors.\n\nNew mapping techniques provide more detailed, reliable and current data on Tarrant and Dallas County flood hazards. The result: a better picture of the areas most likely to be impacted by flooding and a better foundation from which to make key decisions.\n\nA nationwide collaborative effort across all levels of government has been responsible for updating the nation’s flood hazard data and providing detailed, digital data, in accordance with a multi-year plan created by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The effort has evolved as a growing number of industries were impacted by out-of-date flood data.\n\nTarrant and Dallas County map modernization project was a joint effort with FEMA in cooperation with local associations and private sector partners.\n\nA floodplain is the part of the land where water collects, pools, and flows during the course of natural events. Such areas are classified as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), and are located in a 1% annual chance (100-year) flood zone. The term “100-year flood” is a little misleading. It is the flood evaluation that has a 1- percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year; it does not mean that the flood will only occur once every 100 years.\n\nIf the new maps indicate the building on your property is now at a higher risk for flooding, you will likely be required to purchase a flood insurance policy if you have a mortgage from a federally regulated lender. If you do not have a mortgage, you have the option to purchase flood insurance. Over the life of a 30-year loan, there is about a 3 times greater chance of having a flood in your home than having a fire*. Standard homeowner insurance policies do not provide coverage for damage due to flooding. Flood insurance is an additional rider.\n\n*FEMA – 2005 National Statistic\n\nIf your structure is mapped into a high-risk area and you have a mortgage with a federally-regulated lender, you will likely be required to purchase flood insurance. If your property is mapped into a low- or moderate-risk area, you will not be required to purchase or maintain insurance but are strongly encouraged to do so. The cost of protecting your home and contents from flood damage with a flood insurance policy is far less expensive than the cost to repair or replace it after a flood has occurred without a flood insurance policy.\n\nThe City participates in the National Flood Insurance Program’s Community Rating System (CRS) program, which allows our residents and businesses to purchase flood insurance at a reduced rate. Property owners can purchase flood insurance to protect their buildings and/or contents. Renters can purchase contents-only flood insurance to protect the value of their belongings. Talk to your insurance agent to determine the appropriate level of protection for your situation.\n\nThe National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has “grandfathering” rules to recognize policyholders who built in compliance with the effective flood map at the time the building was constructed or those who already had flood insurance policies in effect with the new maps became effective and have maintained continuous coverage.\n\nThese rules allow such policyholders to benefit in the premium rating for their building. However, property owners should always use the new map if it will provide you with a more favorable premium.\n\nRenewal of An Existing Policy\n\nWhen determining the premium you will pay for flood insurance, an insurance agent will rate your flood insurance policy based on the flood map that is in effect on the date you purchase your policy. Flood Insurance policies may then be renewed and still be rated based on the flood map in effect when the policy was initially rated as long as the flood coverage is continuous and the building has not been altered in a manner that would remove this benefit.\n\nBuilt in Compliance\n\nThe NFIP will honor a Grandfather rule for buildings constructed after the first flood map for the community became effective if:\n\nThe building was built in compliance with the flood map in effect at the time of construction; and\n\nif the building has not been substantially damaged or altered.\n\nUnder this Grandfather rule, the property owner must provide proper documentation to the insurance company.\n\nIf you wish to keep the zone designation in effect when the structure was built, you must provide a copy of the flood map effective at the time of construction showing where the structure is located or present a letter from a community official verifying this information.\n\nIn general, for building constructed in high-risk zones after the community’s first flood map was adopted, your rates are based upon the difference between the flood map’s Base Flood Elevation (BFE) and your building’s elevation. If there is a charge in the BFE and keeping the BFE that existed when the structure was first built gives you a better rate, you must provide the agent with an elevation certificate and a copy of the flood map effective at the time of construction. A letter from a community official verifying this information may also acceptable."
