        "text": "Unlike just about every other page on this website, the purpose of this DFW metroplex page is not to help folks moving to DFW area find the best places to live. If that is now the task at hand, you may find the pages listed below more useful starting point.\n\nBest Dallas suburbs\n\nBest DFW schools\n\nBest Dallas area neighborhoods\n\nOn the other hand, if you are just beginning to explore the Dallas Fort Worth area, this introduction to the DFW metroplex may be of interest.\n\nWhen you have questions about finding the best places to live in Dallas, please call me at 972 355-3511 or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nDFW area overview\n\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington Metropolitan Area (aka DFW metroplex, Dallas metroplex, DFW area, north Texas) encompasses thirteen north Texas counties, Collin, Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Hood, Hunt, Johnson, Kaufman, Parker, Rockwall, Somervell, Tarrant and Wise. For 2016, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the DFW metroplex population to be 7,233,323, which is more than all but three other U.S. metro areas and 38 U.S. states. The Dallas County population was nearly 2.6 million and the population of Tarrant County was just over 2 million. The number of residents living in each of the other DFW metroplex counties was less than 1 million.\n\nThe DFW metroplex is quite large, covering 9,286 square miles. Nearly 9,000 square miles of the DFW area is land, which is larger than the land areas of six U.S. states, Massachusetts, Hawaii, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island, and about the same as the land area of the state of New Hampshire. While the largest cities in the DFW area are fairly densely populated with greater than 3,500 residents per square mile, the population density for the area overall is less than 800 residents per square mile.\n\nWe are fortunate here to have wonderful weather. Our abundant sunshine, about 235 sunny days a year, is especially enjoyable. The warmest months are July and August, with average high temperatures of 95 degrees and average lows of 74 degrees. The coolest month is January, when average temperatures range from 35 to 55 degrees. On an annual basis, the average temperature is 66 degrees.\n\nThe Dallas Fort Worth area experiences an average of 79 rainy days annually and 39 days with the temperature below freezing. Average annual precipitation is about 33 inches.\n\nWhile it's pretty hot in the summer, temperatures otherwise are generally mild and the relative humidity is fairly low year-round. Not surprisingly, athletic and other outdoor recreational activities are very popular in the DFW area. A list of just some of the places to go and things to do in the Dallas Fort Worth area is provided at the bottom of this page.\n\nList of DFW cities and towns\n\nAs shown in the table below, there are more than 200 incorporated cities and towns located in the Dallas Fort Worth metropolitan area. They range in population from the city of Dallas, which has over 1.3 million residents according to the 2015 U.S. Census report, to the town of Corrall City, which has less than 50 residents.\n\nThe table in which this data is presented is sortableable, and also searchable. So if you want to see a list of all cities and towns showing those with the largest populations at the top, select All in the Show entries box and double click on the population column heading. To limit the data shown to a specific city or town, type its name in the Search box. With these capabilities, you easily can display a list of towns and cities in Dallas County or cities near Dallas or Fort Worth.\n\nfrom downtown Dallasfrom downtown Fort Worth
