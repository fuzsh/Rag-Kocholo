Many who know him say that he was born with the desire and dream of owning a funeral home and helping others. Mr. Beckwith began his destiny in the funeral business at the early age of 14. Living in a rural area in Louisiana was not a hindrance for Mr. Beckwith, he was so determined that he would walk several miles and hitchhike to local funeral homes to learn the business. With the help of friends and local funeral home owners in Louisiana, he began as a Carwash Attendant and Ambulance Driver. Because of his passion, desire and hard work he was promoted to General Manager. Mr. Beckwith not only had a desire and dream of owning a funeral home, he was an advocate of Civil Rights while in Louisiana, in this struggle for freedom and equal rights Mr. Beckwith lost many friends. His dream of owning a funeral home intensified with his friends' loss in the Civil Rights struggle. Mr. Beckwith realized why the passion and desire of owning a funeral home was so deeply rooted in his spirit; it was his destiny to provide families with quality and affordable funeral services.\n\nHis desires, passions and dreams led him to Dallas, TX, where he met and married the missing piece to assist him in achieving his destiny, his soul mate and helpmate “Allene Zachery.” In Dallas Mr. Beckwith continued his quest of achieving his destiny by working for local funeral homes, Red Ball Motor Freight and as an Insurance Agent, while along with his wife raising their five children. On September 15, 1980 all of Mr. Beckwith’s hard work came to pass, his destiny was fulfilled in Waxahachie, TX where he established Golden Gate Funeral Home.
