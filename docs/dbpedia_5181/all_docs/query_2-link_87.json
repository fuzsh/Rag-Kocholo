        "text": "North and Central Texas December 26, 2015 Tornado Outbreak\n\nA significant tornado outbreak occurred on December 26, 2015, across portions of North and Central Texas. This significant tornado outbreak produced a total of 12 confirmed tornadoes. In all, 8 counties in North and Central Texas were impacted by tornadoes. 13 individuals were killed as a result of their injuries associated with tornadoes with numerous individuals injured. More than half of these individuals were killed at the Interstate 30 and Highway 190 (President George Bush Turnpike) junction in eastern Dallas County.\n\nQuick\n\nFacts The\n\nEnvironment Satellite\n\nPresentation Radar\n\nPresentation NWS Fort Worth\n\nProducts Confirmed\n\nTornadoes North & Central Texas\n\nDecember Tornado Climatology\n\nQuick Facts\n\nThe December 26, 2015, outbreak was noteworthy on several accounts. Below are just a few interesting tidbits. Note: The N/C TX Tornado Climatology dates back to 1950.\n\nThere have only been 10 other years in which at least 1 tornado was observed in the month of December across N/C TX\n\n1967, 1968, 1971, 1973, 1984, 1987, 1999, 2002, 2006, 2008\n\nThe December 26, 2015, tornado outbreak ranks 3rd in terms of number of confirmed tornadoes in a 24 hour time period in the month of December\n\nThe Sunnyvale-Garland-Rowlett tornado ranks #1 in terms of highest rated & deadliest tornado in Dallas Co. for December (rated EF4 with 10 fatalities)\n\nThe Sunnyvale-Garland-Rowlett tornado is the 1st killer December tornado in Dallas Co.\n\nThe Midlothian-Ovilla-Glenn Heights tornado is the 1st confirmed EF3 tornado in the month of December in Ellis Co.\n\nThe Copeville tornado is the 1st confirmed EF2 tornado in the month of December in Collin Co.\n\nClick here to return to the top of the page\n\nThe Environment\n\nThe overall synoptic environment on December 26, 2015, was governed by large scale ascent courtesy of a potent upper level trough located across the four corners region as a 100 knot upper level jet stream nudged eastward. This type of upper air pattern was observed during the Central TX tornado outbreak of December 29, 2006, as well as the December 14, 1971. The strong upper level jet allowed for a very intense surface trough to develop across portions of the central plains. Coincidentally, an extensive and sharp cold front extended from the central plains back southward through the southern plains (including Oklahoma and North Texas).\n\nThe strong surface cyclone that develops to the northwest of North and Central TX allowed low level moisture to stream northward into the area as seen in the series of analyzed surface charts. Despite the widespread cloud cover, which can be observed in the satellite presentation section below, instability and deep vertical wind shear were sufficient for severe weather. The deepening surface low resulted in 60 to even above 70 degree Dew points surging northward into the region.\n\nSouthern Plains Surface Analysis\n\n1000 CST Regional Surface Analysis\n\nNoontime Regional Surface Analysis\n\n1500 CST Regional Surface Analysis\n\n1800 CST Regional Surface Analysis\n\nClick on any of the above thumbnails for a larger image (opens in new window)\n\nForecasters at both the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) and at NWS Fort Worth had continued to communicate the message of severe weather across North and Central Texas during the morning and early afternoon hours on December 26, 2015. The figures below show the progression of the SPC's Day 1 Convective outlook. Much of the region was already beneath an \"enhanced risk\" for severe weather with the main hazards being large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes at the 1300 UTC (700 CST) Day 1 convective outlook. As new observational data and information from hi-resolution model guidance became more readily available, the risk for severe weather continued to be messaged. Specifically, the SPC continued the \"enhanced\" risk for severe weather across all of North and Central at the 1600 UTC (1000 CST) Day 1 convective outlook. This \"enhanced risk\" of severe weather was maintained at the afternoon update (2000 UTC or 1400 CST) as well.\n\nStorm Prediction Center Day 1 Convective Outlooks\n\n1300 UTC (0700 CST)\n\nSPC Day 1 Convective Outlook\n\n1600 UTC (1000 CST)\n\nSPC Day 1 Convective Outlook\n\n2000 UTC (1400 CST)\n\nSPC Day 1 Convective Outlook\n\nClick on any of the above thumbnails for a larger image (opens in new window)\n\nAs the cold front neared North and Central TX and large scale ascent continued, the cap or layer of warm air aloft eroded as evidenced in a comparison between the 12 UTC (0600 CST) weather balloon data and the special 18 UTC (1200 CST) weather balloon data that was sampled over North Texas. Below are the annotated versions of the upper air data collected by weather balloons launched at NWS Fort Worth. Select here for the unannotated 12 UTC weather balloon data and here for the unannotated special 18 UTC weather balloon data.\n\nNWS Fort Worth Observed Upper Air Data\n\n1200 UTC (0600 CST) on 12/26/2015\n\nAnnotated Upper Air Weather Balloon Data\n\n1800 UTC (Noon) on 12/26/2015\n\nAnnotated Upper Air Weather Balloon Data\n\nClick on any of the above thumbnails for a larger image (opens in new window)\n\nThe importance of the cap or lid of warmer air aloft, is that it oftentimes will limit the widespread nature of upward vertical motion necessary for convective growth. In some instances, if the cap or lid of warmer air aloft is large or warm enough, thunderstorms may not form at all. Regardless of the cap, the environment was very moist and unstable by late December standards. Instability values were more than 3 times the norm. The noontime (18 UTC) weather balloon data revealed that not only was the cap nearly gone, the amount of instability had increased through the afternoon hours. The noontime weather balloon data also sampled an environment with increasing low level wind speeds that helped to further transport warm and moist air towards North and Central TX. The increasing low level winds (and ultimately low level wind shear) also favored an environment conducive for all facets of severe weather. With the potential for severe weather becoming more and more imminent, the SPC and NWS Fort Worth coordinated Tornado Watch Number 569 that included all of North and Central TX.\n\nClick here to return to the top of the page\n\nSatellite Presentation\n\nSatellite imagery is courtesy of the Aviation Weather Center and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Visible imagery below is valid between 1430 UTC (0830 CST) through 2315 UTC (1715 CST). Infrared (IR) imagery is valid from 1215 UTC (0615 CST) through 0630 UTC (0030 CST December 27, 2015). As seen in both the visible and IR satellite imagery, a majority of the day was actually dominated by partly to mostly cloudy skies. Towards the end of the visible and IR imagery, one should notice that the overall cloud field becomes slightly thinner, suggesting that a few areas saw some sunshine. It is likely that pockets of higher instability were present across North and Central TX and may have played a role in the initial development of showers and thunderstorms.\n\nVisible & Infrared Satellite Imagery\n\nVisible Satellite Imagery\n\nInfrared Satellite Imagery\n\nClick on any of the above thumbnails for an animated gif of satellite imagery on the afternoon of December 26, 2015\n\n(opens in new window)\n\nClick here to return to the top of the page\n\nRadar Presentation\n\nAnimated gifs from radar imagery across North and Central TX during the afternoon and evening hours of December 26, 2015, can be seen below.
