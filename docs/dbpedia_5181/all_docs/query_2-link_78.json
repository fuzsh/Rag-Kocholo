        "text": "The Allergy and Asthma Center at Waxahachie was founded in 2010 by Dr. Scot Laurie. After practicing for 10 years in north-central Dallas as well as the Garland/Richardson area in both group and solo practices, Dr. Laurie decided to pursue the establishment of his Waxahachie practice location and dedicate himself to providing thoughtful and comprehensive care in the field of allergy and immunology in the Ellis County/southern Dallas County area, to provide the highest quality care in this historically medically underserved area and this office now serves patients from Waxahachie, Midlothian, Red Oak, Ennis, Ferris, and adjacent communities.\n\nDr. Laurie’s goal in opening his practice was simple: to provide his patients with a careful, accurate and comprehensive evaluation that will enable his patients to obtain a long-term solution to their allergy-related health care problems. Dr. Laurie's expertise has previously made him one of the most respected allergy doctors in Dallas and he has now brought that expertise to the Waxahachie/Midlothian area.\n\nDr. Laurie chose to locate his practice in the Baylor Professional Plaza, a medical complex that is conveniently located adjacent to the Baylor Scott & White Medical Center at Waxahachie. With conveniences such as free parking, the Baylor Professional Plaza is a desirable location to receive your medical care.\n\nPatients will find Dr. Laurie’s office to be a professional, yet warm and comfortable environment that will make your visit with him a pleasant experience.\n\nIf Dr. Laurie and his staff can be of assistance to you, please do not hesitate to contact the Allergy and Asthma Center at Waxahachie today!\n\nDr. Laurie's staff, Cynda Alexander, Hailey Smith, and Lindsey Swallow have 30 years experience of providing front/administrative work as well as medical assistant care."
