        "text": "Occupational Employment and Wages in Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington â May 2022\n\nWorkers in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX Metropolitan Statistical Area had an average (mean) hourly wage of $29.41 in May 2022, 1 percent below the nationwide average of $29.76, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Assistant Commissioner for Regional Operations Michael Hirniak noted that, after testing for statistical significance, wages in the local area were lower than their respective national averages in 17 of the 22 major occupational groups, including arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media; life, physical, and social science; and construction and extraction. Three groups had significantly higher wages than their respective national averages, including legal and also transportation and material moving.\n\nWhen compared to the nationwide distribution, Dallas area employment was more highly concentrated in 7 of the 22 occupational groups, including management, office and administrative support, and transportation and material moving. Thirteen groups had employment shares significantly below their national representation, including healthcare support, healthcare practitioners and technical, and production. (See table A.)\n\nOne occupational group—transportation and material moving—was chosen to illustrate the diversity of data available for any of the 22 major occupational categories. Dallas had 401,200 jobs in transportation and material moving, accounting for 10.5 percent of local area employment, significantly higher than the 9.2-percent share nationally. The average hourly wage for this occupational group locally was $21.58, significantly above the national wage of $21.12.\n\nSome of the larger detailed occupations within the transportation and material moving group included stockers and order fillers (90,790), laborers and hand freight, stock, and material movers (82,030), and heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers (61,560). Among the higher-paying jobs in this group were transportation inspectors and wellhead pumpers, with mean hourly wages of $45.08 and $35.70, respectively. At the lower end of the wage scale were parking attendants ($13.31) and cleaners of vehicles and equipment ($14.19). (Detailed data for the transportation and material moving occupations are presented in table 1; for a complete listing of detailed occupations available go to www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_19100.htm.)\n\nLocation quotients allow us to explore the occupational make-up of a metropolitan area by comparing the composition of jobs in an area relative to the national average. (See table 1.) For example, a location quotient of 2.0 indicates that an occupation accounts for twice the share of employment in the area than it does nationally. In the Dallas area, above-average concentrations of employment were found in some of the occupations within the transportation and material moving group. For instance, flight attendants were employed at 2.7 times the national rate in Dallas, and airline pilots, copilots, and flight engineers, at 2.4 times the U.S. average. Refuse and recyclable material collectors had a location quotient of 1.0 in Dallas, indicating that this particular occupation’s local and national employment shares were similar.\n\nThese statistics are from the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey, a federal-state cooperative program between BLS and State Workforce Agencies, in this case, the Texas Workforce Commission.\n\nTechnical Note\n\nThe Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey is a semiannual survey measuring occupational employment and wage rates for wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments in the United States. The OEWS data available from BLS include cross-industry occupational employment and wage estimates for the nation; over 580 areas, including states and the District of Columbia, metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), nonmetropolitan areas, and territories; national industry-specific estimates at the NAICS sector, 3-digit, most 4-digit, and selected 5- and 6-digit industry levels, and national estimates by ownership across all industries and for schools and hospitals. OEWS data are available at www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm.\n\nThe OEWS survey is a cooperative effort between BLS and the State Workforce Agencies (SWAs). BLS funds the survey and provides the procedures and technical support, while the State Workforce Agencies collect most of the data. OEWS estimates are constructed from a sample of about 1.1 million establishments. Each year, two semiannual panels of approximately 179,000 to 187,000 sampled establishments are contacted, one panel in May and the other in November. Responses are obtained by Internet or other electronic means, mail, email, telephone, or personal visit. The May 2022 estimates are based on responses from six semiannual panels collected over a 3-year period: May 2022, November 2021, May 2021, November 2020, May 2020, and November 2019. The unweighted sampled employment of 80 million across all six semiannual panels represents approximately 57 percent of total national employment. The overall national response rate for the six panels, based on the 50 states and the District of Columbia, is 65.4 percent based on establishments and 62.5 percent based on weighted sampled employment. The sample in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX Metropolitan Statistical Area included 10,720 establishments with a response rate of 39 percent. For more information about OEWS concepts and methodology, go to www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_tec.htm.\n\nA value that is statistically different from another does not necessarily mean that the difference has economic or practical significance. Statistical significance is concerned with the ability to make confident statements about a universe based on a sample. It is entirely possible that a large difference between two values is not significantly different statistically, while a small difference is, since both the size and heterogeneity of the sample affect the relative error of the data being tested.\n\nMetropolitan area definitions\n\nThe substate area data published in this release reflect the standards and definitions established by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.\n\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX Metropolitan Statistical Area includes Collin County, Dallas County, Denton County, Ellis County, Hood County, Hunt County, Johnson County, Kaufman County, Parker County, Rockwall County, Somervell County, Tarrant County, and Wise County.\n\nFor more information\n\nAnswers to frequently asked questions about the OEWS data are available at www.bls.gov/oes/oes_ques.htm.
