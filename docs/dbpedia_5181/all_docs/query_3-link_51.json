Recent concerns about the mottled duck populations by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have forced a delay in harvest.\n\nYouth Only Season\n\n16 years of age or younger. Regular season bag limits apply for all legal species of geese, ducks, mergansers, coots, moorhens, and gallinules. Dusky ducks are legal during the Youth-only and Veteran Special season.

A valid Federal Duck Stamp and HIP Certification are also required of waterfowl hunters 16 years of age or older.\n\nHarvest Information Program\n\nWhen you purchase a hunting license, indicate to the license clerk that you intend to hunt migratory game birds and need to be HIP certified by answering a few simple questions.\n\nMigratory Game Bird Regulations\n\nDefinitions\n\nGeneral Rules\n\nMethods\n\nLicense, Permit and Endorsement Requirements\n\nSpecies Illegal to Hunt"
