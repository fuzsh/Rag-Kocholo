Your barn’s gone. Your storage is gone, but we're okay.’\"\n\nTheir neighbors at properties across the street bore the brunt of it, but, thankfully, no one there was home.\n\n\"Driving up was worse just because of my neighbor’s house. She lost everything, and it's literally right across the street from me,\" Cagle said. \"So we're blessed. We're fine. We're good.\"\n\nDavid Brewer is the Precinct 4 commissioner for Navarro County.\n\n\"Got lots of trees down in the roadway. Been at it since 2:30 this afternoon, and this is one of the heaviest spots right here that we've run across,\" he said. \"A couple two or three homes have been hit pretty hard, but mostly it’s just debris and trees down in the roadways. We can replace stuff. You can't replace people.\"\n\nThe NWS says it will begin surveying the damage on Saturday.\n\nOver in Kaufman County, some parts saw flash flooding from torrential rainfall.\n\nUp to six inches of rain fell in the area.\n\nThe Flash Flood Warning for Kaufman County expired at 8 p.m., but there was still standing water in some areas after that.\n\nPictures and videos sent in by viewers show just how hard it rained and why the water accumulated so quickly.\n\nMore rain over the next few days could cause additional flooding issues.\n\nFriday Updates\n\n5:32 p.m.\n\nFOX 4's Blake Hanson is in Frost, where there is damage from today's storms.\n\n5:15 p.m.\n\nThe tornado warning in Van Zandt and Kaufman County has been allowed to expire.\n\n4:51 p.m.\n\nFOX 4's Blake Hanson is in Italy, Texas where there is flooding from today's storms.\n\n4:50 p.m.\n\nA new tornado warning has been issued for Van Zandt County until 5 p.m.\n\n4:23 p.m.\n\n3:42 p.m.\n\nThe City of Ennis said it has seen rain and minor flooding on the roadways.
