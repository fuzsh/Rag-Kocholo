        "text": "About 20 minutes south of Dallas, the city of Red Oak is experiencing a surge in growth. The community reports a population increase of more than 13% from 2021 to 2023 — significantly outpacing Dallas County, Ellis County (where Red Oak is located) and the state as a whole. Red Oak has become a hot spot for those seeking a blend of suburban tranquility, urban accessibility and value for their real estate dollars.\n\nReal estate agent Jaime Resendiz says Red Oak’s positioning near railroad tracks set it up for success way back in the late 1800s. Today, it boasts modern conveniences (think Chick-fil-A and Starbucks, and multiple shopping centers and grocery stores) — and a median home value of $358,400, according to February 2024 data from Texas Realtors and the Texas A&M University Texas Real Estate Research Center. That month saw 26 home sales close in the community of 17,396 residents — an increase of nearly 45% year over year.\n\nRed Oak is a short commute from employers in Waxahachie and Dallas, and additional jobs are coming within city limits: Google has announced plans to build a data center there. The tech giant has also pledged a $150,000 grant to Red Oak ISD for its STEM program.\n\nGrace Lacy, a sales counselor at HistoryMaker Homes (which is building in Red Oak), believes the city offers appeal for homebuyers, with bigger homes at a lesser price point. “Red Oak is on the verge of booming,” Lacy shares, adding that there’s a lot of buzz around a new movie theater and entertainment complex.\n\nSmall businesses are finding success as well. “There’s a lot of opportunity for business growth and contributing to welcomed cultural changes,” says Tammy Mabra, who co-founded the local shop Good Golly Chocolate and grew up in Red Oak.\n\nDespite recent development in the area, Mabra says Red Oak still offers a small-town feeling. There are a variety of community events, such as photos with the Easter Bunny and a fall festival. And Big D is an easy drive, with Red Oak nestled between Interstate 35E and Interstate 45.\n\nWhether you’re looking for new construction or an established neighborhood, homebuyers have plenty of options in this Ellis County community. Some homes on the market include:\n\nList price: $436,990 | Square footage: 2,752 | Lot size: .14 acre\n\nThis four-bedroom, three-bath residence is being built as part of a development called The Oaks. In addition to the new-construction homes, The Oaks offers park space, sports fields, a community pool and other amenities.\n\nBuilt by HistoryMaker Homes, 1227 Stockton Trail is nearing completion. The first floor accommodates the primary suite, a secondary bedroom and a home office, among other spaces; a game room and additional bedrooms are upstairs.\n\nRelated:Dallas too expensive? These are some of the most affordable North Texas suburbs right now\n\nList price: $588,000 | Square footage: 2,464 | Lot size: 2.56 acres\n\nIf you’re looking for more yard and an established neighborhood, consider this 1995 single-story home in Red Oak’s Country Ridge Estates community. It has three bedrooms and two and a half baths, and is situated on a 2.5-acre creek-side lot.\n\nStep from the gated front porch into spaces that feature crown molding and plantation blinds. The living room has a gas fireplace, while the kitchen has custom cabinetry and granite counters. Outdoors, relax on the covered patio or in the hot tub shaded by a large tree.\n\nList price: $1,300,000 | Square footage: 5,343 | Lot size: 4.34 acres\n\nIf you long for even more acreage, this spacious home may be the right fit. The new-construction property comes with a separate bungalow and is situated on 4.34 acres in the gated equestrian community of Shiloh Downs.\n\nThe first level includes an office, dining room, and open-concept living and kitchen area. Large secondary bedrooms have their own walk-in closets and bathrooms; the primary suite has a tray ceiling, with a bath featuring his-and-her closets, a claw-foot tub and an spacious shower. In all, there are five bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms."
