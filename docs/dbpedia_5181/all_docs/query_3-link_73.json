        "text": "COVID-19\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nThe safety of our patients, staff, physicians on our medical staff, and visitors remains one of the highest priorities for Methodist Health System. In line with that priority, we continue to carefully monitor the status of the pandemic, patient volumes, and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention while fulfilling our mission To improve and save Lives through compassionate, quality healthcare.\n\nMask policy:\n\nEffective January 24, 2023 Methodist Health System is revising our mask policy for employees, physicians on the medical staff, patients, and visitors at all campuses. Going forward, masking requirements will be based on the rate of transmission in each individual county.\n\nAt this time, Dallas, Tarrant, Ellis and Collin Counties have a \"high\" level of COVID-19 transmission rates. At Methodist facilities located in these counties, the following masking policies apply:\n\nMasks will be ENCOURAGED, but not required, in all public areas of our facilities, such as registration desks, hallways, waiting rooms, and cafeterias.\n\nMasks will be REQUIRED in patient rooms, procedural areas, and when patients are directly receiving care, including transport. This includes the Methodist Medical Group clinics.\n\nMasks will be REQUIRED for group or open care settings, such as dialysis or infusion centers.\n\nWe will review transmission rates on a weekly basis. When a county either increases or decreases transmission for four (4) weeks, we will adjust our masking requirements accordingly.\n\nScreening policy: We ask that visitors to our facilities self-screen.\n\nPlease do not visit your loved ones if you have any of the below symptoms:\n\nFever or chills\n\nNausea or vomiting\n\nHeadache\n\nSore throat\n\nFatigue\n\nCough\n\nCongestion or runny nose\n\nMuscle or body aches\n\nNew loss of taste or smell\n\nDiarrhea\n\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n\nVisitor policy: Patients not being treated for COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19 are allowed open visitation as long as it does not interfere with patient care. Visitors must adhear to the mask policy, meet the above screening criteria, and adhere to visiting hours. More information, including visitation for patients with COVID-19, can be found here.\n\nCOVID-19 testing: If you're seeking a COVID-19 test, please contact your primary care physician to potentially be connected to one of our testing sites. If you donâ€™t have a primary care physician, click here to find one near you."
