It does this by computing the straight line flying distance (\"as the crow flies\") and the driving distance if the route is drivable. It uses all this data to compute the total travel mileage.\n\nEllis County, Texas\n\nState: Texas\n\nCountry: United States\n\nCategory: counties\n\nDallas, Texas\n\nCity: Dallas\n\nState: Texas\n\nCountry: United States\n\nCategory: cities\n\nDistance calculator\n\nTravelmath helps you find distances based on actual road trip directions, or the straight line flight distance. You can get the distance between cities, airports, states, countries, or zip codes to figure out the best route to travel to your destination. Compare the results to the straight line distance to determine whether it's better to drive or fly. The database uses the latitude and longitude of each location to calculate distance using the great circle distance formula. The calculation is done using the Vincenty algorithm and the WGS84 ellipsoid model of the Earth, which is the same one used by most GPS receivers. This gives you the flying distance \"as the crow flies.\" Find your flight distances quickly to estimate the number of frequent flyer miles you'll accumulate. Or ask how far is it between cities to solve your homework problems. You can lookup U.S. cities, or expand your search to get the world distance for international trips. You can also print out pages with a travel map."
