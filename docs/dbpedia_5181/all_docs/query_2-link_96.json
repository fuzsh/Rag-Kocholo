        "text": "Total nonfarm employment for the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX, metropolitan area increased by 68,000 over the year in May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Assistant Commissioner for Regional Operations Michael Hirniak noted that the local rate of job gain, 1.6 percent, compared to the 1.8-percent national increase. (See chart 1 and table 1.) (All data in this release are not seasonally adjusted; accordingly, over-the-year analysis is used throughout.)\n\nDallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX, is made up of two metropolitan divisions—separately identifiable employment centers within the greater metropolitan area. Employment in Dallas-Plano-Irving, with 72 percent of the area’s total nonfarm employment, stood at 3,071,600, a gain of 47,400 jobs over the year. Employment in Fort Worth-Arlington, TX, with 28 percent of the area’s employment, stood at 1,214,700 jobs.\n\nIndustry employment\n\nIn Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX, other services had the only significant gain (+7,600) among the metropolitan area’s private-industry supersectors. (See chart 2.) The 5.6-percent increase in the metropolitan area’s other services supersector compared to the 1.7-percent increase on a national level.\n\nTwelve largest metropolitan areas\n\nDallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX, was 1 of the nation’s 12 largest metropolitan statistical areas in May 2024. Six of twelve areas gained total nonfarm payroll employment over the year. The largest job gain occurred in New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA (+144,400). Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD (+44,300) had the smallest employment increase among the areas with significant changes. (See table 2 and chart 3.)\n\nHouston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX, had a 2.4-percent rate of job gain, followed by Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL (+2.3 percent), and Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ (+2.2 percent). New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA, and Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD, each reported a job gain of 1.4 percent.\n\nThe Metropolitan Area Employment and Unemployment release for June 2024 is scheduled to be released on Tuesday, July 30, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. (CT).\n\nTechnical Note\n\nThis release presents nonfarm payroll employment estimates from the CES program. The CES survey is a Federal-State cooperative endeavor between State employment security agencies and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. More information about the CES data is available in the State Employment and Unemployment Summary and the Metropolitan Area Employment and Unemployment Summary.\n\nDefinitions. Employment data refer to persons on establishment payrolls who receive pay for any part of the pay period which includes the 12th of the month. Persons are counted at their place of work rather than at their place of residence; those appearing on more than one payroll are counted on each payroll. Industries are classified on the basis of their principal activity in accordance with the 2022 version of the North American Industry Classification System.\n\nMethod of estimation. CES State and Area employment data are produced using several estimation procedures. Where possible these data are produced using a \"weighted link relative\" estimation technique in which a ratio of current-month weighted employment to that of the previous-month weighted employment is computed from a sample of establishments reporting for both months. The estimates of employment for the current month are then obtained by multiplying these ratios by the previous month's employment estimates. The weighted link relative technique is utilized for data series where the sample size meets certain statistical criteria. For some employment series, the estimates are produced with a model that uses direct sample estimates (described above) combined with other regressors to compensate for smaller sample sizes.\n\nAnnual revisions. Employment estimates are adjusted annually to a complete count of jobs, called benchmarks, derived principally from tax reports which are submitted by employers who are covered under state unemployment insurance (UI) laws. The benchmark information is used to adjust the monthly estimates between the new benchmark and the preceding one and also to establish the level of employment for the new benchmark month. Thus, the benchmarking process establishes the level of employment, and the sample is used to measure the month-to-month changes in the level for the subsequent months. Information on recent benchmark revisions is available in the CES State and Area benchmark article.\n\nReliability of the estimates. The estimates presented in this release are based on sample surveys, administrative data, and modeling and, thus, are subject to sampling and other types of errors. Sampling error is a measure of sampling variability—that is, variation that occurs by chance because a sample rather than the entire population is surveyed. Survey data also are subject to nonsampling errors, such as those which can be introduced into the data collection and processing operations. Estimates not directly derived from sample surveys are subject to additional errors resulting from the specific estimation processes used. The sums of individual items may not always equal totals shown in the same tables due to rounding.\n\nEmployment estimates. Changes in metropolitan area nonfarm payroll employment are cited in the analysis of this release only if they have been determined to be statistically significant at the 90-percent confidence level. Reliability of state and area estimates for the total nonfarm employment series are available for metropolitan areas and metropolitan divisions.\n\nArea definitions. The substate area data published in this news release reflect the delineations issued by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget on April 10, 2018. The 12 metropolitan areas discussed in this release are the metropolitan areas with the largest population according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington Metropolitan Statistical Area includes Collin, Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Hood, Hunt, Johnson, Kaufman, Parker, Rockwall, Somervell, Tarrant, and Wise Counties in Texas.\n\nThe Dallas-Plano-Irving Metropolitan Division includes Collin, Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Hunt, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties in Texas.\n\nThe Fort Worth-Arlington Metropolitan Division includes Hood, Johnson, Parker, Somervell, Tarrant, and Wise Counties in Texas.\n\nAdditional information\n\nEmployment data from the CES program are available on the BLS website at www.bls.gov/sae/.\n\nInformation in this release will be made available to individuals with sensory impairments upon request.
