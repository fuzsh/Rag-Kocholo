        "text": "Ellis County is located in north Central Texas and shares its borders with Dallas County to the north, Kaufman County to the east, Navarro and Hill Counties to the south, and Johnson County to the west. The county seat, Waxahachie, is also the largest municipality and is located on Interstate Highway 35-E, some 30 miles south of Dallas.\n\nThere are a variety of cultural events to attract visitors to our picturesque county throughout the year. Waxahachie is home to Bethlehem Revisited, an interactive re-creation of the city of Bethlehem as it was at the time of Christs birth. Bethlehem Revisited is rated as one of the top 10 things to see for Christmas in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.\n\nSpring visitors to Ellis County step back in time to the Renaissance era at Scarborough Faire near Maypearl or dance the night away at the National Polka Festival in Ennis. History and architecture enthusiasts enjoy the Bluebonnet Trail, the Gingerbread Trail, the Candlelight Tour of Homes, and the historic Chautauqua gathering.\n\nAs in the day when Cotton was King of Ellis County, the historic courthouse, built in the mid-1890s, still serves as a hub for all of our communities. An architectural masterpiece, the courthouse has been carefully restored and is in full use today. Visitors are invited to tour this impressive, nine-story structure on any business day, or participate in guided tours during festival weekends throughout the year. The Ellis County Museum, on the courthouse square, houses a wealth of information about the history of our county. County Judge Chad Adams"
