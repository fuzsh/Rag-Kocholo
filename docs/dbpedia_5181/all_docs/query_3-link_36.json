        "text": "Some North Texans were without electricity Monday after storms late last week and Sunday night caused outages.\n\nRoughly 2,300 customers were without power in Dallas County as of 2:45 p.m. Monday, according to Oncor’s outage map.\n\n“Oncor teams continue working around the clock to restore power to customers impacted by storms this past week,” an Oncor news release posted Monday morning read.\n\nOther nearby counties — including Denton, Ellis, Kaufman, Rockwall and Tarrant — reported fewer than 200 customers with outages. Collin County had about 250 customers without power as of early Monday afternoon.\n\nRelated:Rain likely Monday in North Texas, but drier days nearing 95 degrees possible this week\n\nIt’s been nearly a week since an initial round of severe storms tore down trees and power lines, impacting more than 600,000 customers.\n\nAs North Texans awoke last Tuesday to tornado sirens, pouring rain, strong winds and outages, Dallas County and utility officials warned that the electricity issues would be a multiday event because the damage was so widespread and additional storms slowed crews’ response times.\n\nOver the weekend, Oncor officials said in a news release on its website that the company expected to restore power to the majority of customers by Sunday.\n\nOther workers, including linemen and vegetation management crews, were brought in from across Texas and other states to quicken the restorations.\n\n“Oncor also greatly appreciates the support of our mutual assistance partners and the continued understanding and patience of our customers, especially in the face of such devastating back-to-back storm impacts and extended outages,” Monday’s release read.\n\nCustomers without power should examine the meter base and weatherhead to their home or business, according to the release. If it has been damaged or pulled off, an electrician must make necessary repairs before Oncor can restore power. A permit from the city may be required in some cases."
