        "text": "As I reflect on the last year, I am inspired by and grateful for the corporate and nonprofit partners, donors, volunteers and advocates who comprise the Live United movement. United, this unstoppable force for change improved access to education, income and health for 1.6 million North Texans.\n\nThis work is critically important. Even in a prosperous, growing region like North Texas, opportunity is not equal for everyone. Over the last year, our neighbors grappled with challenges old and new, including a difficult labor market, stubbornly high inflation and a growing housing crisis. Meanwhile, local communities of color experienced the sustained and systemic inequities that have persisted for generations, preventing far too many people from thriving.\n\nIn the face of these challenges, United Way continued to adapt and innovate, expanding existing initiatives and launching new programs to create transformational change. Together, with our dedicated corporate, philanthropic and community partners, we drove real, quantitative progress toward our Aspire United 2030 community goals and delivered on our commitment to advance racial equity.\n\nWe do this work to create lifelong change that transforms the entire trajectory of an individual, a family and a community. We focus on education, income and health because they are interconnected and interdependent: Children who enter school ready to learn are more likely to become strong readers, which in turn makes them more likely to succeed after high school. College graduates tend to earn more, which enables them to save for the future, and financially stable adults can cover the costs of healthcare and support their children’s success in school. This is the virtuous cycle that the Live United movement makes possible.\n\nThe extraordinary generosity of our donors is what fuels this lasting impact. Despite overall giving levels falling in cities across the U.S., philanthropy in North Texas remains strong. In our region, the Texas miracle is not just economic; it’s philanthropic. This is especially true of corporate giving in our region, as reinforced in a recent article in The Chronicle of Philanthropy, which highlighted United Way of Metropolitan Dallas as an organization that creates innovative programs and partnerships and builds relationships across the corporate landscape and all giving channels.\n\nThis year, we experienced generosity in all shapes and sizes, as the Live United movement came together to fuel more impact than ever before. Thousands of individual change-seekers from across North Texas invested in our cause, joining a community-wide movement that is committed to making our region more equitable for all. We were honored to receive a historic $15 million investment from The Perot Foundation—an unprecedented vote of confidence in our ability to drive measurable progress toward our goals. Meanwhile, $1 million donations each from Trinity Industries, Comerica Bank and Frito-Lay/PepsiCo marked an extraordinary start to our Centennial fundraising efforts.\n\nOur success over the past year was made possible by the inspiring leadership of our board chairs, Steven Williams, CEO, PepsiCo Foods North America; and Terri West, chair, Texas Instruments Foundation; as well as our annual campaign chair, Jean Savage, CEO of Trinity Industries.\n\nAs we continue to drive progress toward our Aspire United 2030 goals, we hope this Impact Report inspires each of you to pledge your support to the Live United movement and work together to improve access to education, income and health. Thank you for creating access and opportunity for all North Texans to thrive.\n\nWith gratitude,"
