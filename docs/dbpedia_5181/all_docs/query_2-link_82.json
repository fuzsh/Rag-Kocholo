        "text": "Dallas and its six surrounding counties are not only growing, but becoming more diverse, according to newly released population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nEvery year, the Bureau releases national estimates of population demographics over a five-year period in its American Community Survey, which covers more than 40 topics in every state, county and congressional district.\n\nDallas County’s population increased by about 30,000 people, according to the estimates. But the population growth in Dallas was far less than in surrounding counties with its population estimates increasing by just 1%.\n\nMeanwhile, Kaufman saw its population increase by more than 18%, and Rockwall, Ellis and Collin counties increased by more than 10%.\n\nTo conduct its analysis, The Dallas Morning News compared the newly released 5-Year 2017-2021 American Community Survey data to the 2012-2016 5-Year ACS data from the Census.\n\nHere’s what you should know about how Dallas-Fort Worth changed between 2016 and 2021, according to the Census estimates:\n\nSuburban North Texas counties grew the most\n\nWhen it comes to growth, Collin County had the largest total increase in its population of the seven counties, adding more than 100,000 residents, estimates show.\n\nDallas County experienced the smallest percentage change in its total population — in 2016 it was estimated to be 2,574,984. It topped off at 2,604,722 in 2021.\n\nDallas and Tarrant counties by far experienced the smaller percentage increased growth while Kaufman County saw the greatest percentage increase.\n\nKaufman County: 18.42% (+21,795 residents)\n\nRockwall County: 11.97% (+11,249 residents)\n\nEllis County: 11.56% (+19,485 residents)\n\nCollin County: 10.67% (+100,277 residents)\n\nDenton County: 9.78% (+78,832 residents)\n\nTarrant County: 3.72% (+75,081 residents)\n\nDallas County: 1.15% (+29,738 residents)\n\nRelated:Dallas County shrinks as North Texas’ population grows, census says\n\nThe Dallas Morning News’ recent series exploring 25 future boomtowns showed how communities around Dallas are preparing for the large influx of new residents, which is expected to continue at a fast pace in the coming years.\n\nAge was also a defining feature in two counties. Denton County got older as the median age increased from 35.1 to 36.2 years. By contrast, rapidly growing Kaufman County got younger. The median age decreased from 36 to about 35 years.\n\nNumber of residents identifying as multiracial boomed\n\nThe number of people identifying as more than one race in Kaufman County has not doubled or tripled, but multiplied by nearly six times in the past five years, according to the Census estimates. In Dallas, that number more than tripled, and other counties saw the estimate more than double.\n\nRace data is based on self-identification and the option to choose more than one race began with the 2000 Census, however, Census officials say recent increases in people reporting more than one race can be attributed to improvements in the Census’ questionnaire design, including having two separate questions for race and ethnicity.\n\nWith the new design, those of Hispanic or Latino origin were able to also answer a separate question to report their race as “Mexican,” “Hispanic,” “Latin American,” “Puerto Rican,” etc.\n\nThe uptick in racial diversity in North Texas mirrors nationwide trends, previous Census releases show.\n\nKaufman County: 499.09%\n\nDallas County: 233.14%\n\nTarrant County: 171.27\n\nEllis County: 162.03%\n\nRockwall County: 158.04%\n\nCollin County: 147.86%\n\nDenton County: 128.39%\n\nRelated:Once far-flung Dallas-Fort Worth communities are the region’s next boomtowns\n\nPopulations of color increase across counties\n\nFive area counties saw their Black populations increase by nearly 20% or more. In Kaufman County, the Black population grew from 12,733 residents to 19,113.\n\nIn Kaufman County, with a 2021 population estimate of 140,145, people of color saw much greater growth than white people. Those identifying as Black saw an increase of 50.10% percent, while American Indian or Alaska Natives (38.39%), Hispanic or Latino of any race (36.93%) and Asian (32.19%) also saw sizeable increases.\n\nDallas County, with a population of 2.6 million, became less white in the past five years. The white population went from nearly 1.6 million people to about 1.35 million, a 15% decrease. While its Black and Hispanic population remained roughly the same, the Native American population grew by nearly 119% – to 14,247 – residents, and the Asian population rose about 9%, according to Census estimates.\n\nTarrant County saw its white population decrease by about 9%. The county’s Black population increased by more than 10%, its Hispanic population rose by more than 7%, and Asian population was up by more than 8%. Tarrant also had about an 8% increase in its Native American population.\n\nIn Rockwall County, estimates of the Black, Asian and Hispanic populations saw more than a 20% increase, with its Native American population also growing and the white population seeing only a slight increase.\n\nRockwall County’s Black population grew by roughly 28%, followed by its Asian population at 27%, and Hispanic population at 23%. The county’s white population stayed about the same.\n\nCollin County saw the greatest increase in its Asian population among the seven North Texas counties analyzed by The News, increasing by more than 27%. Its Black population grew by over 19% and Hispanic population by nearly 14%. The county’s white population slightly decreased.\n\nEstimates in Denton County show an Asian population growing more than 31% while the Black population grew by more than 22% and the Hispanic population by more than 12%. Denton’s white population remained about the same."
