Pretty Girls Make Graves are calling it quits. A statement on their website made the announcement:

We are sorry to announce that our upcoming tour in May will be our last. Nick [Dewitt] quit the band and the rest of us feel like it wouldn't be right to continue on without him. The 5 of us feel very lucky to have met and worked with some truly amazing people over the years. Thank you all so muchâ€¦

The band signed to Matador in 2003, releasing two albums for the prominent indie label, The New Romance in 2003 and Elan Vital last year.
