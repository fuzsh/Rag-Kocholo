        "text": "Kill Sadie (also Killsadie) was a Minneapolis-based post-hardcore band active from 1997 to 2001. The band adopted the DIY ethic of constant touring, rather than other forms of promotion. Several members of the band went on to perform with better known emo, hardcore, and indie bands including Minus the Bear, Pretty Girls Make Graves and These Arms Are Snakes.[1][2]\n\nThe band formed in 1997 in the Twin Cities area (Minneapolis/St. Paul) of Minnesota. They departed from their roots in the hardcore scene to experiment with adding sonic presence, electronic beats and sampling, as well as multi-layered vocals, and their sound ranged from soft ethereal jazz to screaming hardcore.\n\nThe band's name was taken from an incident at a party. Drummer Erin Tate was told by his brother Knol (guitarist) that a girl named \"Sadie tried to kill [him]\". Tate responded that \"someone should kill Sadie\". The band's name can be rendered as two words (\"Kill Sadie\") or combined into a single word.\n\nThey band eventually disbanded due to a relocation from Minneapolis to Seattle, as well as disagreements about the future direction of the band.\n\nKillsadie's lineup changed several times due to touring and internal conflict.\n\nErin Tate - drums (Spring 1997-Fall 2001) later of Onalaska/Askeleton/Minus the Bear\n\nJ.
