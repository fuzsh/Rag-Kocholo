        "text": "Want vinyl packaging and custom vinyl pressing inspiration? Get a load of this!\n\nThis cardboard box contains a compilation of Pretty Girls Make Graves‘ first three 7″s which comprises the songs for their very first album, Good Health. This is a very special edition release because there are only 140 of these hand-numbered and silk screened cardboard boxes. What I love about it? First, it attempts to be eco-friendly. Second, the Velcro! Third, the lovely clash of the loud pastels and the earthy colors of the box.\n\nWe here at Unified are obsessed with beautiful vinyl packaging. We’ve been making creative releases since 2008 and lovely packaging has become an obsession of ours. We even have a Pinterest page dedicated to all things media packaging. If you want to make a really badass vinyl record with cool vinyl packaging, get a quote or shoot us an email.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nJames Hill is a veteran of the music industry.
