Oh... I could have been wild and I could have Been free But nature played this trick on me She wants it now And she will not wait But she's too rough And I'm too delicate Then, on the sand Another man, he takes her hand A smile lights up her stupid face (and well, it would) I lost my faith in womanhood I lost my faith in womanhood I lost my faith...
