        "text": "Street signs. Song lyrics. Even the name of a hated co-worker. These have been the origins of the names of some of the most well-known rock bands of the '80's/'90s northwest music scene.\n\nThe northwest music scene had a ton of goofy band names. Sex With Sarah, Quigzy Stick, Elvis Love Child, Bob's Your Uncle, Mona Lisa Overdrive, and Slam Suzanne were among actual bands that played during the grunge era. But even the better-known bands had stories behind their names.\n\nHere's the story behind how some bands, famous and not-so-famous, got their names. Have more to add to the list? Contact us at northwestpassage1@gmail.com.\n\nNorthwest Passage\n\nThis is an exploration of the northwest music scene that centered around, but not monopolized by, Seattle in the 80s and 90s.\n\nAs the northwest rock explosion took place before the advent of the Internet, there's only a loosely-connected network of websites and social media that cover the phenomenon on the web. This project is an attempt to bring it all together in one place.\n\nWhile this site certainly has a focus on the so-called \"grunge\" era, we aim to cover the entire spectrum of rock music throughout the region, from Portland to Olympia to Boise and all locales in between.
