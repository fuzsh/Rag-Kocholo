        "text": "Aretha Franklin. Singer. She received her international acclaimed as the “Queen of Soul” with her 18 Grammy award-winning hits sung with a bluesy, soulful voice that few could match in power and gusto. Her genre ranged from gospel to jazz, rhythm and blues to pop. In 1987 she was the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Her signature song and greatest hit, “Respect,” reigned during a turbulent era of racial tensions and became an anthem for women’s rights movements. According to MTV, the recording industry, and the National Endowment for the Arts, “Respect” ranks in the top five songs of the Twentieth Century. Wrote and originally released by Otis Redding in 1965, she released it in 1967 as her first Grammy-winning song. Since this song is “culturally, historically, or aesthetically important and reflect life in the United States, “Respect” is listed on the registry as provided by the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000. Another one of her 1967 hits was written by Carol King, “You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman,” which reached #8 on the Billboard Top 100 Pop Hits. At the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors, she performed it to honor award-recipient Carol King. Being one of five children, Aretha Louise Franklin was the daughter of Rev. C.L. Franklin, a charismatic preacher at New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit, Michigan. He was a confidant of Martin Luther King, Jr. At the age of 14 years old, she made her first album, “Spirituals” in 1956 as a gospel artist; this was re-released in 1962. Although Motown Records was interested in signing her, she went with the Columbia label for the first half of the 1960s with an occasional R&B hit but never breaking into stardom. Upon leaving Columbia in the late 1960s for the Atlantic label, she was teamed with a R&B group from Alabama, the Muscle Shoals Sounds Rhythm Section, and was often on the keyboard accompanying herself. She gained international success with 10 recordings on the Top Ten Chart in a 18-month period between early spring of 1967 to late 1968 along with a steady stream of hits for the next five years. Released in 1967, “Chain of Fools”was #1 on the R&B chart, #2 on the Pop Chart, received a Grammy Award for Best R&B Female Performance, later Grammy Hall of Fame Award and became an anthem for those serving in the Vietnam War. Besides her R&B and Gospel hits, she had a wide range of songs with first-class originals and through the years, covered other artists’ songs from Adele, the Beatles, Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, the Drifters, Barbara Streisand, Gladys Knight, to Simon & Garfunkel. In the 1970s, she had commercial and artistic success with huge hits such as “Spanish Harlem,” “Bridge Over Troubled Water” and “Day Dreaming.” Two of her most respected albums were “Live at Fillmore West” and “Amazing Grace,” a two record album in 1972 with James Cleveland and the Southern California Community Choir, which was one of the greatest gospel crossover hits to reach the pop charts. Her Atlantic Records contract ended at the end of the 1970s, and she signed with Clive Davis’ recording label, Arista. By 1979 she had released nineteen albums. That same year, her father received a gunshot wound during a armed home invasion, leaving him in a coma that he never recovered. During the 1980s, she recorded “Get It Right” and Grammy-winning “Freeway of Love” along with duets such as with “I Knew You Were Waiting for Me,” with George Michael. In July 1982 Luther Vandross wrote, produced and performed on her first gold album in six years, “Jump to It”. She released another gospel album hit in 1987, “One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism.” She contributed songs for several movie soundtracks including “A Rose Is Still A Rose” in 1998. The album, “So Damn Happy” was released in 2003 with poor sales rankings but generated the Grammy-winning song, “Wonderful.” In 2003 she left Arista and two years later started her own label, Aretha’s Records. In 2007 she released a compilation of duets, “Jewels in the Crown: All-star Duets and the Queen.” The next year she released her first holiday album, “This Christmas.” After recuperating from major health declines in 2010, she released her first album in 2011 on her own label, “A Woman Falling Out of Love.” At that point, she signed with the RCA label with Clive Davis and released “Babyface.” Then she released “Aretha Franklin: Sings Divia Classics,” which covered Adele’s “Rolling in the Deep,” Diana Ross’, “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” Gloria Gaylor’s “I’ll Survive,” and Alicia Keys’, “No One.” She was the recipient of the Grammy Legend Award in 1991, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994, and the Grammy MusiCares Person of the Year Award in 2008. She performed at the inaugurations of United States Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and was the honored recipient of the Presidential Medal of Honor from President George W. Bush. She performed at the 25th annual gala for the AIDS Foundation in fall of 2017 and supported other worthy charities such as Feeding America, Childhood Diabetes, Special Olympics and many more. Pancreatic cancer of the “neuroendocrine type” was her official cause of death as reported by her private oncologist.\n\nHank Williams, Sr. Singer, Songwriter. He received international acclaim for his traditional-style country music sung with his bluesy, Honk a Tonk voice. Having a dozen singles to reach #1 on the Top Ten, the list of his hits is long, given that he lived only 29 years. A example of early Rock n Roll, “Move It On Over” was released in June 1947 reaching #4 on the American Billboard Chart. Although not written by Williams, “Lovesick Blues” was the first song he sung on the Louisiana Hayride, a popular country music radio show aired in Shreveport, Louisiana. With an outstanding success, he recorded it the next year. Written in 1949, “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry” is listed #111 on Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and the oldest song on the list. It ranked #3 on the Greatest Country Songs of All Time. Recorded on May 5, 1951, “Cold, Cold Heart” reached #1 on the Country Music charts and was later covered with a pop version by Tony Bennett. Also recorded in 1951 and reaching the #1 slot, “Hey Good Lookin” was inducted in the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001. “Jambalaya” was recorded in 1952 and reached the #1 slot. Recorded just weeks before his death, “Your Cheatin’ Heart” was one of five songs released posthumously, and it served as the title of the 1964 film version of his life, which starred George Hamilton. He was the first country music superstar to sell 10 million records from 1947 to 1953. The lyrics of his songs have become classic and are still best-sellers. Born Hiram Williams, the youngest son to Alonzo Williams and his wife Jessie Lillybelle Skipper, he was introduced to music at church where his mother played the organ. Since his father was employed by the railroads, the family traveled from town to town throughout Alabama. Many people influenced his informal musical education. While living with his aunt and uncle, his aunt taught him how to play the guitar. Rufus Payne, an area African American blues street musician taught him and led him to a career in the music profession. In Montgomery, Alabama as a teenager he would sing and play his Sear’s Silvertone guitar on the sidewalks for money with his favorite spot being at the front door of the radio station WSFA. Noticing his talent the station manager invited him inside to play on the air. Public interest in the form of letters and phone calls led him to his own fifteen-minute show, twice a week and changing his name to “Hank Williams.” Quitting high school before graduation, he formed a band, the “Drifting Cowboys,” and while still employed at the radio station, they played for parties and gatherings throughout Alabama. At the start of World War II, his entire band was drafted but Hank was declared unfit to serve due having a “bad back.” He began using alcohol and prescription drugs to alleviate the pain. Being habitually drunk impacted his ability to work and he was fired from the radio station and his band suffered. When he was fired from the Grand Ole Opry for being drunk, his band left him. His first marriage to Audrey Sheppard dissolved in the spring of 1952 because of his drinking; many of the melancholy lyrics on his songs were written during this time. The couple had one son, Hank Williams, Jr., who has become a country music star in his own right. Hank fathered a daughter during a relationship and she was born five days after his death. On October 18, 1952, he married Billie Jean Jones Eshliman; this was the second marriage for each. On December 31, 1952, an ice storm kept him from flying to a concert in West Virginia. To keep a concert date in Clanton, Ohio, he decided to have a friend, Charles Carr, drive his 1952 Cadillac while he rode in the back seat drinking and writing songs. Reaching Knoxville, Tennessee, Carr summoned a physician since there was a change in Williams’ behavior. Clearing him to finish the trip, the physician injected him with vitamins and Morphine. They continued the road trip until midnight when Carr asked Williams if he wanted anything to eat and the reply was , “No.” Then Carr drove until Oak Hill, Virginia where he stopped for gas. At this point, he realized that William was not sleeping but had died in the back seat of the car some time earlier. His funeral was held at the Montgomery Civic Center Auditorium with 25,000 people standing outside the building to listen to the funeral being broadcast. Country music stars, Roy Acuff, Red Foley, and Ernest Tubb sung during the service. The Alabama Bureau of Tourism and Travel promotes their famous country singer with the “Hank Williams Trail,” which includes his home place, the Hank Williams Museum, Lincoln Cemetery and a life-sized statue adjacent to the Montgomery City Hall. He was inducted in the Grand Ole Opry in 1949, the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1961, the Alabama Music Hall of Fame in 1985, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. The Broadway play “Hank Williams: Lost Highway” was a tribute to him as was the 2006 movie, “Crazy.” He is pictured on the 29 cent United States commemorative postage stamp in the Legends of American Music series, which were issued on September 25, 1993.\n\nPatsy Cline. Country Music Singer, Songwriter, and Pioneer. She has been acclaimed, by fans, colleagues and music critics alike, as one of the most influential and unique vocalists in the history of modern music. She is often credited as a heroine by newer generations of female singers, who claim she opened doors to them in a business dominated by men in a career that only spanned five short years. She was best known for her rich tone, emotionally expressive and bold contralto voice. Born Virginia Patterson Hensley, her father was a blacksmith and her mother was a 16-year-old seamstress, and was the oldest of three children. She became familiar with music at an early age, singing in church with her mother. When her father left, she was forced to drop out of high school and work odd jobs to help support her family. After several weeks of watching performers through the window at her local radio station, she asked WINC-AM disc jockey and talent coordinator Jimmy McCoy if she could sing on his show. Her first performance on radio in 1947 was so well received that she was requested to come back and sing again. This led to performances at local nightclubs, wearing fringed Western stage outfits that her mother made from Patsy’s designs. She started singing in variety and talent showcases in and around the Winchester, Virginia and Tri-State area, and coupled with increasing appearances on local radio, she soon attracted a large following. In 1954 Jimmy Dean, a young country star in his own right, learned of her and she became a regular with Dean on Connie B. Gay’s “Town and Country Jamboree” radio show, airing weekday afternoons live on WARL-AM in Arlington, Virginia. In September 1953 she married Gerald Cline, a contractor who was considerably older than her and divorced him four years later due to her desire to sing professionally and his wish that she become a housewife. A few months later she married Charlie Dick, a linotype operator, with whom she would have two children. In 1955 her manager, Bill Peer, got her a contract at Four Star Records, the label with which he was then affiliated and also gave her the first name of Patsy, from her middle name and her mother’s maiden name, Patterson. She was limited to recording songs composed by Four Star writers which she found unfulfilling. Her first record was “A Church, A Courtroom & Then Good-Bye,” which attracted little attention but it led to appearances on the Grand Ole Opry. In the late fall of 1956, she auditioned for “Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts” in New York City, New York and was accepted to sing on the CBS-TV show on January 21, 1957. She was originally supposed to sing “A Poor Man’s Roses (Or a Rich Man’s Gold),” but the show’s producers insisted she sing “Walkin’ After Midnight” instead. Though heralded as a country song, recorded in Nashville, Godfrey’s staff insisted that Cline appear in a cocktail dress rather than in one of her mother’s hand-crafted cowgirl outfits. The audience’s enthusiastic ovations pushed the applause meter to its apex, winning the competition for her. After the Godfrey show, listeners began calling their local radio stations to request the song, and she released it as a single. The song reached Number 2 on the country charts and Number 12 on the pop charts, making her one of the first country singers to have a crossover pop hit. From 1955 to 1957 she recorded honky-tonk songs like “Fingerprints,” “Pick Me Up on Your Way Down,” “Don’t Ever Leave Me Again,” and “A Stranger in My Arms,” with her co-writing the latter two. In 1958, after the birth of her daughter Julie, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee. In 1959 she met Randy Hughes, a session guitarist and promotion man, and he became her manager and helped her change labels. When her Four Star contract expired in 1960, she signed with Decca Records. The same year, she realized a lifelong dream when the Grand Ole Opry accepted her request to join the cast, making her the only person to achieve membership in such a fashion, and became one of the Opry’s biggest stars. During this time she befriended and encouraged female country music star newcomers Loretta, Lynn, Dottie West, Jan Howard, and Barbara Mandrell. Her first release for Decca was the country pop ballad “I Fall to Pieces” (1961). The song was promoted and won great success on both country and pop music stations. On the country charts, the song slowly climbed to the top, garnering her first Number One ranking. In a major feat for country singers at the time, the song hit Number 12 on the pop and Number 6 on the adult contemporary charts, making her a household name and demonstrating that women could achieve as much crossover success as men. She was known to be generous with her friends, buying them groceries and furniture, hiring them as wardrobe assistants, and occasionally paying their rent in order for them to stay in Nashville to pursue their dreams. In June 1961 she and her brother Sam were involved in a head-on collision in Nashville. The impact threw her into the windshield, nearly killing her. When help arrived, she insisted that the other car’s driver be treated first. She spent a month in the hospital, suffering from a jagged cut across her forehead that required stitches, a broken wrist, and a dislocated hip. When she left the hospital, her forehead was visibly scarred and for the remainder of her career, she wore wigs and makeup to hide the scars, along with headbands to relieve the forehead pressure that caused headaches if left unattended. Six weeks later, she returned to the road on crutches with a new appreciation for life. Unable to capitalize upon the success of “I Fall to Pieces” due to her hospital stay, she sought another recording to reestablish herself. When introduced to “Crazy”, a song written by Willie Nelson, she expressed a vehement dislike for the composition and the inaugural recording session was unsuccessful. With her ribs still hurting from the car accident, she was unable to reach the high notes. However, after several other attempts and a different approach to the instrumental recording of the track, coupled with a week’s further healing of her ribs, she was able to reach the high notes and recorded her part in a single take. “Crazy” would ultimately become her signature song and by late 1961, it was a crossover success, straddling the country and pop genres, and reached the Top 10 on the both charts. It became her biggest pop hit, with it reaching Number 9 on the US Hot 100 and Number 2 on both the Hot Country Songs and the Adult Contemporary lists. In 1961 she became the first woman in country music to perform at New York’s Carnegie Hall and the following year she headlined the famous Hollywood Bowl with Johnny Cash and became the first woman in country music to headline her own show in Las Vegas at the Mint Casino. In January 1962 she released “She’s Got You,” another crossover hit, reaching Number 14 on the pop charts, Number 3 on the adult contemporary charts (originally called “Easy Listening”), and as her second and final chart-topper, Number 1 on the country chart. She would never again enter the pop charts during her lifetime. Following this success, she released a string of smaller country hits, including the Top 10 “When I Get Thru’ With You,” “Imagine That,” “So Wrong,” and “Heartaches”. In late 1962 she appeared on Dick Clark’s “American Bandstand” and released her third album, “Sentimentally Yours” in August of that year. On March 3, 1963 she performed at a benefit at the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, Kansas City, Kansas for the family of disc jockey “Cactus” Jack Call, who had died in an automobile crash a little over a month earlier. She was unable to fly out the next day because the Fairfax Airport in Kansas City, Kansas was fogged in. Declining a car ride back to Nashville with country singer Dottie West and her husband, she boarded a Piper PA-24 Comanche plane, along with country performers Hawkshaw Hawkins and Cowboy Copas, and her manager Hughes, who was the pilot but was not trained in instrument flying. After making a fuel stop in Missouri and another landing at Dyersburg Municipal Airport in Dyersburg, Tennessee, the plane departed for Cornelia Fort Airpark, near Nashville, against the advice of the airfield manager. The flight encountered inclement weather and crashed in a forest near Camden, Tennessee on the evening of March 5, 1963, killing all on board. She was 30 years old and was one of the most influential, successful and acclaimed female vocalists of the 20th century. In 1973, she became the first female solo act to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In 1985, a full length feature film and box office smash, “Sweet Dreams”, told her life story and revitalized interest in her music. Among her numerous posthumous awards, including a US Postal Stamp in 1993 and a 1995 Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award. Her “Greatest Hits” album, released in 1967, continues to occasionally appear on the country music charts and was the longest album to stay on the country charts in country music history until Garth Brooks surpassed it in the 1990s. The album still holds the record for remaining on the country charts by a female artist. In 1999, she was voted Number 11 on VH1’s special, “The 100 Greatest Women in Rock and Roll,” by members and artists of the rock music industry. In 2002, country music artists and industry members voted her Number One on Country Music Television’s “The 40 Greatest Women of Country Music” and ranked 46th in the “100 Greatest Singers of All Time” issue of Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nLouise Scruggs, a pioneering businesswoman in Nashville and wife of Country Music Hall of Fame member Earl Scruggs.\n\nBorn Ann Louise Certain, she grew up near Lebanon, Tenn. While attending the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville in 1946, she first saw Scruggs and heard his groundbreaking style of three-fingered banjo playing while he was working with Bill Monroe’s Blue Grass Boys. The couple married in 1948 — the same year Scruggs and guitarist Lester Flatt left Monroe’s band in 1948 to form their own group, the Foggy Mountain Boys.\n\nIn 1956, Mrs. Scruggs became one of Nashville’s pioneer female executives when she began serving as Flatt & Scruggs’ business and booking manager. In addition to booking the band, she aggressively promoted the act within the folk music community and helped inspire the band’s series of concept albums, including Songs of the Famous Carter Family and Folk Songs of Our Land.\n\nIn her greatest career accomplishment, Mrs. Scruggs took Flatt & Scruggs — and bluegrass music — to a mainstream audience and managed to turn the musical duo into TV stars. In the earliest days of the folk music boom, Flatt & Scruggs toured with Joan Baez and performed at the Newport Folk Festival and other prestigious festivals. At a time when country acts seldom played in major venues in New York, they recorded a live album at Carnegie Hall. When Mrs. Scruggs began booking Flatt & Scruggs onto the college campus circuit in the 1950s and 1960s, she helped turn them into the equivalent of modern-day rock stars. They followed up the At Carnegie Hall album with another live album recorded at Nashville’s Vanderbilt University.\n\nShe also launched Flatt & Scruggs’ music into the worlds of television and movies, although she initially rejected overtures from Paul Henning, the creator of The Beverly Hillbillies. When Henning wanted to feature the duo’s music in the television series, she was concerned the show’s image would be bad for country music.\n\nAfter flying to Nashville, Henning convinced her that association would not be detrimental to country music or Flatt & Scruggs’ career. With lyrics by Henning, “The Ballad of Jed Clampett” was recorded as the show’s theme song. Flatt & Scruggs’ recording of the song became a No. 1 hit — and the series is still running in syndication today. Henning also cast Flatt & Scruggs as themselves in several episodes of the popular program.\n\nFlatt & Scruggs’ profile was boosted again when actor-director Warren Beatty chose their 1949 recording of the banjo instrumental “Foggy Mountain Breakdown” for his 1967 film, Bonnie & Clyde.\n\nWhen Flatt & Scruggs parted company in 1969, Mrs. Scruggs helped reinvent her husband’s career when he and their sons — Randy, Gary and Steve — began exploring stronger rock influences in the Earl Scruggs Revue. One of her first accomplishments was a PBS special that featured the Scruggs family in informal performances with Bob Dylan, Linda Ronstadt, the Byrds and others. The foray into the rock world led to Mrs. Scruggs guiding her husband to work with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band on the landmark album, Will the Circle Be Unbroken.\n\nIn addition to overseeing routine business matters, her eye for detail led her to enlist artist Thomas B. Allen to create original paintings for the covers of 17 Flatt & Scruggs’ albums. The distinctive style created an original and unique look that set them apart on the record racks at retail stores. She also co-wrote several songs recorded by Flatt & Scruggs.\n\nFrank Sinatra. Entertainer. Regarded by many as the greatest popular singer of the 20th Century, he was nicknamed “The Voice”, “Ol Blue Eyes” and “Chairman of the Board”. Born Francis Albert Sinatra in Hoboken, New Jersey, the son and only child of an Italian immigrant fireman, his mother Dolly was a midwife. Legend has it that one day he heard Bing Crosby singing and decided this would be the career path he was to embark upon. His initial break came in 1935, when he received first prize in a radio contest. He eventually caught the attention of bandleader Harry James, resulting in their collaboration, which included his first recordings in 1939 and moved onto the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra with whom he recorded the hit “I’ll Never Smile Again” (1941). He would also marry his first wife Nancy and their union produced his children Nancy, Frank, Jr. and Tina. By the second half of the decade, he launched his Hollywood career with singing and dancing, as well as acting roles in several memorable pictures including “On the Town” (1949), co-starring with Gene Kelly, which featured the score “New York, New York”. In 1950, his career endured a major setback, when he suffered a hemorrhaged vocal cord due to his extreme concert schedule, which resulted in his hiatus from singing for a period. Sinatra turned what could have been a detrimental blow to his career into a positive, as he focused on his acting skills. During that time, he divorced Nancy and married one of Hollywood’s top actress Ava Gardner. His breakthrough role as an actor would be his playing the doomed Angelo Maggio in the Oscar-garnered “From Here to Eternity” (1953), for which he received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and earned respect as an accomplished dramatic performer. This was followed by “Guys and Dolls” (1955), “The Man With the Golden Arm” (1955, which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor playing heroin addict Frankie Machine), “The Joker Is Wild” (1957), “Pal Joey” (1957) and “The Manchurian Candidate” (1962). His singing career was also back on track, this time with a richer vocal style heard in the hits “In the Wee Small Hours” (1956), “Come Fly With Me” (1956), “Nice n’ Easy” (1960), “My Way” (1969) and “Theme From New York New York” (1980). By the end of the 1950s, he had divorced Ava Gardner and established an exclusive circle of friends unofficially called “The Rat Pack”, which included Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop (among the films they starred in are the original “Ocean’s Eleven” (1960) and Sergeant’s 3″ (1962), becoming a bill-topping act in Las Vegas. During this period, Sinatra established the Reprise record label. He received Grammy Awards for the singles “It Was a Very Good Year” (1966) and “Strangers in the Night” (1967), also for the albums “September of My Years” and “A Man and His Music” (1967). While filming “Von Ryan’s Express” (1965), he met actress Mia Farrow, whom he married in 1966 (until 1968). He had a brief retirement during the early 1970s, only to return and marry Barbara Marx (who was formerly married to Zeppo Marx of the Marx Brothers) in 1976. In 1988, there would be a brief reunion and tour of the “Rat Pack” and during the 1990s more success with his “Duets” recordings. Not long after celebrating his 80th birthday in 1995, his health began to decline as he suffered a heart attack in November 1996 and a fatal one on May 14th, 1998.\n\nBilly Davis. Songwriter, Record Producer, and Singer. He contributed to a number of soul hits and some of the most popular commercial jingles, mostly for Coca-Cola. Davis’ career in music began with an early version of The Four Tops called “The Four Aims” which included his cousin the late Lawrence Payton. Davis sometimes sang with the group as the fifth Aim while they were affiliated with Chess Records (before Motown). Although Chess Records was more impressed Davis’ writing skill than the group, his persistence convinced the record label to sign the group in 1956.In the late 1950s, he and collaborator Berry Gordy wrote a number of hit songs for another cousin Jackie Wilson. They penned the hits ‘Reet Petite’, ‘To Be Loved’, ‘Lonely Teardrops’, ‘I’ll Be Satisfied’, ‘I’m Wanderin’, and ‘That’s Why I Love You So.’ The most notable of these, “Lonely Teardrops”, was written by Davis, Gordy, and Gordy’s sister Gwen, who was Davis’ girlfriend at the time. Davis and Gwen Gordy later founded the Anna record label, which was the distributor of the early singles from Berry Gordy’s Tamla (later Motown) label.By the mid-1960s, Davis was in charge of the A&R and creative departments at Chess Records, supervising the in-house songwriters and producers. During this period, he wrote and produced for many artists, including The Dells, Billy Stewart, Jackie Ross, and Fontella Bass, whose 1965 “Rescue Me” was Davis’ biggest hit. He also worked alongside the Dells and Little Milton and wrote songs for Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, James Brown, The Supremes and Gladys Knight.Davis’s success garnered him a position writing and producing jingles at the McCann-Erickson advertising agency, where he eventually rose to Senior Vice-President and Music Director. While at McCann-Erickson, Davis’s primary client was The Coca-Cola Company, for which he wrote and produced the famous jingle “I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)”, used in a 1971 Coca-Cola television advertisement. He also wrote and produced other jingles such as “It’s the Real Thing” and “Things Go Better With Coke” for Coca-Cola, and “If You’ve Got the Time” for Miller Beer.\n\nLawrence Payton. R&B Singer. A member of the musical group, ‘The Four Tops.’ The group was formed in Detroit, Michigan, and included Renaldo Benson, Abdul Fakir, and Levi Stubbs. The friends met while attending different high schools. In 1953 or 1954 they began performing together under the name, ‘The Four Aims’ later changing it to ‘The Four Tops’ when they signed to the Chess Record Label in 1956, with the help of Payton’s cousin, Roquel Davis, who joined the group as a songwriter. For Chess they recorded the song, “Kiss Me Baby” but it was a flop and went onto record with the Red Top and Riverside Record Labels. In 1960 they signed with Columbia and had a better success with jazz and pop music. In 1963 they recorded with Berry Gordy’s Label, and released the album, ‘Breaking Through.’ Gordy later put them back into R&B material and put them with Motown’s Holland-Dozier-Holland writing team. After a full decade the group had numerous hits including “Baby I Need Your Lovin’,” a Top Ten hit in 1964, “Ask The Lonely,” a hit in 1965, “I Can’t Help Myself (Sugarpie, Honeybunch),” #1 in the spring of 1965, “It’s The Same Old Song,” a Top Five hit in 1965, “Reach Out, I’ll Be There,” one of their finest singles ever, released in 1966, “Standing In The Shadows Of Love,” a Top Ten hit in 1967, “Bernadette,” a Top Five hit in 1967, “7 Rooms of Gloom,” a Top Twenty hit in 1967, “You Keep Running Away,” a Top Twenty hit in 1967, and two 1968 hits, “If I Were A Carpenter” and “Walk Away Renee.” In 1970 they joined producer Frank Wilson and they recorded a pop standard of Tommy Edward’s, “It’s All In The Game” and a ballad with ‘the Supremes’ entitled, “River Deep, Mountain High” in 1971. In 1972 they left Motown and joined ABC-Dunhill, teaming up with Dennis Lambert and Brian Potter, and released, “Keeper Of The Castle” a Top Ten hit, and “Ain’t No Woman (Like The One I’ve Got)” a smash hit that was their last Top Five Pop hit. In 1973 they recorded the theme song for the film, “Shaft In Africa” and released the song, “Catfish” in 1976. In 1981 they signed with the Casablanca Record Label and released, “When She Was My Girl” a Top Ten hit. In 1983 they rejoined Motown and in 1988 left and signed with Arista Records, where they recorded, “Indestructible” a Top 40 Pop hit,which was their last. In 1990 they were inducted into the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame. Payton died in June 1997 of cancer and was replaced by Theo Peoples.\n\nJohn Denver. Singer, Musician, Songwriter, Actor, Environmentalist, and Humanitarian. One of the most popular acoustic artists of the 1970s, he recorded and released nearly 300 songs, of which 200 of them he composed. His career spanned nearly three decades and his music appeared on a variety of charts, including Country and Western, the Billboard Hot 100, and Adult Contemporary, in all earning him 14 gold and eight platinum albums in the US alone, with his signature songs “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” “Annie’s Song,” “Rocky Mountain High,” and “Sunshine on My Shoulders.” Born Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr., his father was a US Air Force officer who set three speed records in the B-58 Hustler bomber aircraft and earned a place in the Air Force Hall of Fame. He received his love and devotion to music from his maternal grandmother, who gave him his first acoustical guitar. His family moved frequently due to his father’s military career and as a introverted child, he never felt that he belonged to any particular place. When he was a teenager, his family moved to Fort Worth, Texas, where he attended and graduated from Arlington Heights High School. He attended Texas Tech University at Lubbock, Texas where he studied architecture. By the time he was in college, he learned to play guitar well enough to perform at local clubs. He adopted the surname “Denver” after the capital of his favorite state, Colorado. He decided to change his name when Randy Sparks, founder of The New Christy Minstrels, suggested that “Deutschendorf” wouldn’t fit comfortably on a marquee. While at Texas Tech, he sang in a folk-music group called “The Alpine Trio.” In 1963 he dropped out of college and moved to Los Angeles, California, where he sang in folk clubs. In 1965 he joined the Chad Mitchell Trio, a folk group that had been renamed The Mitchell Trio prior to Chad Mitchell’s departure and before Denver’s arrival, and then became Denver, Boise, and Johnson (John Denver, David Boise, and Michael Johnson). In 1969 he decided to pursue a solo career and released his first album for RCA Records, “Rhymes & Reasons.” Two years earlier, he had made a self-produced demo recording of some of the songs he played at his concerts, including the song called “Babe I Hate to Go”, later renamed “Leaving on A Jet Plane”. The song came to the attention of Milt Okun, who produced records for the Mitchell Trio and the high-profile folk group Peter, Paul and Mary, and had become Denver’s producer as well. Okun brought the unreleased “Jet Plane” song to Peter, Paul and Mary and their version of the song hit Number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1969. In 1970 he recorded two more albums with RCA, “Take Me to Tomorrow” and “Whose Garden Was This.” His next album, “Poems, Prayers, and Promises” (1971), was a breakthrough for him in the US, thanks in part to the single “Take Me Home, Country Roads”, which went to Number 2 on the Billboard charts despite the first pressings of the track being distorted. Its success was due in part to the efforts of his new manager, future Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub, who signed him in 1970. Weintraub insisted on a re-issue of the track and began a radio-airplay campaign that started in Denver, Colorado. His career boomed and he had a series of hits over the next four years. In 1972 he scored his first Top Ten album with “Rocky Mountain High,” with its title track reaching the Top Ten in 1973. Between 1973 and 1975, he experienced an impressive chart dominance, with a string of four Number 1 songs (“Sunshine on My Shoulders,” “Annie’s Song,” “Thank God I’m a Country Boy,” and “I’m Sorry”) and three Number 1 albums (“John Denver’s Greatest Hits” (1973), “Back Home Again” (1974), and “Windsong” (1975)). After appearing as a guest on many shows, he went on to host his own variety/music specials, including several concerts from Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Denver, Colorado. His seasonal special, “Rocky Mountain Christmas,” was watched by more than 60 million people and was the highest-rated show for the ABC network at that time. His live concert special, “An Evening with John Denver,” won the 1974-1975 Emmy for Outstanding Special, Comedy-Variety or Music. He also a guest starred on “The Muppet Show,” the beginning of the lifelong friendship between him and Jim Henson that spawned two television specials with The Muppets. In 1974 he received the Academy of Country Music Album of the Year Award for “Back Home Again” and in 1975 he received the Country Music Association’s Entertainer of the Year award and also received its Song of the Year Award for “Back Home Again.” The same year, he received American Music Award’s Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist and the following year he received the American Music Award’s Favorite Country Album for “Back Home Again” and Favorite Country Male Artist. He tried his hand at acting, appearing in the “The Colorado Cattle Caper” episode of the “McCloud” television movie in February 1974, the television special “Foxfire” (1987) with Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, and starred in the 1977 film “Oh, God!” opposite George Burns. He hosted the Grammy Awards five times in the 1970s and 1980s and guest-hosted “The Tonight Show” on multiple occasions. In the mid-1970s he became outspoken in politics and the environment. He expressed his ecologic interests in the epic 1975 song “Calypso,” which is an ode to the exploration ship and team of environmental activist Jacques Cousteau. In 1976 he campaigned for Jimmy Carter and was a supporter of the Democratic Party and of a number of charitable causes for the environmental movement, the homeless, the poor, the hungry, and the African AIDS crisis. The same year, he founded the charitable Windstar Foundation to promote sustainable living. His dismay at the Russian Chernobyl disaster led to precedent-setting concerts in parts of communist Asia and Europe. In 1977 he was named Poet Laureate of Colorado and also received a People’s Choice Award. He had a few more US Top 30 hits as the 1970s ended, but nothing to match his earlier success. He began to focus more on humanitarian and sustainability causes, focusing extensively on conservation projects. During the 1980s he was critical of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Administration, but he remained active in his campaign against world hunger, for which Reagan awarded him the Presidential World Without Hunger Award in 1985. His criticism of the conservative politics of the 1980s was expressed in his autobiographical folk-rock ballad “Let Us Begin (What Are We Making Weapons For).” He was also critical of the Republican-dominated Congress and American Conservatism of the 1990s. He denounced the National Rifle Association as a corrupt political machine that could buy off politicians, and in an open letter to the media, he wrote that he opposed oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He had battled to expand the refuge in the 1980s, and he praised President Bill Clinton for his opposition to the proposed drilling. He had an innate love of flying which was secondary only to his love for music. A pilot with over 2,700 hours of experience, he had pilot license ratings for single-engine land and sea, multi-engine land, glider, and instrument. He collected vintage biplanes, and in 1974, he bought a Learjet, which he used to fly himself to concerts. He also bought a Christen Eagle aerobatic plane, two Cessna 210 and in 1997, an experimental, amateur-built Rutan Long-EZ. He was attracted to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and became dedicated to America’s work in outer space. He conscientiously worked to help bring into being the “Citizens in Space” program. In 1985 he received the NASA Public Service Medal for “helping to increase awareness of space exploration by the peoples of the world,” an award usually restricted to spaceflight engineers and designers. The same year, he passed NASA’s rigorous physical exam and was in line for a space flight, a finalist for the first citizen’s trip on the Space Shuttle in 1986, but was not chosen. After the Challenger disaster with teacher Christa McAuliffe aboard, he dedicated his song “Flying for Me” to all astronauts, and he continued to support NASA. In 1994 he published his autobiography, “Take Me Home,” in which he candidly spoke of his marijuana, LSD, and cocaine use, his marital infidelities, and his history of domestic violence. In 1996, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 1997 he recorded a children’s train album for Sony Wonder, titled “All Aboard!” which consisted of old-fashioned swing, big band, folk, bluegrass, and gospel styles of music woven into a theme of railroad songs. The album won him a posthumous Best Musical Album For Children Grammy Award, which was his only Grammy. He was first married to Annie Martell and following the success of “Rocky Mountain High,” he purchased a residence in Aspen, Colorado and owned one home in Aspen continuously until his death. He and his first wife divorced in 1982 and the ensuing property settlement caused him to become so enraged he nearly choked his ex-wife, then used a chainsaw to cut the marital bed in half. He married actress Cassandra Delaney in 1988 and they separated in 1991, divorcing in 1993. In 1993 he pleaded guilty to a drunken driving charge, and was placed on probation. The following year, while still on probation, he was again charged with misdemeanor driving under the influence after crashing his Porsche into a tree in Aspen. In 1996 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) decided that he could no longer fly a plane due to medical disqualification for failure to abstain from alcohol, a condition that the FAA had imposed in October 1995 after his prior drunk-driving conviction. He died at the age of 53 when his experimental Rutan Long-EZ aircraft crashed into the Pacific Ocean near Pacific Grove, California, while making a series of touch-and-go landings at the nearby Monterey Peninsula Airport. Post-accident investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board showed that the leading cause of the accident was his inability to safely execute a switch of fuel tanks in flight. On March 12, 2007, the Colorado Senate passed a resolution to make his trademark 1972 hit “Rocky Mountain High” one of the state’s two official state songs, sharing duties with its predecessor, “Where the Columbines Grow”. On April 21, 2011, he became the first inductee into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame.\n\nMichael Jackson. Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) Great Mausoleum, Holly Terrace, Sanctuary of Ascension, Distinguished Memorial – Sarcophagus 9, Crypt A. This mausoleum is private and locked to the general public.\n\nMusician, Entertainer. He was called the “King of Pop,” and is best remembered for his revolutionary videos such as “Thriller” (1982), and “Dangerous” (1991), as well as two Guinness World Records: Most successful entertainer of all time (with 13 Grammy Awards, 13 Number One single hits in a solo career, and sales of over 750 million in albums worldwide), and for having the greatest selling album of all time (“Thriller”). He is also remembered for his trademark single sequined white glove, and for The Moonwalk. Born Michael Joseph Jackson in Gary, Indiana, he was the seventh of nine children to Joseph Walter “Joe” Jackson and Katherine Esther Scruse Jackson, a working class family living in an industrial suburb of Chicago. His father was a steel mill employee who also played guitar in a Rhythm and Blues band, the Falcons. Jackson showed his musical abilities early, performing in front of his kindergarten classmates at the age of 5, and later joining his four brothers in a singing group, The Jackson Brothers, which was changed to the Jackson 5 when Michael was eight years old. Michael was soon singing lead to the others playing, and in 1968, the group signed with Motown Records, their initial break into the recording industry. Even then, Michael was recognized as a singing prodigy. Their first four records set a Motown record when all four hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100. By the early 1970s, the group was considered one of the most successful pop/soul groups in history. In June 1975, the Jackson 5 signed with CBS Records, and Michael also became the principal songwriter of the group. In 1978, he attempted to break into film, playing the Scarecrow in “The Wiz” but had better luck with his music videos, to which he changed from just a video recording of his singing to a short musical story of intense drama. His revolutionary remake of the video medium would change forever the video industry. In 1979, Michael broke away from his brothers to go solo, since he had become more popular than any of his brothers. During the 1980s, his record sales consistently hit number one in the charts, to be topped by his best selling album of all time, Thriller (1982). During this period, Jackson would claim to be suffering from both lupus and vitiligo. In a 1988 autobiography, “Moon Walk,” Jackson would speak of facing his father’s abuse during his childhood, his many periods of weight loss and weight gain, and the changes to his face (many doctors believe that he has undergone as many as a dozen facial cosmetic surgeries). In 1993, he would state in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that he suffered from vitiligo, a rare disease that depigments the skin, turning it white. In the 1990s, as Jackson’s fame grew, he become more introverted, building his Neverland Ranch retreat as a refuge from his fans and detractors alike. Jackson was accused of child sexual abuse in 1993, but settled out of court, paying his accuser 22 million dollars to end the stress of the pending court trial; this led many to believe he was hiding a tendency toward pedophilia, which lost him many fans. Ever the businessman, even his marriages were crafted to improve his image. He was married twice, first to Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of Rock King Elvis Presley, on May 26, 1994, but the marriage ended in divorce in January 1996. He then married Debbie Rowe on November 15, 1996, with whom he had two children, a daughter Paris Michael Katherine, and a son, Michael Jr, nicknamed “Prince.” This marriage also ended in divorce in October 1999. During this period, Jackson became addicted to painkillers, and was able to break the habit with the help of his singer friend, Elton John. In 1997, Jackson would dedicate his album, HIStory, to Elton John; it would sell over 6 million copies worldwide. Jackson would have a third child in 2002, a son, Prince Michael Jackson II, and nicknamed “Blanket.” To date, the name of the mother has not been revealed; she apparently gave up custody of the child to Jackson. In 2003, Jackson was again accused of child molestation, but was found “not guilty” during a media circus trial that ended in June 2005, due to lack of evidence. Many court watchers believe that he was a victim of being a rich celebrity target for blackmailers, hoping to score a quick multi-million dollar settlement from him. During his lifetime, Jackson has been very active in a number of charities, and has donated upwards of $300 million to various charities; he is considered one of the top celebrity donators. For much of his 50 years of life, Jackson, a sensitive man, was subjected to severe stress, beginning with what he considered his father’s mental abuse, his early fame and continuous success in the music world, his loss of several fortunes over the course of his life, followed by the hard work to set up a tour to recoup his losses, his unsuccessful marriages, the continual hounding of the tabloid press, hurtful jokes of late night television hosts, his addiction to pain killers, and rapid weight gain and weight loss; all have taken their toll on his fragile body. About noon on June 25, 2009, Jackson was found unconscious at his home and although EMTs immediately responded, he was pronounced dead at the hospital, believed at the time to be from a fatal heart attack. On July 7, 2009, the Jackson family held a private service for him at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, followed by a memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Michael Jackson was inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in 1997 as a member of the Jackson 5, and in 2001, as a solo artist. In 2002, he was inducted into the Songwriter’s Hall of Fame. He has also received numerous awards for his contributions to the world of pop music, and for his numerous best selling albums.\n\nLionel Hampton. Jazz Musician. His career as a Jazz musician lasted nearly seven decades beginning in Chicago culminating in international fame. Lionel Hampton lifted the vibes to a place of honor in small-group and big-band jazz. Although born in Kentucky, he considered Birmingham, Alabama his hometown. His father was singer-pianist Charles Hampton who enlisted in the army during World War I, first declared MIA, then dead. The lure of jobs in the industrial North in the postwar induced his mother Gertrude to relocate to Chicago. A brief stay in Kenosha, Wisconsin was his first chance at a formal music lesson when a Dominican nun at Holy Rosary Academy taught him the essentials of playing drums. While attending St. Monica’s Catholic School in Chicago, he began selling papers, a pre-requisite for being in the Chicago Defender’s Newsboys Band. First he helped carry the bass drum and then played the snare drum. His break came in Los Angeles after his wife Gladys encouraged him to buy a vibraphone and learn to play. While performing at the Paradise nightclub, Benny Goodman and his group walked in, stepped onto the stage and began playing with the band. Thus, Lionel joined another black, Teddy Wilson in the Benny Goodman band. Hampton then appeared with the Goodman quartet at the Pennsylvania Hotel in New York – The first time that black and white ever played a major commercial booking – the racial barrier was broken. In 1940, Lionel formed his own big band which almost instantly became a leader in the Jazz field. ‘Sunny Side of the Street, Central Avenue Breakdown, his signature tune, Flying Home, and Hamp’s Boogie-Woogie’ all became top-of-the-chart best-sellers upon release. As a composer and arranger, he wrote more than 200 works including a major symphonic work, ‘King David Suite.’ Asked by US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, he served as goodwill ambassador for the United States and his group made many tours to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the far East. With the shadows of old age covering him, he made his last public appearance at the Moscow Jazz Festival. Illness caught up with him. Admitted to Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, he passed away at the age of 94. Lionel was accorded a New Orleans style Jazz funeral in Manhattan. A ‘Jazz Funeral’ procession formed outside Harlem’s historic Cotton Club.
