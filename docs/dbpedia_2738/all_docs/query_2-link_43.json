        "text": "Who run the world?\n\nGirls.\n\nInternational Women’s Day is coming fast and what better way to celebrate this day than to hail the women who’ve made history in the music industry?\n\nAnd because we all know it’s not that easy to crack the code if you’re a woman, let’s continue on to the most likely challenges women in music encounter and the top tips female musicians have for their fellow female musicians.\n\nBut first… let’s take a look if girls do actually rule in the music industry.\n\nSTATISTICS OF WOMEN IN MUSIC\n\nAfter continuous research, data have proven that the music industry still is a male-dominated industry, sadly.\n\nWomen are still underrepresented in many roles and careers available in the industry as well as in the occurring genres of music.\n\nEven award shows, like the Grammy Awards, show this disparity between sex.\n\nvia\n\nThe numbers above, which was part of a blog post published in 2019, summarizes how the music industry is lacking in women in the three creative roles given.\n\nThey are most especially low on female producers.\n\nIn more recent data, statistics show that only 12.9% of popular songs were written by female artists which was clearly a decrease compared to the 2019 14.4%. Additionally the average percentage of female songwriters per year is 12.5%.\n\nThere has been only 21.7% out of 800 popular songs that were performed by female artists and a 37 to 1 male-female ratio of producers out of 500 popular songs.\n\nGrammy awards nominees also have a low percentage of female nominees with only 20.5% of them.\n\nSo basically, Beyonce wasn’t right. Girls still don’t run the world.\n\nNow don’t be discouraged by the statistics we’ve shown.\n\nActually, those data should be the reason why women should push for their place in the music industry.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nINFLUENTIAL WOMEN IN MUSIC\n\nThe world has changed for the better and women have become more in charge with their careers now.\n\nHowever, in the past, this was not the case.\n\nFor the music industry to be what it is today for female musicians, there have been women who rose to the occasion and helped break doors and barriers.\n\n#1. ELLA FITZGERALD\n\n“First Lady of Song”, “Queen of Jazz”, and “Lady Ella”\n\nThe very first on the list of influential women in music is Ella Fitzgerald who is called the “First Lady of Song”.\n\nThe woman is very well known for her pure tone, flawless diction, and great improvisation, specifically her scat singing.\n\nShe has won 13 Grammys, sold over 40 million albums, and recorded around 200 or more albums throughout her career. Additionally, Lady Ella was the first black woman to have ever won in the Grammys.\n\n#2. DOLLY PARTON\n\nCountry music royalty\n\nDolly Parton is known for being a legend in a male-dominated country genre.\n\nShe was known for pioneering the interface of both country and pop music. She has half a century of musical experience and along the way she has had tons of musical achievement and more than 30 awards.\n\nIncluded in those awards are two Guinness World Records, “Most Decades with a Top 20 Hit on the US Hot Country Songs Chart” and “Most Hits on the US Hot Country Songs Chart by a Female Artist”, awarded to her in 2018.\n\nShe has written more than a hundred songs that have mostly topped charts and has sold 100 million records in the span of her career.\n\n#3. TINA TURNER\n\n“Queen of Rock” or “Queen of Rock ‘n’ Roll”\n\nTina Turner started her career in music with her husband Ike Turner, she then pursued her solo career after leaving him.\n\nShe was known for her swagger, gravelly vocals, and her unparalleled stage presence and energy.\n\nTina Turner, like Dolly Parton, was also given a Guinness World Record for having the largest paying audience for a solo performer with 180,000 in 1988.\n\nShe was also the first female and Black artist to have ever been a cover of the magazine Rolling Stone.\n\n#4. SALT-N-PEPA\n\nHip-Hop Pioneers\n\nSalt-N-Pepa aside from being pioneers of the hip-hop genre, they’re also the first female rap group to win a Grammy.\n\nThey showed how women can still succeed in the masculine-fueled genre where they showed and stressed women empowerment.\n\nThe rap duo won the Grammys for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group with None of Your Business, their third single for fourth studio album Very Necessary.\n\nThe duo released a platinum limited vinyl record for the album that included their signature as well as a studio licensed custom frame.\n\nRelated Article:\n\nVinyl Packaging: Pretty Girls Make Graves\n\n#5. SPICE GIRLS\n\nTHE SPICE GIRLS\n\nSpice Girls showed the world what “girl power” really meant with their hit single Wannabe.\n\nThe girl group invaded the US with the single and dominated the radio and TV. They led the teen pop genre revival in the 1990’s with the “Princess of Pop”, Britney Spears.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nTOP CHALLENGES FOR WOMEN IN MUSIC\n\n#1. SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND OBJECTIFICATION\n\nThis has been a prevailing problem not just in the music industry, but also in other fields of work.\n\nThere was a 2021 survey with a total of 401 female respondents by TuneCore and MIDia Research showing 64% of the respondents naming sexual harassment and objectification as a major problem in the music industry.\n\nSexual harassment is most prevailent among starting and/or young female musicians or those who are not yet famous.\n\nMale executives and producers offer them a way to fame in exchange for sexual pleasure. This is very true and is not just rumors.\n\nLady Gaga was raped when she was 19 by a music producer and Kesha was sexually assaulted by producer Dr. Luke.\n\nKnowing these stories from popular female artists, imagine how many more have been subjected to this.\n\n#2. AGEISM\n\nAgeism is how we think, feel, and act towards others based on their age and this has become a big obstacle in the careers of female artists.\n\nThe music industry has an affinity towards younger girls.\n\nThis affinity has, partially, something to do with the industry’s obsession with youth, but it’s more of the idea of making them successful before they are too busy with their children.\n\nBecause of the very concept of motherhood, starting female artists who are on the older side of the age spectrum are not preferred and maybe less supported.\n\n#3. LOOKS\n\nThis challenge is really not isolated to only female artists since male artists are stereotyped by their looks, too.\n\nHowever, it can be a lot worse for the female ones because it’s not their only problem as women in the music industry.\n\nAdditionally, there is a lot of judgment when women appear less or more than the stereotypes men have on women. There have been stereotypes on how they should look, how they should act and what their overall image should be.\n\n#4. SEXISM\n\nThis challenge is the root of all other challenges that women have.\n\nSexism is the stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination based on sex, which is mostly against women. Because of sexism, female artists have been heavily judged and scrutinized for things that male artists are guilty of too.\n\nWe had Taylor Swift being criticized for her long list of celebrity ex-boyfriends while artists like Chris Brown, who have a history of domestic violence, did not get the same treatment.\n\nAdditionally, Ariana Grande faced heavy criticism when she released her hit single 7 rings, all because the song’s lyrics were shallow and selfish.\n\nHowever, we didn’t see any heavy criticism for the misogynistic lyrics some popular songs had, like Drake’s Hotline Bling.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nTIPS FROM WOMEN IN MUSIC\n\n#1. DON’T GET TOO AFFECTED\n\n“Keep doing what you love and don’t get so sidetracked by the press.” -Taylor Swift, singer-songwriter\n\nThere will always be people who will be against you and who will try to bring you down. There will always be bad comments thrown at you.\n\nTo counter these negative things, you will have to not get affected by what they do or say.\n\nJust keep doing what you love doing, which is making music and performing it, and don’t get too affected.\n\nThe more they see a reaction from you the more these negative things will be said and done to you.\n\n#2. MAKE YOUR MUSIC ACCESSIBLE\n\n“Make sure that your music is really accessible to everyone that could want to find it.” -Maisie Peters, singer-songwriter\n\nPeters said that she knows for a fact that people are looking for new music.\n\nThere are a lot of managers and publishers that are looking for and scouting new musicians. So it’s better to have your songs released on accessible platforms like YouTube, Spotify, or others.\n\n#3. LEARN ON THE JOB\n\n“It’s about working with other producers and making yourself invaluable to a studio environment.” -Catherine Marks, music producer and mixing engineer\n\nIf you’re an aspiring music producer, it would be best to get an internship in a producing company and learn there.\n\nYou can try Miloco’s program where they offer a 2-week internship.\n\nThis will help you know the ropes, work with great producers, and even make connections with a lot of people in the industry.\n\n#4. FIND SUPPORT\n\n“Surround yourself with like-minded people who support you.” -Rhiannon Mair, producer, engineer, and artist\n\nThis is an important tip you need to do because it’s a cutthroat industry.\n\nYour journey here will surely not be all rainbows and sunshine. You might have rejections or criticism raining on you for some time.\n\nThis might wear you down. But if you have people who will be there to support you, I’m pretty sure you will be standing right back up.\n\nEven with all those rejections and criticisms, if you have people that would be there to comfort and cheer you up, you won’t feel like quitting this road you’ve taken.\n\n#5.
