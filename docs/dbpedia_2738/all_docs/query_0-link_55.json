        "text": "All six girls who were tragically killed when a truck collided with their car at an Oklahoma intersection known as 'dangerous' by locals have been named by friends and family.\n\nGracie Machado, Brooklyn Triplett, Austin Holt, Madison Robertson, Addison Gratz and Memory Wilson were all identified by their loved ones on social media as the teenagers who were killed in Tuesday's crash.\n\nThe truck driver was identified on Wednesday as Valendon Burton, 51, a rock hauler and doting grandfather whose semi hit their car as it was apparently attempting to turn across his lane and onto U.S. Highway 377 near Tishomingo.\n\nPeople in the community told KFOR the intersection known by locals as the 'Y' has been a longtime issue, and is very dangerous and easy for someone to accidentally pull out in front of oncoming traffic.\n\nThe ODOT told the outlet they are 'committed to improving the highway system for safety,' and extended their condolences to the families of the victims.\n\nTributes for the girls poured in following the crash from the community of Tishomingo, a close-knit community with a population of just over 3,000 people that is now adorned with 'Tishomingo Strong' signs.\n\nCountry music star Blake Shelton, who has a 1,300 acre ranch in Tishomingo, offered words of comfort, saying: 'In the wake of yesterday's unthinkable crash in our small town of Tishomingo, we as a community have all been in shock and broken hearted.'\n\nMadison Robertson's sister, Gabrielle Woolly, posted photos of herself and Madison to social media, with the caption, 'Madison, my only sister. Rest peacefully baby girl. Sing with those angels…'\n\nMadison's aunt, Falesha Roberts, also posted a tribute on Facebook Tuesday, calling the teen a 'beautiful soul.'\n\n'I can't even begin to express the heartbreak I know many families are feeling right now,' Roberts, wrote, as she shared several photos of her niece and called her an 'irreplaceable gift from God.'\n\nShe continued, 'I'll be forever grateful that I got to see your smile, know your kindness, and that I could call you my niece Madison Patience Michelle Robertson! Your beautiful soul remains with us all, while you inherited your wings today!!'\n\nThere were also tributes posted on social media for Memory Wilson, who leaves behind a baby daughter. One family friend describing her as someone with the 'biggest heart of pure gold.'\n\nThe friend also wrote that Memory loved her child and 'toted her all around the neighborhood, came over to ask if she could take her to the park and play, or she would just come sit in the floor and enjoy her company.'\n\nAddison Gratz, referred to as 'AJ' by many online, was honored by family members online with photos and memories. Her grandfather Charles Lewis posted that a 'large part of me died yesterday.'\n\n'My Darling Beautiful firstborn granddaughter was killed in a crash in Tishomingo yesterday!' he posted. 'I need your prayers for the will to keep living. I WILL SEE YOU REAL SOON ADDISON JOE GRATZ!!!'\n\nGracie's sister Sadie Machado posted a photo on Facebook of herself with Gracie with the caption, 'my bestfriend' and a broken heart emoji.\n\nFriends also paid tribute to Brooklyn, a cheerleader and avid softball player.\n\n'Brooklyn was an amazing kid, she loved her family and friends wholeheartedly,' read a tribute on a GoFundMe campaign for the family. 'She was a loyal friend and one hell of a ball player! She will be missed deeply by our family.'\n\nAustin, who was active in Future Farmers of America and enjoyed showing her prize hogs, was confirmed as another victim of the crash by relative Natalie Houston. 'She was a gorgeous intelligent young lady taken way to soon for reasons unknown to me,' Houston wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe six high school students were packed into a small, 2015 Chevy Spark with just four seats - and only the two teenaged girls riding in the front seat were wearing seatbelts, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol said Wednesday.\n\nThe six girls were all students of Tishomingo Public School, according to the district's superintendent. The driver was 16 years old, three of the other girls were 15 and the other two passengers were both 17.\n\nFour of the girls, including the driver, were pronounced dead at the scene of the crash, according to the OHP report. The other two girls died after being transported to the hospital.\n\nThe driver of the truck, Burton, was also a volunteer firefighter and posted recently about the situation in Ukraine, adding that he was praying for a speedy resolution to the conflict.\n\nBurton was wearing a seatbelt at the time and was not injured as a result of the crash. No charges have yet been filed.\n\nOHP said in a statement on Wednesday afternoon: 'Our Traffic Homicide Unit is conducting a thorough investigation that could last weeks... Any loss of life is tragic and we will continue to thoroughly investigate.'\n\n'Our thoughts and prayers are with the families involved and the entire community,' the statement added.\n\nCommunity members raised concerns about the 'dangerous' intersection, known by locals as the 'Y' and say it has been a long-time issue that should have been fixed\n\n'Over the course of the last 50 years that I've been here, it's always been a situation where you can't see left and right,' said Brad Sneed, who told KFOR he's lived in the town since 1972.\n\n'That intersection [that the girls were killed at] is known as the 'Y'. [It's] very dangerous and very easy to accidentally pull out in front of oncoming traffic,' he added.\n\nIn an email to KFOR, ODOT officials said, 'The agency extends its condolences to the families and the entire Tishomingo community affected by the devastating loss. Any loss of life due to a crash is a tragedy, and ODOT is committed to constantly evaluating and improving the highway system for safety.'\n\n'Something like this that finally got enough attention that maybe they could fix it,' Sneed told KFOR. 'Things need to change so it's a clear intersection.'\n\nCountry music star Blake Shelton, who issued a statement, has ties to the community as he and his wife, Gwen Stefani, have own a 1,300 acre ranch just outside of Tishomingo.\n\nThe rural ranch that has a lake and basketball court is where the couple wed and where they have gone to escape the roar of Hollywood.\n\nShelton reached out to the heartbroken community following the crash to offer words of comfort as he too knows the 'devastation of suddenly losing a loved one in a car accident.'\n\n'In the wake of yesterday's unthinkable crash in our small town of Tishomingo, we as a community have all been in shock and broken hearted,' he stated. 'I personally know the devastation of suddenly losing a loved one in a car accident. But our community is strong and has come together to support and wrap our arms around the families and friends that are hurting the most. There's no question it will take a long time to heal from this tragedy. Keep the prayers coming.'\n\nWhen Shelton was a teenager, his brother Ritchie Shelton, died in a tragic car accident in November 1990 at the age of 24. Ritchie's girlfriend and her young son were also killed in the crash.\n\nOn Wednesday, one day after the crash, classes did resume in the Tishomingo Public School district, which has about 850 students, said Superintendent Bobby Waitman said.\n\n'Academics are secondary, frankly, at this point to the students knowing that they belong, that they have a safe place,' Waitman said.\n\n'You'll never fully understand, I don't think we'll ever fully understand a loss like this,' Waitman added.\n\nThe Superintendent said funerals for the students were not yet scheduled. A community candlelight vigil for the young victims is scheduled for 7pm on Friday at the Tishomingo High School football field.\n\nThe two vehicles collided around 12.19pm on Tuesday at the intersection of U.S. 377 and Oklahoma 22 in Tishomingo, a rural city of about 3,000 located about 115 miles southeast of Oklahoma City.\n\nTroopers said the girls' vehicle was traveling eastbound on Oklahoma 22 and stopped at a stop sign at the intersection of U.S. 377 just before 12:30 p.m.\n\nOHP Trooper Shelby Humphrey said Tuesday night that the girls attempted to turn at the intersection, which maps show is at the end of a 90-degree curve of U.S. 377 from east to south.\n\nThe girls' car was struck by the semi which was approaching from the east on U.S. 377, KXII-TV reported.\n\nThe force of the crash moved the car about approximately 300 feet from the intersection, KXII-TV reported, leaving it in a mangled mess with doors and ripped off.\n\nAccording to the crash report released by OHP on Wednesday morning, the circumstances of the wreck remain under investigation.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team, according to NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson.\n\nWhile what led to the crash is unknown, it highlighted concerns of teenagers carrying carloads of other young passengers.\n\n'Just adding a single passenger under age 21 increases the risk of crashing by 44 percent' when the driver is a teen, said William Van Tassel with AAA´s national office.\n\n'One of the main concerns and risks of having multiple teenagers in a car is the distractions that come with that,' Van Tassel said.\n\n'If one of the passengers is over 35 (the risk) goes down by 62 percent. That implies teens can drive safely when there´s an adult in the car,' Van Tassel told The Associated Press.\n\nThe crash report, released Wednesday morning, said the circumstances of the wreck remained under investigation.\n\nOnly the 16-year-old driver and front-seat passenger were wearing seat belts when the 2015 Chevrolet Spark collided with the truck, according to the Highway Patrol.\n\n'The unbelted people put everyone at risk,' Van Tessel said. 'In a crash, the unbuckled people fly around all over the place,' injuring others inside the vehicle.\n\nOklahoma is the only state where passengers who more than 7 years old and in the back seat of a car do not have to wear a seat belt, said Leslie Gamble, the manger of public and government relations for AAA-Oklahoma.\n\n'A 41-member coalition of traffic safety advocates has pushed for a bill to be passed by our state legislators for the past three years without success,' Gamble said\n\nTishomingo Public School Superintendent Bobby Waitman confirmed the loss of the girls on Facebook, saying the district has 'suffered a great loss.'\n\n'Our hearts are broken, and we are grieving with our students and staff,' Waitman wrote.\n\nFamily, friends and the community posted condolences on social media, while others inquired about additional details of the crash.\n\nBut some heartless online commenters posted scathing messages on the victims' social media accounts, ripping into to them for not wearing seat belts.\n\nOne user wrote, 'Where was yo seatbelt at?' and included a laughing crying emoji. The same account commented again, saying 'Why u didn't wear a seatbelt? It's kinda hard to feel bad for u' along with a hand over face emoji. Another user wrote, 'If you woulda had a seatbelt on this wouldn't of turned out that way.'\n\nTheir comments were met with backlash from the victims' loved ones and the community who slammed them for making such comments during the heartbreaking time.\n\nIt is not clear if the commenters knew the victims.\n\nTishomingo Public Schools closed early Tuesday for weather, but was back open on Wednesday to focus on the emotional well-being of the student body, Waitman said in a statement.\n\n'We feel it is imperative that we inform you that our district has suffered a great loss today involving high school students. Our hearts are broken, and we are grieving with our students and staff,' Waitman wrote.\n\nHe added that counselors would be available to students through the day and evening.\n\nImages from the horrific scene of the crash from KFOR showed a virtually destroyed black car with what appeared to be a pink steering wheel among the rubble.\n\nThe Johnston County Sheriff's Office posted Tuesday afternoon.\n\n'Our prayers are with each of the families involved and our community,' they wrote in a Facebook post. 'This is an absolute tragedy which will have life long effects. This community and families need our support and prayers at this time.'\n\nTishomingo is the county seat of Johnston County, with a population just over 3,000 people."
