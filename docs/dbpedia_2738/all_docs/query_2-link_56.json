        "text": "The Cave Singers are no doubt inspired by the rain and shine of the Pacific Northwest. Formed in 2007 from the dissolution of bands such as Pretty Girls Make Graves and Hint Hint, this trio has built a sound full of dark folk, with more than a hint of punk rock. Pete Quirk (vocals, guitar, harmonica), Derek Fudesco (guitar and bass) and Marty Lund (drums, guitar) have found their own niche in contemporary Americana. After signing with Matador and releasing two albums, the band jumped to Jagjaguwar and released another set of enticing songs, No Witch.\n\nYou can almost hear the rainy weather of Seattle in these new songs. The stripped down arrangements evoke images of dreary skies, but also beautiful scenery. Hear The Cave Singers play live and discuss the band's European tour with Fleet Foxes."
