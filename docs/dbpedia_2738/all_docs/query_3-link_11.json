        "text": "The Smiths' song 'Pretty Girls Make Graves' is a poignant exploration of unrequited desire and the internal conflict between societal expectations and personal identity. The lyrics, penned by the band's lead singer Morrissey, are known for their poetic and often melancholic nature, which is a hallmark of The Smiths' music.\n\nThe song's title is a reference to a line from Jack Kerouac's novel 'The Dharma Bums' and suggests the idea that beauty and desire can lead to sadness and downfall. The lyrics depict a scenario where the protagonist is pressured into a romantic or sexual situation that he is uncomfortable with. He asserts that he is not the man that others perceive him to be, indicating a disconnect between his true self and the expectations placed upon him. The repeated line 'And sorrow's native son, He will not rise for anyone' emphasizes his refusal to conform to these expectations, despite the societal pressure to do so.\n\nThe song also touches on themes of lost innocence and disillusionment with the concept of womanhood, as the protagonist loses faith after witnessing the superficiality and fleeting nature of attraction. The Smiths often tackled themes of alienation and the complexities of human relationships, and 'Pretty Girls Make Graves' is a testament to their ability to weave these themes into their music with emotional depth and literary references."
