        "text": "Voting Rules\n\nOnly bands and artists from Seattle, Washington.\n\nThis list of Seattle based bands includes all of your favorite Pacific Northwestern musicians, both the famous artists and ones of underground status. Rather than simply filling this compilation of singers/groups with only flannel-clad grunge bands like Nirvana, we've featured everyone below, from the legendary Jimi Hendrix to Pearl Jam, with artists spanning all genres, including rock, pop, metal, jazz, hip hop, alternative, and even country.\n\nIf you're wondering, \"what popular bands are from Seattle?\" or \"where can I find a good list of the best Seattle bands?\" then look no further! Check out the talented, local Washington state musical natives below, and afterwards, be sure to head on over to their discography pages as well.\n\nRanked by\n\nJimi Hendrix, arguably one of the greatest guitarists of all time, was born in Seattle in 1942. He rose to fame in the late 1960s with his mesmerizing guitar skills and innovative playing techniques that changed the course of rock music forever. His band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, released iconic songs such as \"Purple Haze\" and \"Voodoo Child.\" Sadly, his career was unexpectedly cut short following his untimely death at age 27 in 1970.\n\nConsidered as one of the pioneers of the grunge movement in the early '90s, Pearl Jam is a globally renowned band that hails from Seattle. Led by vocalist Eddie Vedder, Pearl Jam has enjoyed a successful career that shows no signs of stopping today, with their tenth studio album released in 2020. The band is known for their emotive lyrics and passionate live performances, on tracks like \"Alive,\" \"Even Flow,\" and \"Jeremy.\"\n\nAs the frontman and lead guitarist for Nirvana, Kurt Cobain irrefutably made his mark on music history as a driving force behind Seattle's grunge movement. Cobain's raw songwriting style on hits like \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and \"Come As You Are\" resonated with a generation and cemented Nirvana's legacy before his tragic death in 1994 at just age 27.\n\nFounded by Nirvana's former drummer Dave Grohl, Foo Fighters took the Seattle music scene by storm following their formation in 1994. With Grohl's powerful vocals and diverse songwriting abilities, the band released hits such as \"Everlong,\" \"My Hero,\" and \"Learn To Fly.\" Today, they continue to be a mainstay act around the world with an impressive number of albums and awards under their belt.\n\nAnother key player in Seattle's grunge scene, Soundgarden rose to fame in the late '80s and early '90s largely thanks to the unmistakable voice of Chris Cornell. With hits like \"Black Hole Sun\" and \"Spoonman,\" Soundgarden's music showcased intricate arrangements and intense lyrics that continue to captivate fans today.\n\nFormed in 1987, Alice in Chains was one of the first bands to emerge from Seattle's grunge scene, alongside contemporaries such as Nirvana and Soundgarden. Fronted by vocalist Layne Staley, Alice in Chains became known for its heavy guitar riffs and melancholy lyrics on hits like \"Man In The Box\" and \"Would?\" The band continued to evolve over the years, maintaining its signature dark sound after Staley's death in 2002 with new vocalist William DuVall."
