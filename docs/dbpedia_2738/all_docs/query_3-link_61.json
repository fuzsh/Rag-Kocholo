        "text": "Back in print this November 3rd for the first time since 2003: ‚ÄòThe New Romance' by Pretty Girls Make Graves, the latest installment of Matador's ongoing catalog series Revisionist History. Pretty Girls Make Graves formed in Seattle in 2001, fused together out of the still glowing embers of nearly a dozen important groups. Andrea Zollo and Derek Fudesco had played together in Death Wish Kids and Area 51 along with Dann Gallucci, with whom Derek formed Murder City Devils. Shortly before the Murder City Devils called it quits, he and Andrea started Pretty Girls Make Graves with J. Clark (who was in Kill Sadie and Sharks Keep Moving) and Nick Dewitt and Nathan Thelen (both in Bee Hive Vaults). Brilliantly produced by Phil Ek (Modest Mouse, Built To Spill, Les Savy Fav), ‚ÄòThe New Romance' magnifies Pretty Girls Make Graves' songcraft and technical prowess while letting some air into their songs and keeping things in crisp focus. Every song on ‚ÄòThe New Romance' is an anthem, yet without traditional verses and choruses. Tension builds and shifts without conventional release, as moments of glassy beauty and rousing aggression trade sides.\n\nA1. Something Bigger, Something Brighter A2. The Grandmother Wolf A3.
