        "text": "I rode into our homestead. I was coming back from visiting Lenny and Hosea's grave. With so many lost friends, I had to visit graves a lot.\n\nI tried my hardest to visit all of them. I brought them flowers.\n\nI even payed visits to Molly and Kieran. I didn't want for them to be forgotten.\n\nI most frequently visited Sean though.\n\nAnd with Charles coming back into my life, he told me where Arthur was buried. A mystery that had bothered me for years. I found myself visiting him often now too. I owed my life to him.\n\nI laughed as our dog, Copper barked. \"Hey, boy.\" I greeted him as he followed my horse. I hitched Canela and hopped off. \"You been good?\" I kneeled down giving Copper a pat on the head. He wagged his tail and I laughed. \"Yeah, you been good.\"\n\nI stood up and took out a cigarette. I placed it between my lips and took out a match. I lit the match with the bottom of my boot then lit the cigarette.\n\nI inhaled smoke as I walked up to the door. I was taking it easier with the smoking. I reduced my use of cigarettes from five a day to three or two. For me, that was an accomplishment. Smoking had always been a stress reliever for me. I couldn't help it.\n\nI opened the front door and walked in. There, I saw Sadie looking around the house frantically. She picked up ammo and placed it into her bag.\n\n\"Sadie?\" I questioned and she looked over at me. \"Hey.\" She stopped. \"Are you smoking?\" Sadie asked quickly and I shook my head. \"No...\" I put the cigarette out on the nearest ashtray.\n\n\"Rosa, honey, I told you-\" Sadie started but I interrupted her. \"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"I-\" Sadie paused and laughed a little. \"I found him. I finally found him.\"\n\n\"Micah?\" I crossed my arms and she nodded. \"Yeah, well- I found one of his boys. Cleet. The small guy. You remember him?\"\n\n\"Yeah...\" I remembered.\n\n\"Well, he's down by Strawberry. We gotta go now, Rosa.\" Sadie told me. \"You got everything you need?\"\n\n\"I guess-\" I looked down at my holstered gun. It was the same one Dutch had gave me all those years ago.\n\nI looked at Sadie unsure like. \"are you sure we should do this?\"\n\n\"Why the hell shouldn't we do this?\" Sadie looked at me with furrowed brows. \"Rosa, you want him dead just as much as I do. Micah deserves death and you know it.\"\n\nI paused to think.\n\nNow is the time, Rosa.\n\n\"Okay...\" I nodded. \"Okay, let's go get him.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Sadie nodded. \"Come on, let's go get John.\"\n\n\"John?\" I questioned. \"Sadie, I thought I said-\"\n\n\"I know, but...\" Sadie got close to me. \"He needs this, Rosa. I talked to him about it, and he needs it real bad. This is his choice. Besides, we'll take good care of him, won't we?\"\n\n\"Fine.\" I nodded. \"Let's just get him killed and get it over with.\"\n\nSadie and I rode over to Beechers Hope. The ride was silent. I thought about it all. About Micah.\n\nWe rode into their ranch. Charles called out for John. He and Abigail came out. \"Hello, you two.\" John said.\n\n\"John. Abigail.\" Sadie greeted. \"Charles.\" She dismounted her horse. \"We found him. We found Micah.\"\n\n\"No.\" Abigail immediately said.\n\nI stayed on my horse and looked down. I couldn't look at Abigail's hurt face. Not again.\n\n\"I got a lead.\" Sadie said. \"One of his boys, wanted for murdering a woman. Been seen drinking in Strawberry. If we can get to him... he'll lead us to Micah. But we gotta go now, you coming?\"\n\n\"No, he's not coming.\" Abigail answered.\n\n\"I will.\" Charles said and she nodded. \"And that's your business. His business is here.\"\n\n\"Yeah...\" John said. \"Yeah, i'll ride with you.\"\n\n\"No! I'm..\" Abigail followed John into the house. \"I'm begging you!\"\n\nI couldn't stand seeing Abigail be let down once more. I was there when John left her that one year. It was heartbreaking to witness. I helped her take care of Jack. The poor girl had to raise a child with a broken heart. I'm sure it was no easy thing.\n\nJohn soon came back out with his guns. \"Let's go kill this son of a bitch, then.\"\n\nCharles, John, Sadie, and I rode over to Strawberry.\n\nThere we split up to look for Cleet. Sadie ended up catching him.\n\n\"Hello, Cleet.\" Sadie punched him. \"Remember us?\"\n\nJohn approached us and Sadie looked over at him. \"You wanna take a turn?\"\n\n\"Hey, hey, we're old buddies, ain't we?\" Cleet raised his hand as John approached him. \"Sure, Sadie, with pleasure.\" He kicked Cleet. \"Where's Micah?\"\n\n\"Micah?\" Cleet questioned. \"I ain't seen him.\"\n\nJohn kicked him once more. \"Micah! Where?!\" He kept kicking. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"Stop! Stop!\" Cleet cried. \"I don't know where he is! I ain't seen him... we- we fell out.\"\n\n\"You know what?\" Sadie said. \"I'm bored of this. Let's hang the bastard.\"\n\n\"What?\" Cleet and I both questioned at the same time.\n\nJohn just chuckled. \"Good idea.\" He grabbed Cleet by the collar of his coat. He dragged him onto the gallows as he screamed. \"Hold on! I swear!\"\n\nCharles and I glanced over at each other. I felt sometimes Charles understood my way of thinking. And I understood his.\n\nJohn and Sadie were violent people. Not Charles, not me neither. Charles always had a way of being good, even when he was being bad.\n\n\"Move it!\" Sadie pushed Cleet onto the gallows. She placed him under the rope. \"String the no good murdering bastard up.\"\n\nJohn put the rope around Cleets neck. \"Alright, let's try this again.\" John went over to the lever. \"Where's Micah?\"\n\n\"I already told you, I ain't seen him!\" Cleet cried.\n\n\"You lie.\" Sadie scoffed and Cleet shook his head. \"It ain't my fault! He tried to kill me.\"\n\nJohn began pulling the lever lightly as a warning. \"Talk!\"\n\n\"Stop! Wait...\" Cleet sighed. \"He's up in the mountains! He's up in Mount Hagen. He got a whole gang now. Bad men... doing bad things. I- I tried to stop him from murdering that little girl... we fell out.. honest. Please- i'm- i'm one of the good guys.\"\n\n\"Hang him.\" Sadie said.\n\n\"What?\" I looked at Sadie with furrowed brows. \"No, Sadie. We should just let the man live.\"\n\n\"What?\" Sadie chuckled. \"You gone soft?\"\n\n\"Of course i've gone soft, Sadie. I have a-\" I sighed. \"I have a home. I have a woman by my side who I love. I'm past all this. Besides, revenge is a luxury we can't afford. Even Dutch knew that.\"\n\n\"He's a no good murdering bastard.\"\n\n\"I-\" I sighed. \"I know.\" I turned to John. \"John, don't do it.\"\n\nI felt bad for Cleet. I mean, I've killed women before.\n\nI knew better than anyone that we could change. I believe in redemption.\n\n\"Leave him be, John.\" I told him. \"Micah's the only one we need.\"\n\n\"Yes, please John.\" Cleet sobbed. \"Please, listen to Rosa.\"\n\nThe bastard even knew our names.\n\nJohn sighed and let go of the lever. \"I can't do it, Sadie. Not like this.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Cleet expressed. \"Thank you, John. You won't ever see me again. I swear.\"\n\n\"Fine.\" Sadie took out her gun and I stopped her. \"Sadie, please.\"\n\n\"But-\" Sadie looked into my eyes. \"You sure-?\"\n\n\"Sadie, I don't need no more blood on my hands.\" I told her and she sighed putting her gun down. \"Alright.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you.\" Cleet cried. \"Thank you, Rosa.\"\n\n\"I ever hear of you killing again and I won't stop her next time.\" I told him and he nodded. \"Of course. Of course.\"\n\n\"Come on.\" I told John and Sadie. \"We got what we need.\"\n\nThe ride to the mountains was a long one. We even had to camp out at night. We got back on the trail when the sun came up.\n\n\"There's a watchtower up there.\" Sadie explained as we rode up the mountain. \"That must be where their camp is held up.\"\n\nSuddenly, there was a gunshot and Charles fell off his horse.\n\n\"Shit!\" Sadie dismounted her horse. \"Get down! Must be a sniper.\"\n\n\"Charles!\" I yelled as I dismounted my horse. \"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"I'm well!\" Charles responded.\n\n\"I'll move up!\" I looked back at Sadie. \"Cover me.\"\n\n\"Will do!\" Sadie nodded.\n\nSadie and John took out men as I tried to move up. I got a clear shot of the man at the sniper.\n\n\"Okay, cabron.\" I took a deep breath as I aligned the shot. I pulled the trigger and laughed in relief. \"He's out!\"\n\nSadie laughed. \"Ooh wee! Good shot, cowgirl.\" Sadie gave me a pat on the back. \"Let's go get back to Charles.\"\n\nI approached Charles and helped him take cover. \"You okay, Charles?\"\n\n\"Just about.\" He propped his body up against a rock. \"You three go on. Go on! Move fast... or they'll come down that hill and kill us all.\" His shoulder was bleeding pretty bad.\n\n\"Stay safe, Charles.\" I put my hand on his good shoulder and he nodded holding my hand. \"You too. Now go.\"\n\n\"I don't want to leave him.\" John said and Charles huffed. \"They know we're coming now... I will be fine. I'll follow you up. I just- I just can't move fast.\"\n\n\"Okay...\" Sadie looked over at us. \"Let's go.\"\n\nWe kept moving forward. We took out many men as we moved up.\n\n\"Alright, push up!\" Sadie yelled as we climbed.\n\n\"Sadie look out-!\" John yelled.\n\nSadie was tackled onto the ground. I ran over to her but was tackled too. It seems a man did the same to John too.\n\nThe man punched my stomach with force then my face. It hurt real bad. My face and body ached. I reached for my knife and stabbed him. His body became heavy and I pushed him off.\n\nA shot went off and I turned over to it. It was Charles. He shot the man attacking Sadie.\n\nI then looked over at Sadie. She held her stomach in pain. \"Sadie...\" I quickly got up and went to her. \"You okay?\"\n\n\"I'm all right.\" Sadie breathed out. I looked down at her stab wound. She was bleeding real bad. \"Oh, god.\" My heart dropped.\n\nI had been stabbed before, and hell, did it hurt.\n\nSadie wheezed in pain and I nodded putting her arm over my shoulder. \"I know, I know, baby, come on.\" I guided her to a rock. \"Just breathe.\" I helped her down as she wheezed. \"I'm- i'm fine.\"\n\n\"You should've kept that knife in.\" I told her and she chuckled. \"I'll be fine.\"\n\n\"You're bleeding pretty bad.\" John said and she groaned in pain. \"Ain't nothing.\"\n\n\"You're dying.\" John said making me look back at him. He really wasn't making me feel better about the situation.\n\n\"I ain't dying. I ain't.\" Sadie sighed and I shook my head. \"You better not.\" I turned to join. \"You go. Go get that rat. I'll join you in just a minute.\"\n\nI knew with certainty that John had this handled.\n\n\"Alright.\" John told me. \"You protect them.\"\n\n\"I will.\" I said and Sadie groaned. \"I'm fine.\"\n\nJohn left and I looked over at Charles. \"You okay over there?\"\n\n\"Just about.\" He huffed in pain and I nodded taking my bandana off. I folded it until it got thick.\n\n\"This is gonna take me off work for a while.\" Sadie groaned and I laughed a little. \"I don't think you should worry about that.\"\n\nSadie chuckled a little. \"I guess.\"\n\nI lifted her shirt and placed the cloth on her wound applying pressure. Sadie groaned in pain and I nodded. \"I know.\" I added more cloth. \"Hold this.\" I told her and she did.\n\nI took out some bandages. \"Hold your arm up.\" I told her. I wrapped the bandage around her stomach.\n\n\"I think I win.\" Sadie said referring to our little competition. It was decided that i'd been through worse injuries than Sadie had.\n\nI laughed a little. \"I think so too.\"\n\n\"You know, i've been meaning to tell you-\" Sadie chuckled. \"you talk in your sleep.\" Sadie said and I looked up at her. \"Really? What do I say?\"\n\nSadie breathed out through her nose. \"I have no idea. You speak in Spanish.\"\n\n\"Hm.\" I hummed as I tied up the bandages. \"You think you can make it out?\"\n\n\"I can barely speak english.\" Sadie joked and I laughed.\n\n\"I don't know how you do it.\" Sadie moaned in pain. \"You're too smart for me.\"\n\n\"Well, it wasn't easy.\" I said.\n\nAnd it wasn't. I had to learn English early on in my childhood. I translated for my father when he came to the country. And even then, I could hardly speak it well. I only began speaking the language frequently when I joined the gang. I used to be so ashamed of my broken english, but now, I didn't feel embarrassment getting a word or two wrong. Sadie would always remind me how smart I was to understand two languages.\n\n\"Go.\" Sadie huffed. \"Go with John.\"\n\n\"You sure?\" I questioned and she nodded. \"I am. You go- and you go kill that son of a bitch.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" I nodded. I placed my hand on the back of her head and pressed my lips onto hers. We kissed twice and then I pulled away pressing our foreheads together. \"I'll come back for you.\"\n\n\"You better.\" Sadie said with a chuckle.\n\nI stood up and looked over to Charles. \"You two take care of each other.\"\n\n\"Good luck, Rosa.\" Charles told me as I left. \"Thank you.\"\n\nI walked up the mountain with the little strength I had.\n\nSuddenly, I was tackled onto the ground. It was a bigger fall than usual. The man tackled me down hill. He even fell on top of me.\n\nI groaned in pain. I had fallen on my arm spraining it. \"Puta madre.\" I huffed in pain. I pushed him off and tried to crawl away from the man. He seemed to had also hurt himself in the process.\n\nHe grabbed onto my leg. \"Where are you going?\"\n\nI pointed my handgun toward him using my good arm. \"I don't wanna shoot you, man.\"\n\nHe let go off my leg. The man backed up a little scared and I took a deep breath. I couldn't risk him going back for Sadie.\n\nI let my finger pull the trigger and sighed. \"I'm sorry.\" I stood up. God, i'm terrible.\n\n\"Stupid Micah.\" I looked down at my sensitive arm. It was the same one I broke back at Blackwater. All this trouble just to see him dead.\n\n\"Oh, you dumb rat.\" I whispered under my breath as I climbed up the hill. \"This better be fucken worth it.\" I gritted my teeth. My entire body hurt; my arm more especially.\n\nAt the top of the mountain, was a small cabin. There I saw John. Micah seemed to be behind the cabin. I decided to sneak up on him.\n\nI cocked my gun and aimed at his head. \"Put the guns away, Micah.\"\n\nHis head turned to me. It brought back all those memories. Those memories of manipulation.\n\n\"Rosa.\" Micah greeted me. \"You look good.\" He nodded. \"I guess time did you a favor.\"\n\n\"It didn't do you a favor.\" I told him and he laughed. \"I guess. Did...\" Micah started. \"Did things work out with that Adler woman?\"\n\n\"They did.\" I kept my gun on him and he shook his head. \"I'm surprised.\"\n\n\"You talk a lot for a dead man.\" I told him and he looked back at John. \"The two scareface traitors teaming up...\" Micah laughed putting his guns up to the air. I scoffed. \"Shut up and walk, old man.\"\n\nHe nodded with a smile. \"Okay... you got me.\" Micah began walking forward. I kept my gun upon his back.\n\n\"Just like old times, hm?\" Micah put his guns away. \"All manner of folk paying social calls.\" He made a kiss noise making me scoff. \"John, you shoot this bastard before I let my finger slip.\"\n\nSuddenly, the cabin door opened. \"Hello, son.\" I heard Dutches voice. It brought make so many memories. Bad memories.\n\nDutch made eye contact with me. \"Rosa.\" He had a gun pointed at me and one pointed at John.\n\nIt was like seeing a ghost. The man in front of me looked nothing like the Dutch I knew. He looked almost unrecognizable. \"It's been quite a while.\"\n\n\"Dutch?\" I managed to speak. I was immediately caught off guard by Micah. He tackled me down to the ground. I tried my best to fight him.\n\n\"Get off, you-\" I managed to punch him with my good arm, but he got angrier and hit me with all his strength. After he punched me, he placed me into a chokehold. Micah put a gun to my head with a laugh. \"I got you now, Rose.\"\n\n\"It's Rosa, you piece of shit.\" I spit out the blood in my mouth. I had gotten punched more today than I've been in seven years. I was pretty sure a tooth was loose too.\n\n\"Now, John... what were you saying?\" Micah pointed a gun toward him. John stood his ground. \"Let her go.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't do that.\" Micah said. I didn't want to fight back in fear that the psychopath might actually shoot me.\n\n\"What're you doing here, Dutch?\" John pointed the gun at Dutch who just shrugged. \"Same as you, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Dutch and I are teaming up once more, we got money, we got dreams. You two should join us.\" Micah got close to my ear. \"Oh, you'd like it, Rosa. You'd like it up here with me.\"\n\nI pushed my head away in disgust. \"You reek, Micah.\"\n\nHe just laughed in response.\n\n\"Let her go, Micah.\" John said.\n\nI felt Micah's breath on my neck as he laughed. \"No can do, John.\"\n\n\"Dutch...\" John looked over at him. \"Dutch, come on now!\"\n\n\"You shot at me, son.\" Dutch said and John scoffed. \"You started it.\"\n\n\"You betrayed me. You and her...\" Dutch looked over at me. \"you both betrayed me!\"\n\n\"We could say the same as you.\" John said.\n\n\"I was trying to do my best.. you... you just cared for yourself.\" Dutch said and John sighed. \"I think differently.\"\n\n\"John...\" Micah started again. \"Join us.\"\n\n\"Let her go!\" John yelled again making Micah's grip get even tighter. \"I don't want to kill you, John.\"\n\n\"Arthur saved my life....\" John said. \"more than once.\"\n\n\"Arthurs been dead a long time!\" Micah yelled. \"This is a new century.\"\n\nJohn shook his head and looked to Dutch. \"Dutch.. Dutch, we all did our best for you; ain't our fault things turned out the way they did. Killing me wont solve nothing!\"\n\n\"Put your gun down, Marston!\" Micah yelled.\n\n\"Please, Dutch.\" I wheezed. \"You said you loved me like a daughter.\"\n\nDutch stared at me. I searched for any sign of the man he used to be. \"Goddamnit, Dutch!\" I finally cried out. \"We did everything for you! You were like a father to me! All of this for what?\" I tried to break free from Micah's hold. \"For this rat!\"\n\n\"If I were you i'd be careful with my next words, woman.\" He applied more pressure around my neck.\n\nDutch stayed silent making John scoff. \"Say something! Say something, Dutch!\"\n\n\"I ain't got too much to say no more.\"\n\nI heard a gunshot making me flinch. All of a sudden, Micah stopped holding me so tightly and I looked over at him. Dutch shot him.\n\nMicah laughed psychotically. \"You shot me... you shot me pretty good.\"\n\nI backed up quickly and stared as John finished the job, shooting him multiple times in the chest. Micah nodded in shock, then his body hit the ground.\n\nI looked over to Dutch who walked past John.\n\n\"Thank you... I...\" John thanked. \"I...\"\n\nDutch gave him a hard look as he walked away.\n\nThen he turned over to me. I felt so vulnerable in that moment. Dutch was looking down at me with no emotion. Not anger, not love, not regret, nothing.\n\nI watched as he left.\n\n\"You okay?\" John came up to me and I nodded. \"Yeah.\" I wiped my tears away with my gloves. \"I just-\" I sighed. \"What happened to him, John?\"\n\n\"I wish I knew the answer to that.\" John look back wt Micah's dead body. \"He hurt you?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" I chuckled feeling my jaw. \"That snake broke my goddamn tooth.\" I spit the tooth out on Micah's body.\n\n\"Let me see.\" John said and I showed him my teeth. My canine tooth was missing. John laughed a little. \"You might have to smile with your mouth closed now.\"\n\n\"I think so.\" I laughed too and he looked down at my arm. \"You really have a habit of breaking that arm.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" I breathed out and looked over at the cabin. \"The money- Blackwater.\"\n\n\"You-\" John looked back at the cabin. \"You think?\"\n\n\"Oh, I know.\" I sighed. \"Come on. Let's get it so I can get back to Sadie.\n\n\"Alright.\" John walked over to the cabin. I followed him.\n\nJohn looked over at a chest and opened it slowly. \"Jesus...\" He breathed out and I looked over at the chest. There was money and gold. A lot of it.\n\nI breathed out not knowing what to say. John looked over at me with a surprised expression. \"I-\"\n\n\"It's a lot.\" I laughed in relief and he did the same. \"That it is.\" He looked around for something to put it in.\n\n\"I don't much regret doing that Blackwater job now.\" I breathed out as John started loading up the money and gold. \"Neither do I.\"\n\nI patted his back with my good arm. \"There goes your debt.\""
