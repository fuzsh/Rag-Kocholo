        "text": "Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.\n\nFrom mocking the sexist superficiality of our society to celebrating financial independence, here, for no particular reason other than that they rock, are 10 of the greatest feminist anthems of all times—inspiring, inquiring, and provocative. So plug in your iPod and go conquer the world. It’s yours for the taking.\n\n1. “Stupid Girls” by Pink — A fine critique of our image-obssessed culture and its effects on young women.\n\nBest lyric: What happened to the dream of a girl president?/She’s dancing in the video next to 50 Cent.\n\n2. “I will survive” by Gloria Gaynor: The iconic representation of women’s (and gay) rights in 1970s.\n\nBest lyric: Do you think I’d crumble?/Did you think I’d lay down and die?/Oh no, not I, I will survive.\n\n3. “Man I feel like a Woman” by Shania Twain: In this Grammy-winning single, Twain sings that the “best thing about being a woman is the prerogative to have a little fun.”\n\nBest lyric: We don’t need romance, we only wanna dance/We’re gonna let our hair hang down.\n\n4. “RESPECT” by Aretha Franklin: This speaks for itself.\n\nBest lyric: R-E-S-P-E-C-T/Find out what it means to me.\n\n5. “Suggestion,” by Fugazi: One of the most powerful anti-rape songs ever written, “Suggestion” blames not just on the rapist, but the culture that looks away.\n\nBest lyric: There lays no reward in what you discover/You spent yourself, boy, watching me suffer (suffer your words, suffer your eyes, suffer your hands)/Suffer your interpretation/of what it is to be a man.\n\n6) “Bad Bitch” by Lupe: Weighing in on the B-word and how young people interpret it.\n\nBest lyric: First he’s relatin’ the word “bitch” with his mama, comma/And because she’s relatin’ to herself, his most important source of help.\n\n7. “Bloody Ice Cream” by Bikini Kill: In which Riot Grrrl Kathleen Hanna and her iconic band take on sexism in the poetry industry.\n\nBest lyric: The whole damn thing!\n\n8. “Independent Woman” by Destiny’s Child: Who needs your money, man?\n\nBest lyric: The shoe on my feet, I’ve bought it/The clothes I’m wearing, I’ve bought it/The rock I’m rockin’, I’ve bought it/’Cause I depend on me.\n\n9. “This is our emergency,” by Pretty Girls Make Graves: Slamming a culture that makes us lack fulfillment and feel helpless.\n\nBest lyric: Baby you don’t have to be a picture in a magazine/Sometimes you’re too blind to see/Anything objectively\n\n10. U.N.I.T.Y by Queen Latifah: QL’s response to women being treated as sex objects."
