        "text": "After a pretty straightforward, but incredibly enjoyable EP and a more raucous debut, the Seattle post-punk, post-hardcore band went in a more sophisticated and measured direction on The New Romance. I'm going to be honest, I think this record is perfect, but I also feel like convincing you of this is no small feat. It's not the most immediately catchy, it's not the most urgent sounding record, and it's not interested in breaking new sonic ground. What this record does offer on the other hand is interesting and intricate compositions, stellar performances with tons of feeling and swagger, immaculate production that gives everything you need and nothing you don't, and a variable (in tone) tracklist that begins with a bang and ends with a great sense of closure.\n\nSomething Bigger, Something Brighter kicks this thing off with a bit of a solemn intro. Percussion wise, we have the click-clack of side snare rolls and some occasionally echoing bass drum booms and cymbal washes. Call and response guitar arpeggios create a bit of a downcast mood and Andrea Zollo's vocals sound fittingly hollow. We get a brief explosion of energy with a crashing drum beat and sour guitars now playing in unison, but without the presence of the bass guitar at this point, we are still holding out for what the title promises. Then things suddenly shift into full technicolor with a pumped up tempo, a driving rhythm, and some organ peppered in for more flavour. We are off to the races. Another powerful moment later in the song is the guitar solo. These patient runs are performed with so much attitude and the aggressive punch that caps off this section is an amazing exclamation point.\n\nGrandmother Wolf is another stellar track that features a strong rhythmic foundation thanks to a great bassline from Derek Fudesco and propelling tambourine strikes. I love the fuzz distortion applied to Zollo's vocals as she sings over mashing guitars, as well as the strong vocal harmonies that come and go throughout the song. This song also ends in a much different place than where it started. It closes out on a bit of a sad jam where guitars and pianos kind of roam free over the steady pulse of a kick drum. A brief chiptune interlude goes right into All Medicated Geniuses; an absolute barn burner. This track sees the return of those fiery guitars and also displays the unique interplay between guitarists J. Clark and Nathan Thelen. The two would often play opposite, often contradicting guitar lines, and yet, are miraculously complimentary when stacked on top of each other. This track perhaps also has the most post-hardcore energy given the boys' hollers at the song's introduction, and the particularly hungry vocal delivery of Zollo.\n\nChemical, Chemical has a similar level of kinetic energy, although, I find this one to be even more catchy given its more dance punk sensibilities. The rhythm section really shines on this track as Fudesco's descending bassline really pops; making it's statement in the first part of the phrase and then dropping out to let your mind wrap around the other chaotic elements that are going on. Nick Dewitt's drumming is incredibly nuanced; whether it be the fills he uses to season the otherwise very rigid four-four dance groove he's got going on, or the emphasis on feel he places in one of the verse sections. One of my favourite drum moments actually occurs before the beginning of the second verse. Dewitt exhibits just a little bit of wild abandon before going back into that disciplined groove. It's the little tiny details like this that make Pretty Girls Make Graves' music so special to me. It's just fantastic songwriting.\n\nHalfway through, the band is already killing it. However, if you can believe it, the band still has some major heavy hitters to close out this fantastic album. The Teeth Collector is one of my all-time favourite songs. The guitars on this one are disorienting and sour, Fudesco plays a fairly angular bassline, and Dewitt plays this cool tom groove where he opts to let an open hi-hat hang in the place of an expected snare hit. The result is a groove with a lot of propulsion up front followed by a moment of suspension. These verse sections just create so much tension and a great sense of unease. So much so that there is no feeling greater than when that chorus hits. The guitar melody is very sweet and hopeful, the distant backup vocals are a warm touch, and Dewitt's drum groove is even more pared-down and deliberately patient. This section is like coming to a new found clarity. It is a really special moment.\n\nHoly Names is sort of the album's outlier. The tone of it is somber and reserved and production wise, it is quite experimental with many of the song's layers being saturated in reverb and delay. There are moments where guitars literally scream and at points the guitars are very out of tune. Some could say the song is a bit of a mess with all the clashing reflections, but I actually think the track manages to find a sense of peace in the surrounding chaos. I think it is one of the more creative and cathartic statements the band pulls together here. Lastly, I'll talk about This Is Our Emergency, the album's first single. It feels like a whirlwind of self-help with the unrelentingly sweet guitars and Zollo's rapid fire verses. I particularly love how Dewitt seemingly improvises over the whole track, and not once does he play out of turn. The melody and tone of the track is very uplifting, perhaps the warmest, most inviting, and genuine moment on the record.\n\nPretty Girls Make Graves are a really special band and The New Romance is a really special record. They are such incredible musicians, but listening to this gives me the sense that they are really modest about it. When everyone can play and you've already developed this chaotic style, exercising restraint can become your biggest strength. Nothing ever gets too far out of hand, and everything stays accessible, fun, and exciting. I'm not sure if I've done enough to convince you that this record is perfect, but I hope my passion sufficiently comes across in order to get you to listen to this underrated, unique, and important band.\n\n10\n\nStandouts: The whole record."
