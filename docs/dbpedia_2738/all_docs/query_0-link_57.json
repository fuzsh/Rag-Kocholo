The truck then hit a rock wall and burst into flames, the AP reported.\n\nThe Beachy Amish Mennonite family, from Burkesville, Ky., was headed to Iowa for a wedding, according to news reports.\n\nThe highway where the accident occurred has barrier cables to prevent vehicles from crossing the median, but they were not strong enough to stop the tractor-trailer, which was loaded with auto parts, Kentucky police told the AP and The New York Times.\n\nThose killed were John and Sadie Esh; their children, Anna, Rose, Rachel and Leroy; Leroy Esh's wife, Naomi, and their infant son, Jalen; Rachel Esh's fiance, Joel Gingerich; and family friend Ashlie Kramer. Also dead is Kenneth Laymon of Alabama, who was driving the truck.\n\nLeroy Kauffman, pastor of Marrowbone Christian Brotherhood in Burkesville, Ky., told The New York Times that the Esh family had recorded four gospel albums and had children serving as missionaries broad.\n\n\"They has a real mission heart,\" Kauffman said.\n\nJohn Esh was assistant pastor at Marrowbone, part of the Maranatha Amish Mennonite Churches. He and Kauffman had moved to Kentucky from North Carolina 11 years ago to plant the church, Kauffman told The New york Times.\n\nThe Esh family's house had burned down in December, and church members built them a new home, Kauffman said.\n\n\"We're experiencing a lot of heartache and a lot of sadness, but with that a hope,\" Kauffman said in the AP report. \"We know where these people are going. They were all saved Christians and walking with the Lord.\"\n\nMaranatha Amish Mennonites are one of several moderate-conservative Beachy subgroups, wrote Cora A. Anderson in a June 2008 article in Mennonite Weekly Review.\n\nNow including 16 congregations, the Maranatha Amish Mennonites formed in 1997 over disagreements with the broader Beachy church, especially a perceived lack of accountability, Anderson wrote on beachyam.org.\n\nMennonite Weekly Review obituary: 2010 Apr 12 p. 1\n\ntext of obituary:\n\nThousands mourn Kentucky family\n\nCommunity finds comfort in faith after deaths of 9\n\nBy Carmen K. Sisson\n\nFor Mennonite Weekly Review\n\nMARROWBONE, Ky. — Hearts were heavy but cheeks were mostly dry March 20 as more than 3,000 mourners gathered to say goodby to nine members of a Mennonite community who perished in a fiery crash on Interstate 65 near Munfordville.\n\nFriends said John Esh, an associate pastor of Marrowbone Christian Brotherhood, a Beachy Amish Mennonite congregation, would have wanted it that way.\n\nEsh, who died in the March 26 crash, dedicated his life to uplifting others, quietly leading by example, jubilantly celebrating in song.\n\nEsh and his wife, Sadie, who also died in the crash, survived the loss of a son four years ago and a devastating house fire in December, yet their message never changed: Keep hope. Keep faith. Keep strong, Keep going.\n\nIt is that strength of spirit to which this 18-family community, nestled within the hills of south-central Kentucky, is clinging as the church struggles to accept the loss of nearly a tenth of its members.\n\nThe crash, which cost 11 lives, was believed to be the deadliest motor vehicle accident in Kentucky since 1988.\n\nA tractor-trailer hauling brake drums left the southbound lane of I-6t, crossed a 60-foot grass median, plowed through a cable barrier and struck a 15-passenger van head-on before hitting a rock embankment and bursting into flames.\n\nTen of the 12 Mennonites in the van — eight of whom were members of the Esh family and a ninth soon to be an in-law — died on impact.\n\nKilled were John Esh, 64; his wife, Sadie, 62; their daughters, Rose, 40; Anna, 33; and Rachel, 20; Rachel's fiancé, Joel Gingrich, 22: John and Sadie's son, Leroy, 41; Leroy's wife, Naomi, 33; Leroy and Naomi\"s adopted son, Jalen, 2 months; and family friend Ashlie Kramer, 22, of Franklin. Truck driver Kenneth Laymon, 45, of Alabama, also died.\n\nLeroy and Naomi Esh had two other adopted sons, Josiah and Johnny Esh, who survived the crash and will now be cared for by relatives in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"We don't understand this,\" said funeral director John H. Schmucker. \"They were one of the pillars of our church. We don't understand the leaving behind of the two little orphans, but we trust God that he has a purpose.\"\n\nSchmucker said he sees the national media attention as a good thing to come out of the tragedy, offering people an opportunity to learn more about conservative Mennonites and opening a dialogue on their faith.\n\nStrong despite losses\n\nMarrowbone Christian Brotherhood, an outgrowth of a New Order Amish group in Yanceyville, N.C., has only been in existence 10 years and, until this eek, had just one grave in its cemetery — that of John and Sadie's eldest son, Johnny Esh Jr.\n\nBut times are changing. Hoping to expand their outreach, the church transitioned to Beachy Amish a few years ago and allowed its members to start driving motorized vehicles. Pastor Leroy Kauffman's son, Michael, now drives a Chevrolet Suburban and a Dodge work truck, but he said he misses his horse and buggy sometimes, especially on beautiful Sunday afternoons.\n\nSome members use the Internet , and online memorials have sprung up for the Eshes, including a Facebook group and YouTube videos featuring music from the family's four compact disc releases.\n\nThe church remains strong despite its losses, its members committed to helping one another through their shared tragedy.\n\nThree days before the funeral, as the sun slipped behind the hills and a chill wind swept over the pastureland, more than two dozen men from Mennonite communities in Kentucky and Tennessee gathered to dig plots and build \"rough boxes\" for the coffins. Most had never done such a thing.\n\nInstead of focusing on tragedy during the funeral, Bishop Leroy Kauffman challenged mourners, most of whom were Mennonites and Amish, to examine their hearts and ask themselves if they will be ready \"when the lights shine through the windshield.\"\n\n\"From what we knew, this group was readyd to meet God and stand at the judgment,\" Kauffman said. \"We don't try to make sense of it. This is for all of us. Some of us may not be ready to meet God.\"\n\nSherry Gore, who drove 18 hours from Pinecraft, Fla., to pay her respects, said there was no question about the content of John Esh's heart.\n\n\"He was the nicest man in the world,\" Gore said. \"I've never met anyone more concerned for someone's soul.\"\n\nTears welled in her eyes as she recalled a time when her daughter was ill. Every Monday, for five months, John Esh called her to check on the girl's health and the worried mother's spiritual well-being.\n\n\"He would always ask, 'Are you staying faithful to Christ?'\" Gore said, staring out across the parking lot of the Marrowbone Christian Brotherhood community building, gazing at the sea of people gathered outside the metal building to watch eight wooden coffins being loaded into hearses. \"And I was only one person. How many others did he call?\"\n\nGore was particularly struck by the Eshes' humility after a fire reduced the family's home to a bare slab three months ago. As church members raced to erect a new house, John Esh agonized over the details, Gore said. Did he really need oak doors and trim? Painted wood was good enough for him. He didn't want God to be displeased that he was being overindulgent. Everyone had escaped the fire unharmed, and as long as they were together, what more did they need?\n\nGaps left behind\n\nThe gaps the Eshes leave behind are palpable. There was Rose, remembered as \"quiet, weak in mind, but always smiling,\" who Gore said touched lives not so much by her voice but by the beautiful letters of encouragemetn she crafted and sent to others.\n\nThen there was Anna, who took her brother Johnny's place as a missionary in Ukraine four years ago after he died in a snowmobiling accident. This month, she was planning a mission trip to Brazil, but even in her excitement, she never forgot her personal mission — ministering to widows. Among her belongings were found numerous to-do lists. On her last list: \"Three more widows to visit.\"\n\nRachel Esh and Joel Gingerich, both in their early 20s, were planning a July wedding. Days before his death, Joel purchased two dozen roses for the girl Gore said was so filled with life she almost bounced into rooms.\n\n\"They were inseparable,\" Gore said. \"It was so obvious they were in love.\"\n\nFor Leroy and Naomi Esh, their children were their life. After struggling for years with infertility, they finally decided to adopt. After1 16 months fighting through red tape in Guatemala, they finally found a use for the baby clothes Naomi had been sewing in faith that someday their dream of being parents would come true. They adopted three children: Josiah, now 5, and Johnny, now 3, both of whom survived the crash.\n\nTwo-month-old Jalen, who'd only been with them for three weeks, died in the accident and was buried at his mother's feet.\n\n\"You can't survive something like this without God,\" Gore said. \"As tragic as this seems, it will only serve to strengthen the church as a whole.\""
