A third set of corrections and additions is given to the World Catalogue of Dytiscidae (NILSSON 2001) including the first and second sets of corrections and additions (NILSSON 2003 & 2004). Megadytes lherminieri (GUÉRIN-MÉNEVILLE, 1829) has priority over M. giganteus (LAPORTE, 1835). The species name Dytiscus silphoides PONZA, 1805 is declared as a nomen oblitum, in order to ensure the continuous usage of its junior synonym Deronectes opatrinus (GERMAR, 1824) as a valid name (nomen protectum). The preoccupied name Hydroporus ruficeps AUBÉ, 1838 is replaced with Hydroporus pseudoniger nom.n. New taxa published before January 1, 2006 are added. The number of recent species of the family Dytiscidae is now 3959.

Peruzuphium n. gen. giachinoi n. sp., a notable new species of the tribe Zuphiini from Peru with uncertain affinities, is described. It is the first zuphiine species recorded from Peru and is compared in particular to Metaxidius brunnipennis Chaudoir, another rare South American zuphiine species with uncertain affinities, which is discussed and illustrated too. A key to all genera of South American Zuphiini is finally provided.
