Hydroporus sejilashan sp. n. is described from Xizang Autonomous Region (Qinghai-Tibet Plateau), China. It belongs to the acutangulus-complex of the Hydroporus planus-group and can be separated from all four other members of the species complex by the completely distinctly matt surface in both sexes. In addition it can be distinguished from Hydroporus acutangulus Thomson, 1856 and H. polaris Fall, 1923 by the shape of the anterior protarsal claw, which is strongly curved near the base and more straight distally in the latter two species, but evenly curved in the new species and in the other two species of the complex, namely H. tibetanus Zaitzev, 1953 and H. tuvaensis Pederzani, 2001. The habitus of all five members of the complex are provided, along with illustrations of the male and female genitalia of the new species and those of H. tibetanus. The lectotype of H. sumakovi Poppius, 1912, a taxon which until now has been treated as a junior synonym of H. acutangulus, is designated. Preliminary studies reveal that H. sumakovi is probably more closely related to H. polaris than to H. acutangulus. Older, doubtful previous records of Hydroporus nigellus Mannerheim, 1853 from China are confirmed with new records from Qinghai and Sichuan Provinces. Twelve species of the genus Hydroporus Clairville, 1806 are now known from China, only two of which occur in Tibet.

A third set of corrections and additions is given to the World Catalogue of Dytiscidae (NILSSON 2001) including the first and second sets of corrections and additions (NILSSON 2003 & 2004). Megadytes lherminieri (GUÉRIN-MÉNEVILLE, 1829) has priority over M. giganteus (LAPORTE, 1835). The species name Dytiscus silphoides PONZA, 1805 is declared as a nomen oblitum, in order to ensure the continuous usage of its junior synonym Deronectes opatrinus (GERMAR, 1824) as a valid name (nomen protectum). The preoccupied name Hydroporus ruficeps AUBÉ, 1838 is replaced with Hydroporus pseudoniger nom.n. New taxa published before January 1, 2006 are added. The number of recent species of the family Dytiscidae is now 3959.

Graptodytes laeticulus (SHARP, 1882) from northern Africa was treated as a junior subjective synonym of G. varius (AUBÉ, 1838) since a long time ago. It is here re-instated as a valid species and the differences between the two species are illustrated and described. Both belong to a complex of species which includes also G. ignotus (MULSANT & REY, 1861), G. fractus (SHARP, 1882), and G. kuchtae (BREIT, 1908). Some notes on the latter species and on the var. pauper (O. SCHMIDT, 1903) of G. varius are added. Notes on Hydroporus narentinus ZIMMERMANN, 1915 (a junior subjective synonym of G. bilineatus (STURM, 1835)) and the var. dalmatinus ZIMMERMANN, 1932 of G. bilineatus are given. New Algerian records of G. pietrii NORMAND, 1933 are added. Graptodytes parisii GRIDELLI, 1939 is only known from the female holotype, which was collected 1936 in the Tassili mountain range in southeastern Algeria. The holotype could be studied for the first time after its original description. It shows some characters which make its attribution to any of the known genera impossible – even the correct subtribe is unclear. Thus, it was necessary to introduce the new genus Tassilodytes nov.gen. and to give an exhaustive redescription of the species. Lectotypes are designated for Hydroporus kuchtae BREIT, 1908, Hydroporus laeticulus SHARP, 1882, and Hydroporus narentinus ZIMMERMANN, 1915. The genus Graptodytes SEIDLITZ, 1887 has still 22 members, two of them bitypic. Remarks on specific names formed from personal names are added. K e y w o r d s: Coleoptera, Dytiscidae, Hydroporinae, Graptodytes, Tassilodytes, new genus, lectotype, re-instatement of rank.

Fery, H. & Nilsson, A. N.: A revision of the Agabus chalconatus- and erichsoni-groups (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae), with a proposed phylogeny. Ent. scand. 24: 79-108. Copenhagen, Denmark. April 1993. ISSN 0013-8711. The Holarctic chalconatus- and erichsoni-groups, with 19 and three species respectively, are revised. The following seven new species are described: Agabus balkei from Siberia, Agabus jaechi from Turkey, Agabus larsoni from Canada, Agabus lenkoranensis from Azerbaijan, Agabus pederzanii from Italy, Agabus samokovi from Bulgaria, and Agabus wewalkai from Turkey. Lectotypes are designated for the following nominal species: Dytiscus chalconatus Panzer, 1796, Dytiscus nigroaeneus Marsham, 1802, Colymbetes montanus Stephens, 1828, Agabus neglectus Erichson, 1837, Agabus subtilis Erichson, 1837, Agabus gagates Aubé, 1838, Agabus altaicus Gebler, 1848, Agabus erichsoni Gemminger & Harold, 1868, Gaurodytes lutosus Crotch, 1873, Agabus fuscoaenescens Régimbart, 1877, Agabus aenescens Poppius, 1905, Agabus satunini Zaitzev, 1913, and Agabus melanocornis Zimmermann, 1915. The following new synonyms are established: Agabus altaicus Gebler, 1848 = Agabus subtilis Erichson, 1837; Agabus melanocornis Zimmermann, 1915 = Colymbetes montanus Stephens, 1828; Gaurodytes bulgaricus Csiki, 1943 = Dytiscus conspersus Marsham, 1802; Agabus skiathos Hinterseher, 1981 = Agabus pseudoneglectus Franciscolo, 1972; and Agabus maestroae Fresneda & Hernando, 1987 = Agabus albarracinensis Fery, 1986. Agabus aenescens Poppius, 1905, and A. satunini Zaitzev, 1913, are recognized as valid species (sp. rev.). The chalconatus-group is divided into four subgroups and the phylogeny of the group is reconstructed. The relationships of the chalconatus- and erichsoni-groups with other Agabus species-groups and with Ilybius Erichson are discussed.
