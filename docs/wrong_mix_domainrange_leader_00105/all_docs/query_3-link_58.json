'Arafat has answered AL-SHA'B questions concerning his evaluation of the steadfa~tness and confrontation procession after 2 years of the treasonous visit. He has also talked about the Tunis summit and what he expects of it as a summit \"that must be advanced.\" He has also pointed out that the works of the latest conference of the Arab ministers of f oreign affairs constituted a victory for the reality under which we live. Yasir 'Arafat also touched on the situation in southern Lebanon, saying that the Zionist enemy uses southern Lebanon as an experimental field - against our children and women and that we have no choice, as he says, but to fight against the enemy's barbaric attacks. After citing the examples of the Algerian and Vietnamese revolutions in steadfastness, the Palestinian revolution leader analyzed the dimensions of the popular uprising currently sweeping the West Bank. He then defined the Pale~tinian revolution's position toward *_he Iranian revolution which is facing an economic war, in the full sense of the world, launched by the United States. 1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 \" He finally said that the alternative to the Camp David accords is fighting and continuation of the fight, wondering how Carter can use the oil weapon _ and the weapon of freezing assets against Iran in 48 hours while we, the Arabs, are not entitled to use any of our weapons! After his return from Moscow and in the midst of his preparations for tbe Arab summit, AL-SHA'B in terviewed PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, and conducted with him a dialogue dealing with the West Bank and Gaza upris ing and, the Palestinian revolution's position toward the ongoing conf rontation between the Iranian revolution and the United States of America. The Palestinian revolution commander answered AL-SHA'B questions with utt~r ~ frankness, focusing the lights on the developments being currently under- gone by the Middle East area. Even though the interview that our corrP~pondent in Beirut conducted had been designed to deal w ith the second anniversary of the ominous 19 Nove~ ber and to evaluate the steadfastness and confrontation procession organized to answer the trip of treason and shame made by al-Sadat to the occupied Jerusalem on this day in 1971, the fast-moving current developments that are connected in more than one way with the national reply to the plot, made it inevitable but to touch on these issues. Abu-'Ammar, the general comanan- der of the Palestinian revolution, agreed, thankfully, to define to AL- SHA'B his positions toward these issues, declaring that the resistance has put its forces on the alert to participate in confronting any aggression to which the revolutionary Iran may be exposed. Abu-'Ammar has not ruled out the possibility that the imperialist-Zionist alliance may commit another folly in the area. He has also stressed that the Camp David musketeers have not b een ab 1e to move a s ingle s tep f orward. Abu-'Ammar has told AL-SHA'B that Algeria is prepared to take part in any liberation war and that, like the Palestinian revolution, Algeria makes its own decision. He also s aid that all the Arabs have to do is to respond to the Algerian and Palestinian revolutions so that we may initiate the vic- torious offensive and f oil the plot against our Arab nation. Following is the verbatim text of the interview conducted with brother Abu-'Ammar in one of the revolution's positions: [QuestionJ zn the 2 years since the treasonous visit to Jerusalem, the Palestinian revolution has scored further political and military victories and the tripartite alliance [U.S.-Egyptian-Israeli] has reached a deadend. What is your evaluation of the steadfastness and confrontation march after these 2 years? [Answer] There is no doubt that the resignations taking place in the Zionist entity currently indicate the dilemma faced by Camp D2vid. Tt?e ~ attentior~ of whoever keeps up with the Egyptian information media is 2 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007102/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 arrested by the hysterical attack against the Steadfastness and Confronta- tion Front, against the leaders of the front, against the Baghdad summit, against the Baghdad suuunit resolutions and against the Arab ministers of f oreign affairs and f inance. These frenzied actions and th~s suspect cam- paign that is being launched by the Camp David parties against the Pales- tinian revolution and against the Palestinian revolution le adership in particular are the biggest indication of the dileuuna and the deadend reached - by the Camp David parties. I want to ask, where is the \"halo\" that used to surround al- Sadat? Where is the hero of peace? The hero of peace watches the crushin g war launched by the Zionist forces against the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples while shaking hands with Ezer Weizman, the Israeli minister of war, who has just come to Cairo from southern Lebanon or who is just about to return from Cairo to southern Lebanon to intensify his~~military operations against the Leb anese and Palestinian peoples! This is why I say tha t the events of the past 2 years have proven that we have gone beyond the phase of steadfastness and have begun the phase of successful confron tation. We have besieged the Camp David parties. What is occurring in the occupied territories provides the proof that the Camp David musketeers are incap- able of moving a single step forward in the self-rule plat and that they are at the threshold of a new defeat. [Question] Do you expect the Tunis summit to constitute an advanced step on the conf rontation path and to surpass the minimum-limit r esolutions of the Baghdad su~�nit? [Answer? The Tunis suumiit must be advanced. It must be advanced. This - is what we agreed upon with my brothers the Arab heads of state ar the Algiers conference when the leaders of the Steadfastness and Confrontation Front countries met during the 25th anniversary of the inception of the Algerian revolution. We have also agreed with the Iraqi bro thers in the wake of the meeting with brother President Saddam Husayn. This means that we refuse to have the Tunis summit constitute a step backward, if not a step forward at least. We accept no retreat. [Question] Doesn't approval of the Arab summit agenda as agreed upon by the Ara~ ministers of foreign affairs constitute a victory f or the stead- f astness and confrontation position? [Answer] I will not say that it constitutes a victory for anybody but I will say that it constitutes a victory for the reality under which we live. Our Arab nation is facing a plot. All that is happening in southern Lebanon, in northwest Africa, in the northern front and inside the occupied territories is nothing but the ramifications of the Camp David plot. We expected this as of the moment in which al-Sadat went to Jerusalem and as of the moment in which the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty--the treaty of capitulation and of humiliation and shame--was signed. 3 - APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007102/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 [Question] Haw does the Palestinian resistance view the possibilities of a solution in southern Leb anon and how does it view the situation there? [Answer] As I have already said, the solution in southern Lebanon lies primarily in the political decision which will be issued by the Arab sum- mit on whether we are to st and fast or not and whether we are to be or not to be. The Zionist ambitions in southern Lebanon are obvious. The Zionist plan is \"moving forth\" and is well-known and it has already been imple- mented in the Golan, in the West Bank and in Gaza Strip. Confronting the Zionist plan is a must. What is required is a political decision. I as k: Does the Arab nation want to ha~e a truce with the Zionist plan? No. We in the Palestinian revolution have taken the decision to confront \"and urge the believers to fight.\" It can only cost life. By God, if my rifle were the only one, I would still fight. We have a just cause. We are the victims of an aggression. It is the right of all states whose lands are occupied and all states which are at tacked to f ight in defense of their lands, of their honor, their dignity and their future. This is the Palestinian revolu- tion's decision and the decis~on of all the free and honorable men in the Arab homeland. We must consider this a fundamental point in confronting the bitter reality under which the Lebanese and Palestinian masses are living. This is the responsibility of the Arab summit which must provide these masses with protection, care, refuge and compensations. What is important is the decision. What is required of our Arab nation is the political ' decision. The Palestinian revolution's decision is to continue the confrontation and the steadfastness--this mythical steadfastness that have gone on for 7 months _ under the hell in which we have been living in Lebanon. What has happened? They have used the latest U.S. weapons--the F-15's and F-16's. Even the F-18's which they have not yet used do not intimidate us. Let them use them and let them use with them even F-80's. They are welcome. - Did the Vietnamese succumb ? We will not succumb. The Vietnamese did not succumb and, therefore, we will not succumb. The Algerians did not succumb and, therefore, we will no t siiccumb. Our nation has enormous resources and the Palestinian revolution is on the threshold of the 16th year of its life. It is the longest Arab revolution and it is still steadfast everywhere. It is steadfast in the occupied Jordan [sic]. There are 11,000 policemen, beside the Zionist army, to confront the escalating operations of the Palestinian revolutionaries in the occupied territories. The Zionist enemy is using Lebanon as an experimental field against child- ren and women and is testin g the U.S. weapons there. We have no choice but to fight against his b arbaric attacks. [Question] Where does the brother general commander of the Palestinian revolution place the event that is preoccupying the world at present, namely the uprising of the occupied territories, and what are its dimensions in the confrontation battle a gainst the Camp David plot and its tripartite alliance, especially under the present circumstances? 4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 [Answer] First, we must examine what is h appening in t}~e occupied terri- tories, considering that they are one of the fundamental fronts on which we are fighting against the Camp David plot. At the same time, it is one of the fronts in which the Carter-Begin-al-Sadat trio has launched its counter-attack in retaliation for the steadfastness and confron tation resolutions which were followed by the Baghdad su~nit after which came the conference of the Arab ministers of f oreign affairs and finance to implement the resolutions agreed upon. This counter-attack h as been focused on our people in the occupied terri- tories and has taken the form of a number of serious, fascist and oppressive measures, such as the confiscation of land, the construction of settlements, terrurization of the population through deportation and detention and the adoption of collective punitive measures against towns and villages--mea- sures which have reached the point of seiz ing the sources of water. As a result, our people in the occupied territories have produced th is magnifi- cent reply which is currently crowned by the splendid popular uprising against the Zionist authorities' decisions to depoct one of our cadres and of the leaders of our people in the occupied territories, namely brother Bassam al-Shak'ah, the mayor of Nabulus. The other side of the battle is the intensifying military war of attrition against our Lebanese and Palestinian peoples--a war in which the latest weapons, even those banned internationally, are used, causing the destruc- tion of numerous Lebanese towns and villages and of Palestinian camps and the eviction of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese and Palestin ians. The fact is that this infernal terrorist war is still going on and ttiat the Zionist enemy leaders are still implementing it. But this will not intimidate us and will not cause us to hesitate in retaliating against the enemy, whether in the occupied territories or in southern Lebanon, with all the means af mi litary and political struggle. We have all become experienced in this struggle and we, and all the Arabs - with us, will not retreat. Our steadfastness has proven that the Arab nation does not lack the resolution and th e steadfastness. [Question] The current battle between the Iranian revolution and the United States of America seems to be open to all possibilities. After the talk about a Palestinian mediation came the Palestinian statement warning the United States of the consequences of a ggression and declaring that the Palestinian revolution stands with the Ir anian revolution in the same trencii. How do you view the steps of this confrontation? [Answer] rirst, we have not and will not exert mediation efforts with the - Iranian revolution concerning the hostages detained in the U.S. embassy. We and the Iranian revolution are in one trench. ~Iowever, we did move at the outset and made swift contacts with our Iranian brothers on the basis of the principle that this country is a friend of the [Palestinian] revolution. We moved accordingly and Brig Gen Sa'd Sayil, alias Abu-a1- Walid, the chief of the operaticns room, was sent to Iran to explore the 5 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007102/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 situation. In the wake of the developments that have taken place, begin- ning with the stopped importation of Iranian oil and the freezing of the Iranian assets in U.S. banks by the United States, and after U.S., British and Aus tr alian military moves to display their militar~ muscle in prenara- tion for committing some foolish acts, we are now viewing the situation from a d ifferent angle. The decision to freeze the Iranian assets in U.S. banks is a serious and unparalleled precedence in the world. This means - that they are pushing the area toward the brink of war, especially since this happened at a time when brother Bani Sadr (the present minister of foreign affairs) declared the readiness of the Iranian officials to release some det ainees. The U.S, decision to stop the importation of oil was taken at this time. I see real danger in the freezing of assets and in the U.S. ' military movement and it is no speculation to say that it is \"a declaration of war.\" We are observing .the movement that accompanies the U.S. intensifi- cation and we are analyzing the bases on which the parallel Zionist move- ment will take place and in what direction this movement will proceed. There- - fore, we are studying the reply to this movement. I have given an order that our forces be put on the alert so that they may be ready to support the Iranian revolution or to answer any attack that the Zionist enemy may be thinking of launching against our people in southern Lebanon. I am warning that the clouds of war are now gathering in the area. The United S t ates and its ally, the Zionist entity, are responsible f or any folly committed by either of these two allies and to which the other [al- - SadatJ a 1 ly may be dragged. [Question] Some people consider the escalated U.S, confrontation against the Iranian revolution, the ban on the imp~rtation of oil and the freezing of the assets as tantamount to an advance warning to the Arab summit, especially to those ~~aho think of using the weapon of oil and of Arab assets. What is the Palestinian revolution's answer to such a warning? [Answer] Historical stances are not measured by the yardstick of loss a~d , profit. Consequently, I disagree with any person in our Arab nation who measures matters with this yardstick. \"0 you believers, you have been - destined to fight and you may hate something that is good for you.\" [Loose - translati on of Koran quotation] As for th e warning, especially to the Palestinian revolution, I say that _ the Palestinian revolution threatens and is not threatened and warns and is not warned. The Palestinian revolution has repeatedly declared its opinion on this issue with utter clarity. [QuestionJ Your latest visit to the Soviet Union on the eve of the Arab summit and of the U.S.-Iranian confrontation battle has been placed within - the framework of organizing the conf rontation and giving it an international - dimension. What is your opinion of this interpretation? [Answer] There is no doubt that my visit to the Soviet Union has been successfu 1 and it will certainly b e ref lected on the situation. I prefer to let th e events talk. 6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-00850R040240040026-7 [Question] Does the visit have any connection with t~:~ steadfastness and confrontation conference held in Algiers recently? [Answer] The~~most importan t aspect of the Algiers conference is that we formul~ced in it a common plan to confront all the current developments In tlie area, Lncludin~; coorclination duri.n~ the forthcomin~ 1'unis cc~nfc~rence. [Question] Some people wondEr about the alternative program to the Camp David accords. What does the Palestinian revolution say? ~i [Answer] The Palestinian revolution has offered the alternative. The alternative is military escalation. The alternative is this large-scale diplomatic movement. The revolution has projectPd the alternative with this vast political activity, even inside the United States itself.. Let me ask: What was the alternative before France in World War II? There was (Beitan) and there was de Gaulle. (Beitan) called for surrender to Nazism. De Gaulle said no we will not surrender and he triumphed. ~ The alternative is ~:o continue fighting and is in continued fighting. The alternative is in s~.eadf as tness. The alterna~ive is in confrontation. There will come the day wl~en our Arab nation will be able to regain its terri- tories. It has bee~i proven throughout history that the victory of oppt�ession _ does not last. We notice that throughout history, the forces of oppression were not able to stand fast. The French stayed in Algeria for 130 years and used to say that Algeria was French. Where is France now insofar as Algeria is concerned? We celebrated at the beginning of this month the 25th anniversary oE the inception of the victorious Algerian revolution and we saw the weapons that are ready to take part with us when we adopt the decision for the compre- hensive confrontation. We saw the Mig-25's, the SAM-9's and the 72 tank, in addition to the latest weapons. I am certain that the Algerian revolu- tion is ready to take part in the laberation war when it flares up. I repeat that what is important is to adopt the decision, the stea~'fastness decision. 'Ct~e dccLsion is rl~at of steadfastness ar present. The Palestinian revolu- tion l~as been ahlc. to move Erom the steadfastness decision to impleinenting the decision of political, military, diplomatic and popular confrontation at more than anc front. The Arab nation is required to move and to get prepared to use its weapons. Within 48 hours, Carter used the oil weapon and weapon of freezing assets. Aren't we entitled to use any of our weapons? It is as the poet has said: - Forbidden to its nightingales is the branch; but permitted to birds of all otlier kinds. ~re we forbid~ien to use our weapons whereas the United States is permitted to use its weapons against Iran and to exploit its economic weapons against _ Ciiba and China while we fiesitate to use one single weapon of ours? 8494 c:S(~: 4802 ~ APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 - INTER-ARAB AFFAIRS SALAH KHALAF DISCUSSES LEBANESE PROBLEM, SAYS PALESTINIAN STATE IMMINENT Beirut AL-ANWAR in Arabic 2 Nov 79 pp 4-5, 11 - (Interview with Salah Khalaf by Fu'ad Da~bul and George Tarabulsi: \"Text ! _ of Abu-Iyad's Interview With AL-ANWAR: I Call on Lebanese Front for !

He added� We support any measure that has been taken or will be taken in the future to abolish the armed manifestations. Abu-Iyad declared: The Palestinian state will be realized in a shorter time than most observers expect. I do not want to divulge a secret but what I want to say is that all the contacts that are taking place are bringing closer the close~ and ver.y close, zero hour. Following is the text of the interview: [Question] The key to an interview with Abu-Iyad is this traditional question: Where does the path to Palestine pass through? [Answer] (Laughingly) Strange. I have explained this point more than once. (Question] We would like to hear it [explanation] from you once more. [Answer] I am not evading an answer to this question. On the contrary, there are many things that are more important to talk about. I am telling this story for the tenth time. However, there is no harm in repeating it to AL-ANWAR. I was making ~ speech on the occasion of the martyrdom of two Lebanese in the area of 'Aynturah. A woman came weeping and bemoaning to the podium and said: Wouldn't it have been better for them to have been martyred for Palestine? I was deeply touched and walked down from the podium to her. to try to comfort her. While talking with her, ~ne of those present interrupted and said loudly something to the effect that the path to Palestine passes through Junyah, 'Aynturah, etc. It so happened that a journalist was present and reported the statement, attributing it to me. The Phalanges radio got enraged and launched a scathing atCack against me. The truth is that I did not wieh to answer those attacks ;it the time because of the special circumstances under which the country was living. However, I did explain the matter properly when the storm had subsided. Believe me I did not make that statement and also believe me ChatI am not one to make such statements. Reorganizing Relations (Question] Brother Abu-Iyad, the fact is that you are now in charge of reorganizing the Lebanese-Palestinian relations and that you are exerting thankful efforts in this regard. Where have these efforts of yours reached so far? - [Answer] The fact is that I am not exerting these efforts on a personal basis but on assignment by the other brothers. 9 - APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 I believe that the meeting that has taken place between brother Abu-'Ammar and President Sarkis (and before him with Prime Minister al-Huss) constituted _ a positive and very important phase, especially at a time when the issue of Lebanon and of its southern part and our issue in particular are passing through a very serious stage in which only serious and positive statements are permissible. This meeting crowned a series of ineetings held with several sides and all those meetings were positive. Their outcome is not tangible yet. However, the good results of the meetings will show shortly. Listen carefully to what I am going to say. One side, even two sides together, cannot play a positive role in isolation from the other sides. It is not enough for the government to be positive and it is not enough _ for the resistance to be positive. Positivity must the slogan of all the parties concerned and all concerned should sit around the negotiations table and solve all the problems. Here, we must not forget Syria's role, regardless of the opinion of some . - sides in the Arab Deterrence Forces, because Syria has its influential role on the Lebanese stage, like it or not. Disregarding Syria's role in any political solution is in itself a disregarding of reason and of logic. Therefore, I say that an understanding must be reached with the legitimate - Lebanese government and this government must be made to represent all so that when an understanding is reached between the government and the resis- tance, this understanding will be reflected on all concerned. The legitimate government [al-shar'iyah] is the first and the last authority and it is the big river into which all the other tributaries must flow and in which they must p].ace their trust, beginning with the National Movement and National Front and ending with the Lebanese Front, because the solution will come with and through the government. There is no alternative to the govern- ment, not now and not in the future. Lebanon's salvation will come through _ understanding and without an understanding there will be no solution, regard- less of what moves the parties concerned made and regardless of how sincere _ they are in their moves. [Question] You are talking about the solution, frankly? Is there one problem or are there several problems on the Lebanese stage. What is the link between them [problems] and where is the starting point? [Answer] Fragmenting the problems in Lebanon is a very faulty thing. However, it can be said that there are hotter problems than others and there are problems that can be postponed and others that cannot. The hot problem presently is the south. But the other problems are no less hot than it is. The north is a problem. What is happening in the eastern area is a problem and what is happening in the western area is also a problem. - The legitimate government's control over all the Lebanese territories is a problem and detente is a problem. All these are problems and if you wanted 10 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 - ta arrange them on the basis of priority, you would not be able to. The solution, in my opinion, will not come except by way of a Lebanese deten~e-- as I have always stated without ever changing my opinion--and then through unanimous Lebanese detente, through the legitimate government, with the Palestinians, in the presence and under the patronage of the State of Syria. _ These are general statements. If you want details, then I can assure you that several~hands are tampering with the south and pouring oil on its raging _ fire. I will give you an example of this fact in the interview with Sa'd Haddad published by one of the newspapers. Is the aim of this interview to sabotage the solution or ~ust to get it ready? If the aim of the interview is to have the army enter the south on agreement with Sa'd Haddad, then it would have been better not to have published the interview and to have taken the feelings of the others in this regard into consideration. National Movement's Role - (Question] Sorry for interrupting you but it is said that Sa'd Haddad has embarrassed you and has exposed some of the practices to which you resort vis-a-vis the government. For example, when agreement was reached between you and the legitimate government on the army's entry to the south [words missing] to decide the agreement by throwing the bal? in the National Movement's court. Then Sa'd Haddad came and threw the ba11 in your court _ anew, thus exposing the unclear intentions in the dealings between the Palestinian revolution and the Lebanese legitimate government. What is your reply? _ [Answer] The f act is that a part of what you have said is somewhat true. But on the other hand, I cannot disregard the National Movement which has its weight on the Lebanese stage. _ Let us speak more frankly. When the Syrian forc:es, and then the Saudi forces, were evacuated from Burj Rizq, the legitimate government was compelled to negotiate with Bashir al-Jumayyil and Danny Sham'un for days to gain their approval for the army's entry to the said area. This is a reality in Lebanon created not by Abu-Iyad but by the circumstances, by the Lebanese structure - and by the equations agreed upon throughout long generations. The following question occurs to my mind here: If the Lebanese army were stronger and if the I'halanges and Liberal parties did not have their effective presence in the eastern area, would the Lebanese army command take the trouble or condescend to negotiate with this or ~;iat, as it has done with Bashir and Danny? I don't think so. But when a man is powerless he finds himself compelled to enter these areas through understanding and dialogue, exactly - as has happened between the I,ebanese army and the leaders of the Lebanese forces. 11 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 In the south, and regardless of the weight of the other forces, the National Movement has its presenc~e, its intrinsic strength and its strong entity. Suppose here that I approve the army's entry to the south and the National Movement opposes it, what would happen? The answer is very simple, namely - that r'~is movement, in cooperation with Lebanon's Arab Army, can fully prevent the army from entering, exactly like when Sa'd Haddad and his grn~p opposed the army's entry. Isn't it so? Kingdoms and Kingdoms [Question] They will prevent the army if you want this to happen. [Answer] It is not so. I approve frankness, provided that you accept my frankness also. Until now, I have not heard a single sweet word from the other side so that I may feel comfortable and may establish a balance in my relations with this side. Listen ~to Bashir's or Danny's statements, or even to the statement made by the Lebanese Front after our agreement with the government. They are statements full of defamation. This is shameful and it is a sabotaging of the solution, in my opinion. Don't take my words to mean that the Lebanese Front is solely responsible for sabotaging the solution. Not at all. There are numerous sides sabotaging it. There are kingdoms and kingdoms and every one who has his kingdom is happy with it. Let this age of kingdoms end. Let the real Lebanon live. Abdicate to the legitimate government and let it live. As for us as Palestinians, I assure you that we do not wish to support one = faction at the expense of another because we need to have all the sides satisfied. This is why I say that what has delayed the speedy entry of the army so far is the violent statement issued by the Lebanese Front and then by the opinion of the National Movement which has its presence in the south. Add to this the interview given by Sa'd Haddad. Finally, and regardless of the position of all the well-known and the secret columns that want to sabotage the solution, quote me as stating that we support the entry of the Lebanese army in the manner that the government deems fit, but on the basis of comprehensive agreement among all the sides because separate and offhanded solutions usually lead to failure most of the time. [Question] The legitimate government has projected a specific visualization or a specific working paper for the expected Arab summit and this visualization or paper is close to your personal projections. Prime Minister al-Huss has said that Lebanon cannot go to the summit without a Lebanese-Palestinian detente supported by Syria. - 12 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 We notice that this thing [visualization] which is close to yours is faltering. What we mean is that the [army's] entry to the south will establish the'government's authority at the expense of the kingdoms pres~nt there. As long as you are in agreement in your pro~ectiona, as is evident from your statements and meetings and from Prime Minister al-Huss's statements and utterances, then why do you let the other marginal obstacles obstruct the realization of your 3oint goals? (Answer] I would like in my turn, to ask you this question in view of the fact that you work in the press and keep up with the news: Do these words [of yours] apply to the eastern area? Can the army enter a single building in the said area without the approsal of the Phalanges or the Liberals? You cannot ask me, brother, to be more royalist than the king. I am telling you for the tenth time that the National Movement and the National Front - ~ have their presence that nobody can deny, not me, not you and not anybody. Never understand my words to mean that the National Movement is intransigent and opposes the solution. Not at all. The movement projects the issue within the framework of a comprehensive solution for the entire Lebanese issue. This is the movement's apinion and this is its position and I have nothing to do with the matter. This is what I have explained to Prime Minister al-Huss in my meeting with him. _ [QuestionJ What was the government's reply? ` [Answer] This question would be better addressed to Prime Minister al-Huss personally. National Movement Isn't in Our Pocket [Question) The prevalent view is that the resistance made recently international political and informational gains equal to what it will lose as a result of the army's entry to the south which will have the area of the resistance's military influence reduced. It seems that the government and the resistance do not see eye to eye in this regard. What is your opinion. [Answer] The situation is not exactly as you have pointed out. But I excuse you because the error you have fallen into is the same as that into which more than one side on the Lebanese stage has fallen. Everybody thinks that the National Movement is in our pocket. This is wrong. - It is true that we influence the movement and it influences us. But this influence is not to the degree that you or those better-informed than you - imagine. Let me give you as an example of this fact the day in which the Palestinians met with Sham'un and a1-Jumayyil. Didn't the National Movement get enraged at us? And did it leave a single word that it did not say against us? Is , this true or not? What do you want me to do? Do you want me to carry the sword and kill them because they made statements against this meeting? - 13 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 To answer your question, the positions of the resistance and those of the National Movement should not be linked because each of them has its inde- pendent presence. Even though there is cooperation between us at the level of certain matters, everything has its limits ultimately. [QuestionJ Don't you think that the resistance's weight tips the scales in ~ its favor? [Answer] These words are correct only in one case, namely when the legitimate government is in control of all of Lebanon with the exception of the area in - which we are present. But the fact is, frankly, contrary to this because there are numerous areas over which the legitimate government has no control--areas whose dossier nobody is opening. Allow me to ask you this question: Why hasn't the army entered the north? ~ You may tell me that ex-President Sulayman Franjiyah has a special viewpoint ~ in this regard. Great, but why isn't this issue raised in the same manner ' in which the issue of the south is raised in our face or in the face of the - National Movement? ' [Question] Ex-President Franjiyah's view is that the army is present in the north now and that there is no need to bring more forces from other areas because the elements that are currently there are enough. [AnswerJ I don't know to what degree what you say agrees with the reality. All that I know is that ex-president Fran~iyah opposes the army's entry to the north. ~ In any case I have brought up this issue to demonstrate to you the lack of ; balance in the legitimate government's relations with the parties concerned ~ on the Lebanese stage. Brother, don't ask me to sell all the people at a time when the other side gives me no facilities and not even a spark of hope. We want to make matters easier than you think. I can assure you of this. As a proof of the truth of my word and of my good intentions, listen to this story: In the recent incidents in the north, five Palestinians were detained. - Nobody knows this because we have not published a statement in this regard. I understand that there is disagreement between Sulayman Franjiyah and the Phalanges or between him and Samir Ja'ja' and his group. But what do we have to do with this issue? What has our reaction been? We have not published a statement on the five detained people, why? Because we do not wish to embark on pitfalls of this kind and we do not even wish to pour oil on the fire. On the contrary, we wish to extinguish the fire with utter sincerity and seriousness. 14 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 I . , Is it true that five people were detained Ln Nahr al-Barid Camp as a spontaneous reaction to the incident [of ~~ive detained PalesCinians]. But - what did we do? Beli~ve me we sent a delegation immediately--by land--and - supplied him with a special message for the release of the detainees and with an order from the command stating that everybody is totally forbidden from getting involved in the sectarian game because it does not serve the Palestinian cause but ratfier obstructs it and diverts it from its correct line and its real goals. Why don't you look for the roots? When will we see all the Lebanese concerned seated around one table, talking and solving their problems with pure hearts and with absolute faith? Believe me that we will gain more at such a time. Why? Because when I have t~min al-Jumayyil, George Hawi, Danny Sham'un and others on my side, my cause is further strengthened internally, externally and in the Palestinian state. Brother, it is time for us to get rid of you and for you to get rid of us. It is time to break this partnership. Isn't it? - [Question] Brother Abu-Iyad, you have asked for frankness in the discussion, haven't you? [AnswerJ Yes, and I insist on frankness. Self-Criticism [Question] Whatever form and manner the dialogue between the Lebanese Front and the government takes, it is still a dialogue between Lebanese in their homeland, Lebanon, whereas the dialogue between the government and the National Movement is different in view of the influence of aliens, yourselves included, on this movement. This is why the Lebanese Front expects concessions, when there is talk about concessions, from you first. What is your opinion? [Answer] Le:t me ask you in my turn: Isn't the National Movement a Lebanese movement? Isn't George Hawi Lebanese and does he not have the Lebanese identity card? Isn't the Communist Party a Lebanese party licensed by the government for over 50 years? Ibrahim Qulaylat is Lebanese. Muhsin Ibrahim is Lebanese and In'am Ra'd is Lebanese. True or not? And others also. All that is there to the matter is that tlieir presence has happened to be in the area in which we are present. Therefo~e, you cannot deny their identity or their presence and you cannot turn a blind eye to their armed military presence. I invite you to the south tu see and ascertain the soundness of my words for yourself. 15 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007102/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 Let me, moreover, talk to you from a purely opportunistic position and a purely opportunistic stance. Why do you want me to sell the National Movement at a time when the other side demands that I be disarmed, be distributed like sheep among the Arab countries and be expelled from Lebanon? They say all this whereas T hear words of support and welcome from the National Movement. Should I meet all this witfi ingratitude? No, by God. Our honor prevents us from doing such a thing. _ Unity of Crooks [Question] At the outset of the two-year war, the resistance declared that the plot was aimed against it and against its entity and presence. Yet, the resistance did get involved in the fighting. Now that the storm has subsided, will the resistance engage in self-criticism so as to formulate ' a comprehensive solution for the Lebanese issue, or what? [Answer) Self-criticism should not be embarked upon by the resistance alone but by all the sides because all the sides got as deeply immersed as we did. We were only defending ourselves. I did not come to Lebanon of my own free ! will but as a result of an ignoble aggression against my country. It is true that I do not accept to have Lebanon slaughtered f or my cause, and ; it would be selfish on my part to accept such a thing, but it is also ; unreasonable for me to be idealistic to the degree whereby I let myself be ~ slaughtered for Lebanon. What is required is a balance and what is required is to give the right to those entitled to it, justly and fairly. So if a Lebanese, be he on this or that side, does not feel love for Lebanon, j am I required to be more sentimental than he is? ~ I am not talking about the opportunists, whom I attack constantly, and I am j not talking about the [war] merchants and those who collect protection money. ~ I have said in a previous statement that there is national unity in Lebanon ; between the ~rooks and the thieves. Believe me there is unity between the j two areas. They steel a car from the eastern area and sell in the western ~ area and vice versa. A bank is robbed in the western area and the robbers go to the eastern area and vice versa. Add to this all the violations in the areas of al-Biqa', Ba'labakk and others. There is a long and widespread joint-stock network which has its political detente in Lebanon. So don't ask me to engage in self-criticism alone and dor.'t ask me exclusively to liquidate my presence and my cause. Ask me to make things easier and to cooperate with the gc~vernment and I am ready to implement the request imme- - diately. 16 _ APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007102/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 The issue of the army's entry to the south does not affect my cause or my presence. In any case, it is not my right as a Palestinian to say no to the army's entry, even if this army itself does not want to enter. You are unaware that the ax~y has entered the south twice and that its vehicles come and go without be~;~t~ harassed by anybody. When the army entered Kawkaba in western al-Biqa', who assisted its entry, who facilitated - its task and who prevented it from advancing and who shelled it? This is , something that everybody should know, isn't it so? [Question] Perhaps this happened because it was the vanguards army. - [Answer] No, not at all. The army entered on the orders of the command. The army's composition is not important. What is important is that it entered on the orders of Brig Gen Victor Khuri, the army commander, to take positions in the border strip area. This army could not advance because of the shelling by Haddad's forces so it entered the areas that were under the control of thE resistance. The resistance withdrew and handed its positions over to this army. When later on Prime Minister al-Huss demanded officially in the name of the government that another battalion enter--this battalion entered the area by way of the zone under the control of the U.N. forces--it was suggested that the battalion be taken there by helicopters. We were the ones who turned ~ down this suggestion. We said it is a disgrace to our honor to let the army - resort to these means in order to move in its own country. We insisted that the army enter in the manner that it deems proper and that preserves its dignity and honor. Now I ask you to go to the south to see how the army vehicles move with utter freedom and without being impeded by any obstacles, not even obstacles created by Lebanon's Arab Army. ~ In any case, not even Lebanon's Arab Army will commit any act to undermine the Lebanese army. Should Lebanon's Arab Army do so, we will fight it. In Sidon, there is an army barracks that has been completely turned over to - the army. The same goes for Tyre where we told the command a long time ago to come and take it over. So practically, the army is in the south. One time they suggested to us that they move a battalion consisting of 200 troops from the zone of the U.N. forces operations to take over the Tyre barracks. We told them: No, leave these troops where they are and bring us others from another area. We said this because we have no problem in this regard. The truth is that those who imagine that we are against the army are wrong. We are for the army and for facilitating its mission. 17 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007102/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 - I want to tell you something, and let them deny it [if thzy can]. After the battalion (consisting of 500 troops) had entered the south, Prime Minister al-Huss wanted to add to it 56 more elements so that its sectarian structure may comply with the Lebanese equation (6 and 6 repeated). When this was done, Israel made contacts through the U.N. forces and demanded that the additional e.lements be withdrawn immediately. Do you know why? Because in accordance with the truce agreement, the Lebanese army is not permittec~ to deploy more than 1,500 elements [along the borders]. Now there are more than 1,OOQ troops among us and we wish that they would be raised by 500 or 1,000 more because we support them in every decision they make. But what is ~ required is a political solution. The problem is not one of deploying or _ not deploying the army but of linking this issue with a comprehensive solution to the Lebanese issue in its entirety. This is at least what we have under- stood from the Syrians and from the leaders of the National Movement and of the National Front. Cairo Agreement [Question] Is the Cairo agreement still extant? [Answer] The problem is not one of provisions but one of souls. Our problem � is that as long as no alternative is found, the Cairo agreement will continue to exist. [QuestionJ Now only one equation exists: To save the south or to save the Cairo agreement? Should we let the south be lost so that we may not amend, ' change or raduce this agreement? [Answer] I don't know. In any case, this issue is no t in the picture now so why are you bringing it up? [Question] Prime Minister al-Huss has been clear in an interview he gave to ' a local newspaper that the Cairo agreement is still extant but that the time is nnt right for discussing it because this is the time for saving the south. What is your opinion? [Answer] To start with, I have not been speaking to you about the Cairo agree- ment but have been trying to explain to you the viewpoint of the National Movement which insists that there is an agreement between the resistance and the Lebanese government that gives the resistance the right to move freely. If the army enters the south and sets up its roadblocks, will the freedom of movement still be given to all these factions or what? This is the question asked by the National Movement, the National Front and the rest of the brothers. Insofar as we are concerned, our viewpoint is special and 4ifferent. We have four or five camps in the south and the question is: Can the army, with its present capabilities, secure the necessary protection for these 18 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 camps against any brutal raids hy the Zionist enemy? Of course not. In any case, this is not required on the army because we may not ask the - Lebanese army'to do what the Egyptian or Jordanian army, or even the Syrian and Iraqi armies, cannot do. Lebanon's issue is well-known. It is also well-known that Lebanon needs a political solution and needs detente. I will tell you here that regardless of the National Movement's viewpoint, we support any flexibility that leads to saving the south, to keeping any form of occupation away from it and to sparing it the repeated blows that cause the people there to suffer. I again assure you that we support any step benef icial to the south. [Question] Last week Fatah issued a statement saying that it does not agree to have the south saved at the expense of the revolution. What is your opinion? [Answer] It is not exactly so. In any case, I have already told you that I do not agree to r~ave Lebanon slaughtered for my sake and that, likewise, I do not agree to be slaughtered for the sake of Lebanan. This is the equation. Let Them Take Tyre Barracks [Question] Fiow can we harmonize this equation with the loss of the south [sic]? [Answer] Do not fear, the south will not be lost. All this is nonsense. But if you mean that the problem is that of the army's entry, then you are wrong because we are not against the army's entry. Moreover, we are committed to the utmost degree not to embroil the south in any new problems. The issue is bigger than this. I have declared repeatedly that we ~ave stopped - our operations from the south. We haz~e also undertaken not to announce military statements from Lebanon. We are also co~itted not t~ shell and strike [from the south]. We have not and will not say no to the army's entry to al-Biqa', the south, the north or any other area. The Tyre barracks is there. Let them come and take it, and you may quote me. This is an undisputable issue. But the question remains: Are all these actions meant to save the south or to impose policies and solutions that we reject? [Question] Will the Palestinian revolution agree to freeze its military activity, or to reduce it at least, in the present phase? [Answer] What I would like to say, and say it publicly, is that our operations from the south have been suspended and will continue to be suspended. As to the question of reducing the military presence in the camps, this issue is connected with the right to self-defense until bette~~ circumstances are made - available to us. 19 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 [Question] Brother Abu-Iyad you talk about protecting the camps and you - yourselves are the ones who have bzought the bear to the vineyard. [Answer] How is that? [Question] The Cairo agreement cancelled [asqatat] the truce agreement con- cluded with Israel and provided the opportunity for the latter to carry out _ military acts and acts of aggression against the south, aimed at the camps and other parts. This means, in other words, that you gave the Zionist enemy the opportunity to enter the Lebanese territories at any hour and any time. What is your opinion? ~ [Answer] Let us put the picture in a different frame and ask: Do you want - us to prevent our people in the occupied territories from carrying out military acts against Israel so that they maq spare Lebanon? The Cairo agreement permits us to open fire from the Leban~ese territories. Yet, we do no t do this so as not to expose Lebanon or its southern part to any danger. The issue, brother, is not of agreements. The issue is one of aggressive intentions harbored by Israel for Lebanon. This makes us ask: Why don't they strike our camps in Jordan which are 10 times more than the camps in Lebanon? Why don't they strike our camps in Syria? Why? Why do they strike the south alone? _ [Question] You have put us in a whirlwind of questions. What is the answer? [Answer] This is a political issue. They conceal their aggressive intentions toward Lebanon behind the screen of striking the Palestinian camps existing _ in it. Their ambitions in tt?e south are historical. Moreover, by striking the south, they sow discord and conflict among the sons of the same line. The custom was for them to retaliate for any operation we carried out with a similar and more violent operation, but lasting one day only. But this time, they have been striking for 7 successive months with the aim of creating _ a rebellion against the revolution and with the aim of sowing discord and conflict between the southern citizen and the Palestinian people living in the south, especially since the Arabs have offered and southern citizen nothing. Imagine a person who;:e children are killed, his house destroyed and his blood shed and who does not: f ind a drop of oil to compensate him for his loss. In my opinion, all this is a part of a plot aimed ultimately at involving Lebanon in the Camp David negotiations. 20 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007102/48: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200044426-7 . I say that Camp David is against Lebanon. But which Lebanon? The Lebanon of the Lebanese Front. ; [Quest3onJ Do you mean to say because of the resettlement plan? [Answer] Yes. Resettlement is dne of the provisions of the Camp David accord. To~~e specific, it is one of the provisions of the accord's supplement cbncerning self-rule which stipulates that no Palestinian shall return to Palestine beyond the Palestinians already there. This means that I will continue to sit on your chest, Lebanon, until Israel permits 10 or 20 persons from Lebanon and 10 or 20 more from Syria to return - to the West Bank. Self-rule means that 400,000 Palestinians will remain in Lebanon and 300,000 _ Palestinians will remain in Syria [and will become] Syrian citizens and Lebanese citizens and so forth in the rest of the Arab countries. This is why all the resettlement enemies are our friends and why they should fight and self-rule plan and the Camp David accords in particular because - they are against their interest as they are against ours. Why Heavy Weapons? - [Question] As long as you are not using the south as a base for launching your operations against Israel, what is the reason that makes you keep the - heavy weapons th~t you have in the camps present there? [Answer] Simply, the justification is that any occupation of or strike against a~1d seizure of the positions of the U.N. forces will mean ending thP revolution or dealing it a back-breaking blow. What I want to say is that the alternative for def ending the camps has not been secured yeC and, therefore, I am f orced to carry the weapons in antici- pation of any Israeli raid. As you know, the aim of the Israeli attacks is to involve us in a new Camp David. You remember that a U.S. plan was once made public in the form of an announcement [i'lan], later denied, talking about a Lebanese-Palestinian-Jordanian-Syrian meeting, in addition to direct Israeli dialogue with the PLO. This plan was folded and then re-announced. [QuestionJ Wasn't this plan projected durirg the two-year war? ~[Answer] Yes. But it was then projected another time, calling for pressure to be exerted on the PLO to enter the Camp David equation (to discuss the self-rule issue). 21 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 13el.ieve me, upon my lio?ior, that self-rule mean:{ resettlement und mcunN the ~ continued presence of the Palestinians in Lebanon in spite of the Lebanese. It also means that, according to this plan, our people in Lebanon will become Lebanese, in Syria will become Syrians, in Jordan will become Jor- danians and so forth. This means that they will divide us among the -~rious Arab countries to take up their citizenship and merge in their societies. From this you can understand why we insist on the creation of a Palestinian state over any inch of the Palestinian soil. From this also you can also understand why we insist on the support and friendship of all the Lebanese. Look at Amin al-Jumayyil. I have heard his speech in the United States in which he spoke about the Palestinian people and about their right to self- determination. These are words over which the heart rejoices and which should be spoken by every Lebanese because through them comes the only solution to the issue. I want to ask you: When I have a homeland and a flag, what would I need a forged passport for, as I said this in comment on the case of Muhammad al-Yusuf who was arrested in Europe because of his forged passport? _ What can I do when there is nobody to take care of my affairs? I am, there- ' fore, compelled to produce forged passports. Here is where it can be under- stood why we insist on the Palestinian state. What is the meaning of this - state, even on a part of the Palestinian soil? It means that I will be able to feel my humanity and it means that there will be no justification for carrying the weapons in Lebanon or anywhere else because then the Palestinian will, naturally, go to his homeland to live in it. Whoever wants ~o stay where he is, his status becomes the same as that of all the Arab citizens in the Arab countries, no more and no less. Somebody may ask: Will this state be big enough for all the Palestinian people? My answer is: How many Lebanese are living in Lebanon and how ; many Lebanese are expatriates? [Question] Those living in Lebanon are 3 million and the expatriates and 9 , million. (Answer] Excellent. It is enough for these 9 million that their passports ~ are not forged and it is enough for them that they feel that they belong to a homeland. Physical residence is not important. What is important is the spiritual residence, i.e. the symbol. Yes, the symbol of belonging is the only impor- _ tant thing. Without this, there is no solution, in my opinion. [Question] Any reasonable man observing the Arab wars against Israel realizes that the Arab states Tiave failed several times to regain the occupied territories by way of the regular armies. On the other hand, the Lebanese 22 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/48: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 citizen finds that instead of resorting to underground fedayeen action, the Palestinian organizations resort to creating regular armies in the manner whose failure has been proven. Can this phenomenon, and all the camouflaged fatigues and~heavy weapons accompanying it in the camps, be explained. [Answer] I want to answer you with the same frankness. A man speaking about an incident without speaking about the circumstances involved is like a man seeing with one eye. Therefore, let us look at both sides. When we speak about the heavy weapot;.s we must also look at the Israeli artillery in Sa'd Hadciad's arsenal--an urtillery that shells the villages which believe, practically, that they are shelled because of my presence there. If these _ villages don't feel that I have the same gun that Sa'd Haddad has, they feel that I have abandoned them. This is the reason for the presence of some heavy weapons in the hands of the resistance. When the causes disappear, there will no longer be any call for _ their presence and we will give them up with atter simplicity. On the other hand, there are Israeli aircraft that fly boisterously over our heads day and night at a time when the Lebanese government does not have any deterrent means. You may tell me that the resistance cannot shoot down the Israeli aircraft that fly at high altitudes (F-16 aircraft). The reply is that I can at least keep them away from the camps and not give them the opportunity to fly at low altitudes and mow down our children and our youths with their machineguns directly. To be very frank also, we were forced to use the heavy weapons during the two-year war when the western area and Tall al-Za'tar were being hit. But today, I defy ar?ybody to prove the presence of a single heavy weapon in the [wesEern] area, unless you consider the DSHK or the Klashnikof a heavy weapon. Armed Manifestations [Question] What about the armed manifestations? [Answer] Insofar as the armed manifestations are concerned, we support any _ measure that has been adopted or that will be adopted in the future. I tell you sincerely that we will be the first to eliminate the armed manifestations, even if this leads to a military clash among us. . But don't ask me to be more royalist than the king and to give up my weapon at a time when I find tens of rifles directed at my chest, beginning with Sa'd Haddad and endi~ig with the last man like him. 23 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/48: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 Ob~ections Against Sa'd Haddad [Question] What are your objections to Sa'd Haddad and why did you make ~ him your enemy even before he had dealt with Israel? [Answer] I want to ask in my turn: Why did Sa'd Haddad consider us enemies and why did he fight us? [Question] Sa'd Haddad has told one of the information media that he fought against Israel when he was in the s~rvice of the legitimate government and that, therefore, he was one of the strongest supporters of the Palestin~.an resistance. But he suddenl}~ found himself surrounded by the joint forces that blocked all the paths to safety in his face and the face of his group whereas Israel opened its gates and saved them from certain death. We under- stand from this that you, and not him, initiated the hostility. What is your opinion? [Answer] If you want to simplify things in this manner, I have no objection ' to the simplification. But the fact is that the matter is not this simple. Here I will again repeat what I have already said, namely that it is difficult to separate things from each other. Therefore, Sa'd Haddad's problem is part of a whole and is not a self-contained problem existing in isolation of what is happening and what surrounds it on the Lebanese stage. j The issue of hostility of Sa'd Haddad is not one of personal hostility ~ between us and him. He is one of the symbols of a group operating on the instructions of a certain command. Frankly, we are not the ones who asked for the Syrian forces. Those who asked for them are Lebanese ex-President Sulayman Franjiyah, with the welcome ! _ of the leaderships of the Phalanges and Liberal parties leaderships and of Sa'd Haddad in particular. We were fighting against the Syrian forces, and everybody knows this. Now that the equation has changed, we are not to be blamed. They must recon- sider their calculations carefully and must determine their goals more precisely in the future. I [Question] But the problem of al-Qulay'ah and Marj'uyun started before the entry of the Syrians. Isn~t it so? [Answer] No. Let me refrestn your memory better because I have experienced the events on the inside and I know them more than you do. _ During the two-year war, we had no problem whatsoever in the south. On the contrary, whoever wanted to rest went to the south. 24 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/48: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 But when the war subsided in Beirut, the southern front was opened (the Deterrence Forces did not enter this area). Imagine the plan--and I say the plan even though I am not one of those who alw~y!s talk of plans and who level accusations offhandedly at the American intelligence and agents [sic]. But unfortunately, every plan blossoms and grows when it finds a fertile land for its roots to get hold and a climate suitable for its growth. Ex-President Fran~iyah once asked me: Abu-Iyad, I want to know how Tyre port can receive weapons designated for the Palestinians at a time when Israel can blow up and destroy the port any time it wants and yet it doesn't - do it, why? I told him at the time: This is true and Israel is aware of every piece of weaponry we receive. Israel doesn't touch the weapons and lets them reach us for a simple reason, namely because its interest calls for continuation of the war in Lebanon. If the weapons don't reach me, the war will not continue because the Lebanese Front will then become stronger than me. Israel has no interest in having the front becoming stronger than the Palestinians or in us becoming stronger than the front because it wants the stage to remain aflame and wants all to continue fighting. The Christians think that Israel likes them. This is wrong. It doesn't like us or them. The proof that it doesn't like them is: Why didn't Israel hit the ships loaded with weapons that were coming to us in Tyre port? The truth is that it didn't do so, not when we were f ighting the Syrians and not when we were fighting our brothers the Christians, and not even when we were fighting each other. It didn't do so because its interest, and that of ~he United States behind it, is in continued fighting and in the constant attrition of our resources in secondary conflicts. It is - regrettable that we, as Arabs, are a willitig instrument in Israel's hand most of the time and that we implement these plans like sheep, not knowing or being aware of what we are doing. As for the statement of Sa'd Haddad that you have mentioned in the question saying that he supported us and that he fought with us against Israel, I cannot deny this and it may be true. But are we the enemies of Sa'd Haddad personally? No, we are not his personal enemies. [Question] Can the Lebanese issue be solved with violence? [Answer] This is not at all possible. Review Lebanon's long history. Lebanon is tantamount to an equation. When the Marunites and the Islamic sects _ agreed to coexist wi~.hin the fY�amework of a single state, there was a well- known agreement and :i covenant calling for loyalty to Lebanon alone. \"No east and no west,\" tliis is the gist of the equation and any flaw developing in this equation destroys it. 25 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 When Camille Sham'un, Pierre al-Juu~ayyil and other leaders bring themselves to task and when we and those in the National Movement and the National Front who support us bring ourselves to task and engage in self-criticism, then the solution wi11 get closer because we will then learn where we have co~itted our mistakes and our follies and everything will end peacefully. Violence is no use at all and it has never been the way to solve any problem. I will give you as an example of this the two-year war: Neither could they advance to al-Shiyah nor could we reach 'Ayn al-Rummanah. We stayed where we had been and we got killed for nothing. Authorizing al-Jumayyil � [Question] Brother Abu-Iyad, why is what is valid locally not valid at the level of the Middle East? In other words, why do you think that the violence ' that cannot achieve a thing in Lebanon can achieve everything outside it? ~ Can peace realize what war cannot realize or not? i i i [Answer] You say peace, but what peace? Would you agree that, as a result of self-rule, 400,000 Palestinians stay in your country and be resettled in it forever? I [Question] Of course not. ~ [Answer] If you agree, then I authorize you in the name of the Palestinian people to negotiation on my behalf on the issue of self-rule. Consequently, ; I authorize brother Pierre al-Jumayyil to negotiation on my behalf. Let him ask Israel and ask the Americans what self-rule is. If they don't tell him that self-rule means resettlement, don't call me Abu-Iyad. ; Now I want to ask you, as a Lebanese, with the logic of the Lebanese Front: , Would you accept any alien on your land? ~ [QuestionJ No. [Answer] Definitely not. You cannot agree to have a single inch of your land occupied by a Palestinian, a Syrian or somebody else. True or not? ' [Question] True. [AnswerJ I consider all of Palestine my land. Yet, I will accept a Palestinian state on only 22 percent of the Palestinian land. On this basis, what do you think? Am I supporting peace or war? [Question] Peace, of course. 26 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 . [Answer] Alright, don't you know that there are xejectionist fronts and acceptance fronts? And the moderation characterizing the PLO at the inter- nati:onal level and Abi~-'Ammar~s viait to Kreisky, Austria and Turkey, ie all this remofe from the logic of our political moderation? [Question] No. Resettlement Plan [Answer] But there is something called the United States and a Zionist lobby controlling if. This is why al-Sadat's treason came as a violent shock to _ us. This is because ~e had gone along with al-Sadat to the degree of blind- ness. He was our personal friend and we supported him completely.. He said to us: Geneva. We did not oppose. He said: Negotiations. We also did not oppose. But we expected this to be within the framework of a compre- hensive Arab solution. Had al-Sadat delayed a little, Israel would have capitulated to a Palestinian state in spite of itself. A1-Sadat's real treason was in his acceptance of the logic of self-rule. I am ready to show you the Egyptian passports he has prepared for a 100,000 Palestinians living in his country. The resettlement began at his end. A1-Sadat accepted the plan that Begin had brought from Poland. The Jews \"got a beating\" on the hands of the Germans in World War II and some of them took refuge in Poland. There, the Polish Government gave them a self-rule affecting people but not the land. Be~in \"is now trying to apply to us in Palestine\" this self-rule which he had gotten in Poland. Palestine is land [sic]. What I mean is that in the 2000-year history about - which they talk, the Jews lived on this land for 70 years only. I am saying these things because they always say that Palestine is the promised land and the land of \"I don't know what.\" I am keeping silent on all this history and I say that I accept a 5tate on a part of the Palestinian soil. Why don't they give me this opportunity? ~y? [Question] Wouldn't the opportunity be made available to you through direct dialogue? [Answer] What dialogue? Can any man in the world offer his enemy more than al-Sadat, the head of the biggest Arab country, has offered? Af ter long negotiations, he surrendered to them himself, Egypt and the oil. He will even divert the Nile to al-Naqab [Negev] and yet they have given him - nothing in return, not even that trivial self-rule about which they are talking. 27 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 [Question] Perhaps Isxael has given al-Sadat no concessions at the Palestinian level but has given him his right at the Egyptian level to demonstrate to the othera that direct negotiations and recognition of Israel are the basis of every concession. Now, the question is: Are you ready to negotiate with - Israel if there are no preconditions? [Answer] It is proven historically that any revolution in the world and any state that negotiates from a position other than one of strength will slip into endless concessions. _ A1-Sadat fought and then stopped the fighting. He then started to make concessions one after the other and to the degree where he has now reached the point of inability. They are now looking for a substitute for al-Sadat because he is terribly weak at the domestic level. Do not ask me for things in advance like all those who contacted us for mediation, saying: \"Stop the operations, even if only for a certain period of time.\" Israel's logic is not to recognize the PLO and not to allow the creation of a Palestinian state and not and not and endless nots. All this is insigni- ficant when we are strong because strength overcomes all difficulties and unities all knots. Fedayeen Operations [Question] Do we understand from your words that the coming days will witness , an escalation in the fedayeen operations against Israel, perhaps to make up for the time squandered by the revolutidn in its fight against the Lebanese in the two-year war? _ [Answer] The operations inside [the occupied territories] continue and they are all from inside. This means that the people are escalating the operations without orders. ~y the way, I would like to take this opportunity to say that the worst part of the two-year war is that it diverted our attention from fighting the Zionist enemy. Establishment of Palestinian State [Question] What is the obstacle preventing so far the declaration of a - Palestinian government in exile? [Answer] Sir, if the Palestinian government were the solution, we would declare it. There is nothing easier than to declare a government and to issue the decision forming it. But the PLO has powers beyond those of any government that can be formed or may be formed in the future. In any case, I want to remind you here of the Government of All Palestine which started in a building and ended in a kitchen. 28 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 We will, however, declare this government one day. We will declare it in the Palestinian state. This state is coming shortly and I see it as clearly as I see you and the brother in front of ine. Believe me and quote me as saying: The Palestinian state will be realized in a shorter time than most observers expect. The contacts being made at the European and international levels and the recent visit of Abu-al-Lutf to Belgium are in isolation from any political issue. I do not want to divulge a ~ecret here but what I want to say is that all the contacts taking place bring the close, and very close, zero hour closer. In any case, there is a world public opinion that now acknowledges the Palestinian people's right. Even the Americans themselves have never paid as much attention to the issue as they are paying now. Therefore, what concerns us is to keep Lebanon calm so that we may be able to move. When I hear Amin al-3umayyil speak abraad about the Palestinian issue I consider him a lot better than Shaykh \"Ahmad ibn Husayn\" when the latter speaks on the same issue. Amin's words are better and stronger. This is what I want to say. Amin and others constitute a support for us. So why should I fight him? I am not sectarian and I do not like to kill by the identity card [which in - Lebanon includes the religion of bearer]. Why should I be counted as a figure with the National Movement and why should I be counted as a figure with the Muslims in this country. I do not like to be counted with anybody. But there are sides that push me forcefully to be a figure and I don't want this. [Question] In your capacity as the engineer of the relations between the state on the one hand and the National Front, National Movement and the resistance on the other and tlirough your experience with all these sides, have you not developed a certain visualization for a plan to solve the Lebdnese issue? (Answer] The solution will become available when we, as Palestinians and as Lebanese, sever our threads, be they Arab or international, with the outside circles. When we cut off these threads, beginning with those with Israel and ending with those with the Arab Maghreb and Arab East, we will reach an understanding immediately. [QuestionJ The other side is ready. Are you ready for this step? [Answer] If the other side is actually ready to hold a dialogue with the National Movement and the National Front, then it is natural that I am ready because whoever wants to hold a political dialogue, he has to hold it with all the parties concerned and not with just one side. Anything else is futile. 29 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-44850R000200044426-7 [Question] There is fear in the wake of the ~Arafat-Sarkis meeting that you will cause President Sarkis to be lost in the Lebanese conflicts, as you did with ex-President Fran~iyah. What is your opinion? [Answer~ I respect and appreciate President Sarkis. He is the symbol of the unity of this country and his stay in power means continuation of the symbol and of the national unity. So don't talk to me about loss and getting lost, may God keep you. [Question] Which is the side fit to hold a dialogue with the Lebanese Front? [Answer] As you know, the Lebanese Front is no longer one front, the same way that the National Movement is no longer one movement. It is the same here and there and I think the~i know each other well. [Question] Was the Sarkis-'Arafat meeting an offhanded meeting that it produced no practical resolutions, or what? [Answer] The meeting was not a question of improvisation or not. When the president assumed office, he could not solve all the conflicts in a matter of days or weeks. All he had to do was to stand fast in the face of all obstacles. In fact, matters hav~ proceeded from good to better. Moreover, the aim of the 'Arafat-Sarkis meeting was not to find a magic wand to solve the crisis in a matter of hours. The issue discussed was the isaue of the south. Within the limits of what was discussed concerning the south, there was agreement. There are numerous parties performing on this stage. It is true that I am frank, but not to the limit of revealing all that is in my heart. [Question] You will go to Syria with the National Movement and the National Front. The question is: Will you (the resistance) present a solution glan out of your desire to pacify the atmosphere? [Answer] The meeting will not solve the crisis, nor will other meetings. Numerous meetings were held in the past with the Syrian brothers and with : others and I cannot divulge to you the content or the nature of those i meetings. But from my meetings with President Sarkis, and others, we have found that we cannot tell the Syrians: We tiave agreed on such and such, so kindly accept what we have agreed upon. It is exactly as the opposite is not permissible. I say that we must reach agreement with all the parties concerned in one thrust. Believe me when I say that if every side severs its outside tie, be it Arab or international, the cxisis will be solved within seconds. 30 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02108: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 Contacts With Israel [Question] IC was rumored last suurmer that contacts took place between the resistance and some Israelis abroad. How true are these rumors? [Answer] A decision taken by the Palestinian [NationalJ Council calls for - holding contacts with aIl the democratic, progressive and national forces inside and outside Israel. This decision gives us the opportunity to contact any non-Zionist Jew and this is what actually happened. [Question] How do you interpret the moderate stances taken by Moshe Dayan recently and do you think that they are a form of trickery and cunning? [Answer] No, I don't think they are a form of trickery. In any case, I have just told you that history has become with us. Israel cannot continue to play the game of the poor and persecuted p arty forever. The world has come to acknowledge now something called Palestine and the Palestinian people. [Question] It is repeatedly said that the resistance and the Lebanese Front may f ind themselves in one trench. How do you explain this? [Answer] I wish, and I say this sincerely and with all my heart and not just as a courtesy or a nicety, that all the Lebanese, led by the L~banese Front, would be with us in the trench. [Question] Are there contacts between you and the Lebanese Front? - [Answer] The contacts are suspended at present because of Amin al-Jumayyil's travels. [Question] Through the resolutions and the pro~ections made by the Lebanese Front, where do you meet and where do you part company? [Answer] I have no objection to the Lebanese Front or to others except on the basis of the position this or that side takes toward me and my cause. - They too should establish their objections to me on the basis of what positions I take taward Lebanon. This is unless what is meant [by the question] is a separate understanding between the front and the Palestinian resistance and desertion of all the other parties concerned. If so, then the issue is a losing one. I wish that the rest of the brothers would give me the right and honor to negotiate in their name. I also wish that there would emerge from the Lebanese Front reasonable people who understand our circumstances as Amin al-Jumayyil understands them. Forgive me, I do not want to dwell on this subject so as not to hurt anybody unwittingly. 31 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007102/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 [Question] Bashir [al-Jumayyil] also understands your circumstances but what he holds against you is your intervention in the Lebanese politics. [Answer] (Laughingly) My friend, Shaykh Bash~r is attacking us relentlessly, why? Meeting of Frank Discussion [Question] What is required, as you have said, is to reach understanding. Isn't it so? [Answer] Yes, let all our affairs be presented openly and let us tell each other what are the things that scare us and the things that scare them. There must be a meeting of open discussion between us to eliminate the fear - from the hearts. We will then settle our differences and find the solution suitable for all of us. [Question] The Lebanese Front's position is very clear and is su~ed up in I that the weapons present in the hands of the foreigners who support the ~oint ! forces upset the Lebanese equation of balances. [Answer] This is a faulty starting point and an inaccurate view of things. ! Delving into the sea of details will do us no good. What is required now is for every side to acknowledge the presence of the other side. What Lebanon has suffered so far is enough. This is why we should all ced~ our rights ~ for the sake of Lebanon that has suffered enough woes and catastrophes. We in the organizations have our numerous differences but we give them up for the sake of the cause. Duty calls on all the Lebanese to give up in their turn ever;~thing for the sake of Lebanon. The \"failure to cede\" led to the war and perhaps ceding now will lead to ending the war. _ [Question] Brother Abu-Iyad, Bashir al-Jumayyil concentrated in the speeches that he has made recently on attacking the United States, considering it the - party that has embroiled Lebanon and dragged it to its present situation. Don't you think that this is a meeting point between you and him? , [Answer] There is a~oke that I always tell the brothers. This joke is that when I read Shaykh Bashir's speeches I feel that I have mistaken the title and replaced his name by that of brother Muhsin Ibrahim. [Question] You haven't answered my question yet. [Answer] He is fighting the United States and we are with him in the battle. [Question] What is required at the level of restoring the relations with the front? 32 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007102/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 [Answer] The same way I appreciate their feelings as Lebanese, they should appreciate my feelings as a Palestinian. This means that the harmful word at times closes many paths whereas the nice word opens many hearts. I read AL-'AMAL and AL-AHRAR constantly and I see those long and broad editorials in their front pages every day. This is a disgrace. Believe me that I try hard in the speeches I make on all occasions to avoid words such as \"isolationism, fascism, reaction\" and others becauae I don't like to pour oil on fire and because, upon my honor, I want this country to have _ rest from gossip, hatred and malice and want a new page bright with hope and love to be opened. Believe me, I am only a passerby in this country. I and my people have a little time left for us to depart to the motherland. - I mean by this that all the Lebanese should forget their differences because this country is theirs and they have no other country. It is a pity on their part to waste it with frivolous and meaningless diff erences. Let _ them stop this propaganda war among themselves because it is more dangerous than the rifle and the gun with its power of destruction. [Question] The people are afraid of coming battles. What is your opinion? _ [Answer] After the Camp David accord, I was afraid of a battle. Last April, I was afraid that matters would return to what they had been during the two- year war. But it seems that the south was the alternative victim and the south - has gotten its share throughout 7 successive months. I believe that nobody has any interest in any future battle. [Question] Should a future battle, God forbid, take place, will you be a party in it? [Answer] Not at all because we have no interest in fighting any side and we will not again waste our time on a picnic over Lebanon's quicksands. I call on all with all my heart to clear matters peacefully and to settle their differences. I also call on them to always raise the slogan of abandoning all that is external, be it Arab or foreign, and to return to their previous equation because there is no alternative to it. 8494 CSO: 4802 33 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007102/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040026-7 ISLAMIC AFFAIRS IMPLICATIONS OF POPE'S U.S. VISIT TO ISLAMIC, ARAB WORLD EXAMINED Kishk's Article on Visit London AL-HAWADITH in Arabic 26 Oct 79 pp 36-38, 43-44 [Article by Jalal Kishk: \"Fanatic Viewpoint on Visit of Pope John Paul II to United States; Has Confrontation Between Christian West and Muslim East Started; Intensifying Conviction in West on Need to Use Force Against Third World to Solve Crisis of Advanced World; Rosalyn Carter Tells Pope: You Have Come to Us as Example of Vision That Unites Mankind--Vision of Our Creator; World Is Eager for Spiritual Leadership and Pope's Approach Gives Him Great Opportunity to Succeed in Role of Savior of Christian World; Most Serious Occurrence in Pope's Visit to United States Is His Announce- ment of 'Termination of Missionary Work Among Jews;' What About Missionary Work Among Muslims; Middle East Got Longest Paragraph in Pope's Speech Before U.N.
