        "text": "In a full day of action, the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) approved 12 draft resolutions today, with topics ranging from the Human Rights Council, persons with disabilities in conflict, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and human rights and digital technologies.\n\nIn the morning, the Committee approved the resolution “The Report of the Human Rights Council” (document A/C.3/78/L.64) by a vote of 109 in favour, 4 against (Belarus, Nicaragua, Israel and the Russian Federation), with 63 abstentions. By the text, the General Assembly would take note of the “Report of the Human Rights Council”, including its addendum and recommendations.\n\nIntroducing the draft, the representative of Zambia, speaking on behalf of the African Group, underscored its importance, as the General Assembly is responsible for guiding the overall work of the United Nations, including reviewing mandates established by the Human Rights Council and ensuring they are consistent with international law.\n\nOpposing the draft, Sudan’s delegate said her country’s army is preserving the stability of the State and safety of its civilians. Sudan rejects the inclusion of human rights violations her country allegedly committed in the report, withdraws its sponsorship of the draft and will abstain from the vote, she said.\n\nSpain’s delegate, speaking on behalf of the European Union, said there is no need to approve the report in the Third Committee, adding that the bloc would therefore abstain from the vote.\n\nThe representative of Nicaragua said she rejected the instrumentalization of human rights, including the creation of a group of human rights experts on her country and would vote against the draft. Israel’s delegate said that, until the Human Rights Council changes its biased approach toward Israel, her delegation would vote against the resolution.\n\nCuba’s delegate highlighted the double standard in addressing human rights violations in rich countries, rejecting Human Rights Council resolutions against Nicaragua, Belarus, Burundi, Eritrea, Iran, the Russian Federation, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Syria and South Sudan.\n\nThe Committee also approved the draft resolution “Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto: situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies” by consensus (document A/C.3/78/L.53/Rev.1). By its terms, the General Assembly would emphasize that accessibility is a precondition for persons with disabilities to live independently and participate in all aspects of life. It would urge States to enable their meaningful participation and representation in humanitarian action, conflict prevention, resolution, reconciliation, reconstruction and peacebuilding.\n\nAddressing that draft, the representative of Canada, also speaking on behalf of Australia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, said this year’s focus on the protection of persons with disabilities in humanitarian settings is “incredibly warranted” and welcomed the approval.\n\nMeanwhile, the representative of Indonesia voiced appreciation for the resolution’s focus on humanitarian contexts. Spotlighting the ongoing crisis in Gaza with more than 11,000 casualties, he stressed that “no double standard shall be allowed” and that the rights of persons with disabilities in Gaza are equal to the rights of those elsewhere. He further emphasized that States must avoid causing disabilities through humanitarian crises.\n\nAnother draft approved by the Committee is titled “Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees” (document A/C.3/78/L.59), which would have the General Assembly express deep concern over the increase of people who are forcibly displaced and urge all States to mobilize resources to host countries and communities, countries of origin and refugee populations.\n\nWelcoming approval of that draft, the representative of Canada said that UNHCR’s work is more important than ever, given catastrophic levels of current displacement.\n\nAddressing those levels, the representative of Iran said her country’s humanitarian situation is strained by the influx of Afghan refugees. Calling for a permanent solution, she voiced criticism that the draft paid greater attention to protection rather than durable solutions and burden-sharing, which are gravely needed for host countries.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Committee approved a new draft resolution by consensus titled “Promotion and protection of human rights in the context of digital technologies” (document A/C.3/78/L.49/Rev.1). By the text, the General Assembly would call on all Member States to consider developing and implementing adequate legislation that protects individuals against human rights violations in the digital context. It would also call on the private sector and all relevant stakeholders to provide effective remedy for rights abuses they may cause or contribute to.\n\nThe delegates of Denmark and the United Kingdom expressed concerns that language in the draft ensuring freedom of expression is weak, with the latter stressing that countering disinformation should not be a pretext for restrictions on freedom of expression or other rights.\n\nMeanwhile, Singapore’s delegate voiced disappointment that language related to States’ legitimate prerogatives and responsibilities to counter online harm and ensure a safe digital environment was excluded.\n\nIn further action, the Committee approved resolutions by consensus on: persons living with a rare disease and their families; promoting social integration through social inclusion; the Fourth World Conference on Women and of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly; terrorism and human rights; national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities; freedom of religion or belief; combating incitement to violence based on religion or belief; and the safety of journalists.\n\nAction on Draft Resolutions\n\nTurning first to the remaining explanations of vote on the draft resolution “L.12/Rev.1” (document A/C.3/78/L.12/Rev.1), titled “Improving the coordination of efforts against trafficking in persons”, the representative of Ukraine said her country joined consensus due to the gravity of the issue, especially in the context of the brutal war of the Russian Federation against her country. Belarus’ credibility is undermined by its own hypocritical actions, playing a vital role in the largest migration crisis in Europe since the Second World War. Worse, Russian Federation troops have used Belarus as a staging ground to occupy territories, such as Bucha. Belarus has also enabled attacks on Kyiv and is involved in the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. Belarus must be held accountable, she said.\n\nThe representative of Canada, also speaking on behalf of Australia, New Zealand and Liechtenstein, said that preventing trafficking in persons requires a victim-centred approach to ensure their protection, full access to essential services and the prevention of recurrence. Multi-stakeholder partnerships are essential to achieving this goal, she said, which is why the General Assembly must adopt this resolution. While her group has joined consensus, it also condemns Belarus’ involvement in the unjustifiable Russian Federation war of aggression in Ukraine, where those fleeing the country are at particular risk of sexual exploitation and forced labour. Further, it has serious concerns over the deterioration of the human rights situation in Belarus and its instrumentalization of migration.\n\nThe representative of Hungary, aligning with the European Union, said the country is committed to eliminating all forms of human trafficking, and joined consensus. However, Hungary does not endorse the Global Compact for Migration and Global Compact on Refugees, cannot accept references to them in international documents and thus dissociates from preambular paragraph 38. Hungary believes that efforts should focus on combatting organized crime and holding perpetrators to account. Expanding legal channels for migration is not an appropriate way to combat human trafficking, he said, noting that it is a State’s prerogative to determine its national legislation in that regard.\n\nThe representative of Latvia, aligning with the European Union, expressed its commitment to combat trafficking in persons. He condemned Belarus’ hypocrisy in presenting “L.12” while instrumentalizing migrants, amounting to smuggling or trafficking. For two years, the Belarussian regime has orchestrated an influx of migrants into the European Union to exert pressure on the bloc — and Belarus’ activities are only increasing. As international observers have noted, Belarussian authorities have encouraged trafficking. “This calculated strategy must end,” he said.\n\nThe representative of the United Kingdom expressed concern that an estimated 49.6 million people are in modern slavery conditions. Her country works with international partners to ensure that victims and survivors are provided with the support they need. Noting that the resolution could have been improved by recognizing countries’ respective legal systems, she said States are not bound to take steps to recognize regular migration pathways. Despite these concerns, her country recognizes the importance of combating modern slavery and therefore joined consensus.\n\nThe representative of Syria said the need to combat trafficking in persons is something everyone can agree on and the country therefore joined consensus. Countering claims against hypocrisy against Belarus, he questioned Western countries’ commitment to the issue.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation said that trafficking in persons is one of the most dangerous organized crime activities, flagrantly violating human dignity. A holistic understanding of this issue is needed, and root causes, such as a legal sex industry, the demand for cheap and powerless workers and poverty must be addressed. Welcoming Belarus’ efforts and condemning some States’ politicization of this discussion as “score settling”, he said it was unacceptable to blame Minsk for the current migration crisis. Everyone knows that the crisis in the Middle East was caused by forcible interventions by the West over many years in that region, in Africa and its failed “US-NATO” operation in Afghanistan. He called on Western colleagues to stop politicizing the work of the Third Committee.\n\nThe representative of Iran said trafficking in persons is a notorious crime, noting that her country has taken necessary steps to combat the scourge in line with international instruments. Further, a draft bill in 2004 addressing the issue was submitted to Parliament. Trafficking in persons cannot be addressed without addressing root causes, however. Dissociating from preambular paragraph 42, she reiterated her country’s position on the Global Compact on Refugees, noting that language referring to treaties in General Assembly resolutions only applies to States that are party to them.\n\nThe representative of Lithuania, aligning with the European Union, expressed profound concern at the number of forcibly displaced persons, noting that Belarus has created a migration crisis since 2021 by promoting an artificial migration route. Moreover, Belarus has accumulated a record of human rights violations and supports Moscow in its war of aggression against Ukraine. The Lithuanian Prosecutor General has launched investigations to evaluate the role of Belarus in the Russian Federation’s child abductions in Ukraine. A failure to cooperate regarding migration, identify human trafficking and take measures to prevent the use of commercial aircrafts for illegal migration suggests efforts to fuel and benefit from this “malign activity” she said. She called on the country to put an end to these practices. Lithuania joined consensus but did not participate in negotiations for these reasons, she said.\n\nThe Committee next turned to the draft titled \"Addressing the challenges of persons living with a rare disease and their families\" (document A/C.3/78/L.9/Rev.1), which the Chair noted contains no programme budget implications.\n\nThe representative of Spain, introducing the draft also on behalf of Brazil, and Qatar, said that scientific advances over the past 50 years have identified 6,000 rare diseases that are different from each other, affecting from 3.5 to 5.9 per cent of the world's population. “The small number of cases of each rare disease makes it difficult for health-care systems to develop local expertise and for patients to reach a timely and accurate diagnosis,” she stressed, adding that health inequalities faced by persons living with rare diseases are amplified in countries with small populations and developing countries. The creation of networks of experts, clinics, specialized centres and patient organizations is a necessary step to strengthen health systems for rare diseases and persons living with rare diseases.\n\nShe highlighted the challenges of achieving early and appropriate diagnoses and the importance of screening programmes, including neonatal screening, since almost half of genetic diseases start in childhood. She encouraged Member States to develop sustainable national programmes specifically dedicated to undiagnosed diseases; structure and coordinate, at the national and international levels, knowledge about rare diseases, and information sharing; and promote the participation of persons living with rare diseases and other stakeholders in the governance of undiagnosed disease programmes. She also recalled that persons living with rare diseases deserve to be recognized as equal citizens with full respect for their rights and receive a timely and accurate diagnosis.\n\nSpeaking before the approval of the draft resolution, the delegate for Egypt said that adoption of this resolution is an occasion to reaffirm international commitment to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 3 and promote public health without discrimination.\n\nThe Committee then approved the draft resolution titled, “Addressing the challenges of persons living with a rare disease and their families” (document A/C.3/78/L.9/Rev.1) without a vote.\n\nBy its terms, the Assembly would call on Member States to strengthen health systems to provide universal access to health-care services to persons living with a rare disease, whether genetic or acquired, including those with rare cancers, rare infections and rare allergic reactions, as well as those with an undiagnosed disease. It would also encourage Member States to adopt gender-sensitive national strategies, action plans and legislation, to contribute to the well-being of persons living with a rare disease and their families. By other terms, it would urge Member States to implement national policies to ensure that persons living with a rare disease are not left behind, recognizing that persons living with a rare disease are often disproportionally affected by poverty, discrimination and lack of decent work and employment.\n\nSpeaking after the approval of the draft resolution, the representative of the United States said his country supports the needs and concerns of the community of persons with rare diseases but added that this resolution contains provisions not fully capturing the scope of protection they need. He stressed that the resolution does not maintain an appropriate nexus to existing international human rights conventions and that the edits proposed by his country were not made.\n\nThe delegate for Nigeria underscored the urgent need for global support and funding to eradicate poverty and the lack of access to food, which should not be seen as of equal or less priority than sexual and reproductive health-care services, which receive over $12.2 billion of funding annually. She said that her country therefore dissociates from preambular paragraph 21, which reads: “Reaffirming further the need to achieve gender equality and to empower women and girls, and concerned by the fact that women and girls living with a rare disease face more discrimination and barriers in accessing health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and education, as well as fully, equally and meaningfully participating in public life, and that women and girls undertake a disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work when a member of their household or family lives with a rare disease, and that women face more barriers in accessing decent work.”\n\nNew Zealand’s representative, also speaking on behalf of Australia, Canada, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, said the group would like to see strengthened language in the resolution, particularly as regards recognition of multiple forms of discrimination faced by persons with disabilities, including those with rare diseases.\n\nThe delegate for the Dominican Republic called for the exchange of information and increase of research capacity on the matter, as well as the involvement in decision-making of those living with rare diseases and their organizations.\n\nThe Committee then took up the draft resolution titled “Promoting social integration through social inclusion” (document A/C.3/78/L.14/Rev.1), which the Chair noted contains no programme budget implications.\n\nThe representative of Peru, introducing the draft, reaffirmed that eradicating poverty is the world’s greatest challenge. The text thus focuses on poverty’s multidimensional aspects, going beyond monetary limitations and addressing diverse needs in a cross-cutting way, including food security, health, education, housing and road connectivity. In that regard, he encouraged Member States to generate relevant statistics to measure poverty’s multidimensional nature. This year, the draft also tackles the social inclusion of specific groups, including by addressing impediments to women’s participation in the labour force.\n\nThe Committee then approved by consensus the draft, by which the General Assembly would stress that Member States should prioritize the creation of a “society for all”, based on respect for all human rights and principles of equality among individuals, non-discrimination, access to basic social services and promotion of the active participation of every member of society, in particular those in vulnerable or marginalized groups or situations, in all aspects of life.\n\nBy further terms, the Assembly would call on Member States and relevant stakeholders to advance actions to address the social, economic and health impacts of the COVID‑19 pandemic, while striving to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by designing and implementing age-, disability- and gender-sensitive recovery strategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It would also call on Member States to promote more equitable participation in and access to economic growth gains, through policies that ensure inclusive labour markets and by implementing socially responsive macroeconomic policies, in which employment has a key role.\n\nThe representative of Senegal, said his country joined consensus, but disassociated from non-consensual language in the draft, particularly the reference to “multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination”. He recalled that any gender-related wording deals only with relations between men and women. “We must continue to preserve the culture of diversity,” he said, and should avoid any aspect that might undermine consensus.\n\nThe representative of Indonesia, noting language in the draft that does not enjoy consensus and universal agreement, expressed his country’s reservations about the reference to “multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination”. Nevertheless, he said social inclusion is always at the centre of Indonesia’s priorities and policies, embedded in one of five foundational principles on social justice for the whole of the people. His country will use the resolution to strengthen social integration and inclusion policies at the national and local levels.\n\nThe representative of Malaysia, while joining consensus, noted the text continues to reference “multiple and intersecting forms” of discrimination in preambular paragraph 27. Malaysia’s interpretation of the term will be based on its national laws, values and customs, he said, and does not include any concepts that are inconsistent with the existing international human rights architecture.\n\nThe representative of Iran said her country joined consensus, but disassociated from preambular paragraph 27 and its terminology that is “devoid of clear definitions” and a common understanding among States. While her delegation engaged in negotiations with “great flexibility and constructiveness”, its concerns were not addressed appropriately. She stressed the importance of respecting the human rights of all, irrespective of sex, age, race, religion or ethnicity, including women and those with disabilities, children, youth and older persons.\n\nNext, the Committee turned to the draft resolution titled “Follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women and full implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly” (document A/C.3/78/L.65), which the Chair noted contains programme budget implications in the form of an additional resources requirement.\n\nThe Committee then approved “L.65” by consensus. By the text, the Assembly would urge Member States to increase funding for UN‑Women by providing core, multi-year, predictable and sustainable voluntary contributions. It would also urge Member States and encourage stakeholders to mobilize adequate financial resources for the full and accelerated implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. The Assembly would call on Governments and all other stakeholders to systematically mainstream a gender perspective into implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Furthermore, the Assembly would decide to convene a one-day high-level meeting in the margins of its general debate at its eightieth session to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women.\n\nThe representative of Iraq, expressing reservations, said his country does not support initiatives such as the Generation Equality Forum, which are not officially held under UN auspices. Regarding national legislation, he said women and men are “the only choices” and any other explanation would lead to extreme reservations from his delegation.\n\nThe representative of Mexico said gender equality remains elusive and underscored that the international community can no longer wait to find an equitable world. She stressed the need to strengthen commitments made to young girls and women, namely the Generation Equality Forum.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation said the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action remains the road map for policies to achieve gender equality. He expressed regret that the final draft of this document includes a refence to only one private event — the Gender Equality Forum — while other gender equality initiatives are left out, among them the Eurasian Women’s Forum. He also disassociated from preambular paragraph 19.\n\nThe representative of the United States emphasized that the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action is critical to ensuring progress vis-à-vis gender equality. He welcomed that the revised text recognizes the continuing adverse effects of the pandemic on women and girls. Additionally, he strongly supported the UN system of efforts to address sexual harassment.\n\nThe representative of Canada underlined that women are not a monolithic group and their rights are human rights, whose achievement is critical to ensuring sustainable development, peace and security.\n\nThe representative of the United Kingdom voiced disappointment that the text does not contain any reference to sexual and reproductive rights, adding that women must make their own choices regarding their bodies and their future.\n\nThe representative of Djibouti highlighted the essential role of international cooperation in assisting developing countries in progressing towards full implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. He also stressed that the only acceptable language is that agreed by consensus.\n\nThe representative of Iran said the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action represents an important global effort to promote the status of women. Spotlighting procedural deficiencies, he said they undermine the spirit of consensus-building that prevents States from achieving a more transparent and participatory negotiation process. Her delegation does not support any initiatives that did not take place in the framework of the General Assembly, she said, disassociating from any paragraph that contains such references.\n\nThe representative of Niger pointed to the Generation Equality Forum, whose results are “a flagrant abuse” of the carefully crafted agreements under the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. This resolution does not modify the current state of customary law, he added.\n\nThe representative of Algeria underlined the need to preserve the rights of women and girls and end all types of violence and discrimination against them. He voiced reservations vis-à-vis non-consensual concepts, including the Generation Equality Forum, which is held outside UN auspices. Also, there are two genders only, men and women, she added.\n\nThe Committee then took up the draft resolution titled “Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees” (document A/C.3/78/L.59), which the Chair noted contains no programme budget implications.\n\nIntroducing the draft “L.59” the representative of Denmark, speaking on behalf of the Nordic countries Finland, Norway, Sweden and Iceland, said that the resolution is an annual one supporting the non-political and humanitarian mandate of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Extensive negotiations took place in Geneva before it was presented in New York, where the text was reorganized this year for ease of flow, he said. It is firstly a humanitarian resolution, he added, calling for unity in a time of growing humanitarian needs and record numbers of displaced persons. Calling for adoption by consensus, he said it will send a strong message of support for UNHCR and refugees across the globe.\n\nThe Committee approved the draft by consensus, by which the General Assembly would express deep concern that the number of people who are forcibly displaced owing to, inter alia, conflict, persecution, violence and terrorism, is increasing, and that the adverse effects of climate change, hazards and environmental degradation are increasing in intensity and frequency, contributing to forced displacement and disproportionately affecting persons in vulnerable situations. It would request the Office of the High Commissioner to continue improving its humanitarian assistance response and stressed the importance of tailored approaches.\n\nFurther, the Assembly would strongly condemn attacks on refugees, asylum seekers, stateless persons and internally displaced persons, calling on States or parties involved in an armed conflict to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for human rights and international humanitarian law. It would deplore the growing number of incidents of refoulement and unlawful expulsion of refugees and asylum seekers, as well as practices of denial of access to asylum. The Assembly would also urge all States to mobilize resources as well as direct aid to host countries, countries of origin, refugee populations and communities hosting them, with a view to enhancing their capacity and reducing the heavy burden borne by countries and communities hosting refugees.\n\nThe representative of Canada welcomed the approval, noting that it has been a long-standing partner to UNHCR, hailing its leadership during catastrophic levels of global displacement. Conflict is a primary driver of displacement, she said, adding that food insecurity and climate change are “threat multipliers” and stressing that the forced displacement crisis is extremely complex. In this context, the comparative advantage of the UNHCR rooted in its humanitarian protection mandate becomes more important than ever, she added. Recognizing that middle- and low-income countries host more than 60 per cent of displaced populations around the world, exerting undue economic pressure on host countries, she said the resolution underscores the international community’s commitment to burden sharing and advancing solutions. Expressing strong support for the resolution, she said that, despite significant challenges, UNHCR has displayed impressive commitment to its mandate.\n\nThe representative of Hungary said it has been a long-standing supporter of UNHCR. However, his country once again puts on record its position with regard to the Global Compact on Refugees and the Global Refugee Forum. It dissociates from all paragraphs of the resolution pertaining to the Compact and Forum.\n\nThe representative of Singapore said her country joined consensus, highlighting that the resolution continues to applaud access to asylum without considering States’ individual conditions. As a small country with limited land and high population density, Singapore is not able to accept refugees or asylum seekers regardless of background, she said, adding that States must have the ability to control their borders and migration flows. Singapore joined consensus in the spirit of compromise.\n\nThe representative of Malaysia underscored the importance of the work of the UNHCR, noting that the resolution features the ambiguous phrase “gender and diversity mainstreaming”, which will be interpreted through Malaysia’s own national legislation. He warned against using terms that do not have internationally recognized meaning.\n\nThe representative of Oman, speaking on behalf of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar, said that it joined consensus because of the importance of the subject, but added that paragraphs addressing reproductive rights will be interpreted through national legislations in the group’s respective countries.\n\nThe representative of Iran highlighted that the humanitarian situation in her country has been aggravated by Afghani displaced persons. Iran has offered them basic services on a similar footing with Iranian citizens, she said, calling for a permanent solution to this situation based on burden sharing. Further, the United States’ unilateral coercive measures undermine her country’s hosting capacity. Moreover, Iran understands that divisions between sections and subsections made during negotiations of the draft are not intended to be used in future negotiations. Further, the number of paragraphs addressing protections are far greater than those addressing durable solutions, burden sharing and mobilization of resources, which are gravely needed for host countries, she said.\n\nThe observer for the Holy See said that this year’s text highlights the global food crisis, reinforcing the urgent need for urgent and immediate action in countries where people are at high risk for famine and acute malnutrition. Calling for greater support to host countries, he noted that “sexual and reproductive health” and “sexual and reproductive health-care services” are interpreted by the Holy See as a holistic approach to health and do not include abortion or abortive agents. Further, the term gender is understood as grounded in biological sexual identity — male or female.\n\nNext, the Committee turned to the draft resolution titled “Report of the Human Rights Council” (document A/C.3/78/L.64), which the Chair noted contains no programme budget implications.\n\nA recorded vote was requested on the draft resolution.\n\nIntroducing the resolution on behalf of the African Group, the representative of Zambia said the resolution is of a technical nature and takes note of the contents of the report. “The group further highlights the significance of the Third Committee's consideration of this resolution which takes note of the ‘Report of the Human Rights Council’, considering the Human Rights Council is the subsidiary body of the General Assembly,” he said. He noted that the General Assembly has the responsibility to guide the overall work of the United Nations, including reviewing mandates established by the Human Rights Council to ensure they are consistent with international law, internationally recognized human rights and the purposes for which the UN was founded. He added that his Group reaffirms itscommitment to the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms and to strengthening the United Nations human rights machinery, with the aim of ensuring effective enjoyment of all human rights, including the right to development in an equitable manner, with the same emphasis and on equal footing. He also thanked all Member States that are supportive of this resolution and called for voting in favour of it.\n\nSpeaking before the vote, the delegate for Sudan said her country’s army is upholding its constitutional responsibility to preserve the stability and sovereignty of the State and safety of its civilians. Therefore, it completely rejects what is included in the report as alleged violations in Sudan, withdraws itself from the list of co-sponsors and will abstain from voting.\n\nThe delegate for Spain, speaking on behalf of the European Union, said that there is no need to approve the report as the Third Committee should only take note of it. Her bloc therefore will abstain from voting, she said.\n\nNicaragua’s representative said her country rejects the instrumentalization and manipulation of human rights, including the creation of a Group of Human Rights Experts on Nicaragua, adding that it will vote against the resolution.\n\nThe representative of Liechtenstein, also speaking on behalf of Australia, Canada, Iceland, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland, expressed regret that the resolution undermines the Human Rights Council’s mandate.\n\nIsrael’s delegate said the Human Rights Council has referred to human rights violations and implications of the occupation of Palestine and other Arab territories by her country. Until the Human Rights Council changes its biased and unbalanced approach towards Israel, her country intends to vote “no” on this resolution and encourages all Member States to do the same, she said.\n\nThe representative of Eritrea said that her delegation is concerned with the politicization of human rights. It will vote in favour of the resolution but dissociates from the part of the report on “Human Rights Situation in Eritrea” and from other country-specific resolutions against developing nations, adopted without their consent.\n\nThe Committee then approved the draft resolution in a recorded vote of 109 in favour to 4 against (Belarus, Nicaragua, Israel and the Russian Federation), with 63 abstentions. By the text, the General Assembly would take note of the “Report of the Human Rights Council”, including its addendum and its recommendations.\n\nSpeaking after the vote, the representative of Cuba noted double standards in addressing human rights violations by rich countries. He said his country will vote in favour of the resolution, which should not be seen as an endorsement of the selective processes and politically motivated interests against developing countries. Cuba firmly rejects the mandates of resolutions of the Human Rights Council against Nicaragua, Belarus, Burundi, Eritrea, Iran, the Russian Federation, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Syria, Sudan and South Sudan.\n\nIran’s delegate said her country strongly objects to the politicization of human rights to serve the interests of self-proclaimed human rights advocates and therefore abstained from voting.\n\nThe representative of the United States said his country regards the annual resolution on the Human Rights Council’s report as procedurally unnecessary and strongly objects to the Human Rights Council’s continued disproportionate focus on Israel.\n\nSyria’s delegate said his country abstained for the same reasons as Eritrea, Iran and other delegations. Stressing that the Human Rights Council focuses on a certain Member State and ignores the majority of other States, he said this is the only resolution that Switzerland, Syria and Tajikistan agreed to abstain from voting on.\n\nThe Committee next took up the draft resolution titled “Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto: situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies” (document A/C.3/78/L.53/Rev.1), which the Chair noted contains no programme budget implications.\n\nThe representative of Mexico introduced the draft on behalf of her country and New Zealand as a testament to the commitment to principles enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and to ensuring the rights of all persons with disabilities are respected, protected and fulfilled. Recognizing the disproportionate impact on persons with disabilities in situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies, the draft urges States and relevant stakeholders to ensure such persons are actively involved in the monitoring and evaluation of humanitarian assistance. The text also highlights the importance of disaggregated data as a cornerstone to formulate inclusive policy responses.\n\nThe Committee then approved the draft by consensus, by which the General Assembly would emphasize that accessibility is a precondition for persons with disabilities to live independently and participate in all aspects of life. Expressing concern that the continuing lack of available data and information about persons with disabilities at all levels contributes to their exclusion, the Assembly would stress the relevance of disaggregated data collection and analysis as an important element in the design of inclusive policies, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters.\n\nBy further terms, the Assembly would urge States to eliminate multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination against all women and girls with disabilities through removing any other barriers in accessing, inter alia, the physical, social, economic and cultural environment, transportation, health and education. It would urge Member States to close digital divides and promote the digital inclusion of persons with disabilities to enable their meaningful participation and representation in humanitarian action, conflict prevention, resolution, reconciliation, reconstruction and peacebuilding.\n\nThe representative of Canada, also speaking on behalf of Australia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, said this year’s focus on the protection of persons with disabilities in humanitarian settings is “incredibly warranted”. She welcomed the resolution’s recognition of multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and its tangible impact on all persons with disabilities, including women, girls and Indigenous individuals with disabilities. Also, while welcoming the inclusion of language recognizing the importance of sexual and reproductive health, she regretted that the language was not strengthened even more to further the Convention’s implementation. In closing, she emphasized the importance of an inclusive approach to the Convention’s implementation.\n\nThe representative of Poland, which co-sponsored the draft, hoped that the direct reference to Security Council resolution 2475 (2019) could have been maintained and regretted the clear pushback of some delegations. She informed other delegations that Poland plans to mark the fifth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 2475 (2019) in June 2024, and invited all delegations to work with hers to further promote and protect the human rights of all persons with disabilities.\n\nThe representative of Oman, speaking on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, while joining consensus, emphasized that the Cooperation Council views preambular paragraph 16 and its reference to sexual and reproductive health in line with their societal frameworks, regulations and laws.\n\nThe representative of Iraq expressed reservations about controversial terminology in the draft. He reiterated Iraq’s full right to interpret and implement provisions and obligations in line with national laws and universally recognized human rights. Interpretation of all controversial terms will be left to Iraq’s national legislation, including on sexual and gender-based violence, multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, sexual and reproductive health, intersectionality, diversity, gender and related terms.\n\nThe representative of Niger, while welcoming the draft’s approval by consensus, disassociated from any reference to intersectionality in the text. He expressed disappointment in the approach to closed paragraphs, which guided the negotiation process, and considered it an “unjustified procedural lacuna”. He asked delegations to reevaluate and abandon the approach of closed paragraphs in order to adopt a more participative and transparent approach. On terms such as “sexual and reproductive health and rights”, he reiterated Niger’s statement describing its interpretation of these terms.\n\nThe representative of Malaysia, while joining consensus, noted that his country’s interpretation of “multiple and intersecting forms” of discrimination will be based on its national laws, values and customs and does not endorse including any concepts inconsistent with the existing international human rights architecture.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation, while joining consensus, clarified that operative paragraph 35 does not reflect the principle of legal certainty, as it does not define which specific acts are being mentioned, who adopted them and whether they are obligatory for States. The basis for any adjustments to national, normative and legal acts can only be documents with obligations that States have clearly agreed to through ratification, adoption or another method. Her country does not consider itself bound by documents drafted behind the scenes without intergovernmental agreement, such as within the Inter‑Agency Standing Committee. On the text’s reference to sexual and reproductive health, she noted that the rights and needs of persons with disabilities should be considered in the general health-care context without extraneous details. The use of “diversity of persons” in several paragraphs is appropriate not in terms of persons with disabilities themselves, but rather only in terms of situations in which such persons might be found.\n\nThe representative of the United States expressed disappointment that a very small number of delegations blocked direct references to Security Council resolution 2475 (2019), especially when the legally binding resolution is meant to be implemented across the UN. While his delegation was pleased with specific references to sexual and reproductive health services, it prefers a more ambitious reference. Also, the United States understands references to the right to privacy refer to protections under article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. He emphasized that nothing in the resolution changes the contents or obligations of States parties under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n\nThe representative of Senegal, while joining consensus, disassociated from non-consensual terms that hurt the resolution’s full implementation, such as intersectionality, diversity, multiple and intersectional forms of discrimination and sexual violence. These terms will only refer to social relations between a man and a woman. Also, references to sexual health will be interpreted under Senegal’s laws and regulations.\n\nThe representative of New Zealand welcomed the draft’s recognition of the disability community’s diversity. Reducing barriers and addressing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination that persons with disabilities face is critical to achieving equality for all. Her delegation is also pleased with the inclusion of language on sexual and reproductive health as a critical element of realizing the rights of persons with disabilities. While New Zealand hoped to reach further agreement to advance the Convention’s implementation, including on the Security Council’s important work, her delegation was pleased to have achieved a consensus outcome. Ensuring full, equal and meaningful participation for persons with disabilities — including by improving accessibility, leadership opportunities and disaggregated data collection — is essential to realizing international obligations.\n\nThe representative of Nigeria, while continuing to strongly support the resolution and pushing at all levels to implement its objectives, noted that certain provisions are not compatible with national laws, including on multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, gender-based violence and other non-consensual language. Nigeria continues to interpret “gender” to mean biological male and female, and her delegation will continue to have reservations if the resolution continues to contain non-agreed language.\n\nThe representative of Indonesia appreciated the resolution’s focus on humanitarian contexts, especially when looking at the ongoing crisis in Gaza with more than 11,000 casualties. “No double standard shall be allowed”, he stressed. The rights of persons with disabilities in Gaza are equal to the rights of such persons in other parts of the world. Indonesia is also resolved that countries’ responsibilities extend to avoiding disability caused by humanitarian crisis. Moreover, he noted references that do not enjoy consensus and universal agreement, which continue to draw debates on the resolution’s relevance. He further expressed Indonesia’s reservation about references to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination.\n\nThe representative of Iran, while joining consensus, disassociated from non-consensus-based terms that lack clear and uniform understanding among Member States, including in preambular paragraphs 23 and 24 and operative paragraphs 11, 14, 16 and 31.\n\nThe representative of Qatar, while joining consensus, noted that references to sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence will be interpreted under the country’s legislation and values.\n\nThe representative of Kuwait, while joining consensus as a co-sponsor of the resolution, expressed reservations about controversial language that is not compatible with the country’s national legislation, culture and religious beliefs.\n\nThe representative of Mali disassociated from non-consensual terms, including multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, sexual and gender-based violence and sexual and reproductive health-care services. This language will be interpreted under Mali’s legislation, respecting the country’s social and cultural values without prejudice to universally recognized norms. This resolution cannot modify customary law and there is no legal obligation for Mali.\n\nThe representative of Algeria, while joining consensus, expressed reservations regarding references to sexual and reproductive health, gender and related terms that mean dealing with men or women. She disassociated from the term “multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination” as non-agreed language internationally and even less so in Algeria’s national legislation.\n\nThe representative of Yemen, while joining consensus, disassociated from problematic and non-agreed terms, including multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and gender-based violence. These terms will be interpreted under national laws and according to development priorities, while fully respecting all religious, cultural and societal values. Per internationally agreed human rights law, “sexual and reproductive health” will be interpreted according to national legislation and societal norms.\n\nThe representative of Colombia said that intersectionality is not a controversial term in itself and does not go against laws or culture. It is a concept that recognizes characteristics dealing with the vulnerability of some groups or persons. She cited the examples of Indigenous persons with disabilities and gender-based violence against women with disabilities who have been forcibly sterilized. Noting that young persons and girls are exposed to involuntary sterilization in a disproportionate manner, she asked, “How can we not recognize that intersectionality here?” She urged the need to protect this language and to ensure human rights are guaranteed in an effective way.\n\nThe representative of Syria aligned with the statement from Algeria’s delegation.\n\nThe observer for the Holy See, while respecting the facilitator’s decision not to open the whole text for negotiation, regretted that this closed-text approach restricted the ability of States to engage comprehensively — an obstacle to consensus-building on which the legitimacy and credibility of deliberations depend. The Holy See considers that “sexual and reproductive health” applies to a holistic concept of health that does not consider abortion or access to abortion or abortifacients. Regarding “gender”, the Holy See understands the term to be grounded in biological sexual identity and differences between male and female. On “multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination”, he said the expression lacks a definition agreed between Governments, lending to an interpretation that reduces the human to particular characteristics and categorizes individuals according to artificial, selective criteria that are not universally acknowledged, thereby undermining the universality of human rights. He reaffirmed that everyone is entitled to human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction of any kind, as defined by article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nThe Committee next took up the draft resolution titled “Terrorism and human rights” (document A/C.3/78/L.34), which the Chair noted contains no programme budget implications.\n\nIntroducing the draft, the representative of Mexico said it is the result of a combination of two resolutions — one on the protection of human rights and combatting terrorism, and another on the impact of terrorism on human rights. Calling for more coordinated measures, he said the scourge of terrorism puts to the test the values that define humanity. In combatting terrorism, it is crucial to safeguard human rights and fundamental freedoms, he stressed. The draft emphasizes that human rights and effective counter-terrorism measures are mutually reinforcing and highlights the need to protect the rights of victims of terrorism.\n\nThe Committee then approved “L.34” by consensus. By the text, the Assembly would emphasize that terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism cannot be associated with any religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group. It would strongly condemn the recruitment and use of children to perpetrate terrorist attacks and all violations and abuses committed by terrorist groups against children and women. Further, it would urge States to fully comply with their obligations under international law while countering terrorism, and to ensure that measures taken to combat it are not discriminatory and based on stereotypes founded on ethnic, racial or religious grounds.\n\nFurther, the Assembly would strongly condemn terrorist acts and all acts of violence committed by terrorist groups, including trafficking in persons, kidnapping and hostage-taking with demands for ransom or political concessions, and would call on all Member States to prevent terrorists from benefiting from ransom payments and political concessions and to secure the safe release of hostages. It would also call on States to refrain from providing support to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts and request all Governments to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism in the performance of his mandated tasks and duties.\n\nThe representative of Switzerland, speaking also on behalf of other countries, voiced her reservations vis-à-vis the merger of two resolutions that address related yet very different types of human rights violations. Governments must fully respect international humanitarian law, international human rights law and international refugee law in their efforts towards counter-terrorism. Furthermore, the technical rollover is not a long-term solution, she said, adding that an improvement of the resolution on the human rights aspect and matters pertaining to international humanitarian law is crucial.\n\nThe representative of the United States voiced concern that the draft does not reflect important updates or agreed language from other UN bodies charged with these issues. He also disassociated from operative paragraph 15. When designing and applying counter-terrorism measures, States should take into account the impacts of potential measures on exclusively humanitarian activities. He also emphasized that there is no obligation under international law for the completely unrestricted delivery of humanitarian assistance to terrorist groups or individual terrorists.\n\nNext, the Committee approved without a vote the draft resolution titled, “Effective promotion of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities” (document A/C.3/78/L.36), which the Chair noted contains no programme budget implications.\n\nIntroducing that draft, the representative of Austria said the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration last year provided an important opportunity for taking stock of its implementation and identifying constraints to that. The current text emphasizes the importance of strong constitutional and legal frameworks and the rule of law. It also encourages Member States to work towards fulfilling their voluntary pledges, she said, noting broad regional support for the draft resolution.\n\nSpeaking in explanation of position before action, the representative of Niger said his country is party to numerous relevant agreements and has a long-standing tradition of tolerance and coexistence. However, denouncing “the instrumentalization of national, ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities to geopolitical ends”, he dissociated from reference to intersectionality in the text of the resolution, adding that it is a non-consensual concept.\n\nThe Committee then approved that text by consensus.\n\nBy the text, the Assembly would urge States to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. It would also encourage States to take appropriate measures so that persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities have adequate opportunities to learn their own language or to have instruction in their own language. By other terms, it would urge States to take all appropriate measures for the promotion and implementation of the Declaration.\n\nSpeaking in explanation of position after the approval, the representative of Türkiye expressed disappointment about references in operative paragraph 15 to reports of the Special Rapporteur on minority issues. The Special Rapporteur went beyond his mandate and made unfounded allegations, which blatantly contradicted historical realities, he said, dissociating from that reference.\n\nThe representative of Malaysia, welcoming consensual adoption of the draft resolution, dissociated from the reference to “multiple, aggravated and intersecting forms of discrimination,” adding that his country’s interpretation of the term will be based on its national laws and culture.\n\nThe Committee next took up the draft resolution titled “Freedom of religion or belief” (document A/C.3/78/L.48), which the Chair noted contains no programme budget implications.\n\nIntroducing the draft, the representative of Spain, speaking on behalf of the European Union, said that “L.48” underscores the importance of freedom of religion or belief, the right to not believe and the right to change beliefs. The text links these rights with freedom of expression, namely freedom of assembly and others. It highlights the rights of religious minorities as well as the vital contribution of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. The text features small technical updates, such as appointing a European Union envoy to promote the freedom of religion or belief outside the bloc’s territory. These are concrete demonstrations of the bloc’s commitment to make progress on all fronts, including building on previously adopted and related resolutions, she said. She voiced hope that the draft will be approved by consensus as in previous years.\n\nThe Committee approved “L.48” by consensus. By its terms, the General Assembly would voice serious concerns over continuing acts of intolerance and violence based on religion or belief against individuals, including against persons belonging to religious communities and religious minorities around the world, and by the increasing number and intensity of such incidents, as well as all attacks on religious places, sites and shrines that violate international law.\n\nFurther, the Assembly would strongly condemn violations of freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief, as well as all forms of intolerance, discrimination and violence based on religion or belief. Accordingly, it would urge Governments to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, to respond favourably to her requests to visit their countries and to provide all information and follow-up necessary for the effective fulfilment of her mandate.\n\nThe Committee then turned to the draft resolution titled “Promotion and protection of human rights in the context of digital technologies” (document A/C.3/78/L.49/Rev.1), which the Chair noted contains no programme budget implications.\n\nThe representative of the Czech Republic, introducing the draft on behalf of his country and the Maldives, Mexico, the Netherlands and South Africa, said the “pioneering text” reflects the collective commitment of Member States to uphold human rights amidst the rapidly evolving digital landscape. The draft calls for comprehensive measures to ensure human rights are integrated throughout the lifecycle of digital technologies. Underlining the duties of Member States and the private sector’s responsibilities, the resolution clearly states the need for regulation and safeguards to prevent and remedy human rights abuses. It further stresses the key role of participation and leadership of all women and girls.\n\nThe Committee adopted by consensus the draft, by which the General Assembly would call on Member States to consider developing and implementing adequate legislation that protects individuals against human rights violations in the digital context, provide up-to-date guidance to businesses on how to respect human rights and effectively consider vulnerability and accessibility and ensure victims have accessible remedy as threats and acts of violence are investigated effectively. The Assembly would also urge Member States to refrain from interfering with the use of encryption and anonymity tools and from employing unlawful or arbitrary surveillance techniques. It would call on Member States to work with relevant stakeholders to close all digital divides and promote inclusion, as well as strengthen international cooperation to share expertise and effective practices to address disinformation and incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.\n\nSpeaking after the approval, the representative of Uruguay welcomed the balance struck in the text between protecting human rights and access to digital technologies. The draft highlights the importance of closing digital gaps both among and within countries. It is also key, he added, to understand the role of companies providing services such as search engines, data processing, e-mail, messaging, social networks and information channels. Joint work among States and these companies should be unavoidable to guarantee human rights in the digital environment. He also highlighted how these technologies have created new forms of violence against women and girls, preventing them from fully enjoying their fundamental rights.\n\nThe representative of Denmark expressed support for this ambitious and timely effort to present the first General Assembly resolution on promoting and protecting human rights in the context of digital technologies. She welcomed the resolution’s call for the transparency and “explainability” of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. While Denmark hoped for stronger language and regretted that freedom of expression could not be retained in paragraph 16, the connection of access to information with other human rights is also a valuable contribution. The resolution clearly establishes State responsibility for human rights in cyberspace, while recognizing the private sector’s duties. The text also importantly calls on Member States to adopt specific measures to close the gender digital divide and recognizes the importance of combating sexual and gender-based violence and abuse enabled by these technologies.\n\nThe representative of Egypt, noting the core group’s approach to not include new paragraphs and appreciating the inclusion of several concerns into existing paragraphs in the “zero draft”, said the draft still would have benefited from elements to ensure more balance. Also, her delegation does not consider the resolution a compelling basis to influence ongoing or future discussions in other UN fora about digital technologies.\n\nThe representative of Mexico as a co-facilitator with the Czech Republic, said the innovative resolution opens a fundamental and necessary space in the Committee to discuss the impact of digital technologies on human rights. The resolution reaffirms the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of various human rights and their applicability in the digital context. Technologies may be neutral tools, but their conception, use and design are not neutral. They may be powerful tools to speed up sustainable development, but only so if the digital divide among and within countries is closed. These new technologies should be tools to promote inclusion rather than exclusion, discrimination and disinformation.\n\nThe representative of the United Kingdom, while joining consensus, considered that aspects of the resolution could have been strengthened. He regretted that it does not clearly condemn all forms of Internet shutdowns designed to intentionally restrict access to the dissemination of information online. On operative paragraph 13, while his delegation recognizes the importance of tackling disinformation, it strongly believes that countering disinformation should not be a pretext for impermissible restrictions on freedom of expression or other rights. The United Kingdom does not consider work to counter disinformation to be a specific responsibility under international law and strongly emphasizes the importance of doing so in compliance with international law.\n\nThe representative of the United States reiterated its long-standing position that there is no textual basis, in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or other international human rights conventions to which it is a party, that States are obligated under international human rights law to apply or act according to the principle of proportionality. The United States plans to pursue legislation to lead the way in responsible innovation, while mitigating risks or harms posed by AI. Her delegation understands the resolution’s references to legal responsibility and safeguards to mean actions should be put in place in line with domestic legislation. On the reference to the participation of “relevant stakeholders” in operative paragraph 21, the United States strongly supports multi-stakeholder participation in decisions about the development, deployment and use of AI.\n\nThe representative of Singapore, while joining consensus, noted that each country must decide for itself what will work best, considering its unique circumstances and taking into account its international legal obligations. While her delegation appreciated the facilitators’ efforts to strike a balance, she expressed disappointment at the unwillingness to include references to the States’ legitimate prerogative and responsibility to counter online harms and ensure a safe digital environment. Singapore is also alarmed at the core group’s initial attempts to include wide-reaching language on online restrictions without any caveats. “The right to freedom of expression is not unfettered online or offline,” she stressed. States have a right and responsibility to regulate online content, and they cannot take a hands-off approach.\n\nThe representative of Austria said the resolution is an important step towards a human-centred and human rights-based approach to new technologies. She called for a multi-stakeholder approach involving national authorities, human rights institutions and defenders, academia, civil society, journalists, the private sector and international and regional organizations.\n\nThe representative of Indonesia, while joining consensus, emphasized that States bear the main responsibility and serve as the main stakeholder to protect human rights in the digital realm. To balance the benefits and risks of technology, it must be used responsibly to ensure freedom of expression does not infringe upon the rights and freedoms of others, or disrupt social cohesion. She also underscored the importance of respecting each nation’s legal framework. Each State should retain the policy space to develop and implement regulations aligning with their specific needs and context. Indonesia views the resolution as non-legally binding. For its effective implementation, it is essential to align with relevant international legal frameworks and address inconsistencies with ongoing intergovernmental dialogues.\n\nThe representative of Jamaica, while joining consensus, emphasized the importance of the resolution remaining consistent with agreed terms under international human rights law. Jamaica does not consider the resolution a precedent for decision-making on related matters in other UN contexts. From the outset, Jamaica requested due recognition of ongoing negotiations across the UN framework related to digital technology and human rights obligations, since national legal positions are still being developed. Noting the global digital compact and the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, she regretted the decision to not address these concerns in the text. Also, the resolution reflects an extensive discussion of AI beyond the Committee’s remit.\n\nThe representative of Iran, while joining consensus, said the text needs further improvement. While seeing the text as very progressive in its initial adoption, her delegation highlighted that the obligation and primary responsibility to protect human rights lies with States. The responsibilities of other stakeholders, such as the private sector and social media platforms, must also be highlighted. These other stakeholders should observe the countries’ rules and norms, as well as respect the culture where they operate. She stressed that the resolution does not change customary international law or impose any new obligations on States. Iran will implement the provisions in line with its national legislation, development priorities and cultural and religious backgrounds.\n\nThe representative of Israel called for striking the appropriate balance, especially when digital technologies are used for counter-terrorism and thus subject to national security considerations. While she recognized that these technologies can work as enablers of human rights, they can seriously threaten such rights without appropriate safeguards.\n\nThe observer for the Holy See appreciated the resolution’s recognition of the pivotal link between digital technologies and the right to freedom of opinion and expression. The draft also recognizes the need for a clear ethical framework. He highlighted the “Rome Call for AI Ethics”, a project of the Pontifical Academy for Life in collaboration with business leaders and the technology sector. The “Call” is particularly important to protect children online, including through education for them, their parents and teachers. Also, the Holy See understands “gender” to be grounded in the biological sexual identity and difference that is male and female.\n\nThe Committee then turned to the draft resolution titled “Combating intolerance, negative stereotyping, stigmatization, discrimination, incitement to violence and violence against persons, based on religion or belief” (document A/C.3/78/L.54), which the Chair noted contains no programme budget implications.\n\nThe representative of Egypt, introducing the draft on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, highlighted the exponential rise of intolerance and violence based on religious beliefs, including attacks on holy books and places of worship as well as institutional restrictions on dress codes for religious minorities. She voiced particular concern over violence against Muslim communities and burnings of the Qur’an, adding that States are obligated to prohibit hatred. Advocating for intercultural and interreligious dialogue, she condemned violence based on religious beliefs and stressed that more needs to be done on a legislative level.\n\nThe Committee then approved the draft resolution by consensus. By the text, the Assembly would express deep concern at continued serious instances of derogatory stereotyping, negative profiling and stigmatization of persons based on their religion or belief, as well as programmes and agendas pursued by extremist individuals, organizations and groups aimed at creating and perpetuating negative stereotypes about religious groups, in particular when condoned by Governments.\n\nThe Assembly would also condemn any advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, whether it involves the use of print, audiovisual or electronic media. By other terms, it would call on States to take actions to foster a domestic environment of religious tolerance; speak out against intolerance, including advocacy of religious hatred; and adopt measures to criminalize incitement to imminent violence based on religion or belief.\n\nThe representative of the United States underscored that combatting hate and intolerance on the basis of religion can be done without limiting freedom of expression as they are interconnected and mutually reinforcing.\n\nThe Committee next took up the draft resolution titled “The safety of journalists and the issue of impunity” (document A/C.3/78/L.56), which the Chair noted contains no programme budget implications.\n\nIntroducing that text, the representative of Greece said that safeguarding journalists and media workers is a necessary requirement for building peaceful and resilient democratic societies. Highlighting the alarming situation of journalists and media workers in conflict environments and authoritarian regimes, he said the current draft includes some important updates, including a gender perspective. Also noting challenges posed by improper use of generative artificial intelligence (AI), he pointed to a new provision on the role of civil society.\n\nThe Committee then approved the text without a vote.\n\nBy the draft, the General Assembly would urge States to do their utmost to prevent violence, threats and attacks against journalists and media workers. It would be alarmed at instances in which political leaders or authorities threaten the media, noting that this undermines public trust in the credibility of journalism. Further, it would express serious concern at attacks and violence against journalists and media workers in situations of armed conflict, including specific risks faced by women journalists and media workers in this context, recalling that journalists, media professionals and associated personnel in areas of armed conflict shall be considered civilians and protected as such.\n\nBy further terms, the Assembly would express deep concern at all human rights violations and abuses committed in relation to the safety of journalists and media workers, including killing, torture, enforced disappearance, arbitrary arrest and arbitrary detention, arbitrary expulsion and physical and sexual violence, and at the growing threat to the safety of journalists posed by non-State actors, including terrorist groups and criminal organizations. Against this backdrop, the Assembly would urge Member States to prevent violence, threats and attacks targeting journalists and media workers, to ensure accountability through the conduct of impartial and independent investigations into all alleged violence, threats and attacks against journalists and media workers and to bring perpetrators to justice.\n\nThe representative of the United States welcomed the resolution’s language on women journalists and pointed to the increased risks of gender-based violence they face.\n\nThe representative of Niger underscored that this resolution cannot change the scope of his country’s international commitments on human rights. Freedom of the press cannot be and should not be instrumentalized as a way to interfere in the internal affairs of a State, he said.\n\nThe representative of Lebanon said this resolution is timely in her region, where Israel continues its deliberate targeting and killings of journalists. Yesterday that country targeted a group of journalists in southern Lebanon who were inspecting recent damage from its bombardments, even though all of them were wearing equipment and helmets clearly showing they were press. Also highlighting the 37 Palestinian journalists Israel has killed since 7 October, she said such actions will not prevent the world from seeing its crimes.\n\nThe representative of the United Kingdom said it is completely unacceptable for States to curtail the lawful activities of journalists and stop them from holding Governments to account, either domestically or extraterritorially. Her country applies additional safeguards to confidential journalistic material in the context of investigatory powers, she added.\n\nThe representative of Senegal pointed to national legislation that defends the rights of his country’s citizens to information and protects freedom of the press. However, he expressed reservations regarding non-consensual terms related to gender.\n\nThe representative of Israel said her country is a democracy. On 7 October, a freelancer recorded and streamed himself on Facebook entering Israel on the back of a motorcycle accompanied by a Hamas member holding a grenade. Participating in war crimes constitutes a breach of ethical and professional standards of journalism, she said, adding that such actions must be met with swift and clear condemnation.\n\nThe representative of Nigeria stressed that freedom of the press is crucial for democracy and should be given the utmost attention.\n\nThe representative of Syria recalled the words of the former Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir, who said, “We will never forgive Arabs for making us kill their children.” This is the mentality of the so-called only democracy in the Middle East, he said.\n\nRight of Reply\n\nSpeaking in exercise of the right of reply, the representative of Israel responded to Syria’s delegate that Golda Meir said the following instead: “Peace will come when the Arabs will love their children more than they hate us.”"
