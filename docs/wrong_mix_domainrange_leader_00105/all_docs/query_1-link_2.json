        "text": "Fake famine in Gaza, real famine in Yemen. UNRWA, the humanitarian terror organisation, lies constantly about hunger in Gaza. Great for headlines, but simply not true. Meanwhile in Yemen, home to the Houthis who target Red Sea shipping and, as of last Friday, Israel, one in 50 people die every year of starvation.\n\nI pity the journalist who is either too biased or too stupid to understand the difference between the Houthi terrorists, who have attacked Israel and its allies more than 200 times, and Israel, which has finally retaliated after a Houthi drone killed a man in Tel Aviv.\n\nHey Guardian news desk, would it have been so hard, for the sake of accuracy and objectivity, to say that the Houthi drone didn't just hit Tel Aviv, it also killed a man. Your blatant and relentess bias against Israel shames the noble profession of journalism.\n\nIn case you were wondering what the Houthis are all about... This is their less-than-catchy slogan, which translates as: \"God is Most Great Death to America Death to Israel Curse the Jews Victory to Islam\" Not big on peace, harmony, co-existence... or Jews.\n\nI was woken at 3.12am by Houthis trying to kill me - or any other civilian in the vicinity of the Bugsharov beach, in Tel Aviv. Sadly we're used to our enemies attacking us, but it's not usually the Houthis, it's not usually Tel Aviv, and it's rarely without an air raid alert. The blast, from an Iranian-made drone, was about 200 metres from the hotel where we staying. It was extremely loud. One person, a 50-year-old man, was killed and 10 injured. I took this pic a few hours later. A military official in Israel said the Houthis simply wanted to kill civilians.\n\nHow on earth could anyone justify the existence of UNRWA, an organisation dedicated to perpetuating the \"refugee\" status of Palestinians 76 years after the State of Israel was founded, and to \"educating\" kids to hate, kill and martyr themselves?\n\nI have reposted much of UNRWA's shameful propaganda in the past, but I couldn't actually believe they'd have the chutzpah to write this. \"Schools must never be used for fighting or military purposes,\" it says. The irony is too heavy to bear. UNRWA's entire reason for being is to brainwash children to hate Jews and martyr themselves, and to provide Hamas, it's partner in crime, with schools to hide in."
