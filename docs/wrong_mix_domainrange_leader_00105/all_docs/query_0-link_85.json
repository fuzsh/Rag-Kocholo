Known as the Early Bird Briefs, this was edited by Oriana Pawlyk (opawlyk@militarytimes.com) from The Military Times Magazine. I present it here as it appears from my email.\n\nThe editors over at the Military Times compile news by branch of service, by country, by industry contracts, by pending legislation in Congress or the Senate, etc. from many major news outlets, major blogs, and from the Department of Defense and its own publication, Military Times.\n\nHere are the Top 5.

That breaks down to 86 Marines, 38 soldiers and 18 airmen, PACOM spokesman Army Maj. David Eastburn told Military Times on Sunday.\n\n(Los Angeles Times) A shadowy new pro-government force has been deployed in the embattled Yemeni port city of Aden, according to reports Sunday, sparking speculation that ground troops from the Saudi-led coalition may have joined the battle against Houthi rebels and their allies. Saudi Arabia, however, denied that it had sent ground forces to Aden or any other part of Yemen.\n\n(USA Today) Afghan security forces have suffered record casualties this year as they combat Taliban rebels largely without the benefit of U.S. air power and other international military support they had come to rely on in the past, U.S. and Afghan officials said.\n\n(Stars & Stripes) With live explosives, smoke and rocket fire from helicopter gunships, American troops and their international partners are trying to give Iraqi soldiers a realistic idea of what they can expect when they take on Islamic State militants.\n\n(Defense News) Gen. Joseph Dunford, the commandant of the Marine Corps, is at the top of the list to become the next Joint Chiefs chairman, according to several sources.\n\nThis Week in Defense News with Vago Muraudian\n\n(Defense News) The Atlantic Council’s Steve Grundman and Capital Alpha Partners’ Byron Callan discuss Defense Secretary Ash Carter’s recently unveiled cyber initiative for the Pentagon.\n\n(Defense News) Maj.

The suspect was also in touch with Al-Qaeda leader Anwar Awlaki – who was killed in a drone strike in 2011 – in the past.\n\nDeath row controversy: A 23 year old man convicted of murder (of a seven year old boy) when he was 14 is set to get executed on March 19th. The development has stirred controversy about juvenile law in Pakistan, and in a country used to teenage suicide bombers, led to the difficult debate of how young does a person have to be before he/she can be termed a terrorist, legally.\n\nFrankly, my dear Indian foreign ministry, I don’t give a damn: In response to the recent criticism from India about the meeting between the Pakistani envoy to New Delhi Abdul Basit and the hardliner Kashmiri separatist leader, Syed Ali Geelani (which led to a cancellation of talks last summer between India and Pakistan) the Pakistani Foreign Office on Wednesday said that the meeting was a long standing practice and will continue in the future despite India’s objection.\n\nIslamabad supports Rangers raid on MQM: Following the raid of the Rangers in the citadel of Karachi’s largest political party, MQM, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan on Wednesday absolved the paramilitary force of any wrongdoing and instead hailed the act as a “step in the right direction”. The statement was backed by the visit of the area’s top military commander to Rangers headquarters today in a show of solidarity. Meanwhile, no mainstream political party has come to the aid of the MQM since yesterday’s raid, with major players preaching due process for prosecuting the suspects arrested from the party’s offices and buildings.\n\nIndia’s Unwelcome Daughter: The Delhi High Court has upheld the ban on the ‘rape documentary’, but the court is set to resume hearing about the ban on Wednesday.\n\nNabbed: Militant responsible for the deaths of several military and paramlitary officials, including a general, has been detained in Pakistan’s northwestern Upper Dir district.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nU.S., Japan, South Korea Hold Trilateral Security Talks\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAnti-ISIL Forces Make Progress in Iraq, Syria\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHow Israel Hid Its Secret Nuclear Weapons Program\n\nAn exclusive look inside newly declassified documents shows how Israel blocked U.S. efforts to uncover its secret nuclear reactor.\n\nBy AVNER COHEN and WILLIAM BURR, April 15, 2015\n\nFor decades, the world has known that the massive Israeli facility near Dimona, in the Negev Desert, was the key to its secret nuclear project. Yet, for decades, the world—and Israel—knew that Israel had once misleadingly referred to it as a “textile factory.” Until now, though, we’ve never known how that myth began—and how quickly the United States saw through it. The answers, as it turns out, are part of a fascinating tale that played out in the closing weeks of the Eisenhower administration—a story that begins with the father of Secretary of State John Kerry and a familiar charge that the U.S. intelligence community failed to “connect the dots.\n\nRead more about this investigation at Politico Magazine – How Israel Hid Its Secret Nuclear Weapons Program\n\nAbout the authors:\n\nAvner Cohen is a professor of nonproliferation studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey and the author of Israel and the Bomb.\n\nWilliam Burr is a senior analyst at the National Security Archive, George Washington University, where he directs the Archive’s Nuclear Documentation Project and edits its special Web page, The Nuclear Vault.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAnalyzing Corrosion Rates to Understand Hazards of Wrecked Vessels\n\nBy Cynthia Greenwood\n\nDoD Corrosion Policy and Oversight Office\n\nA tank barge that sank amid rough seas on January 24, 1936, in Long Island Sound carried 500,000 gallons of heating oil. To officials at the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, the submerged vessel, known as Cities Service Number 4, poses a serious risk of contaminating the tidal estuary should corrosion of the barge structure cause an oil leak.\n\nThe hull and rivet structure of Cities Service No. 4 is similar to the Navy battleship USS Arizona, now a hallowed tomb for 1,177 men who died when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Oil still trickles from her damaged hull, which makes the vessel an ideal subject for corrosion rate analysis.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDefense Early Bird Briefs – April 14, 2015\n\nToday’s Top 5\n\nIraqi leader arrives in Washington at turning point in ISIL battle\n\n(Politico) Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is visiting Washington Tuesday at a crucial moment in the war against the Islamic State.\n\nPutin Lifts Ban on Russian Missile Sales to Iran\n\n(New York Times) President Vladimir Putin on Monday approved the delivery of a sophisticated air defense missile system to Iran, potentially complicating negotiations on Tehran’s nuclear program and further straining ties with Washington.\n\nVA whistleblowers allege continued attacks, failures\n\n(Military Times) Last July, when Dr. Christian Head testified before Congress about improper record keeping at the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Health Care system, he also detailed what department whistleblowers typically face when they speak out: isolation, defamation, and aggressive attacks.\n\nThe sequestration monster myth\n\n(Politico) Defense Secretary Ash Carter warns that sequestration will make the nation “less secure.” Sen. John McCain says it will set the military “on a far more dangerous course.” And Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey says it will prompt “a dramatic change in how we protect our nation.” There’s just one problem: The sequestration monster lurking around the corner isn’t really coming.\n\nBest for Vets: Employers 2015 rankings are out\n\n(Military Times) With the unemployment rate for the latest generation of veterans routinely running below 7 percent, companies across all industries have realized how vets can boost bottom lines – and they’re fighting to bring people like you onboard.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBreaking: Egypt Hellfire Sale OK’d By State Deptartment Amid Yemen Strikes\n\nBy Aaron Mehta\n\nDefense News (A Gannett Company)\n\n1:48 p.m. EDT April 8, 2015\n\nWASHINGTON — An Egyptian procurement of 356 AGM-114K/R3 Hellfire II missiles has been cleared by the State Department, the first new procurement since the White House lifted a freeze on weapon sales to that nation.\n\nThe sale also comes as Egypt takes part in anti-militant operations in Yemen, which the US is indirectly aiding with logistical support.\n\nIf the sale is given the OK by Congress and details are worked out between the two governments, it would represent the first sale of the R model of Hellfire to Egypt. Egyptian military forces currently operate the F and K variants.\n\nThe sale, with a projected cost of $57 million, would occur under a Foreign Military Sales agreement. Lockheed Martin would be the prime contractor, with work occurring at its Orlando, Florida, facility.\n\nThe announcement of the sale, posted on the Defense Security Cooperation Agency’s website, noted that it would help “improve the security of a friendly country that has been and continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Middle East.\n\n“Egypt will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense,” the notice reads.\n\nWhile the justification statement on weapon sales notifications are usually bland, those two statements are notable, given current events.\n\nContinue reading (On Defense News Website) →\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
