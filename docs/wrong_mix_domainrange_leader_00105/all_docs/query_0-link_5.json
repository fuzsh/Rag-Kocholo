Dozens of stenograms and other documents describe what took place in Israel’s seat of power at the time, including accounts of the minor moments that led to major decisions during the war. These documents leave no room for doubt. Despite the conventional image of “Golda” and the myth of her shortcomings during the war, what these documents show is that she actually managed the war effort vigorously and assertively; she convinced the U.S. to send military aid, saving Israel from the clutches of defeat, and bringing about its victory. Despite the war’s steep cost, the facts show that Golda did not fail. In fact, Israel’s achievements resulting from the war made it possible, five years later, to reach a peace agreement with Egypt."
