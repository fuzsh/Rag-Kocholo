        "text": "Golda lived with her family in Pinsk from 1903- 1906\n\nGolda Mabovitch Meir was born on May 3, 1898 in Kiev, Ukraine. She was the seventh child of her father Moshe and mother Blume but only the second to live. Golda had two sisters. Sheyna was nine years older than Golda, and Tzipke was three years younger. They lived in a time and place in which they were treated poorly because of their Jewish faith. Jews were not allowed to own land and were forced to live in certain parts of the country. They were attacked and mobbed in what were called pogroms which were planned riots against Jews.In 1903, Golda's father decided that he'd had enough of this way of life and set off for America. At this time Blume moved herself and her daughters to the city of Pinsk. This was a Jewish city of workers. It was there that Golda first heard of Zionism, the efforts being made to establish the Jewish homeland promised to them in the Bible. At this time Jews did not have a land of their own. There was only Palestine. It is now separated into the Arab state of Jordan, and the Jewish state of Israel. Finally in 1906, Moshe was able to bring his family to the United States. After 2 weeks on a ship, Blume, Golda, Sheyna, and Tzipke arrived in America.
