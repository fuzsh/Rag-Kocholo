Golda Meir (1898-1978)

Her office, Tel Aviv

24 November 1976

Born in Russia and raised in Milwaukee, Golda Meir was a teacher, kibbutznik and politician who became, at age 71, the fourth prime minister of Israel.

During the sitting, which went much longer than expected, Schwartz asked Meir if she were to start life all over again whether she would have stayed on the kibbutz rather than go into politics. ‘Politics is so full of problems’, she replied. ‘It was as she contemplated this that I got the thoughtful, pensive portrait’, recalled the photographer.
