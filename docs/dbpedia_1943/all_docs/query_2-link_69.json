Ainsworth?\n\nYes, but please call me Bella.\n\nI do hope I can call you Julia.\n\nHow was your journey?\n\nLong.\n\nAnd exceedingly tiresome.\n\nWell, we must do our best to make it all seem worth your while.\n\n-Welcome to the Hotel Portofino.\n\n-How utterly charming.\n\nLucian, I do hope you looked after our guests on the way from the train station.\n\nDarling?\n\n-Lucian... -You're Lucian?\n\nWhy didn't you say something?\n\nWell, the moment never seemed to arise.\n\nHow very irregular.\n\n[sighs] -Oh, darling!\n\n-What?\n\n-What are you doing?\n\n-It was a joke!\n\n[theme music playing] [theme music fades] [Bella] Will you take the suitcases straight into the room... [Lady Latchmere] Melissa?\n\nMelissa!\n\n-Yes, Aunt.\n\n-What's that dreadful racket?\n\nI believe some guests are arriving.\n\nOh, I knew we should have rented a villa.\n\nI very much doubt it would have been as comfortable as this.\n\nA lot more private, perhaps.\n\nHow... how are you feeling, Aunt?\n\nSimply ghastly.\n\nShall I let them know that you won't be down for dinner?\n\nGoodness, no.\n\nOne has to keep one's strength up.\n\n[mellow music playing] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter continues] [cicadas chirping] Look at how dear and delightful everything is.\n\n[music fades] Do you think Mrs. Ainsworth does it all herself?\n\nI'm sure she enjoys getting her hands dirty.\n\nLet's take a look at you.\n\nWell, I suppose you'll have to do.\n\nRemember, Rose, first impressions.\n\n[mellow music playing] -Hello.\n\n-[Bella] Hmm.\n\nOh, Champagne.\n\nHow lovely.\n\nIt's Prosecco.\n\nLighter and fruitier than Champagne.\n\nFrom a local vineyard.\n\nHow did you find your room?\n\nSomewhat smaller than we're used to.\n\n[Rose] But so exquisitely decorated.\n\nWe were wondering if you did it all yourself.\n\n-[Bella] Thank you.\n\n-[Rose] Weren't we, Mama?\n\nWell, I do hope that all of our guests are as observant -and sweet as you, Rose.\n\n-[Rose chuckles] [Julia] Are we amongst your first?\n\nWe've been open since Easter, but it's only in the last month or so that we've got busy.\n\n[Lady Latchmere] How many times do I have to tell you?\n\nI don't drink alcohol.\n\nI am very sorry, Lady Latchmere.\n\nIt won't happen again.\n\nIt's deeply irritating.\n\n[Alice] Is there anything else I can get you?\n\n[Lady Latchmere] No.\n\n[Roberto clears throat] [in Italian] Good evening.\n\nAnd that is...?\n\nOh, Count Albani and his son, Roberto.\n\nI shall introduce you.\n\n[Julia] I understood that all the guests were to be English.\n\nYour advertisement was quite specific.\n\n\"A very English Hotel on the Italian Riviera.\"\n\nYes, quite.\n\nEnglish or... English speaking.\n\nCount Albani is an Oxford man.\n\n-And what about that gentleman?\n\n-[Bella] Ah, Mr. Sengupta.\n\nYes, he's a dear friend of my son's.\n\n-Afternoon.\n\n-It's evening.\n\nSpeak of the devil.\n\nLucian, perhaps you'd like to redeem yourself to Mrs. Drummond-Ward and to Rose.\n\nYou could tell them all about Portofino.\n\nHmm?\n\nUm... Ooh, I hardly know where to start.\n\n-Will you excuse me?\n\n-Thank you.\n\n[Rose] Well, then... start from the beginning.\n\nHow does an English family come to be here in the first place?\n\nOh, well, that one's easy.\n\nUh.\n\nMother really rather fell in love with the place when she was on her honeymoon with Father.\n\n[chuckles] But what made her decide to move here?\n\nI think she thought we would all benefit from... a fresh start.\n\nA new adventure.\n\nAfter the war.\n\nFor Alice, for Lottie, for myself.\n\nEven for Father.\n\nAnd will Cecil be gracing us with his presence this evening?\n\nUm.\n\nI'm afraid my father sends his most sincere apologies.\n\nHe has been unavoidably delayed.\n\n[upbeat jazz music playing] [indistinct chatter] [in Italian] Thank you.\n\n-[indistinct chatter] -[laughing] -[Alice] The main course.\n\n-Thank you.\n\n-May I have some salt, please?\n\n-That's enough.\n\n[Lucian] Billy, when you have a moment, can we have another?\n\n-Thank you.\n\n-Oh, Billy.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nWell done.\n\n[Nish] Take it off.\n\nIt's sweltering.\n\nI'm ready.\n\nCome on!\n\nSee you out there.\n\nCome on!\n\nGet in!\n\nThe water is beautiful!\n\nDarling, you were an absolute trooper tonight, thank you so much.\n\n-Oh, botheration!\n\n-What is it?\n\n-Another stain.\n\n-Don't worry, I can fix that.\n\nI think it went about as well as can be expected.\n\n-Dinner?\n\n-No, the introduction to Rose.\n\n-Oh.\n\n-She's very pretty, isn't she?\n\n-Not that it matters.\n\n-No, no.\n\nOf course, of course not.\n\nIt's character that counts, but.\n\nHer father's 6,000 acres of prime arable land is what counts.\n\n-Don't be so cynical!\n\n-[Alice] You know it's true.\n\nShe could look like the back end of an omnibus and Father would still be keen for Lucian to marry her.\n\nAlice!\n\nYou know, I don't think Father would spend one tenth of the amount of time trying to find me a new husband.\n\nAnd you know I'm right.\n\n[waves crashing] [Nish] Take it off, it's soaking.\n\n[Lucian] So?\n\n-I'm not going to catch a cold.\n\n-Don't be such a baby!\n\nI've seen it before, hundreds of times.\n\nLucian, I'm serious, take it off.\n\nI'd like to see how it's healing.\n\n[dramatic music playing] [screaming] [panting] [breathing heavily] -What's the prognosis?\n\n-Just a scratch.\n\n[chuckles] [Nish] Does it ever bother you?\n\nHardly at all.\n\nIt has been eight years.\n\n[sighs] Italy suits you.\n\n[chuckles] Betty, you are still here.\n\nI were just going, Mrs. Ainsworth.\n\nCan I get you something, ma'am?\n\nPerhaps I'll have a fresh mint tea.\n\nOh, no, no, no.\n\nI can manage, honestly.\n\nAnd thank you for dinner.\n\nOh, uh, Count Albani sends his compliments.\n\nOh!\n\nDid he just?\n\nParticularly for the potatoes.\n\nOh!\n\nWell, I never!\n\nI told you, this is such marvelous stuff.\n\nOlive oil.\n\nI've been greasing the pans with it, ma'am.\n\n-[chuckles] -Waste not, want not.\n\n[chuckles] -Night-night.\n\n-Night.\n\n[Betty laughs] Oh, olive oil!\n\nWhatever next?\n\n[mellow music playing] [waves crashing] -So, what do you think?\n\n-What do I think about what?\n\nOf the girl, you ass.\n\nFirst impressions?\n\nUh.\n\nShe's a bit of a peach.\n\n-Do you really think so?\n\n-[Nish] Absolutely.\n\nAlthough it was hard to tell from five yards away and with you drooling all over her.\n\n[chuckles] I'm sure you'll be very happy.\n\nMm.\n\nWell... nothing's decided yet.\n\n-[smacks lips] -[knocking] [door opens] [in Italian] It's Constance March, ma'am.\n\nThe new nanny.\n\nOh!\n\nCome in, come in!\n\nHow on earth did you get here?\n\nI walked, ma'am.\n\nI got a lift on a cart -for the last mile or so.\n\n-[door locks] Oh, for goodness sake.\n\nWhy didn't you telegram, dear child?\n\nLet us know you were coming.\n\nI didn't want to waste the money, Mrs. Ainsworth.\n\nWe would've reimbursed you.\n\nAre... are you hungry?\n\nI can manage until breakfast, ma'am.\n\nVery well.\n\nLet's get you to bed, then.\n\nAnd we can acquaint ourselves properly in the morning.\n\nLet me help you, I'll show you your room.\n\nIt's slightly makeshift at the moment, but, um, hopefully it will suffice.\n\n[cicadas chirping] I'll, um...\n\nI'll say good night here.\n\nAren't you coming up?\n\nNo, I'm going to take a turn around the garden.\n\nDo you want me to come with you?\n\nNo, you go ahead.\n\n[tense music playing] [dogs barking] -[sighs] -[clock ticking] [knocking] [Henry] My darling Bella, how your last letter thrilled me.\n\nI do so wish I could be with you, to experience all that Italy can bring.\n\nThe beauty of that blessed country is surpassed only by your loveliness.\n\n-I yearn to see-- -[knocking] -You're late.\n\n-The train was delayed.\n\nAh.\n\nHow was Genoa?\n\n-You know, Genoa was Genoa.\n\n-[Bella] Mm-hmm.\n\n[sighs] So... how was it?\n\nAh...\n\nI think Julia was rather disappointed you weren't here to greet her.\n\nAnd Alice's nose is out of joint.\n\nBut apart from that, I think it went rather well.\n\n-And the girl?\n\n-Rose is charming.\n\nYes, yes, yes, but is she pretty?\n\nWill he go for her?\n\nShe's beautiful, but as you know, looks are only a part of it.\n\nBut they, uh, they help sugar the pill.\n\nCome along.\n\nLet's get you to bed, you're drunk.\n\n[door locks] [mellow music playing] [birds chirping] [Lady Latchmere groaning, sobbing] [groaning] -Oh, the agony!\n\n-[knocking] -[Bella] Oh, Nish.\n\n-Mrs. Ainsworth?\n\n-I'm sorry to disturb you.\n\n-[Nish] Not at all.\n\nHow may I assist you?\n\nLady Latchmere's been taken ill. And I was rather hoping... Ah.\n\nI'm a little out of practice, I'm afraid, -and somewhat ill-equipped.\n\n-Yes.\n\n[Lady Latchmere screams in pain] Please, Nish.\n\nIt's just if anything should happen -to Her Ladyship... -Give me a moment.\n\nOh, thank you.\n\nI'm so sorry to ask.\n\n[Nish] It's all right.\n\n-Hello.\n\n-Mr. Sengupta has agreed to attend to Her Ladyship.\n\n[Lady Latchmere moans in pain] -Someone help me!\n\n-Bella... [Bella] He's medically trained.\n\n[Lady Latchmere moans in pain] -Are you sure?\n\n-Yes, she's in very good hands.\n\nWould you like a cup of tea?\n\n-[sighs] -Or something a little stronger?\n\n-[chuckles] Yes, please.\n\n-[chuckles] Come along.\n\n[seagulls squawking] [birds chirping] [knocking] [Bella] Have you been in there all night?\n\nI told Miss De Vere I'd make myself comfortable in case her aunt took ill again.\n\nDo you think I should call a local doctor?\n\nI vote not.\n\nI've relieved her immediate symptoms, although you might, um, serve prunes for breakfast.\n\n-Ah.\n\n-[chuckles] And may I suggest a digestif for Her Ladyship, after every meal.\n\nDid you have anything in mind?\n\nPerhaps a little of that excellent Limoncello you served last night.\n\nYou do know Lady Latchmere doesn't drink alcohol.\n\nThen tell her it's Italian lemonade.\n\n-Right.\n\n-[chuckles] Nish... How... how do you find Lucian?\n\nLike he's finally starting to heal.\n\nPhysically, at least.\n\nAnd otherwise?\n\n[somber music playing] [Nish] What he went through... it will always cast its shadow.\n\n[Bella] Yes, yes, of course.\n\nIt's just... he used to be so full of plans and schemes and, uh... a sense of purpose, and now...\n\nHe will be again.\n\n[uplifting music playing] Give him time.\n\nThank you.\n\n-Constance?\n\n-Mrs. Scanlon.\n\nOh, let me look at you!\n\nWhat a sight for sore eyes!\n\n[chuckles] -I can't quite believe I'm here.\n\n-When did you get in?\n\nA little after midnight.\n\nAnd you're up at the crack of dawn.\n\n-I could barely sleep.\n\n-Hmm.\n\nIt can have that effect on you.\n\nThough if you ask me, Whitby's just as handsome.\n\nIn its own way.\n\n[giggles] -Oh, these are for you.\n\n-Oh, bless you!\n\nMarmalade.\n\nAnd proper English mustard.\n\n[both chuckle] -And... this is from me mum.\n\n-[Betty] Ah.\n\nBless you, love.\n\nWho'd have thought it...\n\nWhen me and Fanny Gray were girls in service together, that I'd be standing here, nearly 30 years later, -with her daughter.\n\n-[chuckles] In Italy, of all places!\n\n[giggles] Oh, come here.\n\nCome, come here.\n\n[sighs] [uplifting music playing] -Hello.\n\n-Hello.\n\n[Bella sighs] Who's Henry Bowater, Esquire?\n\nHe's one of my father's accountants.\n\nNot from the textile factory?\n\n-From his private estate.\n\n-[Cecil] Oh.\n\nI'm writing to him about our cash flow.\n\n-Ah.\n\n-Mm.\n\nWell, I thought I might saunter into town later.\n\nDo you want me to post anything?\n\nI'll find you when I've finished.\n\n-Good, good.\n\n-Cecil.\n\nHmm?\n\nI know what you did.\n\nThen you're one up on me.\n\n[chuckles] It's bad enough that you took the money, but please don't lie to me as well.\n\n[sighs] -I was going to tell you.\n\n-Really?\n\nWhen?\n\nWhen I had the means to pay you back!\n\nBut you do.\n\nWhat about the money from your family trust?\n\n[sighs] I...\n\nI've spent every last sou, I'm afraid.\n\nWhat?\n\nCecil, I cannot run this hotel on credit!\n\nI need all the ready money I can get!\n\n[sighs] Me too, sweetheart.\n\nMe too.\n\n[sighs] -[Lottie] Lucian!\n\n-[Lucian] Why... me?\n\n-Hmm?\n\nHmm?\n\n-[laughs] [Bella] Of course, Lottie will be your priority, Ah, but there will be other duties as well, I'm afraid.\n\n-I understand, ma'am.\n\n-Uh.\n\nHelping Betty in the kitchen.\n\nA little bit of cleaning, if needed.\n\nWe'll need you to muck in.\n\nI'll be happy to turn my hand to anything, Mrs. Ainsworth.\n\nOh, that makes me very happy to hear.\n\nUm.\n\nPerhaps you could start by taking these to the dining room.\n\nAnd be sure to answer any questions the guests might have.\n\nOh.\n\nYou can read and write, child?\n\nI get by, ma'am.\n\nYes.\n\nWe'll have to do a bit better than get by.\n\nUm... -Alice!\n\n-Mother.\n\nThis is Constance March.\n\nThe new nanny.\n\nThis is Mrs. Mays-Smith, my daughter and Lottie's mother.\n\nMight now be a good moment for her to meet Lottie?\n\nNo time like the present.\n\n-[Bella] Marvelous.\n\n-Come along.\n\n-[Bella] Paola!\n\n-[Paola] Signora.\n\n[Bella] Ah.\n\n[in Italian] -[in Italian] Certainly.\n\n-[in Italian] Thank you.\n\n[mellow music playing] [Francesco in Italian] [Francesco] -Good morning.\n\n-Good morning.\n\n-Have you breakfasted?\n\n-Oh, we're just on our way.\n\n-And how did you sleep?\n\n-Adequately.\n\nIt was hot.\n\nAnd the room was somewhat cramped, I'm afraid.\n\n[Bella] Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.\n\nWell, I slept like a baby.\n\n[chuckles] Feels much more like a wonderful country house than a hotel.\n\nDo you know, that's exactly what it was before we converted it.\n\n-Oh.\n\nHas it taken you long?\n\n-Three years in September.\n\nIn addition to the other three that it took to persuade my husband to come here in the first place.\n\nI was wondering if you had something more spacious.\n\n-And on the first floor.\n\n-[Bella] Ah.\n\nUnfortunately, we're fully booked.\n\nMaybe I should speak with Cecil about it.\n\nWell, perhaps I could move one of the other guests.\n\nMarvelous.\n\nCome along, Rose.\n\n[titters] -[birds chirping] -[indistinct chatter] I hope it'll make you feel much better.\n\n[Lady Latchmere] I'm still feeling frightful.\n\n[mellow music playing] [grunts] Oh.\n\n[Alice] Would you like some more?\n\n-Yes!\n\nOh God, Very nice.\n\n-[Alice chuckles] Mm.\n\nThank you so much.\n\n[sighs] There you are.\n\n-Here I am.\n\n-Well, what a pretty view.\n\n[chuckles] Uh.\n\nI thought perhaps that we might take a trip down to the beach.\n\nIt's much cooler in the afternoon.\n\nOr if you prefer, we could have a boat trip.\n\nYou do know how to swim?\n\nNot sure I do.\n\n[chuckles] Well, in that case, it'll be my pleasure to teach you.\n\nI should see what Mama says.\n\n-They make a fine couple.\n\n-As much as we did at their age.\n\n[chuckles] -Have you been avoiding me?\n\n-As if I could.\n\nOr would.\n\n[chuckles] Has he been making himself agreeable?\n\nLet's just say we didn't get off to the best of starts.\n\nYeah.\n\n[cicadas chirping] You know, there really are so many wonderful things to do here, Rose.\n\nPisa and Florence are only a day away.\n\nAnd Genoa's just up the coast.\n\n[Rose] Yes, we came through it on the train.\n\n[Lucian] Hmm.\n\nAnd there's an awful lot closer to home.\n\nEvery church seems to house some treasure or other.\n\nIt's like living in a museum.\n\nI do hope it's not too stuffy.\n\n-Sorry?\n\n-What's that noise?\n\nWhat noise?\n\nThat... awful throbbing hum.\n\nThey are cicadas.\n\nThey're insects, they're... they're like a sort of grasshopper.\n\nWhy don't I see if I can find one for you?\n\n-They're always hanging around.\n\n-Oh, no.\n\nLucian, don't.\n\n-Honestly... -No, really.\n\nI...\n\nI...\n\nI simply can't abide bugs.\n\n[Cecil] Uh-oh.\n\nTrouble in paradise.\n\n[sighs] Well, what about the girl?\n\nWill she go along with it?\n\nRose is entirely biddable.\n\nShe'll do whatever she's told.\n\n[Cecil chuckles] -[Bella] Your Ladyship.\n\n-Oh, Mrs. Ainsworth.\n\nGood day.\n\n[laughs] Thank you for the fun.\n\n[car horn honking] [car horn honking] -Gosh!\n\nWhat a splendid entrance!\n\n-[Jack laughs] Jack Turner at your service.\n\n-[in Italian] Welcome.\n\n-[Jack laughs] [Count Albani speaking Italian] She's a beauty [Jack] Thank you.\n\n[Bella speaking Italian] Please.\n\nBilly.\n\nPlease stop gawping.\n\nOh, it's beautiful.\n\nThank you.\n\nI'm glad you like it.\n\nCome, let me register you.\n\nIf you'd like to sign for yourself and...

Don't worry, they're imported.\n\nThere are certain things you don't rely on the Italians for.\n\nUh-huh.\n\n[chuckles] Thank you.\n\nYou were, uh... You were telling me about your connections in the art world.\n\n-Was I?\n\n-Yes.\n\nI can tell you have an eye or it.\n\nIs it your line of work?\n\nWell.\n\nI buy and sell a bit.\n\n-Oh, you have a gallery.\n\n-Private clients.\n\nAnd, uh... And do you think they might be interested in purchasing some of Lucian's work?\n\nOh, no.\n\nNo, no.\n\nMy interest was entirely personal.\n\nOh.\n\n[laughs] There's really not much money to be made from anything painted this century.\n\nUnless you're Matisse of course.\n\nQuite.\n\nNow, the Renaissance, that, my friend... whole other ball game.\n\n-Really?\n\n-[Jack] Yeah.\n\nThat's what paid for the Mercedes.\n\n-[Cecil] The Old Masters?\n\n-Mm-hmm.\n\nThey're selling like hot cakes back in the States.\n\nMuseums.\n\nOld money.\n\nWall Street bankers.\n\nJust... -can't get enough of them.\n\n-How fascinating.\n\nOf course, the smart money is in authentication.\n\nIf you're gonna spend a hundred grand on a Tintoretto, you're gonna want to make sure you got what you've paid for.\n\nAnd they pay for your seal of approval?\n\nOh, no.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nNot mine, buddy, but, um... Well, I have the best guy in the business.\n\n-Hmm.\n\n-[flicks lighter] I don't mind telling you...\n\nI wept buckets while I were reading it.\n\n-Bless your kind heart.\n\n-When your mum wrote me, and asked me to find you a place here...\n\nI never dreamt the reason.\n\nYou weren't to know.\n\n[mellow music playing] You've had a terrible time of it.\n\nPoor little petal.\n\nNo wonder you jumped at the chance to come here.\n\nFor a fresh start, hey?\n\nSomewhere far away.\n\nSo that's just what we're going to give you.\n\nA new beginning.\n\nA chance to put all your troubles behind you.\n\nTime heals everything, sweetheart.\n\nTime... hard work.\n\n-And good food.\n\n[chuckles] -[chuckles] Yeah.\n\n[Cecil whistling] [cheerful music playing] [indistinct chatter] [goats bleating] Yes, I...\n\nI would like to send a telegram.\n\n-[in Italian] Yes.\n\n-You understand English?\n\n-[in Italian] Yes.\n\n-Jolly good.\n\nUh.\n\nProposition for you.\n\nStop.\n\nMake us both rich.\n\nStop.\n\nTelephone 27th.\n\nStop.\n\nCecil.\n\nStop.\n\n[Bella] The king had a forbidding scowl, -which nearly made the tiger... -Growl.\n\nBut T, without a trace of awe, said, \"Give His Majesty a...\" -\"Paw.\"\n\n-Hmm.\n\nHe added with... [in Italian] Oh, good morning.\n\n-[Vincenzo] Madam.\n\n-Ah!\n\n[sighs] [in Italian] Good morning.\n\nAh!\n\n-[in Italian] Thank you.\n\n-[Vincenzo] Mm-hmm.\n\n[in English] I see.\n\nUh.\n\nLet me make this clear for you.\n\nIt isn't your husband I wanna speak to.\n\nIt is you, Mrs. Ainsworth.\n\n-Very good.\n\n-[chuckles] Lottie, I'll be back in a minute.\n\nConstance, will you carry on rehearsing our play?\n\nUm.\n\nMy office is just this way.\n\n[Constance] Hello, little one.\n\nPlease.\n\nDo come in.\n\n-[in Italian] Please.\n\n-[in Italian] Thank you.\n\n-[in English] Your daughter?\n\n-Oh, my granddaughter.\n\n-And her nanny.\n\n-[laughs] The great British nanny, huh?\n\nThe rock on which an empire is built.\n\nSignore, how can I help you?\n\nWell, it is a... delicate matter.\n\nLet's see how to start this, um...\n\nI believe this belongs to you.\n\nWho gave that to you?\n\nYou have to know nothing happens here -without me knowing about it.\n\n-But this is a private letter!\n\nI know, full of private sentiments and it will be \"una grande disgrazia.\"\n\nI mean, it will be a disaster if this... How do you say?\n\nFall into the wrong hands?\n\nYes.\n\nYou're quite right.\n\nWell, then, I must thank you for returning it, Signore.\n\n-Please... -Sure.\n\nWell, let's hope the many letters you wrote have reached their destination.\n\nHmm?\n\nSignore... What exactly is it that you want?\n\nWhat we all want, Signora Ainsworth.\n\n[in Italian] To order Hotel Portofino on DVD, or companion book, visit ShopPBS or call 1-800-PLAY-PBS.\n\nThis program is also available on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n[theme music playing] [theme music concludes]"
