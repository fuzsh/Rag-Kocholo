        "text": "For the second time this summer, the race for President of the United States came to Temple University.\n\nLast month, it was Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump. This time it was Vice President Kamala Harris — who recently received the Democratic Party nomination — introducing her pick for vice president, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday at the Liacouras Center.\n\nTemple’s campus was abuzz with students and non-students alike heading to the rally. In spite of police blockades and road closures, the streets were filled. Lines to enter the rally spanned entire city blocks.\n\n“It’s a lot better than when Trump came here,” said Allie, a grad student at Temple.\n\nThe news of the day was certainly the selection of Walz as Harris’ running mate. Students generally knew very little about him. Those who were familiar with his record were generally favorable of the choice. Most seemed surprised that Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania governor, was not the pick for veep. Shapiro spoke at the event, enthusiastically, calling Welz a “dear friend.”\n\n“I think that Shapiro [would] have been a better choice,” said Jack Turner, a junior at Temple. “But I think that as we learn a little bit more, and I’ve heard things already this morning about Walz, there’s already good things that come out from him.”\n\nMany Temple students were enthusiastic and optimistic about Harris’ chances of winning the election. Some were more cautious.\n\n“I think it’s pretty 50-50,” said Olivia, a junior at Temple.\n\nAn NPR poll showed that Harris has built a small lead over Trump in national polling since entering the race after President Biden’s decision to step aside as his party’s nominee last month. Two students attributed some of that enthusiasm for Harris to Gen Z, the generation that most recently came of age to vote.\n\nThe event was raucous and full of energy, with a crowd of about 12,000 in attendance.\n\n“I feel a lot more comfortable. I feel like we have a better chance of winning versus when Biden was running. I feel like people are more optimistic,” added Sadia, a junior at Temple.\n\nA timeline for the rally\n\nTemple student Santiago Ortiz is also a Billy Penn intern. He attended the rally and provided this timeline and photos.\n\n1:15 p.m. Arrival\n\nDespite the rally’s start being set for 4:15 p.m., and Harris at 6 p.m., lines around the block of Temple’s Liacouras Center were already forming. People had to wait at least 30-40 minutes in the August heat before entering.\n\n2 p.m. Security and entry\n\nSecurity was very tight, inspecting every item that entered the building. This reporter had to remove the lens from his camera and prove to the agent it was operational by turning it on. Others had their wallets or cigarette packs opened and inspected.\n\nUpon entry, attendees were handed LED bracelets, much like you’d receive at a concert, to wear throughout the rally. The bracelets cycled through red, white, and blue — although they briefly lit in a variety of rainbow colors after Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said “marry who you love and be who you are.”\n\nThe Liacouras Center was decorated with American flags and the digital boards lit with “HARRIS WALZ.” Supporters continued to pour in over the next 2-3 hours and eventually packed out the venue.\n\n4:22 p.m. Jaime Harrison\n\nAfter hours of waiting, the rally’s first speaker walked out. Jaime Harrison, the Democratic National Committee chair, announced that Harris had secured enough votes from Democratic delegates last Friday to become the party’s nominee for president.\n\n4:35 p.m. Mayor Cherelle Parker\n\nA roar of applause erupted from the crowd as Philadelphia’s mayor walked onto the stage.\n\n“We’ve got work to do, and we are going to make sure Kamala Harris is the 47th president of the United States of America,” said Parker, fresh off her own history-making candidacy for mayor, as well as just days after her office posted a social media video supporting Shapiro for VP that sparked international speculation around his odds of being tapped.\n\n4:54 p.m. Sen. John Fetterman\n\nLast week,the U.S. senator from Pennsylvania reportedly was critical of Shapiro as a potential VP nominee. During his brief speech, which lasted less than three minutes, Fetterman called Trump and Vance “a couple of really really really really weird dudes.”\n\n4:57 p.m. Sen. Bob Casey\n\nThe state’s other senator made an unusual entrance and appearance. He ran up to the podium, spoke briefly in support of Harris and Walz, and then spent the rest of his time speaking out against the Republican nominee for his Senate seat, Dave McCormick. Casey, who was born and still has a home in Scranton, said McCormick’s $16 million home in Connecticut is one reason why McCormick is not a true Pennsylvanian.\n\n5:25 p.m. Pa. Gov. Josh Shapiro\n\nThe Pennsylvania governor received a standing ovation that lasted around two minutes. Despite being at the top of the conversation for VP nominee, he expressed strong support for fellow governor Walz, calling him a “dear friend.” He did not comment on how he felt after not being tapped for VP nominee.\n\n5:57 p.m. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minn. Gov. Tim Walz\n\nThe crowd finally got to see what they came for: the first campaign appearance of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. They walked out on stage side-by-side and received the loudest applause of any speaker that day. Harris spent a significant part of her speech lifting up her VP nominee. She complimented Walz on his accomplishments as a teacher, veteran, football coach, congressman, and Minnesota’s current governor. She also gave a nod to Josh Shapiro, calling him a friend and reiterating his importance in winning the battleground state:\n\n“Together with Josh Shapiro, we will win Pennsylvania.”\n\nHarris also called out Trump for his 34 felony convictions, claiming she “knows Donald Trump’s type” after spending 13 years as a district attorney and attorney general of California.\n\nAfter her speech, Walz stepped up to give his first campaign speech as VP nominee. Like Harris, he showed support for Governor Shapiro (and Bruce Springsteen).\n\n“I know this from experience, there is no one you would rather go to a Springsteen concert in Jersey with than [Josh Shapiro],” he said.\n\nHe also thanked his students, who had encouraged him to run for office back in 2006, when he won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Minnesota’s 1st District.\n\nHarris and Walz were joined by their spouses at the conclusion of Walz’s speech, as they received yet another standing ovation.\n\n6:50 p.m. Exiting Liacouras Center\n\nWithin minutes of Walz’s speech ending, attendees flooded outside, where Broad Street was closed to all traffic for several blocks around the arena and pedestrians were barred from crossing Broad Street and Cecil B. Moore Avenue until the candidates’ motorcade left the area. This caused heavy congestion on the sidewalk; it took this reporter around 25 minutes to exit.\n\n7:37 p.m. Harris and Walz’s motorcade leaves Temple University\n\nHarris and Walz’s motorcade departed from the Liacouras Center. Their next campaign stop is in Wisconsin Wednesday afternoon."
