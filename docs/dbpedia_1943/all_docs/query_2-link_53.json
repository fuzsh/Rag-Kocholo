        "text": "[phone ringing] Ah... [ring] Hello.\n\nCecil: Things must be bad if you're in the office at 6:00 in the morning.\n\nLook, there's no way to sugar-coat it.\n\nThe market's dropped a quarter.\n\n25%?\n\nIn two days?\n\nYou're more exposed than that.\n\nYour portfolio's dropped 2/5 of its value over the last week.\n\nJesus Christ, Randall.\n\nAnd my father-in-law?\n\nPretty much the same.\n\nYou promised to look after our money, to treat it like it was your own.\n\n[Chuckles] Well, I did.\n\nMy losses are as big as yours.\n\nSo what happened to you being the wisest man on Wall Street?\n\nThere are no wise men on Wall Street after today.\n\nThen what's your advice, Maestro?\n\nDo nothing.\n\nRide it out.\n\n\"Ride it out\"!\n\nThat's what I'm paying you two cents on the dollar for, is it, to do precisely nothing?\n\nWe need to keep our heads.\n\n[scoffs] And while we wait?\n\nWe tighten our belts.\n\nAnd just how tight are we talking?\n\nCan't afford to give you Nellie's wedding dowry for now at least.\n\nLucky you cashed out all that stock.\n\nRandall.\n\nThat was supposed to be for my divorce.\n\nThen think about staying married.\n\nTell me you're joking.\n\n[knock on door] Not now.\n\nI'm busy.\n\nIt's about Nielsen, Sir.\n\n[Excited chatter nearby] He... he just jumped from the eighth floor.\n\nCecil: What is it?\n\nWhat is it, man?\n\nUm...\n\nI--I--I can't talk.\n\nI'll call you later.\n\nCecil: Randall?\n\n[Click as receiver hits cradle] Randall?\n\n♪ [knock knock] [Clears throat] How--how is the old fellow?\n\nSleeping.\n\nYou--you didn't have to call the doctor out again in the night?\n\nNo, no, no, no.\n\nThe sedatives worked this time.\n\nRight.\n\nThey're-- they're still sure it was a heart attack?\n\nYes, a minor one.\n\nBut...\n\nRight.\n\nCould I--could I maybe see him for a moment?\n\nCecil, I'm not going to let you anywhere near him.\n\nI have to find out if he wants to sit tight or cut his losses.\n\nWell, how much does he stand to lose?\n\nAbout 2/5 at the moment.\n\n2/5 of what?\n\nUm, 50,000, give or take.\n\nOh, my.\n\nCecil.\n\nI-- How could he have let you drag him into this?\n\nI didn't have to drag him anywhere.\n\nHe was banging the door down to get involved.\n\nIt isn't my fault.\n\nWhat about you?\n\nMe?\n\nI stand to lose a good deal more.\n\nSo, the divorce settlement?\n\nI have to wait to see what happens with the market and then find out what I can still afford.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nPlease.\n\nCan... No.\n\nYeah.\n\n[horse nickers] You couldn't find a side saddle, then?\n\nEr, not at short notice, ma'am.\n\nSorry.\n\nWhenever you're ready.\n\nRight.\n\n[Exhales] I, uh, got you these.\n\nBest to try and keep him sweet.\n\nHmm.\n\nKeep your, um, thumb out of the way.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd just, yeah.\n\nBilly... Hmm, fine.\n\n[Sighs] No, Billy.\n\nNo.\n\nOK, OK. Don't be-- don't be scared.\n\nThe horse will sense that.\n\nHe'll get nervous, too.\n\nJust... Hmm?\n\nTo earn trust, you need to be trusting.\n\nShh, boy.\n\nOoh.\n\n[horse neighs] He's OK.\n\nHe's OK.\n\nHold him still.\n\nYep.\n\nBilly, still.\n\nI've got him.\n\nOK. Billy.\n\nBilly, I said...\n\nSorry, Ma'am!\n\nSorry!\n\nBilly, hold him still!\n\nOh!\n\nWhoa.\n\nI have it.\n\nOK. [Alice grunts] Billy.\n\nBilly!\n\nSorry, ma'am.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nBilly!\n\nBilly: Sorry.\n\nOK, OK. We're calm.\n\nYou're fine.\n\n[kissing sounds] Billy.\n\n[clicks tongue] Billy.\n\nIt's OK. Yeah!\n\nYou've got him.\n\nBilly, I--Billy, I want to stop.\n\nPlease.\n\nBilly, Billy!\n\nOK, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\nWhoa.\n\n[Alice moans] Come down.\n\nI... Now watch me, OK?\n\n[Billy grunts] Yep.\n\nOK, watch what I do.\n\nJust stay calm, and so will the horse.\n\nOK?\n\nBilly: Shall we try again?\n\nHyah.\n\nNo.\n\n♪ [church bell ringing] Nellikins, don't be like that.\n\nYou are a liar.\n\nBy the time we go home, you said it would all be sorted.\n\nAnd yet here I am on my way back to England and not one step closer to being Lady Heddon.\n\nLook, I'm as devastated as you are, darling.\n\nAnd I just--I just need a little time to wrap it all up, that's all.\n\nA few days at most.\n\nA few days?\n\nNo longer than a week.\n\nI swear.\n\nScout's honour, Cee-Cee?\n\nI don't want you there a moment longer than is necessary.\n\nTrust me, neither do I.\n\nShe is more beautiful than you said, more beautiful than I am.\n\nNow, listen to me, in my eyes, no one is more beautiful than you.\n\nWhat do they say?\n\nIt's what's on the inside that counts.\n\nOf my father's wallet, you mean.\n\n♪ Betty: There we go.\n\nSalvatore: Grazie.\n\nA lovely cup of English tea.\n\nGrazie.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nA lovely little drop of milk.\n\nAh, no.\n\n[Speaking Italian] Si.\n\nMama, she says the Italian, we don't drink milk in a tea.\n\nOh.\n\nYes, we hardly drink tea at all.\n\nBetty: All right.\n\n[Maria speaking Italian] Yes.\n\nShe said, \"I understand how difficult it will be \"for you to give up being part of your family to become part of ours.\"\n\nYes, well, it will be difficult.\n\nCan't pretend otherwise.\n\nLeaving what I'm familiar and comfortable with to go and live in another woman's house.\n\nSalvatore: Yes.\n\nShe want to make it as easy as possible for you.\n\nYes.\n\nWell, in that case, we'll need some ground rules.\n\nBetter to put our cards on the table now than come to blows later.\n\n[Salvatore grunts] [Salvatore and Maria speaking Italian] There you are.\n\nI only stepped out for a minute.\n\nOf course.\n\nYou deserve a break.\n\nI better get back to him.\n\nOh, really?\n\nCouldn't you just stay for a moment?\n\nI might say something I'll regret.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, you can't possibly blame me for what's happened?\n\nIt's Papa that's been reckless.\n\nBut led by your idiot husband.\n\nPapa took out a loan to invest with Cecil, a loan he secured against his company.\n\nHe has to repay the principal in the new year, only now he doesn't have the means to do so.\n\nIf you're hoping he's going to change his mind about the money he lent you, you're going to be disappointed, I'm afraid.\n\nEither you sell this place and pay him back or Livesey Fine Fabrics itself will have to be sold.\n\nAnd if that happens, let's just say this will be the last friendly family visit to your precious hotel.\n\nNo.\n\nAmelia... why do you resent me so?\n\nMe resent you?\n\n[Chuckles softly] ♪ [Maria speaking Italian] Salvatore: Church on Saints' days.\n\n[Speaks Italian] No meat on Friday.\n\n[Speaks Italian] Salvatore: Wine, not beer.\n\n[Maria speaks Italian] Salvatore: And dinner after 8:00.\n\nSolo pane Italiano.\n\nAh.\n\nYou what?\n\n\"Solo pane Italiano\"?\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nItalian bread only?\n\n[Speaking Italian] Salvatore: She said that-- that you English, you built an empire as big as Romans but never learned to make bread.\n\n♪ My floury baps are as good as anything an Italian can bake.\n\n[Salvatore and Maria speaking Italian] What did she say?\n\nShe want me... to choose.\n\nRight.\n\nLet battle commence.\n\n♪ [Exhales] Bella: I thought I'd ask Vito to help with the soap.\n\nMaking the lye and ensuring that it mixes with all the other ingredients requires heating and cooling to exact temperatures-- It can be a little bit tricky-- whereas my body lotion is far more simple, involves much less chemistry.\n\nUh, Mrs. Ainsworth?\n\nIt doesn't say how much essential oil we should use.\n\nOnly a few drops.\n\nIt's very precious.\n\n[phone ringing] Vito: If you'll excuse me.\n\nYes.\n\n[ring] Vito: Mrs. Ainsworth, your daughter's on the telephone.\n\nAh.\n\nWould you tell her I'm busy?\n\nUh, she says it's urgent, I'm afraid.\n\nOh, really?\n\nUm...\n\nUh, perhaps Constance can lend me a hand.\n\nI don't mind.\n\nBella: Thank you.\n\nIf you could just pipette the oil into each compartment.\n\nI'll see what's going on.\n\n[birds calling] Bella: Why did you let him in?\n\nI didn't let him in.\n\nHe says he won't leave until you hear what he has to say.\n\nYou need to leave this instant.\n\nLady Heddon.\n\n[chuckles] Really?\n\nYou don't wish to know why I've insisted on seeing you?\n\nNo.\n\nPlease.\n\nPlease.\n\nSit.\n\nI've come to make you an offer.\n\nI have no desire to hear your offer.\n\nI want to buy your hotel.\n\nHeh!\n\nMy hotel is not for sale.\n\nOh!\n\n[chuckles] Everything is for sale.\n\nEverything.\n\nMaybe not today but one day...soon.\n\nI would rather burn my hotel to the ground than sell it to you.\n\nWell, perhaps that can be arranged.\n\n[chuckles] I wish you a beautiful day.\n\n♪ What about the rose water, Mrs. Pascal?\n\nMight as well add some of that too.\n\nConstance: All right, but that's the last of it.\n\nOh, she made a new batch this morning.\n\nIt can't be that hard to produce some more.\n\nGo on.\n\nAdd some more.\n\nConstance: Ah--mm.\n\n[stirrer clinks, Constance exhales] [clank, door creaks, flames crackling] Salvatore, love?\n\nSalvatore: Yes?\n\nBetty: Come and have a bite.\n\nNo, no, no, no.\n\nNo way.\n\nSalvatore!\n\n[speaking Italian] Billy?\n\nI'm with Salvo.\n\nCiao.\n\n[footsteps receding] [rooster crows] Maria.\n\nElizabeth.\n\nShall we?\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm.\n\nMm?\n\n[chuckles] Mm, it's all right, Maria, love.\n\nUm, a little bit salty for my taste.\n\nHm, mm, mm, mm-mm-mm.\n\n[Speaking Italian] Is that a compliment?\n\nHmm.\n\nMmm.\n\nMmm, mmm.\n\n[chuckles softly] Oh.\n\nThat looks rather thick.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIt doesn't look smooth at all.\n\nIt looks sticky.\n\nClaudine: Well, we couldn't get it to combine, so we just added some more beeswax to thicken it up and-- The smell's overwhelming.\n\nClaudine: Then it smelled waxy, so I told Paola to add some more rose oil along with the rest of the rose water.\n\nYou've used the entire bottle.\n\nCan't you just whip up another batch?\n\nNo.\n\nAs a matter of fact, we can't.\n\nI used the very last of the petals I had stored to make this this morning.\n\n[chuckles] Do you think this is funny?\n\nNo.\n\nI have just been fending off an offer from Signor Danioni to buy the hotel.\n\nWe have to make this work!\n\n[footsteps receding] [Paola inhales deeply] [exhales] Vincenzo: They're calling it a crash, right?\n\nCecil: Crash?\n\nIt's more like a bloodbath.\n\nThank God your employers hadn't got round to stamping out that extra million.\n\nYou seem remarkably calm about everything.\n\nWhy wouldn't I be?\n\nBecause the value of our portfolio just nosedived by 40%.\n\nWell, aren't you worried about losing your money, Detroit's money?\n\nWe haven't lost anything.\n\nFor crying out loud, man.\n\nYou're not listening to me.\n\nSignor Ainsworth, it's you who are not listening to me.\n\nI just said we haven't lost anything.\n\nWhat are you saying?\n\nTh--they--they want to sit tight, wait for the market to bounce back?\n\nWhat?\n\nNo.\n\nThey want their money back within the week.\n\n[Cecil laughs] I'm facing a wipeout, Danioni.\n\nI can't just rustle up £60,000 with a snap of my fingers.\n\nIt's not 60,000, it's 100,000.\n\nThat was the value, right, of the investment at its peak, hmm?\n\nWhy, you dirty little thief... Man: Hey!\n\nHey!\n\n[punch thuds] Uh!\n\n[coughs] [Cecil gasping] Slow down, Signor Ainsworth.\n\nFirst of all, it's no more than you deserve.\n\nAnd then let me tell you something.\n\nI may be a superstitious peasant, but I'm a rich one.\n\nAah.\n\n[gasps] [shard thuds] Vincenzo: And bring me the ring, too, or there really will be a bloodbath.\n\nBelieve me.\n\n[door closes] So, how much do you need?\n\n£80,000.\n\n[drink pouring] 80,000?\n\nIn total, although I would settle for 10,000 in the short term because that's what Papa needs to pay back the principal on his loan.\n\nOh, it's still a lot.\n\nSo, now you see why I was rather hoping that our little enterprise might pay off.\n\nLook, if anyone can turn beeswax into gold dust, it's you, Bella Ainsworth.\n\n[footsteps approaching] Ah, if it isn't my fellow Parisian.\n\nStay for a Negroni.\n\nI mix a mean one.\n\nUm, perhaps another time.\n\n[footsteps recede] Well, I'm going to need that drink.\n\nAmelia's problem is most definitely not with you.\n\nIt's with me.\n\nAh.\n\nI did get a certain... frostiness.\n\nYes, it's always been like that.\n\nActually, that's not true.\n\nWe were close when we were young.\n\nWe were very close.\n\nAnyway, you don't need to hear my silly sob story.\n\nYou bet your bottom dollar I do.\n\nHmm?\n\nAmelia was poorly when she was young.\n\n[laughs] She was fishing for tadpoles and had fallen in the pond accidentally.\n\nShe caught the most terrible cold, and she threw an absolute tantrum when she couldn't go back to school and was forced to stay home.\n\nSo, um, she insisted on going back and promptly caught viral pneumonia.\n\nOh, God.\n\nOf course, only my mother was allowed to nurse her.\n\nAnd your mother caught it herself.\n\nYes, yes... She never had the best health, even before that.\n\nAnd then, um...
