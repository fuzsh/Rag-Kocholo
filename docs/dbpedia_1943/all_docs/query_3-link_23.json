Through the lighting of a memorial candle, your thoughtful gesture will be recorded in the Book of Memories and the proceeds will go directly towards helping ensure that the family and friends of Cecil Turner can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each other and enhance this tribute for future generations.\n\nThank you."
