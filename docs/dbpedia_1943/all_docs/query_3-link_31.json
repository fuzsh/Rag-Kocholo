        "text": "A federal judge has vacated the wire fraud convictions of Cecil Turner, the husband of Springfield Ward 3 Ald. Doris Turner, as a result of a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court opinion in another case.\n\nU.S. Judge Joe Billy McDade, in a Sept. 1 opinion, ordered Turner’s four wire fraud convictions vacated, but upheld his convictions on two counts of making false statements to investigators.\n\nDoris Turner said she and her husband are excited about McDade’s opinion.\n\n“It means an awful lot,” she said Friday, adding that Turner believes he’ll now be able to receive his state pension, although she’s heard opinions to the contrary.\n\nTurner, 64, was released from prison last summer and from federal custody Dec. 17.\n\n“The court is definitely correct in vacating the wire fraud counts, which we’ve always said he shouldn’t have been convicted of,” said Springfield attorney Michael Metnick, who represented Turner at trial.\n\nHe said the counts of making false statements “were just throw-in allegations. It’s a shame about those.”\n\nA federal jury in Peoria convicted Turner in 2006 of participating in a scheme to allow three state of Illinois janitors to be paid for hours they weren’t on the job. Turner, who oversaw the janitors as director of physical services for the secretary of state, was accused of covering up the scheme and protecting the janitors, although he received no monetary gain from it.\n\nActed as own attorney\n\nTurner was sentenced by McDade to 30 months in prison, fined $600 and ordered to pay restitution of $49,500. The three janitors, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud, were sentenced to terms ranging from two to six months in federal prison.\n\nTurner, former vice chair of the Sangamon County Democratic Party, spent eight months in prison in 2007, but was released on bond in September 2007 pending the outcome of his appeals.\n\nIn June 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court denied his petition to hear his appeal and Turner was sent back to federal prison to complete his sentence.\n\nActing as his own attorney, he filed the motion to vacate his convictions in May 2010, then in July 2010 added the additional argument that his wire fraud conviction should be vacated in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Skilling vs. United States.\n\n“It was a last-ditch effort, kind of a Hail Mary pass,” Doris Turner said. “These kinds of petitions are very rarely acted upon.”\n\n“Aside from the financial ramifications, people now know there was no intent for him to defraud the state,” she said.\n\n‘Honest services’ limited\n\nUnder the wire fraud statute, it is illegal to use interstate wires in any scheme to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false pretenses, representations or promises. A scheme to defraud may include a scheme to deprive someone of “honest services”\n\nIn the Skilling opinion, the high court narrowed the scope of the right of “honest services” to include only cases involving bribes or kickbacks.\n\nThere was no evidence that Turner received any kickbacks or otherwise personally profited from the janitors’ scheme.\n\nMcDade said in his opinion that the court couldn’t determine whether or not the jury’s verdict on the wire fraud charges was based on a monetary scheme to defraud or the now-improper ground of honest services fraud.\n\nDoris Turner said the restitution her husband was ordered to pay was based on the honest services provision, which no longer is in play.\n\n“We’re pretty confident we’ll be able to prevail,” she said.\n\nChris Dettro can be reached at 788-1510."
