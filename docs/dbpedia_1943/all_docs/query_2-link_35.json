He ran the fastest 400m hurdles time in American history during those Olympics at 46.17 seconds. Benjamin also holds three of the top five times in the world for the event.\n\nRai Benjamin, who is competing in the first round of the 400m hurdles at the Paris Olympics Monday, August 5, 2024, began his career as a freshman in Mount Vernon High School’s elite track program during the spring of 2012. Originally a football player, Benjamin quickly found a drive to be the best hurdler during his first year in track as a freshman.\n\nAt approximately 3:15 p.m, a ceiling in one of our classrooms at Graham School collapsed. The room was not being used this summer and all students were outside at the time of the incident. Fortunately, none of our students or staff members were injured.\n\nPlease know that the safety of our students and staff continues to be our highest priority. Students and staff will not be permitted in the area of the building impacted by the collapse until we can determine the cause of the incident and are assured that the entire building is a safe environment for our students and staff members.\n\nWe will continue to update the community regarding the condition of the building and our plans for September to the greatest extent possible in the coming weeks.\n\nMVHS alum Rai Benjamin will compete in his second Olympic Games starting Monday, August 5, 2024. He will run in the first round of 400-meter hurdles on August 5 at 4:05 a.m. EST. Watch live or on demand on Peacock TV and NBC. The repechage, or second chance, race will be on August 6 at 6 a.m. The Semi-Final race will be August 7 at 1:35 p.m., and the Finals will be August 9 at 3:45 p.m.\n\nThe Mount Vernon Board of Education will hold a Special Meeting on Wednesday, August 7, 2024. The video capturing hardware required to stream board meetings for the school district on the Panopto platform is currently being configured and is not yet ready for live streaming, so the August 7 meeting will be streamed on Facebook Live. The first meeting to be aired on Panopto is being planned for Tuesday, August 20.\n\nThe four-week summer school program at Denzel Washington School of Arts is approaching learning in a fresh and innovative way. Teachers from several schools in the Mount Vernon City School District are grouping up at DWSA to teach sixth, seventh and eighth grade students in this Districtwide program. Beginning July 8 and spanning until August 1, students have been mixing culture, the arts and traditional academics. They are beating summer learning loss and having fun while doing it.\n\nIn June of 2020, over a hundred Mount Vernon City School District students applied and were on board for the new Smart Scholars Early College High School Program, which sought to improve graduation rates and college enrollment amongst its students. With its first class graduating this past June, it is evident that the program produces successful results in its mission to support its students on their journey to post-secondary education and beyond.\n\nThe Mount Vernon City School District will begin streaming Board of Education Meetings using the Panopto service beginning with the meeting on Tuesday, August 20, 2024. Meetings will no longer be aired on Facebook Live. Panopto live streams of the meetings will be located on the District website, mtvernoncsd.org. This decision was made based on research and legal recommendations, as the District desired a secure, more reliable location to stream meetings. The District will incur no additional cost for the service and will have full control of the streams as opposed to limited control on Facebook.\n\nComments about meeting topics and agenda items will be accepted at the email address MVBOEMeetings@mtvernoncsd.org. Parents, students and community members can voice their concerns, opinions and questions during and after meetings using that email.\n\nThe Extended School Year Program (ESY) for students with disabilities kicked off its weekly theme of community helpers with a visit from the Mount Vernon Fire Department on Wednesday, July 17, 2024. Students in the ESY program heard a short presentation in the auditorium related to fire safety and went outside to visit fire trucks. Students learned about various parts of the truck and took photos with the firemen."
