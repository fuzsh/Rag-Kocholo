In 1970, he returned four kickoffs for touchdowns and made the Pro Bowl. The four touchdowns tied the NFL season record that Travis Williams set in 1967. The record still stands today.\n\nToday’s card of the day is Turner’s rookie card, a 1971 Topps. He also appeared on a 1973 Topps football card."
