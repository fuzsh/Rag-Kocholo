        "meta_description": "\"Atlanta Chiefs\" features Atlantaâ€™s first soccer team, the Atlanta Chiefs, possibly during their 1969 season. The team operated between 1967-1972 before it was disbanded, and was briefly revived between 1979-1981 as the Atlanta Apollos. In 1968, they won the inaugural North American Soccer League championship. The footage features narration by then-captain Phil Woosnam (1932-2013) introducing the team's players. It also shows the team playing at the Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, as well as footage of a program created by former Atlanta Chiefs player Howard Mwikuta (1941-1988), and volunteers from the Atlanta Chiefs teaching Atlanta high school students how to play soccer. Also featured is a soccer match played at the Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium between Santos FC and the Atlanta Chiefs.",
