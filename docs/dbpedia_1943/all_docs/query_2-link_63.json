He was also a lifelong member of the Motion Picture Academy.\n\n“Throughout Sandy’s remarkable tenure, as a friend and leader, he demonstrated unparalleled dedication and visionary leadership, guiding the association through a period of significant growth and transformation,” said Karen Stuart, ATA’s Executive Director, in a statement.\n\n“Under his stewardship, ATA expanded its reach and influence. Sandy’s unwavering commitment to the talent agency profession was instrumental in advancing the interests of our members and elevating the industry as a whole. Sandy was a mentor to many and he leaves behind a lasting impact that will be felt for years to come.”\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 58 years, Nancy, son Eric, daughter Jennifer Galperson (Rob) and twin grandsons, Brandon and Jonah Galperson.\n\nFuneral services will be Tuesday, August 6 at 12 noon at Hillside Memorial Park, 6001 W.
