        "text": "Eric Turner starred at free safety for the Bruins from 1987-90, earning first-team Freshman All-America honors and first-team Sophomore All-American acclaim in 1988. In his senior year, Turner was a Jim Thorpe Award semifinalist, All Pac-10, UCLA's defensive MVP and a first-team All-American. Turner led the team in tackles in 1990 with 93 after having ranked second in 1989. He also led team in interceptions in 1989 and 1990. Today, he ranks fourth in both UCLA career tackles (369) and interceptions (14). Turner was the No.2 overall pick in the 1991 NFL Draft by Cleveland (highest drafted defensive back in NFL history) and played with the Browns and Ravens from 1991-96 and with the Oakland Raiders from 1997-99. He was an All Pro selection in 1994 and was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1995 and 1997. Turner had recorded 796 tackles and 30 interceptions in his NFL career before his untimely death in 2000."
