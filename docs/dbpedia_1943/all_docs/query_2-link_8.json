        "text": "Each week, the Bowling Green State University Athletic Department names the Jet's Pizza Athletes of the Week, as selected by the athletic communications department based on their athletic performances from the previous week. This week's winners are basketball players Justin Turner and Andrea Cecil.\n\nMale Athlete of the Week\n\nJustin Turner, a redshirt sophomore from Detroit, Mich., scored 21 points and added six assists in the Falcons' win over Western Carolina on Dec. 21. The native of Detroit has led BGSU to its first 6-0 home start since 2008-09. Turner leads the MAC in 20-point games with seven, and his 19.3 scoring average sits second within the league.\n\nFemale Athlete of the Week\n\nAndrea Cecil, a junior from Oak Harbor, Ohio, averaged 25.0 points and 8.5 rebounds per game as the Falcons went 2-0 last week. Cecil shot 53.3 percent from the floor and was 8-for-16 from three-point range in the two wins. She also went 10-of-11 (90.9%) from the free-throw line. Cecil exploded for 30 points and 11 rebounds in the Falcons' win over Detroit Mercy. The point total was a career best, and the rebound total tied her career standard. She knocked down four three-point tries to tie her career best in that category, and had 11 points in the second quarter and 14 in the third, as BG downed the Titans, 79-73. Then, she tied for game honors with 20 points in the Falcons' 79-72 road win over Valparaiso. Cecil again hit four three-pointers, and she added six rebounds in the victory.\n\nFull list of Athletes Of The Week"
