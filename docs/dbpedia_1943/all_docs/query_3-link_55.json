        "meta_description": "My parents, Irwin Rowley and Zina Thayne, grew up and married during troubled times in the Church. Being children of polygamous families, they spent much of their early life in Old Mexico where their families had been forced to migrate at the time of the moratorium against polygamy. Much of their personal history has already been recorded, but I just want to let my posterity know I am very proud and grateful for my Mormon ancestry. They were truly Latter-day Saints who followed the teachings of the prophet and did everything possible to serve the Lord in righteous living. My Father is a High Priest and filled many callings in the Church during his lifetime. My Mother was a devoted family genealogist and it is thanks to her long years of labor that much of our ancestry is recorded and their work done in the Temple. All her family, brothers and sisters, look to her with great admiration and respect--she was one of the strong ones in her family and they have much to thank her for, as do her children. Mom and Dad had 7 children and also have 3 children from my Mother' s previous marriage sealed to them, making a total of ten-seven girls and three boys: Eliza Cummings (Stratton) - sealed to Irwin Rowley William Davis Cummings – sealed to Irwin Rowley Maude Cummings – sealed to Irwin Rowley Irwin Rowley Jr. Cecil Turner Rowley Liberty Bell Rowley (Russell) (nickname Bertie) Bernice Rowley (Strong) (nickname Bunny) Zina Pearl Rowley (Bennight) Bertha Rowley (Steglitch) (nickname Bonnie) Betty Marie Rowley (McVicker) The first four were born in Old Mexico. My brother Cecil and my sisters Bertie and Bunny were born at different points along the way during my parent’s migration back to Utah from Old Mexico. 1923—Stories of My Pre-school Years Getting up to the time of when I entered into the world. In 1923 the family was living in a small frame house in Magna, Utah. My Father was employed at the Utah Copper Mine as a carpenter. In his youth he had served an apprenticeship as a cabinet-maker and was very good at building. I was born January 14, 1923. My Mother was about 32-33 years old at the time, my Father 6 years younger than Mamma. I do not actually recall the first three or four years of my life, but the family has told me stories of things I did. It seems there was an older couple named Pugmire living next door to us and they had a son named Harold who was about sixteen years old at the time. I was about three. I vaguely remember a picket fence with a gate and trellis over the gate. The people seemed to have a liking for me.I would stand on an apple box by the gate and call 'Mire, Mire' and he would come and lift me over the gate and take me in the house for treats. Mamma says he told her he was going to marry me when I was sixteen. My first proposal! Pleasant Green, Utah Not long afterwards, we moved over to Pleasant Green, Utah (about half-way between Magna and Hunter, now known as Kearns, Utah). I was old enough by this time to try and establish my own importance in the house. One incident I remember slightly is crying because my older sister wouldn’t let me rock my doll in her rocking chair. Somehow Mamma intervened and I won that argument. One day my brother and I were having a good time jumping up and down on an old bedspring in the yard, when I spotted a big brown animal trying to crawl under the house. I was very frightened, but he reassured me in a big brotherly fashion that it was only a muskrat. Cecil’s New Trick Backing up a little--During the years between the time we moved from Pleasant Green to the Chicken Coup House, we moved to Granger, Utah.We rented a big house from a family of Jones'. I was about three years old at this time. There was an old pump house right next to the main house. The pump had a large wheel operated by electricity and it spun very fast. One day my brother Cecil decided to show us girls a new trick. He had several shot gun shell casings that had been used. He put them on his fingers and was going to show us the funny noise they made as the wheel spun around. Somehow he got his index finger caught in the wheel and it tore it off. I remember him running into the house, yelling for Mamma, blood spurting all over from the finger. They rushed him off to the doctor and had it stitched up. The Chicken Coop House, Hunter Utah When I was about four years old, my Father bought some land in Hunter and was going to go into business raising chickens. About the time he got the big coop built something went wrong, so we moved into the coop and made a house in it.Whenever someone inquired for the Rowley place the neighbors said with a grin, 'Oh, they live up the road in a Chicken Coop House.' Most of our neighbors lived on established farms that had been in their families for years, so they looked upon our family as being a bit different and thank goodness we were. I will explain that statement a little later. One thing I remember about the move to the chicken house is the loss of my favorite doll. Mamma had boxes of things stored in the woodshed and I spent days searching through them for my doll. I never found her.One thing I forgot--Betty was born in the house at Pleasant Green. While we were living in the chicken coop my sister, Bonnie was born. My Grandmother Thayne was staying with us to help Mamma. I remember waiting in the kitchen with my brother and sisters while the doctor and my grandmother assisted in her birth. It was all very strange to me being five at the time, but it was a happy time to have a new baby sister. I adored her right from the start. My sister, Eliza, was dating James Stratton at this time also. It seemed so mysterious to me, her coming and going so much and being too young to understand.She soon married him. The first Christmas after they married they came to visit us and brought Bertie, Bunny and I a small cedar chest for presents. Not knowing what it was, I immediately climbed up on mine, thinking it was a stool. Alas, too late, it was hopelessly scratched. Eliza was upset and Bertie and Bunny laughed and proceeded to tell me how dumb I was. I still have the little chest--it is over fifty years old now, the only memento I have left of my early childhood. New Home in Hunter, Utah 1928 These were the years of prosperity in the late twenties, just before the big depression hit our country. My Father bought some more land on Redwood Road right across the street in front of Whittier School. He built two fine houses on it; we moved into one and my sister Eliza lived in the other one. School was right across the street and the Church house right next to it. (Hunter Ward). I was five years old (1928) when we moved into the new house. We had never seen such a fine home.Upstairs there were 7 rooms. Living room, or parlor we called it then, a big dining or family room, a breakfast nook, kitchen, two bedrooms, and a real bathroom with a tub, sink and water closet. Such luxury for a family who had grown up with Saturday-night baths in a tin tub in front of a wood stove, a tin wash basin on a stand for washing faces and hands, and the little shed out back with a two-holer--one large one for grown-ups and a smaller one for children. Once in a while two of us had to go at the same time and when I had to sit on the big hole I just knew I would fall through, down into that deep dark pit, but somehow I managed to avoid that. There was always an old Sears catalog to browse through and use for T.P [toilet paper]. We had never even heard of T.P. on a roll in those days. My sisters and I had another good use for old catalogs. We cut out all the people and used them for paper dolls. They were our treasure and we guarded them carefully. Back to the house. It also had a full basement. It wasn't completed before we moved into the house-­ it still had a dirt floor. One time when we had company I was running around playing and fell on a big sharp rock. I have the scar on my knee to this day. It was a very deep cut. Nobody paid attention to it until about a week later when it became swollen with infection. | BillionGraves",
