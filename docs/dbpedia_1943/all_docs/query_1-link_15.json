He also holds the school record in the 100-yard and 220-yard dashes.\n\nHe won the NCAA title and earned All-American honors in the 220 in 1970. Turner captured the Pac-8 Northern Division title in the 100-yard dash in 1968. He is the second all-time leading dual meet point scorer at OSU (175).\n\nTurner was the 1967 National College Freshman of the Year. He also shared the world record for the 50-yard dash indoor mark in 1968, and set a new conference championships record in the 220 in 1970.\n\nAt one time in his illustrious carrier earned the title, for a brief period, as \"Fastest Man Alive\" for his efforts in the 100, 200, and 4x1 sprints. Among his many accomplishments he has won a silver medal in the 100m dash for the 1967 Pan American games.
