Happy 80th birthday to Cecil Turner! Turner was a wide receiver and kick returner for the Chicago Bears from 1968 to 1973. In 1970, he returned four kickoffs for touchdowns and made the Pro Bowl. The four touchdowns tied the NFL season record that Travis Williams set in 1967. The record still stands today.

Today’s card of the day is Turner’s rookie card, a 1971 Topps. He also appeared on a 1973 Topps football card.
