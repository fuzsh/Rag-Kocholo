        "text": "telecom internet media Future outlooks from 2007's lessons Now is the time to keep one’s eye on the sky, all around and, above all, ahead. At our feet is a constant swirl of innovation in technology, marketing and business models, at times flowing faster and deeper than the most optimistic of forecasts. It reflects the push of the past; now we should heed the pull of the future. The horizon of the digital world is crowded with challenge. The acceleration of bitrate in mobile and fixed communication apparently knows no end. New uses of the Internet, in a seeming explosion of pent-up energy, are somehow clustering around Web 2.0. And value chains are unravelling into new links between consumers and providers of equipment, service and content. This report, our eighth, is a rare collection of data and discussion on the many dimensions of the Digiworld <strong>2008</strong>, analysed and reported upon by IDATE’s experts against the backdrop of a year when eras changed. <strong>DigiWorld</strong> <strong>Yearbook</strong> <strong>2008</strong> The digital world’s challenges <strong>DigiWorld</strong> <strong>Yearbook</strong> <strong>2008</strong> The digital world’s challenges www.idate.org"
