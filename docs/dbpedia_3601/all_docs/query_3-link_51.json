Pende tribesmen killed a colonial tax collector, Maximilien Balot, in Kilamba on June 8, 1931.

Pierre Ryckmans served as Governor-General of Belgian Congo from September 14, 1934 to December 31, 1946. During this twelve-year period, there was a significant amount of unrest in the Belgian Congo. Mine workers went on strike in Jadotville (Likasi) and Élisabethville (Lubumbashi) in southern Belgian Congo on December 3-10, 1941. Fifteen striking workers were killed by government troops in Jadotville (Likasi), and one striking worker was killed by mine policemen near Élisabethville (Lubumbashi) on December 8, 1941. Several striking workers (possibly 60 to 100) were killed by government police in Élisabethville (Lubumbashi) on December 9, 1941.

The mutiny spread to other locations, including Kamina in Katanga Province and Jadotville (Likasi) on February 22, 1944. Belgian troops suppressed the mutiny in May 1944. Some 100 Congolese soldiers, including Sergeant-Major Ngoie Mukalabushi, who participated in the mutiny in Luluabourg (Kananga) were later executed by colonial authorities. Dock workers staged a general strike for union rights and higher wages in Matadi beginning on November 26, 1945, resulting in the deaths of at least seven individuals.

Local elections were held in December 1957. Henri Arthur Cornelis served as Governor-General of Belgian Congo from July 12, 1958 to June 30, 1960. The Congolese National Movement (Mouvement Nationale Congolais – MNC) was established with Patrice Lumumba as president on October 10, 1958. Patrice Lumumba, leader of the MNC, called for the total independence of the Congo from Belgium in a speech given in Léopoldville (Kinshasa) on December 28, 1958. Government troops clashed with Congolese (including many supporters of ABAKO which had planned a rally) in Léopoldville (Kinshasa) on January 4-7, 1959, resulting in the deaths of numerous individuals (most estimates range from 49 to 500). Joseph Kasa-Vubu, leader of ABAKO, was arrested by government police on January 12, 1959. Government troops clashed with Congolese nationalists in Léopoldville (Kinshasa) on January 27-28, 1959, resulting in the death of one individual. The African Solidarity Party (Parti Solidaire Africain – PSA) was established by Antoine Gizenga and Cléophas Kamitatu on February 1, 1959. On September 27, 1959, the PSA and ABAKO called for a boycott of the upcoming local elections. Six Congolese were killed by government police during riots in Matadi, and 20 individuals were killed in inter-tribal (Lulua and Baluba) violence in Luluabourg (Kananga) on October 11-12, 1959. Government police clashed with Congolese nationalists in Stanleyville (Kisangani) on October 29-31, 1959, resulting in the deaths of several dozen individuals (most estimates range from 24 to 75).

Government police and Congolese nationalists clashed near Léopoldville (Kinshasa) on May 6, 1960, resulting in the deaths of two individuals. Parliamentary elections were held on May 11-22, 1960, and Patrice Lumumba’s faction of the MNC won 36 out of 137 seats in the Chamber of Representatives.
