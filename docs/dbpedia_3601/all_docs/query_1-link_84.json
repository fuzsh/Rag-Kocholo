        "meta_description": "Mabiala Kuelo was born in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (then Zaire) in 1985. His family were from Bas-Congo (now Kongo Central) province. His father worked in \"label production,\" designing and producing textiles, and his mother worked at home. Both sides of his family had historical ties to land ownership and traditional leadership in the Bas-Congo region. He describes his family as members of the aspiring middle class in a country divided between rich and poor. This relatively security was upended by his father's early death, but the family was able to sufficiently recover to send Kuelo to the University of Kinshasa, where he studied \"family law.\" As a university student, Mabiala Kuelo had his first political and organizing experiences. Early in his university career, he engineered the election of a fellow student as the \"head of promotion\" (similar to the president of university class). This experience gave him the confidence to approach a neighbor, who was then an advisor to the prime minister, to run for a seat in Congo's lower house of parliament. Still a student, he developed an organizing \"project\" with which he convinced the neighbor to run and to take him (MK) on as a campaign manager. During this period, Kuelo also applied for a US Diversity Visa \"by accident.\" To his surprise, he was offered an opportunity to come to the US in 2011, shortly after his neighbor won his election. Despite his promising career in Congolese politics, Kuelo decided to take the opportunity. He explains how he started his new life in New York City, where an aunt lived, as a factory worker. Conditions were bad enough that he considered returning to the Congo (only to be convinced to stay by the same neighbor who he had helped elect to parliament). After deciding to stay, Kuelo followed a friend's advice and moved from New York to Beardstown, Illinois, where a growing number of Congolese had found work in a local meatpacking plant. Although he disliked the lack of privacy (eventually moving to Springfield, IL), he stayed in the area, working as a rib trimmer in the plant, and becoming an important figure in the union, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 431. He explains how, over time, he became a shop steward and later a part-time union representative and organizer. At the time of the interview, he was involved in recruiting workers to join the union in right-to-work Iowa at a unionized plant in Waterloo. His reflections include a discussion of \"workers' language,\" comparisons between unions in the US and Africa, the qualities necessary for survival as a meatpacking worker, and UFCW contract priorities.",
