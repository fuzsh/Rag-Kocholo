The Museum’s latest exhibit focuses on the origins of jazz music and culture here in the very city the genre was born.\n\nThe exhibit will chronicle the history and evolution of New Orleans jazz, exploring its diverse roots and varied trajectory, as well as highlighting the lives and legacies of key performers such as Buddy Bolden, Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Lizzie Miles, and Jelly Roll Morton.\n\nThe exhibit will include interactive technology, listening stations, multimedia installations, immersive experiences, and built environments optimized to convey the story of early jazz and its ongoing evolution. Visitors will be able to view instruments, photographs, recordings, sheet music, and other historical artifacts from the museum’s 30,000 piece collection to truly appreciate the ingenuity and innovation of some of New Orleans’ greatest musicians who have not only impacted the local music scene, but also the global music community.\n\n“We hope that this new exhibit will serve to educate our visitors about the rich history of what is considered New Orleans’ quintessential art form.” says Greg Lambousy, Director of the New Orleans Jazz Museum. “We are excited to showcase some of the never before seen artifacts from the Museum’s extensive collection and engage the public to further explore our city’s music legacy.”\n\nThe exhibit opening on April 11th will begin with a celebratory reception from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on the second floor of the New Orleans Jazz Museum.\n\n“As we celebrate the Year of Music in Louisiana, we cannot overlook the rich cultural heritage of New Orleans Jazz,” says Lt Governor Billy Nungesser. “We are happy to present this new exhibit to visitors from all over the world as a way of celebrating its unique legacy.”\n\nThe New Orleans Jazz Museum is grateful for our generous sponsors:\n\nExhibition Presenting Sponsor: Joyce and George Wein Foundation\n\nExhibition Supporting Sponsors: Anne Atkinson, Nate and Priscilla Gordon\n\nOpening Event Presenting Sponsor: Gregory Holt and Lucy Burnett\n\n###\n\nAbout the New Orleans Jazz Museum\n\nThe New Orleans Jazz Museum’s mission is to celebrates jazz, in all its forms, by showcasing dynamic and interactive exhibits; developing multi-generational, educational programming; being a hub for music research; and hosting musical performances for local, national and global artists so museum visitors can fully explore America’s quintessential musical art form in the city where jazz was born. All of the museum’s programming is made possible by funds raised at its annual Improvisations Gala which is set to make its return December 7, 2024."
