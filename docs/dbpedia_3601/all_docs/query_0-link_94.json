        "text": "\"He is a player who is hungry for success and knows you have to fight to get what you want.\"\n\nJurgen Klopp's description of Luis Diaz shortly after his £49m arrival at Liverpool from Porto at the end of the January transfer window resonated some 5,000 miles away in Colombia.\n\nLiverpool had done their homework on Diaz – \"he is someone we had been tracking for a very long time,\" added Klopp – but few know the full extent of his fighting spirit like the coaches who oversaw the first steps of his extraordinary journey to the top.\n\nThe 25-year-old has made an explosive start to life at Liverpool. \"He looks like he has been there for years,\" Carlos Paniagua, who coached him in Colombia's U20s, tells Sky Sports.\n\nBut all this seemed implausible not so long ago.\n\nAt 18, Diaz was not even attached to a professional club. As a native of La Guajira, one of Colombia's most underdeveloped regions, and a member of the Wayuu, an indigenous community afflicted by poverty and malnutrition, the odds of finding one were stacked against him.\n\n\"Very few players come out of that zone of the country and that’s part of what makes his story exceptional,\" explains Paniagua.\n\n\"He’s an indigenous boy who was discovered by Atletico Junior. Now he’s the jewel of Colombian football and the pride of us all.\"\n\nHis discovery, as Paniagua terms it, took place in early 2015 at an open trials event organised by Atletico Junior - one of only three top-level clubs based on Colombia’s northern coast – in the city of Barranquilla, some six hours' drive from Diaz's hometown of Barrancas near the border with Venezuela.\n\nDiaz was one of \"around 3,000 young players from all over the Caribbean region of Colombia\" to attend the event, according to Octavio Rivera, Junior's director of youth football at the time.\n\n\"He didn't look like much at a glance, which is why he hadn’t attracted attention before,\" Rivera tells Sky Sports.\n\n\"It happens with a lot of young players in Colombia. They don’t have the conditions they need to develop adequately because of poor nutrition and a lack of financial support.\"\n\nOn this occasion, however, the scrawny left winger stood out from the crowd, his talent prompting Juan Carlos Cantillo, one of the club's watching scouts, to alert his colleagues.\n\n\"There were players of different ages and different levels but Juan Carlos told me Lucho had shown attributes which were very different from everyone else he had seen,\" says Rivera.\n\n\"He was very thin, but he had abnormal levels of stamina and energy for a kid of his age and he shone above all the others because of his dribbling ability, his feints, his speed and his character. He excelled in all of those areas.\"\n\nFernel Diaz, who would become one of Diaz's first coaches in Junior's youth teams, was similarly impressed.\n\n\"He was very skinny and lost a lot of duels because he lacked natural strength,\" he tells Sky Sports. \"But he had a lot of ability.\n\n\"I mean a lot.\"\n\nDiaz was immediately enrolled in Junior's youth set-up, the move facilitated by an uncle who agreed to take him to and from training.\n\nFor all his talent, though, it took some time for him to make his mark in his new surroundings.\n\n\"One characteristic that is very important with Lucho is humility,\" says Rivera. \"He didn’t have the economic support he needed but he was very dedicated and very professional in all respects.\n\n\"If you ask me what’s behind his success, I would say his humility, his resilience and his ability to overcome difficulties without complaining or asking for anything from anyone.\n\n\"But initially at Junior, that meant he was a little bit hidden – or at least he was until we did our famous 'ranking', where we analyse and rank all of the players in Junior’s youth-set up.\"\n\nThe analysis, carried out by Rivera, Fernel Diaz and several other youth coaches at Junior, placed Diaz top out of 450 players from all age groups in terms of potential.\n\n\"We were quite surprised, but from that moment on, he had 100 per cent support from the club to ensure he developed in the right way,\" adds Rivera.\n\nThe first step was to create a team for him. At the time, Junior had U17 and U20 sides competing at national level but nothing in between. Diaz was too old for the U17s and not deemed ready for the U20s, so an U18 side was created specifically for him.\n\nCarra confident of victory over 'lucky' Madrid\n\nLiverpool must overcome Madrid mythology\n\nSalah 'sure' of Liverpool stay next season\n\nAs it transpired, though, Diaz barely featured for them, quickly convincing his coaches he was in fact ready for the step up to the U20s, his progress accelerated by a call-up to the Colombia squad for the Copa America of Indigenous Peoples in Chile in July 2015.\n\nDiaz excelled at the tournament, scoring two goals and producing a string of eye-catching performances for a side coached by Colombian legend Carlos Valderrama before they were beaten 1-0 by Paraguay in the final.\n\n\"He’s a tremendous player,\" said Valderrama afterwards.\n\nThe tournament provided a glimpse of Diaz's talent on a national stage and alerted other Colombian clubs to his potential but physically he remained underweight at less than eight stone.\n\n\"Normally, we would put a young player like him onto a physical regime at 15 years old but Luis only arrived at Junior at 18 and it becomes a lot more difficult at that point,\" says Fernel Diaz.\n\nSo much so, in fact, that Rivera decided to confront the club's hierarchy to ask for further help.\n\n\"Lucho still hadn’t been given a professional contract at that point, so, in March 2016, I asked the president of the club to give him one as a matter of urgency because we knew he was underweight and he needed greater support with everything.\"\n\nRivera's request was approved and despite interest from Junior's head coach, Alexis Mendoza, in promoting Diaz directly to the first-team squad, it was agreed the youngster would instead be sent to affiliate club Barranquilla FC, where he could be eased into men's football in Colombia's second division.\n\n\"We didn't think he was ready to play for Junior’s first team,\" says Rivera. \"We felt we still needed to build him up and give him a longer process of development and that’s when the option of Barranquilla FC appeared.\"\n\nAs a professional player at Barranquilla, Diaz was housed with team-mates in club accommodation and given access to better resources, including dietary supplements intended to help him gain weight as well as more specialised coaching.\n\n\"He would be in the gym doing double sessions in addition to his normal training,\" says Fernel Diaz. \"Barranquilla put him in their first-team squad and supported him in a very, very professional way with interdisciplinary coaching,\" adds Rivera.\n\n\"They began building him into the professional player he is today.\"\n\nDiaz initially represented Barranquilla’s U19 and U20 sides while training with their first-team squad, continuing to impress at youth level just as he had at Junior.\n\nBut the step up to the senior side brought challenges.\n\n\"Everybody had big expectations of him but the truth is he found it very difficult because his body was changing,\" explains Rivera.\n\n\"He went from 50kg to 58kg, which was a step from not having anything to having something, and when players develop physically in that way, they can lose certain qualities.\"\n\nFortunately, Barranquilla's coaching staff, led by head coach Arturo Reyes, were well aware of Diaz's potential and careful not to ask too much of him in the knowledge he was still catching up with his peers physically.\n\n\"The club had devised a sporting project for him,\" says Rivera. \"They were very clear that he had elite qualities but they also knew it was a process which required patience.\n\n\"So, even though he didn't play particularly well at first, nobody ever doubted him. They never pushed him or rushed him and that was very important in his development.\n\n\"They let him be, and they let him play, too.\n\n\"He always played.\"\n\nThe first-team exposure steeled him for what was to come and, crucially, it also brought him to the attention of national-team coaches who were putting a squad together for the U20 Sudamericano tournament in Ecuador in early 2017.\n\n\"When you work in the national teams here in Colombia, you have friends all across the country and Octavio Rivera was one of those for me,\" says Paniagua, who was working as assistant coach of Colombia’s U20s at the time.\n\n\"Octavio knew I was looking for players born in 1997 in that area of the coast, so he invited me to Barranquilla to watch a couple of their boys in a Primera B (second division) game.\n\n\"There was a left-back who caught my eye, Gabriel Fuentes, and then there was Luis Diaz, a very skinny boy who was extremely quick and very skilful.\n\n\"I knew he had played for Colombia’s indigenous team with El Pibe, Carlos Valderrama, so I had some contact with him and he told me Luis had come through many difficulties.\n\n\"But his potential was clear. In the end, I did a lot of scouting of Luis at Barranquilla and I was really impressed by his speed, his ability, and the ease with which he arrived in the opposition box.\"\n\nDiaz was invited to train with Colombia’s U20s in Bogota and, like Fernel Diaz and Rivera at Junior, Paniagua and his national-team colleagues were immediately struck by his humility.\n\n\"When he came for the first time, the first thing we saw was that he was a very humble boy,\" says Paniagua.\n\n\"He had a lot of financial needs and he was determined to make the most of the opportunity we had given him in order to help his family. He was always thinking about his family.\n\n\"We saw that he was a very shy and quiet boy, but on the pitch, he showed what we had seen in him at Barranquilla.\n\n\"He had fantastic qualities, even though he was still struggling a bit with his end product.\"\n\nPaniagua and U20s head coach Carlos Restrepo worked with Diaz to refine his decision-making, but the youngster's physical shortcomings were more difficult to overcome.\n\n\"Bogota is not always the best place to see players who come from coastal areas of the country because it is at a much higher altitude,\" says Paniagua. \"That can hit them quite hard and means they can’t always show their full potential.\"\n\nThe altitude compounded Diaz's physical issues and, while was still able to impress in bursts during training, Paniagua and Restrepo were warned against selecting him for the upcoming Sudamericano by national-team doctors who feared his body would not be able to handle the workload.\n\n\"Our own analysis told us the same thing,\" continues Paniagua.\n\n\"At a Sudamericano, you play nine games in a period of only 25 days and this tournament was taking place in Quito in Ecuador, which is also at high altitude.\n\n\"We weren’t sure Luis had the physical condition to manage a full tournament like that.\"\n\nIn the end, though, he was deemed impossible to ignore – not just because of his talent but his character too.\n\n\"He had an immense desire to develop as a player,\" says Paniagua. \"He had great respect for authority, he was a polite boy who knew how to listen, and he was always thinking about how he could improve and how he could overcome the obstacles put in front of him in order to help his family.\"\n\nDiaz viewed the tournament as an opportunity to do that and while fears over the workload proved justified – \"we weren’t able to use him much in the second round of games,\" says Paniagua – he shone in meetings with Chile and Venezuela and returned to his club having enhanced his reputation significantly.\n\nBack at Barranquilla, it was becoming clear he would soon be ready for his next step.\n\nWithin a few months of the U20 Sudamericano in Ecuador in 2017, Diaz had moved back from Barranquilla to Junior, where he began to feature in Colombia’s top tier for the first time.\n\nJulio Comesaña, a Uruguayan manager with a long association with Junior, had been appointed in April of that year and immediately became aware of Diaz's potential during a Copa Colombia clash with Barranquilla in which he later recalled it was \"almost impossible to stop him\".\n\nComesaña had built a strong reputation for developing young players across six separate spells at Junior – \"he has a magic effect on them,\" says Rivera with a chuckle – and, just like Carlos Bacca, Teofilo Gutierrez and many others previously, Diaz thrived under his guidance.\n\n\"That was when Luis really exploded,\" says Paniagua. \"He was finally maturing physically and the work Junior did with him was more specialised, allowing him to become a regular starter at the top level.\"\n\nDiaz helped Junior win Colombia’s Primera A title and reach the final of the Copa Sudamericana in 2018, a stellar breakthrough year which also brought a first senior cap for the national team in a friendly against Argentina in New Jersey.\n\nDiaz was blossoming, his performances attracting interest from Argentinian giants River Plate – \"River are always trying to sign the best young Colombian players before they go to Europe,\" says Fernel Diaz – but shortly after representing Colombia in the 2019 Copa America in Brazil, he completed the €7m (£5.9m) move to Porto which would pave the way for his transfer to Liverpool.\n\n\"Of course, it is important to acknowledge that Porto have also played a big part in his development,\" says Rivera.\n\n\"But if we had the infrastructure and resources of European clubs such as Porto here in Colombia, I truly believe there would be thousands of Luis Diazes – not just one.\n\n\"We lose a lot of talent because of the economic situation.\"\n\nIt makes the boy from La Guajira's rise to stardom even more special. Those who helped him on his way in Colombia are now watching on with pride as he follows up a sensational first half of the season at Porto with more of the same on Merseyside, his performances on the global stage a reminder of just how far he has come.\n\n\"If you look at his record at Barranquilla FC, you see he only scored three goals in 50 games,\" says Rivera. \"He was always a winger who created more than he scored but now he is a top, top goalscorer.\n\n\"He has had an incredible growth but it is not a surprise to any of us here because his potential was enormous.\"\n\nPaniagua adds: \"I watched him make his Premier League debut for Liverpool against Leicester and I loved it because he looks like the same boy as the one I knew in Colombia. Humble, always ready to work for the team and improve, but always smiling too.\"\n\n\"That’s the biggest quality Lucho has,\" Rivera continues.\n\n\"Liverpool fans are going to enjoy him because he will run and fight for the team and he is capable of magic. But most of all he is a boy who will do anything for you on the pitch with a smile.\n\n\"I have had the chance to work with thousands of young players in Colombia but in terms of character, in terms of resilience and the capacity to fight, there has been nobody like Lucho.\""
