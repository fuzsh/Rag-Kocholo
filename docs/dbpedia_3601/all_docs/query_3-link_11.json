        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nshannon lee dawdy The Burden of Louis Congo and the Evolution of Savagery in Colonial Louisiana In 1725, Louisiana o≈cials freed an African slave named Louis Congo and appointed him public executioner. For at least twelve years, Louis Congo was the only man in the colony invested with the power to whip, brand, amputate, break, and hang subjects, be they white, Indian, or fellow Africans. His appointment to this position was a local innovation to the metropole’s Code Noir that supposedly ruled the ways in which whites and blacks, slave and free, were to interact in the French colonies. The rationale behind Congo’s selection is unknown, but the power he held to whip or hang Frenchmen seems to symbolize the near equivalence of black slaves and poor whites before absolutist law. This symbolic equation served a colonial state that at ﬁrst worried more about mutinous whites (many of whom arrived as convicted laborers) than about unruly slaves. During the early period of French colonial rule in Louisiana, the punishments meted out to white and black o√enders for similar crimes were comparable. Subsequently, Louisiana witnessed two major shifts in the balance of colonial power—the ﬁrst from loyal French and Canadian administrators to a set of self-interested Creole merchant-planters in the 1740s and the second from the Creole slaveowners to a corps of lawabiding Spanish o≈cials in the 1770s. Each shift in colonial power in Louisiana was accompanied by a di√erent pattern in race and punishment exemplifying the conﬂicts and constituencies that fractured colonial rule.∞ Louis Congo appears numerous times in Louisiana’s surviving civil 62 Shannon Lee Dawdy and criminal records. It is clear that he was well known in the local community and well connected with the colonial administrators on the governing Superior Council. Following Louis Congo’s unrecorded death or retirement in the late 1730s or early 1740s, his duties fell to a shifting set of anonymous white functionaries who appear not to have had the same prominent role in the community. Paralleling this change in the role of the executioner was a signiﬁcant shift in the pattern of punishment in the 1740s to one in which public punishments for black and white o√enders began to di√erentiate and to exaggerate the di√erences between black and white bodies. This occurred during a period when contemporaries complained that the metropole had ‘‘abandoned’’ Louisiana. As a result, the Superior Council became stacked with native-born (or Creole) slaveowners who often acted in violation of metropolitan directives. The increasingly brutal exemplary punishments they meted out to slaves in New Orleans’s public square seemed designed to make black bodies appear more ‘‘savage’’ by barbaric dismemberment. Under Spanish rule (1769– 1803), the colonial state once again intervened between slaveowners and slaves, reserving the right to administer corporal punishment and meting it out with relative restraint. But when an interracial conspiracy in 1795 threatened to topple both slaveowner and imperial power, ‘‘justice’’ once again swung toward gruesome spectacle. In that year, the road from Pointe Coupée to New Orleans was lined with posts topped with the severed heads of African and Afro-Creole rebels.≤ The strategies employed under Louisiana’s French (1699–1731), Creole (1732–68), and Spanish (1769–1803) regimes reveal the tensions between two major powers in the colonial scene: imperial governments committed to maintaining territorial gains at minimal cost and major slaveowners committed to maintaining their hold over slaves and maximizing their investment. In Louisiana, ﬁrst the French and later the Spanish colonial governments used the law to insert themselves as mediators between slaveowner and enslaved in the disciplinary regime. By law, corporal punishment of slaves such as torture, severe ﬂogging, branding, mutilation, or execution could be meted out only by the state, which also intervened when owners abused their slaves. The specter of slave revolt [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-28 02:46 GMT) Savagery in Louisiana 63 and colonial rebellion haunted colonial policy long before the Haitian Revolution, and many strategies were aimed at checking the excesses of slaveowners that might provoke a coordinated reaction. In 1731, France virtually abandoned Louisiana and allowed Creole slaveowners to take the reins of power through the Louisiana Superior Council.≥ As a result, from that period until 1768 (when the Spanish once again imposed a degree of imperial control over the colony), slaveowner justice and state justice were essentially the same.
