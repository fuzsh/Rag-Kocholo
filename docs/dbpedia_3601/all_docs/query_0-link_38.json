        "text": "Everton's 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace showcased the very best of the Congolese diaspora, with Yannick Bolasie, Romelu Lukaku and Christian Benteke all playing key roles in the stalemate.\n\nWhile Bolasie, who helped the Leopards to third place at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, represents the Democratic Republic of Congo, both Lukaku and Kinshasa-born Benteke opted to play for Belgium.\n\nIn this feature, KweséESPN present a dream team of players who could play or who could have played for the DRC.\n\nWe're pretty sure that if the Leopards could call on these 11 stars, their wait for a first World Cup appearance since 1974 would be over pretty quickly!\n\nGK: Steve Mandanda - Born in Kinshasa, Mandanda opted for an international career with France, for whom he has won over two dozen caps, and was a part of Les Bleus' squad for the 2016 European Championships. His brother Parfait is currently part of the Leopards set-up.\n\nDC: Vincent Kompany - Even with his seemingly relentless injury concerns, we still reckon that DR Congo coach Florent Ibenge would love to have the Manchester City skipper available for selection. The 30-year-old has enjoyed a long international career with Belgium.\n\nDC: Marcel Tisserand - Despite being born in France, Tisserand has opted to represent the DRC at senior level, and just makes our team ahead of Jason Denayer and Presnel Kimbembe. He moved from AS Monaco to Ingolstadt during the summer, despite reported interest from Arsenal.\n\nDC: Chancel Mbemba - The centre-back may have having a testing time in England with Newcastle United, but he's a classy operator and will come good in the North East or elsewhere. A key man during the Leopards' run to the Afcon semi-final.\n\nMR: Yannick Bolasie - Another key member of the Leopards squad in Equatorial Guinea, Bolasie is arguably the national side's star man, and has begun to prove his class for Everton on a consistent basis in the Premier League, having made the move from Crystal Palace this summer.\n\nMC: Steven N'Zonzi - The powerful midfielder could still represent the DRC after having been passed over by France. There was talk of the Sevilla midfielder joining Sam Allardyce's (brief) revolution with England earlier this year, and he's demonstrated throughout his career that he adds character and grit to any team he plays for.\n\nMC: Youri Tielemans - Still only a teenager, Tielemans has already played over 100 times for Belgian giants Anderlecht, and made his Champions League debut when he was just 16. He looks destined for a long future in the heart of the Belgium midfield and has been linked with a move to Juventus.\n\nML: Paul-Jose Mpoku - Like Tielemans, Mpoku was a star of the Belgian youth teams, but opted to represent Congo at senior level when Florent Ibenge came calling in 2015. The Tottenham Hotspur academy product is a talented and versatile operator who is currently on loan at Greek giants Panathinaikos.\n\nFW: Michy Batshuayi - The poacher perhaps hasn't hit the ground running since moving to Chelsea from Marseille for £33million this summer, finding the net just once in five Premier League outings. Nonetheless, he's a lightning, lethal operator and has the quality to be a big hit in England.\n\nFW: Romelu Lukaku - One of the outstanding forwards of his generation, Lukaku has taken his time to live up to the 'New Drogba' tag after having broken through at Anderlecht, and is currently joint top of the Premier League top scorer charts with five goals in six games.\n\nFW: Christian Benteke - Benteke is still picking up the pieces of his career after a miserable spell at Liverpool, where he struggled to make his mark under Brendan Rodgers and was never to the taste of Jurgen Klopp. He's already scored three in five at Crystal Palace, and while he faces considerable competition in the Belgium set up, he should have enough to fire the Londoners clear of relegation this season.\n\nSubstitutes: Abel Tamata, Christian Kabasele, Jason Denayer, Anthony Vanden Borre, Presnel Kimbembe, Terence Kongolo, Arthur Masuaku, Luis Pedro Cavanda, Jordan Lukaku, Neeskens Kebano, Tresor Mputu, Britt Assombalonga, Dieumerci Mbokani, Cedric Bakambu, Benik Afobe."
