        "text": "The GFF supports the government of Guatemala's commitment to achieve better nutrition for all children. The country’s investment case focuses on over- and under-nutrition and includes prioritized interventions across multiple sectors — health, water and sanitation, social protection, social and behavior change, and agriculture.\n\nThe GFF is supporting a performance-based buy-down, conditioned on the achievement of results of the World Bank-financed Crecer Sano nutrition program. The GFF grant support incentivizes the government to invest more in the country’s conditional cash transfer program, which provides direct assistance to families and encourages them to seek routine health and nutrition services. Through the program, the government invested US$18 million from its national budget — double the buy-down’s amount — in the cash transfer program, reaching US$23.8 million of total investments in 2022 from only US$3.5 million in 2019. The ratio of disbursement of these funds has also improved over time, increasing from 24 percent to 99.9 percent in 2021. Correspondingly, the number of cash transfers for health and nutrition services reached more than 244,000 beneficiaries in 2021 — an increase of 548 percent since 2019."
