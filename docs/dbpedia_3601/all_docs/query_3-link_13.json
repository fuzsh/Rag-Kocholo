        "text": "Text\n\nFor many Congo Square is the site that inspires the most fantastical images of enslaved life in New Orleans. From the 1840s to the 1880s, intellectuals and artists like George Washington Cable, Louis Gottschalk, and Lafcadio Hearn brought Congo Square into national imagination as a site of exoticized, sexualized abandon. The area famed for its African drumbeats and dances, now marked in Louis Armstrong Park, became famously known as “the birthplace of jazz.” But the history associated with the actual location stands in the shadow of its mythology, one created primarily by white writers who had never even seen enslaved people there.\n\nFrom 1796 to 1803, 2800 enslaved people were baptized at St. Louis Cathedral in Jackson Square, more than 700 of them of Kongo background. Therefore it’s not a stretch to imagine that the enslaved people participating in Sunday afternoon revelry were incorporating music and dance from West Africa.\n\nBy 1817 New Orleans city laws had restricted gatherings of enslaved people to Sunday afternoons in Congo Square, then called Place Publique. Due to mounting concerns about abolitionists invading the city and the threat of revolution, Sunday afternoon music and dance was shut down in 1835, resumed, and then shut down again in 1851. By 1856, people of African descent were no longer legally allowed to play horns or drums in the city. After that the area was used primarily for military exercise. However, as was often the case in New Orleans, music and dance continued in circles of enslaved people, if hidden in secret.\n\nWhen Benjamin Latrobe, a British born architect, described the musical scenes at Place Publique (also known as Circus Square) in 1819, he got caught up in what he sees as a ‘wild’ display. The derogatory racial attitudes of the era certainly enhanced this perception, but his drawings and specific descriptions of certain dances draw a parallel with the musical life of St. Domingue.\n\nIt’s likely that many of the people who filled the square on Sundays had spent the past couple of decades evading violence first in St. Domingue and then Cuba. They brought with them bamboula drums, banjos, and propensity for using clothing and dancing to mock social mores. The contredanse, for example, mocked high society partnered dances. Along with the more often sensationalized, sexualized African dancing, the contredanse appears in the testimony of not only Latrobe in New Orleans, but also Médéric Louis Élie Moreau de Saint-Méry in Saint-Domingue only 20 years prior."
