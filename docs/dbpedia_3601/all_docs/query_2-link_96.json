        "text": "Gumbo: Ken Burns’ Jazz, Part 1\n\n(Click to see video)\n\nThe story of jazz begins in New Orleans. Here, in the 1890s, African-American artists created a new music out of ragtime syncopations, Caribbean rhythms, marching band instrumentation, and the soulful feeling of the blues. Part of the series Jazz: A Film by Ken Burns. (110 minutes, Films On Demand)\n\nPhoto from LouisArmstrongHouse.org\n\nLouis Daniel Armstrong (1901-1971)\n\nAlso known as “Satchmo” and “Pops”\n\nLouis Armstrong was born in New Orleans in 1901. He is remembered as the most influential artist in the early development of jazz. His influence, both as an artist and cultural icon, is universal and is still relevant today.\n\nCareer highlights, compiled by the Louis Armstrong House Museum: ​\n\nDeveloped a style of playing jazz, as an instrumentalist and a vocalist, that is still influencing musicians today.​​​\n\nRecorded hit songs for five decades, and his music is still heard today on television and radio and in films.​\n\nWrote two autobiographies, more than ten magazine articles, hundreds of pages of memoirs, and thousands of letters.​\n\nWas the only black jazz musician to publicly speak out against school segregation in 1957. His protest reverberated around the world and led the State Department to urge the restoration of civil rights for black Americans.​\n\nSo popular that warring sides in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa temporarily stopped fighting in 1960 to attend an Armstrong concert.​\n\nAppeared in more than thirty films (over twenty were full-length features) as a gifted actor with superb comic timing and an unabashed joy of life.​\n\nComposed dozens of songs that have become jazz standards.​\n\nPerformed an average of 300 concerts each year, with his frequent tours to all parts of the world earning him the nickname \"Ambassador Satch,\" and became one of the first great celebrities of the twentieth century.\n\nExplore these links to learn more about the amazing life of Louis Armstrong:\n\nSandmel, Ben \"Louis Armstrong\" knowlouisiana.org Encyclopedia of Louisiana.
