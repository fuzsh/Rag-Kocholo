        "text": "Involvement in the Petrobras scandal\n\nRousseff was reelected in 2014, but early in her second term a scandal exploded that involved millions of dollars in alleged kickbacks by prominent Brazilian corporations to officials of Petrobras, the country’s huge majority-state-owned oil company, and of the Workers’ Party. Dozens of high-level businesspeople and politicians were indicted as part of the widespread investigation into the scandal. In August 2015 the list of those arrested expanded to include José Dirceu, who had served as chief of staff for Lula from 2003 to 2005.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, Lula’s home was raided by the police, who then brought in the former president himself for some three hours of questioning before releasing him. Roughly a week later he was formally charged with money laundering for allegedly hiding his ownership of a seaside luxury apartment that was said to have come into his possession as a result of his ties to the OAS construction firm. Lula, who denied owning the apartment, was then named chief of staff by Rousseff, ostensibly to use his considerable clout and political acumen to help her administration survive the scandal and a growing economic crisis. Lula’s appointment was blocked, however, by a federal judge who also released a wiretapped phone conversation between Rousseff and Lula, which, it was argued, indicated that Rousseff had made the appointment to protect Lula from prosecution. As a cabinet member, the chief of staff was legally exempt from federal prosecution and could be tried only in the Supreme Court.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, calls for Rousseff’s impeachment swelled, leading to her suspension from office in May and an impeachment trial in August in which she was convicted of having used state bank funds to cover up a budget deficit in the run-up to her reelection in 2014. She was removed from office on August 31.\n\nOn September 20 the judge overseeing the investigation into the Petrobras scandal formally accepted the charges of corruption and money laundering against Lula, and he ordered the former president, his wife (Marisa Letícia Lula da Silva), and six others to stand trial. Lula once again protested his innocence, arguing that the charges were politically motivated and intended to prevent him from running for president in 2018. By 2017 Lula faced corruption charges in five separate cases related to the Petrobras scandal. In early February 2017 his wife died, having suffered a stroke in January. The trial in which she would have been a codefendant—involving the luxury apartment and OAS—began in May. Characterized as Brazil’s “trial of the century,” it kicked off with Lula giving a five-hour deposition to Judge Sérgio Moro, the towering figure who had led the “Operation Car Wash” probe into the scandal. In July Lula was found guilty of corruption and money laundering. He was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison but remained free pending appeal.\n\nLula remained at the centre of Brazilian politics while the Regional Federal Tribunal 4, an appellate court in Porto Alegre, weighed his fate. The court’s decision stood to determine not only whether Lula would be sent to prison but also whether he would be permitted to run for president in October 2018. Many Brazilians saw the possibility of another Lula presidency as a repudiation of the attempt to remove corruption from the country’s politics, but opinion polls showed Lula to hold a commanding lead over his closest potential rival for office. On January 24, 2018, the three-judge panel unanimously upheld Lula’s conviction and increased his sentence to 12 years and one month. Because his conviction had been upheld, under the Clean Record law (enacted in 2010 during Lula’s presidency), Lula was prohibited from running for public office; however, he still had the option of appealing the appellate court’s decision to the Supreme Court. Moreover, there was speculation that he would appeal the prohibition of his candidacy, arguing that preventing him from running would subvert Brazilian democracy.\n\nOn April 5 the Supreme Court voted 6–5 to deny Lula’s request to remain free while he continued to appeal his conviction, a decision that ignited two days of high political drama as Lula initially refused to turn himself in to begin his prison term. Once the Supreme Court had ruled, Judge Moro ordered Lula to surrender to authorities in Curitiba by 5:00 pm on April 6 to begin serving his prison sentence. Instead of turning himself in, Lula took refuge in the union headquarters outside São Paulo where he had begun his political career. Lula’s supporters surrounded the building, and the deadline passed without federal law enforcement officials attempting to penetrate the crowd to arrest Lula, out of fear of sparking violence.\n\nOn April 7 Lula appeared before the crowd outside and gave an impassioned speech in which he continued to protest his innocence, saying that his prosecution and conviction were politically motivated efforts to prevent him from carrying on the fight to narrow income inequality in Brazil. Stating that he believed in the rule of law, however, he announced that he would surrender, and that evening he did. After giving himself up, Lula was transported by helicopter to Curitiba to begin serving his sentence outside the general prison population, in a special cell to which he was remanded in consideration of the “dignity of the office he held.” His chances of becoming the Workers’ Party’s presidential candidate had seemingly evaporated, and the party was left without an obvious choice to replace the man who had been running well ahead of all opponents in preelection polling. When it met at its national convention in São Paulo on August 4, 2018, however, the Workers’ Party chose to nominate Lula as its candidate anyway. The party’s intention appeared to be to create so much popular support for Lula that the courts would be compelled to release him to campaign. In the wake of the Superior Electoral Court’s ruling on August 31 that Lula was “ineligible” to run for the presidency, and with the deadline for the Workers’ Party to register its candidate fast approaching, Lula announced on September 11 that he was ending his candidacy and throwing his support to his running mate, Fernando Haddad, the former mayor of São Paulo. With Lula out of the race, Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing nationalist who pledged to eliminate corruption, was swept into office in the late October runoff election against Haddad.\n\nIn early February 2019 Lula was convicted in another corruption case. This time he was sentenced to an additional 12 years and 11 months in prison for having accepted bribes from construction companies in the form of a $235,000 renovation of a country home. Lula again refuted the charges, but the presiding judge found Lula’s claim that he was not the formal owner of the house unconvincing.\n\nLula’s incarceration had brought an ongoing vigil outside the prison that became the focal point not only of “Free Lula” efforts but also of leftist activism in general. In November 2019 Lula was released from prison following a decision by the Supreme Court that overturned the Court’s earlier ruling requiring the incarceration of convicted individuals whose first appeal had been denied. The ruling meant that Lula and others would be able to continue engaging in Brazil’s extensive appeals process as free individuals."
