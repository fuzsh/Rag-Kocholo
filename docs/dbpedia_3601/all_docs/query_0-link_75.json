        "text": "Agave\n\n~\n\nIn the mountains near San Juan and San Luis del Rio near Oaxaca, we harvest EspadÃ­n agave at elevations up to 8,000 feet. We believe that elevation is key and have found the higher we go in the Sierra, the more elegant the resultant spirit.\n\nDistillation\n\n~\n\nThe crushed & roasted agave is placed in wooden vats and fermented with wild yeasts (no chemical accelerants) for 8 days. The fermented agave juice & fibers are distilled twice in copper pot stills.\n\n~\n\nWe use an enclosed flame system to cool the outsides of the condensation vats.\n\nTHE PALENQUE ðŸ¡ª"
