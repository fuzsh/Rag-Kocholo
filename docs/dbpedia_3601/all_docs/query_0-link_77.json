He founded the Katanga Foundation in Cali, Colombia whose mission is to rescue, preserve, and spread Afro-Colombian traditional music and culture.\n\nAleide Tile is widely recognized throughout the northern peninsula of La Guajira, Colombia as an important ambassador for Wayuú culture, particularly in the field of weaving. In the Wayuú territory of the Waimpiralein Uribia Jalala, region of the Guajira, Aleide and her community innovated to address the plastic waste plaguing their territory, mixing recycled plastic with the natural fibers used to weave the traditional shoulder bags their community is recognized for.\n\nAngel Marino Jacanamejoy began his career reviving traditional wooden Tsenës benches and specializing in ceremonial masks for the traditional Bëtsknaté festival or Carnival of Forgiveness. He captures the faces of Kamënts̈á Biyá men and women in his ceremonial masks, reflecting their daily lives, traditions, and customs in his art.\n\nWith over 38 years of experience, Deryam has contributed to keeping alive the tradition of the Cauca violin.

His stunningly beautiful pieces convey a symbology preserved by generations of indigenous families that represent their worldviews.\n\nJarara is a master artisan and community leader from the ancestral territory of Wayuú Pariyen. She founded the Kanaspi Artisan Association, composed of over 200 artisans from the northern peninsula of La Guajira. The goal of the association is to improve living conditions for the Wayuú people by strengthening their culture and language, and by preserving the symbolism of their art. Jarara brings this symbolism to life with the bags, hammocks, and traditional clothing she and her community create.\n\nLiliana employs the technique of blunt needle and knotting, creating shoulder bags, hammocks, table centerpieces, and jewelry with cheerful colors and mystical designs. She represents Asoarka, a non-profit organization with 300 members dedicated to strengthening the artisanal and socio-cultural fabric of the Kankuamo People of the Sierra Nevada Gonawindúa.\n\nWaidis is a young entrepreneur from the Afro-Colombian beach community of La Boquilla, in Cartagena. He is committed to preserving the cultural traditions of his African heritage through drum-making and through the teaching of percussion. He will perform with Batámbora – a drum and dance troupe parading at the Festival on second weekend.\n\nEsteban is a talented 23 year-old Afro-Colombian Fashion Designer who rose to fame by designing the garments worn by Colombian Vice President Francia Márquez. Born in Santa Bárbara de Iscuandé, Esteban was displaced by violence at the age of six. After relocating to Buenaventura, he started designing and making clothe to help support his family. Esteban African is a brand inspired by the aesthetics of the African diaspora. His “resistance fashion” celebrates the contribution of the Afro-descendants of the Pacific coast of Colombia to the regional and national identity.\n\nThis presentation was made possible with the support of USAID and ACDI/VOCA’s Indigenous Peoples and Afro-Colombian Empowerment Activity, better known as Juntanza Étnica, which continues the long-standing partnership with indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities in Colombia. Juntanza Étnica contributes to the self-determined development of ethnic communities by strengthening the institutional and advocacy capacity of ethnic organizations, and contributes to the increased participation of communities in the implementation of peace. It promotes respect for cultural heritage and diversity and supports the development of environmentally sustainable socioeconomic opportunities. It is implemented in the Caribbean, Pacific and Amazon regions of Colombia, as well as in Bogotá."
