The proportion of children varied between WHO regions, with a higher proportion of children in the African region (162 [40·6%] of 399). Lower proportions were seen in the Eastern Mediterranean region (two [3·6%] of 56), the region of the Americas (652 [1·2%] of 54 059), and the European region (87 [0·3%] of 25 512). No cases in children were reported in the South-East Asia region or the Western Pacific region. 57 women were reported as pregnant and one woman was reported as less than 6 weeks postpartum among the 2006 female cases aged 15–44 years (56 from the region of the Americas and two from the European region).\n\nHealth workers represented 1221 (5·3%) of 28 549 cases where health worker status was reported. Where information on mode of transmission was available, 32 (10·1%) of 316 reported occupational exposure: 27 while providing health care to patients and five in a clinical laboratory. The remaining health workers reported having been infected through non-occupational exposure, largely via sexual exposure.\n\nAmong 35 329 cases with known HIV status, 16 961 (48·0%) were HIV-positive. The proportion of people living with HIV was higher in the region of the Americas (12 997 [52·4%] of 24 816) than in the European region (3950 [37·8%] of 10 440). Fewer than 50 cases with known HIV status were reported in each of the other regions.\n\nThe most common symptoms reported were any rash (30 225 [82·6%] of 36 609 cases with reported symptoms), fever (21 819 [59·6%] of 36 609), skin or mucosal lesions (excluding oral and genital lesions; 19 121 [52·2%] of 36 609), genital rash (16 993 [46·4%] of 36 609), and headache (12 016 [32·8%] of 36 609). Symptom prevalence varied by age and sex ( ; appendix 3 p 6). Notably, prevalence of genital rash was lower in female cases aged 15 years and older with reported symptoms (329 [27·0%] of 1218) than male cases aged 15 years and older with reported symptoms (16 201 [47·1%] of 34 362). This prevalence was also lower for female (11 [7·0%] 157) and male cases (14 [7·3%] of 191) younger than 15 years. 438 cases with reported genital rash symptoms did not have age and sex data reported. Prevalence of genital rash varied among regions, with the lowest rates in the Eastern Mediterranean region (18 [32·1%] of 56) and highest rates in the Western Pacific region (35 [80·0%] of 44). Symptom data were extremely limited for the African region.\n\nThe most reported mode of transmission was via sexual encounter (14 941 [68·7%] of 21 749; ). Reported modes of transmission varied between regions, with sexual transmission comprising 9133 (94·0%) of 9711 likely transmission events from the European Region, 14 (93·3%) of 15 likely events from the South-East Asian region, eight (80%) of ten likely events from the Western Pacific region, 5780 (48·2%) of 12 000 likely events from the region of the Americas, and six (46%) of 13 likely events from the Eastern Mediterranean region. Reported transmission settings varied: the most common setting was in small gatherings with sexual contact such as a night club, private party, or sauna (3470 [66·3%] of 5223 settings). Other reported settings were the household (553 [10·6%] of 5223 settings) and large events (such as festivals or sport events) without sexual contact (236 [4·5%] of 5223 settings; appendix 3 p 5).\n\nTable 2\n\nContact with contaminated material (n=303)Health-care associated (n=94)Vertical transmission during pregnancy or birth (n=1)Person-to-person (n=2374)Sexual encounter (n=14 941)Animal to human (n=13)Occupational exposure*(n=9)Parenteral transmission†(n=2)Other (n=4012)Total (n=21 749)Age group0–9 years9 (19·6%)1 (2·2%)1 (2·2%)15 (32·6%)1 (2·2%)00019 (41·3%)4610–17 years5 (5·9%)2 (2·4%)013 (15·3%)31 (36·5%)00034 (40·0%)8518–29 years97 (1·6%)32 (0·5%)0611 (10·0%)3859 (63·2%)6 (0·1%)3 (<0·1%)1 (<0·1%)1497 (24·5%)610630–39 years122 (1·4%)30 (0·3%)01027 (11·4%)6183 (68·6%)6 (0·1%)3 (<0·1%)1 (<0·1%)1641 (18·2%)901340–49 years49 (1·0%)22 (0·5%)0519 (10·9%)3452 (72·8%)1 (<0·1%)1 (<0·1%)0697 (14·7%)474150–59 years17 (1·2%)3 (0·2%)0155 (11·0%)1130 (80·2%)01 (0·1%)0103 (7·3%)140960–69 years2 (0·7%)1 (0·3%)021 (7·1%)255 (85·9%)01 (0·3%)017 (5·7%)29770–79 years1 (2·6%)2 (5·1%)09 (23·1%)23 (59·0%)0004 (10·3%)39≥80 years1 (16·7%)1 (16·7%)01 (16·7%)3 (50·0%)00006Unknown0003 (42·9%)4 (57·1%)00007SexFemale39 (6·7%)30 (5·2%)1 (0·2%)94 (16·2%)232 (39·9%)04 (0·7%)0182 (31·3%)582Male262 (1·2%)64 (0·3%)02278 (10·8%)14 691 (69·5%)13 (0·1%)5 (<0·1%)2 (<0·1%)3830 (18·1%)21 145Other1 (8·3%)001 (8·3%)10 (83·3%)000012Unknown1 (10·0%)001 (10·0%)8 (80·0%)000010Sexual orientationMen who have sex with men142 (1·0%)27 (0·2%)01294 (9·4%)10 252 (74·4%)3 (<0·1%)002055 (14·9%)13 773Other111 (3·3%)43 (1·3%)0264 (7·9%)1192 (35·5%)10 (0·3%)6 (0·2%)01729 (51·5%)3355Unknown50 (1·1%)24 (0·5%)1 (<0·1%)816 (17·7%)3497 (74·7%)03 (0·1%)2 (<0·1%)228 (4·9%)4621\n\nWithin the African region, demographic characteristics varied between west Africa and central Africa (appendix 3 p 9). CRFs were available for 401 (30·8%) of 1302 cases from nine countries in total within western Africa (Benin, Ghana, Liberia, and Nigeria), central Africa (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo [Brazzaville], and the Democratic Republic of the Congo), and southern Africa (South Africa). In western Africa, there was a higher percentage of male cases than female cases (133 [68·5%] of 194 vs 61 [31·4%] of 194); overall median age of 29 years (IQR 18–37). In contrast, in central Africa, cases were younger than those reported globally or in west Africa (median age 14 years [IQR 6–29]), and had an even sex distribution (107 [53%] of 202 were male and 95 [47·0%] were female). In both west and central Africa, where cases were reported before 2022, there was a substantial increase in the number of confirmed cases in 2022 relative to previous years—in particular, Nigeria shows a steady increase of cases during the reporting period.\n\nOf the 54 117 cases globally for which information was available, 3927 (7·3%) were hospitalised. Of those, 1112 (28·3%) were for treatment, 539 (13·7%) were for isolation, and 2276 (58·0%) were for unknown reasons. 44 patients were reported as admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\nFor our risk factor analysis, the 539 cases hospitalised for isolation were not considered hospitalised. Here, when compared with those aged 15–44 years, both cases aged 65 years or older (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·54 [95% CI 1·05–2·25], p=0·026) and children aged 0–4 years had significantly increased odds to be hospitalised (aOR 2·12 [1·32–3·40], p=0·0020 ). Additionally, when compared with cases who were HIV-negative and immunocompetent, cases who were both HIV-positive and immunocompromised were found to have increased odds of hospitalisation (aOR 2·00 [1·68–2·37], p<0·0001), as were cases who were immunocompromised and HIV-negative (aOR 3·47 [1·84–6·54], p=0·0001; ). Having a reported positive HIV status alone did not increase the odds of hospitalisation (aOR 0·91 [0·71–1·16], p=0·44). However, cases with both unknown HIV and immunocompetence status had significantly increased odds to be hospitalised (aOR 1·16 [1·03–1·31], p=0·014). Finally, female cases had higher odds of hospitalisation than male cases (aOR 1·61 [1·35–1·91], p<0·0001).\n\nTable 3\n\nFrequenciesUnadjusted ORAdjusted ORNot admitted (n=50 525)Hospitalised (n=3388)OR (95% CI)p valueOR (95% CI)p valueAge group15–44 years41 657 (93·7%)2794 (6·3%)NANANANA0–4 years149 (88·0%)21 (12·0%)2·10 (1·29–3·25)0·00152·12 (1·32–3·40)0·00205–14 years214 (92·6%)17 (7·4%)1·18 (0·70–1·88)0·500·81 (0·44–1·51)0·5145–64 years8163 (94·0%)523 (6·0%)0·96 (0·87–1·05)0·350·97 (0·88–1·08)0·60≥65 years315 (91·6%)29 (8·4%)1·37 (0·92–1·97)0·101·54 (1·05–2·25)0·026Unknown27 (87·0%)4 (13·0%)2·21 (0·65–5·65)0·141·98 (0·76–5·16)0·16SexMale46 906 (93·9%)3053 (6·1%)NANANANAFemale1816 (90·7%)187 (9·3%)1·58 (1·35–1·84)<0·00011·61 (1·35–1·91)<0·0001Unknown1803 (92·4%)148 (7·6%)1·26 (1·06–1·49)0·00801·35 (1·13–1·62)0·0013HIV and immunocompromised statusHIV- and not immunosuppressed8445 (94·9%)457 (5·1%)NANANANAHIV+ and not immunosuppressed1540 (94·9%)82 (5·1%)0·98 (0·77–1·25)0·900·91 (0·71–1·16)0·44HIV- and immunosuppressed73 (86·9%)11 (13·1%)2·78 (1·39–5·06)0·00173·47 (1·84–6·54)0·0001HIV+ and immunosuppressed4387 (93·9%)287 (6·1%)1·21 (1·04–1·41)0·0142·00 (1·68–2·37)<0·0001Unknown36 080 (93·4%)2551 (6·6%)1·31 (1·18–1·45)<0·00011·16 (1·03–1·31)0·014\n\nProportionally, more pregnant women were hospitalised than non-pregnant women aged 15–44 years (12 [26·1%] of 46 vs 137 [9·2%] of 1493).\n\nIn the reporting period, 89 mpox-related deaths (crude case fatality ratio 0·1%) were reported to WHO (67 from the region of the Americas, 15 from the African region, five from the European region, one from the Eastern Mediterranean region, and one from the South-East Asian region), and case-based information was available for 30 (33·7%) of the 89 deaths. Of these 30 all were male, and 21 (84·0%) of 25 for whom sexual orientation was reported had self-identified as MSM. The median age was 30 years (IQR 27·5–40·0) and 23 (85·2%) of 27 for whom HIV status was available reported living with HIV. Almost all cases, where data were available, 22 (91·6%) of 24 were immunosuppressed, 26 (86·6%) of 30 had been admitted to hospital (20 for clinical need, five for unknown reasons, and one for isolation), and 12 (48·0%) of 25 had been admitted to ICU.\n\nAs of Sept 20, 2022, a total of 1619 MPXV genomic sequences were analysed, with a large variation between countries in the proportion of cases with available sequencing data. All documented sequences with a collection date in 2022 belong to MPXV clade IIb, mainly lineage B.1 followed by lineage A.2, except for four clade I sequences from the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( ). The 2022 outbreak sequences belonging to Clade IIb clustered with the 2018 and 2019 cases in the UK which were linked to travel from Nigeria ( ).\n\nEstimates for case trajectories by date of infection and Reff were produced for 27 countries in Europe and the Americas. The early stage of the epidemic was driven by transmission in the European Region, where countries saw relatively homogeneous trajectories (appendix 3 p 10; ). For 15 European countries for which the epidemic trajectory was modelled (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK), we estimated a peak in infections around the end of June (median June 28, 2022 [IQR June 23–July 16, 2022]) and a median peak in reported cases, by date of report, on July 16, 2022 (IQR July 9–July 30, 2022). Reff for most countries in Europe fell below 1·0 in July, 2022 (median July 9, 2022 [IQR June 30–July 22, 2022]), with the 15 European countries observing Reff of less than 1·0 by Aug 1, 2022. As of Jan 31, 2023, Reff estimates remain below 1·0 for the European region, although relatively low case counts contribute to uncertainty surrounding these estimates.\n\nThe mpox epidemic in the region of the Americas lagged behind the European region by several weeks. Trends in the region were more heterogeneous, with one country, Panama, still observing rising weekly case counts at the end of January, 2023, with a 60% increase compared with December, 2022 (40 vs 25; appendix 3 p 11; ). Additionally, as of Jan 29, 2023, the modelled growth rate was positive for Panama (1·4%), Argentina (0·7%), and Colombia (0·3%). For 12 countries for which the trajectory was modelled (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and the USA), our data suggest a median peak in new infections on Aug 23, 2022 (IQR July 29–Oct 9, 2022) and a median peak in reported cases, by date of report, on Sept 6, 2022 (IQR Aug 11–Oct 22, 2022). As of January, 2023, most countries in the region of the Americas observed relatively low case counts relative to their peaks, with the exception of Panama, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Guatemala, and El Salvador. From September to November, 2022, cases generally declined in the European and Americas regions. In the months following, community transmission continued at relatively low levels, with new clusters being reported regularly.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe 2022–23 epidemic is the largest-ever documented outbreak of mpox in terms of magnitude and geographical spread. Our results provide insights into its epidemiology and highlight features not previously documented. These insights include differences in regional trends, risk factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics among regions and settings.\n\nThis mpox outbreak, related to clade IIb MPXV and reported in mostly newly affected countries to have spread mainly among MSM, has been sustained by human-to-human transmission through sexual contact in various settings.\n\nMany reported cases show a different clinical presentation than previously documented; the clinical presentations are less severe, a smaller proportion of the cases report symptoms during the prodromal phase, the eruptive phase has been marked by more anogenital and oropharyngeal lesions, and there has been less frequent generalised rash than previously reported.16, 17 Differences in skin lesion morphology probably stem from differences in routes and intensity of exposure18—supported by our findings indicating greater frequency of genital rash in men aged 18 years and older. More research is needed to better understand whether the often different clinical presentation than documented in the past is linked to heightened surveillance and better detection, lower viral load, mode of transmission and site of virus entry, specific characteristics of the current outbreak and clade, mild disease going undetected in Africa, or a combination of these factors.17, 19\n\nAlthough detailed information on cases from the African region is limited, data on age, sex, place, and time of reporting suggest more heterogeneous transmission patterns. In the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where only clade I MPXV has been reported, cases are mainly children and young adults, almost evenly distributed by sex, clustered geographically in more rural areas,20 and without a clear epidemic pattern.16, 21 Similarly, an outbreak which began in August, 2022, linked primarily to clade I MPXV within Sudanese camps for internally displaced people and refugees, involved cases mostly in young children (data not shown). The observed difference in epidemiology between clade I and IIb cases might be attributable to a range of factors: including surveillance biases, viral, and host factors specific to areas where transmission occurs. In contrast, Nigeria has seen a rapid upsurge of cases since April, 2022, driven largely by clade IIb as confirmed by available sequence data, with an epidemiology and clinical features that more closely resemble those observed in newly affected countries. Here, cases are concentrated in urban areas and more prevalent among young males than females, and proportionally more children and women are affected than in the global outbreak.22 Cases of mpox in both women and men who report exposure through sex suggests that heterosexual transmission23 occurs as well as transmission between men.24 More data are needed to understand the epidemiological situation in the African context, the nature of human-to-human spread, as well as the fundamental role of zoonotic transmission.\n\nOur analysis highlights increased odds of hospitalisation for children younger than 5 years, adults aged 65 and older, females, and individuals immunocompromised25 due to uncontrolled HIV or other immunocompromising conditions or treatments. Independent clinical studies have also found that uncontrolled HIV infection is a risk factor for severe disease,19, 26, 27, 28 while the higher odds of hospitalisation among older individuals and female cases had not been previously described. This finding might be due to smaller sample sizes and differing demographic age groups of previous mpox disease cohorts. Observed increased odds of hospitalisation in female cases might be due to health seeking behaviour, surveillance biases, transmission modality, or intrinsic host factors. These findings need to guide clinical management, and ensure adequate care for the immunocompromised, children, and older adults.\n\nFinally, our findings reveal remarkable similarities in transmission dynamics across countries in the European region, with a uniform negative growth rate (decline in weekly case counts) reached by August, 2022.29 Transmission dynamics were more heterogeneous in the region of the Americas, reflecting the larger geographical scope and social, economic, and health-care system diversity of the region. Although assessing the effectiveness of public health interventions is beyond the scope of this Article, it is notable that declining case counts were observed in some countries before the introduction of vaccination, suggesting that other factors, such as infection induced immunity and behaviour changes in groups at risk, might have contributed to limiting transmission.30\n\nThis global analysis of the outbreak epidemiology was possible thanks to the sharing of case-based data with WHO. Nevertheless, case-based information was incomplete or not available for some countries and regions. Case-based data were not always updated so complications, hospitalisation, and ICU admission, which occurred after notification, might be under-reported and disease severity underestimated. Additionally, the focus of the outbreak among MSM might have introduced surveillance bias in identifying and testing for MPXV. Our analysis of phylogenetic data aimed to give an overview of the clades and lineages circulating in each region and further studies on virus evolution are needed to better interpret the observed variability.\n\nLike most surveillance systems, our data probably underestimate the real number of mpox infections, and fear of stigma related to sexual orientation, especially in places where same-sex relationships are not socially accepted or are punishable by law, might have accentuated this underestimation and introduced reporting biases in some settings.\n\nWhile the global outbreak is brought under control, efforts must continue to support mpox elimination and control efforts in all countries. Necessary actions include strengthening surveillance; enhancing diagnostic and genetic sequencing capacity, particularly in Africa; ensuring optimal health care and integrated sexual health and HIV prevention and care services, supporting appropriate immunisation services and advancing equitable access to vaccines and therapeutics; conducting risk communication to enhance ability to mitigate individual risk and to reduce stigma and fear; and supporting a One Health approach for outbreak investigation and research to minimise zoonotic transmission of MPXV. This event offers an opportunity to strengthen sub-national, national, regional, and global capacities and collaboration as well as invest in research and development to respond to emerging infectious disease threats."
