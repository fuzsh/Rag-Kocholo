        "text": "An Extravagant Life\n\nBy LAURENCE BERGREEN\n\nBroadway Books\n\nRead the Review\n\nPERDIDO\n\nSTREET BLUES\n\nAt the time of Louis Armstrong's birth, New Orleans, the most international, least American of cities, was a world apart--a blend of French, Spanish, Canadian, British, Caribbean, and African cultures, customs, languages, religions, and cuisines. Located near the mouth of the Mississippi, where the river is widest and the surrounding terrain the swampiest, New Orleans nestles in a bend of the river a little over a hundred miles from the Gulf of Mexico. From its secure, partially concealed location, it derived its nickname the Crescent City. Although it seems inevitable that a major port city would flourish near the mouth of the Mississippi, New Orleans is an engineering marvel: a city built on water, even beneath the water, for its original site was actually several feet below the banks of the Mississippi. Water was--and is--everywhere, not only in the river, in nearby Lake Pontchartrain, and in the Gulf, but in the swamps surrounding the city. Earlier in the city history, these swamps bred malaria and harbored alligators; they still nurture lush vegetation, and they make a mockery of belowground burials. Even today, the dead are buried in aboveground vaults, a custom that had added to the city's superstitious ambience.\n\nThe oppressive heat and humidity made the city seem to rot around the edges. Visitors were seduced by its dreamy, slow-paced atmosphere, as if New Orleans were a little chunk Europe that was unaccountably transplanted to the mouth of the Mississippi. In 1909, when Louis Armstrong was eight years old, Sir Henry Morton Stanley, the Anglo-American journalist and explorer, visited the city. He was struck by its \"soft, balmy air, with its strange scents of fermenting molasses, semibaked sugar, green coffee, pitch, Stockholm tar, brine, mess beef, rum and whiskey-drippings.\" The inhabitants seemed just as remarkable and unusual to him, for \"they had a swing of the body wholly un-English, and their facial expressions [were] different from those I had been accustomed to.\"\n\nNew Orleans was exotic, especially by the standards of white Protestant America, for the city was both predominantly Catholic and racially mixed. Founded in 1718 by Jean-Baptiste LeMoyne, New Orleans was originally a French city, in a French province, named for Philippe Duc d'Orleans, who was then the regent of France, and it was intended to protect French holdings from the British. Accordingly, the laws of the territory were not Anglo-Saxon in origin, as was the case in all other states. Instead, the laws and customs adhered to the Napoleonic code, tied to the canons of France and reaching back to the era of Roman occupation.\n\nAt first, settlers came to New Orleans in search of gold that turned out to be more mythical than actual. When that dream failed them, they turned to trading furs. At the same time, France was using the city as a dumping ground for its unwanted, especially its whores, thus planting the roots of prostitution deep into the city's culture and society. As more Europeans filtered into New Orleans, France secretly ceded the entire city to Spain in 1762; the transaction added a new cultural element to the populace. The following year, yet another group found their way to the city: Acadians seeking refuge from the British presence in Nova Scotia. Their descendants are known today as Cajuns, and their music also influenced the development of jazz in New Orleans. In 1764, the city finally learned that it had been severed from France--to which many of its respectable citizens proudly traced their ancestry--and the Spanish militia later suppressed a bloody rebellion to assert its dominance over the luxurious, sweltering city near the mouth of the Mississippi. In the following decades, the mixing and intermarrying of the French and Spanish nobility in New Orleans gave rise to a new, indigenous culture, known as Creole, and their music, a blend of French and Spanish rhythms and motifs, also contributed to the music eventually known as jazz.\n\nAs the nineteenth century opened, New Orleans prospered, and France coveted the possession it had so rashly given to the Spanish. In 1800, the French surrounded the city and took it back. The Spanish offered a minimum of resistance, but New Orleans did not remain French for long. Only three years later, Napoleon sold the city and its territorial holdings to the United States; thus President Thomas Jefferson acquired New Orleans in the Louisiana Purchase. The Creoles of New Orleans, who had established a sophisticated, insular, and idiosyncratic lifestyle based on the twin pillars of religion and sexual freedom, were aghast, believing their city and their way of life had been sold out from beneath them. They dreaded an influx of barbarous, puritanical Americans who would condemn their Roman Church and old-world sexual customs.\n\nNew Orleans was an American city at last. However, the Creoles, French, Spanish, and Acadians who preceded the American parvenus were deeply entrenched and incredibly snobbish and clannish in relation to outsiders. They had settled in the exotic \"Downtown\" section of the city, while the newcomers--many of them Yankees--flocked to an equally prosperous \"American\" neighborhood known as \"Uptown.\" When the British threatened to capture the city in 1814, General Andrew Jackson managed to raise an army of volunteers from both sides of town. In the Battle of New Orleans, January 8, 1815, the army defeated a common enemy, but the timing contained considerable irony, for the victory was won two weeks after the United States and Great Britain had signed a peace treaty, news of which had yet to reach the embattled city.\n\nFor the next forty-five years, the city flourished and luxuriated in its contradictions. New Orleans boasted the largest cotton and slave markets in the world, and because of slave labor, it emerged as the wealthiest city in the United States (on a per capita basis) in the years prior to the Civil War. Wealthy Creoles pursued their private, elegant, decadent lifestyle; enslaved blacks imported into the city supplied the labor necessary to make it all run. The races and cultures mixed occasionally, but only in ritualized ways, most importantly in the bals de Cordon Blue, usually known as the quadroon balls. (A quadroon was considered one-quarter black.) Here wealthy Creole gentlemen came in search of light-skinned black mistresses, quadroons, whom they would set up in separate households and maintain until they lost interest. These balls occurred at least four times a week in various hotels throughout the city. Except for the musicians, no black men were permitted to attend.\n\nConsidering themselves socially superior to dark-skinned blacks, quadroons and other light-skinned blacks belonged to a small, but prominent minority of free blacks in New Orleans known as gens de couleur libre, some of whom actually owned slaves themselves. Their offspring with dark skin were known as Griffes, and those with white as octoroons--one-eighth black, or even less. The octoroons and quadroons were reputed to be more sexually advanced than their white counterparts and were supposedly familiar with the full panoply of Parisian sexual practices, including whipping, fetishes, and bondage.\n\nA visiting British tourist, appalled at the quadroon balls, disdainfully recorded her impressions of the custom of keeping a quadroon mistress:\n\nThe girls are highly educated, externally, and are, probably, as beautiful and accomplished a set of women as can be found. Every young man selects one early, and establishes her in one of those pretty and peculiar houses, whole rows of which may be seen in the Ramparts. The connection now and then lasts for life; usually for several years. In the latter case, when the time comes for the gentleman to take a white wife, the dreadful news reaches his quadroon partner, either by letter entitling her to call the house and furniture her own, or by the newspaper which announces the marriage.... Every quadroon woman believes that her partner will prove an exception to the rule of desertion. Every white lady believes her husband has been an exception to the rule of seduction.\n\nThe system of maintaining a second family was widespread in New Orleans; Creoles referred to it as placage, or placement, and in practice it contained elements of both marriage and prostitution. It was, of course, inherently unstable, and the men often tired of their second families. Once expelled, many octoroon and quadroon women, without a secure place in society or a means of earning a living and accustomed to trading on their looks and sexual prowess, opened brothels. Thus the city's intricate social hierarchy only promoted what it sought to deny: a mixing of all races and cultures. It was often impossible to tell who belonged to what race, and doctors often altered birth certificates to suit a family's request.\n\nThrough such customs, New Orleans developed an international reputation for licentiousness, but its real and lasting sin lay in the crucial role the city played in the slave trade. New Orleans was the site of a dozen flourishing slave auctions. The city sought to protect its status as the slave auction center of the Western Hemisphere by seceding from the United States in 1861. The infamy lasted until 1862, when Union troops took control of the city and remained an army of occupation for fifteen years. Not until the 1880s did New Orleans begin to recover a semblance of its former self. Although its wilder excesses and wealth never returned, it remained a multiracial city, a locus of licentiousness, and home to over a quarter of a million blacks, many of them freed slaves and their descendants. They were dark-skinned blacks, looked down on by whites, Creoles, octoroons, quadroons, indeed, by anyone with skin of a lighter shade. Like other descendants of recently freed slaves, Louis Armstrong considered himself neither French nor Spanish nor Creole. He did not speak French, nor did he identify with France, as Creoles of color did. He was, as he often said, an American, even though his ancestors came to America in chains and traced their roots to Africa.\n\n... Now, if you's white, you's all right ... If you's brown, stick aroun' ... But if you's black, oh, brother, git back! ... git back! ... git back! ...\n\nPrior to the Civil War, New Orleans was relatively hospitable to Creoles of color and even some blacks. Louisiana's Code Noir, designed to govern black behavior in public, was actually more liberal than British or American customs. In fact, blacks in New Orleans had more rights than their counterparts in any other city on the American continent, even those up north. Black life flourished in New Orleans, and the focal point for blacks was the Place Congo, later Congo Square--and today called Louis Armstrong Park.\n\nCongo Square, one of the cradles of jazz, was hardly more than a field edging a swamp, where blacks, both slave and free, mingled, danced, and played their music. Even at this early date, the dances mingled African and European elements, prefiguring the mixture that would become jazz. The scene attracted many white visitors, and one left a vivid description of the astonishing energy and transforming power of the spectacle:\n\nThe favorite dances of the slaves were the Calinda, a variation of which was also used in the Voodoo ceremonies, and the dance of the Bamboula, both of which were primarily based on the primitive dances of the African jungle, but with copious borrowings from the contredanses of the French.... For the evolutions of the latter, the male dancers attached bits of tin or other metal to ribbons tied about their ankles. Thus accoutred, they pranced back and forth, leaping into the air and stamping in unison, occasionally shouting, \"Dansez Bamboula! Badoum! Badoum!\" while the women, scarcely lifting their feet from the ground, swayed their bodies from side to side and chanted an ancient song as monotonous as a dirge. Beyond the groups of dancers were the children, leaping and cavorting in imitation of their elders, so that the entire square was an almost solid mass of black bodies stamping and swaying to the rhythmic beat of the bones upon the cask, the frenzied chanting of the women, and the clanging of the pieces of metal which dangled from the ankles of the men.\n\nThe rites of Congo Square gradually became more sophisticated. The music incorporated French quadrilles and military musical motifs. The instruments evolved as well; black musicians traded their primitive, homemade drums and horns for European drums, woodwinds, and brass. They began to play the bugle and then the cornet. They played with Creole musicians, who excelled in the clarinet, the musical equivalent of a French accent. French folk songs collided with field hollers and improvised shouts of levee workers, all of this music slowly evolving into rags, shouts, stomps, rambles, and what was later called, simply, jazz.\n\nIn this relatively liberal atmosphere, the number of free blacks in New Orleans steadily increased, and by the Civil War, thousands of blacks were five or ten generations removed from Africa and slavery. No wonder they felt more American than African. Although they enjoyed considerable freedom, Louis Armstrong's ancestors didn't belong to this privileged class. They were, in stark contrast, slaves until the Civil War, raised on plantations, speaking English rather than French, with little idea of their origins and scant contact with other blacks. In the isolation imposed by slavery on plantations, they were stripped of their customs and identity, and it would be decades until they caught up with their own traditions, such as the rites in Congo Square, transplanted from Africa to America. In fact, poor blacks such as the Armstrongs had practically no official documentation of their past, or their ancestry, to which to cling. Louis was the grandson of slaves, and slaves, in general, were deprived of birth certificates, marriage licenses, and other proof of their existence. They took their masters' names as their last names, and if they showed up on records at all, it was as chattel; sometimes their names--usually just first names--appeared in bills of sale, and in inventories of holdings of the masters' estates. Under slavery, a fine piece of furniture was likely to be more fully documented than a slave.\n\nWhen Armstrong's ancestors, and other slaves like them, were finally freed, they left their plantations for New Orleans and the often frustrated hope of employment. Although they spoke English, they were frequently uneducated, illiterate. If they did find work, it was usually in the form of manual labor. Creoles of color were especially disdainful of the freed slaves, and they continued speaking French to distinguish themselves from the blacks who flocked to their own neighborhood, \"Back of Town.\" After the Civil War, this was the poorest, shabbiest part of the city, and it was here that Armstrong's grandparents settled, and his parents lived, and where he would be born and raised.\n\nDuring Reconstruction, the fortunes of all the city's blacks declined. Gens de couleur libre, who had enjoyed more liberty than blacks anywhere else, suddenly found themselves stripped of their rights. The effect was traumatic. Some migrated to South America; others managed to pass as whites. Meanwhile, Armstrong's ancestors were condemned to poverty by new legislation enforcing segregation not only in schools but in all public gathering places. In 1896, the United States Supreme Court, in its Plessy vs. Ferguson ruling, upheld a Louisiana statute calling for \"separate but equal\" railroad carriages. With that ruling, an issue that had originated several years earlier as a local matter in New Orleans became a statewide and then a national policy. Segregation spread from railroad cars to schools, places of employment, every public space and transaction imaginable. In practice, \"separate but equal\" meant very separate and very unequal facilities for blacks and whites.\n\nAt the same time, \"Jim Crow\" legislation (the name derived from an old minstrel song), which aimed to disenfranchise all people of color, spread throughout the South. The effect of Jim Crow on black voter registration was especially striking. In 1897, four years before Louis's birth, it reached a peak of 95 percent. By 1901, it was reduced to just 1 percent.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the lot of all people of color in New Orleans declined dramatically after the Civil War, and in many ways, Louis's parents and grandparents were no better off than they had been in slavery. Plessy vs. Ferguson and Jim Crow remained in effect in New Orleans, and everywhere else in the South, until the 1954 Supreme Court decision, Brown vs. Board of Education, declared the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" to be unconstitutional. For most of Louis's life, \"separate but (un)equal\" was the defining reality. For him, ever-increasing segregation meant he came into the world as an outcast, at the very bottom of the social ladder, with scant hope of resisting legislation and customs designed to keep him and his kind in a state of ignorance, poverty, and disenfranchisement. New Orleans, once a great city, was now a social and political ruin, shorn of its prosperity. To be sure, it retained its air of decadence and its peculiar combination of Creole indolence and American enterprise, but it also suffered from an increasingly poisonous relationship among races and nationalities competing for dwindling resources and shreds of former glory. This was the wonderful, dreadful, divided city that gave birth to jazz--and to Louis Armstrong.\n\nAccording to his own, cherished tradition, Louis Armstrong was an all-American jazz baby, born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on the Fourth of July 1900. He believed this to the end of his days, and so did everyone else, until a baptismal certificate confirming his actual birth date as August 4, 1901, surfaced and in the name of scholarship silenced one of the happiest legends in American popular music. Exactly three weeks after his birth, the infant was taken to Sacred Heart of Jesus Church at 139 South Lopez Street to be baptized \"according to the rite of the Roman Catholic Church.\" The baptismal card, signed by the Reverend J. M. Toohey, described Louis as \"niger, illegitimus,\" apparently because his father had by that time abandoned his mother and was living with another woman. So it was that Louis Armstrong, an illegitimate black child, was baptized into the Catholic Church. Since his grandmother, Josephine, was a practicing Catholic, she was most likely the one responsible for arranging the baptism, and the earliest religious influence over him, though limited, was largely Catholic. Although baptized as a Catholic, Louis never thought of himself as a member of the Church. He remained similarly aloof from Protestantism, the religion of his mother and other family members. Even so, he was vaguely religious, and, at times, deeply spiritual, but his approach to religious matters was always unorthodox, and he took what he wanted from Catholicism, Baptism, and Judaism, and, under his grandmother's influence, voodoo.\n\nAlthough he really was born on August 4, 1901, Louis's lifelong conviction that his birthday coincided with the Fourth of July was telling. It was the custom for poor blacks to adopt an honorary date as their birthday--often Christmas, or New Year's Day, or the Fourth of July. The year was equally flexible, depending on the vagaries of memory or legal constraints. By insisting on the Fourth of July as his birth date, Louis demonstrated his identification and his pride in a country and a region that wanted nothing to do with his kind.\n\nAt the time of Louis's birth, the Armstrongs lived in a small, single-story dwelling at 723 Jane Alley--sometimes called Jane's Alley, or James Alley. Their house was simple, but it was not a run-down, dilapidated shack. It sat squarely on a lot that was about 30 feet wide and 140 feet long, and since it had been constructed less than ten years earlier, it remained in fairly good condition. Like the adjacent homes, it was painted a pastel shade of white or yellow. There was one large shade tree in the yard in front of the house, and within, there were only two rooms. The kitchen dominated the interior. His mother, Mary Albert, whom everyone called Mayann, was just fifteen when he was born, and his father, William, known as Willie, was not yet twenty. Louis was their first child. As an adult, he recorded his impressions of his earliest years: \"When I was about four or five, still wearing dresses, I lived with my mother in Jane's Alley in a place called Brick Row--a lot of cement, rented rooms sort of like a motel.\"\n\nIn their neighborhood, he also noted, \"a row of Negroes of all characters were living in rooms which they rented and fixed up the best way that they could. We were all poor. The privies (the toilets) were out in a big yard, one side for the men and one side for the women. They were pretty good size privies. Toilets with wooden seats (holes). Also a yard of a big size.... Oh, everything happened in the Brick Row. That was the famous name for the row of houses which was made of all bricks. I remember one moonlit night a woman hollered out into the yard to her daughter. She said (real loud), `You, Marandy, you'd better come into this house, you laying out there with nothing on top of you but that thin nigger.' Marandy said, `Yassum.'\" Louis also recalled \"churchpeople, gamblers, hustlers, cheap pimps, thieves, prostitutes, and lots of children. There were bars, honkytonks, and saloons, and lots of women walking the streets for tricks to take to their `pads,' as they called their rooms.\"\n\nEven before Louis was born, his parents' relationship was fraying, and after his arrival, \"they used to quarrel something awful.\" Immediately after his birth, Willie and Mayann Armstrong separated. The cause of the breakup was simple enough: Willie had found himself another woman, and he moved in with her. From then on, Mayann became an outcast, even from her own people. She moved out of the house on Jane's Alley, leaving her two small children with their grandmother Josephine, and found herself a shanty at Liberty and Perdido streets. It would be hard to name a worse address in all of New Orleans at that time. She lived in a neighborhood filled with \"cheap prostitutes,\" the ones who couldn't afford to live in the city's designated red-light district, Storyville. There is a strong likelihood that Mayann herself turned to prostitution at this desperate moment. \"Whether my mother did any hustling, I cannot say,\" Louis writes, but he strongly suggests that Mayann became one more prostitute in a neighborhood renowned for sheltering them. \"If she was, she certainly kept it out of sight.\" Her circumspection enabled her to keep her son's love and a measure of her dignity. \"One thing, everybody from the church folks to the lowest gave her the greatest respect, and she was always glad to say hello to anybody, no matter who,\" Louis wrote. \"She held up her head at all times. Nothing excited her. What she didn't have, she did without. She never envied no one, or anything they may have. I guess I inherited that part of life from Mayann.\"\n\nWith his father gone and his mother on the streets, the infant Louis was thrown on the mercy of two very different households. Much of the time, he was sheltered by his maternal grandmother, Josephine, who cared for him lovingly. Occasionally he spent time in the house of his father's brother, Isaac, who had his own large brood to contend with and let Louis fend for himself. Because of these continual displacements, young Louis never got a clear sense of where he belonged in his family. He regarded his father, Willie, who was living with his second wife, Gertrude, as a stranger. Willie's habit of devoting all his attention to his second family, and none to him, was always a source of great pain to Louis. As for his mother, Mayann, she was an even bigger mystery to her son. No one talked about her, although he knew she was alive and living somewhere in New Orleans. \"From the time my parents separated I did not see my father again until I had grown to a pretty good size, and I did not see my Mayann for a long time either.\"\n\nIn his parents' absence, Louis's crucial first experiences in love, work, punishment, play, and white folks came while he lived with his grandmother, Josephine.\n\nJosephine clothed him, fed him, and, most importantly, loved him during those early years. \"Ever since I was a baby I have had great love for my grandmother. She spent the best of her days raising me.\"\n\nJosephine passed her days washing and ironing clothes for white folks, and it was Josephine who, through simple necessity, gave him his first lessons in the value of work. \"The only person who ever made his living sitting down was the shoemaker,\" she told him. And she gave him a nickel just to pick up and deliver her wash loads. It was enough money to make him feel rich.\n\nJosephine punished him. \"Whenever I did something she thought I ought to get a whipping for, she sent me out to get a switch from the big old Chinaball tree in her yard,\" Louis remembered. \"You have been a bad boy,\" she would tell him, \"I'm going to give you a good licking.\" His eyes filling with tears, he would reluctantly approach the tree and search its branches for the one likely to do the least damage, and when he returned to her with it, his grandmother would burst out laughing. But when she was genuinely angry, she would release weeks of pent-up frustration in a single sound thrashing.\n\nJosephine took him to school and church, occasionally with her mother, Louis's great-grandmother. Like many other blacks in Back of Town, he attended both Baptist and Catholic churches, as well as a Baptist Sunday school, and even a church choir, where he \"did a whole lot of singing\" and \"acquired my singing tactics.\"\n\nJosephine first told him about slavery days. She had been a slave, and she told Louis just enough to excite his curiosity about this unfathomable condition. In those days, she said, the blacks spoke French. And they gathered every Sunday afternoon in Congo Square to dance to African music, African drums, African rhythms. \"All the slaves came in their finest clothes,\" he recalled her telling him. \"The women mostly had on calico dresses, and their hair was bound in tight bandannas. Some colored musicians played African music, and we would dance the Bamboula or the Conjaie until we had to go back to our quarters.... One would beat the drums, another would scrape a cow's horn with a key, a third would blow into an instrument with slides, a fourth sat on his haunches and rang bells.\" The way the old lady described slavery days, they seemed to have taken place centuries ago, in biblical times, yet their remnants were everywhere to be found.\n\nLike many of her generation, Josephine was uncomfortable with blacks who rushed headlong toward freedom. \"Them that kicks over the traces too quick,\" she warned her grandson, \"forget that I have seen the days when we were slaves, when we were sold on the hoof like dumb cattle. Them that goes too fast gets nowhere. Them that shines and makes a lot of fuss in Perdido are goners. The gamblers, the drunkards, the no-good women, the pimps--they'll all be in jail before you grow a beard.\"\n\nJosephine afforded young Louis his first exposure to whites, with whom he felt comfortable enough to play. \"Days I did not have to go to school Grandmother took me with her when she had to do washing and housework for one of the white folks. While she was working I used to play games with the little white boys out in the yard. Hide-and-go-seek was one of the games we used to play, and every time we played, I was It. And every time I would hide those clever little white kids always found me.\" Louis tired of being found whenever he tried to hide, and one day he hit on the idea of concealing himself inside a layer of his grandmother's Mother Hubbard skirt as she did her wash, and for once he managed to stump his white playmates, whom he heard dashing around, frantically trying to find him, until he stuck his head out and called attention to himself.\n\nFinally, Josephine introduced the young boy to voodoo and told him of its most famous practitioner, the Queen of the Voodoos, Marie Laveau. Early one Sunday morning, she took Louis to visit Laveau's famous tomb in St. Louis Cemetery. With this visit, voodoo became part of the spiritual ambience of his youth.\n\nVoodoo in New Orleans was everywhere and nowhere. Even blacks who professed not to believe in it and regarded it as pure superstition were afraid of its spells and curses and evocations of spirits, to say nothing of its obsession with feminine powers.' Unlike Catholicism and Protestantism, which are distinctly patriarchal and unchanging, voodoo is woman-centered and constantly in flux. It is a very personalized and eclectic form of belief, aimed at righting personal wrongs and obtaining personal goals. No two priestesses practiced it in the same way; voodoo was whatever you made it. Its journey to New Orleans began nearly two hundred years earlier, with the importation of the first slaves from the West Coast of Africa, from the Fon, Yoruba, and Kongo tribes. Some of the enslaved were snake worshipers, some believed in other religions or sects, but they also believed in their spirit, Vodu. Few slaves went directly from Africa to the United States. Instead, they came by way of the Caribbean--Haiti, especially--where the enslaved tribes mixed African rites with Caribbean customs to create voodoo--a religion, cult, and culture that was ancient and new, sacred and profane, cruel and delicately nuanced. In the process, the name of the African spirit, Vodu, was gradually corrupted into \"voodoo,\" \"hoodoo,\" and other variants.\n\nVoodoo superstitions proliferated in New Orleans. When Louis was a young man, it was not unusual for blacks or Creoles in New Orleans to change their clothes frequently, lest they wear a garment to which a potion had been applied. They took similar precautions regarding the food they ate, in case it was mixed with menstrual blood. They gathered fingernail clippings and hair that fell from their heads; if these items fell into the wrong hands, they could be used to control them. They were constantly on the lookout for gris-gris--sachets containing powders or animals parts that might cast an evil spell. I don't want no black woman puttin' sugar in my tea,\" an old song about voodoo warned, \"`Cause I'm scared she might poison me.\"\n\nVoodoo, New Orleans-style, blended African, Caribbean, Catholic, and Protestant elements. It gradually incorporated Christian saints and prayers; it was not unusual to see a statue of the Virgin Mary placed prominently at voodoo altars, along with snakes and candles and desiccated animal parts. Its rites included wild dancing, animal sacrifices (chickens, especially), chants, charms, casting spells, and sexual orgies. With its strong appeal to the imagination and the emotions, voodoo became part of the inner life of New Orleans, especially among its women of color and Creoles of color. A number of important priestesses, including the famous Marie Laveau of Louis's childhood, acquired immense followings.\n\nActually, there were two claimants to the title of \"Queen of the Voodoos.\" The first Marie Laveau was born about 1800 and lived on North Rampart Street. When she was young, she worked as a hairdresser for whites and especially for Creoles, calling herself \"the widow of Paris.\" Once she became a Voodooienne, a voodoo queen, she distinguished herself by taking her rites into the open air and by claiming chat she was a Christian. Laveau drove out her rivals and became increasingly influential over the blacks of New Orleans, especially the women, who dared not disobey her edicts. During her reign, voodoo beliefs evolved to the point where many followers adopted a two-tiered structure consisting of an omnipotent God on high, and on a lower, more personal level, local spirits, or Loas, that influenced every part of life. Louis's grandmother explained that her late husband took part in voodoo rites. She boasted that he had gone with Marie Laveau to Lake Pontchartrain at night and participated in her furious, mysterious ceremonies of life and death. Louis heard about a clearing in the swamps known as Fig Place, where Marie Laveau maintained an altar, and where her followers met by night to boil potions in a cauldron under the flickering light of torches. They would toss in lizards and snakes and herbs and even a live black cat. The practice upset young Louis a great deal. Josephine also informed Louis--and everyone who believed in voodoo knew this--that Marie Laveau could even bring the dead back to life.\n\nThe reign of Marie Laveau lasted until her retirement in the 1880s, when her daughter, the second Marie Laveau, took over the title, \"Queen of the Voodoos,\" thereby becoming confused with her illustrious predecessor. The first Marie Laveau had earned the loyalty of her people with acts of charity and frequent visits to condemned prisoners and the sick. The second Marie Laveau seems to have been a much more haughty and vain priestess. To her critics, she was a madam and con artist who charged credulous clients, both black and white, small fortunes to cast spells and bring about the deaths of rivals. The second Marie Laveau was also an important personage in New Orleans, a power broker and celebrity whom the white establishment was reluctant to challenge. While she continued her reign, her mother, the founder of the voodoo dynasty, lived on in obscurity and died quietly in her eighties. She was buried in St. Louis Cemetery, and her daughter was eventually interred with her.\n\nThis was the tomb that Louis's grandmother took him to see. It is likely that Josephine, following the custom of all true believers, crossed herself with a stone used by the faithful for that purpose and marked the tomb with a red X both to placate the restless spirits within and to bring good luck--a practice that voodoo believers follow to this day. While Louis watched, she deposited a dime on the tomb, and explained that the moment they were out of sight the old Voodoo Queen herself would rise from her tomb and snatch it away. Louis had a notion to linger and watch this feat with his own eyes, but his grandmother hurried him away before grave diggers appeared as if from nowhere to brush this and many other dimes into their pockets.\n\nSome of Josephine's voodoo beliefs rubbed off on Louis. Although he was not a dedicated follower of voodoo (and men tended to fear it rather than follow it), he believed, or at least some part of him believed, that the dead could come back to life, especially during wakes. And like many other musicians in New Orleans, he brought the influence of voodoo--particularly its mesmerizing chants and its use of childish or meaningless language--to jazz. His early singing, with its uncanny intensity, sudden growls, and scatting (nonsensical chanting) reveals voodoo influences. Although Louis used these mannerisms basically for comic effect, other musicians occasionally found them alarming. They could be so compelling that when he was a rising young jazz musician some of his colleagues thought they detected a voodoo ethos about him; it was nothing they could put their finger on, exactly, just a sense that he was in touch with something deep and spiritual that spoke through him and his music, especially his singing. And when he was a young man, he looked on women with a certain awe and treated their wishes with deference. Time and again, his behavior and remarks revealed that he considered women possessed of some extra powers that men did not have, and it was best not to challenge them.\n\nWhile Louis lived contentedly with his grandmother, his parents attempted to resolve their differences. Two years after he left Mayann, Willie Armstrong returned to his wife. If she had been \"hustling\" to make ends meet while she was on her own, she ceased with the return of her husband, and they soon had a second child, a girl named Beatrice, whom everyone, including Louis, would call by her nickname, Mama Lucy. Although his parents had reunited, Louis remained with his grandmother. He expected to live indefinitely with her until a series of painful events separated him from this one anchor in his world. When he was five years old, his tightly circumscribed, stable life entered a time of convulsion.\n\nAs he returned from fetching water one day, he heard that a friend of the family, a stern middle-aged woman, had brought word that his parents had split up once again. Even worse, his mother was seriously ill and unable to care for her little girl, Mama Lucy. No one knew where Willie Armstrong was, or if he would ever return. The family friend also brought a message from Louis's mother, begging him to return and take care of her and Mama Lucy. It was a rather extraordinary request to make of a five-year-old boy, but Louis and his grandmother decided the time had come for Louis to return to his mother, sick or healthy.\n\n\"I really hate to let you out of my sight,\" Louis recalled her telling him that painful day, and he told her how sorry he was to leave. After he told his grandmother how much he loved her, the family friend took him by the hand, and as they turned the corner out of Jane Alley, the young boy stole a last glimpse of his beloved Grandmother Josephine waving good-bye to him, and he burst into tears.\n\nListen here, Louis, if you don't stop crying at once I will put you in that prison,\" said the woman taking him away to his new life, as they walked passed the House of Detention to the Tulane Avenue Trolley. \"That's where they keep bad men and women. You don't want to go there, do you?\" Still young enough to believe her threat might actually be carried out, Louis assured her that he did not, and he followed her on to the trolley. He was wearing his best clothes, a white Lord Fauntleroy suit with a Buster Brown collar.\n\nThis was an important event, his first trolley ride, but it was not the thrill it might have been, for he was stunned to see segregation in practice aboard this trolley. \"It was my first experience with Jim Crow,\" he recalled, and the practice made a searing impression on his youthful, incredulous mind, like a red-hot iron being pressed into wax:\n\nSince I was the first to get on, I walked right up to the front of the car without noticing the sign on the backs of the seats on both sides, which read: FOR WHITE PASSENGERS ONLY. Thinking the woman was following me, I sat down in one of the front seats. However, she did not join me, and when I turned to see what had happened, there was no lady. Looking all the way to the back of the car, I saw her waving to me frantically.\n\n\"Come here, boy,\" she cried. \"Sit where you belong.\"\n\nI thought she was kidding me so I stayed where I was, sort of acting cute. What did I care where she sat? Shucks, that woman came up to me and jerked me out of the seat. Quick as a flash she dragged me to the back of the car and pushed me into one of the rear seats. Then I saw the signs on the back of the seats saying: FOR COLORED PASSENGERS ONLY.\n\n\"What do those signs says?\" I asked.\n\n\"Don't ask so many questions! Shut your mouth, you little fool.\"\n\nAfter this bewildering lesson in inequality, Louis and his family friend got off the streetcar at Tulane and Liberty streets, in a crowded neighborhood strongly reminiscent of Jane Alley. They walked two blocks and entered a little shack belonging to Mayann, the mother he had scarcely known, and Mama Lucy, the sister he had never met.\n\nThe place was so simple--just a single room tucked away in an overlooked courtyard--that it occurred to young Louis for the first time that he might belong to a poor family. Even worse, his mother lay in bed with some unknown sickness, and here he was, supposed to take care of her somehow. \"Oh God, a very funny feeling came over me and I felt like I wanted to cry again.\" The \"funny feeling\" led to Louis's lifelong preoccupation with health and home remedies, some sensible and some not, to cure all types of illnesses, a practice he began to learn that day from his mother.\n\n\"Always remember when you're sick nobody ain't going to give you nothing,\" his mother admonished, \"so try to stay healthy. Even without money your health is the best thing. I want you to promise me you will take a physic at least once a week as long as you live. Will you promise?\"\n\nHe promised, and then Mayann, sick as she was, asked him to fetch a box of \"Coal Roller Pills.\" He didn't know what to make of them; they looked to him like Carter's Little Liver Pills, only they were about three times larger. Under her orders, Louis swallowed a few and said farewell to the stern woman who had brought him here. His mother then gave him a brief shopping list: meat, red beans, rice, and bread from the bakery, two loaves for a nickel. This was the Fred Staehle Bakery at 408 South Rampart, about three blocks from where he now lived, and locally renowned for selling fresh-baked bread every hour, on the hour. The odor of its baking permeated the neighborhood.\n\nHe wandered out in the street, alone in the great teeming city for the first time in his life, and headed toward Rampart Street, where the food shops were located. Along the way, he passed a group of tough-looking older boys, and when he tried to slip past them with a simple \"hello,\" one of them stopped him dead in his tracks and called him a \"mama's boy.\" This was a bully named One Eye Bud, he would later learn.\n\nOne Eye Bud spattered a handful of mud on Louis's white Lord Fauntleroy suit. \"I was young,\" he said, \"but I saw the odds were against me; if I started a fight I knew I would be licked.\" But then, without thinking, he hurled himself at One Eye Bud and \"smashed the little snot square in the mouth.\" To his amazement, he drew blood. In fact, One Eye Bud and his little gang were all so startled they turned and ran, \"with One Eye Bud in the lead.\" And little Louis, dirty and victorious after his first scrape in his neighborhood, went off to do his mother's shopping.\n\nWhen he returned, he found his mother's house filled with cousins, virtual strangers he barely remembered from his infancy. This was the Myles branch of the family: Isaac (\"Uncle Ike\"), his young wife Frances, and their children--Jeremiah (\"Jerry\"), Louise, Sarah, Flora, and Edward. From now on he would be living with them all here, in the confined space of his mother's home. The arrangement was simple: the Myles branch of the family lived on the right side of the house, while Louis, his mother, and sister occupied the left side.\n\nThe head of the family, Uncle Ike Myles, worked exhausting days as a stevedore on one of the levees. The pay was inferior, but enough to feed and clothe all the children. That night, and for many nights thereafter, Louis slept in a bed between Edward and Uncle Ike, and his baby sister was sandwiched between Louise and Sarah. The rest slept on the floor. Accustomed to his grandmother's fastidious housekeeping, Louis was shocked that the children smashed their plates to pieces instead of washing them after meals, and when the plates were destroyed, Uncle Ike fed them out of tin pans, which were never washed at all. The Myles family's crude behavior earned Louis's contempt: \"They were about as worthless as any kids I have ever seen, but we grew up together just the same.\"\n\nHis mother's recovery from her illness came as a mixed blessing for Louis, for she was now gone from the little house for days at a stretch, and when she returned, she warned him not to fall sick, because she couldn't afford the fifty cents or dollar that a visit to the doctor might cost. He felt her absence keenly.\n\nWhere did Mayann go? Did she return to her \"hustle,\" prostitution? Find work as a domestic? Live with a man? Her son had no idea, and no one told him. So he was left in a little house filled with people whom he scarcely knew, smashing plates and sharing beds. He yearned for the simple, wholesome, loving life he had led with his grandmother. In the space of a brief trolley ride, he had gone from being the center of the universe to an extraneous, unwanted element in it. Never again did he wear his spanking white Lord Fauntleroy suit or earn shiny nickels for making deliveries. When he looked back on those early days in his mother's cramped quarters, he marveled that he survived this unsupervised period of his life, far from the protection of his father, mother, or grandmother. That he did stood as proof that \"the Lord takes care of fools.\"\n\nLouis knew exactly whom to blame for his miserable lot. Not Mayann, whom he saw as a victim, but Willie, his conspicuously absent father. At least his mother returned to the one-room house from time to time, to lecture him on \"physic\" and to concoct home remedies out of the pepper grass that she collected down by the railroad tracks. But Willie never had the courtesy to appear, let alone attempt to support the two children he had with Mayann. Louis always resented his father's absence, even in old age, when he wrote, \"The man who Mayann told us was our father left us the day we were born. The next time we heard of him he had gone into an uptown neighborhood and had several other children by another woman. Whether he married the other woman, we're not sure. One thing--he did not marry Mayann. She had to struggle all by herself, bringing us up. MAMA LUCY AND I WERE BASTARDS FROM THE START.\"\n\nIn reality, Willie Armstrong was not far away. He was living at 611 South Roman Street with his wife Gertrude and at least one child, Willie Jr. He worked as a charcoal burner at a nearby turpentine factory. Despite Willie's proximity, young Louis caught fleeting glimpses of his father only in parades--\"He made the chicks swoon when he marched by as the grand marshal in the Odd Fellows Parade. I was very proud to see him in his uniform and his high hat with the beautiful streamer hanging down by his side\"--glimpses that made him ache for paternal attention and affection, but there was none to be had from Willie. Eventually Louis became so indignant over his father's lack of interest, let alone love, that he simply blanked the man out of his mind.\n\nHis father became a phantom. He could have been anyone--or no one. \"Down South the iceman was likely to be your father,\" Louis told himself. \"Or the mailman, or any mother-lover. My mother and grandmother were the people who raised me, specially my mother. She said, `Son, you got a chance. Don't waste it.'\" His father had given him nothing, not a word of advice, no legacy, no acknowledgment that he even was his father, only a lingering sense of failure, frustration, and anger. For that, the boy felt he owed the old man nothing in return.\n\nLouis's life took a turn for the better when Mayann found \"a good job working for a nice white family. She was very much relieved over it.... These people had a couple of kids. We would play hide-and-go-seek, while Mayann did her day's washing and ironing. Had a good--time every time. The Lord kept his arms around us all the time.\"\n\nNow that she was in regular attendance at home, the two of them began to form a much-delayed bond, and Louis learned to trust his young and long-suffering mother. Much of their relationship revolved around food, which became a lifelong obsession for Louis, and Mayann's idea of \"physic,\" based on a mixture of Southern and African folk remedies. He never forgot the lessons she taught him about his digestion. \"Mayann told Mama Lucy and me you must take a good purge and clean your little stomachs out thoroughly. That will keep the germs away. We both gave Mayann our word that we will stay physic-minded for the rest of our lives. Mayann would take a purge right along with the rest of us, every night before going to bed. Every morning when we went to the toilet we would all have a cleaned stomach.\" Although Mayann's advice sounds wrong-headed by modern standards, it belonged to an era when slaves and their poor descendants had little to eat but spoiled or discarded food, when there was food at all to still their hunger pangs. After ingesting potentially harmful substances, a purgative was necessary to expel toxins from the system. So Louis acquired the habit of \"staying physic-minded\" for the rest of his days.\n\nFrom Mayann, Louis heard still more about slavery and its effect on his family. Uncle Ike contributed to the discussion, but as Louis came to realize, the older generation tried to soften the harshness of slavery for his benefit. \"My mother Mayann and my Uncle Ike Myles said slavery wasn't half as bad as some of the history books would like for you to believe.\" As an adult, Louis took their assertions as evidence of their slave mentality. \"Mayann and Uncle Ike had a little touch of slavery,\" he decided, \"because their relatives before them came right up in it.\" Despite their efforts to play down the devastating nature of slavery, young Louis was aware of its insidious effects. He learned how slavery sowed hatred and envy among blacks. \"They couldn't keep a secret among themselves,\" he heard. \"They would make plans among themselves, and one Negro would double cross them by sneaking back and telling the white man everything they had planned to do. Quite naturally that would make him the head nigger.\" In sum, \"Slavery was just like anything else. B.S.\"\n\nAnd as for the callous whites who enslaved his people, \"it seemed as though the only thing that they cared about was their shotguns which they had strapped around them. So they get full of their mint juleps or that bad whiskey the poor white trash were guzzling down like water, then when they get so damn drunk until they'd go out of their minds, it's Nigger Hunting time. Any Nigger. They wouldn't give up until they would find one. From then on, Lord have mercy on the poor darkie. Then they would torture the poor darkie, as innocent as he may be. Then they would get their usual ignorant Cheshire cat laughs before they would shoot him down like a dog.\"\n\nThis was the vision of whites that Louis received from his elders, a legacy of slavery, malice, jealousy, and hate dividing the races. But it was not the legacy he would transmit.\n\nWhen he was six years old, Louis began attending the Fisk School for Boys, located at 507 South Franklin, near his house. The only educational institution he ever attended, the Fisk School was a decidedly separate and unequal facility, but nonetheless quite remarkable. It was indelibly identified with its head, Arthur P. Williams, a strict disciplinarian. (Williams's wife ran the Fisk School for Girls, right next door.) Louis learned to read and write at Fisk, and he probably gained his first exposure to music there. Music was an integral part of Fisk; the school boasted choirs, staged operettas, and several distinguished Creole musicians taught there. Despite this potentially stimulating environment, school never really engaged young Louis, and he was often absent.\n\nWhen not in school, Louis passed his days in hazardous barefoot play on the streets. \"In our neighborhood there were always a number of houses being torn down or built and they were full of such rubbish as tin cans, nails, boards, broken bottles and window panes. We used to play in these houses, and one of the games we played was War,\" he said. \"One Eye Bud made himself General of the Army. Then he made me Sergeant-at-Arms. When I asked him what I had to do he told me that whenever a man was wounded I had to go out on the battlefield and lead him off.\"\n\nDischarging his orders, Louis was knocked out cold by a piece of slate falling from a roof. \"When I was taken home Mama Lucy and Mayann worked frantically boiling up herbs and roots which they applied to my head.\" They put him to bed, gave him another dose of \"physic,\" and he \"sweated out good all night long.\" In the morning, Louis felt well enough to go to school \"just as though nothing had happened.\"\n\nAs the incident and his speedy recovery suggest, he had learned to love and trust his errant but well-meaning mother and to abide by the homespun lessons she taught him. He had always tried to see the good in people, he said, because that is how his mother taught him. To illustrate her point, she told him a story he always remembered. One Sunday, she said, a strange minister substituted for the church's beloved preacher, Reverend Cozy. But the congregation didn't take to the stranger, except for one sister, who appeared to enjoy the substitute just as much, if not more, than the regular preacher. As soon as the service ended, members of the congregation asked her why she enjoyed the substitute so much. \"Whenever our Reverend Cozy was preaching,\" she said, \"I looked right straight through him and saw Jesus. When the substitute preacher was preaching, sure, I realized that he wasn't as good as our own pastor, so [I] just looked over him and saw Jesus just the same.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Mayann told her son, \"That's the only way I've wanted to be, just like that sister.\"\n\nAnd that was how Louis wanted to be.\n\n(C) 1997 Laurence Bergreen All rights reserved.
