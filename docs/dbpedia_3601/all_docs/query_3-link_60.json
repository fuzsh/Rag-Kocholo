        "text": "Playgrounds: No\n\nAdditional Information: In a city famous for its musical traditions, perhaps no other single location claims as much musical and cultural history and importance as Louis Armstrong. Located at 701 N. Rampart Street on the edge of the French Quarter, the park is dedicated to one of the City’s most celebrated native sons and to the tradition of jazz in the City. The park is located in the Tremé neighborhood, birthplace of many of New Orleans' most famous jazz musicians.\n\nWithin the park confines is historic Congo Square. Formerly known as Place de Negres, it took its name from the tradition of slaves who gathered there on Sundays, their day off, to sing, beat drums, sell home-made goods, and celebrate. The park annually hosts Martin Luther King Day celebrations, Red Dress Run, weddings, festivals, concerts, filming, and more."
