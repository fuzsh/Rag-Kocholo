        "text": "Thunder have visited the headquarters of Air Ambulance Charity Kent Surrey Sussex (KSS) in Redhill almost two years after they helped save frontman Danny Bowes’ life.\n\nBack in August 2022, Danny Bowes suffered a bleed on his brain and fell down some stairs, fracturing his skull. Once flown to hospital he had surgery and went through a long list of associated complications.\n\nSince then, Danny has been undergoing intense rehab and physio, and in February 2023 he returned to Planet Rock’s airwaves with his much-loved Sunday morning show.\n\nAfter the initial incident, Thunder fans and Planet Rock listeners very generously donated to a crowdfunder to help pay for his specialist rehab.\n\nThe estimated fund target was exceeded swiftly, so Thunder made a pledge to make a donation, once the time felt right, using any overage to KSS.\n\nIn March 2024, Thunder made the promised donation to KSS, and they have now visited the charity’s headquarters to thank them in person.\n\nSharing a video montage of their visit, Thunder’s Danny Bowes said in a social media post: “Following the band's donation back in March, the nice people at KSS recently invited the band to their HQ in Redhill, where the band got close up and personal with one of their helicopters, their Rapid Response SUVs, and a mini tractor!\n\n“As you may recall the band's donation came from the monies Thunder fans contributed towards Danny's rehab fund after his stroke and subsequent fall. KSS attended to him on the night of his \"incident\", and their speedy actions almost certainly helped keep him alive.\n\n“The band felt any unused money should be donated to KSS, as their work is vital, and hardly any of their funding comes from the government.\n\n“So on behalf of the band and all of us here, we salute you, KSS, and of course the paramedics.”\n\nThunder’s Danny Bowes and Luke Morley are the special guests at the Curry Night at Planet Rockstock, Trecco Bay on Wednesday 27th November. Just six tickets remain, and you can get them RIGHT HERE.\n\nYou can listen to Danny Bowes' Planet Rock show every Sunday morning from 10am.\n\nThe real locations of 21 rock album covers, including Thunder's 'All the Right Noises':\n\nListen to Planet Rock on DAB nationwide, on our Rayo app, online or via your smart speaker (“Play Planet Rock”)."
