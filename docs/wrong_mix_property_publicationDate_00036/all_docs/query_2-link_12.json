Title card: The Interview. (3:02)\n\nThe opening was nature. Now? Humans tend to not think of themselves as part of nature. Instead they are in opposition to it, and, at best, sometimes enjoy its pleasanter, friendlier aspects. This is one of the things that the Interview makes a focus, the battle of humans and the lodge against nature.\n\n10 Tracking shot of Jack through the lobby. (3:05)\n\nWe open with the lobby. There is no music, only the ambient sounds of general activity.\n\nAt no time until near the film's end do we, from the interior of the Overlook, directly observe characters exiting or entering the lodge, and never from the lobby. Not even now. We see characters going to the doors to exit, and entering from the direction of the main doors, but never do we see them actually going in and out of them. Jack has already just entered the lodge as the scene opens, we do not see him come up to the lodge from his car, as another director might have chosen to show. We assume Jack has made the trip up in the yellow VW but we didn't see him in it. Though Kubrick did in the opening section associate Jack with the VW, having his name in the credits pass over the VW as the helicopter zoomed in on the auto, we are only working on an assumption, at this point, that the VW in the opening has anything to do with Jack.\n\nThe Montana mountains and the road shown in the opening, which I've discussed in that section, I think are likely chosen not just for their beauty but for Montana being known as the land of Shining Mountains. The exterior of the lodge is, however, the Timberline at Mt. Hood in Oregon. Now we have yet a third location associated, the interiors of the lobby and the Colorado Lounge modeled after the Ahwahnee Hotel in the Yosemite National Park in California.\n\nCertainly, if one takes a look around the web at the Ahwahnee, one easily understands why Kubrick would have chosen the striking hotel in Yosemite as an influence for the lodge's interior. But what if we look at the name? Yosemite Nature Notes, published in 1978, discusses how Yosemite, rather than being a corruption of a Miwok word which meant grizzly bear, instead translates as \"they are killers\", an identification not used by the Yosemite themselves but by neighboring tribes. As for Ahwahnee, it may possibly mean \"place of the big mouth\", which, no matter the original meaning, may remind of Danny's open mouth silent scream. Miwok speakers also postulate that it's a term for the Yosemite people and may instead be akin to \"place you go and play games\". This information was ostensibly available to Kubrick and if he was aware of it there's the chance it could have influenced his decision to connect the Overlook with the Ahwahnee of Yosemite for reasons other than design. I'm not at all married to the idea, just proposing it. More significantly, as John Fell Ryan points out in his post The Stanley Hotels, the places Kubrick chose as influences for the interiors and exteriors of the lodge in one way or another appear to double names used in the film or Kubrick's own, such as the exteriors of Ahwahnee and the Timberline having being designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood. The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park Colorado, upon which Stephen King based his book, was built instead by Freelan Oscar Stanley.\n\nThere are distinct differences between the Ahwahnee and the Overlook but undoubtedly the Ahwahnee and the Overlook are siblings.\n\nThe lobby of the film's Overlook is an antique white and has square terracotta color columns, dark brown wainscoting and floors decorated with a variety of American Indian derivative designs with tessellated borders that seem a mix of influences.\n\nFig. 1 - The Ahwahnee lobby, a Creative Commons image by J. W. Kern\n\nThe above 2013 Creative Commons image, by the photographer J. W. Kern, shows how much Kubrick took architecturally and design-wise from the Ahwahnee. The color of the pillars is no longer what it was when the film was made, but the trim appears to be the same as in older photos.\n\nJ. W. Kern has a beautiful page with more photos at his blog, the Golden Sieve.\n\nFig. 2 - The Ahwahnee lobby, a Creative Commons image by Dave Ciskowsi\n\nAnother Creative Commons image from Flickr, this one by Dave Ciskowsi, shows how similar in color scheme the film's Overlook was to a more vintage Ahwahnee, if the 2005 image shows color even remotely similar to earlier years.\n\nKubrick borrowed from the Ahwahnee, with alterations, what is the receptionist and cashier area in the film. We see how the chandeliers and the designs on the film's floor of the Overlook lobby may not duplicate the Ahwahnee's designs but are in the spirit of them. At the Ahwahnee, and in the film's lodge, the columns are painted at the top with borders of a repetitive design, the Overlook's being different from the Ahwahnee.\n\nMy first thought on the designs at the height of these columns in the film had been to wonder if we might have somewhere in the Overlook the Greek Key, a meander border which was associated with the labyrinth, which would befit the maze (which we have yet to see), the Greek Key composed in such a way that when enlarged it formed a labyrinth. Such a design was used also by the Hopi.\n\nKubrick used the Greek Key design in Lolita, it circling the area in which was the ping-pong table in the mansion at which Quilty was staying when Humbert finds and executes him at the film's beginning.\n\nFig. 3 - Kubrick's use of the Greek key at the beginning and end of \"Lolita\", initiating the execution of Quilty from it. Humbert's position on the stairs reminds of Jack's pursuit of Wendy up the great staircase in the Colorado Lounge in \"The Shining\", Humbert climbing these stairs in \"Lolita\" as he gunned down Quilty.\n\nThe decoration at the height of the lobby's columns in The Shining is done in a Z shape. The embellishments employed by Kubrick are in many places not the same as at the Ahwahnee, such as at the tops of these columns. \"Shining\" is later compared with sleep, that it can be like sleeping and upon waking not remembering everything one is told, and Z's are sometimes used for expressing sleep, such as in cartoons, but I also think of how the opening scene was accompanied by music signifying Judgment Day, and that Z is the final letter in the English alphabet, zeta, though it is the 6th letter of the Greek alphabet (value 7), based on the Phoenician zayin.\n\nJust mulling here, throwing out some ideas on how Z can be interpreted symbolically if one wonders if there is some meaning behind Kubrick changing the design.\n\nA zigzag pattern also can represent lightning, and some believe that the labrys, upon which is based the labyrinth, may symbolize lightning. If this is so then Kubrick may have used the Z pattern to represent the labrys axe and maze. When Jack axes Dick, he emerges from concealment behind one of the columns, blended with it.\n\nOne may think, \"Oh, it's just decoration,\" but sets are not accidental. Environments annotate and propel the story forward; there is no small detail that can be taken as insignificant with Kubrick.\n\nThe building is fairly old, we learn later it was built about 70 years prior. There are radiant heaters in this section. In the lobby of the Overlook, as the film opens, a few people rest in armchairs reading, talking, but the lodge isn't exactly a buzzing hive of activity. At least, to the best of my memory, that's how I perceived it upon first view when the movie was released. Though the lobby was undeniably impressive, the furnishings seemed wearied to me, and the guests observed didn't suggest a well-rounded representation of various age groups. As they were older, no families or children observed, and were served by youth, the lodge seemed to be a place of rest and relaxation for retirees.\n\nWe will later realize that the lobby in no way is feasible in respect of either the Timberline exterior shots of the lodge or the studio exterior shots of the lodge, which will be the case also with the Colorado Lounge and other rooms as well.\n\nAs for the radiant heat, the fact that the hotel used a boiler was of primary importance in King's book. The radiant heat, powered by a boiler, isn't of so much importance here, yet Kubrick has rigged it so the Overlook has both radiant heat and forced air heat. The Colorado Lounge section and the halls associated with Room 237 only use forced air heat. The lobby, with its radiators, aappears to be dependent on radiant heat. What is peculiar is that we see in this shot that both the radiant heaters to the right and left of the door leading into the \"Gold Room hall\" off the lobby also have forced air vents behind them. Go figure. This area seems not to be dependent on radiant heat any longer for there isn't radiant heat in Ullman's office. There isn't radiant heat in the Gold Room or the red bathroom. The apartment in which the Torrances will stay does have radiant heat, as do a couple of the older halls.\n\nNow, looking at the Timberline lodge in Oregon, at its entrance it shows a compass but with directional notation, whereas the compass points at the entrance of the Overlook don't show this.\n\nCompass in the Timberline entrance\n\nBelow is the massive stone fireplace in the lobby of the Timberline. The sense of it as a spoke for a kind of wheel is an incredible weight of great force.\n\nTimberline lobby entrance\n\nSo when we are looking at the Overlook from the aerial view, this is what informs the pyramidal structure of the lobby, yet Kubrick has stripped it out of the film as far as the set interior, preferring instead to have no fireplace at all in the lobby of the Overlook, patterning its appearance after the lodge at Yosemite. I would, however, suggest the weight of this wheel is still there, just unseen, represented in the couple of wheel designs on the floor, in particular the wheel upon which Dick is slain, which also figures strongly in the scene of Danny's Big Wheel in the lobby resting upon it as Jack explores the indoor maze.\n\nIt is important that Kubrick chose the Timberline to represent the exterior, its structural design informing the hotel. Not only is the Overlook positioned on a kind of E/W dividing line (as described in the Opening analysis) it has also a world wheel heart powering it.\n\nIn A Clockwork Orange, when Alex is imprisoned, during prison exercises he is shown walking an almost relentless circle beneath the figure of a pyramid, and following that scene we go to his interview with the prison governor which has close parallels to Jack's interview with Ullman.\n\nReturn to the top of the page\n\nA NOTE ON 8 and 1/2\n\nFig. 4 - Jack enters the lobby.\n\nJack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) enters, his gray suit appearing cheap, limp and out of place with the resort attire of the others. He stands out, fitting in neither as a lodger nor as a hotel employee.\n\nOne salt and pepper gray-haired man in a plaid jacket and two-toned spectator shoes is prominent, reading near the entrance, smoking what may be a cigar, a drink to his side next a camera. The \"spectator\" shoes in combination with the camera is an interesting choice of attire for this opening shot. To my eye he looks like Marcello Mastroianni, and, with his camera, I've thought of him as perhaps being a reference to Fellini's 8 and 1/2 in which Marcello starred, playing, in effect, Fellini. The comparison isn't too far fetched when one considers that Jack suffers from writer's block and the director in 8 and 1/2 was suffering from a creative block and musing on his life and its relationship to his work, his imaginings mingling with reality.\n\nFig. 5 - Mastroianni as he appeared in \"8 and 1/2\".\n\nBut the reference to 8 and 1/2 is more than this. It takes us also to the last day of the The Shining, its two episodes simply titled \"8\" and \"4\". 4 is 1/2 of 8. Thus, 8 and 1/2.\n\nReturn to the top of the page\n\nOUR FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE GOLD ROOM HALL AND THE MAZE - HOW FLOW OF ACTION ABOUT THE SET UNCONSCIOUSLY CONSTRUCTS FOR THE AUDIENCE A PLOT OF THE UNSEEN ENVIRONMENT BASED ON NATURAL EXPECTATIONS\n\nWe will later observe compass points on a map of the maze outside on a board beside the maze. One will note that in the lobby, at the entrance, is a design which has arrows, one pointing toward the door and one pointing away. One would assume it would be like a compass and have four arrows, but we will later observe it only has these two.\n\nJack first looks to the left, in the direction of the hall in which, at the end of the film, we will see the famous photo that reveals Jack as present at the lodge in 1921.\n\nWe've no music. This is a pretty austere scene, shot so that it seems very straightforward. Most everyone who has come to see the film knows that Jack is here for a job interview and will become a caretaker for the Overlook and that this is a horror film. But there's nothing spooky about the lobby. Everything is shot so that anyone who has ever gone in to interview for a job will feel the cool banality of the situation and the pedestrian but anxious experience of how to relate with and put your best foot forward for this new sub-group of humanity with which you've just come into contact.\n\nFour people are seated in an area on the screen right side of the main door. A man, reading, speaks with a blond woman in white. Opposite them sit two older women. As Jack approaches the lobby's reception desk, the woman in white turns. She isn't looking at Jack, as he's not in her line of sight. She seems to be looking toward the reception desk, but then a bellhop appears from the direction of the service hall behind the lobby and appears to port a silver lunch service to this group who are in the same area where Jack will himself have lunch on Closing Day.\n\nNext, two young individuals in summery clothing pass by on their way outside, carrying tennis rackets and white balls, seemingly headed to play a game though we may notice the woman is inappropriately dressed in high heels. We see beyond them the sign \"The Gold Room\" which is to the right of double doors (only in the opening and closing scenes is this sign to the right), these double doors framed with gold drapes and leading to a hall with walls and doors in the same design as the lobby but which has red sofas and will be later observed to have the Gold Room carpet. Beyond the double doors to this hall, presently closed, are a man and a woman whose positioning conveniently conceals the place where is the aforementioned photograph that will only be revealed at film's end. Throughout the film, when action occurs in this hall, the camera stops short of revealing the area where the photograph is. Only toward the end, when Dick enters the hall previous his fatal confrontation with Jack, will the camera finally reveal briefly the area where the photo in question will be seen at film's end, and we'll observe that the photo in question isn't there.\n\nThese two individuals who are supposedly on their way to play tennis come from the direction of the service hall behind the lobby rather than from the stairs or elevators. Patterns of movement of individuals about the set one would think would be in keeping with their status, such as guests would normally come and go from guest areas, and the audience does naturally anticipate and assume this and thus will naturally, unconsciously, believe that the guests must be coming from, say, elevators that will lead to their rooms. The audience members are already building in their minds a plot for the hotel, and so they've every reason to assume that these characters are coming from something such as an elevator that accesses the guest areas. As the film unfolds, the staging one will eventually view back in that area will appear at first glance to have elevators, but on closer inspection the elevators will be revealed as bathrooms. There is no guest area concourse back here, instead only service halls for employees. As the guests tend to be older, it seems possible these two are also employees.\n\nThe heels lend a sense of the surreal--as if one has entered an area that purports to be \"real\" but there slip through bits and pieces that make one feel the reality is staged.\n\nBuilding a plot of the unseen environment based on natural expectations is difficult to impossible in The Shining. Kubrick takes care to unveil the lodge only a little at a time, it unfolding over the entirety of the film, and the audience's natural expectations are proven false at every turn, but so deeply embedded is the assumption that the environment will be rational that the audience rarely notices that their assumptions are wrong and the map they're constructed in their minds of the hotel, based on what Kubrick has shown them, is impossible. Kubrick does not do this only in The Shining. The same happens with environments in Lolita and Eyes Wide Shut, as I've pointed out in my analyses of them, but Kubrick's skewing the sets so they aren't what they appear to be services The Shining well with its introduction of a sinister aspect.\n\nJack's action at this point mirrors what the audience is already unconsciously doing, surveying the lay of the land and constructing a mental map. He approaches a clerk at the registration desk for direction. She is homogeneously dressed in a shirt of a similar color to the terra cotta columns and a plaid vest that resembles the plaid jacket worn by the man with spectator shoes.\n\nJACK: Hi, I've got an appointment with Mr. Ullman. My name is Jack Torrance.\n\nRECEPTIONIST: His office is the first door on the left.\n\nJACK: Thank you.\n\nDirecting Jack to Ullman's office, she points him to the \"first door on the left\".\n\nFig. 6 - The tennis players.\n\nAs Jack continues on through the lobby, Kubrick gives us a brief glance again of the group by the door, to whom we'd believed the waiter had been carrying lunch. We don't see the waiter. The silver service he was carrying isn't on the table between the man and the blond woman, nor do we see it with the two older women. There is something on a table near them, but this was already there before the waiter approached, so the only table on which he could have placed his tray was between the blond and the man. But it's not there. Where has he gone? There is no door in that area through which he could have passed for the doors to the hall beyond are blocked by seating and if there did happen to be doors to an exterior patio (which there are not) he hasn't the time to exit them. He could only be somewhere out of sight behind the pillar that partially covers the man's chair.\n\nSpooks? No, Kubrick is actually already setting up the scene of Danny's encounter with the eerie girls in the blue flowered hall, as well as Dick's murder, making a vocabulary of motifs that will connect them, which is why I bother with pointing out what seems a petty detail. I will come to how this works with Dick's murder in a moment, and explore the connection with the girls later.\n\nFig. 7 - Kubrick briefly revisits the group by the door though he need not have.\n\nThe camera then gives us a view of a grouping of seats about a television set and a second grouping of seats beside a sign in the background that is difficult to distinguish here but reads \"Camera Walk\". We shall later see the same sign in the Colorado Lounge entry and be given a better view of it.\n\nIs the man with the camera ostensibly there for a \"camera walk\"? Is he a guest or an employee who would lead the camera walk?\n\nFig. 8 - The Camera Walk sign.\n\nThe camera continually takes in new information on the hotel, just as Jack does.\n\nAs Jack makes his way to the office he now glances in the direction of a model of the hotel's maze that is beyond the two groupings of seats. We have no idea yet where this maze might be, but one assumes the inspiration for the model is somewhere on the grounds, even though our previous aerial view had shown no maze to the front or rear. Though we may not even be aware yet that what we're seeing is a model of the maze, that we're first introduced to the idea of the maze within the lodge comments on the lodge itself, which, as discussed above, if we compare our assumptions to its reality, is irrational and nonsensical at nearly every turn. That doesn't mean the maze is itself irrational and nonsensical. If one gets a full overview of a maze one might see at a glance its patterns and logic, but when one is immersed in the maze, one's knowledge of the \"beyond\" limited by the towering hedge walls, it is easy to become lost.\n\nReturn to the top of the page\n\nFORESHADOWING, JACK CROSSES THE CIRCLE WHERE DICK WILL LATER LIE SLAIN - HOW AMBIENT AUDIO UNCONSCIOUSLY CONSTRUCTS AND COMPLEMENTS ENVIRONMENT\n\nJack has glanced in the direction of a model of the hotel's maze as he crossed the circle upon which Dick will later fall when he is murdered by Jack, who will have been hiding in the lobby behind a pillar. The waiter and his silver service just disappearing from sight, perhaps behind a pillar, seems to be a foreshadowing of this. He would not be so completely hidden by the pillar, with his tray, had this not been staged.\n\nJust a step beyond the circle, Jack's glance moves up to the stairs on the right, briefly meeting that of a hotel employee who is coming down the steps. This is the stairway Jack will, in the \"4 pm\" section, use on his approach to the lobby in the scene where he murders Dick. As his glance meets the woman's, he crosses the spot where Dick will be standing when Jack leaps out from behind the nearby pillar and kills him.\n\nAt the same time we are taking in an elevator beyond, before which stands a man who carries a wrapped pole of sort, perhaps a fishing pole as he carries a hat that is typically used for fishing. We can tell he's a new arrival as the red-coated valet behind him is porting his bags.\n\nTwo other things happen as Dick crosses this fatal spot. An elder man in light clothing has entered the area before the elevators from the hall beyond. This same man will later be seen examining the maze.\n\n(3:27 crossing into 3:28) The second thing that happens is a subtle audio cue. We hear a brief, staccato voicing of \"sha\" which, at this point, we take as being part of the natural ambient noise of the lodge. I will write more about this voicing later. It's enough now to note that it has meaning, expanding in some way on the action which will later occur on this spot, action which is already being anticipated.\n\nThe timing of the first \"sha\" begins at 327, a permutation of 237, the number of the dreaded hotel room that Dick warns Danny away from.\n\nEven if the \"sha\" occurring at 3:27 is purely coincidental, the choreography for the remaining collection of incidentals all falling on the same note is tricky, intentional, and beautifully accomplished.\n\nFig. 9 - Jack crosses the spot where he will later kill Dick, leaping out from behind the pillar on the right.\n\nJack enters the office area of the General Manager, only a corner of a secretary's desk viewed on the left, but, speaking of ambient noise again, though we don't see a secretary typing away, we assume she is there because we hear the clackety-clack of a typewriter. At the same time, we see a door in the right wall leading to Mr. Ullman's office and catch a glimpse through it of another door that leads to the back service hall.\n\nReturn to the top of the page\n\nTHE IMPOSSIBLE WINDOW\n\nThe wall right of the office door in the secretarial area is decorated with photos of the mountain as it appears over the span of the four seasons, only the snow-blanketed winter photo apparently showing the Overlook/Timberline lodge. All the views show Mount Hood's south flank. The autumnal photo presents Mount Hood in context with Mirror Lake, which the viewer may associate with St. Mary lake seen in the opening shot of the movie, that mirrored the landscape. The autumnal photo in particular will seem to, as the movie progresses, give an eerie sense of the lodge's mountain being watched from afar. Later, a painting above the double bed in the apartment used by the Torrances will provide a view of the lodge's mountain from a similar vantage point, only from across Mirror Lake during either spring or summer.\n\nKubrick would have appreciated the presence of a Mirror Lake at Mount Hood considering his interest in doublings. He may have even viewed the Overlook as a mirror or double of sorts.\n\nFig. 10 - Jack enters the secretary's office.\n\nBelow is the Timberline reception desk with a picture of the lodge overhanging.\n\nTimberline reception desk with picture of lodge\n\nOn the left is a print that seems out of place with the hotel's decorative scheme. Of a person against a red background, it may look Mayan or Aztec influenced if one doesn't know its provenance. After many years of wondering about this painting, and a loon painting in the same secretarial area but on an opposing wall, obviously done by the same artist, I've been apprised by Ioway artist, Lance Foster, the art is by Norval Morrisseau. He directs me to this excellent bio that relates...\n\nMorrisseau was assimilating and generating the content and direction of his vision. Everything was grist for his artistic mill. He recalled the black lines that held the glass pictures in form in the church windows. He recalled the side-vision of the Mayan friezes in the books he had read. The bright and harsh colours of Northern Ontario were as familiar to him as Autumn. He extended the written language of the pictographic language into a visual pattern as well as conduit of meaning. Included in Morrisseau's purpose was to portray his people as large, important, commanding and powerful. His purpose was nothing less than resurrecting the culture of the Anishnabe.\n\nMorrisseau knew what all hunting and gathering people knew with their immediate contact with the preparation of game, that the exterior of the shape showed only the corporeal, but the inner, x-ray view of the structure revealed the spirit. From Siberia to Norway, to the Arctic, the spiritual content of the living object was shown by a technique that can only be called, x-ray vision.\n\nIt's easy to see why Kubrick would have been interested in his art.\n\nFig. 11 - Morrisseau's \"The Great Mother\".\n\nThe name of the piece observed outside Ulmann's door is \"The Great Mother\". The painting seen behind Watson as he enters Ullman's office is \"Flock of Loons\". \"Flock of Loons\" is also seen near the secondary exit/entrance Wendy and Jack use to exit the lodge toward the end of the film. Why is a print of this painting placed in two places of the lodge? What connects the secretarial area with the exit? I can't say.\n\n\"The Great Mother\" painting is a shock of energy in contrast to the subdued earth tones of the lobby and its ornamentation, as well as the photographs on the other side of the entrance to Ullman's office, seeming to exhibit a sensibility and knowledge of the world quite apart from the photos and the tepid lodge and the well-behaved humans wandering about it engaging quietly with each other. The picture is an x-ray of a quite different interior world.\n\nAround the hotel we will see prints of pastels of indigenous children by Dorothy Oxborough. Is \"The Great Mother\" intended to be their mother?\n\nThe painting may refer to Wendy, who is often aligned with American Indian elements in the film. The hair style of the Great Mother can be compared to Wendy's three tiered haircut, which is less obvious in some scenes than others. When her hair is pulled back we observe that she has not only bangs but that a portion of hair is cut about chin level. Does \"The Great Mother\" hold what Kubrick might mean to register as a club, foretelling Wendy with the bat? \"The Great Mother\" is vibrant, communicating a ferocious strength, in contrast to Mary as the great mother in Christianity and her passively suffering the sacrifice of her son.\n\nFig. 12 - A hairstyle typical of Wendy. This is from the Tuesday section.\n\nLooking at the filing cabinet again, it appears there is a small elephant resting on it before a postal weight scale.\n\nMr. Ullman's door is open revealing, in contrast to the lodge's general appearance, a more modern, though unimposing, salmon-pink room unpleasantly illuminated with several ceiling florescent lights and most prominently decorated with two high shelves on either wall holding potted plants. Two brown leather chairs face a large brown desk situated before a bright window on the sill of which appears to be a wood carving of an eagle or other predatory bird. A large map is on the left wall behind a two-way radio. On the right wall are immediately noticeable a number of honorific plaques and documents. We've the same feeling of symmetry here that will be found in the halls and the Colorado Room.\n\nJACK (knocking): Mr. Ullman?\n\nSTUART (removing glasses): Yes?\n\nJACK: I'm Jack Torrance.\n\nSTUART: Oh, well, come on in, Jack. Very nice to meet you.\n\nMr. Ullman (Barry Nelson) welcomes Jack pleasantly, rising and shaking his hand.\n\nJACK: Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.\n\nStuart introduces his secretary, Susie (Alison Coleridge).\n\nSTUART: This is my secretary, Susie.\n\nJACK: Susie, how do you do?\n\nSUSIE: Hello.\n\nSTUART: Have any trouble finding us?\n\nJACK: Oh, no problem at all. I made the trip in 3 and a half hours.\n\nDid Jack have any trouble finding them? No, the drive was only three and a half hours. (Only!) Mr. Ullman says that Jack made good time and asks his secretary to bring them coffee and requests she call Bill Watson to join them.\n\nSTUART: Well, that's very good time, very good. Please sit down. Jack, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?\n\nJACK: Well, if you're going to have some I wouldn't mind, thanks.\n\nSTUART: Susie?\n\nSUSIE: Sure.\n\nSTUART: Oh, and would you ask Bill Watson to join us.\n\nSUSIE: Yes, I will.\n\nFig. 13 - Jack and Ullman shaking hands before the \"impossible\" window.\n\nBefore continuing, it should be noted that the exterior window in the office is a physical impossibility, the office being entirely interior the building. We should be aware of this at least subconsciously as we have just viewed the lobby's elevator area extends far beyond the office, having even briefly observed the hall that is behind the office, the elder man who will later examine the maze having come from that hall. But we tend to accept the office as it is, ignoring the impossible window, because all else appears to be so normal. The characters accept the window and, trusting the characters, the audience assumes this must be an external wall.\n\nBut when one becomes fully aware it is an impossibility, the window becomes as forbiddingly out of place as the hazy glare it allows into the office, and the foliage outside the window seems almost to be as spies peering in. Boundaries decimated, made meaningless, the office can itself seem to begin to disappear, melting away as greenery invades.\n\nThe window is as artificial a source of light as the two glaring florescent lamps above. For all intents and purposes it is yelling at us, \"What is wrong with this picture?! How can I possibly exist? What am I doing here?\"\n\nThe characters never actually interact with the window. They never recognize it is there by either a glance, action, or comment.\n\nAn examination of the below map of the lobby and associated areas will make obvious the absurdity of the window.\n\nFig. 14 - Map of the lobby and the surrounding halls that will be unveiled throughout the film.\n\n11 Crossfade from the office to Boulder exterior. (4:10 crossfade begins, full fade in by 4:12.)\n\nUllman's assistant stepping out for coffee, begin the crossfade from the office to the apartment back in Boulder, blue skies pouring in through the florescent boxes on the ceiling so they become as skylights, the Flatiron mountains back in Boulder filling the impossible window.\n\nWe briefly have the feeling of being within the confines of the hedge maze with the Boulder greenery filling in the wall to the left, and the potted plants spilling their greenery from above.\n\nFig. 15 - The crossfade from Ullman's office to the apartment complex in Boulder.\n\nReturn to the top of the page\n\nLUNCH WITH DANNY, WENDY, TONY (DON'T FORGET TONY), THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, AND THE KENSINGTON\n\nFig. 16 - The Boulder apartment complex. View its location taken from Google street view.\n\nAccompanied by the sound of dogs barking and children playing (though none are observed) slow zoom in on a complex of blank apartment buildings via a parking lot with a basketball post to the left, the buildings backed by mountains, recalling the initial shot of the lodge at the end of the opening sequence of the movie and striking a parallel.\n\nIf you happened to miss the link just above, here first is a short post on the blog with repurposed shots from Google Maps street view pinpointing the location of the Boulder apartment.\n\nThe name of the apartment complex is the Kensington.\n\nWhy this particular apartment complex? Has it anything to do with it being the Kensington? Are we to be reminded of Peter Pan and Wendy, Jim Barrie having met the Davies children at Kensington Gardens and playing with them there? Would Kubrick have us think upon Wendy and the lost boys to whom she serves as a mother figure, and Peter Pan who counts adult mothers as his enemies? Peter Pan's habitat was Neverland, and the two girls in blue will first appear to Danny here, who will later beckon him to come play with them forever, and ever, and ever, just as Jack will say he wishes they could stay at the Overlook forever, and ever, and ever. When Jack abusively berates Wendy, his language is that of a person hostile to the responsibility of parenthood, a sense of his feeling entrapped by her and Danny, the responsibility of the Overlook finally replacing those familial ties in the dramatic Colorado Lounge scene.\n\nJim Barrie was, himself, a rather sinister figure in his attraction to boys.\n\n12 MS of Wendy and Danny in the Boulder apartment dining area. (4:19)\n\nCut to Wendy Torrance (Shelley Duvall) sitting at a dining table with her ash blond-haired son, Danny (Danny Lloyd). The table is covered with an orange-red and white checkered cloth in which we can see printed symbols such as hearts and fish. Dressed in red union suits (she wears two, which will eventually become apparent) with a light blue checked pinafore/jumper over them, she drinks coffee and smokes, reading a red paperback with gold lettering, The Catcher in the Rye.\n\nA red field to the right of Wendy mirrors or doubles her sleeve and we are never really given a clear visual of to what that red field belongs. The book also displays mirroring/doubling, with the title displayed in the same manner on the back cover as on the front. A reason the red field to the right isn't noticed generally, and we don't look for to what it belongs, is that Wendy's leg in the foreground seems to pull the eye into her and the laundry basket on the stand of the ironing board in the background that then seems to link the eye over to Danny.\n\nDanny eats a white bread sandwich, watching a television that is off screen in the yet unseen living room. Wendy has also a sandwich but it is untouched. To Danny's side on the table there is a black object later revealed to be a toy gun in the scene in which he explores the maze with Wendy (the gun is apparently from the Star Trek Phaser II Target Game). White shelves holding books hang on the rear wall. In the background is the yellow laundry basket with clothes on an ironing board, books stacked on it as well. A baseball rests on the board between the books and the basket. For a while I misinterpreted a little sculpture next to salt and pepper shakers as an elephant. I was wrong! A reader, Melkarth, sent me an image which shows it's an alabaster bull. What appears to be a blue box showing Q-tips Cotton Balls stands on the first shelf of the bookcase beside the alabaster bull figurine, and could possibly be taken as a stand-in for a blue sky with clouds considering its placement above the horizon line. This box too is positioned so that it exhibits doubling. Below, resting on the floor is a tray decorated with flowers all in autumnal brown tones, and the plates upon which they eat are decorated similarly. Kubrick has unobtrusively incorporated a natural landscape via the flowered tray and the box. It is something which we humans do all the time, bedecking all our accoutrements of life with natural and abstracted floral and fauna designs and symbols.\n\nThe presence of boxes in the background immediately communicates impermanence, transience. This is a family that is either coming or going, not quite settled in yet or preparing to move along.\n\nAs for the presence of the phaser from the Star Trek game, if one looks it up one finds the art on the game's box shows an unidentified man in a red shirt shooting a villain whose body is divided so it's half black and half white. I guess this would be Bele from the story \"Let That Be Your Last Battlefield\". In it, Lokai, a man whose body is half black and half white, requests asylum on the Enterprise, claiming he's a political refugee. Bele, whose skin is a mirror image of Lokai's, is in pursuit of Lokai. Bele states he's a police commissioner and Lokai is a not a refugee but a political traitor. The conflict is revealed to be one of slavery and racial segregation. Returning to their planet, Cheron, it's discovered to have been destroyed by racial war. Still, Lokai and Bele are unable to resolve their differences and chase each other back down to that world, the storyline ending so that we have no idea as to their fate. Peculiarly, they both were able to manifest individual force fields that made the Star Trek phasers ineffective.\n\nJack will murder the only African-American in The Shining.\n\nFig. 17 - Wendy and Danny eat lunch, watching cartoons.\n\nWendy's appearance doesn't strike as eccentric or \"mousy\" today (or to me it doesn't) but back in 1980 her style here would have been perceived as somewhat peculiar, the latitude allowed for divergence from a certain conception of attractiveness not being exactly broad. So, Kubrick has cast as his heroine an actress who departs from the strict ideal and has accentuated this, for in the documentary of The Shining Shelly exhibits indeed a striking, ethereal beauty.\n\nMany dark-haired parents have children with light hair, but the audience may have worked for a minute to accept Wendy as light-haired Danny's mother, as they look so dissimilar.\n\nKubrick's portrayal of Wendy departs from King's book, which imagined Wendy as an attractive, sensual, blond, King's later movie casting Rebecca de Mornay, who fulfilled the type.\n\nWe hear a familiar \"beep beep\" that resonates with the childhoods of so many who grew up mid 20th century and realize that Danny is watching a Roadrunner cartoon. These cartoons concern Wile E. Coyote always being foiled in his attempts to catch the Roadrunner, both being tricksters but Wile E. not quite as crafty. There's hardly a person in 1980 who wouldn't have immediately bonded with the pedestrian situation of the lunch table and its simple sandwiches through the familiar cartoon vocabulary of a cartoon that was a shared experience. Not to mention everyone grew up eating white bread peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\n\nDanny wears a red, white and blue pullover shirt printed with another trickster figure, Bugs Bunny, who stands beside a basketball hoop, and we recall the basketball hoop in the parking lot. The blue sleeves are decorated with white stars on red bands.\n\nDANNY: Mom?\n\nWENDY: Yeah:\n\nDANNY: Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?\n\nWENDY: Sure I do, it'll be lots of fun.\n\nDANNY: Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.\n\nDanny sounds unconvinced on either count. Just a few moments before we had heard the sounds of children at play outside and though we'd not seen those children the audience is not entirely convinced that there are no children around with whom Danny could play. His isolation may stem from something other.\n\nWENDY: Yeah, I know. It always takes a little time to make new friends.\n\nAs Wendy says \"friends\" we cut away to Danny's reaction, the sound of a train in the cartoon beginning and continuing through Tony's initial protestations that he doesn't want to go to the hotel.\n\n13 MCU of Danny. (4:45)\n\nDANNY: Yeah, I guess so.\n\nShortly, much will be made of the isolation of the hotel, but the family is already living an isolated life in Boulder, though the situation doesn't stand out as peculiar yet. Just a mom and son eating sandwiches in a kitchen that, by virtue of its lighting and the framing of the shots, is experienced as real-life rather than a set.\n\nThe presence of The Catcher in the Rye at the table may belie Jack's later assertion that Wendy is a great fan of ghost stories and horror. The novel concerns the collapsing mental health of a teenage boy who has problems with \"applying himself\" and has recently been kicked out of his prep school. Jack, in King's novel, was fired from his job at a prep school due an altercation with a student, but this is never mentioned in the film and no clear reason is ever given for the family being in Colorado, so one could possibly look upon The Catcher in the Rye as filling in that lost part of the story. I also wonder if the novel wasn't partly used for the antipathy of the novel's protagonist for Hollywood films and the feeling his brother had squandered his talent by going to work for Hollywood.\n\nAs already noted, the front and back covers of the book mirror each other, partnering with other doublings specifically having to do with Wendy in this scene (such as the red field mirroring the red sleeve) and in her later conversation with the doctor. She is somewhere in the middle of Holden's autobiography on his troubles with leaving the more innocent world of childhood for the grim, disheartening reality of adulthood when she places the book down to dialogue with Danny and attempt to convince him that being isolated in the Colorado wilderness for the duration of the winter is a fine idea.\n\n14 MCU of Wendy. (4:50)\n\nFig. 18 - Wendy and the kitchen.\n\nThe camera now shows another view of the kitchen behind Wendy, Joy and Ivory dishwashing liquids on a shelf above a wall-mounted paper towel holder, dishrag draped over the kitchen sink's faucet, carton of milk on the counter with several other boxes of dry goods. The view also shows the oven with matched pots arranged on top, an exhaust fan above, and perhaps a coffee maker. The Torrance's apartment in Boulder is standard fare for the era.\n\nThe white diagonal on the red, white and blue milk carton in the background seems to help direct the eye up and toward Wendy's face, so we focus on it.\n\nThough the red milk carton and red cereal box have nothing to do with the red field mirroring the red sleeve earlier, even though they are in a completely different position, they end up visually standing in for that red field so we feel no real compulsion to look for it.\n\nWENDY: What about Tony? He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.\n\n15 MCU of Danny. (4:53)\n\nTony is revealed to be an imaginary friend of the boy's. In this scene, he's actively encouraged by Wendy to enter the dialogue. If Danny is unconvinced that going to the Overlook is a swell idea, she is attempting to use Tony to convince him otherwise. But Tony's more independent than that.\n\nDanny moves the index finger of his left hand as a physical representation of Tony, and what Tony squeekily has to say is...\n\nTONY: No he ain't, Mrs. Torrance.\n\nWhich is perhaps how Danny really feels but is reluctant to voice disagreement. Though Danny speaks with Tony's voice, Tony is referred to in the third person, which indicates Danny is Tony's actual voice.\n\n16 MCU of Wendy. (4:57)\n\nWENDY: Now, come on, Tony, don't be silly.\n\n17 MCU of Danny. (4:59)\n\nTONY: I don't want to go there, Mrs. Torrance.\n\n\"Tony\" now refers to himself in the first person.\n\n18 MCU of Wendy. (5:01) The camera has cut to Wendy while Danny/Tony said \"Mrs. Torrance.\"\n\nWENDY: Well, how come you don't want to go?\n\n19 MCU of Danny. (5:04)\n\nTONY: I just don't.\n\n20 MCU of Wendy. (5:06. Crossfade to office begins at 5:10.)\n\nWENDY: Well, let's just wait and see. We're all going to have a real good time.\n\n\"We're all going to have a real good time,\" and the audience laughs, because most everyone's mothers would send them into a crumbling coal mine with the admonition to pay no attention to your lazy, narcoleptic canary, because you're going to have a great time (they sent you to kindergarten, didn't they).\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\nStylistically, as far as set design, it's interesting how the sharp angle in the graphic design of the milk carton, which rests above and follows Wendy's shoulder, is echoed in the diagonal of the ironing board stand above Danny's shoulder. These angles not only seem to push the eye toward the center of the screen, they also are dynamic enough that they provide a similitude that ties these shots together. One more thing I would like to make mention of is the long zucchini that is seen resting on the milk cartons, below the dishwashing liquids. It's positioned to be noticed, to not disappear on the counter. My thought on it is that it may refer to the green and blue object held by the Great Mother in Morrisseau's painting in the secretarial office at the Overlook, connecting Wendy with the painting, she attired in the reds and blues of the painting, and, as I mentioned earlier, her hair styled like the Great Mother, who seems to me to not only be a nurturing presence in Morrisseau's painting, but to have in her also the violence of life.\n\n21 MS Stuart's office. (5:14 crossfade from Boulder apartment ends.)\n\nWe have crossfaded back to Jack and the red-haired Mr. Ullman drinking coffee, the camera view in opposition to the one earlier, positioned now to show the office from behind Ullman's desk, a large bright red book prominently placed on it. The crossfade juxtaposes Wendy looking right as Bill Watson enters, he also looking right, as if a connection is being forged between them, and at least one is forged visually, however briefly.\n\nReturn to the top of the page\n\nAbout the cartoon...\n\nHaving learned via John Bourassa that the cartoon playing is the \"Stoop! Look! And Hasten! one, thought I'd check it out.\n\nIn the cartoon, the train sound starts and we have two whistles, this repeated again with the two whistles, then immediately thereafter Wiley E. (having believed he's escaped the train which was below him) hears a louder roaring of the train and turns to see its big white light bearing down on him inside the dark of the tunnel behind him and then there's a resounding explosive encounter.\n\nIn The Shining we have the train roar with its two whistles, followed by the other one with its two whistles, and Kubrick leaves out the last big white light roar and crash. He doesn't just cut it out, he jumps a few seconds into a following segment, letting us hear the elastic kind of sound (like rubber bands) of one of those boxes with a handle you press down so TNT goes off, and there's a big explosion that follows that in the cartoon but Kubrick cuts that out. He also cuts out the following escapade of Coyote on a revving motorcycle and its crash, Kubrick exiting with music heard during the next escapade in the cartoon when Wiley E. is pouring Acme bird seed out onto the road.\n\nI'm sure that I've thoroughly managed to confuse you there.\n\nThat excised big bright white light appearing out of the dark part of the cartoon in a sense will be replaced with the painting of the horse racing down the train track toward the light of the oncoming locomotive as Wendy and the doctor leave Danny's room and sit down in the living room for their consultation. And, recollect, we have the doctor shining the bright light in Danny's eyes just previous that.\n\nThe cartoon tunnel seems to anticipate the movie Wendy will be watching when Jack calls her that he's gotten the job at the Overlook, its plot concerning the creation of a train tunnel.\n\nReturn to the top of the page\n\nComin' Through the Rye\n\nMy current question on the presence of the Catcher in the Rye book is if it may also refer to the presence of Comin' Through the Rye in Basil Dearden's 1957 film Big Time Operators (renamed The Smallest Show on Earth for the US). In it you have some themes that come up again and again in Kubrick's work, the blurring of the line between art and reality, the breaking of the 4th wall. Plus, Peter Sellers, who was in Kubrick's Lolita and Dr. Strangelove, plays a film projectionist in it.\n\nThe plot of the film. A couple receives an old movie theater as an inheritance. As it happens, the ancient theater is now next a train line. At this old theater, the Bijou, they play mostly these terrible old cowboy and Indian films (which were made for this film). During cowboy and Indian chase scenes involving a train, the train that runs by the theater coincidentally passes at the same time, shaking it up, coincidentally stops when the train stops on the screen, then restarts when the train on screen restarts. Reality syncs with the film. Wanting to learn how to make their theater more popular, the couple goes to a rival theater and we see during an entertainment break an \"ice cream girl\" (sweets dispenser) appear on the movie screen and progress down on-screen stairs toward the viewer. Then the same happens in reality in front of the movie screen and the audience buys all these sweets. So, the sweets girl seems to exit the film and enter reality. The couple, to enhance refreshment sales in their theater, tries this technique. Not only do they have a sweets girl but they regulate the environment in the theater. The janitor is shown in the boiler room boosting the temperature so that, while the audience is watching films on people near dying of thirst in the parched desert, the viewers are also experiencing extreme heat that provokes thirst, and this boosts refreshment sales dramatically.\n\nThis is similar to Kubrick's breaking of the 4th wall repeatedly in A Clockwork Orange, referring to the presence of the audience in various ways and thus making it a part of the story, the film. I could give other examples, such as when Kubrick even treats his people on the screen as real individuals attempting to interact with the audience, as happens with the boxer's manager in Killer's Kiss when he is attempting to escape some thugs and pounds upon a theater door, trying to attract the attention of the audience to the threat against him, but fails.\n\nKubrick repeatedly used trains in his films as a symbol for synchronicity and cyclings of events. In A Clockwork Orange we have the comic of the \"ghost\" train, in which a photographer takes a photo of a train accident that happened a hundred years beforehand. The question posed is how did it happen? In Eyes Wide Shut the newspaper articles that surround the one on the OD of the model have to do with synchronous violent events on a subway/train happening several years apart almost to the day, those stories having been real life events. Again, in the apartment in Boulder, Wendy is watching a film about the building of a railroad track and there is the painting of the horse running down the train track toward a pre-scripted destiny. Always the ideas of free will versus a mechanical universe are parlayed.\n\nBut back to The Smallest Show on Earth. Peter Sellers, as a projectionist who is trying to not drink, has to wrestle constantly with the theater's ancient projectors to not only keep them running but to prevent them from destroying the film. The projectionist room in that movie even resembles the boiler room in the basement in The Shining. The vibe is the same and the projectors look like miniature versions of the boilers that only serve a portion of the Overlook, forced heat being used in much of it. I posit that we need to reflect upon what it means if Kubrick is tying in these projectors with the idea of the boilers, and it seems he is. Though much isn't made of the boilers in Kubrick's film, the boiler was nearly a character in King's book, representing Jack's rage. In The Smallest Show on Earth we have these problematic projectors that work in concert with the janitor hiking the heat of the Bijou's boiler to make people overheat and purchase drinks. Film footage displays a desert scene, the heat of the boiler is raised, everyone sweats and thirsts. What is more, the audience is represented as unconscious of their thirst being connected to the heat being jacked up during the desert scenes. Just as the Bijou's audiences are influenced, both intentionally and by synchronicity (the train), experiencing certain aspects of the film in reality, what do these intersections mean to the audience of film in general (or any art), and in particular The Shining?\n\nFig. 21 - Wendy checking the boilers in the basement.\n\nThe Bijou Cinema having been revived (somewhat), the new owners enter one day to hear the projector running and a piano being played. They go in and find the projectionist and the janitor and the ticket taker, who have worked there for decades, holdovers from the old days, watching the old silent feature Comin' Through the Rye. On the screen we see a man departing, through the rye, and his lover telling him that before his return the rye will be harvested and her heart as empty as the field. Peter Sellers tells the new owners that he has saved all these films from the old days and now the theater feels like old times. In other words, the theater's revival has revived the past. Much the same happens with Jack at the Overlook. He revives, in it, the past.\n\nI'm going to use this line of thought as an oblique in to bringing up Jim Barrie again as regards Kubrick's choice for using an apartment complex called the Kensington for the Boulder scenes, which provides links to Peter Pan and not only certain aspects of its story line, the perpetual return of Peter Pan, but even the questionable circumstances surrounding Jim Barrie's relationship to the boys and Peter Llewelyn Davies, in 1960, committing suicide by throwing himself in front of a train when he was laboring to put in order letters and documents concerning the family and their relationship to Barrie, his plan being to publish them but also destroying more than 2000 letters written between his brother Michael and Barrie as he said they were \"too much\". Again, we have a train tragedy connected with revivification of the past.\n\nBasil Dearden, director of The Smallest Show on Earth, also was one of the directors showcased in the old horror classic Dead of Night. As with The Shining, that film, too, is all about deja vu. An architect goes to an old country house, hoping for some work, and realizes that it is a house he has dreamed about--a dream which ends badly. Will the same fate be suffered in real life? We are treated to several ghostly paranormal tales told by individuals who keep entreating the architect to stay. One of those stories is a comic paranormal tale involving golf, and I've considered it may be the source for the \"Golfing with the Greats\" reference we'll see in the Boulder kitchen when Wendy is washing dishes. Another tale concerns a ventriloquist with a dummy that turns out to be independently alive, a plot that served as basis for the later Danny Kaye film, Knock on Wood. Basil Dearden included a reference to Knock on Wood in The Smallest Show on Earth. Knock on Wood is the film that is playing at the rival theater when the couple goes to a show there and sees that refreshment sales were enhanced by the attractive sales girls who replicate the sales girl seen on the screen. So, in The Smallest Show on Earth the two real films used in the theaters are Knock on Wood and Comin' Through the Rye. The rest were made for the film and concentrate on the Cowboy and Indian theme. When the old theater is about to be closed again, the couple that inherited it settle in to watch the \"red-skins' bite the dust one last time.\n\nCircularity of action is in all of Kubrick's films. Dead of Night, as it turns out, was one of the points of origin for the Steady State of the Universe theory conceived by cosmologists Fred Hoyle, Thomas Gold and Hermann Bondi, which has since been overruled by the Big Bang Theory.\n\n\"The steady-state theory was inspired at least in part by a 1940s movie entitled Dead of Night. The movie had four parts and a circular structure such that at the end the movie was the same as at the beginning. After seeing this movie in 1946, Thomas Gold, Hermann Bondi, and Fred Hoyle wondered if the universe might not be constructed the same way. The discussion that followed led ultimately to the steady-state theory.\"\n\nKubrick employed this kind of circularity almost from the beginning. It was in Fear and Desire, in which the film begins as it ends with the same view of the valley. He used it in A Clockwork Orange with Alex revisiting in the 2nd part places he'd visited in the first. The same happens in 2001, the 2nd half beginning with almost all shots of Frank's space walk replicating, with slight changes, shots from when Dave was doing his space walk. We have this circularity in The Shining with the deja vu. We have it in Eyes Wide Shut with the synchronous events of the trains, with Bill wandering the same streets again and again, and his attempting in the second part of the film to revisit places from the first part and locate people who have disappeared between the first and second parts.\n\nThe silent film Comin' Through the Rye is based on a book by Helen Mathers, in which the rye field becomes connected with history repeating itself.\n\n...I go to the stile that divides the meadow from the field of rye, and lean over it, thinking dully of that day two months ago, when I made my wreath and sent George away cross, and ran against Paul Vasher in the midst of the ripe grain.\n\n\"History repeats itself,\" I say, half aloud, as I watch those cunning workmen--the ants, scurrying about at the base of the primitive stone stile; \"but only up to a certain point, and there it always fails. Now there is no Paul to come over the field today; he is probably shooting with the rest at Luttrell. I shall never have a chance of seeing him here either, for after today I will not come this way.\"\n\nI lift my eyes and see Paul Vasher coming across the field of rye to meet me. I do not speak or stir; the hour has come, and must be met...\"I have come to claim the fulfillment of your promise,\" he says...\n\nThat pretty well clinches it for me that Kubrick, by means of Salinger's Coming Through the Rye book, was referring to The Smallest Show on Earth, and by means of it the silent film and book, Comin' Through the Rye. When Wendy is sitting there with the Salinger book, its back cover perfectly mirroring the front cover, with the hidden reference to Mather's Comin' Through the Rye, she is reading a book on history repeating itself.\n\nReturn to the top of the page\n\nINTRODUCING BILL WATSON, A MAN WITH PRECIOUS FEW WORDS ON THE SITUATION - THE OVERLOOK'S SAD HISTORY RELATED\n\nFig. 19 - Crossfade from Boulder to Ullman's office.\n\nFirst, I would encourage one to take note as to how the bottom lines of the cabinetry and the hood of the range in the Boulder kitchen beautifully line up with the lines for the ceiling and the shelving at screen left in the Overlook office. Attention to elements such as these make for a fluid transition in the crossfade.\n\nThe sharp angle of the graphic design of the milk carton that moves upper screen left to lower screen right, is answered here by the framed graphic on the wall that presents a sharp angle moving from upper screen right to lower screen left. Though the eye does go to Bill as he enters, by the lines of the kitchen cabinetry and range crossfading into the shelving and ceiling, and the propulsion of the lines in the strong graphics I've just mentioned, the eye feels as though it is being pushed also to just between Stuart and Wendy as she fades out. From there, the eye seems even to be pulled, by the yellow and orange framed graphic, off screen to the left. It's an interesting way of moving the viewer's gaze.\n\nAs Bill enters, we see in the secretarial area beyond a print on the wall. This same print will be observed again at the end of the film in a foyer where we will finally view characters entering and exiting the lodge, specifically when Wendy goes out to inspect the Snow Cat which Jack has disabled, when Dick arrives, and when Jack leaves the lodge to chase Danny into the maze. It is \"Flock of Loons\" by the artist Norval Morrisseau. I've already noted how I believe Wendy is to some degree represented in Morresseau's painting of the Great Mother, and with the crossfade we have her face briefly viewed in conjunction with Morrisseau's work.\n\nShe is also, through this crossfade, allied with the caretaker, Bill. As we will later see, Kubrick suggests to the viewer that Wendy is the one, rather than Jack, who does much of the caretaking of the lodge.\n\nThe large, bright red book in the foreground possibly complements and takes the place of Wendy's reading of The Catcher in the Rye with its red cover. She was in the middle of that book, a page dog-eared, and the middle portion of this book is blue, bisecting the first half from the latter.\n\nUllman introduces Jack. As Bill sits in the chair next to Jack, Ullman tells Watson that Jack will be caretaking the Overlook that winter and that he wants Bill to walk him around the lodge. We know from King's book that Bill Watson is the summer caretaker and a descendant of the original owners of the lodge, so a certain symmetry is formed with these two caretakers seated next yet opposite each other. In scenes where Bill and Jack are viewed from the rear, a complementary chord is struck, though Bill is dressed in a more tailored suit with a dark brown jacket and lighter brown pants.\n\nKubrick's Watson differs significantly from King's. King's vision was a vulgar and seemingly uneducated older man, and Watson's suit and tie are little suited to the job unless his duty is to act primarily as an overseer of others who do the dirty work, which isn't as it was in the book. When we later see the boiler room, which is also a kind of ramshackle office with an old desk and refrigerator, Bill, as he is represented by Kubrick, seems he would ill fit in with that setting and its numerous girly pin-ups.\n\nSTUART: Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.\n\nBILL (closing door): How do you do?\n\nJACK (has risen to shake hands): Bill, how do you do?\n\nBILL: Pleasure to meet you.\n\nJACK: Pleasure to meet you.\n\nSTUART: Grab a chair, Bill. Join in. Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter. I'd like you to take him around the place as soon as we're through.\n\nBILL (seated): Fine.\n\nSTUART: Jack is a...\n\n22 MCU of Jack. (5:32)\n\nSTUART (off-screen): ...schoolteacher.\n\nJACK (correcting): Uh, formerly a schoolteacher.\n\nBILL (off-screen): What line of work are you in now?\n\nJACK: I'm a writer. Teaching's been more or less a way of making ends meet.\n\n23 MCU of Bill. (5:43)\n\nBILL: Well, this ought to be quite a change for ya.\n\n24 MCU of Jack. (5:45)\n\nJACK: Well, I'm looking for a change.\n\nAnd that's it for Bill Watson's speaking role in this scene. He has said, \"Pleasure to meet you\", \"Fine\", \"What line of work are you in now\", and \"Well, this ought to be quite a change for ya\" and now falls into silence, only observing.\n\nAs the camera stays fixed on Jack, Ullman begins...\n\nSTUART: Our people in Denver recommended Jack...\n\n25 MCU of Stuart. (5:50)\n\nSTUART: ...very highly.\n\nA medium close-up now of Ullman's desk shows, among other things, his prominently displayed name plate, a black fountain pen, a pewter tankard holding more pens, a white pen next to a desk calendar, a pint-size American flag, and we notice his red and white striped shirt and red tie and blue blazer patriotically echo the flag.\n\nThe desk is covered with protective glass and appears even more cluttered than it is partly because of its reflective surface mirroring all the objects placed upon it.\n\nThroughout these shots of Ullman, we don't see the bird statuette on the window sill behind him, which is there but concealed by his head.\n\nIn the background, on the left, is a rather unattractive wooden object of a peculiar shape that doesn't appear to be a sculpture but has no obvious purpose. The feel is of stripped branches arranged into what is supposed to be of utilitarian function, but it's rare to be unable to guess how an object may be used. In more removed shots we see on the right of the desk a medium-size bush in a floor pot, that plant having two pokey branches ascending above the rest and being about the same height as the peculiar object on the left.\n\nSTUART (smiling): And for once I agree with them.\n\nUllman has a bit of quirk where he often rubs his finger against the side of his nose or beneath it, bringing to mind Danny's Tony who assumes presence via Danny's index finger.\n\nWhen Wendy had brought Tony into the conversation, it had been to try to get the agreement of another party in going to the Overlook.\n\nFig. 20 - Stuart Ullman.\n\nThere is more than a passing similarity between this scene and the one in A Clockwork Orange in which Alex meets with the governor of the prison.\n\nFig. 21 - The prison's governor in \"A Clockwork Orange\".\n\nWith Ullman we have his shirt and its cuffs prominently echoing the flag, while with the prison's governor we have his shirt and cuffs echoing the color of the flowers on the window sill behind his desk. Alex's interview was in preparation for treatment to aid his reform, an opportunity provided by a \"new order\". Here, Ullman is about to reveal some disquieting information, but one still has a sense of things withheld, just as in A Clockwork Orange the prison's governor doesn't divulge to Alex what the nature of his treatment (Serum-114) will be.\n\nReturn to the top of the page\n\nTHE STORY OF THE WINTER OF 1970\n\nSTUART: Now, let's see, where were we? I was about to explain that, uhm, our season here runs from, uh, May 15th to October 30th, then we close down completely until the following May.\n\n26 MCU of Jack. (6:07) Jack convivially wonders why.\n\nJACK: Do you mind if I ask why you do that? Seems to me that the skiing up here (sha) would be fantastic.\n\nSTUART: Ah, it sure would be...\n\n27 MCU of Stuart. (6:14)\n\nSTUART: The problem is the enormous cost it would be to keep the road to Sidewinder open. It's a 25 mile stretch of road and gets an average of 20 feet of snow during the winter, and there's just no way to make it economically feasible to keep it clear. When the place was built in 1907 there was very little interest in winter sports and the site was chosen for its seclusion and scenic beauty.\n\n28 MS of Bill, Stuart and Jack. (6:40)\n\nJACK: Well, it's certainly got plenty of that\n\nAll laugh.\n\nSTUART: That's right.\n\nDespite the fact that's an impossible window, it casts quite a glaring light, strongly marking the ceiling with illumination and shadow. We note a low glare of light on the face of the desk between Jack and Bill Watson, prominent enough that it almost takes on a sense of phantom presence.\n\nFig. 22 - Bill, Stuart and Jack in Ullman's office.\n\nTake a look at how beautifully Stuart is framed here, the visual relationships between the three men and the room.\n\nSTUART: Uh, did they give you any idea in Denver what the job entails?\n\nSeems it's a question posed with some caution.\n\nJACK: Only in a very general way.\n\nSTUART: Well...\n\n29 MCU of Stuart. (6:54)\n\nSTUART: The winters can be fantastically cruel and the basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur, and this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel (Sha sound at 7:08) on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs, and doing repairs...\n\n30 MCU of Jack. (7:13)\n\nSTUART (off-screen): ...so the elements can't get a foothold.\n\nIn other words, so primal nature won't take over again, which suggests a constant fight against it.\n\nThe convivial Jack, eager to make a good impression, earnestly listens and responds.\n\nJACK: Well, that sounds fine to me.\n\n31 MCU of Stuart. (7:19)\n\nSTUART: Uhm, physically, it's not a very demanding job. The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is a tremendous sense of isolation.\n\nFig. 23 - Stuart tests Jack on how he feels about the hotel's isolation.\n\n32 MCU of Jack. (7:28)\n\nJACK: Well, that hmmm just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for. I'm outlining a new writing project and five months of peace is just what I want.\n\n33 MCU of Stuart. (7:41)\n\nSTUART: That's good, Jack, because uh for some people uhm solitude and isolation can...\n\n34 CU of Jack. (7:52)\n\nSTUART (off-screen): ...of itself become a problem.\n\nJACK (confidently): Not for me!\n\n35 MCU of Stuart. (7:57)\n\nSTUART: How about your wife and son?

(8:04)\n\nSTUART: Well, before I turn you over to Bill, there's one other thing I think we should talk about, I don't want to sound melodramatic, but it's something that's been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.\n\nUllman reaches to apparently adjust a pocket of his blazer.\n\n38 MCU of Jack. (8:21)\n\nJACK: I'm intrigued.\n\nSTUART: I don't suppose they...\n\n39 MCU of Stuart. (8:24)\n\nSTUART: ...uh, told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?\n\n40 MCU of Jack. (8:30)\n\nJACK: I don't believe they did.\n\n41 MCU of Bill. (8:33)\n\nBill Watson looks quietly, solemnly, uncomfortably on as Ullman begins to relate the story.\n\nSTUART: Well, uh, my predecessor...\n\n42 MCU of Stuart. (8:37)\n\nSTUART: ...in this job hired a man named Charles Grady as the winter caretaker. He came up here with his wife and two little girls, I think about eight and ten. He had a good employment record, good references, and from what I've been told I mean he seemed like a completely normal individual, but at some point during the winter (sha sound about 8:56) he suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown, he ran amuck and killed his family with an axe.\n\n43 MCU of Jack. (9:08) The camera on Jack, Ullman continues his story.\n\nSTUART: Stacked them neatly in one of the rooms of the west wing, then he uhm well he uh put both barrels of a shotgun in his mouth.\n\nStacking them neatly sounds more like stacking cords of wood.\n\n44 MCU of Stuart. (9:18)\n\nSTUART: Police, well, they thought it was what the old timers used to call cabin fever, kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur...\n\n45 MCU of Jack. (9:29)\n\nSTUART (off-screen): ...when people are shut in together over long periods of time.\n\n(Sha sound 9:34)\n\nJACK: Well, huh, that is quite a story.\n\nHe is unsettled, and it has taken him a moment to gather himself and think how to respond.\n\n46 MCU of Stuart. (9:41)\n\nSTUART (laughing): Yeah, it is. Oh, it's still hard for me to believe it actually happened here, but it did. And I think you can appreciate why I wanted to tell you about it.\n\n47 MCU of Jack. (9:56)\n\nJACK: I certainly can and I also understand why your people in Denver left it for you to tell me.\n\nStuart points out how uncomfortable it was to tell Jack about this history, and thus it's Jack's job to tell him it's all right.\n\n48 MCU of Stuart. (10:06)\n\nSTUART: Well, obviously some people can be put off...\n\n49 MCU of Jack. (10:09)\n\nSTUART (off screen): ...by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.\n\nAnd faced with the challenge that some people might be put off, Jack rises up to the occasion and assures Stuart he and his wife won't be.\n\nJACK: Well, you can rest assured, Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me. (Jack smiles.) And as far as my wife is concerned, I'm sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.\n\n(10:30 begin crossfade to Boulder bathroom.)\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n35\n\n36\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\n41\n\n42\n\n43\n\n44\n\n45\n\n46\n\n47\n\n48\n\n49\n\nThough many may have the feeling of Stuart and Bill being somehow complicit with evil forces of the hotel, and I think it is staged for us to feel that way, Stuart does warn Bill that it is harsh there in the winter, that it would be very harsh for a family, and that there had been disastrous consequences in the case of the Grady family. This is not hidden. One could actually instead look upon Stuart as having more than fulfilled his obligation in presenting the dangers to Jack, and instead of viewing Bill with suspicion one could instead see him as looking upon Jack with suspicion, that he doesn't get a good read off Jack and wonders why he would pursue a job that would place his family in such isolation.\n\nReturn to the top of the page\n\nTHE TWO TYPES OF PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE HOTEL\n\nFig. 25 - The photographs behind Bill are different than the others normally observed.\n\nMost of the photographs observed on the walls of Ullman's office are black and white photos of the type chronicling meetings and luncheons and likely the presence of significant personalities at the lodge, but we also see behind Bill Watson two sepia photos and one wonders what may be their value. The scene is perhaps snowy in them, a highly reflective white, and against that white in the left photo is a dark silhouette of what seems to be an individual. The right photo is even more mysterious, perhaps showing the hedge maze with snow in the foreground, and a peculiar, vague silhouette overlaying that seems to only take on humanoid proportions through the eye looking for such, and yet also lends itself to such. Both photos give a sense of unease, ominous, in particular the way the one of the individual on the left, perhaps a boy, feels to be part of a story line to do with the final hedge maze scene, as if this is a first frame of Danny running to the maze, and the photo to the right is a second frame, following up the first, revealing a monstrous entity pursuing him--but these aren't photos of the final maze scene in the snow as that occurs at night and the hedge maze is also covered in snow.\n\nThe center photo above the sepia ones appears to show two individuals on either side of a big fish, and there are a fair share of photos of people showing off their catches of remarkably large fresh water fish. Then there is the photo to the right of it which is difficult to decipher. It gives the appearance of a female form on the left, and checking out an earlier scene (when Bill enters the office) in which the photo is shown in full doesn't help with identifying what it may be, for if it is a female form, where the head should be we have simply a gray expanse. If it's not a female form it may show at the bottom two or three human silhouettes against an unknown background. It may purposefully be an image that gives a double reading. Double readings are referred to frequently in the film.\n\nFig. 26 - A closer look at the photographs behind Bill.\n\nThere is another photo of a silhouette in the office but we've yet to have it be introduced (I write of it in the Wednesday section).\n\nKubrick has done this before, a good example being with an ad of Quilty in Lolita. At first glance one thinks one knows what one is seeing, but a second glance throws that initial reading in doubt when pieces of the ad don't mesh together.\n\nReturn to the top of the page\n\nNOTES ON ULLMAN'S DESK AND INCONSISTENCIES\n\nThere are three variations of placement of objects on Ullman's desk viewed throughout the interview, and as people seem to like to ask about and discuss these variations, I thought I\"d devote a few paragraphs to them.\n\nWhen Jack enters there's no cigarette in the ash tray. After they have coffee, we see at 5:55 a cigarette in the ashtray and Ullman's white pen pointed toward him (Figure 20); at 6:45 we see the tray is empty when all three men are shown (Figure 22); at 6:58 Ullman's pen is pointed toward him and there is a cigarette in the ashtray; at 7:20 there is no cigarette and the pen is pointed away (Figure 23); at 7:58 the pen is pointed away and there is this time a cigarette (Figure 24); at 8:05 the pen is pointed toward Ullman and there is a cigarette; at 8:26 the pen is pointed away and there is no cigarette; at 9:42 the pen is pointed toward Ullman and there is a cigarette; at 10:07 the pen is pointed away and there is a cigarette.\n\nSo there are some shots where Ullman's white pen is pointed toward him and there's a cigarette in the tray; some shots where the pen is pointed away from Ullman and there is no cigarette; some shots where the pen is pointed away from Ullman and there is a cigarette. One can be confident that the scene was shot many times, more than three, but the inconsistencies boil down to it seeming as if, one could propose, there are three different perspectives or versions presented, which could match with there being three people in the room: Bill, Stuart and Jack.\n\nSeveral times in the movie we have evidence that it seems Jack smokes, but he is never shown smoking, though Wendy is. As the ashtray with the cigarette is on Jack's side of the desk, here again there is the inference that he was smoking before Bill Watson entered the room, during which time we were back in Boulder watching Wendy's untouched cigarette burn away in her ashtray.\n\nAs for the splicing together of seeming three separate versions of the desk, Kubrick uses the same technique for the encounter in Room 237, showing seemingly three different versions, while Jack is present in the room and Danny and Dick are shining it, so we are never confident of who was seeing what.\n\nAnother thing that people make note of is how Jack's suit appears to be a dark blue or gray and white weave in close-up shots, while in other shots it appears to be brown.\n\nFig. 27 - The varying tone of Bill's suit is due film processing.\n\nThis has to do with the film processing. A simple auto color correction of the suit when it appears to be brown makes it gray and more of a match with the suit in close-up.\n\nFig. 28 - The suit autocolored shows it is gray rather than brown.\n\nPeople also make note that Bill Watson's pants appear to be a solid color when he enters and that they later show a pattern. This may be so. It's difficult for me to tell.\n\nReturn to the top of the page\n\nNOTES ON THE TIMINGS OF THE \"SHA\" SOUNDS\n\nJuly 2011, I added a long note here on the timings of an ambient, voiced \"sha\" sound that occurs periodically in the film, and later was alerted that another person had also noticed the same and posted a movie on it previously on Youtube. Our writings on, and realizations of the \"sha\" sound are independent of each other.\n\nThe first such sound, as I've already mentioned, occurs when Jack passes over the spot where he will attack Dick with an axe. Shot 10.\n\nThe \"sha\" is usually briefly preceded with other ambient noises that give a texture of background activity and low background conversation so it seems a part of the natural ambiance. However, though these sounds surrounding the \"sha\" are not always distinguishable, when they can be heard they are always the same. The \"sha\" itself is a breathy percussive voicing.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, below are the timings of the voicing:\n\nJack asks about why the closing of the road, \"seems to me that the skiing...\". The \"sha\" follows the word \"skiing\" at about 6:12. Shot 26.\n\nIt occurs very quietly about 7:07 when Stuart is talking about running the boiler and \"heating different parts of the hotel\". Shot 29.\n\nImmediately after Stuart asks how Jack's wife and child will take to the solitude, during the reaction shot of Jack, the sound occurs at 8:01, just before Jack says, \"They'll love it.\" Shot 36.\n\nThere seems a hint of it when Stuart is first talking about the tragedy during the winter in 1970, though I'm uncertain of that. It distinctly occurs when he next says that \"at some point during the winter\" (the sound is at about 8:55) \"he must have suffered some kind of mental breakdown...\" Shot 42.\n\nThen as Stuart continues talking about the tragedy and describes it as resulting from a \"claustrophobic reaction, which can occur when people are shut in together over long periods of time\" the sound is at 9:34. Shot 45.\n\nThe two most distinct instances of the sound here are during the two reaction shots of Jack, when he's saying his wife and child will love it there, and then again his reaction to the idea of the tragedy occurring because of people shut in together over long periods of time.\n\nThe sound occurs elsewhere in the movie as follows.\n\n20:03 - On \"Closing Day\" when Jack says they'd had a bite to eat, the \"sha\" follows. Shot 101.\n\n20:59 - When Stuart tells Wendy the Indian designs are based mostly on Hopi and Apache motifs, there may follow a \"sha\" sound. Shot 102.\n\n24:02 - Something like the \"sha\" sound is heard as Ullman says they brought in a decorator from Chicago to refurbish the Gold Room area. Shot 112.\n\nIt occurs several times during the kitchen scene on \"Closing Day\", but there is a good deal of other ambient sound and is not as distinct at times:\n\n25:11 - \"Dick (sound) if you're ready to do it now, show...\" The scene where Stuart has Dick show Wendy and Danny the kitchen. The sound occurs with a cross-fade from the ballroom to the entrance to the kitchen, audible as we see the word FIRE appearing on the screen, the big lettering on the fire doors. Shot 113.\n\n25:25 - Wendy says, \"See you later, hon...\" (sound occurs during this). Shot 113.\n\n27:00 - Wendy says to Dick, \"We call him Doc sometimes, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons\" (sound of \"sha\"). Shot 116.\n\n27:20 - It occurs as they enter the C1 storage room. Shot 117.\n\n28:29 - Dick asks, \"...you like ice cream, Doc...\" (sound). Shot 122.\n\n29:15 - The sound occurs right after Wendy says \"Just like a ghost ship, huh\"? as we switch over to Dick looking at Danny in the kitchen, right before Dick asks, \"Do you know how I knew your name was Doc?\" Shot 123.\n\n29:21 - Dick asks, \"Do you know how I knew your name was Doc...\" (sound). Shot 124.\n\n30:16 - Dick asks Danny, as to shining, \"How long have you been able to do it...\" (sound). Shot 132.\n\n31:11 - Danny describes shining. \"I can't remember everything.\" (sound). Shot 142.\n\nAnd then not again until the phone lines are down:\n\n48:36 - When Wendy calls the forest rangers about the downed lines. \"Any chance of them being repaired soon?\" (sound). Shot 221. The sound is abrupt and a little disconcerting.\n\nA reader has also written to let me know that there seems to be a \"sha\" sound when Dick is driving through the snowstorm to get the Snowcat. It happens at 1:38:56 when Hal, over the radio, is saying it's a \"bad day out there\". Shot 427.\n\nOne of course wants a meaning for this \"sha\" and looks for one.\n\nIn the Tarot, the Hebrew letter \"sh\" or \"shin\", is sometimes said to belong to the Key, Judgment, which fits appropriately with the use of \"Dies Irae\" as the opening music. I write a little more on the use of this sound in the \"Saturday\" section.\n\nBut is that the meaning for this \"sha\" or is it something else? I have no idea. There may be no meaning, and these sounds are another example of Kubrick's cycles, perhaps intended to set up an unconscious sense of deja vu. However, since we first heard the \"sha\" when Jack crossed over the spot where Dick will be murdered, that seems to provide reason enough to believe there could be some meaning in them.\n\nReturn to the top of the page\n\nDANNY'S FIRST SHINING OF THE GIRLS AND BLOODY ELEVATOR\n\n50 Crossfade from office interior to Boulder apartment interior. (Crossfade ends at 10:34.)\n\nThe background photographs of what seem to be past business meetings at the hotel, on the wall behind Jack, are replaced with brightly colored stickers on what we assume to be Danny's bedroom door as the camera slowly tracks in to an open door opposite through which we can see Danny before a bathroom sink, he standing on a footstool. We briefly see Jack's face merge with the shower curtain then disappear, which may or may not remind of The Wizard of Oz and the injunction to pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.\n\nFig. 29 - Crossfade from Jack in Ullman's office to the Boulder bathroom.\n\nProminently on Danny's door is Snoopy gleefully skating, surrounded by a rainbow, while above him floats a helium balloon ascending into the clouds with Woodstock. Where have we seen something resembling Snoopy's rainbow before? Let's return to shot 21 and the red outlining the yellow in a frame on the left wall in Ullman's office.\n\nBack to Danny's door. To the left of Snoopy is Mickey Mouse. An owl sits above the rainbow and another image of Snoopy. To the rainbow's right we have Mickey's sweetheart, Minnie Mouse. Above her is a white bird with a black head ascending, and a raven. There is perhaps a duck, maybe another. Then, sneaking off to the right, we have one of Sleeping Beauty's dwarfs, Dopey, who was a friend of the dwarf, Doc, so Dopey would be a suitable companion for Danny who is also called Doc.\n\nWoodstock, a friend of Snoopy's, wasn't very adept at flying, thus the balloon. He needed some help. Snoopy, though a dog, could understand and translate Woodstock's speech which Wikipedia informs was rendered in the cartoon as indecipherable \"chicken scratch\" and with symbols such as Z's and question marks etc.--just as various symbols communicate meaning in the film.\n\nBut, of course, Snoopy also could not \"talk\" and his thoughts were communicated via thought balloons and pantomime.\n\nDopey is a voiceless character. He is endearing to children because he is voiceless and seems to represent their situation in the adult world and its sensibilities that are beyond a child's comprehension.\n\nFig. 30 - Danny in the Boulder bathroom, seen from his bedroom.\n\nA child having to navigate a world built for adults, Danny stands on a stool before the bathroom sink that is built for adult use.\n\nThe bathroom is predominately in pink tones. A mat the color of dark grass wraps about the base of the toilet. A shower curtain is drawn across the bathtub, sunlight shining bright through a high window behind it. The green curtain or valance over the window casts the shower curtain and the room in soft green light. A little rubber yellow duck peeks out from behind the shower curtain to the left, resting on the tub's ledge. Water is heard running in the bathroom.\n\nThe light of the unseen window, through the shower curtain, is as prominent as was the light of the window in Ullman's office. The designs on the shower curtain, with the way they push up into the light, visually take the place of the unmanicured foliage in the lower half of Ullman's window. The pink-salmon tone in the bathroom also ties in with the salmon tone on the walls in Stuart's office.\n\nFig. 22 - Bill, Stuart and Jack in Ullman's office.\n\nAn ominous roar of soundtrack enters as the boy stands on the footstool before the sink, playing in the water. The roar rises and subsides. Silence. The roar rises and subsides. Silence. The expectation of something disquieting builds.\n\nDANNY: Tony, do you think dad will get the job?\n\nTONY: He already did. He's going to phone Wendy up in a few minutes to tell her.\n\n51 MS of Wendy in the kitchen. (10:49)\n\nCut to Wendy washing dishes, still in her union suits and blue overdress, and we now see an Indian beaded belt about her waist. On the counter we see a jar of Peter Pan peanut butter, Smuckers jelly, a canister of grape Koolaid, Fruit Loops, and other items. Hanging above the sink is a green and white dish towel that may read \"Golf with the Greats\". On top of the refrigerator are a couple more canisters of Koolaid, and several postcards are on its front, one of a golden sunrise or sunset. As she puts up the 2% milk in the fridge, the phone rings and she crosses the living room of the apartment to answer it.\n\nWENDY: Hello.\n\nThe television in the background, topped with and surrounded by stacks of books, shows now an old western film rather than the cartoons.\n\nThis is the same television as will be observed eventually in the Torrance's suite at the Overlook, but we will not see it until Wendy paces the floor deliberating on how she may have to leave the mountain without Jack.\n\nIs that some art work showing a terrier above the television? Yes, a painting by Alex Colville. I discuss the terrier in this post. On the left wall hangs a style of Japanese art print very popular for the time.\n\nAgain, this is a room that was standard for its time and fitting in with the simple construction seen in apartment complexes that haven't any architectural frills. The ponderous wood of the credenza that holds the TV was standard fare. The wicker chair was standard fare. The beiges and browns were standard fare. As far as options for home decorating for the lower middle classes, it was a shitty period. People in the Torrance's station of class would be trying to transition from a more 60s flavor of impoverished student style of decoration to one that connoted some stability, as represented in the heavy credenza and coffee table and end tables, and the matching brown sofas.\n\nThat ugly rug peculiarly matches almost exactly with one we picked up in the early 2000s, that we got because it was better than anything else cheaply available and matched up well with some really nice brown brocade covers on our living room futons. It also worked well with the circa 1920 building we were living in. But we also got rid of that rug as quickly as we could.\n\nThe disconcerting music, its intermittent roars, continues.\n\nFig. 31 - Wendy in the living room speaking to Jack on the telephone, the television running in the background.\n\n52 MS Jack in the Overlook lobby. (11:03)\n\nIt's Jack on the phone at the hotel's reception desk. Stuart and Bill stand talking beyond. In the far background, between them, we see an older man standing behind the model of the maze, looking over it--the same man who had entered the hall by the elevators as Jack, just after glancing toward the maze, trod upon the spot where he will later kill Dick and we heard the first \"sha\". A hotel employee who stands at the counter marking yellow sheets is not the same woman who had been at the counter when Jack arrived, and instead may be the individual who had been descending the rear stairway when Jack was headed into the office. A red-jacketed bell hop stands at stiff attention not far behind Jack and is the one who was porting bags at the elevator when Jack was earlier headed to the office.\n\nAs Kubrick cut to this shot, a blond woman in white crosses from right to left behind Jack and continues across the lobby. She may be the blond woman who was seated in the grouping to whom another waiter had appeared to be carrying a silver tray service when Jack was earlier in the lobby. We see beyond her an elder woman in tan, who had been in that earlier grouping, and is now seated opposite the lobby's television and catty corner to where the man with the camera had been earlier seated. He's gone.\n\nJohn Fell Ryan, of the KDK12 Tumblr, has noticed that over the main door there is now a black \"shroud\" or curtain. Are we simply seeing something that was intended to keep out competitive light during filming, or does it foreshadow Dick's death?\n\nJack informs Wendy he got the job and has a lot to do so won't be home before 9 or 10. We can see beyond him the TV on which the Summer of 42 movie will later be played, while beyond Wendy, as already noted, we have the apartment's TV playing the Western, a parallel established between the two scenes visually, the television in each shot weighted to screen right, while Jack leans to screen left and Wendy faces to screen right, the scenes dialoguing with one another.\n\nJack's phone is black whereas Wendy's is white.\n\nJACK: Hi, babe.\n\nWENDY: Hi, hon, how's it goin'?\n\nJACK: Great. Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through. I don't think I could get home before 9 or 10.\n\nFig. 32 - Jack at the phone in the lobby.\n\n53 MS Wendy. (11:13)\n\nWENDY: It sounds like you got the job.\n\n54 MS Jack. (11:14)\n\nJACK: Right. It's a beautiful place. You and Danny are going to love it.\n\n53\n\n54\n\nNotice how the slim art on the left wall in Boulder, and the wider art above the TV in Boulder, complement respectively the slim line of the left column in the Overlook, and the one directly behind Jack. The angle of the reception furniture upon which Jack leans, and its shade, complements the credenza, coffee table and sofas in the Boulder apartment.\n\n55 MCU Danny. (11:20)\n\nCut to the camera zooming in on Danny facing the mirror in the bathroom, speaking to his reflection. We had already observed he was wearing a red and blue and white raglan sleeved shirt decorated with stars around the armband, but while he was in the kitchen we were only able to see the number 4 above that band. Now we see the number fully, and that it is 42.\n\nDANNY: Tony, why don't you want to go to the hotel?\n\nTONY: I don't know.\n\nDANNY: You do too know. Now, come on, tell me.\n\nTONY: Don't want to.\n\nDANNY: Please...\n\nFig. 33 - Danny speaks to Tony via the mirror in the bathroom.\n\nWhen speaking as Tony, Danny moves his finger as if it is a puppet.\n\nTONY: No.\n\nDANNY: Now, Tony, tell me.\n\nThe dialogue between the two, the boy and himself, brings to mind Ullman remarking on how the story of Charles Grady sometimes gives people \"second thoughts\".\n\nThe camera has zoomed in full on Danny's reflection, his eyes dark, and then his eyes widen and a trace of light from the bathroom window illumines them.\n\n56 MS Overlook hall. (11:43)\n\nCut to a hall of the Overlook with nearly symmetrically placed brown plaid chairs and radiant heaters, the bright red doors of elevators beyond. The floors read B L 2 3 4. The first elevator is at the L level and the second is at 2. A flood of blood erupts through the left elevator door that has been forced open from the left by the force of the flood which overtakes the hall with such ferocity that the armchairs are swept away from the walls.\n\nWe see in that red flood of blood a silvery metallic object at the bottom of the elevator door, protruding through it (I've written a post specifically on this). I believe I recollect reading a number of years ago, in a magazine article in the 80s or 90s, that the metallic object was part of the mechanism for the opening of the door and the shot was so expensive that Kubrick decided not to redo it. But, I have also read the shot was done in miniature because it was too expensive to film otherwise. And I have also read that the shot was done many times with Kubrick searching for the right color red that would look like blood.\n\nThe elevators are fairly faithful representations of those at the Ahwahnee Lodge, a difference being that Kubrick's have the arcs above, the half-circles which show story placement.\n\nFig. 34 - The vision of the bloody elevator.\n\nThough the elevators are very close to those at the Ahwahnee, there is a notable difference in decoration.\n\nAhwahnee elevators.\n\nNote that the Ahwahnee elevators have a variation of the fylfot, which would be American Indian or at least American Indian inspired. It's important, sometimes, what we don't see in a Kubrick film, and this is one of those times. Kubrick has been fairly faithful to other design elements but has left out this fylfot, which could be mistaken as a version of a swastika. Why leave it out? Because post WWII it would be questionable to include it? Or because it is, in a sense, concealed and adds another layer of meaning to the elevators? Anyone familiar with the original design work and the resemblance to the fylfot could indeed read into the blood flowing from the elevators a connection to the holocaust.\n\n57 MCU Two girls. (11:58)\n\nCut to two girls who appear to be twins. Dressed in light blue dresses with long pink bows, they stand in an unknown hall decorated with blue carpet and blue flowered wallpaper, staring at the camera, clasping hands, reminiscent of Diane Arbus' famous photograph of the twin girls, but while he was photographing for LOOK Kubrick was already taking pictures of girls in similar attire. The dresses, I believe, are two layers of fabric, a swiss dotted blue fabric over white. Or we may just be seeing through the blue cloth the white of underslilps.\n\nOne of the girls is vaguely smiling while the other girl is frowning.\n\nJust as the chairs and radiant heaters are symmetrically positioned in the elevator hall, but do not perfectly mirror, the girls are not absolutely identical and not equal in dominanc"
