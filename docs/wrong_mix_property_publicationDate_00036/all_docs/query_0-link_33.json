At the time, my interest in cabaret had a limited, localized focus. I had no idea that that modest interest in one particular cabaret would eventually develop into a near obsession. A book on the spread of cabaret throughout turn-of-the-century Europe was furthest from my mind. By the mid-1970s my interest in the early history of the cabaret had become more serious and certainly broader in scope. The first real evidence of this came in the form of a lecture on \"The Turn-of-the-Century European Cabaret and Art\" at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York in December 1975. The lecture, which was repeated at Northwestern University in May 1976, became an article, \"Fin-de-Siècle Cabaret,\" which was published in the Performing Arts Journal in the spring of 1977. By 1982, a book on cabaret was definitely in progress, although the scope of it was still unresolved. That issue would be settled a little later on. Two lectures on cabaret in Vienna—\"The Beginnings of Cabaret in Austria, 1906-1912,\" in Solomon Wank's Vienna Seminar at Concordia University in Montreal in March 1982, and on \"Fin-de-Siècle Vienna Cabaret,\" at Columbia University in April that same year—were based on a rough draft of the chapter on Vienna in the present book. An invitation to participate in a conference on theater and literature in Russia from 1900 to 1930 in Stockholm in late April 1982 provided me with an opportunity to test reaction to what I had managed to complete by then on the prerevolutionary Russian cabaret. Suggestions by my Swedish hosts, and friends, Nils Âke Nilsson, Bengt Jangfeldt, and Lars Kleberg of the Slaviska Institutionen of Stockholm University helped improve\n\nχ Acknowledgments the lecture which was published under the title \"Russian Cabaret in the European Context: Preliminary Considerations\" in Theatre and Literature in Russia, 1900-1930 (Stockholm, 1984). The chapter on Moscow and St. Petersburg/Petrograd cabaret is an expansion of that paper. Much of the research for the book was conducted necessarily in Europe. I had much hospitality and help along the way, which I am happy to acknowledge here: in Helsinki, at the Slavic Library, where an excellent collection of early twentieth-century Russian newspapers and journals was of inestimable value; in Paris, at the Bibliothèque de la Ville de Paris and the Musée de Montmartre, where I was fortunate to arrive in time for the centenary of the Chat Noir; in Munich, at the Bayrische Staatsbibliothek, the Stadtbibliothek, Monacensia Abteilung, with its wealth of material on turn-of-the-century Munich, the Theatermuseum, and the Stadtmuseum, where Miss Reichenwallner and Dr. Düvigneau exerted themselves on my behalf; in Mainz, at the superb Deutsches Kabarettarchiv, where its founder and curator Reinhold Hippen was gracious and solicitous during a whirlwind visit; in Vienna, at the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, the Bildarchiv of the Nationalbibliothek, the Theatersammlung, and the Hochschule and Museum für angewandte Kunst; and in Barcelona, at the Museu del Teatre, where my clumsy Catalan was tolerated with bemused patience. My visits to Barcelona were especially pleasant thanks to the great courtesy and assistance of the Maragall family, above all Sra. Marta Maragall i Montaner and Sr. Joan Antoni Maragall, who permitted me to work in the private collection of the Sala Parés, which was so much a part of turn-of-the-century Catalonian modernism. The afternoons on Petritxol, especially when soft guitar music wafted up from that sliver of a street, will stay long in my memory. Sr. Jacint Reventos of Barcelona was gracious in his reply to a request for information about Jaime Sabartés, and Dr. Josep M . Carbonell of the Departament de Titelles of the Institut del Teatre of the Diputació de Barcelona went out of his way to try to find material on Juli Pi. I would also like to express my gratitude to several personal friends who helped at key points. George Collins of Columbia University provided leads in Barcelona; Mrs. Asunta Carballeira was the one who first put me in touch with the Maragalls; Dr. Ludmilla Hellgren, a dear friend from the old days in Stockholm, sent me copies of Hanns von Gumppenberg's Überdramen at a time when I needed them badly and\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxi\n\nthey were unavailable to me; Mana Kañska of the Wydawnictwo Literackie of Cracow who, together with her delightful family, extended me hospitality and also helped with photographs; Stanislaw Jaworski, Tomasz Weiss, and Andrzej Nowakowski of the Instytut Filologii Polskiej of the Jagiellonian University of Cracow who, together with Pani Jaworska at the Biblioteka Jagiellonska, arranged for me to have reproductions of Green Balloon invitations; and my former student, Frank Sciacca, who dug up rare material on the Moscow Letuchaya mysh and its American tours as the Chauve-Souris of Paris. The late and much missed Bernard Beckerman of Columbia University invited me once to talk on cabaret before the lively Drama Circle that he founded and looked after like an anxious parent. The comments of colleagues and students at that session helped me understand the need for further clarification of certain points. Bernie Beckerman's interest in and valuable comments on the \"cabaret project\" were a source of encouragement, especially when other professional commitments pulled me away from what became a true labor of love for painfully long periods of time. I deeply regret that he is no longer here to pass a keen eye over the final product.

More specifically, it is a detailed account of the rise and spread of what was a veritable cabaret mania throughout Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in that period known as the turn-of-the-century, or, to use the common French term, the fin-de-siècle. Whatever the antecedents or progenitors of cabaret in taverns or cafés where entertainment of one type or another, often impromptu, accompanied drink more often than food, the fact is that the cabaret as a distinct cultural phenomenon has a precise—and relatively recent—chronology. 1 It began in Paris on November 18, 1881, the year in which the first and most famous cabaret of all, the Chat Noir (Black Cat), was established. Paris, during what the French like to call the Belle Epoque, was the cultural capital of Europe, the mecca of the arts to which admirers and young hopefuls flocked from one end of Europe to the other, and indeed from still farther away. If something caught on in Paris, the immense reputation of the city as the source of fashion and innovation insured its rapid diffusion across the Continent and beyond. This is surely what happened in the case of cabaret. The novelty and extraordinary popularity of the Chat Noir—the mystique with which it was invested, the legend that grew up about it—launched a fashion which before long had all of Europe in its grasp. Besides giving rise to many cabarets in Paris itself, in its own time and after it had become history, the Chat Noir also inspired the introduction of cabaret in major centers throughout Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: Amsterdam in 1895, Barcelona in 1897, Berlin, Munich, and Vienna in 1901, Cracow, Poland, in 1905, Budapest in 1907, Warsaw in 1908, Moscow and St. Petersburg in 1908, Prague in\n\njdv Introduction 1911, Christiania (as Oslo was then known) in 1912, after the failure of an earlier attempt in 1892, London in 1912, and Zurich in 1916. Now how do we explain the mercurial rise of cabaret in turn-of-thecentury Europe? Today, cabaret has lost most of its original meaning and purpose. In our own culture, \"cabaret\" is distinguished from \"nightclub\" almost wholly on the basis of size and atmosphere. Indeed, the two terms are often used synonymously, further blurring distinctions. Generally, the nightclub is perceived as physically large, the cabaret, by contrast, small and intimate. The entertainment offered in the nightclub tends toward the gaudier and more in the tradition of the revue: a raised stage, an orchestra, a chorus of dancers, singers, and a standup comedian or two. The audience is seated at tables, food and drink are served, and the space separating audience from performer usually serves the customers as a dance floor in between \"sets\" or programs. Admission to the nightclub is open to anyone and the performers are all paid professionals. The contemporary cabaret retains most of these features, but in scaled down form; it is, in effect, a miniature nightclub. The premises are as a rule considerably smaller (rarely permitting dancing by the public), the entertainment dominated by just one or a few performers, with a bias often toward singers. Unlike the nightclub, the cabaret aims at an atmosphere of intimacy and this is achieved both by the reduced number of entertainers and a spatial configuration that brings performer and audience into relatively close contact. Like nightclubs, however, cabarets generally seat people at tables at which food and drink are served and are open to anyone willing to pay the price. Performers are also paid professionals who move from cabaret to cabaret or appear in other places of entertainment such as nightclubs, theaters, and concert halls. In the beginning, and for most of its history before the end of World War I, cabaret had an entirely different character. It arose, in the first place, as an informal grouping of artists—painters, poets, musicians, and theater people—who felt a need to come together, preferably away from the eye of public and critic alike, in order to enjoy the company of those of similar interests and attitudes, to share their creative efforts, to experiment in any way the spirit moved them, and, most important, to feel free to mock and deride the values and cultural monuments of a society they condemned as hopelessly bourgeois and philistine.\n\nIntroduction xv At its origin, the cabaret had, therefore, a certain elitist character; it existed only or primarily for artists and their closest friends. It was also intended as something essentially private, although this tended to vary from one location to another. In general, however, the public was not actively sought and the cabaret proprietor, usually an artist himself, derived income—at best, a secondary consideration—from drinks (beer or wine) served the cabaret \"regulars.\" The small premises of the early cabarets, usually capable of holding no more than a hundred people, if that, guaranteed that even when members of the public were admitted, both as a concession to insatiable curiosity and, in some instances, for purely commercial reasons, their numbers would be small. In this first brilliant period in the history of the European cabaret, from 1881 to 1917, audiences were made up predominantly of artists who with the growing fame of the cabarets attracted other artists, their friends, and a variety of cultural fellow-travelers. This left little physical space to accommodate a paying public at any one time, so that the admission of the public did not pose any real threat of commercialization. In post-World War I Europe, by which time cabaret had ceased to be a novelty and by and large had fulfilled its function as a locus of an emerging avant-garde, the situation changed considerably. Cabarets were now viewed as places of entertainment; their facilities were expanded and enhanced, their doors thrown open to an ever larger paying public, their programs more professionally arranged and managed, and their spirit transformed from artistic exclusivity and experimentation to commercial divertissement. In chronicling the rise and spread of cabaret from its beginning in Paris in 1881 up to and including the birth of the Dada movement at the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich in the years 1916 and 1917, this book seeks to demonstrate that rather than a marginal cultural activity in the turn-ofthe-century period, the cabaret was very much at the center of the upheaval in the arts then taking place in Europe. As the nineteenth century drew to a close dissatisfaction with prevailing forms of artistic expression, and with the state of culture in general, intensified into an urgent restlessness and desire for change. Artists and intellectuals felt an overwhelming sense of alienation from a society they chose to view as irretrievably mired in the status quo of convention and tradition. It was a society dominated by the bourgeois and the philistine and as the century approached its end, belief in the inevitability of violent change became widespread. Since the orderly reconstitution of society and its values\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nseemed ever more impossible to achieve, the perception took hold that if change was to come it would be only in the wake of some great upheaval, of an apocalypse. Cracks in the pillars of the despised society were becoming more and more visible and the greater the awareness of them the keener the sense of imminent fragmentation and disintegration. World War I, of course, with its awesome devastation, its transformation of the political map of Europe, and its redistribution of power, lay just around the corner. When it erupted, it was greeted by many with foreboding and exhilaration as the long anticipated cataclysm that would finally bury the old century beneath the dust and rubble of its outmoded institutions and monuments. In the climate of that growing sense of fragmentation and imminent collapse, artists and intellectuals became increasingly bolder in their questioning—and ultimate rejection—of authority, increasingly more willing to challenge conventions and traditions. It was this ever widening contempt for authority, in whatever form, that gave rise to the avant-garde. As European culture entered a period of transition toward the end of the nineteenth century, as if in anticipation of the coming of the avant-garde, the cabaret emerged as a focal point of experimentation and innovation. 2 By serving as a gathering place for restless, disaffected, and defiant artists and their fellow-travelers, the cabaret rapidly developed into a kind of sanctuary within whose privacy and safety barbs could be hurled with impunity at the enemies of authority and philistinism just outside the gates, and forms of art cultivated which by their very nature flouted the accepted and approved. Far from being just a marginal activity, the cabaret occupied a forward position on the barricades of the great revolution that was then in the making. Indeed, it emerged when it did because of the undeniable appropriateness of the role it came to fulfill. It is the contention of this book that the art both cultivated and represented by the cabaret is what the Germans call, in a single word, Kleinkunst. Literally translated, Kleinkunst means \"small art.\" The phenomenon referred to is best understood as an \"art of small forms,\" that is, an art consisting of genres traditionally regarded as minor, or marginal, in terms of so-called high culture. With hardly an exception, the genres of Kleinkunst cultivated in the turn-of-the-century European cabarets had already been in existence for some time. This is certainly true of the French popular song, the chanson. In some instances—pantomime, puppet, marionette, and shadow shows, for example—they go back to antiq-\n\nIntroduction xvfi uity. By the late nineteenth century, when cabaret first began to appear, most, if not all, forms of Kleinkunst were associated in people's minds with popular culture, with the entertainment offered at fairs, circuses, musical halls (for which those in London often provided the model), or variety theaters (variété, in French), which enjoyed great popularity at the time in Paris, Rome, and Naples. These \"small\" forms, or genres, included: the popular song (chanson), generally sentimental, romantic, or patriotic; puppet and marionette shows, sometimes derived from a particular domestic tradition such as the Catalonian putxinel-lis or the Polish szopka; shadow shows (what the French call ombres chinoises, \"Chinese shadows,\" because of their presumed Oriental origin), consisting of the silhouettes of figures and scenes cut out of cardboard or some other material and projected onto a small screen by means of a background light; poems of a humorous, frequently satiric character, at times related to popular tradition such as the German Bänkelsang and Moritat, which dealt mostly with sensational happenings and were sung by street performers who set up shop on benches, often accompanying themselves on a fiddle or illustrating their songs by means of a poster-like canvas with scenes painted on it; dances, folk or popular in origin; one-act plays and dramatic sketches, often satirical or parodie; monologues, and other forms of recitation. The preference for \"small forms\" on the part of the turn-of-the-century cabaretists was hardly coincidental. Quite the contrary; it was by means of the cultivation of genres long regarded as minor or marginal that the artists who created the great European cabaret culture of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries sought not only to break with tradition and convention, but to defy them. By turning to folk and popular culture for inspiration, by merging \"high\" and \"low\" art, by narrowing—or eliminating—the distance between spectator and performer, they signalled their disdain for the art of a society that had increasingly become less relevant to them. At the same time, they pointed the way to a revolution in taste that would set the stage for a new art. If cabarets were at the outset elitist virtually by definition, the art for which they became best known was anything but that. It drew much of its nourishment from popular sources and aimed, above all, at ending the hegemony of art that was either elitist by virtue of patronage or audience, or bourgeois by virtue of its standards and conventions. The cabaret's nose-thumbing at contemporary art and society gave\n\nxvffi\n\nIntroduction\n\nprominence to forms of Kleinkunst such as the chanson, the marionette and shadow show, and the short parodie play, which came to enjoy virtually universal cultivation wherever cabaret existed. But as cabaret spread, forms initially given their greatest impetus by the Parisian experience, such as the chanson—which was not everywhere assimilable with the same ease—were modified by local traditions and augmented by forms more characteristic of the indigenous culture. Although cabarets outside of Paris took the Parisian Chat Noir as their point of departure and often resembled each other in theme and style, the most renowned were shaped by, and accommodated, phenomena of distinctly local character. Thus, whatever the links between them and frequent similarities, no two were alike either in focus or formal preferences. This was very much the case with the chanson, which was widely imitated throughout Europe but rarely successfully. The great revival of the genre in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century France—to which its vigorous espousal by the Parisian cabaret contributed so importantly—had demonstrably French social, economic, and political stimuli. Cultivated especially by poets who came out of the antibourgeois, anti-establishment Bohème of the time and who were no strangers to poverty and human wretchedness, the chansons often sought to jar and shock by their pictures of urban misery, crime, and social injustice. Collectively representing a poetry of both the underworld and the \"other world\" of a Paris of want and degradation from which the well-fed and well-dressed chose to turn their eyes, the turn-of-the-century chansons had such a high degree of French, and Parisian, specificity that they crossed national boundaries only with considerable difficulty. Satire and parody were also forged into effective weapons in the cabaret offensive against pretensiousness in high culture, smugness in society, and conservatism in politics. There was hardly a turn-of-the-century cabaret in which the reigning literary modes of naturalism and symbolism were not deflated, above all by means of parody. The principal targets were the acknowledged high priests of European naturalism, neoromanticism, and symbolism: the German Gerhart Hauptmann (1862-1946), whose drama about Silesian weavers, Die Weber (The Weavers, 1892), written originally in Silesian dialect, was regarded as the acme of European Naturalist drama, the Italian Gabriele D'Annunzio (1863-1938), viewed as ludicrous for his highly theatrical neoromantic posturing, and\n\nIntroduction\n\nxix\n\nthe Belgian Maurice Maeterlinck (1862-1949), an easy butt of cabaret parody for his eerie otherworldliness and exaggerated solemnity. In the strongly theatrically oriented cabarets of prerevolutionary Moscow and St. Petersburg, for example, satire and parody also took aim at such universal targets as Hauptmann, D'Annunzio, and Maeterlinck, but reserved their sharpest bite for such domestic phenomena as the widely esteemed but philosophically shallow playwright and prose writer Leonid Andreev (1871-1919) and for the Moscow Art Theater, respected abroad but at home regarded as a bastion of naturalism. Significantly, some of the leading figures in early twentieth-century Russian cabaret— the directors Vsevolod Meyerhold (1870-1940) and Nikolai Evreinov (1879-1953) and the critic Aleksandr Kugel (1864-1928)—were in the forefront of the campaign to resolve the contemporary \"crisis\" of the Russian stage by ending the hegemony of the imperial theater system, on the one hand, and the dominance of Stanislavsky's ultra-naturalistic methods of production and system of acting, on the other. Although conventionally not so regarded, the prerevolutionary Russian cabaret deserves to be accorded an important role in the movement to breathe fresh life into the stodgy Russian theater of the period by championing the cause of theatricality, or \"re-theatricalized\" theater. Disaffection toward, at times outright defiance of, the established social and political order frequently accompanied repudiation of the established order in art. In the face of stern Prussian and Bavarian state censorship, the Berlin and Munich cabarets of the turn-of-the-century period had to be ever mindful of the programs they assembled, even when, as in the case especially of the Munich Elf Scharfrichter (Eleven Executioners), the most famous pre-World War I cabaret in all Germany, the private club status of the cabaret was as much an attempt to circumvent police surveillance as to preserve the ambience of an authentic circle of artists. Despite this need for caution, and the pressure of state and community against it, the early German cabaret articulated concern not only over the situation in contemporary art, but over numbing social conservatism, especially in the Bavarian context, and over the specter of rising nationalism and militarism embodied, above all, in Prussian ambitions and policies. In attempting to assert its right to challenge authority, the Munich cabaret hastened its own demise. At the same time, however, it paved the way for the dynamic cabaret\n\nXX\n\nIntroduction\n\nculture of Weimar Germany whose fame rested, in large measure, on the extent to which it functioned as a microcosm of the sharpening social, economic, and political tensions of the 1920s and '30s. Social rather than political conservatism engaged the satiric and parodie energies of the artists who established and frequented the most important cabaret of turn-of-the-century Poland, the Zielony Balonik (Green Balloon). Located in the old Polish capital of Cracow, in that part of Poland that had fallen to Austria in the Partitions of the late eighteenth century, the Green Balloon had even less latitude with respect to political satire than the contemporary German or Austrian cabarets. Always watchful for signs of nationalism among its Slavic minorities, especially the Poles, the imperial Hapsburg authorities kept close tabs on private undertakings such as cabarets, making it virtually impossible for the pre-World War I Polish cabaret to mount anything capable of being construed, or misconstrued, as an offense or challenge to Hapsburg authority. But despite this limitation, the Cracow cabaret, which was the most outstanding in Eastern Europe at the time, still found ample material for its programs in the conservatism and class-consciousness of Cracow and the paradoxical situation in which the tradition-bound ancient capital then found itself as the reluctant seat of a vigorous turn-of-the-century modernist movement referred to as \"Young Poland.\" By and large supportive of modernism, the Cracow cabaret assigned itself the role of admonishing excesses in the development of this modernism just as it held up to ridicule the smug conservatism so vehemently opposed to it. The close association of cabaret with progressive developments in the arts in Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was demonstrated on more than a single occasion. The Barcelona cabaret Els Quatre Gats (The Four Cats) and the later Vienna Fledermaus (Bat) enjoyed an even more intimate relationship with modernism than the Polish Green Balloon. In the case of the Cracow cabaret, a certain distance, even detachment, was kept as much from \"Young Poland\" modernism as from traditional Cracow conservatism. This way, the cabaret could feel free to aim its satiric barbs wherever it chose. The situation was different, however, in both Barcelona and Vienna. The most famous cabaret in Spanish history, Els Quatre Gats, was established by Catalonian artists who had spent time in France and identified with the new currents in French art. They had also become part of contemporary Parisian bohemian life as well as the world of the Montmartre cabaret.\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxi\n\nWhen they returned to their native Catalonia, they were determined to advance the cause of modernist art, above all of a native Catalonian modernist painting—which included a figure such as Pablo Picasso—and toward this end founded the first cabaret in Barcelona on the model of the Parisian Chat Noir which they knew firsthand. Moreover, the promotion of Catalonian modernism by artists of the caliber of Santiago Rusiñol (1861-1931), Miquel Utrillo (1862-1934), the father of Maurice Utrillo, and Ramon Casas (1866-1932) became an integral aspect of the ardent championship of an emerging Catalonian nationalism. The late nineteenth century witnessed a resurgence of Catalonian political and cultural nationalism after a long period of repression and slumber. Identifying Catalonian modernism as a valuable component of a nationalist movement aimed at a restoration and enhancement of regional privileges within the framework of the Spanish administrative system, the Barcelona cabaret placed itself in the forefront of the most artistically and politically significant development in modern Catalonian history. Located in the capital of the Hapsburg Empire, the Vienna cabaret lacked the nationalist dimension of the Quatre Gats of Barcelona. But its place in the evolution of a preeminent Austrian modernism was also important. At first an offshoot of the then defunct Munich Elf Scharfrichter, the Vienna cabaret took a little while to find its authentic Viennese identity. When it did, in the Fledermaus, the most brilliant of Viennese cabarets, it attracted the talents of almost every major artist of the period—the writers Karl Kraus, Hugo von Hofmannstahl, Hermann Bahr, Alfred Polgar, and Egon Friedeil, the painters Gustav Klimt and Emil Orlik, the painter and dramatist Oskar Kokoschka, the caricaturist Carl Hollitzer, the graphic artist Berthold Löffler, the architects Adolf Loos and Josef Hoffmann, the stage and costume designers R. Josef Divéky, Kolo Moser, E. J. Wimmer-Wisgrill, and Fritz Zeymer, the dancers Gertrude Barrison and the Wiesenthal sisters. Apart from reflecting the ascendancy of the Vienna Secession, the Fledermaus cabaret drew heavily on the talents of artists associated with the vibrant school of Viennese applied art, the Wiener Werkstätte (Vienna Workshops), becoming not just an outlet for the Werkstätte, but, to all intents and purposes, an extension of them. Furthermore, the production of Kokoschka's little play Sphinx und Strohmann (Sphinx and Strawman) by the Fledermaus in 1909 gave the cabaret a place in the development of German-language Expressionist drama.\n\nxxfi Introduction Although cabarets such as those in Cracow, Barcelona, and Vienna bore a close relationship to modernism in their respective countries, the Zurich Cabaret Voltaire, which was established by artists from other countries who were seeking a safe haven from the horrors of the World War, enjoys a special renown in the history of twentieth-century art as the birthplace of the Dada movement. The Cabaret Voltaire is the last to be dealt with in this book, both because it was the last major cabaret to appear before the end of the war and because it was the most extreme, the most revolutionary in its assault on the conventions and traditions of the bourgeois nineteenth century. In the bizarre violence of its mockery and rejection of the past, the Cabaret Voltaire became the logical culmination of the entire turn-of-the-century cabaret movement. No aspect of nineteenth-century society, no genre or style of traditional art was spared the lashes of Dadaist rebuke, and when rational discourse, language, and even meaning were brought under attack it was obvious that the turn-of-the-century European cabaret had played its role well in that transformation of sensibility that laid the groundwork for the avantgarde of the twentieth century. The art of the cabaret was previously characterized as an art of \"small forms.\" But the cabaret itself ought to be viewed as a \"small form\" art, a phenomenon of European cultural development which arose in a period of transition when a breakup, a fragmentation of the traditional structures of nineteenth-century art both accompanied and heralded the emergence of the avant-garde. Characteristic of this dismantling of the forms of nineteenth-century art, which paralleled the enthusiasm of turn-of-the-century artists and intellectuals for a dismantling of society itself, was a clear preference for smaller forms. Indeed, to speak of a decided tendency toward miniaturization would not at all be wide of the mark. This cultivation of small forms expressed itself in phenomena already marked: the chanson, the puppet, marionette, and shadow show, all of which could be easily accommodated by, and in fact were designed for, miniature stages; one-act plays and dramatic sketches, monologues, and so on. Elsewhere, the growing taste for small forms was reflected in a new interest in chamber music, in the spread of the little theater movement (the establishment of small chamber, or intimate theaters), in the loosening of novel and play structure through a type of segmentation in which unity gives way to the looser linkage ot smaller, relatively more autonomous units, in the emergence of the feuilleton, the witty and pithy\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxffi\n\njournalistic essay on any subject of interest to the author, so handsomely represented in Austria, for example, by such writers as Theodor Herzl (1860-1904), Herman Bahr (1863-1934), and Alfred Polgar (187319SS), and in the cultivation of highly laconic writing, which typified the style of one of the outstanding characters in the turn-of-the-century Vienna cabaret, the archetypical bohemian Peter Altenberg (1899-1919), and reached the level of a reductio ad absurdum in the theory and practice of the Italian Futurists in the teens of the present century; it was in the programmatic II teatro futurista sintetico (The Futuristic Synthetic Theater, 1915), after all, that its authors, Marinetti, Settimelli, and Cora, declared that \"É stupido scrivere cento pagine dove ne basterebbe una\" (It's stupid to write a hundred pages where one would suffice).3 In a period when accelerated change in many spheres of life intensified impatience with conventions and traditions now considered hindrances to progress, a restlessness with grand artistic designs and, in literature, with verbiage and stately periods would not have been unusual. A sense of imminent sweeping change, of tumultuous upheaval, also gave rise to a sense of impermanence. The result was not only the cultivation of laconicism, but of ephemerality as well, all epitomized in the art of the cabaret and in the cabaret itself as an art form. With few exceptions, the turn-of-the-century cabarets were short-lived, as transient as much of the art they presented. Adding to this sense of transience and expendability was their almost universal disavowal of commitment in art, a clear rejection of the social, moral, and other obligations imposed on art throughout the nineteenth century. To the cabaretists of the turn-of-thecentury, art could best free itself from the tyranny of commitment by vigorously asserting its right to purposelessness, its freedom not to have meaning in any conventionally representational sense, its legitimacy as play. In its rejection of authority, its defiance of convention and tradition, its pursuit of the small and the fleeting, its eschewal of commitment, its spirit of play, the cabaret of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was thus far more than a marginal diversion of the time. It could be viewed as the very symbol of those forces of change in sense and sensibility out of which the new art of the twentieth century was born. A word now about the organization of this book. As an account of the emergence and spread of cabaret in turn-of-the-century Europe, it fol-\n\nxxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nlows a logical chronological progression: it begins with the establishment of the first cabaret, the Chat Noir, in Paris in 1881, then traces the subsequent development of the cabaret movement throughout Europe, ending with the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich in 1916-1917. As the birthplace of Dada, the Cabaret Voltaire is seen as the watershed reached by the development of the turn-of-the-century cabaret as an intimate, elitist, largely nonprofessional .minimally commercial, and artistically experimental performance environment. Cabaret continued to grow and even to flourish after World War I; in one form or another, it has survived to our own time. But with the exception of certain post-World War II cabarets, mostly student undertakings and notably in Germany and East Central Europe (where they arose primarily as a form of protest), the cabaret culture that developed after World War I became increasingly more commercial. Whatever the quality of the entertainment offered and however interesting as a mirror of (and outlet for) contemporary social and political antagonisms, as in internar Germany (and so well depicted in the film Cabaret of 1972), the cabaret ceased to be the embodiment of a changing sensibility, the manifest anticipation of a new art, of the avant-garde. When cabaret first emerged in turn-of-the-century Europe, in most instances on the initiative of artists themselves, it was an outgrowth of farreaching transition in society and art; not only did it reflect and participate in that transition, it emerged from it as perhaps the most characteristic form of a dissolution of old structures which necessarily preceded the advent of the new. When that period of transition, that process of change had run its course and the old Europe of the nineteenth century had gone to its destruction in the hell fires of the first \"world\" war, the cabaret, as it existed in the turn-of-the-century, had also run its course. That it would continue to exist on the foundation of what had been built in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was certainly to be expected; but that later cabaret would not be, indeed could not be, what it had been before should also come as no surprise. For the sake of thoroughness, I would have liked, of course, to cover every significant manifestation of cabaret in turn-of-the-century Europe; however, that would have been patently out of the question, and not only for reasons of space. The cabarets included for discussion were not only the most important in their respective cultures, but among the most vibrant and interesting in Europe as a whole. Both necessity and selectivity governed my choices. Apart from Paris, Barcelona, Berlin, Munich,\n\nIntroduction xxv Vienna, Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Zurich demanded inclusion for reasons of importance and representativeness. With respect to East Central Europe, my preference was for the most outstanding cabaret of one particular country, since coverage of the development of cabaret in such cities as Cracow, Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest would have made the final book grossly imbalanced. My choice fell on Cracow, on the Green Balloon, for several reasons: my strong personal interest in Polish culture, the earlier establishment and relatively greater significance of cabaret in Poland than elsewhere in East Central Europe, its curious relationship to its environment, its place in the development of Polish modernism, and the role played in it by one of the most engaging personalities of twentieth-century Polish literature, Dr. Tadeusz ¿eleñski (\"Boy,\" 1874-1941). Among major European cultures, England and Italy may seem surprisingly absent. Italy, in fact, had no significant turn-of-the-century cabaret—a fact acknowledged by the Enciclopedia dello spettacolo (Encyclopedia of the Stage)4—possibly because of cultural decentralization and regionalism and a relationship between artist and society that would have encouraged far more public forms of confrontation than cabaret. Moreover, the place of cabaret was taken, to a considerable extent, in my judgment, by the Futurist movement initiated by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (1876-1944) in 1909. In its defiant, outrageous demolition of the conventional and traditional, its assault on the expectations and sensibilities of audiences, its embrace of novelty, its emphasis on speed and brevity (simultaneità), its advocacy of variety theater as the model for a new art of the stage, and its cultivation of small forms (the sintesi, or extremely short theatrical work, for example), futurism shared much in common with the turn-of-the-century cabaret. The Futurists also represented a type of community of artists bound together by a similarity of outlook and goals. If the Futurists performed for the most part in public places, the better to outrage their audiences, their serate, or \"evenings,\" often had something of the quality of cabaret programs. Cabaret came relatively late to England, and never seemed to enjoy the eager embrace of the form characteristic of its reception on the Continent. It was also alien from its very inception, another factor possibly contributing to its self-consciousness and tentativeness. The first English cabaret, called the Cabaret Theatre Club or the Cave of the Golden Calf, was opened in June 1912 by Frida (or Freda) Strindberg, the Swed-\n\nxxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nish dramatist's second wife, an Austrian journalist whose maiden name was Maria Friedrike Cornelia Uhi (1872-1943). A f t e r the breakup both of her marriage to Strindberg and her liaison with the German poet, dramatist, and cabaretist Frank Wedekind (1864-1918)—from whom her interest in cabaret may well have derived—Frida Uhi Strindberg settled in London between 1910 and the approach of World War I, when she left for what proved to be a short stay in the United States. While in London, she established the Cabaret Theatre Club as a \"modernist nightclub,\" in part motivated by an obsessive desire to stage Strindberg's plays in the English capital. A m o n g the artists who helped decorate the premises of the Cave on H e d d o n Street, off Regent, were the sculptor Sir Jacob Epstein (1880-1959), the portrait painter Augustus John (1878-1961), with whom the ever romantic Frida had an affair, 5 and the avant-garde painter and writer W y n d h a m Lewis (1882-1957)—another, this time unsuccessful, target of M a d a m e Strindberg's affections—a close associate of Ezra Pound and the f o u n d e r of vorticism, a movement in art similar in certain respects to cubism and futurism. Wyndham Lewis, who painted the Club's murals (in what Violet Hunt calls \"raw meat designs\") 6 and also designed a brochure for it, 7 offers this description of its founding in his Rude Assignment: Strinberg [sic], the Swedish dramatist, had a number of wives, one being a Viennese. This very adventurous woman . . . rented an enormous basement. Hence the term \"Cave.\" She had it suitably decorated with murals by myself, and number of columns by Jacob Epstein: hired an orchestra—with a frenzied Hungarian gypsy fiddler to lead it—a smart corps of Austrian waiters and an Austrian cook: then with considerable amount of press-promotion she opened as a night-club. With the Epstein figures appearing to hold up the threateningly low ceiling, the somewhat abstract hieroglyphics I had painted round the walls, the impassioned orchestra, it must have provided a kick or two for the young man about town of the moment. It was my first job . . . I did not receive a great deal for my night-club murals (actually £60). I was quite unknown, however, and would have done them for nothing. 8\n\nClearly designed as a nightclub principally for the artists Frida Strindberg enjoyed cultivating rather than as a cabaret, in any strict sense, the Cave of the G o l d e n Calf offered intimacy in an ambience of art where dining and dancing seemed to take precedence over any entertainments presented. T h e writer Sir Osbert Sitwell, a frequent visitor to the Cave, confirms its character in his autobiographical Great Morning:\n\nIntroduction xxvfi the Cabaret Club, where the lesser artists of the theatre, as well as the greater, mixed with painters, writers, and their opposite, officers in the Brigade of Guards. This low-ceilinged night club, appropriately sunk below the pavement of Beak Street, and hideously but relevantly frescoed by the then mature Wyndham Lewis, appeared in the small hours to be a super-heated vorticist garden of gesticulating figures, dancing and talking, while the rhythm of the primitive forms of ragtime throbbed through the wide room. . . . Dancing more than conversation was the art which occupied the young men of the time in the Cabaret Club (I had taken with ease and delight to modem ballroom dancing).9 From a copy of the program 10 as well as from contemporary accounts, the Cave of the Golden Calf evidently did retain something of the character of a turn-of-the-century cabaret. Dances of different types, songs, including German lieder, \"gypsy folklore,\" and \"amateur plays\" were presented. 11 So, too, were shadow shows, as we learn from a draft of a letter of Wyndam Lewis to the artist Cuthbert Hamilton dated Paris 1913: I was concerned the other day at your ruffled state during the shadow-picture bustle. I hope that beastly Cabaret, that has been the cause of so many ridiculous vexations to me, is not going to add lessening of our good camaraderie to the number of its senseless misdeeds.12 The ubiquitous Marinetti, who also was to carry the banners of futurism to the St. Petersburg cabaret Brodyachaya sobaka (The Stray Dog) in early 1914, visited London frequently between 1912 and 1914 and graced the Cave of the Golden Calf with his presence in the fall of 1913. Wyndham Lewis describes the occasion briefly in a letter to Mrs. Percy Harris: \"I was sorry you did not come to the Cabaret Club last night, as Marinetti declaimed some particularly bloodthirsty concoctions with great dramatic force.\" 13 Marinetti's more important appearances in London took place, however, not at the Cave, but at the Doré Galleries— which was a far more significant center of avant-garde art at the time— where he held forth on November 20, 1913, and again several times during 1914. Thus, England, too, was affected by the cabaret fever to which the rest of Europe succumbed from 1881 to 1916. But whatever the participation in its activities by the likes of Sir Jacob Epstein, Augustus John, and Wyndham Lewis, the Cave of the Golden Calf never came to assume the place in contemporary art and society that the major cabarets of the Continent did. Whether because of her personality and foreign background,\n\nxxvffi\n\nIntroduction\n\nor because of the timidity and nonconfrontational nature of the English avant-garde of the time, Frida Strindberg's Cabaret Theatre Club— which lasted only as long as she remained in London to preside over it— faded away with little resonance, hardly more than a footnote in the history of twentieth-century English culture. Two final technical notes about the book. Where good translations of non-English-language materials were available, I have chosen to use them for the sake of convenience; otherwise, all translations are my own except where indicated. Additionally, transliteration from Russian in the chapter on the Moscow and St. Petersburg cabaret conforms to a common, if imperfect, transliteration system.\n\nILLUSTRATIONS\n\nFaçade of the Chat Noir in its second home on the Rue de Laval (now Rue Victor-Massé), drawing by Paul Merwart, ca. 1887 22 Aristide Bruant, poster by Toulouse-Lautrec\n\n50\n\nAristide Bruant, lithograph by Toulouse-Lautrec\n\n52\n\nIllustration for Aristide Bruant's Dans la Rue by Théophile Steinlen 55 Illustration for Aristide Bruant's Dans la Rue by Théophile Steinlen 62 Illustration for Aristide Bruant's \"Crâneuse\" by Théophile Steinlen 65 Drawing by Paul Merwart of audience at Chat Noir viewing a shadow play 70 Cover of brochure of Chat Noir centenary exhibition published by the Musée de Montmartre 82 Exterior view of the Casa Martí in which Els Quatre Gats was located 91 Intenor view of Els Quatre Gats showing painting by Ramon Casas 93 The ouppet stage of Els Quatre Gats\n\n94\n\nDraving by Ricardo Opisso, ca. 1900, showing a group of Els Quatre Gats habitués 95 Picasso lithograph of a Quatre Gats advertisement originally designed as a menu cover 98\n\nXXX Illustrations Picasso drawing of a group of Els Quatre Gats regulars seated at a table 100 Quatre Gats puppet show poster drawn by Ramon Casas Els Quatre Gats poster drawn by Ramon Casas Caricature of Ernst von Wolzogen by Paul Rieth\n\n102\n\n117 124\n\nElf Scharfrichter program cover by Arpad Schmidhammer depicting the \"Executioners\" in their opening dance 148 Elf Scharfrichter program cover with caricature silhouette of Marya Delvard by Thomas Theodor Heine 150 Elf Scharfrichter program cover with caricature of Ernst von Wolzogen as a cabaret performer 156 Caricature of Frank Wedekind performing at the Elf Scharfrichter by Ernst Stern 160 Elf Scharfrichter program cover by Olaf Gulbranson\n\n175\n\nThe Fledermaus auditorium in a postcard designed by the Wiener Werkstätte 191 The Fledermaus foyer and bar\n\n193\n\nA view of the foyer and cloakroom of the Fledermaus in a postcard designed by the Wiener Werkstätte 195 Peter Altenberg (on the right) with the architect Adolf Loos in a 1933 photograph 201 Cabaret Fledermaus program cover\n\n204\n\nCabaret Fledermaus program cover\n\n212\n\nThe Vienna cabaret dancer Gertrude Barrison, in a 1919 photograph 216 Interior view of the Zielony Balonik (Green Balloon)\n\n227\n\nInterior view of the Zielony Balonik (Green Balloon)\n\n228\n\nZielony Balonik (Green Balloon) invitation\n\n231\n\nIllustrations xxxl\n\nZielony Balonik (Green Balloon) invitation\n\n236\n\nPhotograph of the szopka used in Zielony Balonik (Green Balloon) puppet shows 248 Zielony Balonik (Green Balloon) invitation showing szopka and puppet figures 249 Zielony Balonik (Green Balloon) invitation with caricatures of szopka rod puppet figures 252 Nikita Baliev, the founder of the Moscow Letuchaya mysh (Bat) 260 The Moscow Bat in Hollywood.

From its opening in 1881 until its closing in 1897—a longevity itself remarkable in the history of the cabaret—it was a landmark of Montmartre, as familiar a part of the landscape of that then rustic village on the hill overlooking Paris as its windmills. The great success of the Chat Noir, as often happens, inspired a number of imitations in fin-de-siècle Paris giving rise to a veritable cabaret fever. But whatever success any of them achieved—and there were a few, like Aristide Bruant's Le Mirliton (The Reed Pipe), that came to enjoy much renown in their time—none developed the mystique of the Chat Noir. To the Parisian of the time and the many foreigners who sought it out on their visits to Paris, the Chat Noir was cabaret and cabaret was the Chat Noir. The circle of artists who made up the cabaret were hardly unaware of the legend of which they were rapidly becoming a part and seldom missed an opportunity to enhance it. It was partly for that reason, for example, that the cabaret began to publish its own weekly magazine appropriately called Le Chat Noir, on January 14, 1882, less than a year after the cabaret itself had been established. Mainly as an outlet for literary compositions by writers associated with the cabaret, the magazine appeared every Saturday at a price of 15 centimes. Before long, Le Cha! Noir, which consisted of only a few pages, was as successful in its own way as the parent cabaret; its title page illustration of a huge black cat, tail held high, its head cocked at a wry angle against the background of Montmartre and its windmills—the most prominent of which bears the\n\n2\n\nParis: Black Cats and Reed Pipes\n\nname of the popular dance hall La Moulin de la Galette—became a familiar sight in the kiosks and cafés of Paris. In addition to literary compositions by contemporary writers and those of past generations viewed as kindred spirits, Le Chat Noir also carried occasional articles about doings in Montmartre, of which it considered itself the voice, and about the Chat Noir cabaret. In its issue of May 27, 1882, a humorous announcement appeared which says much about the legend that had begun to grow up about the cabaret and the way the Chat Noir took delight in fostering its own image. Under the heading \"Justice Has Been Done,\" the announcement proceeds to inform in mock-serious tone that By a huge majority, the Chamber of Deputies has declared the Cabaret of the Black Cat of public worth and has added it to the number of historical monuments of France. This unique thing in the world will thus not have to endure the ravages of time. The prefect of the Seine has received the order to isolate this cabaret in the middle of a square planted with exotic trees on which poets could hang their lyres. This cabaret is the most Astonishing, Wondrous, Bizarre, Magnificent, Astounding, Vibrant Creation of ages that have long since fallen to the Scythe of Time. Founded by Julius Caesar, one can behold it in the glasses with which were served Charlemagne, Villon, Rabelais, Cardinal Richelieu, the Duchess de Chevreuse, Mme. de Rambouillet, Mlle, de Scudery, Louis XIV, Mme. de la Vallière, Voltaire, Diderot, Robespierre, Bonaparte, Mme. de Staël and Mme. Récamier, Baudelaire, Baour-Lormain, George Sand, Sapeck, Goudeau. Ask to see the lyre of Victor Hugo and the sonorous lute of Charles Pitou and Clovis Hugues, the pockmarked poet. 1\n\nIts tongue-in-cheek bombast and humor notwithstanding, the Chat Noir had indeed become something of a national monument. That its success far exceeded even the lofty aspirations of its founder, Rodolphe Salis (1852-1897), goes without saying. The son of a conservative and mildly prosperous distiller in Châtellerault, in the Department of Vienne, Salis decided as a young man that his future lay in art, for which he displayed some talent, rather than in the family distillery business. Despite the stern objections of his father, for whom the career of a painter lacked respectability, young Rodolphe was firm in his resolve to pursue his muse. Consequently, he left Châtellerault to study painting in Paris at the Ecole des BeauxArts. With only a little money from his mother to support him (200\n\nParis: Black Cats and Reed Pipes\n\n3\n\nfrancs, to be exact), Salis had to work while pursuing his studies. He managed to earn modest sums by painting landscapes for a dealer named Borniche who bought cheap and sold high, mostly to Americans, or mass producing, together with three friends in similar financial straits, \"Stations of the Cross\" paintings for a store selling religious objects in the vicinity of the Saint-Sulpice.2 The later enterprise was concealed beneath a cloak of artistic integrity in the form of a school of art called \"l'École Vibrant\" \"founded\" by Salis for the purpose of reforming pictorial art; hardly was the \"school\" founded than its name was changed from \"l'École Vibrant\" to the more fanciful \"École Iriso-Subversive de Chicago.\" The change of name did nothing, alas, to improve the financial position of Salis and his comrades-in-brush. The market for religious paintings, particularly the sort turned out by the \"École Vibrant\" / \"École Iriso-Subversive de Chicago,\" was then sluggish and before too much time elapsed the whole enterprise was dropped and the four-way partnership dissolved. Desperate for funds, Salis returned to his native Châtellerault in the hope that time had healed all wounds and his father might now look more benevolently upon his errant son. But the old man proved as stubborn as ever and were it not for the limited largesse of his mother, Salis would have left with nary a sou. The visit produced another gain in the form of a local beauty who agreed to become his wife. But the fair Hélène was of frail constitution and unable to withstand the rigors and privations of her husband's bohemian life style in Paris. Her failing health necessitated a return visit to Châtellerault by a now desperate Salis wholly dependent on his family for the money needed to provide proper care for his wife. It was too late, however, and Hélène, whom he had left behind in Paris while he was away, died. What followed now for Salis was a period of mourning, a tour of military service during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, and a prodigal-like conciliatory reunion in Châtellerault with père Salis who at last agreed to help his son with the proviso that he remarry and find some \"useful\" occupation. Bowing perhaps to the inevitable, Salis accepted his father's terms, renouncing painting and becoming affianced to a red-haired beauty of property whom he had met in the house of his parents. Following his marriage in the town hall of Montmartre on the Rue des Abbesses in 1880 and the setting up of a modest household on the Rue Germaine-Pilon, Salis again had to wrestle with the problem of how to\n\n4 París: Black Cats and Reed Pipes earn a living. He finally decided to open a café, a decision his distiller father rejoiced at when he heard the news. Salis' ambitions at first were modest. What he probably had in mind was a small drinking place that would attract customers primarily because of its décor, something along the lines of the popular artists' wateringhole, the Cabaret de la Grande Pinte, on the Avenue Trudaine. The location on which he finally settled was a tiny shop at 84 Boulevard Rochechouart which had been used as a post office but was now vacant and up for rental at a price of 1,400 francs a year. The principal attraction of the vest-pocket former post office seems to have been the fact that it just happened to be very near the Grande Pinte. Competition, it seems, was much on Salis' mind. While pondering what to call his establishment, Salis happened upon a short-haired black cat perched atop a street lamp. He took the cat home with him and then hit on the idea of naming his café after it. Thus was the Chat Noir born. A picture of the cat painted by the artist Adolphe Willette, whom Salis had met in Montmartre and was on friendly terms with, was hung in the café's window. 3 Once a name for his establishment had been settled, Salis next addressed the matter of décor. He wanted something unusual, something that would appeal especially to the artists he hoped would become \"regulars\" at the Chat Noir. What he eventually decided upon was what he liked to call \"Louis XIII style.\" The walls were hung with time-worn tapestries; covers from old chests were used to fashion a kind of cashier's box above which hung a huge golden sun with shining rays, which might have been acquired from the demolition of some church; huge nails served as coat hooks. On the right side of the room stood an enormous fireplace with a mantelpiece full of copper objects, pewter mugs, and antique pitchers. The hearth contained kitchen firedogs with pothangers one of which was used as a perch for a crow named Bazouge which Willette had brought back from Trouville. 4 As legend has it, the crow lasted only a few months, dying from excess consumption of absinthe and bitter Picon. Further description of the interior of the Chat Noir comes from the pen of the poet Émile Goudeau (1872-1943) whose role in the establishment and success of the cabaret was, in its own way, even greater than that of Salis: On a corner of the counter stood a bust, the \"Unknown Woman\" of the Louvre, and above it an enormous cat's head surrounded by golden rays such as one sees\n\nParís: Black Cats and Reed Pipes\n\n5\n\nin churches around the symbolic triangle. In back, a second smaller room three steps higher had its own belt, equal to a man's height, of diamantine panels highlighting the tapestries above which the famous nails of the \"Passion\" supported old flintlocks and obsolete swords; the high fireplace—which fortunately bore little resemblance to the other one—replaced the antique knickknacks with a cheerful and quite modern stoker at which aim was taken by a semicircle of the feet of the painters and sculptors who sought out the place first as well as by those also of the poets and musicians who lost no time in arriving—following in the footsteps of us \"Hydropathes.\" 5\n\nThe Hydropathes The \"Hydropathes\" mentioned by Goudeau were a loose circle of artists (mostly poets), headed by Goudeau himself and formally called the \"Club des Hydropathes. 6 It was they who first brought fame to the Chat Noir and attracted other artists to follow them there. Goudeau had come to Paris from his native Périgueux in 1879 and settled in the Latin Quarter, which was then the center of the Parisian literary and academic Bohème. While employed as a supernumerary at the Ministry of Finance he pursued an active career as a poet, scoring a success with his first book of poems, Les Fleurs de bitume (Flowers of Asphalt), for which Anatole France, among others, had high praise. What distinguished Goudeau from many of the other young poets who made their home in or frequented the Latin Quarter in the 1870s and '80s was a certain organizational talent and drive. Dissatisfied with the itinerant life style of Latin Quarter poets who moved restlessly from one café to another, Goudeau had the idea of forming a literary circle that would come together more or less regularly in some places where they could declaim their poetry in a freedom and privacy unavailable in the cafés. The first \"home\" of the as yet unnamed circle was the first floor premises of the Café de la Rive-Gauche located at the corner of the Rue Cujas and the Boulevard Saint-Michel. Arrangements were worked out with the owner of the café permitting Goudeau and company to have exclusive use of the premises one evening a week in exchange for a guarantee of a minimum of twenty persons; the proprietor wanted to be sure, after all, that the privacy he was making available would not entail too much of a financial sacrifice. The first gathering of the group with not the minimura twenty but sixty people in attendance took place on Friday, October 11, 1878. It was on this occasion that the circle formally adopted the\n\n6 Paris: Black Cats and Reed Pipes name Le Club des Hydropathes, which was suggested by Goudeau, and nominated Goudeau himself its first president. As to what the Club des Hydropathes represented and the origin of the name \"Hydropathes\" Goudeau provided explanations in a retrospective article in the paper Le Matin on December 13, 1899: It was a noisy and merry association of young men from the Latin Quarter: poets, musicians, painters, actors, and students. They were twenty years old; it was twenty years ago. . . . This association with its bizarre name had an original idea for that time: to bring together around poets declaiming their verse, around musicians performing their songs, a numerous group of free auditors. . . . The founders of the \"Hydropathes\" appealed to the crowd, and the crowd came. . . . One evening in October 1878 . . . some musicians and poets came together to chat about art and sing songs alongside a piano in the small room of a large café, until a group of schoolboys who were on their way to regain the school invaded the place and demolished three quarters of the unfortunate harpsichord. After they left, we resolved, my friends and I, to insist that the proprietor grant us the place entirely to ourselves. Seeing that there were only five of us, the fellow told us that he was unable to do us such a favor except on the condition that there were at least about twenty of us . . . \"for the sake of consumption,\" he added. The next day, there were sixty young people and the day after, one hundred and fifty. O glory! It was an impossible meeting. Naturally, we set up an office. I had the honor of being named president. And then when the question arose as to what name to give this association that came into being so vigorously, various ones were proposed. But, exercising my presidential prerogative, I caused the perhaps incomprehensible but resounding name of \"Hydropathe\" to emerge victorious in the final vote. And now, if you would like to know what \"hydropathe\" means, here is the answer. In the ministry where I was attached—badly attached at that—I had acquired the nickname of \"hydropathe,\" because of the fact that for several days, as loudly as possible, I had asked the meaning of the German word Hydropathen which was the title of a waltz by maestro [Joseph] Gung'l, Hydropathen Waltz, which was played often in those days. When I succeeded in giving this name to our association. I pretended to believe that it was the name of some legendary animal that is supposed to have had crystal paws: pathen [paws—HBS]; hydro: of crystallized water. It was just whimsy and I had fun with it. 7 Perhaps with the passage of time Goudeau had become more modest about the origin of the name Hydropathes. Otherwise, it seems rather unlikely that even twenty years later, in the piece in Le Matin, he had forgotten that when the Hydropathes issued their own journal, called\n\nParís: Black Cats and Reed Pipes\n\n7\n\nL'Hydropathe, the first number of January 22,1879, contained a lead article by Goudeau himself on the etymology of the name \"Hydropathe.\" The humorous pseudoetymology, which is too long to quote here, traces the origin of his own family name from the Stone Age down to the nineteenth century in order to demonstrate that the word \"hydropathe\" derived from a Greek analogy (udor patain) to his own patronymic which early in history had been Govd-Eav but eventually was corrupted into Goud-Eau by municipal officials, finally becoming simply Goudeau. But to those to whom the drinking habits of Goudeau and his friends were well known, the true source of \"hydropathe\" lay in the ironic reading of the poet's name as \"goût d'eau\" (taste for water). The large, heterogeneous membership of the Club des Hydropathes included musicians, painters, monologuists, déclamateurs, and literary types of one sort or another in addition to poets. Many have long since been forgotten, now just entries in French literary dictionaries; in their time, several were among the most highly regarded and popular writers and chansonniers (composers and singers of chansons) in the Latin Quarter; others were to enjoy their greatest fame in the era of the Chat Noir and its epigones. The ranks of Hydropathes poets included, besides Goudeau, Albert Samain, Georges Lorin, a poet, painter, and sculptor who soon assumed editorship of the L'Hydropathe journal, the Greek Jean Moréas (real name, Vannis Papadiamantopolous), the prolific Jean Richepin, the still highly regarded Maurice Rollinat, Charles Cros, the inventor of a phonograph slightly before Edison and a close friend of Rimbaud and Verlaine, André Gill, Paul Marrot, Maurice Bouchor, Gaston Sénéchal, and Edmond Haraucourt; the principal chansonniers were Jules Jouy and Maurice Mac-Nab, eventually to be acknowledged as two of the outstanding artists of the turn-of-the-century French chanson. Alphonse Allais (1854-1905), whose popularity as a writer of humorous stories lasted long after his death, was the group's leading fumiste, which French dictionaries generally define as a jokester, but which can also mean a teller of amusingly outlandish tales of which Allais was a recognized master. Although the artistic output of the Hydropathes was as varied as the group's membership, certain patterns and tendencies are discernible. Most of the artists were young men (the entire group included, by the way, only a single woman, the poet and musical composer Marie-Ann,\n\n8 Paris: Black Cats and Reed Pipes or María, Krysinska, who was of Polish extraction), of libertarian and egalitarian persuasion, antibourgeois, anti- and unconventional, contemptuous of the Establishment (but willing to accept employment in its institutions and offices for the sake of income), and very much a part of the spirit and style of the late nineteenth-century Latin Quarter. In their literary works and chansons they often sang of the Latin Quarter, its people, its ambience, just as they were to do of Montmartre to which many of them migrated in the era of the Black Cat. Almost to the man, they were writers of the city, not indifferent to the beauties and mysteries of nature, but strongly attuned to the sounds and sights of the city, above all of Paris, celebrators of the great capital in its parts and as the sum of its parts. Primarily poets, the Hydropathes tended to be more daring in content than form. Their attitude to life and art was often irreverent and devilmay-care. The lightness, casualness, whimsy, and even absurdity of their poetry barely concealed an intended mockery of convention, social as well as artistic. Take, for example, Charles Cros' \"Le Hareng Saur\" (The Salt Herring), which became a Hydropathes classic in its own time. The poem is brief enough to quote in full: Il était un grand mur blanc—nu, nu, nu. Contre le mur une échelle—haute, haute, haute, Et, par terre, un hareng saur—sec, sec, sec. Il vient, tenant dans ses mains—sales, sales, sales, Un marteau lourd, un grand clou—pointu, pointu, pointu. Un peloton de ficelle—gros, gros, gros. Alors il monte à l'échelle—haute, haute, haute. Et plante le clou pointu—toc, toc, toc, Tout en haut du grand mur blanc—nu, nu, nu. Il laisse aller le marteau—qui tombe, qui tombe, qui tombe. Attache au clou la ficelle—longue, longue, longue. Et, au bout, le hareng saur—sec, sec, sec. Il redescend de l'échelle—haute, haute, haute. L'importe avec le marteau—lourd, lourd, lourd; Et puis, il s'en va ailleurs,—loin, loin, loin. Et depuis, le hareng saur—sec, sec, sec. Au bout de cette ficelle—longue, longue, longue. Très lentement se balance—toujours, toujours, toujours.\n\nParís: Black Cats and Reed Pipes 9 J'ai composé cette histoire,—simple, simple, simple. Pour mettre en fureur les gens—graves, graves, graves, Et amuser les enfants—petits, petits, petits. 8\n\nThe poem was an instant hit with the Hydropathes who responded to its whimsical nonsensicality and for whom the last two lines—Pour mettre en fureur les gens—graves, graves, grave, / Et amuser les enfants—petits, petits, petits—wholly accorded with their own inclinations. The following translation into English was recited at one of the Hydropathes soirées by Alphonse Allais, who took it from the Memoirs of my Dead Life (1906, p. 92) of George Moore (1852-1933): The Song of the \"Salt Herring\" He came along holding in his hands dirty, dirty, dirty, A big nail pointed, pointed, pointed, And a hammer heavy, heavy, heavy, He propped the ladder high, high, high, Against the wall white, white, white, He went up the ladder high, high, high, Placed the nail pointed, pointed, pointed, Against the wall—toc! toc! toe! He tied to the nail a string long, long, long, And at the end of it a salt herring heavy, heavy, heavy, He got down from the ladder high, high, high, Picked up the hammer and went away, away, away. Since then at the end of the string long, long, long, A salt herring dry, dry, dry, Has swung slowly, slowly, slowly. Now I have composed this story simple, simple, simple, To make all serious men mad, mad, mad, And to amuse little children tiny, tiny, tiny. 9\n\nVerlaine, who was also fond of the Cros poem, referred to it in his essay on Cros in Les Hommes d'aujourd'hui (Men of Today, 1885-1893) as \"angélique enfantillage justement célèbre\" (justly famous angelic childishness);10 Coquelin cadet (Ernest Alexandre Honoré Coquelin), a well-known actor in the Comédie Française who gained additional fame for his recitations of Charles Cros' monologues, devoted a dozen pages of the book L'Art de dire le monologue (The Art of Reciting Monologues, Paul Ollendorff, Paris, 1884; pp. 98-109), which he co-authored with his actor-brother Coquelin ainé (Benoit Constant Coquelin), to different possible interpretations of \"Le Hareng Saur.\"\n\n10 París: Black Cats and Reed Pipes The Hydropathes not only wrote poems in a spirit of childish play, but also made children and animals subjects of their works. At times, the outward humor of the poems contrasts with an underlying social point of view. In André Gill's \"Le Levrette et le gamin\" (The Greyhound and the Urchin) a street urchin from the poor Paris district of Villette finds an unusual way to revenge his being peed upon by the elegant greyhound of a marquise from the fashionable Germain neighborhood. The urchin follows the greyhound and the liveried servant walking it after the mishap in the Tuilleries Gardens, kidnaps the dog when he has a chance, takes it back to the Villette, and there mates it with a frightful poodle. The dishonored greyhound later gives birth to a half dozen ugly, foul bastards. But, says Gill, the best part of the story is that as if imitating the behavior of her greyhound, the marquise took her own coachman as a lover shortly thereafter. Concludes Gill: Quel triomphe pour la Villette! Quel deuil pour le faubourg Germain!11 (What a triumph for Villette!/What grief for the Germain district!)\n\nIn one of his more imaginative poems, \"La Revanche des Bêtes et la Revanche des Fleurs\" (The Revenge of Animals and the Revenge of Flowers), Émile Goudeau took as his unusual subject the cruelty and abuse man inflicts on animals and his depopulation of the forests and seas. In the nature of an indictment, the poem opens with a recitation of horrors: Tu tapes sur ton chien, tu tapes sur ton âne; Tu mets un mors à ton cheval, Férocement tu fais un spectre de ta canne, Homme, roi de Règne animal; Quand tu trouves un veau tu lui rôtis la foie; Et bourres son nez de persil; Tu tailles dans le boeuf, vieux laboureur qui ploie, Des biftecks saignant, sur le gril . . , 12 (You strike at your dog, you strike at your donkey;/You fasten a bit on your horse;/You savagely make a specter of your walking-stick,/Man, King of the Animal Kingdom. / When you find a calf, you roast its liver, / And stuff its nose with parsley./From the steer, old plowman bent from toil,/You carve bloody beefsteaks on the grill . . .)\n\nBut a day of reckoning will come when man will be nailed to planks by Eternity and le mangeur será mangé (the eater will be eaten). 13 With\n\nParis: Black Cats and Reed Pipes 11 child-like delight, Goudeau then graphically describes the way the animals will take their revenge, tearing man piece by piece. In a lyrical finale, Goudeau finds an ultimate reprieve for man in his kindness to flowers. Their roots will descend to retrieve the torn pieces of man and to veil their decay beneath a shroud of gold and azure. Ambassador butterflies dispatched by Mother Nature will fly above the tomb of man ready to bestow the kiss of pardon sent by the animals when man himself will at last have become a flower. Poems about drinking, a subject close to the Hydropathes' hearts, were immensely popular. Besides Maurice Bouchor's \"Beuverie flamande\" (A Flemish Drinking Party) and \"La Gloire des nez\" (The Glory of Noses)14 and Gaston Senéchal's \"Chanson à boire\" (Drinking Song),15 one of the most popular of all was Emile Goudeau's unfinished epic-like \"Les Polonais\" (The Poles). The merry poem, about a punitive Polish campaign against the French who have spurned Alcohol, the God of Drink, and have turned to water and withheld all their wine and cognac from him, begins this way: En ce temps-là, le duc Jean Soulografìeski, Prince des Polonais et Ruthènes, à qui Sa soif de Danaîde avait donné la gloire, Descendit longuement de son trône, et, sans boire, Dit aux ivrognes vieux qui formaient son conseil: \"L'heure est enfin sonnée au cadran du soleil, \"L'heure où sur les Gaulois, ces buveurs à vergogne, \"Devra prédominer l'étendard de Pologne \"L'étendard rouge, et jaune, et blanc, drapeau divin \"Dont la forme est bouteille, et dont le fond est vin.\"16 (At that time, Duke Jan Soulografìeski,/Prince of the Poles and Ruthenians, whose/Bottomless thirst of the Danaids was the source of his glory,/At length descended his throne, and, without drinking, /Said to the old drunkards who formed his council : / \"The hour has finally struck at the sun dial, / The hour when the flag of Poland,/The red, yellow, and white flag, divine banner,/Whose shape is that of a bottle against a background of wine,/Must predominate over the Gauls, those modest drinkers.)\n\nMaurice Mac-Nab, whose fame was to rest principally on his contributions to the genre of the Parisian chanson, splendidly upheld the libertine tradition of the Hydropathes in his own poems. One of his most celebrated is a ballad lamenting women's cold behinds, \"Ballade des derrièrs\n\n12 París: Black Cats and Reed Pipes froids\" (Ballad of Cold Behinds). T h e source of the poet's chagrin is established in the first stanza: Aux baisers caressants de vos lèves câlines, O femmes, j'ai parfois ranimé mes ardeurs, En votre chair rosée enfonçant mes canines J'a dejeuné d'amour et diné d'impudeurs Au fond de vos boudoirs pleins d'exquises odeurs. Et pourtant, c'est en vain que ma main promenée Sur vas reins, a cherché la chaleur incarnée: Séjour incombustible ainsi qu'un coffre-fort, Ou j'ai trouvé toujours (Etrange destinée), La froideur du derrière, image de la mort. 17 (With the caressing kisses of your coaxing lips,/O women, I've sometimes revived my ardor,/And plunging my teeth into your pink flesh /I've lunched on love and dined on immodesties / Against the background of your bedrooms full of exquisite scents./Yet nevertheless, 'tis in vain that my hand, passing/Over your loins, sought heat incarnate./Incombustible abode as well as strongbox,/ Where I've always found (Strange Destiny)/The cold of the behind, image of death.) Characteristically, perhaps, it was also Mac-Nab who found material for poetry in the human fetus. The point of the poem \"Les Foetus\" (Fetuses) is that the unborn baby really does not have such a bad life. In fact, it can even be envied: Gentils foetus, ah! que vous êtes Heureux d'avoir rangé vos têtes Loin de nos humaines tempêtes! Heureux, sans vice ni vertu; D'indifférence revêtu, Votre coeur n'a jamais battu. Et vous seuls vous savez, peut-être, Si c'est le suprême bien-être Que d'être mort avant de naître!18 (Dear fetuses! Ah! How fortunate you are/For having placed your heads/Far from our human tempests! / Fortunate, with neither vice nor virtue;/Cloaked in indifference,/Your hearts have never known strife./And you alone, perhaps,/ Know if it is the supreme well-being/To be dead before being born!) Since drinking was never long out of the Hydropathes' thoughts, MacNab also finds a way of introducing this theme into his reflections on the good life of the fetus:\n\nParís: Black Cats and Reed Pipes\n\n13\n\nFoetus, au fond de vos bocaux, Dans les cabinets médicaux, Nagez toujours entre deux eaux, Démontrant que tout corps solide Plongé dans l'élément humide Déplace son—poids de liquide! C'est ainsi que, tranquillement, Sans changer de gouvernement, Vous attendrez le Jugement! 19 (Fetuses, at the bottom of your jars,/Inside medicine chests,/Swim always under water,/Demonstrating that every solid body,/Submerged in a watery element, /Displaces its weight in liquid!/And thus, quietly,/Without changing course,/You will soften Judgment!)\n\nIf his poem has to have a moral, which he supposes it does, Mac-Nab concludes that C'est qu'en dépit des prospectus D e tous nos savants, les foetus Ne sont pas les gens mal f . . , 20 (In spite of the views/Of all our scientists, fetuses/Are not at all a f. . . . d up lot!)\n\nThat not all of the poetry of the Hydropathes was amusing, whimsical, offbeat, or erotic is amply attested by the work of two serious poets who enjoyed a close relationship with the Parisian cabaret of the late nineteenth century, Maurice Rollinat (1846-1903) and Jean Richepin (18491926). Although Rollinat's first collection of verse, Dans les brands (In the Heather, 1877), met with little success, his second volume, Les Névroses (Neurotics, 1883), established his reputation, although even then he never became a popular poet. The ability of the Hydropathes to accommodate a broad range of poetic creativity is nowhere better exemplified than in the case of Rollinat. His feeling for music and his skill at playing accompaniment to his own songs on the piano made him a prominent figure at Hydropathes soirées. Indeed, so fond of Rollinat's songs was the great chanteuse of turn-of-the-century Paris, Yvette Guilbert (1865-1944), that she incorporated a number of them into her own repertoire. But Rollinat's deeply pessimistic outlook on life, his taste for the morbid and macabre were atypical of the poetry of the Hydropathes and were only partially offset by his poems in an amorous vein. \"Le\n\n14 París: Black Cats and Reed Pipes C h a m b r e , \" which was dedicated to Charles Cros, typifies the bleakness Rollinat perceived b o t h a r o u n d and inside himself: Ma chambre est pareille à mon âme, Comme la mort l'est au sommeil: Au fond de l'être, pas de flammes! À la vitre, pas de soleil! Les murailles sont recouvertes D'un lamentable papier gris Où l'ombre des persiennes vertes Met des taches de vert-de-gris. . . . Compagnon de ma destinée, Un crâne brisé, lisse et roux, Du haut de l'humble cheminée Me regarde avec ses deux trous. Meubles, tableaux, fleurs, livres, même, Tout sent l'enfer et le poison, Et, comme un drap, l'horreur, qui m'aime Enveloppe cette prison. Triste chambre où l'ennui qui raille Veille à mes côtes nuit et jour. J'écris ces vers sur ta muraille, Et je bénis ton noir séjour; Car le torrent aime le gouffre. Et le hibou, l'obscurité; Car tu plais à mon coeur qui souffre Par ton affreuse identité! 21 (My room is like my soul,/Like death it is asleep./In the back of the hearth, there are no flames!/In the window, there is no sun!/The walls are covered/ With a lamentable gray paper / On which the shadow of green shutters / Deposits stains of verdigris./Companion of my destiny, / A broken skull, smooth and reddish,/Observes me through its two holes/From the top of a modest fireplace./ Furniture, pictures, flowers, books, I myself/Reek of hell and poison./And. like a sheet, the horror that loves me/Envelops this prison./Sad chamber in which the boredom that watches over me/Sits by my side day and night,/I write this verse on your wall,/And I bless your black abode;/Since the torrent loves the abyss,/And the owl the darkness;/Since you please my heart which suffers from your frightful likeness.) Even when writing a b o u t love, as in the p o e m \" L ' A m o u r , \" which was set to music, Rollinat yielded n o n e of his bleakness and despair, none of his fondness for images of the corrosive and murderous:\n\nParís: Black Cats and Reed Pipes 15 L'Amour est un ange malsain Qui frémit, sanglote et soupire. Il est plus moelleux q'un coussin, Plus subtil que l'air qu'on respire, Plus provocant qu'un spadassin. Chacun cède au mauvais dessein Que vous chuchote et vous inspire Le Dieu du meurtre et du larcin, L'Amour. Il voltige comme un essaim. C'est le prestigieux vampire Qui nous saigne et qui nous aspire, Et nul n'arrache de son sein Ce perfide et cet assassin, L'Amour.22 (Love is an unhealthy angel /Who shudders, sobs, and sighs. /He is softer than a cushion,/More delicate than the air you breathe,/More provocative than a hired thug!/Everyone yields to the evil design/That you whisper and inspire,/ God of crime and larceny, Love./He flits about like a swarm,/He is the marvelous vampire /Who bleeds us and sucks us, /And no one can uproot from his breast/This treacherous person and murderer, Love.)\n\nJean Richepin (1849-1926) was hardly more cheerful a poet than Rollinat. Among the Hydropathes and the devotees of the turn-of-thecentury Parisian cabaret he was most admired for the poems contained in such volumes as La Chanson des gueux (The Beggars' Song, 1876) and Les Blasphèmes (Blasphemies, 1884).23 In their time, both collections were considered scandalous in different ways, a fact that merely raised Richepin in the esteem of the bohemian literary community of the Latin Quarter and Montmartre. La Chanson des gueux introduced not only the Paris of the slums and back alleys, of the poor and the homeless, of prostitutes and pimps, of drifters, thieves, and petty criminals of every hue and stamp, but also the idiom, the argot of this other Paris. Underlying Richepin's choice of subject was no mere fascination with the darker and seamier sides of Parisian life, with the indigent and criminal as a source of literary novelty, but a keen social consciousness. Richepin was an enemy of privilege and injustice, a stern critic of the existing social and economic system at whose doorstep he laid responsibility for poverty and crime. The poem \"Noël Misérable,\" which Jules Lévy included in his anthology of Hydropathe prose and poetry, typifies the mood of the Chanson des gueux as a whole\n\n16 París: Black Cats and Reed Pipes Noël! Noël! A l'indigent Il faudrait bien un peu d'argent, Pour acheter du pain, des nippes. Petits enfants, petits Jésus, Des argents que vous avez eus Il aurait bourré bien des pipes. . . . Et le misérable là-bas Voit la crèche comme un cabas Bondé de viande et de ripaille, Et dans lequel surtout lui plaît Un beau petit cochon de lait . . . C'est l'enfant Jésus sur la paille. Noël! Noël! Le prêtre dit Que Dieu parmi nous descendit Pour consoler le pauvre hère. Celui-ci voudrait bien un peu Boire à la santé de bon Dieu; Mais Dieu n'a rien mis dans son verre. . . . Noël! Noël! Les malheureux N'ont rien pour eux qu'un ventre creux Oui tout bas grogne comme un fauve. Si bien que le bourgeois, voyant Leur oeil dans l'ombre flamboyant, A u lieu de leur donner, se sauve. 24 (Christmas! Christmas! The poor man/Needs a little money/To get some bread, some old rags to wear./Little children, little Jesuses,/From the money you've gotten,/He'd have plenty to stuff his pipes with./And the wretch over there/ Sees the crèche as a basket /Crammed full of meat and goodies/ And in which he especially likes/A nice little suckling pig . . . /It's the infant Jesus on the straw./Christmas! Christmas! The preacher declares/That God descended among us/For the purpose of bringing consolation/To the poor wretch./He, the wretch, would indeed be quite happy/To drink to the health of the good Lord;/But G o d put nothing in his glass. . . . / Christmas! Christmas! The unfortunate/Have nothing for themselves except an empty stomach/That growls deeply like a wild beast,/So that the bourgeois, When he sees their faces in the burning shadows, / Instead of giving them anything, runs away.)\n\nThe irreverence and cynicism in a poem on the greatest holiday in the Christian calendar serves as a kind of introduction to the repudiation of Christian belief and doctrine of Les Blasphèmes, which brought Richepin still greater scandal and controversy than the Chanson des gueux. In this later collection of poems Richepin carried his indignation and outrage at\n\nParís: Black Cats and Reed Pipes 17 social injustice to its logical extreme: there is no God, there is no life after death, organized religion and especially Christianity are a mockery, the world itself is but chaos, life a dreary monotony meaning nothing, leading nowhere, governed only by chance. Man's only response to the world around him should be laughter, le consolateur des hommes (the consoler of men), as he puts it in the poem \"Diagnostic.\" 25 The importance of the Hydropathes to the subsequent development of cabaret in Paris explains the length to which they have been treated here. Before a fatal schism erupted in their ranks, mostly over the matter of a preference of some for outlandish practical jokes that others in the group became increasingly less patient with, the Hydropathes represented the first major step in the evolution of the fin-de-siècle Parisian cabaret. Their numbers became too large, their places of meeting too characterless and subject to change, their soirées perhaps too eclectic and impromptu, too unstructured, for the loose association of artists to become more than what we may regard as a proto-cabaret. But for all their diversity and eclecticism, the Hydropathes did share common points of view. They were largely younger people, iconoclastic, irreverent, rebellious, defiant of conventions, passionately antibourgeois, and by and large indifferent to public opinion. Their purpose in coming together as they did reflected awareness of similarities that created a bond among them and an obvious desire to be mutually supportive. They were the bohemian artists of the Latin Quarter and they were proud of it. After the \"official\" inauguration of the group on October 17, 1878, at the Café de Rive-Gauche, it was only a matter of time, and not much at that, before other artists of the Latin Quarter came to share their soirées and drinking parties. As their ranks swelled, the premises of the Café de Rive-Gauche became too cramped and otherwise inhospitable and a new, larger location was found after the tenth evening at the hôtel Boileau, situated at number 19 on the same Rue Cujas. The success of the \"club\" led to the launching in 1879 of an ancillary enterprise, a journal or magazine called appropriately L'Hydropathe. Émile Goudeau became the editorin-chief, Paul Vivien, a well-to-do law student with a sense of business, its director, or chief administrator, and Jules Jouy, its secretary. Like the later Le Chat Noir (and other cabaret journals), which it undoubtedly inspired, L'Hydropathe served as both self-advertising for the parent club or cabaret and as an outlet for smaller literary works (mainly poems and\n\n18 París: Black Cats and Reed Pipes prose pieces) as well as drawings by member artists. The first issue of the journal, a weekly, appeared on January 22,1879. L'Hydropathe ran for a little over a year with twenty-four numbers being published its first year. In an attempt to broaden its readership, and with the promise of outside financial assistance, the staff of the journal made revisions in format and then introduced a change of name: from number 9 of the second year of publication (1880), L'Hydropathe appeared under the title of Tout-Paris, but owing to the failure principally of the anticipated support to materialize its life was destined to be very short—only five numbers appeared in ail. Before the Hydropathes dissolved toward the end of 1881, the group went through another change of scene in its quest for an ever larger and more stable location. At the end of 1878, after moving from the Café de la Rive-Gauche to the hôtel Boileau, the group repaired to the Colson property at 29 Rue Jussieu, on the edge of the Latin Quarter. 26 But a practical joke involving firecrackers by some of the members, especially Alphonse Allais and Sapeck, resulted in an ultimately vain attempt by Goudeau, as president, to impose discipline on the group. Other incidents on the part of the pranksters, or fumistes, among the Hydropathes finally brought on the rupture that was to spell the club's doom. Frustrated by his efforts to keep his unruly flock in line, Goudeau stormed out in September 1881 swearing never to return again. Sharing his point of view, several of the Hydropathes joined him in the walkout. The remaining members under the leadership mainly of Léo Trezenick (real name, Léon Épinette) sought to reconstitute the group under the new name of the Hirsutes (The Hairy Ones). Goudeau was again invited to become the head of it, but when he refused the offer was extended to, and accepted by, the composer Maurice Petit, the former organist of the Church of Saint-Louis-des-Invalides. The new association of former Hydropathes had no easier time in finding suitable premises than the original group. After being expelled from one location because the proprietor objected to the noise they made, they finally made camp in the basement of the Café de l'Avenir, at the corner where Saint-Michel square and the quay, or embankment, of the same name meet. The defection of Goudeau and others, the reconstitution of the former Hydropathes as Hirsutes, and the move to the Café de l'Avenir in late 1881 signaled the final dissolution of the Hydropathes. The Hirsutes hung on until May 1883, by which time the Café de l'Avenir\n\nParis: Black Cats and Reed Pipes\n\n19\n\nhad been renamed the Café du Soleil d'or, but then they too went the way of the Hydropathes. Their place was soon taken by other groups of similar or yet more striking ephemerality, among them the Incohérents, an association mostly of painters, led by Jules Lévy, and the Zutistes (from the French exclamation zut, meaning, roughly, \"the hell with it\"), whose principal leader was Charles Cros. Each successor group seemed to be not only of shorter life span than the original Hydropathes, but of a more tenuous relationship with cabaret. If the Hydropathes lost their own identity as a separate group in late 1881, many of them, including members of the breakaway Hirsutes, were able to come together again under the banner of the Chat Noir. In fact, without the entry of former Hydropathes into the new Chat Noir one can only wonder if this most famous of Parisian cabarets could ever have become more than the modest café Rodolphe Salis first had in mind when he decided to abandon art for commerce. The Chat Noir How did the fusion of Hydropathes and Chat Noir come about? One evening, after his break with the Hydropathes, Emile Goudeau stopped in at the Grande Pinte, the popular painters' hangout on the Avenue Trudaine. Not long afterward, a small band of revelers entered, among them Rodolphe Salis and the painter René Gilbert. When he saw Goudeau, Gilbert introduced him to the tall, robust, red-haired Salis who was only too happy to talk about his plan to establish a cabaret artistique with the former president of the Hydropathes. Sensing Goudeau's interest, Salis asked him if he would consider joining him in his new venture. 27 The Hydropathes episode of his life behind him and anxious to reestablish himself in the public eye together with those members of the old group who remained loyal to him, Goudeau seized the opportunity. Salis' new Chat Noir thus became the new home of many former Hydropathes who became the core of the Chat Noir's programs in the early years of its history and whose migration from the Latin Quarter to Montmartre assumed a symbolic significance. Other Latin Quarter artists, ex-Hydropathes and Hirsutes among them, soon followed them to Montmartre, becoming part of the entourage of the Chat Noir and bringing to Montmartre some of the mystique previously enjoyed by the Latin Quarter.\n\n20 París: Black Cats and Reed Pipes Recalling his decision to collaborate with Salis in the Chat Noir in his later memoirs, Dix Ans de Bohème (Ten Years of the Bohemian Life), Goudeau drew this important distinction between what Salis intended with the Chat Noir and other cabaret-like ventures which were just beginning to become fashionable. At that time, medieval, Renaissance, or Louis XIII cabarets were just beginning to be opened. The \"Grand' Pinte\" was typical of them. But the painters met there without any fanfare, just as they might have done on the boulevard. Salis, on the other hand, dreamt of reintroducing the hubbub, the antic madness, and the ironplated chanson into our watered-down customs. Moreover, understanding well that all the arts arc brothers, he asks himself why literary people do not join together with painters in order to lend them a few fleeting syllables, perhaps adorned with sonorous rhymes. I shall be a gentleman-cabaretier, says Salis, still a painter, but also a man of letters and chansonnier. The future belongs to me. And thus was the \"Chat Noir\" founded. 2 8\n\nUnderlying Salis' plans for the Chat Noir was the Wagnerian concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk, or the total work of art, which sought a breakdown of traditional barriers between the arts for the sake of their mutual enrichment and the creation of the \"new\" art that would combine the verbal, visual, musical, and choreographical. The Gesamtkunstwerk idea was very much in the air at the time and efforts were being made to achieve a meaningful merging of the arts that would enable them to break out of the narrow confines of the conventional and traditional. As an experiment in Gesamtkunst in miniature, the cabaret ideally was to be an environment hospitable to all the arts by virtue of its casualness and the impromptu nature of its programs. Artists were encouraged to regard the cabaret as their own, a place where they could come together, exchange ideas, discuss art, and perform as the mood struck them. Once the collaboration of Goudeau and other ex-Hydropathes was assured, Salis' dream of establishing a real cabaret artistique had a good chance of reaching fruition. And it was Salis' dream, or rather ambition, that distinguished what the Chat Noir soon became from a group such as the Hydropathes which lacked the same kind of informing vision and existed primarily as a loose association of artists who recognized a basic similarity of outlook and just wanted premises where they could enjoy their own company or perform for whomever they chose. As other artists followed the ex-Hydropathes to Montmartre and the\n\nParís: Black Cats and Reed Pipes 21 Chat Noir the fame of the new cabaret spread far and wide. Before long it became the most sought'out Montmartre establishment, not only by artists but by an ever growing public that included statesmen, foreign dignitaries, the fashionable, and even the bourgeois who was often the butt of Chat Noir humor and who considered himself lucky to get in. Salis was by no means indifferent to the public at large, but he thought first and foremost of the contemporary Parisian artistic community. These were the people for whom he wanted the Chat Noir to exist, for whom he wanted his cabaret to provide a place of rendezvous. The public could be admitted as space allowed but were regarded as a species of privileged onlookers. The physical layout of the Chat Noir actually reenforced the division between artists and public. The long, narrow former post office was divided into two rooms. The first was decorated as previously described, in the style thought of by Salis as that of Louis XIII, with its wood panels, wrought iron, heavy walnut tables and highbacked chairs, lanterns hung from the ceiling, paintings and sketches of artists who frequented the place, and huge fireplaces topped with all sorts of antique and pseudo-antique bric-a-brac. This is where the public and non-regulars were seated, shown to their tables by waiters attired in the costumes of members of the ultraprestigious French Academy—green brocaded coats with gold thread, two-cornered hats, and swords, all picked up by Salis and his associates in junk shops, antique stores, and flea markets of which Paris has always had an abundance. The second or inner room, which was separated from the first by a counter and a heavy curtain that was never completely closed, was reserved for the cabaret's regulars,"
