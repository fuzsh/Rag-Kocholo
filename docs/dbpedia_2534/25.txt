According to Dan Sys of CRN on Radiowest, he points out that Golden West has moved their long standing Country formats from AM to FM in Estevan, Swift Current, and Weyburn, while the AM stations in those communities have all flipped to Classic Hits. In Estevan ROCK 106 CKSE is now COUNTRY 106.1, in Swift Current Classic Rock THE EAGLE CIMG is now COUNTRY 94.1, and in Weyburn Variety Hits BIG 106 CHWY is now COUNTRY 106.7. The AM stations appear to have retained their identities.

Also, It appears Rob Carnie of CHAB/Moose Jaw is now hosting a provinical network show on the AM classic rock stations: CKSW-570, CJSN-1490, CJYM-1330, CFYM-1210, CJSL-1150 and CFSL-1190.
