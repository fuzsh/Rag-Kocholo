CKSW (570AM in Saskatchewan) did a feature half-hour show on some my music – which airs Sat Jan 31/04 at 9pm. Those of you in Sask. can tune in! CKSW is a major country station and focused on the tunes from my past couple CDs that fit that genre (it\’s not all \’pop/AC\’!). The pre-recorded interview was cool – with host(ess) Rebecca Ryan having done her homework on my background and asking great questions. If you hear the show drop me a line and let me know what you thought! (jeff@jeffstraker.com). They\’ve promised to do a hit on my new CD as well – so stay tuned….
